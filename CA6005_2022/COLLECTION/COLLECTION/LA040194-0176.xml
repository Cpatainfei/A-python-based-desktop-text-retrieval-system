   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; FEELING BETRAYED BY SCIENCE ; A SCANDAL OVER FAKED DATA IN A BREAST_CANCER STUDY HAS LEFT PATIENTS REELING AND A PIONEERING DOCTOR IN DISGRACE . IT ALSO HAS HEIGHTENED FEARS ABOUT HUMAN EXPERIMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When she read the news , the patient burst into tears . The story documented flaws in a study that had helped change the course of breast_cancer treatment . Results had been falsified . What was worse , the researchers conducting the clinical trial -- part of a long-running and extremely important series of breast_cancer studies -- knew about the doctored data but remained silent . In an extraordinary reaction , the National Cancer Institute on Tuesday demanded -- and got -- the resignation of the man in_charge of the massive $ 8-million-a-year project : Dr. Bernard Fisher , a pioneering 75-year-old surgeon who is a legend in breast_cancer research . The NCI declared that no more women will be enrolled in the studies until an investigation is completed . All of which left thousands of women who have breast_cancer -- and many of the doctors who treat them -- feeling angry and betrayed . The patient , a 60-year-old Los Angeles public relations specialist , had watched her mother die of the disease 30 years ago . In 1989 , after receiving a diagnosis that she had breast_cancer herself , she decided to have only the malignant lump removed -- based in part on this project ' s finding that lumpectomy was as effective as mastectomy , in which the entire breast is removed . Now , she is wondering if she made the right choice , even though experts insist that she did . She has lost faith in those who do medical research . &quot; If you can ' t trust the people who are running this kind of trial , &quot; she asked , &quot; who can you trust ? &quot; Indeed , there are many questions surrounding the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project -- a three-decade-long research effort that has involved 5 # 000 doctors , 484 hospitals and more_than 44 # 000 patients throughout the United States and Canada . The scandal has rocked the breast_cancer community and raised serious concerns about quality_control in human experiments . Specialists are hurrying to reassure patients that , despite the discrepancies in the data , the basic conclusion of the study stands : A woman ' s entire breast need not be removed when she has cancer ; lumpectomy is a safe alternative . &quot; It ' s much ado about nothing , &quot; said Dr. Susan M . Love , a nationally renowned expert who is director of the UCLA Breast Center . &quot; There are multiple other studies showing the same thing . Even if you threw the whole study out , it still would n ' t change the fact that lumpectomy is just as_good_as mastectomy. &quot; Even so , an undercurrent of doubt and anger has risen among patients , doctors and Congress . On April 13 , the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations will conduct a hearing on the project to determine , in the words of a spokesman , &quot; how the system collapsed from beginning to end. &quot; &quot; This is creating a substantial problem of trust and uncertainty , &quot; said Dr. Harmon Eyre , chief medical_officer of the American Cancer Society . &quot; Women are challenging whether or not they had the right treatment , and doctors are concerned about how to respond. &quot; Said Jane Alsobrook , an independent film_producer and breast_cancer patient who serves on the board of a local advocacy group : &quot; It makes us angry that . . . ( authorities ) think it ' s not worth letting the general public know about unless somehow it leaks and creates a stir , and after the fact they say , ' Oh , yes , that did happen , but don ' t worry your little head about it. ' &quot; The controversy comes_on the heels of some widely publicized flaps that have undermined public confidence in the ability of scientists to police themselves . Dr. Robert J . Levine , a professor of medicine at Yale_University and an expert in the ethics of human experiments , points to two recent revelations : Cold_War radiation experiments on humans without their knowledge and a study in which UCLA researchers were criticized for permitting schizophrenic patients to deteriorate before they were put_back on medication that had been helping them . &quot; I think right now there is a tendency to have bad feelings about research on humans , &quot; Levine said . &quot; What people see is headlines , and it sows the seeds of some misgivings . They say , ' There must be something wrong with research if that can go on. ' &quot; Also at stake is the reputation of more_than two_dozen breast_cancer studies , launched in 1958 and known collectively by the acronym NSABP . Paid_for by the National Cancer Institute , the NSABP is coordinated out of the University of Pittsburgh , where Fisher is a professor . The research has meant the difference between life and death for tens of thousands of women . In the United States alone , 182 # 000 women are expected to learn they have breast_cancer this year , and 46 # 000 will lose their lives to the disease , which is the No . 1 cause of cancer in women . The lumpectomy study was not the NSABP ' s only significant accomplishment . Two other findings have been at least as instrumental in changing the course of breast_cancer treatment . NSABP researchers provided the first proof that chemotherapy could help cure breast_cancer . They also proved that &quot; radical_mastectomy , &quot; in which the breast , lymph_nodes and surrounding muscles are cut_out , was not necessary ; &quot; total mastectomy , &quot; in which only the breast and lymph_nodes are removed , is just as effective . The NSABP is running six breast_cancer studies , and a seventh is about to start . Its major research project at the moment is another highly controversial study into whether the drug tamoxifen can prevent breast_cancer among women who have never had the disease but are at high risk . Researchers are trying to enroll 16 # 000 women in the study ; half will receive tamoxifen for five years and the other half will receive a placebo . The scientists recently confirmed that the drug poses a slightly higher threat of causing uterine cancer than previously believed , and have changed the consent form accordingly -- triggering a minor flap . The uproar over the fraudulent data erupted March 13 when the Chicago Tribune reported that federal investigators had uncovered evidence that a Canadian surgeon , Dr. Roger Poisson of St . Luc ' s Hospital in Montreal , had falsified records involving patient enrollment in NSABP studies between 1977 and 1990 . The newspaper went_on to report that Fisher had failed to publish a promised reanalysis of the study and had never publicly acknowledged the fraud . In 1991 , Poisson was barred from further participation , and he has since been barred from receiving federal research money for the next eight years . At a Montreal news_conference Thursday , Poisson admitted &quot; faults of ethics and irregularities of principle &quot; but said he had his patients ' best interests at heart . The Chicago story generated a huge outcry , although the federal_government had actually released the information nearly a year earlier . The Office of Research Integrity , the branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that monitors scientific misconduct and ran the investigation of Poisson , had published its findings last spring in three little-read federal publications . The ORI found that Poisson had either fabricated or falsified data on 99 patients , including those who participated in the lumpectomy study . The phony data did not affect the outcome of the study ; rather , Poisson enrolled women who were not eligible , presumably to impress the study ' s organizers with a greater volume of data . &quot; In retrospect , maybe we should have raised a bigger flag , &quot; said ORI Director Lyle Bivens . &quot; It might have headed_off the panic. &quot; Nor did the National Cancer Institute make the_matter public . An article in this week ' s issue of the journal Science was headlined : &quot; How Not to Publicize a Misconduct Finding. &quot; In an interview Wednesday , Dr. Dwight Kaufman , a top NCI official , said such criticism is legitimate . &quot; It was a serious oversight , &quot; he said . &quot; Frankly , we didn ' t anticipate the level of anxiety and distrust that would emanate from these findings. &quot; But the flaws did not end with Poisson . On Tuesday , the cancer institute announced that ORI investigators had launched another investigation . The inquiry involves St . Mary ' s Hospital in Montreal , where a discrepancy has been found in a date listed in a patient ' s file . Although the organizers of the NSABP were informed of the problem last September , they did not report it to the cancer institute until last week , Kaufman said . That delay cost Fisher his job . The NCI demanded that he be replaced , and the University of Pittsburgh immediately announced that he had requested a leave . Although Fisher will remain involved in the project , the NSABP will be headed on an interim basis by Dr. Donald Trump , deputy director of the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute . &quot; We ' re insisting that they get their act together by changing the leadership and changing some of the procedures , &quot; Kaufman said . He added that the NCI is stiffening the penalties for research groups that fail to report discrepancies promptly , and this week created an independent office whose sole job will be to monitor clinical trials . Fisher ' s ouster sent shock_waves throughout medical_science , especially the network of doctors participating in the NSABP . Many are angry that Fisher was forced to take the fall_for another researcher ' s misdeeds and say that the cancer institute is guilty of the same offense it attributed to Fisher -- not making the discrepancies public right away . &quot; It ' s sad , &quot; said Love , the UCLA professor . &quot; Fisher has been a very important figure . He ' s really been_on the forefront of trying to figure_out new ways of treating breast_cancer . He ' s one of the few creative thinkers that we have , and I don ' t think he ' s actually done anything terrible . &quot; I think that he should have released the information sooner , but my guess is that he probably didn ' t think it would make any difference . And he was right . It didn ' t. &quot; Others , however , are outraged that a scientist of Fisher ' s stature did not report misconduct as soon as he knew about it . &quot; What was missing here was a sense_of_responsibility to all_of the women whose lives have been , are and will be affected by breast_cancer , &quot; said Susan Tibbitts , executive_director of the National Assn . of Women ' s Health_Professionals . &quot; I think there was a lack of respect . Somebody made a judgment that we are not going_to share this information. &quot; Justified or not , a forced departure of this magnitude is practically unheard of , said Levine , the Yale professor . He remembered only one -- about a decade ago . Although there are strict controls on the way research is conducted -- every clinical trial must submit its findings to a &quot; safety and data monitoring committee &quot; -- Levine said the system is not perfect . &quot; A skillful and dedicated data faker can beat almost any monitoring system , &quot; Levine said . But , he added , such deception cannot go_on indefinitely : &quot; It ' s very hard to catch them while it ' s going_on , but at the end of it all , when they . . . see center by center what the results were , if one of them is decidedly out of line there will be an investigation. &quot; Despite all indications that the fraud has not altered the validity of the NSABP research , patients and doctors have been left to cope_with the fallout . Phones were_active in the offices of breast surgeons and oncologists across the nation . &quot; I must have had 30 calls , &quot; said Dr. Avrum Bluming , an Encino oncologist . &quot; It has all been sort of confusing and unsettling , &quot; said Alsobrook , the film_producer who had a lumpectomy three years ago . &quot; To what purpose would somebody falsify results ? For personal glory ? I don ' t really understand . &quot; This is our lives on the line. &quot; Making Progress The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project was begun in 1958 to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-cancer drugs used in conjunction with surgery for breast , colon and rectal cancer . Here are some of its major findings on breast_cancer : * Treatment : In 1961 , the study found that a commonly accepted practice for treating breast_cancer -- removing the ovaries -- was not justified in patients with operable breast_cancer . Because the hormone estrogen is linked to breast_cancer , and the ovaries produce estrogen , doctors often removed them . More recent research , however , has indicated that women who have had their ovaries removed may have less recurrence of breast_cancer . * Radical_mastectomy : A 10-year study in the 1970s eliminated the particularly painful procedure in which the breast , lymph_nodes and pectoral_muscle were removed . The study proved that the far less drastic treatment called &quot; total mastectomy , &quot; in which only the breast and lymph_nodes are removed , is just as effective . Today , radical_mastectomy is considered barbaric . * Chemotherapy : The project was the first research group to prove that chemotherapy could help cure breast_cancer or delay its recurrence . Before this study in the 1970s , chemotherapy was not standard treatment for breast_cancer . * Tamoxifen : The study established that the use of the anti-estrogen agent is beneficial in breast_cancer patients who are past menopause . * Lumpectomy : The research group showed that the procedure whereby only the malignant_tumor is removed , rather than the whole breast , is just as effective when combined with radiation treatment as mastectomy . * Post-surgery : The study established that chemotherapy is beneficial to women who have had breast_cancer surgery and show no sign of cancer in the lymph_nodes under the arm . * Prevention : In 1992 , the research group began studies attempting to determine whether tamoxifen can prevent breast_cancer in women who are at high risk of it .</TEXT>
