   <HEADLINE> EX-REBEL OPTS FOR JAIL , TESTS SALVADOR LEGAL SYSTEM ; LATIN_AMERICA : TOP FORMER GUERRILLA FACES DEFAMATION CHARGE . HE FORGOES $ 60 BAIL TO FORCE ISSUES OF JUDICIAL REFORM , RIGHT-WING DEATH SQUADS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Joaquin Villalobos , who as a master guerrilla strategist eluded capture during 12 years of civil_war , completed Day 16 as a prisoner Thursday , awaiting the outcome of a defamation lawsuit . Two years after peace accords ended the war , legal maneuvering has done to Villalobos what an army backed by billions of U.S. dollars never could . Villalobos was sued by a wealthy businessman he accused of having financed the right-wing death squads that terrorized Salvadorans through much of the 1980s . A court issued an arrest_warrant pending a final ruling in the case . The former guerrilla commander could have avoided jail by paying a 500-colon bail ( just under $ 60 ) but chose instead to force the issue and draw attention to El_Salvador ' s troubled judicial_system as well as the still-unresolved questions surrounding the notorious death squads . &quot; What is at stake is whether the country has really changed or not , &quot; Villalobos said this week in a jailhouse interview with The Times . &quot; We are living through a period of opening_up and speaking out . Punishing me . . . sends a message of juridical repression. &quot; Villalobos , 43 , turned himself in Oct . 18 , after holding a news_conference and leading a 20-car caravan of supporters and journalists to what would become his prison . While he awaits the court ' s ruling , Villalobos is being held at the central headquarters of the National Police , in an office once used by police intelligence and next to a room that former rebels say was once used for torturing suspected leftists . His surroundings are comfortable : He has a telephone , a private bath and his own bodyguards , and his wife , former television broadcaster Roxana Lemus , is allowed to deliver food to him each day . National Police commander Col . Samuel Dolores Cuellar , a wartime enemy of Villalobos , greeted his new prisoner : &quot; It is an honor to have Mr. Villalobos in this place. &quot; Since the end of the war , which claimed tens of thousands of lives , El_Salvador has undergone a difficult period that has seen greater political participation but many unfulfilled expectations in the area of judicial reform . The Villalobos episode comes as scandals erupt on a near-daily basis , involving alleged government and police corruption that implicates current and former senior officials . It follows a bitter struggle within the political left , now divided apparently beyond repair . Villalobos ' legal problems began more_than a year ago , when amid a resurgence of political violence he publicly accused businessman Orlando de Sola of helping to organize and pay_for death squads that pursued and killed hundreds of leftist sympathizers before and during the war . The way Villalobos sees it , he was merely stating one of the many &quot; open_secrets &quot; that characterize recent Salvadoran history . It is widely believed that prominent Salvadoran business people -- some of whom went_on to hold important government posts -- gave the financial_backing that enabled the killers to work so efficiently . A six-month , U.N.-sponsored probe of war atrocities by a panel known as the Truth Commission issued a scathing report in March , 1993 , blaming most abuses on government_security forces and some on the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( FMLN ) . But it failed to name business_leaders behind the death squads and instead called_for further investigation . A second probe earlier this year , also directed by U.N. officials , produced a confidential list of military_men and civilians suspected of organizing death squads , and further investigation was again urged . The government of President Armando Calderon Sol has not acted_on the information . Leaders of his right-wing political_party were once associated with death squads . &quot; You could always speak_of ( abuses committed by ) the armed forces , by judges , by the FMLN , &quot; Villalobos said . &quot; But when it came_to the responsibility of important economic and financial sectors , that was prohibited . . . . The death squads are an unfinished topic. &quot; Originally a court ruled that Villalobos did not commit slander because he was quoting U.S. press reports . As early as 1983 , U.S. newspapers named De Sola , a coffee exporter then living_in Miami and a member of one of El_Salvador ' s richest families , in connection with the right ' s war on communism . De Sola appealed the court ' s ruling , and a higher_court annulled it and ordered the case to proceed . If the suit continues and he is found guilty , Villalobos could face a sentence of up_to three years in jail . De Sola and the political right , pointing to the privileges Villalobos enjoys while in custody , contend that the whole matter is merely a &quot; show. &quot; The right here continues to insist that death squads are a myth created by the left . De Sola has denied financing death squads , although he told a Salvadoran television_station that he did give money to cashiered army Maj . Roberto D ' Aubuisson , the reputed founder of the death squads who died of cancer in 1992 , to help found the Nationalist Republican Alliance party . The party has ruled since the election of Alfredo Cristiani as president in 1989 . Cristiani was succeeded by Calderon Sol this year .</TEXT>
