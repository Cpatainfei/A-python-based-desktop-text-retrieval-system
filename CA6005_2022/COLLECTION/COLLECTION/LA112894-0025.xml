   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : CONVERSATION WITH SANDRA G . BACA ; ' THESE MEN COME FROM SUCH VIOLENT ENVIRONMENTS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Question : What is the men ' s most frequent explanation for what they ' ve done ? Answer : The standard one is , &quot; She provoked me . She would n ' t shut_up . She got_into my face and dared me to hit her . If she had stopped nagging , I would n ' t have done it. &quot; Q : What are you trying to get the men to understand ? A : Getting_across the definition of physical abuse : It ' s pushing , kicking , shoving , biting , pulling her hair , grabbing her , throwing things , threatening her , pulling a gun on her , strangling her , trying to run her over , driving recklessly . It ' s common to hear them say , &quot; I didn ' t hit her . All I did is push her , &quot; but by definition that is a violent act in the state of California . Q : You say that 80 % of abuse in the home is emotional . Does this constitute swearing at somebody , belittling them ? A : That would be verbal abuse , the name_calling . that ' s where you &quot; thing-ify &quot; her , call her the &quot; four favorites , &quot; all denigrating words , the mildest being &quot; whore. &quot; That opens the doors to the physical abuse . After you ' ve thing-ified her , it ' s easy to hit her because you are convinced that she is a piece of garbage . One man said the other day , &quot; I told my wife that she just wasn ' t the same anymore , sexually , after she had two kids. &quot; She got very , very hurt and he couldn ' t understand why . Sometimes we ' ll role-play . we ' ll ask them , &quot; Tell us what you did to her -- use the same tone_of_voice , use the same kind of gestures -- and then let ' s turn it around and have somebody do_it to you. &quot; Q : What ' s the worst reaction you ' ve ever encountered ? A : I have never been physically harmed by anybody ( here ) , but I have been emotionally battered . One will act_as a lightning_rod and the whole group will turn_on me : &quot; You ' re full of it . You ' re a man-hater. &quot; They question my character , they question my sexuality , they question my competence . They will do an emotional job on me . When I disagree_with them , they start getting frustrated -- that ' s what they do best . And I will say to them , &quot; Is that how you do your wife ? &quot; They have not learned to use words as a negotiation skill . A lot of these men come from such violent environments that their behavior is not disturbing to them at all . Q : I know this is a tricky area , but do you find any cultural differences between the men who come here ? A : There are some cultural differences . Black Americans are much more accepting of the blending of the roles . They also are much more into the extended_family and believe_in the concept of community parenting and community disciplining . Black_men are very tolerant of having their woman go and work . Historically , that ' s always happened . In the men I have seen , there is not that much demand for services , ( such_as ) &quot; She ' s got_to have my food ready when I get home. &quot; A lot of Latino men are here because they hit their woman because she did not have dinner ready when they came_home . With Latinos , we come from a culture where the woman ' s role is taking_care of the children . When it comes_to everything else , the man does_it . We see a change in this country when they come here ; the woman is much more easily able to pick_up the language and will find a job , even if it ' s working as a housekeeper , whereas for Latino men it ' s much harder . If their identity has been that of the bread-winner and they ' re not bringing_in the money , there ' s going_to be a lot of hard feelings . Q : What about Anglo men ? A : We don ' t have many in this office . I think it ' s because of where we ' re located . We have some Russians . Their attitude is , &quot; How come women can do all this stuff ? &quot; Q : How did you get_into this work ? A : I was in an abusive marriage . Because I had to learn to identify to survive with an abuser , I can identify how they were thinking , where they were coming from . I come_across as a very strong and independent woman . I haven ' t always been this way . There was a time that I was very dependent_on this man . I had four children by the time I was 21 . Nobody seemed to think that what he was doing to me was a problem , so I convinced myself that it wasn ' t a problem . If I allowed myself , I could sit_down and have a pity party . I am trying to use my energy to help women , to understand violence and how we do_it . What Her Clients Say ' It took a lot of tension out of me . I rarely lose my temper anymore . I take time-outs , work the program in my mind. ' -- Charlie ' I think I ' ve already learned my lesson . . . . I don ' t think it ' s fair that everyone has to come_to 52 sessions. ' -- Anthony ' I didn ' t believe_in this program when I first came . Now I have realized there is a lot of violence in each of us. ' -- Manuel ' The best thing is that I understand how to not let someone provoke me into a situation where I ' m the loser ' . -- Murvin ' I thought it was going_to be more structured . It ' s more about having people examine you , you examine them , and talk it out. ' -- Jason</TEXT>
