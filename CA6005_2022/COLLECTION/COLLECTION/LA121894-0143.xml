   <HEADLINE> THE STUDIO SHUFFLE ; FRANK MANCUSO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Then : Chairman of Paramount Pictures , 1984-1991 . Now : Chairman of MGM / UA , July 1993 . * One morning in the spring of 1991 , before he left for work , Frank Mancuso received a shocking phone_call at_home from his New York-based boss Martin Davis . As a result , he found himself being forced_out as chairman of Paramount Pictures , the studio where he had cut his industry teeth and worked for some 30 years . For the two previous weeks , he now says , there had been &quot; a lot of tension between me and Davis. &quot; While he had been aware that Davis was looking_to bring_in a president and chief operating officer at the studio ' s parent company , Paramount Communications , Mancuso says , &quot; I wasn ' t aware that I would have to report to him. &quot; During the fateful phone conversation , in which Davis told Mancuso that producer Stanley Jaffe , who had a deal at Paramount with Sherry Lansing , had been hired for the job , Davis tried to persuade Mancuso that the management restructuring would be &quot; terrific. &quot; Davis even went so far as_to get_on a plane that afternoon and fly to Los Angeles &quot; to tell me how good it was going_to be. &quot; But Mancuso saw the handwriting on the wall . &quot; I chose to believe that ( Jaffe ' s hiring ) would change my role and I didn ' t want to participate , &quot; he says . In fact , Mancuso ' s contract precluded his reporting to anyone but Davis . Soon after , Mancuso resigned and filed a $ 40-million breach_of_contract suit against Paramount , and won a settlement . The most painful part of the experience , he says , was &quot; being denied something you love to do -- it hurts. &quot; Yet he says he knew that he worked in &quot; a revolving-door industry. &quot; Mancuso , now 61 , says , &quot; I realized I had lived the American_dream , &quot; having gone from being an usher_in a movie_theater to being the head of one of Hollywood ' s major studios . &quot; I decided to take that experience away rather than those last two weeks. &quot; In a recent interview at his spacious executive suite at MGM / UA headquarters in Santa Monica , Mancuso says , &quot; The greatest benefit of leaving Paramount was the opportunity to fulfill on a personal basis all_of the things I never had the time to do while I was chairman , because the job is completely consuming. &quot; He suggested to his wife of 37 years , Faye , that finally they could travel and spend time with their family . And they did -- but nine months later , he started feeling antsy . &quot; The pace of my life changed so dramatically , from having no time to do anything to having all_the time to do anything . I got totally bored. &quot; In 1993 , after an aborted effort to produce a film for his friend Jack Nicholson , he was approached by Mike Ovitz on behalf of Credit Lyonnais , which owned the beleaguered MGM , about coming_in to resuscitate the studio and restart its dormant UA arm , which hadn ' t released a film since 1990 ' s &quot; Rocky V. &quot; Describing what running a studio is like the second time around , Mancuso says he encounters &quot; a lot fewer surprises today &quot; and finds the time pressures &quot; are less of a burden . . . you have a better sense of how to divide your time. &quot; Perhaps the biggest revelation for him in returning to the studio ranks is that &quot; traveling , playing golf and playing tennis , was not relaxation to me . This , work , is relaxation. &quot; CLAUDIA ELLER</TEXT>
