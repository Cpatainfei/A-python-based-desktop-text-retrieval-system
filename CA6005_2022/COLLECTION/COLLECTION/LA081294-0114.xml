   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP OF BASKETBALL IS STILL NOTHING BUT A DREAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Based on current evidence , basketball ' s World Championships may realize NBA Commissioner David Stern ' s dream of matching soccer ' s World Cup but needs time to catch_up . How about 5 # 000 years ? Dinosaurs will walk the earth again first and not just in &quot; The Flintstones. &quot; Soccer sells_out 100 # 000-seat stadiums with average ticket prices of more_than $ 300 in corners of the globe -- like ours -- where the game is a rumor . This tournament went a week before selling_out a 17 # 000-seat arena . When Canada lost to Greece a_few days ago in Maple Leaf Gardens , the crowd was 11 # 083 , most of them Greek-Canadians waving blue and white_flags and drowning_out fans of the home team . &quot; I can ' t comment on that , &quot; Canadian Coach Ken Shields said . &quot; But you know , it ' s pretty hard for Canadian kids playing for their home country to get booed in our building. &quot; The U.S. entry , known as &quot; Dream Team II &quot; but rarely outside TV ads , is hardly the glamour item its predecessor was . This team ' s first three games in nearby Hamilton played to about 70 % of capacity . Opponents did not ask_for autographs or to pose with the U.S. players for pictures as they did with the real Dream Team . The original Dream Team was made_up of legends . These are just guys , however famous . &quot; The first thing you did when you started a game was take a picture with Michael Jordan and Magic ( Johnson ) and ( Scottie ) Pippen , &quot; said Puerto Rico Coach Carlos Morales , an assistant on the 1992 team in the Olympic qualifying tournament at Portland . &quot; That was our standard procedure before every game . And then when we were guarding somebody , the guy who was guarding , let ' s say , Magic , was watching the bench so somebody would have his camera and take a picture . It was the biggest moment of our players ' lives just being_on the same court with them. &quot; The players on this team , trying to live_up_to their elders ' legend , have solved the problem with a party atmosphere , firing themselves up while rubbing opponents ' noses in ignominious defeats . This has not been as popular -- opponents are complaining -- as it has been effective . &quot; You ' re going back to the traditional basketball when you dunk it and run_down the court , &quot; Reggie Miller said . &quot; Well , you ' re in the new age now. &quot; Unfortunately , the U.S. players are only doing what they do every day at_home . The NBA game is shot through_with styling , woofing , intimidation and attempts to cultivate a personality suitable for getting_into TV commercials . Coach Don Nelson , a hard driver in the days before &quot; the new age , &quot; has acknowledged that he exerts little influence over his players . Nelson is here to make friends , for American basketball and perhaps a_few for himself , which may be why he has lavished such praise on Shaquille O ' Neal , comparing him to Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain , even saying at one point , &quot; I know we ' ll be friends for the rest of our lives. &quot; Coincidentally or not , Nelson can get_out of his Golden State contract_in a season , and O ' Neal ' s coach in Orlando , Brian Hill , is_on shaky ground . If Canadian crowds eat_up the American dunk-o-ramas , back in the States where people have seen Shaq dunk once or twice , this tournament is a yawner . Away from its European hotbed or the Olympic spotlight , international basketball is a second-rate carny show . Before the NBA decided that this tournament had marketing possibilities , it meant nothing in the United States , which sent hastily chosen squads . Only two American Hall of Famers ever participated , and one -- Bill Walton -- was a 17-year-old coming_out of high_school who played in one game . In 1959 , U.S. officials advertised an open tryout in an Air_Force newspaper and fielded a team made_up solely of servicemen . In 1978 , Athletes in Action represented the United States . Real interest requires that the Americans send their best players , which has happened , and the rest of the world catch_up , which is another thing altogether . If an American team may well lose a game before anyone imagines -- simply because few can imagine it -- real competition is years away , or decades . Although the level of play overseas has improved dramatically , the pool of players capable of crashing the NBA has mysteriously dried_up . In the 1980s , European basketball narrowed a gap thought insurmountable , developing a generation of NBA players : Vlade Divac , Drazen Petrovic , Sarunas Marciulionis , Dino Radja , Toni Kukoc . Lithuania ' s 7-foot-4 Arvidas Sabonis , the greatest of the Europeans and a Portland draft choice , didn ' t come because of an Achilles ' tendon injury . But the 26-year-old Kukoc was the last of the prodigies . NBA scouts are here in_force , but beyond Toni , there is only international basketball ' s Missing Generation . &quot; There ' s a void there , &quot; says Donn Nelson , Don ' s son and the man who , as a Warrior assistant , spent months in Lithuania recruiting Marciulionis . &quot; They keep talking_about cycles whenever I go_over there , &quot; the younger Nelson said . &quot; They talk_about , ' These years were great_years for basketball , the year Sarunas was born. ' &quot; I mean Lithuania had Sarunas , Sabonis , Rimas Kurtinaitis ( the jump shooter who gunned the U.S. collegians down while playing for the Soviet_Union in the 1988 Seoul Olympics ) , Valdemaras Khomichius . All those were great players from that area . &quot; They ' ve got other things to worry about . Their minds are not on leisure activities right now . You know , they ' re experiencing real turmoil . You ' re not seeing the great young players because there ' s not as much of an emphasis right now. &quot; Still , in junior competition , matching players of the same age , international teams are routinely beating American squads , hinting at another spurt overseas . This one will look different , however . Instead of coming_to America as established professional stars , more foreign players will attend colleges here , as did Germany ' s Detlef Schrempf and Nigeria ' s Hakeem Olajuwon . &quot; Belorussia has an excellent young team that won the World Championships , &quot; Nelson said . &quot; One of their kids , Alexander Koul , is going_to be playing for Mike Jarvis at George_Washington . Excellent prospect . They ' ve got another small forward who is better than Arturas Karnishiovas , who went_to Seton Hall and is an NBA prospect . &quot; The colleges are getting more and more knowledgeable_about the talent that ' s over there , especially after the breakup of the Soviet_Union . Times are tough over there , and ( players ) are happy to come_over here . And they don ' t know the difference between Wright State and UCLA . They just know it ' s America. &quot; The tournament ends this weekend with huge crowds expected at SkyDome . It won ' t be like Duke-UNLV in the Final Four or Brazil-Italy in soccer ' s World Cup , but as that first one-celled organism that crawled out of the sea millions of years ago could tell you , you ' ve got_to start somewhere . World Basketball Notes The tournament ' s semifinalists are set -- the United States , Croatia , Russia and Greece . The pairings will be decided by tonight ' s concluding quarterfinal games . Dream Team II , the U.S. entry and prohibitive favorite , plays Russia , and Croatia meets Greece , the only semifinalist to have lost a game . The final four teams are a combined 19-1 . The winners and losers criss-cross in Saturday ' s semifinals , with those winners playing for the title and the losers for the bronze medal . Richard Matienzo , a 6-foot-6 center who leads the Cuban team in scoring in the tournament , is seeking refugee status in Canada , the Canadian Press reported Thursday . Matienzo left the team after a practice Thursday morning in Toronto and contacted two Toronto newspapers asking_for help in staying in Canada after the tournament ends Sunday .</TEXT>
