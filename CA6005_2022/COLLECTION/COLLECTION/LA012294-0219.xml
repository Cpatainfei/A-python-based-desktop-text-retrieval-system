   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; MAJOR DODGES BULLET IN PROBE OVER SALES TO IRAQ</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With unprecedented testimony before an independent inquiry , Prime_Minister John Major has , for now , sidestepped a political land_mine involving what Conservative governments he has served in may have known about British sales of militarily sensitive equipment to Iraq . The opposition Labor_Party had hoped that Tory officials would be politically tarred when they were forced to admit that they broke their own rules and shipped critical supplies -- arms-making machine_tools and other &quot; dual-use &quot; equipment -- to Baghdad before the Persian_Gulf_War . Major -- following the example of his predecessor , Margaret Thatcher , who gave hostile testimony to an investigative panel headed by Lord Justice Richard Scott -- denied specific knowledge of a change in the government guidelines on dual-use exports to Iraq . Although less frosty than Thatcher , Major still managed to be equally reticent about export laws that governed the British-Iraqi transactions that occurred during the time he was a treasury minister , foreign secretary , chancellor_of_the_Exchequer and even until late 1992 , when he was prime_minister . His appearance this week marked the first time in parliamentary history that a serving prime_minister had gone before an outside , investigative tribunal . Major contended that if there were changes made to the export regulations , effectively barring dual-use sales to Iraq , he knew_nothing of them and suggested they had been made by junior ministers who failed to tell him and other senior officials about them . That argument infuriated Labor_Party leader John Smith , who had predicted that the prime_minister ' s testimony would expose him as &quot; a knave or a fool , &quot; because in early 1992 Major had declared that the guidelines had been followed . The rough export rules were originally announced to Parliament in October , 1985 , and were secretly relaxed in December , 1988 -- a decision that , testimony has indicated , was agreed to by senior officials in the foreign , defense and trade ministries . The rule relaxation led to exports of machine_tools and engineering equipment that could be used to manufacture arms . Matrix Churchill Co . was one of the companies charged by the Customs Office with violating the rules to conduct illegal trade with Iraq . The trial against Matrix Churchill officials collapsed in November , 1992 , when the defense showed that British intelligence knew that the parts might have military uses and that the Department of Trade had approved the shipments . Alan Clark , the outspoken former junior defense minister , has told the inquiry that the guidelines were fudged to help British companies compete for Iraqi sales . Clark has admitted being &quot; economical with the truth &quot; in publicly advising Parliament on the case . But he argued that British jobs were at stake . The probe has uncovered the cozy way -- even by British standards -- that business was conducted in Thatcher-Major governments : It was kept_from public and parliamentary view . &quot; The inquiry has uncovered layers of scandal , &quot; said Anthony Sampson , a social historian . &quot; Most seriously , it reveals the lack of any effective check on the abuses of power. &quot;</TEXT>
