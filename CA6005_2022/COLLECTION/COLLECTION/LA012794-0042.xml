   <TEXT> Are earthquakes all bad ? Some might say they are ; after all , people die , get hurt , their homes crumble , businesses collapse . In addition to the tragedies , though , earthquakes bring benefits as well . Being a resident of California who constantly experiences earthquakes can only lessen the fear of death . Each time you come_out alive , you are certainly grateful to whatever power you believe_in . Yet you also gain confidence and grow through that experience . You also have something to talk_about now and in your old_age . Earthquakes are also good in that each time one occurs , the stress on the land is relieved a little . This means that every time we have a minor earthquake , the &quot; Big One &quot; won ' t be as big . The damage that an earthquake does is extensive . But it gives us a chance to rebuild , restructure and expand . But first we must feel the loss , before we experience the gain . Through the restructuring , neighbors and strangers alike are brought_together . People can assemble together to fight_off the drastic effects of nature . Through the devastating fires , earthquakes and other hazards , people can unite for the better . So the next time an earthquake occurs , try to look beyond the damage it did . Rather , look_at the rebuilding you can do .</TEXT>
