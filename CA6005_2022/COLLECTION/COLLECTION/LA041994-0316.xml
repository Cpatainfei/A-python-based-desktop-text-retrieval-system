   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG : EXCELLENCE ROARS IN NBC ' LIONS ' ; TELEVISION : THE WORLD_WAR_II EPIC IS ENRICHED BY WRITER AND PRODUCER DAVID W . RINTELS ' CREATIVE WORK AND BY THREE STELLAR PERFORMANCES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Winston Churchill , prime_minister of Great Britain during most of World_War_II , begins speaking with his back to the camera . As he slowly turns toward us , we see a man burdened by the crushing tonnage of leadership in wartime , fearing that an allied invasion of France across the_English Channel will cost 300 # 000 lives . His words are leaden with gloom : &quot; I wake_up at night . . . and see the channel floating . . . with the bodies of the cream of our youth. &quot; If you ' re seeking affirmation that U.S. television still has an epic drama or two up its sleeve , and even an artistic pulse , tune_in the NBC two-parter , &quot; World_War_II : When Lions Roared , &quot; tonight and Wednesday night . Written and produced by David W . Rintels , it ' s stunningly successful both as vibrant entertainment and as a personalized , peephole-widening account of history from a serious and creative dramatist . * Abetted by a troika of stellar performances -- John Lithgow as U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt , Michael Caine as Soviet leader Joseph_Stalin and Bob Hoskins as Churchill -- Rintels ' scintillating , prodigiously researched teleplay relates the war from the often competing perspectives of the three commanders_in_chief . Despite the title , the only roaring here is figurative , and that ' s good . No one is easier to caricature than a high-profile figure with recognizable traits , from a grinning Roosevelt and his appendage-like cigarette_holder to a stogie-chomping Churchill giving his &quot; V &quot; sign to a pipe-smoking Stalin hiding behind a mask of inscrutability as thick as tire rubber . None of that here . And even though they are the visual center of the story , Lithgow , Hoskins and Caine ( give credit to director Joseph Sargent too ) never allow their performances to eclipse the war that is omnipresent despite being seen only in occasional newsreel footage . &quot; Winston , &quot; Roosevelt assures Churchill , &quot; trust me to the bitter end. &quot; But &quot; When Lions Roared &quot; is as much about high-level intrigues and special_interests as anything , with even those closest of collaborators , Roosevelt and Churchill , alternating as human cracks in the alliance . Somehow , though , the three leaders put aside their mutual suspicions and separate political agendas long enough to act incisively and cohesively at critical moments . &quot; When Lions Roared &quot; is unconventional television visually as well as artistically , using split screens , freeze frames and rear projections of newsreel footage in bold ways . There is a lot of clutter on the screen that initially takes getting used to , but Sargent masters these fascinating devices and they work in the long_run , with the split screens narrowing time and physical gaps in ways that allow the three principals to have dialogues across the seas as if they were face to face . On one side of the screen , for example , Churchill dictates a cable to his U.S. ally , while on the other side Roosevelt hears and responds to it as if he were in the same room . Add Stalin , and these simulated video conference_calls become three-way . * The actual face-to-face meetings of the Big Three -- at Tehran in 1943 and at Yalta in 1945 -- are the centerpieces of &quot; When Lions Roared , &quot; just as these conferences were the strategic centerpieces of the war itself . Prior to Tehran , Churchill worries on the screen about the &quot; stupendous issues &quot; facing the Allies . And indeed , Tehran becomes a seedling for the Cold_War while Yalta , in the Crimea , becomes the unofficial stamp of approval for a communist postwar Poland . The &quot; Polish question &quot; is a main_course at Yalta , where a dying Roosevelt arrives in his wheelchair , appearing , as Churchill notes , shockingly &quot; frail and ill , transparent almost. &quot; ( Credit Linda De Vetta with making Lithgow look that way , and also with the convincing transformations of Hoskins and Caine. ) As events would show , Stalin ' s idea of &quot; free elections &quot; for Poland differed from that of his U.S. and British counterparts . Rintels , however , has no intention of using these meetings ( which were shot in Prague and spectacularly mounted by production designer James L . Schoppe ) to create a definitive film record . His script ' s shorthand is hardly all inclusive , omitting the issue of Japan from the Yalta talks , for example . * And there ' s no explanation for Churchill ' s shock at Tehran over Stalin cavalierly calling_for the mass execution of German officers . What the script omits is that the Soviets were already suspected of murdering 1 # 700 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest . More important to Rintels -- and a wise call , given the film ' s time limitations -- is the sense of history that comes from exploring the relationships at play here , and the differences in the personalities and approaches of the three leaders . Churchill and Roosevelt , for example , clash over military strategy and over Stalin , with the President much more trusting with_regard_to Soviet postwar intentions than is the_British leader . &quot; I don ' t know a good Russian from a bad Russian , &quot; Roosevelt says to his confidant , Harry Hopkins ( Ed Begley Jr. ) , about Stalin . As &quot; When Lions Roared &quot; affirms , separating good television from bad television is much easier . * MORE HISTORY : Everybody ' s a critic . All right , perhaps Christopher Columbus wasn ' t greeted on this continent by scantily_clad dancing girls , as a network docudrama depicted in the 1980s . Maybe he didn ' t study his navigational_charts by day , the body of Dona Felipa Perestrello by night . And it ' s likely he wasn ' t told by a fortuneteller : &quot; I see much hardship , but your name will be famous. &quot; For better or for worse , though , television has indeed assumed a primary role as the nation ' s chronicler of the past , both near and distant . Thus it ' s only proper that an entire channel be devoted to history . One ' s on the way , in fact . Its announced mandate : to air historical documentaries , films and miniseries . As in Jaclyn Smith playing Florence_Nightingale . Cable ' s 24-hour History Channel -- a sort of spinoff from the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network -- is scheduled to debut by fall . Before junior historians get terribly excited , though , there ' s the History Channel ' s just-announced agreement with Columbia Pictures to consider . The deal to air 11 movies and miniseries from Columbia does not include the Italian-made Christopher Columbus biography mentioned above . It does include the Oscar-winning &quot; Gandhi &quot; ; &quot; Hope and Glory , &quot; John Boorman ' s very pleasing , kid ' s-eye view of World_War_II England ; and various middle-brow film biographies . Plus , the History Channel promises that after each work , its host and guest historians will explore &quot; any myths or dramatic license &quot; in the presentation . Very nice . Yet on the negative side , the package contains a 1985 TV movie with Smith as Nightingale and a 1983 TV movie_starring Cheryl Ladd as Grace Kelly . I see much hardship for the History Channel , but it ' s name will be famous . * &quot; World_War_II : When Lions Roared &quot; airs at 8 tonight and at 9 p.m. Wednesday on NBC ( Channels 4 , 36 and 39 ) .</TEXT>
