   <TEXT> In 1928 , Alfred Kroeber , founder of the anthropology_department at the University of California , Berkeley , proposed a fascinating theory of culture , which he called &quot; the superorganic. &quot; Still hotly debated , his idea -- in greatly oversimplified form -- goes something like this : every act , every choice has , ultimately , some impetus from a previous experience . This process applies both to individuals and to large , interrelated societies . We are all , in other words , the products of our personal and our collective histories , and if every scrap of data were fully known ( which , of course , it never can be ) , there should emerge a rational explanation for what otherwise might be termed accident , whimsy or even free_will . Most scientists generally subscribe_to this doctrine , inasmuch as their systematic search for answers is based upon the presumption of a logical order in the universe . Reason , more_than fate , is regarded_as the common_denominator of modern existence . Dr. Robert Marion operates very much in this tradition . In his intriguing new book , &quot; Was George_Washington Really the Father of Our Country ? &quot; he attempts to retroactively diagnose possible genetic maladies in six key historical figures and to suggest how these diseases might have impacted upon Western history . Why , for instance , did England ' s King George_III suffer periodic bouts of seeming insanity , and how did this problem affect the outcome of the American_Revolution ? The monarch suffered from an inherited form of porphyria , Marion tells us , which caused episodes of unpredictable pain , irrationality and loss of function . But for these incapacities ( which can be traced both in the king ' s ancestors and royal descendants all_over Europe ) , would the Colonies have succeeded in achieving independence ? And here ' s a stunner : Napoleon , who late in life seems to have gained a lot of weight and developed what can only be described as breasts , may have indeed been motivated to conquer the world because of an inferiority_complex -- but not stemming from what most people think . Perhaps he spent too_much time alone as a child and maybe he was ashamed due_to what one researcher euphemistically terms &quot; organ inferiority. &quot; But what do you know ? He wasn ' t short ! It turns that an Austrian historian , not understanding that the_French of that time used a different standard of measuring height , got confused about the not-so-little general ' s size and the error has been glibly repeated to this day . Marion writes in a clear , conversational style that draws us in , and before we know it , even we English-major types are , against all odds , comprehending erudite scientific terms and theories . He educates , as do most fine teachers , by telling us a story that allows us to painlessly digest multisyllabic arcana -- in this case having to do with enzyme malfunction and genetic irregularity . In the process , we not only learn impressive anecdotes with which to regale our friends at the next neighborhood barbecue , but we finish his book -- don ' t be put_off by the unwieldy title -- feeling a bit smarter about all those biochemical terms that have long intimidated us . Yes , along the way Marion set us up for a_few too many red_herrings : After basically convincing us that Abraham_Lincoln looked as physically disjointed as he did because he had a joint-connection problem , Marion informs us that this probably wasn ' t the case . Lincoln was , apparently , simply gawky . But even the speculations that don ' t go anywhere definitive are interesting , because they illuminate the methodology and rationale of any attempted medical sleuthing , past or present . &quot; Having settled upon a diagnosis , &quot; Marion writes , &quot; the next question that must be asked is : What difference does any of this make ? . . . &quot; What really must be determined is whether the presence of the features of a particular genetic_disorder actually played any role in the formation of the character of the man who came_out of the Illinois wilderness in early 1860 as a virtually unknown lawyer and , on a platform that supported his inherent belief that slavery was morally and ethically wrong , was elected President of the United States. &quot; This issue is particularly relevant in the book ' s final section , which deals with John F . Kennedy . Marion persuasively argues that the very determination J.F.K. exhibited and honed early in his life in overcoming a serious physical ailment ( he had a spinal problem known as Addison ' s disease ) &quot; reinforced Jack_Kennedy ' s feeling that he was invincible , that he could accomplish any goal. &quot; In such accounts , Marion weds science and history into a compound that provokes thought even as it stimulates curiosity .</TEXT>
