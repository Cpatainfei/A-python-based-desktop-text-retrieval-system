   <HEADLINE> BY DESIGN ; HAT TRICKS ; ELISA BALLESTAS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE WOMEN WHO LOOKS GREAT IN ANY HAT . HER IDEAS CAN HELP OTHERS DO THE SAME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hats can be a sore subject . Every time designers declare that the &quot; hat is back , &quot; many of us groan and think how nice it would be to wear one well . Truth is , few women do . Bad examples abound -- witness the occasional attempts by First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . But women such_as Elisa Ballestas give us hope , as Jacqueline Kennedy in her pillbox and Audrey Hepburn in her wide-as-a-doorway chapeau once did . A hat lover for 30 years , since age 7 , Ballestas imported hats briefly several years ago from her native Colombia . Now , the Westlake Village resident is not a businesswoman but rather a student at Santa Monica College . While others think_of hats as superfluous and antiquated bits of costuming , she revolves her wardrobe around a collection of 60 or so boaters and berets , cloches and creased crown felts . Ballestas says she wears hats 80 % of the time , to weddings , funerals , bar_mitzvahs , church_services , horse_races , garden_parties -- even to class . Doing so gives her , and any other wearer , instant status , she says . &quot; People assume you ' re somebody . Cars even drive slower in the next lane. &quot; But even if she didn ' t turn heads , Ballestas would wear hats for the fun of it . &quot; Clothing has been so boring &quot; for the last few years , she says , but millinery is always changing . &quot; Designers like Eric Javits are making hats that are affordable and wearable. &quot; ( Other labels in her collection include Oscar de la Renta , Kokin , David Cohen and the local Ariane Millinery. ) In Ballestas ' mind , the only thing that doesn ' t pair well with a hat is timidity . &quot; You have to be more self-assured to wear a hat , &quot; she says . &quot; The moment you don ' t care what people think_about you is the moment you ' ve arrived. &quot; Where to Find a Good Hat * I . Magnin in Pasadena * Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills * Nordstrom in San Francisco or Topanga * Street fairs and art fairs</TEXT>
