   <HEADLINE> NOVELL TO BUY WORDPERFECT FOR $ 1.4 BILLION ; COMPUTERS : THE UNION WOULD CREATE A SOFTWARE POWERHOUSE COMBINING THE WORLD LEADER IN PC NETWORKING WITH THE DOMINANT FORCE IN WORD PROCESSING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In keeping with the software industry ' s urge to merge , heavyweight Novell Inc. agreed Monday to buy WordPerfect Corp. , its Utah neighbor and longtime ally , for $ 1.4 billion in_stock and options . The union would create a formidable software industry competitor combining the world leader in the booming personal_computer networking business with the dominant force in word_processing . Novell also announced that it has agreed to purchase the Quattro Pro spreadsheet business of troubled Borland International Corp . for $ 145 million , a deal that would enable Novell and WordPerfect to offer a leading spreadsheet with their other products . Software &quot; suites , &quot; in which a spreadsheet , word_processor and other applications are bundled into a coherent whole and sold together , are increasingly popular . Taken together , Novell ' s actions are in keeping with a trend in American businesses away from stand-alone , single-user personal_computer applications toward software_packages and group collaboration . &quot; Novell ' s objective is to accelerate this market transition , &quot; said Raymond J . Noorda , Novell ' s founder , president and chief_executive . Under the WordPerfect deal , shares of WordPerfect common_stock and options would be exchanged for about 59 million shares of Novell . WordPerfect would become a subsidiary of Novell and form the centerpiece of a new group focusing_on applications software , such_as word_processors . Novell , based in Provo , Utah , is the world leader in networking software , which ties computers together and allow users to share information . It also develops network services , computer operating systems and software to make programming easier . Privately held WordPerfect , based in Orem , develops applications . In the fiscal_year ended in October , Novell had sales of $ 1.12 billion . WordPerfect , for the year ended in December , posted revenue of about $ 700 million . Combined , the two companies would be well-situated to develop applications for customers and deliver them efficiently . In addition to word_processing , WordPerfect has developed programs relating to electronic documents , electronic_mail , the generation of forms and other uses . The deal thus would give Novell a chance to compete more broadly with Microsoft , an applications and operating system leader that is trying hard to penetrate Novell ' s networking business . &quot; This is a very natural partnership , a smart move for both companies , &quot; said Chuck Stegman , an office automation analyst with Dataquest , a market research company in San Jose . &quot; It creates a viable alternative to Microsoft for developing corporate applications. &quot; As pioneers in Utah ' s &quot; Software Valley , &quot; a stretch of hundreds of companies south of Salt_Lake_City , Novell and WordPerfect have long been friendly and have often teamed_up in recent years in efforts to develop computing standards . Four years ago , they briefly talked_about merging , but officials said then that the time was not right . Their unusual spirit of cooperation grows in large part from the region ' s close ties to the Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter-day_Saints . The two companies , about 10 minutes apart on Interstate 15 , jointly employ about 9 # 000 people , many of them Mormons . Heading the new application software_product group at Novell would be Adrian Rietveld , who on Jan . 1 became president and chief_executive of WordPerfect . He succeeded co-founder Alan C . Ashton . Rietveld would become the fourth member of Novell ' s office of the president , from which the company expects to choose a successor to the aging Noorda . In Nasdaq trading , Novell shares finished down 25 cents Monday at $ 23.75. Meanwhile , with the sale of Quattro Pro , Borland loses about 25 % of its business . The company , based in Scotts Valley , Calif. , said it expects to report a big decline in sales and a sizable operating loss for the quarter and year ending March 31 . It also said it will incur costs from a planned restructuring . The company also said its chief financial_officer , Alan Henricks , has resigned . Other high-profile mergers in the industry include the unions of Intuit and ChipSoft , makers of personal finance and tax preparation software , and Electronic Arts and Broderbund , makers of interactive games and educational products . Last week , Adobe Systems Inc. and Aldus Corp. , pioneers in the desktop_publishing market , announced plans to merge .</TEXT>
