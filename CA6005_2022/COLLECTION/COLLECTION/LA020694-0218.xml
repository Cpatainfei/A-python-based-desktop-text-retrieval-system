   <TEXT> &quot; I think I ' m a leading man in a bad_guy ' s body , &quot; jokes actor Michael Madsen , clearly aware of the tough-guy persona he ' s developed since he delivered the performance everybody remembers from Quentin Tarantino ' s critically acclaimed low-budget thriller , &quot; Reservoir Dogs. &quot; Madsen played Mr. Blonde , the cool killer who casually slices the ear off a bound and gagged police_officer while prancing around to Stealer ' s Wheel oddball ' 70s hit , &quot; Stuck in the Middle With You. &quot; It was a horrifyingly convincing performance , but the 35-year-old actor is determined to prove he can do other things than play the heavy . Toward that end , he took the role of sensitive dad Glen Greenwood in last year ' s surprise box-office hit , &quot; Free Willy , &quot; the story of a killer_whale and the troubled kid who befriends him . Madsen looked surprisingly at_home tossing a football with 12-year-old actor Jason James Richter , who played his foster son in the film , but it didn ' t take long for him to trade the football back in_for a gun . Madsen recently completed work_on Lawrence Kasdan ' s &quot; Wyatt Earp , &quot; a Western epic slated for release on July 4 , which finds him cast as Wyatt ' s older brother Virgil ( Kevin Costner has the lead in the film ) . Madsen is also prominently featured in Roger Donaldson ' s &quot; The Getaway , &quot; which opens Friday . &quot; The Getaway &quot; is a remake of the 1972 Sam Peckinpah chase picture that starred Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw , which was based on a book by pulp novelist Jim Thompson . Donaldson ' s version features Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger as lovers on the run from the law as they struggle to extricate themselves from a life of crime . Madsen turns_up here as Rudy , a sociopathic killer who pulls a heist with the couple , then proceeds to double-cross everybody within firing distance . So ferocious is his performance that Madsen is going_to need to do some major back-peddling in_order to persuade anybody he ' s not the most dangerous actor in Hollywood . * Meeting with Madsen at a Beverly Hills restaurant , one encounters a man who both lives up_to his reputation as a ruffian , yet is unexpectedly cordial and accessible . Dressed in motorcycle boots and a leather jacket , he has a_few beers and several cigarettes for lunch , and talks in a hoarse whisper that ' s vintage Brando . A few minutes are spent discussing the finer points of tattoos -- Madsen has several quite beautiful ones , including the Harley-Davidson logo on one biceps , and his wife ' s name ( Jeannine ) on the other -- and when the conversation drifts to literature Madsen remains perfectly in character and names Charles Bukowski as his favorite author . When one points_out that guns have figured prominently in most of his films and asks if he owns any himself , he says , &quot; Sure , I have a_few guns -- I ' ve used them , too , because I ' ve been in life-threatening situations . There ' s a lot of bad men out there. &quot; Yeah , Madsen ' s been around the block , but he ' s not 100 % muscle . &quot; I ' m shy , &quot; he confesses , &quot; and I ' m not the kind of guy who wants to be at a party with a lot of people because I prefer being an observer to being a participant . I ' ve always been a loner , &quot; he adds . &quot; We could sit here and talk for hours and you could leave knowing absolutely nothing about me. &quot; It ' s hard to say exactly what Madsen might be hiding , but some who ' ve succeeded in penetrating whatever defenses he has erected around himself insist he ' s one of the nicest guys in the business . &quot; Michael ' s quite sentimental but he doesn ' t want people to know that , and I find that a very endearing thing about him , &quot; says &quot; Wyatt Earp &quot; director Lawrence Kasdan . &quot; He ' s a tough_guy with a soft heart , and he and I connected immediately. &quot; Baldwin concurs : &quot; Michael ' s a very special guy , and I grew to love him over the course of making ' The Getaway ' -- he ' s absolutely amazing in the film too . To play the part of Rudy you have to be able to convey that you ' re really capable of hurting somebody , and Michael can do that with next to no effort . &quot; It ' s kind of a shame he ' s such a convincing bad_guy because he ' s capable of doing a lot of different things , and Hollywood rarely lets an actor break_out of the typecasting that gets laid on them , &quot; Baldwin adds . &quot; Hollywood isn ' t the greatest place in the world to have a career that revolves_around self-expression , and I think Michael should make some money , then go_back to Chicago and do a play . I ' d love to see him on stage -- he ' d probably be one of the greatest actors we ' ve seen , because he ' s just the right amount of crazy. &quot; * It was in Chicago , in fact , that Madsen ' s crazy quotient began percolating . Born there in 1958 , the middle of three children ( actress Virginia Madsen is his younger sister ) , Madsen recalls being attracted to movies , and to extremes of human experience , from a young age . &quot; My childhood was chaotic and diversified , &quot; Madsen flatly declares . &quot; My parents split_up when I was 9 and after that we never lived_in the same place for more_than a year because we didn ' t have much money and my mother had to work two jobs ( Madsen ' s mother is a writer and producer who currently lives in Los Angeles ) . I suppose I was a juvenile_delinquent , and that was probably because I was always the new kid in school coming_in at the middle of the year , so I tended to hang_out with the outsiders , underdogs and losers . They were more interesting to me and I never fit_in with the privileged-people scene , so I wound_up getting_in trouble . &quot; My mother introduced me to Kerouac , Henry Miller , Hemingway and Van Gogh , and my father , who was a Chicago fireman for 30 years , introduced me to people who were burned alive and run_over by trains . My father ' s work exposed me to a very violent aspect of life , and maybe that ' s where I first got a taste for danger . I remember jumping_off roofs and getting_into fights from a very young age , so it ' s hard to say exactly where that came from . &quot; When I wasn ' t outside tearing_up in the neighborhood , I was home watching old movies on TV , &quot; he continues . &quot; I was a big Humphrey Bogart fan when I was little , and I also remember being totally knocked_out by this Robert Mitchum movie , ' Heaven Knows , Mr. Allison. ' Kirk Douglas ' film ' Lonely Are the Brave ' was also a big favorite of mine -- it was those two films that got me thinking acting might be something I was interested in doing. &quot; * The films Madsen admired as a child left an imprint on him that is clearly apparent to those who have followed his work . In fact , it was Madsen ' s evocation of an acting style that dominated American movies in the ' 40s and ' 50s that led Tarantino to cast him in &quot; Reservoir Dogs. &quot; &quot; Michael ' s a throwback to a breed of actor that includes people like Robert Mitchum , Aldo Ray and Lee Marvin , &quot; says Tarantino . &quot; Many actors of that generation had been in World_War_II and they ' d seen life , and most actors today can ' t fill their shoes -- Harvey Keitel , Sean Penn and Larry Fishburne are the only ones I can think_of who have that kind of weight , and Michael has it in spades . &quot; Michael has all these weird mannerisms , &quot; he adds , &quot; and in the process of making ' Reservoir Dogs ' I just fell_in_love with them . In the course of a short conversation he ' ll pick_at his thumb , then he ' ll rub his eyebrow , bring his finger down his nose and drag it across his lip , then he ' ll stick his finger in his ear and scratch his neck . It ' s classic Method actor stuff , but having gotten_to know Michael I can tell you these aren ' t affectations -- this is genuinely who he is. &quot; Though Madsen was enchanted by movies from an early age , it wasn ' t until he was 20 that he began to seriously pursue acting . &quot; I was working as an auto mechanic and I went_with a friend to meet some girls at the Steppenwolf Theater , &quot; says Madsen , who was considering becoming a cop at the time . &quot; The girls stood us up , but I saw ' Of Mice and Men ' with John Malkovich , and wound_up taking a scene study class with him for a_few months -- I didn ' t get the idea of studying acting , though . I figured if you can do_it , then you do_it , and if you can ' t , then you don ' t. &quot; Madsen may have been indifferent to acting classes but he was excited by the work itself , and in 1983 he landed a small part in &quot; War_Games &quot; that brought him to L.A. &quot; When I first got here I didn ' t know anyone in L.A. , I worked in a gas_station in Beverly Hills for nine months , and was living_in an apartment at Western and Franklin , &quot; recalls Madsen . &quot; I had a ' 65 Cadillac with a smashed door that I drove_around town in , and I spent most of my time chasing girls , auditioning for parts , working_on my motorcycle and meeting people . &quot; I was very idealistic about the life of an actor then , but that changed dramatically because my idealism was subjected_to a major reality check early on , &quot; he continues . &quot; What happened was , I ' d done a pilot for a TV series based on Barry Levinson ' s film ' Diner ' -- I was cast as Boogie , the character played by Mickey Rourke in the film -- and that led to a small part in Levinson ' s next film , ' The Natural. ' I was 23 at the time and had a_couple_of big scenes with Robert Redford that I think I handled pretty well , but when the film came_out and I went_to see it I ' d been completely cut . Nobody had the dignity , honesty or respect_to let me know , and in the long_run that was a good thing because it was a slap in the face that wised me up fast to what this business is really like. &quot; * Bloodied but unbowed , Madsen pressed_on , briefly marrying in his mid-20s ( to Cher ' s sister , Georganne LaPiere ) , and landing small parts in more_than a dozen films that prepped him for the second lead in John Dahl ' s 1989 film , &quot; Kill Me Again. &quot; Cast as a psychotic killer , Madsen was allowed to stretch_out and really show what he could do onscreen for the first time -- and the main thing he proved was that he could more_than hold his own in a milieu of cinematic violence . It was this performance that led Tarantino to cast him in &quot; Reservoir Dogs , &quot; a film that ' s been taken_to task by many for its over-the-top violence . &quot; Yes , ' Reservoir Dogs ' is violent , but it ' s a subliminal film and you have to look below its surface , &quot; Madsen points_out . &quot; It ' s actually a film about men trusting each other and the price they pay_for doing that , and the violence is simply a catalyst for getting_into this theme . You couldn ' t have this bunch of men dancing together to ' The Nutcracker , ' because when we stopped dancing , who ' d give_a_damn what we said to each other ? Everybody responds to violence because it ' s a very real part of life . I ' ve seen a lot of violence in my life and it ' s not something I have to pretend to know about , because I ' ve been in_trouble in my life . &quot; Performing in a violent film does take a toll on your psyche , &quot; he admits , &quot; and that ' s easy to forget when you ' re working because it has a cumulative effect . It sinks progressively deeper into you as you ' re making the picture , then when it ' s over you suddenly find yourself with a weird personality you can ' t get_rid_of for a while . &quot; At first I didn ' t want to do ' The Getaway ' because the ' Reservoir Dogs ' thing was hanging_on me and I didn ' t want to play any heavies for a while , but ultimately I couldn ' t resist , &quot; he says of the role of Rudy , which was played by Al Lettieri in the Peckinpah original . &quot; It ' s fun to play a character like this because it ' s a part that has no boundaries , and the crazier you are the better . I don ' t think it ' s ever a good idea to play a character with just one color , though , so I tried to bring a lighter_touch to Rudy . If you ' re gonna play somebody really demonic you ' ve got_to have some humor. &quot; The most ingenious bit of shading Madsen brings_to the part is the fact that he cradles a kitten in his arms in several scenes -- a kitten who purrs contentedly , and appears to be in heaven lounging_about on the chest of the psychopathic Rudy . &quot; The cat is a great detail for the character , &quot; says director Roger Donaldson , &quot; but it also created difficulties because it ' s hard to act when you ' re worrying about which way a cat is looking . There were several great takes that didn ' t make the movie because the cat is looking in the wrong direction -- luckily the cat really took_to Michael and was prepared to sit there for long periods. &quot; The cat -- who goes_by the name &quot; Kitty &quot; in the film -- does add a perverse bit of whimsy to Madsen ' s character , but his performance is nonetheless savage and disturbing . That may be why one senses a trace of relief in Madsen ' s voice when he reports that Kasdan ' s &quot; Wyatt Earp &quot; &quot; isn ' t a violent film -- it ' s a historically accurate account of 30 years in the lives of the Earp brothers . There ' s killing , sure , because killing was part of the world these men lived_in , but it ' s not like ' Rambo ' killing . It ' s a film about the Old West , which was a hard place to live -- just like L.A. now , &quot; he laughs . &quot; I wish I had a_couple_of brothers like the Earps. &quot; * When he ' s in L.A. between jobs , Madsen says he pretty much keeps to himself . Currently separated from his second wife , Jeannine Bisignano , with whom he has a 4-year-old son , Christian , Madsen says that the worst thing about an acting career is that &quot; it makes_it impossible to have a stable personal life because other people find it hard to be comfortably involved in your lifestyle . I ' m happy when I ' m working_on a film , but whenever I return from a location the neat little package I ' d tied my life up into when I left has come undone . You always come_home to a big mess , so I tend to go_into a cocoon when I ' m not working and just want to sleep all_the time . &quot; I don ' t know if I ' ve resigned myself to the fact that I ' ll always have a chaotic personal life as long as I ' m an actor , but it seems like I can ' t get_away from that , because I ' ve tried . I ' m not frivolous and it ' s not like ' This ain ' t working_out , so screw you , baby ' -- I ' ve tried to hang_in there and do the right thing , but sometimes you don ' t get much cooperation . &quot; When you do this kind of work , a lot of people throw themselves at you and that ' s why I ' m glad it took a while for whatever success I ' m having to come_to me , &quot; he concludes . &quot; If all this had happened when I was 22 I probably would ' ve gotten_into some bad trouble. &quot; When one points_out that it ' s never too late for that , Madsen laughs and says &quot; yeah , I know -- I ' m in_trouble right now. &quot;</TEXT>
