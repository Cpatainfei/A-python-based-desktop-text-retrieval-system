   <HEADLINE> LENNONGRAD , BACK IN WHAT USED TO BE THE U.S.S.R.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One night three years ago , Kolya Vasin dreamed of a great temple . It might have come from playing the John Lennon classic &quot; Imagine &quot; one too many hundred times . Or from the revelry he and his Bohemian crowd here had arranged that evening to honor Lennon ' s 50th birthday . When Vasin awoke , he quickly painted_a_picture of the vision he had seen in his sleep . On the shores of the Gulf of Finland , a giant temple would rise , 70 yards high , its irregular stone crags broken only by two great spheres , a yellow one reading &quot; All You Need Is Love &quot; and a blue one reading &quot; Give Peace a Chance. &quot; A yellow submarine would float nearby . It would be a shrine to rock ' n ' roll -- the John Lennon Rock ' n ' Roll Temple . &quot; Russia and the whole world need such a temple , &quot; Vasin said , sitting at a broad table graced by a ceramic model of the temple the size of a large turkey . &quot; This temple will say to people : Stop , stop being ugly , stop being sad . Be happy , because life is short , &quot; he said . &quot; It will be a spiritual revolution on the cusp of the 20th Century. &quot; When the inspiring power of the Beatles mixes with the Russian predilection for mysticism , a potent combination results . &quot; ' Imagine ' is the proto-image for the temple , &quot; said Vasin , a heavily bearded , comfy man with slightly off-center , merry eyes . &quot; ' Imagine all_the people living for today. ' Well , I did . I imagined . The result is the temple. &quot; Vasin , an artist known as one of Russia ' s most ardent and knowledgeable Beatles fan -- he prefers the term &quot; Beatles-ologist &quot; -- now devotes his life to promoting the idea of the temple . He sends letters to rock_stars , fan clubs and foundations . His friends have formed a committee to help . He has attracted a smattering of media attention . He produces T-shirts and heart-shaped coffee_cups bearing the temple ' s logo , a peace symbol shaped like a heart , and reading , &quot; All you need is love . John Lennon Rock ' n ' Roll Temple &quot; in Russian and English . He figures he needs $ 10 million to build the structure . He may raise that sum . But the very quest to build the shrine serves as the natural culmination of a life devoted to and possessed by the Beatles . In a testament to the power of Western pop culture and its ability to defeat totalitarian attempts at controlling it , Vasin , now 48 , first heard rock_music on what was called &quot; Rock on Ribs. &quot; These were underground LPs recorded on the plastic from X-ray plates , back when the puritanical Communist_Party frowned_on rock and jazz as corrupting influences . Vasin hated the restrictions and falsity of Soviet life . St . Petersburg -- then Leningrad -- was long known as the Soviet city with the richest underground rock_music scene . Vasin first heard the Beatles in 1964 . &quot; I listened and listened to the Beatles and suddenly there was an epiphany -- an ' Oh , yeah ! ' . . . I ' d never experienced that before and it remains to this day , &quot; he said . It is a deeply Russian trait not to do things by halves . When Vasin fell , he fell . Now , he says , &quot; John Lennon is Jesus_Christ to me , only with a guitar . &quot; I was a stupid little boy , and the Beatles opened_up the world to me , &quot; he said . &quot; I owe them my peace , my work . Everything good that I have done_in my life I connect with them -- and my mother , of course . &quot; John opened_up this world for me and I worry about everything being good , &quot; he said . &quot; If I read about a killing or ugliness , I feel bad . In order not to feel bad , I have to build the temple to be nearer to eternity or God. &quot; Vasin wants to build the shrine in St . Petersburg , in Russia , for a very simple reason : &quot; Because I live here -- I love this country , I have a bunch of friends here. &quot; But the literature he has been sending adds another explanation : St . Petersburg has always been known as Russia ' s Window on Europe , and now he wants to make_it a Door to the World . St . Petersburg would have been an even more appropriate setting , if Vasin had succeeded in convincing city officials to rename the city from Leningrad , its Soviet-era title , to Lennongrad . He also tried_for a Lennon Street with no success . The temple , as Vasin describes it , would be_full of different kinds of music , from organ to blues to a cappella , bells and basic rock ' n ' roll . Inside , he said , &quot; would be a non-stop party for all humanity , &quot; with nothing forbidden , everything dominated by good cosmic vibrations . Everyone welcome . He has already printed a list of special temple holidays , which would include Rock Woman Day on Jan . 19 ( Janis Joplin ' s birthday ) ; Black Glasses Day on April 23 ( Roy Orbison ' s birthday ) ; Back in the U.S.S.R. Song Day on Oct . 21 ( for the day the Beatles ' White Album came_out ) ; and the calendar ' s centerpiece , John Lennon ' s birthday on Oct . 9 . Though still ensconced in his first-floor office at 10 Pushkinskaya St. , an abandoned building occupied by artists , Vasin is already inducting willing Lennon fans into the temple ' s future congregation . The ceremony goes something like this : &quot; Assume the position of Rock ' n ' Roll , &quot; Vasin barked to a recent inductee , indicating he should point his toes inward in a pigeon-toed , knock-kneed , Elvis-like stance . &quot; Now make an idiotic face , and accept from me a dose of rock ' n ' roll ! &quot; It was actually a tablespoon of herb-brewed vodka . &quot; Because rock ' n ' roll is bliss and bliss is the tributary of paradise ! &quot; Vasin then rapped the unsuspecting inductee over the head with the vodka spoon , which hangs from the office ceiling . &quot; Get_into the groove ! &quot; After the inductee ' s shock passed , Vasin intoned the final imprecation : &quot; Remember John , love , and me , an old sinner. &quot;</TEXT>
