   <HEADLINE> MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ : GOING FOR THE GOLD ; ADVERTISERS RACE TO SIGN OLYMPIC MEDALISTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Don ' t look_at it as the end of the Olympic Games . Think_of it as the beginning of an even more high-stakes competition : the Endorsement Games . Several top American medal_winners from the Winter_Olympics -- most notably Nancy Kerrigan and Dan Jansen -- are already well into the process of what few before them have accomplished to any great extent : cashing_in . On Monday , Revlon announced a multiyear endorsement contract with Kerrigan , estimated to be worth nearly $ 2 million . Late last week , Jansen and skater Bonnie Blair were both snatched by AT &amp; T to tout its long-distance service in television spots . Even without a gold medal dangling from her neck , sports marketers say , silver medalist Kerrigan -- who already has Disney , Reebok and Campbell Soup under her belt -- may soon line_up annual endorsements exceeding $ 10 million . Speedskater Jansen is expected to rack_up about $ 3 million in sponsorship fees . Blair , who has gathered more Olympic medals than any American woman in history , could amass $ 2 million in product endorsements . And even Tommy Moe , a little-known skier who sped off with two medals , could pocket $ 1 million . &quot; We ' re in uncharted territory , &quot; said Arthur Kaminsky , president of the New York-based sports marketing firm Athletes &amp; Artists . &quot; From a marketing standpoint , no Olympics has ever had ratings or consumer interest like this. &quot; But two little-known American gold medal_winners are not generally viewed by sports marketers as likely product endorsement candidates : Cathy Turner , who won gold for her short-track skating but was disqualified by officials from a second short-track event , and Diann Roffe-Steinrotter , who won the women ' s super giant slalom but who sports marketers say lacks the charisma for most major corporate sponsors . Tonya Harding , perhaps the most closely watched athlete of the Olympics -- who finished eighth in the women ' s figure_skating competition -- has already cashed_in by selling exclusive interviews to tabloid TV_shows . She is not , however , expected to land big endorsement deals . But not for lack of trying . Harding ' s representatives recently contacted No Excuses jeans , a company that built its image by using provocative women in its ads , including Donna Rice and Marla Maples . &quot; At this point , we have no plans to use her , &quot; said Dari Marder , vice_president of marketing at No Excuses . &quot; We want somebody a little more universally liked. &quot; Despite paying Harding $ 25 # 000 to help with her Olympic-related finances , Nike officials said Monday that she will have no endorsement career with the company . &quot; It ' s not in the cards , &quot; Nike spokesman Keith Peters said . So unusual was this Winter_Olympics that for the first time ever , an American athlete who didn ' t win a gold medal -- Kerrigan -- is still expected to race off with what could be the all-time endorsement gold . This despite the fact that Kerrigan may have taken some luster off her own shining image by skipping the Olympic closing ceremonies Sunday for a commercial venture to Disney World and then publicly complaining that she should have won the gold medal . &quot; Nancy Kerrigan will be the only American in Olympic history to cash_in_on the silver medal , &quot; said Andrew Woolf , chairman of the Beverly Hills-based sports marketing firm World Class Sports . &quot; In her case , silver is virtually as_good_as gold. &quot; Just ask Revlon , which inked its contract with Kerrigan shortly after her silver medal routine Friday night . &quot; If she had been shut_out from the medals , we would have still signed her , &quot; a Revlon spokesman on Monday said . Revlon will air its first Kerrigan TV spot during the Academy Awards on March 21 . The ads are scheduled to be filmed this week . For Kerrigan , endorsements clearly took precedence over the Olympic closing ceremonies . She skipped the event Sunday , instead flying with her family to Orlando , where she joined Mickey_Mouse to lead a parade down Main_Street . A Disney TV spot featuring her -- filmed before the Olympics -- began airing Saturday , the night after Kerrigan won the silver medal . Disney announced its contract with Kerrigan after the Winter Games began . Among other things , the deal -- estimated at nearly $ 2 million -- includes a made-for-TV film about her life . &quot; The sky is the limit for Nancy Kerrigan , &quot; Kaminsky said . &quot; I don ' t know of a single athlete who has ever received so_much positive publicity in such a short time -- for free. &quot; Many of the top athletes began lobbying marketers months before the Games began . Jansen ' s marketing team , for example , sent brochures with background information on the speed skater to all_the Olympic sponsors and to dozens of potential sponsors . &quot; We primed the pump that he ' d be skating for the gold , &quot; said Frank Vuono , president of Integrated Sports International , which represents Jansen . A letter boasting of Jansen ' s victory was prepared &quot; and kept_in the ready &quot; before both the 500-meter and 1 # 000-meter speed_skating events , Vuono said . After Jansen won the gold medal in the 1 # 000-meter race , the marketing firm sent the letters to the companies by fax . AT &amp; T responded quickly . An ad featuring Jansen and Blair making long-distance_calls back home is scheduled to air during tonight ' s Grammy Awards telecast . And Jansen is also being besieged for the motivational speakers circuit , where executives say he will pull_in up_to $ 15 # 000 per speech . Insurance giant John Hancock has never asked Jansen to speak_to its executives . But since Jansen won the gold medal , it has already booked him for two appearances . &quot; We tend to go_for people who have been medalists , &quot; said Ralph Brunner , spokesman at John Hancock Financial Services . &quot; It happens to be the vehicle that makes people more widely recognized. &quot; Marc Reede , who books speeches for athletes , has set several corporate speaking dates for Jansen . &quot; Everyone wants their sales teams to never take no for an answer . Dan Jansen ' s career epitomizes that , &quot; said Reede , president of Beverly Hills-based Nationwide Speakers Bureau . Blair ' s agent declined to estimate how much his client might make in endorsement fees . But &quot; from a marketing standpoint , we ' ll do better than in any previous Olympics , &quot; said Parkes Brittain , vice_president at Washington-based Advantage International . Blair already has several top sponsors , including Kellogg , Jeep and Evian . Downhill skier Moe , who won a gold medal and a silver , expects some fat financial rewards from his performance . &quot; No doubt his price has gone_up since he won the gold medal , &quot; said Todd Schlopy , president of Park City , Utah-based Action Sports Management , which has represented Moe for years . &quot; But we ' re not going_to turn our backs on people who got him where he is. &quot; Moe currently has a handful of ski equipment endorsement contracts that expire in April . Schlopy said Moe intentionally held_off from extending the contracts before the Games , hoping he ' d win an Olympic medal . As a result , Moe ' s endorsement income , said Schlopy , &quot; will probably triple. &quot; Briefly . . . The Santa Monica ad_agency Rubin Postaer &amp; Associates has parted_with its $ 8-million account_for Miller ' s Outpost . . . . The Los Angeles agency Cohen / Johnson has picked_up a client it formerly handled , the $ 8-million ad business for Chi-Chi ' s restaurants . . . . After complaints and a threatened boycott from citizens of Todi , Italy , Visa has pulled a TV spot in which two tourists unwittingly trade their camera for a donkey . . . . Buena Vista Home Video has contacted a number of Southern California agencies about its estimated $ 3-million creative account . . . . Los Angeles ad veteran Craig Campbell , whose agency Campbell &amp; Wagman closed earlier this year , has been named chief_executive of the Los Angeles office of the ad_agency EvansGroup . . . . Brentwood agency Stein Robaire Helm has lost the estimated $ 1-million account_for Teva Sport Sandals , which the Carpinteria-based firm moved in-house . . . . L.A. Gear , the sneaker maker whose ad account has been with the Los Angeles office of Ogilvy &amp; Mather for less than six months , is holding discussions with other agencies . . . . Reebok is reportedly unhappy with its highly paid top endorser and basketball star Shaquille O ' Neal . Olympic Endorsement Gold The Winter_Olympics are over , but the competition for commercial gold is just heating_up . Four American medal winners--Nancy Kerrigan , Dan Jansen , Bonnie Blair and Tommy Moe--are considered bona_fide contenders for lucrative endorsement contracts . Here are the companies that have them under contract as product endorsers , as well as potential suitors . 03 # 16 , 33 # 24 Athlete Current sponsors Potential sponsors Nancy Kerrigan Reebok , Campbell Soup , Disney , Soft drink , fashion , Revlon , Seiko , Xerox apparel Dan Jansen NFL Properties , AT &amp; T , Apex-One , Insurance , computer , Miller Brewing , Kellogg financial Bonnie Blair Jeep , Rollerblade , AT &amp; T , Xerox , Soft drink , high-tech , Evian , Kellogg , banking National Frozen Food Assn .
