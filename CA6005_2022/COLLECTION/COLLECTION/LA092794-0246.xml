   <HEADLINE> EARLIER INTERVENTION HOLDS LESSONS FOR U.S. IN HAITI ; OCCUPATION : PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS DIDN ' T LAST . ILL WILL CREATED BY RACISM THEN COULD SNARL RELATIONS NOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With their flags rippling and Springfield rifles held high , 330 Marines and sailors splashed through the tepid surf near Port-au-Prince on a mission to save Haiti from the Haitians . It was 1915 , and the country ' s ruler had been dismembered by a mob in a burst of anarchy that President Woodrow Wilson considered a threat to America ' s sea_lanes and investors . Wilson declared the turmoil &quot; a public nuisance on our doorstep , &quot; and called_for a swift restoration of order . Nineteen years later , the American diplomats and dogfaces were still there . And they had met with disagreeable surprises : sullen resistance from the political class ; angry divisions among Haitians , and sporadic rebellion that ultimately made the occupation an embarrassment in the eyes of many at_home and abroad . When it was all_over , the Americans ' proud improvements -- from government_offices to bridges , hospitals , sewers and roads -- were quickly lost to neglect and advancing tropical undergrowth . That occupation differs in its motive and execution from the one begun last week to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . But as newly deployed U.S. troops contemplate their still hazily defined mission , the episode offers a cautionary lesson of the difficulties of one country imposing its will on a land so troubled , so poor and -- quite simply -- so different . The history points_up the risks Americans face as they try to pacify a country that has been riven for two centuries by factional fighting and where American intentions are viewed with suspicion -- even , it is increasingly clear , by Aristide himself . And in its outcome , the first occupation raises questions of the lasting value of the current mission , in which the United States has already committed nearly $ 1 billion . As they have recently found in places like Rwanda , Somalia and Iraq , American forces must find their way through the deep-dyed loyalties , long hatreds and inexplicable twists of local history to carry_out their mission . To outsiders , Haiti ' s history is as impenetrable as any . The nation was born violently in the struggle of African slaves to throw_off their colonial French masters ; the two centuries since have seen a rarely interrupted clash of the tiny mixed-race upper_class and their military retainers with the impoverished remainder of the population . And the occupiers ' efforts to deal with the situation may be further snarled by poisonous memories of the bitter encounter of the 1920s when the Americans -- whose country was then gripped in a period of fevered racism -- considered Haitians little more_than animals and never hesitated to say so . One of President Clinton ' s allies , Sen . Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) , cited history ' s lesson last week as he delivered his own negative judgment on the prospect of an invasion . &quot; When we were there last time , Woodrow Wilson got us in and Franklin_Roosevelt got us out , &quot; Moynihan said . &quot; Nineteen years. &quot; America ' s first intervention came at a time when Caribbean incursions by the United States were regular and rarely accompanied by public_debate or even much notice . In Haiti ' s case , it seemed to Wilson there was more_than sufficient justification for military_action , on grounds of military security and economic interests . The Germans , one year into war in Europe , seemed about to strike a deal to build a naval base in Haiti that could directly threaten the American lifeline through the Panama_Canal . And the latest sudden change in government -- the 102nd in 75 years -- raised Wilson ' s fears that Haiti ' s debts would go unpaid and that some European power might step_in to collect them . Vilbron Guillaume Sam , the latest Haitian military chieftain , had killed 165 political opponents before he was seized from the_French Legation and torn limb from limb by the mob . The American charge d ' affaires witnessed a man parading by with Sam ' s severed thumb in his mouth as a fevered procession bore Sam ' s remains through the capital . The Marine landing subsequently ordered by Wilson was accompanied by only two American casualties -- both , it was later concluded , from self-inflicted wounds . There were few Haitian casualties and initial resistance by guerrilla bands in the mountains was snuffed_out within six months . As today , many average Haitians welcomed the incursion . But for many , those feelings didn ' t last . The Haitian National Assembly soon proved stubbornly resistant to U.S. demands , refusing to ratify a new , American-written constitution that would have validated the occupation and permitted American ownership of property . So the Americans took another route : They pressured their newly installed Haitian president to sign an order dissolving the legislature , then had Marine Lt . Col . Smedley D . Butler read the proclamation in a public_square . Rather than risk the election of a new legislature that might also prove too independent , they organized a plebiscite to ratify the creation of a new governing body . Only about 5 % of the Haitians showed_up to cast ballots beneath the stony gaze of Marine guards ; perhaps not surprisingly , they voted overwhelmingly for the American-sponsored proposal . Fearing results they might not like , the Americans didn ' t allow national elections until 1930 . And they invalidated the results of local elections that were not to their liking . Martial law , imposed with the invasion , was maintained for a decade . The Americans censored the press and jailed editors who broke the rules ; they forced Haitians to accept a bilateral treaty that empowered Americans to collect taxes , pay debts and oversee local_governments . Marine officers were appointed to supervise government in local districts . All this helped to quickly crystallize the discontent of the French-speaking , mixed-race ruling_class , which represented about 5 % of Haitians . That resentment was only reinforced by the personal treatment they got from Americans who considered them a lower order than the ruling_classes of the Spanish-speaking territories they occupied in the Caribbean and the Pacific . The Americans would n ' t mix socially with them , and even in public statements referred to them in the most contemptuous terms . Adm . William Caperton , the naval commander in Haiti when the 1915 crisis began , described President Sam as &quot; a very gorgeous black gentleman , arrayed like a head bellhop at the Waldorf. &quot; &quot; These are a proud people , and they resented it very much , &quot; said Richard A . Best , a defense analyst at the Congressional Research Service . The Americans -- including Wilson , the famous evangelist for democracy -- never believed the Haitians capable of self-government and made no effort to build U.S.-style democratic institutions in the country . But the Americans did make a considerable effort to maintain order . From 1918 to 1920 , the Marine Brigade and the local constabulary they had organized , the Gendarmerie d ' Haiti , fought throughout the countryside to subdue cacos , guerrilla bands that took refuge in the mountains . ( Cacos is variously translated as a predatory bird or angry red ant. ) The Americans were largely successful in the campaign , which cost the lives of 15 Marines and an estimated 2 # 000 cacos . But it required that the Marines -- who never numbered more_than about 2 # 500 -- maintain regular patrols , pay bounties for weapons and sometimes eliminate rebel leaders . One spur to popular discontent was a system of forced labor , the corvee , under which Haitians were pressed into service for several days shoveling earth and cracking boulders to build 800 miles of unpaved roads . The system , transplanted from France , was based on a notion that even citizens too poor to pay taxes owed some contribution to the state . The corvee camps initially had some popularity with some rural Haitians because workers were fed , sheltered and even entertained , wrote Robert and Nancy Heinl in their 1978 Haitian history , &quot; Written in Blood. &quot; But that attitude faded , particularly as some better-educated city dwellers were caught in the corvee ' s net . Soon it had become a source of widespread resentment and the basis of a popular conception that &quot; the whites are come hither to restore slavery ; the corvee is only the beginning , &quot; according to the Heinls ' book . When the outside world saw pictures of rope-bound road_gangs , there was an outcry against this seeming restoration of slavery in the onetime French slave colony . But by the time corvee was abolished by the Marine command in 1918 , it was too late to erase its popular significance . Still , like most U.S. interventions of the time , the Marines ' actions in Haiti drew little public notice in the United States . One exception was in 1922 , when charges of American atrocities in the campaign to put_down the cacos led Congress to hold hearings . In a committee report , Congress concluded that most abuses had occurred in the battle to put_down the insurrection . But it acknowledged that there were at least 10 illegal executions by Americans . A second round of hearings came_after 1929 riots , led by student demonstrators , in the provincial city of Les Cayes . The beginning of the Great Depression had driven down prices for Haitian coffee and other farm products , causing hardship and raising complaints about the stewardship of a government that included no real Haitian voice . Twelve Haitians died in the disorder , hastening a shift in U.S. public_opinion that , amid deepening domestic problems , was already turning against such foreign commitments . On a presidential commission ' s advice , the Herbert Hoover Administration took halfway steps to greater home_rule ; some Haitians were added_to the government . Even so , the Hoover Administration found it difficult to fully withdraw because of concern that the country would not remain stable and solvent . Not until 1934 did Americans finally leave Haiti -- and even then , they left_behind a financial monitor to ensure that the debt payments would continue . By some measures , the occupation had benefited Haitians . Haiti was financially stable , foreign debts were paid , political violence was largely contained and Haitians were more secure than before . By all accounts , the Haitians ' treasury was not plundered by its American stewards . The Americans had help set_up a Haitian-funded health service of 153 rural clinics and 11 hospitals , supervised by Navy doctors . Yet with the Americans ' departure , the fruits of this labor fell_into immediate disuse . Robert White , a former U.S. ambassador in Latin_America , believes most comparisons of the two occupations are misleading , because the current mission has the support of most Haitians . Even so , he acknowledges that such an undertaking is likely to meet serious obstacles . &quot; Any time you have a military and an elite that regard democracy as a threat , there will be grave difficulties. &quot; And , as in earlier decades , there is a risk that the Americans will alienate the Haitian leadership , even as they try to bring democracy . While the Clinton_Administration has pledged to strictly limit the American role , &quot; when you come_in like this , it is almost guaranteed that you won ' t be loved , &quot; said Gaddis Smith , professor of diplomatic history at Yale_University . With Washington ' s agreement with the Haitian junta , the U.S. military seems to face a declining risk of having to fight organized guerrilla warfare from the mountains . But , as occurred with the Marines in the Les Cayes riot of 1929 , they could find themselves in the midst of bloody civil clashes . This already happened last Tuesday , when Aristide supporters battled the Haitian military in Port-au-Prince as U.S. troops watched . It happened again over the weekend in Cap Haitien , where U.S. Marines got_into a gun battle in which 10 Haitians were killed ; emboldened by the Saturday firefight , thousands of Haitians on Sunday ransacked police facilities in the city . U.S. military officials have acknowledged that being forced to disentangle combatants is one of the roles they fear most . As in the earlier occupation , the United States may find it takes far longer than Washington had hoped for Haiti to reach a point when outside forces can leave without the risk of a reversion to the old ways . &quot; When you get involved like this , there ' s simply no guarantee that you ' ll be able to leave when you want to , &quot; said Hugh DeSantis , a defense specialist at the National War College . &quot; The bottom_line is , there ' s no guarantee that because you have democratic ideals , the people you support are going_to put them into practice. &quot;</TEXT>
