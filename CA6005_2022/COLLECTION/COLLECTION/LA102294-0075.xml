   <HEADLINE> CLINTON WILL VISIT SYRIA TO PUSH PEACE ; MIDEAST : THE PRESIDENT WILL STOP IN DAMASCUS DURING A THREE-DAY TRIP IN WHICH HE WILL WITNESS THE SIGNING OF AN ISRAEL-JORDAN TREATY . HE SAYS TERRORISM WILL NOT DETER HIM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton said Friday that he will visit Damascus next week to prod President Hafez Assad to move faster in peace negotiations with Israel , despite Syria ' s generation-long links to international terrorism . The President plans to stop in the Syrian capital as part of a hectic three-day tour of the Middle_East to celebrate the signing of the Israel-Jordan peace_treaty ending almost half a century of animosity . He also plans to address both the Israeli and Jordanian parliaments , visit U.S. forces in Kuwait , confer_with the monarchs of Kuwait and Saudi_Arabia and meet in Cairo with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat . Clinton said at a news_conference Friday that a bloody terrorist bombing in the heart of Tel Aviv this week made him even more determined to go_ahead with the trip , which he said will dramatize U.S. support for the Middle_East peace process . He said that the radical Islamic organization Hamas perpetrated the bombing to sabotage Israel ' s negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization and Syria . &quot; I think it is terribly important , especially since there have been violent reactions from the enemies of peace , that the United States stand with the friends of peace and the champions of peace at this time , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; It is even more important than it would have been a_few days ago that I go there and that our country stick_up for this. &quot; He brushed_aside questions about his own safety , saying that he has confidence in the U.S. Secret_Service and the security_forces of the countries he will visit . U.S. officials said Syria played no role in the Tel Aviv bombing or in other recent acts of terrorism in Israel . However , the State_Department has long included Syria on its list of countries that support international terrorism . In the latest report , the department said the Damascus regime &quot; continues to provide support and safe haven &quot; for terrorist groups that target Israel . Clinton said he will urge Assad to curb Damascus-based terrorist organizations , but the main purpose of the meeting is to attempt to accelerate the ponderous pace of the Israel-Syria talks . &quot; I do not believe that we can permit ( Syrian support of terrorism ) to keep us from pursuing a comprehensive peace as long as nothing in our peace agreements undermines our commitment to end terrorism , &quot; Clinton said . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said Clinton and Assad will not have enough time together to engage in detailed negotiations . But he said the meeting &quot; can inspire Assad to move the process forward. &quot; The Syrian president covets the international recognition that accompanies a visit by a U.S. President to Damascus , and U.S. officials hope that the meeting will result in some sort of gesture toward the Israelis . A senior State_Department official said later that the visit &quot; gives us a chance to concentrate their minds. &quot; Syrian and Israeli officials have not met face-to-face for months , so the negotiations are being conducted through American go-betweens , primarily Christopher . The secretary_of_state said he will resume Jerusalem-Damascus shuttle diplomacy &quot; when the parties are ready for me to come_back , &quot; probably within a_few weeks . Recent terrorist incidents have produced a backlash in Israel against the peace process , which could make_it more difficult for Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin to strike a compromise with Assad . But U.S. officials said Rabin probably can continue the negotiations unless there is a terrorist attack linked directly to Syria . A senior State_Department official said Assad will probably rein_in Damascus-based terrorist groups , at least as long as the negotiations seem to be productive , because the Syrian president knows that &quot; if Rabin ' s political space disappears , it will not be possible to reach an agreement with Syria. &quot; Clinton ' s trip is the most extensive one to the Middle_East by a U.S. President since Richard Nixon toured the region in 1974 , less than a year after Israel ' s war with Egypt and Syria . Clinton is the first President to visit Damascus since Nixon , although former Presidents Jimmy_Carter , Ronald Reagan and George_Bush all met Assad in Europe . Clinton and Assad met in Geneva last year . Clinton used the news_conference to claim credit for a recent string of foreign_policy successes , including the signing Friday in Geneva of an agreement intended to curtail North_Korea ' s nuclear_weapons program . &quot; This is a good_deal for the United States , &quot; he said . &quot; North_Korea will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program . South_Korea and our other allies will be_better protected . The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons. &quot; Shortly after the agreement was signed , South_Korea announced the cancellation of a joint U.S.-South Korea military exercise scheduled for later this year . Clinton also hailed the return of elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to Haiti and Iraq ' s retreat from the Kuwaiti border in the face of a U.S. military buildup in Kuwait . &quot; A lot of these things are the accumulation of two years of hard work , trying to fashion the national security of the United States and advance the economic interest of the United States and advance democracy in the post-Cold War world , &quot; he said . &quot; A lot of these things have come_together in a short time. &quot; Deputy Defense_Secretary John M . Deutch later wrapped the last two weeks in a mantle of hyperbole . &quot; This has been the best week or two weeks we ' ve seen in national security in about 200 years , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
