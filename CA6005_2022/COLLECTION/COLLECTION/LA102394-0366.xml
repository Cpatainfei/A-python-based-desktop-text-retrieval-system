   <HEADLINE> THE END OF THE KOHL ERA HAS BEGUN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s coalition has prevailed by the narrowest margin in Parliament since the first German national election after the war . This outcome will not by itself diminish his authority , since the Kohl coalition ' s real margin is greater than it appears . No current leader would accept becoming chancellor with the help of 30 former Communist_Party members , who entered Parliament through a heretofore inoperative constitutional clause . But this is precisely why the election is likely to be viewed in retrospect as an augury of impending upheaval in the German political landscape -- as the beginning of the end of the era of Kohl . At a minimum , Kohl ' s coalition partner , the liberal Free Democratic Party , will become increasingly fractious . It may even abandon the coalition altogether and switch sides by midterm . The Free Democrats are having an identity_crisis . They know they came_close to failing to get the 5 % of the total vote necessary to qualify for representation in Parliament . They may well have crossed that hurdle only because Kohl ' s party encouraged the switch of enough of its own votes to sustain the coalition . The Free Democrats seem to have reached the point that former Vice_Chancellor and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher described to me in 1980 , when his party had been allied_with the Social Democrats for more_than 10 years . He said his party would have to look_for an opportunity to switch during the next electoral period because , if its voters became too accustomed to a permanent coalition with Social Democrats , they would lose interest in a separate existence and vote for Social Democrats directly . A similar situation seems to have arisen today , though the current Free Democratic leader lacks the manipulative skill of his predecessor and would have to take_into_account the risk of a complete disintegration of his party if he tried to change coalitions . But self-interest will drive the Free Democrats toward greater assertiveness and , at an opportune moment , tempt them to switch coalitions . If the Free Democrats join the Socialists and the Greens , the resulting coalition would be in a position to elect a new chancellor . Kohl ' s fourth term would be unprecedentedly precarious , and his government would require far greater effort than previously to pass its legislative program . In addition , his own party may be tempted into succession maneuvers . Kohl had hinted strongly that , if elected , he might not serve more_than two years and would hand_over the remainder of his term to a successor of_his_own choosing . But after the recent election , such a move could trigger a shift in coalitions by giving the Free Democrats a pretext to reject the Christian Democratic Union ' s choice . On the other hand , if Kohl serves out the course , he will have an exhausting term as a prelude to fighting another bitter election battle with -- this time -- uncertain allies constantly reviewing whether they are more likely to reach 5 % as the right_wing of a Socialist-led coalition or as the left_wing of a Christian Democratic one . These are melancholy prospects , because Kohl is one of the seminal figures of our period . He has been a guarantee of Germany ' s Atlantic and European orientation and a shield against nationalistic or romantic temptations , from which his people have suffered through much of their modern history . This does not reflect a lack of confidence in Social Democrats , who proved their sense_of_responsibility under chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt . Since then , however , the party ' s radical wing has grown far more restless ; its coalition party would be the Greens , whose formal program rejects the Atlantic Alliance and a major international role for Germany . The center_of_gravity of such a coalition would be much farther left and would make implementation of traditional Atlantic policy much more difficult . The approaching end of the Kohl era is_due not only to electoral arithmetic but to the transition in generations . Kohl is the last West German leader with a living memory of World_War_II and its aftermath . The next generation , of all_the parties , will be less tied to traditional interpretations , more cool-headed about assessing national interests and more inclined to assert a national German role . This will be reinforced by the growing influence of the formerly communist part of Germany , whose people did not experience the great period of Atlantic cooperation and European construction and who saw in nationalism a refuge from communist oppression . These trends are compounded in the the post-Cold War world . When Germany was divided , Europe provided a political home and a substitute for a national policy . So_long as German armies stood on the Elbe , the Atlantic Alliance was essential for German security . Germany ' s unification removes one incentive for subordination to supranational institutions ; the retreat of Russian forces from Central Europe eliminates another . Meantime , there has been no U.S. initiative to define new purposes for the Atlantic Alliance other_than the Partnership for Peace . For the United States , the approaching end of the Kohl period represents a watershed of its own : whether to continue emphasizing new universalist institutions , which may progressively weaken the Atlantic Alliance and change the nature of the European Union , or to revitalize the existing building_blocks of the European order and the Atlantic Community . The Clinton_Administration will not have time to pursue both approaches in partnership with Kohl ; it must establish priorities . In the time remaining , the United States must work with Kohl on defining membership in both the Atlantic Alliance and the European Union for the states of Eastern Europe , and on creating new but different structures for political consultation with the states arising out of the former Soviet_Union . A clear sense of identity of the Atlantic Alliance and a clear definition of the European Union is a prerequisite to good relations with Russia . The reluctance to draw new_lines means reliance on those made irrelevant by the end of the Cold_War . Neither Europe nor the Atlantic Alliance can stop at the East_German border without creating a vacuum between Germany and Russia -- the historic source of European wars . Revitalizing European and Atlantic institutions would be a noble culmination of Kohl ' s stewardship . It is important , for whatever happens , the United States and Europe will not soon find so reliable and courageous a partner as Kohl .</TEXT>
