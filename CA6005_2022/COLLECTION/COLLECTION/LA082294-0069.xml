   <HEADLINE> HOUSE OKS CRIME BILL , KEEPS ASSAULT GUN BAN ; CONGRESS : THE REVIVED MEASURE IS TRIMMED TO $ 30 BILLION . CLINTON CALLS 235-195 VOTE A ' GREAT VICTORY FOR ALL LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS. ' BUT A GOP FILIBUSTER COULD AWAIT IN THE SENATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a roller-coaster ride to the end , President Clinton ' s anti-crime bill finally squeezed through a surly and exhausted House on Sunday night after Democrats made major concessions to win enough Republican votes to overcome fierce opposition by the gun lobby . Stripped of nearly a third of its spending for the social programs opposed by Republicans but with its ban on the sale of assault weapons intact , the $ 30-billion measure was approved , 235 to 195 , after what both sides agreed was one of the fiercest legislative battles in recent memory . In Oval Office remarks shortly after the vote , President Clinton lauded passage of the bill as &quot; a great victory for all law-abiding Americans. &quot; &quot; This is the way Washington ought to work , and I hope it will work this way in the future , &quot; he said . Clinton praised House Republicans for helping to save the bill , saying that he was &quot; very grateful &quot; for their aid . A major victory for him , the election-year struggle over the crime bill had come_to represent a portentous trial of the Democrats ' ability to govern . However , in a warning that at least one more hairpin curve lies ahead on the crime bill ' s tortuous legislative course , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said that he expects Republican senators to try to filibuster the package when it goes_to the upper chamber this week . &quot; They will filibuster , and it ' s going_to be tough , but I think we ' ll get enough votes to pass it , &quot; Sen . Joseph R . Biden Jr . ( D-Del. ) said . The legislation provides_for hiring as_many as 100 # 000 police_officers over six years , building new prisons , funding crime prevention programs , banning the sale of certain assault weapons , expanding the death_penalty and mandating life in prison for three-time violent offenders . For the moment at least , the White_House and its Democratic allies on Capitol_Hill were both exultant and relieved that they had brought the crime bill this far with its assault weapon ban intact , despite tenacious opposition by the National Rifle Assn . and other gun lobbying groups . &quot; The people who hate guns are in the majority right now , &quot; said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks ( D-Tex. ) , admitting that he and about 50 other pro-NRA Democrats had waged an unsuccessful campaign to kill the weapon ban . They almost succeeded when they joined forces Aug . 11 with Republicans to block the House from considering the original bill on a narrow procedural vote . Stunned by a defeat orchestrated in part by members of its own party , the Clinton_Administration began negotiating with moderate Republicans , who agreed to support the bill after winning about $ 3.3 billion in spending_cuts and stiffer penalties for some offenses in a marathon round of weekend talks ending early Sunday . The GOP moderates delivered 42 votes , more_than enough to allow Clinton to prevail , 239 to 189 , on the procedural vote the second time around Sunday . But another hurdle loomed when opponents sought to send the bill back to the drafting table with instructions to incorporate alternative provisions that would have dropped the assault weapon ban and cut even more of the spending that many Republicans had derided as &quot; pork. &quot; Suddenly fearful that it would be unable to hold its narrow bipartisan coalition together on that motion , the White_House waged an eleventh-hour lobbying blitz . The Democratic leadership warned its members that with their votes rode the fate of far more_than just the anti-crime bill , one of Clinton ' s legislative priorities in this election year . &quot; We ' ve been telling them that , more_than any other vote this year , the crime bill is a test of party loyalty , &quot; a senior Democratic strategist said . &quot; We ' ve been telling them that the way they vote could affect the health_care debate and even the party ' s chances of retaining control of the House next year. &quot; The NRA also lobbied furiously , flooding congressional offices on Sunday with leaflets and letters that warned members to beware of &quot; the incredible voter anger brewing outside the ( Washington ) Beltway &quot; and its consequences for their reelection efforts in November . In the end , however , the White_House strategy worked as Clinton held_on to the votes of 31 of the 38 members of the Congressional Black Caucus in spite of their opposition to the anti-crime bill ' s expanded death_penalties and the steep spending_cuts in crime prevention programs favored by liberal lawmakers . In an effort to attract the caucus ' votes , the GOP leadership dropped the death_penalty provisions from its alternative bill , which was hurriedly drafted late Saturday by Reps . Duncan Hunter ( R-El Cajon ) and Bill Brewster ( D-Okla. ) . But even though the Black Caucus favored the anti-crime bill itself , 24 to 11 , most of its members stuck_by the Administration on the second procedural vote that marked the defeat of the gun lobby and cleared the way for final passage of what Clinton hailed as the &quot; toughest &quot; anti-crime legislation ever to clear the House . On the second vote , which both sides agreed was the key to final passage , 201 Democrats and 30 Republicans sided with the Administration , while 51 Democrats and 146 Republicans voted against it . The bill , said Rep . Cynthia McKinney ( D-Ga. ) , was still &quot; the most balanced approach to crime that this country has seen in a long_time , &quot; even though the weight of its provisions had been shifted to &quot; an ounce of prevention ( for ) a pound of punishment. &quot; Under the compromise negotiated with the GOP moderates led by Reps . Michael N . Castle of Delaware and John R . Kasich of Ohio , the measure that moves to the Senate this week includes $ 30 billion in funding over six years for a broad array of law_enforcement and crime prevention programs . Financed by a trust_fund fed by the savings that are expected to accrue from the anticipated elimination of 270 # 000 federal jobs over the next few years , the crime bill would provide $ 13.45 billion to hire more police and beef_up the budgets of law_enforcement agencies , $ 9.85 billion for prison construction , $ 5.9 billion for prevention programs , such_as midnight basketball_leagues and other after-hours activities for troubled youths , and $ 1 billion to establish a program of alternative sentencing and treatment for drug_users . Other key provisions include a 10-year ban on the manufacture and sale of 19 types of assault weapons , expansion of the death_penalty to include more_than 60 federal offenses , new regulations to help protect women against stalkers and spousal abusers , stricter registration requirements for paroled sex offenders and the &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; law mandating life imprisonment for three-time convicted felons . Most of the changes negotiated with the GOP moderates centered_on the crime prevention side of the package . A $ 650-million youth job training_program was eliminated while other prevention programs like midnight basketball were either cut by 10 % or rolled into block_grants . The compromise also permits charges of previous sex offenses to be admitted into evidence when accused sex offenders are tried in federal_courts , requires police to notify communities when convicted sex offenders move_into their areas and significantly restricts the original bill ' s provisions on the early parole of nonviolent drug offenders . With the momentous floor fight over , exhausted lawmakers grabbed their bags and literally fled out the doors , eager to get home to their districts to begin a long-delayed summer recess . For Clinton , the main plus was in preserving the assault weapon ban -- an accomplishment that allowed him to claim final victory even though he was forced to accept steep cuts_in crime prevention programs . But his victory came_after so_much agony and partisan conflict that it appeared Pyrrhic -- confirming his tenacity as a fighter but doing little to erase the impression , after days of apocalyptic press coverage , that he is a weak President . The Republicans , for their part , were clearly elated with their ability to demonstrate that Clinton no longer can ignore them , even in a Congress nominally controlled by Democrats . But while the spending_cuts they negotiated allowed them to claim that they had made a &quot; bad bill better , &quot; in the words of GOP Whip Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) , many Republicans were quietly acknowledging that the bill may have been the wrong issue on which to draw their own highly partisan line in the sands of election-year politics . Upset that Clinton was upstaging them on crime -- an issue on which they traditionally have appeared stronger than Democrats -- the Republicans repeatedly attacked the bill as a pork-loaded measure that was too soft_on criminals . &quot; Criminals need arraignment , not entertainment , &quot; said Rep . Jack Kingston ( R-Ga. ) . But in the end , several GOP lawmakers privately voiced concerns that they had succeeded only in portraying themselves as partisan obstructionists and allies of the opponents of gun_control -- an issue on which they were at_odds not only with public_opinion but many of_their_own mayors and governors and nearly every major law_enforcement agency in the country . California Delegation ' s Votes Here is how members of the California delegation voted on the $ 30-billion crime bill : Democrats for -- Becerra , Beilenson , Berman , Brown , Condit , Dixon , Dooley , Edwards , Eshoo , Farr , Fazio , Filner , Hamburg , Harman , Lantos , Lehman , Martinez , Matsui , Miller , Mineta , Pelosi , Roybal-Allard , Schenk , Stark , Torres , Waxman , Woolsey Republicans for -- Gallegly , Horn , Huffington Democrats against -- Dellums , Waters Republicans against -- Baker , Calvert , Cox , Cunningham , Doolittle , Dornan , Dreier , Herger , Hunter , Kim , Lewis , McCandless , McKeon , Moorhead , Packard , Pombo , Rohrabacher , Royce , Thomas Democrats not voting -- Tucker Crime Bills Compared Here is how the $ 33.2-billion crime bill defeated by the House on a procedural vote Aug . 11 compares to the $ 30-billion legislation it passed Sunday .

Compromise -- Cuts $ 2 billion from prevention measures , with an across-the-board 10 % reduction in all_the measures and more severe cuts_in some . It combines some individual grants into a $ 379.7-million block designed to give localities more authority in determining how the money would be spent .

Compromise -- Authorizes $ 13.45 billion to hire more police and beef_up the budgets of law_enforcement agencies . TRUST_FUND Original -- Most of the bill would be financed by a $ 30-billion trust_fund made_up of money saved by the White_House ' s &quot; reinventing government &quot; initiative , which is designed to reduce bureaucracy .

SEXUAL OFFENDERS Original -- The names of sexual predators -- people who commit sex crimes against children or adults -- must be registered with law_enforcement agencies for 10 years , subject_to annual verification . Compromise -- Sexual predators must be registered for 10 years , subject_to annual verification .
