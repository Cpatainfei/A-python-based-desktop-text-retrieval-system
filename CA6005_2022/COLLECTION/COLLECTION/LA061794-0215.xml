   <TEXT> Oh , so no w you ' re a World Cup Soccer fan . Now that the commemorative coins are minted and the T-shirts are printed and the hawkers are selling the flags and the American team is warming_up in Mission Viejo and the first game starts today and all you have to do is get a ticket to the final in Pasadena . All of a sudden , your speech is peppered with words like &quot; mid-fielder &quot; and &quot; header &quot; and &quot; corner kick. &quot; But where were you in 1986 when the United States_government nearly mucked the whole_thing up ? The truth be known , most Americans don ' t get soccer . They never have . This is the most popular sport in the world , and most of the games , if they are broadcast at all , are not even broadcast in English . And so it came_to pass that World Cup Soccer , played for the first time in the United States , might not be here at all if not for the_likes_of Christopher Cox -- USC soccer player turned White_House legal counsel turned Republican congressman from Newport Beach . It was Cox who helped steer World Cup officials through Washington ' s bureaucratic rapids when the United States was first proposed as a venue eight years ago , securing an executive order from then-President Ronald Reagan that directed the cooperation of all federal agencies and cinched World Cup USA 1994 . He has since watched_over everything -- from the commemorative coin to the site of the American team ' s practice field . &quot; He was a key . Everybody in the damned government had their fingers in this , &quot; said Eddie Mahe , who ran the U.S. Soccer Federation ' s 1986 campaign to bring the event to the United States . &quot; Without him , I don ' t know that it would have survived. &quot; To understand the process behind this event , one must understand the United States ' tepid relationship with a sport beloved by the rest of the world : British fans have been known to get so worked_up over soccer that they trample each other to death . But a recent Harris Poll suggests that only 20 % of the Americans are even aware that the World Cup will be played here , and fewer than half of those intend to watch it . World Cup soccer draws a global audience of 2 billion -- that ' s 2 1 / 2 times the number of people who tune into the Super Bowl . But when professional soccer was briefly played in Anaheim several years ago , officials tried to draw a crowd by asking the Beach Boys to perform ; the Beach Boys left before the first kick . It isn ' t as though America hasn ' t tried to love soccer . Once , Henry Kissinger went_to Stockholm to persuade FIFA , the international soccer body , to send the World Cup here . FIFA said the United States was a pain_in_the_neck and gave the games to Mexico . It turns_out FIFA officials are more accustomed to dealing with leaders who sign a piece_of_paper and say &quot; let the games begin. &quot; They do not take_kindly_to an unappreciative public and a President who has to get permission from every agency of government just so a_few countries can kick a ball around a field . So one can only imagine a soccer lover ' s panic in 1986 when the United States was in the running to host the 1994 World Cup and the bureaucratic monster reared its ugly head . The Department of Treasury wanted to know about taxes on income earned by foreign soccer players in the United States . Agriculture wanted to know about the foreign food some athletes planned to import ( soccer players are evidently quite finicky eaters ) . Labor was muttering something about a 40-hour work week . Howard Baker , then Reagan ' s chief_of_staff , sensed trouble . He needed an attorney who could not only navigate the Washington bureaucracy , but relate to a sport that required the use of the head . There stood Chris Cox , who had played four years of soccer at St . Thomas Academy in St . Paul , Minn. , when most of the other kids in his high_school class went_out for football . A fellow who played varsity soccer at USC , knowing that any other varsity sport at such a prestigious university would have been out of his reach . ( &quot; Soccer was accessible to mere mortals , &quot; he would later recount. ) So what if Cox did switch to hockey at Harvard grad school ? This guy knew soccer . Baker gave him the job . &quot; World Cup USA was in a panic , &quot; Cox remembered . &quot; They needed waivers from virtually every agency of the federal_government . The President didn ' t have the authority to waive the laws. &quot; In record time , Cox prepared an executive order directing the agencies to fall_in_line . Reagan signed it . &quot; Chris personally kept the heat on , &quot; Mahe remembered reverently . &quot; He kept a club to the head of every agency . The order was signed_on a Saturday , three hours before the bid was to get_on a plane for Zurich . &quot; Without Chris , we would n ' t have had anyone inside the White_House , &quot; Mahe said . &quot; He just kept saying ' President Reagan wants this . Go do it. ' &quot; At the time , great sighs of relief were breathed by American soccer fans , a much-deprived lot left to worship a game that , in the words of one foreign journalist , &quot; America can ' t bring itself to love. &quot; But there was no national jump_for_joy , not like when Los Angeles locked_up the ' 84 Olympics . &quot; Nineteen-ninety-four seemed like a long_time off , so it was not a very impressive story to tell at the time , &quot; Cox said modestly . He spent the ensuing years helping introduce a bill allowing the commemorative World Cup coins to be minted , lobbied to have the American team practice in Mission Viejo and helped the Rose Bowl win out as final venue over someplace in Florida . Just the other day , the U.S. team presented him with the first jersey to be signed by all 22 members ; he sent it out for framing . Now he can sit_back in soccer nirvana , enjoying a game he has loved most of his life , even if he hasn ' t played it in 20 years . Maybe America will catch his soccer fever . Maybe not . When it ' s over , all 22 of the home team ' s players will leave the country to play with foreign soccer clubs , because soccer at their level does not exist in this country . &quot; Sometimes , &quot; the congressman said , &quot; it ' s just easier to watch football. &quot; WORLD CUP SOCCER</TEXT>
