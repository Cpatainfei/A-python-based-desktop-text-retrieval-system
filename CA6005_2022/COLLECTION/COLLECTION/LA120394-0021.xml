   <HEADLINE> TAIWAN ELECTIONS : TEST OF NATIONHOOD ; ASIA : BALLOT PITS ' MAINLANDERS ' AGAINST NATIONALISTS . SOME FEAR VOTE COULD SPUR CONFRONTATION WITH CHINA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Twelve times , Nationalist Party gubernatorial candidate James Soong tried to restart his speech before an animated crowd assembled at a soccer stadium here in west central Taiwan . Twelve times , supporters of Democratic Progressive_Party opponent Chen Ting-nan shouted him down , chanting &quot; traitor &quot; and &quot; Taiwanese vote for Taiwanese. &quot; Riot police , arranged three rows deep on the stadium floor , watched nervously as the political drama unfolded Monday night . What was supposed to be the country ' s first election for a national office -- provincial governor of Taiwan -- was evolving into a referendum on what constitutes nationhood on this prosperous , crowded island of 21 million people . Soong , 52 , a Mandarin-dialect speaker born in mainland_China , represents the longtime ruling elite of &quot; mainlanders &quot; driven to the island from China when Nationalist forces were defeated by the Communists in 1949 . Chen , also 52 , a Taiwanese-dialect speaker born_on Taiwan , stands_for the aspirations of the island ' s long-oppressed majority of Taiwanese natives . Their political collision at the Changhua soccer stadium demonstrated clearly the vitality of the emerging Taiwanese democracy . But it also revealed what some believe is a dangerous trend in nationalist , ethnocentric politics that could drive Taiwan into a confrontation with mainland_China . No other country in Asia has made more progress in developing democratic institutions in recent years than has the Republic_of_China on Taiwan . After decades of martial_law and one-party rule , Taiwan since 1989 has exploded into a passionate political_arena and role_model for Asia . In the last year alone , the country has gone_to the polls five times , culminating in today ' s hotly contested vote for governor and mayor of the country ' s two biggest cities , Taipei and Kaohsiung . Lively political rallies have dominated island life for weeks . A national presidential election is set for 1996 . The problem , say some worried Asian specialists , is that this sudden epidemic of democratic debate has pushed the previously taboo subject of national independence to the forefront of the political scene . In Taiwan , they argue , democracy is becoming too_much of a good thing . &quot; There is no question that Taiwan is responding to domestic political pressures that are creating strong impulses to try and muscle out greater political room for itself , &quot; said a senior Western diplomat in Beijing , where Taiwan ' s electoral politics are monitored in minute detail . &quot; It is equally clear that a major breakthrough in that area would risk a confrontation or a crisis in the Taiwan Strait of unpredictable scale. &quot; That is not a true picture , countered a Western observer in Taipei , where risk of a military confrontation is generally downplayed in the foreign community . &quot; This is a conservative , middle-class voting population , &quot; the observer said . &quot; The last thing they want to do is rattle Beijing ' s cages . The last thing they want to do is come_out for independence . These are practical people. &quot; At the root of the independence debate is the principle of &quot; one China. &quot; Since 1949 , both the mainland Communists and ruling Nationalists on Taiwan have publicly maintained the fiction of &quot; one China &quot; that includes both the mainland and the prosperous little island . Except for a handful of old-timers , however , most people here long ago abandoned the dream of recapturing the mainland . Meanwhile , tiny Taiwan has emerged as one of the world ' s great trading states , the world ' s 14th-largest economy and the biggest holder of foreign reserves , with more_than $ 80 billion in its treasury . The average annual income exceeds $ 10 # 000 -- more_than 10 times that of neighboring China . Economically , at least , Taiwan had become a de_facto independent state . All it lacked was diplomatic recognition , a national_flag and a seat in international bodies . But as the current political_campaign has shown , such issues have proven a powerful and irresistible tool for politicians in all camps . &quot; The question for Taiwan , &quot; said a Western diplomat in Beijing worried about the recent rise of the Taiwan independence movement , &quot; is what it really wants . There are two aspects of independence . One is flags , anthems , membership in the U.N. and all that . The other is having complete control of_your_own affairs and maybe not having all those little symbols. &quot; Even local elections are affected by the debate . All three of the country ' s three major parties have learned how to use the issue to their advantage or , conversely , to the detriment of their foes . In the governor ' s race , for example , candidate Soong has been damaged by his party ' s official -- if half-hearted -- support for eventual unification with the Chinese mainland . Opinion polls show that most Taiwanese citizens oppose the idea of rejoining the mainland . Meanwhile , in the important Taipei mayor ' s race , Democratic Progressive_Party candidate Chen Shui-bian saw his 10-point lead in the polls evaporate under_attack from an opponent , New Party candidate Jaw Shao-kang . Jaw won points by charging that Chen ' s pro-independence stance would lead Taiwan into a bloody military confrontation with the mainland . The increasing polarization of Taiwan politics along linguistic and ethnic lines was evident again Friday , the eve of the elections . At Taipei Municipal Stadium , 50 # 000 supporters of Jaw waved Republic_of_China ( Taiwan ) flags and yellow pennants emblazoned with the party ' s slogan : &quot; In Chaotic Times , the Best Choice. &quot; All speeches were in the Mandarin_dialect , official language of the Chinese mainland . Three miles east at the China Trade Center , an even larger Democratic Progressive_Party crowd rallied in a parking_lot for their candidate , Chen . At this meeting , however , only the Taiwanese dialect was spoken . In Thursday editions of most leading Chinese-language newspapers , supporters of the Nationalist Party , known here as the Kuomintang , or KMT , took_out half-page ads with apocalyptic warnings of the island ' s future under the Democratic Progressive_Party : &quot; Communist_China would use military_forces against Taiwan , bringing endless disaster upon us . . . . Companies would move_out , there would be huge capital flight , foreign investment would dry_up , the stock and property values would crash. &quot; In the Taipei mayor ' s race , the New Party tactic of exploiting a common fear of mainland military intervention effectively shifted attention from Chen ' s popular promise to clean_up Taipei , plagued by pollution and some of Asia ' s most nightmarish traffic . The attack only intensified appeals from Chen ' s supporters for Taiwan ' s independence . Once again , the issue of independence for Taiwan dominated the political agenda . Used either offensively or defensively , the independence issue has proved to be an effective hot button for the incipient Taiwanese democracy . One reason generally cited for the popularity of President Lee Teng-hui , for example , is his high-profile push for a Taiwanese seat in the United Nations . But it is precisely such actions , responding to democratically induced pressures , say critics , that may be pushing Taiwan into conflict with its big neighbor to the west . On many occasions , including the recent meeting in Jakarta between President Clinton and mainland Chinese leader Jiang Zemin , China has stated that it will act militarily against Taiwan if the island declares independence . Pro-independence leaders here say the Chinese are posturing . &quot; If the mainland attacks Taiwan , &quot; Hsieh Ru-an , 45 , a high_school sports instructor who was one of those in the Changhua stadium crowd , said confidently , &quot; the international community will support Taiwan . As long as everyone supports democracy , they will all condemn China. &quot; But others , including some senior U.S. officials , claim that the Chinese threat to invade should be taken seriously , particularly if aging , ailing Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping dies and China becomes embroiled in a political succession battle . &quot; We worry about a power struggle in China , &quot; said Antonio Chiang , editor of a magazine called Journalist . &quot; It seems that every time there is a problem , they ring a bell . The bell is always Taiwan. &quot;</TEXT>
