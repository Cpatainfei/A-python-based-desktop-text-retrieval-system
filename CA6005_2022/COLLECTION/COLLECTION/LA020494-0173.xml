   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : BIG 3 AUTO STOCKS DRIVING INVESTORS INTO A FRENZY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wall_Street knows the importance of momentum , and that ' s what it sees in car and truck sales this year . Auto-related stocks , therefore , remain a favorite way to bet_on a stronger than expected economy in ' 94 -- even though most of the stocks have already zoomed . On Thursday , the Big Three auto_makers provided more inspiration for the bulls : Despite relentless cold in the eastern part of the country , and the earthquake in the Southland , January car and truck sales by General Motors , Ford and Chrysler were up nearly 15 % versus a year earlier . Investors , who were stunned by Chrysler ' s robust fourth-quarter earnings_report two weeks ago , responded to the latest good news by pushing shares of the Big Three up sharply again Thursday . GM rose $ 1.50 to a record $ 63 , while Ford jumped $ 1.625 to $ 69.375 and Chrysler added $ 1.25 to $ 62.50. Both Ford and Chrysler are trading just under their all-time highs . Many Wall Streeters now are stirring the frenzy for the auto shares by touting price targets in the $ 80s or $ 90s for the stocks a year or so down the road . The optimists ' scenario : Car and truck sales continue to boom , earnings keep topping estimates , and waffling investors finally capitulate and jump in , lured in large part by the stocks ' comparatively low prices relative to earnings per share . * A key assumption of the bulls , however , is that investors will believe that car and truck sales can continue to rise well into 1995 and 1996 , if not beyond . In the auto industry and others that ride long cycles of boom and then bust , you don ' t buy the stocks if you can see the bust on the horizon . By that point , smart investors are already bailing_out , anticipating the next downturn in earnings . So far , almost nobody ' s talking bust . Among other things , experts point to the advanced age of cars and trucks on_the_road as a sure sign of sales yet to come . Ron Glantz , analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds , says at least one-quarter of the U.S. car and truck population is 12 or more years old . More important , rising consumer confidence and faster job growth as the economy expands should put more Americans in the mental and financial states necessary to buy big-ticket items such_as cars . &quot; We ' re now getting employment growth , and generally you need a car to get_to a job , &quot; notes David Hale , economist at Kemper Corp . Finally , the once-feared Japanese continue to lose market share to the Big Three , and nothing suggests a significant reversal of that trend soon . Chrysler ' s share of the car and truck market rose to 14.8 % last year from 13.3 % in 1992 , while Toyota ' s dropped to 7.4 % from 8.0 % . All of this feeds Wall_Street ' s glowing earnings outlook for the Big Three . Ford , for example , is expected to report that it earned $ 4.12 a share_in ' 93 ; it should double that figure between 1996 and 1998 , according to Value Line Investment Survey . Not everybody buys the unending-growth story , however . Many money managers remain skittish about GM in particular because of its huge pension liabilities , which could severely hamper its finances . And some big investors simply worry that all_the good news is already built into the Big Three stocks , with no room for trouble -- such_as a rise in interest_rates or an international incident that causes consumer confidence to plummet . Wall_Street is &quot; striving to make this a secular ( story ) , but I just can ' t convince myself that these stocks are anything more_than the cyclical issues they ' ve always been , &quot; says John Schaffner , manager of the $ 450-million Nationwide Growth_stock mutual_fund in Columbus , Ohio . The bulls argue that skeptics just need time to catch Big Three fever . And the favorite of many analysts remains Chrysler , with its promising new-car lineup for ' 94 , starting with the already- launched Neon in the small-car , low-priced arena . &quot; Chrysler has today ' s cars , &quot; gushes New York money manager Seth Glickenhaus , a major Chrysler shareholder . &quot; They ' re on a roll. &quot; But let ' s say you don ' t want to own the Big Three , yet you would like to play the auto boom . Is there a better way -- via auto parts suppliers , for example ? Most analysts say no . Look_at the price-to-earnings ratios on the parts suppliers ' shares versus the Big Three ' s P-Es . The Big Three are still the better value , most auto bulls say . A few possible exceptions : Federal-Mogul , a major parts maker and distributor seen in strong shape to benefit from future parts demand in the aftermarket ( i.e. , repairs ) here and , importantly , abroad ; parts retailer Genuine Parts , considered overlooked by some despite its powerful franchise in the United States , and Reynolds &amp; Reynolds , a developer of data-processing systems for car_dealers , many of whom need to modernize . Ready for Overdrive ? Here are analysts ' consensus earnings-per-share estimates for major auto-related stocks ( or actual numbers , if reported ) and the stocks ' price-to-earnings ratios based on 1994 earnings estimates . 05 # 21 , 09 # 11 , 08 # 09 Thurs .
