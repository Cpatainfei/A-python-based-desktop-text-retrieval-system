   <HEADLINE> GELLER TO BE 1ST FEMALE RABBI OF LARGE CONGREGATION ; RELIGION : ASSUMING LEADERSHIP OF TEMPLE EMANUEL IN BEVERLY HILLS PROMISES TO THRUST THE VETERAN ACTIVIST INTO NATIONAL PROMINENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was the summer of 1967 , and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference was meeting in a sweltering Memphis , Tenn. , church hall . Laura Geller , a college_student and one of only a_few whites to attend the civil_rights meeting , had stepped outside for a breath of air . She was beginning to feel that she didn ' t belong , she confided to a veteran SCLC organizer . His reply helped turn her life around . &quot; You ' re right , &quot; he said . &quot; You don ' t belong . You should go_home to your own community and organize there. &quot; Geller has been working in her community ever since , as campus rabbi at USC for 14 years , and most recently as the highly visible executive_director of the American Jewish Congress , a civil_rights and political action group . Now , at 44 , Geller is about to step into national prominence as the first woman rabbi to head a large congregation -- Temple Emanuel of Beverly Hills . The third woman ever ordained as a rabbi in the liberal Reform_movement , which claims the allegiance of an estimated 40 % of synagogue-affiliated Jews , she has even made a name for herself among some traditionalists who reject her ideology and do not recognize the right of women to be rabbis . &quot; She ' s a very warm , engaging person , with a brilliant mind , &quot; said Rabbi Daniel Landes of B ' nai David-Judea , an Orthodox congregation in the Pico-Robertson District . Geller has counseled students , helped found a feminist center , worked to establish a dialogue between Jewish and Arab Americans in Los Angeles and spoken out for abortion rights and against violence here and in Bosnia . She has also created various rituals to help congregants deal with life crises such_as abortion . &quot; She ' s a great person , &quot; said another Orthodox leader , who declined to be quoted by name , &quot; but she will stand_up when the buttons are pushed to fight. &quot; Emanuel has seen its share of fighting . It has been racked by years of conflict over a previous rabbi , who left amid controversy over synagogue expansion plans , and , more recently , by a thwarted merger with the larger and richer Wilshire Boulevard Temple . Leaders say they hope the fighting is over . &quot; We ' re just flying_on a cloud . The response ( to the hiring ) has been tremendous , &quot; said Bruce Corwin , president-elect of the temple , who helped lead the fight to keep the 56-year-old institution independent . With a flourishing day_school and a prime location on Burton Way , Temple Emanuel has lost a_few hundred families since its membership hit a high of 1 # 200 families in the mid-1980s . At about 900 families , however , it is still one of the largest Jewish congregations in the country and clearly the largest to be served by a woman as senior rabbi , said Rabbi Lennard R . Thal , regional director of the Reform_Movement ' s Union of American Hebrew Congregations . Other large congregations are in suburban San Diego , with 650 families , and downtown Boston , with 575 member families . With $ 500 # 000 in pledges in_hand to help counter a reported debt of $ 2 million , Corwin said he expects Geller to bring_in new members and rally the existing ones , &quot; people who are willing to step_up and say , ' Here ' s my money , I want to support this place. ' &quot; Some veteran congregants may drop_out , said Rabbi Emeritus Meyer Heller , who came_back from retirement two years ago , &quot; but we ' re going to gain many_more than we lose. &quot; &quot; These are people who would find it difficult to accept a woman as their rabbi , &quot; said Heller , who plans to stay_on part time . &quot; I understand that feeling , but I hope they will meet her , hear her preach , hear her teach , before they make their decision. &quot; Of the 16 candidates for the post , Corwin said , Geller was &quot; the most rabbinic . . . with a feeling of spirituality that none of the others had. &quot; The other co-chair , Harry Helft , whose side lost the merger fight , said she was &quot; the best and the brightest , one that would . . . be able to heal our temple. &quot; Helft said that gender was not a major factor_in the decision to hire Geller . But Corwin said there were some questions before the committee made its unanimous vote , which was announced May 9 . &quot; First , is our congregation ready for a senior rabbi who happens to be a woman ? And secondly , are her views too far to the left ? And she answered the questions , &quot; he said . &quot; She said , ' I have strong_points of view and I respect other points of view. ' She handled everything with grace. &quot; Geller was not sure of her calling until the early 1970s , when she worked with college_students as a volunteer chaplain at Vassar College during her second semester of rabbinical school at the Hebrew Union College ' s New York campus . After her ordination in 1976 , she went_to USC , where she met young people of every stripe of Judaism , from secular to Orthodox . She also started looking_to Jewish tradition for new ways to deal with the crises , challenges and turning points of modern life . During her first year at USC , one young_woman startled her by seeking a Jewish way for dealing with the emotional aftermath of abortion . &quot; Here was a live Jewish woman in need of healing . ( The abortion ) was appropriate , but she was surprised at the feelings of loss and guilt . She asked if she could say kaddish ( the prayer for the dead ) . I said she could not . Then we talked_about her feelings of guilt. &quot; Over the years , such pleas led to the creation , by her and others , of ceremonies for naming a newborn girl , dealing with miscarriage and marking events such_as divorce , menopause , significant birthdays , children leaving home and retirement . Sometimes the ceremonies have to be invented . In other cases , Geller says , they can be glimpsed in the Biblical text , such_as Abraham ' s feast on the weaning of Isaac , which inspired a Seder-like party when Geller weaned her own son , now 11 . A daughter , now 5 , was similarly feted . Divorced from their father for four years , Geller recently married Ben Bycel , executive_director of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission , which monitors city government and politics . Although some of the rituals have been published in book chapters and magazine_articles , Geller said she hopes to finish her own book on them before her Aug . 1 starting date at Emanuel . &quot; Fat chance , &quot; she adds . &quot; Judaism speaks_to the real issues of our lives , &quot; she said . &quot; How we live . How we love . I ' ve learned . . . that the real challenge to the Jewish future is not intermarriage , Arab propaganda or anti-Semitism -- it ' s boredom. &quot; The answer to that , she suggested , lies_in community and spirituality , two themes that worshipers at Emanuel will be hearing a lot about in coming years . &quot; People look_for that in a lot of weird places , &quot; she said . &quot; We have to realize that Judaism can provide it for us. &quot; As one of the first female rabbis , Geller says she has relied_on male role_models . The small Reconstructionist movement opened its doors to women in 1974 , while the middle-of-the-road Conservative movement did not ordain a woman until 1985 . As other women have donned rabbinical robes , she said , &quot; I ' ve been mentored by some of my younger colleagues , and they by me. &quot; At Mishkon Tephilo , a Conservative synagogue with 240 families in Venice , Rabbi Naomi Levi said that Geller has been a model for her . But , she added , &quot; for both me and Laura , ultimately , hopefully , the day will come when people make such a fuss not because we ' re women rabbis but because we ' re good rabbis . Hopefully , perhaps when the Messiah comes , that won ' t be a big deal. &quot; Busy with campus problems and larger community relations issues since moving to the American Jewish Congress three years ago , Geller said that being &quot; the first woman &quot; has not been a big deal for years . Now , however , &quot; there ' s no question that I ' m the first woman to be the senior rabbi of a synagogue this large , so again it ' s an issue . . . . People will want me to prove myself , and I will prove myself. &quot; Twenty years of life experience will help , she said , along with a sense_of_humor -- &quot; I don ' t think I would have survived till now without it. &quot;</TEXT>
