   <HEADLINE> AL MARTINEZ : ORDEAL AT CHARLIE ' S MARKET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When I was a kid in Oakland , I stole a bag of doughnuts once from a grocery_store on East 14th Street . They were glazed doughnuts in a brown bag . I did_it because we were poor and I was hungry , and because it was an exciting thing to do . I hid the doughnuts inside a jacket and sidled out of the store as casually as I could , but I was a clumsy thief and the grocer , a man named Fred Barnes , saw me . He shouted &quot; Hey ! &quot; and came_after me , red-faced and snorting fire , and cornered me in an alley about a block away . I made a run at him to try knocking him out of the way , but he caught me by the nape of the neck , marched me back to the store and took my name_and_address . He said he ' d be notifying my parents and juvenile authorities and I would be catching everyone ' s hell in just a_few days . Which brings me to Aldo Vega . He stole a box of cookies from a place called Charlie ' s Market in Lynwood , and also was a clumsy thief . The owner of the market , Michael Kim , saw him . Aldo , a 14-year-old , took_off . Kim jumped in his car and caught him three blocks away . Then he shot him . He did_it , Kim said , because the boy with Aldo had a knife . No knife was found , but a screwdriver was later recovered . He did_it , Kim said , because Aldo appeared to be reaching for a weapon . There was no weapon , but Aldo admits hiking_up his shirt and reaching_into his pocket . There was just that damned box of cookies scattered on the sidewalk . * No criminal charges were filed against Kim because the kid stole cookies , didn ' t he , and Kim feared for his life , didn ' t he ? Cookie thieves are notorious for murdering grocers . The case was instantly compared to the killing of 15-year-old Latasha Harlins in Compton three years ago . She was shot dead by grocer Soon Ja Du after the two had struggled over a $ 1.79 bottle of orange_juice . Du was fined $ 500 and placed on probation . Few killers are granted such an easy way_out . Aldo didn ' t die . The bullet fired from Kim ' s . 38 missed his heart . The D.A. ' s office announced magnanimously that it would not file shoplifting charges against him . There are similarities between the shootings of Latasha and Aldo . Both guns were fired by Korean Americans , though Latasha was black and Aldo is Latino . Both shootings were set_in_motion by the theft of items worth less than $ 2 . Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti said no charges would be filed against Kim because no prosecutable crime occurred . Commentators , defending Kim ' s actions , pointed_out that 35 Korean American owners of small businesses have been shot in L.A. in the past year . He had a right not to become No . 36 . But Chicano activist Armando Sotomayor cut_through the statistics and legal justification when he stood on the steps of the Criminal_Courts Building and said , &quot; You don ' t shoot a 14-year-old boy over a 49-cent box of cookies. &quot; * There are those who see the shooting of a Latino by a Korean as a racial incident . I don ' t . I see it as a metaphor of the time and place in which we live , in a society packaged by violence and summarized by clashing rights . Aldo Vega had no right to steal from the store . Michael Kim had a right to pursue him . Aldo Vega had no right to make a threatening gesture . Michael Kim had a right to defend himself . Rights are endlessly debated in a nation that revolves_around them . But the debate ends when guns are fired . There are an estimated 200 million firearms in private hands in this country , and arguments are increasingly terminated , and rights defended , by their use . Homeowners shoot at intruders , car owners shoot at thieves , property_owners shoot at trespassers . . . and grocery_store owners shoot at kids who steal orange_juice and cookies . No one will ever know whether Kim actually feared for his life or was trying , in his way , to teach a lesson . Give him the benefit of the doubt . He was in a state of terror . But I can ' t help wondering what would have happened to me those many years ago had similar conditions existed . Would Fred Barnes have armed himself , pursued me and shot me dead when I lunged at him ? I doubt it . We were a different world back then , less prone to cause pain and more inclined to weigh the value of a human life against the loss of a grocery product . Barnes took my name , but never turned me in . I lived_in fear for weeks that he might , and the fear stamped its message on my life . The grocer taught a lesson without a shot being fired . You didn ' t shoot a kid over a bag of doughnuts back then . Sadly , things have changed . Michael Kim and Aldo Vega , thrust together in the context of petty crime and excessive punishment , will symbolize that change for a long_time to come .</TEXT>
