   <HEADLINE> FEUDING KURDISH FACTIONS SWALLOW PRIDE , TALK PEACE ; IRAQ : FIGHTING PLACED WESTERN AGENCIES PROTECTING KURDS FROM SADDAM HUSSEIN IN AN AWKWARD POSITION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Feasting away their differences in a gloomy northern Iraq hotel , the leaders of Iraq ' s two feuding Kurdish armies embraced and held their first talks Sunday on ending a five-week conflict that has deeply embarrassed the Western forces and aid agencies protecting their enclave from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . But first it took a bearhug from a dissident Iraqi general to force a reluctant Masoud Barzani to embrace his rival , Jalal Talabani . The two men , however , agreed to further peace measures and expressed their hopes that fighting among the separatist rebels that has killed up_to 400 people is now over . &quot; Our relationship is stronger than a kiss , &quot; Talabani quipped before standing with his rival at the head of a long table loaded with rice , kebabs , chicken and stews for the feast that traditionally signifies the end of Kurdish blood_feuds . &quot; We want to consolidate peace and to restore our alliance and our struggle against dictatorship. &quot; Both factions in the fight for a separate nation have blamed each other for the infighting , but tensions were clearly aggravated by Talabani ' s recent absence abroad . Since his return by a Turkish helicopter Thursday , he has given his blessing to a peace process that has brought a cease-fire and troop withdrawals from front_lines . But distrust remains . &quot; It ' s crazy . The two sides are only about as different as Coke and Pepsi-Cola , &quot; said a senior Western relief official , venting his anger at what he called a senseless internal power struggle that had set the Kurdish cause back at a time when Western donors are beginning to discuss next year ' s $ 288-million aid program for Iraq . Most of that goes_to the 3.5 million people of northern Iraq , and much of the money has come_out of U.S. military coffers -- $ 65.6 million in the fiscal_year 1992 , $ 61 million in 1993 and a planned $ 139 million in 1994 , said Harry Houck , the local representative of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance . But the fighting has also been of concern to the United States , which is worried that the squabbling might encourage Hussein to attack . American visits to the Kurdish heartlands have also been restricted since a tragic &quot; friendly fire &quot; incident over northern Iraq in April in which U.S. planes shot down two U.S. helicopters , killing all 26 allied officers on board . So far , the Iraqi president has made no military moves and seems to have been ready to wait for the Kurds to collapse on_their_own , according to sources in the allied Operation Provide Comfort . The Turkish-based force brought the Iraqi Kurds home after they fled Hussein ' s vengeful armies to the mountains of Turkey and Iran after the Gulf War in 1991 and has protected them ever since . Sunday ' s peace talks between the Kurdish rivals have helped mend the damage done_in the latest fighting , although the Kurdish area is now badly divided . Talabani ' s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan now controls most of the eastern region of Sulaymaniyah , while Barzani ' s Kurdistan Democratic Party controls the western region of Dahuk . Both contest parts of central Irbil and three areas close to the Iranian border , where pro-Iranian Islamists have been advancing and the cease-fire has yet to take_hold . Even the talks in central Irbil had tense moments . Just as Talabani ' s limousine crunched to a halt outside the Shireen Palace Hotel , a stray shot rang_out . Heavily armed guerrillas leaped to battle stations . Bloodshed was averted by the soldiers of the Iraqi National Congress , the umbrella organization of groups opposed to Hussein . The soldiers ' commander , Capt . Mohammed , a Shiite Muslim from Baghdad , stood among the guerrillas in the middle of the square , waving his arms and shouting that nothing was wrong . The Kurds may have damaged their reputation with the recent fighting , but the Iraqi National Congress has won credit . The congress ' s leader , Ahmed Chalab , did the most to mediate peace between the Kurds . His 750-man force of Iraqi army defectors is now also successfully securing most of the roads between areas controlled by the rival Kurdish groups . Their flag of three interlocking circles , representing the Sunni , Shiite and Kurdish communities of Iraq , has become a common and respected sight . &quot; I ' d never seen it before , this fighting . We didn ' t know they had a disciplined army like this . We ' re proud_of them , &quot; said Ismail Aziz , 31 , a Kurdish movie_theater employee watching the congress soldiers who handled the guerrillas milling outside the hotel .</TEXT>
