   <HEADLINE> SERB SOFTENING SEEN IN VISIT BY MEDIATORS ; BOSNIA : RUSSIA ' S SPECIAL ENVOY IS ALSO RECEIVED . HE SAYS REBELS PROMISED TO END THE SIEGE OF GORAZDE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the first signs that Bosnian Serbs may relax their campaign of belligerence that followed NATO air strikes , two Western mediators were received by rebel leaders Wednesday , and Russia ' s special envoy said he had won a Serbian promise to end the siege of Gorazde . Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S . Churkin clattered in a grimy armored personnel_carrier between this government-held capital and the rebel stronghold in Pale , 10 miles to the east , in an effort to get Bosnian peace talks back on track . &quot; I think I ' ve got a commitment from the Serbs that it ' s not their intention to resume fighting , to attack , to take Gorazde or to shell the town , &quot; Churkin said after briefing U.N. military and Western diplomatic officials on his talks with Serbian leaders in Pale . Churkin was the only foreign mediator allowed across rebel siege lines a day earlier , when Serbs angered by the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization bombings of their tank positions in Gorazde put_up booby_traps and barricades around U.N. encampments to make hostages of the peacekeepers . After long talks with Serbian leaders in Pale , Churkin spoke optimistically about the prospects for a cease-fire in Gorazde and added that he could also foresee a truce covering all_of Bosnia-Herzegovina to allow the Muslim-led government and Serbian nationalists to work_out details of an ethnic division . Despite describing the situation in Gorazde as tense , the Russian special envoy to the Balkans said there was understanding on both sides of the conflict &quot; that in_order to move onto other fronts , on other issues , we need to be sure about the situation in Gorazde. &quot; He declined to say whether Serbian rebel leader Radovan Karadzic or the hard-line military commander , Gen . Ratko Mladic , was willing to withdraw to the lines they held around Gorazde before this latest offensive , as ordered by U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali . Serbs have captured about 15 % of the U.N. &quot; safe haven &quot; since March 30 in an offensive that torpedoed cease-fire talks and prompted the U.N. commander for Bosnia , British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , to call_for NATO air strikes on Sunday and Monday . The Serbs have threatened to shoot_down NATO warplanes and have condemned the U.N. mission as an enemy . A marked increase in sniping from Serbian positions was also noted Wednesday ; at least four large-caliber shells detonated in Sarajevo , representing the worst cease-fire violations in nearly two months . Senior U.N. officials and Charles Redman , the U.S. special envoy , had planned to visit Pale on Tuesday to discuss the standoff with the Serbian leaders but were informed by telephone that they would not be welcome . But two diplomats who spent 16 months trying to broker a peace settlement in Geneva were allowed across the armed checkpoints that separate government and rebel territory . &quot; They know us . I think they want to keep peace negotiations going , &quot; said Lord Owen , the European Union mediator for the mothballed Geneva talks . Owen and his U.N. partner in the peace talks , former Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg , planned to return to Sarajevo today after overnighting in Pale . More_than 200 # 000 Bosnians , mostly Muslim civilians , are dead or missing due_to fighting and &quot; ethnic cleansing. &quot; In Gorazde , Fahrudin Bazic , a local official reached via ham radio from Zagreb , Croatia , said the situation remained desperate . But he said residents ' spirits were lifted after the NATO attacks . &quot; People are absolutely satisfied with air strikes and want more air strikes as long as tanks are_on the outskirts of town , &quot; he said , adding : &quot; The mood among the people is that they are prepared to defend , to the last , what they ' ve got . There had been some doubt before any sort of NATO intervention . But in the last two days , the two interventions improved the mood of the people in the city . Trust has returned ( in ) the world community and the world order , the U.S. and the rest. &quot; Times special correspondent Danica Kirka in Zagreb contributed to this report . REVOLTS</TEXT>
