   <HEADLINE> SENTENCE REDUCED FOR SINGER ' S GIRLFRIEND ; COURTS : JUDGE ACTED BECAUSE RICK JAMES , CONVICTED OF MORE SERIOUS CRIMES , WOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED SOONER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Expressing resentment that he was forced to do so by a possible scandal in the district_attorney ' s office , a judge Friday reduced from four years to two the prison sentence imposed on the girlfriend of funk singer Rick James for assaulting a woman during a drug party . Van Nuys Superior_Court Judge Michael R . Hoff originally sentenced Tanya Anne Hijazi , 23 , after she pleaded guilty to one count of assaulting Mary Sauger in the St . James ' s Club &amp; Hotel in West Hollywood in 1992 . Hoff said he felt compelled to reduce the sentence , which would have kept Hijazi in custody until late 1995 , because James , who was sentenced to a drug rehabilitation_program , will probably be released this fall , although he was found guilty of more serious offenses than Hijazi for the same incidents . &quot; that ' s intolerable , &quot; Hoff said as he read a prepared statement . &quot; It would n ' t be fair to Ms . Hijazi or to our system of justice. &quot; Leonard B . Levine , Hijazi ' s attorney , said that under the new sentence , he hopes to see her released in August . The judge sentenced James last month to five years and four months in prison , but this term was stayed when he was admitted to the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco . If James successfully completes the 8 1 / 2-month treatment program , he will be released on parole . James , the self-proclaimed &quot; King of Funk &quot; best known for the 1981 hit &quot; Super Freak , &quot; is engaged to Hijazi and they have a 21-month-old son . Echoing author Charles Dickens , Hoff said recent events in the case have shown him &quot; the best of times and the worst of times. &quot; James ' light sentence and the reduction of Hijazi ' s prison_term come_in the wake of an investigation into what sources close to the case said are allegations of misconduct by an investigator in the district_attorney ' s office . &quot; I ' m very troubled by this entire case , and in particular the recent events which have brought us here , &quot; Hoff said , referring to what he called &quot; the criminal investigation &quot; and James ' &quot; good_fortune and luck. &quot; The probe is focusing_on the possibility that the investigator , who did not work_on the James case , provided drugs to Michelle Allen , one of three women who testified against James , according to sources close to the case . Allen , who was in custody on theft charges and was not named as a victim , testified to bolster the prosecution ' s contention that James chronically abused women . Hoff said he was also disappointed that a gag order he issued to protect the investigation has been violated , leading to news accounts of the alleged misconduct . However , &quot; there is a very bright_side to this horrible situation , &quot; Hoff said . The judge made_it clear that the prosecutor in the case , Deputy Dist . Atty . Andrew Flier , acted with a &quot; high degree of personal integrity and honesty &quot; and in no way was accused of misconduct . Prosecutors , saying they had a case fraught with difficulties and that the two victims did not want to testify again , agreed to the sentencing deal under which James is expected to be freed this year -- even though he faced the possibility of life in prison if he were convicted in a second trial on charges the jury was unable to resolve during a first trial . While the case has now been tainted by the investigation , Hoff reminded everyone that in &quot; the simplest terms , this case is about cocaine , abuse and assaultive behavior toward women. &quot; On the day she and James were set to go_on trial , Hijazi pleaded guilty to assault . In exchange for her plea , prosecutors dropped a dozen other charges that carried a potential life sentence . Meanwhile , James went_to trial and was convicted on Sept . 17 of assaulting and imprisoning Sauger , 35 . While he was acquitted on several charges , the jury deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of guilt on six charges , including two counts of torture . As part of the deal that saw him go_into a drug treatment program instead of prison , James also pleaded guilty of assaulting a second woman at his Hollywood Hills home_in 1991 . &quot; Truly and undoubtedly , his crimes were the result of his crack cocaine_addiction , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Stephen L . Cooley , who supervised the prosecution and defended the decision to support drug treatment over prison . Defense_attorney Levine characterized Hijazi as a victim who also received beatings from James . &quot; I ' m glad that she ' s not going_to be incarcerated longer than Rick , &quot; said Hijazi ' s mother , Susanne Shapiro . &quot; I think the judge was very fair , &quot; she said . &quot; It gives me a little more faith in the criminal justice system. &quot;</TEXT>
