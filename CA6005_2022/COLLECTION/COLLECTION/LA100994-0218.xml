   <HEADLINE> WHAT U.S. CONGRESS SHOULD DO TO KEEP OUR STREETS SAFE ; THE COMPREHENSIVE AND EFFECTIVE ANTI-CRIME ACT RECENTLY PASSED SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE THAT VIOLENT CRIME WILL NOT BE TOLERATED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The most fundamental right that government owes its citizens is personal safety . This summer , Congress took an important step_in protecting that right by passing the toughest and most effective federal anti-crime measure ever . The Violent Crime Control and Law_Enforcement Act will go_a_long_way toward helping the states and local_governments make streets and neighborhoods safer , increasing their ability to enforce our laws and to punish those who commit violent crimes . Although law_enforcement is and should remain primarily a state and local responsibility , the severity of the crisis warrants federal assistance . This comprehensive act will help provide : * One hundred_thousand more police_officers in our neighborhoods . Grants will help provide 20 % more cops patrolling neighborhoods , responding to community concerns and getting criminals off the streets . Putting more police in_troubled neighborhoods is the most effective way the federal_government can help make neighborhoods crime-free . * More police_officers with better education and training . A new Police Corps program will provide college scholarships for students who agree to serve as law_enforcement officers for at least four years . Scholarships will be available to men and women already serving as police_officers . * More federal crime fighters . The Border_Patrol will hire 4 # 000 more agents over the next four years . The bill also provides_for hundreds of additional agents at the Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Agency . The law also requires tougher sentences for violent criminals and more prisons to put them in : * &quot; Three-Strikes-and-You ' re-Out &quot; will keep career violent offenders in prison . The law mandates life imprisonment for anyone convicted of a third violent felony when the last one is a federal offense . Statistics indicate that a very small percentage of criminals account_for a large percentage of violent crimes -- and that they spend shockingly little time in jail . * States will receive $ 9 billion to keep violent criminals behind bars and to repay the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens . Grants will help states build necessary prisons . A large portion of those funds are for states that impose rigorous standards for jailing violent offenders . As the result of an amendment I offered to the bill , $ 1.8 billion of these funds will be used to reimburse states and local_governments for the costs of imprisoning criminal illegal aliens . California will receive the largest single payment , meaning a savings to California taxpayers of about $ 750 million . * Juveniles will be punished according to the crimes they commit . For the first time , offenders as young as 13 can be tried as adults for certain violent crimes if the prosecutor and the presiding judge agree . Alternative incarceration approaches for juveniles , such_as boot camps to provide discipline and training , are also a part of the new law . * Drug offenders will receive substance-abuse treatment . To help reduce the number of people incarcerated for nonviolent crimes , special Drug Court programs will provide rehabilitation and close monitoring of first-time or nonviolent drug offenders . More federal and state inmates will receive intensive treatment during their incarceration . At least 60 % of violent crime is associated with drug use . Addicts commit 15 times as_many robberies and 20 times as_many burglaries as criminals not on drugs . Approximately 70 % of the nation ' s 1.4 million prisoners have drug problems , but only 1 % of federal inmates and about 15 % of state prisoners receive adequate treatment . Properly run prison-based anti-drug programs have produced good results : The rearrest rate for prisoners who undertake them is about one-third the rate for those who do not . And treatment in prison is a bargain . Housing one inmate one year costs $ 28 # 000 ; adding full drug treatment , about $ 3 # 000 . Finally , the new law provides more prevention to stop crime before it happens : * Assault weapons and gun sales to juveniles are banned . The bill bans 19 semiautomatic weapons -- the weapons of choice of drug dealers , gang members and mass murderers . It also prohibits sales of guns to minors and prohibits minors from carrying handguns . * Young people will be steered away from crime and gang membership . To deter children and youths living_in high-crime areas from embarking upon a life of crime , intensive programs are established or expanded to educate youths , find them jobs and provide sports activities and other programs . * Efforts to stop domestic violence will be expanded . Additional federal resources will be available to combat sexual and domestic violence through education , law_enforcement training and a national domestic violence hot_line . Gender-based violence will now be a federal civil-rights violation . Understandably , crime remains the No . 1 concern for most Americans . While local and state_governments remain responsible , as they should , for enforcing most of our criminal_laws , it is entirely appropriate that the federal_government make additional resources available and send a strong message that violent crime will not be tolerated . The $ 30 billion that Congress has just voted is an appropriate and measured response to the widely held belief that this is a problem that we need to attack with all our resources .</TEXT>
