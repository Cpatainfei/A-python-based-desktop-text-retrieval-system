   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER : ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; DATELINE / LILLEHAMMER ; JANSEN ' S GOLD_RUSH REDUCES CYNICS TO SOFTIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sportswriters are not a particularly disciplined lot . Cynical , yes ; disciplined , no . But there is one rule they generally follow : No cheering in the press_box . So what was that outburst Friday afternoon among the cynics in the main press center here ? It sounded remarkably like a cheer . In fact , it sounded remarkably like the cheer that resounded one February Friday night in 1980 at Lake Placid , N.Y. Fourteen years ago , the cheer was for the U.S. hockey_team , which had just beaten the heavily favored Soviets on its remarkable journey to a gold medal . This time , the cheer was for Dan Jansen , who had just completed his own remarkable journey to a gold medal . Sometimes , even the no-cheering rule doesn ' t apply . If ever there was a gold-medal kid , it ' s Jansen . Genuine , down-home friendly , the world ' s best sprinter for the last decade or so , he had won everything worth winning in speedskating except an Olympic medal . And his Olympic failures had been spectacular . Twice in 1988 , when he skated as a tribute to his sister , who had just died of leukemia , he fell . In 1992 , he skated too cautiously in one race and ran_out of gas in the other . And Monday , while on a world-record pace , he had bobbled again in his specialty , the 500-meter race . So when Jansen toed the starting_line in Hamar , for the last time in four Olympics , the cynics harbored no illusions . &quot; I can ' t watch , &quot; one said , turning_away . &quot; You can ' t not watch , &quot; said another . &quot; It ' s like witnessing a car accident. &quot; &quot; Which corner do you think it will be ? &quot; asked the biggest cynic of all . Then Jansen was off , skates flashing , again on a world-record pace . The cynics held their breath . When he bobbled again slightly , it happened so fast that nobody knew how close to disaster he had come until they showed the replays . And only a little more_than a minute after he had set_off , Jansen roared across the finish_line , the record and the gold medal his . Finally . that ' s when the cheering erupted . And later , when Jansen stood teary-eyed on the winner ' s podium , gold medal around his neck , &quot; The Star Spangled Banner &quot; playing , he wasn ' t the only one who was teary-eyed .
