   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : HUNTINGTON BEACH ; CITY FOR CITY WORKER RETIREMENT TARGETED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A residents group is working to abolish a special tax that costs property_owners about $ 6.3 million a year to pay retirement_benefits of city employees . City employees now pay nothing toward their retirement_benefits . Instead , the city pays 14 % of each employee ' s salary amount into the retirement_fund , and much of that money comes from the special property_tax . &quot; We are outraged about the extravagant retirement_benefits paid entirely by taxpayers , &quot; said Jim L . Banks , 41 , an attorney who is heading the petition drive . &quot; While people are losing their jobs or having their pay and benefits severely cut , there have been no pay or benefit cuts for Huntington Beach city employees. &quot; The petition by Citizens Against Retirement Tax , which consists_of about 20 residents , would require most employees to pay 7 % of their current pay_for retirement_benefits , with the city contributing 7 % . Police , firefighters and lifeguards would pay 9 % of their salaries , with the city paying 14 % . Banks two weeks ago asked the City_Council to vote to put the retirement tax on the ballot . They have not responded , Banks said , but Councilman David Sullivan said he is studying the request . &quot; I am , of course , greatly concerned that Huntington Beach is the only city in Orange County that has a retirement tax , &quot; Sullivan said . The rate for the tax is about $ 50 per $ 100 # 000 assessed valuation . Deputy City Administrator Bob Franz said Huntington Beach is one of 43 cities in California with the retirement tax . But Huntington Beach has no property_taxes for sewers , lighting , landscaping and libraries , which some cities have , he said . Franz said that until the 1970s , employees paid half of their retirement costs . But one year the city agreed to pay full retirement costs if employees would forgo a pay raise that year . The arrangement has continued ever since . Employees have treated it &quot; as a God-given right and refused to settle contracts for anything less , &quot; Banks said . Banks and other volunteers are attempting to collect about 16 # 000 signatures to force a citywide vote on the retirement tax in November . &quot; I ' ve talked to people living_in Huntington Beach 20 to 30 years , and 99 % of them don ' t know about it , &quot; Banks said .
