   <HEADLINE> U.S. EXPERTS VOICE HOPE ABOUT RUSSIA ; REFORMS : TREASURY OFFICIALS EXPRESS OPTIMISM AS HYPER-INFLATION SLOWS . INTERNATIONAL LOANS , CREDITS AND GRANTS ARE CITED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As President Clinton begins his first official visit to Moscow , his Administration views the coming days as a make-or-break period for the massive reform being undertaken across Russia . &quot; This is a critical juncture for the Russian government , &quot; Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said here after a day of private meetings with Russian leaders and diplomats from the Group of Seven nations . &quot; Major decisions are being made in the next few days. &quot; He was referring to the political and economic turning point at which Russia finds itself in the aftermath of last month ' s parliamentary elections , which gave_rise to an ultranationalist wing under the leadership of Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , and to current attempts to form a new government . The U.S. Treasury officials who preceded Clinton to Moscow -- the President meets today and Friday with President Boris N . Yeltsin -- were unusually upbeat about the prospects for long-term reform and about the current state of Russia ' s chaotic economy . Encouraged by an inflation_rate down from roughly 30 % a month -- bordering_on hyper-inflation -- last spring to the current rate of about 12 % , officials spoke optimistically , if vaguely , about reaching agreement with their Group of Seven aid partners on a program of further support . The group of leading industrial democracies is currently administering a $ 43-billion program of loans , credits and grants , about half of which have been disbursed . No major new U.S. program is anticipated . At stake , one senior Treasury official said , is whether Russia will continue to develop a market-oriented economy or revert to the central government control that prevailed under communism . U.S. officials are watching to see at what pace privatization proceeds , how the government budget_deficit is tackled and whether the flow of central_bank credits to industry is reduced . It remains unclear whether a reshuffled Cabinet will lead Russia in a decisive new direction or will continue to swerve between such stringent economic reforms as ending government support for unprofitable businesses and keeping the subsidies flowing to hold_down unemployment . Arriving in the icy darkness of the Moscow morning after an overnight flight from Washington , Bentsen led the advance party for the Clinton_Administration ' s most sensitive international economic foray to date . He met with Anatoly B . Chubais , the deputy prime_minister responsible_for the government campaign to convert the economy resulting from seven decades of state-controlled communism to a market-oriented one based on private enterprise . Yeltsin ' s task of driving the Russian nation through this unguided intersection clearly has Clinton_Administration officials energized -- and concerned . In their view , the economy now is in better shape than in the past to withstand the rigors of shedding inefficient state-supported industries . But even more_than in the past , there is anxiety about whether the Russian people , fearful that the reform process will leave them literally out_in the Russian cold , will go_along . &quot; We think the economic situation in Russia is better than it is widely seen , &quot; said a senior Treasury official who has spent much of the past year monitoring developments here . &quot; The privatization has made substantial progress. &quot; By U.S. count , 40 % of the employees in Russian industry are working for companies that are now part of the private sector , and 70 % of the employees in small retail operations are working for private companies . This , however , is not to suggest that the largest economic challenges have been met : Industrial production has fallen deeply -- partly as a result of the drop_in the manufacturing of military hardware but also due_to reduced output in non-defense areas . The value of the ruble in_relation_to the dollar has been unsteady , and it is uncertain whether a recent stabilization will hold . And even though inflation has fallen sharply from a mind-boggling rate of 2 # 500 % a year , it is still running at nearly 300 % . Sounding just like his colleagues in Washington whose domain is the U.S. federal budget , the senior Treasury official said : &quot; The key to the Russian economy is the Russian budget . What Russia needs is to make less resort_to inflationary finance &quot; -- the printing of rubles to meet the budgetary needs of inefficient state-run enterprises -- while still spending_money to help pensioners and to fund unemployment insurance . U.S. officials are reluctant to predict when the next budget will be completed -- a wariness born of_their_own experience pushing a budget through a Congress more compliant than the Parliament that Yeltsin faces . But they say it is one of the crucial tasks facing the post-election government now being formed . One private analyst in Washington who has spent 30 years studying the Russian economy estimated that roughly $ 10 billion -- about 7 % of Russia ' s gross_national_product -- will be needed for unemployment insurance for one year . During their meetings with Yeltsin , the senior Treasury official said , the U.S. officials will focus_on specific programs of U.S. and international support for economic reform ; efforts to tailor those programs to meet Russia ' s social-service needs , and trade issues . And they will review problems in existing aid programs , including those created to make nearly $ 700 million available in loans to develop energy and for unemployment assistance . The loans include $ 70 million in World_Bank funds for Russian employment projects built around closing inefficient factories whose subsidies drain the national budget . The international funds are available , but they have not been drawn upon because there is a lack of agreement in Russia ' s government on how to design an unemployment program . There is some concern in the government that such outside support creates the impression that Moscow is yielding to Western pressure to throw people out_of_work . Bentsen on Wednesday announced the appointment of Michael Gillette , a senior World_Bank staff_member , to head a group intended to push such support through the Russian pipeline -- a position that Clinton and Yeltsin agreed last April must be filled speedily . As the winter has progressed , the United States has found itself at_odds with international funding agencies over how closely to link financial_aid to progress in economic reform . As reforms to make industries more efficient bring increases in unemployment , which is officially listed as 1.5 % but is believed by private analysts to be closer to 10 % , U.S. officials have called_for relaxation of the strict standards . Indeed , a representative of an international financial_institution in Moscow said in an interview that Russia ' s needs meant that it could not be held to the same standards applied to other nations when they seek loans . Characterizing the problem as &quot; the ' Jurassic Park ' syndrome , &quot; he said : &quot; A zoo is a zoo , but it ' s a lot more difficult to manage when the animals are dinosaurs than when they ' re zebras , tigers , giraffes . that ' s what distinguishes Russia from Ghana , Bolivia. &quot; Times staff writer Richard Boudreaux contributed to this report .</TEXT>
