   <HEADLINE> DISCORD ALONG THE BORDER ; TRADE : MEXICAN SHOPPERS AND U.S. RETAILERS SAY MEXICO ' S CURRENT ENFORCEMENT OF $ 50 CUSTOMS LIMIT VIOLATES SPIRIT OF NAFTA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Andy Carrasco walked across the U.S.-Mexico border_on the way to the big Vons grocery_store here knowing that , for all_the talk_of lowered trade_barriers between the two countries , he can only buy $ 50 worth of duty-free groceries this trip . &quot; Free_trade agreement ? What free_trade agreement ? &quot; wondered Carrasco , a Tijuana resident who makes two or three weekly shopping trips across the border here 18 miles south of downtown San Diego . &quot; I ' m buying fewer things and paying more taxes. &quot; Carrasco and countless other Mexican shoppers are furious over the newly toughened enforcement of a $ 50 limit imposed by Mexican customs on U.S. goods they can buy . It ' s a ceiling they say violates the spirit of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement and contrasts painfully with the $ 400 limit that Americans enjoy when they go_on sprees to Mexico . Also incensed are retailers along from the 2 # 000-mile U.S.-Mexico border , from McAllen , Tex. , to Calexico and San Ysidro , where a decades-long dependency on cross-border shoppers from Mexico has been disrupted . Downtown retailers in Laredo , Tex. , for example , report sales have fallen more_than 20 % in two years . &quot; It ' s harassment , &quot; said Tony Tirado , former mayor of Calexico , and a vocal opponent of the limit . Lionel Flores , a manager at Shermo electronics store in San Ysidro , less than a mile from the border , said : &quot; We ' ve lost about 70 % of our business . We ' re going to change locations. &quot; Although the $ 50 limit per shopping trip has been law in Mexico for decades , Mexican customs only began enforcing the limit in late 1992 , and shoppers and U.S. retailers say the enforcement has become tougher and the penalties harsher in recent months . The protests came_to a head in late August when Charles S . Meissner , assistant U.S. commerce_secretary for international economic_policy , met personally with retailers in McAllen and Brownsville , Tex. , and then lodged a formal complaint with the Mexican government . He asked Mexico to bring the limit more nearly in_line with the $ 400 maximum on what U.S. tourists can bring_in from foreign countries . Last week , Mexico ' s president-elect , Ernesto Zedillo , weighed in on the flap , promising to review the $ 50 limitation because it has become a &quot; source of irritation &quot; with residents of both countries . &quot; Somehow it has to be addressed , &quot; Zedillo told an interviewer . The customs limits were not addressed directly in NAFTA , the free_trade agreement that went_into effect Jan . 1 and which is designed to break_down tariff barriers between the two countries over the next 20 years . Meissner characterized the tiff as one of several post-NAFTA &quot; glitches , &quot; and said U.S. and Mexican commerce officials have begun meeting monthly to discuss trade problems in the wake of NAFTA ' s enactment Jan . 1 . The timing of the toughened enforcement as NAFTA was being implemented is puzzling to some , but a spokeswoman for the Mexican finance ministry said the enforcement began when it did simply because the technology with which to enforce it was finally put_in place at various border crossings . But some border businessmen see political motives , speculating that the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari wanted to appease political patrons who own retail operations in Mexican border states and to wean Mexican shoppers from U.S.-made goods that , despite freer_trade , are either unavailable or priced too high in Mexico . Others say it is part of a concerted effort to stamp_out contrabando hormiga , Mexico ' s huge , illicit flea-market industry . For decades , Mexican retailers or their hirelings have crossed the border to buy U.S. retail goods and then cart them back for resale at prices that legitimate Mexican retailers can ' t match -- in_effect using U.S. retailers as wholesalers . The industry had grown so big that Mexican authorities , content for years to look the other way as loads of Levis , athletic shoes and hardware were brought across the border , decided to clamp_down to recover the huge amounts of sales taxes it was losing . Meissner said the Mexican government is addressing a &quot; legitimate problem in that many small Mexican retailers were coming_across the border and buying $ 500 to $ 1 # 000 worth of blue_jeans or shirts , &quot; and reselling them in Mexico . A spokeswoman with Mexico ' s Hacienda , the finance ministry , defends the limit by noting that Mexicans actually can buy more duty-free goods in the United States than the other way around , since Americans ' duty-free limit of $ 400 on purchases in Mexico and in other foreign countries is monthly , not daily . Mexicans can make as_many shopping forays as they want , as long as they observe the $ 50-per-trip limit . As a practical matter , however , the $ 400-per-month duty-free limit on U.S. shoppers is loosely enforced , as U.S. Customs has little way of keeping track of shoppers ' monthly allowances as long as they declare less than $ 400 worth of purchases per trip . Longtime observers of the border economy such_as Gerald Schwebel , a Laredo bank executive and past chairman of an association of businesses called Border Trade Alliance , hope NAFTA will eventually eliminate the need for strict customs limits , as U.S. retailers over time are able to freely distribute the goods in Mexico that Mexican consumers so obviously want to buy on this side . &quot; It ' s a big deal when you realize that the retail industry remains the largest employer in the border area , &quot; Schwebel said . &quot; Stores all along the border area are reducing operations because of the loss of sales. &quot; Alfredo Lopez , who owns a computer repair_shop in Tijuana , said as he strolled toward the shops in San Ysidro that Mexican officials know &quot; nothing about life on the border &quot; -- how the economies are interdependent , how the cost_of_living in Tijuana parallels that of San Diego , and how much of a burden the 33 % import_duties represent . Whether or not the $ 50 limit is ultimately relaxed , the Mexican government for now is cracking_down on the limit , confiscating goods over the legal amount that are not declared and impounding the automobiles of shoppers who fail to declare excess amounts , according to Mexican shoppers interviewed in San Ysidro . &quot; They treat you like a thief when you cross , &quot; said Maria Flores , a Tijuana resident interviewed as she walked back to the Mexican border carrying her weekly purchase of two bags of groceries . &quot; I used to buy a little dress for $ 30 or $ 40 in addition to the groceries , but I ' m afraid to now. &quot;</TEXT>
