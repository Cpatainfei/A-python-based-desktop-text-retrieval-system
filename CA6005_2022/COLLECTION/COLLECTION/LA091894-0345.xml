   <HEADLINE> U.S. WEIGHING CONTROVERSIAL BORDER CROSSING FEE , RENO SAYS ; CHECKPOINTS : IN BEVERLY HILLS SPEECH , SHE UNVEILS PROGRAM TO CLOSE ' REVOLVING DOOR FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. Atty . Gen . Janet Reno announced Saturday that a controversial proposal to impose fees for crossing the Mexican border is under serious consideration by the Justice_Department . Reno ' s comments came during a Beverly Hills address in which she unveiled a federal program designed to close California ' s &quot; revolving door for illegal immigrants. &quot; The program , dubbed Operation Gatekeeper , will : * Use hundreds of new and redeployed federal officers to patrol the Mexican border -- a move that will result in at least temporary closure of a busy inland immigration checkpoint at San Clemente . * Institute an automated fingerprinting system to catch criminal immigrants and track habitual illegal immigrants . * Increase fencing and lighting at the San Diego border . &quot; The days when the border served as a revolving door for illegal immigrants are over , &quot; Reno told a receptive Town_Hall audience at the Beverly Hilton Hotel . She also said Operation Gatekeeper includes plans to send federal funds to California to help cover the costs of incarcerating criminal illegal immigrants . But those funds were already called_for under the new federal crime bill . Perhaps the most controversial element of Reno ' s speech involved something not included in_Operation Gatekeeper -- the proposal to impose border crossing fees . Although it would take an act of Congress to implement such fees , Reno stated : &quot; We are seriously considering implementing a . . . crossing fee similar to fees already collected at all airports . &quot; Later this month , the Commission on Immigration Reform . . . plans to recommend the initiation of such a fee , &quot; she added . Funds from the fees , Reno said , would be used to patrol the border and for expenses connected with legal crossings . Such fees -- $ 1 per crossing is often recommended -- have been the subject of heated debate for more_than a decade . Critics maintain that such a border tariff could actually increase illegal entries by people who can ' t afford to pay . It has also been suggested that immigration officials would be too busy exchanging dollars for pesos to concentrate_on more important duties . Instituting such a fee could also require delicate negotiations with Mexico , critics say . Nevertheless , border fees are attractive to Republican and Democratic members of Congress , who are seeking new sources of income to meet border-related costs . Sen . Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) proposed such a fee last year and rejected criticism as &quot; tired bureaucratic responses. &quot; It has been estimated that a crossing charge of $ 1 would raise about $ 400 million a year , said Doris Meissner , commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service , who accompanied Reno in Los Angeles and on an afternoon visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego . Operation Gatekeeper also calls_for a pilot_project that will close the controversial checkpoint at San Clemente as soon as next week and move most of the 95 agents who operate the station to San Diego . Most of the 70 officers who operate another such checkpoint at Temecula will also be reassigned to the border under the pilot_project . It was not immediately clear whether the post at Temecula will remain open . &quot; What we want to do is a sensible evaluation that shows how the people deployed at checkpoints could be used most effectively , &quot; Reno said . The checkpoints have long been the focus of criticism from civil libertarians , local residents and commuters . Even many immigration officials say the agents would be_better deployed at the border . Support for the checkpoints ' continued operation has come mainly from immigration officers for whom inland stations represent promotion opportunities and an alternative to grueling border duty . The shift of agents from San Clemente and Temecula represents a major step toward the potential phasing out of one or both checkpoints , Justice_Department officials said Saturday . A final_decision could come_before the end of the year , they said . Political pressure for the border buildup has resulted partly from the success of a &quot; blockade &quot; in El Paso , where a show of force along the Rio Grande has dramatically cut illegal crossing . In contrast , San Diego agents will be deployed in three &quot; tiers &quot; -- a lower-profile strategy that officials hope will prove effective while avoiding violence at the volatile Tijuana line . Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown , who had recommended redeployment of the checkpoint agents to help on the border , said Operation Gatekeeper is &quot; a step_in the right direction. &quot; Brown ' s opponent , Republican Gov . Pete Wilson , has sought to portray her as soft_on illegal immigration . However , in a statement issued after Reno ' s speech , she tried to counter that image : &quot; It is time we take strong steps to stop the flow of illegal immigrants. &quot; Wilson had nothing good to say about Reno ' s plan , commenting through a spokesman that it was a &quot; Band-Aid for a hemorrhage. &quot; Wilson Press Secretary Sean Walsh said incarcerating criminal illegal immigrants costs California $ 475 million a year , while the state will receive only a share of the $ 130 million earmarked for all states that incur such expenses . In response to a question about Proposition 187 , which would deny public education and health_care to illegal immigrants , Reno said : &quot; I look_at the children of America and the children in_trouble and it doesn ' t solve the problems by denying them health_care , it doesn ' t solve the problems by denying them counseling and it doesn ' t solve the problems by denying them education. &quot;</TEXT>
