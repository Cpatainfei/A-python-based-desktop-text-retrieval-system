   <HEADLINE> CULTURE ; HERMITAGE SINKING UNDER LAX SECURITY ; RUSSIA ' S FAMOUS ART MUSEUM IS PILLAGED BY VANDALS AND WORKERS ALIKE AND UNDERMINED BY RIVERBANK SOIL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the world ' s greatest museums was nearly destroyed a_few months ago by a forgotten cup_of_tea . A worker in the fabric section of the Hermitage ' s Russian History_Department had plugged_in an electric tea kettle but then forgot about it . The water boiled away , the kettle burned_up , the curtains caught_fire , and suddenly the Hermitage -- home of Rembrandt and Rodin , Matisse and Manet , Scythian gold and Egyptian sarcophagi -- was in mortal danger . The alarm and sprinkler_system wasn ' t yet fully installed -- it still isn ' t -- so no warning sounded as flames crept closer to a dress owned by Czarina Catherine the Great . Smoke pouring from the window finally alerted a passerby ; luckily , he was a former museum security officer and knew whom to call . Museum firefighters quickly put_out the blaze . The half-finished sprinkler_system did eventually work , but for no good . It kicked on without cause one night , pouring more_than 100 tons of water into the newly restored Hermitage Theater . Both events underline what many specialists here call a disgracefully lax security_system for the Hermitage ' s wondrous 3-million-piece art_collection . Perhaps just as alarming about the two mishaps is how the museum ' s leadership reacted . For Alexander Baturin , head of security at the Hermitage , the fire is proof that all is working wonderfully . Baturin proudly states that &quot; one of our guys &quot; noticed the smoke and called it in smartly . Mikhail Piotrovsky , director of the Hermitage , has a different take . He accuses the press of sensationalizing the fire . Never mind that the incident has been mentioned in print just once in Russia , at the bottom of a 39-paragraph story in the St . Petersburg Bulletin . As for the sprinkler malfunction , well , Piotrovsky explains , that ' s Finland ' s fault . The sprinkler_system is Finnish-made and Finnish-installed , he says , &quot; so this has been a lesson to us , a reminder that the West brings us as much bad as good. &quot; Others concerned about security at the Hermitage say Piotrovsky shoulders much of the blame himself . The testimony of current and former museum workers , police_officers and cultural officials suggests that -- despite its proud history -- the Hermitage is no longer capable of caring for its treasures . * The Hermitage is a complex of stately buildings strung_along the banks of the Neva River . At its core is the czar ' s 535-room Winter Palace . In summer , about 30 # 000 people a day wander down its miles of halls to view one of the world ' s finest collections of Western painting . The museum was founded in 1764 by Catherine the Great , who collected European art for her &quot; hermitage &quot; -- a cozy , private room closed_off from the rest of the palace . Later the Bolsheviks swelled the museum ' s assets by nationalizing hundreds of private collections after the 1917 Revolution . Famous for its Rembrandts , the museum also boasts at least 25 major works by Henri Matisse and 30 by Pablo Picasso . Many of those works hang_in direct sunlight , fading . Although in czarist days sunlight was filtered with colored paper glued onto the Hermitage ' s windowpanes , not even that primitive precaution is taken today . The museum also lacks air conditioning , and in summer the upper-story windows are thrown open . Paintings are exposed to cool breezes thick_with humidity from the bordering Neva River and car exhaust from nearby Nevsky Prospect . Basements are undermined by flooding and long-forgotten tunnels and drainage_systems , some 250 years old . &quot; Do you feel how damp this wall is ? &quot; asked engineer Tatyana Yakusheva during a tour of the subterranean rooms and corridors . &quot; Think_about it : This humidity creeps upward along this wall to the pictures above . Meanwhile , this wetness -- these stalactites , pools of water , this damp air -- it ' s eating_away the foundations. &quot; The Hermitage is actually sinking , at a rate of a half-centimeter a year , into ground that grows more sodden with the passing of each season . The Finnish government has promised to help with $ 100 # 000 , while the Hermitage has put_up $ 120 # 000 for Yakusheva to solve the water problems . Moreover , the Dutch government , in an agreement brokered by UNESCO , has pledged the Hermitage $ 1.2 million over the next 10 years for modernization and repairs . &quot; But although that sounds generous and impressive , most of that money is just a promise for now , &quot; Yakusheva said . &quot; This is a project that can ' t wait for paperwork. &quot; Then there is that security problem . Guards stationed in the display halls are almost all elderly women ; the salary is too low to attract anyone else . Some doze at their posts while vandals pry crystal and metal details off the luxurious furniture . In October 1992 , when two 18th-Century crystal flagons worth $ 18 # 000 each were stolen from a display cabinet , it was a visitor to the museum -- not an employee -- who first noticed . Last summer , when auditors from the Ministry of Culture removed a painting from the wall , intentionally tripping the alarm , no one arrived to check on it for eight minutes . The previous known major theft at the Hermitage occurred in 1991 , when a marble sculpture of Dionysus , valued at tens of thousands of dollars , disappeared from its display_case . Police discovered the statue in the baggage check room of Vitebsky Train_Station , and the thief -- a recently hired security_guard -- was arrested . * Yulia Andreyeva , a crime reporter for the St . Petersburg Bulletin , has catalogued dozens of petty thefts , the latest being the disappearance of a crystal pendant from a chandelier in the exhibit called &quot; The Century of Catherine II. &quot; The reporter is aided by letters from the museum ' s ardent fans . One letter was signed E.M. , who has led tours at the Hermitage for 19 years . &quot; In the Ministerial Corridor of the Winter Palace , bronze details have disappeared from the marble figures , &quot; the letter says . &quot; There are some large mosaic cabinets there , and medallions have ( also ) been pried off and stolen from them . Once security_guards stood there , but not today . &quot; It ' s the same in the Rembrandt Hall . There ' s a chair on the left coming_into the room . There were medallions of ( different ) types of stone ( on that chair ) ; now there are hardly any left. &quot; Officers of the Dzerzhinsky neighborhood police_precinct , where the Hermitage is located , have urged the museum to tighten security . &quot; The facts show that in the Hermitage the security regime is flagrantly violated by the very people charged with guarding the museum , &quot; they wrote in a report last April to Piotrovsky and the Russian government . &quot; There is an absence of necessary control by the ( museum ) leadership for discipline . If the faults noted above are not hereafter eliminated , the theft of valuables will continue. &quot; Piotrovsky ' s reaction to the report was curt . &quot; The police should search for thieves . that ' s their job . As to what we should do , that should be indicated by a special commission &quot; of the Ministry of Culture , he said . Such a commission audited the museum recently . Among the recommendations : new policies on inventory and storage , a tighter museum pass system , better control over who has keys to various rooms and &quot; development of the concept of ' Hermitage Security , ' on the basis of centralized administration , strict division of duties and coordinated activity between all departments. &quot; What prompted such sweeping condemnation ? Employees are tight-lipped -- with the notable exception of Irina Printsova , a petite 59-year-old former security_guard . Women of her generation make_up the front_line of the museum ' s security_system . Shod in bathroom slippers , often dozing in their chairs , they are stationed in almost every hall . Baturin refused to extend Printsova ' s contract because he wants to build a team of younger and more energetic guards . However , finding someone more energetic than Printsova would be tough . When Baturin , 62 , fired her , she challenged him to a race through the Hermitage stairwells , with the condition that she could keep her job if she won . Baturin declined . Printsova is suing for her job back . Workers at the Hermitage are horrified at how slack security has become , Printsova said , but are afraid to speak out . &quot; There ' s so_much unemployment in Russia now , and in the cultural fields unemployment is much , much worse , &quot; she said . &quot; At the Hermitage , people are clinging_to their jobs in terror. &quot; * Printsova , a self-admitted busybody , has documented her case against the Hermitage and intends to take it to UNESCO , which works closely with the museum . &quot; While others went shopping , I spent my work breaks wandering the halls of the Hermitage , and if I saw something wrong I reported it , &quot; she said . &quot; I saw other workers asleep at their posts , and I reported them . But they keep those people and they fire me . Why ? Because I ' m a nuisance . Because I don ' t keep quiet and doze_off in my chair. &quot; Three times , Printsova said , she has caught tourists creating a fire hazard by smoking around stacks of crates containing art . Other times , construction workers have been caught drinking on_the_job or in the museum after hours -- a hazard to the sensitive renovations they ' re doing . &quot; We write_down in a journal who arrived when and who left when , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' ve seen workers crawl out of here on their hands and knees . They ' re so drunk they can ' t even tell me their names . Once I wrote just that : ' Too drunk to identify himself , left on_hands and knees. ' No one ever read it . I don ' t even know why we keep that book. &quot;</TEXT>
