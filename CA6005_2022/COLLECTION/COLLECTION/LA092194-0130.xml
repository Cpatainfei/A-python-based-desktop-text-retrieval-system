   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; REPORT URGES EXPANDED GOVERNMENT ROLE IN VIRTUAL REALITY RESEARCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Virtual_reality was born in military research labs , but now that the Cold_War is over , scientists are looking_for new reasons to keep the dollars flowing for a technology whose development has largely been taken_over by private industry . In a report released this week -- sponsored by a consortium of federal agencies -- the National Research Council recommends that the government get_into virtual_reality research in a big way . The goal is to foster a fledgling technology that could lead to such futuristic wonders as endoscopic surgery by remote , and cheap exploration of outer space via telerobotics . But the recommendations raise questions about what the role of the government should be in a new industry that has already spawned dozens of start-up companies and fierce competition for yet-to-materialize markets . &quot; My view is that the government should stay way_out of the whole_thing , &quot; said Stan Kinsey , chief_executive of Iwerks , a Burbank-based entertainment start-up that has invested heavily in creating virtual_reality attractions for theme parks . &quot; The free market works great . The consumer judges and people make free-market decisions , and the respective disciplines put resources in the right , applicable industries. &quot; Virtual reality -- the ephemeral subset of computer_technology that makes_it possible to feel , really feel , like you ' re someplace that you ' re not -- has lately been driven largely by the entertainment_industry ' s efforts to create more and more sophisticated illusions for consumers in search of leisure-time escape_from the real_world . VR props include goggles , gloves , vests and other computer-driven tracking devices that connect to a display and a 3-D database to create a sense of immersion in a virtual world . But today ' s equipment has been known to make users drowsy , nauseated and disoriented . And the committee of scientists and academics that put_together the Research Council report said that entertainment_industry uses of virtual_reality for video_games and rides requires lower image quality and slower response_time than would be necessary for medical applications such_as surgery or industrial uses such_as automobile design . &quot; We felt the government needed to push in the development of the kinds of equipment that the person has to wear , because that would probably not be addressed by the entertainment_industry , &quot; said Anne Mavor of the NRC , co-editor of the study . &quot; Our charge was to point_out where we felt the major gaps in the technology were that are not being addressed by the private sector. &quot; The main area in which the committee recommended a &quot; major unified research program &quot; was in virtual_reality software , where the studies ' authors perceived a lack of research in technologies that would provide sensory experiences for sound and touch , as well as imaging . &quot; Computer_hardware probably will be developed through commercial market forces if current trends continue ; however , should serious lags in development occur , the government might then consider strategies for leveraging private-sector development efforts , &quot; the report says . That possibility -- and the report ' s allusion to federally set compatibility standards -- does not sit too well with Linden Rhoads , co-founder of Seattle-based Virtual I / O , a start-up backed by Logitech and cable operator Tele-Communications Inc. The firm plans to release its first product -- a set of light glasses that plug into a television or personal_computer and create a large floating picture that &quot; tracks &quot; with the user ' s movements -- this Christmas . &quot; Would the public have been served if the government had stepped_in and set standards for the operating systems of personal_computers ? I don ' t think so , &quot; said Rhoads , whose firm ' s core technology , in a typical pattern , grew out of a grant from the Army . &quot; The market naturally produces higher- and higher-quality products . If I go_ahead with this , there ' ll be someone else saying they can do_it better . So I ' m inspired to do the best I possibly can. &quot;</TEXT>
