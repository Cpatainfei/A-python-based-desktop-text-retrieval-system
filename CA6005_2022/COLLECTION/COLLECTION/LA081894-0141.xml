   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO ; PLAN FOR SCHOOLBOOK OBJECTION CONSIDERED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Parents who have complaints about books used in the Capistrano Unified School District will soon have a way to formally voice their displeasure . A proposed policy , considered by the school district board this week , requires that parents first notify their child ' s principal about concerns.If that doesn ' t resolve the complaint , a parent then could make a written complaint , which would be forwarded to the district office . If necessary the district superintendent would appoint a reviewing committee , made_up of five members , including a district administrator , the district librarian , a school-site administrator , teacher and parent . The parent would not be selected from the school where the complaint was lodged . Trustees said on Monday that they wanted a_few wording changes made in the proposed policy so parents would not feel discouraged from appealing any administrative decisions to the board . Trustees also said they didn ' t think the policy would be used by parents to attack books or other materials they deem offensive . In the past , parents in the district have objected to materials about AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases . Lois Anderson , president of the district teachers union , told trustees she was concerned that the policy could become a tool for a small but vocal group of parents intent_on steering teachers away from using potentially controversial books . Anderson said such tactics could result in an &quot; unofficial censorship &quot; because teachers might avoid using certain materials altogether rather than take_on the extra burden of assigning and grading alternate work for students whose parents ask to have them excused from regular assignments . But Trustee Marlene Draper said , &quot; I don ' t feel we are going_to get_into any major problems. &quot; The policy is expected to be back before the board next month . JEFF BEAN</TEXT>
