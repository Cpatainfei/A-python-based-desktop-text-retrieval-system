   <HEADLINE> THE ROOTS OF REBELLION ; THE CURRENT LAND REVOLT IN SOUTHERN MEXICO INVOLVES A MYSTERIOUS GUERRILLA ARMY , A DIVIDED CHURCH AND A NERVOUS GOVERNMENT . A JOURNEY ON THE REBELS ' ROAD IN CHIAPAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two days after an uneasy cease-fire began , tension gripped Las Margaritas , a usually tranquil coffee and ranching center 25 miles north of the Guatemalan border . Government soldiers eyed all movement warily , emptying vehicles and patting down men for arms . Hundreds of dazed refugees wandered through the neat zocalo , or central plaza , their next destination unknown . Officials were overwhelmed , lacking food , blankets and other necessities for the evacuees ; some were housed in a hall where a mural of Emiliano Zapata , the revolutionary icon , presided over their troubled repose . War had come_to this drowsy place , and no one quite knew what to make of it . &quot; We don ' t know if we ' ll ever go_home again , &quot; lamented Roselia Mendez , a shop owner whose hamlet was in the battle zone . &quot; What will become of us ? &quot; The lives of most everyone in Chiapas , Mexico ' s southernmost state , had been abruptly jarred . In a stunning New Year ' s Day offensive , a scruffy peasant army of perhaps 2 # 000 fighters launched a surprise_attack and caught security_forces off_guard , ultimately seizing three major towns , including Las Margaritas , and the city of San Cristobal de las Casas . The rebels invoked the legendary name of Zapata , whose cry of Tierra y Libertad ! stoked the Mexican_Revolution of 1910-17 . The insurgents , their show of force accomplished , had since retreated to their strongholds in the Lacandon forest and environs . For 10 days , the army had mounted a bloody offensive against the retreating rebels , sweeping through villages and arresting scores of peasants , most of whom protested their innocence . Helicopter gunships launched rockets and sprayed machine-gun fire on rural enclaves . A column of some 2 # 000 troops , backed by tanks and aircraft , had moved through Las Margaritas , intent_on delivering a deathblow to rebel bastions in the jungle beyond . Official estimates put the death toll at about 100 , though many believe it to be much higher -- the evidence is concealed in common graves throughout the region . The Mexican army , it appeared , was emulating the scorched-earth tactics so popular among nearby Central_American regimes . &quot; We don ' t understand why this happened , &quot; said Manuel Sanchez Perez , a 65-year-old grandfather from San Antonio de Los Banos , a pine-shrouded Tzotzil Indian village in the_hills above San Cristobal de las Casas . Speaking in front of his palm-roofed adobe hut , Sanchez gestured toward his adjoining cornfield , now seared black from bombing . But crops were not his only loss : Governmetn troops , he said , had taken_away his son ; he hadn ' t heard from him since . &quot; The soldiers say there are bad people around , &quot; the disbelieving man explained in broken Spanish . But as national and international condemnation of military abuses arose , the Mexican government opted for conciliation , at least for now . A tense cease-fire took_hold on Jan . 12 and the army beat a hasty retreat . authorities announced that they would negotiate with the guerrillas who presented a long list of grievances -- economic , social and political . The rebel offensive -- Mexico ' s most serious insurgency in two decades -- shocked a nation whose leaders prided themselves on political stability and their unwavering march to modernity . Some say the revolt triggered Mexico ' s gravest social crisis since the Revolution . Yet relatively little was known about the rebels , their roots , the underlying upsets that had led an army of Mayan peasants to take go_to_war with rifles and machetes . The clues were to be found in the hardscrabble mountain and jungle villages where this insurgency was born and nurtured . Past the final army checkpoint , heading northeast from Las Margaritas toward the guerrilla heartland , there was scarcely anyone on the gravel road . Most homes were abandoned . Deep potholes remained where the retreating rebels had gouged_out trenches , attempting to slow the pursuing troops . Military debris -- Tootsie Roll wrappers , foil packaging of Made in U.S.A. rations -- littered former army campsites along this principal route to the the Lacandon region . Spray-painted black graffiti on a wall demanded : &quot; Stop evictions of indigenous communities. &quot; The plea echoed the many long-ignored cries that had spurred this conflict -- the latest chapter in a bitter , centuries-long tradition of Indian revolts in Chiapas , one of Mexico ' s states . Woven into the dense social fabric of the state are violent land feuds and forced relocations of villagers -- usually at the bidding of cattlemen , political_bosses or religious rivals responding to fierce tensions between the Catholic Establishment and Protestant evangelists . Americas Watch , the human_rights group , noted dryly about Chiapas in a 1990 report : &quot; Evictions are frequently accompanied by warrantless arrests of large_numbers of community members , often on trumped-up charges , and without regard for what will become of the persons being evicted. &quot; Though home to only 3 1 / 2 million people in a nation of 92 million , Chiapas accounts_for more_than a quarter of land disputes pending before Mexico ' s notoriously corrupt agrarian reform ministry . Police , soldiers and landowners ' private militias ruthlessly enforce the will of cattle barons and other powerful interests -- not infrequently including drug_traffickers . As Mexico hurtles toward the millennium , Chiapas is mired somewhere in a feudal past . As the gravel road ascended into the pine forests , the parched , rocky landscape of Las Margaritas yielded to a cooler environment . In the valleys below lay expansive fincas ( estates ) , now mostly gone_to ruin amid an intractable slump in coffee prices . This was the domain of the Castellanos clan , old-style hacendados who , for generations , counted_on the Tojolabal Indians -- descendants of the Mayas , like all_the state ' s dozen or so indigenous groups -- to provide cheap and plentiful labor . The Castellanos legacy became a kind of metaphor for the entire uprising . The rebels had entered a nearby family ranch and kidnaped Absalon Castellanos Dominguez , a 70-year-old retired general and stalwart of the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , which has ruled Mexico for more_than six decades . Castellanos had earned a singularly brutal reputation as an enforcer for the landed gentry who had long treated the state as their personal finca . Despite post-revolutionary bans on amassing properties , the wealthy , critics say , retained and expanded their vast holdings through disguised ownership . Zapata ' s revolution , which radiated from the north , never made_it this far south . In 1980 , Gen . Castellanos ' troops were accused of massacring more_than a dozen Tzeltal Indians who had sought restitution of their lands . Two years later , the PRI bestowed upon el general its gubernatorial nod , ensuring his election in a state where 90 % of ballots are routinely cast for the ruling bloc . When 11 Tzotzil Indians were killed in a land dispute during Castellanos ' first year in office , the ex-general vowed : &quot; We will take the pertinent measures &quot; -- a refrain repeated after subsequent , equally unfulfilled demands for justice . In abducting Castellanos , the rebels extracted a measure of retribution , convicting him of sundry crimes : &quot; violation of Indians ' human_rights , robbery , evictions , kidnaping , corruption and murder. &quot; He was sentenced to &quot; earn his bread &quot; during a life term of hard labor among indigenous communities . ( After six weeks in captivity , he was freed in exchange for the release of suspected rebels. ) Clinging_to a steep mountainside rising from the tropical lowlands below was the near-abandoned village of El Nuevo Momon , a community of about 100 families housed in wood and mud-brick homes amid pine and banana_trees . A cluster of a half-dozen unarmed lookouts took_note of everyone ' s comings and goings ; many rebels had traded_in their red bandannas and olive khakis for less conspicuous garb . White_flags sprang from still-inhabited dwellings . The tense cease-fire was holding , but revolutionary passions were high . &quot; Our parents , our grandparents , suffered for years working for the Castellanos hacendados , &quot; said Jorge Vazquez , 36 , a slim , severe peasant who spoke_of his forefathers ' humiliations as though the events were recent . He told a story oft-repeated here : Almost half a century ago , the Castellanos family promised more_than 7 # 000 acres to peasants in exchange for clearing a jungle tract and establishing a new sugar_cane plantation . The cane was soon plentiful -- but the people ended_up with a fraction of the pledged property . When residents protested , pistoleros burned their homes and threatened them with worse . Today , mountains and private estates hemmed_in the area ' s fast-growing families . &quot; Now there is no place for us , &quot; said Vazquez . &quot; Our people were fooled , deceived. &quot; Such anguish -- here and duplicated in scores of other rural communities -- helped shape the uprising of the Zapatista National Liberation Army , whose Spanish acronym , EZLN , is now part of the national lexicon . The rebels ' demands for justice -- both economic and political -- have awakened long-suppressed grievances nationwide , crystallizing peasant and even urban frustration , and exposing the failure of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s much-touted anti-poverty initiative , Solidarity . The uprising has altered Mexico ' s economic and political landscape virtually overnight , just months before August ' s presidential elections test the ruling party ' s hegemony . And the disturbing martial images from the south shattered the president ' s finely crafted vision of a nation poised on the cusp of modernity . &quot; Everything changed overnight , &quot; wrote Elena Poniatowska in the Mexico_City daily La Jornada . &quot; In 1994 we woke_up in a new country , a country where we have to live_in a different way , in confusion , sadness , anxiety , desperation , bursts of machine-gun fire , la guerrilla . &quot; It was by design that the rebellion exploded on Jan . 1 , the day the North_American Free_Trade Agreement -- the centerpiece of Salinas ' economic blueprint -- kicked into place . Campesinos in the south and elsewhere never shared the NAFTA euphoria evident in the industrial hubs of northern and central Mexico . Small_farmers feared that cheap , mass-produced U.S. foodstuffs would overwhelm their meager production of corn and beans . Already , critics said , the Salinas administration had undermined the hallowed ejido system -- a post-revolutionary form of quasi-communal ownership -- by allowing peasants to lease out their tracts , thereby encouraging U.S.-style agribusiness and new latifundios , the vast private holdings outlawed by the revolution . In short , the Mayans of Chiapas can be said to have risen_up in rejection of global markets , privatization , a New World Order and what they view_as its corollaries : ever-more concentrated wealth , destruction of indigenous peoples , theft of their lands . &quot; TODAY WE SAY ENOUGH ! &quot; the rebels proclaimed in their Declaration of War , emblazoned with the familiar mustachioed image of Zapata . Monsignor Samuel Ruiz Garcia , bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas , was holding forth to the press about injustice . The cease-fire had not yet been declared ; outside his residence , tanks rumbled down the narrow streets of the quaint colonial city , long popular_with backpackers and exotica-seeking tourists -- a place where cappuccino machines coexist seamlessly with Indian merchants . Now , edgy troops toting M-16s and the not-too-distant sound of army shelling jarred the town ' s habitual serenity . &quot; What has happened here cannot be comprehended without understanding the social context , &quot; the baldish , bespectacled Don Samuel intoned in his signature baritone . &quot; Of course we condemn violence . . . but we recognize that a great injustice has been done to our indigenous communities. &quot; The state ' s great natural_resources -- land , water , petroleum , hydroelectric power -- are concentrated in few hands , the bishop noted , leaving much of the population impoverished , illiterate and lacking electricity and running water . &quot; Time has stood_still &quot; in Chiapas , Ruiz declared during an interview , shortly before celebrating a wedding at the cathedral . &quot; It appears like a historic anachronism. &quot; In his 34 years as bishop , this native of central Mexico has mastered four indigenous languages and earned a reputation among Mayans as a tatic , or honored one , for his efforts on their behalf . Taking his cue from reformist church_doctrines , Ruiz , 69 , has emerged as the modern-day heir of this diocese ' s most celebrated bishop , Bartolome de las Casas , the 16th-Century &quot; Protector of the Indians &quot; who denounced the Spanish Crown ' s abuse of the native population , enraging colonial viceroys . When Indians protested the 500th anniversary of the Spaniards ' arrival by toppling a statue of San Cristobal ' s founding conquistador , the mayor was quick to blame Ruiz . Like Fray Bartolome , Don Samuel has never hesitated to censure the powerful or break ranks with Mexico ' s conservative church leadership . Last year , in a pastoral letter sent to Rome , the bishop adopted the Indians ' viewpoint : &quot; More and more , the people feel the weight of scarcity , of unemployment , of injustice and growing misery . There is malnutrition and illness provoked by poverty . We don ' t have land to work to get our food . . . . The applications we make_for land receive no response , and it ' s very expensive to buy ; meanwhile there are some who have a lot of land and don ' t farm it , or use it for cattle. &quot; The Mexican government is widely believed to have pressured the Vatican last year to oust the bishop , whom large landowners view_as a renegade liberation theologian inciting a holy war . The church hierarchy appeared to be pushing Ruiz out last fall , demanding that he respond to reports of ecclesiastical misconduct , including Marxist analysis of social conditions . But scores of religious_leaders , peasant organizers and human_rights activists -- some of whom have nominated Ruiz for the Nobel Peace Prize -- rose to the defense of Don Samuel . The bishop , not about to abandon a life ' s work without a fight , denied the insinuations and hung_on tenaciously . And he was here when the Zapatistas marched into San Cristobal , thrusting his social agenda into international prominence . Reeling Mexican authorities , attempting to explain this astonishing turn of events , soon found a scapegoat : the Roman_Catholic_Church . The powerful Ministry of the Interior , which controls the nation ' s security apparatus and oversees elections , placed blame for the rebellion largely on catequistas . These lay Catholic workers , authorities contended , along with Central_American revolutionaries and disenchanted leftists who have drifted here since the 1970s , disseminated subversion in the troubled hinterlands , &quot; This is not an Indian movement nor a peasant action , &quot; the ministry declared . Vicious stories were planted : Ruiz was the Zapatistas ' &quot; supreme commander , &quot; a mass-circulation weekly blared beneath a photograph of the bishop celebrating Mass , a crucifix in the background . Ultimately , the campaign against the Catholic_Church and Bishop Ruiz backfired . Much of the effort was reportedly orchestrated from Mexico_City by former Interior_Secretary Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido , the Cambridge-educated lawyer who had earlier succeeded Castellanos as governor of Chiapas . As governor , critics say , Gonzalez expanded on Castellanos ' legacy of repression -- jailing priests , persecuting peasants and harassing human-rights workers . As Interior Minister , Gonzalez had always downplayed persistent rumors of a burgeoning guerrilla force in his home state . But the war exposed the inadequacies of his governance ; the red-faced Gonzalez was soon forced to resign from his Cabinet position , as was Chiapas ' governor , a Gonzalez protege . An ashen President Salinas turned_to his long-time confidante , Manuel Camacho Solis , ex-mayor of Mexico_City , whom he named as &quot; Commissioner of Peace and Reconciliation &quot; in Chiapas . For Camacho , the high-profile appointment amounted to a stunning turnaround . His career seemed to have come asunder in November , when Salinas passed him over for the ruling-party ' s presidential nod and instead named his chief rival , Social Development Secretary Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta . Camacho ' s forte has long been negotiation and compromise -- skills that don ' t endear him to ruling-party apparatchiks , who fear he is too cozy with the leftist opposition . Pointedly , Camacho has chosen the path of dialogue with the Zapatistas . Amid a cease-fire and army retreat , the presidential envoy promptly recognized the &quot; grave conditions &quot; of poverty and racism that afflict the Indian population . &quot; It would be a grave error to convert the Church into a public enemy , &quot; Camacho told reporters after arriving in Chiapas , Bishop Ruiz , the official mediator , by his side . &quot; I say with clarity that the bishop is a friend of peace and an important factor_in advancing the process that begins today. &quot; The Chiapas Mayans weren ' t the first rebels to hoist Zapata ' s banner anew . In the ' 60s , authorities crushed the storied rebellion of Ruben Jaramillo , who , in Zapata ' s home state of Morelos , took_up the cause of los de abajo , the rural underclass . Later , two now-legendary schoolteachers , Lucio Cabanas and Genaro Vazquez Rojas , went underground in western Guerrero state , where conditions of poverty resemble those in Chiapas . Hundreds died or disappeared and entire villages were uprooted as part of a &quot; dirty war &quot; against guerrillas in Guerrero and elsewhere during the 1970s . Those historical antecedents , however , unfolded against a markedly different backdrop . Today , internal and international pressures have forced Mexico ' s leaders to pay some lip_service to long-suppressed demands for democratic reform . And scrappy independent newspapers and magazines are now quick to report military abuses in Chiapas . The EZLN movement took_shape deep inside the remote Lacandon forest , helped by the rugged terrain , lack of official presence and existence of numerous independent campesino groups that had sprung_up here since the 1970s . The peasant organizations provided both recruits and a ready-made organizing network . How the rebels financed their activities and obtained guns and other equipment for thousands of troops remains an open question . The Zapatistas say all funds came from peasant sources , but there opponents speculate that kidnapings of rich Mexicans and other crimes bankrolled the rebellion . While the Zapatistas operated in secrecy , many believe that authorities knew that an insurgency was germinating in the bush , although officials likely underestimated the threat . For reasons that remain obscure -- some see a disinclination to upset delicate free-trade talks -- no concerted enforcement operation was launched , even after the military stumbled upon a rebel training encampment near the town of Ocosingo last May . Instead , Mexico_City funneled millions in anti-poverty funds to Chiapas , hopeful of buying_off discontent ; the federal largess enriched the political_bosses and their cronies , but seldom trickled down to the peasants . The entire Lacandon region has long been a caldron of unrest . Early in this century , timbermen kept Indian loggers in chains to ensure that they would not flee the brutal conditions in the mahogany camps . Years later , authorities pushed the losers in the state ' s chronic land wars into the long-neglected area , ever-farther from sight and mind . In recent decades , hundreds of thousands of homesteaders , mostly Indian peasants from the highlands , have staked out collective claims here , joining loggers , ranchers and , later , drug_traffickers . As the population swelled , the native Lacandon Indians were soon a tiny minority facing near-extinction . Intensively farmed tracts lost their fertility and there was less room to expand . Ownership claims were often ill-defined ; inevitably , corrupt officials sided with ranchers and other influential overseers in property battles . The government ' s decision in the 1970s to create a vast jungle preserve severely constricted further settlement ; subsequent bans on tree-felling narrowed employment possibilities . And the collapse of coffee prices in 1989 pushed people toward desperation . Finally , Mexico_City ' s enfeebling of ejido safeguards and the prospect of free_trade apparently prompted many to take_up armed rebellion . Adding_to tensions , tens of thousands of Guatemalan refugees arrived in Chiapas during the 1980s , fleeing brutal repression and a guerrilla war in their adjoining homeland . The Guatemalans , themselves Indians who often speak little Spanish , have watched developments with trepidation . On an isolated path near Poza Rica , a major refugee center in the Lacandon region , two apprehensive Kanjobal Indians from Guatemala were quick to disassociate themselves from the rebellious goings-on . &quot; We ' re not Zapatistas , &quot; one of the men offered , unsolicited . Their machetes were for cutting corn and coffee , he pointed_out , not for warfare . Beyond Poza Rica , an eerie sense of desertion had overtaken the zone ; most residents had fled . Those left_behind were disposing_of animals at giveaway prices . Horses , chickens , cows and other beasts ran wild ; dogs howled in vain , mourning their departed masters . &quot; I can understand people ' s fears , but I cannot condone leaving one ' s animals to the elements like this , &quot; said Luis Arturo Maldonado , former president of the cattlemen ' s association in Las Margaritas . Don Luis , as he is known , has resisted the exodus of his fellow ranchers from Zapatista territory . Unlike most cattlemen , Maldonado , 36 , is well-respected by area peasants . Rejecting the imperious stance of his colleagues , Maldonado has intervened with agrarian authorities on behalf of nearby ejidos and has long ferried campesinos and their goods in his battered , 20-year-old truck . He denounced the government with a vehemence matching that of the Zapatistas . For years , he noted , politicians have vowed to pave the main_road to the nearest city , Comitan de Dominguez , now five hours away on a treacherous dirt route . &quot; We ' re all tired_of promises from the government , &quot; said Maldonado , seated on his front_porch during a light rain , gazing toward the lush mountains beyond . For years , he suspected that radicals -- encouraged by missionary priests -- had organized paramilitary training deep in the forest . While virulently opposed to the rebellion , the rancher sympathizes with the fight against a government that deceived and exploited its poorest citizens , seldom delivering on its promises . &quot; Officials always help the biggest cattlemen , &quot; said Maldonado , who , with about 210 acres and 80 head of cattle , is a relative small-timer . Unlike fellow ranchers who have threatened to launch a private war to recoup their lands , Maldonado prefers accommodation ( though he does carry a pistol these days ) . If the guerrillas demand one of his herd as a &quot; war tax , &quot; he plans to comply . &quot; I ' m afraid we ' ll have to get used to la guerrilla here , &quot; Maldonado said . &quot; If anything good comes of this disaster , &quot; he added , &quot; I hope that someone will finally do something about the terrible , paralyzing corruption that has plagued this country. &quot; From Maldonado ' s ranch , A two-hour horseback ride_on narrow , muddy mountain tracks , through streams and down precipitous drops , leads to Caracol , a village identified in government documents as a rebel training and communications center . Recent visitors were met on the path by men in their late teens and 20s , dressed in tattered civilian clothes and rubber_boots . They were unarmed except for machetes , but some wore the hand-stitched green caps of Zapatista fighters . Suspicious , they nonetheless sat_down to talk . &quot; Would we go_to_war if we had alternatives ? &quot; asked the apparent leader , perhaps 25 , who seemed genuinely tormented by recent events . &quot; Would we go_to_war if we could have decent clothes , not these rags that we wear ? If we had a proper education for our children ? &quot; He was soon virtually shouting . &quot; If we had a clinic and people didn ' t have to die because of a lack of care , like our parents and grandparents did ? If we had our land . . . . that ' s why there ' s a war . . . . Maybe now , finally , they ' ll listen to us. &quot; He and others recounted their ejido ' s troubled history : For three generations , the men said , they and their Tojolabal ancestors -- who founded the settlement -- fought in vain to legalize their property claims . Today , they remain squatters in the eyes of the law . Villagers had made numerous trips to Las Margaritas and the state_capital and hosted agrarian functionaries -- even bribed them , hoping the plots would finally be theirs . &quot; We sold all our animals to give them money , and we were left with nothing ! &quot; another man exclaimed . They spoke_of other frustrations : government promises of better roads , a clinic and school that never materialized . Teachers seldom arrived ; those who did left after a_few weeks . &quot; Any of us who know how to read learned on our own -- not because of any help from the government , &quot; noted the leader , who , like the others , declined to give his name . &quot; What chance do our children have ? They are condemned to ignorance , like we were. &quot; Medical_care is two hours away on horseback . &quot; The only time they attend_to us quickly is when we ask about family_planning , &quot; the leader noted with a caustic laugh . &quot; Then they ' re happy to help us . They want us to be fewer. &quot; After 90 minutes of angry conversation on the roadside , they were asked if they were part of the Zapatista column that took the town of Las Margaritas . &quot; All I can say , &quot; responded the spokesman , &quot; is that our hearts are with these fighters . We see that there is finally a battle for justice in our country , and we support that fight . We feel this is long overdue . If someone doesn ' t do something now , there will never be a change in this place. &quot; Asked about Emiliano Zapata , the men shook their heads . They had heard of the man , but didn ' t know much about him . From their jungle hide-the Zapatista leadership has successfully managed to convey its viewpoints via communiques secreted to the eager press corps in San Cristobal . Most comunicados are the handiwork of sub-comandante Marcos , who rapidly acquired a kind of cult cachet : a latter-day Che Guevara in a ski_mask . He has penned witty , brash and detailed correspondence , spicing political dogma with_references_to films , soap_operas and books . Although he acknowledged that the Zapatistas cannot defeat the army in a military faceoff , Marcos vanquished the government on the propaganda front . Marcos appealed_to U.S. audiences to cut_off aid to Mexico ' s &quot; dictatorial government. &quot; Elaborating on the rebels ' calls_for land_reform and social justice , he demanded the resignation of an &quot; illegitimate &quot; President Salinas and the formation of a transition government to guarantee free elections -- explicitly linking democratic reform with an economic restructuring . &quot; In summary , &quot; Marcos wrote , &quot; we want peace with dignity and justice. &quot; The rebellion , he asserted , was 10 years in the making , and emerged largely as a function of self-defense against ranchers ' hired militias . During this formative decade , Marcos added , the rebels had unsuccessfully pursued peaceful avenues toward change -- while , he charged , thousands of Indians died of curable diseases . &quot; The economic and social plans of the federal , state and municipal_governments . . . are limited to giving us handouts during election time , &quot; Marcos thundered in another letter . &quot; But the charity does not help for more_than one moment . . . . If we die now , it won ' t be with shame but rather with dignity , like our ancestors. &quot; The light-skinned Marcos says he is of mixed-race , like most Mexicans -- and Zapata himself . Conversant in history , politics and current events , Marcos was evidently one of the radical activists who came here from northern and central Mexico during the 1970s and ' 80s seeking a cause and a base , drawn by the region ' s upheaval and potential for organization . The Zapatistas stress their indigenous origins . Their demands include some kind of autonomy for Mexico ' s Indians , who now account_for less than 10 % of the nation ' s population . Marcos , subordinate in the rebel hierarchy to a clandestine indigenous committee , assailed the perception of Indians as an &quot; anthropological object , touristic curiosity , or part of a ' Jurassic Park. ' &quot; The rebels ' ideology is still amorphous . But notably absent are the Marxist-Leninist rhetoric and yanqui- bashing that are pro_forma in Latin_American leftist tracts . Rather , the EZLN embraces a kind of peculiarly Mexican Indian nationalism , more closely related to Zapata ' s populist exhortations than the oratory of Marx and Mao . &quot; They follow a very Mexican form of socialism , &quot; said Andres Aubry , a French anthropologist who has worked in the region for 20 years . In an extensive interview with Mexican reporters deep in the jungle , the poncho-clad Marcos -- sporting his trademark black ski_mask , red bandanna and belts of scarlet shotgun_shells -- returned to the rebellion ' s seminal preoccupation : la tierra . President Salinas ' revision of constitutional safeguards protecting the ejido system and its guarantees of land to peasants in need , he told them , was a &quot; powerful catalyst &quot; for the events of Jan . 1 . &quot; The companeros say land is life , that if you don ' t have land you ' re dead , so why live ? &quot; Marcos explained . &quot; Better to fight and to die fighting. &quot; FROM THE RAIN_FOREST TO the highlands , la tierra is indisputably the central preoccupation in the Chiapas countryside . &quot; There is no more land for our sons , &quot; said Olivio Hernandez , an 80-year-old great-grandfather who pondered the_matter outside his home of wooden slats in El Nuevo Momon , a white_flag rising from the roof . &quot; Our sons want to work , not fight . Our people have always worked the land. &quot; Nearby , remaining residents gathered_in front of Nuevo Momon ' s looted government store . Belisario Jimenez Lopez , a 40-year-old agricultural union leader from the nearby ejido of Cruz del Rosario , was urging them not to abandon their lots . &quot; Our land is not allowed to grow , but of course our families do , &quot; said Jimenez , a father of eight who represents the Union of Ejidos of the Forest , one of the region ' s many independent organizations . Most of his fellow unionists resisted Zapatista entreaties to join the armed conflict , Jimenez said , because they opposed violence . Nonetheless , like others here , he sympathized_with the rebels ' complaints . &quot; The men in our village who went_with the Zapatistas are the ones who have the most severe land problems . It ' s as simple as that. &quot; An allied unionist , Mario Hernandez Juarez , also called the Zapatistas ' cause a just one , while disapproving of violence . &quot; I must admit a certain amount of admiration , &quot; he noted as he recounted the events of Dec . 31 , when columns of Zapatistas arrived here in hijacked trucks , bound for Las Margaritas . &quot; These are campesinos like us , ready to die and take a stand_for what they believe in. &quot; Now , with uncertainty and warfare gripping the valley , the 24-year-old father of three was hopeful that something good would arise from the tumult . &quot; We want peace and tranquillity , &quot; Hernandez said . &quot; But this time , officials should be forced to keep whatever promises they make . The government cannot be allowed to break their promises this time. &quot;</TEXT>
