   <HEADLINE> RULES AGAINST RELIGIOUS HARASSMENT SUPPORTED ; CIVIL RIGHTS : MAINLINE GROUPS DEFEND PROPOSED FEDERAL GUIDELINES THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER ATTACK BY CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS GROUPS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mainline religious groups Thursday came_to the defense of proposed guidelines aimed at ending religious harassment in the workplace . The guidelines , first proposed by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in October , have been under harsh attack by conservative religious groups and are the target of a campaign by conservative-oriented radio talk_shows . &quot; These political groups have irresponsibly abandoned an important protection against religious harassment at_work , &quot; former Rep . John Buchanan ( R-Ala. ) told a news_conference held by more_than half_dozen Protestant , Jewish and civil_liberties groups . Buchanan , senior_vice_president of the People for the American Way Action Fund , said the guidelines &quot; should be clarified , not eliminated. &quot; Religious harassment is illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , as is on-the-job harassment based on race , color , gender , national origin , age or disability . The EEOC , the federal agency charged with enforcing anti-bias employment legislation , prepared the guidelines to help employers understand their obligations in preventing harassment of all kinds on_the_job . But conservatives have declared war on the guidelines , arguing that they would create a &quot; religion-free &quot; workplace where workers would be unable to share their faith with fellow_workers . In March , for example , the Christian Action Network , in a direct mail fund-raising letter , warned that under the guidelines &quot; carrying the Bible , wearing a cross , having a calendar with religious scriptures on it , even breathing the name of our Lord Jesus -- all may soon be illegal while working. &quot; But the mainstream groups argued that conservatives are distorting the purpose and impact of the guidelines . &quot; Religious harassment happens , &quot; Oliver Thomas , special counsel for religious and civil_liberties of the National Council of Churches , told the news_conference . &quot; Fortunately , it is rare , but it does happen. &quot; Thomas said that if religion were eliminated from the proposed guidelines , as demanded by the conservative groups , &quot; it would signal to the American people that religious harassment is of less concern , and therefore of less significance , to the federal_government than racial or sexual_harassment . &quot; Even worse , some might mistakenly assume religious harassment is permissible , &quot; Thomas said . &quot; There ' s a great_deal of misinformation surrounding this issue , &quot; said Melvin Salberg , national chairman , and Abraham Foxman , national director , of the Anti-Defamation League . &quot; Far from limiting employees ' religious freedom as some have alleged , these guidelines make clear that religious harassment violates federal law and is comparable_to other forms of prohibited discrimination , such_as race , sex and national origin , &quot; they said in a prepared statement . Last year about 800 of the approximately 16 # 000 harassment complaints filed with the EEOC were related to religion . The guidelines define harassment as conduct that &quot; denigrates &quot; or shows &quot; hostility or aversion &quot; toward someone because of his or her religion . Complaints require proof that the conduct created an &quot; offensive work environment. &quot; A fact sheet circulated by the anti-bias agency sought to allay the conservatives ' concerns , noting that much of the behavior conservatives fear would be banned by guidelines would in fact be permissible , including wearing a cross or a yarmulke or expressing one ' s religious_beliefs .</TEXT>
