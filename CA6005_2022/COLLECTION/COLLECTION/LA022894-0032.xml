   <HEADLINE> BILL HICKS , 32 ; POPULAR COMIC IN U.S. , ENGLAND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> William M . ( Bill ) Hicks , the dark and biting stand-up comedian whose material was excised in October from &quot; The Late Show With David Letterman &quot; because it purportedly touched &quot; too many hot spots , &quot; has died of pancreatic_cancer . He was 32 . Hicks , the subject of two HBO specials and a New Yorker magazine profile who performed regularly in Los Angeles and Orange counties , died Saturday at the home of his parents in Little_Rock , Ark. , his co-manager , Colleen McGarr , announced Sunday . Before Hicks ' illness , he had lived_on the Westside . Last year Hicks released the comedy album &quot; Arizona Bay , &quot; and was named by Rolling Stone magazine as the year ' s &quot; hot stand-up. &quot; He was recently nominated for his third American Comedy Award . Hicks had appeared 11 times on Letterman ' s former show , NBC ' s &quot; Late Night. &quot; But when he recorded six minutes of material for Letterman ' s CBS version last fall , the executive producer called him to say that CBS representatives had ordered the segment axed . &quot; The show went great , &quot; Hicks told The Times then . &quot; Dave even gave me a Havana cigar during the break. &quot; Stunned by the censorship , Hicks said : &quot; I perform this stuff for my mom on her porch in Little_Rock , Arkansas . I even wore a delightful new outfit , with fall colors . I didn ' t wear black. &quot; Hicks customarily wore black in his club dates here , across the United States and in England , where he became a cult favorite . The costume emphasized his dark , satirical humor that caused some fans and critics to label him the &quot; prince of darkness. &quot; His routines customarily examined a host of controversial subjects -- homosexuality , religion , gun-control laws , smoking , politics , pornography and drugs . On religion , he typically commented in his act : &quot; Why do Christians wear crucifixes around their neck ? Do you think when Jesus comes_back he ever wants to see another ( expletive ) cross ? &quot; On drugs , Hicks would say : &quot; You never see positive drug stories on the news , do you ? Isn ' t that weird , since most of the experiences I ' ve had_on drugs were real ( expletive ) positive. &quot; Hicks started sneaking_out of the house at age 13 to perform at open mike nights at Houston ' s Comedy Workshop . In 1991 , his hourlong performance at the Just for Laughs Montreal International Comedy Festival gave him international status and made him particularly popular in England . Noting that he found less censorship in Britain than in the United States , he said last year before the Letterman incident : &quot; It ' s kind of funny to see a guy who talks_about free speech ( being ) edited . that ' s America . God bless it. &quot; Hicks had recently created a series for British television , called &quot; Counts of the Netherworld , &quot; involving two Victorian-era counts who sit around philosophizing . Hicks ' stand-up style involved talking his way through a subject_to reveal its inherent absurdities rather than telling jokes . Called everything from &quot; a foul-mouthed moralist &quot; to &quot; a satirical comedic poet , &quot; Hicks refused to describe himself . &quot; Lenny Bruce ( said ) : ' I ' m not a comic , I ' m Lenny Bruce , ' &quot; Hicks mused last year . &quot; I think he was trying to say , ' Don ' t label me. ' I think I ' ll go the same route. &quot; Hicks is survived by his parents , James and Mary , of Little_Rock ; a sister , Lynn , of Fort_Worth , Tex. , and a brother , Steve , of Austin , Tex . A memorial service is scheduled Tuesday at 10 a.m. at the Griffin Leggett Funeral_Home in Little_Rock , with graveside services at 2 p.m. Wednesday in Leakesville , Miss . The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to Hospice Home Care Inc. in Little_Rock .</TEXT>
