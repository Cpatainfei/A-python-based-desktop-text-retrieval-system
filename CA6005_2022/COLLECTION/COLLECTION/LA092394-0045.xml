   <HEADLINE> NEW ANGLE ON A SYMBOL OF ART DECO ; PAINTING : TAMARA DE LEMPICKA ' S PORTRAITS OF THE ' 20S AND ' 30S LEISURE CLASS ARE FINDING REVIVED INTEREST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tamara de Lempicka ' s life personified European Jazz Age hedonism and her Art Deco portraits of idle aristocrats , voluptuaries and hangers-on to the Continental smart_set were emblematic of the era . Then Hitler consumed Europe and De Lempicka moved to Beverly Hills . As she was exiled from her milieu , her talent seemingly evaporated , and her reputation with it . Now , the Montreal Museum of Fine_Arts has mounted a large exhibition of the late painter ' s works , the first North_American retrospective of an artist whom museum director Pierre Theberge describes as &quot; an essential part of the great machinery of the 1920s and ' 30s. &quot; The De Lempicka exhibition of 57 paintings follows a revival of interest among collectors , especially in Hollywood . In March , an Italian collector bought De Lempicka ' s &quot; Adam and Eve &quot; ( 1932 ) at auction from Barbra Streisand for $ 2 million . Streisand had paid $ 135 # 000 for it 10 years earlier . That work and others still in Streisand ' s collection are not in the exhibition , but three paintings owned by Jack Nicholson are included . The Montreal exhibition runs to Oct . 2 and will not travel . Theberge ' s idea for a De Lempicka retrospective dates_from 1991 , when the museum mounted &quot; The 1920s , Age of the Metropolis. &quot; Three of De Lempicka ' s portraits were displayed then , and one was used as the show ' s signature work . &quot; In that context , she really appeared as an artist who defined the period , in terms of style and attitude , in a certain toughness , &quot; Theberge said in an interview . Echoes of her style can be found in German portraits of the same era by Christian Schad and Wilhelm Schnarrenberger . Art scholars and critics are divided on De Lempicka , to say the least . Many regard her as an artist who merely reflected her times rather than helped to define them . And her post-European work inevitably diminishes her reputation . Theberge makes clear that he does not equate De Lempicka with Picasso or with succeeding art geniuses who flowered in the 1920s . Rather , he puts her in the company of Josephine Baker , Greta Garbo , Coco Chanel and Colette , those who placed their distinctive stamp on European society between the wars . * The sloe-eyed decadence reflected in &quot; Les jeunes filles &quot; ( &quot; Young_Girls , &quot; 1929 ) , the portrait of Montmartre nightclub owner Suzy Solidor in front of a Cubist skyline ( 1933 ) and the confident expression in a 1932 self-portrait behind the wheel of a green Bugatti are veritable advertisements for the era . Certainly , art in the De Lempicka style pops_up across North_America in billboards , signs , posters and other suggestions of the period . Also contributing to the De Lempicka revival may be a contemporary resonance in her persona : independent , unabashed in her sexuality , self-promoting , ambitious . Sound familiar ? Consider this : Madonna is a collector and has used images from De Lempicka in her music videos . &quot; It ' s astounding how contemporary she is to today ' s sensibility , &quot; said Theberge , who added that , in the 1920s and ' 30s , &quot; you can count_on the fingers of your hand the number of women artists who were successful. &quot; &quot; I live life in the margins of society and the rules of normal society don ' t apply in the margins , &quot; De Lempicka said , according to &quot; Passion by Design , &quot; a 1987 biography co-authored by the artist ' s daughter , Kizette de Lempicka-Foxhall , and Charles Phillips . The artist was born Tamara Gorska in Warsaw around the turn_of_the_century -- the precise date is uncertain . She summered in St . Petersburg and married a well-to-do Russian lawyer , Tadeusz de Lempicki , in 1916 . Two years later , the couple fled the Bolshevik Revolution for Paris . There , they moved_into the circle of exiled Russian nobility and other out-of-work aristocrats . It was there that De Lempicka took_up painting . The teacher who had the greatest influence on her was Andre Lhote , who sought to apply the principles of Cubism to traditional subjects such_as landscapes , nudes and portraits . Seriously ambitious in her art , the tall , blond De Lempicka managed to turn her headlong lifestyle into a business asset . Her notoriety attracted clients ; clients became patrons , and lovers . And there were countless lovers , male and female . Her visits to the estate of Italian Fascist poet Gabriele d ' Annunzio inspired a gossipy account by a servant that decades later was transformed into the audience-participation play &quot; Tamara. &quot; The play opened in Los Angeles in 1984 and ran_for the better part of a decade . Tadeusz de Lempicki divorced her in 1928 . She painted a portrait of him that same year , leaving unfinished the left_hand , which would have carried the wedding_band . In 1933 she married Baron Raoul Kuffner on the understanding that she could continue to live as she pleased . * De Lempicka flourished through the Depression , but in 1939 , she and Kuffner left for the United States , eventually landing in Beverly Hills . Her reputation faded , and from Beverly Hills she moved to New York , then Houston and finally Cuernavaca , Mexico , where she died in 1980 . Theberge theorizes she could not adjust to the &quot; great break &quot; of the war . Her glamour-based style was suddenly outdated , in the same way that the glossy musicals and screwball comedies of 1930s Hollywood were replaced in the 1940s by film noir and serious drama . The Montreal exhibition was initially presented in Rome , organized by the Accademia di Francia and the Centro Culturale Alessandra Borghese . It was not intended to leave Italy , and Theberge had to do some hasty negotiation and organizing . As a result , it is not as complete or selective as he would have preferred . In addition to the portraits of Tadeusz di Lempicki , Solidor and the artist herself , critics have singled_out for praise a series of nudes , &quot; La belle Rafaela &quot; from 1927 and a portrait of the Duchesse de La Salle ( 1925 ) . But they have not been unstinting in their praise . For example , Ann Duncan in the Montreal Gazette praised De Lempicka ' s best work as &quot; striking and seductive &quot; but found her late work &quot; barely this side of paintings on black velvet. &quot; &quot; In the end , &quot; Duncan concluded , &quot; it is the woman that fascinates almost as much as her painting , which is an unsatisfactory state of affairs for any painter. &quot;</TEXT>
