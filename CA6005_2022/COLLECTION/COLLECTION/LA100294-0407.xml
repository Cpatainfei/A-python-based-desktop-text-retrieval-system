   <HEADLINE> MUTUAL_FUNDS : THIRD-QUARTER REVIEW FOR INVESTORS ; FIVE WAYS TO FIGHT FLAT RETURNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even if you are frustrated by the stock_market ' s lackluster performance , you don ' t have to throw_in_the_towel . You can earn respectable returns on mutual_funds in flat or bad markets , experts say , and you needn ' t give_up diversification to do_it . Today , many fund managers are looking_to overseas markets and investments shunned in better times -- namely , commodities such_as gold , oil , paper and industrial metals . Others are making money by betting against stocks . Here ' s a look_at the approaches of five successful fund managers . T . ROWE PRICE SPECTRUM GROWTH Peter Van Dyke , president of the T . Rowe Price Spectrum Growth Fund , doesn ' t have to search far to scan his universe of potential holdings . Instead of investing in particular stocks and bonds , Van Dyke invests his fund ' s assets in seven other T . Rowe Price funds . These seven funds specialize in everything from foreign equities and domestic growth_stocks to income-producing stocks and cash . The point of managing a fund that invests in other funds is diversification , Van Dyke says . Diversification limits stomach-churning market swings and , over the long_haul , should provide a healthy return to investors . Van Dyke is currently promoting three &quot; themes &quot; with Spectrum ' s investments : International , growth_stocks and natural_resource companies . The choices reflect Van Dyke ' s conviction that many parts of the U.S. stock_market have become overheated , but that stock_markets in other parts of the world are another story . Many foreign economies are still battling their way through economic downturns . Some are just beginning to recover . Their stock_markets haven ' t fully accounted_for the coming recoveries , he says . &quot; By going_to the international markets , you can pick_up some equity returns that beat U.S. returns , &quot; Van Dyke says . And you can reduce the overall volatility of your portfolio , because domestic and foreign markets are functioning on different economic cycles , he adds . The Spectrum Fund is limited to investing no more_than 20 % of its assets overseas . Van Dyke has been staying close to that limit for two years . If he could invest more of the fund ' s assets internationally , he would , he says . &quot; By going_to the international markets , you can pick_up some equity returns that beat U.S. returns , &quot; Van Dyke says .

The Spectrum fund is limited to investing no more_than 20 % of its assets overseas . Van Dyke has been staying close to that limit for two years . If he could invest more of the fund ' s assets internationally , he would , he says . In the domestic market , Spectrum is most heavily invested in T . Rowe Price funds that target fast-growing small companies , because Van Dyke thinks small firms ' prospects are better than those of bigger firms . He is also hot on funds holding natural_resource companies that tend to do_well toward the end of economic cycles . So far this year , Van Dyke ' s fund has done only slightly better than the market as_a_whole . Some experts say that ' s nonetheless impressive -- mainly because the fund has proved to be less volatile , and thus safer , than similar stock investments . * Assets : $ 843.1 million * Objective : Long-term growth by investing primarily in a diversified group of T . Rowe Price mutual_funds that invest in equity securities . * Top three investments : T . Rowe Price International Stock Fund T . Rowe Price Growth_Stock Fund T . Rowe Price New Horizons Fund * Sales charge : None * Annual expenses : 0.0 % * Performance : + 2.9 % YTD * Phone : ( 800 ) 638-7980 SOGEN INTERNATIONAL When domestic interest_rates ticked up this year , Jean-Marie Eveillard , manager of SoGen International Fund , bought fixed-income securities . Now 11 % of SoGen International ' s assets are in U.S. corporate_bonds and dollar-denominated South_American notes that pay double-digit yields . Historically , returns in the stock and bond markets have averaged between 9 % and 10 % , he explains . &quot; So , if I can get a five-year piece_of_paper with a 10 % yield , I ' m going_to just sit and clip coupons. &quot; The rest of the fund ' s assets are in cash ( 22 % ) , foreign stocks ( 35 % ) and gold-related securities ( 10 % ) . Only 22 % of SoGen International ' s assets are invested in the domestic stock_market . Why ? There are few bargains in the U.S. stock_market today , Eveillard says . Some foreign markets look better , but today ' s &quot; synchronized worldwide economic recovery &quot; is sure to spur some inflation . And , as far as stock and bond markets go , inflation spells n-e-r-v-o-u-s in all languages . The few stocks Eveillard is still buying are in businesses that do_well when inflation is rising : base metals , forest products and real_estate . And because he considers himself cautious , he is maintaining a healthy cash cushion to soften market blows . &quot; We have always been_on the side of caution , &quot; Eveillard says . &quot; When the markets are strong , that was not so good . But we hold_up well in a difficult market. &quot; Eveillard ' s strategy proved so attractive to skittish investors that they were pouring roughly $ 2 million a day into SoGen International earlier this year . Given the lack of opportunities in today ' s market , Eveillard says , he couldn ' t invest the money fast enough . He closed the fund to new investments and plans to keep it closed until investment opportunities improve . &quot; Otherwise we would begin to look_like a money_market fund , with 40 % to 50 % of our assets in cash , &quot; he explains . * Assets : $ 1.9 billion * Objective : Long-term growth primarily through investments in common_stocks of U.S. and foreign companies . * Top three investments : Bank for International Settlements bonds Freeport McMoran , preferred B , C &amp; D Carter Holt , NZ * Sales Charge : 3.75 % * Annual expenses : 1.28 % * Performance : + 6.1 % YTD * Phone : ( 800 ) 334-2134 DREYFUS SPECTRUM GROWTH If you think other experts sound negative about the market , you should talk to Robert K . Jermain , who manages Dreyfus Corp. ' s Strategic Growth Fund . &quot; We are calling_for a real live bear_market -- not an 8 % to 10 % correction like we had earlier this year , &quot; Jermain says . Translation : U.S. stock prices should fall 25 % to 35 % from their current levels before trending back_up , he says . &quot; There are signs out there that things are getting a little choppy . In our opinion , the next move of any significance will probably be down. &quot; How does a stock fund manager handle such a bleak scenario ? A whopping 63 % of Strategic Growth ' s assets are now in cash ; about 25 % is bet against the market in so-called &quot; short &quot; positions . The remainder is invested in the shares of commodity-producing companies -- oil , gas , paper , lumber , gold and other metals . Why is Jermain so sure the market is_on its way down ? Historically , market meltdowns come when stock prices become overvalued as measured by a plethora of gauges , such_as price-to-book values , price-to-earnings , price-to-cash flow and dividend yield , Jermain says . All those gauges indicate that U.S. stock prices are currently at pre-crash levels . Stock prices are more overvalued than they were before the 1987 crash ; more overvalued than before the corrections in 1969 , 1972 , and 1990 . They ' re even more overvalued now than they were before the crash in 1929 , Jermain says . Also ominous are rising interest_rates . that ' s bad for the market simply because it gives investors other viable investment opportunities . By and large , Jermain is most negative about small , fast-growing companies and health_care concerns that have rocketed in price over the past several months . He ' s &quot; short-selling &quot; these issues . That means he agrees to sell borrowed shares and repay those shares later . If the share price goes_up , he loses . If it goes_down , he collects a handy profit . Largely because of his short positions , Jermain ' s fund was the top-performing &quot; flexible portfolio &quot; fund during the market ' s midyear slide . But when stock prices rose strongly in August , Dreyfus Strategic Growth took it on the chin . For the first nine months of 1994 , the fund is up only 5.9 % . * Assets : $ 97.9 million * Objective : Long-term growth by investing in domestic companies , foreign companies and governments , as well as speculative techniques such_as short_selling , leverage and options . * Top Three Investments : Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 ( short position ) Oxford Health Plans ( short ) Cash ( short-term instruments ) * Sales charge : 3 % * Annual expenses : 1.62 % * Performance : + 5.9 % YTD * Phone : ( 800 ) 896-2649 FRANKLIN EQUITY INCOME FUND Find an industry in_trouble and Frank Felicelli is there . Whether it ' s health_care concerns threatened by reform or utility stocks that have fallen 30 % from their highs , the manager of Franklin Management ' s Equity Income Fund is willing to boldly go where others have fled . &quot; We have a fairly conservative strategy , &quot; Felicelli says . &quot; We invest in large companies . But we buy them when they are out of favor and we can get them at a very attractive dividend yield. &quot; Dividend yields on the Equity Income Fund ' s shares average 5.4 % , compared with an average yield of 2.7 % for the S &amp; P 500 , he notes . The fund does shy_away_from companies and industries that appear unlikely to recover . But industries that have simply taken hits because political or economic tides have turned against them are standard fare . How does he separate the underdogs from the underachievers ? &quot; We look_at a number of measurements -- price-to-book , price-to-cash flow , price- to- normalized earnings , &quot; Felicelli says . &quot; If we do_it right , we buy companies when they are so depressed that all they can do is go up. &quot; Health_care stocks -- particularly pharmaceuticals -- are now among Felicelli ' s favorites . &quot; We find that stocks move from extreme favor to extreme disfavor in a three-year cycle . Health stocks peaked in the fourth quarter of 1991 and are now approaching their three-year anniversary of being out of favor , &quot; he notes . &quot; Fundamentally , we think the companies have performed better than market expectations . Profit_margins have stabilized and improved . Felicelli also likes many of the major oil_companies and numerous utilities , including Pacific Telesis and Dominion Resources . Utilities tend to get hit in times of rising interest_rates , Felicelli notes . But utility stock prices have already plunged dramatically from their 1993 peak . It will take some time before the stock prices begin to come_back , he adds , but in the meantime , investors can pick_up some healthy dividend yields . * Assets : $ 87 million * Objective : High current income and capital appreciation through purchase of a diversified portfolio of common and preferred_stocks . * Top three investments : Bristol Myers American Home Products Kmart * Sales Charge : 4.5 % * Annual expenses : . 79 % * Performance : -0.7 % YTD * Phone : ( 800 ) 342-5236 FIDELITY VALUE FUND Jeff Ubben has been managing the Fidelity Value Fund since late 1992 . In that time , the fund ' s assets have doubled and it has handily outpaced the Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 market average . This year , while many other fund managers were twisting in the wind , Ubben produced a healthy 9.3 % return for the Value Fund ' s investors through Sept . 30 . His secret ? : World commodities . Ubben believes that the financial markets have drastically underestimated the effects of a rising standard_of_living in underdeveloped countries such_as China and India . And those improving standards are igniting an industrial and infrastructure buildup in the Third_World . &quot; I don ' t think many people appreciate the industrialization that we could go_through in Third_World countries , &quot; Ubben says . &quot; You always make money in commodities when demand surprises you. &quot; This year , Ubben has invested heavily in companies that produce oil , chemicals , aluminum and other industrial products . He ' s also weighted heavily in Japanese exporters , who are suffering now but are likely to reap substantial rewards if the dollar gains_ground , as Ubben is sure it will . He is convinced that currency markets have battered the dollar down further than any likely economic scenario would warrant . Ubben has a significant amount of his money in foreign markets -- 9 % in Japan , 7 % in Canada and 5 % to 6 % in Europe . These investments are mainly in companies that are producers of commodities such_as oil , paper and aluminum . And many of them sell their products in U.S. dollars , reducing currency risk . Still , the dollar ' s recent pummeling &quot; isn ' t helping me at all , &quot; Ubben complains . Nonetheless , he ' s sure the dollar will come_back , and his fund may benefit when it does . He stresses that in tough markets , you ' ve got_to be light on your feet . Once the stocks in his fund hit particular targets , &quot; I ' m gone , &quot; he says . &quot; I always sell early. &quot; * Assets : $ 3.3 billion * Objective : Capital appreciation through investments in undervalued companies . * Top three investments : Alcan Aluminum British Petroleum Schlumberger Ltd . * Sales charge : None * Annual expenses : 1.11 % * Performance : + 9.3 % YTD * Phone : ( 800 ) 544-8888</TEXT>
