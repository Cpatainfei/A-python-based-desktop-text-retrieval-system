   <HEADLINE> THE TIMES POLL ; MOST BACK HAITI PACT BUT OPPOSE SENDING TROOPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Americans generally approve of the negotiated settlement to the crisis in Haiti , but remain skeptical about long-term U.S. involvement in that country and unconvinced that any vital national interest is present there , according to The Times Poll . And while the public is more supportive of President Clinton ' s handling of Haiti than of his handling of the rest of his job , the sharply divided view of the Haitian situation has had no measurable impact on Clinton ' s overall standing or on domestic politics generally . Clinton ' s standing with the public remains low -- as low as at any point in his presidency -- and while Americans also remain skeptical of his Republican opposition , the GOP appears well-positioned to make substantial gains in this fall ' s midterm elections . According to the poll , the public remains opposed to sending U.S. troops to Haiti , fears that the forces will become bogged down there , distrusts the Haitian generals and offers limited support for any long-term effort to &quot; restore democracy &quot; to the troubled Caribbean_island . Americans do , however , accept &quot; stopping human_rights abuses &quot; as a justification for U.S. intervention in Haiti -- a result that underscores how important it is for the Administration over the next days and weeks to find ways of reining_in the Haitian armed forces . Overall , Americans approve of the agreement , 67 % to 27 % , but disapprove of sending troops to Haiti , 53 % to 43 % . Those who approve of the agreement but not of sending troops to enforce it tend to be women . Republicans and conservatives also are more likely to fall_into this category . Clinton ' s approval ratings show continued slippage since the last Times Poll , taken_in late July . That decline , which showed_up in other polls taken_in August and early September , appears unrelated to the Haitian crisis . Indeed , Clinton ' s handling of Haiti receives a narrowly favorable 47 % -44 % rating . Asked directly if Clinton ' s actions in Haiti made them feel more or less favorable toward the President , 65 % said the subject had no effect , 16 % said it made them more favorable and 16 % said less favorable . Nonetheless , only 52 % of those polled now say they see Clinton as an &quot; effective &quot; President while 46 % do not . Nine months ago , Clinton had a 65 % -32 % edge on that measurement . Only 34 % said they see Clinton as a &quot; strong and decisive leader &quot; as against 59 % who do not ; 40 % say Clinton has the &quot; moral authority to serve as commander_in_chief &quot; while 48 % say he does not ; and only 17 % say they have a good idea of Clinton ' s goals in foreign affairs , while 74 % do not . By 52 % to 42 % , the public disapproves of Clinton ' s overall handling of his job as President , up from 47 % to 45 % in July , and an extraordinarily high 34 % say they &quot; disapprove strongly , &quot; up from 27 % in July . Clinton receives even worse scores on two specific aspects of his job -- the public disapproves of his handling of the economy , 52 % to 39 % , and disapproves of his handling of foreign affairs , 55 % to 36 % . When asked which party they lean toward in this fall ' s House elections , voters are almost equally divided , with 44 % favoring the Democrats and 43 % the Republicans -- a result that points toward heavy losses this November from the Democratic congressional majorities . Democrats have generally led by much wider margins on this question . By 35 % to 33 % , those polled see Republicans as the party best able to handle the nation ' s major problems -- a small difference , but the first time in Clinton ' s presidency in which the Times Poll has found Republicans holding an edge on that question . The poll , supervised by Times Poll Director John Brennan , surveyed 1 # 340 adults nationwide Tuesday and Wednesday , Sept . 20 and 21 . The results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage_points . While Clinton has derived no benefit from events in Haiti , former President Jimmy_Carter appears to have improved markedly in public esteem . A decade ago , with then-President Ronald Reagan using bitter memories of Carter ' s performance in office as the foil for his &quot; Morning in America &quot; reelection campaign , Americans by 48 % to 44 % had an unfavorable view of Carter . Now , after several years of attention to his domestic charitable works and his international diplomacy -- and in the wake of his negotiations in Haiti and Korea -- the public views Carter favorably by a 68 % -14 % margin . His support extends even to self-identified conservatives , 65 % to 21 % , and Republicans , 60 % to 26 % . Americans believe Carter had significant influence on the negotiations , with 71 % saying he had either a &quot; great_deal &quot; or a &quot; good amount &quot; of influence , while only 16 % said they thought he did not have much influence . A second member of Carter ' s negotiating team , retired Gen . Colin L . Powell , former chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , is similarly popular , 65 % to 6 % , with 29 % saying they do not know enough about him to say . By comparison , the public ' s overall impression of Clinton , as opposed to his job performance , is only marginally favorable , 50 % to 47 % . The public approval of Carter comes even though the poll shows considerable doubts about the agreement he negotiated . Nearly half of those polled , 49 % , believe the deal is &quot; too lenient &quot; on Haiti ' s military_leaders . Only 5 % think it is too harsh , while 38 % say it is &quot; about right. &quot; Americans also have little confidence that the Haitian military will abide_by the agreement -- 54 % say they are doubtful about compliance , 30 % express some confidence , and only 9 % say they are very confident . Americans also do not accept a key part of Carter ' s description of how the negotiations happened . When asked if Clinton ' s decision to launch warplanes while the negotiations were going_on &quot; helped bring Haiti ' s military_leaders to terms , &quot; as the Administration maintains , or &quot; endangered the talks , &quot; as Carter says , 50 % say the launch helped . Only 19 % believe the launch endangered the talks , while 22 % say the move had little effect one way or the other . A large majority of those polled report that they have been &quot; closely following &quot; events in Haiti , with 32 % saying they are paying &quot; very close &quot; attention and another 52 % saying they have been following events there &quot; somewhat closely. &quot; When asked if they believe American troops &quot; will be able to finish their job and withdraw from Haiti in a fairly timely fashion , &quot; only 32 % say yes . A majority , 54 % , say they fear American forces will get &quot; bogged down &quot; in Haiti . Nonetheless , Americans are sharply divided on whether Clinton should &quot; immediately set a definite date for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces , &quot; with 47 % saying he should , while 48 % say the President should be &quot; allowed some flexibility &quot; on that subject . Overall , the public does not expect high casualties in Haiti . Only 6 % say they believe casualties will be heavy , while 70 % believe casualties will be light or none at all . Another 19 % expect moderate casualties . But whatever the casualty expectations , only 35 % say they accept the argument that the United States has &quot; vital interests &quot; in Haiti , while 54 % say no vital interests are at stake and 11 % are unsure . Clinton has made defense of U.S. interests a key argument in favor of his Haiti policy . Black Americans are far more likely than whites to agree with Clinton that American vital interests are at stake in Haiti . Blacks agree , 51 % to 37 % , while whites disagree , 32 % to 56 % . Blacks are also somewhat more likely to support U.S. military intervention in Haiti . By 56 % to 44 % , blacks approve of Clinton ' s decision to send troops to Haiti . Whites disapprove , 41 % to 54 % . A wider racial gulf shows_up on the question of whether the U.S. should provide economic aid to Haiti after democracy is restored . Blacks favor economic aid , 68 % to 22 % , while whites oppose the idea , 45 % to 50 % . Overall , 49 % of Americans favor aid , 46 % oppose it . Despite those signs of racial division , however , majorities of both blacks_and_whites reject the argument that Administration policy toward Haiti has been significantly affected by the fact that Haiti has an overwhelmingly black population . Majorities of both whites , 72 % , and blacks , 57 % , say that Haitians ' race has had &quot; little effect &quot; on Administration policy . Those whites who did think race played a role mostly think the impact has been for Haiti to receive more favorable treatment -- 16 % of whites take that view , while only 2 % think the opposite . Among blacks , opinion is more split , with 14 % thinking Haiti received more favorable treatment because of race and 18 % thinking the treatment has been less favorable . Blacks are also somewhat more likely than whites to believe that Haiti will be successful in achieving a &quot; stable democracy &quot; -- although doubters outnumber believers among both groups . Overall , 62 % of Americans , and of whites as well , say they are &quot; doubtful &quot; that Haiti can achieve a stable democracy , and only 32 % are confident it will . Among blacks , 48 % say they are doubtful , and 45 % say they are confident about Haiti ' s prospects for democracy . Republicans are far more skeptical than either Democrats or independents on that subject . Only 19 % of Republicans say they are confident that stable democracy can be established in Haiti . Given that skepticism , it is not surprising that Americans are not enamored of Clinton ' s argument that the need to &quot; restore democracy &quot; justifies a U.S. military presence in Haiti . Only 45 % of those polled say they think that was a good argument , while 47 % said it was not good . Similarly , those polled reject , 53 % to 40 % , the argument that the need to maintain U.S. credibility justified intervention . By contrast , Americans do support the argument that the military presence is needed to &quot; keep a flood of Haitian refugees from seeking to enter the United States. &quot; By 57 % to 39 % , those polled say that was a good argument . The most widely supported argument in favor of intervention , however , is the need to &quot; stop the human_right abuses by the current military government. &quot; By a 64 % -32 % margin , those polled say that was a good argument . Making_Sense of Haiti Although most Americans approve of the agreement that the United States signed with Haiti ' s military_leaders . . . Approve : 67 % Disapprove : 27 % Don ' t know : 6 % . . . they are not as confident about the outcome of the U.S. mission in that Caribbean nation . Are you confident or doubtful that the Haitian military_leaders will abide_by the agreement and step_down by Oct . 15 ? Confident : 39 % Doubtful : 54 % Don ' t know : 7 % Do you think U.S. troops will be able to finish their job and withdraw from Haiti or will they get bogged down ? Withdraw in timely fashion : 32 % Get bogged down : 54 % Don ' t know : 14 % While Clinton ' s job approval rating continues to slide . . . Approve : 42 % Disapprove : 52 % Don ' t know : 6 % . . . former President Jimmy_Carter and Colin L . Powell received favorable marks . Carter : Favorable : 68 % Unfavorable : 14 % Don ' t know : 18 % * Powell : Favorable : 65 % Unfavorable : 6 % Don ' t know : 29 % HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED The Times Poll interviewed 1 # 340 adults nationwide , by telephone , Sept . 20 and 21 . Telephone_numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the nation . Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and non-listed numbers could be contacted . The sample was weighted slightly to conform with census figures for sex , race , age and education . The margin of sampling error for the total sample is plus or minus 3 percentage_points . For certain sub-groups the error margin may be somewhat higher . Poll results can also be affected by other factors such_as question wording and the order in which questions are presented .</TEXT>
