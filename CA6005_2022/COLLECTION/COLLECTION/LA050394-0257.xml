   <HEADLINE> ALREADY RIDING THE HIGHWAY ; WHILE OTHERS TALK , GTE SAYS IT HAS BEEN MAKING INROADS IN COMMUNICATIONS RACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While most everyone in the telecommunications business has been talking urgently about the coming of the information superhighway , where has quiet GTE Corp . been ? Building the information superhighway , GTE says . GTE was , in fact , one of the first to test complicated interactive voice , video and data services , such_as home banking , shopping , education and movies on demand , in a five-year experiment in Cerritos . Run_by GTE California , the Thousand Oaks-based unit of the parent company , the Cerritos project is now ending , and is regarded_as a sobering lesson by some observers who say it cast doubt on consumers ' willingness to pay_for additional entertainment and other services . Possibly chastened by Cerritos , Stamford , Conn.-based GTE , the nation ' s largest independent phone_company , is now charting a conservative course in the mad race among phone , cable , software and wireless communications companies to transform themselves into the communications providers of tomorrow . Contributing to the chaos is that Congress and federal regulators haven ' t decided on the ground_rules . Yet while other phone and cable companies tried to make mega merger deals to be ready for an interactive_multimedia future , GTE waited . In November , California ' s other regional phone_company , Pacific Telesis Group in San Francisco , announced an ambitious six-year plan to spend $ 16 billion bringing consumers interactive video and data services , and other phone_companies quickly followed with similar announcements . But GTE California made no such financial commitment , and its parent company said only that it would follow up Cerritos with another test of interactive phone , video and data services in Manassas , Va . Now that various phone-cable deals are crumbling -- including Bell Atlantic ' s proposed acquisition of cable TV giant Tele-Communications Inc. , which was scuttled in February -- GTE looks wiser . GTE ' s quietness , said A . Michael Noll , a professor at USC ' s Annenberg School of Communication , &quot; implies sense &quot; because it didn ' t rush into an expensive merger deal before the benefits of such a transaction are known . While displaying caution , GTE must also prepare itself for a future that ' s far from clear . As phone monopolies are dismantled and technology improves , local phone_companies such_as GTE want to become providers of not just voice communications but all sorts of services , including entertainment and educational video on demand , large-volume data transfers , and communications links between businesses and consumers . In transforming itself , GTE faces plenty of potential competition from cable concerns , long-distance phone_companies and wireless communications providers , which are also spending billions on new equipment and technologies . Movie studios , newspapers and computer software firms , too , are trying to figure_out where they will fit_in to the predicted explosion of information for businesses and consumers . So , despite all its reserve , GTE is now beginning to market some information superhighway products . In March , GTE rolled_out a group of business services_called the World Class Network . Along this network , companies , universities and government_agencies can tap into video conferencing , transfer high volumes of computer data over fiber-optic phone_lines , and make three-way phone_calls . These services aren ' t entirely new , but with technology gains , GTE can now make them better , faster and cheaper . Targeting Businesses The information highway &quot; happens first in corporate America , &quot; GTE California President Larry Sparrow said . &quot; It is happening there today. &quot; Because data communications -- transmitting massive amounts of computer data -- is projected to grow four times faster than voice communications , GTE is tailoring its marketing efforts accordingly and telling businesses that it can save them money . The key here , GTE says , is that its new fiber-optic lines are cheaper to maintain than old copper phone wires , and each fiber strand , thinner than a human hair , can carry vast amounts of information at very high speeds compared to a copper wire . GTE California engineers say that hospitals , for instance , could link up with their suppliers and vastly increase their ability to share data . A publisher could transmit 50 pages of a book over phone_lines in less than a second , and the time it takes_for credit_card transactions to be approved could be reduced from 30 seconds to five seconds . Big investments over the past several years are allowing GTE to provide these services . Last year alone , GTE ' s capital_expenditures totaled $ 3.9 billion -- $ 500 million in California -- much of it spent on technology and equipment upgrades . Over the past several years , it has laid 650 # 000 miles of fiber-optic cable throughout the United States . Like others , GTE has been laying fiber-optic cables in big rings in urban_areas , allowing it to reroute transmissions along one side of a ring should the other side fail -- a big selling point to corporate customers who require reliable service . GTE has also installed super-fast digital switches that can route mind-boggling amounts of data . In California , 94 % of GTE ' s network will be digital by the end of the year . &quot; GTE is in real good_shape in terms of having the pavement down on the highway , &quot; said analyst Frederic H . Dickson at the investment_firm D . A . Davidson &amp; Co . in Great Falls , Mont . GTE California will be a big market for these information highway services , Sparrow said , by virtue of its sheer size . California provides about 15 % of GTE Corp. ' s $ 20 billion in revenue and , in recent years , has accounted_for 11 % to 22 % of its operating profit . Los Angeles is one of eight areas targeted for the World Class Network . Still , Steve Harris , external affairs vice_president at Pacific Bell , Pacific Telesis ' phone_company subsidiary , said the World Class Network gives little insight about GTE ' s real plans for the information highway . &quot; We ' re all sort of waiting to see what it means. &quot; Company ' Has to Move ' Some analysts suggest that GTE has been reticent so far because it is still paying_for its $ 6-billion 1991 merger with telecommunications company Contel Corp . But outsiders expect that GTE will get more aggressive . &quot; The PacTel announcement changed the landscape for everyone &quot; because Pacific Telesis said its costs of providing interactive services to homes would be a fraction of what was previously assumed , said Jonathan Seybold , publisher of the Digital Media newsletter in Malibu . Now GTE &quot; has to move. &quot; Indeed , Sparrow hinted that an announcement about GTE ' s plans to bring interactive voice , video and data services to consumers would be made within weeks . A GTE alliance with another company to provide programming for the information highway is also in the cards , he said . Sparrow denied that the Cerritos experiment dampened GTE ' s enthusiasm for the information highway . He insisted that the company achieved its goal of learning about technology and how consumers react to a sudden growth of services , and GTE will use this information as it begins marketing multimedia products in_earnest . &quot; I assure you , &quot; he said , &quot; we would not be investing a dime in this technology if we didn ' t think we could sell it. &quot; As GTE and other companies spend the money and jockey for position , however , Congress and regulators are still grappling to set policy . Local and long-distance phone_companies and cable operators all want free access to each other ' s markets and , although there are many bills in Congress , little has been decided as yet . As a result of the final_decisions that come_out of Washington , Sparrow said , &quot; we will either have the super information highway or not have it. &quot; As GTE hopes to compete in new markets , analysts point to its strength in the cellular_phone business as evidence that GTE can be opportunistic . GTE is the nation ' s second-largest cellular_phone provider in a market that ' s expected to grow from $ 12 billion to $ 50 billion in five years , and could play an important role in providing information highway services . GTE won praise for its recent announcement of a low-priced pocket phone_service , called Telego , which will be capable of transmitting data as well as voice . GTE also plans to bid in upcoming Federal Communications Commission auctions for licenses for personal communications service , a wireless technology that offers phone , paging and data transmission . So when will the payoff come ? For GTE , analysts say , technology and service investments are paying_off already in increased efficiency . They say the money GTE has spent sprucing_up its network was needed as much as a defense against new rivals as_to prepare_for multimedia services that might never come_to pass . If business customers sign_up for GTE ' s World Class Network , profits could come_in a year or two , they say . But the profit potential of the vast information superhighway remains unknown , and years away at best . Companies will likely need to alter plans many times , and product life spans will grow ever shorter as technology improves . The dilemma for companies like GTE is &quot; what they deploy now could be obsolete in a year , but if you don ' t deploy now , you lose , &quot; said analyst Robert B . Wilkes of the New York investment_firm Brown Brothers Harriman . For now , Sparrow said , GTE must be as efficient as possible . The parent company plans to lay off 17 # 000 workers nationwide over the next three years ; a big reason for the cuts , Sparrow said , is that new technology has reduced manpower needs . GTE ' s biggest challenge now , he said , lies_in &quot; changing the culture of our company out of that regulated mentality to one of a fully competitive , marketplace mentality . We need that sense of urgency , the sense of ' We ain ' t good_enough , we ' ve got_to get better. ' &quot;</TEXT>
