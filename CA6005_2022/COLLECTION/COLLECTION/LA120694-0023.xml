   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON PROSTITUTION ; PROSECUTION OR PERSECUTION ? ; HEIDI FLEISS ' TRIAL SHOWED THE HYPOCRISY IN MAKING A COMMON TRANSACTION A ' SERIOUS ' SEX CRIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Free Heidi Fleiss ( and all other women incarcerated for prostitution-related offenses ) ! Fleiss is the latest prominent victim of a legal_system that primarily punishes women for acts committed equally by women and men . We can remedy this inequity by legalizing prostitution , regulating and taxing sex workers and redirecting law_enforcement to real sex crimes with real victims , like rape and sexual abuse of children . We can no longer accept the rampant sexism in prostitution prosecutions . Women do not commit acts of prostitution alone any more_than women get pregnant alone . Our law-enforcement system chooses to ignore the fact that most prostitution consists_of private , consensual sexual_activity between two persons , usually a woman and a man . But in every state where prostitution is a crime , it is overwhelmingly women , not men , who are rounded_up like sheep , demeaned , jailed and fined -- and then released to continue turning tricks . Meanwhile , the men , who engaged in illegal acts just as much as the women , are free to patronize other prostitutes . One answer may be equal enforcement of the law against customers rather than continued enforcement of a double_standard replete with blatant gender bias . But there ' s an even better solution : Legalize and regulate the sex industry . Prostitution isn ' t immoral ; hurting women is . Prostitution is simple and direct : Man ( almost always ) pays woman ( usually ) for sex ; man gets sexual_pleasure for money , woman gets money for her labor . It is as simple a transaction as selling blood or the use of a uterus for nine months by surrogate_mothers . What is wrong is the hypocrisy of the criminal-justice system ' s distinction between legal and illegal sex workers and the painful , disproportionate suffering heaped upon real women as a result . Why is it immoral to be paid_for an act that is perfectly legal if done for free ? The lines that our society has drawn_in the name of morality have become absurd . A woman may agree to sexual acts with men she doesn ' t love as long as she does not directly charge them for sex . She may legally pose nude for money , genitalia displayed , for photographers . She may dance nude , as provocatively as the customer likes , for money . She may engage in sexual acts for money with men she does not know or like in erotic films , magazines or before a live audience . She may sell her voice for &quot; phone sex &quot; with strange men . She may give a naked man an erotic massage . She may marry a man she does not love and have_sex in return for his financial_support for the rest of her married life . Yet the sale of direct sexual acts remains illegal . The argument that prostitution hurts women cannot justify criminalizing its victims . To the contrary . The problems with prostitution are a direct result of its illegality . Sexually transmitted diseases and drug_abuse would be decreased if sex workers were licensed , screened , tested and treated rather than being driven underground . Unprotected , uninsured sex workers are the real victims who deserve legal_status and an end to government-funded harassment . The reality of prostitution is that most women do_it not as a true &quot; choice , &quot; but only because they cannot support themselves and their children any other way . It is a sad truth that in our culture , the only occupations in which women as a group earn more_than men as a group are prostitution and nude modeling . Ultimately , why is Heidi Fleiss going_to jail ? ( Pandering carries a sentence of mandatory prison time in California. ) It is because she is a businesswoman who brought_together men who desired to pay women for sex and women who desired to get paid_for sex . Do you think that ' s immoral ? Then don ' t do_it yourself , but don ' t ask_for our tax dollars to support the vast system devoted to arresting , prosecuting , convicting , incarcerating and monitoring prostitutes .</TEXT>
