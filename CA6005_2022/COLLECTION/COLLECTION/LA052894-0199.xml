   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : ANAHEIM ; CAMPAIGN LAW REVISIONS ADVANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The City_Council has moved ahead with plans to strengthen a 1993 campaign spending ordinance intended to keep stricter tabs on a candidate ' s campaign bank_accounts . The council gave tentative approval to restricting a candidate ' s ability to transfer funds between campaign war_chests . For example , if a candidate ran unsuccessfully for an office outside Anaheim , the candidate would be limited in the amount of leftover funds that could be used in a local campaign . At most , the candidate could transfer $ 1 # 000 per contributor , but it would probably be less , depending_on a formula that takes_into_account the percentage spent in the election outside Anaheim , according to City Atty . Jack L . White . &quot; What we have tried to do here is to put everyone on the proverbial level playing_field , &quot; White said at this week ' s council meeting . &quot; It ' s rather complex and difficult to explain and maybe more difficult to enforce. &quot; White said the new wording could be challenged in court on First_Amendment grounds , but he believes the restriction would pass a legal test . &quot; The law is not totally settled in this area , &quot; added White . &quot; But I think ( the revision ) is defensible. &quot; The council also tentatively OKd two other changes to the July , 1993 , ordinance . Both items would require candidates to report campaign contributions more thoroughly and to indicate what funds are being used to pay_off old campaign debts . The council is expected to give final approval to the changes June 7 . Political activists Shirley Grindle and Alexander Carrassi II , who originally proposed the modifications to the city in March , praised the council for tightening controls on candidates .
