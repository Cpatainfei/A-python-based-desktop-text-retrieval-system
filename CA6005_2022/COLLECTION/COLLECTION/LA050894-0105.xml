   <TEXT> To human visitors , the apple orchard at the Rodale Institute Research_Center smells of damp soil and ripe fruit . But to a certain brown moth , it ' s awash in a dizzying sexual perfume that leaves him reeling -- and unfulfilled . &quot; It ' s called mating confusion , &quot; said horticulturist Terry Schettini . &quot; The poor guy doesn ' t know where to go. &quot; Unable to find a mate , he can ' t produce larvae to feed_on the apples . The result : no wormy apples . And because the trick is done with insect sex attractants , not pesticides , there are no toxic residues on the apples . The organic apple orchard is a work_in_progress . But Rodale ' s scientists have shown they can raise corn and soybeans without pesticides , and bring_in as_many crops as farms that use chemicals . In past years these findings might have been ignored in the dusty halls of the Agriculture_Department . But there ' s been a change of heart in Washington . The Clinton_Administration -- prompted partly by a National Academy of Sciences report warning that pesticide residues could be harming American children -- has proposed a package of reforms aimed at reducing pesticide use on 75 % of the country ' s farm acreage by 2000 . The Department_of_Agriculture has gotten the message . Suddenly , &quot; Agriculture is_on the side of the table that says it ' s a good idea to reduce the use of pesticides . that ' s a major breakthrough , &quot; said Allen Jennings of the Environmental Protection Agency ' s pesticide office . A decade ago , advocates of organic farming were about as welcome at the Agriculture_Department as boll_weevils in a cotton field . Production was the focus , and no one quite believed that farms could still rack_up impressive yields without pesticides . There was a brief interlude , during the Jimmy_Carter Administration , when organic farming research gained a toehold at USDA . In 1980 , Garth Youngberg , an Agriculture_Department planner , issued a report concluding that many pests could be controlled without chemicals -- and that organic farming could be done at a profit . &quot; There was a lot of interest in that report , a huge amount of interest , &quot; Youngberg recalled . His superiors responded by eliminating his job . &quot; Just the statement that organic farming was feasible was enough to get Garth Youngberg fired , &quot; said Rhonda Janke , Rodale ' s director_of_research . Times have changed , however , and Janke and her colleagues are no longer thought of as unrealistic zealots . &quot; I think the Rodale people are fairly objective , &quot; said Richard Amerman of the USDA ' s Agricultural Research Service in Beltsville , Md . One sign of the change in attitude : Amerman ' s agency now stations one of its own researchers at Rodale ' s experimental farm . Rodale has compromised too . It no longer takes an all-or-none approach to pesticide use . Recognizing that many farmers may be unwilling to discard pesticides overnight , the institute is working with a network of private farmers to help them meet the lesser goal of reducing pesticide use . &quot; We don ' t tell farmers what to use and not to use , &quot; Janke said . Experiments in pesticide-free agriculture are confined to the institute ' s own fields . &quot; We feel that researchers should take more risks than farmers . We get paid at the end of the week whether we get a crop or not , and farmers don ' t. &quot; Still , though Rodale and other organic enthusiasts may have moderated their aims , they have not moderated their view that chemicals represent a menace -- or that the trend in chemical use is alarming . During the last 30 years , U.S. pesticide use has tripled , and the use of synthetic fertilizers has doubled , according to the World Resources Institute . Rain washes many of those chemicals into the nation ' s rivers and lakes , making agricultural runoff the leading cause of pollution of lakes and streams . U.S. farm programs have not only failed to protect the environment , they ' ve actually encouraged soil_erosion and pollution , the World Resources Institute concluded in a recent report . Farmers are paid subsidies according to how much they produce , independent of the effect on the environment . Furthermore , they are not reimbursed for , say , planting ground_cover to control soil_erosion and restore soil nutrients . that ' s a key feature of Rodale ' s cropping systems . In 1947 , decades before these problems became apparent , J . I . Rodale bought a dilapidated , 68-acre farm 60 miles north of Philadelphia to try_out some of the ideas he was espousing in his new magazine on organic gardening . The magazine , now called Organic Gardening , blossomed into the Rodale Press , the publisher of Prevention magazine and other magazines and books . The farm grew to be the Rodale Institute , a nonprofit research and educational_institution . ( Rodale Press contributes money to Rodale Institute , but the two are separate. ) The Rodale Institute ' s largest study of organic farming began in 1981 , when researchers began a side-by-side comparison of conventional farming and organic alternatives . The experiment was designed to show whether organic farming could be commercially feasible . First , the researchers rejected earlier studies by the chemical_industry . &quot; The chemical companies would run experiments and withdraw all pesticides and fertilizers and get , say , 10 % of the normal yield , &quot; Janke said . Their conclusion , said Janke , was , &quot; We ' re all going_to starve to death without pesticides and fertilizers. &quot; Janke and her colleagues decided the companies were right -- to a point . &quot; You can ' t grow corn , soybeans , corn , soybeans and withdraw pesticides , &quot; said Janke . The key to getting_rid_of chemicals , Janke said , was to change the crop rotation . In the Rodale organic cropping systems , rye_grass is often used to hold the soil . Legumes like red_clover and hairy_vetch are planted in between corn and soybeans to prevent soil_erosion and to put nitrogen back into the soil . In some systems , the entire corn plant is harvested and the stalks are allowed to ferment -- producing animal feed . &quot; We went cold turkey when we withdrew the chemicals , and we did have a yield decrease before the organic nitrogen kicked_in , &quot; she said . &quot; Since ' 84 , though , all three systems have yielded the same &quot; in corn and soybeans . The organic systems have other advantages too , she said . &quot; We think the nutrient system ' s tighter in these systems , and we ' ll have less nitrogen leaking , &quot; she said . Nitrogen , a critical nutrient on the farm , is a disruptive pollutant when it drains off the farm , spurring the growth of choking weeds and algae in lakes and rivers . The experiment , said Janke , &quot; turned USDA around. &quot; That doesn ' t mean , however , that all corn and soybean farmers can swear_off pesticides tomorrow . The change may require an investment in new equipment , for example . It is also likely to require much more intensive management of the farm . In conventional crop systems , farmers spray on a predetermined schedule with a mixture of chemicals recommended by the county extension_agent . Farmers can plan weeks and months ahead . In organic and reduced-pesticide systems , farmers must actively monitor the fields , said Michael Sands , another Rodale scientist . &quot; Some people call it reading the ecosystem , &quot; he said . &quot; How many weeks do I have ? What ' s the rainfall ? How does my crop look ? How much nitrogen is in the soil ? . . . That takes a bit of thinking. &quot; At the Agriculture_Department , researchers are trying to figure_out how to get the word out_to farmers . &quot; You have to distinguish between the rhetorical discussions about organic farming and what happens in the field , &quot; said Larry Elworth , who specializes in pesticide policy .</TEXT>
