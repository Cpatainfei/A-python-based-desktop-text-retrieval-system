   <TEXT> A wayward rat shut_down the UC Berkeley campus for six hours Friday when it stumbled onto the university ' s main power_cable , a university spokesman said . The rat , which was badly charred , crawled inside the central campus substation about 5:30 a.m. , where it formed a circuit between the university ' s Pacific Gas &amp; Electric switch and a steam-energy source , shorting out the campus . The blackout left hundreds of offices and laboratories and about 10 # 000 employees without power while emergency generators supplied electricity to the university Police_Department , vital lab and health services , and an animal facility . Most students are_on vacation until Tuesday .</TEXT>
