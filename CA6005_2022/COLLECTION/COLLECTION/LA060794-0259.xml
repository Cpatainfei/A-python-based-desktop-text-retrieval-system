   <HEADLINE> PACIFIC RIM TRADE ; CALIFORNIA ; GOLDEN STATE FINDS GOLDEN OPPORTUNITIES IN ASIA ; ALREADY THE U.S. LEADER IN EXPORTS TO THE REGION , WE ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF HELPING DEVELOPING NATIONS IMPROVE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s ties across the Pacific were once a simple matter of exports and imports . Not so anymore . Take Advanced Aerodynamics &amp; Structures Inc. , a fledgling North Hollywood maker of corporate jets . Its president , Carl Chen , was born in Fuzhou on the southeastern coast of China , and in 1949 , when he was 4 , his family fled to Taiwan ahead of the Communist takeover of the mainland . Chen arrived in the United States in 1968 , was educated at UCLA and Caltech and worked for Hughes Aircraft Co . before helping found AASI four years ago . The company ' s main financial backers include a Taiwanese industrialist , Yeh Song Gen , who has helped raise $ 25 million to develop the single-engine Jetcruzer , which is awaiting Federal Aviation Administration certification . And the company is seeking customers not just in the United States , but also in Europe , the Middle_East and in Asia , where Chen ' s language capability -- he speaks Mandarin and other dialects of Chinese -- provides an entree . It is the foreign ties that Chen hopes will make his firm one of the few successful aircraft start-ups in recent years , eventually creating hundreds of new , high-wage jobs . California cities such_as Palmdale and Long_Beach already are vying for AASI ' s manufacturing_plant against competitors as far away as Virginia , South_Africa and Israel . &quot; I think the Pacific Rim will take 30 % ( of the business ) eventually , &quot; Chen said . &quot; Especially China , because they just opened_up and they need lots of high tech and aircraft to fill the gap. &quot; AASI is a prime example of the ever-increasing integration of the economy and entrepreneurs of California with those of Asia -- to the benefit of both . California ' s Asian ties now involve firms as large as Hughes Aircraft , which is developing an extensive network of satellite communications for Indonesia and Malaysia , and as small as AASI , which currently employs only 20 to 30 people . The economies of Asian_nations -- with Japan a notable exception -- are among the most robust in the world , with growth_rates approaching 8 % a year , said Richard Drobnick , director of the Center for International Business at USC . And California is uniquely positioned to take_advantage of expanding market opportunities there . &quot; Because of our Asian connections through the university systems , through immigration and through all_of the Asian firms that have located their subsidiaries here as their entry point into the U.S. , we are more connected than other states with these high-growth economies , &quot; Drobnick explained . Already , California is by far the leading state exporting to Asia . The value figure has grown from $ 22.4 billion in 1988 to $ 33.5 billion in 1993 , an increase of more_than 9 % a year , according to the Massachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research . California ' s rising exports to Asia have taken_place in a period when its shipments to other parts of the world have remained flat or fallen . Economics writer Joel Kotkin says the future lies not so_much with Japan , whose growth has stalled , but elsewhere in Asia . &quot; The big change for California in the 1990s will be the shift from being Japan-centered to East Asian-centered , predominantly the Chinese diaspora and China , &quot; said Kotkin , author of &quot; Tribes , &quot; a book that examines the successful business_relationships among Chinese immigrants around the world . &quot; It ' s already taking_place : in investment , in the fastest-growing markets and in the immigration networks that are being formed. &quot; * Other experts point to South_Korea , Indonesia , Malaysia and Thailand as nations with great promise for increased California trade and investment as those economies awaken . The two-way trade covers everything &quot; from airplanes to xylophones , &quot; Drobnick says . The American and California toy_industries , for example , count_on Chinese manufacturers for much of their inventory . Asian importers , meanwhile , depend_on California for off-season fresh produce such_as oranges and cherries . Lately , however , California firms have been at the forefront of helping developing Asian_nations improve their infrastructures and industries , selling them commercial aircraft , telecommunications hardware , computers and software , high-tech equipment , even power_plants : * McDonnell Douglas ' Long Beach-based Douglas Aircraft unit makes and exports MD-80 commercial jets for assembly in Shanghai in a deal valued at more_than $ 1 billion . * Irvine-based AST Research Inc. , a maker of personal_computers , was the first major PC maker to enter the Chinese market and remains the biggest seller of such computers there . * In February , Mission Energy , the Irvine-based power-generation unit of SCEcorp and sister firm of Southern California Edison Co. , said it will become a leading partner in an international consortium that will build , own and operate a major new power_plant in Indonesia . The project is one of the most visible in a major push by Asian_nations to upgrade their electrical_power grids to meet the needs of expanding economies , experts say . The Indonesia project will involve construction costs of $ 1.8 billion and employ 3 # 500 workers to build and operate it . Mission ' s partners include General Electric Co. , Japan ' s Mitsui &amp; Co . and Indonesia ' s P . T . Batu Hitam Perkasa . Upon completion in 1998 , the plant will be one of the largest privately owned power_plants in the world , and a model for others . &quot; This certainly represents a major element of the future . . . in Indonesia and in China , &quot; said Mission ' s president and chief_executive , Edward R . Muller . &quot; Mission Energy , based here in California , will be leading such projects all_over the world. &quot; Similarly , Hughes Aircraft ' s space and communications company has been designing and making satellites since the 1970s to help tie Indonesia ' s 14 # 000 islands together with modern communications . Last April , the company signed a multimillion-dollar contract to build the third generation of such satellites , the so-called Palapa-C series of two satellites to be launched in 1995 and 1996 . All told , several generations of satellites have represented between $ 350 million and $ 400 million in Indonesian contracts for Hughes , said project manager George Tadler . * For Tadler , who has been to Indonesia eight times in recent years to coordinate the projects , the pace at which nations such_as Indonesia are investing in California-generated 21st-Century technology results in startling contrasts . &quot; The countryside is like any other Asian Pacific nation : primitive , with rice fields and people living_in substandard housing . . . . People still wash clothes in rivers and bays , &quot; he said . &quot; But when you get_to the cities , like Jakarta , there are tall modern glass buildings , and every place you look they ' re putting_up new high-rise structures. &quot; As a result , he said , &quot; there ' s lots of stuff we can do for Indonesia . There ' s direct ( satellite ) television , which we ' re introducing to the U.S. right about now , and . . . it ' s certainly something Indonesia could use . . . . Also , there are satellite systems for mobile communications , and they ' re thinking and talking_about that. &quot; Indeed , a sister company , Hughes Network Systems Inc. , said in April that it had signed an $ 80-million contract with a public-private Indonesian joint_venture to begin supplying a new wireless_telephone system for customers in Jakarta . The California connection works_on a variety of levels , and the state could find itself unusually vulnerable to the vagaries of politics . For example , if instead of renewing China ' s most-favored-nation status , President Clinton had decided to revoke or modify it , such a step could have had a considerable effect on the state ' s economy , business_leaders argue . California exports to China alone total more_than $ 1.7 billion annually , supporting about 35 # 000 state jobs , according to the Business Coalition for U.S.-China Trade , an ad-hoc group of about 400 state businesses that opposed eliminating China ' s trade status . * The state ' s farming leaders , meanwhile , worry about the prospects of agricultural embargoes by Japan , South_Korea and other Asian_nations that say they fear importation of the Mediterranean_fruit_fly . A February study by UC Berkeley Prof . Jerome B . Siebert predicted that an embargo would focus_on several varieties of fruit and vegetable crops , result in short-term losses of $ 564 million in net revenue a year and ultimately set_back the state ' s agricultural economy by $ 1 billion to $ 1.4 billion . That loss would ripple through the state ' s overall economy , resulting in reduced output and income and losses of up_to 14 # 189 state jobs , Siebert said . So far , however , there ' s no sign that Asian_nations will mount such an embargo , and the Japanese , for one , continue to buy California produce .</TEXT>
