   <HEADLINE> HEAT RAVE ; THE HOT TROPIC OF CONVERSATION THIS SEASON IS THE WARMING TREND OF ISLE STYLES THAT ARE SIMPLE , LOOSE AND NEUTRAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pleasure-seekers wanting to escape the winter rains for tropical heat need wardrobes that will help them adapt to the sun , sand and friendly natives . Island getaways require the kind of relaxed clothing designed for unwinding on the beach , sipping drinks festooned with paper umbrellas . When in doubt about what to pack , vacationers should do as the islanders do -- find clothes that are cool and comfortable , in fun prints that lift the spirits . Fortunately , spring collections that are perfect for weathering the tropical heat are just arriving in_stores . The clothes have simple lines , loose construction and neutral hues that make them ideal for the islands . The shades of blue , white , taupe , beige and other neutrals let tourists blend_in with their surroundings instead of standing out like , well , tourists . Sure to put one in the vacation mode are spring ' s bold ethnic , floral and tropical prints . Escada has a collection of blue and white tropical print separates , just the thing for distant shores . The collection includes a tropical-print chiffon chemise ( $ 760 ) that can tie at the waist to beat the heat , a silk jumpsuit ( $ 1 # 000 ) , sheer silk palazzos ( $ 600 ) , a short-sleeved , double-breasted jacket in solid navy ( $ 800 ) and relaxed silk shorts ( $ 420 ) . All pieces mix and match to stretch one ' s limited vacation wardrobe . &quot; Tropical prints are a great vacation look . They lend themselves to casual dressing , &quot; says Michele Vicale , manager of Escada in South Coast Plaza , Costa Mesa . &quot; It ' s also a theme that plays very well to the lifestyle of Southern California. &quot; These are not the wild tropical prints of seasons past . They come_in two or three subtler colors instead of a riot of Carmen Miranda brights . &quot; It ' s very clean , very understated , &quot; Vicale says . &quot; Marine navy replaces black for spring . It ' s neutral ground to work from. &quot; Loose-fitting clothes in natural_fibers , such_as walking shorts made of cotton or linen blends , are popular travel companions , says Mary Rubenstein , co-owner of Mi Place in Laguna Niguel and Fullerton . Tanks , shells , lightweight fly-away jackets , lace skirts and flared-bottom pants in natural tones top her list of what to take_on vacation . &quot; All the beiges , creams , khakis -- it ' s a big year for those colors , &quot; Rubenstein says . En Route , a group of rayon separates in earth-toned Tahitian prints , is just the thing for island dressing . The collection ' s flowy jacket ( $ 280 ) , tank_top ( $ 85 ) , palazzos ( $ 95 ) and other components all mix . Mix-and-match separates are just the ticket for travelers with small suitcases . Collections that feature coordinates in the same color group but different prints allow vacationers to get maximum mileage from a_few pieces . &quot; We like to mix patterns in the same color story , &quot; says Sylvia Rodriguez , owner of My Girl in Corona del Mar . One collection of separates by Sugar and Spice comes_in a variety of prints that work together thanks to the brown and beige color combination . There ' s a vest-style top ( $ 340 ) , a jacket ( $ 520 ) , palazzos ( $ 400 ) , a sheer skirt ( $ 300 ) and shorts ( $ 280 ) that are all interchangeable . Rodriguez encourages her vacation-bound customers to experiment with styles , wearing a skirt unbuttoned to the thigh to show some leg or a sheer blouse for those unwilling to bare their skin entirely . &quot; Your vacation wardrobe should be different ( from ) your usual day-to-day wardrobe . You should be freer , &quot; she says . Instead of the body-hugging , stretchy styles of springs past , this year ' s loose-fitting clothes flatter the figure with subtle , body-baring details such_as skirts that slit to reveal a thigh or tunics that tie_in front to expose the midriff . &quot; Everything is loose-fitting , untucked , drapey chic . The styles allow_for comfort and tastefulness . There ' s nothing close to the body . But there is bareness , &quot; says Sandy Magill Duckworth , district_manager for Mondi at MainPlace / Santa Ana and Fashion Island Newport Beach . The pieces in Mondi ' s La Nature collection , for instance , include a wrap top that exposes the midriff ( $ 170 ) with a full slitted skirt ( $ 230 ) in a brown and taupe Indian print . &quot; The slits are high , but the clothes don ' t fit tight , &quot; Magill Duckworth says . &quot; It ' s a peekaboo type of thing . There are very long skirts with a slit up the thigh , but no hot pants. &quot; Many garments , such_as the loose-fitting , cocoa-colored vest ( $ 190 ) and matching trousers ( $ 230 ) , come_in synthetic fabrics such_as microfiber or viscose that don ' t wrinkle , making them ideal for travel . &quot; You can put that entire outfit in your handbag , &quot; and it will come_out ready to be worn , Duckworth says . &quot; You could sleep_in it on the airplane on your way to the Bahamas , and look just as stunning when you get_off as when you got on. &quot;</TEXT>
