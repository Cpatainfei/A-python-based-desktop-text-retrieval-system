   <HEADLINE> ANYTHING FOR A LAUGH ? ; COMEDY : STAND-UP VETERANS PUSH THE ENVELOPE , BUT IT ' S A PERSONAL DECISION , NOT ONE FOR THE CENSORS , THEY SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The audience is roaring . Peals of laughter are echoing off the walls of Igby ' s comedy club . Eyes are tearing , and knees are being slapped . Dennis Wolfberg is talking_about his colon . The veteran stand-up comedian often closes his sets with an excruciatingly funny 10 minutes on an excruciatingly invasive colon exam he suffered through some years back . A slapstick pastiche of unsympathetic nurses , breezy doctors and gigantic medical implements , it ' s not the kind of material anybody could make funny , or would attempt to . But , for Wolfberg , it works . &quot; I did that bit on ' The Tonight Show , ' and it was a major turning point in my career . I ' m now shallow enough to admit that I ' d go_after a joke anywhere , &quot; he says with a chuckle . &quot; My material generally comes from my personal experiences and my family and is usually self-deprecating . that ' s what I ' m comfortable doing . But I also have great admiration for comics who can get laughs with subjects I would n ' t touch in a_million years . Virtually anything can be funny. &quot; And , in a sometimes thin-skinned society , virtually anything can offend . One person ' s colon joke can easily be another ' s vulgarity . While most comics cherish their right to do or say anything for a laugh , performers must decide how much of themselves they ' re willing to reveal on stage , how hard they ' re willing to push an audience and what they ' re willing to do for the sake of comedy . &quot; To me , stand-up comedy is all about telling a secret that people are thinking but no one ' s saying out loud , &quot; says Bill Maher , host of Comedy Central ' s freewheeling , comic talk_show &quot; Politically Incorrect. &quot; &quot; If you capture that , then anything can be funny . There are a lot of issues you need to tread carefully on , but sometimes the best disinfectant for a messy topic is sunlight , and it ' s comedy ' s job to be that sunlight . Society ' s in_trouble when comics don ' t take_advantage of free speech. &quot; Issues of censorship and freedom_of_speech are currently hot as debates swirl around proposed curbs on violent imagery in video_games , FCC decency clauses , campus speech codes and terms of political correctness . In this climate of battling sensibilities , the nation ' s comics may be offering a working system of self-regulation . In short , audience response makes every comic his or her own best censor . Comedian Charles Fleischer is known for his wildly improvisational routines , and he guides his antics with a simple set of principles . &quot; A comic can only go_by his own perspective . When I ' m working , I don ' t worry about offending anybody else , only about offending myself . What offends me is anything that messes with the innocence of children or animals . that ' s the area I won ' t go_into for a laugh . Beyond that , I think it ' s sometimes good to offend people . It wakes them up. &quot; * Mark Curry targets his tales of tweaked reality toward a broad audience . The star of &quot; Hangin ' With Mr. Cooper &quot; and host of &quot; Showtime at the Apollo &quot; has an easygoing and likable persona on comedy club stages , but he says he ' s occasionally lost an audience ' s good_will when harsher material misfired . He ' s also learned how to climb out of any holes he digs himself into . &quot; If I go too far with an audience , I can come_back . If an audience goes silent on me , I ' ll play it off by becoming one of them -- switching into my comedy patron voice and saying , ' Boy , that Curry ' s no Seinfeld. ' Or maybe I ' ll just tell an audience to deal with it . Personally , I won ' t do anything that demeans black people for a laugh , but other_than that I ' m on stage to talk_about what I want to talk_about . If the audience disagrees_with me , they have the right to sit there , look mean and not laugh. &quot; As a stand-up performer and star of &quot; Grace Under Fire , &quot; Brett Butler believes that risk-taking is precisely what keeps comedy vital . She is disheartened when she sees comics backing_away from material for fear of offending a crowd . &quot; Stand-up comedy is a great American art_form , but the scourge of stand-up is the craving for conformity . Too many comics think that getting_on stage is the end of the risk , and they take_the_road more traveled . Comedy should celebrate uniqueness and inconsistency. &quot; While developing her barbed wit on the comedy club scene , Butler discovered a valuable comedic alternative to self-censorship : Comics may_not have to tone_down their message if they can repackage the messenger . &quot; I was often told by club owners that I was too dark , too political and too profane . I eventually responded by bleaching my hair and smiling a lot more on stage . I told the same jokes , and the crowds suddenly thought they were hilarious . It made me wonder who was zooming who. &quot; &quot; Comedy is taken_care of by a free market , &quot; says Penn Jillette , the speaking half of the twisted comedy-magic team Penn &amp; Teller and the voice of Comedy Central . On that channel , he is currently presenting an open_letter to Atty . Gen . Janet Reno , who has spoken in favor of curtailing violent imagery on television . In the spot , he and Teller helpfully point_out the difference between stage blood and real blood and make a pitch for an artist ' s right to &quot; give people a rage to live. &quot; The duo ' s stage shows have been known to make use of copious quantities of fake blood in the service of violent illusions . There are limits to what they ' ll do on stage , but they are based more on competition than taste . &quot; I ' m personally interested in sex , and I love dirty_jokes , but I don ' t do them on stage because other people do them better . If you talk_about love and sex and dating , you ' re going head-to-head with Shakespeare and Albert Brooks . We stick_with violence. &quot; Jillette feels that his open_letter merely seconds the feelings of one of the country ' s Founding Fathers . &quot; The best line for Janet actually came from Benjamin Franklin , who said , ' Those who sacrifice liberty in the name of safety deserve neither. ' Performers have the right to say what they want to , and anyone paying money has the right to accept or reject the art and entertainment that ' s available . Teller and I do what we do because we have something to say , not because we want to shock . Our audience understands that , and the people who are upset by us don ' t have to be in our audience. &quot; Bill Hicks came_up short in a clash of comedic tastes last year when a bit he did for the Letterman show was deemed too hot for broadcast television . But he sees no reason to soften his satirical jabs . &quot; The only way to do comedy is to speak from the heart and do what makes you laugh . People appreciate emotional honesty , whether they agree with your point_of_view or not . I like to be shocked and surprised , so I ' m out there trying to shock and surprise myself. &quot; * Even some comics known for scrupulously clean material support their colleagues who choose to push the envelope of acceptability . &quot; I ' ve had children and archbishops in my audience and haven ' t had to change a thing , &quot; says veteran comic David Brenner . &quot; that ' s my preference . &quot; But I would n ' t want anyone to walk into a club and say they were shutting the show down because I hadn ' t cursed in 10 years , and I don ' t think it should go the other way either. &quot; It would seem that differences of taste among comics , and audiences , will persist as long as comedy does . Every newly uttered punch_line may delight someone and offend someone else . The offended may want to stifle the laughs , but Bill Maher says that any attempt to quell comic speech may simply result in stronger material for the comics . &quot; A restrictive mood is usually good for comedy , because it gives us something to rebel against . We love that . There ' s no way any censor can really win with a comic . we ' ll always have the last word , and , more importantly , the funnier word. &quot;</TEXT>
