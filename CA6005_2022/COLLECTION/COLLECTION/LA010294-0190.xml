   <HEADLINE> UKRAINE TO OFFER MOSCOW A DEAL ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS ; DISARMAMENT : KIEV IS SET TO SEND WARHEADS TO RUSSIA AS SOON AS IT CAN BE ' PAID ' WITH REACTOR FUEL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Ukrainian government is prepared to start transferring nuclear_warheads to Russia as quickly as Moscow can compensate it with fuel for its atomic_energy reactors , this country ' s chief arms negotiator says . Vice Premier Valery Shmarov outlined Ukraine ' s position in an interview Friday as he prepared_for disarmament talks in Washington this week with Russian and U.S. officials . The three-way talks are focused_on Ukraine ' s conditions for giving_up nearly 1 # 800 warheads inherited from the Soviet_Union , a top priority of the Clinton_Administration . Mindful of Russian claims on parts of its territory , Ukraine has balked at complying with international treaties to surrender the arsenal , saying that it first needs guarantees of security and material compensation . Mistrust between the two former Soviet republics has derailed several agreements . Only last month did the United States become involved in the talks , and that produced an immediate concession when Ukraine announced that it was deactivating 20 of its SS-24 missiles , the most sophisticated weapon in the arsenal . In the interview , however , Shmarov indicated that those missiles , which carry a total of 200 warheads , were_due to be dismantled anyway for periodic maintenance and might be reassembled unless Ukraine gets &quot; an adequate response &quot; from Russia and the United States . He said that at the talks this week Ukraine will press a formula that would help solve Ukraine ' s most pressing problem , a severe energy crisis that has reduced heating in homes and offices . &quot; We will give Russia weapons-grade uranium ( in the warheads ) in return for nuclear_reactor fuel , &quot; he said . Russia and Ukraine agreed on such an exchange in September , without setting a timetable , but the deal quickly fell_apart . On one side , Russia insisted on getting all_the warheads by 1997 and spreading_out fuel deliveries over 20 years . On the other , Ukraine balked at pledging to turn_over all its weapons . To build mutual confidence , Shmarov said he will propose what amounts to a trial swap of a token number of warheads for the equivalent in nuclear fuel . If the swap is agreed to and is completed simultaneously , that would &quot; give us certainty &quot; that Russia will compensate Ukraine for the entire lot of warheads , he said . &quot; I think we will initial , maybe even sign , an agreement on this subject in Washington , &quot; the negotiator said . He cautioned that any agreement must be ratified by Ukraine ' s Parliament , which declared in November that the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks treaty known as START-1 applies to just 36 % of Ukraine ' s warheads . At the same time , he said President Leonid Kravchuk is committed to &quot; full disarmament. &quot; Ukraine would like the United States to disarm some of its nuclear missiles in return . But Shmarov did not pose that as a condition , saying only , &quot; If we take_off 10 weapons , be so kind as_to reduce 10 weapons that are now aimed at us. &quot; The Clinton_Administration has been unenthusiastic about that proposal . Even so , Shmarov gave Washington credit for an apparent breakthrough in the talks since then-special U.S. presidential envoy Strobe Talbott , now deputy secretary_of_state , met here Dec . 16 with him and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov . Ukraine announced four days later it was deactivating the 20 missiles , and a flurry of diplomatic activity followed . Kravchuk flew to Budapest for talks with Vice_President Al Gore and met later with Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin to lay the groundwork for the talks starting Monday in Washington .</TEXT>
