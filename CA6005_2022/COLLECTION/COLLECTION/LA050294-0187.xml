   <HEADLINE> FORMULA ONE STAR SENNA , 34 , KILLED IN ITALIAN CRASH ; AUTO RACING : FORMER THREE-TIME WORLD CHAMPION IS SECOND TO DIE IN TWO DAYS AT GRAND PRIX OF SAN MARINO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ayrton Senna , a three-time world Formula One driving champion whom some racing observers called the best race driver of all-time , died Sunday of head injuries suffered when his car crashed during the Grand Prix of San Marino in Imola , Italy . Senna , 34 , was leading after seven laps when his Williams-Renault streaked off course at full speed -- approximately 185 m.p.h. -- at the Tamburello turn and crashed head on into a concrete wall . Doctors said Senna ' s forehead was crushed and surgery was impossible . He was pronounced dead four hours after the crash . The accident followed by a day a similar crash that killed rookie driver Roland Ratzenberger . Ratzenberger ' s death so moved Senna that the Brazilian driver did not attempt a qualifying lap on Saturday . However , his speed from Friday ' s time trials enabled him to win a Grand Prix record 65th pole position . A deeply religious_person with a single-minded dedication to race- car driving , Senna had expressed apprehension about the 1994 season in a Brazilian newspaper last month . &quot; It ' s going_to be a season with lots of accidents and I ' ll risk saying we ' ll be lucky if something really serious doesn ' t happen , &quot; he wrote . &quot; To survive in Grand Prix racing you need to be afraid . Fear is a very important feeling to have. &quot; In Sunday ' s edition of the German newspaper , Welt am Sonntag , Senna wrote_of the San Marino race , &quot; My car reacts a bit nervously on this kind of surface . This stems from its special aerodynamics but it ' s also got_to do with a difficulty in the suspension. &quot; Late Sunday , race officials said they still did not know what caused Senna ' s car to leave the circuit . Michael Schumacher of Germany , who won Sunday ' s race , was close behind Senna when the accident occurred . &quot; He looked nervous from the very first lap , &quot; Schumacher said . &quot; He took two or three bumps , but I can ' t say what happened exactly. &quot; Senna ' s death sent shock_waves through the racing community . Michael Andretti , who was Senna ' s Formula One teammate last year , said by telephone from his home_in Nazareth , Pa. : &quot; It was a horrible shock , I can ' t believe it happened . Ayrton was a good friend , a truly great person and a great race driver . He was totally different from the image you get from European writers . He was very helpful to me all year , off and on the track . I feel_like I would if I lost a member of my family. &quot; When Michael Andretti won the season-opening Indy-car race in Australia last March , one of the first congratulatory messages he received was from Senna . Nigel Mansell , one of Senna ' s most bitter rivals in Formula One before he left last year to join the Indy car circuit , said in a statement issued by the Newman-Haas team : &quot; I am in a total state of shock , as I am sure everyone in motor racing is at this horrific loss of life . I was stunned when the Austrian driver ( Ratzenberger ) was killed on Saturday , and for Ayrton to lose his life the very next day makes this a very black weekend in motor racing history . &quot; Ayrton and I shared some of the most exciting races ever staged , and it is impossible to put into words what a sad loss to motor racing this is , because when a truly great driver and a great champion loses his life , there is a very big void left behind. &quot; Senna won 41 races in 161 Formula One starts , second only to Alain Prost , and drove a McLaren to the championships in 1988 , 1990 and 1991 . In 1988 , he won eight of 16 races , a record for one season until Mansell won nine two years ago . When Senna won in 1991 , he was the youngest driver to win three world titles . After the 1993 season , in which he finished runner-up to Prost , Senna left McLaren to drive for the Williams team . He followed two other Brazilian world champions , Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson Piquet , into Formula One . For a time last January , it was rumored that Senna might also follow them into Indy car racing . He tested a Penske car at Firebird Raceway in Arizona , but said it was only at the invitation of his close friend , Fittipaldi . His death is a devastating blow to Formula One , which has now lost its three most recent champions in two years . Mansell left after winning the 1992 championship and Prost announced his retirement after winning in 1993 . Senna ' s reputation was enhanced by his remarkable ability to win in wet conditions . Senna won 12 of the 20 races affected by rain during his Grand Prix career . Three of his five wins last year were in the rain . Born Ayrton Senna de Silva on March 21 , 1960 , he was a national hero in Brazil , where he lived near his parents in Sao Paulo . &quot; All Brazilians will feel this death , &quot; said a TV commentator in Brazil . &quot; After Pele , Senna is the country ' s biggest hero. &quot; FORMULA ONE DRIVER DEATHS DRIVERS KILLED IN SANCTIONED FORMULA ONE GRAND PRIX EVENTS : 04 # 16 , 25 # 15 , 18 Date Driver Country Event July 31 , 1954 Onofre Marimon Argentina German GP * July 6 , 1958 Luigi Musso Italy French GP Aug . 3 , 1958 Peter Collins Britain German GP Oct . 19 , 1958 Stuart Lewis-Evans Britain Moroccan GP June 19 , 1960 Chris Bristow Britain Belgian GP June 19 , 1960 Alan Stacey Britain Belgian GP Sept . 10 , 1961 Wolfgang Von Trips West Germany Italian GP Aug . 2 , 1964 Carel Godin de Beaufort Netherlands German GP * Aug . 7 , 1966 John Taylor Britain German GP May 10 , 1967 Lorenzo Bandini Italy Monaco GP July 7 , 1968 Jo Schlesser Austria French GP Aug . 2 , 1969 Gerhard Mitter West Germany German GP * June 7 , 1970 Piers Courage Britain Dutch GP Sept . 5 , 1970 Jochen Ridnt Austria Italian GP * July 29 , 1973 Roger Williamson Britain Dutch GP Oct . 7 , 1973 Francois Cevert France U.S. GP * Oct . 6 , 1974 Helmuth Koinigg Austria U.S. GP Aug . 19 , 1975 Mark Donahue United States Austrian GP * May 5 , 1977 Tom Pryce Britain South_African GP Sept . 10 , 1978 Ronnie Peterson Sweden Italian GP May , 8 , 1982 Gilles Villeneuve Canada Belgian GP * June 13 , 1982 Ricardo Paletti Italy Canadian GP April 30 , 1994 Roland Ratzenberger Austria San Marino GP * May 1 , 1994 Ayrton Senna Brazil San Marino GP * qualifying .
