   <TEXT> Despite our brief but bright hopes , history did not end with the fall of the Soviet bloc , as we are sharply reminded by Harvard historian Richard Pipes_in &quot; Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime. &quot; Indeed , Pipes shows us that history has reasserted itself with a vengeance . The bloodthirsty nationalism and raw ethnic violence now ravaging Eastern Europe and the former Soviet_Union were only concealed behind the vast Potemkin Village of the Bolshevik regime and the Soviet empire that it created . The Bolsheviks , like the czar before them , ruled over a &quot; prison_house of nations &quot; whose inmates spoke 85 languages and dialects . Under the guise of a Marxist revolution , Pipes explains , the Bolsheviks managed only to suppress -- but not eradicate -- the religious , ethnic and national identities of various subject peoples , including Poles and Germans , Ukrainians and Georgians , Turkestanis and Kazakhistanis . &quot; Lenin , who had no difficulty in changing tactics when necessary , decided now to abandon . . . the principle of national self-determination in favor of federalism , &quot; Pipes writes . &quot; In reality , the Soviets were only a facade to conceal the true sovereign , the Communist_Party . The result would be formal federalism , with all_the trimmings of statehood , presumably able to satisfy the aspirations of the non-Russian peoples , concealing a rigidly centralized dictatorship centered in Moscow. &quot; &quot; Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime , &quot; the third in a series of related books by Pipes , is a disciplined work of scholarship that focuses_on a rather narrow slice of Russian history , starting with the consolidation of power after the 1917 revolution and ending with the death of Lenin in 1924 . Pipes describes in detail the campaigns of the civil_war , the holy war against religious and intellectual freedom , the cynical experiments in a free market under the so-called New Economic Policy , and the furious efforts at inventing the first totalitarian regime of the 20th Century -- an invention , Pipes argues , that served as a model for Mussolini , Hitler and the enduring remnants of fascism . &quot; The effect of the Communists ' activities at_home and abroad was not to unleash a global revolution , but , paradoxically , to give_rise to movements that assimilated their spirit and copied their methods , &quot; Pipes writes . &quot; No prominent Europeans socialist before World_War I resembled Lenin more closely than Benito Mussolini. &quot; Pipes refuses to paint Lenin and Trotsky in warmer tones than Stalin . Indeed , he credits the Old Bolsheviks with creating the apparatus of terror that Stalin used with such devastating effect in the ' 30s and ' 40s -- and he points_out that Soviet flirtation with the German military machine in the ' 20s allowed the future leaders of the Wehrmacht to perfect their weapons and tactics . &quot; The tactics which formed the basis of Hitler ' s Blitzkrieg , &quot; he writes , &quot; were first tested on Soviet soil. &quot; The work is enriched in intriguing ways by the author ' s access to the once-secret archives of the Soviet_Union . We learn that Lenin used to prescribe drugs for himself from the Kremlin pharmacy , and Pipes shows us that Stalin managed to consolidate his growing power even during Lenin ' s lifetime precisely because the ailing dictator was entrusted to Stalin ' s cynical care . Still , Pipes downplays the importance of the newly opened archives in the study of contemporary Russian history , and he insists that &quot; in not a single instance did_it compel me to revise views , which I had formed on the basis of printed sources and archives located in the West. &quot; And he is not shy about pronouncing judgment on the vast enterprise of the Bolsheviks . &quot; Judged in terms of its own aspirations , the Communist regime was a monumental failure : It succeeded in one thing only -- staying in power , &quot; Pipes concludes . &quot; At every stage of its history , the Communist regime in Russia did whatever it had to do to beat off challengers , without regard_to Marxist doctrine even as it cloaked its actions with Marxist slogans . Lenin succeeded precisely because he was free_of . . . Marxist scruples. &quot; The judgment of history , of course , is that the Bolsheviks failed even at staying in power . We are shown that Russia and the other subject peoples of the former Soviet_Union paid a terrible price for the temporary success of the Bolsheviks , and a still more terrible price for their failures . That is the real subtext -- and the timely message -- of &quot; Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime. &quot;</TEXT>
