   <HEADLINE> U.S. ACCUSED OF STEALING BODY_PARTS ; URANIUM : WIDOW CONTENDS ENERGY_DEPARTMENT WORKERS TOOK THE EVIDENCE THAT HER HUSBAND DIED OF URANIUM POISONING -- BONES , LIVER , KIDNEY AND SPLEEN TISSUE . GOVERNMENT DENIES WRONGDOING BUT ADMITS TAKING THE ITEMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They came the day after Larry Hicks ' heart stopped , and when they left they took bones and liver , kidney and spleen tissue . It was , says his widow , a &quot; clandestine and ghoulish operation. &quot; Hicks had worked_at the Fernald uranium-processing plant for a dozen years ; these &quot; ghouls &quot; were agents of the federal_government . Diane Hicks is furious at the treatment her husband ' s body received . &quot; We ' re talking_about a human_being . We ' re talking_about the father of my children , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s just horrible . The public should know what they ' re capable of doing. &quot; The U.S. Department_of_Energy says hundreds of current employees at nuclear-technology sites nationwide willingly agreed to donate their organs and tissue through a volunteer program . The tissue samples and records stored at the U.S. Transuranium and Uranium Registries in Richland , Wash. , are used to update radiation exposure standards and determine whether former employees or contract workers died as a result of radiation exposure , Energy_Department spokesman Ken Morgan said . But Diane Hicks and others say that the Energy_Department arranged with coroners to quickly take_away internal body organs of dead workers in_order to destroy evidence and protect against lawsuits alleging the victims were killed by workplace exposure to radioactive substances . Louise Roselle , a lawyer for Hicks ' widow , says there is no indication that Hicks or his family signed any consent form authorizing donation of the organs or of any body tissues . Hicks , 33 , worked_at the Fernald plant near Cincinnati as an inspector . On May 8 , 1985 , an equipment_failure dumped enriched uranium on him , Diane Hicks said . Twelve days later , she said , her husband awoke feeling weak and ill . He sought treatment , but died of heart_failure that day . The doctor who treated him told the coroner that the death was consistent with heavy metal poisoning . Diane Hicks said the tissues were taken from her husband ' s body without her knowledge or consent . &quot; They took whole organs , everything but the heart , &quot; she said . &quot; Since they didn ' t talk to me and I didn ' t know they were doing this , for whose benefit were they doing the test ? &quot; She sued , but in 1986 a federal judge ruled that under Ohio law , the Hamilton County coroner had properly taken_control of Larry Hicks ' body and had legally ordered an autopsy . U.S. District Judge S . Arthur Spiegel also ruled then that National Lead of Ohio Inc. , the Energy_Department ' s contract operator at Fernald , and the Hanford Environmental Health Foundation , also a DOE contractor , were protected by the same state law in offering assistance to the coroner . Until 1992 , the Hanford foundation operated the transuranium registry for the Energy_Department . The registry , in_operation since 1968 and home to tissues or records of nearly 700 current or former DOE contractor employees , has been operated since then by Washington State University . Since her husband ' s death , Diane Hicks has worked to support her two children , ages 15 and 13 . She has fought unsuccessfully in court against National Lead , funded by the Energy_Department , to collect workers ' compensation payments for her husband ' s death . National Lead argued that Hicks ' death was not employment-related . Diane Hicks ' lawyers argued that the government had taken_away key evidence by removing internal parts from Larry Hicks . Diane Hicks lost her workers ' compensation bid , but has appealed_to a state appeals court . &quot; They ' ve fought me tooth and nail , every step of the way , &quot; she said . Other critics have decried the Energy_Department ' s &quot; body snatchers. &quot; &quot; It was a conspiracy between the government and its contractors to , in the most unethical and evil way , steal workers ' organs without their knowledge or consent , to successfully destroy the evidence so that the workers and their families would be unable to file workers ' compensation claims against the Department_of_Energy or its contractors , &quot; said Dr. David Egilman , a former Cincinnati occupational physician and epidemiologist . Tom Carpenter , a Seattle lawyer with the Government Accountability Project , a group that represents government whistle-blowers and investigates their allegations , also questioned the DOE program . Carpenter said that not all participants volunteered to donate organs to the Energy_Department . &quot; They weren ' t doing_it for purposes of legitimate scientific_research , &quot; Carpenter said . &quot; They were lying to their workers. &quot; But Morgan , the Energy_Department spokesman , insisted the purpose was scientific_research . &quot; All the autopsies were done_by local coroners , &quot; Morgan said . &quot; Sometimes tissue was collected and then it was sent to DOE contract labs . . . . All of that data was sent to the Transuranium Registry . &quot; The DOE didn ' t do anything here other_than ask_for some tissue samples and the data , &quot; Morgan said .</TEXT>
