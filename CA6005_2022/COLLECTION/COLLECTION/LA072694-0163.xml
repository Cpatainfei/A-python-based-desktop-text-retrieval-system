   <TEXT> Israel and Jordan drew 46 years of suspicion and hostility to a close Monday as Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein , in a declaration signed_on the White_House lawn , pledged to &quot; bring an end to bloodshed and sorrow. &quot; In a ceremony that President Clinton said marks &quot; a new chapter in the march of hope over despair , &quot; the Israeli and Jordanian leaders promised to resolve disputes peacefully and vowed not to &quot; threaten the other by use of force , weapons or any other means. &quot; &quot; Out of all_the days of my life , I do not believe there is one such_as this , &quot; said Hussein , a once-dashing young monarch who has grown bald and gray in four decades on the Hashemite throne -- all_of them under the shadow of the Arab-Israeli conflict . He said the ceremony would bring both nations &quot; security from fear , which I must admit has prevailed over all_the years of our lives. &quot; Rabin , Israel ' s army chief_of_staff in the last shooting war between Israel and Jordan in 1967 , said the agreement shows the neighboring countries can &quot; accelerate our efforts towards peace , overcome obstacles ( and ) achieve a breakthrough. &quot; Despite the soaring rhetoric , their declaration merely ended the technical state of belligerency between the two countries , falling_short_of an official peace_treaty because key details -- which neither side has disclosed -- remain unresolved . Rabin and Hussein promised intensive negotiations aimed at completing the second formal treaty between Israel and an Arab state following the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace agreement . &quot; We have gone here a long way toward a full treaty of peace and , even though our work has not yet ended , it is my hope and belief that not long from today we shall return to signing a final and a permanent treaty of peace , &quot; Rabin said . For Hussein , Monday ' s ceremony marked a dramatic break_with Jordan ' s traditional determination to keep its foreign_policy firmly within an Arab consensus . For years , Hussein made_it clear he was interested only in a comprehensive peace agreement that would cover all Arab countries , especially Syria . To be sure , Hussein has not yet signed a peace_treaty . But his declaration Monday puts Jordan far ahead of Syria and threatens to isolate Syrian President Hafez Assad . In the past , Syria has responded angrily to any suggestion of a separate peace between Israel and any Arab state . Relations between Damascus and Cairo were frosty for years after Egypt made_peace with Israel . Clinton sought to smooth Assad ' s reaction to the Israel-Jordan declaration . In a telephone_call just before the signing ceremony , Clinton assured him the United States considers Syria a major factor_in the Middle_East and that Washington will continue to try to mediate a peace between Syria and Israel . U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , who plans to resume his Jerusalem-Damascus shuttle diplomacy before the middle of next month , said he hopes Syria will be swept_up in the momentum created by Hussein and Rabin . &quot; Each one of these historic breakthroughs that happens makes_it slightly easier for the next one to happen , &quot; Christopher said . The ceremony -- conducted at the same table used for the Israel-Egypt agreement and for the pact Israel signed last year with the Palestine Liberation Organization -- marked a welcome foreign_policy success for the Clinton_Administration , which has been buffeted by crises in Bosnia-Herzegovina , Haiti and Somalia . The United States served as go-between to set_up Monday ' s meeting . In his speech , Clinton paid tribute to predecessors Jimmy_Carter and George_Bush for earlier Arab-Israeli peacemaking that helped make the current talks possible . Clinton made the most of the latest Middle_East accord , presiding over the ceremony and signing the document himself to demonstrate his government ' s support . &quot; History is made when brave leaders find the power to escape the past and create a new future , &quot; he said . It was the first publicly acknowledged meeting between Hussein and an Israeli prime_minister . But , unlike other Arab leaders , Hussein met regularly in private with a succession of Israeli prime_ministers and foreign_ministers in what became the Middle_East ' s most widely known secret . When the Rabin-Hussein meeting was announced 10 days ago , it appeared that the most significant outcome would be to take the relationship into the sunlight . But Israel-Jordan talks in the last week produced an impressive list of substantive agreements . Besides better relations with Israel , Jordan is looking_for economic assistance from the United States , especially some relief from its $ 700-million debt . Although he made no promises , Christopher said the U.S._government &quot; is committed to supporting those that take risks for peace. &quot; Jordan and Israel , carved out of the old British mandate of Palestine , have been blocked by almost half a century of hostility from developing cooperative economic projects that their similar geography seems to demand . Hussein and Rabin pledged to heal that breach , outlining a series of steps : * Direct telephone links will be opened . * The countries will link their electricity grids . * Two new border crossings will be opened , one between the twin southern cities of Aqaba , Jordan , and Eilat , Israel , and one in the north . * Third-country tourists will be given &quot; free access &quot; in traveling between the countries . * Israeli and Jordanian police will cooperate against crime , especially smuggling . * Negotiations will be accelerated toward opening international airline routes across both countries . Israel and Jordan also promised to prevent their territory from being used as a base for acts of terrorism against the other . And Jordan promised to urge the Arab League to end its boycott of Israel , although the kingdom did not unilaterally end its own participation in this practice . In one provision that is potentially divisive for the Arab world , Israel agreed to respect Jordan ' s role &quot; in the Muslim holy shrines &quot; of Jerusalem . Rabin also promised that Israel &quot; will give high priority to the Jordanian historic role in these shrines &quot; when negotiations over the final status of Jerusalem begin between Israel and the Palestinians . By favoring Jordan ' s claim to supervise Al Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock on Jerusalem ' s Temple Mount -- one of the holiest_places in Islam -- Israel delivered a rebuff to the PLO and its chairman , Yasser Arafat . Arafat told Christopher last week the Palestinians were proper guardians of Muslim and Christian shrines in Jerusalem . Even as progress toward peace was being recorded in Washington , Iranian-backed guerrillas ambushed an Israeli army convoy in south Lebanon on Monday , killing an Israeli officer and wounding 10 soldiers , security sources said . * MADRID II ? U.S. envisions summit , but difficult work lies ahead . A6 Nations Break the Legacy of War Monday ' s White_House ceremony marked another historic settlement of ancient enmities that have plagued the Middle_East . THE PLEDGES PEACE : The leaders declare , &quot; with the world as their witness , &quot; that Israel and Jordan have ended their long state of belligerency . Negotiations will continue toward a full-fledged peace pact . ECONOMIC COOPERATION : The two nations will attempt to abolish all economic boycotts and to establish bilateral economic cooperation . TELEPHONE LINKS : Direct service between the two countries will be established . WATER-POWER : Negotiations will seek the proper allocation of the waters of the Jordan and Yarmuk rivers . The two countries ' power_grids will be linked . BORDER : Two new border crossing posts will be established and a survey will be made of the common border . TOURISTS : Visitors from other nations will be allowed to travel easily between the two countries . AIR TRAFFIC : Negotiations on an international air corridor between the two countries will be speeded_up . UNRESOLVED Israel , Syria and Lebanon have made little progress toward peace since Middle_East peace talks began nearly three years ago . U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher called the talks between Israel and Syria over the future of the Golan Heights &quot; a very intertwined set of negotiations , probably the toughest negotiations of all. &quot;</TEXT>
