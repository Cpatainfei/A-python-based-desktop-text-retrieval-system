   <HEADLINE> LIGHTS OUT AT THE BEST PARTY IN TOWN ; SWIFTY LAZAR ' S PALS RECALL THE MAN AND THE EVENT THAT BECAME AN OSCAR TRADITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was the party of the year on the night of the year , and if you could sell your mother for a chance to get_in , you just might have done_it . Literary agent Irving ( Swifty ) Lazar ' s Oscar night bash was the triple-A-list party , an E-ticket ride to the biggest celeb-fest ever . Although the Governor ' s Ball is the official post-Academy Awards soiree , it wasn ' t unusual for a presenter , nominee or winner to ditch it altogether and limo to Lazar ' s . To be invited meant that you were a friend , or that you ' d finally arrived . If you weren ' t asked , you had the options of leaving town or suffering the indignity of begging for an invitation . Or , you could do as one crasher did and try to wedge your fanny through a second-story window . The deaths of the legendary powerhouse last December and of his wife , Mary , 11 months earlier , put an end to a tradition that spanned three decades , beginning as an intimate dinner for friends at the Bistro in Beverly Hills and evolving into a media frenzy at Spago . Those close to Lazar -- the ones who called him Irving , as he preferred -- can ' t quite believe that their friend is gone , that tonight Spago will be dark , that there will be no glamorous celebration capped with pizza and champagne . Michael Caine and wife Shakira are deliberately out of town : &quot; We don ' t feel_like celebrating anything , &quot; Caine said from England . Angie Dickinson will be watching the show at a friend ' s house . Some , including Barbara and Marvin Davis , will attend other parties . But no one will forget the diminutive , bald man in oversized black-rimmed glasses who would admonish guests to sit_down , eat dinner and watch the show on the various monitors around the room . Lazar didn ' t suffer table hoppers gladly . If you were seated for dinner , you sat . And no one will forget Mary , described by one friend as looking_like a cameo , as much responsible_for the success of the party as her husband . The evening unfolded in stages , the first before sundown when guests would assemble for dinner . A second wave of guests came later from the awards show Downtown . Here the party found its second wind , re-energized by fresh blood and new faces , some gripping heavy gold statuettes and stargazing themselves . So many movie_stars , directors , producers , studio chiefs , writers and media types were crammed into one place that even the most jaded Hollywood-ites were impressed with the view . Barbara Lazaroff , restaurant designer and wife of Spago ' s Wolfgang Puck , recalls this scenario : &quot; We ' d do all_the prep work ; Wolf would be cooking all day . Then Mary would show_up with the boards for the seating . Then Irving would come_in , look_at the boards that she ' d been preparing_for weeks and move people around . Then he ' d leave and she ' d move them all back . Then she ' d leave . It was the same scene every year , but we loved it . &quot; Something funny would always happen at the party , &quot; she says . &quot; The year Madonna and Michael Jackson came_together , they almost seemed like an old married_couple . . . . And you could always measure popularity by how loudly people standing outside screamed . When Oprah Winfrey came walking down , you ' d think the Messiah had arrived. &quot; Actress Jacqueline Bissett calls Lazar ' s annual fete &quot; an evening of excitement and a bit of fear. &quot; She recalls &quot; one ironic situation. &quot; &quot; I was at a table with a lot of bigwigs , and I remember Meryl Streep was up for ' Ironweed , ' but a lot of people at my table hadn ' t seen it . I thought in this performance she was just brilliant . And suddenly I got the sense of the split between the work and the social tornado -- that people in this town who are in the social tornado don ' t know the work . It was very odd . . . . There was a definite imbalance. &quot; * It was Lazar ' s ability to draw_in all kinds of fascinating people that Dickinson admires . &quot; One year I remember I was seated across from Paloma Picasso , and that was thrilling . Another year I was seated near ( Rolling Stone Publisher ) Jann Wenner . It was also the kind of party where if you hadn ' t met someone , you could . I had never met Kathleen Turner , and I felt very comfortable going_to up_to her and introducing myself. &quot; When Lazar moved his base of operations to Spago in 1985 , the hype grew exponentially . The party extended beyond Spago ' s front_door and could be diagrammed in concentric circles : On the outermost arc were fans behind barricades near the restaurant . A gaggle of paparazzi staked out the sidewalk . Security types scattered around the restaurant watched crashers and ushered_in the biggest stars through the back_entrance . A few select reporters , photographers and camera crews were stationed on the front_porch to catch sound_bites . A handful of lucky media types were allowed inside , some told not to roam beyond the bar during dinner . Seating was tricky -- few relished being stuck_in the back_room , although mega-celebs sometimes were stuck there anyway . The front_room was considered ground zero , the primo spot for watching and being watched . Those who messed with Lazar-approved arrangements were playing with a sizable ball_of_fire . &quot; If you asked to be seated with somebody , he made_sure not only that you weren ' t , but that you ended_up in Siberia , &quot; says producer and director Lili Fini Zanuck , who attended her first Lazar Oscar night party 15 years ago and recalls the parties , and Lazar , with great fondness . &quot; He was enjoying his Holy_Roman_Emperor status with that , and those people were punished. &quot; She recalls the year she and husband Richard won the best picture Oscar for &quot; Driving Miss Daisy. &quot; &quot; We had great seats in the front_room , &quot; she says . &quot; And the next year we were moved_back to the back room. &quot; * Over the years , Lazar ' s famous party had its share of glitches and incidents . Lazaroff says that despite times when ex-husbands would collide_with ex-wives and their respective new partners , no major battles ensued . There was one year when an accidental flip of a switch changed the Oscar broadcast to a home shopping channel , but it was changed back before anyone had time to purchase a cubic zirconium . One year guests watched with amusement as Jack Nicholson walked in , stayed for a_few minutes and left with a centerpiece . Michael Caine recalls the year he was nominated for best actor for &quot; Educating Rita &quot; but lost to Robert Duvall in &quot; Tender Mercies. &quot; &quot; When I walked in , I got the same cheers as if I had won , &quot; he says . &quot; They all said , ' It ' s the same to us , Michael. ' I didn ' t win , but to get an ovation like that from people like Cary Grant was an incredible thing. &quot; &quot; Swifty was amazing , &quot; says actor Roger Moore , one in the stable of regulars . &quot; The old saying says it best -- it was the best of times and the best of friends . And you know , egos being what they are , everybody wants to sit where they think is the important place , but the Lazars were able to make everybody feel_like they were important . we ' ll all be thinking_of them on Oscar night. &quot; Philanthropist Barbara Davis remembers the night as &quot; everything you wished New Year ' s Eve would be when you were a child . It was like Bastille Day and the Fourth_of_July . I ' d think_about going_to that party for months . &quot; During the dinner he was very firm -- he didn ' t want people moving_around . He would n ' t use the early part of the evening as a social time . He respected the industry and the industry respected him. &quot; Marlee Matlin was all_of 21 and a babe in Hollywood when she went_to Spago after winning her Academy Award as best actress for &quot; Children of a Lesser God. &quot; &quot; I arrived in shock , &quot; she recalls . &quot; I walked in and saw all these stars and I thought I was in the Twilight Zone . I saw Liz Taylor and I went chasing_after her because I had to meet her . Also , sitting near us was another personality who was so drunk he fell_off his chair . We didn ' t know what to do. &quot; Another Oscar night regular and Lazar pal was Don Rickles , who says : &quot; If you were a friend , he really showed it at the party . He was a gracious host . Even though there were great big major stars there , your position in life wasn ' t what always mattered. &quot; Despite their friendship , Rickles adds , &quot; I was more in_awe_of him . He was like a general . He was the star . Every major person made_it a point to say hello. &quot; But being a major person didn ' t mean Swifty always let you have your way . One year , Lazar ' s associate , Alan Nevins , was pulling guest-list duty at the door where he was seen arguing with an officious-looking young_woman from Gov . Pete Wilson ' s office over his refusal to allow the governor ' s bodyguards inside . &quot; Bu-bu-but he ' s the governor , &quot; the woman kept repeating . &quot; I know who he is , &quot; Nevins replied . &quot; Will you personally guarantee his safety ? &quot; &quot; I don ' t care about his safety. &quot; Later , the governor was spotted at the party , with no bodyguards in_sight . Madonna , however , had a huge one by her side . Free-lance writer Kevin Allman contributed to this story .</TEXT>
