   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration ' s call_for a global telecommunications revolution is meeting resistance from many nations intent_on protecting their citizens from everything from MTV ' s Beavis and Butt-head to the invasion of such American corporate giants as AT &amp; T . From Malaysia to France , telecommunications and trade officials -- concerned about outside political , cultural and economic interference -- have been slow to reduce regulatory barriers despite intense efforts by U.S. Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown , Vice_President Al Gore and President Clinton himself to open foreign shores to the burgeoning telecommunications marketplace . The very success of the American entertainment and telecommunications industry within U.S. borders &quot; has incited a counterattack by foreign governments . . . whose aim it is to shrink the reach of American visual entertainment and to baffle the movement of our products in world marketplaces , &quot; asserted the Motion_Picture Export Assn . of America Inc. in a recent study . Resistance takes several forms and makes uncertain the vision of an electronic global village . Australia and France , among other countries , limit the amount of foreign-produced TV and / or radio music programs that may be broadcast within their borders . Meanwhile , access to many components of the existing global information highway are often priced out_of_reach for ordinary citizens by regulatory red_tape or is prohibited by direct government regulation . Malaysia and China , for instance , are among several nations that ban or restrict the use of home satellite dishes to capture data and broadcast programs from other nations . And foreign phone carriers , many of which are government-owned monopolies , often keep rates for international calls originating_in their countries far higher than U.S. carriers charge for the same calls originating here . * As a result , there are about twice as_many calls placed from the United States to overseas points as vice versa . Because of the complex formula for apportioning the revenue from international calls , that imbalance has spawned a $ 4-billion trade_gap -- a dollar drain exceeded only by the yearly trade_deficits in the automobile , petroleum , electronics and apparel_industries , according to the Federal Communications Commission . &quot; There ' s been a lot of rhetoric &quot; about encouraging global telecommunications competition , grumbled Vic Pelson , executive_vice_president and chairman of global operations for AT &amp; T . &quot; A lot of folks would have you believe there are open markets &quot; around the world , &quot; but the facts don ' t support that. &quot; The overseas resistance involves not only age-old concerns about trade_policy and industrial development but also worries about U.S. cultural hegemony . In a world where U.S. products like Coca-Cola , Nike shoes and Levi ' s jeans already seem ubiquitous , many countries are loath to surrender their culture further to American dominance of high_technology . &quot; Those kinds of concerns are almost endemic to state bureaucracies , &quot; said Michael Gardner , a Washington lawyer who served as an ambassador to the International Telecommunications Union and runs a program to train telecommunications managers from developing countries . &quot; The new breed is intrigued by new technology but the old_guard is worried about cultural imperialism ; they are reluctant to invite change , &quot; Gardner said . Nevertheless , over the last decade , the U.S. high-tech telecommunications and entertainment_industries have invaded places as remote as Borneo and as tightly controlled as Cuba -- leaving their indelible imprint on indigenous musical tastes , fashion , lifestyles and even political and social causes . &quot; Spend a week in darkest Borneo and what you find these days are &quot; not primitive scenes but &quot; . . . the latest episode of ' L.A. Law , ' &quot; journalist James P . Sterba wrote after a trip in which he spotted natives with cellular_phones , VCRs and other high-tech gear . The computer operating software produced by giant Microsoft Corp . of Seattle , for instance , has been installed in more_than 70 % of the world ' s personal_computers , analysts estimate . Cable News Network and MTV are available by cable or satellite in many countries around the world . To be sure , some nations such_as Romania , Mexico and Britain , among others , say they are moving rapidly to encourage more investment by foreign telecommunications companies . And the Clinton_Administration ' s jawboning about the global information superhighway has helped some U.S. telecommunications companies recently score some impressive deals . In one such pact , reported to be worth $ 4 billion , Saudi_Arabia in May selected AT &amp; T to modernize its entire telephone network . &quot; We have absolutely the greatest interest in opening our markets to the highest_technology , &quot; said Emila Dumitru , head of international cooperation in Romania ' s Ministry of Communications . &quot; We have about 100 companies licensed to provide &quot; cable TV service . Dumitru said cable in Romania offers such networks as CNN and MTV ; two Romanian companies recently entered a joint_venture with Telefonica of Spain to provide cellular_phone service . What ' s more , overseas bureaucrats are not alone in their resistance to reducing regulatory barriers . U.S. regulators have also been criticized for not going_far enough in cutting red_tape . It was only months ago that the U.S._government took the first limited steps to open the door for export of fiber-optic and other advanced telecommunications technologies to former Cold_War enemies such_as China and the former Soviet_Union . And federal law limits foreign ownership interest in U.S. radio , TV and common_carrier licensees to a maximum of 20 % . But U.S. officials including President Clinton , who this month called_for a telecommunications summit among the world ' s most industrialized nations to discuss opening markets , have now made development of a global information age a major initiative . Clinton ' s proposal , if accepted by the Group of Seven nations , builds_upon overseas trips undertaken by Commerce_Secretary Brown and the vice_president to sell other countries on the Administration ' s recipe for creating a global information superhighway . * The three men say telecommunications development would promote political stability and help U.S. companies cash_in_on the more_than $ 250 billion worth of telecommunications modernization that the Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates will be undertaken in the next decade in China , the former Soviet_Union and developing nations . While many U.S. executives support the Administration ' s efforts , some point_out that the effort to modernize the global information superhighway is not without risks . Linking more people to electronic networks that provide instantaneous information and entertainment from libraries , studios and data banks around the world may seem inviting but such linkups &quot; can make the ( information ) market more subject_to governmental regulation , &quot; said Neil Turkewitz , senior_vice_president , international , at the Recording Industry Assn . of America . &quot; Once things have to get distributed over government or quasi-government-controlled communications networks , the dangers are greatly enhanced that programs can be controlled &quot; or manipulated to suit a government ' s purpose , Turkewitz said . &quot; To the extent the information highway reduces regulation by moving program choices from ( industry or government ) decision-makers to consumers -- that ' s good , &quot; he added . &quot; But we don ' t know how the information highway will develop. &quot; AT &amp; T ' s Pelson said he is amazed at how rapidly technology and markets are changing in the face of the information highway -- despite regulatory strictures . &quot; This industry is booming around the world , &quot; he said . Based on his talks with government officials and industry executives around the world , Pelson added : &quot; The notion of an information superhighway is certainly sinking_in with the people I talk to. &quot;</TEXT>
