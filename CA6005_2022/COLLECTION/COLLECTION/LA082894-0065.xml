   <HEADLINE> FBI TESTING NAPOLEON ' S HAIR FOR POISON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A forelock snipped by a maid from Napoleon Bonaparte ' s head hours after his death is at the center of a debate over whether the former French conqueror was murdered , and if so , by whom . A few hairs from the locket , to go_on sale in Chicago next month , are being studied for signs of poison by the FBI laboratory in Washington . The lab is also trying to determine the DNA makeup in the follicles , said Robert Bresson , a spokesman for the Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation . The results will be among evidence presented at a meeting of the Napoleonic Society of America in September , said group member Bob Snibbe . Napoleon ' s official cause of death in 1821 was originally listed by English doctors as stomach cancer . But people who attended the former emperor on the remote island of St . Helena , in the south Atlantic_Ocean , where he was exiled after losing the battle_of_Waterloo , have come under suspicion over the years , Snibbe said . French royalist Count de Montholon is among the possible culprits and , Snibbe said , had several possible motives . A 1982 book , &quot; The Murder of Napoleon , &quot; charged that Napoleon was poisoned , a result based on hair tests at the Harwell Atomic Energy Research Laboratory in England . The lab found abnormally high traces of arsenic . Snibbe said French scholars found the book ' s allegations absurd . It postulated that French royalists , afraid that Napoleon ' s possible return would strip them of their power and wealth , had Count Montholon poison him . But the author of a soon-to-be-published book on the question , Rene Maury , argues that Montholon ' s motives were personal : Napoleon had cuckolded him , and the count was impatient to obtain a promised inheritance of 2 million francs . Maury will join the debate at the meeting , Snibbe said . Meanwhile , Snibbe said the 1 # 800-member group is considering whether to ask that the body of Napoleon ' s nephew , Achille Murat , be exhumed from his grave in Tallahassee , Fla. , where he fled after his Italian father was beheaded and his body tossed_in the Mediterranean . Achille ' s body would be exhumed to determine its genetic makeup and try to match it to that of the locket . The FBI ' s Bresson said the agency partly agreed to test the hair because scientists are not sure if DNA can be recovered from hair &quot; that had been sitting around for 200 years. &quot; An elderly Frenchman , Jean Fichou of Rennes , brought the locket to the FBI in Washington , Bresson said . The locket , along with other Napoleonic items , will be_on sale in Chicago during the society ' s meeting .</TEXT>
