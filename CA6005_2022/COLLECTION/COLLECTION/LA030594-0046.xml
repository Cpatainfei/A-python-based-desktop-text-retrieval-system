   <HEADLINE> FEBRUARY JOB STATISTICS SHOW GAINS FOR CALIFORNIA AND U.S. AS A WHOLE ; ECONOMY : THE STATE HAD 9 # 500 MORE PEOPLE WORKING LAST MONTH , AND ITS UNEMPLOYMENT_RATE FELL TO 9 % FROM 10.1 % .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a sign that California may be pulling_out of its long and punishing recession , the federal_government reported Friday that the state gained 9 # 500 jobs last month and its unemployment_rate fell to 9 % , down from 10.1 % in January . The state ' s improvement accompanied a strong performance nationally that cut the U.S. unemployment_rate to 6.5 % , from 6.7 % the month before , and added 217 # 000 jobs to employer payrolls . While economists downplayed the significance of the declines in the unemployment_rates -- particularly the often-volatile state and local figures -- they were heartened by the signs of job growth . &quot; We were seeing the job total go_down month after month , and now it seems to be leveling_off , &quot; in the state , said Ted Gibson , principal economist for the California Department of Finance in Sacramento . &quot; There are grounds for encouragement here , especially since February should have had the most negative effects from the earthquake. &quot; &quot; The preliminary sense is . . . we ( in California ) may be out of recession and that it is happening six months sooner than we had expected back in December , &quot; said Larry Kimbell , director of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project . Kimbell said he now expects California to enjoy modest gains in employment this year , reversing a severe decline since mid-1990 that , by some estimates , cost the state more_than 800 # 000 jobs . The jobless report for Los Angeles County was also encouraging , with unemployment dipping to 9.7 % , down from 11 % a month earlier . December ' s unemployment_rate for Orange County -- the most recent figure available -- was 5.3 % , down from 5.6 % in November . The monthly rates for the state ' s counties normally are issued at the end of following month , but January ' s figures have been delayed until next week because of revisions in the method for computing the number of unemployed people and the number of jobs on local payrolls . Analysts cautioned that state and local jobless rates swing widely because they are drawn from relatively small numbers of household interviews . In addition , federal_officials said some of the recent fluctuations may stem from new information-gathering techniques they adopted this year . Consequently , economists focused_on the government ' s separate survey of employer payrolls , which showed the gain of 9 # 500 jobs in California and 217 # 000 nationally . Last month ' s employment increase nationally marked a sharp improvement from frigid January , when weather-related problems led to a 2 # 000-job decline . But the increase in jobs in February , which outstripped the pace of employment growth for 1993 , came even though &quot; the impact of this winter ' s severe weather was still apparent in several industries , &quot; Katherine G . Abraham , U.S. commissioner of labor statistics , told a hearing of Congress ' Joint Economic Committee . Construction , retailing and restaurants all were hampered as bad_weather kept workers and consumers at_home , she said . The general business outlook for the United States appears strong , with the Commerce_Department reporting Friday that the government ' s main forecasting gauge rose 0.3 % in January , the sixth straight monthly increase . The gauge , known as the index of leading indicators , includes measures such_as industrial orders and points to the overall economy ' s likely performance in the next four to six months . Economists said the rebounding national economy may be starting to pull California along with it . At the same time , they said , the job losses from earthquake-related business closings in February were less than anticipated . In addition , analysts said they expect Southern California to enjoy a major pickup in construction in coming months as rebuilding efforts get_into full swing . &quot; It ' s already in the bank that this will be a good year for construction , &quot; Kimbell said . Nationwide , job creation has averaged 146 # 000 a month during the first 13 months of the Clinton_Administration , keeping_on schedule with the White_House ' s goal of generating 8 million jobs during the President ' s term . Still , the production of new jobs remains modest compared with the growth in the output of goods and services : The economy expanded at an annual rate of 7.5 % during the final quarter of last year . This was not accompanied by a vast expansion of jobs because many companies are benefiting from productivity improvements or are choosing to increase overtime hours rather than hire additional workers . &quot; The easiest thing to do is to pay overtime to your current labor_force , &quot; said Rep . Christopher Cox ( R-Newport Beach ) , a member of the Joint Economic Committee . &quot; Hiring a new worker means a large fixed overhead with significant fringe_benefit costs. &quot; While the average workweek in manufacturing , which had been running at near-record levels , dropped last month , the decline was attributed to bad_weather by Laura D ' Andrea Tyson , the head of the President ' s Council of Economic Advisers . Tyson also offered reassuring words for investors worried about erratic bond prices and uncertain financial markets . Inflation won ' t be a menace , she insisted . &quot; When we look_at the fundamentals , we remain absolutely comfortable with the forecast we have out there in terms of ( economic ) growth in the range of 3 % this year and inflation in the range of 3 % this year , &quot; she said . &quot; That is our forecast , and we remain totally comfortable with it. &quot; February was the second month in which the government has used its new survey for measuring unemployment , including a more accurate count of women in the work_force . Under the old system , the jobless rate would have been calculated at 6.4 % in December , 6.3 % in January and 6.4 % last month . Under the new system , the figures were 7 % in December , 6.7 % rate in January and 6.5 % last month . Rosenblatt reported from Washington and Silverstein from Los Angeles .
