   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : MID-CITY : WESTLAKE ; YOUTH SOCCER FIELD TO REPLACE VACANT LOT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For years , the vacant_lot on 3rd Street between Bixel Street and Lucas Avenue lay fallow , hostage to a sluggish economy and the site of makeshift homeless encampments . Few were happy with the arrangement . Not the neighbors . Or the police . Or the development company that owns the property once known as Crown Hill before its elegant homes were razed to make_way for office_buildings , apartments and a hotel -- projects that exist now only in blueprints , awaiting an upturn in the real_estate market . But neighbors , a police_officer , the property manager and a nearby YMCA have teamed_up to make the local children who have no place to play come_out winners . Within weeks , work is expected to begin to turn the approximately three-acre lot into a temporary soccer field to serve as_many as 3 # 500 youths a week , said Mark Young , executive_director of the Ketchum Downtown YMCA , which will supervise the site and develop a free youth recreation program there . Play could begin as early as July . &quot; The kids will go crazy when they see this field , &quot; Young said . &quot; It ' s going_to be beautiful. &quot; Cathay City Development , a Hong Kong-based company , agreed to the temporary soccer field since it has no immediate development plans for the site , said Terry Lee , the property manager . The site will be fenced to prevent the re-establishment of homeless encampments . In the past , Lee reluctantly asked people living_on the site to move , but they usually returned . Amanda Serrano , senior lead officer in the Police_Department ' s Rampart Division , was instrumental in mobilizing neighborhood support for the field and bringing Lee and the YMCA together , with an assist from City Councilman Mike Hernandez ' s office and the Community Redevelopment Agency . &quot; It seemed like a waste of space at a prime location , &quot; Serrano said . &quot; In the Rampart area , there aren ' t many places for children to play and there aren ' t many outlets for organized sports. &quot; The YMCA is talking with World Cup officials about sponsoring and paying_for the field , Young said . If the two fail to reach an agreement , he said , the YMCA will raise the $ 300 # 000 to make_it happen , although that could take a year . Once work_on the field begins , it should take about six weeks to grade the property , put_in the synthetic surface and lights and erect the fence . JAKE DOHERTY</TEXT>
