   <HEADLINE> BURIED TREASURES ; MUSEUMS ARE CASHING IN ON ANCIENT RICHES WITH A DIZZYING ARRAY OF REPRODUCTIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The burnished gold bracelets and jewel-encrusted rings once worn by an ancient Nubian queen brought shivers to the people who run the Metropolitan Museum of Art . The prospect of cashing_in_on the traveling exhibit of riches unearthed from the tomb of Queen Amanishakheto -- who ruled_in the First Century BC in what is now Sudan -- almost made them drool . But the two German museums that own the jewels said nein earlier this year to the Met ' s money-making idea , dashing any dreams of minting and selling reproductions of the 200-piece collection . &quot; It ' s hard to know if donors will come_through with a promised gift or whether the government will continue to give you money , &quot; says Lisa Koch , general-merchandise manager for the New York City museum . Selling reproductions , on the other hand , provides a reliable income , she says . &quot; It ' s not a panacea , but it ' s a way to meet the budget shortfall. &quot; With so many other institutions in the same position , consumers can now choose from a dizzying array of items with roots in ancient Greece , the pre-Columbian Americas and czarist Russia , to name a_few . The market for such jewelry has at least doubled in the last few years , say museum representatives and jewelry_makers , who believe the trend taps into a desire for unusual , historical and ethnic designs . &quot; We ' re getting stampeded now with requests for reproductions from museums all_over the world , &quot; says Julie Levesque , vice_president of Museum Reproductions , a Brookline , Mass. , firm with licenses to reproduce jewelry from 50 museums worldwide . Business has &quot; easily tripled &quot; in the past few years , she says . Interest has been so great that the Met -- long in the business of selling via mail_order everything from greeting cards to candlesticks -- recently issued a separate catalogue of its jewelry reproductions . And costume jewelry giant Monet has joined up with the Smithsonian Institution to produce a line of baubles . &quot; Our target is a more educated , affluent consumer , &quot; says Jennifer Jiunta , director of licensing for Monet , whose new Smithsonian Collection features replicas of Victorian earrings , Art Deco brooches and Renaissance cameos , among other items . &quot; ( We ' ve found ) that women are becoming more individualistic . They want something unique and different , and the cachet of a museum makes a woman feel good. &quot; Mary Cowell , product development manager for Boston ' s Museum of Fine_Arts , agrees . In the 1990s , &quot; People don ' t want name brands , or the biggest or the best , &quot; she says . &quot; ( Museum jewelry ) has symbolic meaning . It ' s taking_home a small part of history. &quot; Most museums and firms offering reproductions enclose a detailed biography of the purchase item . Just browsing through the catalogues can amount to a crash course in decorative-arts history . The Met , for example , notes that its Langobard drop_earrings in 24-karat gold , decorated with enamel and set with cabochon aventurine stones in red and green ( $ 85 ) , date_back to the Seventh Century , when migratory tribes invaded Western Europe and the Byzantine_Empire rose to eminence . The Wayfarer Trading Co . in Vail , Iowa , explains that its cartouche pendants encircling ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics were inspired by those originally worn , 4 # 000 years ago , to protect the spirits of royalty . And a tasteful gold-on-ivory card accompanying the Smithsonian Collection ' s pendant re-creation of an antique Japanese Banko-Yaki rabbit sculpture says the animal is associated with the full_moon in that culture ' s mythology and is the symbol of the Yin , or female principle . The reproductions also offer unlimited possibilities for cocktail_party repartee . &quot; When someone comments on their earrings , they can say , ' Oh , I got them from a museum , they ' re from a painting , ' &quot; Cowell says of the tear-drop pearls copied from artwork by Peter Paul Rubens . Laurel Beizer , who has been making museum jewelry reproductions for 14 years under the name DVB Inc. in New York , says her clients are &quot; very devoted museum-goers , interested in history and art and the museum collection. &quot; While many famous designers re-interpret Byzantine Orthodox crosses or ancient Egyptian ankhs without regard for historical accuracy , Beizer and many of her museum counterparts do extensive research and pay excruciating attention to detail . Among her bestsellers is the &quot; poesy &quot; ring . Inscribed with love sayings , the designs originated_in First-Century Rome and were popular in England and France between the 15th and 17th Centuries . Indeed , the first thing one learns in this field is that every era steals from the past . &quot; Reproductions have been going_on since ancient times , &quot; says Beizer , whose credentials include degrees in fine_arts from the University of Michigan and in jewelry design from the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York . &quot; I have a 19th-Century reproduction of a medieval reproduction of a Roman reproduction of a Greek original . I think we ' re constantly inspired by history. &quot; Detective work is part of the job . Beizer recalls trying to track_down a ring designed by May Morris , a well-known figure in the_British Arts and Crafts Movement , at London ' s Victoria and Albert Museum . A little sleuthing led to a painting of Morris by her husband , portraitist William Morris , in the Delaware Art Museum . The ring turned_up in the portrait . Museum merchandisers , always eager to expand their catalogues , work closely with the business office and the curators , often browsing in the museum ' s archives and storage sites for ideas . The Met ' s Koch says such research sometimes pays_off . Its version of the so-called Venus pearl-drop earrings painted by Rubens , priced at $ 48 for simulated pearls and 24-karat gold electroplate , have sold more_than 100 # 000 pairs over the past five years , she explains . Koch declined to discuss profits , but says the Met goes so far as_to copyright items it believes have good sales potential . The Venus earrings , for instance , were quickly knocked_off by other firms that changed a_few details to avoid copyright infringement . Some museums lean toward exact reproductions of pieces in their collections . Others pluck details out of a painting or sculpture for jewelers to reproduce . Still others take artistic liberty , creating pieces &quot; inspired &quot; by a historic item . The Met ' s &quot; cage-bead &quot; necklace ( $ 525 ) and earrings ( $ 98 ) of blue howlite encased in twisted gold wire , for example , borrow from a hollow , cylindrical bead from ancient Greece . It may take a year or more for a design to travel from the exhibit hall to the shopping_mall . Some pieces are impossible to reproduce , because of either prohibitive cost or technical difficulties , such_as the impossibility of making a mold . As a result , museums often bring_in artisans to sketch and make models of pieces too fragile to mold from the original . Dorothea Arnold , the curator in_charge of Egyptian art at the Met , says jewelers take photos and come_back again and again to show the curators works_in_progress . &quot; We point_out if the colors are matching , if it ' s too far from the original , if it looks_like traditional Egyptian style , &quot; she says . Arnold says that despite late-20th-Century technology , it ' s impossible for contemporary jewelers to cut semiprecious stones into the tiny inlays favored by the ancient Egyptians . &quot; It ' s such fine work we can ' t do_it . It ' s all handwork , and now we use more technical tools . Also , the precision of the joints is hard to achieve. &quot; But the museum ' s Reproduction Studio , which has become a center for the study of advanced duplication techniques , comes pretty close to the originals . There , craftspeople make master molds and patinate and assemble jewelry by hand . Arnold says she has no philosophical objection to copies , so_long as quality comes first . &quot; It has an educational effect and people are made aware of ancient times , &quot; she says . The Met has the second-largest collection of Egyptian artifacts outside of Cairo , but many of its offerings from other places and periods were produced with help from foreign museums . Its current catalogue features a large selection of historic Russian jewelry from the State Historical Museum in Moscow . The grand dowager of American museums also has perhaps the longest tradition of reproducing items from its vast holdings . Jewelry was first copied in 1877 when trustees appointed Tiffany &amp; Co . as the sole agent to manufacture and sell replicas of the finest pieces in the Cesnola collection of handcrafted gold jewelry from Cyprus . Tiffany ' s facsimiles of 146 pieces of the Cypriot jewelry were displayed at the Paris Exposition of 1878 , where they won a gold medal for excellence and were purchased for display by several European museums . While other museums have long sold to a small but steady clientele , the arrival of mainstream fashion jewelers signals a boom for museum reproductions . Monet put a year of research and development into its new museum line of pieces , available at Nordstrom , from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , D.C. , and the Cooper Hewitt Museum in New York , and it has paid_off . &quot; We ' ve had a wonderful response , which told me the business was exploding and growing , &quot; says Jiunta , Monet ' s director of licensing . &quot; The thing is , you have to do_it tastefully. &quot; Sources * The Smithsonian Jewelry Collection by Monet is available at Nordstrom stores citywide . * Metropolitan Museum of Art , ( 800 ) 468-7386 * Museum of Fine_Arts , Boston , ( 800 ) 225-5592 * Wayfarer Trading Co. , ( 800 ) 432-1892</TEXT>
