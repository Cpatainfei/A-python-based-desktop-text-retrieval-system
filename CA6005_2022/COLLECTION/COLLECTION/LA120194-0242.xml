   <HEADLINE> GAO SAYS ILLEGAL MIGRANTS COST STATE $ 2.3 BILLION ; BUDGET : SEN . BOXER USES GOVERNMENT FIGURE TO BOLSTER HER EFFORTS TO GET FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR CALIFORNIA AND OTHER HARD-HIT STATES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The General Accounting Office on Wednesday released a report estimating that California will shoulder $ 2.3 billion in costs during the coming fiscal_year to provide education , emergency Medicaid and adult incarceration for its large population of illegal immigrants . The study , released by Sen . Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) , estimated that the state ' s undocumented population generates $ 1.3 billion in revenues that flow back to the U.S. Treasury . In addition , Boxer used the report ' s findings to estimate that illegal immigrants produce $ 900 million in state and local tax_revenues . She subtracted that figure from the $ 2.3-billion estimate to arrive_at a net cost to California of $ 1.4 billion for education , Medicaid and incarceration . Boxer said she will use the study to make her case that the federal_government should reimburse California and other states hit hard by the costs of dealing with illegal immigration within their borders . &quot; I ' m very excited . We ' re on very firm ground here , &quot; Boxer said in releasing the report . She vowed that the GAO findings -- particularly the federal revenue generated by illegal immigrants -- will make_it easier to find congressional converts to the fight for additional reimbursement to California during next year ' s budget deliberations . &quot; I believe the appropriate use for these revenues would be a reimbursement to the state for its uncovered costs , &quot; she said . Boxer would not speculate on how much money , if any , the new Republican-controlled , budget-cut-minded Congress might allocate for reimbursement funds . But she said President Clinton is sympathetic to California ' s plight . &quot; I predict he will move toward these numbers in a very big way , &quot; Boxer said . Boxer will not seek the entire $ 1.4 billion she estimates is the state ' s net cost . The federal_government already supplies about $ 300 million for various immigrant-related programs , she said , and the political reality in Washington suggests that California would get far less than full reimbursement . As the immigration issue has heated_up in California and elsewhere , controversy has arisen over conflicting studies of the fiscal costs and benefits of illegal immigrants . Boxer requested the GAO study in March to sort_out differing views about the financial impact of illegal immigrants in California . She cautioned that the GAO &quot; wasn ' t thrilled &quot; with the accuracy of some of the data it relied_on to compile the report but said she &quot; felt good_enough so that I can run with them. &quot; The GAO cost figures generally back_up those that Gov . Pete Wilson has used in his effort to win federal reimbursement for such state outlays . But a Wilson spokeswoman criticized Boxer ' s estimate of state and local revenues as &quot; intellectually dishonest. &quot; &quot; This is a victory for California , &quot; said Leslie Goodman , &quot; because . . . an independent group has verified Gov . Wilson ' s cost figures . But we very much disagree_with ( Boxer ' s ) tax figures . The $ 900 million doesn ' t begin to cover the state costs for all services to illegal immigrant services. &quot; The GAO , rather than start from scratch , examined three existing studies of the fiscal impact of illegal immigrants -- two from the state of California and one from the Urban Institute , a Washington think_tank with immigration expertise . Although it questioned some of the methodology and data sources used in all three of the earlier studies , the GAO estimate of $ 2.3 billion in total costs for education , Medicaid and incarceration is virtually identical to the revised figure put_out by the Wilson Administration in September . The state ' s January estimate was $ 2.43 billion for the three major cost areas . After analyzing the data , the GAO increased the state ' s cost estimates for education but reduced the costs of incarcerating illegal immigrants . The GAO accepted the state estimate of its Medicaid costs . But on the revenue side , the GAO admitted that its findings were open_to question . The report noted that researchers must use indirect estimation methods that rely_on varying assumptions about the illegal immigrant population . The GAO chose to accept the Urban Institute ' s data to estimate that illegal immigrants in California generate $ 1.3 billion in federal revenue . But that figure falls between Wilson Administration median and high estimates , which state officials argue are probably overstated . &quot; As a result , there is no agreement about the magnitude of federal revenues generated by this population , &quot; the report said . The GAO had even greater difficulty in estimating the amount of state and local taxes generated by illegal immigrants . The state of California estimates ranged from $ 528 million to $ 1.4 billion ; and Urban Institute researchers arrived_at an estimate of $ 1.1 billion . Given this wide discrepancy , the GAO was unable to reach a conclusion . Boxer chose to use a median estimate of $ 900 million during her news_conference releasing the report . Similarly , Boxer took_a_firmer_stand on the net cost of illegal immigrants than did the GAO . &quot; For several reasons , we were unable to draw any conclusion about California ' s net cost for illegal aliens , &quot; the GAO said .</TEXT>
