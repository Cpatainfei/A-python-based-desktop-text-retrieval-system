   <TEXT> The Department of Veterans Affairs said Friday that it is opening an investigation to learn whether patients at VA hospitals in the 1940s and 1950s were used improperly in nuclear medicine research projects . The probe , announced by Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown , follows decisions by the Defense_Department and the Energy_Department to review files to learn the scope of such experimentation . &quot; We plan to leave no stone unturned in our review of this research , &quot; Brown said in a statement . He added that the investigation will examine the circumstances surrounding nuclear medicine research at VA facilities . &quot; If we find that veterans were subjected_to improper research , that would be morally and ethically unacceptable to me , &quot; Brown said . &quot; We are going_to look_at all_the facts , and if we determine that VA was engaged in any inappropriate research , we will disclose that finding to the American people , notify veterans involved and take appropriate action , &quot; he said . Brown said the VA is asking veterans ' service organizations to make their members aware of the situation . Veterans who are concerned should call the VA toll free at 1-800-827-1000 , Brown said . The White_House has summoned officials from the departments_of_Defense , Veterans Affairs and Energy and from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to meet with Clinton_Administration officials Monday in_order to coordinate a review of files on the experiments .</TEXT>
