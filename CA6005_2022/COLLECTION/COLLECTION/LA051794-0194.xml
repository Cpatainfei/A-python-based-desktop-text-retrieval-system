   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL AGENDA ; THE TROUBLED REIGN OF BHUTTO II ; * IN HER SECOND TERM , PAKISTAN ' S PRIME_MINISTER IS LONG ON RHETORIC AND SHORT ON ACTION , SOME COMPLAIN . HER POLITICAL ENEMIES ARE GAINING_GROUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Within hours after a humiliating defeat for Benazir Bhutto ' s government at a U.N. hearing , a telephone_call came_through to Pakistan from Islam ' s holy_city of Medina . It was Pakistan ' s opposition leader Nawaz Sharif on the line to his party colleagues here , taking time_out from his pilgrimage in Saudi_Arabia to orchestrate their reaction on the home front . They demanded that Prime_Minister Bhutto resign . &quot; Politics in Pakistan can be very rough , &quot; said Sharif ' s press secretary , Mohammed Siddique Farooque . Nobody knows that better than Bhutto , whose populist father was hanged_in 1979 by the general who deposed him as Pakistan ' s leader , and who herself was thrown_out of office in 1990 for her regime ' s fecklessness and cronyism . This time her enemies wanted her head for failing to rally other countries behind a U.N. Human_Rights Commission vote_in Switzerland to censure India for its treatment of Muslims in_disputed , New Delhi-ruled Jammu and Kashmir state . More_than six months into Bhutto ' s second attempt at running one of the Muslim world ' s most turbulent countries , the disappointing lines of what some Pakistani wags are calling &quot; Bhutto II &quot; have become clear . * Even her fans despair that Bhutto appears to have learned little since her first 20-month term in the late 1980s . &quot; Incessant rhetoric that oozed from the government-controlled media about what the government intended to do for the people was a poor substitute for action on the ground , &quot; argues Syed Talat Hussain , assistant editor of the News , a Rawalpindi-based daily . Many of the decisions of Bhutto II , such_as the appointment of female judges and the opening of a police_station staffed by women -- bold innovations in this traditionally male-dominated Muslim society -- &quot; appeared more as staggered , haphazard moves , rather than part of a coherent , long-term policy , &quot; Hussain says . When , at age 35 , Benazir Bhutto became the first female prime_minister of a Muslim nation , she appointed more_than 70 Cabinet_ministers and advisers . This time around , she named only 18 , and is serving as her own finance_minister . Task_forces she has appointed are drawing_up policy guidelines in problem areas such_as agriculture and women ' s issues , but so far there has been little action . Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , Benazir ' s rakish , silver-tongued father , captivated Pakistanis with his brand of &quot; Islamic socialism. &quot; But the 40-year-old daughter , embracing the doctrine of economic liberalism , is now shifting Pakistan toward privatization and denationalization . The challenges are stupendous . &quot; Twelve thousand more people will be born in Pakistan this day . Two thousand of them will be dead within a year , &quot; British journalist Christina Lamb has written in the book &quot; Waiting for Allah , &quot; a searing chronicle of the country ' s difficult search for democracy . &quot; More of them will learn to use a gun than to speak the national language . Medieval sports of cockfighting and bearbaiting will provide more of their entertainment than television , and they will have no theaters or concert_halls to visit . &quot; Only a third will have access to clean drinking_water , and only 15 % will have sewerage . A quarter will go_to school . Many will become heroin_addicts . This is a country killing its future. &quot; Things should have been looking_up instead . As a result of October ' s elections that returned Bhutto to office and the powerbrokering that followed , her Pakistan People ' s Party forged a comfortable if sometimes unstable 30-vote majority in the 217-seat National Assembly . Sardar Farooq Leghari , a longtime ally and former government_minister , was elected president . &quot; Benazir is in a better position than any democratically elected leader of Pakistan has been in , her father included , &quot; one Western diplomat commented . But that may_not be saying much in a country where the army has ruled for 25 of the 47 years since independence , and where generals and the military ' s Inter-Services Intelligence Agency still play a shadowy , uncertain role . One ominous sign of trouble came_in March , when Bhutto failed to get her candidate elected to the politically important post of chairman of the Senate . Even some allies deserted her to back the opposition ' s candidate . This month , she had to send the army into the streets of Karachi after ethnic violence led to at least 26 deaths . The implication was that even in her own power base , the state of Sind , Bhutto has been unable to cobble_together a power-sharing agreement embracing both the rural landholding class she was born into and urban-based , Urdu-speaking Muslim immigrants from India . Election results left opposition forces in_charge of two of the four provinces , North-West Frontier and Baluchistan . The Pakistan People ' s Party managed to destabilize and then supplant the government in North-West Frontier , allegedly through bribery , but the operation badly besmirched the image of Bhutto ' s party . * Hopes that Sharif might agree to a &quot; loyal opposition &quot; role were dashed almost immediately . Given the claustrophobic and painful history of Pakistani politics -- Sharif was a political creation of Zia ul-Haq , the general who had Benazir ' s father hanged -- civility was too_much to ask . &quot; The moment that she shows any flexibility , Nawaz jumps in with his ranting rhetoric and accuses her of selling_out the country , &quot; the Western diplomat said . The problem with the bitter government-opposition deadlock is that for any vote involving changes to the constitution , Bhutto needs Sharif -- who himself was prime_minister from 1990 to 1993 -- and the votes he can muster . For now , the two rivals are unable even to implement their shared desire for abolition of the power held by the country ' s otherwise largely figurehead president to dissolve government and Parliament , a power to which both have fallen victim . Like Sharif ' s tenure as prime_minister and Benazir ' s own initiation into power , Bhutto II kicked_off with a scramble for the spoils of office . Many Pakistanis blame Bhutto ' s abrupt removal in August , 1990 , on the unsavory reputation acquired by her husband , Asif Zardari , a polo-playing contractor dubbed &quot; Mr. Ten Percent &quot; for the rake-off he was said to take from government contracts . Signs are clear that Zardari , who spent 28 months in jail on charges including kidnapings , extortion and misappropriation of government funds before being acquitted , has lost none of his clout . An Indian journalist who came_to Islamabad the day after Bhutto was sworn_in watched as high officials , including the defense and interior ministers , trooped respectfully through her office . &quot; They weren ' t there to see her , &quot; the journalist said . &quot; They wanted to see the husband. &quot; Corruption , cronyism and the spectacle of politicians seeking power for its own sake disgust many Pakistanis who have lost hope that Bhutto or anyone will improve the ordinary citizen ' s lot . &quot; Nobody at the highest circles has the intention of providing services to the people , &quot; declared a Pakistani woman who works for a U.N. agency . &quot; And I mean that in the present tense. &quot; In Bhutto II , the prime_minister has had not only her enemies to worry about but people dear to her as well . Her Iranian-born mother , Nusrat , who last December lost a power struggle with Bhutto for control of the Pakistan People ' s Party , and her younger brother , Murtaza , whom Benazir has allowed to be jailed for allegedly masterminding both the 1992 hijacking of a fishing_boat and the 1981 pirating of a Pakistani airliner , have been among her most vocal and damaging critics . Friends had hoped that the family feud was one trouble that Benazir Bhutto could solve swiftly . But at a rally last month marking the 15th anniversary of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto ' s execution , Nusrat and Murtaza were absent . Murtaza rejected a government offer to attend the ceremonies under police escort , and Nusrat stayed away because only her estranged daughter , and not her son , was there . Changing of the Guard in Pakistan Benazir Bhutto , who became prime_minister for the second time more_than six months ago , caps a long list of government leaders in the country ' s 38 years as a republic . * March , 1956 , Pakistan declared a republic . Iskander Mirza is first president . * October , 1958 , Mirza declares military rule , but later that month , martial_law administrator Muhammad Ayub Khan boots_out Mirza and takes_over as president . * March , 1969 , Ayub Khan is forced to resign because of widespread unrest .
