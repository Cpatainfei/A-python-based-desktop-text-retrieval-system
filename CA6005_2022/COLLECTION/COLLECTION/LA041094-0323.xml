   <TEXT> Michael quickly realized that A Place for Us wasn ' t the place for him . Overweight and suffering from stress , the New Yorker had flown cross-country to attend what was advertised as a weight-loss clinic in sunny Southern California . The air fare was free and the treatment , he was told , fully covered by his Blue Cross plan . But when Michael reached Los Angeles , he was shocked to find himself booked into a psychiatric_hospital in a run-down section of Bellflower where he was diagnosed as suffering from psychotic_depression and bulimia -- conditions he denies ever having . Then he was told he could not leave . Michael ' s is one of many stories emerging from federal and state lawsuits in Los Angeles in which insurers accuse A Place for Us of enlisting doctors and hospital staff to falsify diagnoses and medical_records in_order to obtain payment for treatment that -- whatever its value to patients -- was not covered by their health plans . A Place for Us , the insurers contend in their lawsuits , was at heart a chain of &quot; fat farms &quot; that masqueraded as psychiatric centers because most health plans do not cover weight-reduction therapy . During its peak years from 1989 to 1991 , they estimate , the Orlando , Fla.-based program generated $ 100 million in billings . The program , which also is the focus of a federal grand_jury investigation in Los Angeles , attracted several thousand patients through nationwide ads on television and in magazines such_as People and TV Guide . The campaign was backed_up by a telemarketing sales force and a toll-free phone_line . Marketing blurbs played_up the glamour of the clinic sites here and in Nevada and Florida . &quot; Visit the Queen Mary or take_in a tour of one of Hollywood ' s famous movie studios , &quot; one brochure invited prospective patients , amid photos of the Beverly Center and a bistro at Venice Beach . For most patients , A Place for Us was a free ride , insurers contend . Air tickets , a limousine from the airport to the clinic , four weeks of treatment , outings to Disneyland , Universal Studios and the beach -- all were included in a therapy regimen whose average_cost to insurance_companies was $ 30 # 000 to $ 40 # 000 . The grand_jury probe has resulted in a guilty plea to felony fraud charges by a psychiatrist who admitted falsifying patient records to trigger insurance payments . The psychiatrist , Dr. Barry Alan Smolev , is said to be cooperating with investigators while awaiting sentencing . He declined to be interviewed . The program ' s owner , Janet Greeson , author of popular self-help books , is the main focus of the federal criminal investigation and insurers ' lawsuits . She says she is the innocent object of a Blue Cross vendetta that has crippled her business , saddling her with personal losses of more_than $ 1 million in the last year . Worse than the financial_losses , Greeson said , the legal turmoil has kept her from fulfilling her dream of opening nonprofit counseling clinics in cooperation with the Vatican and Mother Teresa . In an interview , Greeson brandished a list of nearly 100 former patients_of A Place for Us who she said would testify in her behalf . Indeed , several patients telephoned at random from the list warmly praised Greeson and the program . She has countersued the Blue Cross affiliates , charging that they have tried to ruin her by rejecting her clients ' legitimate claims . Under pressure from insurers , A Place for Us has largely folded_up . Greeson operated a similar program until September at a Houston hospital under the name Janet Greeson ' s Your Life Matters , the third name that Greeson had used for her clinics in four years . A Place for Us hit the &quot; radar screen &quot; at Blue Cross of California in April , 1991 , when an unsigned letter reached in-house fraud investigator David R . Ignatius . The letter , entered into court records , charged that A Place for Us patients at Van Nuys Community Hospital were being admitted with diagnoses of severe mental_illness -- most commonly , &quot; major depression &quot; or &quot; psychotic_depression &quot; -- but the vast majority were really there for eating disorders . The informant described walking in on a meeting where Smolev , the psychiatrist , instructed staff_members in falsifying medical_records to support insurance_claims . Staff_members were cautioned against documenting improvement in a patient ' s condition , the informant said , &quot; so that insurance_companies would justify coverage for the entire four weeks of the program. &quot; ( Many health plans have 28-day annual limits on inpatient care. ) Ignatius obtained a computer printout of claims submitted to Blue Cross by the three Los Angeles hospitals then hosting A Place for Us : Van Nuys Community Hospital , Los Angeles Doctors Hospital and Bellflower Doctors Hospital . ( A fourth clinic opened later at Suncrest Community Hospital of Orange County . Outside California , A Place for Us operated at Womens Hospital in Las Vegas , St . Rose Dominican Hospital in Henderson , Nev. , AMI Medical_Center in Orlando , and Peninsula Medical_Center in Ormond Beach , Fla. ) Ignatius discovered that a vast majority of the claims submitted by the three hospitals were for &quot; major depression &quot; treatment and that virtually all_of the patients were from out of state and were insured by Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliates in their home states , according to his court declaration . The hospitals submitted claims to the insurers and paid Greeson ' s program a flat fee for each patient . This had the effect of concealing Greeson ' s role , according to one insurer ' s legal complaint . For example , weekend forays to recreation or shopping_centers were billed as &quot; life skills therapy. &quot; Twelve-step workshops were charted as &quot; cognitive therapy &quot; and aerobics classes as &quot; physical_therapy , &quot; the complaint added . The clinics also routinely waived the 20 % co-payment that many patients were required to pay under their insurance plans , according to the complaint . That had the dual effect of making patients more likely to sign_up for the program and reducing their financial incentive to alert insurers to any irregularities , the complaint said . When Blue Cross of California shared Ignatius ' findings with affiliated plans in other states , they began closely scrutinizing claims generated by A Place for Us , causing payment to screech to a halt . The denial of claims prompted the three Los Angeles hospitals to file for arbitration with Blue Cross . That dispute blossomed into three lawsuits , which have generated more_than 30 volumes of records in federal and state courts . Greeson , the hospitals and the Blue Cross plans are_on the brink of a settlement whose terms will be cloaked by a confidentiality agreement , Blue Cross lawyer William E . Von Behren said last week . But even as that case heads toward conclusion , insurance giant Aetna Life_Insurance Co . has just filed its own massive federal lawsuit against Greeson and the hospital companies , making virtually identical allegations . Among the records that surfaced in the Blue Cross case and that have been incorporated in Aetna ' s complaint are internal memos written by staff_members at Los Angeles Doctors Hospital , suggesting how to resubmit claims that insurers had sent_back to the clinic for more documentation . Said one memo : &quot; This case is very weak in terms of medical necessity . Pt ( patient ) had no prior tx ( treatment ) . She denied ever having suicidal thoughts . . . . Recommendation : Send records in_order to speed_up billing process . Most GM ( General Motors , the patient ' s employer ) contracts have been paying approximately 80 % even when no days are cert ( certified , or approved in_advance by the health plan ) . &quot; Said another : &quot; All the records requested would be appropriate to send except nurses notes , due_to 2 references_to limousine , 1 reference_to OA ( Overeaters Anonymous ) meeting &amp; 1 reference_to working_on the steps. &quot; All of the hospitals initially maintained that they were unaware of any falsification of records and that they believed all treatment was appropriate . However , Asklepios Hospital Corp. , parent of Los Angeles Doctors and Bellflower , broke_with the other defendants and reached a separate settlement with the Blue Cross affiliates late last year . Asklepios also filed a counterclaim against Greeson , repeating many of the Blue Cross allegations . William Bluestein , former program director at A Place for Us at Los Angeles Doctors Hospital and Van Nuys Community Hospital , said in interviews that when the Los Angeles clinics were starting_up in 1989 and 1990 , most patients had genuine psychological problems that led to overeating . &quot; Since the insurance_companies would n ' t treat obesity , we had to use the fiction , &quot; Bluestein said . &quot; It was the insurance_companies ' fault . Everybody felt that way in the beginning. &quot; In weekly meetings , A Place for Us staff_members were instructed -- sometimes by Greeson herself -- how to fill_out patients ' charts or other records to be sure of getting reimbursement , Bluestein said in a court declaration . &quot; Nobody was told to lie , but we were told to emphasize certain things , &quot; he added in an interview . But as Greeson ' s marketing machinery moved_into high_gear , fueled by the national ad_blitz , the clinics saw an influx of patients &quot; who were 20 pounds overweight or who just wanted to get_away , &quot; Bluestein said . Psychiatrist Mark J . Mills , a former Massachusetts mental_health commissioner whom Blue Cross consulted as an expert witness , said in a court declaration that psychiatric hospitalization should be avoided unless a patient is acutely suicidal , is psychotic , has unremitting severe depression or has repeatedly failed to improve under outpatient treatment . A Place for Us patients whose records Mills reviewed &quot; did not demonstrate any of these severe symptoms that would have required extensive inpatient hospitalization , &quot; he said . Mills was also critical of the clinics ' practice of admitting patients without an initial interview by a psychiatrist . Another former program director , Terry Shapiro , said that patients were cleared for admission through conversations with telemarketers on the toll-free line . A psychiatrist often would not see them until a day or two after they checked_into the clinic , he said in a sworn declaration . Shapiro also said as_many as half of the 200 patients who arrived_at the Van Nuys unit during his tenure complained about being admitted to a psychiatric_hospital . Many said that telemarketers at Greeson ' s headquarters had described the facility as a &quot; health spa &quot; or &quot; hacienda , &quot; Shapiro said . When Michael arrived_at Bellflower , he was alarmed to find himself in a mental_hospital and feared that a psychiatric admission would hurt his career , he said in court statements . Admission documents listed his diagnosis as &quot; depression psychosis / severe &quot; and bulimia , both of which were false , he said . After a_few days at the Bellflower facility , Michael said he demanded to go_home . &quot; I was informed by the staff_member that my return airline tickets to New York were locked_in the safe and that if I left before the end of my full scheduled admission that I might be responsible_for paying_out of my own pocket the remaining days ' balance , &quot; he said . Michael eventually got his ticket and was allowed to go_home early . Patients anticipating the glitz of Beverly Hills might have found it jarring to be deposited -- especially by limousine -- at Bellflower Doctors Hospital . The main building -- a two-story box with a gray stone facade -- is arguably the handsomest structure on a dreary stretch of Artesia Boulevard occupied by body shops , storefront insurance offices , the crumbling Midtowne trailer_park and Willie ' s Detail Shop ( &quot; Give Willie Your Auto but Give Jesus Your Soul , &quot; the sign advises ) . Belen Garcia , who hails from the Central Valley town of Reedley , said many of her fellow patients at Bellflower complained about the facility and initially asked to be sent home . Most eventually were talked_into staying , she said , but a_few were allowed to go . Garcia discovered that she was practically the only Californian at Bellflower during her stay . She recalled in an interview that A Place for Us staffers had strongly urged her to fly to Florida to attend the program . But never having been_on an airplane and fearful of traveling so far from home , she had insisted on staying in California . Most patients attended A Place for Us clinics in other states , which made_it more difficult for their home-state health plans to discover problems with the program , Blue Cross said . Frank L . Ettin , an attorney for Blue Cross of California , explained that when dealing with out-of-state patients , hospitals bill the local Blue Cross or Blue Shield affiliate and the affiliate seeks reimbursement from the patient ' s home-state plan . Because it can count_on such reimbursement with no questions asked , Ettin said , the local Blue Cross plan might not pay as close attention to out-of-state claims as it would to those of its own patients . Ettin acknowledged that this is a weakness that Blue Cross is trying to rectify . Patients have said in court declarations that their clinic bills sometimes listed treatment they never received or that the time spent with psychiatrists and other therapists was exaggerated . Group_discussions , for example , might appear as individual sessions . During her stay , Garcia said , the Bellflower facility was overcrowded , the program was disorganized and the days were_full of boredom , broken_up by occasional trips to the beach or to theme parks and by regular visits to 12-step programs such_as Alcoholics Anonymous and Overeaters Anonymous . Although she did not have a drinking problem , she said , she learned to be assertive in such meetings and was able to draw some lessons from them . In that way , she said , A Place for Us benefited her . However , the trips to the 12-step meetings were not always closely supervised , investigators say . Blue Cross investigator Bob Casey recalled his surveillance of a vanload of patients being transported from A Place for Us in Las Vegas to an Overeaters Anonymous meeting . As other patients filed into the building for the overeaters session , &quot; these two ladies just hooked_on down the street and went_into Burger King and had it their way , &quot; Casey said . At Bellflower , where patients were put_on a low-fat , sugar-free diet , Garcia said she lost 11 pounds , but gained it back afterward . Janet Greeson twice visited the Bellflower unit during her stay , Garcia said . Clinic employees asked the patients not to raise complaints during Greeson ' s visits , and most patients adhered to the request . Garcia , who is 5 feet 4 and 200 pounds , said she was surprised by Greeson ' s appearance : &quot; I expected her to be thinner . She ' s my size. &quot; Greeson , who calls herself a recovering food addict , said she weighs 190 and is comfortable with her size . In an interview at her headquarters , a modest suite of offices in a one-story commercial building , Greeson said that during the years when she vacillated between crash diets and binges , she hit 350 pounds . After developing her own techniques to address problems she realized were psychologically based , Greeson said , she shed more_than 150 pounds and has kept it off for 17 years . Greeson , 50 , described her metamorphosis in her hit book , &quot; It ' s Not What You ' re Eating , It ' s What ' s Eating You , &quot; a 28-day plan to heal hidden food addiction . Despite modest expectations from publisher Pocket Books ( the initial 1990 printing , in paperback , was 10 # 000 copies ) , Greeson ' s book has become a stunning success in the self-help genre , with more_than 250 # 000 copies in print and a new hardcover edition . The book -- like its recently published sequel , &quot; Food for Love : Healing the Food , Sex , Love &amp; Intimacy Relationship &quot; -- reflects Greeson ' s view that eating disorders arise from deep-seated psychological problems , often caused by trauma associated with childhood sexual abuse . She has said that as_many as three-quarters of A Place for Us patients were , like Greeson , victims of incest or other sexual abuse . Overcoming her compulsion has given Greeson serenity in dealing with other challenges , she said , but serenity does not equal passivity . Greeson , in interviews , defended her programs combatively . &quot; that ' s bull---- ! &quot; she said several times , dismissing allegations by patients and former employees such_as Bluestein and Shapiro . Bluestein turned against her after she disciplined him for sexually harassing patients , Greeson said . Bluestein said later that there was no basis for the allegation and that he quit the clinic over ethical concerns . To the basic accusation that A Place for Us used false medical_diagnoses to obtain insurance payments , she said : &quot; It ' s a lie . How can I get all these psychiatrists to lie_about a diagnosis ? I have that much power ? Nobody ' s going_to put their credentials and license on the line for me. &quot; Greeson said she is unaware of where the federal criminal probe stands . Other_than a January , 1992 , interview that the FBI scheduled with her and then canceled , &quot; I haven ' t heard a word , &quot; she said in a recent interview . Greeson , who uses the title of &quot; doctor , &quot; holds a Ph.D. in clinical_psychology from Columbia Pacific University , an unaccredited correspondence_school in San Rafael . For several years , she ran addiction counseling centers as a civilian employee of the Navy before establishing her treatment clinics beginning in 1986 . In a court declaration , Greeson referred to Michael , the New Yorker who said he was surprised to be in a psychiatric_hospital . &quot; The only explanation which I have for the statement . . . that he did not know his diagnosis , &quot; she said , &quot; is that one of the symptoms of depression is difficulty in concentrating , or that the patient was engaging in denial. &quot; Greeson said that she has lost more_than $ 1 million because of the legal_actions against her . She acknowledged that the program made money in its peak years but added : &quot; Everything I ever made I put into this company. &quot; According to real_estate records , Greeson owns homes and income property in Orlando , Las Vegas and Los Angeles , including two condos in a luxury high-rise on Doheny Drive_in West Hollywood . However , those properties are heavily mortgaged , Greeson said . &quot; I ' m basically broke , &quot; she said . &quot; My liabilities exceed my assets. &quot; As to the future , Greeson said she will continue to market her books , as well as self-produced audio- and videotapes . She has no more hospital relationships but conducts seminars and outpatient therapy . &quot; It ' s better than nothing , &quot; Greeson said . Hospitals tell her they are being driven_out of the inpatient psychiatric business by the insurers ' pressure for cost containment . &quot; You can ' t get patients admitted anymore , &quot; Greeson said .</TEXT>
