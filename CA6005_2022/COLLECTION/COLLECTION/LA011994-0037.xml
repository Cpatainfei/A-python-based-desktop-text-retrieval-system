   <HEADLINE> NO ROOM FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING ; DEFENSE : A POST-COLD WAR PENTAGON NEEDS SOMEONE WHO CAN TRULY MANAGE AND REFORM THE WAY IT WORKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At least one thing that Bobby Ray Inman , President Clinton ' s former nominee for the Pentagon , said in his rather bizarre press_conference Tuesday is both true and important : Clinton does need a secretary_of_defense capable of reforming the way the Pentagon does its business -- not strategy mind you , or military policy necessarily , but business-business , i.e. the buying of equipment , supplies and all else . Inman wrongly implied that there was something new about the gap between the money allowed by planned budgets and the costs of the planned forces . ( We have had gaps like that every year since 1950. ) But he was quite right in stressing that only cost-cutting can save us from even more drastic force-cutting than we have already seen . And there is certainly much room for savings if the 5 # 000-odd regulations that add a mountain of costly paperwork to every purchase can be replaced by a more businesslike system that allows buyers to buy_at the best price . As of now , $ 300 or more can easily be spent on a $ 3 hammer , not because of fraud but because of the need to comply with too many laws . What that means in turn is quite simply that Clinton ' s next secretary_of_defense must be competent enough to manage and even change his department , instead of merely presiding over its customary bureaucratic routines . That sounds like a pretty tame requirement , except that the Clinton_Administration is_well on its way to proving that the United States can survive without a President or a secretary_of_state or a national security adviser willing_and_able to think through and truly supervise foreign_policy . True , one result is that the United States can no longer conduct &quot; crisis-management &quot; for the Bosnias , Somalias and Haitis of the world . Also true , nobody is supervising Clinton ' s mid-level appointees in the State_Department , so that they do pretty much what they want in less-publicized areas that Congress does not watch closely . Thus , at least in one case ( India ) , our relations are being damaged by a &quot; diversity &quot; appointee of rather eccentric views . Still , no disasters have ensued ( touch wood on Korea ) , if only because in these post-Soviet days , the world is more disordered than dangerous for Americans , at least . But the Pentagon is different . Haiti and Somalia can drop_out of the news all_the more easily for being neglected . But the hard reality of the budget gap will not just go_away , and neither can it be dismissed as a mere public-relations problem , as the foreign-policy gap was described when a journalist was recently nominated deputy secretary_of_state for his &quot; media skills. &quot; On the contrary , each day ' s delay adds_to the excessive bills that are piling_up and that must be paid_out in declining budgets . In practice , Clinton needs to find someone for the Pentagon who can actually do the job , i.e. who already knows the Pentagon universe of military_forces , industries , strategies and Joint Commands , which are badly in need of tighter civilian control . To nominate a newcomer who would have to learn on_the_job would leave the Pentagon virtually unmanaged until well into the third year of the Clinton_Administration , going_by past experience . The standard complaint is that after 12 years out of office , the Democrats have no suitable nominees with experience . That is not true at all for the Pentagon slot . Harold Brown , perhaps Jimmy_Carter ' s most successful appointee , may again be willing to serve as secretary_of_defense . William Perry , the current , much-respected deputy , is a brilliant technologist whose competence is much broader that that . James Woolsey , now the CIA director , has vast experience in defense across the board , as well as proved executive skills . And if bipartisanship is wanted , there is James R . Schlesinger , both strategist and budget expert , who really did cut costs in that job once before ( by tough bargaining , not by issuing yet more regulations ) . The one thing that Clinton should avoid is another &quot; imaginative &quot; choice suggested , as Inman was , by his foreign-policy advisers . Goodness knows , there is plenty for them to do_in their own neglected department .</TEXT>
