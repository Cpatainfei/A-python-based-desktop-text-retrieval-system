   <HEADLINE> HEAVY RAINFALL EXPECTED FROM ALASKAN STORM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Forecasters expected a storm moving south from the Gulf of Alaska to hit the area early today , bringing_up to two inches of rain along the coast and up_to four inches in the mountains . &quot; This will be one of the most significant rain producers of the season , &quot; said Clint Simpson , a meteorologist with the National Weather Service . &quot; Whenever you have a cold_front bumping_into a moist flow of air like this you ' re going to get a lot of rain. &quot; Forecasters said the cold_front moving with the storm could drop temperatures by 10 degrees or more , with nighttime lows falling to the low 40s and daytime highs to the low 60s . Warm air from the southwest will prevent temperatures from dipping any lower , but will contribute to the amount of rainfall expected , forecasters said . The weather service has a flash_flood watch in_effect , and forecasters said the rains could pose a problem in the areas where the November fires burned away vegetation . &quot; The risk is that the ground will become saturated , and that ' s when you get the mud flows like they had in Malibu during the last rains , &quot; Simpson said . Although county officials said they were not anticipating any major flood problems , they were keeping a close eye on the fire-scorched areas . &quot; We have made_sure that the people living_in those areas have been made aware of the problems that can occur after a major brush_fire , &quot; said John Weikel , a senior engineer for the Ventura County Flood_Control District . On Wednesday , officials from the mountains to the sea geared_up for the winter storm . &quot; We ' re just telling people to come_up here prepared_for the worst , &quot; said Don Trammell , recreation officer for the Mt . Pinos Ranger District . &quot; We ' ve got some nice cross-country skiing up here , but be careful on your drive_up . When the rain and snow hit , it tends to get slick. &quot; Forecasters said the snow level could drop as low as 4 # 000 feet and a fresh blanket of up_to two feet of snow could fall by the weekend . Trammell said visitors to the mountains should wait a_few days for the snow to settle so maintenance crews can clear the roads . &quot; This storm probably won ' t interfere with traffic on Interstate 5 , but the roads up_to campsites and the recreation area on Mt . Pinos take two to three days to clear , &quot; he said . Already , area stores have received calls from skiers looking_to rent equipment . At the Sport Chalet sporting goods store in Oxnard , Chuck Dawley said he was anxious to hit the slopes . &quot; Any extra snow we get ( from this storm ) is just a bonus , &quot; said Dawley , who is heading to Mammoth Mountain with his two children . Just as park officials were calling_for caution on mountain roads , the U.S. Coast Guard was warning boaters to avoid stormy seas . &quot; When the wind gets_up over 15 m.p.h. the seas become very uncomfortable , &quot; said Petty_Officer Roger Fuller . &quot; When they get_up over 20 m.p.h. it gets downright dangerous. &quot; Winds , which are expected to be between 20 and 30 m.p.h. , make waves steep enough to capsize small_boats , he said , adding that the greatest danger is that the weather can turn_on boaters with a sudden ferocity . &quot; One minute you ' re out there having a fine time and the next minute the seas are kicking_up all around you , &quot; he said . &quot; The best thing to do is stay away when storms like this are expected. &quot; County officials said a storm like the one expected today has been long overdue , as rainfall levels have remained well below the 30-year average . To date this rain season , Ventura should have received about 10 inches of rain , but has had only 5.27 inches . Thousand Oaks normally has nine inches of rain by this time , but has had only 4.53 inches . Forecasters said the bulk of this storm ' s rain will drop today , leaving a chance of scattered showers for Friday and the weekend . Photographer Alan Hagman contributed to this story .</TEXT>
