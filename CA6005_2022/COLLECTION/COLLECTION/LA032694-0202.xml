   <HEADLINE> MCNALL ORDERED TO PAY BANK $ 2.1 MILLION ; HOCKEY : KING OWNER DEFAULTED_ON PERSONAL_LOAN RECEIVED FROM A TORRANCE BANK , JUDGE RULES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> King owner Bruce McNall has been ordered by a Los Angeles Superior_Court judge to pay a Torrance bank $ 2.1 million for defaulting_on a personal_loan , court documents show . The judgment is the latest setback for the sports mogul in what has become a growing list of business-related problems . Court papers show Judge John P . Shook ' s judgment was entered last week in favor of Republic Bank , which sued McNall in October . The bank alleged that McNall defaulted_on the unsecured promissory_note when he failed to pay $ 1.875 million last May as required . McNall officials have previously said a settlement with the bank was in the works . Court documents show that the bank received a judgment for the entire amount it was seeking , along with court costs , fees and interest that accumulates from March 15 until the judgment is paid . In a statement , a McNall spokesman said : &quot; The matter has been concluded amicably , and we will address the satisfaction of the judgment shortly. &quot; Documents filed by Republic last fall included a sworn statement from Republic Vice_President Lee Marzahl , who referred to McNall ' s lack of ability to quickly convert assets into cash . In interviews , McNall officials have denied he is experiencing liquidity problems . McNall was sued last week in federal_court in New York by Dutch-owned European American Bank for allegedly defaulting_on a separate loan . European American is alleging McNall owes $ 27.8 million in principal on a loan , and at least $ 442 # 864 in interest . McNall officials say the European American lawsuit is without merit , adding that McNall disputes that the debt even exists . McNall is trying to wrap_up a $ 60-million deal to sell 65 % of the Kings to telecommunications executive Jeffrey Sudikoff and partner Joseph Cohen . The sale is largely to help McNall rid himself of a loan with Bank of America , which extended his businesses $ 90 million in loans and credit . McNall has consistently denied that he is experiencing financial problems . Those familiar_with his finances say he has been especially hard hit by such factors as a decline in the rare coin business , a high debt level and losses from his ownership in the Toronto Argonauts football_team .</TEXT>
