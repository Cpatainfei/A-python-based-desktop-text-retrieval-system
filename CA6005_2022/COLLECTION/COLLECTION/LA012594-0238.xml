   <HEADLINE> MEXICO ACCUSED OF HUMAN_RIGHTS ABUSES DURING REVOLT ; REPORT : AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL SAYS SOLDIERS TERRORIZED INDIAN VILLAGERS . ARMY HAS DENIED VIOLATING THE LAW , BUT GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO HELP WITH PROBE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A leading human_rights group charged Monday that Mexican soldiers terrorized Indian villages -- beating , torturing and kidnaping inhabitants -- in the aftermath of the New Year ' s uprising in the southern state of Chiapas . Amnesty International investigators , in a report expected late Monday , accused the army of gross human_rights violations and cited disappearances and summary executions among the abuses . Attempts to probe suspected executions have been stifled by the government ' s failure to allow foreign forensics experts to examine bodies or autopsy files , according to the report . The government has also refused to exhume corpses from 48 unmarked graves in a cemetery in the state_capital , Tuxtla Gutierrez , said investigators from other human_rights groups . The army has issued blanket statements denying any violations of the law but refused repeated requests for information about specific charges . The charges came as U.S. and Canadian politicians and citizens groups are questioning their countries ' closer economic ties to a government that may have permitted brutalization of civilians in its efforts to put_down the rebellion by an estimated 2 # 000 Indians . Amnesty investigators said about 70 Indians are being held without charge in the Chiapas state_prison . Most claim to be victims of army roundups of villagers suspected to have ties to the Zapatista National Liberation Army , the rebels who on New Year ' s Day took_over four county_seats in Chiapas , an impoverished state on the Guatemalan border . As the guerrillas pulled_out of the towns into the jungle a_few days later , an estimated 15 # 000 troops moved_in . The army closed_off the roads into formerly rebel-held areas and , according to eyewitness accounts cited by Amnesty , began a brutal search for insurgents . Rep . Robert G . Torricelli ( D-N.J. ) has scheduled a hearing for Feb . 2 on allegations of army abuses . Clinton_Administration officials have also expressed concerns that Mexico is not demonstrating the sensitivity to human_rights that they would expect from a partner in the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , which took_effect Jan . 1 . The government struck a conciliatory tone toward the rebels after a chorus of national and international protests greeted the army ' s attempts to defeat them during the first week of the uprising . That change in strategy came_after Jan . 7 , the morning soldiers entered the village of Morelia , near the previously occupied town of Altamirano , residents told Amnesty investigators . That day , the men of Morelia were assembled and told to lie face down on the basketball_court that also serves as the town square , townspeople said . Three men were taken into the church ; their screams could be heard for the next three hours . According to the Amnesty report , the men were then taken_away in an army ambulance , one of them bleeding profusely , and have not been seen since . Another group was taken_to the state_prison , where Amnesty investigators interviewed them Friday . The rest lay on the court until the soldiers left at about 6 p.m. &quot; There was a general brutalization of people , &quot; said Amnesty investigator Carlos Salinas . The human_rights group based its findings on photos of bodies , interviews with villagers and a visit to the state_prison , he said . Following a week of futile attempts , human_rights workers were allowed into the prison Friday after Torricelli complained directly to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , who is not related to the human_rights investigator . Interviews with prisoners also provided important evidence , said human_rights activist Salinas , that seven bodies found in the market of another town , Ocosingo , site of the rebellion ' s fiercest fighting , were victims of executions . The bodies were found lined_up with their hands behind their backs and bullet wounds in their heads . Prisoners reported having been bound with yellow cord similar to that found next to the Ocosingo bodies , and cuts on their wrists were similar to those in photographs of the corpses , Salinas said . Amnesty had to base its report on photos taken by the first news photographers to arrive in Ocosingo after the fighting , because the government ' s National Human_Rights Commission refused to let the organization see autopsy reports .</TEXT>
