   <HEADLINE> HOW THE WEST WAS DRAWN ; WORLD-CLASS EXHIBIT FROM THE GILCREASE COLLECTION SHOWCASES PAINTINGS BY MASTERS THAT PAY HOMAGE TO AMERICA ' S PAST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Western art , &quot; James Nottage mutters . &quot; In some art circles , that ' s considered an oxymoron. &quot; The chief curator at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum emphatically begs to differ . In Nottage ' s view there are great works of Western art , even great works of narrative Western art -- those often-despised pictures and sculptures that tell a story . As if to prove Nottage ' s point , a major show of compelling Western art will open Saturday at the museum in Griffith Park . Called &quot; Western Masters , &quot; the exhibit will feature treasures from one of the world ' s finest collections of art of the West -- that of the Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa , Okla . Thomas Gilcrease , whose mother was of Creek Indian origin , was an oilman who personally amassed more_than 350 # 000 Western artifacts and artworks before his death in 1962 . Nearly 50 paintings and sculptures from that unparalleled cache will go_on display , including important works by such major figures as Albert Bierstadt , Thomas Moran , Frederic Remington and Charles Russell . Nottage is thrilled that Angelenos will have a chance to study the Gilcrease treasures up close . &quot; Not everybody can go_to Tulsa to see this great collection , &quot; he notes . And many of the most important developments in Western art will be represented , from formal portraits of Indian leaders to heart-stopping landscapes that let Europeans know that the Rockies were every bit as majestic as the Alps , from roiling buffalo hunts to remarkably modern work by members of the Taos Society of Artists . Unlike some critics , many Americans love Western art . The West is the great tragic stage of American expansion , its despoiled Eden , a place of almost infinite geographical and geological variety and a symbol -- all at one time -- of national ambition , hope and unspeakable loss . As Canadian historian Brian Dippie writes in an insightful essay in &quot; The Oxford History of the American West , &quot; critical fashions come and go but &quot; Western art continues to appeal_to rainbow-chasers everywhere. &quot; The Autry show brings_together many of the works that shaped our collective vision of the West . Whatever the historical truth , the West we all know is the one created by artists such_as Bierstadt and Russell ( and film_makers such_as John Ford ) . The show could be called &quot; How the West Was Made. &quot; * Certain subjects appear again and again in Western art -- Native_Americans ( depicted as doomed innocents or maniacal savages , depending_on the decade and the artist ' s politics ) , mountains , mesas , cowboys and thousands and thousands of fierce and shaggy buffalo , our bizarre national beast . One of the most important pictures in the show , according to Nottage , is John Mix Stanley ' s &quot; Buffalo Hunt. &quot; Stanley was one of many Western artists who documented the visual West while traveling with an expedition surveying for a railroad . Stanley knew whereof he painted -- his canvas includes a self-portrait of the mighty hunter . Stanley ' s work is especially precious because it is so rare . &quot; Most of his work was destroyed when the Smithsonian burned in 1865 and the Barnum collection burned the same year , &quot; says Nottage . The curator notes that the Autry has three Stanleys in its collection . Heroic landscapes will be part of the show , including Albert Bierstadt ' s &quot; Sierra_Nevada Mountains in California , &quot; painted around 1863 . For a time the German-born and -trained Bierstadt was so identified with stirring paintings of American peaks that a critic quipped that the artist had &quot; copyrighted all_the principal mountains. &quot; One of the surprises of the show is a Bierstadt seascape , &quot; ' Point Lobo , California , &quot; done_in 1875 . Thomas Moran ' s paintings of Great Hot Springs and the Lower Falls_in Yellowstone , both done_in 1893 , not only documented the look of the West , but also helped shape its history . The English-born Moran was part of a U.S. government-sponsored expedition to Yellowstone in 1871 , and the images Moran produced from that experience helped persuade Congress to turn Yellowstone into the world ' s first national_park the following year . Another non-native artist who lovingly depicted the West was Henry Farny , who was born in France and trained in Europe before settling in Cincinnati , Ohio . Farny ' s 1905 oil &quot; Fording the Stream &quot; shows a scene in the everyday life of the Indians who were vanishing even as Farny observed them as a young_man . The show will include little-known works , such_as two tiny canvases painted by Walter Shirlaw , who recorded the cultures of the Northern Cheyenne and Crow as one of five official artists assigned to the census of American_Indian tribes undertaken in 1890 . &quot; What ' s neat about Shirlaw is he was an early Impressionist , and these paintings are startling , &quot; Nottage says . While the unexpected will be featured , the familiar will not be ignored . Both Frederic Remington and Charles Russell will have an honored place in the exhibit . Historian Dippie thinks that ' s a good thing , even a brave thing , given the critical disdain with which these artists are often regarded . Dippie recalls that a reporter once demanded that he tell her why she should like Russell ' s work . Dippie felt something akin to despair . &quot; You can ' t defend any art when it ' s guilty until proven innocent , &quot; he says . Dippie won ' t go so far as_to describe the work of the two Rs as great , but it is , he maintains , extremely important art . The men were very different , he observes . Remington &quot; championed the winning of the West , whereas Russell lamented all that was lost. &quot; They were opposed in their sympathies as well . Russell loved cowboys and Indians , while Remington was an equal-opportunity racist , whose views are reflected in his 1899 oil , &quot; Missing. &quot; The title is an ominous reference_to the status of the valiant soldier who appears in the center of the canvas , on foot , a rope around his neck , being led by a band of mounted Indians to what we know , with a shudder , will be a hideous death . In their very different ways , Dippie says , Remington and Russell &quot; represent the nub of the tradition , they really represent the core. &quot; Even now , when we think_about the West , we tend to do so in the images created by these two men . It ' s fascinating , Dippie notes , &quot; how strongly they impressed their vision on the future. &quot; As an example of the durable legacy of Western art , Dippie cites the popularity of Kevin Costner ' s &quot; Dances With Wolves , &quot; in which images straight out of Remington are recycled into something more in sync with contemporary values . &quot; The key thing in Western art is that it provides all_the images , and we can continue to translate them in terms of current concerns. &quot; Dippie is shamelessly fond of Russell , who is represented in the show by two bronzes , a sculpture of Will Rogers and one of an ursine &quot; Mountain Mother , &quot; and two oils , &quot; Wagon Boss &quot; ( 1909 ) and &quot; A Bad One &quot; ( 1920 ) . Dippie thinks the scornful fail to appreciate the power of Russell ' s enduringly popular work , which piles tumbleweed on buffalo skull until the authentic details accrete into &quot; a vision of something lost and wonderful. &quot; Dippie is one of those who stands_in front of a Russell painting and sees , not cowboys or Indians , cattle or wagon_wheels , but a Western paradise that may never have existed anywhere except in the artist ' s mind .
