   <HEADLINE> MOON STRUCK ; IT ' S BEEN 25 YEARS SINCE ' BUZZ ' ALDRIN DAZZLED THE WORLD BY PLANTING OUR FLAG ON THE MOON . NOW , AMID THE RUSH OF ACTIVITY MARKING THE EVENT , MANY WONDER : WHAT DID WE LEARN UP THERE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Out of the cool darkness and crackling static of space came a message any earthling could understand : &quot; Picking_up some dust. &quot; With those words , Apollo 11 astronaut Edwin E . ( Buzz ) Aldrin Jr . radioed Earth that his space module was 40 feet above the moon and ready to touch_down . It was 1:18 p.m. on July 20 , 1969 -- a day when America was bitterly divided over the Vietnam_War and barreling on a fast track toward more political havoc . Less than 48 hours before , Ted Kennedy ' s car had careened off a bridge at Chappaquidick . Angry civil_rights protests were planned in big cities for the fall and the Chicago Conspiracy Trial was soon to begin . Not a pretty time . But when mission commander Neil A . Armstrong took his first_steps on the lunar surface that afternoon , the nation momentarily forgot its turmoil . Worldwide , more_than 600 million people were riveted to television_sets and radios , spellbound as humans swept aside one of the last great barriers to manned space exploration . &quot; We learned that man can damn well do anything he sets his mind to do , &quot; says Walter Cronkite , who broadcast the event on CBS-TV . &quot; And the challenge was to keep this lesson in front of us . If we could get_to the moon , we should be able to solve any problem on Earth . that ' s what the moon_shot said to us. &quot; It marked the last time America felt so confident about itself , and then-President Richard M . Nixon walked a fine line between hyperbole and pride , calling the Apollo 11 voyage the most significant week since Creation . The plaque left_behind by the crew read : &quot; We Came in Peace for All Mankind. &quot; A quarter of a century later , Apollo 11 ' s stunning technological achievement is unquestioned . Yet the meaning of it all is up for grabs . The memory of what once seemed our finest hour has been eroded by national malaise , petty political wrangling and the abrupt end of the Cold_War . Today , there are no more Soviets to race . No more propaganda battles to be won . NASA ' s once limitless horizons have degenerated into nasty budget squabbles , and a whole new generation has come_of_age since the last Apollo landing in 1972 . Perhaps fittingly , the historic picture of Aldrin saluting an American flag on the moon is_best known as an MTV logo . So what did_it all amount to , that memorable summer day when Armstrong and Aldrin hopped_on the lunar surface , 240 # 000 miles from Earth ? As the mission ' s 25th anniversary approaches , a flood of books , magazines , TV specials , films and high-level conferences are trying to provide an answer . &quot; That first moon_shot was the finest moment of the 20th Century , &quot; says John Mosley , an astronomer at Griffith Observatory , where packed crowds have lately been watching a retrospective film on the Apollo 11 mission . &quot; But times change . Maybe we ' re becoming one of those countries that achieves great things , then retreats to wrestle with its own problems . Others with greater vision may take the lead away from us , and that ' s sad. &quot; For some , a fading space effort is welcome news . Why spend billions to bounce a man on the moon when people are starving on Earth ? Civil rights leaders voiced these thoughts as the Apollo 11 crew took_off , and many anti-poverty activists in U.S. cities echo the same concerns today . &quot; I don ' t know anybody who even talks_about ( space ) anymore , &quot; says Teddy Watkins Jr. , with the Watts Labor Community Action Committee . &quot; When you think_of all_the money that ' s been spent out there in space , it could have gone_a_long_way toward pulling this country up by its boot straps. &quot; Others disagree , saying America must continue its travels through the universe . The urge to explore and discover , they say , is as fundamental to human nature as the need to procreate . Just ask the men who have been there . Indeed , Alan B . Shepard Jr. , America ' s first man in space , and James A . Lovell Jr. , pilot of the Apollo 13 mission , have published dramatic memoirs of what it was like to visit the moon . Other experts have written provocative histories of the space_program , and NASA is reissuing documents from the first moon flight , trying to put a positive spin on the benefits of U.S. space exploration . Meanwhile , Spaceweek International Assn . is hosting several commemorative events in Southern California , including an Apollo 11 Anniversary dinner with Vice_President Al Gore , an astronaut-celebrity golf tournament and &quot; Family Science Space Day &quot; at the California Museum of Science and Industry . The rush of activity is nothing new , because the Apollo moon landing triggered a similar reaction in 1969 . And a look_back at books and statements by the three crew_members , as well as by critics such_as Norman Mailer , show that the debate over space hasn ' t changed much in 25 years . Then as now , faith in science collides with more troubling questions : What have we really learned from going_to the moon ? Has it made us better people ? And what will we do with the awesome power of space flight in the future ? * As he looks_out the window of his hotel_room , high atop New York ' s Central_Park , the grand old_man of U.S. space_travel doesn ' t offer any easy answers . But Shepard , who captured America ' s imagination with his 1961 sub-orbital ride in space , insists that going_to the moon has taught us as much about ourselves -- and our limits -- as it has about the pockmarked lunar surface . He explores these issues in &quot; Moonshot &quot; ( Turner Publishing ) , a memoir co-written with late astronaut Deke Slayton . The book , which has begun climbing bestseller lists , is also the subject of a forthcoming WTBS special , and Shepard is promoting the book and film on a national tour . &quot; Occasionally I ' ll give speeches and talk_about my personal feelings of looking_back toward Earth from the moon , &quot; says Shepard , who led the Apollo 14 lunar mission in 1971 and was the first man to hit a golf_ball on the moon . &quot; I realized up there that our planet is not infinite . It ' s fragile . That may_not be obvious to a lot of folks , and it ' s tough that people are fighting each other here on Earth instead of trying to get_together and live_on this planet . We look pretty vulnerable in the darkness of space. &quot; Like other NASA boosters , Shepard rattles_off the Apollo_program ' s impressive scientific achievements : Unprecedented knowledge of the lunar surface . Digital computer research that ' s led to the development of laptops in our time . Products such_as Velcro and Teflon that impact millions . The vast , untapped promise of resources for clean , nuclear_fission , such_as Helium 3 , on the moon . Yet he concedes that most people don ' t relate to advanced research unless it directly impacts their lives . Americans have always wanted to know their astronauts as people first and scientists second . that ' s not been easy with the U.S. space_program , whose current astronauts speak fluent data and little else . &quot; I wanted to get_away from that and show these guys as real human_beings , &quot; says Andrew Chaikin , author of &quot; A Man on the Moon &quot; ( Viking ) , an authoritative history of the Apollo_program . &quot; We never really absorbed the moon experience because we didn ' t know what it was like for these guys. &quot; How many readers , for example , know that Armstrong -- widely perceived in 1969 as shy , remote and tongue-tied -- had a sly wit and played ragtime piano in bars near Edwards Air_Force Base ? It ' s all there in Chaikin ' s 670-page book , along with stories of astronauts who had epiphanies and religious moments as they hurtled back to Earth from the moon . Lovell is a good_example . &quot; After my trip , I got a better sense of our role in the universe , and it made me feel humble , &quot; says the man who flew the Apollo 8 and 13 missions . He ' s now written his story in &quot; Lost Moon &quot; ( Houghton Mifflin ) , focusing mainly on the oxygen tank explosion that nearly killed his crew and caused them to abort their 1970 landing . The astronaut also recalls his 1968 flight , which was the first to orbit the moon and beamed back one of the most historic photos ever taken of the Earth . It was the famous &quot; blue marble &quot; picture_showing terra_firma in the icy blackness of space . The picture eventually became a U.S. stamp , a rallying symbol for environmentalists and a marketing tool for everything from Reeboks to Whole Earth Catalogues . Lovell worries that the photo ' s underlying message has been lost . &quot; Back in the 1960s , you had a moment when everything seemed possible with the space_program , &quot; he says . &quot; But today , we ' re vacillating over space priorities . We study everything to death . We ' ve lost the momentum to explore that we once had . Under John F . Kennedy , we were gung-ho to reach the moon. &quot; * If there was a spiritual nadir for the New Frontier , it was early 1961 . On April 12 , the Soviets announced that cosmonaut Yuri A . Gagarin had orbited the globe . Five days later , the Bay of Pigs invasion collapsed on Cuban beaches . Out of such turmoil the Apollo space_program was born . Kennedy , eager to fulfill the promise of his &quot; Get America Moving &quot; rhetoric and determined to catch_up_with the Soviets , asked his top advisers what the United States should do to win the space race . The answer , however daunting , seemed obvious : Go_to the moon . Kennedy promised a landing by the end of the 1960s and the goal was met . Yet it happened largely because of circumstances that would be hard to duplicate now , says James Kauffman , professor of communication at Indiana University Southeast and the author of &quot; Selling Outer Space : Kennedy , the Media and Funding for Project Apollo &quot; ( University of Alabama Press ) . &quot; You had a charismatic President , a worthy opponent in the Russians and a very compelling myth for most Americans , &quot; Kauffman explains . &quot; Going_to the moon was a reflection of the old frontier story that this country loves : Good_guys clash with an enemy , go_into the wilderness and come_back victorious. &quot; Digging through records of congressional testimony , Kauffman notes that many scientists and military experts initially opposed the moon program . Some believed it was unnecessary to put humans on the lunar surface , since robot technology could get there faster and cheaper . Others objected that the cost of the Apollo moon program , then pegged at $ 24 billion , was exorbitant . &quot; None of these critics could brush_aside the frontier argument , and so the Administration relied heavily on that in its rhetoric with the American people , &quot; Kauffman says . &quot; The moon was to be our destiny , pure and simple. &quot; A President rallying such an effort today would face tough obstacles , he adds . Americans are no longer paranoid about Soviet scientific expertise , and concerns over the budget_deficit make new spending programs suspect . Former President George_Bush learned this in 1989 , when he tried to inspire the country with a new space push culminating in a manned voyage to Mars . The effort fell_flat and was eventually abandoned . Few people seemed to notice . * Is it because space_travel seems passe ? Or that a vital human element has long been missing from America ' s space exploration programs ? Those concerns surfaced in 1969 , even before Apollo 11 blasted_off from Earth . Norman Mailer , on assignment for Life magazine , wrote &quot; Of a Fire on the Moon , &quot; an account of the mission that deviated sharply from mainstream press coverage . Instead of beating his chest , the author took a skeptical view of the event , referring throughout to himself and his private thoughts : &quot; He hardly knew whether the Space_Program was the noblest expression of the 20th Century or the quintessential statement of our fundamental insanity . . . . The world would cheer America for a day , but something was lacking , some joy , some outrageous sense of adventure. &quot; One problem , Mailer suggested , was that the astronauts seemed rigid and machine-like , with no human detail . When Armstrong made his famous comment on the moon -- &quot; that ' s one small step for man , one giant step for mankind &quot; -- the author despaired that even this epochal moment had lost its magic : &quot; It was as if on the largest stage ever created , before an audience of the Earth , a man of modest appearance would walk to the center , smile tentatively at the footlights , and read a page from a data card. &quot; Many of the books written by astronauts in later years did little to dispel this concern . For example , &quot; First on the Moon &quot; by Armstrong , Aldrin and Michael Collins ( Little Brown , 1970 ) , remains a breath-taking recapitulation of the mission . Yet there ' s scant evidence of the crew ' s innermost thoughts . Today , Chaikin , Kauffman and others worry about the space_program ' s continuing lack of human scale . Shuttle flights seem to blend into one another , and their scientific experiments are not widely understood . But some suggest that critics have failed to celebrate the romance in space technology that ' s been there all along . You just have to know where to look . &quot; Long after the Vietnam_War is footnotes , people will remember that we went_to the moon , and that it was a great adventure , &quot; says Los Angeles author Mike Gray , who has written &quot; Angle_of_Attack &quot; ( Penguin ) , a history of the Apollo_program . &quot; Five hundred years from now , we ' ll be occupying every flat surface in the solar_system that isn ' t boiling , simply because it ' s out there . It ' s our business to spread life . We are the intelligent life force , &quot; he adds . For Gray , who also penned &quot; The China Syndrome , &quot; the unsung heroes of Apollo are the nearly 400 # 000 technicians who worked tirelessly to make the program a national success . If Nixon ' s name is_on the moon , he argues , their names should be up there as well . Meanwhile , the poetry of space_travel remains potent and alluring . &quot; Once we solve our short-range problems , visionaries will point us to Mars , &quot; Gray says . &quot; And we ' ll go not because of technology , but because we watch ' Star Trek. ' These are the myths of our time . Like the moon_shot itself. &quot;</TEXT>
