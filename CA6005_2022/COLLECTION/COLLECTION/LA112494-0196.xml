   <TEXT> Like children anywhere with an answer to give , the youngsters playing in a suburban park could hardly contain themselves . &quot; Tintin ! Tintin and Snowy ! &quot; several of the small_voices exclaimed in chorus . &quot; Captain Haddock ! &quot; came another reply . &quot; Oh , I love them all ! &quot; shouted a little 8-year-old named Laura , jumping up and down . The children were reeling_off their fictional heroes -- and none were from anyplace new . Forget the latest gimmicks marketed to dazzle their young lives . Forget the Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles , the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , Strawberry Shortcake and the Care Bears . Don ' t even think_about Beavis and Butt-head . No , this excitement was aimed at the figures in one of Europe ' s oldest comic_strips , &quot; Tintin &quot; -- whose title character is a fresh-scrubbed teen-age newspaper reporter with a face so open and free_of detail that he tickles imaginations from Hanoi to Helsinki . Through a series of adventures that are really miniature morality_plays , enjoyed as much by parents as children , he confronts an array of villains ranging from hard-line Stalinists to Chicago mobsters . So far , the stories have appeared in 51 languages -- roughly twice as_many as &quot; Peanuts &quot; -- and are probably the most widely translated features in the world . In the process , Tintin has become a Belgian national treasure , a character so popular throughout the Francophone world that the late French President Charles de Gaulle once quipped , &quot; Tintin is my only international rival. &quot; Now , De Gaulle ' s rival is making a new run at the United States . Although first translated into English in the late 1950s and widely known today in Britain , the series has never really caught_on big in America . But its backers think now is the time . An animated television series of Tintin ' s adventures , which began on Home Box_Office in 1991 , boosted American sales of Tintin books . And his premiere this fall_in an after-school time_slot on the Nickelodeon cable channel will nearly quadruple the potential audience from 16 million to 60 million households , according to Louise Desjardins , the American agent for Tintin ' s Belgian publisher , Casterman . In January , Sony Wonder will begin marketing videocassettes of Tintin ' s adventures , and Desjardins is convinced that this will help the books catch_on . &quot; The problem ( in the United States ) has always been a lack of exposure , &quot; she said in a telephone_interview from her office in Mystic , Conn . &quot; This is going_to help change that. &quot; Elsewhere in the world , Tintin needs little promotion . It has been 66 years since the young reporter debuted with his little_dog , Snowy . And nearly two decades have passed since the last of his 23 globe-trotting adventures was completed . Yet the appeal seems only to get stronger with time . Nearly 200 million bound volumes of these adventures have been sold around the world . In Europe , the strip ' s remarkable staying power has already made the adventures of Tintin a rare shared experience among generations of comics readers . Grandparents , parents -- and now their children -- have tracked the same characters moving through the same adventures . Francis Panichelli , a senior official at the European Parliament here , recalled how he devoured the Tintin adventures as a child , then put them aside as a teen-ager only to rediscover them as he began reading them to his own son . &quot; I hadn ' t touched them for 20 years , but when I did , I understood them at a different level , &quot; he said . &quot; They were as interesting for me as for my son. &quot; Panichelli said that , although his son is nearly 20 and a medical_student , they still frequently quote bits of Tintin dialogue to each other . &quot; It ' s a link for us , &quot; he said . Inevitably , specialty shops peddling Tintin playing_cards , mugs , socks , key chains and other souvenirs have sprung_up in London , Tokyo , Barcelona and Montreal . In Japan , Tintin has become the spokesman for the national airline and the national railway . But what has surprised many followers of comic_strips is that interest in the adventures seems to have increased rather than dropped_off in the decade since the death of his creator George Remi , who drew under the pen_name &quot; Herge &quot; ( pronounced Er-jay ) . Experts in the medium explain that Tintin ' s universal appeal stems in part from the simplicity of his features . &quot; His face is almost empty , so that almost anyone from any culture can associate with him , &quot; said Charles Dierick , director of the Belgian Center for Comic_Strips here . &quot; He ' s the best vehicle for a reader to project his emotions. &quot; But there is also a deceptive , understated quality to the Tintin stories . While Tintin may look_like he belongs on a_level with Archie , his adventures contain elements more evocative of Sherlock_Holmes , Mark Twain , Jules Verne , Alfred Hitchcock and Don Quixote . As &quot; Tintin , world reporter No . 1 , &quot; he escapes a Stalinist-era Soviet_Union , tackles Chicago mobsters in the early 1930s , battles drug_traffickers in China in the Sino-Japanese War and fights kidnapers of an Arab sheik in the Middle_East . It ' s a string of tales that portray the world between the two wars , yet at_the_same_time are timeless adventures . &quot; When we ask children today when they think Tintin lived , they always say ' now , ' &quot; said Philippe Goddin , secretary_general of the Herge Foundation here , which was established to protect the artist ' s works . In Herge ' s later books , Tintin gets involved in Cold_War mysteries , fights petty dictators in Latin_America , rescues an old friend in Tibet and even explores the moon -- always against great odds , always in the name of truth , justice and a greater good , always winning out_in the end . His supporting cast includes an absent-minded professor named Calculus , a crusty sea_captain called Haddock , twin detectives known as the Thompsons ( for comic relief ) and Snowy the talking dog . But aside from the lure of the characters , what really sets &quot; Tintin &quot; apart is the depth of the stories . In constructing dialogue , in his story content , and in his unusual attention to detail , Herge was simply different from most others of his craft . He was fascinated by the things that especially appeal_to young people , such_as uniforms , technology and all forms of transportation ; he concentrated_on each aspect of each cartoon frame . When Haddock receives a dressing-down from a Nepalese porter in &quot; Tintin in Tibet , &quot; the porter ' s words are written in accurate Nepali script . The uniforms of Japanese occupation troops in &quot; The Blue_Lotus &quot; are carefully drawn copies of originals , as are musical_instruments played by Peruvian Indians in &quot; Temple of the Sun. &quot; The stories themselves are so carefully constructed and open_to interpretation that they tend to be enjoyed as much by adults as by children . Dierick , for example , claims Tintin ' s Tibet adventure , which centers_on the search for an old friend in_trouble , is really an exploration of the theme of fidelity and , indirectly , of the breakup of Herge ' s first marriage . &quot; What ' s important about Tintin books is the drive behind the stories , &quot; Dierick said . &quot; His themes are universal. &quot; Frederic Soumois , whose doctoral thesis became one of the many books that attempt to analyze the &quot; Tintin phenomenon , &quot; considers the adventures a mixture of history and morality . &quot; Tintin is different from the superhero of American comics , &quot; Soumois said . &quot; His adventures are really moral lessons on freedom of choice , self-determination and the role of the individual in society. &quot; In Europe , teachers often used the colorfully illustrated adventures as reading aids . &quot; They connect word and image as well as anything going , &quot; said Dierick . Herge ' s &quot; Tintin &quot; was a hit virtually from the moment it first appeared in 1929 as a supplement to the Brussels weekly &quot; Twentieth Century. &quot; It was the same year that Tarzan and Buck Rogers began life as comic_strip characters in the United States , and the year after a young American cartoon artist named Walt Disney first introduced a character called Mickey_Mouse . Taking a lead from his American contemporaries , Herge became the first European cartoonist to use a balloon for dialogue ; his first adventure , &quot; Tintin in the Land of the Soviets , &quot; generated an immediate , avid following . The youthful reporter was traveling_to exotic , far-off places -- out_of_reach to normal people . When the publisher staged Tintin ' s mock return at the Brussels North Railroad_Station in 1930 , thousands came_out to greet him . Once completed , the serial was bound and sold as a book . Unlike Disney and other cartoonists , Herge never relinquished control of his creation to others . &quot; Tintin , that ' s me , &quot; he once said . When Herge died in 1983 , Tintin ' s adventures stopped too . Today , the artist ' s Brussels office at the Herge Foundation remains as it was , with a large , flat drawing table flanked by a model of Tintin ' s red-and-white checked moon rocket , the works of American artists Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein on two walls and a bookcase stuffed with volumes of translated Tintin adventures . And still his creation expands : The fall of communism has enabled Tintin to reach Eastern Europe . The adventures have already been translated into Russian , Polish , Hungarian , Slovak and Czech , Goddin said , and other Eastern languages are likely to follow soon . &quot; We are eager to remain active , &quot; he said . &quot; We want people to know about Herge ' s works. &quot;</TEXT>
