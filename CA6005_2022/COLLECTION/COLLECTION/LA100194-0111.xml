   <TEXT> Does your house smell like Mom ' s home cooking when all you did was clean the bathroom ? Like a bouquet of flowers because you sprayed for bugs ? Carpet deodorizers , air fresheners , toilet cleaners and bug spray have all been putting_on new airs lately . And while most consumers have become accustomed to Lemon Fresh Pledge and potpourri room deodorizers , many still doubt what their noses are telling them when they get_a_whiff of Vanilla Carpet Fresh and Country Fresh Raid . One need only tour the local supermarket to catch wind of the trend . Renuzit ' s Country Kitchen air freshener promises &quot; the charm of cinnamon and spice , &quot; as if Mom had just finished baking an apple_pie in the kitchen -- or the bath . Airwick has introduced a line of Air_Waves air fresheners in fragrances that conjure_up idyllic country settings : &quot; morning rain , &quot; &quot; cool cascade &quot; and &quot; wildberry knoll. &quot; Arm &amp; Hammer has a carpet deodorizer that ' s scented with something called &quot; vanilla meadows , &quot; so the whole house will smell good_enough to eat . Even pesticides come_out smelling like a rose . Hot Shot ' s roach and ant killer has a new &quot; fresh floral scent , &quot; while Raid has introduced an ant and roach killer that smells &quot; country fresh &quot; -- even while it ' s wiping_out colonies of country-bred invaders . Why are manufacturers of these chemicals encouraging homeowners to stop and smell the bug spray ? * Years ago the purpose of adding fragrance to household products was to mask or obliterate bad smells , says Avery Gilbert , a psychologist on the staff of Givaudan-Roure , a company that creates and produces fragrances in Teaneck , N.J. &quot; Once upon a time you just wanted the thing to work -- to kill bugs , if it was a bug killer , &quot; Gilbert says . Then product manufacturers caught_on to consumers ' love of potpourri . No longer were people simply stuffing a potpourri satchel in the back of a lingerie drawer . They were putting_out entire bowlfuls of dried rose petals and orange_peels to permeate their living quarters with scent . &quot; The potpourri was pleasant in itself . That got taken_up through the air-freshener market , &quot; Gilbert says . Soon came a wave of potpourri-scented air fresheners , window_cleaners , carpet deodorizers , furniture polish and toilet ducks . &quot; Now the emphasis is_on fragrancing the home , &quot; Gilbert says . &quot; They ' ve switched from coverage to mood-setting. &quot; From the woodsy , berry notes of potpourri , manufacturers have devised more sophisticated scents that lend themselves to attractive packaging and colorful ads . Who can say what a &quot; morning rain &quot; or a &quot; cool cascade &quot; really smells like ? But the names go nicely with pictures of rushing waterfalls and dew-covered fields . &quot; Now they create whole fragrance landscapes , &quot; Gilbert says . * Scents aren ' t created in a vacuum ; they reflect what ' s happening in society at the time they ' re made , says Annette Green , president of the national Fragrance Foundation , the industry ' s nonprofit educational organization in New York City . Many &quot; odorscapes , &quot; such_as Pledge ' s &quot; country woods &quot; furniture polish , are designed to make consumers feel the outdoors can be purchased in a can because nature and the environment have been shown to be popular concerns in the ' 90s . &quot; Now the trend is toward outdoor , fresh , clean fragrances , &quot; Green says . &quot; Consumers are in an environmental awareness mode . They ' re looking_for products that speak_of the environment. &quot; Manufacturers plumb the depth of their consumers ' psyches to come_up with fragrances they ' ll like , which explains why Givaudan-Roure employs a psychologist along with its team of perfumers . They want to know which fragrances will conjure_up positive images . Vanilla is being used in Carpet Fresh and other products because studies have shown it has a calming , soothing effect . &quot; It ' s connected to cooking , mother and home , &quot; Green says . &quot; It makes people feel comfortable. &quot; Comforting scents have grown stronger because people perceive the world as more threatening and stressful . &quot; The ' 80s wore us out_in many ways , including financially and sexually . People are just trying to turn_down the volume , &quot; Green says . &quot; There ' s a lot of fear on the streets . Home is our haven. &quot; that ' s why some air fresheners smell like cinnamon . &quot; What fragrance is more comforting than cinnamon and spice ? It conjures_up images of home , Thanksgiving and Christmas , &quot; Green says . People find comfort in food , so Wizard now makes an air freshener that smells like &quot; woodland fruits , &quot; and Glade makes one in &quot; fresh berries. &quot; &quot; Why fresh berries ? It ' s safe ; it ' s yummy , and there aren ' t a lot of people who hate berries , &quot; Gilbert says . &quot; On the other hand , you ' re not going_to find an air freshener that smells like broccoli. &quot; * Sometimes manufacturers want their products to stink . &quot; In some cases you need to let some of the malodor of a product come_through so it signals it ' s working , &quot; says Lisa Lewis , creative fragrance director of Givaudan-Roure . A foul smell can also keep people from overexposing themselves to potentially harmful substances such_as bleach or powerful insecticides . &quot; You don ' t want them inhaling something if it could be detrimental to their health , &quot; Lewis says . On the other hand , a pleasant scent can reassure consumers that a product such_as Black_Flag ( now available in pine or lavender ) won ' t do to them what it does to ants and roaches . &quot; I just bought a scented insecticide . I always had the feeling if they smelled bad , they must be dangerous , &quot; Green says . &quot; This is one way to get_across the idea that these particular insecticides are safer. &quot; * While adding scent to a product improves its attraction to consumers , there are some cleaners , detergents and other products that people would rather not smell . Although such products are advertised as fragrance-free , if they were truly unscented consumers would probably turn_up their noses at them . The reason : Without ingredients that cover_up their natural scents , many products smell rotten . &quot; When something ' s fragrance-free , it means it doesn ' t stink . Some scents need to be covered , &quot; Gilbert says . &quot; Soap doesn ' t smell so good by itself . If you put your face in a bowl of soap chips that aren ' t scented , you ' ll ask_for the perfume back pretty quick. &quot; * HEALTHY INTEREST : Feeling clean and green ?
