   <HEADLINE> LIFTING THE EMBARGO IS A TRAGIC MISTAKE ; VIETNAM : ENDING SANCTIONS WITHOUT REAL RESULTS ON MIAS MAKES US TOTALLY RELIANT ON HANOI ' S ' GOODWILL. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The President ' s announcement Thursday that he is lifting the trade_embargo on Vietnam and establishing a political liaison office in Hanoi was done_in the name of the prisoner-of-war , missing-in-action issue , but was , in reality , an attempt to reconcile a self-created dilemma of pledging principle to the issue with &quot; a wink and a nod. &quot; At the heart of this dilemma is Hanoi ' s continuing failure to cooperate fully with U.S. POW / MIA investigators . Clinton has made several strong statements on U.S. policy toward Vietnam . The most important is a requirement that Hanoi make tangible progress in accounting_for missing Americans before the Administration moves forward on the trade_embargo . Last summer , the President outlined four criteria for judging the seriousness of Vietnam ' s cooperation . These included repatriation of remains , provision of archival materials related to missing Americans , resolution of last-known-alive discrepancy cases and cooperation on resolving Laotian POW / MIA cases . No objective and informed observer can honestly attest that any of these criteria have been met . Administration officials gave the Vietnamese government a list of 84 cases that they expected help on before they could recommend lifting the trade_embargo . In each , U.S. officials believe that persuasive evidence exists that Hanoi knows what happened to the men . Accounting for these Americans would provide a concrete demonstration of Vietnam ' s willingness to address some of the President ' s stated concerns . It would also serve as a promissory_note by the Vietnamese to proceed with the hundreds of cases beyond the 84 that they could easily resolve . Recent Administration statements suggest that Vietnam has made measurable progress in each of the specific areas . Despite the Administration ' s assertions , Hanoi ' s record of stonewalling and cynical manipulation for more_than 20 years cannot be ignored . It is demonstrated in the thousands of formerly classified documents on file at the National Archives . One finds in these files that the cooperation forced on the Vietnamese in recent years -- including their handing_over internal documents and photographs -- instead of clearing the record , demonstrates persuasively that they are still holding_back evidence on hundreds more Americans . The Vietnamese went_to great lengths to keep track of enemy personnel who came under their control , alive or dead . All units had been instructed on procedures to follow in the event they killed or captured an American -- including immediate notification to higher headquarters . At aircraft crash sites , for example , teams carefully collected any artifacts . Items were catalogued , photographed and inspected for intelligence value . In some instances , Russian and Chinese intelligence specialists were also allowed access to the sites . Recovered materials were sent to regional storage sites or to Hanoi . Most of this material is still being held . Dead Americans were similarly photographed and catalogued . Remains were often buried immediately at crash sites and locations of the graves recorded . A year or more later , teams recovered the remains , preserved them as they did for their own and reburied or stored them above ground in designated locations . Throughout this process , detailed records were kept . Although over the years Hanoi has returned some of these remains , U.S. intelligence estimates that the Vietnamese could readily provide hundreds more . Cooperation is more_than just a humanitarian gesture on Vietnam ' s part ; it is a crucial step_in resolving the question of Americans who may still be in Indochina -- the discrepancy cases . Unless U.S. officials can document more accurately who died , they cannot determine who may have survived but did not return . Today , Vietnamese officials continue to hold_back key documents they know are crucial to the accounting process , while providing a large volume of inconsequential materials to create the impression of cooperation and progress . Now the same officials , using words strikingly similar to those they have used for two decades , are again claiming that they hold no more American remains . As with the documents , these denials ring hollow . Vietnamese records and photographs provided since 1992 back_up previous intelligence and diplomatic admissions that they continue to hold hundreds of remains , or can provide persuasive explanations why some remains may_not be available . Some in the Administration , apparently in an attempt to demonstrate progress , cite the repatriation of 67 individual remains this year as the third-highest since the end of the war . What they are not saying is that for the most part , these are fragmentary remains turned_over by villagers and fragments from crash sites , some of which show previous excavation activity by Vietnam . Historically , only 10 % to 20 % of such remains are American . And it is a new process of counting . To the best of our knowledge , Vietnam has not provided a single set of remains from the list of 84 MIAs given to them months ago . Until they do , it is not credible to assert that the President ' s criteria on the repatriation of remains has been met . While the Vietnamese have provided more_than 21 # 000 documents , photos and artifacts since 1992 , only 1 % has pertained to missing Americans . The bulk of the information is_on Americans returned from captivity in 1973 or previously accounted_for during the war or subsequent repatriation . We should of course give Hanoi credit for the materials provided thus far , but volume can never substitute for quality . On Laos , Vietnamese documents and information also hold the key , and they have not yet been provided . In one year , the Clinton_Administration has moved further and faster toward meeting Vietnam ' s stated humanitarian , economic and political objectives and needs , provided more subsidies to Vietnamese officials for POW / MIA activities and given them more public praise on this issue than any preceding administration . Unfortunately , it has not persuaded Hanoi to share with us the vital information we know they still hold . At the same time they were praising the Vietnamese , U.S. officials removed the National League of Families from the interagency process and abolished the POW / MIA interagency group . They have refused to provide the league with timely reports on joint activities or evaluations , even unclassified ones . More important , the Administration also eliminated league participation in negotiations in Hanoi . League participation in interagency deliberations was vitally important because of its members ' expertise , and their interaction with the Vietnamese was crucial in demonstrating our seriousness and solidarity in negotiations . We believe that lifting the trade_embargo and normalizing relations with Vietnam would be in the U.S. and Asian regional interest , and might have helped provide additional information on the POW / MIA issue , if serious negotiations had followed the President ' s criteria . But lifting the trade_embargo now without achieving real results is a tragic mistake . It will dash the hopes of the families who have been waiting so_long for answers , place the Administration in the position of relying solely on Hanoi ' s &quot; goodwill &quot; and risk eroding further the American peoples ' trust in government . What we need from our officials now is honesty , candor and negotiations , not hype . The success or failure of Clinton ' s decision will be easy to measure , based on the response from Hanoi on the President ' s own POW / MIA criteria .</TEXT>
