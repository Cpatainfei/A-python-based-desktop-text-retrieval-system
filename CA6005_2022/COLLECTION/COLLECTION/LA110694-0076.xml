   <HEADLINE> NEO-NAZI MIGRATION TO DENMARK FROM GERMANY STIRS ANGER , PROTESTS ; EUROPE : REVELATIONS ABOUT NEWCOMERS EXPOSE OLD WOUNDS DATING_BACK TO WORLD WAR II , WHEN THE GERMAN ARMY OCCUPIED THE COUNTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In his haven across the Flensborg fiord from Germany , Thies Christophersen has been quietly publishing magazines and books for years denying that the Holocaust ever happened . The presence of the former German SS officer was long ignored by other residents of Kollund , a pleasant town filled with nearly identical bungalows and colorful front gardens . But revelations about his international propaganda network and efforts by other German neo-Nazis to settle in Denmark exposed old wounds dating_back to World_War_II , when the German army occupied the country . Now , residents want Christophersen expelled to Germany . Protesters have staged at least two violent rallies to demand that Denmark tighten its liberal press freedoms law , a backlash that has put the government in the position of defending the right of Nazis to speak out . &quot; We ' ve tolerated ( Christophersen ) because he was an old_man and was alone . Now others are coming , &quot; said Karen Heesch , a retiree in Kollund , a town of 1 # 500 people a_few minutes north of the German border . Christophersen came_to Denmark to avoid charges in Germany of incitement to violence and racial hatred in 1986 . Denmark has turned_down Germany ' s requests to extradite Christophersen because he holds a Danish residency permit . His work is protected by Denmark ' s press law . Attention focused_on Christophersen after another immigrant Nazi had troubles . In mid-September , Meinolf Schoenborn , who heads Germany ' s banned Nationalist Front , fled from his home_in the southern Danish village of Kvaers after Danes attacked his house . Press reports said Schoenborn had moved to Denmark with plans to set_up a training camp for right-wing activists . &quot; What happened in Kvaers sent a shock_wave through the country , &quot; said Peter Rasmussen , who owns a bar in Graasten , a mile from Kvaers . He predicted that if Christophersen stays and the press law is not changed , &quot; protests will multiply and may get_out of control. &quot; Two weeks after Schoenborn was driven from his home , about 2 # 000 people protested outside Christophersen ' s house five miles from Kvaers . The 76-year-old German has told reporters he could no longer stand the pressure and would surrender to German authorities . But Danes say Christophersen is bluffing . &quot; He can ' t leave . He ' s the spider in the center of an international web , &quot; said Siegfried Matlock , editor in chief of Der Nordschleswiger , a German-language newspaper in Denmark . In recent years , Christophersen has held meetings with leading European right-wing figures . The Copenhagen newspaper Det Fri Aktuelt said he printed the neo-Nazi publication Liberty_Bells for distribution in the United States . He prints a quarterly called Die Bauernschaft , which means &quot; the peasantry &quot; in German . Under the name Nordwind Publishing , he has produced his own book , &quot; The Auschwitz Lie , &quot; and others denying that Germany exterminated millions of Jews during World_War_II . Christophersen , who says he was a guard at the Auschwitz concentration_camp during the war , produces the publications from a small , yellow-brick house with shutters , boarded basement windows and a security camera to monitor surroundings . The house is just four miles from the Froslev camp , the German-run prison in Denmark during World_War_II . When Schoenborn bought his house in Kvaers , he told the seller , Karsten Pedersen , he was setting_up a business to sell toys . &quot; Strange toys , indeed , &quot; said Pedersen , a car mechanic who says he did not know the buyer ' s identity &quot; until it was too late. &quot; After Schoenborn fled the house , T-shirts and stickers emblazoned with swastikas and other Third_Reich emblems were found inside along with neo-Nazi literature . Today , the house is sprayed-painted with anti-Nazi slogans and the surroundings are littered with barbed wire , broken glass and broken poles . Schoenborn ' s whereabouts are not known . Other neo-Nazis have tried to make a home_in Denmark . &quot; In one case , the seller retracted his offer when he discovered who was buying_it , &quot; Deputy Police_Chief Bent Rungstrom said , refusing to identify either party . The government has been reluctant to take harsh action . Legislators have promised to review the law on racism , but stress that freedom_of_speech is sacrosanct in Denmark . Germany repeatedly has asked its northern neighbor to tighten its legislation , saying neo-Nazis produce hate propaganda in Denmark and then export it to Germany and other countries . Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal appealed_to Danish consciences , recalling how Danes smuggled 7 # 000 Jews to neutral Sweden in 1943 after learning they were to be sent to concentration_camps by the German occupiers . &quot; These neo-Nazis do things which are against the Danish people ' s sentiments , &quot; Wiesenthal told Danish news media .</TEXT>
