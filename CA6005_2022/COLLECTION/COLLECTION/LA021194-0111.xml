   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : SARAJEVO ' S TROUBLES MAKE ANY OTHER STORY LOOK SILLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Six chilling days ago , mortar shells tore through Sarajevo ' s teeming marketplace , killing scores , scaring thousands half to death . On Tuesday , to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the opening of the Winter_Olympics in what once was a city of gaiety , tranquillity and charm , hundreds of sympathizers stood together silently in quaint and quiet little Lillehammer , at the steps outside the town_hall . In a demonstration of solidarity with Sarajevo ' s living and dead , they struck matches to illuminate 200 candles , arranged in five circles like Olympic rings . The candles continue burning here , day and night . While the siege of Sarajevo raged and government officials of the United States were weighing whether to intervene , Juan Antonio Samaranch , the president of the International Olympic Committee , made a public plea : &quot; Please stop the fighting . Please stop the killing . Please drop your guns . We shall not give_up our efforts to contribute , as it is stipulated in our charter , to building a more peaceful and better world. &quot; And all_the while , 14 terrified athletes , all skiers and sledders , were making a daring escape through Bosnia-Herzegovina ' s bloody snow . I think_of these people and I cannot take the plight of Tonya Harding or Nancy Kerrigan very seriously . I think_of these people and I think_back to the Sarajevo that I found so enchanting 10 years ago , and what remains of it . I think_of these people and I must redefine my ideas of what constitutes a crisis in the life of an Olympian , of what counts as actual courage . Somewhere in another far-off hemisphere , there are Americans distressed by the condition of a figure skater ' s bruised kneecap and by the bitter dispute over whether another figure skater was culpable for this vicious &quot; attack. &quot; In the capital city of the former Yugoslavia , there are athletes whose rivals and relatives are fighting for their lives , athletes who could only sigh and fantasize that their troubles were no more disturbing than Kerrigan ' s or Harding ' s . These are individuals who have shared little else in recent days but a destination and a determination to get there in one piece . A couple of them took refuge in tanks . Others traveled through the war-ravaged Bosnian countryside by car , working their way toward the border , looking anxiously over their shoulders around every turn . The airport at Tuzla was closed . The one at Sarajevo sat uncomfortably in the line_of_fire of heavily armed Serbs in the_hills , of cannons and mobile mortars and hundreds of pieces of artillery . So no , air_travel was not an acceptable risk . These athletes had to find some_other safe passage to the Olympic Games . In age they ranged from Zdravko Stojnic , a bobsledder of 36 , to Sakib Birdio , a cross-country skier of 15 . Three were women . There was Verona Marjanovic , 20 , a luger who loved heavy-metal music and longed to be able to listen to some in peace . There was Samira Radaca , 21 , who missed the golden mornings in Pale , Yugoslavia , when she could cross-country ski along roads without seeing armed soldiers , and Ariana Boras , 17 , who was born in Konjic and became a skillful Alpine skier in the actual Alps . Her brother , Igor Boras , had his 26th birthday Tuesday . He spent it successfully escaping Sarajevo and reaching his ultimate destination of Norway , where he will be a member of a bobsled team that will represent Bosnia-Herzegovina in these XVII Winter_Olympics . He and his brother bobsledders made_it safely to Lillehammer , leaving only one important piece of equipment behind . All they need now is a sled . There is a growing commitment here in Lillehammer to help these people and those they left_behind , in any way possible . Funds are being raised and donations accepted by a volunteer Olympic aid committee , not only for Bosnians but for victims of carnage in Guatemala , Lebanon and Afghanistan as well . About 2 # 000 people have signed a document that has been designated as &quot; a protocol of solidarity , &quot; among them the mayor and members of the city_council of Lillehammer , officials of their Olympic committee here and representatives of the Norwegian Church . This scroll will be presented to the mayor of Sarajevo when he arrives here next week . The Bosnian athletes themselves were asked to put their signatures to it , and gladly obliged . Samaranch , the IOC chief , found himself thinking_back wistfully to the Sarajevo he had visited in 1984 . It was his first Olympic Games as their president . He said , &quot; Ten years ago , the youth of the world was gathered there to celebrate in a spirit of friendship , solidarity , fair play and the commitment of peace. &quot; I remember . I remember shy and smiling schoolgirls in lederhosen carrying trays of plum brandy , greeting travelers in Zagreb on their way to the Games . I remember Gypsies serenading patrons of a hilltop restaurant , strolling with accordions and mandolins , flirting_with the women . I remember plumes of cigarette smoke , floating above the heads of pedestrians as though from locomotives , and fresh oxygen in the mountains , exhilarating and pure . I remember being behind a rope at the finish_line when skier Bill Johnson came rocketing down the_hill , and sitting beside Pat Lafontaine ' s parents as their son stick-handled a puck , and feeling goose bumps while the limbs of Christopher Dean and Jayne Torvill intertwined during an erotic interpretation of Ravel ' s &quot; Bolero &quot; on ice . And I remember a party in the streets when a slalom skier named Jure Franko took second place , when around his neck was draped the only Winter Olympic medal that any Yugoslav had ever won . They put his face on a postage_stamp for doing that . They danced and drank and laughed long into the Yugoslavian night . And now their country isn ' t even there any more . Tonya Harding doesn ' t have trouble . Nancy Kerrigan doesn ' t have trouble . These people have trouble .</TEXT>
