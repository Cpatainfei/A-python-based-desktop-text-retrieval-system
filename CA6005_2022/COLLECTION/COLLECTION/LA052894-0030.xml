   <HEADLINE> GEORGE BALL ; FOUGHT VIETNAM POLICY UNDER KENNEDY , LBJ</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> George Ball , whose tenure as undersecretary of state in the John F . Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson administrations was marked by his outspoken but unsuccessful arguments against expansion of the Vietnam_War , is dead . Ball ' s personal assistant , Karen Vaseduva , said he died at New York Hospital on Thursday evening . He had been admitted Wednesday and doctors discovered that he was suffering from terminal abdominal cancer , she said . &quot; He wasn ' t the type to complain . The cancer was in an advanced stage and he never said a word to anyone , &quot; she said . &quot; We feel his loss very deeply. &quot; He was 84 and lived_in Princeton , N.J. Ball often found himself the lone voice protesting U.S. military involvement in Vietnam . As early as 1961 , he advised Kennedy not to send 15 # 000 American troops to Vietnam , saying 300 # 000 more men would have to be dispatched later to get them out . His advice was rejected but turned_out to be prescient . Ball , who was seen by President Johnson as a kind of anti-war &quot; devil ' s advocate &quot; in the Administration , held_on to the No . 2 job at the State_Department from 1961 until he resigned in frustration in 1966 . Despite their differences , the highly respected international and corporate lawyer returned to government service in 1968 , when Johnson named him ambassador to the United Nations . Johnson left_office the next year and Ball returned to private banking . He was senior managing director of Lehman Brothers until his retirement in 1982 . In his memoirs , &quot; The Past Has Another Pattern , &quot; published in 1982 , Ball said that U.S. intervention in Vietnam had been a &quot; defeat for our political authority and moral influence abroad and for our sense of mission and cohesion at home. &quot; Ball also became a center of controversy because of his strongly voiced view that U.S. Middle_East policy in the 1970s and early ' 80s was tilted too_much in favor of Israel and against the Arabs . A leading U.S. pro-Israel lobbying organization included Ball in 1983 on a list of 21 groups and 39 individuals it said were &quot; active in the effort to weaken bonds between the United States and Israel. &quot; Ball also was a sharp critic of President Richard Nixon , whom he admitted disliking intensely . He accused Nixon of compounding all_of Johnson ' s mistakes in Vietnam and adding many of_his_own , thus intensifying the American involvement . Ball , born in Des Moines , Iowa , began his career in public_service in the Treasury_Department after graduating from Northwestern University in 1933 . He spent seven years practicing law in Chicago before joining the World_War_II Office of Lend-Lease Administration in 1942 . He also directed the Strategic Bombing Survey , ordered by President Franklin D . Roosevelt to assess the effects of the Allied air offensive on Germany . After the war , Ball was an adviser to Jean Monnet in negotiations that led to creation of the European Coal and Steel Community and , later , the European Common_Market . Ball worked as a lawyer in Washington from 1946 until 1961 , when he was named by President Kennedy as undersecretary of state for economic affairs . Less than a year later he became undersecretary of state , the second-highest position in the department . Among his other books was &quot; The Passionate Attachment , &quot; published in 1992 , about U.S.-Israel relations . Looking_back at the Vietnam years , Ball testified to a House panel in 1985 that both Johnson and Nixon said they did not want to be the first American President to lose a war . &quot; Our honor was not served by the unedifying spectacle of the world ' s most powerful nation trying to beat to death a small , poor , weak adversary , using napalm and defoliants and killing thousands of civilians in a war we could not win , &quot; Ball testified . &quot; Our honor would have been far better preserved had we , by stopping the killing , demonstrated a clear sense of compassion , perspective , priority and balance , &quot; he said . In his last years , Ball continued to pursue his interests , including history and economics . Vaseduva , Ball ' s assistant , also said he was beginning to plan his next book . It was going_to be &quot; about the state of the world , the information superhighway and other modern conveniences or inconveniences , and he jokingly referred to it as ' a book of prejudices , ' &quot; she said . He is survived by two sons , John and Douglas , and two grandchildren . His wife died in 1993 .</TEXT>
