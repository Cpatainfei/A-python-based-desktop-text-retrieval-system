   <HEADLINE> DAMAGE TO COLISEUM CLOUDS FOOTBALL_SEASON ; QUAKE : SOME FEAR STADIUM MAY HAVE TO BE TORN DOWN . A REPORT ON ITS STATUS IS EXPECTED IN TWO WEEKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Earthquake damage to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is so extensive that the historic stadium might not be repaired in time for next fall ' s football_season , officials said Monday . One Coliseum aide said that a structural engineer ' s report is pending , but there is a possibility it might have to be demolished and rebuilt . In any event , the officials now believe that the costs of reopening the stadium could vastly exceed the estimate of $ 35 million made last week . Coliseum officials have not foreclosed the possibility of repairing and reopening the facility -- which was red-tagged Sunday by city building inspectors -- in time for the next football_season , but they concede that time is short , and that work is contingent_on a quick decision by federal authorities to assume most of the funding . A spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Monday that consideration of Coliseum aid could take time , and added that earthquake-damaged schools would have a higher priority . Complicating the Coliseum ' s future were reports Monday in Eastern publications that the Raiders have been exploring a move from Los Angeles to either Hartford or Baltimore . Attendance at Raiders games in the recently completed season was often disappointing even though the stadium was renovated to make_it more suitable for viewing football . Hoping to bring an NFL franchise back to Baltimore , officials in Maryland have courted the Rams as well as the Raiders . Members of the Maryland Stadium Authority met in New York City on Jan . 20 with John Shaw , Rams executive_vice_president . Shaw was asked to provide &quot; a letter of interest &quot; to satisfy local politicians that the Rams were seriously considering a move from Anaheim Stadium . But a source close to the Rams said it was unlikely that the club would provide the letter because it might limit the team ' s negotiating position as they consider whether to leave Anaheim . The Rams notified the city of Anaheim last month of their intention to invoke the escape clause in their Anaheim Stadium lease , but not until May 3 . Under terms of the clause , the Rams would have to remain a tenant of the stadium for 15 months , or through the 1994 season . With the announcement , the Rams became a target for not only Baltimore , but a number of other cities who are anxious to attract an NFL team such_as St . Louis ; Memphis , Tenn. ; Hartford , Ct. ; Sacramento and Pasadena . Meanwhile , Los Angeles officials continued assessing the earthquake damage at the Coliseum . During a tour of the stadium Monday , Don C . Webb , the Coliseum Commission ' s project director for recent renovations of the facility , said a fairly complete report from structural engineers is expected in two weeks . &quot; A ( crack ) runs_through the concourse , through the tunnels and into the base of the foundation , &quot; Webb said . &quot; What we don ' t see is extremely important . The question is whether this ( facility ) can be fixed , or whether it will have to be demolished. &quot; But the principal structural engineer retained to assess the damage said he believes that demolition will not be necessary . Nahih Youssef said , &quot; Technically , the Coliseum still has capacity to withstand earthquakes . There is a lot of damage , but it is not all to the lateral earthquake resistance system of the building . There is some residual strength and we can build_on that . &quot; There is a separation of the outer Coliseum wall from the superstructure , &quot; Youssef said . &quot; The outer structure was displaced differently from the inner side , where the seating is located . . . . But the structural integrity may_not have been fatally compromised. &quot; Nonetheless , Youssef said , Saturday ' s magnitude 5.0 aftershock caused additional damage at the Coliseum , and the $ 35-million estimate of damage made last week is too low . &quot; Repairs will take six months to a year , &quot; once they begin , Youssef said . Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana , who also toured the facility and has an engineering degree , said he believes the lower levels of the Coliseum are_on &quot; solid_ground &quot; and that most of the damage is confined to the &quot; higher tier &quot; at the concourse , or upper concessions and restroom level , and above . &quot; The higher tier will have to be taken_down and replaced , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s going_to be very expensive . But I think repairs are feasible , and we are applying to FEMA for funding. &quot; The incoming Coliseum Commission president , County Supervisors Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke , said she had been informed &quot; it would not necessarily be required to remove the entire upper tier. &quot; The Coliseum has no earthquake insurance , officials said , and no appreciable funds in reserve for repairs . Jay Hagerman , the Coliseum ' s general_manager who was present for Monday ' s tour , declared that everything is contingent_on what the structural engineer reports about the severity of the damage . As the tour drew to a close , Webb , Hagerman and Margaret Farnum , executive_secretary to the Coliseum Commission , noticed for the first time that the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety had red-tagged the Coliseum . A sign posted on the outer fence at the peristyle end declared that it was unsafe to enter . The sign said it had been posted at 11:30 a.m. Sunday . Monday , the city ' s chief building inspector , Russell Lane , said he took a team to the Coliseum on Sunday , but they were unable to enter the locked facility . He said the judgment had been made to red tag the building based on cracks visible from the outside , and that city inspectors had yet to observe the inside . Inside , the principal damage displayed Monday by Webb and Hagerman was a deep crack running the entire length of the upper level concourse , which the two officials said showed how the Coliseum ' s outer wall had separated from the inner seating structure . Gaps could be seen between sections of seating , and chunks of fallen concrete littered parts of the concourse . In addition , the lower part of the stadium seating , built_in the early 1920s , had sunk away several inches from the upper section , which was added for the 1932 Olympics . There was also serious cracking of some pillars and beams in the Peristyle end of the stadium -- the only facility in the world to have hosted two of the modern Olympic Games , and the site of a World_Series and many important political and entertainment events . &quot; One problem we have is that different parts of the stadium moved_in different directions , &quot; Webb said . Terry Hamlin , a spokesman for FEMA , stressed that fast action is necessary if there is to be any chance of getting the facility ready for next fall ' s football games by the Los Angeles Raiders professional franchise and USC . A USC spokesman said Monday the school will await the engineer ' s report before commenting . The Raiders did not return calls_for comment . * RELATED STORIES : A16 , D1</TEXT>
