   <HEADLINE> THE NBA / MARK HEISLER ; THERE WAS NO MAGIC FOR SOME BAD TEAMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Michael Jordan left , Magic Johnson returned but only for a month , and scoring fell_off five points a team or 10 a game . There were no great teams but lots of awful ones . On the bright_side , TV ratings stayed_up . If people sat still for this season , the future ' s so bright NBA execs have to wear shades Where did all these skunks come from ? The Dallas Mavericks are about to become the first_team to post consecutive 70-loss seasons . Only two other teams had lost 70 games once , the 9-73 Philadelphia 76ers in 1973 and the 12-70 Clippers in 1987 . Five teams won ' t hit . 300 , which may be great in baseball but is only 25-57 in an NBA season . Three more won ' t win 30 games , which makes eight teams -- almost a third of the NBA -- a competitive write-off . This and everything else including the killing of Cock Robin is usually blamed on expansion , but only one of these eight slugs joined the league in the expansion classes of 1988 and 1989 . The rest bumbled their way to the bottom , some on age , most on merit . Starting from the bottom : Mavericks -- When the owner starts getting_rid_of everyone so he can bring_back his original coach , who already has proven to be a pain there and everywhere he went thereafter , you glimpse the dimensions of the problem . that ' s just what ' s happening in Big D where Donald Carter , the well-meaning-but-a-tad-confused owner , sacked personnel director Rick Sund , booted General_Manager Norm Sonju upstairs , is expected to ax all-world-disaster Coach Quinn Buckner . . . and wants to bring_back Dick Motta . Motta an old-school , bad-tempered tyrant who couldn ' t handle young players 10 years ago when they weren ' t half the head cases they are now , doesn ' t want to be the new general_manager but may consider coaching . Milwaukee Bucks -- They outsmarted people with an aging roster for years , then fell like a dead tree in a hurricane . Mike Dunleavy , who has the brains and the necessary long-term deal , backed_up the truck but he ' s just starting . Minnesota Timberwolves -- Mismanagement clinic , featuring woolly choices in coaches , starting with strung-out Bill Musselman , leading to Mr. Nice Guy , Sidney Lowe , whom temperamental young stars Christian Laettner and Isaiah Rider , trample daily . Owners Marv Wolfensen and Harvey Ratner incurred a $ 75-million cost_overrun on a $ 50-million arena -- maybe they didn ' t need that health club ? -- making the final tab $ 125 mil and a debt that has them threatening to move . Commissioner David Stern is trying to keep it together but everyone in the Twin Cities has had a bellyful of the T-Wolves . Detroit Pistons -- Marketing skill kept people coming and they just can ' t bear to actually tear it down and rebuild . So they ' ll be down that much longer . With Isiah Thomas moving upstairs , maybe they could make Bill Laimbeer coach as a public relations move . Washington Bullets -- If it wasn ' t for bad_luck , they would n ' t have any luck at all . Despite five straight lottery appearances , they haven ' t drafted better than fifth . The last time they were in the top three was 1968 , when they took Wes Unseld , now the coach who ' s about to be booted upstairs . 76ers -- Years of owner Harold Katz ' s madcap deals and drafts -- remember Kenny Payne over Vlade Divac ? -- cost them players like Brad Daugherty and Charles Barkley and cast them into the lottery until 1995 , at least . Sacramento Kings -- Should they have drafted Pervis Ellison ? Should they have traded Ellison ? Should they have drafted Dikembe Mutombo ? What ever happened to Walt Williams ? When are they going_to get a break ? Clippers -- Another lost season . This year ' s team should have gone 41-41 by mistake . It might at least have finished strong but instead quit dead in its tracks . Management bought another two years by trading Danny Manning for 34-year-old Dominique Wilkins but even if ' Nique and Ron Harper sign , is this a playoff team ? Which of the present eight in the West can they beat_out ? What happens in two years ? Of such vision are losers made . I ' D LIKE TO NOMINATE . . . ME ! Mutombo speaks five languages but the Nugget center must have missed a word or two of English , like , modesty . Since he plays in the NBA where the rule is , &quot; I ' d be more modest if I wasn ' t so great , &quot; we ' ll forgive him this one . Reward . This is something one earns with superior performance , rather than by asking_for_it . Campaign . This is a process through which one persuades others with logic and sentiment , rather than by threatening them . Mutombo , an otherwise nice young_man , now refers to himself as &quot; a great defensive player &quot; and demands to be enshrined as the NBA ' s defender of the year . He leads the league in blocks , is praised by rival coaches such_as Seattle ' s George Karl ( &quot; He must block seven a game against us &quot; ) and even endorsed by a competitor , Hakeem Olajuwon ( &quot; He ' s got my vote. &quot; ) To Mutombo , that makes_it unanimous . &quot; I think there is no doubt in my mind , I have to win that thing , &quot; he said . &quot; I deserve it . If I don ' t get_it , I will tell the league to kiss my rear_end . I will tell the media and the press . I don ' t know what else should I do to tell them I deserve the reward. &quot; I can ' t think_of anything . HE OBVIOUSLY FEELS ANOTHER BOOK COMING Pat Riley ' s Knicks continue to swing from naught to juggernaut , losing eight of 12 , winning 15 in a row , losing four of five . Riley says it ' s that old menmotum . &quot; You won ' t find it in your dictionary , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s the reverse of momentum . You can never feel when menmotum will grab you around the throat because if just keeps subtly cropping_up . &quot; In the last few games we ' d won , we hadn ' t played as well as we could . When you tell guys they ' re doing something wrong while they ' re winning , they roll their eyes . But when you lose , they listen. &quot; For those who insist on explanations using words found in the dictionary , try this : The Knicks overachieved for a month with a fantastic defensive effort and a weak schedule . ( NBA streaks usually start with an opportunity granted by the schedule to build momentum. ) Upon returning to earth , they missed the injured John Starks . How would a team averaging 96 points not miss a 19-point scorer ? Starks ' rehab is ahead of schedule and he ' ll be back by the playoffs . Meanwhile , the Knicks and Atlanta Hawks face_off for best record in the East Tuesday in the Garden . WAITING FOR MAGIC ( ONE MORE TIME ) One step_up . One step back . We ' re doing the Magic Mambo . OK , so it was tough making_up his mind . OK , so he passed_out different hints different days , the kind of thing that can drive a general_manager to distraction . I think it ' s nice Johnson gives you a straight answer , even if he has a different answer to the same question a day later . He didn ' t ask to coach the Lakers . They asked him , after which he showed why it was a good idea , no matter how it turns_out . that ' s how it is with big guys , they have options . If the Lakers pursue Rick Pitino , he isn ' t going_to say , &quot; Really ? Me ? I ' ll be right out ! &quot; He ' ll say &quot; I ' ve got the Hornets on the other line . How about 10 years at $ 25 million and a say in personnel ? &quot; FACES AND FIGURES OK , it was me : Ken Norman , who left the Clippers as a free_agent , was so hated in Milwaukee , he tried to talk the Clippers into dealing for him . &quot; I ' m a much better player than I displayed and I ' m a much better leader than I displayed . I ' m somewhat embarrassed about the season . In fact , it ' s the biggest disapppointment in my life , the way the season has gone_for me. &quot; . . . Orlando Magic players donned special T-shirts and did what Shaquille O ' Neal called &quot; the young guns ' tribal dance &quot; to celebrate making the playoffs for the first time . Said Jeff Turner , &quot; The tribal dance was my signal to leave. &quot; Magic players then carried Coach Brian Hill off the floor . Said Dennis Scott , &quot; We did that for B . You can open the paper and see where Don Nelson or some coach with a prestigious name should be our coach but we know Brian is the only coach for us. &quot; Magic Johnson on Chris Webber , whom he befriended when Webber was an eighth grader : &quot; The players are so different now . I was just hearing the other day Chris Webber was complaining about Don Nelson . I was thinking to myself , ' What do you want ? ' I ' ve always thought_of Don Nelson as a player ' s coach . He lets you run . He lets you shoot . What more do you want ? And Nellie ' s a good_guy , too . I just don ' t understand. &quot; Webber then went_for 25 points , 10 rebounds and nine assists against the Lakers , proving that while youth may be inscrutable , it must also be served . NBA types are advising Purdue ' s Glenn Robinson to declare for the draft -- whether he leaves school or not . He ' s guaranteed to be the top pick this year . Next year , he could conceivably go No . 2 , behind Rasheed Wallace , or could get hurt and lose some value . . . . Ricky Pierce , the closest thing the Seattle SuperSonics have to a go-to guy , is back after having a spur shaved off the top of his left foot . However , Gary Payton and Kendall Gill blossomed with additional minutes and Coach George Karl must now find time for four guards . . . . Coach Phil Jackson admitted he ' d thought his Chicago Bulls would win 49 games this season . With a 4-1 finish , they will equal last season ' s 57 . Askia Jones of Kansas State , the son of former 76er Wali Jones , was the MVP at the Portsmouth , Va. , tournament , the first of the pre-draft camps . The rest of the all-tourney team : Melvin Booker , Missouri ; Lawrence Funderburke , Ohio State ; Brooks Thompson , Oklahoma State , Dickey Simpkins , Providence ; Travis Ford , Kentucky ; Kendrick Warren , Virginia Commonwealth . Portsmouth is for relative unknowns and leads to invitations to the Phoenix camp in June . Most lottery picks won ' t attend any camp until the Chicago camp where they will only allow themselves to be measured and weighed . Minnesota broadcaster Kevin McHale , a passionate Democrat , on turning_down an invitation to meet President Bill_Clinton : &quot; I ' ve had my experience with those Presidential things . We ( the Boston Celtics ) went_to the White_House after we won in 1984 . It was about 150 degrees in the Rose_Garden . ( Ronald ) Reagan came_out and he mumbled something . Then he butchered ( John ) Havlicek ' s name . That was it for me. &quot;</TEXT>
