   <TEXT> It is an unlikely setting for a salon . In the electronics section of the Broadway department_store in the Crenshaw-Baldwin Hills Plaza , a small group of African American men and women stand transfixed by a wall of murmuring televisions . More_than two_dozen images moving_in unison display a larger-than-life O.J. Simpson . Some comment on the white band of his stiff collar , the crisp lines of his dark suit , the sleek matinee-idol profile . The commentary is punctuated with &quot; too bads &quot; and &quot; how sads &quot; -- each statement delivered in a tone that suggests they are viewing not a defendant but a corpse . Beyond Simpson ' s innocence or guilt , beyond expressions of sympathy or sadness for the bereaved , beyond the public obsession with the melodrama , for many African Americans the Simpson saga brings_up a host of thorny , unresolved issues -- about race , about class and about privilege . It opens old psychic wounds . The ubiquitous image of Simpson sitting silently in a courtroom is both a blow and a rebuke . Although a recent Times poll and a USA Today survey show that African Americans are nearly twice as likely as whites to sympathize_with Simpson , a subterranean dialogue is gaining steady momentum . At informal meeting_places around the city and the country -- from barber and beauty_shops , to bus_stops and cafes , to racquetball courts and sunny breakfast_tables -- another hearing of sorts is_well under way . Even before Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell ' s decision Friday that Simpson should be tried_for the murder of his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend , Ronald Lyle Goldman , race had begun to emerge from the shadows . It was beginning to find shape and form near the center of discussion about the case , especially among African Americans . It moved from private conversations and radio talk_shows into a more public sphere . And once the subject of race arrives , many believe , the specter of racism is sure to follow , finding its voice not in shouts but in whispers . Some people call it the &quot; hidden issue. &quot; Some pointedly argue that it is not an issue at all . Still others believe it was from the beginning -- and will always be -- at the center of any high-profile event or small incident that involves a person_of_color . But with Simpson it is more complicated than that . &quot; There are some people regardless of their color who hit such a celebrity status they transcend the issue of race , &quot; said Dr. Kwaku Person-Lynn , who teaches African American Studies at Cal State Dominguez Hills . &quot; When you go above and beyond , that tends to diffuse the issue of race . . . . And the fact that he is so associated with the white world , he is not a threat . He is not one of them , but yet he is. &quot; Yet , as with so_much of American culture , race is a lens that focuses or distorts the world in a particular way . And for many African Americans , the Simpson debate is seen_through that very prism . &quot; People want him to be innocent , &quot; said Michael Hughes , a West Los Angeles-based psychotherapist . &quot; I think the way that wish manifests itself is different in white people than in black people . I think . . . it ' s easy for white people to put race out of their minds . I don ' t mean that nastily , but I don ' t think any of us want to be burdened . But I don ' t think that a black_person doesn ' t wake_up any day and not reckon with being black . I don ' t think white people share that same concern at the same degree. &quot; Even black people who were not especially fond of Simpson have empathized with his plight . Kathy , 39 , who asked that her last_name not be used , says that , from the beginning , she believed it was going_to be &quot; a race thing. &quot; &quot; Since watching the case I really feel sorry_for him , &quot; she said , spoon-feeding her niece a chocolate sundae at the Crenshaw mall . &quot; I blame the media . It ' s a conspiracy to keep black people down . First it was Clarence Thomas . Then Mike Tyson . Michael Jackson . Rodney King. &quot; Simpson ' s &quot; hero &quot; status , his place as an icon , especially among African Americans , adds another dimension to the debate . But as the weeks pass , Simpson becomes less a hero and more a symbol . A catalyst . A scapegoat , a lightning_rod . &quot; I ' m a writer and a member of the media . I take this in stride , &quot; said Ellis Cose , a contributing editor at Newsweek and author of &quot; The Rage of a Privileged Class. &quot; &quot; But it ' s different on the street : ' Jesus , why are they going_after this black_man ? . . . that ' s what happens when a black_man tries to be white , ' &quot; Cose said . &quot; I ' m also hearing a lot of people saying that it sort of serves him right for turning his back on the community. &quot; Cose sees it as an intriguingly complex case of schizophrenia . &quot; There are a lot of ( black ) people who don ' t identify with him , they think he abandoned the community . But they are invested in his well-being somehow . If O.J. is guilty , then somehow they are . &quot; It is , &quot; Cose said , &quot; part of the cross that minorities bear . And it goes_back to that sense of being_on probation in America . It either expiates you or deepens your misery. &quot; Nonetheless , Cose feels that the Simpson case , on its face , has very little to do with race . But it plays a large part in the way many African Americans are reacting to the media coverage . Early on , many reactions -- from unconditional support to condemnation -- weren ' t based so_much on a particular transgression -- but on what many thought might lie_around the corner . Vivid memories and cautionary tales -- like that of Emmett Till , who was lynched in 1955 in Mississippi for whistling at a white_woman -- are slow to recede ; they fuel suspicion , spur dialogue . When Time magazine darkened the image of Simpson on its June 27 cover , the proverbial smoking gun surfaced . Media have attempted to tip-toe around the race issue , Cose said , for a_couple_of reasons . &quot; We ' ve spent 40 years dealing with race , and people want to get_it off the table . . . . ( People ) tend to be very polite and very nervous about race . And very correct . The first inclination of the responsible media is to play it as straight as they can , bend over backward to make race not a factor . The irony is , &quot; Cose said , &quot; that it is coming_through the back door. &quot; Many African Americans tend to see the Simpson panorama -- from media and law_enforcement to something as quietly powerful as the loaded language of the public discourse -- a shade differently . Diligently scanning for the subliminal messages , early on they saw the harbingers of worse things to come . &quot; My buttons were pushed when O.J. was handcuffed initially , not as ( a ) suspect but a person who may be able to provide information , &quot; said Westwood-based attorney George L . Mallory Jr . &quot; I don ' t want to suggest that this is all racial , but having served as a prosecutor , I realized that at that stage , O.J. was not a suspect . It wasn ' t appropriate to put_on the handcuffs . . . he was going_to speak_to police , he was not combative . The handcuffs illustrated at an early stage that the LAPD were inappropriately exercising their discretion. &quot; Ralph Wiley , a former sports journalist and author of the book &quot; What Black People Should Do Now , &quot; says it ' s what didn ' t happen in those early days that gave him pause . &quot; What I first noticed was that I saw an African American man be treated as a man in the American justice system . I thought I was living_in an alternate universe , &quot; Wiley said . &quot; I ' ve never seen the police take the handcuffs off a black murder_suspect . To see that . In some ways O.J. is a paradigm . I wish the American justice system would treat everyone the way that they treated O.J. &quot; Opinions became more vocal as media coverage picked_up steam : the omnipresent mug_shot , the nonstop footage of O.J. Simpson at the pinnacle ( Nicole Brown Simpson smiling in the background ) , now juxtaposed against the duly subdued and somber man in cuffs . For some , the haunting parade of unsettling images revived dormant ghosts and opened old wounds . &quot; Every time we have a black_man with power the system along with the media has to take them down , &quot; said Ronald Mathis , modeling one of his wares -- a black T-shirt emblazoned with a visage of Simpson in his glory days -- and the message : &quot; Save O.J. We Believe in You. &quot; Mathis is staked out at the corner of Temple and Spring Downtown selling T-shirts ( $ 10 ) and caps ( $ 5 ) at a brisk clip . &quot; They ' re just blowing it all out of proportion . Just want to take a black_man down , &quot; he said . Others feel it is a bit more complex than that . &quot; The Time and Newsweek covers did_it for me , &quot; said Muhammad Nassardeen , founder of the Inglewood-based Recycling Black Dollars community improvement organization . &quot; I understand marketing and I understand imagery , so when those hit the newsstand , I thought : ' Wow , they are really playing games. ' And ' A Trail of Blood , ' it was a horrible caption , &quot; said Nassardeen of Newsweek ' s June 27 cover . &quot; I thought it was just as bad as the Time cover , but ( that one ) had a sensitive caption : ' An American Tragedy. ' Just think if you were a white_person and the only black_person that you saw was with a broom or was a caddy , and now this . That was about fear . They think : ' Wow , we should be afraid of them. ' &quot; Nassardeen , however , says he wants to be careful about choosing the cause , lest the import of the message be lessened . &quot; We need balance in the portrait of the African American . I don ' t want to be running_around screaming , carrying the racism flag , anytime that an African American does anything that hurts us , &quot; he said . &quot; We can not allow ourselves to be tied with Darryl Strawberry ' s drugs , or O.J. ' s problems . We can ' t become victims of a myopic view . We have to step back and look_at the big picture. &quot; He echoes Cose ' s observation about African Americans feeling as if they are_on probation , viewed_as a group rather than as individuals . For many , the stakes feel , and are , high . And sometimes the most intense pressure comes from within the ranks . &quot; I ' m really saddened by it as a person who ' s basically committed to African and African American images , &quot; said Nassardeen . &quot; This , this is a major blow. &quot; Patricia A . Turner , a professor of African American Studies at UC Davis , tells a story that many African Americans would find familiar . &quot; When I was a little_girl a series of murders were committed in our town . . . . I remember my parents hoping and praying the killer wasn ' t black , &quot; Turner recalled . &quot; This was in the early days of the civil_rights movement . . . . We didn ' t want anything to happen that would set Martin_Luther_King back . &quot; This is something that I don ' t think many white people understand , &quot; Turner said . &quot; Like the murder of Polly Klaas wasn ' t looked_at as a blow against the white_race . But the faults of one of us are viewed_as blows against all_of us. &quot; As with many minority groups , shrugging_off those reflexive responses requires peeling_off layers of expectations and warnings passed down through generations . And as Florida-based clinical_psychologist Na ' im Akbar notes , the more public the figure , the more prevalent the tendency to reach_out and protect the fall . &quot; We are very protective of our celebrities , &quot; Akbar said . &quot; We are protective of anyone who gains visibility . . . and the reason being that there are so few of us who do . When they do gain prominence , it is usually for some negative reason , &quot; he said . When a high-profile individual takes a tumble , the reverberations are particularly intense within black circles : &quot; When they become tainted in some way , then their shortcomings become equated with the whole black community , &quot; Akbar said . &quot; And as long as the person is a black hero when they are tainted , their taint is a direct consequence of them being African American. &quot; But it is Simpson ' s complicated public persona that make unconditional allegiances complex : His second wife and a string of white girlfriends , golf_games at the country_club , the symbols of landed ( read : white ) gentry . That has made fully embracing Simpson difficult for some African Americans . Even the terms &quot; transcendence &quot; and &quot; colorlessness &quot; have been used by supporters and detractors alike . A transcendence that raised his profile and rallied support from all hues ; yet a colorlessness that made some African Americans wonder of late , aloud , if he &quot; forgot where he came from. &quot; &quot; I think O.J. was universally accepted , &quot; said attorney Mallory . &quot; O.J. had really , at least in his mind -- and probably in the mind of others -- in some sense transcended race , and I think that in some part because O.J. was never really viewed_as an individual intricately involved in the black community . Therefore , blacks_and_whites somehow became more tolerant of O.J. ' s lifestyle -- which was non-threatening to either ethnic_group , &quot; Mallory said . &quot; I think the commercials more_than anything else brought him into mainstream America . And his image somewhat endeared him to the hearts of Middle America because of his non-threatening style. &quot; Treading a line between two worlds upped the psychological ante , said Person-Lynn of Cal State Dominguez Hills . &quot; O.J. Simpson has been , and has not been part of the African American psyche , so to speak . And so we ' ve embraced him as our own . As an African American man , we don ' t want to see him abused ; we will close ranks. &quot; But he added , careful not to shroud the crucial particulars of the case , &quot; we want to see him . . . treated fairly , if he is innocent . If he is guilty . . . we want to see him punished. &quot; But Ralph Wiley views it through a slightly different prism -- beyond race . &quot; The hero_worshipers feel betrayed , &quot; Wiley said . &quot; ' Juice ' became what people expected him to be . that ' s what causes these things , this abuse of power , corruption of power. &quot; Power and class , said Joe Hicks , executive_director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles . &quot; To some degree Simpson ' s celebrity status placed him above . He ran_across our TV screen for years playing football , then ran_across our TV screens in the car rental commercials . His celebrity status allowed him to be viewed_as a celebrity -- who happened to be black . &quot; I don ' t think that race has anything to do with this , &quot; Hicks said , &quot; except among some peripheral people around some communities . I think it ' s a discussion trying to seep its way_out of this talk_show circuit , suck out some bigger issues . The longer ( the case ) goes , it gives people time for their minds to sink back into different modes and issues , to develop some sort of racial posture , so that the races both black_and_white can snipe at each other. &quot; To Hicks , class speaks louder than race in this instance . &quot; It points_up the degree to which money can buy you some justice in America . He has the ability and the money to hire himself a_battery of defense_attorneys that a normal person couldn ' t even dream of . Justice is clearly a class issue -- this is not about a black_man married to a white_woman . I certainly don ' t see this. &quot; The discussion of race also obscures another issue central to the debate -- domestic abuse . Five years ago , Simpson pleaded no contest to charges of spousal battery . &quot; In ' 89 was when we should have helped the brother out , &quot; said Gary Phillips , a local writer and activist . &quot; Here was a man who by his own admission beat his wife. &quot; You cannot divorce the issue of race , Phillips said , &quot; but there is another reality there too . It really raises this debate around men . Do we start to deal with this whole question of wife beating ? Do we as men confront that ? Call your friends on something that they might be doing. &quot; But even a youngster who raised the question of domestic abuse saw at the core an issue of disparity and unequal treatment . &quot; I think it just isn ' t fair , &quot; said Brandy , 11 , taking a break from shopping with her mother at the Crenshaw mall . &quot; It isn ' t fair because it ' s happening here all_the time -- women getting beaten , killed . But when it happens over in that area , &quot; she said , gesturing toward a vague expanse , &quot; then they do something about it. &quot; And that issue most ruffles Kimberle Crenshaw . &quot; I ' m sorry I don ' t think that that many people were that invested in O.J. , and therein lies the rub for me , &quot; said Crenshaw , a UCLA law professor . &quot; My own set of concerns goes_along the gender lines -- to circle the wagons around gender . But you don ' t see a similar kind of concern when it comes_to black women. &quot; The black community was lukewarm when it came_to Lani Guinier and Anita Hill , she says . &quot; And we ' re about to have the most Draconian welfare reforms which ( will affect ) black_women , and I don ' t see a lot of people rallying around to support those women . Though a lot of us were raised by single black women. &quot; Crenshaw wants to push people to examine other hidden issues tangential to race , but intraracial in nature . But airing issues that suggest disharmony in the black community , especially those of gender equity , often gets viewed_as diluting the cause , breaking ranks or airing dirty laundry . &quot; I would n ' t mind if we had a washing machine inside &quot; and cleaned_up the problems , Crenshaw said . &quot; It ' s just that I don ' t like sleeping on dirty sheets. &quot;</TEXT>
