   <HEADLINE> FOX ANIMATION STUDIO WILL BE BUILT IN PHOENIX ; HOLLYWOOD : ARIZONA ENTICES THE COMPANY WITH $ 1 MILLION IN JOB TRAINING FUNDS AND LOW-INTEREST LOANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Twentieth Century Fox said Monday that it will build its new 300-employee animation film studio in Phoenix after Arizona offered the company about $ 1 million in job training funds and low-interest loans to buy state-of-the-art digital animation equipment . The decision marks the first time one of the big Hollywood studios has located a significant operation in Arizona , and it is another reminder that Southern California does not have an exclusive franchise on movie-making operations . Fox plans to invest about $ 100 million in the new subsidiary , Fox Animation Studios , which is expected to produce an animated feature every 18 months . Although California was one of five states originally considered for the studio , Fox and state officials acknowledged that it stood little chance from the start because executives involved in the project wanted to live away from Los Angeles and its traffic_jams . &quot; This wasn ' t an indictment of the business climate in California , but rather a very personal quality-of-life issue for the people involved at the helm of the animation operation . California wasn ' t really in the running , &quot; California Film Commission Director Patti Archuletta said . Fox President Bill Mechanic said such California cities as San Diego , Santa Barbara and San Francisco were considered . He said Fox executives wanted the operation close to its Westside studio and concluded that Phoenix , an hour away by plane , was close enough . Fox officials also said Phoenix was chosen for &quot; lifestyle reasons &quot; -- namely low housing costs and short commute times that they feel will help attract and keep workers -- and because Arizona offered a favorable &quot; business climate. &quot; The final_decision came_after Fox narrowed the search to Phoenix and Spokane , Wash . Texas and New Mexico were considered briefly . Ironically , the decision to put the animation operation in Arizona comes as industry leader Walt Disney Co . has been rapidly expanding its animation operation in Southern California , with plans to consolidate it into a new building this fall at its Burbank lot . But even Disney plans to start producing some of its full-length animated movies entirely in Florida starting later this decade . Fox is forming its animation operation in a deal with longtime animators Don Bluth and Gary Goldman , whose films include &quot; An American Tail , &quot; &quot; The Land Before Time &quot; and &quot; All Dogs Go_to Heaven. &quot; Fox wants to gain a major foothold in animation despite Disney ' s domination . Animation has enjoyed a huge resurgence thanks largely to highly profitable Disney films such_as &quot; The Lion King &quot; and &quot; Aladdin , &quot; the exploding home video market and the growing appetite for family films . Arizona ' s sweeteners include a $ 650 # 000 low-interest loan from the state ' s Commerce and Economic Development Commission over five years to buy the animation equipment . Another $ 100 # 000 in job training funds have been committed , with another $ 200 # 000 sought subject_to funding by the state Legislature . Another $ 150 # 000 in other incentives is expected . Fox is expected to invest about $ 5 million in the Phoenix studio . In addition , it plans to spend $ 1 million to improve a 60 # 000-square-foot building there .</TEXT>
