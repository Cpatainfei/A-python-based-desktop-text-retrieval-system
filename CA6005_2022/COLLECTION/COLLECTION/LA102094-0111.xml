   <TEXT> As the morning sun lifts above the_hills east of this town near the Hudson_River , Harvey Houtkin , principal and chief_executive_officer of tiny Domestic Securities Inc. , sits before a Nasdaq trading terminal , steeling himself to do the unthinkable . Houtkin taps a_few buttons on a keyboard linked to the central computer for over-the-counter stock trading . &quot; What I ' m doing now is the most unacceptable thing you can do_in the market , &quot; he says . Indeed , Houtkin -- a &quot; market maker &quot; whose business is buying and selling Nasdaq stocks at publicly quoted prices -- is about to send traders at vastly larger firms into fits of rage . Seeking to attract a small portion of the more_than 66 billion shares traded annually on Nasdaq , he is about to deliberately narrow the spreads -- essentially the market makers ' profit_margin -- on some of the most widely traded over-the-counter stocks . The move will save investors money . But it also will cut_into the hefty profits of more established Nasdaq dealers . He punches_in the symbol for Intel Corp. , the computer chip maker that is Nasdaq ' s second-largest company . Houtkin , with 1 # 000 shares to sell , changes his posted prices . He cuts the &quot; spread &quot; -- the gap between the best price at which any dealer will buy the stock and the price at which he will sell it -- from a quarter of a point , or 25 cents a share , to a mere eighth of a point , or 12 1 / 2 cents . In response , a message flashes on his trading terminal from a much larger market maker , Weeden &amp; Co. : &quot; Pathetic. &quot; A caller who says he is Peter from Morgan Stanley complains : &quot; You guys break the spread for 1 # 000 shares ? &quot; Chiron Corp. ' s stock has been trading with a 1 / 2-point spread ; Houtkin narrows it to three-eighths . The phones ring again . This time , Keith Balter , head of over-the-counter trading at Weeden , tells Houtkin : &quot; You ' re embarrassing and pathetic . . . . You ' re breaking the spreads for everybody. &quot; Small investors may never be aware that they benefited from Houtkin ' s initiatives . Yet an ordinary individual investor buying 200 shares of Chiron or Intel at the better price posted by Domestic Securities would have saved $ 25 . With an average of 299 million shares changing hands daily on Nasdaq , narrower spreads on just the biggest Nasdaq stocks would add_up to millions in dollars of savings for retail customers every year . Nasdaq this year surpassed the New York Stock_Exchange to have the highest daily trading volume of the nation ' s stock_markets . But amid the massive trading , such savings -- representing millions of dollars in foregone profits for market makers -- rarely materialize . Instead , close examination of Nasdaq ' s day-to-day operations shows that the system is biased against the small investor , favoring big institutional traders and market makers over the ordinary investing public . The Justice_Department confirmed this week that it is conducting an antitrust investigation of Nasdaq , looking_into allegations of price-fixing and other illegal practices by dealers . The National Assn . of Securities Dealers , which owns and operates Nasdaq , says it is unaware of any investigation but will cooperate fully . NASD officials insist that their fast-growing electronic market -- home to such familiar stocks as Microsoft Corp. , MCI Communications Corp . and Apple Computer Inc. -- is fair to small and large investors alike . Nasdaq has made_it possible for some of these companies to raise the money they needed to prosper , creating billions of dollars in wealth for the U.S. economy . And as the home to many of the most rapidly growing firms in technology and health_care , it has increased tremendously in recent years in its importance to small investors . &quot; that ' s where the growth is , &quot; said Robert W . Erikson , 67 . He is an original member of a Michigan investment club , founded in 1955 , that now invests almost half its assets in Nasdaq stocks . But an inquiry by The Times -- including three months spent sitting on Nasdaq trading desks and interviews with more_than 100 traders , professional investors , customers and Nasdaq officials -- found that individual investors are much more likely to get fair treatment for their trades on the venerable New York Stock_Exchange than on Nasdaq . On the NYSE , spreads for most stocks are a mere eighth of a point , while the vast majority of Nasdaq stocks -- even the biggest , most actively traded issues -- trade at spreads of a quarter-point or more . In part through an automated computer_system , big and small orders get executed on a relatively equal footing on the New York exchange ; indeed , investors often get prices better than the posted spread . Nasdaq investors , by contrast , get a worse price for their trades than big investors , such_as pension and mutual_funds or the market makers themselves . And if a customer has put_in an order to sell a stock at , say , $ 20 , that order will be filled on the NYSE before any buyer has to pay a higher price . On Nasdaq , there is no such rule . The federal Securities and Exchange Commission has moved_in recent months to stop Nasdaq firms from &quot; trading ahead &quot; of their customers ' orders . But the new rules still will allow thousands of more advantageous offers to sit unfilled each day in Nasdaq ' s fragmented trading system while market makers sell shares to small investors at higher prices . Unlike the New York or American_stock_exchanges , Nasdaq ( the name originally stood_for National Assn . of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system ) has no trading floor . It is a nationwide network of 510 market-making firms linked together by a central computer_system and telephones . In a massive ad_campaign , Nasdaq bills itself as &quot; the stock_market for the next 100 years. &quot; Yet traders say that except for a separate computer_system owned by the_British firm Reuters PLC , much of Nasdaq ' s daily volume is traded not through sophisticated electronic networks . Instead , it trades the old-fashioned way -- by one dealer talking to another over the phone , much as the over-the-counter market operated in the decades when it served mainly as a means for obscure companies to sell shares to the public . Among the Nasdaq ' s most controversial practices : * Competition among market makers to offer the best price and the narrowest spreads has all but disappeared on Nasdaq , according to veteran traders , mutual_fund managers and others . Under a controversial system in which many market makers pay brokerage_firms to send them a steady flow of orders from small investors -- regardless of the price the market maker is offering -- a financial incentive exists to keep spreads as wide as possible . The NASD insists that price_competition is the heart of its market system -- indeed , one of its key advantages over the NYSE ' s traditional &quot; auction &quot; system , in which a single &quot; specialist &quot; firm serves as the sole market maker for each stock . * Nasdaq dealers flout the requirement to execute customer orders at the best available price . Despite new rules , market makers still will be able to ignore better offers for their customers ' stock and thereby maximize their own profits . Dozens of times , a reporter watched as individual customers or traders entered orders at prices inside the prevailing spread , only to see the orders ignored while other trades were executed at less desirable prices . The NASD insists that it carefully balances the interests of its customers and market makers alike . * Nasdaq seldom enforces a key securities regulation , the &quot; firm quote &quot; rule , which requires dealers to honor the prices they post on Nasdaq computer terminals . Instead , dealers routinely &quot; back_away &quot; from their quotes -- that is , they refuse to trade at all at the prices they advertise . Although 4 # 748 backing-away complaints have been filed with the NASD through Oct . 4 of this year , the group has taken no public disciplinary action on any of them . ( On three , small fines of $ 500 to $ 1 # 500 were imposed but were not publicly disclosed. ) Market makers charge that the NASD doesn ' t aggressively investigate most of the complaints . The NASD says many of the complaints are frivolous . * Nasdaq also seldom enforces the requirement that dealers promptly report each trade for display on the public tape . Senior executives of mutual_funds and other institutional investors complain that some Nasdaq market makers routinely delay reporting trades -- and thereby avoid influencing the market . In doing so , critics say , they prevent investors from accurately assessing the supply , demand and price for a stock . The NASD says it closely monitors the market , but that deliberate wrongdoing is difficult to prove . The group said it has taken no public action this year against any market maker for failing to accurately report trades . While these problems are interlinked , veteran traders say the most fundamental problem with Nasdaq trading is the market ' s wide spreads . The Justice_Department investigation is focusing_on an alleged conspiracy by market makers to keep spreads wide . The NASD has vehemently denied that there is collusion in its marketplace . In an interview , NASD President Joseph Hardiman said that as far as he knew , market makers were completely free to narrow spreads . Hardiman said he had no knowledge of any verbal harassment of market makers who did so . &quot; I would be very distressed if that practice were to occur in our marketplace , &quot; Hardiman said . &quot; To say that we would react strongly if any evidence of that were presented to us is an understatement. &quot; Documents obtained by The Times show that formal complaints have been filed with the NASD , which so far has taken no disciplinary action on any of them . Meanwhile , NASD officials privately have been pressing market makers to cut spreads . Among the reasons : fear that big companies are becoming reluctant to list their stock on Nasdaq because of concern about excessive spreads -- and fear that Congress or the SEC might step_in and require sweeping reforms . Besides the Justice_Department antitrust probe -- still in its preliminary stages -- the big trading firms face more_than a dozen major class-action lawsuits accusing them of conspiracy to keep spreads artificially wide . The suits , filed since May , seek millions of dollars in damages . They were prompted by news_reports that business professors William G . Christie of Vanderbilt University and Paul H . Schultz of Ohio State University had found strong circumstantial_evidence of tacit collusion among market makers to fix the spreads . The market makers also deny that there is any collusion in Nasdaq . Yet Balter , the OTC trading chief at Greenwich , Conn.-based Weeden &amp; Co. , acknowledged that he verbally pressured Houtkin at Domestic Securities when Houtkin cut the spreads . Indeed , Balter expressed no remorse for berating Houtkin as a reporter listened in . &quot; A thousand shares is not worth breaking the spread in a stock , &quot; Balter said . &quot; My comment is that for somebody who narrows a spread ( without standing ready to buy large quantities of stock ) , pathetic is a good word. &quot; ( A Morgan Stanley Group Inc. spokeswoman said the firm would not comment on the call placed to Houtkin by its trader. ) Richard G . Ketchum , the NASD ' s chief operating officer , confirms that market makers are not allowed to speak &quot; abusively &quot; to each other or to try to threaten or intimidate fellow dealers . The NASD ' s rules of fair practice require member firms &quot; to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade. &quot; The NASD has the power to censure and fine violators , although it does so rarely . * What are spreads ? If you were to look_at a computer_screen used by Nasdaq traders , you would see each market maker quoting two prices for each stock . One is the &quot; bid &quot; price , at which the market maker is willing to buy the stock from the public . The other , known as the &quot; asked , &quot; is the higher price at which the market maker is willing to sell . The difference between the two is called the spread . It exists to cover a dealer ' s costs of making a market in a stock ( including the risk of holding shares that might go_down in price ) and the dealer ' s profit_margin . In promoting itself as superior to the NYSE , the American_Stock_Exchange and other exchanges , Nasdaq boasts that for each of its stock , multiple dealers vie with each other to make markets . For such big Nasdaq stocks as Apple Computer , MCI , and Microsoft , there are 50 or more market makers . The NASD contends that Nasdaq ' s multiplicity of market makers creates intense competition and results in customers getting better prices . But the vaunted competition among market makers is more illusory than real . On Aug . 30 , for example , nearly 450 # 000 shares of Cambridge , Mass.-based Biogen Inc. had traded as of 11:57 a.m. EDT Although there were 38 market makers supposedly competing with each other to trade the stock , 13 were posting the identical bid_price , 50 3 / 4 . All of the rest posted less favorable prices -- indicating , basically , that they were not willing to trade . And none had stepped_forward to beat the 51 1 / 4 asked price by breaking the 1 / 2-point spread . At about the same time , shares_in Intel , a Santa Clara-based semiconductor maker , were trading with a 1 / 4-point spread -- and continued to do so throughout the day , though 63 market makers were posting prices for the stock . Intel ended the day with a higher trading volume than all but three stocks on the NYSE . Experts say the day ' s trading pattern was typical . On Nasdaq , the vast majority of stocks have spreads of at least 1 / 4 of a point ; less actively traded stocks can have spreads ranging beyond 2 points -- that is , more_than $ 2 per share . On Wednesday , for example , Oneita Industries Inc. , one of the smallest stocks_listed on NYSE , had a spread most of the trading day of 1 / 8 , even though only a total of 55 # 500 of its shares changed hands . In contrast , the spread on Lotus Development -- a far larger company that is one of the biggest listed on Nasdaq -- varied between 1 / 4 and 1 / 2 , even though more_than 3.2 million shares traded . &quot; There is no real competition &quot; among market makers on spreads , said Robert M . Gintel , chairman and chief_executive of the Gintel Group , a mutual_fund manager in Greenwich , Conn . Nasdaq ' s claims about the benefits of market maker competition are &quot; fictional , &quot; he said . Nasdaq officials contend that the spreads are determined purely by competitive market forces . Indeed , the NASD and market theorists say that in a truly competitive market , spreads should be determined by how actively traded a stock is , how many shares are held by outside investors , the volatility of a stock ' s price and the number of market makers competing against each other . &quot; The spreads in highly liquid , highly active stocks ( on Nasdaq ) are very good , &quot; insisted Hardiman , the NASD president . Yet records of market makers ' daily quotes and the new study by Christie and Schultz suggest the existence of a gap between official explanations and reality . The professors discovered something odd about Nasdaq trading : Seventy-one out of 100 of the largest Nasdaq stocks almost never were quoted in &quot; odd eighths , &quot; they wrote . That is , the quoted bid or asked prices might be 20 or 20 1 / 4 or 20 1 / 2 , but almost never 20 1 / 8 or 20 3 / 8 or 20 5 / 8 . And as a direct result , the spreads on these stocks almost never were less than a quarter of a point . Christie and Schultz , whose findings will be published in December in the Journal of Finance and have been cited in many of the class-action lawsuits , searched for market-related reasons why these stocks would not trade_in odd eighths when , at_the_same_time , much more thinly traded stocks routinely had odd-eighths quotes . In the end , they concluded that there must be an unwritten agreement among market makers to keep the spreads in these stocks wide . &quot; While this paper does not provide conclusive evidence of tacit collusion among market makers , we are unable to offer any other plausible explanation for the lack of odd-eighth quotes , &quot; they stated . None of big market-making firms contacted by The Times would give an explanation for not quoting major Nasdaq stocks in odd eighths . All declined comment , some citing the pending class-action lawsuits . Publicly , NASD officials tried hard to discredit the study . Ketchum told The Times in May that the report &quot; is irresponsible -- and in fact we believe it is slanderous. &quot; NASD chief economist Gene L . Finn acknowledged that the NASD has no studies of its own on the subject . But he and Ketchum maintain that market forces explain why quotes for certain stocks &quot; gravitate naturally &quot; toward increments of 1 / 4 of a point . Ketchum said spreads on big Nasdaq stocks stay wide because Nasdaq market makers are expected to stand_by the prices they quote for large amounts of stock -- 10 # 000 shares or more per trade . The dealers , he said , need wide spreads to cover the risks they undertake in filling such big orders . But Nasdaq rules only require market makers to honor their prices for 1 # 000 shares . Despite repeated requests , NASD officials did not offer statistical evidence that dealers routinely honor their prices for bigger amounts of stock . The Times , meanwhile , has learned that at_the_same_time they were deriding the professors ' report , top NASD officials quietly had begun moving to address a problem whose existence they publicly denied . On May 24 -- just a day before he publicly blasted the professors ' report as &quot; slanderous &quot; -- Ketchum addressed a closed-door meeting of major Nasdaq market makers , sponsored by the Securities Traders Assn. , at the headquarters of Bear , Stearns &amp; Co . Inc. in New York . Ketchum has since confirmed that he told the market makers that the spreads on some stocks were too wide -- and asked_for voluntary action to narrow them . Otherwise , he said , the NASD might be forced to crack_down . A few days later -- on Friday , May 27 , and Monday , May 30 -- the spreads on three of the biggest Nasdaq stocks -- Apple Computer , Microsoft and Amgen Inc. -- suddenly narrowed to an eighth , and stayed there . In the previous months , they almost always had traded with spreads of at least a quarter . What happened ? Ketchum and other NASD officials confirm that , in response to his speech , three leading market makers each picked a leading Nasdaq stock and unilaterally cut the spread . Among them was William R . Rothe , a member of the NASD ' s board of governors who is also a managing director in_charge of OTC trading at Baltimore-based Alex . Brown &amp; Sons . Rothe cut the spread on Apple Computer that Monday , The Times has learned . All day , whichever way the stock moved , Rothe moved his firm ' s bid or asked prices to ensure that the spread stayed an eighth . Goldman Sachs &amp; co . did the same with Microsoft . And a third market maker did so with Amgen , an NASD source said . The spreads have stayed_at an eighth ever since . Rothe declined to comment about the narrowing . Goldman Sachs spokesman Edward G . Novotny , in a written statement , denied that the firm ' s decision to cut the spread on Microsoft that day had anything to do with Ketchum ' s speech . Ketchum , however , said in an interview that he believes the decision stemmed at least partly from his remarks . In any event , at an eighth , these stocks now trade with spreads the same as those for comparable stocks on the NYSE . Critics say the ease with which market makers were able to permanently lower them raises questions about whether competitive market forces really determine Nasdaq spreads -- and about why the spreads on more big Nasdaq stocks haven ' t followed_suit . Schultz , the Ohio State professor , said the fact that three market makers easily were able to narrow the spreads on three of Nasdaq ' s biggest stocks supports the theory that there is collusion among market makers to set spreads . On Microsoft , for example , he noted that 41 market makers on a single day began quoting in odd-eighths , changing a pricing practice that had been in_effect for years . &quot; That , we think , is probably the strongest evidence that the dealers are not acting independently , &quot; Schultz said . * From the vantage_point of small investors , spreads can be the difference between winning and losing on an investment . For a stock quoted 8 bid-8 3 / 4 asked , investors buying on the asked price would have to wait for the stock ' s bid_price to go_up nearly 10 % ( not counting commissions ) before they could break_even on their investments . Even so , the quoted spreads don ' t tell the whole story . Professionals often trade &quot; inside the spread , &quot; paying far less to buy and sell Nasdaq shares . &quot; Institutions love to trade Nasdaq because they get treated very nicely and can trade inside the spread , &quot; said Andrew Schwarz , an options trader and specialist on the American_Stock_Exchange . &quot; But if your Aunt Betty wants to buy 500 shares of a Nasdaq stock , good_luck getting a price inside the market. &quot; Many individual investors say they have no idea they routinely pay more for Nasdaq stocks than the professionals . Consider the recent experience of Beverly Wayte of Pasadena , an avid investor who teaches adult English_classes . Through her broker Charles Schwab &amp; Co. , Wayte on Aug . 17 bought 200 shares of Eltron International , a Chatsworth company that makes bar_code printers . Her order was executed at 11:24 a.m. EDT , and she got the stock at its quoted ask price , 12 3 / 8 . But records obtained from the NASD show that within minutes of her trade -- while the stock ' s quoted price remained unchanged -- other investors were able to buy_it for less . A case_in_point : In another trade that took_place within just seconds of Wayte ' s , a bigger investor bought 1 # 000 shares of Eltron and paid only 12 . Schwab , the nation ' s leading discount brokerage_firm , would seem to have little incentive to get customers like Wayte a price inside the spread . Schwab owns one of the biggest Nasdaq market makers , Mayer &amp; Schweitzer Inc. , which executes most of the Nasdaq trades for Schwab ' s customers . So Schwab profits from the wide spreads , as do large Wall_Street brokerage_firms like Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . Inc. and PaineWebber Inc. , which are Nasdaq market makers themselves . Schwab spokesman Hugo Quackenbush said most retail customers are not concerned about getting a price inside the spread , but rather about getting their orders filled quickly at the price quoted to them over the phone . Quackenbush defended the firm ' s handling of Wayte ' s and similar trades . &quot; We ' re not embarrassed about it , &quot; he said . &quot; We go_to great efforts to guarantee that customers get_the_best nationwide inside bid or offer , as appropriate. &quot; And he acknowledged that Schwab has a profit incentive to charge the full spread . &quot; Sure we make more money , &quot; he said , adding : &quot; We play by the rules of the Nasdaq market. &quot; Hardiman , the NASD president , said he is not troubled by small investors getting_worse prices on Nasdaq . &quot; The retail investor clearly doesn ' t have the negotiating clout that an institutional investor has , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s true in any business. &quot; And , he said , the spreads should not be significant to small investors . &quot; Individuals should not trade a lot of stocks in the Nasdaq market , &quot; he said . &quot; These are growth_stocks . They should be investors , not speculators. &quot; Yet Wayte , who buys a_few hundred shares of Nasdaq stocks from time to time , said she was surprised to learn from a reporter that others trading at_the_same_time get better prices . &quot; I ' m disappointed and frustrated , &quot; she said . &quot; And I ' d like to know what the SEC thinks_about this. &quot; A number of companies whose stocks traded on Nasdaq have taken investors ' concerns so seriously that they have pulled their shares off Nasdaq and listed them elsewhere . Until August , the NAIC Growth Fund , a closed-end mutual_fund , was listed on Nasdaq . But swamped with complaints from fund investors about the wide spreads market makers were quoting on the shares , it moved to the Chicago Stock_Exchange . The fund is run_by the National Assn . of Investors Corp. , a Royal Oak , Mich. , not-for-profit group that promotes responsible investing by individuals and helps set_up investment clubs , including many for senior_citizens . The closed-end_fund ( a mutual_fund whose shares trade like a stock ) was set_up as an investment vehicle for NAIC members . While the stock was listed on Nasdaq , the spread was 1 1 / 2 -- or sometimes more , according to NAIC Chairman Thomas E . O ' Hara . Market makers &quot; were making as much as $ 2 on a $ 10 stock , &quot; he said . &quot; We thought that was a little ridiculous . Our members blamed us for that. &quot; Since switching_on the Chicago exchange , the spread on NAIC Growth Fund shares has narrowed to 1 / 4 , according to Lawrence Augustyn , the specialist who handles the shares . On Feb . 2 , O ' Hara wrote to Hardiman seeking an explanation for the wide spreads . NASD spokesman James Spellman said the NASD had no record of receiving the letter . He declined comment on the NAIC fund ' s move to the Chicago exchange . Other companies have cited spreads as a reason for bolting from Nasdaq . David C . Carney , chief financial_officer of CoreStates Financial Corp. , said the Philadelphia-based bank holding company switched to the NYSE last year , in part for its narrower spreads . Though insisting that spreads on most Nasdaq stocks are acceptable , Hardiman conceded : &quot; It ' s one reason we lose companies to the exchanges. &quot; * Although Nasdaq says competition among market makers is its greatest advantage over the NYSE , longtime traders say they no longer need to compete to get business . The reason , they say , is a practice known in the industry as &quot; payment for order flow. &quot; Mushrooming since 1987 , it means market makers no longer need to compete on price to be guaranteed a steady flow of customer trades : They get_it anyway . Market-making firms pay brokerage_firms to send them their customer orders for execution . Instead of shopping around a customer ' s order to find a market maker willing to offer the best price , the brokerage gives all or most of its orders to one willing to pay_for them . The market makers typically pay several cents per share for each buy or sell order . The biggest brokerage_firms have become major market makers themselves . Firms such_as Merrill Lynch , the nation ' s largest brokerage , execute a great proportion of their customers ' trades -- assuring them a flow of internal orders . Payment for order flow exists for stocks_listed on the NYSE and other exchanges as well . And controversy about the practice is not new ; it has prompted class-action lawsuits ( which are pending ) and condemnation from many investor groups . But what has drawn scant public scrutiny is its profound impact on Nasdaq trading , where it serves as a strong incentive for market makers to keep spreads wide . The reason : Their contracts require market makers to give the best quoted bid or asked price for a stock at the time an order comes_in , regardless of that market maker ' s own price . So if a small market maker , such_as Domestic Securities ' Houtkin , breaks rank and cuts the spread , other , bigger market makers suddenly have to meet his price . In other words , a market maker who cuts the spread does not just narrow his own profit_margin , but that of fellow market makers as well . Critics such_as Houtkin call the system &quot; bribery for order flow. &quot; A Harvard Law Review_article published in May said brokerage_firms that accept payment for order flow &quot; are engaging in a practice . . . that may induce them to place their own interests ahead of their customers ' interests. &quot; On Nasdaq , payment for order flow &quot; has eliminated competition based on price , &quot; said Benjamin L . Lubin , a former member of the NASD ' s board of governors , its top policy-making body . &quot; If I have captive order flow coming_in , I do not have an incentive to tighten my ( spreads ) , &quot; added another member of the NASD board of governors who declined to be named . &quot; I don ' t have to attract business by having a superior bid or offer , ( because ) it ' s coming_to me no matter what. &quot; Many market makers and brokerage_firms contend that payment for order flow is necessary if very large_numbers of small orders are to be handled efficiently . The volume of small orders on Nasdaq has grown so explosively during the last decade , they say , that they could not shop each one around to multiple market makers seeking the best price . The SEC , after spending several years agonizing over the issue , has decided not to ban payment for order flow . Instead , the agency is adopting a rule that would require brokerages to make detailed disclosure of such payments to customers . There are other reasons why market makers get upset when Houtkin and others cut the spreads . Not only does_it cost them money under payment-for-order-flow arrangements , but it also riles up their big institutional customers , such_as pension and mutual_funds . Investment officers at these institutions have computer terminals on which they can see the current best bid and asked prices for Nasdaq stocks . If Houtkin cuts the spread on a stock , his new , better price will flash on their screens . And that leads institutions to demand better deals too . In a notarized affidavit , Domestic Securities trader James Mercer stated that on July 15 , a trader at San Francisco-based market maker Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc. called Domestic to complain that Houtkin had cut the spread on the stock of Xilinx Corp. , a San Jose software company . &quot; This is bull---- , &quot; the caller allegedly raged . &quot; I have institutional customers who come_to me and I have to match your price . It ' s bull---- , you guys going_down an eighth for a_thousand shares. &quot; Asked about the allegation , Hambrecht &amp; Quist general counsel Steven Machtinger said : &quot; In our opinion , the Nasdaq stock_market is very competitive . Beyond that we have no comment. &quot; NASD officials have tried to cast doubt on Houtkin ' s motivation , pointing_out that he has a record of minor disciplinary violations . Houtkin has been censured and fined twice , paying an undisclosed amount under $ 3 # 000 in total -- once in 1991 for failing to keep accurate records and once in 1985 for allegedly abusing a Nasdaq computer_system for handling small orders . Linda Lerner , general counsel of Domestic Securities , says Houtkin has been singled_out for disciplinary action because he is a maverick , an assertion the NASD denies . Other market makers have a new strategy for dealing with Houtkin , Lerner contends . When Domestic Securities cuts the spread on a stock , a big market maker will hit the firm with a huge order to buy or sell 50 # 000 or 100 # 000 shares . Domestic Securities must fill only 1 # 000 shares at its posted price , but then either must immediately change its price or accept the full order -- which Domestic Securities , a small firm , says it cannot afford to do . &quot; They just blow us out of the way so that the spread can go right back to where it was before , &quot; Lerner said . Individual investors are frustrated too . &quot; You pay on the way in and on the way_out , &quot; said John D . Miskie , 59 , a Redding , Pa. , chemist forced into retirement by a stroke . Miskie says he invests some of his limited savings in Nasdaq and NYSE stocks to have &quot; something to hand_over to my grandchildren. &quot; Says Miskie : I understand that market makers have to make money to stay in business . But that ' s their problem . These ( spreads ) seem tough to justify. &quot; About This Series The electronic Nasdaq market has grown_into the nation ' s busiest marketplace for buying and selling stocks , with higher trading volume than the better-known New York Stock_Exchange . Nasdaq is where investors trade shares of Intel , Microsoft , Apple Computer and other leading firms , along with the stocks of hundreds of smaller companies . Critics are questioning the fundamental fairness of Nasdaq ' s trading system , and the Justice_Department has launched an antitrust investigation of possible price-fixing and other illegal activities .

Speaking the Language A glossary of common terms used on Nasdaq : * Market makers : Firms that put_up their own capital to &quot; make a market &quot; in particular Nasdaq stocks , acting_as dealers by continuously posting prices for the stocks on Nasdaq ' s computer and standing ready to buy or sell . Unlike the New York Stock_Exchange , where a single &quot; specialist &quot; is the sole market maker for each stock , each Nasdaq stock has multiple market makers . There may be 60 or more market makers for very big Nasdaq stocks , such_as MCI , Apple Computer , or Microsoft , or fewer than five for small , very thinly traded stocks . Market makers include many big , well-known Wall_Street investment houses , such_as Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley , as well as lesser-known firms that do little else besides making markets in Nasdaq stocks . * Bid : The posted price at which a market maker is willing to buy a stock . * Asked : The posted price at which a market maker is willing to sell a stock . * Spread : The gap between the bid and asked prices . This is essentially the market maker ' s profit_margin for acting_as a dealer in the stock . Market makers buy from investors at the bid , and sell at the highter , asked price . * Backing Away : The illegal refusal by a market maker to honor the prices it posts in the Nasdaq computer_system for buying or selling a stock . This is analagous to a store that refuses to honor its advertised prices . The SEC requires market makers to buy or sell , from anyone who wants to trade , usually at least 1 # 000 shares of stock at the bid or asked prices it posts . When a stock ' s price is moving_up or down , market makers may be afraid that they will suffer losses if they honor their quoted prices . So they refuse or ignore an offered trade . They might falsely claim that someone else was &quot; ahead &quot; -- i.e. , that the market maker just sold the required amount of stock to another customer or market maker at that price . For individual investors , backing_away means they end_up having to pay more to buy a stock , or get less for selling it . It also delays execution of customer orders , which can cost customers money if the stock price is quickly changing . * Trading through : Market makers continue to trade with the investing public at their quoted bid or asked prices , ignoring offers that are better for customers . The customer who put_in the better priced order often doesn ' t get_it filled . Other investors never know about these pending orders , and miss out on an opportunity to buy stock at less than the quoted ask price or sell at more_than the quoted bid_price . Trading through benefits the market makers because they get_to charge the full spread . Critics say this is a fundamental flaw of the Nasdaq market , since it prevents some investors from knowing what other investors are willing to pay_for a stock at a given time . * Trading ahead : Also known as front-running , this refers to a market maker buying or selling for the firm ' s profit ahead of an order from the firm ' s own customer . When a customer places an order that is likely to move the market -- on Nasdaq even relatively small orders can have a big affect on a stock ' s price -- the firm might buy or sell ahead of that order , profiting later from the price move from the customer ' s order . This can also result in the customer getting a worse price , if his brokerage_firm trades ahead of his order and snaps_up all_the stock at the best available prices . This has long been illegal on NYSE , and many other exchanges . Since June , a limited ban on this has been in_effect on Nasdaq . Impact of Nasdaq &quot; Spreads &quot; Stock transaction on the Nasdaq routinely cost small investors more_than big , institutional investors . Consider these parallel transactions in the shares of a hypothetical firm , XYZ Co. : SMALL INVESTOR Jane Smith buys 300 shares of XYZ stock . Almost certainly , her order will be executed at the asked price , $ 10.50 per share . So she pays $ 3 # 150 . Two weeks later , XYZ stock ' s price hasn ' t changed , so a disappointed Smith decides to sell . As a small investor , she almost certainly will get the bid_price , $ 10.00 per share . So she gets_back $ 3 # 000 . Her net loss on a stock that hasn ' t budged -- $ 150 , or 4.8 % -- is the direct result of the 1 / 2-point spread , the 50 cents-per-share difference between the bid and asked prices . If you add in the commissions she ' ll pay her discount brokerage -- $ 76.79 on the purchase plus $ 75.80 on the sale -- Smith ' s total loss climbs to $ 302.59 , or 9.6 % of her investment . The stock price would have to rise 10 % just to break_even . BIG INVESTOR Major Pension_Fund buys 4 # 000 shares of XYZ stock . As a big , institutional investor , Major can get a price &quot; inside &quot; the spread , buying_at less than the asked price -- in this case , $ 10.25 per share . It pays $ 41 # 000 . Two weeks later , Major again goes inside the spread , selling at $ 10.125 per share . The pension_fund gets_back $ 40 # 500 . The fund ' s net loss of $ 500 amounts to just 1.2 % of its investment . The effective spread on its transaction was just 1 / 8 point . As a big investor , Major is able to negotiate much smaller commissions as a percentage of its investment . So between the narrower spread and the lower commissions , XYZ shares would have to rise far less for the pension_fund to break_even .</TEXT>
