   <HEADLINE> ARGENTINA CRACKS_DOWN ON THE UNDOCUMENTED ; LATIN_AMERICA : ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS USED TO FIND WORK EASILY . BUT HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT IS RESTRICTING ' FALSE TOURISTS. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was always easy for &quot; false tourists &quot; from neighboring nations to come here as if on a holiday , then stay to work and even settle permanently . Hundreds of thousands of Paraguayans , Bolivians , Chileans and Uruguayans have made that journey . In an amnesty for illegal immigrants that ended early this year , 230 # 000 of them won the right to stay legally . And thousands more keep coming every month . Just as the United States is North_America ' s magnet for illegal immigrants , Argentina is the South_American hot spot for falsos turistas . But now , although they still don ' t face as_many hurdles as do undocumented workers in the United States , false tourists are having a harder_time in Argentina . With record unemployment of 10 % in Argentina , undocumented workers have become increasingly controversial , and authorities have been under pressure to crack_down . Isaac Riveno , who came as a false tourist three years ago , ended_up on the outskirts of Buenos Aires in a slum of dirt streets and ramshackle houses called Esperanza , which means hope . He found a job in a factory that makes brass fittings and settled his wife and three children in a tiny brick house with two rooms that he bought for $ 650 , a little more_than his monthly wage . Riveno , 25 , started his legalization process under the recent amnesty . But he is having trouble getting_through all_the red_tape required for an Argentine resident ' s card , which his factory boss wants to see . The boss is under pressure from tax inspectors to provide documentation for all workers . &quot; He didn ' t say he would fire me , but he was in a fix and needed the document , &quot; Riveno said . Riveno and his boss are feeling the pinch as Argentina grapples with illegal immigration . It isn ' t exactly a full-scale crackdown . But with new measures , authorities intend not only to make_it more difficult for undocumented workers to cross the border but also to reduce their incentive to do so . The main lure is jobs , so that is the primary area where the government is tightening the screws . Aldo Carreras , secretary for population and community relations in the Interior Ministry , said the government ' s objective is to eliminate a &quot; labor black market. &quot; Tax inspectors have begun asking companies to show a resident identification_number , or at least a preliminary registration certificate for foreigners , for each person on their payrolls . Revenue agents will now do double duty , Carreras said in an interview , noting , &quot; They are also going_to be immigration inspectors. &quot; Because of the new measures , employers are growing reluctant to offer jobs to undocumented workers , Carreras said . He predicted that their reluctance will increase when Congress passes a bill that authorizes the government to fine employers $ 5 # 000 for each undocumented worker they employ . The bill has been approved by the lower house and is expected to win Senate approval soon . Jorge Gurrieri , national director of immigration , said his service is implementing new checks to detect false tourists coming_across Argentina ' s northern border with Bolivia and Paraguay . Immigration officers , for example , have begun asking to see tourists ' round-trip_tickets , the money they will spend during their stay and proof of their employment in their home countries . Still , he said , &quot; it ' s difficult to think_of a strict control at the border. &quot; Since the 1950s , Argentina and its neighbors have agreed that their citizens may cross the borders with no passport or visa , only a national identification card . To reverse that policy now , when Argentina is promoting economic integration with its neighbors , would be disruptive , Gurrieri said . And even if national policy called_for a wide-scale crackdown , Gurrieri and other experts agree that migrants would find ways to get_in . A major difference between U.S. and Argentine policy toward illegal immigrants is that Argentina rarely deports undocumented foreigners unless they are involved in illicit activities . Illegal immigrants who have job contracts are eligible to apply for permanent residence ; between 10 # 000 and 30 # 000 people a year receive resident status that way . Such applications , plus two amnesties , have given legal_status to about 600 # 000 undocumented workers since 1980 , the immigration service says . A new regulation prohibits employers from putting an undocumented immigrant to work before he or she has begun the legalization process and received a registration certificate , which can take weeks or months . And with today ' s high unemployment , fewer companies are willing to offer a contract to someone who can ' t work immediately , Gurrieri said . Manuel Farina , a lay leader in a Paraguayan Roman_Catholic mission that works with immigrants in Argentina , said such regulations are a subtle way to squeeze_out undocumented workers . &quot; It ' s a game they are playing to repress , to restrict , in an elegant way , &quot; he said . &quot; It appears as if there is an open-door_policy , but it is hard to get_in through that door. &quot; In his office on a shady street , Farina introduced Norma Fretes , a young Paraguayan who came_to Argentina as a false tourist and found a job as a domestic . After she asked the woman who hired her for a work contract , Fretes was fired . &quot; She scolded me and put me out on the street , &quot; Fretes said . Farina noted , &quot; The patrona doesn ' t want to get_into this mess of making a contract with an illegal. &quot; He estimated that there are 800 # 000 Paraguayans living_in Argentina , half illegally . Estimates of the total number of illegal immigrants in Argentina range from 400 # 000 to more_than 1 million . In this nation of 33 million people , illegal immigration has rarely reached such proportions that it has burdened services such_as public health_care and education . While children , theoretically , must possess an Argentine ID card to enroll in public_schools , administrators usually overlook the requirement , &quot; understanding that all children have a right to education , &quot; Gurrieri said . &quot; If they don ' t let them in the school , they are going_to be_on the street. &quot; Ramon Diaz Pereira , the diplomat in_charge of the Paraguayan Embassy in Buenos Aires , said illegal immigrants have full access to Argentine social_services . &quot; We have not had complaints of discrimination against our citizens , even the illegal ones , &quot; he said . Bolivian Ambassador Luis Lema said Argentina &quot; has been generous in the case of undocumented people , with social_services such_as health . I don ' t know of any discrimination for getting_into schools. &quot; Argentina is a nation of immigrants . In the late 19th Century and early 20th Century , great waves of people from Italy and Spain surged into the country and helped make_it the most prosperous in South_America . In recent decades , most immigrants have come from neighboring countries . Many have moved here to escape harsh military regimes , but most have come for low-skill jobs in agriculture , services , industry and construction . In Argentina today , a domestic can earn $ 600 a month , compared with as little as $ 50 a month for farm or domestic labor in Paraguay and Bolivia , two of the poorest countries in South_America -- and the two that send the most false tourists to Argentina . Until recently , immigrants were welcome because most of them filled jobs that Argentines disdained . But high unemployment has forced many Argentines to lower their sights . &quot; People are willing to accept work in any conditions , &quot; said Silvia Montoya , an official with a group that helps immigrants . Suddenly , undocumented immigrants are competing with Argentines , Montoya said . &quot; And suddenly , there is opposition to them by all these unions. &quot; Lelio Marmora , chief of the International_Organization for Migration in Buenos Aires , disagreed . He insisted that Argentines still generally reject low-paying or short-term jobs illegal workers get and that foreigners are being used as scapegoats . He said trying to keep illegal immigrants out is futile if they can ' t make a decent living at_home . &quot; The more repression there is with illegal immigration , the more illegality there is , &quot; he said . The only solution , Marmora said , is economic development that will raise wages in neighboring countries . Argentina ' s policy of seeking free_trade and economic integration with its neighbors is_on the right track because it will tend to equalize labor conditions , he said . Meanwhile , said Alfredo Agulleiro , secretary of social promotion for Buenos Aires , illegal immigrants are swelling slums in the metropolitan area . Many join takeovers of vacant land and buildings , and increasing numbers are occupying sidewalks as street vendors . Agulleiro ' s solution ? His department helps poor immigrant families find housing and social_services . It even assists them with the paperwork to become legal residents . &quot; There are social_workers to do that exclusively , &quot; he said . &quot; It isn ' t like the United States . Things are open here. &quot;</TEXT>
