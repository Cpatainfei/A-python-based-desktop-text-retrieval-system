   <HEADLINE> EASE REPRESSION OR LOSE FAVORED TRADING STATUS , U.S. WARNS CHINA ; RIGHTS : BEIJING IS CHALLENGED TO GRANT MORE FREEDOM FOR ITS PEOPLE BEFORE JUNE DEADLINE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reinforcing recent diplomatic warnings , the Clinton_Administration declared in its annual human_rights report Tuesday that China has taken only limited steps to ease repression of its people and must make more &quot; significant , overall &quot; progress_to retain most-favored-nation trading status . In effect , Washington challenged the Beijing regime to take dramatic measures to increase political and personal freedom before June , when President Clinton must decide whether the United States will extend most-favored benefits again to China . Should the thriving exporter lose the coveted status enjoyed by most U.S. trading partners , it would be forced to pay higher tariffs on most goods sent to this country . Many business groups want to continue the present trading relationship , despite widespread concern over Beijing ' s human_rights failings . But the President and majorities in the House and Senate have insisted on linking trade privileges with China to an improvement in the nation ' s human_rights record . Despite the Administration ' s apparent hard line , however , Human_Rights Watch , an advocacy organization , criticized the report , contending that it &quot; gives China more credit than it is_due , particularly in the areas of prison labor and religious persecution. &quot; The annual report , first issued in 1977 , is compiled from reports from U.S. Foreign Service officers , private organizations , journalists and other observers and now assesses the status of human_rights in 193 countries . For the first time , it includes an extensive assessment of how the rights of women are observed around the world . In its review of China , the report said that fundamental human_rights safeguards in the Chinese constitution frequently are ignored in practice , while challenges to the Communist_Party ' s political authority are often dealt with harshly and arbitrarily . The State_Department said that Chinese security_forces are responsible_for widespread torture , forced confessions and arbitrary detentions and that the government has failed to account_for thousands of people who were detained during the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Tien An Men Square . While Beijing took a_few positive steps by releasing some political_dissidents and allowing others to leave the country , the report said , it did not go_far enough . &quot; The ( Chinese ) government ' s overall human_rights record in 1993 fell far short of internationally accepted norms as it continued to repress domestic critics and failed to control abuses by its own security_forces , &quot; the report said . &quot; In 1993 , hundreds , perhaps thousands , of political_prisoners remained under detention or in prison . . . ( while ) physical abuse , including torture by police and prison officials persisted , especially in the politically restive regions with minority populations. &quot; John H . Shattuck , assistant secretary_of_state for human_rights , underscored the official line in a news_conference , saying : &quot; The report certainly shows a continuing climate of repression of political and human_rights in China . China in no way meets the standards set_out by the President. &quot; In presenting the document to Congress on Tuesday , State_Department Counselor Timothy E . Wirth praised China for releasing several prominent political_prisoners but issued a warning meant to be heard half a world away by the aging Communist leadership : &quot; The Chinese government must demonstrate , over time , steady and substantial benefit in human_rights &quot; to retain the most-favored status that nearly all other U.S. trading partners enjoy . &quot; We have a long way to go , &quot; Wirth added , suggesting that the United States would require annual reviews of human_rights gains in China before extending it trade benefits . Rep . Christopher H . Smith ( R-N.J. ) said that he is concerned that the report might be &quot; whitewashing egregious Chinese crimes. &quot; But California Rep . Tom Lantos ( D-Burlingame ) , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on international security , international_organizations and human_rights , said he is persuaded that most-favored status will be revoked unless China makes major changes in the next few months . Meanwhile , the report predictably indicated that Iran , Iraq , Myanmar , Haiti , North_Korea , Sudan , Zaire and Cuba are among the most repressive regimes in the world . But in a somewhat surprising development , the State_Department declared , &quot; There are no known political_prisoners in Russia. &quot; The report contained some criticism of longtime U.S. allies , including Turkey , Mexico , Thailand and even Israel , along with detailed accounts of repression in Africa , the Middle_East and Asia . Some of the most damning indictments of summary executions and other misconduct by police and military_forces were directed at Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs , who were accused of waging a &quot; brutal campaign of terror -- in which acts of genocide took_place &quot; to establish an expanded Serbian state . But it also reported Bosnian government atrocities , chiefly against Bosnian Croats . The report noted that &quot; positive human_rights developments &quot; occurred in Israel last year , with court decisions that expanded prisoners rights and placed more restrictions on the Israeli practice of demolishing the homes of Arab prisoners convicted of terrorism . But , citing what it described as &quot; credible sources , &quot; the report also said that undercover security units disguised as Palestinians were responsible_for the deaths of 27 Arabs in the occupied territories in the first 11 months of 1993 . There also were &quot; credible reports &quot; that Israel &quot; in some cases tortured Palestinians during arrest and interrogation , utilized undercover units implicated in extrajudicial killings &quot; and otherwise followed a &quot; harsh &quot; policy in dealing with Palestinians in the occupied West_Bank and the Gaza Strip . While coercion used to force confessions from Palestinian suspects was far less severe than the torture common in the prison systems of many other Middle Eastern countries , the report said , Israel ' s interrogation practices violate internationally accepted norms and include &quot; forced standing or tying_up in contorted positions , prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures , blows and beatings , confinement in a small space ( and ) sleep and food deprivation. &quot;</TEXT>
