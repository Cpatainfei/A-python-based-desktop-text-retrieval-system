   <HEADLINE> DECISION ' 94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA ' S ELECTIONS ; PROPOSITIONS ; 188 : REGULATES SMOKING STATEWIDE ; WHAT IT IS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This initiative statute , devised by cigarette manufacturers and funded almost entirely by tobacco firms , would reverse a decade-long trend in California by mandating the repeal of all local smoking bans and instituting a single , far looser , statewide smoking policy . * Relaxed Standard : Proposition 188 ' s standard would permit California business owners to allow smoking in sections of virtually all indoor workplaces , including restaurants , offices and factories . The Legislature could alter the statute by a two-thirds vote . * Ventilation : The measure would allow restaurants to set_aside 25 % of their floor space for smoking sections . Owners of restaurants and other businesses that opt to permit smoking would be required to meet air ventilation standards created by a trade group known as the American Society of Heating , Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers . The tobacco_industry had representatives on the American Society of Heating committee that drafted those standards in 1989 . At least one tobacco company , Philip Morris , the main backer of Proposition 188 , has contributed money to the organization . * Repeals Local Bans : The initiative would repeal local smoking bans in Los Angeles and scores of other cities and counties in the state , and would prevent local_governments from regulating tobacco use in the future . A recent Los Angeles County counsel opinion said passage of the initiative would prohibit counties from banning smoking even in museums , libraries , hospitals and other local_government buildings . * The Main Target : The main target of the initiative is a new statewide indoor smoking ban passed_by the Legislature and signed into law by Gov . Pete Wilson earlier this year . Authored by Assemblyman Terry B . Friedman ( D-Brentwood ) , the smoking ban would take_effect in January , unless the initiative passes . The Friedman bill would prohibit smoking in almost all indoor workplaces , including restaurants , shopping_malls , offices and factories statewide . Friedman ' s bill would prohibit smoking in bars by 1999 , unless the state can develop standards ensuring that nonsmokers would not be harmed by secondhand smoke . The Friedman bill would permit local_governments to pass even stronger smoking restrictions . * Minors ' Access : Proposition 188 claims it would limit cigarette sales to minors by restricting their access to vending_machines . Currently , 156 cities ban or significantly restrict cigarette vending_machines locally . The initiative would repeal those ordinances , and cities no longer would be allowed to regulate vending machine cigarette sales if Proposition 188 passes . It could also repeal a new law specifically aimed at blocking minors ' access to cigarettes . * Advertising : The initiative says cigarette billboards cannot be placed within 500 feet of schools , although billboards are designed to be read from such distances . Proposition 188 ' s restrictions would not apply to street-level cigarette ads that commonly are placed in_store windows . ARGUMENTS FOR Business owners should have the right to determine their own policies on smoking . Restaurant owners should be permitted to set_up smoking sections to accommodate smokers and nonsmokers . Ventilation standards contained in the initiative will reduce discomfort to nonsmokers from secondhand smoke and allow smokers to light_up in public places . Differing smoking standards in various locales confuse the public and are unfair to businesses . By stripping cities and counties of their right to regulate smoking , and imposing one standard across the state , California no longer would have a patchwork of local smoking ordinances . Standards in the initiative , though far weaker than what is contained in the law due_to take_effect in January , would be stronger than those in cities and counties that have not imposed local smoking prohibitions . The measure would limit minors ' access to tobacco , and limits on the placement of billboards would reduce the number of cigarette ads that reach children . ARGUMENTS AGAINST The tobacco_industry wrote , funded and organized the campaign for Proposition 188 . If the measure passes , tough anti-smoking laws adopted in various cities will be wiped_off the books . Cigarette consumption will increase in California if smokers are permitted to smoke in what now are smoke-free places . Several studies have shown that thousands of people die annually from cancer and heart_disease because of secondhand smoke . Nonsmokers will suffer ill effects from other people ' s smoke if businesses once again are allowed to permit smoking . Although the initiative ' s backers claim that California needs one standard for smoking , the state will have one standard in January when the Friedman bill , the nation ' s toughest anti-smoking law , takes_effect . The billboard restriction is meaningless because children would still be able to read the ads from 500 feet away . They would not , however , be able to read the surgeon_general ' s warnings that smoking causes cancer , heart_disease and is addictive . WHO SUPPORTS IT Philip Morris USA , the nation ' s largest cigarette maker and manufacturer of such brands as Marlboro , donated two-thirds of the $ 7.8 million raised by the Yes-on-188 campaign , as of the most recent campaign finance report . Other tobacco firms gave almost all_of the remainder . Some bar and restaurants owners also are backing the measure . WHO OPPOSES IT The California chapters of the American Cancer Society , American Lung Assn. , American Heart Assn. , California Medical Assn. , California Restaurant Assn. , California Labor Federation and former Surgeon_General C . Everett Koop . Gov . Pete Wilson and his challenger , Treasurer Kathleen Brown .</TEXT>
