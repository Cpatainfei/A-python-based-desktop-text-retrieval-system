   <HEADLINE> NEW EAST EUROPE RETAILERS TOLD TO PUT_ON A HAPPY FACE ; COMMERCE : WESTERN FRANCHISERS INSIST WORKERS DISCARD COMMUNISM ' S SNEER . RATHER , TAKE A SHOWER AND SMILE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was 7:45 a.m. -- 15 minutes before opening -- when the salesclerks at Kmart congregated in the menswear department for their daily dose of religion , free-market style . Two dozen women in bright red smocks gathered around a bargain bin of flashy neckties , their hands clasped reverently as a supervisor preached from the store ' s Ten Commandments of Good Sales . The capitalist lesson for today : Smile even if you feel lousy . Dress_up even if you prefer jeans . Oblige customers even if they treat you rudely . &quot; Look in the mirror every morning and make_sure the impression you give is a good one , &quot; boss Hana Pekarova said sternly . &quot; You are making money for the whole store. &quot; This was a familiar exhortation -- every morning begins with such recitations . But it was one that still invoked blank stares and painful winces among the unknowing and disbelieving . Customers scream even when it is not my fault ! one clerk confided . A customer threatened to never shop here if I didn ' t stop bothering her , another grumbled . Customer service -- that groveling prescript of capitalism that has brought the Free_World 30-minute pizza delivery , mufflers with a lifetime warranty and dentists who send birthday_cards -- has been a hard_sell in the former Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe . Five years of free_enterprise have stocked shops from Warsaw to Zagreb , Croatia , with consumer goods like never before . But converting the souls behind the counter has proved a more deviling pursuit . The notion of pampering the customer is so incongruous in former East Bloc countries that customer service has no linguistic equivalent in most languages , forcing exasperated tongue-tied employers to resort_to English . &quot; There is no miraculous place where you can send employees and have them come_back as different people , &quot; said Imrich Gombar , director of human resources for Kmart in the Czech Republic and Slovakia , where the company has taken_over 13 state-owned department_stores . &quot; We had to change the whole environment , from the management structure to the training process. &quot; Unsuspecting companies , frantic to capture the nascent market after the fall of communism , put virtually anyone on the sales floor , only to discover their front-line converts were unrepentant disciples of a system in which the &quot; customer is always right &quot; maxim had been turned_on its head . &quot; Because , under communism , everything from toilet_paper to bicycles was in short supply , it settled in the psychology of people that those behind the counter were in a superior position , &quot; said sociologist Jaroslava Stastna of the Central European University . &quot; It created a distorted relationship with the customer. &quot; At the highbrow , British-owned Hotel Bristol in Warsaw , the management interviewed 4 # 000 people before they found 290 who were considered suited for the hotel ' s doting customer-service program , so exacting it tallies pillow preferences ( foam or feather ) on a computer log of guests . Half of those who made the cut have since quit , many in search of less taxing jobs . Among its demands , the Bristol requires employees to bathe daily , wear deodorant , refrain_from eating garlic and spicy foods , keep a toothbrush and toothpaste on_hand , avoid nail biting , wear only clear nail_polish and keep fingers out of mouths , ears and noses . Their hair must also be washed daily and be kept &quot; restrained &quot; in_color and style . Above all , Bristol employees are expected &quot; to be happy and friendly , &quot; said Ingrid Eras , the hotel ' s personnel and training manager , who rejects 20 candidates for every job that opens . Some applicants are turned_away at the door , advised to return only after getting a haircut and fresh clothes . &quot; The discipline we require has been the hardest part for most people , &quot; Eras said . &quot; It is not easy telling people to completely change their thinking and personal habits , that what they have been doing for the past 15 or 20 years is wrong. &quot; Among Eras ' successes is sales director Agnieszka Jasinska , who started two years ago as a bleach-blonde clerk with bright red nails . Jasinska said her family was shocked when she cut her hair , threw_away the bleach , stripped the nail_polish , bought pin-striped suits and toiled without complaint for 12 hours a day . &quot; I am a very different person today , &quot; said Jasinska , now a natural brunette . &quot; I had colleagues who couldn ' t take the pressure , especially the demanding guests . It took a long_time . But I now realize it doesn ' t matter_to guests if I have problems at_home ; they still expect the same service. &quot; Putting_on a happy face has been one of the least popular and most ridiculed notions of customer service in the former Communist world , where service with a sneer was long considered a badge of honor and duplicity was tolerated but despised . Under communism , restaurants and shops often kept registers in which dissatisfied customers were to lodge complaints . But waiters and salesclerks were so ornery and intimidating that most customers didn ' t dare pencil an entry . Even if they did , the scribblings were usually ignored or the complainers unceremoniously shown the door . &quot; Being nice is forced under capitalism , just like being rude was under socialism , &quot; said Polish satirist Jacek Fedorowicz in a popular radio_broadcast chronicling changes in Poland . &quot; A human_being does only what it pays him to do , and under capitalism it pays to be nice and smiling. &quot; Grazyna Lobaszewska , a training consultant for McDonald ' s restaurants , said Central and Eastern Europeans are perplexed by Western expectations that unhappy emotions be put aside until after work . McDonald ' s , for example , insists that Polish employees smile when they are in contact with customers , a requirement that strikes many as artificial , insincere -- even sinister . &quot; If he is smiling , I am sure he is laughing_at me , &quot; Fedorowicz said of the counter help , echoing a commonly held fear . But just as the fast-food giant installed showers in its 17 Polish restaurants to address &quot; the delicate issue &quot; of spotty personal hygiene , McDonald ' s has urged managers to delve into the personal problems of employees and juggle work assignments accordingly . Workers preoccupied with an illness at_home , for example , are assigned to the kitchen instead of the food counter so their worries are not taken_out on customers . Customer service does not have to translate into cultural insensitivity , Lobaszewska said . &quot; It is not unusual for someone in the United States who has a big problem at_home to say , ' Fine , thanks , ' when asked at_work how he is doing , &quot; she said . &quot; Our tradition is different . When you have something on your heart , you don ' t hide it. &quot; Even sensitive employers , however , have occasionally resorted_to grand schemes to shake_up the staff and demonstrate how seriously they take the new vaulted status of the customer . At Kmart , Gombar yanked the door frame from the Prague general_manager ' s fifth-floor office and deposited it on the ground_floor , the store ' s busiest retail area . The message : Under capitalism , sales work is just as valued as traditionally esteemed managerial tasks . The store also astonished its clerks when it required them to wear name_tags proclaiming , &quot; I am here for you. &quot; The clerks balked , insisting the tags be revised to say , &quot; We are here for you , &quot; a concept more in_line with Communist-era practices , when lazy salespeople would snarl at advancing customers , then sit_back and enjoy the anonymity of their numbers . Kmart refused to change the tags and has since made some clerks squirm further by introducing another threatening nicety : an American-style pin saying , &quot; T.L.C. ( Think Like Customers ) . Ask Me What It Means. &quot; To motivate the staff , the company is rewarding its cheeriest clerks with 20 % monthly bonuses , determined in part by an undercover team of customers that completes a 17-question survey after snooping around the store . &quot; You cannot build an American system here , but we can get as close as possible , &quot; Gombar said . At Delta Air Lines , the largest American carrier with routes in the former East Bloc , role_models were deemed the best way to introduce new employees to the Delta way of business . An army of Delta employees from the United States and Western Europe were deployed for &quot; side-by-side &quot; training with counterparts in Poland , the Czech Republic , Hungary and Russia . New employees are also flown to corporate headquarters in Atlanta for a down-home lesson in customer hospitality , which includes a frank discussion about the bottom_line : Nine in 10 dissatisfied customers don ' t complain ; they simply don ' t come_back . &quot; Peer pressure is one of the best ways to change behavior , &quot; said Anna Van Exel , assistant manager for customer service training . &quot; If the acceptable thing is to provide good customer service , then it creates a good environment for the others. &quot; Even the guards at Prague Castle , residence of Czech President Vaclav Havel and one of the most popular tourist attractions in this tourist-crazed capital , are working_on their people skills . Now sporting designer uniforms ( a gift to Havel from Hollywood costumer Theodor Pistek ) , a handful of guards have enrolled in Dale Carnegie self-improvement courses . At a recent evening session , the guards joined an Avon lady , a doctor , a soldier , a yellow-pages salesman , a computer_programmer , two college_students and a dozen others hoping their $ 1 # 000 investment will help make friends and influence enemies -- and maybe advance them in the ranks along the way . School President Temi B . Miller said the course teaches that &quot; a true smile comes from within &quot; and that through self-discovery it is possible to reverse the bad habits of communism . Castle guard Martin Bernasek , a skeptic who was sent by his commander to a class in the summer , was so taken by it that he now assists other students . Bernasek is still not a big advocate of matter-of-fact smiling . ( It degrades the value of a real smile , he says. ) But he said the Czech Republic would be a much happier place if more people enrolled in such courses . It is not only a matter of undoing communism , he said , but changing a centuries-old &quot; mind-set of subjugation &quot; that dates to the Austro-Hungarian Empire . &quot; People have been acting this way for 300 years , &quot; he said . But some companies have shied_away_from such self-help programs , instead crossing their fingers and trusting employees to pick it up_on the job . Others forked out huge sums for training , only to have employees quickly revert to old habits . Many simply barked out new instructions and hoped for the best . At the towering Bila Labut department_store in Prague , a worn 60-year-old shopping_center that was recently sold to private owners , a young saleswoman was asked why she was smiling at passing customers . &quot; We are supposed to , &quot; she replied . Why ? A long pause followed . &quot; I don ' t know why , &quot; she said with a puzzled look . Did anyone tell you why ? &quot; No . I wasn ' t told anything. &quot; At a nearby counter , a scowling senior colleague looked_on disapprovingly , then buried her name_tag beneath her sweater when approached by a reporter . Private ownership means saying the wrong thing to the wrong person could get you in_trouble , she said . &quot; Under communism we would speak_to you , but not anymore , &quot; she grunted . Although the unfriendly clerk disobeyed the directive to deliver service with a smile , she had mastered something her grinning counterpart had not . She had grasped what training experts say is one of the least understood principles of customer service in Eastern Europe : that the behavior of individual employees is linked to the prosperity of the business , and vice versa . It is a lesson repeated day after day at the century-old Prague Secondary Commercial School , a vocational center for teen-agers preparing_for careers in retail sales . Between 10 % and 20 % of students are dismissed each year because they are caught stealing from the shops where they serve as apprentices , making honesty second only to courtesy on the school ' s lesson plan . School_Principal Jindrich Brtnicky said stealing was common under communism as well . But it is taken more seriously now because private shop owners , who sponsor students , are unwilling to absorb the losses like state-owned enterprises once did . &quot; The great problem is both grown-ups and kids still don ' t feel part of the firm where they work , &quot; Brtnicky said . &quot; The way of working under the previous system is still in each of us . It has left a stain on us that might take a generation to remove. &quot; Down the hall in a classroom for aspiring retailers , 16-year-old Olga Zaluska professed to have solved the problem . When she graduates , she said , she does not intend to repeat the mistakes of her mother , a longtime salesclerk who seldom smiles at_work . A self-described entrepreneur , Zaluska said she plans to open her own store . Murphy was recently on assignment in Prague .</TEXT>
