   <HEADLINE> CLINTON TRIP , MOSCOW SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In response to &quot; Competing With Bobbitts and Ice Skaters , Summit Falls_Short , &quot; news analysis by Thomas Rosenstiel , Jan . 15 : The headline that the &quot; summit fell_short , &quot; that there were no &quot; enduring images that would capture a nation &quot; is far from the truth , as witnessed via television coverage , and by your own Jan . 16 news analysis by Paul Richter and Doyle McManus , which states &quot; . . . many of those scenes made strong images back home . . . Clinton consorting with Havel , hero of democracy and culture &quot; and &quot; in the Kremlin , &quot; etc . On television , we witnessed the signing of a new agreement removing nuclear missiles from the Ukraine ; President Clinton walking through a historic Jewish cemetery ( a far_cry from Bitburg ) ; we saw him lighting a candle for his mother in a recently refurbished centuries-old Moscow church which the communists had turned_into a public_toilet ( a photo you published , Jan . 14 , without noting the historical context ) . And we saw meetings , an endless round of purposeful meetings with leaders of new and old_countries , hour after hour , all happening immediately following the burial of President Clinton ' s mother , which the press seems to have already forgotten . BARRY GREENFIELD West Hollywood Rosenstiel complains that Clinton ' s aides don ' t have the media savvy that Ronald Reagan ' s did to create enduring images . that ' s OK . I like what Clinton is doing . And I could have done without some of the enduring images from the Reagan years like the Iran-Contra hearings ; the HUD scandal ; and a conveniently forgetful ex-President Reagan in a witness_box . BRENDAN JAMES O ' BRIEN Santa Monica I was born a Republican , but now have begun to have an open mind about politics and the future of our beloved United States . So many political figures seem to be bigoted , narrow-minded and even cruel . This was very apparent during the death and funeral of President Clinton ' s mother . Our President ' s heart must have been heavier than usual , losing his beloved mother and facing the burden of the summit in Russia . But he went_on with his duties with a stoical smile that endeared him to almost everyone . With the admirable job he did under stressful conditions , I think Clinton deserves high marks for his brilliant diplomatic astuteness . MILDRED E . KORDENAT Laguna Beach In the town_hall meeting in Moscow ( Jan . 15 ) , President Clinton stated that he would not trade places with President Boris Yeltsin . I wish President Clinton every success as our chief_executive , but he will probably not be another Washington or Lincoln . Like Washington , Yeltsin is the first president . Like Lincoln , Yeltsin for an awesome moment embodied &quot; government by the people &quot; as he stared_down the fascists during the coup attempt . President Yeltsin will be a watchword for democracy as long as it exists . CHARLES S . BUNNELL Northridge So , President Clinton has set Russia on_the_road to democracy . Please , why not invite a Russian to this country to deal with our problems . What about shelter for the homeless ? What about jobs for the millions out_of_work ? ELEANOR POST Azusa I was reading my morning_Times and the main stories were_on President Clinton ' s recent successes in the former Soviet_Union and Middle_East . It appears to me that the President has done much in his first full year in office . He not only had Ukraine give_up its nuclear arsenal ( which is pointed at our country ) but was also able to persuade Syria to commit to a peace_treaty with Israel ( Jan . 17 ) . Last year , he passed the national budget in record time and got the health_care debate off to a good start , as well as_many other significant accomplishments . But back in Washington , waiting for our President to return from a historic trip , is Republican leader Bob Dole . I , for one , do not care if Bill and Hillary Clinton had investments in a failed thrift . George_Bush ' s son was a director of the failed Silverado Savings and Loan and nobody really cared about that . Furthermore , in the past 12 years , between the Reagan and Bush_administrations , at least a dozen investigations took_place , which included the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages scandal . And what happened to those presidents ? Nothing . I care primarily about our national_leaders ' job performance , and if our President is competent enough to move our country out of this economic depression and keep me out of a war , then he has my support . Let the President govern and get our nation back on its feet , and Bob Dole , start being a constructive political_leader . RICHARD HAMEL Orange</TEXT>
