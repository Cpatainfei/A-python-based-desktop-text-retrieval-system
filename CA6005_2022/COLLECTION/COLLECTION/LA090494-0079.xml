   <HEADLINE> COFFIN_NAILS HAILED : ' CUT HEALTH COSTS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Smoking may be bad for your health but it aids the economy because it kills people before they become a health-care burden , says Canada ' s largest tobacco manufacturer . &quot; A person who dies of lung_cancer at age 70 will not be hospitalized later with another disease , &quot; said a study commissioned by Imperial Tobacco touting the benefits of early death in smokers on the health-care system . &quot; . . . Anti-smoking groups rarely consider the reduction in health costs resulting from the premature death of certain smokers ; and yet , this calculation must be made in_order to avoid serious error , &quot; said the study , written by Montreal economist Jean-Pierre Vidal . Vidal ' s report sparked protests Friday from anti-smokers . &quot; The idea that life has no value is incredibly offensive , &quot; said David Sweanor , senior legal counsel for the Non-Smokers ' Rights Assn . lobbying group . &quot; It is terribly offensive from a human standpoint . It misses what human life is really about. &quot;</TEXT>
