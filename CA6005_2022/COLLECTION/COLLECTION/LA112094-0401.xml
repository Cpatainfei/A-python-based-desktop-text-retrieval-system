   <HEADLINE> NATO GETS OK TO HIT BACK AT SERBS IN CROATIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After two days of cross-border attacks by Serbian militias on an isolated U.N. &quot; safe area &quot; in Bosnia-Herzegovina , the U.N. Security_Council authorized NATO warplanes Saturday to attack targets in Serb-occupied sections of Croatia . By a unanimous 15-0 vote at a rare weekend emergency session , the Security_Council decided that North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization aircraft may pursue Serbian attackers across the border to Croatia in response to bombing raids on the predominantly Muslim enclave of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia . Acting on the resolution , ambassadors from the 16 NATO nations meeting in emergency session in Brussels early today agreed to extend the possible use of air_power . Hours earlier , Serbian warplanes based in Croatia attacked the Bihac pocket for the second consecutive day , dropping bombs around Cazin , 15 miles north of the town of Bihac . The raiders appeared to be aiming at an ammunition factory , but they instead strafed a residential_area , a U.N. spokesman said . At least 15 people were injured . One of the attacking planes was shot down by groundfire and its pilot killed , the spokesman added . The Security_Council action closes a loophole that had , in_effect , given Serbian forces a sanctuary in the occupied Krajina region of Croatia from which to launch attacks on the nearby Bihac area . Planes based in Krajina need only spend a_few minutes over Bosnia to attack targets around Bihac . The council had earlier authorized NATO to enforce a &quot; no fly &quot; zone over Bosnia , but diplomats said that authority to attack violators did not stretch into Croatia . The Security_Council decision was not retroactive , so no NATO action is expected unless the Serbs strike again . Even then , the procedures for launching attacks are cumbersome , requiring approval by both NATO and U.N. military commanders . So far this year , NATO planes have shot down four Serbian light attack_aircraft violating the &quot; no fly &quot; zone in February and hit Serbian ground targets in Bosnia in August and September . Robert E . Hunter , the U.S. ambassador to NATO , said in Brussels that the alliance showed its resolve today to act promptly if attacks resume on Bihac . &quot; We turned the key and are ready to go , &quot; Hunter said . Bosnia ' s U.N. ambassador , Muhamed Sacirbey , complained that Saturday ' s U.N. resolution was inadequate and unnecessary . He said NATO and the United Nations already have authority to protect Bosnian civilians in all designated safe areas , including Bihac , and argued that the Security_Council vote only delayed needed action . But other diplomats said the resolution was required to eliminate any doubt about NATO ' s mandate . The Security_Council action permits NATO to target Udbina airfield , which was used to launch the attacks Friday and Saturday . Madeleine Albright , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and this month ' s Security_Council president , said Udbina is an &quot; ongoing threat &quot; to stability in the region . The United States has not committed ground troops to the U.N. peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslav federation , but U.S. planes participate in NATO air operations . NATO has used the existing authority sparingly , but Secretary_General Willy Claes said Friday that the alliance is ready to act more forcefully if the Serbian attacks on Bihac continue . The attacks on the Bihac area , apparently by a combined force of Bosnian Serbs and Croatian Serbs , is considered especially dangerous because it could touch_off another wave of refugees into already overcrowded areas under the control of the Croatian government . If the Serbs succeed in taking most of the Bihac pocket , they will have effectively united all_of the territory they have conquered in Bosnia and Croatia . Serbian forces now control about 70 % of Bosnia and about one-third of Croatia . The United States and Western European_nations have warned the Croatian government to stay out of the fight for Bihac to avoid reigniting war in Croatia , where a U.N. truce has held since January , 1992 . Croatian President Franjo Tudjman , in a letter to the Security_Council on Friday , gave his consent to NATO action over his country . About 1 # 200 poorly equipped Bangladeshi U.N. peacekeepers are trapped in the Bihac region , unable to get food and other supplies . The U.N. command is trying to get Dutch peacekeepers into the region , but the surrounding Serbs refuse to permit them to pass .</TEXT>
