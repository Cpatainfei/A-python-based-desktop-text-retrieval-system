   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : OXNARD ; STREET STILL CLOSED AMID OIL CLEANUP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Traffic remained blocked along Harbor Boulevard in Oxnard on Tuesday while crews hired by Bush Oil Co . continued to clean_up as much of the 84 # 000 gallons of heavy crude_oil as possible . But by late Tuesday , workers had made no measurable progress on the cleanup , reporting instead that the number of gallons recovered to date is stalled at about 61 # 000 . Workers dressed in protective clothing cleared_away wide patches of brush_on the west_side of Harbor Boulevard , while crews on the opposite side of the street prepared to remove the aging pipeline from under the road . Also Tuesday , the number of birds killed from the county ' s worst pipeline spill in decades increased by 25 . Officials said 163 shore_birds have died so far , with another 27 reported injured . State officials said Tuesday that corrosion inside the pipe may have caused an 18-inch split along a seam in the section dug_up earlier this week . Chuck Samo of the State Fire_Marshal ' s Office said the split likely was not caused by currents from nearby pipelines ' electric safety devices . &quot; Interference causes corrosion outside the pipe wall , &quot; Samo said . &quot; No one reported to me that they saw any external corrosion on the pipe. &quot; Studies have shown that 59 % of pipeline leaks are caused by external corrosion . But officials said they do not suspect that to be the case in the Bush Oil spill . &quot; The top two ( causes ) on the list obviously are structural failure or internal corrosion , &quot; said Bill Guerard of the state division of oil and gas . Officials at Taft-based Berry Petroleum , which owns Bush Oil and is responsible_for the costs of cleaning_up the spill , declined to comment Tuesday on what may have led to the pipe ' s corrosion . The Harbor Boulevard closure between Gonzales Road and Olivas Park Drive will continue through 3 p.m. today . JEFF McDONALD</TEXT>
