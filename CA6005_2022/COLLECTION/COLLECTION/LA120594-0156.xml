   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG : TELEVISION ; REVEALING GAYNESS ON TV TERMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When is it appropriate for a gay_man to announce his sexual orientation in front of a television_camera ? Is November better than December ? January is out because of the Super Bowl . But is February better better than March ? Naturally April would n ' t do . Already too crowded . You know , Easter , National Secretaries Day , the start of Daylight_Savings . But is May better than June ? Forget summertime , which is vacation time . Fall brings school . October ? What , and be eclipsed by the buildup for Halloween ? Man , oh man . Is nothing ever simple for our friends in television_news ? All right , let ' s see if we have this right . Garrett Glaser , who reports on entertainment for KNBC-TV Channel 4 , wants to acknowledge on the air that he ' s gay . According to a Times article last week , he had hoped to do so in a story especially relevant to the gay community , one that was to have run last month . But the story was canceled when other stations acquired the ever-coveted list of mini-documentaries Channel 4 planned to run during the November ratings sweeps . * Why would this cause Channel 4 to abort or alter its initial sweeps agenda ? Don ' t ask . Anyway , Channel 4 ' s acting news director , Kenny Boles , says there now are no &quot; specific plans &quot; for Glaser to use a Channel 4 newscast to announce his gayness -- something Glaser has previously acknowledged in print , by the way . But Boles says that if Glaser were allowed to declare his sexual orientation in a Channel 4 newscast -- which Boles regards_as &quot; an important thing to do &quot; -- it would be something the station would consider for the February or May sweeps . It ' s nice to see a gay person who ' s open about his sexual orientation . Even in relatively sophisticated Los Angeles , such declarations can harm careers . Yet the more who do &quot; come_out , &quot; the easier it is for other gays to follow_suit and rip the closet door from its hinges . But oh , brother ! What Boles appears to be saying is that Channel 4 will allow Glaser to affirm his homosexuality in a Channel 4 newscast only during a ratings sweeps , one of those monthlong periods of intense audience measurement that are crucial to setting local advertising rates . In other words , the Glaser story , touted as relevant to gays , apparently is relevant to gays only during a ratings period . Otherwise , forget it . Glaser told The Times he was unconcerned about the change of plans . Boles did give Glaser &quot; permission &quot; to acknowledge his homosexuality during an October stint on Marilu Henner ' s syndicated talk_show that airs on Channel 4 . Permission ? As if the station owned the airwaves or had the right to veto or even regulate Glaser ' s non-workplace comments about his sexual orientation . You ' d think by now , given the publicity his homosexuality has received outside Channel 4 , that anything Glaser said about his sexual orientation on the air would be redundant . In case some haven ' t gotten the skinny , however , this column is ready to assist Glaser in spreading the word . If you are a Channel 4 news viewer , read this now : GARRETT GLASER IS GAY ! By the way , I had planned to disclose my heterosexuality today , but my editors at The Times ordered me to delay my announcement until after Christmas . * REAL BULL . That characterizes KCOP-TV Channel 13 ' s advertising_campaign for its again-slender &quot; Real News &quot; at 10 p.m. After bombing with a costly , over-produced , heavily promoted 10 p.m. hour -- in which walk-around anchors and other choreography often overshadowed the news -- Channel 13 returned to its former half-hour size last May . Old dimensions , new promotional twist . It appears the station was only joshing when it touted its previous fatter product . After telling viewers for months that its news hour was indispensable , Channel 13 now boasts that its latest effort -- a variation of its pre- &quot; Real News &quot; half-hour that always badly trailed other 10 p.m. newscasts in the ratings -- is even more indispensable . Why ? Because , say the revisionist ads , it provides the same news as the 10 p.m. competition in half the time . Saving precious minutes for &quot; Last Call , &quot; the grating syndicated series that follows . You applaud the ingenuity . Now , if only KCOP could think_of a way to provide the same news in just 15 minutes . Or no minutes . * MR . TUBERHEAD . It turns_out that Dan Quayle is not the only one with a Potatogate problem . John D . Ibson of Claremont writes_about my review of the recent &quot; Scarlett &quot; miniseries on CBS : &quot; I was astonished and disappointed to see you casually refer to Irish country folk as the local potatoheads , a term no less offensive than ' fag , ' ' dago ' or similar epithets . . . . As an historian of the_Irish American experience , I ' m especially interested in how persons who aspire to tolerance nonetheless feel free to stereotype the_Irish quite unbecomingly , in ways they would never dream of dealing with blacks , gays or Jews , for example. &quot; And talk_about my double_standard , Doris Kelly Cantore of Calabasas noted how outraged I ' d be if someone on TV &quot; flippantly used insulting and demeaning words like ' bagelhead ' or ' tacohead ' to characterize other groups. &quot; These are a sampling of the angry responses to my &quot; potatohead &quot; reference ; all_of the callers and letter_writers concluding that this Rosenberg guy is either prejudiced or flat-out ignorant . Not much of a choice . Nonetheless , opting for No . 2 , I plead ignorance . Hard as it may be to believe , I had no idea that &quot; potatohead &quot; was derogatory . I was reaching for a colorful word , and came_up with this one , the wrong one . Obviously . I shouldn ' t have used it . Like that spelling monster , Quayle , though , I ' m educable . How do you spell nudnik ? H-O-W-A-R-D .</TEXT>
