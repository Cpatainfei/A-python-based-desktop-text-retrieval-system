   <HEADLINE> BERLUSCONI SOFTENS ITALIAN AUSTERITY PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi backed_away from the brink Thursday , tempering economic austerity with billion-dollar concessions and persuading labor_unions to scrap a nationwide general strike scheduled for today . The accord , reached in a marathon 21-hour negotiating session with the three main unions , followed a decision by Berlusconi ' s Forza Italia movement and its coalition partners to stay_together at least through the year . Labor_leaders , who had mounted a general strike and a million-strong rally in Rome against Berlusconi in recent weeks , expressed satisfaction with the compromise reached Thursday over the controversial 1995 government budget . Seeking to reduce Italy ' s sapping public deficit by $ 30 billion , the 58-year-old billionaire had proposed sharp cuts_in Italy ' s generous pension system . Thursday ' s agreement softened the blows , restoring full benefits to salaried workers who have completed 35 years of service , increasing social_security for large and poor families and boosting aid to the lesser-developed Italian south .</TEXT>
