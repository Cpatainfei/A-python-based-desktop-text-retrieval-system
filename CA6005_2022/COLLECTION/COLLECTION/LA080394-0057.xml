   <TEXT> Don Fehr , the baseball_players ' union executive_director , said Tuesday his organization had not received a $ 7 million to $ 8 million pension payment from the owners due Aug . 1 from All-Star game receipts . Richard Ravitch , the owners ' chief negotiator , said the decision to withhold the payment was understandable since technically there is no bargaining agreement in place , but Eugene Orza , the union ' s associate general counsel , called it &quot; an all-time low &quot; and couldn ' t predict how the players would react .
