   <HEADLINE> IN THE NAME OF THE CHILDREN ; GET TREATMENT OR GO TO JAIL , ONE SOUTH CAROLINA HOSPITAL TELLS DRUG-ABUSING PREGNANT WOMEN . NOW IT FACES A LAWSUIT AND A CIVIL-RIGHTS INVESTIGATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> IT ALL BEGAN , NURSE SHIRLEY BROWN AND HER COLLEAGUES AT THE Medical University of South Carolina now say , with the pregnant woman who appeared at the emergency_room one morning in October , 1988 . The woman was suffering from abruptio placentae -- an abrupt separation of the placenta before labor . Her fetus was stillborn . They ' d been seeing an increasing number of these abruptions at the hospital , a state institution in Charleston serving a largely indigent black population . The usual causes were conditions such_as high_blood_pressure or trauma such_as auto accidents . But the more recent cases didn ' t appear to have such causes . This case didn ' t appear to have any cause . Brown and her boss , Dr. Edgar O . Horger III , then head of fetal-maternal medicine at the hospital , turned_to the medical literature . In both professional journals and the popular press , they found , pregnant substance_abusers were a hot topic . The figures were startling : One out of 10 fetuses in the United States is exposed to cocaine in the womb , affecting 375 # 000 babies a year . To Brown and Horger , sitting in genteel Charleston , such numbers sounded like a big-city problem . Still , article after article was suggesting cocaine as one cause for abruptions . So Brown and her colleagues ran a urine drug screen on their patient . The woman tested positive for cocaine . That was ground zero , they all agreed later . Their eyes now opened , Brown and her colleagues started running drug screens on other pregnant patients . Of the first four , three tested positive . Within one year , they had 119 positives , all but 15 of them women who ' d first visited the hospital at the time of delivery . They still didn ' t have a solution , though . Try as she might , Brown -- a manager for high-risk obstetrical cases -- could not get these women to the Charleston County Substance_Abuse Commission . Despite counseling and cajoling , not a single woman kept her appointment for drug treatment . Of the 15 who came_in before delivery , only one even came_back for additional prenatal care . The hospital next saw the others when they returned in pre-term labor and once again tested positive for cocaine . What to do ? How to stop this ? What to do , the hospital staff eventually decided , was to cross a treacherous line . Prosecutors across the country , they knew , increasingly were going_after pregnant substance_abusers , charging dozens with distribution to minors and child_neglect . We will join them , Brown and Horger resolved . If our patients test positive and refuse treatment , we ' ll hand them over to the law . At the time , it seemed an ideal , if unprecedented , solution . The goal , after all , was not to put these women in jail ; the goal was to coerce them into treatment . But not everyone has applauded . Nor has everyone entirely shared the hospital ' s preference for treatment over jail . The decision to traffic with police and prosecutors , in fact , has drawn the hospital into an increasingly nasty quagmire , one that is as rich_in calculated political posturing as in tortured ethical soul-searching . Does society have a duty to intervene between a woman and her fetus ? If so , when ? Who or what public agent is responsible ? What are the boundaries of government intrusion ? For having kicked_up such questions , hospital and Charleston officials now face a $ 3-million civil lawsuit , a federal civil-rights investigation , a complaint filed with the National Institutes of Health and a chance of losing the hospital ' s federal funding , if not its accreditation . Everyone from the American Civil Liberties Union to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has rushed here to join what is at once a revealing test of difficult national issues and a scorching clash between law and medicine . All sorts of agendas , reaching well beyond the perplexing world of medical ethics , are being played_out in Charleston . New York lawyers jump_off airplanes waving the Constitution and stacks of legal_briefs . Southern politicians lean into microphones to orate about &quot; personal responsibility. &quot; Feminists , hearing obvious echoes of the abortion debate , talk_about control of the body and autonomy in the reproductive process . Such repercussions , coming from forces so far beyond their own world , have visibly shaken Horger , Brown and others on the hospital staff . They have not , however , persuaded them to back_down . Brown and Horger see the complexities , the imponderables , the obstacles , but they also see spontaneous_abortions , pre-term deliveries , stillbirths and underdeveloped newborns with jumpy nervous_systems . &quot; It ' s a real difficult issue here , &quot; Shirley Brown says . &quot; I can see both sides , I can see where everyone ' s coming from . But don ' t we finally have to make a decision ? Don ' t we finally have to make a choice ? &quot; IT WAS IN AUGUST , 1989 , THAT BROWN MADE HER FATEFUL DECISION TO call Charles Condon , at the time the elected solicitor , or prosecutor , for Charleston and Berkeley counties . By then , MUSC ' s drug-testing program had evolved considerably from its genesis nine months before . At first , the hospital ' s criteria for such screening had been informal , if not random ; when doctors suspected a patient_of substance_abuse , for whatever reason , they simply ordered a test . This approach had made some at the hospital uneasy . Might they be ordering tests for other_than medical reasons ? Might they be ordering tests because the patient was poor or black or sullen or not like them ? Virtually all those getting screened and testing positive , after all , were indigent blacks . Listening to such concerns , it occurred to Brown that MUSC could be accused of discrimination . So in April , 1989 , seeking to standardize the process , the hospital adopted a more formal protocol . Drug screens would be ordered for patients with any of six indicators : no prenatal care ; abruptio placentae ; intrauterine fetal death ; pre-term labor , intrauterine growth retardation and previously known drug or alcohol_abuse . Using these criteria , MUSC still found that it was mainly screening poor blacks -- in part because they compose much of the hospital ' s patient pool -- but hospital staffers no longer felt as uneasy about the selection process . Instead , they worried about the results they were seeing . Month by month , the number of positive drug screens at the hospital kept rising . By summer , a full quarter of screened patients were testing positive for drugs -- up_to 24 a month . Not one went_for drug treatment . Brown and Horger felt more_than frustrated ; they felt they were witnessing a crime . Cocaine , they knew , easily travels through the placenta to the fetus . There is no conclusive evidence about the drug ' s lasting impact on infants , since follow-up studies are scarce , and anecdotal reports of &quot; neurobehavioral problems &quot; don ' t separate cocaine ' s impact from influences such_as poverty and family instability . But its immediate effects were often apparent at MUSC . Withdrawal , irritability , lethargy , stiff muscle_tone , problems sleeping and eating , cardiovascular dysfunction , aversion to loud sounds or handling -- doctors could usually spot the exposed newborns . It seemed to Brown and Horger that these were abused children . If so , wasn ' t the hospital staff legally responsible ? Weren ' t they morally responsible ? &quot; We were not trying to rid the streets of cocaine , &quot; Horger recalled . &quot; We were trying to stop harm to the fetus. &quot; The Charleston solicitor ' s interest , however , proved somewhat different . Charles Condon nearly climbed out of his chair when Brown and others from MUSC , sitting in his office , revealed that they ' d identified and treated more_than 100 pregnant substance_abusers in the past 12 months . &quot; This has been going_on ? &quot; he demanded . &quot; This has been going_on ? &quot; In Condon ' s view , the hospital had been doing nothing less than harboring criminals . He had a little problem with the fact that they ' d known about cocaine users for a year . The hospital , he believed , had to report these cases once they had viable fetuses . Condon ' s response reflected , in part , his particular bent . A Charleston native from a large Catholic family , Condon is , at 41 , running_for state_attorney general after 12 years as county solicitor , a post he first won at age 27 -- &quot; the youngest circuit solicitor ever elected in the history of South Carolina , &quot; his resume proudly notes . A Republican , Condon possesses the type of unabashed political streak that leads him to reveal , out of sheer delight , the pragmatic calculations -- Who could complain ? Who has an interest in this ? -- that shape his positions . &quot; that ' s the real_world &quot; is among his favorite observations . But even more_than his personal propensity , Condon ' s response reflected a growing pattern in law_enforcement across the country . With medical advances giving fetuses ever more social recognition , a number of prosecutors have been inspired to treat fetuses as children . In the past decade , they ' ve charged more_than 160 pregnant substance_abusers in 24 states with_child neglect and distribution of drugs to minors . That appellate_courts have overturned virtually every conviction on such charges , flatly rejecting the notion of applying child protection laws to fetuses , was no discouragement to Condon . &quot; It ' s nice you came_in , &quot; Condon told Brown and the others sitting before him . &quot; But the fact is , you have to come_in . There ' s no patient-doctor privilege on this . If you don ' t report it , it ' s a crime. &quot; From there , events moved rather swiftly . Together with Charleston Police_Chief Reuben Greenberg , Condon called an interagency community meeting to &quot; develop a policy as_to possible prosecution &quot; of pregnant substance_abusers . Within three weeks , this task_force had hammered_out its plan . That same day , Police Capt . R.H. Roberts explained it in a memo to all central detectives , declaring it &quot; effective immediately. &quot; When a prenatal patient at the hospital tested positive , she would be counseled , usually by Brown , then presented a letter from the solicitor offering to defer prosecution if she successfully completed a drug treatment program . If she refused , failed to complete or tested positive again , MUSC would notify the police , who would issue an arrest_warrant . If a patient was already at the stage of delivering a child and she or the baby tested positive , there would be no such warnings or second chances . The Department of Social_Services would be notified to take the newborn , and the woman would be arrested immediately after her release from the hospital . The hospital contact in all cases would be Shirley Brown . If the fetus was &quot; viable , &quot; the charges would include drug distribution and child_neglect . The basis for arrests would not be limited to positive drug-screen results ; written or oral statements made by the patient to &quot; third_parties &quot; would suffice . There were , it should be said , more_than a_few expressions of early concern at the hospital about this &quot; interagency policy , &quot; as it came_to be called . A medical resident named Birgit Pols expressed discomfort about acting_as an arm of the law . She was distressed that MUSC was applying this policy only to a selected population of indigent blacks ; if nurses and doctors screened everybody , she knew from studies and private reports , they ' d be amazed at how many positives they ' d get . Kathleen Straight , then nurse manager of the neonatal intensive-care unit , told a documentary_film team that she thought it dangerous to be setting infants against mothers and labeling substance_abusers and their babies as bad . The medical director of the neonatal intensive-care unit , Dr. Celeste Patrick , wrote the Medical University president to point_out &quot; serious flaws &quot; in the program , including insufficient drug-treatment facilities in Charleston and &quot; thinly veiled discrimination against . . . poor black women. &quot; The hospital ' s general counsel , Joseph C . Good Jr. , worried about legal liability as well as other problems . In one letter , he asked the police to obtain a subpoena for medical_records when they came calling with arrest_warrants , in_order &quot; to protect the Medical University . . . from any allegations of breach of confidentiality. &quot; In another letter to a senior assistant state_attorney general , he wrote , &quot; This is not a perfect program . . . . I would prefer to have the mothers sign an informed consent for a drug screen . . . . I would also prefer the DSS be notified rather than law_enforcement . . . . The other weakness in this program is that the main prosecutions have been against black indigent mothers . . . . &quot; Such moments of hesitation , however , apparently were overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of those in_charge . In fact , according to neonatologist Patrick , the hospital warned doctors that &quot; nonsupport &quot; of the program &quot; may result in revocation of our MUSC-provided malpractice insurance. &quot; Months later , perhaps as a result , Horger could not even recall the plan ' s early critics . &quot; Not only didn ' t I have a problem with the policy , I was happy with it , &quot; he said . &quot; I welcomed it . I thought at the time it was right. &quot; By then , though , the hospital ' s objections might not have mattered . In joining hands with the world of law_enforcement , the medical_community plainly had lost considerable control . By the time MUSC ' s board of directors officially adopted the interagency policy on Nov . 27 -- some six weeks after Capt . Roberts ' memo had declared it &quot; effective immediately &quot; -- the arrests had already begun , without use of subpoenas . Pregnant substance_abusers ' first awareness of the new policy usually came not from the hospital but from their television_sets . There they began seeing a series of public-service announcements featuring the county solicitor . &quot; And not only will you live with guilt , you could be arrested , &quot; Condon explained in one spot . &quot; This is a tragedy you can prevent . . . . If you stay with the ( treatment ) program , you won ' t be arrested . Wake_up from the nightmare . Think_about your baby first . . . . &quot; Since MUSC was the only high-risk obstetrical center within 50 miles for indigents , even those frightened by Condon ' s words had little choice but to go there , particularly if they depended_on Medicaid . Once at the hospital , they had to sign a general consent for medical treatment that -- without explicitly saying so -- allowed , among many other things , a drug screen . Those who tested positive soon found themselves receiving visits from Shirley Brown . Those unpersuaded by Brown soon found themselves being introduced to a police_detective . It is hard to verify all these women ' s stories , partly because many are homeless or rootless . Those who do come_forward do so in the foreign milieu of their attorneys ' offices , where it is difficult to get past carefully phrased statements that often , in their personal details , happen to dovetail nicely with the lawyers ' general legal arguments . Nonetheless , it seems clear that at least some of those arrested were taken from their hospital_room hours or days after delivering and led to jail in handcuffs and shackles . Others sat in jail_cells waiting to give_birth , then , when in_labor , were brought by ambulance , in handcuffs and shackles , to the hospital . One tells of being seized in a chokehold , near full-term , and escorted forcefully into treatment . Most describe impoverished lives supported by food_stamps , Aid to Families with Dependent Children and , in some instances , prostitution . Several talk_of backgrounds full of missing husbands , mentally_ill parents and early shunting to foster_homes . Virtually all make_a_point of calling Brown &quot; nasty &quot; or &quot; cold &quot; or &quot; degrading. &quot; &quot; Shirley Brown and another nurse came_to my room and told me my baby tested positive , &quot; said Ellen Laverne Knight , recalling the day she delivered her third child at MUSC in November , 1989 . &quot; I gotta sign this and do more tests , they said . Next day , they brought my roommate ' s baby to her , but not mine . Nurse Brown was a bitch . She came and said I had to go_into a room to talk to someone . It was the police . They said I have the right to remain silent . I found_out I was going_to jail . They brought my clothes , they handcuffed me , they put a sheet over my hands , they pushed me out_in a wheelchair . I spent the night in city jail without a sanitary_napkin . . . . &quot; Telling this story , Knight was sitting in a lawyer ' s conference_room in downtown Charleston , dressed in a business_suit . Drug-free after undergoing two three-month treatment programs , she spoke with composure , but also with obvious bitterness . Yes , she said , she ' d done coke two days before her baby ' s birth . But she took_care of her children , made them meals . She never got high in her home . Depression is what drove her to drugs , depression from being unable to find a job , depression from being unable to get her children ' s father to make court-ordered support_payments . &quot; It ' s hard to explain the reality of the addict , &quot; she said . &quot; When you get the urge , it overrides everything . I definitely would have gone_to treatment if they ' d offered . Instead , they sent me to jail and took my baby. &quot; After watching 10 such arrests in three months , Brown and others at the hospital felt compelled to remind the solicitor that they wanted patients going_to treatment , not jail . Automatically sending women to jail after they ' d delivered their babies was purely punitive , Brown pointed_out . Treatment would help after delivery as much as before . Everyone should get warnings , everyone should be offered treatment . &quot; Amnesty for all &quot; Condon called it , consenting only reluctantly to give options to those delivering , instead of hauling them directly to jail . For the good of the program , he ' d compromise -- but it rankled . &quot; The truth is , we have an abysmal record of prosecution in this , &quot; Condon said later . &quot; If we wanted to be punitive , we would have marched them down , given high bonds , packed that jail . If they want to see punitive , we can get punitive . This may be punitive in New York , but here , it ' s a kid-glove approach . Practically speaking , they ' ve got_to break_into jail to get there. &quot; Not everyone agreed . Agitated word of Charleston ' s program soon began to spread . One day in early 1990 , the phone rang in Lynn M . Paltrow ' s office at the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project in New York . Paltrow , then 31 , was already one of the nation ' s leading litigators responding to &quot; fetal rights &quot; cases , already one of the most visible warriors in the field of reproductive-rights law . Her caller wondered : Have you heard what ' s going_on in South Carolina ? ALTHOUGH THE CHARLESTON POLICY WAS IN SOME ways singular , its underpinnings were , to Paltrow , all too familiar . The same anti-abortion argument that she ' d been fighting for years -- the premise that the fetus has rights -- was exactly what she now was hearing across the country as justification for punishing pregnant substance_abusers . Although she didn ' t think all_the prosecutors in these substance-abuse cases were necessarily anti-abortion , she still feared the ramifications . After all , she reasoned , if it ' s a crime to endanger the life , health and welfare of a fetus , then virtually any action by pregnant women could become the basis for criminal prosecution . You could require women to take folic_acid , you could prevent them from having babies as teen-agers or after 40 , you could mandate what they eat , how they exercise , whether they have_sex . Paltrow already had served as co-counsel in virtually all_of the most critical early prosecutions of pregnant substance_abusers . She ' d successfully fought Jennifer Johnson ' s prosecution in Florida , Kimberly Hardy ' s in Michigan , Pamela Rae Stewart ' s in California . Now , in early 1990 , South Carolina seemed to be presenting a still larger battlefield . This was about even more_than women ' s rights or fetal rights . This was about civil_rights and racial discrimination . This was about sane public-health policy . It didn ' t take Paltrow long to find a host of esteemed professors , doctors and medical groups that agreed . The list eventually included such experts in their fields as Dr. Barry Zuckerman , chairman of the department of pediatrics at the Boston University School_of_Medicine and Boston City Hospital , and Dr. Jay Katz , professor emeritus of law , medicine and psychiatry at the Yale_University Law_School . In the mound of essays , declarations and studies on Paltrow ' s desk , these specialists offered all manner of objection to Charleston ' s policy . The policy , they argued , violates the right_to_privacy in medical information , the right to refuse medical treatment , the right to procreate , the right to equal protection under the 14th Amendment . The policy forces doctors to be cops and gives the judgment of doctors -- or nurse Brown -- the force of law . The policy treats drug_addiction as a crime rather than an illness and allows_for no relapses , which are expected at treatment centers . The policy frays the doctor ' s relationship with patients . The policy violates all notions of informed consent . The policy is tantamount_to human research , without the required approvals . The policy , no matter what criteria are used , targets poor blacks by screening only at an indigent center such_as MUSC . The policy leads society down a slippery slope -- if you ' re going after women for harming their fetuses , what about drinkers and smokers , whose behavior produces , overall , greater and more lasting harm each year than cocaine users ? Above all , the academics and doctors assembled by Paltrow argued that the policy , while mandating treatment if you want to avoid jail , ignores the fact that appropriate treatment programs for pregnant addicts just don ' t exist in the Charleston area . By &quot; appropriate , &quot; they mean outpatient programs that provide transportation and day-care and long-term residential programs where mothers can live with their children , isolated from the type of potentially violent male addicts they ' re all too familiar_with . On this point there can be little dispute . Until the recent opening of the Sojourner Center for Women , which serves only one ZIP_code in the city , there was no outpatient program in Charleston that offered day-care or direct door-to-door transportation ; there is still no residential program specifically for women and their children . The Department of Alcohol and Other Drug_Abuse Services ( formerly the Charleston County Substance_Abuse Commission ) , where MUSC directs most pregnant substance_abusers , counsels all kinds of abusers , often in group therapy sessions . MUSC itself , in applying for grants , has expressed &quot; serious concern &quot; that needed services &quot; are not available &quot; at the hospital or in the Charleston community . Counselors obliged to ask anxious , depressed mothers to leave their children and ride buses an hour or more across town readily confirm such concerns . Women will come , the counselors claim , only if they feel they and their children are safe . Otherwise , threats and coercion will just drive them away . That , some believe , is precisely what ' s been happening in Charleston . In a South Carolina medical journal article , at various professional gatherings and even in Condon ' s resume , the trio of Brown , Horger and Condon have hailed a &quot; marked &quot; decrease in positive drug screens -- from 24 to four or five a month -- but specialists such_as Zuckerman think this MUSC report &quot; deeply flawed. &quot; How do they know the hospital hasn ' t merely driven most substance_abusers away ? It is hard to judge all these arguments . It is true , for example , that Charleston is targeting poor blacks by screening only at MUSC -- but it is also true that the 1991 South Carolina Prevalence Study found black_women nearly six times more likely to use cocaine than white_women , and women without medical insurance 17 to 18 times more likely . While it is true that more appropriate treatment programs are needed , it is also true that no one really knows if such programs would attract all_the pregnant substance_abusers who now stay away . Whether to talk_about a &quot; failure of personal responsibility &quot; or &quot; the disease of addiction &quot; is in some way , finally , a question of philosophy , not fact . The central argument against coercion echoes that of many prominent medical organizations . The American Medical Assn. , the American Academy of Pediatrics , the American Nurses Assn. , the American Public Health Assn. , the March of Dimes -- in recent years they have all ringingly condemned the national trend toward use of coercion and legal threats . &quot; Criminal sanctions or civil liability for harmful behavior by the pregnant woman toward her fetus are inappropriate , &quot; resolves the AMA . &quot; The public must be assured of non-punitive access to comprehensive health_care which will meet the needs of the substance-abusing pregnant woman , &quot; proclaims the AAP . &quot; The threat of criminal prosecution is counterproductive , &quot; declares the ANA . As the debate in Charleston has developed , such statements have meant more and more to Paltrow , for they ' ve helped in her critical effort to keep the_matter from being framed as a collision between women ' s rights and fetal rights . This is the tricky heart of the controversy . Personally , Paltrow ' s heart goes_out to pregnant substance_abusers ; having grown_up on Long_Island watching her parents regularly march for social justice , she is one of those inclined to talk_about &quot; the disease of addiction &quot; and &quot; the burdens of poverty. &quot; But she knows these substance_abusers are enormously unpopular with others . She knows that , as impressive as the intellectual arguments might be in favor of women ' s reproductive rights , they pale for many in the face of a sickly newborn twitching from a cocaine rush . She knows she ' d lose support , even among those committed to women ' s rights , if people felt forced to choose between pregnant substance_abusers and their babies . The medical_community ' s policy statements provide Paltrow with a way to avoid this perilous choice . &quot; Even if you care only about the baby , even if you don ' t give_a_damn about the mother , you should still oppose Charleston ' s policy , &quot; Paltrow finds herself able to argue . &quot; All evidence is , this frightens them away from prenatal health_care that ' s good for the baby . You can ' t punish the woman without punishing the fetus . You need to come_up with policies that help both . Threats don ' t make_sense . Jail doesn ' t make sense. &quot; That sentiment is , in a sense , the heart of her case . To challenge Charleston ' s policy in court , however , Paltrow needed not just experts and arguments . She also needed clients who ' d actually been prosecuted . So she sent feelers to South Carolina attorneys , and she waited . Not until early last year -- by then she ' d left the ACLU to co-found the Center for Reproductive Law &amp; Policy in New York -- did Paltrow locate the women she wanted . One was Crystal Ferguson , a tall , thin , outspoken 31-year-old African American who had not taken_kindly_to her treatment at MUSC . She lived_in a trailer with two sons , 10 and 11 , and a daughter , 2 . She was happy to join a civil suit ; she thought someone should pay_for what they ' d done . She ' d been using drugs when she became pregnant with her little_girl , she told Paltrow and Susan Dunn , a local Charleston attorney who ' d joined the case . But she hadn ' t considered herself an addict . She thought she could stop using , she thought she had it under_control . She went_to a local health clinic for prenatal care , where she denied drug use , since she ' d seen the solicitor talking on TV and was afraid of being arrested . Instead , she tried to overcome her addiction herself , but couldn ' t . At 32 weeks , she was referred to MUSC , where she tested positive for cocaine . You go_to a residential substance-abuse program for two weeks , Shirley Brown informed her , or you get arrested . At first , Ferguson agreed , but when she went_home to pack , &quot; I saw the situation my kids were in . There was no one to take_care of them . Someone had stolen our food_stamps and my unemployment check while I was at the hospital . There was no way I was going_to leave my children for two weeks , knowing the environment they were in. &quot; She called the hospital and asked if there was a place she could go_with her sons . Told there was not , she refused treatment and avoided prenatal care the last two months of pregnancy . She returned to the hospital only to deliver a full-term baby girl -- and to once again test positive for cocaine . The other woman was Theresa Joseph , a 35-year-old African American who came_to be known in court papers anonymously as Monica Roe . Small and flashy looking , with light skin and a Yankee accent , she was more reluctant to fight than Ferguson ; she was more inclined to disappear than stand her ground . Yet she , too , was angry . Supported by AFDC and disability_payments , she had a 10-year-old son who lived with her and other children living elsewhere . She ' d used drugs during her pregnancy , she told Paltrow and Dunn , and avoided prenatal care entirely because Condon ' s TV announcements frightened her . She ' d ended_up at MUSC anyway because of a severe foot infection . There , Brown , learning of her history of drug use , came_to visit . Joseph had heard about Brown , had heard people talk_about her as if she were a witch . Brown told her she ' d lose her baby and go_to jail if she didn ' t go_into treatment . Afraid of being arrested , she left the hospital that night -- just put_on her clothes and ran_out . Later , realizing she needed help , she returned to the hospital to ask Brown for entry into a treatment program , but they gave her an appointment for 3 1 / 2 weeks later . By then , she ' d lost her nerve and didn ' t keep the appointment . She next came_to MUSC in pre-term labor at 7 1 / 2 months . They didn ' t let her see her baby after it was born . The baby , Shirley Brown told her , had tested positive for cocaine . In both cases , MUSC had called the police , who ' d arrested , handcuffed and led the women to jail , Ferguson from her home , Joseph from her hospital_bed . Ferguson felt_like she was dying ; Joseph screamed and cried as they led her away . At bond hearings , David Schwacke -- Condon ' s successor as solicitor -- had charged them with distribution of drugs to a minor . Ferguson stayed in jail 11 hours , Joseph three weeks . &quot; I now understand more about addiction , &quot; Ferguson said in an affidavit to the court . &quot; I was a sick_person . I made a mistake , but MUSC did not make_it better . The staff was very insensitive , especially nurse Shirley Brown . . . . I was just another black drug_addict to them . . . . They locked me up like I was a mass murderer . If someone had offered me a program where I could have brought my children , I would have gone . . . . &quot; Getting Ferguson and Joseph ' s cases dropped would prove to be the easiest of Paltrow ' s legal tasks . Few South Carolina judges were buying the attempt to treat fetuses as children ; in 1992 , a state appellate_court had tossed_out the child-neglect conviction of a pregnant substance_abuser , basically ruling it a nonexistent charge . So when Paltrow and public_defender Ted Phillips -- supported by the American Public Health Assn . and 17 other medical and civil_rights groups -- moved_in May , 1993 , to quash the distribution charges against Joseph and Ferguson , Schwacke surrendered without a fight . By agreeing to dismiss the charges against those two and rescind the bench_warrants on five others similarly charged , Schwacke hoped to preserve the Charleston policy ' s options and avoid an even worse legal precedent . Paltrow wasn ' t finished , though . In October , she filed a $ 3-million class-action complaint seeking compensatory and punitive damages as well as a preliminary injunction &quot; to prevent defendants from continuing to conduct an unconstitutional experiment on African-American women . . . . &quot; In January , she filed a formal complaint to the National Institutes of Health Office for Protection from Research Risks , accusing MUSC -- because it published a medical journal article -- of &quot; conducting research on human subjects , including our clients , &quot; without the review and approval required by the National Research Act . In February , the federal_government , perhaps taking the cue , revealed it had opened a civil-rights investigation of the MUSC program . Civil rights investigator Roosevelt H . Freeman started knocking_on doors and asking questions in Charleston . By then , four more women had come_forward , signed affidavits and joined the lawsuit . For the moment , Paltrow seemed on a roll . The hospital ' s medical staff was reeling and ducking . That week , several MUSC doctors declined invitations to testify in the state_capital about pregnant substance_abusers , while others didn ' t even return phone_calls from the hospital ' s own public-relations office . Soon enough , though , a certain resistance to Paltrow ' s attack became apparent . Soon enough , the abiding aversion in the South Carolina low country to pregnant substance_abusers , and to folks from out of state delivering moral instruction , began to emerge . When the federal civil_rights investigator asked the county solicitor to document everything he said -- every trifling fact , every off-hand statement -- more_than a_few began to grumble . &quot; that ' s not the way it ' s done down here , &quot; Schwacke later observed . &quot; Down here , people trust each other. &quot; CHARLESTON IS A UNIQUE place , at once civilized and disinclined to embrace imported notions . On the winding cobblestone and brick roads of this gracious but insular Southern town of 80 # 000 , dozens of grand Colonial and antebellum homes are still occupied by direct descendants of the families that built them in the early 1700s . Cannons on the East Battery still aim across the confluence of the Cooper and Ashley rivers at Ft . Sumter , as they did at the start of the Civil War . This is a town that was flourishing well before the Revolution under management of a sophisticated aristocracy , leaders who grew wealthy in the rice , indigo and slave_trades , leaders who were the first to fire on and secede from the Union . References here are to &quot; our cocaine problem , &quot; not &quot; our interagency policy problem. &quot; Charleston ' s policy is still in place ; Shirley Brown still requires women who test positive to choose , sometimes on the spot , between treatment and immediate arrest . &quot; There ' s no controversy here , &quot; announces Reuben Greenberg , Charleston ' s purposefully provocative police_chief , as he paces about his office , eyes glinting . &quot; Only California types and ACLU types are bothered by this , and no one cares about those types here . They have no power here. &quot; That surely is overstatement , but not by much . The policy ' s supporters are many , and they are little swayed by Paltrow ' s pile of briefs , reports and affidavits . They are more impressed by the fact that of some 200 women facing prosecution under the policy , 154 went_to treatment and only two of the 46 arrested actually received sentences . They remain impressed even when told that no one really knows what happened to those women once in treatment . How can you say we ' re driving patients from prenatal care , they ask , when most substance_abusers never even come for prenatal care ? How can you say women don ' t go_to drug treatment because existing programs are &quot; inappropriate , &quot; when most haven ' t even tried them once , haven ' t even seen what they ' re like ? How can you say doctors shouldn ' t cooperate with the law , when they already must report everything from gunshot wounds and rapes to child_abuse ? How can you compare cocaine to alcohol , when one is legal and one illegal ? How can you say cocaine ' s impact isn ' t lasting when its enormous cost drains a world of shrinking medical resources ? It is not hard to see why this last point draws particular attention from the policy ' s supporters . The average initial hospital visit for a cocaine-exposed baby costs $ 24 # 000 at MUSC , compared to $ 500 for a normal delivery . One drug-exposed baby stayed a year , costing $ 731 # 000 ; then his mother delivered another drug-exposed infant who stayed four months and cost $ 167 # 132 . What with developmental follow-up , special_education and foster care , one federal report calculates the total cost of each drug-exposed baby at $ 1 million . When not talking_about such cost issues , Charles Condon focuses_on the theme of personal responsibility . &quot; Are we really to blame society ? &quot; he asks . &quot; These women want day_care and free transportation , but who ' s taking_care of their kids when they ' re on coke ? Who ' s providing transportation to go get the drugs ? Suddenly they ' re supermoms who won ' t abandon their kids . That these two women want a South Carolina jury to give them $ 3 million for what happened to them . . . . It ' s frightening . If we can ' t act in situations like this , when can we act ? &quot; Equally adamant is Police_Chief Greenberg , who readily addresses the charges of racial discrimination . A black Jew ( by way of his Russian immigrant grandfather ) , a former Berkeley activist , a onetime sailor , rodeo bull rider and college professor , he is a man given far more to irreverence than Southern gentility . He is also a man given regularly to expressing impatience with &quot; all that psychological sociological crap &quot; that blames criminal activity on impoverished social conditions or bad parenting . Once , at a drug forum in Washington , D.C. , after listening to Lynn Paltrow explain that cocaine wasn ' t permanently damaging , he rushed up_to her , got right in her face , even though they ' d never met . &quot; How can you say that ? &quot; he demanded . &quot; Cocaine mothers are killing their babies ; how can you say that ? &quot; Sitting in his office another day , he explained : &quot; I see hordes of people , mainly black , walk_around in a daze . The drug crisis has a tremendous impact on the black community . I would n ' t care if it were all blacks who got arrested . This policy is helping black kids . The racial aspects don ' t bother me . God , this whole political correctness thing . . . . &quot; With that , Greenberg jumped up and fell on his knees . &quot; I pray for when the majority of blacks in jail are there for tax_evasion , &quot; he said , raising his arms to the ceiling . &quot; Then we will have made_it -- then we ' ll be part of the American scene. &quot; In the end , those in Charleston and elsewhere who support the policy just don ' t buy Paltrow ' s effort to close_off the fetal-rights debate . To them a mother and a fetus ' s interests are not always the same . To them , what ' s most important here is not abortion rights or women ' s rights or civil_rights . To them , what ' s most important here , finally , is the health of the child when born . &quot; I ' m not a lawyer , &quot; Shirley Brown said with a shrug . &quot; I have two patients , mother and unborn child . One patient can talk , one can ' t , and people on drugs don ' t always make the best decision for themselves . Sometimes you ' ve got_to choose between your two patients . We took the stance that you ' ve got_to choose for the unborn patient. &quot; Speaking these words , Brown was sitting in the hospital ' s public-relations office , having arrived 90 minutes late for an interview . She blamed her delay on the need to deal with an agitated addict high on heroin and cocaine . The legal complaints and news media commotion , she said , &quot; create an ominous portrait and make patients very apprehensive . You take people using drugs , who already are afraid , and make them more afraid . This is making my job harder. &quot; The mother of a 19-year-old daughter , Brown is an earnest woman in her early 40s , born and raised in small-town South Carolina , who enjoys piloting a private plane around the state in her off hours &quot; to see the world from a different , more peaceful perspective. &quot; Watching her march into a room with self-assured composure , hearing her speak evenly and directly , even the more generous involved in the Charleston controversy have felt inspired to call her &quot; steely. &quot; Now , however , she sounded more wounded than belligerent . She was raised in a religious home , Brown explained ; she was raised in church . Her parents -- her dad had a small insurance agency , her mom worked in a bank -- loved her , loved her two sisters . Sundays , the whole family would get_together with her mom ' s seven brothers and sisters , the gatherings full of children , the cousins like siblings to her . Family mattered , she believed . Children are a precious asset , children are our future , children are our dreams . She didn ' t understand this furor , she didn ' t understand why people thought her a witch , she didn ' t understand why people didn ' t want to help children . &quot; You start to talk with care and compassion , &quot; she said of her visits with patients . &quot; But you must make them understand . So you tell them -- get treatment , don ' t get arrested , I don ' t want you arrested . But if you continue using drugs , you . . . will . . . be . . . arrested . I don ' t yell . I also don ' t say &quot; -- here Brown momentarily adopts a soft , cooing voice -- &quot; ' don ' t worry about it. ' I tell them some have been arrested . that ' s why they get upset . If you ' re on drugs , and you ' re told you will go_to jail if you don ' t stop , and you don ' t want to stop , then the person telling you is mean. &quot; Brown blinked hard , her face flushed . &quot; How would you feel ? &quot; she continued . &quot; How would you feel ? I ' ve had patients looking through their pocketbook to get a card from that attorney ( Lynn Paltrow ) to sue me . ' You can ' t make me go_into treatment , ' they say . ' You ' re violating my rights . I ' m going_to call this attorney. ' How ' d you like it if you were threatened with a lawsuit each time you walked into a room ? &quot; After two hours of conversation , her visitor rose to leave , but Brown did not want to stop . &quot; No patient was publicly seen being arrested at MU , &quot; she said . &quot; It was always done low-key and quietly . Plainclothes officer , cloth over the handcuffs , out the back_door , unannounced . . . . We ' re trying to help pregnant women . . . . I don ' t know anyone who ' s perfect. &quot; Her visitor now at the door , Brown still couldn ' t let_go . &quot; How would you like it ? I can combat the truth , but this , what they ' re saying about me . . . . Once said , there ' s no recovering . . . . Do you see that bad , mean monster nurse Brown ? Is that what you see ? Does_it look_like I have horns ? Is that what you see ? &quot; &quot; THIS IS NOT YOUR GARDEN VARIETY case , &quot; a visibly disgruntled U.S. District Judge C . Weston Houck muttered during his first morning of exposure to the various arguments in the case titled Crystal Ferguson and Monica Roe vs . City of Charleston et . al . &quot; This is going_to be a complicated constitutional case. &quot; That was_on Wednesday , Feb . 16 , at a hearing called to consider Paltrow ' s motion for a preliminary injunction . Charles Condon and Shirley Brown were sitting at the defendants ' table , Paltrow and Susan Dunn and two other lawyers at the plaintiffs ' table . Within minutes , it was apparent that Paltrow ' s momentum had hit something of a brick wall_in Judge Houck . Called to speak first , Paltrow , having spent hours the night before preparing , rose clutching a legal pad full of notes . The mission she faced was daunting ; to get an injunction , she needed to prove her two particular clients faced imminent , irreparable danger . &quot; I would like to begin . . . by explaining what we ' re not asking_for today , &quot; she said . &quot; We are not asking this court to enjoin MUSC from counseling its pregnant patients -- &quot; that ' s about as far as she got . &quot; Tell me what you are asking_for , &quot; Judge Houck interrupted . MUSC does &quot; a lot of things . And I can ' t go_down to everything . . . . &quot; Paltrow tried again . &quot; All that we are asking this court to do is to restore ( MUSC ) to what it is supposed to be -- a health-care facility , not a conduit to jail -- &quot; &quot; Look , look , look , look , look , look &quot; the judge interrupted again . &quot; Tell me what you want . . . . I don ' t need all that surplusage . . . OK ? &quot; Paltrow tried shifting from description to legal argument , but that didn ' t work either . &quot; How is that going_to the failure for me to grant relief ? &quot; Houck asked . &quot; How is that going_to cause your clients irreparable harm ? &quot; Paltrow tried summarizing her claims . &quot; that ' s what the lawsuit is all about , &quot; Houck barked . &quot; that ' s been done . I can ' t stop that by a preliminary injunction. &quot; Paltrow tried citing case precedents . &quot; Just hand me those cases , &quot; Houck growled . &quot; But I mean , it doesn ' t do any good_for_you to read cases here in court . I can ' t read them now and hear your argument as well. &quot; As the day wore_on , it grew harder and harder to ignore the good ol ' boy routines . The more the judge addressed Bobby Hull , local attorney for the hospital , the more their voices thickened into a distinct Southern drawl . The term &quot; fussin ' at &quot; began appearing with some frequency , as in Hull ' s suggestion that &quot; it ' s the state they all fussin ' at , not the individuals. &quot; ( By suing MUSC , a state institution , Paltrow is effectively suing South Carolina. ) Although the judge called the hospital ' s lawyer &quot; Mr. Hull , &quot; he could not bring himself to address Paltrow by name or even , at times , look directly at her . &quot; I believe there is some evidence the goal of this program has been achieved to some extent , &quot; Judge Houck said , upon finally revealing that he was going_to deny Paltrow ' s motion for an injunction . &quot; I do believe if the program continues , some mothers who are addicted and in prenatal care will not continue treatment . Then I must conclude that the discontinuation of the program is going_to cause at least one or more children to be born with addiction to drugs . . . . That is very serious harm . . . . The public undoubtedly is interested in its institutions not violating the constitutional rights of citizens . . . . I also believe that the public interest of this state is focused now , more_than probably at any other time , on drugs and ( their ) effects . . . . It may be that the public interest is not well founded . . . . It may be that they should be more concerned about the deprivation of constitutional rights of the plaintiff , but I really don ' t think that ' s the case . I think the public is concerned about children who , through no fault of_their_own . . . are conceived by a mother who is addicted to drugs . . . . To avoid that . . . is of great public interest . . . . &quot; Paltrow ' s obvious dismay and Condon ' s satisfied smile as they left the hearing told the whole story . There were many months to go , many_more chances coming for Paltrow to persuade and educate ; at a second hearing in early June , Paltrow would in fact prevail on several procedural matters . Still , if not readily apparent before , it was now : No matter how much you debate the issues and assemble the experts , this case was not , in the end , only about right or wrong , good or bad , legal or illegal , moral or immoral . This case was also very much about political will -- of what the public wants and will support . Condon , for one , understands this quite well . Just last summer , after all , Charleston residents -- including Mayor Joseph Riley Jr. , and Police_Chief Greenberg -- fought fiercely against locating a residential drug- and alcohol-treatment center near the city , even though it had federal funding and was to include precisely the type of residential facility that specialists believe would attract pregnant substance_abusers with_children . Expressing concern about the &quot; frequent mental dysfunction &quot; of substance_abusers , noting that &quot; even the best treatment programs are only partially effective , &quot; Greenberg declared that he &quot; would not like to see this facility located in my neighborhood or the proposed location. &quot; By the time everyone finally agreed last fall to build the facility near the MUSC complex , it was clear that the dispute , although ostensibly over location , was also being driven by a more fundamental fear and animosity . &quot; There was a great resentment against people who don ' t follow rules ending_up in a better position than those who do , &quot; is how Condon put it . &quot; Of people pulling the cart being told what to do_by those in the cart. &quot; Walking to the courthouse from his law office , Condon began to explain , with all_the relish of a pragmatic political_scientist , the principles underlying such community resistance . &quot; First , be cognizant that it takes taxpayer money to pay_for these programs , &quot; he advised . &quot; that ' s the real_world . So they must meet harsh tests : Are they necessary ? Bare bones ? You ' re handing out free food , shelter , access to better medical plans than we have . I ' m not at all against these programs , but you can ' t get resources for them ; there ' s not great support in this country for them . that ' s the real_world , just like there ' s not enough political will to move after pregnant women who use alcohol or cigarettes . There is , though , a political basis for this interagency program . Leaders can take a position against crack . Our legal_system reflects our cultural mores . that ' s our system . that ' s the real_world . . . . &quot; Condon stopped in mid-sentence , at the moment he reached the television_cameras waiting at the courthouse steps . Instantly , he turned from his companion and hit his cue . &quot; The left-wing ACLU doesn ' t represent the American people , &quot; he began , leaning into the microphone . &quot; The left-wing ACLU doesn ' t represent the people of South Carolina . MUSC deserves an award . If the plaintiff prevails , in_effect we ' d be legalizing the use of crack cocaine during pregnancy . . . . &quot; Staring into the camera , Condon posed the enduring question that so grips Charleston : &quot; Who is speaking_for the babies in this courtroom ? &quot; he asked . &quot; Who is speaking_for the babies ? &quot; Then Condon turned_back to his private conversation . &quot; Tell Lynn thanks for suing me , &quot; he smiled , as he walked into the courthouse . &quot; Running in South Carolina for attorney_general , the best thing you can have happen is to be sued by the ACLU. &quot;</TEXT>
