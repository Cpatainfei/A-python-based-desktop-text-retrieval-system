   <HEADLINE> THE WEEK AHEAD : MOSCOW ; RUSSIAN BUDGET BATTLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia ' s Parliament begins debate Wednesday on the government ' s proposed 1994 budget in what is expected to be a long and fractious session . Despite belt-tightening that cut subsidies to most industries , President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s draft budget forecasts a massive deficit -- over $ 36 billion , or 10 % of Russia ' s gross_national_product . The Parliament will face heavy pressure from Russia ' s cash-strapped industrial managers and regional leaders to restore the government subsidies on which Russian industry has long been dependent . The hardest lobbying may well come from the military , which received only $ 22 billion in the draft budget -- less than half of what the defense_department requested .</TEXT>
