   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND JAMES BATES : COMPANY TOWN ; EYES ON VIACOM AS PARAMOUNT WAR REVIVES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a holiday cease-fire in the marathon battle for Paramount Communications Inc. , analysts and others look_for Viacom Inc. to raise the stakes or cry &quot; uncle &quot; as early as Wednesday . Some insiders are betting that Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone will pull_out of the competition with QVC Network Inc. before bidding up a price that ' s already reached &quot; never-never_land , &quot; as he recently put it . But sources say the Viacom chairman still has some aces in the hole . One intriguing scenario has Redstone financing a higher bid with bank loans instead of outside investments , because the interest would be deductible . Redstone ' s main bankers -- which include Citibank , Morgan Guaranty and Bank of New York -- have already extended enough credit for him to best QVC ' s offer if he chooses to take that route . Banking sources say Redstone might be able to tap as much as $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion from the lenders , since he didn ' t take all_of the credit they initially extended . But the same sources say it ' s unlikely he will borrow much more , because the banks would exact stiff guarantees , including shorter periods to repay the money and various restrictive covenants . The value of the Paramount bidding has reached as much as $ 10.2 billion in the last few weeks . Lisbeth R . Barron , an entertainment analyst at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co . in New York , says that , based on current stock prices , Redstone needs about $ 600 million in cash to take_back the lead from QVC , plus a way of guaranteeing the value of the stock investors would receive . But Barron is also skeptical that Redstone would be able to raise the full amount through bank financing . She estimates that the Viacom chairman would be able to borrow only $ 200 million to $ 300 million because of public_debt agreements with borrowers and internal fears that the company would become too highly leveraged . While the bank option would guarantee Redstone full management control of Paramount , sources say he remains in discussions with his two investors -- Blockbuster Entertainment and Nynex -- about increasing their stakes in the deal . * As of Monday , there were no signs of an agreement . One reason : All sides were said to be regrouping following holiday vacations . Based on the current pace of the talks , some sources speculate that Redstone will take his decision down to the wire -- meaning Friday ' s deadline . Paramount gained 50 cents a share on Monday , closing at $ 78.25. Viacom Class A shares eased 12.5 cents to $ 48.75 , and Viacom Class B lost 87.5 cents to $ 44 . QVC added 25 cents to $ 39.50. * Top Blockbuster executives were scheduled late Monday to check_into New York ' s Peninsula Hotel for what are expected to be intense strategy sessions with Viacom over the next couple of days . The hotel has become the company ' s residence of choice in the Big Apple , and for good reason . Back in September , executives were unexpectedly kicked_out of the St . Regis Hotel because the hotel was booked and they hadn ' t made arrangements to stay another night . The St . Regis ended_up sending them over to the Peninsula . * If Viacom does forgo making a higher bid , Redstone will have a_few brash statements to answer_for . One in particular is his Nostradamus-like declaration that it would take a &quot; nuclear attack &quot; to prevent Viacom from acquiring Paramount . Then there was another Redstone declaration of confidence in September in which he said , &quot; Short of a bullet going_through me , this merger ' s going_to take place. &quot; * Paramount is also the focus of an article in February ' s Vanity_Fair magazine , in which contributing editor Bryan Burrough reports that the company nearly merged with NBC before the current battle . Burrough quotes Paramount Chairman Martin Davis as saying he came razor-close to acquiring 51 % of NBC in 1992 , in a deal quietly negotiated with General Electric Chairman Jack Welch . The agreement reportedly fell_apart because of regulatory blockades . &quot; This was real . We had a deal . It blew apart at the 11th hour , &quot; Davis said in the article . Davis also told Burrough that Tele-Communications Inc. Chief_Executive John Malone leaked details of QVC ' s planned bid to him as part of his independent effort to strike a deal with Paramount . According to the article , Malone at one time hoped to pair Paramount with TCI , the TCI-owned Liberty Media or Turner Broadcasting , which is also partly owned by TCI . While Burrough reports that Paramount courted , or was courted by , such companies as Thorn EMI , Bertelsmann , Sony , CBS , ABC , McGraw-Hill , Gannett , AT &amp; T and even Time Warner , it ' s Davis ' frank and insulting appraisals of certain industry colleagues that are often most memorable . On Malone : &quot; The guy is a genius -- but then , so was Al Capone . He ' s the smartest guy you ' ll ever meet . He ' s brilliant . But he stands_for nothing , believes_in nothing and has contempt for anyone that walks and talks. &quot; On Sony President Norio Ogha : &quot; I know ( Ogha ) speaks English . There ' s nothing more irritating than talking to a man who knows exactly what you ' re saying but just gives you this look. &quot; On Ted Turner : &quot; As I got_to know him , I learned to make_sure I got him in the right mood swing , or he ' ll be crazy . He ' s on lithium , you know . When we got_to talking , he ' d get so excited I thought he ' d have an unregulated orgasm. &quot;</TEXT>
