Sveslosky ' s two interceptions ended scoring drives by Valencia late in the third quarter and early in the fourth . Mariner ' s interception came_with 2:35 left as Foothill ( 8-4 ) ran_out the clock . &quot; We were trying to make the plays but we weren ' t able to , &quot; Valencia Coach Mike Marrujo said . &quot; Joe ' s played well for us the entire year , but it was just one of those things . We tried to go_deep , but it got_away from us . ( Foothill ) made one more play than we did and ended_up winning the ball game. &quot; Mariner ' s 18-yard run with 4:26 remaining in the third quarter was the difference . It came_after Valencia had tied the score on its first possession of the quarter . A turnover led to Foothill ' s first touchdown late in the first_half . Running back Aaron Carbajal fumbled and Travis Freeman recovered , giving the Knights possession on the Valencia 39 with 1:07 left in the second quarter . Two plays later , Foothill quarterback Tyler Lang hit wide receiver Cody Clemmons at the 25 .

Secoda hit Jermaine Gray over the middle and the 6-foot , 200-pound senior broke two tackles and ran 83 yards into the end zone , tying the score with only 2:37 off the clock .

But Foothill answered , driving 77 yards in eight plays , as Mariner , who had 63 yards rushing in eight carries , scored on a counter for the game-winner . Foothill Coach Tom Meiss had predicted a defensive contest before the game . And though he wasn ' t surprised by the outcome , he wasn ' t too pleased with his team ' s play either . &quot; It ' s about what I expected , a dog fight , &quot; he said . &quot; But I thought , ' boy we made some stupid mistakes. ' &quot; Foothill finished with 333 yards on offense . Robinson rushed for 80 yards in 10 carries . Secoda completed seven of 20 passes for 165 yards and a touchdown .</TEXT>
