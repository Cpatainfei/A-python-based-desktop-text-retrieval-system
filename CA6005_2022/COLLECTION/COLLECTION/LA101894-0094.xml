   <HEADLINE> HOW BEST TO TACKLE WEIGHT PROBLEM ? ; LIFESTYLES : THOSE EXTRA POUNDS WE ' RE CARRYING WEIGH HEAVY ON THE MINDS OF EXPERTS . BUT THEY can ' t AGREE ON HOW TO GET US TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite a plethora of dieting and the kaleidoscopic weight-loss industry , Americans are gaining weight , not losing_it . And since overweight contributes to diseases such_as arthritis , hypertension , colon_cancer , diabetes and coronary heart_disease , the problem has become a public health crisis of epidemic proportions . So said a panel of 18 experts who collaborated on a set of &quot; healthy weight &quot; recommendations issued after a daylong American Health Foundation round-table_conference held here earlier this month . &quot; Compared to Europe , obesity is a disgrace in this nation , &quot; said Dr. Ernst L . Wynder , foundation president . &quot; Weight is a major factor_in disease and preventive_medicine begins in part_with a healthy weight . We need a campaign similar to the anti-smoking effort of the ' 80s and the cholesterol awareness program. &quot; Added former U.S. surgeon_general Dr. C . Everett Koop : &quot; Television and commercials have really contributed ( to obesity ) and it also stems from psychological and spiritual sources . To our shame , we ' ve done almost nothing about this threat to our health. &quot; The recommendations , issued in the form of a consensus statement , provide a healthy-weight table based on the Body Mass Index -- a scientific measure calculated from height and weight . Overweight people are also advised that even modest weight losses can lead to a &quot; healthier weight. &quot; Still , some experts question the idea of putting more pressure on a society already plagued with a largely unsuccessful diet frenzy . They also question the value of publicizing more weight tables , which they say could confuse consumers and cause more harm than good . &quot; I ' m really shocked and disappointed , &quot; said Healthy Weight Journal Editor Frances Berg , who attended the conference as an observer . &quot; This isn ' t like quitting smoking . There are many health risks associated with losing_weight and already a national obsession with thinness. &quot; Berg , who is also a nutritionist and adjunct professor at the University of North_Dakota School_of_Medicine , said the foundation ' s healthy-weight numbers -- which are stricter benchmarks than some_other tables that show a range of acceptable weights -- are a &quot; step backward &quot; and will do damage , especially to women . &quot; I see four dangers here , &quot; Berg said . &quot; ( They ) create greater potential for eating disorders , harm from dangerous weight-loss methods , prejudice against large people and abuses of the kind already seen from the weight-loss industry. &quot; Not so , counters Johanna Dwyer , a Tufts University School_of_Medicine professor and member of the foundation panel . The recommendations , she said , &quot; are a release from ( social ) pressure . The emphasis is to get your weight lower even if you can ' t reach perfection . We ' re saying any modest weight loss is positive rather than negative , and that an emphasis should be_on not gaining more weight . There are a lot of people out there who haven ' t gotten that message. &quot; Added fellow panel member Sachiko St . Jeor , a professor of clinical medicine at the University of Nevada : &quot; The point is to get a simple and practical message out there that takes a stand and isn ' t wishy-washy . We ' re setting a healthy weight goal , an upper_limit associated with the least disease. &quot; * The debate about what constitutes healthy weight isn ' t new , nor is the notion of guidelines . Karil Bialostosky , a U.S. Department of research fellow for nutrition policy , said the term &quot; healthy weight &quot; was coined in 1990 by an advisory committee . &quot; They wanted some word other_than the term ' desirable weight , ' &quot; she said . &quot; The word healthy makes the concept less ambiguous and connects it more properly to a health-based use. &quot; Still , precisely defining &quot; healthy weight &quot; was difficult , so the committee recommended an interim definition that included three components : weight , distribution of fat and health status . Those and other recommendations resulted in the agency ' s 1990 Dietary Guidelines for Americans , a 27-page pamphlet that is being revised by a newly formed advisory committee and will be reissued in December , 1995 , Bialostosky said . &quot; There is some confusion and controversy with the 1990 healthy-weight guidelines because people focused only on the weight table instead of all three components , &quot; she said . Of the American Health Foundation recommendations , Bialostosky said Health and Human Services has no official position . &quot; It ' s a real tough and controversial issue that many people have questions about , &quot; she said . * So just how overweight are we ? One study -- the ongoing Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance_System , conducted by the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention -- reports an overweight rate of about 26 % , with Arizonans being the least overweight ( 20 % ) and Mississippians the most overweight ( 32 % ) . Californians log_in around the middle , at about 25 % . Another study , published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn . in July , showed an 8 % increase in the number of overweight Americans over the past decade , and said that despite multi-billion-dollar annual dieting expenditures , one-third of American adults -- about 58 million people -- are overweight . Collectively , we ' ve each gained an average of about 8 pounds , the report said . Robert J . Kuczmarski of the National Center for Health Statistics , who co-authored the JAMA study , said it is incorrect to say that Americans have been steadily gaining weight , as reported in the American Health Foundation statement . &quot; We didn ' t find a steady increase in overweight prevalence , &quot; he said . &quot; From 1960 to 1980 , it was fairly flat , with a sudden jump between 1980 and 1991. &quot; He said there is no one reason for the increase during the diet- and fitness-crazed 1980s . He cites several factors , including &quot; the decrease in smoking , the increase in fast-food restaurants , the use of VCRs and jobs where people sit glued to their computers. &quot; Ellen Satter , a Wisconsin registered dietitian and eating therapist , said the outmoded way of looking_at body_weight has created the problems we have today . The field is now undergoing a &quot; paradigm shift , &quot; she said , resulting in a confused public . &quot; You have the old paradigm group that sees weight as being optional , something you can get_by eating and exercise , &quot; she said . In the new way of thinking , which Satter subscribes to , abnormal body_weight is what ' s atypical for the individual , not something that can be defined by outside or collective measures . &quot; The thing to do is eat and exercise in a healthy fashion and accept the weight that grows out of that , &quot; she said . &quot; There has been an awful lot of agony taking_place over weight reduction , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s like beating a dead horse. &quot;</TEXT>
