   <HEADLINE> CANADIAN FEDERALISTS SEE NO THREAT IN QUEBEC RESULTS ; POLITICS : DESPITE VICTORY BY SEPARATISTS , DEFENDERS OF UNITY NOTE THEIR FAILURE TO WIN A MAJORITY OF VOTES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Defenders of Canadian national unity expressed confidence Tuesday that they can defeat efforts by the newly elected separatist government of Quebec to achieve independence for the mainly French-speaking province . Indeed , Monday ' s election of the Parti Quebecois here seemed to have a little something for everybody . The separatists -- or sovereigntists , as they prefer to be called -- won a strong majority of 77 seats in the 125-member provincial Parliament . Parti Quebecois leader Jacques Parizeau will be sworn_in as premier later this month and has said he will immediately begin working toward a provincial referendum on independence . But Canadian federalists were encouraged by the extremely close popular vote -- 44.7 % for the PQ to 44.3 % for the anti-separatist Liberals -- and by the fact that Parizeau ' s party failed to win a majority of the votes cast . ( Each district is decided on a winner-take-all basis. ) They also cite polls that show only about 40 % of Quebeckers would vote for independence today . &quot; The PQ won a victory , it ' s in power , but certainly not the victory the polls predicted and the victory they wanted , &quot; said Maurice Pinard , a sociology professor at McGill University in Montreal who has written extensively on the Quebec political situation . &quot; If they can ' t win an election with more_than 45 % of the vote , how can they win a referendum ? It seems to me they ' re in real trouble on that. &quot; &quot; It appears from the statistical analysis that this was ( a vote ) for a change of government but not for separatism . I only wish we could have the referendum tomorrow so we could put it behind us , &quot; Stanley Plotnick , a Montreal businessman and community activist , said in a telephone_interview . Jean Charest , leader of the Progressive Conservative_Party and an expected leader in the campaign against a separatist referendum , warned that the Parti Quebecois will have powerful tools to advance its agenda and that defeat of the referendum should not be taken_for granted . &quot; Parizeau now controls the levers of government , and he knows how to use them and he will use them , &quot; Charest said from his office in Ottawa . One PQ insider predicted privately that Parizeau will seek to provoke the federal_government and Prime_Minister Jean Chretien in an effort to make the central government appear obstructionist . This , in turn , would be used in the campaign for independence . Lucien Bouchard , the separatist leader in the federal Parliament , predicted conflict with Chretien in an interview after the votes were counted Monday . The Parti Quebecois was able to run_up a large parliamentary majority despite the close popular vote because of the sharp division of the electorate along linguistic lines . The Liberals , led by outgoing Premier Daniel Johnson , ran_up large majorities in their English-speaking stronghold districts in Montreal . The Parti Quebecois won most of the French-speaking districts , but not by the large margins expected . Pre-election polls had projected that the Parti Quebecois would win more_than 80 seats -- some suggested as_many as 90 -- and a popular vote_in the 49 % range . The poorer-than-expected showing will bring pressure on Parizeau to give the most prominent role in the referendum campaign to Bouchard , who is considered far more popular and dynamic . Another key to the separatist strategy will be to portray the choice for Quebeckers as a stark one of the status_quo versus independence . This is aimed at the large middle ground of French-speaking voters who are wary of independence but would like Canada to cede more control over government programs and institutions to the provincial government . Many French speakers here believe fundamental reforms are necessary to preserve the Quebec language and culture , surrounded as it is by English-speaking North_Americans . But the rest of Canada often interprets such moves as special treatment for Quebec . Charest said he is preparing proposals that could meet Quebec ' s concerns without offending other Canadians and that he will disclose them as part of the referendum campaign . Chretien said Tuesday that he is not interested in undertaking constitutional initiatives aimed at Quebec . He said he will press forward with planned economic and social reforms regardless of their impact on a referendum campaign . &quot; For me , the results of yesterday , short of the victory of Mr. Johnson , ( were ) the best I could hope for , &quot; Chretien said . There also were sighs of relief in many English-speaking neighborhoods of Quebec . During the first Parti Quebecois government , in 1976-84 , an estimated 140 # 000 English speakers and hundreds of businesses left the province , feeling unwanted and without a future . No similar exodus is expected now . &quot; I haven ' t heard of anybody preparing to take_off , whereas the last time you could see all_the ( for-sale ) signs going_up , &quot; said Joan Winser , an English-speaking political activist in Montreal who was Canada ' s consul general in Los Angeles for five years in the 1980s . In the village of North Hatley southeast of Montreal , Jackie Donnachie , 46 , also was feeling more serene . Two weeks ago , standing behind the counter of the North Hatley Emporium where she works , Donnachie was anticipating a Parti Quebecois landslide and contemplating her family ' s future . Her husband , Dave , 51 , had an American mother and recently applied for U.S. citizenship . Speaking by telephone Tuesday , Donnachie said her reading of the results was that there was little sentiment for separation . But her husband is not withdrawing his citizenship application . &quot; I don ' t think we ' re going to burn any bridges . It ' s good to know you have options if we need them down the road , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
