   <HEADLINE> EASTERN EUROPEANS ARE NEW REFUGEES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Before the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina , Ahmet Hadzimujagic and his wife , Aida , led a charmed existence . He was a successful architect . She was a doctor . They owned a bed and breakfast in Srebrenica , then a popular resort town famous for its mineral springs . But today , the Hadzimujagics ( pronounced Ha-jee-moo-jah-jick ) and their two young daughters , Selma and Jasmine , are penniless refugees living_in this small city thousands of miles from home -- their sole means of survival a $ 730 welfare check and $ 191 worth of food_stamps . They arrived in Orange County two months ago from a refugee camp in Split , Croatia . &quot; Step by step , we are getting used to life here , &quot; said Aida Hadzimujagic , 36 , during an interview at the county welfare office in Anaheim . &quot; But the biggest problem is money . What we get from welfare is not enough. &quot; The Hadzimujagics are among a small but growing number of Eastern Europeans in Southern California who came_to the United States as political refugees and now depend entirely on public assistance . In January , 1989 , there were just 289 cases of former Eastern Europeans and Soviet citizens on a variety of welfare programs in Orange County . In January , 1994 , there were 738 cases . In many instances , each case represents three people , and sometimes more . According to social_services officials , the increasing visibility of Eastern Europeans and citizens of the former Soviet_Union on local welfare rolls -- there were virtually none 10 years ago -- is one barometer of a shift in U.S. immigration policy . With the normalization of relations between the U.S. and Vietnam , immigration slots that once were automatically reserved for Southeast Asians are now gradually being redistributed among Eastern Europeans . One result of the new immigration quotas has been an unprecedented flow of Russians , Romanians , Armenians , Poles and others into county welfare offices , according to social_services officials . Although Eastern Europeans still make_up just 1 % of the 40 # 000 Orange County families receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children payments , social_services officials say they are monitoring the numbers closely in an effort to prepare_for the possible impact on future caseloads . &quot; In the coming years , we ' re going to be seeing different groups than what we ' ve been seeing over the past 15 years , &quot; said Angelo Doti , director of financial assistance for the Orange County Social_Services Agency . &quot; We ' re trying to plan ahead and think_about things like our language capability and staff recruitment. &quot; Social_worker Darek Gartska , a Polish native who was himself a refugee four years ago , has been called_upon numerous times to act_as an interpreter in Russian , Polish and Czech . Gartska ' s Eastern European clients run the gamut : Ukrainians , Armenians , Lithuanians , Bosnians and Russians , among others . Like Ahmet Hadzimujagic , some of Gartska ' s clients are highly skilled professionals . But because they can communicate only in their native languages , he said , their chances of finding work here are virtually nil . Those with_children can collect AFDC until their children turn 18 . Single people and couples without children are eligible for the federal_government ' s Refugee Cash Assistance program , which contributes a small amount toward their living costs for a maximum of eight months . Refugees are also eligible for MediCal . They include people like Oleg Pinkevich , a 21-year-old from the former Soviet_Union , who says he left his native country last September to avoid serving in the army . &quot; I was afraid because they can send you to strange places far away from home like Afghanistan , &quot; Pinkevich said through a Russian interpreter . He also said he feared that he would be mistreated in the army because he is a Baptist . Pinkevich said he left his mother , father , brother and sister behind five months ago to come_to live with an uncle in Brea . He attends a technical_school and , because he is unemployed , receives $ 299 a month from the Refugee Cash Assistance program plus $ 102 in food_stamps . According to immigration officials , more_than half of the 120 # 000 people admitted to the United States as political refugees this year will come from Eastern European_countries -- mainly the nations of the former Soviet_Union . About 10 # 000 will gravitate to California , most because they already have family , friends and business contacts here . Although most will settle in Los Angeles , Orange County and San Francisco will also be popular destinations , said Bruce Kennedy , chief of the state_Department of Social_Services ' refugee and immigration bureau . &quot; The largest percentage -- primarily Soviet Jews -- will go_to New York . But the second largest_number will come_to California , &quot; Kennedy said . &quot; They tend to go where the previous settlement patterns have been. &quot; Many times , however , the relatives who promised to help them get_on their feet renege when they actually arrive . Many , Gartska says , are left in the lurch . &quot; It ' s very common where the relative says , ' I ' m sorry , I can ' t help you , &quot; Gartska said . &quot; When people come_over , it ' s not an easy job . They have transportation problems , they need to find schools . A lot of the times they can ' t speak English. &quot; Other refugees end_up in Orange County because several international sponsorship agencies have branches here . The agencies process the necessary immigration forms but often do little to help the new refugees find work once they get here . &quot; Some volunteer agencies abhor anyone coming here to be a public charge whereas others almost encourage it , &quot; Doti said . &quot; Plus , a lot of the people from communist countries view government differently . They view public assistance as a right. &quot; But some are ashamed to be_on public assistance . &quot; I want to work , &quot; said Alma Ibrahimovic , a 35-year-old urban planner from Sarajevo who now lives_in Yorba Linda with a Muslim family that sponsors her . &quot; I have applied for 18 positions , but unfortunately , almost every day , I receive a letter that says I ' m not accepted. &quot;</TEXT>
