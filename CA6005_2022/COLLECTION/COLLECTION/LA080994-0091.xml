   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : TEAMSTERS ENTER 3RD WEEK OF CALMAT STRIKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Members of the local Teamsters Union entered their third week of a strike against CalMat Co . plants in Oxnard and Moorpark , and a settlement in the salary dispute is nowhere in_sight , officials said . Both CalMat officials and Teamsters Union_members said Monday that they have no intention of changing their positions : CalMat wants the Teamsters to take a $ 2.20-per-hour pay_cut because of the sluggish economy , but the Teamsters have refused . More_than 50 drivers have been picketing at the two local plants and at sites where CalMat products are delivered throughout the county . &quot; I don ' t understand how CalMat expects us to take a pay_cut of more_than $ 8 # 000 , a year , &quot; said 11-year CalMat employee Ruben Villa . &quot; I support a family of six . If I take that sort of pay_cut , I would n ' t be able to make it. &quot; Like other members of the union , Villa makes about $ 32 # 000 a year . CalMat , which specializes in rock and concrete building_materials , employs 80 drivers , 50 of whom are union_members , said Dennis Shaw , secretary treasurer and chief_executive for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 186 . CalMat and the union had been negotiating since April , and talks ceased July 22 , after the Teamsters refused to take a pay_cut . In recent contracts with other companies in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties , unions_members have agreed to cuts of 95 cents per hour , but CalMat insisted on cuts more_than twice as much , Shaw said . &quot; If we settle with a substandard agreement with CalMat , &quot; then other companies may attempt to renegotiate their union contracts to lower the salaries of hundreds of workers , Shaw said . Meanwhile , more_than 50 Teamsters who work for other Ventura County firms have set_up the El Rio Drivers ' Strike Fund to support fellow union_members . CHRISTINA LIMA</TEXT>
