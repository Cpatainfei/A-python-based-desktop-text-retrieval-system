   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : JAPAN MUST CHANGE , ASSUME A GROWN-UP ROLE IN WORLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The highly public arguments now flying between Washington and Tokyo could bring healthy change to Japan and the world economy . But the_matter is very tricky , and misunderstandings between the Clinton_Administration and the government of Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa could worsen relations between the world ' s two largest economies , with consequences unpredictable and ominous . The issue goes well beyond trade , which is a relatively simple problem . A deal could be made in automobiles and parts , or Congress could permit the export of Alaskan oil which Japan would buy . Either way , the roughly $ 59-billion Japan-U.S. merchandise trade_deficit could be eliminated . Simply including the $ 19-billion U.S. surplus in_services trade with Japan -- transportation , tourism , banking and legal services -- reduces the overall deficit sharply . But numbers are not the issue . Rather , the concern is Japan ' s role in a world of open economies . Japan benefits from open trade with other countries but doesn ' t reciprocate by allowing access to its own considerable market . It has a trade surplus with every major country and trading bloc -- the European Union , the rest of Asia , Latin_America , the United States and Canada . The imbalance is more_than an annoyance . Japan ' s economy is so large -- $ 3 trillion a year in economic activity -- that its policies distort the world economy . Denying access to the world ' s second-largest market reduces opportunity for other countries ; selling goods abroad at lower prices than in Japan , is a strategy designed to &quot; export unemployment , &quot; says economist Michael Borrus of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy . Overproducing some goods in an attempt to monopolize a business , as Japan did years ago when its companies took a $ 4-billion loss in semiconductors , threatens strategic industries of other countries . that ' s why the United States hammered_out a semiconductor agreement with Japan in 1986 . Now the U.S._government is seeking an even broader new_deal , to open Japan ' s home market which often operates like a stacked deck . Motorola , subject of Tuesday ' s trade action by the U.S._government , has been in Japan for 40 years . The Schaumburg , Ill. , firm is a pioneer in cellular_telephones . But when it first brought cellular to Japan , it was told it could only do business in rural_areas . Motorola protested and was allowed into the Osaka and Tokyo markets , and it is doing_well in Osaka . But in Tokyo it has done poorly because the Japanese government assigned it an affiliate of its chief competitor , Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone , as a joint-venture partner . The U.S. market may be no picnic , but Fujitsu , Sony , Matsushita , Honda , Toyota , Nissan , NEC , Mitsubishi , Hitachi and other Japanese firms didn ' t face that kind of runaround here . that ' s why the U.S._government and American trade and economic_experts say Japan needs to change . And many political and economic_experts in Japan agree . Tokyo ' s policy of protecting industry , a relic of the nation ' s postwar rebuilding , has also hurt the Japanese people . Consumers in Japan pay 40 % more for food , furniture and most other goods . There are fewer public amenities , such_as parks , and a lower standard of residential housing than in countries with a fraction of Japan ' s wealth . Real_estate was severely distorted because capital from years of trade surpluses pushed_up building prices astronomically . Now prices have fallen_in Japan ' s 3-year-old recession , and Japanese banks are left with an estimated $ 200 billion in bad loans . Yet , there is more hope than gloom at the moment because Japan is changing . Hosokawa , who came_to office last year , replacing 45 years of single-party rule , brought_in voting reform to redress an imbalance that had given farmers and other rural residents three times the parliamentary representation of the highly populated urban districts . The outlook is for more change -- although it won ' t come easy . Hosokawa wants to boost the economy with income-tax cuts , but he is being blocked by the Ministry of Finance , which wants to keep control at the center -- almost like a commissariat of the old Soviet_Union -- in an era of decentralization . And that ' s a cue for the Clinton_Administration . Just as U.S. policy has been to help Russia make the transition to a post-Cold War economy , so it wants to do the same with Japan . A more democratic , open Japan would be in the U.S. interest . U.S. companies would benefit from access to the Japan ' s market ; the Japanese people would benefit from a reorganization of their economy and Japan ' s companies would benefit in an open world economy . But there ' s a caveat . The Clinton policy must be principled and long-term , a determination to work with the best in Japan , and not a ploy of U.S. domestic politics . &quot; A poke in the eye with a sharp stick can be useful , &quot; says Richard Drobnick , head of an International Business program at USC . &quot; But do we have a policy for when Japan screams , or retaliates ? Is our policy truly geared to making Japan a more cooperative member of the world economy ? &quot; Borrus of the Berkeley Roundtable , the think_tank that Laura Tyson belonged_to before she became Clinton ' s chief economic adviser , says it is : &quot; There are some smart people in the Administration with very interesting ideas. &quot; As for Japan , Hosokawa said in Washington that the relationship with the United States is changing to one of &quot; grown-ups. &quot; A good term . For more_than 48 years now , Japan has been defended by the U.S. military and its protectionist policies tolerated while the United States built a postwar world of open commerce . It ' s about time Japan took its place in that world as a grown-up nation .</TEXT>
