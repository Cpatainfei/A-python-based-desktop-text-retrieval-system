   <HEADLINE> RAIN , COURT DELAY MALATHION SPRAYING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The aerial application of the insecticide malathion over an 18-square-mile area of Corona and Norco -- which had been slated to begin Monday night -- has been postponed at least until next week . State agricultural officials announced Monday morning that they had postponed plans to begin aerial spraying for a week because of inclement weather . In the afternoon , a Superior_Court judge ruled that the aerial spraying warranted further review , guaranteeing that the helicopters would not fly until Feb . 2 , when he will hear further arguments on the issue . Aerial spraying is necessary , state officials maintain , because the discovery of a mated Mediterranean_fruit_fly in Corona last month required quick and dramatic action before the fruit-ravaging pest spreads into agriculture-rich lands elsewhere in the state . The aerial application is part of a massive effort to eradicate the Medfly ; in Los Angeles , San Bernardino and Orange counties , billions of sterile insects will be released to combat the pest . Corona city officials filed a lawsuit Friday , asking that the spraying be blocked , at least temporarily , until the public health consequences of using the insecticide could be debated . Critics of the use of malathion say studies show there is a potential for danger to human health . But even before Monday ' s hearing before Riverside County Superior_Court Judge Victor Miceli began , state_Department of Food and Agriculture officials said the spraying would be delayed a week because of the threat of rain , which would nullify its effects . Later , Miceli said he wanted to study the issue more and give attorneys the chance to provide him with additional information and arguments . He rescheduled the hearing for the morning of Feb . 2 , when he could either order the helicopters grounded or allow that night ' s spraying to occur . Opponents of the spraying said the delay marked a victory for them because the longer the spraying is delayed , the less serious the appearance of a single Medfly -- with no additional findings -- would seem . &quot; The Medfly has already gone_through two life_cycles without additional sightings , so I don ' t know what the emergency is anymore , &quot; Corona City Councilman Jeff Bennett said . But state officials said that with the judge ' s blessing , the sprayings would occur sooner or later , weather permitting . &quot; We won ' t walk away from this , &quot; said Isi Siddiqui , assistant director of the food and agriculture_department . Because the life_cycle of the Medfly is slowed during winter months , hundreds of Medfly pupae may be in the ground , on the verge of hatching , he said . A nine-day delay would not be fatal in the state ' s attack on the Corona infestation , Siddiqui said . Attorneys for the city of Corona contend that the aerial spraying jeopardizes public health . Furthermore , they argue , the state failed to abide_by its own guidelines by wanting to spray without conducting an environmental impact report . Deputy Atty . Gen . Charles W . Getz said outside the courtroom that Corona ' s lawsuit was similar to more_than 35 others filed_in previous years against the state , attempting to keep the helicopters from flying over various communities . In 1989-90 , the state sprayed more_than 500 square_miles of Los Angeles , Orange and San Diego counties in an attempt to rid the region of the Medfly . The state prevailed in each of the previous court challenges , Getz said , and the sprayings went_forward . &quot; Corona did a very good job ( in preparing the court challenge ) in the time it had , but the theories they ' ve raised have been heard before , &quot; Getz said . The state did not need to file an environmental impact report , Getz said , because Gov . Pete Wilson last week issued an emergency declaration allowing the spraying to occur .</TEXT>
