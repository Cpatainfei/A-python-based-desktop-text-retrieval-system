   <TEXT> The image was unforgettable : Oskar Schindler climbing out of his Mercedes-Benz , noticing a flurry of ash drifting down from the sky , sniffing the wind , flicking with puzzled irritation the flakes from his windshield and his trim , double-breasted suit . Viewers of the movie &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; know that this apparent midsummer snowstorm was really human ash , the incinerated remains of the Jews and others gassed at Hitler ' s death camps . What viewers may_not have known is that such storms were the patented work of a family_business here in east-central Germany , J.A. Topf &amp; Soehne . During the Second_World_War , the company made the ovens used to dispose_of the bodies of those murdered at Auschwitz , Dachau and Buchenwald . If it hadn ' t been for Topf ovens , the Nazis would have had a far harder_time killing so many and leaving so little evidence . And , chillingly , there are indications that the family was proud_of its work . A visitor to the Holocaust memorial site at Buchenwald can inspect the old crematories and see the ovens , the doors handsomely emblazoned with the name Topf in Gothic brass letters . Today too , half a century later , the family ' s factory still stands on a side street in the Thuringian capital of Erfurt , not far from the family villa , set_on a large tract of urban parkland . The Topfs had their property seized by the Soviets at the end of the war ; the factory fell_into disrepair , and the villa swimming_pool is_full of dirt . But no matter . Today , in a bizarre land claim , one that is remarkable even in a country plagued by post-Communist property tangles , a new generation of Topfs is trying to get the old manufacturing domain back . &quot; Heirs have the duty to take responsibility for the past , &quot; says Dagmar Topf , a 50-year-old therapist from the northernmost German state of Schleswig-Holstein who , in the name of the Topf brothers ' descendants , filed a claim in 1990 on the factory , park and villa . The parkland alone is said to be worth at least $ 2.5 million . But Topf , the daughter-in-law of a late factory director , argues that it is social consciousness , and not greed , that motivates her and those she represents . If the factory were in family hands , she says , she and the other Topfs would find ways of running it that might somehow atone for the past . &quot; This company was involved in the terrible things that happened , &quot; she says . &quot; My personal task now is to see_to_it that such things never happen again. &quot; Maybe yes , maybe no -- but in any case , how could such a land claim prosper ? Why should the German legal_system entertain the arguments of a woman whose Nazi-collaborator in-laws were apprehended , interrogated and irreversibly expropriated ? In the end , the Topf descendants may never get their family ' s property back -- the head of the land-claims office in Erfurt predicts as much -- but nevertheless , the eagerness with which Dagmar Topf has pursued her mission says much about the chaotic state of property ownership in what used to be East_Germany . For the younger Topfs are not the only westerners who have been trying , since 1990 , to lay claim to a piece of eastern German real_estate -- far from it . During the Third_Reich , the Nazis seized homes and businesses from Jews and other perceived enemies of the state ; then , when the Soviets rolled into what would later become East_Germany , they expropriated countless more properties from the fascists and their supporters , real and perceived . Then , for the four decades that East_Germany did business as a Communist country , the authorities treated all this seized real_estate as &quot; the people ' s &quot; property , and parceled it out as living quarters and &quot; people ' s enterprises. &quot; Finally , with reunification in 1990 , the authorities gave eastern Germany ' s dispossessed , and their offspring , the chance to set things right . Anyone whose property was confiscated between 1933 and 1945 , or between 1949 and 1990 , was empowered to demand restitution or compensation . * That was when Dagmar Topf made her move . &quot; After the Wende ( the Great Change ) , I was moved to come_forward and say , ' I know what my relatives did . I want to use my knowledge to create something . To build something . To improve something , ' &quot; she says . &quot; So , we talked it over , and ( my father-in-law ' s ) side of the family decided to authorize me to represent them. &quot; She filed her first claim in 1990 . Which put her in ample company . As of this year , 1.2 million people have come_forward in Germany , seeking more_than 2.7 million pieces of real_estate in the former East . The government has been swamped sorting_out who owns what , separating legitimate claimants from charlatans , and deciding what to do_in the not-uncommon cases in which , say , addressing the claims of descendants of an emigre Jew would mean evicting an innocent eastern German family . &quot; We will do our best to see that more_than half of the claims are settled by the end of 1995 , &quot; says Hans-Juergen Schaefer , president of the Federal_Department of Unsettled Property Ownership . &quot; But it is very difficult , and I ' m certain that we won ' t be done with all_the claims until sometime after the year 2000. &quot; Meanwhile , investment in the dilapidated and needy former East has slowed to a crawl , and resentment among easterners toward the western land claimants is impossible to miss . In the Saxony-Anhalt town of Barby , someone torched the central land-title office last year in an apparent attempt to destroy the property records and put a halt to the restitution . And in another particularly sad case , a well-known East_German reform activist , Detlef Dalk , killed himself during a property dispute after composing an eloquent suicide note in which he protested &quot; the gigantic flood of property from the east to the west &quot; and called the claim on his land &quot; ridiculous. &quot; &quot; There is a certain number of false claims , &quot; admits Schaefer , &quot; and when someone pursues an illegitimate claim , they can do so very skillfully , so that it takes a long_time to find it out . But I would say that is only a small percentage . Most claims are filed_in good faith. &quot; * The case of the Nazi oven works started over a century ago , when Julius Andreas Topf , a blacksmith , opened a furnace and heating-equipment foundry in Erfurt . Topf had heard that in Milan , Italy , the city_fathers were experimenting with cremation , and it struck him as a good business opportunity . He asked his engineers to work_on the burning of corpses , and even joined a promotional society called Friends of Cremation . By the late 1920s , J.A. Topf &amp; Soehne , operated by the founder ' s sons , Ernst Wolfgang and Ludwig , was selling crematories to cities as far away as Lisbon and Brussels , as well as throughout Germany . Then came the rise of Adolf Hitler . The Jews were herded into ghettos , then shipped to concentration_camps , and eventually selected for forced labor or gassing . At this point , the activities of J.A. Topf &amp; Soehne become somewhat murky . How much did Ernst Wolfgang and Ludwig know about the mass_murders ? Nothing , insists Dagmar Topf : &quot; I feel quite sure that they didn ' t know how their ovens were being used. &quot; Records show that the brothers joined the National_Socialist Party in 1935 , but Dagmar Topf maintains they did so only under pressure . &quot; You have to understand about German history , &quot; she says . &quot; If you didn ' t go_along with the system , you had lots of problems. &quot; But does that really explain the zeal with which J.A. Topf &amp; Soehne fulfilled its contracts ? One company engineer , Kurt Pruefer , went so far as_to take_out a patent on his &quot; Auschwitz style &quot; twin-chambered oven , boasting that its burning capacity -- 30 to 36 corpses in 10 hours -- easily beat the competition . Pruefer went_on to invent a 46-chambered oven , and reportedly won the nickname &quot; the Wizard of Cremation &quot; around the Topf factory . How could he not have known what was going_on ? &quot; Yes , it ' s true that the company built four big crematoria at Auschwitz , &quot; says Dagmar Topf . &quot; But at that time , you could have called them civil crematoria. &quot; She pulls_out a scholarly work_on Nazi cremation technology , which shows that while the Topf brothers ' first order from the SS -- the special Nazi police -- came_in late 1939 , the gassing of the Jews began in_earnest in March , 1943 . Until then , Topf argues , it is reasonable to assume that the ovens were needed only to cremate camp inmates who died in epidemics . &quot; It was only on the date of March 13 , 1943 , that the misuse of the crematoria began , &quot; she says . &quot; It was a tragedy for the company , and also a tragedy for the victims. &quot; * At the end of the war , when Germany was divided among the Allies , the administration of Erfurt , a city not far from Buchenwald , fell to the Soviets . They seized the oven factory and sent Pruefer and several other senior managers to Siberian work_camps . Ludwig Topf took his life in the villa . Ernst Wolfgang hastened to the French-administered zone in the West , eventually going_into business there ; he died without returning to live_in what became East_Germany . &quot; What was burned in those ovens was already dead , &quot; he told a German court in the early 1960s . &quot; You can ' t hold the builders of the ovens responsible_for the deaths of the people who were burned in them. &quot; Back in Erfurt , East_Germany ' s socialist overlords gave the Topf factory a new name : the &quot; Erfurt People ' s Malting and Storage-Container Construction Co. , &quot; or E.M.S. The rank_and_file were put_to_work building breweries , field kitchens and silos for the Soviet_Union , as war reparations . The villa was converted into a kindergarten . As the years passed , hundreds of political employees found their way onto the E.M.S. payroll , and the company settled into a routine of building huge storage elevators for the East_German grain crop . One fast-rising staff_member , as it happens , was a man named Udo Braun , a descendant of the oven makers . His father , the factory ' s production manager in the Nazi years , had been condemned to Siberia . While the elder Braun shivered in the Soviet subarctic , Udo was starting as an apprentice , earning an array of engineering degrees , and working his way up through the E.M.S. ranks , always in the face of discrimination by Communists , he says , who would never let him forget what his father had done . By the beginning of the 1980s , Braun had become E.M.S. ' production manager and interim chief_executive . Then , in 1989 , the Berlin Wall came_down , and E.M.S. , like all East_German &quot; people ' s enterprises , &quot; was faced with liquidation , privatization , or a return to its pre-Communist owners . Dagmar Topf says she knew that lots of hustlers and carpetbaggers were flocking east , trying to grab the best pieces of the old industrial stock . She feared the worst for the staff at her ancestral oven works : &quot; There were many , many employees who had been with the firm for 30 or 40 years , &quot; she says . &quot; There was a great danger that they would be fired . We were afraid that someone would buy the place just to get the real_estate , and not to save the factory and the jobs. &quot; But to Udo Braun , one of those easterners who had toughed it out_in Erfurt through the Communist years , the worst danger came precisely from the_likes_of Dagmar Topf . &quot; That woman is so dumb ! &quot; he exclaims when her name comes_up . &quot; I am trying to remain charming , but with her it is simply impossible . &quot; In the beginning , after the Wall came_down , I was very euphoric , &quot; he goes_on , sitting in shirt sleeves on a warm Friday afternoon . &quot; I just didn ' t think_about property_rights . But later on , when the first prospective investors came and I could sense that some of them were speculators , then I got the feeling that we were in trouble. &quot; The government told Braun he had three months to find financial_backing for the factory , or it would be liquidated . Braun says he jumped into his car and began crisscrossing Germany , looking_for business contacts in the unfamiliar West . He says he logged more_than 60 # 000 miles , and finally found an investor on his birthday , April 2 , 1993 . By the end of June , the factory was private , and the new owner had made him CEO . The factory , which today employs 85 people , makes steel containers for preparing malt used in brewing beer . Dagmar Topf says the privatization was a &quot; brutal &quot; affair , and that Braun has fired hundreds of E.M.S. staffers . &quot; Of course there had to be some firings , &quot; she says . &quot; It wasn ' t economically feasible to keep all_the hundreds of jobs . But I wanted to save some of the jobs . And I didn ' t have a chance. &quot; The government has rejected most of the Topf descendants ' claims -- on technical , not moral , grounds . The German unification treaty says that nothing expropriated by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 can be given_back , and the Topf factory was seized during that time . There are still-unresolved Topf claims on the villa parkland , but officials in the Erfurt land-claims office say they expect these eventually will be denied . That doesn ' t stop Dagmar Topf . She is combing the corporate and German state archives , trying to uncover more secrets from the past . &quot; This part of history should never be closed , &quot; she argues . &quot; I want to make_sure that all_the facts are clear . It ' s a sociopolitical task. &quot; And what of Braun ? Does he ever stop to contemplate the oddness of it all ? The Topf heirs are all but shut_out , but here he is , coming_to work each day , running the plant where his father played his own unique role in the Nazi horror . &quot; Of course , &quot; he says . &quot; I was 9 years old at the end of the war , and my father was taken_away for some investigation . . . . And then , when I was at school , they sent us to look_at an exhibition about the Holocaust , and we had to look_at all these shrunken heads and human skins . It was very shocking -- as shocking as it must have been for the citizens of Weimar , when they were forced to get_onto buses and go walk through Buchenwald . I never forgot a single detail of that exhibition . I think it was good that I had to see it . &quot; Then , when I became an apprentice here , they put all_of us into one room and showed us pictures , so that we knew that the owner of this place had once produced those ovens . The East_German state wanted us to know this history . But they did_it in a peculiar way . They were constantly saying , ' We are the new state , and we had nothing to do with this. ' They kept repeating and repeating it , and of course , when you hit someone again and again in the same place , it starts to get tired . Sometimes it ' s very hard to be a German. &quot;</TEXT>
