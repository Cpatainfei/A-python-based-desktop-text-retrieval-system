   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / WOMEN AT LA COSTA ; GRAF ENDS SLUMP TALK , ROUTS SANCHEZ VICARIO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Slump ? What slump ? Even though Steffi Graf had reached the final of the $ 400 # 000 Toshiba Tennis Classic , her subpar play had been the talk_of the tournament . She hadn ' t been at the top of her game since winning the German Open in her homeland three months ago . But that was before Graf took the court Sunday at La Costa Resort &amp; Spa for the championship match against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain . This was a showdown between the world ' s top-ranked women ' s players , and Graf turned it into a 6-2 , 6-1 runaway for her 86th tour victory . Graf needed only 1 hour 7 minutes to win the tournament for the fourth time , and the second time in a row . She also beat Sanchez Vicario in last year ' s final , 6-4 , 4-6 , 6-1 . During the awards ceremony , Sanchez Vicario told the sellout crowd of 5 # 800 , &quot; It was not a nice thing for me . I tried everything , but she was very hot today and showed why she ' s No . 1 in the world. &quot; Graf holds a 24-6 edge over Sanchez Vicario , including 3-1 in 1994 . &quot; Every time she plays me , she ' s so great , &quot; Sanchez Vicario said . &quot; She ' s got something against me . I don ' t know what it is. &quot; Said Graf : &quot; I ' m not mad at her . I just played some of my best tennis today. &quot; Graf was asked later if she could play any better . &quot; I don ' t know , &quot; she said . &quot; The best I ever played against Arantxa was in the Australian Open this year ( Jan . 30 ) . This one was probably the next best. &quot; Asked about her so-called slump , Graf laughed and said , &quot; I can ' t talk_about slump today. &quot; Slump or not , Graf had expressed concern during the week about her inability to put_away seemingly overmatched opponents . She had no such problem Sunday . &quot; I knew what I had to do , and I didn ' t feel_like she had anything to hurt me , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' m very happy now about the week I had here . Even the trouble I had earlier in the week , I fought my way_out of it , and closing out this way helped me a lot to get ready for the U.S. Open ( beginning Aug . 29 ) . &quot; Graf was asked if her decisive victory was indicative_of a vast difference between No . 1 and No . 2 . &quot; No , &quot; she said . &quot; Arantxa wasn ' t up_to the level she can play. &quot; That being the case , Graf said she had a feeling after four games that she would be in command . &quot; I broke her ( service ) in the second game , &quot; Graf said . &quot; Even though she broke me back , I broke her again in the fourth game . Then I knew what I had to do , and I knew I could do_it . &quot; I wanted to be more aggressive , go_for my shots and go_in behind them . It helps me very much to win this tournament , especially since everybody was talking_about my two losses in a row -- wow ! &quot; Graf was beaten by Mary Pierce in the semifinals of the_French Open and by Lori McNeil in the first round at Wimbledon before coming here . All that changed Sunday . &quot; Steffi didn ' t miss a ball , &quot; Sanchez Vicario said . &quot; Normally she ' s not so consistent , but today her volleys , overheads , everything she hit was perfect. &quot; Later , Sanchez Vicario derived a measure of consolation by teaming with Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic to beat Ginger Helgeson of Alpine , Calif. , and Rachel McQuillan of Australia in the doubles final , 6-3 , 6-3 . The doubles match was Sanchez Vicario ' s 29th in 25 days , and she said , &quot; I ' m not touching a racket or a tennis_ball for two days . I deserve a vacation. &quot;</TEXT>
