   <HEADLINE> ORPHANAGE IN CHECHEN CAPITAL BOMBED ; CAUCASUS : ATTACK HERALDS BEGINNING OF RUSSIAN ASSAULT ON CITY . CHILDREN ESCAPE INJURY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hours after President Boris N . Yeltsin vowed to halt bombing that could cause civilian casualties , Russian warplanes early Wednesday morning devastated Chechnya ' s biggest orphanage , where about 60 children and 100 adults cowered in the basement , witnesses said . No one was hurt in the bombing that heralded the long-expected , full-scale Russian attack on the rebel capital of Grozny . But old_women and children who hid in the basement recalled the whine of the plane they heard at dawn and the sense of betrayal they felt over Yeltsin breaking his promise . &quot; Ask Yeltsin this question , &quot; demanded Antonina Tikhonova , a 70-year-old ethnic Russian . &quot; How can the Russian pilots we ' ve always loved kill us , Russian children and old people ? &quot; Nonstop bombing and shelling pounded the northeast and west of Grozny on Wednesday as Russian forces braved ferocious resistance and advanced into the besieged capital in a relentless final push to subdue the breakaway republic . By midafternoon , the approaching rat-tat-tat of small arms fire in the city_center indicated that Russian troops had broken_through Chechen defenses and could carry_out Kremlin plans to take the city before New Year ' s Eve . Russia denied it had bombed the orphanage or any other area of Grozny . &quot; We did not work in Grozny today , &quot; insisted Valentin M . Sergeyev of the Russian government press center in Moscow . &quot; We obeyed the president ' s order , which is the law for us. &quot; He called any report of the bombing &quot; propaganda and provocation. &quot; Other Russian officials claimed that Chechen rebels had fired a missile on the outlying village of Urus-Martan , killing nine civilians , then tried to blame the attack on the Russian air_force . Russian air commanders claimed that not even reconnaissance flights had been made in the area . Up to 40 # 000 Russian troops moved_into Chechnya on Dec . 11 in a last-ditch Kremlin attempt to bring the rebellious republic to heel . The largely Muslim enclave of about 1.2 million people has put_up fierce resistance to the Russian incursion , and President Dzhokar M . Dudayev of Chechnya declared in a televised address Tuesday that his troops would go &quot; not one step back. &quot; After 17 days of halting Russian advances , however , the Chechnya offensive appeared to be entering a decisive new phase . In a televised speech Tuesday , Yeltsin instructed Russian troops not to delay in disarming the &quot; criminal gangs &quot; he blamed for hijacking , terrorism , train robbery and drug- and weapons-trafficking , and they responded by waging battles in and around Grozny with renewed vigor . Oleg I . Lobov , secretary of Yeltsin ' s Security_Council , said Wednesday that troops were intent_on bringing the city under_control gradually with a minimum of bloodshed . Grozny &quot; will not be taken by storm , but liberated , &quot; he declared . Nevertheless , the city shook under heavy bombing and shelling -- a deadly symphony of the deep booms of aviation bombs , the lighter thump of shelling and the staccato stutter of machine_guns , sometimes all sounding at once . &quot; They don ' t care where they bomb , &quot; said Magomed Khachkeyev , a soldier who came_to help evacuate the remaining 60 or so orphanage children to an outlying village . &quot; They want to erase the face of the city. &quot; A heavy battle raged in the town of Argun , 10 miles east of Grozny , where Chechen troops were trying to hold_off the Russian advance toward the capital . Truck-launched missiles and small arms fire dominated the ground exchanges as Russian bombardiers in helicopters flew overhead . Despite Russia ' s vastly superior might , Chechen fighters claimed they had surrounded and captured a group of Russian soldiers in Argun . They said they had offered to let the Russians go if they would lay_down their arms but that the captives responded that they lacked permission to surrender . Lobov said Russian forces had taken the town of Pervomayskoye after days of intensive fighting and that they now control the airport in Khankala , a suburb of Grozny , as well . On the psychological front , the Chechens hold a clear advantage . A fierce mountain people who fought czarist rule for decades in the 19th Century and were brutally deported by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin , they have no lack of motivation . Many Chechen commandos wear green bandannas , denoting their status as suicide fighters planning to sacrifice their lives to defend their homeland . But on a purely strategic plane , the Chechens are doomed to defeat by the military machine of the former superpower . The wrecked buildings lining many of the streets of central Grozny testify to more_than a week of Russian bombers attacking the city with impunity . The Children ' s World store just two blocks from Dudayev ' s presidential palace is a blown-out shell . The trees across the street are blackened skeletons . The pretty pink Kavkaz Hotel across from the palace has lost one wing and most of its windows . Dzerzhinsky Street , a small area where Chechnya ' s poshest shop used to stand , has nothing left of its storefronts but rubble . Near the entrance to the city ' s Microdistrict No . 1 on Wednesday , a large crater and the mangled , burned-out frames of six cars attested to the bomb that hit the intersection there . Sheets that had been used to cover charred corpses still lay on the ground . Along Grozny ' s snowy boulevards , building after building showed the marks of destruction . Several streets were flooded , and most of the city was without electricity . A music_school was in ruins . Chechen sources said that Russian planes also bombed a radio_transmitter in southwestern Grozny six times Wednesday morning , but missed . In Chechnya ' s central Republican Clinical Hospital , head_nurse Tatyana Kitayeva said missiles had destroyed two of the hospital ' s operating_rooms and that most of the wounded were being treated in a bomb_shelter turned_into a makeshift emergency ward . &quot; We have no antibiotics , not enough anesthetics , not enough fluids and we ' re short on bandages , &quot; Kitayeva said . &quot; We don ' t have enough of anything. &quot; The playground in the back yard of Orphanage No . 2 in the Leninsky district was cratered from the bombing attack . Whole families resigned to living_in the bomb_shelter until the fighting stops had reverted to a primitive existence , baking their own bread and snuggling together for warmth . &quot; Yeltsin is a fascist , &quot; said Nina Tsekhoyeva , a school administrator who moved_into the orphanage basement after her home was bombed a week ago . &quot; Dudayev may be bad , we may be bad , &quot; she said , &quot; but that doesn ' t mean we deserve this. &quot;</TEXT>
