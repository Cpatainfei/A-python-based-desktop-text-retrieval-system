   <HEADLINE> QUESTIONS URGED_ON DESIPRAMINE ; MEDICINE : PRESCRIBED FOR A VARIETY OF CHILDHOOD ILLS , THE DRUG HAS BEEN LINKED TO SUDDEN , UNEXPLAINED DEATHS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Parents of children who take a medication called desipramine should discuss its use with the prescribing doctor , experts say . The drug has been widely prescribed to children for hyperactivity , depression and bed-wetting at least since the early 1970s . But in the last few years it has been linked to several sudden , unexplained deaths in children . Dr. Barbara Geller of the Washington University School_of_Medicine in St . Louis , who investigates use of psychiatric medicines in children , said psychiatrists have been concerned for several years about the possibility of sudden_death in children taking desipramine . She said caution should be exercised when children or adolescents take any drug of this class ( called tricyclics ) , including imipramine , nortriptyline and chlomipramine . Imipramine is prescribed for bed-wetting more often than desipramine . Desipramine is the tricyclic most commonly prescribed for children , which may explain why it has received more attention , she said . But Dr. Mark Riddle , director of the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University , said he is particularly concerned about desipramine because of the reports of children ' s deaths in medical journals and the way the drug acts in the body . The topic made the news again late last year . The Register-Guard of Eugene , Ore. , reported that Food and Drug Administration records linked desipramine and imipramine to nearly 80 deaths in children since the early 1970s , and more deaths may have actually occurred . The reported number included at least a dozen suicides and a similar number of accidental overdoses . But Dr. Sandra Kweder , acting director of FDA ' s division of epidemiology and surveillance , told the Associated Press that she could not comment on the reported total of deaths without knowing more details . Desipramine ' s official prescribing guidelines include a warning about use in children . &quot; Our position is that desipramine should not be used in children , &quot; said Richard Johnson , spokesman for Marion Merrell Dow Inc. , one of several makers of desipramine . Doug Arbesfeld of Ciba-Geigy Corp. , which makes imipramine , said the company was aware of 13 deaths since 1973 in children taking that drug . Ten were overdoses , two involved a child taking multiple drugs and one death was apparently due_to injuries from child_abuse , he said . The company has not seen any reports of death from the drug ' s use at recommended doses , he said . Geller advised parents of children or adolescents who take any tricyclic to discuss it with the prescribing doctor so &quot; they can make informed decision about continuing with this medication. &quot; Parents should make_sure that every time the dose level is increased , the child ' s blood levels are checked and an electrocardiogram is performed , she said . If that has not happened , parents should get a second opinion from another doctor , she said . Similarly , before starting any tricyclic the child should have a thorough physical examination , including an electrocardiogram , and there should be no family history of sudden_death in relatives younger than 40 , she said . The reasons for the deaths in children taking desipramine or imipramine are not always known , Geller said . Apart from suicides , accidental overdoses and interactions with other medications , they could include causes unrelated to the drugs , she said . &quot; We need a lot more research and investigation ( into the reported deaths ) , and doctors need to be very careful in prescribing ( the drugs ) until there ' s more information , &quot; she said . Concern over desipramine ( pronounced day-ZIP-ra-meen ) dates_from June , 1990 , when a medical publication reported three cases of children who died while taking the drug , Riddle said . He and colleagues reported a fourth death last July . The children were two 8-year-old boys , a 9-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl . None had taken an overdose , Riddle said . Riddle said he thinks desipramine is still used fairly widely , but far less than it was before the 1990 report . &quot; I think that many , many clinicians are concerned . Although this risk may be very small , sudden_death of a child is obviously a big deal , &quot; he said . He and Geller said they think that psychiatrists who specialize in treating children and adolescents are generally informing parents of the risks of desipramine , because the topic has been stressed at professional meetings and in journals . Riddle said it is not clear whether that awareness campaign has reached other doctors who can prescribe the drug . The federally regulated official guidelines for prescribing desipramine warn that the drug is not recommended for use in children , because safety and effectiveness in them has not been established . They also warn that there have been several reports of sudden_death in children . Doctors can still legally prescribe the drug in children in what is called &quot; off-label &quot; use . Doctors who treat children often prescribe off-label because of a lack of information about many medications in children , Riddle said . &quot; If I didn ' t prescribe off-label , my ability to treat children effectively would be severely limited , &quot; he said . Some studies have shown desipramine to be safe and effective in children , but the research has not met the FDA ' s criteria for changing the prescribing guidelines , Riddle said . Desipramine &quot; has been a big help to a lot of my patients &quot; with depression or hyperactivity , Riddle said . But &quot; I ' m concerned about the drug and I don ' t use it unless I need to . . . . I ' m finding that most of the time I can provide quality care to my patients without using it. &quot; Geller said the decision whether to use desipramine can be complex , involving a weighing of risks and benefits . While there are several drugs for treating hyperactivity , she said , some children respond best to desipramine . And since hyperactivity can lead to drug_abuse and a tendency for minor and major accidents , withdrawing desipramine from one of those children would have its own risks , she said . Similarly , for depressed children who respond particularly well to desipramine , &quot; if you take it away , ( they ) may kill themselves . So again it ' s a risk-benefit ratio that ' s very complicated. &quot;</TEXT>
