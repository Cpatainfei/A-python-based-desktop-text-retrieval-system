   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : GARDEN GROVE ; TEACHER HAS PARTY OF THE CENTURY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Leone Jackson has learned anything in a century of living , it ' s how to have a birthday_party with class . Riding atop a white convertible Friday , Jackson cruised onto the Peters Elementary School campus , followed by a high_school marching band.More than 700 children cheered , wished her a happy birthday and showered her with homemade gifts . It was fitting for Jackson , who turns 100 years old today , to celebrate at school . A teacher since 1911 , Jackson works part time as an English and Spanish instructor . And Jackson ' s granddaughter , Gwynne McGuire , is now a teacher at Peters Elementary . &quot; It was real nice , &quot; Jackson said after the ceremony . She joked that few people would consider a 100th birthday &quot; a cause for celebration. &quot; Students called Jackson &quot; Grandma &quot; throughout the event and sang &quot; Happy Birthday &quot; ' several times . In return , Jackson taught the students a short skit about the flag in Spanish . After retiring from the school district in 1968 , Jackson served as the oldest volunteer in the Peace Corps .
