   <HEADLINE> 24 NATIONS ENDORSE DILUTED NUCLEAR SAFETY PACT ; ENERGY : ACCORD REACHED AT MEETING OF U.N. WATCHDOG AGENCY IS STRIPPED OF ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS . STILL , IT WINS PRAISE AS A FIRST_STEP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At least two_dozen nations endorsed an international convention on nuclear safety here Tuesday , but only after the accord was so watered down in the search for consensus that it contains virtually no means of enforcement . Efforts to deter smuggling of nuclear materials also have run_afoul of political and economic sensitivities at the annual general conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency , which is expected to deflect the volatile trafficking issue to a panel of experts . Like other international bodies navigating the turbulent political waters of the post-Cold War era , the nuclear watchdog of the United Nations has had to scale_down objectives to guarantee broad-based agreement . Russia and Bulgaria -- home to some of the world ' s most hazardous nuclear plants -- were among the first countries to endorse the convention brokered by the IAEA and committing signatories to general principles of reactor safety and periodic performance reviews . But the accord , originally aimed at extending Western safety practices to the aging and potentially dangerous reactors in the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet_Union , was stripped in negotiations of any provisions giving the agency real power to inspect or close_down substandard reactors . It relies_on a &quot; peer_review process &quot; to assess the performance of participating countries on the basis of_their_own written evaluations . Nevertheless , the accord won praise as the first_step toward creating an international safety umbrella . &quot; It is the first legal_instrument to address directly the issue of safety of nuclear installations worldwide , &quot; said IAEA Director Hans Blix . U.S. Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary noted that only five years ago , the concept of outside evaluations would not have gained general approval because of the mistrust that pervaded the world . O ' Leary acknowledged a need for Western consideration of the economic and social consequences that would result from forced shutdowns at reactors widely regarded_as unsafe . The six-reactor facility at Kozloduy , in Bulgaria , provides up_to 40 % of national electricity and employs 5 # 000 in an economically devastated country . Ukraine , home of the Chernobyl plant that in 1986 was the scene of the world ' s worst nuclear disaster , has not signed the convention but has indicated to IAEA officials that it intends to do so . Following the seizure in Germany of four separate caches of smuggled plutonium and highly enriched uranium since May , Western nations have used the IAEA forum to press for more effective controls on the components of nuclear_weapons . German authorities suspect that the materials they have seized from illegal traffickers came from poorly guarded facilities in the former Soviet_Union . A German deputy minister for research and technology , Gebhard Ziller , appealed_to the IAEA for urgent action to curb the black-market trade . But that focus_on Russia and Ukraine has ruffled political feathers at the IAEA , prompting O ' Leary and Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov to play_down the risks and diffuse the responsibility for smuggling incidents . &quot; It has to be said there has been much speculation on this score , which at times is insulting to the Russian people , &quot; Mikhailov said of accusations he described as &quot; provocation. &quot; O ' Leary suggested Monday that the international public had been unduly alarmed by &quot; almost hysterical reporting &quot; of the small-quantity trafficking arrests , but she conceded a day later that the nuclear agency should play a lead role in &quot; policing and surveillance. &quot; While the IAEA has no police powers , it has experience tracking nuclear material sources from its role as monitor of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . Blix has proposed convening an international commission to examine control procedures at nuclear material sources and recommend ways in which they could be strengthened . For the first time in three years , the IAEA general conference has been dominated by an issue other_than North_Korean intransigence on opening its nuclear plant doors to foreign inspection . The international standoff with North_Korea persists , however , as Pyongyang stands accused of concealing stores of plutonium and barring international inspectors from two facilities thought to be engaged in production of nuclear_weapons . Washington is negotiating with North_Korea to gain access to the suspected weapons plants . A fresh round of talks is set for Friday in Geneva . North_Korea withdrew from the IAEA in June after the agency denounced the hard-line Communist country for violating safety and inspection agreements .</TEXT>
