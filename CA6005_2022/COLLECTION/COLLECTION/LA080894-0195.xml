   <HEADLINE> REFORMER WOULD IRON_OUT TAX WRINKLES ; REVENUE : O.C. MAN WANTS TO REPLACE COMPLEX STATE SYSTEM WITH A FLAT 2 1 / 2 % LEVY ON ALL INCOME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like many Americans , Roland Boucher has long been irked and befuddled by the weblike complexity of the California income_tax code . But while the rest of us merely groan and mail off our returns every April 15 , this Orange County retiree wants to change the system . Along with two other , like-minded reformers , Boucher is trying to inspire what could become California ' s next great tax revolt . Drawn together by Ross Perot ' s unsuccessful presidential quest , the three have recruited an army of 1 # 500 volunteers to help qualify a proposition for the 1996 statewide ballot that would dramatically simplify the tax code . Calling themselves United Californians for Tax Reform and operating out of a cramped office near Orange County ' s John Wayne Airport , the reformers propose that the state adopt a &quot; flat tax &quot; at 2 1 / 2 % of a worker ' s annual income . that ' s the equivalent of one hour ' s wages each week ( the group ' s motto : &quot; An hour a week is all Sacramento gets_to keep &quot; ) and is a fraction of current state income_tax rates , which rise as high as 11 % . The group is hardly alone in it ' s dogged pursuit of the perfect flat tax . The concept has been embraced by politicians as disparate as Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr . and Bruce Herschensohn . In Washington , Rep . Dick Armey ( R-Tex. ) and several other congressmen are pushing various versions of a federal flat tax these days . Closer to home , Reagan-era economist Arthur Laffer has been busy drafting a flat tax initiative of_his_own for the 1996 statewide ballot . In each case , simplicity is a paramount part of the sales pitch . United Californians for Tax Reform boasts that its flat tax proposal is so uncomplicated that returns would be filed on postcard-sized forms , not the current maze of returns , rate schedules and indecipherable instructions . &quot; I think there ' s great populist appeal in the idea of a simplified tax_form , &quot; said Steve Hayward , research_director at Pacific Research Institute , a conservative think_tank in San Francisco . &quot; This could become one of the political ideas of the 1990s. &quot; While the stated purpose is not to cut taxes , boosters suggest that a streamlined tax code would give the economy a boost . The cost of tax preparers , accountants and attorneys would be a thing of the past . Investors , meanwhile , could focus_on economic considerations rather than the art of avoiding taxes . The concept of a flat tax has been embraced by many conservatives , but most Democrats remain unconvinced . Opponents argue that flat taxes favor the rich , who stand to gain with lowered rates . Moreover , critics suggest that the flat tax would limit government ' s ability to handle the inevitable emergency . &quot; It ' s a can of worms , &quot; said state Sen . Leroy Greene ( D-Carmichael ) , chairman of the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee . &quot; They ' re saying we know everything that ' s going_to happen , every cost to the state , and that ' s not the case . What about the Medfly , the occasional riot , earthquakes ? Throw_in the cost of a deep_freeze or two . Have they figured that into the equation ? &quot; Greene also worries that trying to revamp the state tax_system via the initiative process is an exercise fraught with peril . Instead of going_through &quot; the crucible &quot; of countless legislative hearings before experts on the subject , he said , the initiatives are the product of only a_few minds -- and once in place , they are harder to correct . &quot; The odds are , &quot; Greene said , &quot; they got_it wrong. &quot; Boucher and others , however , figure they ' re on the right track . A review by the state Legislative Analyst concluded that the proposal put forth by United Californians for Tax Reform could cost $ 179 million each year in lost revenue . But the group insists that sort of revenue loss -- roughly 1 % of the more_than $ 16 billion in income_taxes now collected by the state -- would hardly bankrupt California . To help ease the transition from the status_quo , an additional 2 1 / 2 % tax would be assessed for the first five years on all individual annual income exceeding $ 52 # 000 . Moreover , the group argues that a simplified tax_system would spur enough economic_growth to offset any shortfall . Boucher contends that the flat tax also would help squelch the endless political shenanigans in Sacramento , where lawmakers swayed by special_interest campaign contributions have created a tax code with more loopholes than Swiss_cheese . Moreover , a single_tax for all would provide less incentive for individual taxpayers to cheat . &quot; We ' ve made a nightmare out of this thing over a 70-year period and it ' s time to fix it , &quot; declared Boucher , a former aerospace manager who became frustrated with the Byzantine state and federal tax_system after he launched his own business in the 1970s selling radio-controlled toy cars . &quot; Every person making an equal income ought to pay equal taxes . That means no deductions , credits , exemptions . Nothing. &quot; He and his cohorts -- Paul Arndt , who worked with Boucher at Hughes Aircraft and is now retired in Leisure World , and real_estate manager Charles Alvord -- hope they can spark a revolution that will spread across the United States . But , so far , they ' re having a rough time just in California . Despite the big corps of volunteers and a snappy phone_number , ( 800 ) 540-FLAT , United Californians for Tax Reform has collected only 50 # 000 signatures for the measure , far short of the 376 # 000 they ' ll need by the end of September to qualify for the ballot . Meanwhile , the group is short on cash , and no politicians have come_forward to offer money or help . They also haven ' t even been able to get an endorsement or much assistance from United We Stand , the grass-roots group formed by Perot followers after the 1992 presidential race . &quot; We ' ve been ignored , &quot; lamented Boucher . &quot; We have no prior political history . Everyone is saying , ' Who the hell are you ? ' &quot; Even some sympathetic politicians are staying away . Assemblyman Curt Pringle ( R-Garden Grove ) supports the concept of flat taxes , but doesn ' t like the group ' s insistence on absolutely no deductions . &quot; There are some deductions that are vital to maintain for the economic and public good , &quot; Pringle said . &quot; The two I ' m concerned about are charitable and mortgage deductions . It ' s the right thing to encourage people to give to charity . And it ' s the American_dream to own a home . We should encourage that in tax policy. &quot; Even if they don ' t make this year ' s deadline for gathering signatures , Boucher and the rest have time on their side before 1996 and have vowed to take_up the cause again next year . If they make the ballot , the plan would likely end_up in direct competition with an alternative flat-tax proposal being sculpted by Laffer , the economist who helped inspire Reaganomics with his &quot; Laffer Curve &quot; and other principles . Laffer ' s idea , which is similar to the proposal pushed by former California Gov . Brown during the 1992 presidential race , is to eliminate all taxes -- everything from sales and property_taxes to levies on business and income -- and replace them with a flat tax that would be the same for individuals and business . The proposal is still being tinkered with , but the idea is to ensure that taxes collected by state and local_government remain at 10.71 % of the personal_income of California residents . Laffer ' s plan also allows a_few exemptions -- donations to charities , mortgage interest or rent payments , social_security and disability income . &quot; This is not a tax cut , &quot; Laffer said . &quot; This is just readjusting taxes to make them efficient , so people don ' t spend all their time on accountants or lawyers. &quot; While the Orange County group is struggling to collect signatures , Laffer has joined forces with an old_hand at state ballot measures -- People ' s Advocate Inc. , the direct mail group created by the late Paul Gann , co-author of Proposition 13 . Laffer said more_than $ 400 # 000 has been raised toward the signature-gathering effort , which has yet to begin . Boucher , for one , is quick to criticize Laffer ' s proposal . He worries that it would give lawmakers in Sacramento too_much power to determine how much revenue is returned to cities and counties . He doesn ' t like its deductions . And he hates the nature of its support . &quot; I notice it ' s being backed by people with money in their pockets , &quot; he said . &quot; They ' re not the average Joe . That makes me wonder about it. &quot; Flat-Lining the Tax Code The flat-tax proposal would change how state income_taxes are paid and the amounts collected . Main provisions of the flat tax proposal and scenarios for three income levels : Provisions * Replaces present rate , which ranges up_to 11 % , with a uniform 2.5 % rate . * Applies to all personal_income . * Allows no deductions , no exemptions and no tax_credits . * Deducts state income_taxes from wages , as Social_Security is now deducted . * Replaces present form with a postcard-size form with just 10 lines . * Indexes capital_gains held more_than three years against inflation . * Applies a 2.5 % surcharge on yearly income exceeding $ 52 # 000 for first five years . * Allows extension of surcharge only by two-thirds vote of Legislature , without modification , and in five-year increments . Three hypothetical examples of how the flat-tax proposal would pencil out for various income levels : 04 # 28 , 09 # 09 , 10 INCOME 1 . Wages $ 25 # 000 $ 60 # 000 $ 125 # 000 2 . Interest / dividends 5 # 000 10 # 000 3 . Sale of capital assets 5 # 000 4 . Other 5 # 000 5 . Total $ 25 # 000 $ 65 # 000 $ 145 # 000 TAXES 6 . Baseline tax $ 625 $ 1 # 625 $ 3 # 625 7 . Surcharge 325 2 # 325 8 . Total tax 625 1 # 950 5 # 950 9 . Tax withheld ( from W-2 ) 625 1 # 700 4 # 950 10 . Tax due $ $ 250 $ 1 # 000 Source : United Californians for Tax Reform</TEXT>
