   <HEADLINE> SANCTIONS PUT SQUEEZE ON IRAQ ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Behind Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein ' s latest act of military bluster lies the harsh reality of an economy imploding under the weight of international sanctions . Analysts and economists said Saturday that Baghdad ' s complaints about the sanctions reflect the very real hardships that four years of restrictions have placed on the country ' s oil-driven economy . Iraq ' s top diplomat , Deputy Prime_Minister Tarik Aziz , said in a U.N. speech Friday that the sanctions are leading to malnutrition , inadequate medical_care and widespread suffering . Conditions appear to have reached a critical level in recent months , analysts said , which may explain Hussein ' s decision to move now . &quot; I think there is no doubt the sanctions have had an impact on the general population of Iraq , &quot; said James Placke , a Middle_East analyst with Cambridge Energy Research , an oil_industry consulting firm . &quot; The regime has taken steps to protect its security apparatus and to a lesser extent its military from the brunt of the sanctions , but it is clear there has been some impact there as well. &quot; Iraq ' s inflation_rate is now more_than 1 # 000 % annually , and its currency is virtually worthless . Government-imposed monthly rations for rice , sugar , cooking_oil and flour have been halved in the last few weeks , and hunger and starvation are now said to be commonplace , according to international observers who have visited Iraq recently . There are reports that as_many as 500 Iraqi soldiers are deserting from Iraq ' s 400 # 000-strong military each month , and there are signs that much of the country ' s remaining military equipment is only marginally serviceable , Iraqi dissidents have said . &quot; The military is finding it very difficult to obtain spare_parts for its equipment , and it is clear that its readiness is nowhere near the levels it achieved &quot; before the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War , Placke said . Indeed , every industry in the country faces critical shortages of parts and equipment , and the average Iraqi household is being forced to make_do despite shortages of almost every necessity . The deprivation has led to a rising tide of violent crime , much of which is reportedly being committed by members of Hussein ' s ruling clique , desperate to survive the crisis , say dissidents and Western journalists reporting from Baghdad . The deterioration can be traced , in large measure , to Iraq ' s loss of its main source of foreign revenue : oil exports . Before the Persian_Gulf_War , Iraq was producing as much as 3.3 million barrels of oil per day , the bulk of which went_for export . Today , analysts believe that only a small trickle of Iraqi oil is making its way_out of the country through cracks in the U.N. embargo , mostly to neighboring Jordan . Hussein is reportedly so desperate that he has invited foreign oil_companies to open potentially lucrative negotiations for future drilling and exploration , hoping to get the industry poised for rebirth after the sanctions are lifted . As the sanctions bite into Iraqi society , they offer one of the few instances in recent history when international economic restrictions have had a significant impact on an aggressor nation . Recent efforts to use economic sanctions against Haiti and the rump Yugoslavia , for example , did not bring_about U.S. or U.N. policy objectives . The sanctions ' failure in Haiti to force_out a military junta created conditions that led the U.S. to intervene to reinstate exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . But the impact of sanctions on Iraq shows that &quot; it is dangerous to generalize about the effectiveness of sanctions , &quot; noted Jeffrey Sachs , an international economist at Harvard_University . &quot; Sometimes they work , sometimes they don ' t . It all depends_on the context , on the commitment of the international community to adhere to them and on what you are trying to accomplish with the sanctions , &quot; Sachs said . &quot; But just because they were unsuccessful in Haiti doesn ' t mean you will see the same result in Iraq. &quot; On the other hand , the sanctions against Iraq certainly would not have struck so deep if they had not been preceded by the devastating 1991 military defeat of Hussein ' s army . And even with that war as a backdrop , the sanctions have still not yet achieved their primary purpose of forcing Hussein ' s regime to alter its behavior and comply with all_of the U.N. resolutions imposed after the war .</TEXT>
