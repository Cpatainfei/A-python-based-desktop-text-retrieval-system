   <HEADLINE> OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS : FOURSOME BEATS FEARSOME IN LION ATTACK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Californians have had their share of encounters with wild animals this year , but few have been as bizarre as the one involving a mountain_lion and a group of vacationers Tuesday morning in a remote section of Mendocino County . An investigation still was under way Tuesday afternoon , but the following was released by officials with the California Department of Fish and Game : -- At about 4:30 a.m. , four adults staying in an isolated cabin near the small_town of Dos Rios were awakened by their dog , a collie , outside fighting a lion . When the humans appeared , the lion hid under the cabin and the dog took_off running . -- The two couples gathered what weapons they could find -- a shovel , a hatchet and a kitchen knife -- and tried to scare the lion off . They were unsuccessful and decided to build a fire , outside , for warmth . -- They were standing by the fire when the lion charged from beneath the cabin , running past one woman and attacking the other . Her companions jumped_on the cat and killed it . &quot; They had this variety of implements and they whomped on this poor cat , &quot; said Brian Hunter , a spokesman for the DFG . But the cat didn ' t die without inflicting some damage . It apparently bit off one man ' s thumb and , before the humans got involved , had bitten the dog on the face . -- The two couples and the dog hiked a mile and crossed a river to get_to their 4-wheel-drive vehicle and , four hours after the attack , reached a hospital in Dos Rios . It was too late to reattach the man ' s thumb , but none of the other injuries was serious . -- The lion was a sub-adult , between 50 and 60 pounds and apparently healthy at the time of the attack . Mendocino County has one of the highest densities of mountain_lions in the state , Hunter said . * Business is anything but brisk these days at Cabo San Lucas . After all , it ' s chubasco , or hurricane season . It ' s too hot , too humid and people generally don ' t want to risk being blown_out of the water . These people are wrong , according to some . &quot; In my opinion , August is absolutely the best month to go_fishing down here , &quot; said Tracy Ehrenberg , owner of the Pisces Fleet at Land ' s End . &quot; People think October and January are the good months , but in August you can catch a blue_marlin , 100-pound tuna and 50-pound dorado all_in the same day. &quot; These days , they ' re also catching yellowfin_tuna close to 200 pounds . Some of the battles are so_long that the sharks are catching_up_with the tuna . &quot; We ' ve had several come_in with their tails bitten_off by sharks , &quot; Ehrenberg said . Ehrenberg said she hasn ' t seen a tuna bite this consistent in a_few years , with 10- to 60-pound fish outside the harbor and the larger ones cruising with the marlin and sharks 10-20 miles offshore . And so far , she added , the tropical storms and hurricanes have generated large swells , wind and some rain , but have yet to put a damper on the fishing . * The Southland is sweltering under an unbearably hot August sun , but there seems to be some good coming from it . The sun and lack of westerly winds have been warming the water and it could be only a matter of time before sub-tropical fish start appearing locally as they did during El Nino last season . The First String_out of L.A. Harbor Sportfishing on Monday found a school of yellowfin at the outer banks , landing four before running_out of bait . And a 24-pound dorado was weighed in at Catalina Island on Saturday , another indication of better things to come . The marlin count at Avalon is up_to nine and the broadbill swordfish count is at two , with most billfish being taken at the 277-fathom spot off the east end of the island . * The State Wildlife Conservation Board has approved the purchase by the state -- at a cost of $ 1.7 million -- of 1 # 300 acres along seven miles of the East Walker River in Mono County . The action will preserve habitat and access along a section of river from Bridgeport Reservoir to within two miles of the Nevada border . The East Walker was once a famed brown_trout fishery and still is recovering from a massive water discharge and fish kill in 1988 . Canada_geese , bald and golden_eagles , prairie falcons , beavers , minks , bears and other animals also utilize the habitat . The money will come from the Habitat Conservation Fund , created by the 1990 passage of Prop . 117 . * With hunting_season getting under way , the DFG is offering hunter-safety courses on Saturday and on Aug . 27 &amp; 28 at Raahague ' s Pheasant Hunting_Club in Norco . The classes -- mandatory for obtaining hunting_licenses -- last 10 hours and cost $ 30 . Details : ( 800 ) 773-4868 .</TEXT>
