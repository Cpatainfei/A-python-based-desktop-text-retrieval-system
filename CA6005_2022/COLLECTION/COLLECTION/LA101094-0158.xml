   <HEADLINE> HAITIAN MILITARY RULERS EXPECTED TO RESIGN TODAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Increased U.S. pressure paid_off Sunday as diplomatic sources said that Haitian army commander Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras and the army chief_of_staff , Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby , will resign today , clearing the way for exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return without major distraction . Cedras and Biamby are required by an agreement signed last month to give_up their posts no later than Saturday , the expected date of Aristide ' s arrival . But U.S. officials pressed the two relentlessly to give_up power immediately and to accept exile even though the agreement does not require either man to leave Haiti . To make_sure the message was clear , Cedras was told during a Sunday afternoon meeting with Lt . Gen . Hugh Shelton , the commander of U.S. troops here , that he and Biamby should retire before the Saturday deadline and get_out of the country . &quot; Monday would be good , but no later than Wednesday , &quot; is the way one U.S. military source described the gist of Shelton ' s remarks to Cedras . The military_leader then relented , a diplomat said . &quot; The decision was made after the meeting with Shelton . It ' s a good thing , &quot; the diplomat said . In addition to Cedras and Biamby , U.S. officials said they want nearly all_of the Haitian military high_command to leave_office , the only exception being Brig . Gen . Jean-Claude Duperval , who will be given temporary command of the army . The new high_command , which will also serve on an interim basis , will be composed of lower-ranking colonels and lieutenant_colonels thought to have little personal allegiance to the departing officers and who were not directly involved in the Sept . 30 , 1991 , coup that drove Aristide from office . Throughout the day Sunday , there was confusion over when Cedras and Biamby actually were expected to leave_office . Various sources claiming to be close to Cedras gave varying information about the exact timing of the two generals ' resignations . Some sources said the two men will step_down this morning ; others said with equal confidence that the two will submit resignations Tuesday to be effective Wednesday . Another simply said Sunday that &quot; it will take_place within the next 48 hours. &quot; And Defense_Secretary William J . Perry told a television interviewer Sunday , &quot; I believe he ( Cedras ) will leave and soon. &quot; Earlier in the day , White_House Chief_of_Staff Leon E . Panetta , on NBC-TV ' s &quot; Meet the Press , &quot; said he could not confirm reports that Cedras will resign today . &quot; I can ' t confirm that at this point , but , clearly , we have this mission on track right now , &quot; he said . &quot; It is a stable situation . There ' s calm that ' s been restored to the country . President Aristide is prepared to return . We have the Parliament in place . I think in a matter of days we will see democracy restored to Haiti , and that was the fundamental goal of the President ' s policy with_regards_to that area , &quot; he said . Also expected to give_up office is Emile Jonassaint , the military ' s puppet civilian president , who has also resisted leaving the Presidential Palace . &quot; He will go either voluntarily or by being physically prevented from going_to his office , &quot; one source said . Wednesday had been the choice of most experts for the end of the brutal and corrupt military rule because that is the day Cedras ' appointment as army commander expires . &quot; He is still holding_out for Wednesday , &quot; a Cedras associate had said just before Shelton arrived_at Cedras ' hillside home overlooking Port-au-Prince . &quot; He wants to claim he served his term , didn ' t leave under ( U.S. ) pressure . He also wants a dignified ceremony. &quot; Two motives impelled U.S. officials to widen the interval between the Cedras-Biamby departures and Aristide ' s return , expected Saturday afternoon . &quot; We want the last rallying_point of anti-Aristide forces_out of here , &quot; one U.S. official said . &quot; We want them to see that they have no hope , that they lost and that their leaders have given_up and left. &quot; Officials also want time to prepare_for Aristide and the large contingent of foreign officials , diplomats and other public figures expected here for his return . &quot; We have a lot to do , &quot; one U.S. official said , &quot; and we need time to prepare_for ( Aristide ' s ) arrival. &quot; One U.S. source said Sunday that the Administration is considering having Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and other officials accompany Aristide when he returns to Haiti . Although most of the attention has been_on Cedras , the Americans also worked hard to the last minute to get an early resignation from Biamby , who is considered to have more loyalty among the 7 # 000 Haitian soldiers . Both men , along with Port-au-Prince Police_Chief Michel-Joseph Francois , were required to step_down by the agreement hammered_out by a mission led by former President Jimmy_Carter last month . Francois quit last week and drove into exile in the neighboring Dominican_Republic . One source said that while Biamby will formally resign with Cedras , the chief_of_staff turned_in his letter of resignation Saturday . &quot; I know he packed his things and closed his office &quot; Saturday , the source said . Even after Shelton left Cedras on Sunday afternoon , it was uncertain if either Cedras or Biamby will leave Haiti , although a source who knows them both said they will leave before Saturday . &quot; The talk now is of Chile , &quot; the source said , &quot; at least at the beginning. &quot; Family friends of Cedras say that he will ultimately end_up in Spain , where he owns two homes , but that Biamby , who is not known for his worldliness , could go_to Chile as the guest of Gen . Augusto Pinochet , the onetime dictator who still heads his nation ' s military . On Sunday , Cedras finally showed signs of accepting reality . He donned full ceremonial uniform in the morning and drove to Jonassaint ' s house for a formal visit . His convoy of large four-wheel-drive vehicles and an accompanying pickup_truck loaded with armed Haitian soldiers then drove to the Haitian Military_Academy , where he graduated first in his class in 1973 and later taught . From there Cedras went_to military_headquarters in downtown Port-au-Prince for a conference with other officers of the military high_command . Instead of making a triumphant or even a nostalgic final tour , Cedras was forced to confront criticism from other officers for failing to defend their interests and for making last-minute assignments and transfers that allegedly favored his friends . The sources said that several colonels , including Diderot Sylvain , commander of the prestigious National Palace Guard , presented their resignations . That Cedras had lost not only power but also respect from his men was evident from one of the soldiers guarding his house during the Shelton meeting . &quot; You all know the general doesn ' t like you being here , &quot; Pvt . Jonas Ferel told reporters gathered by Cedras ' gated house . &quot; But I don ' t care if you stay or go . . . . I ' m cool , whatever happens. &quot; Times staff writer Tracy Wilkinson contributed to this report from Port-au-Prince , and staff writer James Risen contributed from Washington . * 14 DIE IN ATTACK WITH BUS : Aristide backers are run_down in second such incident .
