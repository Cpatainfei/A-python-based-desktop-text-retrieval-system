   <HEADLINE> FED HIKES INTEREST_RATES ; INCREASE IS BIGGEST OF THE YEAR ; ECONOMY : BOOST OF THREE-QUARTERS OF A POINT IN FUNDS RATE AND DISCOUNT_RATE REAFFIRMS CENTRAL_BANK ' S FIGHT ON INFLATION . CRITICS SEE DANGERS TO GROWTH AND JOB CREATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Federal_Reserve_Board signaled its commitment Tuesday to quash any evidence of inflation by raising its two benchmark interest_rates by three-quarters of a percentage_point each , marking the central_bank ' s sixth and largest increase of the year . The Federal_Reserve took the aggressive move_in the face of mounting criticism that it has already gone too far this year to restrain economic_growth and job creation to curb the potential threat of rising prices . The action to raise rates was the first since August . The seven-member Federal_Reserve_board of governors voted unanimously to raise the bank ' s discount_rate -- the rate it charges commercial_banks -- from 4 % to 4.75 % . In a separate meeting , the Fed ' s open market committee voted to increase the more influential federal funds rate , the interest that banks charge each other on overnight loans , by three-quarters of a point as well , to 5.5 % . The Fed ' s actions were quickly followed by increases of three-quarters of a point by commercial_banks in their prime rates to 8.5 % -- increasing borrowing costs for millions of Americans with variable rate loans tied to the prime . Tuesday ' s Federal_Reserve action seemed to be a departure from Chairman Alan Greenspan ' s strategy of gradualism in setting interest_rate policy and suggested that he and senior officials of the central_bank now believe that the economy is growing at a stronger pace than they had anticipated . The five previous rate increases this year were either quarter-point or half-point moves . The decision Tuesday for larger increases appears to be an acknowledgment that Federal_Reserve officials had underestimated the strength of the economy . Even though Greenspan and other central_bank officials acknowledge that there are few signs of rising prices , they believe that it is crucial for them to take preemptive action against inflation . Greenspan has argued that monetary policy acts with a long lag time and that , if the Federal_Reserve waits to strike until inflation is evident in the economy , it will be too late to stabilize prices . Suddenly raising rates at that point could disrupt economic activity . The nation ' s inflation_rate stands at 2.7 % for the first nine months of the year , with the consumer_price_index for September up two-tenths of a point , the last month for which figures are available . The index rose by three-tenths of a percentage_point in each of the three previous months . The Federal_Reserve ' s decision to get_ahead of what it sees as &quot; the inflationary curve &quot; pleased some economists . &quot; It was appropriate -- in fact it was overdue , &quot; said Cynthia Latta , an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill , an economic consulting_firm based in Lexington , Mass . &quot; I think the Fed has had trouble keeping_up with economic_growth -- each month we seem to see higher forecasts -- and so the Fed decided to get_ahead of it for once. &quot; &quot; It ' s a good move . It cleared the air of a lot of uncertainty in the markets about how far and how fast the Fed would go , &quot; added economist Scott Pardee , chairman of Yamaichi International ( America ) Inc. Others , however , expressed criticism of the action . &quot; Continuing this policy of raising interest_rates not only endangers the economic expansion but it hurts working men and women who have not seen their wages keep_up with the expanding economy , &quot; said House Budget Committee Chairman Martin Olav Sabo ( D-Minn. ) . And , while most of the criticism came from Democrats and liberal groups , some business_leaders and Republicans also expressed growing concern about what they view_as overly aggressive Federal_Reserve policies . Jerry Jasinowski , an economist and president of the National Assn . of Manufacturers , said that Tuesday ' s action &quot; was not necessary . While the economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter , there is not much evidence of inflation . The Fed is fundamentally misreading the American economy. &quot; In addition , Sen . Alfonse M . D ' Amato ( R-N.Y. ) , who is expected to become the next chairman of the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Development Committee , which has oversight responsibilities for the central_bank , declared that &quot; inflation is practically nonexistent. &quot; He said that the Federal_Reserve has &quot; acted cautiously to assure that it does not become a problem , &quot; but said he hopes &quot; these actions today will not contribute to weakening economic prospects. &quot; Since Feb . 4 , the central_bank has increased the federal funds rate -- which is widely considered to be the Federal_Reserve ' s most important monetary policy tool -- by 2.50 percentage_points . Economists said that in the past federal funds rate increases of two to three percentage_points have been enough to slow the U.S. economy and anything above that level has pushed the country into a recession . Most economists are now betting that the Federal_Reserve has moved far enough to avoid the threat of rising prices next year but not so far that its policies will lead to a recession . Economists generally expect the economy to undergo a sharp slowdown next year because of the central_bank actions , reducing overall economic_growth to below 2.5 % from this year ' s pace of about 3.9 % . But many Federal_Reserve officials and conservative economists believe that economic_growth cannot be sustained above 2.5 % without risking higher inflation and so are committed to that growth_rate as a key target for monetary policy . The rate decision came_on a day when the government reported that retail sales jumped by an unexpectedly strong 1.1 % in October and U.S. industry operated at 84.9 % of capacity last month , the highest level in nearly 15 years . Tuesday ' s strong action has convinced many economists that the central_bank has finally caught_up_with the pace of economic_growth and will not raise rates again in its next major policy meeting in December . Many observers think that it may be able to put_off another rate hike until February or even later . &quot; It ' s a pretty large move and they clearly wanted to make a statement that they are here , they are in_charge and that they will take_care of inflation , &quot; observed Donald Ratajczak , an economist at Georgia State University . But that enthusiasm for the Federal_Reserve strategy was not shared by the central_bank ' s widening circle of critics , ranging from leading business_executives to unemployed workers and lawmakers -- who argued that the central_bank ' s focus_on price stability is choking_off the nation ' s recovery as it is beginning to generate more jobs and higher wages . Hundreds of unemployed workers and other protesters demonstrated outside the central_bank ' s Washington headquarters , chanting for Greenspan to change his mind and hold_down rates . &quot; We came here to tell them to stop raising rates . It ' s making the job outlook very gloomy , &quot; said Lester Thomas , a 54-year-old unemployed sheet_metal worker from Philadelphia , as he protested outside the Fed headquarters . Tracking the Increases The Fed ' s policy-making panel raised short-term interest_rates for the sixth time this year . In its statement , the Fed sought to signal its resolve to fight any reappearance of inflation . 1994 Federal Funds Increases : The federal funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans : Nov . 15 : 5.50 % 1994 Discount Rate Increases : The discount_rate is the interest the Fed charges to make direct_loans to banks . Nov . 15 : 4.75 % 30-Year Fixed Home Mortgage Rates Nov. : 9.22 %</TEXT>
