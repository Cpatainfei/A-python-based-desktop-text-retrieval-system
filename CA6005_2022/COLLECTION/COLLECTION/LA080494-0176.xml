   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; GAINS OF MTA , UNION DON ' T MATCH STRIKE TOLL ON RIDERS ; TRANSIT : NINE-DAY WALKOUT REVEALS POWERLESSNESS OF THOSE WHO RELY ON BUSES . LOCAL BUSINESSES ALSO SUFFERED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the Metropolitan Transportation Authority put three-quarters of its buses back on_the_road Wednesday after a nine-day strike , sobering lessons emerged from the labor dispute . One is that the MTA and its striking mechanics achieved painfully little compared to the agony the strike caused for half a_million virtually stranded bus riders . The strike cost the local economy $ 18 million , according to county analysts -- twice as much as the MTA will save during the three years of the new labor_contract for its 1 # 900 mechanics . In addition , in the months ahead , agency officials expect to encounter uncalculated costs . For example , the combined effects of the strike and a Sept . 1 fare increase are expected to cut ridership by almost 15 % this fall -- and some of that loss may be permanent . The second lesson of the strike is that Los Angeles ' mass transit riders -- most of whom earn less than $ 15 # 000 a year -- are a politically powerless group , especially in contrast to those of other U.S. cities . In other mass-transit-dependent cities , where the automobile is less crucial to survival , far more people at various income levels would be affected by a transit strike -- and far more political pressure would have been wielded to prevent one , or to settle it with more urgency , experts say . By contrast , at one point in the MTA strike last week , talks adjourned for 2 1 / 2 days with no political outcry . And there was little public dismay when Gov . Pete Wilson refused to order a 60-day cooling-off period that would have prevented a strike or cut it short . &quot; Los Angeles , while it certainly depends_on the transit system , it ' s not like Manhattan . It ' s not like Chicago , or Boston , or even Washington , D.C. , which have highly developed rail systems that are_well established , that people depend_on , &quot; said Jack Gilstrap , executive_vice_president of the American Public_Transit Assn . and a former general_manager of the now-defunct Southern California Rapid_Transit District . &quot; The more dependence there is_on the transit system , the less likely you are to have these long and devastating strikes. &quot; In New York and other major cities , transportation serves a large economic swath of the population : lawyers , janitors , factory laborers and students board the subways and buses . In addition , New York state law -- unlike California ' s -- prohibits municipal transit employees from going_on strike . The MTA ' s labor_unions evolved from those of the powerful railroad workers . When the private bus carriers and old trolley_lines were taken_over in the 1950s by a new public entity , the transit unions secured a waiver from the California Legislature that made them exempt from a ban on strikes by &quot; essential &quot; public employees , such_as police and fire_departments . &quot; There ' s a lot more pressure on the political establishment ( in New York ) to make such a strike difficult , &quot; said Jared Lebow , a spokesman for New York City Transit . When New York transit workers broke the law and held an 11-day walkout in April , 1980 , the punishment was quick and severe : Union_members were docked pay_for 22 days and the unions themselves were fined several million dollars . In Southern California , where the majority of workers commute by automobile , victims of a transit strike are virtually voiceless . According to a transit agency study , 61 % of Los Angeles bus riders earn less than $ 15 # 000 and only 5 % make more_than $ 50 # 000 . Studies show that low-income people are less likely to vote . As a result , with little public pressure to settle the MTA strike , &quot; we faced a situation in which the agency and union both pursued their own interests at the expense of riders , &quot; said James Moore , associate_professor of urban_planning and co-director of USC ' s Center for Advanced Transportation Technologies . Against that backdrop , politics began to snowball . The governor heeded the request of the MTA board not to intervene , despite a brief attack by state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown , the Democratic candidate for governor . Had Wilson demanded the 60-day cooling-off period , it would have potentially postponed a transit strike until September -- a time closer to the November election , and a time when a broader cross-section of bus riders might be affected : In September , hundreds of thousands of students use buses to get_to school . In July , Brown ' s complaints were nothing but &quot; a one-day story , &quot; said Rich Lichtenstein , a political consultant and lobbyist . &quot; The MTA bus strike will be long forgotten by the time the elections roll_around . . . . When do you want the impact of a strike ? From the point of . . . the gubernatorial campaign , you ' d much rather have it in the quiet of the summer when it will receive much less attention than in the fall. &quot; The riders ' interests also paled beside internal politics on both sides of the labor dispute . On the one side , Mike Bujosa , president of the Amalgamated Transit Union , representing the mechanics , is up for reelection in November -- a fact some say made_it imperative that he take a tough stance . Bujosa was also under pressure to flex the union ' s muscle in response to the MTA ' s decision last month to cut costs by laying_off 83 mechanics while negotiations were under way . &quot; The timing could not have been worse , &quot; said one MTA official . Here was a union head backed into a corner : negotiating with an agency pledging not to lay off workers -- even though it had just axed 83 of them . On the MTA ' s side , the agency -- which had faced an operating shortfall of $ 175 million -- has come under increasing pressure to balance its books . Toward that end , the drumbeat for subcontracting -- or hiring private companies for work previously performed in-house -- became louder and louder . Hoping to resolve their differences , both sides agreed to set_up a joint union-management committee that will review all controversial subcontracts . When the union wants to keep a contract in-house , it must show that its members can do the work for the same or better price than a private-sector competitor . In the cases of a dispute , the committee will step_in . The resolution to the transit strike was not about hourly wages . Yet it caused financial ripples throughout Los Angeles as a significant slice of the county ' s work_force found it nearly impossible to show_up for work_on time . Jack Kyser , chief economist with the county ' s Economic Development Corp. , estimated that the strike cost the local economy $ 2 million a day -- or a total of $ 18 million for the nine-day walkout . In addition to riders , the restaurant and hotel industry -- as well as merchants who depend_on transit-dependent customers -- suffered disruptions and business losses . &quot; Look_at the demographics of people who ride the bus . They are . . . working in industries where if they miss a day , it won ' t be made_up to them , &quot; Kyser said . &quot; There were so many different constituencies affected. &quot; * ECONOMIC TOLL : Area firms begin to recover from strike-related losses .
