   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON ISRAEL-PLO ACCORD ; A VICTORY FOR MUTUAL SELF-INTEREST ; ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS SHED YEARS OF ILLUSIONS IN COMING TO TERMS ON A SETTLEMENT ADVANCING THE MIDEAST PEACE PROCESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Israeli-Palestinian agreement to be signed today in Cairo means that the Mideast peace process is going_to be implemented despite all attempts to derail it . It is a victory not for virtue or conscience but for reciprocal self-interest . It has become possible because the Palestinian and Israeli leaderships have awakened from illusions . The mainstream Palestinians , after years of trial_and_error , must know that their prospect of freedom is contingent_on Israeli security . This perception owes much to American policy which , under the Bush and Clinton_administrations , has made Israel strong enough to accept courses not politically feasible before . Most Israelis now understand that the greatest of all fallacies is the idea that one nation can rule another without consent . What the_British could not do any longer in India or the_French in Algeria or the Dutch in Indonesia or the Belgians in Congo or Rwanda or the Soviets in Afghanistan or the Americans in Vietnam or the South_African whites in South_Africa has also become impossible for Israel , despite ancient Jewish memories and pieties . Israel is not a colonial newcomer to the land of its national birth , but it is undoubtedly alien to the people whom it holds under rigorous military rule . The peace process gives Israel a chance to redeem its own democratic identity . It is not in the nature of democracies to rule over 1.8 million members of a different nation without offering them either equal justice as citizens or a chance to establish their own separate jurisdiction . After 27 years of military rule , the West_Bank and Gaza are among the most chaotic , explosive and socially incoherent areas in the world . Ethnic identity is the pervasive criterion for the application of flagrantly unequal enactments . It was largely in_order to liberate Israel from this incongruous condition that the new Israeli government received a mandate in 1992 to establish a Palestinian self-governing authority as the first cautious stage toward equality of rights and coexistence . In the policies that he now espouses , Yitzhak Rabin is not leaping into a new uncharted field . He is returning to the essential truths that launched Israel on its breakthrough to statehood under David Ben Gurion ' s leadership . The partition principle , without which Israel could not have emerged in 1948 as a recognized sovereign state , reasserts itself now as the only viable formula . It is as true in 1994 as it was in 1948 that the Israeli and Palestinian nations can find their harmony only by living side_by_side in separate areas of jurisdiction with integrated economies and mutual accessibility for their populations . Palestinians will have to pay_for prolonged rejectionism by gaining less than they could have obtained years ago . Israelis of the radical right will have to renounce the dream of establishing a colonial regime in the post-colonial age . The Cairo accords will be irreversible . Despite their boasts and threats , Rabin ' s opponents will not lead Israeli occupation forces_back to Gaza and the West_Bank to re-create the kind of repressive and discriminatory regime that will by then be obsolete even in South_Africa . No government has a watertight formula against individual violence , but the peace process has greatly transformed Israel ' s overall economic , security and diplomatic situations . The number of states maintaining or seeking relations with Israel has jumped from 40 to 120 . Israeli isolation is a thing of the past . At the same time , the Gulf War , the collapse of the Soviet Empire and the arms sales authorized by the Bush and Clinton_administrations have assured Israel of an unprecedented predominance in the strategic balance . Treaties already formulated with Jordan , and likely to be concluded with other negotiating partners , open spacious horizons for economic_growth similar to that achieved by the newly industrialized nations on the Pacific Rim . Openings in the Arab states of the Gulf area are already beginning to appear . So are possibilities of trade and cooperation with the former Soviet republics , including those that are faithful to Islam . Israel ' s liberation from the burdens of ruling over a foreign nation will enable the Palestinians to advance toward self-government and thereafter to possible evolution to more advanced forms of independence . This must involve a purposeful decision on the PLO ' s part to thwart terrorist assaults . Skeptics should not doubt this possibility before the physical and technical opportunities have even been provided . The fulfillment of the peace process will not immediately bring utopia , but its failure would condemn the region to profound despair of peace . Nobody in the Middle_East or in the world community will try in the foreseeable future to construct a brighter opportunity for a new Middle Eastern era . Much depends_on the willingness of the United States to carry the momentum forward in Damascus and Amman .</TEXT>
