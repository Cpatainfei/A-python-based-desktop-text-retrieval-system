   <HEADLINE> CITRON QUITS AS CRISIS DEEPENS ; FEDERAL REGULATORS PORE OVER FUND RECORDS ; FINANCE : O.C. TREASURER-TAX COLLECTOR RESIGNS POST HE HELD FOR 24 YEARS OVER $ 1.5-BILLION PLUNGE IN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO . OFFICIALS CONTINUE CLOSED-DOOR SESSIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the midst of a worsening financial crisis that has federal regulators poring over records of the county ' s beleaguered $ 18.5-billion investment fund , Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron resigned the position he had held for 24 years , officials announced Monday . Six months after winning a bitter electoral contest that focused_on his risky investment strategies , Citron chose to step_down rather than deal with the $ 1.5-billion loss suffered by the investment pool he managed for the county and more_than 180 other public agencies across the state . &quot; After much thought and soul-searching and with much regret , I have decided for the benefit of the County of Orange to resign my elected office , &quot; Citron , 69 , said in a two-sentence letter of resignation . Although it was given to the county ' s administrative officer Sunday , it was not revealed by county supervisors until Monday . By law , Citron ' s assistants in the treasurer-tax collector ' s office were temporarily named to the top posts in the two departments . Matthew Raabe , 38 , became acting treasurer and Gary Cowan the acting tax_collector . Citron ' s permanent successor is not expected to be named before January , when he was_due to begin a new four-year term . &quot; It ' s a sad day , but Bob resigned in the best interests of the county , &quot; said James Kenan , finance director of the Orange County Transportation Authority , with more_than $ 1 billion the largest single investor in the investment pool Citron managed . &quot; From a financial market standpoint , I think he just wanted stability to return. &quot; Following a two-hour , closed-door meeting of the Board of Supervisors , officials declined to discuss details of their deliberations , saying only that they would hold another closed_session today to resume discussions about the financial crisis . In calling Monday ' s meeting , they cited the possibility of litigation over the losses as their reason for barring the public from the meeting . In other developments that came_to_light Monday : * Officials disclosed that investigators from the Securities and Exchange Commission spent the weekend examining the county ' s portfolio and Citron ' s financial documents . Investigators were looking_to see if the county illegally used borrowed money to pay investors who made withdrawals from the fund , or to meet so-called margin_calls , which require additional cash to make_up for the decreased value of securities the county pledged as collateral in seeking loans . * The city of Irvine broke ranks with the county , and announced that it is withdrawing $ 25 million in retirement_funds from the pool and would sue if the county tried to withhold 20 % to cover eventual losses . Officials said they had decided in October to withdraw the money in January , but news of the portfolio ' s plunge prompted them to change their timetable . * Orange County bond prices dropped about 10 % and few of the county ' s bonds were sold Monday . &quot; The whole Orange County market is off , &quot; said Steve Kelleher , bond trader with Sutro &amp; Co . in San Francisco . &quot; Nobody is buying and nobody is selling . We ' re just waiting because this loss could just be the tip of the iceberg. &quot; * Officials already are worried that the fund debacle could jeopardize some county projects and programs . R.A. ( Burt ) Scott , the head of the county ' s General Services_Agency , said Monday he was concerned that any downgrading of the county ' s bond_rating would affect the county ' s ability to finance a massive $ 94-million law_enforcement communications_system the board was expected to approve this month . * Local school officials worried that they will be the biggest losers in the crisis . Unlike municipalities and special districts , which can invest their surplus funds in many different ways , school districts must keep all_of their funds with the county treasurer . Four local districts that borrowed as much as half their annual budgets and put it into the fund to earn interest are particularly at risk . Although Citron ' s office lured them into the investments with a special guarantee their capital would be protected against any loss , the districts did not receive anything in writing extending the guarantee for this , the second year of the investment . County officials said there never were any such guarantees . * Moody ' s Investors Service announced it has placed Orange County ' s investment pool under review . Standard &amp; Poor ' s , the other major rating agency , has already put the county on a negative credit watch , a step prior to a possible downgrading of the county ' s credit rating . Lower ratings would raise the cost of borrowing for the county ' s government_agencies . With Citron gone , county officials and investors wondered what to do next . Some officials privately expressed fears that only Citron , who was paid $ 104 # 353 a year , truly understood his own financial game_plan , which relied heavily on borrowing money short-term to invest in longer-term bonds , using investors ' funds as collateral . While interest_rates remained low , Citron ' s plan worked extremely well , bringing_in some of the highest yields paid by any governmental investment pool . But this year proved disastrous for Citron as interest_rates soared , undermining the value of the long-term bonds he had used for collateral , as well as those he had bought with borrowed money . Because Citron had leveraged $ 7.8 billion worth of securities belonging_to cities , school districts and other public agencies into a portfolio worth nearly three times that amount , his losses have been magnified . Securities firms that loaned the county money demanded that the county put_up more cash as collateral to guarantee the loans , digging considerably into the fund ' s available reserves , which declined from roughly $ 1.5 billion in August to less than $ 350 million two weeks ago . Those in the investment banking world are nervous about the developments of the past week . Kemper Securities in Chicago published a report Monday that laid_out the problems in Orange County and took particular note of a $ 110-million bond issue sold by the county in September . Buyers could demand that the bonds be redeemed on seven days ' notice , adding_to the county ' s cash crunch . Citron did not come_to Monday ' s meeting , and spent most of the day at his Santa Ana home . Peering through the stained glass bordering his front_door , he told a reporter who rang his doorbell that he had no comment to make . A messenger who said he had been dispatched to Citron ' s home by an unnamed county official brought Citron an envelope in late afternoon , and Citron took it through a crack in the door . The former treasurer , who had held office longer than any other current county official , will draw a pension of $ 89 # 000 a year . Some officials praised Citron and his ability over the years to bring needed extra revenues to governmental entities . &quot; I think the person should be judged on the whole history of his investment strategy , &quot; said Laguna Beach City_Manager Kenneth C . Frank , whose city has invested about $ 7 million in the fund . &quot; We have made almost $ 1.4 million in the last 3 1 / 2 years by investing in the county pool over what we would have made with the state pool -- $ 1.4 million. &quot; But others were less complimentary . Peer Swan , chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District -- which is threatening to withdraw $ 300 million from the pool if it doesn ' t get a voice on a proposed financial advisory_board overseeing the pool ' s operations -- said he was concerned &quot; that Bob has all_the information &quot; and appears to be the only person who &quot; knows what is going_on . . . . &quot; &quot; We must have access to that information , &quot; he said , adding that &quot; it is critical that Bob be_on our side . He had a long history of being good to the county , but there was no option ( other_than his resignation ) . The world changed. &quot; City_councils throughout Orange County will be reviewing the status of their investments in the county pool and deciding how to react . Most city finance officials said they were refraining_from withdrawals that they feared might cause a &quot; run_on the bank &quot; and jeopardize their cities ' investments . They said they could not afford to take the 20 % loss that county officials are projecting . The officials added , however , that they did not intend to continue making deposits into the now-controversial fund . The City of Irvine , however , demanded a large chunk of its investment , announcing Monday that it was withdrawing $ 25 million of the $ 209 million it has invested in the pool . City_Manager Paul O . Brady Jr . said the City_Council will meet Wednesday to consider taking legal_action if the county insists on the 20 % penalty it has said it will impose on withdrawals . There were hints that Irvine ' s reason for announcing a withdrawal now may be political as well as fiscal . One official suggested that the city may use this issue to leverage concessions from the county on other contentious issues , such_as development of a commercial airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station , which the city opposes . County voters approved the project in the November election . Irvine City Councilman Barry J . Hammond stopped short of making an overt threat but listed El Toro as well as the city ' s proposed annexation of the base among the &quot; good , strong deal points that can be discussed &quot; between the city and the county . &quot; There ' s just a lot of things going_on and individuals always have to do what ' s best -- what ' s best for the community first and the county second. &quot; Brady nonetheless sounded relatively supportive of Citron , declining , as he put it , &quot; to get involved in all_the politics &quot; of the current situation . The county treasurer-assessor has &quot; done a good job for us , &quot; Brady said . &quot; Sometimes that gets lost in all_the criticism. &quot; Huntington Beach City Treasurer Dan Watson said the news of Citron ' s resignation left him more concerned than before . &quot; If I thought he had good solutions or potential solutions or ( could ) work his way_out from under this , I ' m not sure he would have offered his resignation. &quot; The city has about $ 43 million invested in the pool . Other city officials declined to pass judgment on Citron . &quot; At least in part ( Citron ) has become a victim of both political statements and the media . . . . &quot; La Habra City_Manager Lee Risner said . Buena Park Chief Financial Officer Greg Beaubien said he was &quot; in favor of the county taking any steps necessary to deal with the situation. &quot; Even so , he said , &quot; it ' s easy to throw stones at people. &quot; Buena Park has $ 18 million of city money and $ 10 million in redevelopment funds in the pool , he said . The Securities and Exchange Commission , meanwhile , sent investigators to Citron ' s offices in Santa Ana to cull documents . There is concern that there could be a run_on the fund , and that the ones who demand money first might get_it , leaving less available for others . &quot; In general , if there ' s a run , the rule is first-come , first-served , without attention to the relative equities of those who may_not make a claim &quot; immediately , said one of the SEC sources . The officials said any of the investors in the fund might file a lawsuit , asking a court to put the fund into receivership . In a receivership , a court-appointed official would be assigned to supervise the fund and make decisions about how money is paid_out and invested . SEC investigators were said to be looking_at whether securities used as collateral for loans made to the fund may have been used improperly . While these securities were supposed to have been set_aside as security for just one borrowing , they may have been used simultaneously , and illegally , to secure other loans . But the sources offered no details . Officials were also seeking to determine whether the fund is being adequately supervised now , and whether any payout of money from the funds would be made equitably among the various municipalities and agencies that are investors . Questions were also raised about possibly improper use of securities to collateralize loans the county sought . Meanwhile , Citron ' s political opponent in this year ' s race , who had repeatedly warned that the portfolio was highly leveraged , was astonished by the resignation . &quot; I didn ' t anticipate he would do_it , &quot; said John M.W. Moorlach , a Costa Mesa certified_public_accountant and financial planner who lost to Citron in the June primary . Moorlach , who wrote county officials Monday offering to sit on any committee that may be formed to oversee the operations of the pool , would not say if he would seek the position himself .

A19 * CITIES ' SITUATION -- All but two cities have money in Orange County ' s investment pool . A23 Key Figure Steps Down After nearly a quarter-century , Robert L . Citron ' s political career as Orange County ' s treasurer-tax collector came_to an end Monday when the Board of Supervisors accepted his resignation . County Assistant Treasurer Matthew Raabe was appointed as treasurer until January , when a permanent successor will be named . Citron resignation : &quot; After much thought and soul-searching and with much regret , I have decided for the benefit of the County of Orange to resign from my elected office of Orange County treasurer / tax_collector . &quot; My resignation will be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of this resignation by the county administrative officer. &quot; CAO ' s acknowledgment : &quot; Regrettably , I acknowledge receipt of your Dec . 4 , 1994 , letter or resignation , effective at 4 p.m. , Dec . 4 , 1994. &quot;</TEXT>
