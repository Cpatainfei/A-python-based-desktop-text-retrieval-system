   <HEADLINE> BIOTECH FIRM COUNTING_ON GOATS TO BUILD ITS PROTEINS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The brave new_world of biotechnological engineering moved to the farm this month -- via a herd of specially bred goats whose owners say will be capable of producing proteins at a tenth of the cost of current methods . Genzyme Transgenics Corp. , which uses specially produced proteins to make prescription_drugs and diagnostic products , said last week that it has taken possession of a 166-acre farm in western Massachusetts . It said the farm will be the first in the United States to be used in the commercial production of biotech drugs . The special &quot; transgenic &quot; goats have been genetically altered with human genes so they can produce human proteins in their milk . The proteins can potentially be developed for future treatments for cystic_fibrosis , multiple_sclerosis , cancers and cardiovascular disorders , the company said . The farm , near the towns of CharltonQ and Spencer , can house as_many as 1 # 000 goats and will initially employ 10 to 12 people . Only about one-third of the goats will be transgenic . The rest will be normal goats placed with the herd for breeding and to confuse would-be thieves . The 30 transgenic goats in the current herd of 200 goats , imported from New Zealand , are insured for $ 1 million each , the company said . The animals , of the_Swiss Alpine and Saanen breeds , weigh about 125 pounds and stand 3 feet at the shoulder . They will produce milk for seven to 10 years . The goats promise a large cost savings over conventional production methods . A Genzyme spokesman said a herd of 125 goats could replace the function of a new 185 # 000-square-foot manufacturing_plant built at a cost of more_than $ 100 million by its parent , Genzyme Corp . The factory in Allston , Mass. , requires large , costly bioreactors and cell culture machinery to produce and purify the recombinant , or genetically engineered , proteins the goats make naturally . Normal goats are turned_into transgenic goats when genetically engineered fragments of DNA are injected into one-cell embryos . The fertilized eggs are reintroduced into the mother to produce a transgenic offspring . Genzyme Transgenics said it already has produced a protein that is likely to be turned_into the first transgenic pharmaceutical to move_into U.S. human clinical trials next year . The protein is human antithrombin III , an anti-coagulant used to treat people with a hereditary deficiency of antithrombin-III . It said it has had a high success rate producing the protein in goat milk .</TEXT>
