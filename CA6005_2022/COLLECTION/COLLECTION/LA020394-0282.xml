   <HEADLINE> MARIJUANA FOUND IN ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATOR ' S HOME ; BURGLARY : ASSEMBLYMAN SAYS SMALL AMOUNT DISCOVERED BY INVESTIGATORS WAS NOT HIS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Assemblyman Jim Costa , author of a &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; anti-crime bill , said Wednesday that police investigating a burglary at his Fresno condominium found a small quantity of marijuana , but that it was not his . The Democratic legislator issued a press announcement reporting that the home was burglarized last Thursday while he was working_on anti-crime legislation in Sacramento . Among other things , thieves took electronic_equipment , cuff links , a keepsake watch , wine and beer , he said . Costa said officers investigating the break-in found the marijuana . &quot; I ' m not sure if it was dropped_by the burglars or if this was a politically motivated act , &quot; he said . Fresno Police Lt . Roger Enmark said that there were no suspects in the burglary and that it was not known who owned the marijuana . He said that &quot; residue and two ends of partially smoked marijuana_cigarettes &quot; were found in a shirt box lid in a bedroom . &quot; We have no way to tell whether the burglars brought it in , it was ( Costa ' s ) or anybody else ' s , &quot; Enmark said . He said the marijuana investigation would not be pursued because of limited police resources and because the fine for possession of such a small amount would only be $ 100 . Costa , who said the break-in was his fourth burglary , received unwanted publicity in 1986 after he and a 19-year-old solicited a police informant for a &quot; threesome &quot; act of prostitution . He pleaded no contest , was fined $ 255 and put_on probation . Costa said the burglary &quot; reminded me once again how painful it is to be a crime victim. &quot; Costa , along with Assemblyman Bill Jones ( R-Fresno ) , is the author of one of several bills that would increase the penalties for repeat felony offenders . The bills , with strong public backing , were approved by the Assembly on Monday and sent to the Senate .</TEXT>
