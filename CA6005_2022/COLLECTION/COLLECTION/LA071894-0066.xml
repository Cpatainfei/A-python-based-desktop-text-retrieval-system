   <TEXT> For Franco Baresi to end_up as one of the players failing Italy in the penalty kick phase is almost as shocking as the failure of Roberto Baggio . Baresi represents all that is good and heroic about Italian soccer.He is the veteran , with more international appearances than any player on the team . He is , at age 34 , the focal_point of Italy ' s defense , the emotional and spiritual_leader . He plays for Italy ' s champion , AC Milan , which won the European title recently over Romario ' s FC Barcelona , 4-0 . Baresi played Sunday , even though he had undergone arthroscopic surgery about three weeks ago . He had played the first World Cup game and part of the second , then was injured and had the operation . In the team biography , the following is said about Baresi : &quot; The first word that comes_to_mind when you talk_about the captain Franco Baresi is reliability. &quot; Also : &quot; ( He ) is seen by many as the finest sweeper in the world , and will go_down in history as one of the best ever to play the game. &quot; So when Baresi stepped_up to act_as Italy ' s leadoff hitter in the penalty-kick lineup , everything pointed to a result other_than an embarrassing shank over the top of the goal . Well after the match , when somebody other_than Coach Arrigo Sacchi had to come_out for Italy and face the press , Baresi was the choice . And when he was asked about his missed penalty kick , he gave a veteran answer . &quot; Penalty kicks are like playing the lottery , &quot; he said . BILL DWYRE</TEXT>
