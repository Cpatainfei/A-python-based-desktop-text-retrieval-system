   <HEADLINE> FREIGHT_TRAIN DERAILS IN SAN BERNARDINO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eighteen cars of a Southern Pacific freight_train derailed Sunday in San Bernardino , leaving rail cars jackknifed and strewn in zigzags along the track , authorities said . No one was injured in the earlymorning derailment that shut_down the main north-south freight rail_line from Palmdale to Southern Pacific ' s huge freight yard in Colton , spilling building_materials next to the rails . The line is not expected to reopen until late this afternoon at the earliest , a railroad spokesman said . The cause of the derailment -- the second in a week on the busy line -- is under investigation . The incident occurred about three miles from the scene of a spectacular derailment on the same track in May , 1989 , when a runaway freight_train barreled off the rails and slammed into seven homes , killing two trainmen and two children . Two weeks later , a 14-inch gasoline pipeline next to the track exploded , igniting a fireball that killed two people , injured 31 , and destroyed or damaged 18 homes . Since the explosion , additional check valves have been installed along the pipeline , San Bernardino Fire_Department Battalion Chief David Parke said . After Sunday ' s derailment , the Fire_Department examined the 14-inch pipeline that parallels the track , transporting gasoline from Colton to the Las Vegas area . Inspectors for Calnev Pipeline Co. , which operates the line , were also checking the high-pressure pipeline , Parke said . The 89-car train , carrying mostly plywood and lumber products , was en route from Eugene , Ore. , to the Colton yard when two flat cars , 10 boxcars , three empty tank_cars and three empty grain cars left the tracks . The first six or seven cars that derailed wound_up in &quot; a pretty neat little accordion &quot; -- some at 90-degree angles to the track -- with the other cars tumbling off the rails in a zigzag pattern behind them , he added . Fire officials said they had no idea what caused the derailment at mid-train , but Parke said the train may have been &quot; dragging a car &quot; to the rail yard , that is , pulling a car that has one set of wheels off the track . The train was traveling less than 30 m.p.h. at the time . Southern Pacific spokesman Mike Furtney said crews clearing the rail_line are taking extra precautions to avoid damaging the pipeline . Last Wednesday , several cars carrying crude_oil from Bakersfield to a Los Angeles refinery derailed a_few miles to the south , where the rail_line crosses beneath Interstate 10 near Colton . Furtney said that derailment resulted in the leak of about 100 gallons of crude_oil .</TEXT>
