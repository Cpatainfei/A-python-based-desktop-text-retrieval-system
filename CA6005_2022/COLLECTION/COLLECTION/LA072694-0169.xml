   <HEADLINE> WORKERS ADJUST IN LEANER , EVOLVING MARKET FOR JOBS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wylen Won has a good job as director of a blood-bank medical laboratory , a career for which he studied hard in a field expected to grow . He supervises a staff of 15 , holds a position that can pay as much as $ 70 # 000 a year , has health_insurance and thoroughly enjoys his work_at HemaCare in Sherman Oaks . Yet Won ' s good_fortune is tempered by caution . The 42-year-old medical technologist recently began selling Amway housecleaning products on the side and keeps a plastic tray of samples on his desk . He figures it will supplement his income for now and offer an alternative if he falls victim to corporate downsizing . &quot; I guess it ' s just not safe these days to put all your eggs into one basket , &quot; said Won , the son of a retired aerospace_engineer and a married father of two . That sort of wariness is common among workers today , even those with the sorts of jobs expected to proliferate into the next century . In the San Fernando Valley , studies show that smaller firms such_as HemaCare are thriving . The healthiest fields include not only the biomedical industry , but entertainment , computer_hardware and software , general industrial machinery , and even aerospace subcontracting . But employees are keenly aware that they are the most vulnerable in a time of leaner operating_budgets and changing markets . Indeed , more low-paying jobs and a small supply of high-paying positions are forecast into the 21st Century . Of the 50 occupations expected to grow the fastest in the next six years , 29 will pay minimum_wage , according to the state Employment Development Department . And economists predict that more employers will rely_on part-time workers and independent contractors . In a series of interviews with Valley workers from both ends of the wage spectrum in a variety of growing business_sectors , younger employees generally seemed happier and more optimistic . That was also true for unskilled immigrants , or the children of working-class immigrants . But for baby_boomers raised in middle- and upper-middle-class American homes , there was an underlying anxiety , and several questioned whether they will ever match their parents ' standard_of_living . &quot; I don ' t buy books anymore , or CDs . I don ' t go_out to eat very much ; I don ' t go_to concerts like I used to , &quot; said Paula Berinstein , a former librarian and computer_programmer who became a self-employed researcher . &quot; Now my money is going_to things like health_care , insurance , taxes , earthquake repairs , keeping_up the house , plumbing , all that kind of stuff , &quot; said the owner of Berinstein Research in Woodland Hills . &quot; And I don ' t travel very much and I don ' t buy a lot of clothes and all that. &quot; Nonetheless , Berinstein , 44 and single , relishes her independence and considers herself lucky to be her own boss . She gave_up secure , corporate jobs to do so , joining a growing legion of home-based consultants . She works mainly from her two-bedroom house , dressing in jeans , setting her own schedule , and telecommuting via phone , fax and e-mail . A couple times a week , she might drive down to her alma_mater , UCLA , and use one of its well-stocked libraries . Once she becomes an instant expert on subjects ranging from political_campaigns to citrus distribution , she ' ll write_up the information for clients including screenwriters , attorneys and businesses . &quot; I find now when I work , I really work , &quot; Berinstein said . &quot; I don ' t fool_around , whereas when I worked for somebody else , I had a whole other perspective on it . Now , I have a reputation to uphold. &quot; She has yet to get rich and supplements her $ 35 # 000 in annual revenues by working part-time for her father ' s investment_firm . She hopes &quot; all this hoopla about the information superhighway will help. &quot; Independent filmmaker Bill Morgan also hopes to capitalize on technology ' s rapidly expanding ways of storing and conveying information . Like Berinstein , Morgan has a liberal arts background but has become increasingly immersed in computers . Now he is throwing himself into the realm of CD-ROMs , the compact_discs that can project images , text and sound through the user ' s stereo and computer , and which have been touted as the future of information and entertainment . For Morgan , they offer a perfect marriage of technology with the art of storytelling . He cited an example from a CD-ROM / laser-disc project called &quot; Columbus : Encounter , Discovery and Beyond , &quot; which recounts Columbus ' arrival in America from several perspectives . A window on Renaissance art draws fine parallels between Da Vinci ' s studies of perspective and the navigation advances that enabled Columbus to cross the Atlantic . &quot; I think it ' s really exciting . It ' s like we really are in a new era , &quot; said Morgan , who clearly seems enthusiastic about what he does . &quot; A lot of people are fearful of the Brave New World . This is actually a very inviting , human technology. &quot; But while his Burbank-based company , Mass Productions , grosses in the &quot; low six figures , &quot; Morgan says overhead eats away at the money he would like to spend on a home . He and his wife , recently married with no children , are renting a house in Pacific Palisades . &quot; Even though I ' m doing_well relative to what I ' ve done_in the past , I would say just in_general , the whole American_dream of buying a house and all that is almost impossible in Los Angeles , &quot; said Morgan , 41 , the son of a highly successful , self-made businessman . &quot; Even though I make fairly good money I still can ' t afford to buy a house in the part of L . A . I want to live in. &quot; Equally enthralled with his work , and not particularly concerned about financial security , is software_engineer Moshe Kirsh , who believes his employer , Perceptronics of Woodland Hills , is_on the cutting edge of its field . The defense_contractor specializes in virtual reality-style simulations that have been used for weapons training and military exercises , or war_games . Now it is planning to convert its technology to commercial uses and one of Kirsh ' s missions is to create a simulation framework applicable in a variety of situations . &quot; You can simulate any decision , &quot; said Kirsh , 34 . &quot; Like with medical decisions , you can simulate a surgery in_advance , &quot; to see how it might turn_out without jeopardizing a patient . He is among a six software_engineers -- the brains behind computer_programs -- at his company , was culled from hundreds of applicants , and earns between $ 60 # 000 and $ 70 # 000 a year plus benefits . He , his software-designer wife , and their two young children live_in Encino in a house they own . Kirsh , a native of Israel and a veteran of the 1982 invasion of Lebanon , exudes confidence . &quot; I think it ' s a reflection of my optimism about Perceptronics and companies like it . I think we ' re in the right direction , &quot; said Kirsh , who joined the firm a year ago . For now , he is working_on a way to expand existing simulations ' networking capabilities -- such_as enabling thousands of soldiers in different locations to participate in a simulated battle instead of 200 , the current capacity . His is a highly abstract world involving line after line of Roman_numerals and Greek symbols , of knowing where he wants to go_with his scribbles and then unraveling the mathematical obstacles along the way . Ideas often come_to him as he commutes home and , unable to wait until morning , he ' ll log onto his PC and bounce them off similarly driven colleagues . &quot; We don ' t want to wait until the next day or even Monday to find_out if it works , &quot; Kirsh said . Far less absorbing but not unpleasant is the job of Hoang Vuong , who works for the Chatsworth-based Zinnanti Surgical , a maker of gynecological and obstetrical instruments . Vuong , 22 , is paid roughly $ 7 an hour to assemble cervical dilators and endometrial tissue-samplers that are disposable . Sitting on a crate in Zinnanti ' s cavernous warehouse and assembly room , he prints numbers on the instruments ' needle-like , plastic tubes , drills the holes needed to connect the various parts , then packages them . Though the job is dull , the atmosphere is relaxed , and while he works Vuong can chat with co-workers -- virtually all_of them Southeast Asian or Central_American immigrants in their 20s . For Vuong , a native of Vietnam who grew_up in Hawaii , it ' s a way to save money for Pierce College , where he hopes to enroll next year after he officially gains his California residency . He wants to study radiology technology . Vuong meets his expenses by sharing a rented Reseda house with four other Vietnamese immigrants -- his aunt , his friend , his friend ' s father , and another man . Four of the five house mates work_at Zinnanti , so they all car-pool together in Vuong ' s aunt ' s car . He gives her $ 250 each month for room and board and still has money left over for coffeehouses and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies , his favorite pastimes . Coming_to the mainland United States from Hawaii was a youthful adventure as much as anything else . &quot; If you ' re Vietnamese and living_in Hawaii ' s Vietnamese community , you know everybody , &quot; Vuong said . Dene Mathews says she is also content , despite the fact that she holds a degree in electrical_engineering but is working primarily as a customer-service representative . Unable to find an engineering job after she graduated two years ago from Howard University in Washington , D . C. , Mathews settled for a foot in the door at Voice Powered Technology . The small , consumer-electronics firm in Canoga Park is known for voice-activated VCR programmers and a gadget called the Organizer , a pocket-sized , voice-programmed alarm that reminds users of personal tasks . She is an administrative assistant and also handles what are euphemistically called &quot; customer inquiries. &quot; Blunter colleagues say that means fielding calls from irate customers who can ' t figure_out how to make their VCR programmers and Organizers work , even though they are designed for easy operation . Still , it ' s her first job out of college and Mathews , 25 and newly wed to an aspiring minister , focuses_on the positive . And she is not the most overqualified of her co-workers , who include a 60-year-old , unemployed aerospace_engineer . &quot; I ' m getting good experience dealing with customers , &quot; she said , briefly removing her headphones to talk . &quot; It ' s challenging accommodating difficult personalities , whether it ' s in shipping-and-billing or about the device itself. &quot; She makes between $ 18 # 000 and $ 20 # 000 a year plus benefits at the full-time position , commuting from her Hollywood apartment each day in the Volkswagen Bug she has owned since she learned to drive . Nonetheless , she said she has enjoyed more opportunities than her parents , two government workers , and is satisfied for now . &quot; I feel we ' re doing very well , &quot; she said of herself and her husband . Across the room of upholstered gray work stations sits the department ' s oldest customer-service rep , George Lee , an unemployed aerospace_engineer . Lee , 60 , used to make $ 100 # 000 a year as a consultant who specialized in making_sure that rocket components worked . He has failed to find comparable work since his contracts dried_up two years ago amid defense budget_cuts . So he became a customer-service rep at Voice Powered Technology , accepting a salary similar to Mathews ' because of the medical benefits . &quot; Until I ' m 62 I can ' t draw Social_Security , so I need the income , &quot; he said . &quot; But my biggest problem is not only no income but a lack of health_insurance . I couldn ' t afford the $ 8 # 000 a year it takes. &quot; Now he commutes from La Crescenta instead of working from his office at_home . Many of the frustrated customers he helps haven ' t bothered to skim the users ' guide or even watch an instructional videotape included for those unwilling to read . &quot; Their attitude is , ' We bought the product so we won ' t have to , ' &quot; Lee said . &quot; This is people work more_than anything else , &quot; he added . &quot; But you need a good technical understanding of what happens so you can respond. &quot; If Mathews and Lee have temporarily set_aside technical training to deal with the public , then the nurses at HemaCare have gone the opposite route -- leaving_behind the grueling job of healing the sick for the task of extracting blood_platelets from healthy donors . &quot; Sometimes we kid our colleagues , ' Just remember not only the worst days at the hospital , but the best ones , ' &quot; said Mari Kurzhals , who screens the paid donors , hooks them up_to computerized platelet-harvesters , and periodically checks for negative reactions . Like Kurzhals , a former critical-care RN , between one-third and one-half of the blood_bank ' s medical staff works part-time and receives no benefits . For now , that arrangement suits Kurzhals , 38 , who has a 3-year-old son whom she and her husband , a police_detective , prefer not to leave with a sitter . She works one or two nights a week for $ 23 an hour , more to keep her hand in her profession than for the money . Sometimes she misses the satisfaction of comforting a patient but said she nonetheless enjoys friendly , even personal , conversations with HemaCare regulars , whose photos are posted on a bulletin_board . &quot; I love it , &quot; she said . &quot; Maybe part of it is that I don ' t have to do it. &quot; The Lineup Today Future_Tense : A report from the front_lines on the new workplace , where entrepreneurs , computer_experts and others talk_about how they feel about having 21st-Century jobs in the 20th Century .
