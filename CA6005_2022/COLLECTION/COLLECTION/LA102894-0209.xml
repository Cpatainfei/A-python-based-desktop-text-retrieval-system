   <HEADLINE> DESPITE BOYCOTT ORDER , 50 % TURN_OUT ON 1ST DAY OF MOZAMBIQUE ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About half of Mozambique ' s 6.4-million electorate voted_in the country ' s first free ballot Thursday , despite confusion from a last-minute boycott order by the main , ex-rebel opposition , electoral officials said . Many voters had either not heard of the boycott decreed by Mozambique National Resistance ( Renamo ) leader Afonso Dhlakama or went_ahead and voted as a form of insurance in case the former rebel chief changed his mind . Dhlakama was under intense pressure to do so , despite his claim that the result from the ballot_box would be fraudulent . The United States , the European Union and neighboring countries including South_Africa urged him to take_part in Mozambique ' s first democratic elections , which are for Parliament and the presidency . Manuel Frank , a spokesman for the independent National Electoral Commission , told a news_conference that there were no reports of intimidation despite the boycott call . &quot; We do not have exact statistics at this point . But our observation was that at least 50 % of the electorate voted , which is a sign that voting is going normally , &quot; he said . About 6 # 000 monitors observed the voting , which is_due to continue today . Frank said it did not appear necessary to extend balloting for an optional third day . Some diplomats said Dhlakama may have called the boycott in a bid to strengthen his bargaining position with the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front ( Frelimo ) and its leader , President Joaquim Chissano , expected to win the parliamentary and presidential polls .</TEXT>
