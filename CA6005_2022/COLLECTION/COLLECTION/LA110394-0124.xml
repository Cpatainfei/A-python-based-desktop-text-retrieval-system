   <HEADLINE> COMPROMISE APPROVED FOR MUSEUM IN FORMER CITY_HALL ; THOUSAND OAKS : IF DISCOVERY CENTER FINANCES SITE ' S RENOVATION , IT COULD EARN THE RIGHT TO RENT-FREE USE . BUT THE COUNCIL ISN ' T MAKING ANY PROMISES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No exhibits have opened , no labs have materialized , but the proposed Ventura County Discovery Center has already taught residents a key lesson in science -- political_science . Before an enthusiastic audience of children and adults , Thousand Oaks council_members forged a compromise that gives the proposed museum a shot at leasing the former City_Hall , but retains the city ' s flexibility to consider better offers . Council_members on Tuesday unanimously voiced support for the concept of a center in the sleek gray building tucked into a slope at 401 W . Hillcrest Drive . And they encouraged museum supporters to begin raising money to repair the abandoned City_Hall , which sits shabby and neglected . But they warned that they cannot simply give_away a valuable asset to a nonprofit group , however worthy the cause . &quot; The Discovery Center is a wonderful concept , but it ' s not a proven entity , &quot; Councilwoman Judy Lazar said . &quot; They ' ve got_to come_up with the money. &quot; Thus , the compromise : If Discovery Center backers amass $ 600 # 000 to renovate the former City_Hall , the council will consider letting them use the facility , rent free , for five years . If , however , a richer tenant bids to lease the building , the council may accept that offer . &quot; We would have liked to see more commitment from the city , but we ' re still very pleased , &quot; said Hope Colt-Mette , who serves as vice_president of the museum group ' s board of directors . &quot; There ' s a terrific possibility that we can do it. &quot; * Council_members have long counted_on raising $ 13 million from the sale or lease of the old City_Hall to pay_off debts from the Civic Arts Plaza project . Even if the Discovery Center cannot afford to pay market-rate leases , however , the city could still reap revenue from the Hillcrest Drive site by subdividing the property and auctioning part of it off to developers . Architect Gary Heathcote , who studied the parcel on a citizens committee earlier this year , suggested that the city could approve a restaurant or even condominiums along the property ' s fringes . Such development might be compatible with a museum -- allowing council_members to give the Discovery Center a break without breaking the city ' s budget , he said in an interview . &quot; That concept is extremely viable and it lets the city off_the_hook , &quot; Heathcote said . Wearing an orange pin in support of the Discovery Center , Heathcote added : &quot; This is such a great idea . As a museum site , it ' s fabulous. &quot; Equally excited , more_than 100 Discovery Center backers streamed out of the council meeting Tuesday night eager to start reeling in funding commitments . &quot; Now we have the hard work to do , &quot; said Gary Elliot , an associate scientist at the biotechnology firm Amgen Inc. * Museum supporters said they have lined_up tentative commitments from several major corporations , and will pursue federal grants . They aim to fill about 50 # 000 square_feet with hands-on displays , technology labs , and exhibits exploring the link between science and the arts . They also hope to develop a nature curriculum that would teach visitors about the outdoors through overnight camp-outs and day hikes . Their plans have won support from a diverse group , including teachers , scientists , artists , lawyers and even a virtual_reality expert . &quot; In today ' s society , everybody really sees the need for science_museums , &quot; Elliott said . &quot; It ' s in the news every day , from the O.J. Simpson trial to computers to the Internet . A center like this would be a great resource for teachers , a showplace for technology and a fun learning experience for kids. &quot;</TEXT>
