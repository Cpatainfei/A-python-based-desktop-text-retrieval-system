   <TEXT> Ukraine ' s Parliament opens debate today on the nuclear disarmament agreement that President Leonid Kravchuk signed earlier this month with Russia and the United States . Kravchuk insists that the agreement -- which would rid Ukraine of all nuclear_weapons within seven years in exchange for secure borders , nuclear_reactor fuel and more_than $ 1 billion in U.S. aid -- does not require Parliament ' s ratification.But he is lobbying to avoid an outright rejection that would make_it politically hard to fulfill . Initial reaction among lawmakers was hostile to the pact . But they decided to have four legislative committees examine it and report to Parliament . A vote is expected by Friday . ( An item published in this column last week incorrectly stated that the debate would began earlier. )</TEXT>
