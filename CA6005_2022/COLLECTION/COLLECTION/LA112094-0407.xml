   <HEADLINE> COMPLEX FAMILY TIES TANGLE SIMPLE PREMISE OF PROP . 187 ; IMMIGRANTS : IMPACT INCLUDES PROBLEMS OF SPLITTING UP PARENTS , CHILDREN AND SPOUSES OF MIXED LEGAL STATUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For sponsors of Proposition 187 , the issue is simple : Illegal immigrants , by definition lawbreakers , should be denied public_services and promptly turned_in to authorities . Those who do not volunteer to leave should be swiftly deported . &quot; Illegal aliens have no right to be here , &quot; said Ron Prince , chairman of the Proposition 187 campaign . But for Dora Figueroa and many of the other estimated 1.7 million unlawful immigrants in California , the situation is much more complicated . Most undocumented people are closely related to U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents , often wives , husbands , parents , siblings or children . Many are in the process of seeking papers , usually via spouses or other relatives who are legal residents entitled to petition for loved ones under the principle of family reunification , long a cornerstone of U.S. immigration policy . Mass deportation would inevitably mean the splitting of hundreds of thousands of families , including many whose members are_on official waiting lists for green_cards . Immigration today is very much a family affair , assisted and encouraged by networks of relatives well-established in the United States . In the case of Figueroa , she is the wife of a lawful permanent resident and the mother of a 2-year-old boy , Michael Scott , a U.S. citizen . She is 8 months pregnant with another child . &quot; My life is here now , &quot; said Figueroa , who slipped across the U.S.-Mexico border four years ago , completing what has become a rite of passage for millions of extended families , an exodus that redefined California ' s demographics -- and has triggered an angry backlash among the voting majority . &quot; What scares people most is the idea of being separated from their families , from their children. &quot; Whatever Proposition 187 ' s fate in the courts , the essentially familial nature of immigration -- combined with the limited capabilities of an overtaxed immigration bureaucracy -- weigh against any large-scale repatriations , such_as the mass return of Mexican nationals during the anti-immigrant campaigns of the 1930s and 1950s . &quot; How can I leave ? My children are American , &quot; said Tammy ( she asked that her surname not be used ) . Tammy , her husband , Haim , and three young children arrived from Israel seven years ago and opted to overstay their visitors ' visas , never going_back . Those who overstay their visas , who make_up at least half of the illegal immigrants nationwide , face the same problem as those who jump the border . The families of undocumented Europeans , Canadians , Asians and others who violated their entry visas include many U.S.-born children or relatives awaiting legal_status via relatives or through other applications . &quot; My little_girls would n ' t know what the Philippines is like , &quot; said one undocumented Los Angeles mother of six children , of whom only the two youngest are U.S. citizens . Neither of the two speaks Tagalog , the language of their ancestral homeland . If the courts uphold Proposition 187 , she and others could be turned_in as suspected illegal immigrants by educators at their children ' s schools , by health workers and social_service providers , and by police_officers who may stop them for a traffic violation . Yet the woman , like most illegal immigrants interviewed , said she had no intention of returning to her homeland voluntarily -- the &quot; self-deportation &quot; process that Proposition 187 advocates hope will unfold . In the event she is reported to the Immigration and Naturalization Service , arrested and forced to return , Dora Figueroa , for one , vows to be back quickly . &quot; I ' ll go_down and bring her back myself , &quot; said her husband , Daniel Gomez , as he and his wife relaxed on a recent evening in their apartment on Los Angeles ' Eastside , one of the nation ' s most populous new-immigrant enclaves . In the last 15 years or so , scholars say , immigration from Mexico and Central_America -- by far the principal homelands of California ' s undocumented multitudes -- has become more of a deeply rooted , family-driven phenomenon . Long gone is the era when most were migrant men following the harvests and returning annually to their families in Mexico . &quot; When I first came here , I thought I would work for a while , save some money , and then go_back to Mexico , &quot; Gomez said . &quot; But as time goes_on , that is more and more of an illusion. &quot; A onetime illegal immigrant , Gomez obtained U.S. residency via the amnesty program of 1987-88 , a sweeping law that conferred legal_status on 3 million formerly undocumented residents , almost three-quarters of them Mexican nationals . It was the world ' s largest immigration amnesty , and its consequences were far-reaching , particularly for California , home of more_than half of all amnesty beneficiaries . Soon , Gomez and other newly legalized residents began sending_for others , beckoning them to the land_of_opportunity . The U.S.-Mexico border proved to be a porous barrier . A great unintended consequence of the amnesty program , experts agree , was to open the gates to a new influx of unlawful immigration by loved ones and acquaintances . Ironically , presiding over the amnesty process were two Californians -- Alan C . Nelson , former national commissioner of the INS , and Harold W . Ezell , ex-INS western chief -- who were later among the authors of Proposition 187 . Three of Gomez ' s brothers eventually came north , successfully making the dash across the border , as did his future wife , Dora Figueroa , whom he had known since boyhood in their hometown of Colima , Mexico . More often than not , according to immigrants and scholars , established relatives such_as Gomez served as the newcomers ' anchors and social safety nets , providing friends and family with a place to stay , a hot meal , someone to talk to and , as often as not , a crucial job contact . Gomez said he has never sought public benefits , though the family might qualify for welfare or food_stamps for their U.S. citizen child , considering the father ' s average weekly income of $ 250 to $ 300 as a construction worker . Unaccustomed to such government largess in his native Mexico , Gomez said he would rather not apply and draw official attention upon his family . Despite a widespread perception to the contrary , various studies -- including an extensive 1992 INS report on amnesty recipients -- concluded that illegal immigrants have been comparatively small users of health and social_services . In fact , illegal immigrants are excluded by statute from most big-ticket entitlement programs , such_as food_stamps , welfare and unemployment insurance . One service widely used is prenatal care provided under the state-funded Medi-Cal program . Proposition 187 bans such aid to illegal immigrants . Gov . Pete Wilson has acted to cut_off prenatal assistance , although that directive is_on hold because of a temporary restraining order issued after the election against all major provisions of the initiative . Cutting pregnancy aid would surely make life more difficult for many illegal immigrants -- &quot; I don ' t know where I ' d go_for my checkups , &quot; said Figueroa , a Medi-Cal recipient -- but it would also affect a future generation of U.S. citizens . Undocumented mothers will continue to give_birth at California hospitals and clinics -- delivery is an emergency service , still to be available even if Proposition 187 passes legal muster . And if complications arise after birth because of an absence of prenatal care , these newborn citizens will be eligible for the full range of public benefits . Another principal provision of Proposition 187 -- prohibiting illegal immigrants from attending public_schools and colleges -- also tugs at family bonds . Take the case of the Ericka Tejeda and her six children , all residents of Los Angeles ' Westlake district , a run-down barrio west of Downtown that is home to many Central_Americans who fled the warfare and grinding poverty of their homelands . Tejeda , a 30-year-old native of Guatemala_City , braved the border crossing on a rainy winter evening a decade ago while cradling her then-infant daughter , Claudia , now 12 . Mother and daughter remain without papers , but Claudia ' s younger siblings -- Jose , 10 , Ericka , 8 , Olemi , 7 , Deborah , 5 , and Andrea , 4 -- were all born in Los Angeles and are U.S. citizens . Under Proposition 187 , Claudia would have to leave public_school while her siblings could remain in the classroom . The school district would be required to report Claudia and her mother to the INS . &quot; I like school , &quot; said Claudia , a sixth-grader , the other day in the family ' s two-bedroom apartment , decorated with photographs of Claudia and her classmates and woven tapestries of sylvan scenes -- an oxcart carrying wood , women washing clothing in a rushing stream against a backdrop of majestic volcanoes -- depicting a native_land that the girl does not remember . Asked what she would like to be when she is older , Claudia replied : &quot; A lawyer . I ' d like to help Latinos. &quot; As U.S. citizens , Claudia ' s five brothers and sisters qualify the family for a range of public_services , including federal welfare payments of $ 824 a month and food_stamps totaling $ 290 monthly , according to the mother . The family ' s eligibility would not change under Proposition 187 , though Ericka Tejeda would risk being reported to the INS by going_to the county social_service office . Proposition 187 proponents argue that the availability of such benefits lures unlawful immigrants . But Tejeda said she was unaware of such programs until she arrived . The Tejeda family also receives a federal rent subsidy , something that advocates have waged a lengthy legal battle to preserve for the many families , such_as the Tejedas , who include legal and undocumented members . &quot; It is a misnomer to think_of an undocumented population that can be easily identified and removed , &quot; said Charles Wheeler , directing attorney of the Los Angeles-based National Immigration Law Center , which has filed one of eight lawsuits challenging Proposition 187 . &quot; These people , by and large , have been here for several years and established family connections. &quot; Carlos Bolanos has been in the United States since 1983 , when he fled his rural coastal homeland in El_Salvador ' s war-ravaged Sonsonate province and made the odyssey through Central_America to Tijuana , where he jumped the border en route to the home of relatives in Los Angeles . Today , part owner ( along with an in-law ) of a home_in the San Fernando Valley , Bolanos remains undocumented , as do his three eldest children -- though his wife , Teolinda Alvarado , has temporary legal_status and his 10-month-old daughter , Gabriela , was born in the United States . &quot; It would be very difficult for us to return now to El_Salvador , &quot; Bolanos said recently . Once a campesino , Bolanos has been making a living rebuilding alternators and other automotive parts at a San Fernando Valley shop for $ 5.80 an hour . He long ago sold his ancestral plot of land back home , he said , in_order to help raise money for a house down_payment here . He has never received public assistance , he says , and has always paid his taxes , just as he regularly sent a chunk of his paycheck back home each month to his family . His eldest three children -- Oscar Arturo , 16 , Elsa , 14 , and Marvin , 10 -- arrived in the United States in May , finally uniting a family that had been divided for more_than a decade . Now , with Proposition 187 on the books and a growing hostility toward illegal immigrants , Bolanos dreads the prospect of a family forced to split anew . &quot; It would be a great blow if my ( eldest ) could not go_to school , &quot; he said . &quot; Our idea is that we would all have a life together , and my children would have better opportunities in this country . Now they say we have to go_back . Go_back to what ? &quot;</TEXT>
