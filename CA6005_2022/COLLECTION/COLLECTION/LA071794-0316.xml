   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA 1994 ; COMMENTARY ; NOT MUCH CONSOLATION IN THIRD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Unleashing the offensive firepower they save for special occasions such_as this , Sweden routed Bulgaria , 4-0 , Saturday in the biggest explosion of goals in a World Cup third-place game since . . . . Well , let ' s see . The World Encyclopedia of Soccer doesn ' t list final scores from World Cup third-place games . Neither does this massive manual on World Cup soccer entitled , well , &quot; World Cup Soccer. &quot; Semifinal scores , yes . Championship final scores , of course . Third-place scores ? Hey , serious soccer historians can ' t be bothered with such minutiae . Besides , the book deal called_for 430 pages and not one page more . It was tough enough squeezing in the stuff about Zagalo , Zico and Dino Zoff . Third-place games are the Michael Bolton music videos of the World Cup . Seen today , forgotten tomorrow . Millions of people claim to have had midfield-line seats for the 1986 World Cup_final between Argentina and West Germany , but no one admits to being anywhere near the third-place game . Exhaustive research shows that France and Belgium played in that one . Played overtime , even -- the ultimate in windmill tilting . After 120 minutes of purely scintillating soccer -- or absolutely dreadful soccer ; no one seems to know for_sure -- France won , 4-2 . Parisians still rave about the wine-addled ticker-tape parade down the Champs Elysees . Italy played in the 1990 third-place game . In Italy , the Italians won , 2-1 , over England , and were hooted and jeered off the field . For a sport so thoroughly obsessed with first place or nothing -- just ask Carlos Alberto Parreira , Brazil ' s beleaguered coach -- a match to decide who finishes third and who finishes fourth seems outlandishly frivolous . Unless , of course , you happen to work for international soccer ' s governing body , FIFA . FIFA turned the stiles nearly 84 # 000 more times for Saturday ' s Sweden-Bulgaria game . That buys a lot of bronze medals . So many , in fact , that both winners and losers received them . Same medal , same metal . And they received them before the first ball was kicked . &quot; The players were given their medals before the game , &quot; said Bulgaria Coach Dimitar Penev , who counts himself among the third-place game resistance movement . &quot; Because of this , this is how they play . Four goals in 15 minutes. &quot; Bulgaria had yielded four goals in its last 480 World Cup minutes . But then , the World Cup was still the dream of every Bulgarian during every one of those minutes . Saturday , the point couldn ' t be more moot . &quot; I think this game is not proper , &quot; Penev said . &quot; It should not be . There are too many games to play in too short a time . There ' s too_much stress. &quot; Even Thomas Ravelli , the Swedish goalkeeper who called placing third in the World Cup &quot; the greatest moment in my football career , &quot; paused to think when asked if the third-place game ought to be abolished . &quot; It ' s hard to say , &quot; Ravelli replied . &quot; I mean , I think the Bulgarian team had a much harder match against Italy than our match with Brazil . And they had to play in New York , so they had jet_lag and one less day to rest . &quot; It was very hard for them to play today . Bulgaria was not prepared_for this game. &quot; And now , the Bulgarians face the prospect of a 9 # 500-mile flight home . that ' s 3 # 000 more_than it would have been had they left from New York in the first place , instead of from LAX in fourth place . On the other hand , the Bulgarians were able to put_off the trip back to Bulgaria for three more days , so maybe the third-place game in the World Cup is a wonderful concept that ought to be chiseled in marble . Poolside room service , Hristo . What a country . They packaged the third-place game with the final , put them both inside the Rose Bowl and billed them as equal halves of the &quot; Soccerfest &quot; weekend extravaganza . Was anybody buying it ? Well , Swedish striker Kennet Andersson , third-place medalist , was lobbying hard to press onward . &quot; Sure , &quot; he said . &quot; Now we know that Sweden is third in the world and Bulgaria is fourth . We need this game to show we are better than Bulgaria. &quot; Good to have that taken_care of .</TEXT>
