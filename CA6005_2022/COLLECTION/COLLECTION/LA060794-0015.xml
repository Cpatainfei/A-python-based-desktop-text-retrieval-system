   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON CHINA ; A GOOD DECISION ; NOW THE HARD PART ; NOW THAT MFN IS SET , WE NEED TO WORK WITH BEIJING ON VITAL STRATEGIC , ECONOMIC AND HUMAN-RIGHTS ISSUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Our recent , extensive conversations with Chinese leaders convince us that President Clinton ' s wise decision to continue most-favored-nation trading status for China while pressing for improvements in Beijing ' s human-rights record through other channels creates the opportunity to broaden and deepen Sino-American relations . Follow-through is essential , however , if the opportunity is to be realized . By itself , the decision will neither ameliorate human-rights violations by Chinese authorities nor elicit cooperation in the strategic or economic spheres . China ' s leaders , like many Asian leaders , doubt American resolve in the region . Some Chinese leaders suspect that the ultimate American objective is to destabilize and divide China ; hence , as they see it , the Administration ' s emphasis on human_rights and Tibet . To elicit Chinese cooperation on matters of serious concern to us in the strategic , economic and human-rights area requires five measures . * The United States must undertake intensified , broadly focused and regular dialogue with China ' s leaders . In the 1970s and early 1980s , the strategic dialogue between Washington and Beijing enabled both sides to approach transitory issues from a shared conceptual framework concerning the dangers of Soviet expansionism . That essential facet of Sino-American relations has disappeared . It must be restored . Such dialogue , for example , is essential to elicit Chinese cooperation in dissuading North_Korea from developing nuclear_weapons . There is another reason for expanding consultations , especially between the Department_of_Defense and the Chinese military , a powerful actor in domestic affairs . Beijing is in an era of succession politics , and high-level contacts will yield information and influence at a decisive stage in China ' s evolution . The strategic basis of Sino-American relations in the post-Cold War era is to be found in the intense interest of both Washington and Beijing in global and regional stability . Both China and the United States have crucial roles to play in the maintenance of stability in Korea . Both have important roles to play to ensure that all countries of the former Soviet_Union emerge as truly independent and stable countries , and that the natural_resources of Siberia and the Russian Far East be developed effectively and peacefully . Both have an interest in deterring an arms race in Asia and in maintaining the prosperity and stability of Taiwan and Hong Kong . * The United States must now vigorously address such economic issues as protection of intellectual property_rights in China and access to the service sector . While China has generally welcomed foreign direct investment , for example , it has protected its banks and insurance_companies from foreign competition . It is reluctant to privatize its communication industries . Foreign involvement in these sectors would accrue not only to the outside world ' s benefit ; it would also accelerate the modernization of sectors crucial to China ' s entire development . * The United States and China should accelerate the negotiations over China ' s entry into the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade under terms that commit China to a firm , phased-in program to achieve full GATT standards . This is the path taken_for Mexico ' s entry into GATT . It is in everyone ' s interest -- including China ' s -- that it follow the same , rigorous procedures . * The United States should vigorously expand cooperation with China in the areas of scholarly exchange , environmental issues , protection of endangered species , narcotics control , public health and population migration . Problems of the 21st Century will not be solved without China ' s active participation . * The President must persist_in the human-rights area . But a confrontational approach will not work . Rather , the Administration must approach China with respect for its intellectual traditions and accomplishments . While continuing to press for release of specific individuals , the United States -- and especially the private sector -- should join hands with those Chinese who wish to develop their legal_system , strengthen their parliaments , establish a police system under the rule_of_law , foster an independent judiciary and train professional journalists . In the long_run , development of formal and transparent political institutions is the best way to enhance basic human_rights in China . Let there be no illusions . Sino-American relations remain fragile , and future political development is uncertain . China ' s emergence onto the world scene involves a protracted and painful process . President Clinton has now set_on a proper path . But patience , firmness and persistence will be needed if this increasingly significant relationship is to achieve its potential .</TEXT>
