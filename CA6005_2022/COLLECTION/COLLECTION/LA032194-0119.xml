   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : SPECIAL BUS_SERVICE FOR DISABLED TO START</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> South Coast Area Transit will begin complementary curb-to-curb service for disabled Ventura County residents starting this summer , the Ventura County Transportation Commission has announced . In cooperation with SCAT , the commission is certifying individuals who need the service , which is similar to a dial-a-ride or taxi service . The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that fixed-route bus systems such_as SCAT be accessible to disabled people . The fare for the new service will not exceed $ 2 one way , which is twice the amount of an adult bus_fare , commission officials said . SCAT is planning to begin its curb-to-curb service in July , but eligible individuals must become certified as soon as possible so that the bus system can tailor its services to their needs , commission officials said . To be eligible , individuals must be unable to use a fixed-route bus because they are either physically or mentally unable to board , ride or disembark an accessible bus , or their disability prevents them from traveling_to or from a bus_stop . Individuals must fill_out an application , describe their disability and attend a brief interview to be certified for the service . Once they are certified , an ADA identification card will be issued . For applications or information , call ( 800 ) 438-1112 . TRACY WILSON</TEXT>
