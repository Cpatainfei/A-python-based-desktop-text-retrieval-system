   <HEADLINE> A BRIDGE BETWEEN TWO WORLDS ; FERRELL SECAKUKU VALUES TRADITION . BUT THE HOPI CHAIRMAN IS PUSHING A MODERN AGENDA TO MOVE THE 10 # 000-MEMBER TRIBE INTO THE 21ST CENTURY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ferrell Secakuku , the new chairman of Arizona ' s Hopi tribe , grew_up working in his father ' s trading_post , where groceries were often exchanged for the pottery , baskets and silver jewelry that are the Hopi artisan ' s signature . &quot; That was the traditional way , &quot; says the soft-spoken Secakuku , 56 , who spent his early years on the Hopi reservation , a series of arid villages in the high desert of northeastern Arizona . When his father sent him to Ganado Mission High_School , run_by the Presbyterian_Church on the Navajo reservation , he had known little beyond his birthplace , the land the Hopi regard_as the center of the universe . &quot; It was a total shock , &quot; he recalls . &quot; I was a full-fledged Hopi . I didn ' t even know how to speak English and I had no idea the world was made_up of many difficult , different environments. &quot; But Secakuku learned fast . Very few Hopi went_to college in the 1950s , but Secakuku ' s father had sent him off with instructions to &quot; be somebody. &quot; Secakuku graduated from Northern Arizona University with a business degree . &quot; He told me to learn the white_man ' s ways and lifestyle , and learn their business , and then come_back and help develop our people . There were no jobs on the reservation. &quot; Secakuku came_home with his business degree and converted the family trading_post to the only supermarket on the reservation . &quot; I applied modern techniques , &quot; he says . &quot; I introduced self-service , fresh produce , a deli section , videotapes , health and beauty aids. &quot; Secakuku may have learned the white_man ' s ways , but he never abandoned tradition . He is the first chairman of the Hopi tribe to be both a businessman and fully initiated into the Hopi religious societies . &quot; I ' m a member of the Snake Clan -- we dance the religious dances. &quot; When he decided two years ago to run_for chairman of his 10 # 000-member tribe , he turned_over the business to his family . &quot; I have six daughters and they grew_up in the business , &quot; he says . &quot; I like to say that the best_man for the job is a woman. &quot; But despite the reservation tradition of close-knit , extended families , Secakuku is divorced . &quot; It ' s unfortunate , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these modern times decided for us. &quot; * Describing himself as a bridge between two worlds , the Hopi chairman has an ambitious agenda for development projects in education , jobs , communications , business and health_care . His blueprint for the Hopi people was reiterated on a large scale last week as Native_American leaders from throughout the country sat_down with Clinton_Administration officials for a &quot; listening conference &quot; that followed a high-profile meeting with President Clinton at the White_House . Although the 500-plus Native_American tribes have various special needs , depending_on their history and location , a common thread running_through the discussions was a need for more tribal sovereignty . Says Secakuku : &quot; We want to move_into the 21st Century on our own terms. &quot; For the Hopi , heading the action list is an issue as old as the tribe itself -- water . &quot; It ' s an issue of extreme urgency , &quot; Secakuku says . On the landlocked Hopi reservation -- which has an average annual rainfall of 10 inches -- the sustaining water_supply is a naturally pure aquifer , a layer of porous rock 3 # 000 feet underground containing water that bubbles_up to the surface in springs and washes . Water shapes the entire culture . Not only have the Hopi used aquifer water for farming , drinking and bathing for 900 years , Secakuku says , but &quot; water is so sacred to the Hopi that is it like a bloodline to our heart. &quot; But for the past few years , the water has been drying_up . The washes are dry and the springs are disappearing , leading to a classic water-rights dispute . Under a lease signed 24 years ago , the St . Louis-based Peabody Western Coal Co . mines coal from the Hopi Black Mesa . To transport it to Southern California Edison ' s plant in Nevada , Peabody pulverizes the coal , mixes it with ground_water and delivers it through a pipeline . The unusual process ( this is the only slurry line in the continental United States ) gulps up a_billion gallons of aquifer water a year , more_than the Hopi use in a decade . And although the Hopi , and the neighboring Navajo Nation , leased both the water and coal rights to Peabody -- and consider the mining a business partnership -- the Hopi now see the slurry line as draining away their very existence as a prolonged drought makes_water more precious . &quot; Our land is drying_up , &quot; Secakuku says . &quot; Without water , our entire culture and people are at risk. &quot; * Revenues from the mining partnership are essential to the tribal budget and Secakuku emphasizes that &quot; no one wants the mining operation to end , but after making one mistake , we don ' t want to further it. &quot; The Hopi have suggested substituting pipeline water from Utah ' s Lake Powell for the ground_water . In St . Louis , Peabody spokesman Ron Greenfield reiterated the company ' s position that the pumping is not the culprit . &quot; Several studies have been done and they ' ve all shown no effect , &quot; he says . Nevertheless , Peabody has agreed to study alternatives , Greenfield says , &quot; but it won ' t be a simple process . Water_rights in the West are complex and controversial. &quot; The matter now rests with Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt . Secakuku and other tribal leaders were in Los Angeles last month to attend a forum , &quot; Energy 2000 and Beyond , &quot; at the Sheraton Grande . Relaxing in the hotel lobby before lunch , they talked_about Hopi self-determination . &quot; On one hand , we want to diversify our economy , &quot; Secakuku says . &quot; On the other , we are trying to reach back and find ourselves as Hopi people. &quot; The two goals are equal in priority , adds Wayne Taylor , 39 , the tribe ' s new vice_chairman . That was the message they got from voters when they went door-to-door campaigning before the election in February . &quot; The strong thing that came_out in the campaign , &quot; Taylor says , &quot; is that our people want to reaffirm our actual beliefs. &quot; * There is concern that young people aren ' t carrying_on the traditions . &quot; We ' re worried that young Hopi no longer speak their language , &quot; says Taylor , who has a business administration degree from the University of Arizona . &quot; We ' re worried about the brain_drain -- our people move to Flagstaff and Phoenix for jobs . We want to develop our economic base. &quot; Education and scholarships are major items , along with economic development , on the action plan Secakuku has drawn_up for his four-year term as chairman of the Hopi Tribal Council . Composed of representatives from the eight Hopi villages , the council meets the first week of each month at tribal headquarters in Kykotsmovi Village . Despite the pastoral look of the reservation -- with its dusty roads , vegetable_gardens and grazing sheep -- the Hopi do not live as they did 50 years ago , Secakuku says : &quot; Our lifestyle has changed quite a bit to reflect the white_man ' s ways. &quot; Most of the eight villages have running water_pumped from the aquifer and are wired for electricity or have solar_panels . The tribe has just published its first mail-order catalogue for Hopi jewelry , kachina figures , baskets and other crafts . This is just the beginning , the new tribal leaders say . &quot; We need better schools and more economic development so people can get_into business , &quot; Secakuku says . &quot; We need more controlled tourism -- right now ( visitors ) roam around all_over the place. &quot; * Looking toward the 21st Century , they can see potential in tapping Arizona ' s abundant solar_energy for rural_areas , and in producing their own electrical_energy through a tribal utility authority . &quot; We ' re doing a feasibility study for a wireless communication_system throughout the reservation , &quot; Taylor says . But heading every list is water . In a mountain of hydrologic studies , position papers , congressional hearings and petitions to the Department_of_the_Interior , the Hopi have chronicled their growing concern over the continued pumping of their ground_water . When the mining project began 24 years ago , Secakuku says , no one thought it would endanger the Hopi water_supply . In fact , a U.S. Geologic Survey computer model ( which has later been questioned ) predicted that the pumped water would be replenished naturally . &quot; Even at the time , our Hopi elders were warning us not to do_it , &quot; Secakuku says . &quot; But economy played a big part in the decision . &quot; We don ' t want to create any hard feelings , &quot; he adds , &quot; but we don ' t want to rape our land of water at the expense of the Hopi life. &quot;</TEXT>
