   <TEXT> The fate of a planned capital_gains tax has dominated the news in Israel this week , stealing headlines from the Nobel Peace Prize , guerrilla violence and an unprecedented trip to Japan by Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin . To tax or not to tax -- the question , coming just weeks before the levy is_due to take_effect , has stirred fevered debate and sent the stock_market on a roller_coaster ride . The uncertainty has been heightened by the absence of Rabin , who is visiting Japan and South_Korea . The tax proposal has upset investors in Israel ' s active stock_market , long viewed_as the only place where heavily taxed and inflation-ravaged Israelis could make money and legally keep their earnings away from the tax_collector . Hounded by Israeli reporters accompanying him from Oslo -- where he received the Nobel Prize over the weekend along with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO leader Yasser Arafat -- a tight-lipped Rabin has refused to comment on the tax , a 10 % levy on stock trading profits approved by Parliament last month . But banner headlines in Israeli newspapers , quoting sources close to Rabin , portray him as leaning toward postponing implementation new the tax , which is scheduled to take_effect Jan . 1 . The flurry of reports prompted a peeved Rabin to deny having authorized anyone in his entourage to speak about the tax . The unidentified sources were quoted as saying Rabin was weighing three options : delaying the tax for one to two years , a shorter delay , or making the tax contingent_on comprehensive tax reform . &quot; No one in my entourage was authorized to speak in my name on the subject of the bourse , &quot; Rabin told Israel Radio , adding that he will speak about the tax when he returns home early next week . Rabin publicly resisted the tax for months , only to endorse it when it was announced in August . He stunned Israelis at the time by saying they should not expect the country ' s prime_minister and finance_minister &quot; to tell the whole truth &quot; on tax_policies . Army radio said recent opinion polls showing the tax had cut deeply into Rabin ' s popularity sparked his reported change of heart on implementing it . He faces reelection in 1996 , and his Labor_Party is already in_trouble over the peace agreement with Arafat . * Radio shows have been flooded by telephone_calls from frustrated Israeli investors opposed to the tax . &quot; The average guy on the street has money in the Israeli stock_market , whether through direct investments or through mutual_funds and savings plans , and has lost a lot of money in 1994 , &quot; said economist Jonathan Katz of consulting firm Capital Holdings . Many Israelis were encouraged by easy credit available from banks last year to take_out loans to buy stocks . They then watched their investments dry_up as the benchmark Mishtanim Index fell 30.5 % since the start of the year . Katz said the capital_gains tax alone , which was announced in August , cannot be blamed for the market ' s decline . &quot; But people are looking_for something optimistic to get the market out of its slump , &quot; he said . &quot; And it ' s a game of politics now . The Labor_Party has seen its popularity decline. &quot; Finance_Minister Abraham Shohat , a strong supporter of the tax , said he managed to speak_to the elusive Rabin by telephone Tuesday and told him party members still back the tax . During a meeting of Labor deputies Monday , the brouhaha over the tax provoked an outburst from Transport Minister Yisrael Kessar , Rabin ' s temporary replacement and the only Cabinet_minister noted for his customary silence . &quot; Every country has a capital_gains tax ! &quot; Kessar shouted . &quot; Why shouldn ' t Israel ? &quot;</TEXT>
