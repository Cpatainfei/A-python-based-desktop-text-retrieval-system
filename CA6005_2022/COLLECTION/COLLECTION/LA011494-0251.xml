   <HEADLINE> TOMATO CROP FACES VIRUS PERIL ; AGRICULTURE : DISEASE CARRIED BY PEST HAS AFFECTED MUCH OF THE COUNTY ' S YIELD AND ALL OF IRVINE ' S . A USDA OFFICIAL FEARS IT COULD SPREAD TO OTHER PRODUCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County ' s $ 17-million tomato industry is threatened by a new and &quot; extremely serious &quot; virus that has destroyed much of the county ' s recent crop , officials from the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture said Thursday . According to researchers , the disease is transmitted by a nutrient-sucking insect called the greenhouse_whitefly and currently has &quot; affected 100 % of the ( tomato ) crops in the Irvine area. &quot; Last fall , growers in Irvine contacted the USDA after their crops started to fail . James E . Duffus , a USDA plant pathologist , said preliminary information has shown that the new , previously unidentified virus can be devastating . &quot; This is one of the most destructive diseases for tomato crops occurring in the state , &quot; Duffus said . He said the new virus is similar to a virus that has caused severe damage to desert lettuce and sugar_beet crops . Duffus presented his findings Thursday at a conference of California produce growers in San Francisco . He told them he was concerned about the disease ' s &quot; potential to spread &quot; to other tomato-farming regions throughout the state . California is the nation ' s No . 1 producer of tomatoes . In Orange County , they grow on more_than 1 # 700 acres of farmland and are the third most valuable crop , behind flowers and strawberries but ahead of oranges . Marcia Wood , a USDA spokeswoman , said the virus has already &quot; induced severe crop losses &quot; in Orange County . No other region seems to be affected by the new virus . Duffus said that at least one Orange County farm has stopped growing tomatoes because of the disease . &quot; They ' re afraid to start growing again , &quot; Duffus said . The financial toll the virus has caused in Orange County is not yet known , Duffus said . No local growers could be reached for comment Thursday night . Duffus said the disease causes yellowing , decay and death of the plant . He said it is possible that the disease could infect other crops in the county . &quot; We ' re looking_into that , &quot; he said . Researchers also are studying ways to control the spread of the virus . Although pesticides might work , Duffus said he hopes to find an environmentally safe alternative . If the virus is not controlled , it could &quot; force the abandonment &quot; of Irvine as a tomato-producing area , he said , adding that it could be several years before an &quot; antiserum &quot; is found to defeat the virus . &quot; At this point we just don ' t know a whole heck of a lot about this virus , &quot; Duffus said . The most important thing right now , Duffus said , is to discover the source of the virus that the pest carries . Once the source is isolated , &quot; than maybe we can eliminate it as a problem , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
