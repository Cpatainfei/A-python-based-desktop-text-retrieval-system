   <HEADLINE> DOCTOR WORKING TO EASE INFANTS ' PAIN ; MEDICINE : O.C. SPECIALIST JOINS THE FIGHT AGAINST PROFESSION ' S TRADITIONAL RELUCTANCE TO ORDER DRUGS FOR SUFFERING BABIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a pediatric resident seven years ago , Dr. Perry Eisner had what would seem simple goals : to stick_up for his tiny patients and , as much as possible , protect them from pain . Turned_out not to be so simple . Eisner recalls being paged in the middle of the night to the bedsides of wailing infants fresh from major_surgery . The parents would plead with him frantically : &quot; can ' t you do something for our baby ? &quot; But overworked surgical residents , who controlled the infants ' cases , routinely would veto his orders for medication to ease their suffering . &quot; Either they would claim it ' s not painful or they would say , ' It doesn ' t hurt in kids like it does_in adults , ' &quot; said Eisner , 34 , grimacing at the once-prevalent notion . &quot; I couldn ' t stand it . It was awful. &quot; So awful that Eisner later decided to make pediatric pain relief his life ' s work . After completing a fellowship in pediatric anesthesia and critical care three years ago , the young doctor joined a growing contingent of physicians and nurses who attack pain with the vigor their colleagues apply to life-threatening scourges . Using numbing drugs infused through a catheter , Eisner can block the nerve_impulses of his little patients to_the_point that they feel next to nothing in the days following surgery . The technique , long used in adults but uncommon in children , is just one way of practicing what academics , nurses and some parents have preached for some time : Babies recover best when they don ' t hurt . &quot; The big change has come_in the past five or 10 years , &quot; said Dr. Feizal Waffarn , professor of pediatrics at UCI Medical_Center in Orange and attending neonatologist . &quot; There is better training , I think , education , and some very nice studies done to show that infants indeed sense pain , feel pain no different than adults. &quot; But in many hospitals and clinics , the old ways die_hard . Five years ago , Eisner had to search high and low for a physician who would use a local_anesthetic during circumcision of his newborn son . Now , he describes unmedicated circumcisions as a pet peeve , saying no one but a helpless infant would submit to such an excruciating procedure . &quot; When you ask why ( doctors are stingy with pain medication to youngsters ) , they say , ' Well , I ' ve done_it that way for years , &quot; said Eisner , who is_on the staff of Saddleback Memorial Medical_Center and Saddleback Valley Outpatient Surgery Center in Laguna Hills . &quot; Well , that ' s not really a good answer . The fact that you can do something without someone dying doesn ' t mean it ' s a good thing to do. &quot; Historically , children have received poor &quot; pain management &quot; across the United States , said Dr. Lonnie Zeltzer , who heads the Pediatric Pain Program at UCLA , one of just a_few such centers in the country . &quot; A lot of it has to do with the fear that drugs would be too toxic , and with not knowing how to measure pain &quot; in the very young , who , after all , cannot speak_for themselves , she said . The situation arises most commonly when physicians are treating newborns under 2 months old and premature infants , said Dr. M . Douglas Cunningham , medical director for newborn medicine at Long_Beach Memorial Medical_Center , who practiced for many years at UCI Medical_Center and Saddleback . The result : Even major_surgery , such_as spreading the ribs to tie off a blood_vessel near the heart in premature infants , has been performed with little or no anesthetic . Not to mention minor procedures such_as placing chest tubes or drawing bone_marrow . It has been only seven years since the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that it was unethical to perform surgery on premature infants without an anesthetic . Doctors ' aversion to pain medications -- particularly narcotics -- was not a matter of callousness or cruelty , Cunningham said . &quot; A very large part of it was the fear of addiction . . . . That coupled with the fact that infants don ' t tolerate meds well ( and ) a concern about overdosing . &quot; that ' s where Dr. Eisner ' s group has really led the way : precise dosage , careful monitoring , focusing_on the period when pain is real &quot; and discontinuing medication when it stops , Cunningham said . Surgeons whom Eisner works with also appreciate his use of local_anesthetics because it minimizes the need for narcotics . &quot; We do a lot of procedures on the genitalia , testicular surgery , &quot; said Dr. Igal Silber , who specializes in pediatric urology . &quot; This is the ideal type of anesthesia . If you just give injections of morphine , Demerol , ( infants ) still tend to thrash_about a lot &quot; in recovery . The use of local_anesthetics has become increasingly common , especially among more recently trained anesthesiologists . A key development paving the way for longer-term treatment of infants ' pain was the introduction of longer-lasting local_anesthetics and the development of preemptive analgesia -- pain medication given before an operation to reduce pain afterward , said Dr. David Steward , director of anesthesiology at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles . &quot; It stops the noxious stimuli from ever getting . . . to the spinal_cord or brain , &quot; he said , even after the surgical gas wears_off . Other research has led the once-standard notions to crumble : that children do not feel pain as acutely as adults , that they don ' t remember what they do feel , and that they are so resilient that any unpleasant experience is of no long-term significance . &quot; Some studies have been done over the past five or six years showing that when you don ' t use anesthesia , not only is it ethically a bad thing to do , there are real medical consequences , &quot; Eisner said . One such study , published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1992 , found that newborns lightly anesthetized during cardiac surgery fared much worse than those who were heavily anesthetized . According to the study , by K.J.S. Anand and his team , the babies who received less anesthesia experienced a much greater stress response -- such_as higher levels of the hormones epinephrine and cortisol -- and had a significantly higher post-operative death rate . In the same issue that carried this research , the Journal issued a challenge to its audience , seemingly wondering why clinicians have been so slow to act_on the latest science . &quot; It seems that we are_better able to tolerate an infant ' s pain than to deal with our own discomfort and insecurity about the correct dose of pain medication to give the infant , &quot; the Journal concluded in the introspective editorial . &quot; Now that the benefit of pain relief has been so clearly demonstrated , it is our responsibility to treat pain in neonates and infants as effectively as we do_in other patients. &quot; Studies on rats suggest that if babies experience significant pain , it disturbs the growth and development of the nervous_system and can make them more susceptible to pain as adults , UCLA ' S Zeltzer said . The overall objective , Eisner said , is to make the hospital or clinic visit &quot; completely non-stressful. &quot; That means not only using the best medications in the best dosage , but treating the child and parents with sensitivity . For example , he said , it is not a good idea to separate a child from his parents and hold him down -- probably kicking and screaming -- to place an anesthesia mask over his face . He remembers with chagrin his rotations at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles , when terrified youngsters would ask him , &quot; You ' re not going_to use the mask , are you ? &quot; Better to give a child a mild sedative and sometimes even allow his parents to hold and rock him . Then apply the mask . &quot; Ninety-nine percent of the time , they don ' t cry at all , &quot; he said . Eisner can ' t ask his infant patients whether they appreciate his approach , but he said they have their ways of letting it be known when they don ' t : Grimaces , fixed stares and a high-pitched wail , for example . Parents are grateful when they don ' t have to hear that . &quot; It ' s blood-curdling , &quot; said Tracy Garrison of Irvine , who has learned to discern her 5-week-old son Joshua ' s I ' m-in-pain shrieks from the I ' m-hungry and I ' m-wet varieties . But the boy emitted nary a whimper after testicular surgery last week for which Eisner numbed his lower body . &quot; He ' s as happy as he could be , &quot; the baby ' s father , Mac , said as the child tugged on a bottle only an hour after the outpatient operation . To prevent post-operative pain involving long-term recovery , Eisner often performs what is known as an epidural . He injects local_anesthetic through a catheter placed in children ' s lower backs , which is fed into the epidural space surrounding the spinal_cord . A local_anesthetic , Marcaine or lidocaine , and a low concentration of narcotics are infused to numb nerves leading to the incision . During the days after leg , chest or abdominal surgery , youngsters often don ' t feel a thing , he said . Although the procedure has been used for years on adults , he said , physicians are often loath to risk it on young children because of its limited track record . Eisner estimated that 10 % of anesthesiologists use the technique on youngsters . Experts like Steward of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles stress that the technique is only one means of pain control and cannot be used for all types of surgery . Also , it requires training and expertise , and the patients must be closely watched . Finally , to many doctors who treat children , the procedure has yet to prove itself . &quot; There ' s always been a caution in applying things in new age_groups , particularly when what you ' re doing is complicated , &quot; Steward said . &quot; You ' re dealing with smaller needles , a smaller catheter , a different anatomy in the epidural space . . . . &quot; &quot; We haven ' t decided what the place of epidural_anesthesia is in the neonate . People are waiting to see what the safety record is. &quot; Eisner said he has never had a complication and expects use of epidurals in young children to become routine -- that is , as long as health_insurance companies will pay_for it . &quot; I think with kids it ' s going_to be equally as safe as with adults , if not more so , &quot; he said.
