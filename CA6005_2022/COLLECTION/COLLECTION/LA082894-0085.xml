   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; MICHAEL HESELTINE ; BRITAIN ' S PRIME TORY ASSESSES PARTY ' S CHANCES -- THEY ' RE GOOD ( OF COURSE )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To Conservative_Party supporters and the_British tabloids , he is known as &quot; Tarzan. &quot; Indeed , Michael Ray Dibdin Heseltine looks the part and is one of the most popular political figures with the Tory rank-and-file -- at the grass-roots level . Tall , rangy , with Kirk Douglas looks and flowing blond locks that are beginning to whiten , Heseltine always stirs_up the faithful with rousing speeches at Conservative_Party conferences . In person , he seems almost too big for his top-floor office as secretary_of_state for trade and industry in Prime_Minister John Major ' s Cabinet . The job also carries the title president of the board of trade , and , perhaps significantly , he prefers the title &quot; president &quot; to &quot; secretary of state. &quot; Now 61 , he was a successful publisher before winning a seat in the House of Commons and served in the government of Prime_Minister Edward Heath in the early 1970s . Heseltine supported Heath in his losing battle for the Tory Party leadership against Margaret Thatcher in 1975 . But Thatcher appointed him to her first Cabinet as environment secretary in 1979 . He shifted to defense in 1983 but , after in an internal argument over policy , he resigned in a huff in 1986 . In 1990 , from the backbenches , Heseltine led the move to depose Thatcher . He was successful -- but partly because of his spoiling role , lost the vote for the prime_minister ' s post to Major . Nonetheless , Heseltine is often mentioned as a leading successor to Major if the prime_minister should step_down or be deposed . Heseltine maintains that he is a loyal supporter of Major . Heseltine lives at his 800-acre country estate with his wife , Anne . They have three children . He suffered a serious heart_attack last year , which may have reduced his chances of ever becoming prime_minister . But he was looking tanned and fit during a recent conversation in his Spartan office in the department ' s high-rise overlooking London ' s Westminister district . Question : As Britain gets closer to Europe , it gets farther from the United States . Should America be worried ? Answer : No . American governments since that of President Eisenhower have been consistent in urging Britain to become more closely involved in the European postwar movement . And so , they shouldn ' t be surprised if we do . But it serves both British self-interest and American interest . It serves British self-interest for all_the obvious reasons that the configuration of power is increasingly focused_on the shrinking world market and three regional markets of the Pacific , America and Europe . And for Britain to be a leading voice in that process means that we tend to influence the climate , the environment in which decisions are taken that affect us profoundly . From America ' s point_of_view , the attitudes of the Anglo-Saxon , capitalist culture , the attitudes toward the defense of the free_world , the common language , gives America the opportunity to know that there is a very sympathetic and historically close ally at the decision-making process which -- as our interests tend to coincide in many ways -- is to American interests as well . Q : Isn ' t there a lot of tension in Britain right now , as regards the role of Britain in the world ? A : Well , there ' s always tension in democratic politics , that ' s the great strength of democracy , that it resolves tensions in an amicable , peaceful way . But it would be unthinkable for a shift of British policy of such historic proportions to be conducted without tension across the political spectrum , both within and between parties . But the broad thrust of the process is acknowledged by all parties today . Q : Another American fear is the fear of a Labor_Party government -- we ' ve been dealing with a Conservative_Party government for 15 years , and it ' s worked rather well , on the whole . Are the American fears of a Labor government legitimate ? A : Well , they ' re not going_to be in power . Socialism is bankrupt . If you look_at the late 19th Century -- where the excesses of capitalism were thought to be susceptible to cure by statist solutions , whether they were socialist or communist -- it was quite widely believed that there had to be a more orderly , a more planned , a more centralist , a more egalitarian way of managing complex societies . The movement in that direction lasted until the 1980s . The fact is that there is no serious contribution today being made by socialism across the world . To the extent there is a huge debate about the future of societies , it ' s all based upon the philosophies of the free-enterprise capitalist culture . Cuba may be the exception -- but there ' s hardly any exceptions to this rule . So any party which has its roots and its emotions , its instincts and its power base in yesterday ' s structures cannot win . They are simply out of date . Q : In the event , however likely or unlikely , of a Labor government , what would be the implications of British foreign_policy vis-a-vis the United States ? A : The difficulty about the Labor foreign_policy at the moment is that it ' s very difficult to know what it would actually amount to in practice . It has always tended to be anti-American in its basis . There are ( Labor_Party ) trigger words -- there are bosses , there ' s profits , there ' s capitalism and there ' s America . And those are the sort of words that bring rapturous applause from the audiences of the left . If you want to get them off their butts , cheering in the aisles , you play that variety of music . Now , of course , trying to win power they ' ve learnt to suppress this instinct and this phraseology but , deep down , it ' s all there . Q : As a leading light of the Tory Party , with polls in the last six months to a year showing the party quite low , what ' s your solution for bringing the Tories back_out on top for the next general_election -- which might not be until 1997 ? A : Well , you ' re right to set the question in the right time_scale -- the next general_election is a long way from today . And the answer to your question , in a single word , is recession . If you look_at similar societies to ours , you will find that there is no exception to the rule , that recession has cost the governments of those countries their existence . President Bush failed to secure reelection in America , the incumbent government was beaten_in Canada , the Liberal Democrats lost power for the first time in 40 years in Japan , the socialists were beaten_in France and , until recently , Chancellor Kohl has been into similar difficulties in Germany . We , too , are no exception to this rule . Democracies take a toll of their political_leaders when the economic circumstances take a toll of democracies . As we ' re just coming_through the longest and deepest recession of the postwar world , there ' s no way that elected governments could escape_from its ravages . And the answer follows from this analysis , that if we , as a government , are going_to keep our nerve , we are in an extremely competitive position , economically and industrially , today , and by the time we get_to the election , the growing confidence in the management of our companies will have been translated into an understanding in the public mind of why we had to achieve the low-inflation and low-interest background for the restoration of our fortunes , and how the people have benefited from that . But you can ' t get people to understand that in_advance of the delivery . Q : There is speculation about the next prime_minister . Who will that be ? A : Yes , well , my analysis goes_on to answer the question quite easily . I think that the current prime minster , John Major , will lead the Conservatives in the next election , and we will be elected with an increased majority . The prime_minister will be seen as a man of steel who ' s kept his nerve and led us through the most difficult , stretching circumstances , and I can hear the speeches that everyone will be making then . I say all this because I ' ve been through these experiences so many times in the mid-term of governments . Q : Now that Tony Blair has succeeded to the Labor leadership , is this bright , fresh face a danger to the Conservative_Party ? A : The only thing that would be a danger to the Conservative_Party is if the economy isn ' t as_good_as I think it will be . The personalities will fade into insignificance against economic delivery . You can ' t fool the people -- they know whether the economy is suiting them or not , because they know what their relative living standards are doing , and a sense of confidence in jobs , and all_of that is very much a personal_judgment for them . Q : It seems as if there is a trend toward a more measured role for the state . A : Yes , it ' s a very important point , and I think it ' s manifest in many ways . The whole privatization across the world is an indication of governments recognizing the restraints in what they can do . The need to cut public borrowing across the world is the recognition that governments just can ' t go_on borrowing ; it has malign consequences on the management of the economy . So there ' s a new consensus and essentially a right-wing consensus -- this is , in fact , the analysis I was giving you a_few minutes ago . A left-wing government could no more escape_from that than any other government , but they would hate not being able to escape , whereas on the right , we tend to welcome the disciplines that it imposes once we recognize the beneficial effects . That presents left-wing governments with enormous difficulties -- because their heart isn ' t in it . They actually want to supply the left-wing solutions , the statist solutions , but they can ' t . Q : You often emphasize the need for government to help and be involved in sectors of the economy that are hurting . One phrase in America for this is &quot; industrial policy. &quot; Do you favor a kind of industrial policy ? A : Oh , yes . Every government has an industrial policy , even if the essence of the policy is not to have a policy . . . . The concepts of industrial policy , industrial strategy , whatever you call it , are the subject of deep and burning controversy . Now you have gone_to one aspect of the dangers of one sort of industrial strategy , which is overregulation . There are many other dangers . One is oversubsidization , because you preserve inefficiencies . The other is over-state ownership , because then you create monoplies and then you protect them . You can go_to the other end of the political spectrum and have an industrial policy which says we ' ll do nothing to help anybody in any circumstances , whereupon you find yourself getting wiped_out by other countries that have heavily supported this , that or the other thing . . . . Helping ( British ) companies to win ( in the world marketplace ) means you have to be very hard-nosed about your analysis about what will help them win . You do not work_on the assumption that what they tell you is what will help them to win . Because if you do that , you go_down the road that you were talking_about -- which is subsidy protection . It doesn ' t help them to win ; it may only help the weak to survive , but not for long . The first and biggest goal of all is getting the macroeconomic policies right . You get low inflation , low interest_rates , good industrial relations , high productivity , low taxes at a competitive exchange_rate and a heck of a lot will go right for you . Not everything , if you don ' t educate your people and train them properly . So you ' ve gotta get that right and even if you get that right , there are all sorts of other things that then come_into play . America today , for example , is being very aggressive in its use of export_credits . And I get companies saying we can beat them on price but we can ' t beat them on the credits -- well , that ' s a state intervention . I mean , America has always been a very formidable competitor . Q : You ' ve got an awfully small desk ; one expected to see something like that Chaplin movie , with the biggest desk in the world . A : Not much happens in this office . Q : Why such a small desk ? A : There ' s nothing much to put_on it .</TEXT>
