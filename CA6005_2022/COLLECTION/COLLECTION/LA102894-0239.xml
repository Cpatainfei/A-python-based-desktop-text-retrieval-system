   <HEADLINE> 3 CONVICTED IN MURDER OF POLICE_OFFICER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three men were convicted of first-degree murder Thursday for killing a Maywood police_officer , and two of them also were found guilty of murdering a Van Nuys market owner , clearing the way for a jury to decide whether they should be sentenced to death . A Los Angeles Superior_Court jury found Jose Contreras , Benjamin Alberto Navarro and Edgardo Sanchez Fuentes guilty of the May 29 , 1992 , shooting of Officer John Hoglund , who was gunned_down as he responded to a silent burglar_alarm at a Maywood market . Hoglund , 46 , was the first officer in the history of the Maywood Police_Department to be killed in the line_of_duty . Contreras and Fuentes also were convicted of murdering Lee Chul Kim , 49 , who was shot May 4 , 1992 , in the freezer of his grocery_store in Van Nuys after he returned from the bank with a large amount of cash . The verdicts pleased Hoglund ' s friends who were in court Thursday . &quot; I ' m stunned , I ' m amazed and I think it ' s great , &quot; said his fiancee , Terri Smith , who recalled that the night before he was killed , Hoglund had set their wedding date . Fuentes and Contreras were each convicted on 38 counts -- including murder , robbery and assault with a deadly weapon -- stemming from a series of seven robberies . Navarro , who was not charged in connection with the Kim slaying , was convicted on 32 counts for his role in five of the robberies . In addition , the three men were found guilty of special allegations that expose them to the death_penalty , including killing a police_officer and committing murder during the course of a robbery and to avoid arrest . Fuentes and Contreras , each acquitted of two counts of robbery , were found guilty of the special allegation of committing multiple murders . To convict the men , all_in their early 20s , prosecutors relied_on a security camera videotape that clearly captured the images of the three defendants inside the burglarized Maywood grocery_store , minutes before the shooting of Hoglund . At one point in the video , some of them were shown walking_around the store after the robbery , drinking Gatorade . Prosecutors also alleged that during the robberies , which spanned an area from Paramount to Van Nuys , the defendants used electric stun guns on employees to torture them into handing_over money , threatened to cut_off one woman ' s fingers and shoved a gun in a man ' s mouth . The trial is to continue Monday with the start of the penalty phase , during which jurors must decide whether the three should be sentenced to death . &quot; We ' ve known from the outset that the fiercest battle is going_to be waged at the penalty phase , &quot; said James Leonard , an attorney for Contreras . &quot; I ' m confident that after a jury hears all_the evidence about Mr. Contreras ' life , they will reject the death penalty. &quot; Eric K . Davis , an attorney for Navarro , who described the verdicts as &quot; expected , &quot; said he will present a psychologist who is an expert on Central_American culture to testify on behalf of his client , who is from El_Salvador . &quot; My client has never denied his involvement , but our position has always been that . . . the death_penalty is not the appropriate punishment , &quot; said Davis .</TEXT>
