   <HEADLINE> TICKETMASTER DOCUMENTS SOUGHT IN PROBE ; ENTERTAINMENT : ROCK_GROUP PEARL JAM FILED A FEDERAL COMPLAINT ALLEGING THAT AGENCY ' S MONOPOLY KEPT IT FROM TOURING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As part of its investigation into anti-competitive practices in the ticket distribution industry , the Justice_Department has demanded that Ticketmaster turn_over documents related to the probe . The Times learned Tuesday that the Los Angeles-based ticket agency was served late last week with a &quot; civil investigative demand &quot; -- the equivalent of a subpoena -- requiring it to turn_over contracts and other pertinent records . The investigation stems from an antitrust complaint filed with the Justice_Department last month by the Seattle rock_group Pearl Jam . A spokesman for the department declined to comment on the action , but he acknowledged that the investigation is proceeding . Ned S . Goldstein , Ticketmaster vice_president , said it would be inappropriate to comment on whether the company had been served papers . But he said Ticketmaster would &quot; deal with whatever arises in the appropriate manner and will prevail and be exonerated at all levels. &quot; As part of their investigation , Justice_Department officials from Washington have been in Los Angeles recently , interviewing music business figures . Among those contacted this week by the government were representatives for recording artists Sting and R.E.M. , sources said . Lawyers for Pearl Jam have accused Ticketmaster of exercising a monopoly over ticket distribution and using that influence to keep promoters from booking the band ' s summer tour , which was canceled . Pearl Jam sought to limit ticket prices to $ 18 , plus a $ 1.80 handling fee -- low by pop standards . The band ' s complaint , filed by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell , a prominent New York law_firm , alleged that Ticketmaster has exclusive arrangements with all_important concert venues in the country and uses the relationships to &quot; cement control over the distribution of tickets to concerts. &quot; Ticketmaster has dominated the ticket market since 1991 . In May of that year , the Justice_Department ' s antitrust division gave the go-ahead for Ticketmaster to buy certain assets from Ticketron , which at the time was its only major competitor . * RELATED STORY : F1</TEXT>
