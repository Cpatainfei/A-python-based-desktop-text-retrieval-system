   <HEADLINE> FLORIDA BAY ECOSYSTEM ON VERGE OF COLLAPSE ; EXPERTS DIFFER ON CAUSE ; ENVIRONMENT : SOME BLAME DIVERSION OF FRESH WATER FOR FARMING ; OTHERS SAY POLLUTION RUNOFF IS UPSETTING THE BALANCE OF LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a sunny Florida Keys morning , the kind of day when death should have been_on vacation . Charter fishing guide John Kipp revved_up his 17-foot skiff and joked with his two passengers as they glided through flat bay water and headed for Rabbit Key . They were_after big_game : tarpon , which they would cut loose after capture to allow the silver monsters to fight again another day . Kipp saw the dead fish about eight miles out . Hundreds , perhaps thousands , of them were lying on their sides , motionless but for the rocking caused by the boat ' s bow wave as he throttled back for a better look . Each button eye was staring into the sun , as if in shock . &quot; They were not small fish , &quot; Kipp recalled . &quot; These were large snappers , barracudas . It certainly wasn ' t a good sign. &quot; The fish devastation Kipp saw last August has become a distressingly common sight in Florida Bay , a 1 # 000-square-mile wedge of water between the Florida Keys and the Gulf_of_Mexico , once haunted by the_likes_of Zane Grey and Ernest Hemingway . Everyone agrees that Florida Bay is dying . The question is how to bring it back to life . As it expires , it threatens to take with it much of south Florida ' s sport and commercial fishing industry . Floridians also fear harm to other natural assets , including almost 500 # 000 acres of mangroves that line the shores and islands , and the chain of coral_reefs just offshore in the Atlantic_Ocean that annually draw hordes of scuba_divers and snorkelers . Dusky blooms of algae sometimes stain as much as half of the bay . The brown and green smudges suck_up oxygen that fish need for life and choke_off beds of sea grass and sponges that lobsters , stone_crabs and other species call home . &quot; No one wants to swim in dark green water , and nobody wants to go fishing if the fish aren ' t there , &quot; said stone crabber and lobsterman Karl Lessard of Marathon , Fla . &quot; I ' ve seen dive boats just bring the people back to the dock and give them their money back because the visibility was down to zero. &quot; &quot; This is an ecosystem on the verge of collapse , &quot; said Michael Collins , an Islamorada charter boat owner who used to help run fishing expeditions for President George_Bush and his friends . &quot; Just five years ago you could read a newspaper lying on the bottom through eight feet of water , &quot; Collins said . &quot; Now , sometimes the visibility is less than six inches. &quot; Commercial fishermen and marine scientists report declines of 80 % in catches of pink shrimp and 30 % in juvenile spiny_lobsters . Average lobster catches_on the east_side of the bay are down 40 % , and commercial catches of pompano and mackerel have plummeted by 75 % . The damage is all_the more remarkable because it has occurred in an area nominally protected by the federal_government . The bay is part of Everglades National_Park . For years , environmentalists , along with fishermen and others who depend_on Florida Bay for a living , have argued that the chief culprit has been the diversion of fresh_water that once flowed into the bay from the Everglades . That view is now disputed by scientists who blame high nitrogen levels caused by pesticides and other chemicals . Since early in the century , water has been siphoned_off from the vast wetlands to the north to create farmland , control flooding and provide drinking_water for cities on both of Florida ' s coasts . The freshwater diversions have intensified over the last decade . Today , 1 # 400 miles of canals drain off 970 billion gallons of water a year . Park hydrologists estimate that the bay receives as little as 10 % of the fresh_water it once did . These diversions , the environmentalists say , have upset the delicate balance between fresh_water and salt water that sustains Florida Bay ' s diverse plant and animal life , elevating salinity levels and setting_off chains of destruction . All this has produced a bitter struggle between the bay advocates and the farmers whose livelihoods depend_on the diverted water . After years of controversy and delay , state and federal agencies have agreed that the way to save the bay is to restore the flow of fresh_water . The Army Corps of Engineers recently proposed that the federal_government buy a belt of farmland north of the bay to act_as a buffer zone between the Everglades and other farmland . The immense plumbing_system would be redesigned to restore much of the freshwater flow into the bay . The initial estimated cost of the whole project is $ 100 million . Other scientists argue that the biggest problem isn ' t salinity , but pollution . Some say that chemical runoff from farms and cities raises the levels of nitrogen in bay waters , sustaining the death-producing algae . Others attribute the high nitrogen content to decaying sea grasses . Principal proponent of the runoff view is marine biologist Brian LaPointe , who operates an independent laboratory at Florida ' s Big Pine Key . &quot; Nutrient pollution is the No . 1 threat to water quality in Florida Bay , &quot; he said . &quot; Adding more water is like adding fuel to the fire. &quot; Bruce Rosendahl , dean of the University of Miami ' s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science , advocates a federally financed two-year study of the bay ' s ecosystem . &quot; We think lack of water flow into the bay is certainly a problem , &quot; he said . &quot; But it ' s probably a complex series of issues , including pollution . I would like to know what the entire problem is before I start dumping money into any one part of it. &quot; In the meantime , veteran fisherman John Kipp doubts that anything will be done soon . &quot; we ' ll probably all be dead before it ' s cleaned_up , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
