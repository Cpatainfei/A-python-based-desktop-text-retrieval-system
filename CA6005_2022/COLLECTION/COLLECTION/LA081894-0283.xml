   <HEADLINE> ALTMAN RESIGNS OVER WHITEWATER ; PROBE : DEPUTY TREASURY_SECRETARY IS THE HIGHEST-RANKING VICTIM OF THE CONTROVERSY . THE DEPARTMENT ' S TOP LAWYER IS ALSO EXPECTED TO STEP_DOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Deputy Treasury_Secretary Roger Altman , facing intense criticism from Congress for his role in the Whitewater affair , resigned Wednesday , becoming the Clinton_Administration ' s highest-ranking victim of the controversy . President Clinton accepted Altman ' s resignation after Democratic leaders on Capitol_Hill made_it clear to the White_House and to Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen that they believed Altman ' s credibility with Congress had been irreparably damaged . Late Wednesday , Bentsen recommended to Clinton that Treasury Undersecretary Frank Newman be nominated to succeed Altman . Newman is a former vice_chairman of Bank of America who in his current post has been overseeing financial and banking policy issues . In addition , Administration sources said Treasury general counsel Jean Hanson , who was also caught_up in the controversy because of her testimony during congressional hearings , earning Altman ' s enmity for contradicting his statements , will resign soon -- perhaps as early today . Treasury Chief_of_Staff Joshua L . Steiner , the third senior Treasury official under_fire from Republicans in the controversy , will stay_on at the department , sources said . Altman ' s resignation as the Treasury_Department ' s second-highest official had been widely anticipated since he was forced to endure 16 hours of testimony during the House and Senate Whitewater hearings , grilled by angry lawmakers over what both Democrats and Republicans charged was his lack of candor with Congress . In his letter of resignation to the President , his old college classmate from Georgetown University , Altman said he hoped that &quot; my stepping_down will help to diminish the controversy. &quot; The former Wall_Street investment_banker , who first worked_at the Treasury_Department in the Jimmy_Carter Administration , added that he regretted &quot; any mistakes or errors of judgment I may have made. &quot; Altman noted that his resignation would be effective after his successor is confirmed by the Senate . Treasury officials said it was unclear whether Altman plans to return to Wall_Street , however . Clinton , who talked with Altman by telephone before the resignation was announced , wrote in a letter to him : &quot; I believe you have taken the right step under the circumstances and I regretfully accept your resignation. &quot; Clinton added that Altman &quot; had made many valuable contributions to this Administration. &quot; Altman ' s congressional critics from both parties praised his decision to step_down . Democrats made_it clear that they believed his effectiveness in dealing with Congress on key legislative matters was at an end . &quot; Mr. Altman ' s ability to serve the President had been damaged and I support his decision to resign , &quot; said Sen . Donald W . Riegle Jr . ( D-Mich. ) , the chairman of the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee , which conducted the Whitewater hearings in the upper chamber . &quot; The situation is unfortunate and regrettable. &quot; Republicans , however , were far less sympathetic and appeared gleeful over helping to pressure Clinton to abandon one of his oldest friends in the Administration . And Altman ' s resignation seemed to renew their desire to stay_on the offensive on the Whitewater matter . &quot; Today ' s announcement is a welcome action that is long overdue , &quot; said Sen . Christopher S . Bond ( R-Mo. ) , a Republican member of the banking panel . &quot; While a step_in the right direction , I believe we ' ve only scratched the surface and much remains to be learned before all_of the questions are answered. &quot; Sen . Alfonse M . D ' Amato ( R-N.Y. ) , the ranking Republican on the Senate committee and Altman ' s most vocal critic in Congress , said simply : &quot; It ' s about time Altman resigned. &quot; Altman is the third high-ranking Administration official to be forced_out recently . White_House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum resigned under_fire in March for his controversial handling of Whitewater matters after the suicide of Deputy White_House Counsel Vincent Foster . Associate Atty . Gen . Webster Hubbell , a former law partner of First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton , also resigned in March after their former Little_Rock , Ark. , law_firm began an ethics investigation into Hubbell ' s past billing practices . The inquiry appeared to be prompted in part by the intense scrutiny the firm was under as a result of its own role in the Whitewater controversy . The resignation of the 48-year-old Altman is a severe blow to Clinton . Altman had been widely viewed both inside and outside the Administration as one of the President ' s most effective and able advisers . He played an influential role on a wide range of policy fronts -- from the budget to trade to health_care reform -- and appeared to be_on track to succeed Bentsen as Treasury_secretary . Largely because of Altman ' s energy , political skills and close ties to the President , the Treasury_Department became one of the bright success stories of Clinton ' s first year in office . The President relied_on Bentsen and Altman to take_on some of his Administration ' s toughest tasks . Altman ran the White_House &quot; war room &quot; during last summer ' s congressional battle over Clinton ' s economic plan and helped push the North_American Free_Trade Agreement through Congress . During the 1993 economic summit in Tokyo , Altman acted_as a key trade negotiator with Japanese officials and helped close a deal on a new framework for future trade negotiations . Both Bentsen and Altman stepped into the breach on health_care just as the Administration ' s plan began to come under_attack in Congress and around the country this year . But Altman ' s political demise came as a result of yet another task he was asked to perform for the Administration : running the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency that supervises cleanup of the savings and loan failures of the 1980s . When the Administration ' s initial candidate to take_over the regulatory_agency failed to win confirmation last year , Altman was named acting RTC chairman while continuing to serve in the No . 2 Treasury job . He was thus put_in the awkward role of running an independent regulatory_agency that was conducting a criminal investigation of Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan , a failed Arkansas thrift owned by James B . McDougal . McDougal was the partner of then-Gov . Clinton and his wife in the Whitewater real_estate development in northwest Arkansas . The government is investigating whether the Whitewater project caused losses at Madison Guaranty and whether federally insured deposits from the thrift were siphoned_off through the development to benefit Clinton ' s 1984 gubernatorial campaign . Altman , while wearing two hats , was involved in daily meetings with White_House officials on sensitive political matters in his role as an appointee at the Treasury_Department . He came under_fire in Congress -- both before and during the Whitewater hearings -- because of contacts between the White_House and the Treasury_Department concerning the RTC ' s confidential investigation into Madison Guaranty . Former Whitewater special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr . cleared Altman and other Treasury and White_House officials of criminal wrongdoing in their discussions of the_matter and the Office of Government Ethics also said Altman did not violate government ethics rules . But Altman ' s critics in Congress argued that the Treasury official repeatedly failed to disclose to them the full scope of the contacts , especially during an initial hearing in February , when the contacts were first revealed . At that first hearing before the Senate banking panel , Altman acknowledged just one contact . But he was forced to repeatedly amend his more recent testimony to reveal additional contacts . And White_House officials testified during this summer ' s hearings that they realized last February that Altman had not fully disclosed to the committee what he knew . In addition , Hanson , who helped Altman at the RTC while continuing to work_at the Treasury_Department , also sharply contradicted Altman during the hearings . She came under_fire for meeting last September with Nussbaum to inform him that the RTC was preparing to issue a criminal referral to the Justice_Department that would name President Clinton ' s 1984 gubernatorial campaign as a possible beneficiary of criminal acts at Madison Guaranty . Altman stressed that he was not aware of that meeting . Hanson said Altman suggested that she meet with Nussbaum . And she made_it clear that she believed that Altman knew more about the initial Treasury-White House contacts than he had said .</TEXT>
