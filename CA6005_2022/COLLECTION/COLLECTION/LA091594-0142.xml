   <HEADLINE> A NEW HOME FOR THE CITY ' S HOMELESS ; SKID_ROW : BENEFITS OF UNION RESCUE MISSION ' S MOVE INTO A SPACIOUS MODERN BUILDING WILL DEFUSE COMMUNITY WORRIES ABOUT DRAWBACKS , ITS PLANNERS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For seven decades , the Union Rescue Mission has provided food , shelter and spiritual solace to untold thousands of homeless people at its headquarters near Main and 2nd streets in DowntownLos Angeles . In that time , the nondenominational Christian charity has seen its clientele change from a small corps of elderly men down on their luck to a much larger and more troubled army of younger_men and women . The mission has come_to symbolize both civic_pride in its good deeds and civic shame in the social woes it illustrates , particularly the sidewalk encampments of people who want to be close to free meals . Its location next to the region ' s Roman_Catholic cathedral and a block from City_Hall gave the Union Rescue Mission special prominence . Now the city ' s oldest shelter for the homeless is moving from its cramped and run-down facility to a new $ 29-million building three times the size . While the shift is only seven blocks away to the epicenter of Skid_Row , it has been prefaced by a decade of debate about how best to help street people and where their congregating should be encouraged -- or discouraged . Its planners maintain that the new facility will offer so many humane benefits that the controversy over location will disappear . The five-story building comprises an eye-popping 235 # 000 square_feet , dwarfing nearly all such shelters in the nation , experts said . It can hold_up to 810 dormitory beds for transients and longer-term residents enrolled in substance_abuse recovery programs . Its kitchen can serve 2 # 000 meals a day . &quot; This is almost the supermarket of missions . It really represents state_of_the_art , &quot; said Robert Jacques , the project ' s design architect at the Nadel Partnership in West Los Angeles . &quot; We had to design it in such a way that it brought life and hope to people who are hopeless basically . So it had to look_like a flower , but be built like a tank. &quot; Warren Currie , Union Rescue ' s president , said : &quot; Our old facility was a one-lane road to help lead people out of Skid_Row . Our new one is a three-lane major highway. &quot; * But some nearby businesses and social_service providers are not anticipating the move so happily . They continue to question how physically concentrated shelters on Skid_Row should be , how competing property interests in Downtown can be balanced and whether public monies should aid a religious institution . Less openly discussed is whether the drug-ridden sidewalk encampments will follow the mission . Those uncertainties linger even as workers are putting final touches_on the L-shaped building , which has a contemporary , sculptural appearance and is painted cheery blue , green , brick-red and beige . It is located mid-block between 5th and 6th streets , with entrances on both San Pedro and San Julian streets . &quot; I think it ' s a good-looking building and will be a positive contribution to the neighborhood , &quot; said Don Spivack , director of operations for the city ' s Community Redevelopment Agency . &quot; Once they start operating , we ' ll see whether it works or not . As far as I can tell , it should. &quot; The redevelopment agency provided $ 6.5 million in public funds for the move and is expected to purchase the mission ' s old property for at least an additional $ 1.5 million . A city plan calls_for a plaza on that site next to St . Vibiana ' s Cathedral , along with housing and shops . Remaining construction costs for the new mission come from donations and bequests , including $ 11 million from a family that requested anonymity , Currie said . The building is named after Louis W . Foster , the founder of 20th Century Insurance Co. , and his wife , Gladyce . The Fosters and the company donated a total of $ 3 million . The first of several ceremonies marking the move will be a parade Sunday of Union Rescue employees , supporters and clients from the old to the new facilities . A public open_house tour is scheduled for noon Oct . 13 . Soon afterward , Union Rescue guests , as missionaries call homeless clients , will no longer spend the night on plastic lawn_chairs because of bed shortages . Women , an increasing presence on Skid_Row , for the first time will have an emergency dormitory and space in the rehabilitation_programs . Young and middle-aged men , who now outnumber elderly men among the homeless , will have a gymnasium with a full-length basketball_court . &quot; I got no complaints about living here , &quot; said Robert Arzate , a heavily tattooed 47-year-old who recently moved onto a bunk_bed in the old mission ' s crowded dormitory . &quot; After being_on the streets , anything is better . But I ' m looking_forward to the new place. &quot; Through the mission ' s prayer and work regimen , he is trying to kick the drug habit that landed him in state_prison and then on Skid_Row . The new building ' s most dramatic feature is a 400-seat chapel focused_on a towering cross-shaped window that leans over San Pedro Street . Other facilities include computer classrooms , a health clinic , a barber shop and beauty_salon , rooftop recreation areas and a hotel-style kitchen with four walk-in freezers to store donated food . The design also seeks to solve hygiene and security problems . It has easy-to-wash concrete floors , graffiti-resistant walls and surveillance booths in some dormitories and waiting rooms . The sexes are segregated in most circumstances . To eliminate hiding spots for drug use , many restrooms have no stall dividers . Dining room chairs are attached_to tables to prevent use as weapons . All that is a far_cry from the converted warehouses and armories that house many of the nation ' s shelters today . It is also vastly different from Union Rescue ' s origins as a gospel food wagon begun in 1891 by Lyman Stewart , who was the president of Union Oil Co . The mission settled in its current location in 1926 . The top two floors of the new building will not open right away because of funding shortfalls for furnishings and fixtures . Still , neighbors worry that free meals and the available 630 beds will attract too many people to an area already packed with facilities for the homeless . ( Union Rescue allows people not enrolled in its rehabilitation_programs to stay five days a month but does not restrict meals or showers. ) At 5th Street , just half a block away , is the Los Angeles Mission , another large and well-appointed Christian mission that opened two years ago . Across San Pedro at 6th Street is the Weingart Center , a high-rise complex of social and residential programs for the homeless . Newly built or renovated single-room-occupancy ( SRO ) hotels are adjacent on San Julian , as is a vest-pocket park where many homeless people pass the day . Other charitable agencies share nearby streets with wholesale toy and fish businesses . Also battling for turf are crack cocaine bazaars and cardboard box camp-outs . &quot; The neighborhood is very apprehensive , &quot; said Andy Raubeson , executive_director of SRO Housing Corp. , which operates neighboring hotels for low-income people . He and others are most concerned about crowding and crime on San Julian , a narrow roadway where the mission will have its main entrance for the homeless who want a meal , shower or bed . Union Rescue staff and residents in long-term programs will be able to enter on San Pedro . That dual entrance was designed under Community Redevelopment_Authority pressure to appease San Pedro Street businesses that had fought the new mission ' s location there , records show . Then , to calm operators of hotels along San Julian , a landscaped courtyard and indoor recreation_rooms were designed to draw people from the San Julian sidewalk and avoid big lineups . Mission president Currie promised to work with other agencies to improve Skid_Row safety and sanitation . The new courtyard , he said , will be &quot; as attractive as possible so people will want to come_in off the street and out of the sun. &quot; The compromise has made neither side very happy . &quot; It ' s just kind of an unknown at this point , &quot; said Tracey Lovejoy , spokeswoman for the Central_City East Assn. , which represents area businesses . The mission and the redevelopment agency &quot; have made a lot of promises and we can only take them at their word. &quot; Alice Callaghan , a leader of the Skid_Row Housing Trust , which also owns hotels , is pleased to have the new mission in the neighborhood . Yet she considers the San Julian entrance &quot; a nightmare &quot; that could make the street too unruly . &quot; It ' s amazing to me that the concerns of businesses to have as few poor people on San Pedro as possible was the highest priority , &quot; Callaghan said . The irony of such debate , mission leaders note , is that they did not want to move at first . More_than a decade ago , city officials began to advocate a neighborhood make-over near the cathedral , including construction of a now-open state office building a block away . Although some mission officials suspected that the city wanted to push homeless people out of the Civic Center , redevelopment officials insisted that services would improve if the mission moved to Skid_Row ' s center . The redevelopment agency originally offered to acquire land through eminent_domain and give it to the mission . That would have required Union Rescue to sign a pledge not to discriminate by religion in hiring staff . The mission balked , saying its independence could be violated . * After much haggling , the City_Council in 1989 approved a $ 6.5-million relocation grant and allowed the mission itself to buy land . The controversial pledge was dropped . Back at Main_Street , the city ' s Downtown Strategic Plan calls_for the demolition of the old mission and the creation of &quot; Plaza St . Vibiana , &quot; a pedestrian plaza and complex of low-rise housing and commercial structures south of the cathedral . The mission ' s move can &quot; really give St . Vibiana ' s another kind of presence in the Downtown as a great cultural institution itself , &quot; said USC architecture professor Robert Harris , an author of the strategic plan . Father Terry Fleming , the archdiocese chancellor , said it was premature to say if the cathedral would participate in the project . Asked if encampments near the cathedral will fold once the old mission closes , Fleming replied : &quot; I think that ' s a good assumption . The scenery doesn ' t draw them . It ' s not the beach or being close to City Hall. &quot; Meanwhile , excitement is mounting among Union Rescue staffers and residents . &quot; What makes this place special is that if a man really wants to get his life together , he can do_it here , &quot; said Walter Boone , 56 , who recently graduated from the mission ' s drug rehabilitation_program . &quot; The new building is very , very important and it will play a great role. &quot; A New Home After 68 years near the corner of Main and 2nd streets , the Union Rescue Mission is moving to a new building at the heart of Skid_Row . At its new location , the shelter and rehabilitation center will be next to other facilities for the homeless , including the Los Angeles Mission and the Weingart Center . 1 . St .
