   <TEXT> * In response to Keven Bellows ' column &quot; Here ' s Why Strawberry ' s Problem Is a Disease , Tom , &quot; Commentary , April 7 : I found her disagreement with Tommy Lasorda ' s statement to be over a minor semantic point that has no bearing on Lasorda ' s conclusions or actions . As a person also suffering from the disease of alcoholism , I believe its classification as a disease is important in deciding a course of action for the afflicted ( a disease gets medical treatment but I ' m not sure how to correct a moral weakness ) .However , having this disease does not in any way lessen Strawberry ' s responsibility for his actions nor should it mitigate the consequences . He can ' t help what he is , but he sure as hell can control what he does . Being an alcoholic no more justifies his irresponsibility than it would a death caused by a drunk driver . I would rephrase Lasorda ' s quote to &quot; How anyone could be dumb enough to take drugs , I cannot comprehend . I mean , it ' s crazy . . . I don ' t give_a_damn whether it ' s a disease. &quot; Bellows is right , sobriety is a challenge . I wish Strawberry the best of luck and God ' s help , but I don ' t think Lasorda and the Dodgers have to put_up with it . JOSEPH AREEDA Los Angeles * Despite Bellows ' protestations , Lasorda ' s comments on Strawberry ' s drug_abuse were 100 % correct . It is a weakness , not a disease . Sure , it ' s an addiction , but so is sugar , caffeine and tobacco . True , some may cause a stronger craving than others , but they can be overcome . Some , like alcoholism , may even be inherited . While we realize that many have an economic interest in promoting the &quot; disease-victim &quot; theory , this country cannot continue to excuse destructive behavior . PETE SNETSINGER Irvine</TEXT>
