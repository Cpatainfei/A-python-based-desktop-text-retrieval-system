   <HEADLINE> OPPOSITION WINS SEATS IN TUNIS VOTE ; ELECTIONS : PARTIES TAKE A LEGALLY ALLOCATED 19 SLOTS IN ASSEMBLY . PRESIDENT , WHO RAN UNOPPOSED , IS REELECTED IN LANDSLIDE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The political opposition gained a foothold in the National Assembly for the first time in this nation ' s post-colonial history , as President Zine Abidine ben Ali , running unopposed , won a huge mandate for his program of economic liberalization and clamping_down on Islamic fundamentalism . Official turnout was more_than 94 % as 2.9 million voters went_to the polls in the first election contested by opposition parties since Tunisia ' s independence from France in 1956 , authorities announced Monday . Ben Ali , whose war on religious fundamentalism has left Tunisia virtually immune from the political turbulence of its North African neighbors -- at the expense of thousands of arrests and restrictions on human_rights -- won endorsement from 99.91 % of the electorate . Parties from the political opposition took a legally allocated 19 seats in the National Assembly , their first edge into a government that has been dominated since independence by the ruling Constitutional Democratic Assembly . The legal opposition has been less adamant than Ben Ali in making overtures to the West , expressing support for fellow Arab states Iraq and Libya in their confrontations with America and Europe . Ben Ali has been a cornerstone of Western policy in the Middle_East , presenting one of the first prospects for Arab recognition of Israel , as Tunisia has permitted Israeli officials to come and go_through its capital in recent months in meetings with the Palestine Liberation Organization , headquartered in Tunis . Tunisia hosted the first multilateral peace talks between Arab states and Israel to be held_in an Arab country . Newspapers proclaimed the elections &quot; the Tunisian spring , &quot; but opposition leaders branded the polling a hypocrisy since no one ran against Ben Ali , who took power from the ailing Habib Bourguiba , Tunisia ' s onetime president for life , in 1987 . Moncef Marzouki , a prominent human_rights activist , had announced his candidacy for the presidency but was not permitted to run under regulations , which require nomination by 30 deputies of the National Assembly or regional councils . Ben Ali ' s party until now has held all 141 seats in the National Assembly ; it also controls all but one of Tunisia ' s municipal councils . Marzouki had sought a delay in the elections to change the rules but did not succeed . A second potential opponent , Abdel Rahman Hani , leader of a small nationalist party unrecognized by authorities , also announced his candidacy and challenged Ben Ali to a televised debate . But he was arrested and charged with forming an illegal association and spreading defamatory and false information . &quot; They can say whatever they please , but as far as we ' re concerned , these elections are a disgrace to the people of Tunisia , &quot; said Sayed Ferghani , a spokesman for the outlawed Islamic organization , Nahda , exiled in London . Tunisian officials have deliberately opted for a cautious approach toward democratization , watching the unhappy example of neighboring Algeria , where a full-blown legalization of political_parties and free elections led to a victory of Islamic fundamentalists and a subsequent military crackdown to set_aside the election results , perching the country on the verge of civil_war . Meanwhile , in Egypt , the blossoming of an Islamic fundamentalist movement has resulted in numerous attacks on foreign tourists , throwing the tourism industry into chaos and raising doubts about the future course of democratic reforms . Tunisia , despite some incidents of violence that included a purported plot to assassinate Ben Ali , has been a relative island of calm and prosperity in turbulent North Africa . It has focused_on economic liberalization , tourism and agricultural development . Most citizens seem to approve of Ben Ali ' s plans for development , even if the toll on human_rights for the fundamentalists has been high . Now seven years into a structural adjustment program designed to make the economy more market-oriented , growth has averaged 4.9 % over the last six years and inflation is low , though unemployment stands at 13 % .</TEXT>
