   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON : COMPANY TOWN ; SONY ' S ' INVISIBLE MAN ' SHOWS HIS FACE ; STUDIOS : ALAN J . LEVINE STEPS INTO THE LIMELIGHT , PROMPTING SPECULATION HE MAY SEEK TO SUCCEED GUBER AS CHAIRMAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At Sony Pictures Entertainment , Hollywood ' s most colorful and contentious studio , Alan J . Levine enjoys a remarkable degree of anonymity . The Sony president and chief operating officer has functioned so quietly during his five-year stint that colleagues privately refer to him as &quot; the invisible man. &quot; And even a close friend confesses , &quot; I ' m sorry , but I ' m not really sure what he does. &quot; that ' s shielded Levine from much of the criticism directed at Sony over the years for its financial performance and propensity for treating senior managers like temps . But it ' s also left him with an identity_crisis , which may explain why the 47-year-old executive is finally emerging from his silky cocoon inside Sony ' s famous Thalberg building to assume a higher profile . Levine recently joined colleagues in promoting to state lawmakers a report on Hollywood ' s contribution to the Southern California economy . He ' s also stepped_out in the media to defend Sony ' s image and his own achievements -- which has led to speculation that he ' s trying to better position himself to eventually succeed Sony Pictures Chairman Peter Guber . When that question is raised , Levine lives_up_to his reputation for being personally cautious and conservative . He sidesteps any mention of his goals -- saying &quot; the COO ' s role is to be the center_of_gravity . . . and a mediator &quot; -- but he is quick to challenge criticism of Sony . &quot; I think we ' ve done a very good job of building a strong company , &quot; he said . &quot; The headlines always have to do with the movies , but the scope of this business is much bigger than that. &quot; As evidence , Levine points to Sony ' s growing theatrical exhibition division and its new-media operations , the latter of which has recently started drawing spillover business from George Lucas ' Industrial Light &amp; Magic . Moreover , he says , Sony has a thriving video unit and potentially lucrative partnerships in the Latin American-based HBO Ole and Viva , a German music channel . Levine also contends that critics tend to ignore Sony ' s strong position in TV . With hits such_as &quot; Mad About You &quot; and &quot; Married . . . With Children , &quot; Columbia TriStar Television had operating profit of about $ 100 million in the last fiscal_year ended in March , according to sources . The group has also placed nine shows on the upcoming fall network schedule . Levine says technology will create even more opportunity for a company that , for now , certainly isn ' t setting the world on_fire financially . Sources have said the studio is a major money-loser for Sony Corp . The Tokyo-based conglomerate reported that Sony Pictures suffered a 7 % drop_in revenue , to $ 3.2 billion for the latest fiscal_year , which was attributed to movie losses and a lull in TV revenue . Overall pretax entertainment earnings , which include independently run Sony Music , fell to $ 646 million from $ 904 million . As the studio searches for its bearings , sources say Levine ' s most important contribution may be his role as a stabilizing presence . They also point_out that he enjoys a strong working partnership with the flashy , hyperactive Guber -- the polar opposite stylistically of Levine , who favors conservative business_suits and is known for his slavish devotion to golf . While Levine concentrates_on pure business issues , Guber focuses largely on the creative side . &quot; Alan has done a real good job of holding things together there through some real tough times , &quot; said one supporter . &quot; And in chaos , there ' s often opportunity . we ' ll see where he lands , but for now he ' s a real strong No . 2 guy. &quot; Adds Guber with his characteristic flair , &quot; Sometimes lightning only hits the lightning_rod . . . but that doesn ' t mean ( that Levine ) is less intrinsic to the operation. &quot; Levine joined the studio shortly after Sony Corp . purchased it for roughly $ 6 billion , counting debt , in 1989 . A former entertainment lawyer at Armstrong , Hirsch &amp; Levine -- where he was mentored by Hollywood power attorney Barry Hirsch -- Levine was given the Sony front-office job after negotiating for then-clients Guber and Jon Peters to become co-chairmen . In the years that followed , the three executives put the once-ailing studio back on the map by expanding its management ranks , pumping untold millions into high-priced talent deals and even embarking_on a massive renovation of the old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lot they took_over . But Sony ' s hopes of duplicating the Warner Bros . model of management stability and steady growth were foiled by unrelenting executive turmoil -- including the messy and expensive departures of Peters , Columbia Pictures Chairman Frank Price , TriStar Pictures Chairman Mike Medavoy and , most recently , motion_picture group President Jonathan Dolgen . In most of those cases , sources say , Levine played the hatchet_man , which opponents offer_up as further proof of his deceptively strong role at Sony . Levine ' s reputation as a tough_guy ( which he calls &quot; one-dimensional &quot; ) was sealed when he pushed Peters_out of the executive suite three years ago , following repeated clashes between the volatile producer and Sony Corp . executives . &quot; This guy did Jon , and Jon wasn ' t easy to do , &quot; says one Hollywood colleague . Levine also ran Sony ' s in-house investigation when company executives were linked to alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss last year in reports never substantiated . And it was Levine who led Sony ' s unsuccessful efforts to acquire hockey ' s Los Angeles Kings . Critics say he blew the deal that would have put Sony into the sports business by playing hardball with former Kings owner Bruce McNall . Others say Sony walked away from the deal when McNall ' s financial problems surfaced . In either case , Levine reportedly amassed even more power last spring after Dolgen left to run Paramount Pictures and other entertainment operations for Viacom Inc. Not everyone was pleased . He has been accused of contributing to Sony ' s diminished box_office presence by being too tightfisted with development and production money . &quot; He ' s basically a bean counter , &quot; said one source . &quot; And that slows the process down. &quot; But Guber says Levine possesses solid management skills , calling him &quot; a knowledgeable business person and one who has the faith and confidence of the employees of the company. &quot; Levine has other supporters outside the company . Castle Rock Entertainment Chairman Alan Horn , whose sat across the table from Levine when Sony ' s stake in Castle Rock was bought_out by Ted Turner , says , &quot; I really feel that Alan Levine is a fellow who understands our business. &quot; And former TriStar Chairman Medavoy calls him &quot; a bright , very quick study. &quot; Levine himself , whose contract runs_through 1998 , says most if not all_of the old raps against Sony will fade as it moves_into the future . He insists the company still has the strong support of its corporate parent and that it is fully financed for the future , even if no one takes it up_on its well-publicized effort to sell a 25 % stake in the operation . &quot; There is no question in our minds that our plan is_on track , and that does not include any type of issue regarding change of control or ownership , &quot; he said . &quot; We have always had all_the money and support we needed. &quot;</TEXT>
