   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : LIBRARIES PROVIDE INTERNET ACCESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ventura County has opened_up the information superhighway to all residents , providing computer links in library branches across the county . A few taps on the computer keys will bring_up information on agricultural exports , pro football schedules , NASA space lifts or weather_conditions anywhere in the world . Through the Internet system , the library will provide access to thousands of databases for federal , commercial , even sports information , said Ruth Hartman , adult services manager for the library system . The computers now are available in every library except the Saticoy branch , which is in temporary quarters , she said . Also , residents can tap into the network from home computers with the appropriate software and instructions from the library . The plan uses existing computers , leaving the library to pay about $ 2 # 000 this year to the company providing the Internet connection . The system could eventually include a &quot; county bulletin_board , &quot; providing information on meetings and new policies . County data processors are now studying ways to develop the computer information_system . &quot; We ' ve got_to determine whether the demand is there , what the needs are and how expensive it is going_to be , &quot; said George Mathews , director of the county ' s Information_Systems Department . For instance , the county clerk ' s office is assessing whether to put the Board of Supervisors ' weekly agenda on the computerized program . &quot; We only have 57 subscribers to this thing , plus the press , &quot; said County Clerk and Recorder Richard Dean , waving a copy of the agenda . &quot; Is there enough demand to make_it financially viable ? &quot; PHYLLIS W .
