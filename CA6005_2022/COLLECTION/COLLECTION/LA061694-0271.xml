   <HEADLINE> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COVER STORY ; BIG DESIGNS ON MOOOVING AHEAD ; IT ' S CALLED COW . AND FIRMS ARE LINING_UP TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE FOUR YOUNG FOUNDERS WHO GAINED ACCLAIM WITH AN INTERACTIVE ART CENTER CATALOGUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Funny how things change . Last year , they were four struggling art_students , waiting outside the doors of ad_agencies to show their portfolios . Then they spent six frenetic months of_their_own time creating an electronic catalogue for their school , Pasadena ' s prestigious Art Center College of Design , where they applied all_the design , graphics and computer skills they had learned in class . Their work impressed so many people that the Pasadena foursome decided to form a company to specialize in interactive design , an enterprise they christened with the whimsical name of COW . Today , with one of their team still in school , all but one under 30 and no professional contracts to their name , COW has already won a_couple_of awards and has several firms lined_up that are interested in doing business . To be sure , the company hasn ' t landed its first job yet , much less delivered on that job . But some of the people who award those contracts are expecting great things . &quot; I think they ' re really smart , really talented , and I would love to work with them , &quot; gushes Jonathan Wiedemann , executive producer of the new media division of Propaganda Films , the stylish Hollywood company whose top-notch directors and technicians have produced everything from Madonna music videos to David Lynch ' s &quot; Twin Peaks. &quot; Hundreds of small start-ups are vying for recognition in the field of interactive media , so-called because users navigate their way through a computer_program that prompts them for information about what they want to see . Electronic directories at malls and computer_games are familiar examples . But critics complain that much of the interactive media on the market today is confusing , boring or both , filled with large blocks of text , unappealing graphics and maze-like paths that leave users frustrated . By contrast , many of these same critics say that COW has brought_to the technology a sophisticated new level of design , learned at one of the top schools in the country . Industry mavens praise COW ' s style , which uses a lot of images and a minimum of text . Their program entices the user through a fast-moving blend of visuals , sound , type and graphics . The COW technique also uses film prominently , favoring herky-jerky off-center editing and hand-held cameras . Consider the interactive catalogue that the foursome did for the Art Center , which funded the cost of their supplies . The user starts learning about the school by sitting_down at a computer kiosk in the Art Center gallery and touching the screen to select from a menu of photo icons . Depending_on the icon chosen , the user is propelled through film , text , graphics and photos through the Art Center in Pasadena , the school ' s Switzerland campus , its colorful history or the creative vision of its president . Unlike some interactive programs , the team ' s design makes_it easy to switch from one path of inquiry to another . Another menu is overlaid in the background , where one touch brings it back into focus while the first one recedes . Users move through interviews with celebrated Art Center alumni , screen of student commercials or view prototypes of sports_cars designed in classes . COW ' s interactive program brings the Art Center to virtual life in a way that would require an all-day tour in real time . All that ' s missing is the smell of sage that grows amid the hillside campus ' sleek , modernistic buildings . &quot; They knocked my socks off , &quot; declares Jeannine Parker , president of the International Interactive Communications Society . &quot; I think they have an incredible future . They ' ve already separated themselves from the pack . It ' s not just how you present information , but how you give the user a way to navigate through it . They ' ve made_it much easier to navigate. &quot; Perhaps that is because of the blend of artistic background and computer literacy among the young entrepreneurs : Dina Temkin , 25 ( film and editing ) ; John Grotting , 28 , ( graphics ) , Bryan Dorsey , 25 , ( graphics and packaging ) and Mateo Neri , 31 ( graphics ) . The last three are Art Center graduates . Grotting just received his degree this month . Temkin graduates this September . Why the name COW ? &quot; Because things are too complicated today , and we wanted something simple that everyone would understand , because that ' s what we ' re trying to do with this media , that ' s our design philosophy , &quot; Dorsey says . In keeping with that , their logo is a toy wooden cow they assembled from children ' s building_blocks . Their office is in a California Craftsman house in Northwest Pasadena , which they like because it is funky , a far_cry from the sterility of a commercial office . It is also Grotting ' s home , and he tends to the group ' s meager cache of computer and video_equipment . For now they want to stay lean and mean . It ' s silly , they figure , to spend tons of money in a field where equipment and software becomes obsolete every six months . Ditto for hiring . COW anticipates assembling specialists in graphic design , film and editing as projects come their way . Among the core four , there is a loose and easy familiarity . They finish each others ' sentences , with one expanding on a creative idea tossed_out by another , such_as the potential for film imagery in interactive design . At brainstorming sessions they sit on the carpeted floor ; there are no chairs or desks . The &quot; grunge &quot; riffs of KROQ radio blast from a portable radio while herb_tea brews in the kitchen . All but Neri have earrings and long hair . After their success with the Art Center catalogue , they decided to form their own small creative shop . Grotting had taken a three-year break from school to work as an art_director at the international ad_agency DDB Needham in Finland and hated it . &quot; It wasn ' t creative . It was managing real big projects that were so mundane , &quot; he recalls . &quot; It ' s interesting , the bigger the budget , the lower the creativity. &quot; One of their first tasks is to draw_up a business plan , meeting with lawyers , figuring_out copyright laws and deciding which segment of the expanding interactive market they want to penetrate . COW partners say they like interactive games and music discs but their ambitions lie elsewhere . They want to design new ways of communicating in business and education , such_as kiosks that introduce new products or programs that teach students about World_War_II . &quot; We actually have in our biographies that we ' re not game makers . We ' re not hackers . We ' re not interested in a game that ' s going_to sell millions , &quot; Dorsey says . &quot; Games are not solving problems , they ' re just BS entertainment , and we ' re into solving problems . We want to develop tools that are going_to influence this medium. &quot; Grotting is the interface specialist , with a knack for designing ways for users to interact with the computer to get where they want . Last year , a computer interface designed by a group of Art Center students that included Grotting won first place in a competition sponsored by Apple Computer Inc. Already , COW has had an impact on the Art Center , says school President David R . Brown . After seeing the success of the interactive catalogue , the school set_up a &quot; digital sandbox &quot; for students to experiment with interactive media projects . &quot; They pointed_the_way , &quot; Brown says . &quot; It ' s going_to be very cool around here for awhile . We have an opportunity to become leaders in the education of design for interactive media. &quot; COW expects to sign_off shortly on its first professional contract , creating seven interactive kiosks for Nissan Motors that would introduce customers to their line of vehicles . The company also has made presentations to Celebrity Cruise Lines , PacifiCare health systems , Apple Computers , American Express and Propaganda Films . They have been profiled in Daily Variety and in Online Design . And they have been courted -- to no avail -- by ad_agencies and firms that would like to incorporate them into their stables of whiz kids , a hedge against future crashes on the &quot; information superhighway. &quot; &quot; They want us to educate them , &quot; Grotting says . &quot; They don ' t know what to do with the medium. &quot; COW has little interest in being swallowed ; its brain trust has other plans . A retired Art Center professor who ran a CPA firm for the entertainment_industry is so enthralled that he undertook to raise $ 1.5 million in capital for them through his Hollywood contacts . &quot; This is the epitome of Marshall McLuhan ' s ' the medium is the message ' ; it takes something static and makes_it dynamic , &quot; says Errol Gerson , who for 24 years taught business management to budding artists . &quot; The implications for corporate communications are staggering . I was so impressed with what they had done that I broke my rules , which are , one , never get involved with a start-up , and two , never get involved with students. &quot; Another who was wowed is Richard Cassey , an associate at SHR Perceptual Management , a marketing firm in Scottsdale , Ariz. , that works with auto_companies and cruise lines . Cassey researched interactive firms across the country and concluded that COW was &quot; one of the top two. &quot; He envisions hiring the group to design interactive kiosks for auto dealerships and travel_agencies . Interactive books are another possibility . &quot; COW was the one that really impressed us . They break_down the barriers of fear of the technology , &quot; Cassey says . &quot; Not many companies are doing that . Either they ' re very creative but the stuff doesn ' t flow , or they ' re very technologically oriented but not creative. &quot; One industry figure , while admitting he ' d like to lure the COW founders to his stable , says the Art Center students have yet to make the leap from small art_school boutique to big player in the interactive field . &quot; Until they land a major gig and produce something under real_world constraints and pressures , the jury ' s really still out , &quot; says the man , who requested anonymity . But Greg Thomas , an interactive media engineer with Apple Computer Inc. who has seen COW ' s work , believes the group has what it takes . He predicts there will be shakeout in the interactive field in the next 1 1 / 2 years and that COW will emerge strong . &quot; I was impressed . They have good design skills , and the way the market ' s going , we are always going_to have companies that need interactive presentations , &quot; Thomas said . COW ' s forays_into interactive media began in April , 1993 , when Dorsey had an idea to do an interactive yearbook with Neri . They were told Grotting would be essential to their team , so they enlisted his help . Kent Campbell , who has since left the group to work as creative director at another interactive company , signed_on as producer . Along the way they hooked_up_with Temkin , whose film and photography skills brought visual punch to their designs . But the group opted to pitch the idea of an interactive college catalogue to Brown , the Art Center president , instead of a yearbook because they knew it would be an easier sell -- most students would n ' t shell_out the money or have the equipment for a CD-ROM yearbook . Brown gave them an office , a $ 20 # 000 budget and free run of high-tech facilities for editing , photography and computers . The students even commissioned product design students Todd Bell and Bobby Chang to create the sleek wood-and-steel kiosk for the catalogue and hired others to do the music . Grotting estimates that the interactive kiosk would have cost about $ 400 # 000 if students hadn ' t labored for free using equipment and labs provided by the school . They worked six months , using volunteer student film crews , raiding the archives , sleeping on couches in the office after 18-hour days . The interactive catalogue , which later won a Design Distinction Award in Graphics from the 1994 Annual Design Review , was unveiled late last year at a design and media conference in Kitakyushu , Japan , a city that is gunning to be the interactive media capital in the 21st Century . Brown says a headline in the local Japanese paper the next day read : &quot; He touched the screen and the audience went ' Wow. ' &quot;</TEXT>
