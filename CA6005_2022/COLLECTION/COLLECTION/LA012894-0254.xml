   <HEADLINE> JIM MURRAY : THE COACH AND THE DIPLOMAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nobody has been able to figure_out why Marv Levy is a football_coach except he ' s good at it . Jimmy Johnson couldn ' t be anything else but . Marv Levy reads Dickens and Shakespeare . Jimmy Johnson never read anything in his life that didn ' t have X ' s and O ' s in it , and dotted lines . Marv Levy is a very modest man , grateful to be coach of the Bills . Jimmy Johnson thinks the Cowboys are lucky to have him . They probably are . Marv Levy is a good coach . Jimmy Johnson may be a great one . Marv Levy runs a football_team the way Plato might . Jimmy Johnson runs one the way Jesse James might . You know how football_coaches as a class are . The season opens , they say , &quot; We may_not make a first down. &quot; They have 90 of the finest athletes on the planet under their command , but they tell the world they have their work cut_out for them . Not Johnson . He goes_into the most important football game of the season and announces his team is going_to kick the San Francisco 49ers ' butts . Calls_up a radio_station personally to make_sure they get the message . &quot; It won ' t even be close , &quot; he vows . It is such a shocking breach of the coaches ' oath that the world figures Jimmy Johnson has become suicidal . Not at all . He just wants his players to know he has confidence in them . &quot; I ' m a little different from your clone coach , &quot; Johnson boasts . &quot; If you want a clone coach who gets_up here and says the same thing every day , just get yourself a cutout and a tape_recording . But I ' d rather hear good questions . I ' d rather have something to say. &quot; Levy ' s game_plan might be likened to a symphony , Johnson ' s to gangsta rap . Levy tends to respect experience . Johnson prefers speed , which comes_in the young . His teams are a blur . Two times , they ran_down San Francisco ' s Steve Young from behind . Once , they even ran_down Ricky Watters from behind . Now , that is speed . And sometimes they were defensive linemen , troglodytic in appearance but trackable only by radar when the ball is snapped . Levy wants to stay_at Buffalo forever . &quot; Amos Alonzo Stagg coached till he was 90 , &quot; he reminds you . &quot; You can stay young and coach forever. &quot; Johnson never heard of Amos Alonzo Stagg . But he admits , &quot; I get a little antsy , I get a little bored . I want a new challenge . I felt if I stayed_at ( the University of ) Miami , I could have won a couple more national championships . But I wanted to take another challenge. &quot; He may be looking_for yet another . He allowed as how he might like the challenge of an expansion team at Jacksonville . But owner Jerry Jones reminded him he had a 10-year contract with five years left . Levy ' s relationship with his owner , Ralph Wilson , is comfortable , non-obtrusive . Johnson and Jerry Jones were perceived by the public as joined at the hip , ex-college buddies who played_on the same Arkansas team . Jones bought the team for Johnson , or so the story went . The notion peeves Johnson . &quot; Just like I ' m a little different from your clone coach , he ' s different from your clone owner , &quot; he says of Jones . &quot; But people have this misconception we spend all our time together , an hour or two a day together . But , I ' m a 5 o ' clock_in the morning guy . I ' m also a 10 o ' clock_in the night guy . That leaves about two hours a day we even could get_together ! &quot; ( Laughter. ) Not even the owner escapes the Johnson rag . Levy takes the position his scouting staff brings him outstanding football_players . Johnson figures he can evaluate football talent on the hoof as well as anyone in the game . &quot; We got guys on an hourly wage to look_at film , &quot; he says . &quot; We don ' t give ' em names , we just give ' em numbers -- so they won ' t be influenced by preconceived notions or reputations . They watch performance , not stars . We don ' t tell them whether it ' s Charlie Ward or some backup. &quot; Johnson wants you to know he was undone once by reputation . &quot; We ( Miami ) lost the Fiesta Bowl ( to Penn State ) . We ran_up 450 yards to their 150 or 200 , but we had a quarterback who had been injured and he didn ' t have enough preparation and he threw three interceptions . But I would n ' t pull him because he was a Heisman Trophy winner . We lost. &quot; So_much for Heisman Trophy winners and other underachievers . &quot; You make a mistake when you let your heart make the picks , &quot; he warns . &quot; I got Alonzo Highsmith with my heart. &quot; There are those who think Johnson ' s heart is easy to overlook , that he does_it all_the time . But Johnson bristles_at the notion that the Herschel Walker trade to Minnesota for a passel of draft picks &quot; made &quot; the Cowboys . &quot; It ' s what you do with the picks that counts , &quot; he says . &quot; The Rams got a whole mess of them in the ( Eric ) Dickerson trade . If you pick_up a bunch of schmoes , it doesn ' t do you much good. &quot; Johnson hints that he picked_up a bunch of all-pros , not all-schmoes . &quot; Besides , we made probably 40 or 50 ( other ) trades to build the team , &quot; he says defensively . The Dallas Cowboys have had two coaches in their history -- the legendary Tom Landry and Johnson . Under Landry , they became &quot; America ' s team. &quot; There is some question Johnson wants to share the billing . They are Jimmy Johnson ' s team . Does Johnson want to be a legend ? &quot; Naw , I ' m not into that , &quot; says the non-legend . &quot; I ' m not trying to make a mark on history . I ' m not into longevity . But I ' m a very miserable person if I don ' t achieve what I set_out to do. &quot; Levy probably doesn ' t want to become a legend , either . He coached at Cal , about as far from being a football factory as you can get , west of Harvard . Johnson coached at Miami , about as close to being a football factory as you can get , football ' s version of the Dirty Dozen . Levy won eight games in three years at Cal . Johnson won 52 games in five years at Miami . Levy has lost three Super Bowls . Johnson has never lost any . Levy is gracious in defeat . Johnson is not particularly gracious even in victory . He has no patience with small_talk , which he takes_to mean any talk not including football . &quot; I don ' t want to go_to some dinner_party and have some lady in a bouffant hairdo lean over and ask me what a quarterback is , &quot; he grumbles . Talk football or shut_up . Johnson is not predicting victory Sunday . He probably thinks it ' s unnecessary . When asked if his team might suffer from overconfidence , given the outcome of last year ' s game , he frowned . &quot; Overconfidence is not a bad thing in football , &quot; he said . &quot; As long as it doesn ' t boil_over into complacency , where you think you ' re so good you don ' t need preparation . Underconfidence is worse . &quot; Levy , of course , doesn ' t have to worry about overconfidence .</TEXT>
