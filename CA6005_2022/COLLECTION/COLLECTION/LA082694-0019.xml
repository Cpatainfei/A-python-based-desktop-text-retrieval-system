   <HEADLINE> MISSION OF MERCI ; AMERICAN , FRENCH VETS OF WORLD_WAR_II ARE REUNITED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fifty years to the day since Paris was liberated from the Nazis , an American and a Frenchman who fought side_by_side in the_French Resistance were reunited Thursday in Los Angeles . Arlie Blood and Jean le Brix exchanged kisses on the cheek , swapped war stories and complimented each other on surviving to 1994 ( &quot; I ' m 73 , but I only look 72 , &quot; cracked le Brix ) -- and on surviving 1944 . &quot; There aren ' t words to describe it , but I will say he ' s a very brave man , &quot; said Blood , 78 . &quot; The hero is not me , but him , &quot; replied le Brix . Thursday ' s meeting underscores the little-known role that Americans played in the_French Resistance , according to officials of the local French consulate who helped reunite the pair . Dozens of American airmen shot down over France by Nazi artillery were turned_into guerrilla-style fighters after parachuting to the ground and being rescued by Resistance members . that ' s how the saga of Blood and &quot; Barnaby &quot; began in the late spring of 1944 . Barnaby was le Brix ' s code name in the Resistance : None of the freedom fighters used their real names for fear that they might be identified if other Resistance members were caught and tortured by the Nazis . Blood met Barnaby after his P-47 Thunderbolt fighter was shot down while attacking a German ammunition train . He bailed_out and hid in a wheat field until a young_girl carrying bread , a bottle of wine and a French-English dictionary came_to his aid and summoned Resistance members . They took Blood in and introduced him to le Brix . &quot; He could speak a little English , so I latched onto him , &quot; Blood explained . Soon , the pair were staging nighttime commando raids together . Barnaby ' s knowledge of the terrain and German positions helped keep Blood safe during the month that the pair sneaked past Nazi patrols to blow_up railroad_tracks and bridges used by German invaders . The one time that Blood didn ' t follow Barnaby ' s advice , he ended_up getting captured by the Nazis . As American forces advanced after the D-day invasion , Blood declined Barnaby ' s offer to personally lead him to U.S. troops . Instead , he hitched a ride with two Frenchmen who soon found themselves stopped at gunpoint at a German roadblock . The Nazis executed the two Frenchmen and took Blood into custody . Barnaby assumed the worst about Blood too . &quot; For 50 years I thought he had been killed , &quot; le Brix said . &quot; I thought he was dead. &quot; Blood managed to escape German detention the next month . He joined another Resistance group and later was part of a five-man squad that managed to liberate the_French towns of Losche and Tours a_few days before American soldiers arrived . After the war , Blood continued in the Air_Force , eventually working as a colonel in the Pentagon and later as an executive for Northrop in Los Angeles . Le Brix returned to Brest , where he worked until his retirement as a regional government administrator . Le Brix said he traveled_to Los Angeles on vacation 15 years ago without realizing his old war buddy was living_in Palos Verdes . Blood traveled_to France on vacation in 1984 and spent days looking_for Barnaby . But he said he came_up empty-handed because he only knew the code name . * The mystery was unraveled after Blood learned that the local French consulate was planning a mock invasion of Santa Monica State Beach on June 6 to commemorate D-day . He asked cultural_attache Gerard Loiseaux if he would help find Barnaby . Intrigued , Loiseaux said yes . &quot; I put an article in a Brittany paper about Blood and Barnaby and contacted some Resistance veterans associations , &quot; Loiseaux said . Soon , Barnaby ' s true identity was known . Thursday ' s reunion , staged at the Wiesenthal Center in West Los Angeles , came_after le Brix and his wife , Suzanne , arrived with friends Gerard and Yvonne Deschartres . They are visiting the Deschartres ' daughter Nathalie , a Santa Monica video_game producer . Blood and his wife , Lucille , who now live_in Canyon Lake in Riverside County , plan to visit the le Brixes next June . Barnaby has promised to take him to the two Frenchmen ' s grave -- and to meet the woman who gave him bread and wine 50 years ago . &quot; There are many heroes , &quot; Blood said .</TEXT>
