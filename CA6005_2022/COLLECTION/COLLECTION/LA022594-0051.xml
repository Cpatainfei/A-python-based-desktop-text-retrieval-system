   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; FOR THIS ITALIAN STAR , IT ' S NO CONTEST ; SKIING : ONE DAY AFTER TOMBA STUMBLES , COMPAGNONI EASILY WINS WOMEN ' S GIANT SLALOM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ten minutes after winning the gold medal in Thursday ' s giant slalom , Italy ' s Deborah Compagnoni took the customary phone_call of congratulations from a dignitary . In America , the President usually handles the task . Bill_Clinton phoned Tommy Moe after his downhill victory last week . Compagnoni picked_up Line 1 in the finish-area corral after dominating both runs and defeating runner-up Martina Ertl of Germany by 1.22 seconds . Compagnoni ' s two-run time of 2:30.97 was two seconds faster than Switzerland ' s Vreni Schneider , who took the bronze . Eva Twardokens , sixth , was the top American finisher . Hello ? &quot; Tomba here , &quot; Alberto Tomba said . The conversation between the king and queen of Italian skiing was brief . &quot; He was very happy , &quot; Compagnoni said . &quot; Yes , we will celebrate together . But I said we would also celebrate the medal you will make. &quot; Tomba , a three-time Olympic gold medalist , has struck_out once here , in Wednesday ' s giant slalom , but will be among the favorites in Sunday ' s slalom . Though reportedly not romantically involved , the link-up between Tomba and Compagnoni , even if it was only through the magic of fiber-optics , rekindled memories of Feb . 18 , 1992 , the date both skiers won gold . It was so momentous an occasion that , for the first time in anyone ' s recollection , soccer was bumped to the inside pages of Italian sports sections . At face_value , the 23-year-old Compagnoni ' s return to the Olympic podium two years after winning the Albertville super-G would seem a natural progression , the superstar expanding her skiing horizons . Yet , this was not merely a matter of connecting the Olympic dots . The day after her gold-medal run at Albertville , Compagnoni crashed in the giant slalom and tore left knee ligaments . It took a year for her to recover , another year to reclaim Olympic form . Safe to say , she ' s back . In boxing vernacular , Compagnoni scored a knockout . She recorded the fastest time on the morning course : a tight , technical gate-set that bounced Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden , the defending Olympic champion , out of the race and prompted American Heidi Voelker , a reputed medal contender , to ski timidly . Voelker stood 18th after the first run , a whopping 2.71 seconds off the pace . Compagnoni , with a 0.63-second first-run cushion over her nearest challenger , oversaw the second run with understandable confidence . &quot; I knew I would win , &quot; she said . Germany ' s Ertl , skiing 11th , took the lead and held it through three more racers , but she knew Compagnoni had nearly a full-second advantage on her before she stepped_out of the starting_gate . &quot; I knew if she had no mistakes in her second run , that I cannot win , &quot; Ertl said . Germany ' s Hilde Gerg , with the second fastest first-run time , had a fast second run going before she crashed , four gates from the finish . Up next , Compagnoni didn ' t ski like someone trying to protect a lead . In fact , she nearly lost everything when she lost her balance in a troublesome area near the bottom as Italian fans gasped . But she recovered in time . U.S. medal hopes were dashed early and often with poor first runs . Twardokens , 13th in the morning , welcomed a straighter second-run course that allowed her to take_advantage of her speed . She moved_up seven spots and took_home a credible Olympic finish . &quot; I don ' t think I broke 20 clicks ( kilometers per hour ) , &quot; she said of her first run . &quot; The second run , I had nothing to lose. &quot; The United States has placed at least one skier in the top 10 in each Olympic Alpine event . Yet , after winning four medals last week , Americans have developed a craving for the podium . &quot; People came_up_to me and said , ' You ' re next , ' &quot; Twardokens said . &quot; And I ' d say , ' It ' s not that easy. ' I thought maybe it could happen to me . But sometimes you can get unrealistic . I think I lost some focus. &quot; Twardokens , 28 , added a sixth to her seventh- and eighth-place finishes at Albertville two years ago . Diann Roffe-Steinrotter -- a surprise gold-medal winner in super-G last week and the defending Olympic silver medalist in the giant slalom -- could barely get_out of the gate because of flu . She was 27th after her first run and was too ill to compete in the afternoon . Voelker followed up her miserable first run_by crashing head-first into the snow on her second , an embarrassment referred to in skier talk as &quot; a face plant. &quot; The warm support Voelker received from relatives in_attendance did not soothe her disappointment . &quot; Sometimes hugs make_it all_the worse , &quot; Voelker said . She began the Games red-hot , with top-10 finishes in her last five World Cup races . &quot; She choked , &quot; Paul Major , the U.S. Alpine director , said . &quot; She knew it . She felt that way too . But she ' s also had_the_best season of her career. &quot;</TEXT>
