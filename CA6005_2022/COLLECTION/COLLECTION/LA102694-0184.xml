   <HEADLINE> VERDICTS BRING BIEHL FAMILY SENSE OF RELIEF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nine hours after the first television_news crew woke him at 3:30 a.m. Tuesday , Peter Biehl finally cried . The father of Fulbright scholar Amy Biehl , who was stoned and stabbed to death by a mob in South_Africa last year , nearly succeeded in keeping his composure as he spoke_to a string of reporters about the three guilty verdicts handed_down Tuesday half a world away . But after laughing_at stories of his daughter ' s life in college , reliving the family ' s experiences in South_Africa and breathing relief over the sense of closure brought by the murder_convictions , Peter Biehl and his 28-year-old daughter , Kimberly , became subdued . Both said the verdicts will never erase the image of Amy Biehl ' s bloody death . &quot; I still can ' t deal with the violence , the violence that happened to her , &quot; Kimberly Biehl said . &quot; I can ' t read about it . I can ' t think_about it . It destroys me for the rest of the day. &quot; Peter Biehl , nestled in the corner of a brown couch , took a deep sigh and wiped_away tears behind his eyeglasses . &quot; Going_to the site of her death was difficult , &quot; he said . &quot; The other thing is the certain knowledge we ' ll never see Amy again . &quot; The hardest thing for a parent is losing a child -- and the fact that she died so far away . If only we ' d been there , just to hold her. &quot; Amy Biehl , who was in Guguletu township outside Cape_Town helping to develop a voter registration program , was stoned and stabbed to death while driving friends home on Aug . 25 , 1993 . The killing -- one of the first among slayings of foreigners during pre-election violence in South_Africa -- occurred only days before she was to return home to pursue a doctoral degree . According to police accounts , Amy Biehl was driving her Mazda when a brick smashed through its windshield . Screaming , &quot; One settler , one bullet ! &quot; a group of youths pulled her from the car and beat her . Mongezi Manquina , 22 , Mzikhona Nofemela , 19 , and Vusumzi Ntamo , 21 , members of the militant Pan Africanist Student Organization , were among a group of seven young_men arrested in the days following Biehl ' s death . Charges against three of the youths were dropped when a witness refused to testify . A fourth defendant , a juvenile , still awaits trial . The prosecutor in the case immediately sought the death_penalty after Judge Gerald Friedman handed_down the guilty verdicts Tuesday . But a defense_lawyer asked_for leniency because of the young_men ' s living conditions under apartheid and the highly charged political climate . Amy Biehl ' s family believes her attackers should not be given the death_penalty when they are sentenced , possibly today . Linda Biehl said her daughter was opposed to capital_punishment . &quot; I don ' t feel in this case more death is going_to help anything , &quot; Linda Biehl said . &quot; Yet I did not sense remorse in ( the convicted killers ) at all . I would hope they would eventually feel some . . . &quot; she paused , choosing her words carefully , &quot; understanding and guilt. &quot; Zachary Biehl , Amy ' s 17-year-old brother , added : &quot; I think they should definitely be put_away for a long time. &quot; People &quot; can ' t blame three individuals for the huge problems they ' ve had there &quot; in South_Africa , Zachary Biehl said . &quot; Apartheid and inequity built_up a lot of the anger . You have to consider that. &quot; Since the slaying , the Biehls have learned more about South_Africa and its people than they previously understood from headlines about elections and apartheid . Photos in a thick album on their coffee_table show Zachary and daughters Kimberly and Molly , 24 , surrounded by local children at squatters ' camps . Linda Biehl recalled the moment when she first stood at the site where her daughter was stoned and stabbed . &quot; A strong woman grabbed me and said : ' Mama ! Mama Biehl ! ' &quot; she remembered . &quot; She just grabbed me with a passion and emotion and needed to recite her grief to me . &quot; I never even knew her name , and she was gone. &quot; The Biehls have established the Amy Biehl Fund to help finance grass-roots projects , mostly in South_Africa , such_as those in which their daughter participated before her death . In the future , they hope to hold more fund-raising events for the foundation . Proceeds from a possible film or book about Amy Biehl ' s life would go_to the fund , they said . Family members said they hoped the trial would offer South_Africa an opportunity to show the world and its own citizens that its justice system can work . &quot; In a sense , this is a small milestone for South_Africa , &quot; Peter Biehl said . &quot; I would n ' t like to think it ' s just a verdict for Amy , &quot; Linda Biehl added , &quot; but for all_the others who ' ve lost their lives working toward democracy there . This group of people that did this to Amy , this group was not the soul of South Africa. &quot;</TEXT>
