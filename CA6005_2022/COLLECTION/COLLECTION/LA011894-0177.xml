   <TEXT> Bosnian Serb leaders threatened Monday to unleash &quot; all-out war &quot; against the Muslim-led government if coming peace talks end without agreement . &quot; This round of negotiations will mark a definite turning point , &quot; Radovan Karadzic , leader of the self-proclaimed Serbian state in Bosnia-Herzegovina , told a Serbian assembly . &quot; If it becomes clear there will be no peace , we shall have to prepare_for all-out war , &quot; said Karadzic , adding that the Serbs would launch an offensive to capture about 20 % of the land now held by the government . The heavily armed Serbs currently hold 70 % of Bosnia after 21 months of war , while the government holds about 15 % and Croats hold the rest .</TEXT>
