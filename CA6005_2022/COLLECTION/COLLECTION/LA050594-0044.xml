   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; SOCIAL STUDIES ; SCIENTIST SIMON LEVAY HEADS NEW COLLEGE THAT EXPLORES CONTRIBUTIONS OF GAY COMMUNITY -- NOW ALL HE NEEDS IS A BUILDING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was 1991 , and scientist Simon LeVay was riding a rocket . His stunning discovery of differences between the brains of gay and straight_men had propelled him from the obscurity of the laboratory to the news pages and talk_shows -- a potent new spokesman for the belief that some people simply are born gay . Colleagues at the prestigious Salk Institute in La Jolla cheered him as a hero . At gay bars , strangers offered to buy him drinks . The federal_government stood_by with half a_million dollars in research money . Friends awaited his next move . Tom Albright , a neurobiologist and LeVay ' s closest friend at Salk , said : &quot; All of us were curious about where he was going_to take this. &quot; LeVay surprised them all . He has ditched the laboratory and , from a makeshift office lent by the city of West Hollywood , is carrying_out his boldest experiment so far . It is the upstart Institute of Gay and Lesbian Education , a one-of-a-kind night college where up_to 200 gays and lesbians learn about a homosexual culture that has been as closeted as_many of the students themselves once were . What began in 1992 as a year ' s leave_of_absence from Salk to found IGLE with former West Hollywood planner Chris Patrouch has turned_into a vastly new life for the 50-year-old LeVay . He has swapped scientific dispassion for social activism -- in the process , trading a reliable flow of research funding for an unpaid job and a trickle of $ 195 tuition checks . His office_staff is an answering machine set_up in the back_room of the city building . In LeVay ' s new life , a major discovery would be finding a home for the school . Once preoccupied with unlocking secrets of the mind , he now concerns himself with whether the Tuesday night gay literature class can get_into its borrowed room in City_Hall . LeVay is also adjusting to the public role thrust on him after the brain discovery turned the shy scientist into an instant gay celebrity . He is still not good with names or faces and sometimes worries that he may have cost the school support by not remembering people he should have . &quot; It ' s been a lot more of an experiment , a lot more adventurous than stuff I ' ve done_in the past , &quot; said LeVay , his soft British accent intact after two decades in the United States . &quot; For most of my life I ' ve been buried in back_rooms . This job has been so interactive socially. &quot; You have to know some things about LeVay ' s past to understand such a turnabout . LeVay , who says he first knew he was gay at 13 , was in his adult life anything but a gay rights advocate . He and his longtime lover , Richard , lived away from San Diego ' s gay neighborhoods and attended gay pride parades once a year . &quot; That was the measure of my involvement in the gay community , &quot; LeVay said . * Then Richard became sick with AIDS and LeVay took a year off from Salk to care_for him . Richard died in 1990 . After that , said friend and UC San Diego researcher Don MacLeod , &quot; a lot of things changed &quot; for LeVay . He returned to Salk , where he was known as a top-notch specialist on the brain ' s role in vision . But instead of continuing his work , he turned his attention in the laboratory to an entirely new area for him -- the question of sexual orientation . Friends said he opened_up more about his own homosexuality . &quot; I developed a sense of wanting to do something more with my life than I was doing before , &quot; LeVay said . But he was not ready for the reaction to his discovery that a tiny piece of the brain linked to sexual_activity is smaller in gay_men than in straight_men . The finding -- the first evidence of a biological cause for homosexuality -- tossed gasoline on the raging debate on whether homosexuality is a matter of choice . LeVay was suddenly a nationally known champion of so many people who , like himself , had long believed they were born gay . Patrouch , the West Hollywood planner , met LeVay at a meeting of a gay political group in 1991 and mentioned his idea for a gay university in West Hollywood , the center of gay social life in the Los Angeles area . LeVay loved the idea . Weary of growing administrative demands on him at Salk , LeVay threw his newfound celebrity behind the college , which he and Patrouch first planned to name Harvey Milk University , after the slain San Francisco supervisor revered by many gays . &quot; This was like a second coming_out -- at least a much more public thing than I was used to , &quot; said LeVay . The two men got permission to use city rooms for IGLE classes and in 1992 opened the school that everyone now simply calls &quot; Iggle. &quot; Nearing the end of its fourth semester , the institute remains ever the experiment , surviving on a shoestring and the sweat of a_few volunteers . It has attracted a devoted core of students to classes in gay psychology and fiction writing , and has hosted popular workshops and field trips exploring everything from earthquake faults to lesbian sea_gulls . The Whitman-Brooks Foundation helped IGLE raise $ 4 # 500 for scholarships . Still , progress is measured in wobbly baby steps . The school is not accredited and does not yet offer degrees . Enrollment had been climbing before it dipped this spring to a low of 50 -- a drop LeVay attributes to disruptions caused by the Northridge earthquake . Although LeVay had hoped for a 50-course curriculum , only five to 10 of the 12-week classes have typically been offered . The school has no building of its own ; rooms for classes are borrowed from hotels , other groups and the city . LeVay and IGLE board_member Amy Ryan are what passes for an administration , responsible_for everything from dreaming_up classes to licking stamps . The school marks LeVay ' s passage from scientist to gay activist . Though he still lectures and included his brain research in his 1993 book &quot; The Sexual Brain , &quot; he has effectively bowed_out of the laboratory investigations into whether sexual orientation has biological causes . Instead , he is co-writing a book on gay culture with Elisabeth Nonas , a lesbian novelist who teaches writing at IGLE . And more_than anything else , he is consumed with getting IGLE off the ground . LeVay sees the humble school as nothing less than an engine for social change -- a place &quot; to make gays and lesbians into better ambassadors for the community. &quot; If straight people do not think they know any gays , LeVay said between sips of Earl Grey tea , &quot; it ' s our fault. &quot; Supporters say IGLE has created a haven where the spotlight is_on the contributions of homosexuals and students need not fear what they reveal to classmates . &quot; A lot of it has to do with validation and erasing the subtle message that mainstream education gives that homosexuality shouldn ' t be talked_about and that we ' re different from ' normal ' people , &quot; said Tom Chatt , 32 , a software_engineer who has taken IGLE classes in ethics , European film , psychology and , now , gay literature . &quot; It ' s the same reason people want to see gay and lesbian characters on TV. &quot; Chatt said : &quot; If you want to have a gay community , it ' s important that it ' s more_than just bars and a yearly parade. &quot; The school ' s unique slant shows_up in a course called &quot; Gay and Lesbian Self-Identity Through Literature. &quot; Here , it is not controversial to assert that Shakespeare ' s sonnets were written to a young_man or Emily Dickinson ' s love poems to her sister-in-law . In one class recently , instructor Luke Johnson , who holds a Ph.D. in literature from UCLA , urged his students to mine for gay meanings in various works that make no mention of homosexuality . The six students were assigned an Oscar Wilde story in which two male friends -- one of whom eventually kills himself -- are obsessed with finding_out the true identity of the person to whom Shakespeare wrote the sonnets . Johnson wants to know what Wilde , imprisoned for homosexuality in the 1890s , may have been saying about his own identity . &quot; What did he think it was to be what we call a gay_man ? &quot; asks Johnson . &quot; What are gay_men like ? &quot; &quot; Prone to suicide , &quot; answers one student . &quot; Artistic . Intellectual . Passionate , &quot; offers another . There is symbolism in exploring homoerotic themes in the sonnets , Johnson tells the class . &quot; They ' re a puzzle and a mystery and their meaning is hidden to us , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s something about being a gay_man that makes you attracted to secrets , to unlocking secrets and sort of good at keeping secrets. &quot; One of society ' s best-kept secrets , LeVay laments later , is just how many important literary figures were homosexuals . &quot; Gay people don ' t even know that stuff , &quot; he said . &quot; They just don ' t ever learn it. &quot; Not all_the classes deal with gay topics . The school has offered math and French -- producing smirks among observers who say gays do not need a special school for such subjects -- and may soon provide computer training . There was not a single mention of gay themes during a recent 90-minute writing session led by novelist Nonas . But IGLE backers say it is important to have a &quot; gay-friendly &quot; setting , even when the topic is not gay . &quot; I don ' t want to have to defend my choice of the way I live my life while I ' m trying to write poetry , &quot; said Ryan , a chemist who has taken two classes . The next step for LeVay and his infant_school may be the hardest . Having found a loyal but small following as an informal adult school , IGLE must decide what it will grow_up to be . LeVay and some_other board_members favor taking the plunge and creating a formal degree_program , perhaps only for graduate_students . There has been some talk_of linking up with another local school . But organizers are also nervous about giving_up an open-door approach that puts a premium on community participation over academic rigor . &quot; We don ' t want to abandon the students we have now , &quot; said board of directors member Debbi Winter . And the school has never fully settled an identity_crisis it was born with : whether it should concentrate_on teaching gay and lesbian studies or simply teaching conventional subjects_to gay and lesbian students . Even those in the gay community who are aware of the school say they are not sure exactly what it does . &quot; We really don ' t have a clear idea of what ' s going_to make us distinct and what ' s going_to make people come_to us rather than Santa Monica College or UCLA , &quot; said co-founder Patrouch , who now spends his time tending a new store in West Hollywood called Urban Inversion . &quot; The question of where we ' re going is still very much alive. &quot; Bigger plans mean bigger annual budgets . LeVay figures the school will have to raise at least $ 200 # 000 -- three times last year ' s budget -- to hire a full-time administrator and maybe land a permanent site for the school . LeVay smiles at the thought of being finally able to put_up a sign for the Institute of Gay and Lesbian Education , marking for its students and the outside world this curious little project for which he gave_up a career . &quot; To have a little shingle out there , &quot; he said , &quot; even that would be a triumph. &quot;</TEXT>
