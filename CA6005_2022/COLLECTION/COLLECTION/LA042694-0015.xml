   <HEADLINE> DON ' T ASK GORAZDE TO SURRENDER ; BOSNIA : THE SERBS DON ' T WANT ONLY THE TERRITORY ; THEY WANT IT ' CLEANSED. ' REALPOLITIK WOULD OFFER PEACE WITHOUT SECURITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The rape of the Bosnian &quot; safe haven &quot; town of Gorazde has come as grim vindication for those who have urged the view that the Bosnian Serbs have won , the Bosnian Muslims have lost and further resistance is futile . Columnist Jim Hoagland spoke_for many , particularly in the diplomatic community , when he argued last week &quot; for Clinton ' s joining the Europeans in a Realpolitik solution of accepting the Serb victory in Bosnia and shutting this war down now . That in turn means dropping the smoke-screen talk_of lifting the arms embargo while negotiating the best surrender terms possible for the vanquished Bosnian Muslims. &quot; Hoagland deserves credit for using the word surrender . Too few have . But can official Bosnia-Herzegovina -- heavily but by no means entirely Muslim -- afford to surrender ? The question may seem a strange one . What choice do the defeated have but surrender ? Are they to fight until the last man , woman and child is dead or captured ? Surely , surrender is preferable to that . This is where Realpolitik and idealism conflict most sharply . Fighting to the last man is false idealism , the stuff of mythology , not of modern warfare . But consider the position in which Bosnia actually finds itself . The central feature of any imaginable surrender agreement will be territorial partition along ethnic / religious lines . But will the Serbs accept their victory ? The terms most recently proposed by the European Union ' s David Owen and the United Nations ' Thorwald Stoltenberg are sure to be revised in the Serbs ' favor , given their military strength and the mood of defeat in the European Union and the United Nations . But even then , will the Serbs be satisfied ? There is every reason to doubt this . The Bosnians must be prepared_for them , instead , to disregard the terms of a surrender agreement just as they have disregarded the terms of so many cease-fires . Post-surrender , whatever remains of the Bosnian state will almost certainly come under immediate Serbian attack . But what of enforcement of the agreement by the United Nations or NATO ? After Gorazde , can such a question even be asked ? The declaration of safety for the haven cities -- a dry_run for the enforcement of a surrender agreement -- was a modest promise that the United Nations has failed to keep . The Serbs have repeatedly manipulated the United Nations into providing cover_for their aggression , a point made with bitterness and shame by the U.N. commander in Bosnia , Sir Michael Rose . NATO , in the moment of truth , has twice run from the fight , and many hundreds have died as a result . If the surrender terms are to be enforced only by these bodies , the Bosnians must expect the terms simply to be unenforced . But why not , even then , surrender and hope for the best rather than fight on to certain defeat ? Because the Serbs ' declared and already substantially implemented political_program is genocidal . Documentation on this point is abundant . Post-surrender , the Bosnians must plan not on the excesses of soldiers in the heat of battle but on a cold and considered policy aimed at what former Polish Prime_Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki , formally investigating the_matter for the United Nations , did not shrink_from calling &quot; extermination. &quot; Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic ' s election slogan was &quot; Mobilization and Homogenization. &quot; Redrawing the Serb / Bosnian border in Bosnia is thus not like redrawing the_French / German border in Alsace-Lorraine . The French and the Germans fought to control land and people . The Serbs want the land without the people . In the name of homogeneity , they have expelled those they could expel and slain the rest . As the last local refugee havens fall and no foreign havens open , slaughter will necessarily become the tactic of choice . Faced with this choice between , analogously , Auschwitz and an endless Warsaw Uprising , Realpolitik recommends Auschwitz . No one should be surprised , however , if the Bosnians themselves choose the Warsaw Uprising even knowing that eventual annihilation awaits them . In their position , what would you do ? Jim Hoagland , whose integrity is beyond reproach , does not intend to urge extermination as a peace settlement for the Bosnians . That much should go without saying . But just as the methodological exclusion of morality and morale from the political calculus led the United States astray in Vietnam , so it could do so again in the Balkans . A people with nothing left to lose but life itself should be expected to fight on , and it is wishful_thinking to suppose otherwise , to suppose , in other words , that merely declaring them defeated will &quot; shut this war down. &quot; Wars are not won by air_power alone . But neither are they won by ground and air_power together . They are won or lost by human_beings in all their complexity , and the besetting temptation of Realpolitik is to leave_out some of that complexity -- above all_the complexity of desperate emotion . Ismet Briga , Gorazde ' s mayor , said at the peak of the siege : &quot; We have only two choices : We can be slaughtered , or we can fight and die with dignity . The town will not fall as long as there is anybody alive in it. &quot; In some wars , in some sieges , a statement like his might be dismissed as bravado . In this one , it should not be . It has just the kind of psychological realism about it to which classic Realpolitik has so often been blind . &quot; Surrender and be done with it &quot; is not the voice of reason . The Bosnians , whatever their losses , dare not surrender , and we shall none of us soon be done with it .</TEXT>
