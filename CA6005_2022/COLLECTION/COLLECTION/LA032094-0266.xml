   <HEADLINE> CALENDAR ' S BIG OSCARS ISSUE ; SPIELBERG AND THE GANG ; THE ' SCHINDLER ' DIRECTOR , ALONG WITH DE PALMA , COPPOLA , LUCAS AND SCORSESE , HAS DEFINED FILM SUCCESS -- BOTH CRITICALLY AND COMMERCIALLY -- OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS ( EVEN THOUGH THE GREAT FRIENDS HAVE ONLY ONE BEST DIRECTOR OSCAR AMONG THEM -- SO FAR ) . WHAT IS IT ABOUT THESE GUYS ANYWAY ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The odds are strong that Steven Spielberg will win the Academy Award Monday night , but the Oscar he is likely to get_at last , for directing &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; might seem to some to be merely the old_guard ' s belated concession that he is the most important commercial movie_maker in the world . The academy , after all , is just that -- an academy , a repository of received wisdom and guiding tradition . Spielberg and his generation of directors , though the first to be trained in film schools , have not always gone_about their careers in academy-like ways as they pursued younger audiences , indulged idiosyncrasy , celebrated technology and sex and , in growing numbers , fled Hollywood altogether . Spielberg , at 47 , is now old enough to embody the academy , or at least the new academy . Furthermore , he ' s as much a mogul as a director , the emperor of Amblin and all he surveys . But before he takes that expected walk up the red-carpeted aisle to be industrially sanctified Monday night , it ' s worth noting that for 20 years he has been a member of a smaller , more elite fraternity of directors brought_together by time , talent and friendship -- an extended_family that is rarely seen together in public yet communicates through its own back channels and private screenings , a group that has left an indelible mark on Hollywood , yet has only one director ' s Oscar to show for it . The family does not have a fixed number , but at its center are five men : Spielberg , Francis Ford Coppola , George Lucas , Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma . In the popular imagination , their names conjure_up disparate images and mythologies , but if you talk to them and their associates , you discover that the way they view one another is not at all_the way critics and moviegoers see them . * They each have different styles , interests and sensibilities , but in a business where success can depend_on your best_friend ' s failure , they seem to have shared a common regard for the talents of the other members . What is more , they share history . All of them arrived in Hollywood in the late ' 60s or early ' 70s , during the period when the great studios were losing their grip on the business and a new youth culture was clamoring at the gates . Mike Medavoy , the former TriStar and Orion chairman who was then an agent , claims to have introduced many of them to one another after recruiting them for representation . Lucas and Spielberg together would conceive and create the character of Indiana Jones in 1977 , the year they made &quot; Star Wars &quot; and &quot; Close Encounters of the Third Kind , &quot; respectively ; last year , when Spielberg had to leave for Poland to film &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; he asked Lucas to supervise the final editing of &quot; Jurassic Park. &quot; Coppola produced Lucas ' &quot; THX 1138 &quot; and &quot; American Graffiti , &quot; then directed the Vietnam movie that Lucas had initially developed with writer John Milius , &quot; Apocalypse Now. &quot; Lucas ' ex-wife , Marcia , a film editor , edited Scorsese ' s &quot; Taxi Driver , &quot; whose script was written by Paul Schrader , who also had written an early draft of &quot; Close Encounters &quot; and had been introduced to Scorsese by De Palma . De Palma also introduced Scorsese to Robert De Niro , who would become the star of &quot; Taxi Driver , &quot; &quot; Raging Bull , &quot; &quot; The King of Comedy &quot; and &quot; Cape Fear , &quot; not to mention Coppola ' s &quot; Godfather II. &quot; ( De Niro , then unknown , acted in De Palma ' s first feature , &quot; The Wedding_Party , &quot; released in 1968. ) Coppola recommended Scorsese to actress Ellen Burstyn when she was looking_for a director for &quot; Alice Doesn ' t Live Here Anymore &quot; in 1974 . In the fall of 1990 when De Palma was struggling with the final edit of his ill-fated &quot; Bonfire of the Vanities , &quot; whom did he call_in for an opinion but Spielberg . Spielberg introduced De Palma to De Palma ' s first wife , actress Nancy Allen , who later appeared in the Spielberg-produced &quot; I Wanna Hold Your Hand. &quot; De Palma is the godfather to Spielberg ' s son , Max , from his marriage to actress Amy Irving , who appeared with Allen in De Palma ' s &quot; Carrie &quot; and starred in his thriller &quot; The Fury. &quot; And so it goes . Scorsese and De Palma eventually returned to New York and Coppola and Lucas retreated to San Francisco , but the professional and personal ties have stretched across the years . &quot; All of us in that group have had very positive , reinforcing relationships that have gone_on forever and ever , &quot; says Lucas , speaking from his headquarters in San Rafael , where he is at_work producing the mystery comedy &quot; Radioland Murders. &quot; &quot; Everyone has been supportive of one another and always been there if someone ' s in_trouble , if there ' ve been any problems . Francis and I have had our disagreements over the years , but there ' s never been anything where we stopped talking to each other . I ' ve disagreed_with everybody and everybody has disagreed_with me and that goes from Steven and Brian and Marty and everybody else . But I don ' t believe any of the relationships have ever been strained . &quot; Physically , it ' s harder to spend time with each other because everybody ' s so busy , but if you define friendship in a more spiritual way , I think everybody ' s gotten a lot closer . Because we ' ve all gone_down the same roads and have been sharing the same experiences . &quot; And we all like each other ' s movies . Brian and Steven and Francis all saw ' Star Wars ' when I was cutting it and offered me advice . I ' ve sat in on a lot of first cuts of Marty ' s pictures , giving him advice . There ' s been a lot of exchange of plots and ideas over the years from that whole group . I know Brian and Marty have been very close . &quot; Everybody ' s been fairly successful , everybody ' s fairly rich and everybody ' s gotten a fair amount of respect and everybody ' s sort of been equally trashed by the media . There ' s probably more camaraderie in being trashed together than in being successful . When filmmakers sit around , they don ' t really talk_about their successes , they talk_about the people that have gone_after them for one reason or another . ' We ' ve all had our ' Howard the Duck , ' our ' 1941 , ' our ' One From the Heart. ' And everything you do , in the end , half the people think what you ' ve done is terrible and the other half think it ' s wonderful . You know , even ' Schindler ' s List ' is getting blasted , so there ' s no escape_from getting trashed. &quot; * Lucas went_to USC , Coppola to UCLA , Scorsese to NYU , and De Palma to Columbia . Spielberg attended Cal State Long_Beach but dropped_out to direct television_shows for Universal before his 22nd birthday . Spielberg is the youngest of the five at 47 ; Lucas is 49 ; Scorsese , 51 , De Palma , 53 , and Coppola , 55 . Coppola is the only one thus far to win an Oscar , for &quot; The Godfather Part II. &quot; ( He also won a screenwriting Oscar , in 1970 , for &quot; Patton. &quot; ) Spielberg has been nominated four times , Scorsese three times , Lucas twice and De Palma not at all . Spielberg and Lucas have directed seven of the 10 top grossing films of all time , but while they were at it , the Oscar for best director has gone_to such contemporaries as Barry Levinson , Oliver Stone ( twice ) , Jonathan Demme and Michael Cimino . The godfather of the group , Coppola , is old enough to have started in the theater , at Hofstra University on Long_Island , before heading west to enter UCLA ' s film school . He dropped_out to make a B-picture ( &quot; Dementia 13 &quot; ) for drive-in movie czar Roger Corman , though he was later awarded his degree for writing and directing the 1967 Warner Bros . feature &quot; You ' re a Big Boy Now &quot; that starred Elizabeth Hartman , Geraldine Page and Julie Harris . &quot; We had heard about Francis , &quot; says Oscar-winning sound editor Walter Murch , who was then a classmate of Lucas ' across town at USC . &quot; He was legendary because he had managed to get paid_for his master ' s thesis. &quot; Lucas managed to get hired as Coppola ' s administrative assistant at Warner ' s when they were the only two bearded men on the lot . Says Mike Medavoy : &quot; What was special about these guys is that they had to break_through because the older guys were in_charge . And remember , some guys didn ' t make it. &quot; * Some of the most promising members of their generation in America dropped_out of the fray or took other roads : Monte Hellman ( &quot; Two Lane Blacktop &quot; ) , Terrence Malick ( &quot; Badlands , &quot; &quot; Days of Heaven &quot; ) and Noel Black ( &quot; Pretty Poison &quot; ) . But at the time , the film-school turks were_on the march . The invention of the transistor had made film equipment lighter , cheaper and portable , and opened filmmaking to people outside the studio system for the first time . The nouvelle auteur theory , raising the status of the director to culture hero , had traveled across the Atlantic from France . &quot; Now , all_of a sudden , &quot; Murch recalls , &quot; you could go_out with a tape_recorder and a 16mm portable camera , portable lights . It was a revolution Godard had started with ' Breathless , ' where he showed that you could make an interesting film with that technology . &quot; The early days of Zoetrope ( Studio ) when George and Francis and I were all together in the late ' 60s was very much part of that aesthetic : ' Let ' s get some of that film-school-type equipment , throw it in the back of the van and travel across the country and make a film. ' &quot; After directing Fred Astaire and Petula Clark in Warner ' s &quot; Finian ' s Rainbow , &quot; Coppola did just that -- took_off with Lucas in tow on a transcontinental film odyssey to make &quot; The Rain People , &quot; the first film for his own mini-studio Zoetrope , based in San Francisco and fueled by anti-Hollywood idealism . Planned as a kind of film co-op that would make movies on tiny budgets , Zoetrope would be famously undone by its own success and financial mismanagement . Ironically , the huge box-office bonanza of Lucas ' &quot; Star Wars &quot; propelled Hollywood into blockbuster fever in the late ' 70s and led to a backlash in which Lucas was blamed for Hollywood ' s new accountant-driven film economics . But the spirit of the Coppola commune , in some ways , did not die . In 1985 , when Murch was directing &quot; Return to Oz &quot; for Disney in London and having difficulties , Lucas flew in from Japan and Coppola from Los Angeles to lend their hands . Spielberg also stopped by , as did Phil Kaufman , another member of the Bay Area filmmakers ' circle . &quot; They certainly brought a new sensibility to Hollywood , &quot; says screenwriter Frank Pierson about Spielberg and the rest of the gang of five . &quot; Whether or not it was as revolutionary as it seemed at the time I don ' t know . But clearly what they represented was the wave of change in public taste and attitudes in many things , which they brought with them . And they came_into the business with a kind of technical training that nobody before had. &quot; This technical proficiency , however , became and remains controversial . &quot; Knowing which end of the camera is the lens and which end is the handle is not the important thing really , &quot; says Pierson , who wrote such films as &quot; Dog Day Afternoon &quot; and &quot; Cat Ballou &quot; and is the current president of the Writers Guild . &quot; The important thing is what you bring_in terms of life experience , of wisdom , of insight and all those things that go_into making_up an artist . I don ' t know that film school is necessarily a very good preparation for life , as opposed to a good preparation for making a living . &quot; They produced a result , which was a shift to ever-younger market orientation , ever-younger executives and an increasing focus_on youth and a greater and greater discounting of experience. &quot; It might also be said that Spielberg and his brethren have inspired a legion of imitators who seem even less interested in the traditions of characterization and drama and more preoccupied with the camera itself -- directors like Robert Zemeckis , Chris Columbus , Joe Dante and Phil Joanou . You need a long lens indeed to look_at the work of Spielberg ' s imitators and hope to see in the distance any traces of the not-so-ancient films of Altman , Peckinpah , Nichols , Penn , Benton , Lumet , Mazursky and Schlesinger . Spielberg himself has professed highest admiration for British director David Lean , and together with Scorsese persuaded Columbia to restore and re-release Lean ' s epic &quot; Lawrence of Arabia &quot; in 1988 . De Palma looked_to Hitchcock for inspiration as he developed his suspense thrillers , such_as &quot; Carrie , &quot; &quot; The Fury &quot; and &quot; Dressed to Kill , &quot; and endured round after round of public bashing from feminists who believed his movies underscored women as targets . &quot; My work is not necessarily me , &quot; De Palma said in 1984 , defending the release of &quot; Body Double , &quot; a film in which a woman was murdered with a giant electric_drill . &quot; I happen to like women . I ' ve said it a hundred-thousand times . If anybody believes it , I don ' t know anymore. &quot; Scorsese became the primary archivist of the group , buying hundreds of films for his personal library in New York . Scorsese met Coppola , a fellow Italian American , at a film festival in Sorrento in 1970 , and would frequently come_to San Francisco in later years to view movies in Coppola ' s home . After studying film at NYU , Scorsese taught there and then apprenticed with Corman ( &quot; Boxcar Bertha &quot; ) . In all , he spent 11 years in Los Angeles . Spielberg helped him polish the last 10 minutes of &quot; Taxi Driver &quot; in 1976 and Scorsese later directed an episode of Spielberg ' s &quot; Amazing Stories &quot; for television in the ' 80s . In fact , Spielberg was originally scheduled to direct &quot; Cape Fear &quot; and Scorsese &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; but they decided to swap projects . Meanwhile , De Palma , the other New Yorker , became so friendly with Spielberg that it was widely believed the two regularly sent each other their dailies on video to analyze and critique each other ' s work . Someone who has worked closely with both men observes , &quot; They ' re like mechanical junkies , like these kids who would win the science fairs , comparing notes technically all_the time . They ' re totally bonded and bound like a fraternity . Beside the spirit of film , the technology of film bonds them together . They ' re like little Trekkies. &quot; * The careers and images of the five men hardly suggest the common_ground they seem to have found together . There ' s Coppola , the operatic conductor who made some undeniably great movies a long_time ago but more recently has made &quot; Godfather III , &quot; &quot; Bram Stoker ' s Dracula &quot; and vintages of premium wine ; Lucas , the modern myth maker who has put directing aside to produce films by other directors and oversee an empire of special-effects technology ; De Palma , the fabulous voyeur and thrill-seeker whose taste is the raunchiest and least respectable ; Scorsese , famous for his fervent dramas like &quot; GoodFellas &quot; and &quot; Mean Streets , &quot; as well as for trying to show Jesus as a man with lust in his heart , and Spielberg , the greatest crowd-pleaser of all for his science-fiction melodramas like &quot; Close Encounters &quot; and &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; and children ' s stories that appealed_to grown-ups ( &quot; E.T. , &quot; &quot; Raiders of the Lost Ark &quot; ) . Apart from some critical blows he has taken along the way , as when he ventured into more literary territory in &quot; The Color Purple &quot; and &quot; Empire of the Sun , &quot; Spielberg has enjoyed probably the most benign depiction in the media . Along with scores of other powerful players , he was tarred with broad strokes by producer-author Julia Phillips ( who produced &quot; Close Encounters &quot; ) in her best-selling &quot; You ' ll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again. &quot; And his integrity and general wholesomeness were questioned by writers Stephen Farber and Marc Green in the 1988 book &quot; Outrageous Conduct , &quot; which investigated the fatal 1982 helicopter crash on the set of the movie &quot; The Twilight Zone &quot; that Spielberg produced . But these are exceptions . * Because of the high offices each of the five occupies in the movie kingdom , all have been at the center of periodic storms of controversy about one film or another , with the result that they have sometimes been broadly typecast . In 1992 on the set of &quot; The Age of Innocence &quot; in New York , Scorsese responded , &quot; Ultimately I ' m trying to be a director : not necessarily a filmmaker or a maverick filmmaker -- they try to give you these titles and suddenly I ' ve discovered I ' m a maverick . What is that ? I ' m not made_up in the same way as Woody Allen , who has wonderful control of his material because he writes a picture a year within a certain framework production-wise . But I find different stories . &quot; I don ' t know if I can be a director in terms of the old Hollywood system , in which they were able to do anything that was given to them . In most cases , a lot of the men who directed brought the same enthusiasm to every project . But I ' m tempted to do that , though I ' m not interested in everything. &quot; Lucas agrees . &quot; None of us is one-dimensional , &quot; he says . &quot; People forget . I ' ve done movies with Francis that get lost because they were unsuccessful. &quot; He ' s referring to the pair ' s producing of independent films like Paul Schrader ' s Japanese-themed &quot; Mishima &quot; and Godfrey Reggio ' s wordless Third_World documentary &quot; Powaqqatsi. &quot; &quot; People do movies for different reasons and get attached_to certain subjects for different reasons and they ' re motivated by different kinds of things , &quot; Lucas goes_on . &quot; I don ' t think any of us would want to make the movies that the other guys are making . Brian would n ' t want to make my kind of movies , I would n ' t make Steven ' s kind of movies , Steven would n ' t want to make Marty ' s kind of movies , Marty would n ' t want to make Francis ' kind of movies. &quot; It ' s nearly forgotten now that Scorsese was one of the film editors on NYU colleague Michael Wadleigh ' s 1970 feature documentary &quot; Woodstock , &quot; or that it was his idea to employ the humorous anachronism of flashing the lyrics to certain songs onscreen with a bouncing ball . &quot; Like Marty ' s doing ' The Age of Innocence , ' &quot; Lucas says . &quot; ' The Age of Innocence ' is a perfect Scorsese movie . It ' s a movie about constraint and manners and convention -- that looms very big for Marty . He loves period epics . It ' s only if you think_of everything as ' Raging Bull ' are you surprised . &quot; Because we know a lot more about each other ( than the public ) and because we ' re good friends , to me when Steve brings_out ' Schindler ' s List ' it ' s absolutely no surprise at all . Of course he would do that and of course it would turn_out like that . &quot; There are films I ' ve always wanted to do that I ' ve never managed to get_around_to doing that are very different from the kind of things I ' ve done . Someday if I ever make any of those movies , people will be equally shocked and think , ' My God , how could he have done that ! ? ' &quot;</TEXT>
