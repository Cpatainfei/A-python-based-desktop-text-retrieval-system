   <HEADLINE> FRENCH LOOSEN TIES TO FORMER AFRICA COLONIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When African leader Felix Houphouet-Boigny was laid_to_rest last week in Ivory_Coast , 3 # 000 miles south of Paris , 100 French politicians stood dutifully at the graveside . But even as President Francois Mitterrand , Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur and other French officials mourned an old friend and assured Africa of their support , they were steadily putting an end to the long , cozy and paternalistic relationship with France ' s former colonies on the continent . The policy_changes , which include a 50 % devaluation in the French-backed currency in 13 African_nations last month , have angered some African leaders and created sudden economic chaos in a French-speaking region that represents a third of the continent . And France ' s influence in Africa , though still strong , is bound to diminish , analysts say . &quot; The significance is that France is letting_go_of its pretension to be a global empire , &quot; said Mort Rosenblum , author of &quot; Mission to Civilize , &quot; a book on France ' s relationship with its former colonies . &quot; This just shows that France is not willing to stand against any tide. &quot; The tide , in this case , was the growing drain of Africa ' s beleaguered economies on France ' s own recession-hit budget . For 46 years , France has propped_up the currencies of African_countries in the &quot; Franc Zone , &quot; guaranteeing to exchange their currencies for French_francs at a rate of 50-to-1 . France has also spent an estimated $ 3 billion a year in its former African colonies , including gifts to meet month-end shortfalls in civil_servants ' salaries . &quot; We just had the feeling we were wasting our money , &quot; said a top-level French official in Paris . &quot; It wasn ' t going_for development but rather for salaries and debt payments . So we ' ve said : ' we ' ll help you in an emergency . But we don ' t want this to become a habit anymore. ' &quot; The French government insists that it is not abandoning Africa . Last month , it tried to soften the blow of its new policy by writing_off $ 5 billion in loans to Africa . ( In fact , much of France ' s aid to Africa flows back into France in contracts for French companies. ) But the_French say they want to force Francophone Africa to practice the same fiscal austerity required these days by the government in France . &quot; Our message to our African friends is , ' We can help you , but we want you to be responsible too , ' &quot; the_French official said . &quot; We will have our shared history for a long_time . But what is changing is the way we look_at Africans . Maybe we don ' t look down on them anymore. &quot; Nevertheless , the devaluation , from 50-to-1 to 100-to-1 , was tough economic medicine . The region had been accustomed to relative economic and political stability , thanks to France ' s treasury and , occasionally , its armed forces . But , for many Africans , the sudden drop_in the value of their African francs represented the biggest change in their lives since independence . African leaders , under pressure from France and international lenders , agreed to the measures at a meeting in January in Dakar , Senegal . ( Thirteen accepted a 50 % devaluation , while the tiny island nation of Comoros agreed only to a 33 % devaluation. ) But some African officials complained later that they had been presented with a fait_accompli . L ' Union newspaper , the mouthpiece for Gabon ' s president , Omar Bongo , sharply criticized the decision . &quot; The selloff of black_Africa has begun , &quot; it said in an editorial . &quot; De Gaulle must be turning_in his grave . Your heirs have gone crazy , mon general . &quot; Balladur strongly defended the devaluation and applauded the &quot; courage &quot; of the African leaders . &quot; The decision was difficult , &quot; he said , &quot; but it shows that Africa is taking its destiny in_hand and ensuring the long-term development and well-being of its people . And France will do its utmost to help these countries get_through these difficult times. &quot; The devaluation will cause prices of_imported goods in Francophone Africa to double , which is likely eventually to hurt French exports to the region . Higher prices for such imported staples as rice , already announced by some African leaders , have created deep anxiety in French African capitals . And shoppers went_on a buying spree after the devaluation announcement , wiping shelves clean of goods priced according to the old exchange_rate . African leaders are worried because food riots on the continent have toppled more_than one government . To buy political peace in the cities , many African_nations have maintained overvalued currencies , which kept food cheap . But those policies also dried_up export markets for farmers , prompting many to give_up on the land and flood the cities in search of work . Now , economic analysts say , the new exchange_rates will make French West_African products more attractive to the international market , including other African_countries . No immediate increase in exports is expected , though , largely because the world market for Africa ' s primary products , such_as cocoa and coffee , is deeply depressed . Yet , those analysts say , the devaluation was a necessary first_step to long-term economic_growth . The crisis was precipitated by the refusal of the World_Bank and the International Monetary Fund to lend more money to Francophone African_countries already unable to meet their debt payments . International lenders had demanded a devaluation as a condition of writing new loans , and they have responded quickly to help the affected countries . Mitterrand , the Socialist president , had warned Africa in 1990 that future French aid would be linked to political reform . But his government did not follow_through , and in fact helped several of its friends retain power despite evidence of election_fraud . Then , the Gaullists routed the Socialists in French elections last March , and Balladur quickened the_French policy_changes in Africa . Balladur sent a letter to the African leaders last year , urging them to take decisive action to heal their economies . It was a warning unlike any the leaders had ever received from Paris , and it prompted several , including Houphouet-Boigny , the aging patriarch of French West Africa , to come_to France and argue against a devaluation of the African currencies . ( Houphouet-Boigny died of cancer on Dec . 7 and was buried on Feb . 7. ) But France ' s sentimental attachment to Africa has waned . &quot; There ' s a real generational shift taking_place now , and it will continue , &quot; said an American diplomat with long experience in Africa . &quot; Some of the Gaullists care because it ' s Africa , and it ' s where France is still a world_power . But the_French people don ' t care . They ' d rather see their money spent in places like China , where the_French can make money. &quot; ' Franc Zone ' France has for decades propped_up the currencies of 14 African_countries . But that practice is ending as France backs_away from the cozy and costly relationship with its former colonies . Here are the nations of the &quot; Franc Zone. &quot; Senegal Mali Niger Chad Central_African_Republic Cameroon Comoros Gabon Congo Equatorial Guinea Togo Benin Burkina Faso Ivory_Coast</TEXT>
