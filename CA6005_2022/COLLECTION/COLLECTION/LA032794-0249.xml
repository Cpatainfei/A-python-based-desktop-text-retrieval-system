   <HEADLINE> AID LOGJAM LEAVES NERVOUS WRECKS ; QUAKE : MANY LANDLORDS ARE RUNNING_SHORT OF PATIENCE AND MONEY . A FLOOD OF APPLICANTS HAS DELAYED FEDERAL ASSISTANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After major heart_surgery and nearly 40 years nurturing a small , family-run string of Los Angeles apartment_buildings , Kenneth Shaffer was sailing smoothly toward retirement last winter . But his dreams ran violently aground in January ' s squall of seismic activity , which left one of his buildings destroyed , another shaken from its foundation and others battered enough to scare_off tenants . Now the 73-year-old landlord is struggling to stay afloat as he navigates the Small Business Administration disaster assistance program , the main channel of relief for owners of thousands of damaged rental units . Inundated with a record number of business and homeowner loan requests -- already more_than the combined total of applications in the Midwest floods , Hurricane Andrew and Hurricane Hugo -- federal_officials acknowledge that paperwork is backing_up . Nearly a month and half after filing his application , Shaffer finally completed the first leg of approval -- meeting with a federal appraiser to verify his damages . &quot; I don ' t get much sleep . . . . The delays in this are just amazing , &quot; said Shaffer , who has lost nearly a quarter of the 250 rental units he accumulated over a lifetime ' s work . With post-quake bills piling_up and cash flow down , it ' s nail-biting time for many mom-and-pop apartment owners such_as Shaffer , already squeezed_by three years of recession and declining rents . Small , private landlords make_up the bulk of apartment owners . How they fare with the Small Business Administration could affect the post-quake dynamics of the local rental housing market , government and housing_industry officials say . With nearly 50 # 000 apartment units declared uninhabitable in Los Angeles , authorities fear that thousands of rental units could be lost , pushing_up rents in some areas and shrinking the availability of affordable units . Just how serious that threat is remains unclear , officials and industry leaders say . But the risk that large_numbers of units could be abandoned increases the longer it takes landlords to patch together refinancing agreements with the Small Business Administration . &quot; The SBA is the key to everything , &quot; said Los Angeles housing department manager Gary Squier . &quot; They are the ones with ( low-interest ) money . . . the primary vehicle for assisting ( apartment ) owners . &quot; It ' s been ( two months ) since the earthquake . If the SBA program is going_to be effective , we should start seeing loans being made very shortly . This is sort of a critical time. &quot; Industry officials echo that anxiety . &quot; People are . . . trying to pull their assets back from the brink of disaster , &quot; said Bill Shaw , president of the Apartment Assn . of Greater Los Angeles . &quot; There ' s a lot of anguish out there . ( The SBA ) is certainly slower than most people hoped it would be . It ' s very cumbersome for some people. &quot; * SBA officials say they are moving as quickly and responsibly as possible to process the unparalleled load of more_than 140 # 000 applications , with the number swelling by thousands per day . At the two-month mark after the disaster , the agency had reached a decision on less than 25 % of the loan requests , compared to 85 % in the Midwest floods and 75 % in Hurricane Andrew . &quot; The numbers are enormous . . . completely outside of anyone ' s experience , &quot; said Bernard Kulik , the agency ' s assistant administrator for disaster assistance . Although they are sensitive to landlords ' needs , agency officials note that they are lending taxpayers money that must be repaid , unlike the emergency assistance grants rushed to victims immediately after the earthquake . As such , the agency is performing a case-by-case balancing act : trying to help applicants get_back on their feet with 4 % interest loans but ensuring that public funds can be recovered . Even before the earthquake , many apartment owners were in precarious financial_conditions after years of soft rental markets and evaporating equity . Most could not afford earthquake insurance , which makes them eligible for agency assistance . * Although the agency has approved more_than 20 # 000 loans , totaling about $ 600 million , only several hundred involve apartment operators . The overwhelming majority are going_to homeowners , who also rely_on the Small Business Administration for reconstruction loans . Only a tiny fraction of that money has made_it to business applicants , including apartment owners . &quot; It ' s not an instantaneous process . . . . We are not an immediate response ( agency ) , &quot; said Gretchen Fournier , an agency spokeswoman . &quot; This is a loan program that takes financial analysis , which takes some time. &quot; Interviews show that landlords are having a range of experiences with the agency , and not all_of them negative . &quot; I am very delighted . They handled me very well , &quot; said a Westside retiree , who had received the first $ 10 # 000 increment of a $ 150 # 000 loan to repair his red-tagged , 10-unit apartment_building . Bill Tang , whose four-unit Hollywood building is a total loss , said the only frustrating part of his dealings with the agency was the chaos and long lines at the Disaster Assistance Center in the first days after the earthquake . After that , he was &quot; pretty satisfied &quot; with the pace toward approval of his $ 474 # 000 request , although he decided last week to forgo an agency rebuilding loan because the soft rental market makes the project too risky . &quot; It doesn ' t add_up , &quot; said Tang , who hopes to sell the property . Other anxious apartment owners are finding an infuriating mix of delays in the far-flung , multistaged process that extends_to a massive center in Sacramento and a check writing facility in Denver . &quot; I ' m emptying my bank_account . I ' m juggling my credit_cards . . . . I ' m afraid I may lose ( my ) building , &quot; said retired teacher Richard Daukas , who has run a gantlet of jammed phone_lines and message machines trying to get a $ 186 # 900 loan to repair his 15-unit Sherman Oaks building , a retirement investment . With broken drywall , flooded apartments and severely damaged stucco , Daukas raced to get his Small Business Administration application completed three days after the earthquake . Two weeks later , he was told that his loan was approved and that formal agreements would arrive in days . &quot; I ' ve been calling and calling and calling . They keep telling me that it ' s in the legal department . . . . They said there ' s been some kind of glitch . They don ' t know what exactly , &quot; Daukas said . Late last week , Daukas said the loan papers had finally arrived and he anticipates a two- to three-week wait for his check . Initially , officials indicated that loans would be approved one to three weeks after a complete application was filed . &quot; It became evident very quickly . . . we could not meet that , &quot; Kulik said . Officials said apartment and business loans are taking an average of four weeks to approve , although clearly some are taking far longer . One reason for the backlog has been the need to hire and train the hundreds of additional loan processors , Kulik said . Previous disasters have been largely handled by a core of employees who are familiar_with the agency ' s procedures . The delays in Shaffer ' s request appear to be abnormal , officials insisted , a casualty of the huge volume of paperwork and inspections . * Even after approval is received , it can take two or three weeks more to complete legal_documents and have the first loan funds issued , officials say . Bureaucratic delays are only part of the problem landlords face in dealing with the agency . Even with low-interest borrowing , some buildings do not pencil out . The agency has &quot; never dealt with multifamily ( housing ) so laden with debt , &quot; said Bob Moncrief , a city housing official who is working with the federal agency . Indeed , records show that nearly half of the SBA business loan_applications , which include apartment operators , have been denied or withdrawn thus far , many of them because they could not show adequate cash flow to make payments . That is hardest to show for those newer_to the apartment market , who tend to start with less expensive , more marginally profitable buildings . &quot; The people that really need help aren ' t getting_it , &quot; said Shaw , of the apartment association , recalling one immigrant couple who approached him frantically at a recent refinancing workshop . They had sunk their assets into a building that suffered major quake damage and it now seems nearly impossible to qualify for any loan program , he said . &quot; It was everything these people had . It was gone , &quot; Shaw said . In Santa Monica , Carl Lambert managed an unsalvageable 15-unit building that was denied a $ 850 # 000 reconstruction loan from the agency . It concluded that historic rents , which are controlled by the city , did not justify the cost of rebuilding , Lambert said . * Santa Monica officials are finalizing legislation to allow landlords to increase rents to pay_for some earthquake-related costs , and Lambert plans to reapply . Despite criticism , agency officials say they are offering a bigger assistance package than ever . In addition to reconstruction loans , apartment owners for the first time are eligible for separate low-interest loans to cover lost income from reduced rents and other losses . Also , to help save as_many marginal buildings as possible , Los Angeles city officials are setting_up a $ 30-million loan program for landlords who are rejected by the SBA . The program would seek to cover part of landlords ' debts so they could qualify for agency assistance . Payments on those city loans can be deferred until the building turns a profit or is sold . The loans will be coordinated with the federal agency , but as yet no loans have been completed . For Shaffer -- his dreams of easing into retirement now buried in worries about bills , construction delays and debt restructuring -- the end is nowhere in_sight . He finally got an agency appraiser to his property last week , after complaining to city officials about delays . The good news : The appraiser indicated that his losses appeared to be at least the $ 1.3 million he had sought , Shaffer said . * But time is money , and Shaffer worries that it could be several weeks before he receives his first money and can begin rehabilitating his buildings . After borrowing money to make repairs on his buildings that sustained cosmetic damage , Shaffer is searching for additional short-term bank loans so repairs can begin on his flagship building . The three-story , 37-unit Sherman Oaks structure rocked off its foundation and is vacant , listing like a beached freighter and sealed_off by chain-link fencing . Shaffer has decided to turn_back to the lender his 17-unit building , also in Sherman Oaks , that partially collapsed off its foundation . &quot; It ' s terrible . Terrible . The ( SBA ) delays mean delays all_the way down the line , &quot; Shaffer said . No Small Steps The federal Small Business Administration , the primary vehicle for disaster assistance to small business owners and homeowners , has been swamped with an unprecedented number of applications . Some business complain of long delays in the loan process . Officials stress that they cannot guarantee time lines , but ideally this is how it should work : 1 ) Applicant obtains an application at a disaster assistance center , fills it out and returns it with documentation , such_as three years of federal tax_returns , insurance_policies , copies of deeds , etc . The SBA says most delays are because of incomplete information . 2 ) Within a_few days , the applicant should receive a postcard acknowledging receipt of the file . Within five to 10 days , an SBA appraiser should meet with the applicant to verify and estimate the amount of the damage . 3 ) The packages moves to a loan processing center , typically a huge facility in Sacramento . Two weeks to one month after filing the application , a decision should be made and the applicant notified . 4 ) Within a_few more days , the applicant should receive final loan documents in the mail . They may be completed and returned by mail , but processing can be expedited at an SBA processing center . 5 ) Once the loan documents are returned and reviewed , a check should be mailed to applicant within two to three weeks of being ordered . * Related Story : A1</TEXT>
