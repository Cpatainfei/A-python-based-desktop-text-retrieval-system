   <HEADLINE> HOUSTON , EX-MCNALL ACCOUNTANT , WILL PLEAD GUILTY , ATTORNEY SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Robert J . Houston , a former accountant for King president Bruce McNall , will plead guilty to single counts of conspiracy , bank fraud and wire fraud , according to his attorney , David Reed . Houston , who sources said has been cooperating with the government investigation , is accused of filing false tax_returns and financial_statements to help McNall obtain more_than $ 150 million in loans . Appearing on Monday before U.S. Magistrate Judge George King , Houston pleaded not_guilty , but Reed told King that his client is &quot; going_to enter a guilty plea. &quot; King set a trial date of Nov . 22 before U.S. District Judge J . Spencer Letts . However , Reed indicated that the plea would come_before then . Houston is the second McNall business associate charged in a federal bank loan fraud investigation , one of about a dozen former McNall business associates known to have been negotiating pleas . Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter G . Spivack will ask that the Houston case be transferred to U.S. District Judge Richard Paez , who already has heard the guilty plea of Joanna Orehek . Orehek , former vice_president and controller of McNall ' s chief holding company , pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy , wire fraud and aiding and abetting . Her sentencing is scheduled for Jan . 30 . Houston was accused in court papers of being part of a group of McNall officials who , for the past eight years , fraudulently obtained loans by inflating McNall ' s income , overstating his assets and understating or omitting previous loans . Federal_officials allege that the fraudulent documents , as well as a group of sham companies , enabled McNall officials to get money for horse and coin operations as well as a $ 60-million business loan and a $ 20-million personal_loan from Bank of America . Among the financial_institutions prosecutors named as victims were Bank of America , Bank of California , First Los Angeles Bank , Union Bank and the_French bank Credit Lyonnais .</TEXT>
