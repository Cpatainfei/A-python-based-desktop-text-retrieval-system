   <TEXT> Tom Thomson just wants to keep doing what he knows best . What he knows , perhaps better than almost any other physicist in the United States today , is how to design weapons that harness and unleash the explosive energy of the atom . As a weapons designer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , he helped create 25 successful nuclear_weapons , one so powerful that a fault_line at the Nevada Test Site is named after it . The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , which chronicles the field , calls Thomson the dean of Livermore ' s weapons designers . But Thomson and his colleagues are now bomb builders for a country that has not manufactured a nuclear_weapon since 1990 . More_than at any time since scientists detonated the first atomic weapon at Alamogordo , N.M. , in 1945 , these researchers and the federal weapons labs that employ them face insistent questions about what role they should play in serving the nation . &quot; If you don ' t need the product , what do you need the factory for ? &quot; asked one weapons scientist . Of the millions shouldering arms or manufacturing armaments during the Cold_War , it was the designers of thermonuclear weapons who made_it unlike any other conflict in history . Thomson , 48 , came_of_age as a physicist in an era when the struggle for national security redefined science in the public interest . The Cold_War mandate was to keep peace by making weapons so powerful that to use them at all was to risk the destruction of civilization . For more_than two generations , researchers like Thomson at Livermore in the Bay Area and at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico raced to outdo each other in creating nuclear_weapons . But when the Berlin Wall fell five years ago , it was a signal that they had outlived their usefulness on the laboratory front_lines of the war against communism . By the time the last Russian soldier left Berlin this year , money for U.S. nuclear_weapons research had dropped_by one-quarter . Dreams of the &quot; Star Wars &quot; Strategic Defense Initiative , which pumped billions into basic weapons research , had faded . As a treaty to reduce strategic nuclear forces took_effect this month , those who raced to build weapons of mass destruction are dismantling stockpiled warheads and cleaning_up the environmental mess the Cold_War created . In the United States , there are no more_than 80 experienced thermonuclear weapons designers like Thomson . Many are retired . At Livermore , there may be less than 20 left , said David A . Nowak , the soft-spoken computational physicist who runs the laboratory ' s defense_systems group . Thomson wonders what he will be doing next year . &quot; I can ' t really write a resume and tell people what I did_in any detail , &quot; Thomson said . &quot; I worked_on bombs. &quot; Thomson ' s situation is one part of an uncertain future facing thousands of physicists , chemists , mathematicians and engineers who help implement the designers ' ideas at the giant weapons laboratories , managed jointly by the University of California and the Department_of_Energy . In the first major examination of the labs since the end of the Cold_War , an independent team of experts marshaled by the White_House and an Energy_Department commission are evaluating whether federal labs have outlived their usefulness . The commission is expected to make its recommendations in February . Congress is debating whether the weapons labs should be broken_up as costly Cold_War relics or consolidated into one facility , while President Clinton this week vowed to cut more_than $ 10 billion from Energy_Department spending . Last year , Livermore , Los Alamos and the Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque , N.M. , which fabricated field-ready weapons , spent more_than $ 3.4 billion and employed 24 # 000 people -- still near the peak of their Cold_War spending despite several years of belt-tightening . But much of the money is spent on cleaning_up nuclear waste . Funding for nuclear_weapons , although sizable , is declining steadily . &quot; The ( research ) budgets of the labs have been going_down noticeably and painfully , &quot; said senior science adviser Gregory Canavan at Los Alamos . &quot; Los Alamos has a terrible problem . It is the same at Livermore . There is real pain this year. &quot; There is little public sympathy about the limited prospects of the U.S. scientists who stocked the Cold_War arsenal with an array of imaginative doomsday devices . In all , the Energy_Department spends about $ 6 billion a year on research facilities , most of it concentrated at nine major laboratories that grew out of the effort to build the first atomic_bomb . With their exotic accelerators , photon sources and beam machines , the labs were cathedrals of a research community that Caltech science historian Daniel Kevles calls &quot; a kind of secular establishment -- with the power to influence and obtain state resources largely on faith and with an enviable degree_of_freedom from political control. &quot; For the first time in a generation , the political power of the scientists who sponsored them has been challenged by congressional critics in both parties intent_on reining_in a scientific &quot; culture of cost overruns. &quot; This scenario contrasts starkly with the situation in Russia . There , the prospect of unemployed weapons experts is so alarming that an international consortium raised $ 70 million to subsidize out-of-work Soviet scientists . The goal is to prevent them from selling their nuclear_weapons expertise to Iraq , Libya , North_Korea or another unfriendly potential nuclear_power . At least 300 Soviet bomb builders are believed to have enough expertise to design workable nuclear_weapons , while another 60 # 000 scientists have the related technical skills , such_as rocketry or advanced electronics , needed to construct thermonuclear_bombs . &quot; The knowledge is something that really should be contained as much as possible , &quot; said David S . Dearborn , a 45-year-old weapons physicist at Livermore who has had a direct hand in five underground nuclear_weapons tests since 1983 . &quot; There is real concern that an experienced weapons designer from the Soviet_Union could help someone skip_over a_couple_of steps to make something really nasty . &quot; Here in the U.S. , though , it is expected that most of the people who have been involved in this work are clever enough that they can find another job , &quot; he said . But , he added , economic realities have changed that expectation somewhat . &quot; The recession has not helped , &quot; he said . &quot; Unemployment for physics is at high levels. &quot; No one , however , questions the probity of America ' s retiring bomb makers . &quot; Most of the people I know who are involved in this recognize what a very poor choice it would be for nuclear_weapons to appear in some segments of the world , &quot; Dearborn said . * Beyond the security issue , though , is the more basic question of purpose . Without the central problem of nuclear war and national survival to stimulate their imagination , lab researchers may find that the wellspring of innovation has run_dry . George Craig worries about this . Steeped in the enigmas of high-energy physics and the secrecy of nuclear_weapons work , Craig has devoted his life to devising ever-more ingenious weapons of mass destruction . As defense research budgets nose dive , Craig , 53 , who has been a mid-level weapons physicist at Livermore for 20 years , says he has become a displaced person . Earlier this year , he was ordered to either find a research project that did not involve nuclear_weapons or seek employment elsewhere . Ever since , he has been trying to reinvent himself as a scientist . &quot; I am an aspect of a problem that is facing science in the United States , &quot; Craig said . &quot; The Cold_War is ended and now the scientific troops are being disbanded. &quot; Born the year the United States entered World_War_II , Craig has pursued a career shaped by the technical challenges of national defense -- from work_on thermonuclear weapons to studies of &quot; Star Wars &quot; lasers . The Cold_War cloistered him . It defined what he studied , where he went_to work and what he did when he got there . In 1991 , the year the Soviet_Union ceased to exist , his last big weapons project -- the Free Electron Laser -- was canceled . Now , Craig said , &quot; I am working my ass off &quot; to get_into biomedicine . * In search of a peacetime purpose , the people who helped bring the world nightmares of mutual destruction and dreams of space-based defenses have declared war on breast_cancer , global warming , gas-guzzling automobiles -- on anything , in fact , that can be seen as boosting the nation ' s advantage in the new , economic world_war . Nowhere is the changeover more apparent than at Livermore -- where the director was forced_out amid charges of mismanagement this year and where budgets are falling twice as quickly as at other facilities . Behind Livermore ' s armed guards and barbed wire , researchers are beating swords into plowshares as fast as they can . Officials say that under the aegis of weapons work , they have built_up a priceless storehouse of expertise on fundamental problems in science and engineering -- such_as basic research into the forces that consume the centers of stars or refinements in high-speed computing , radiochemistry and precision optics . In the hands of scientist Laura N . Mascio , for example , imaging software developed to recognize incoming warheads was transformed into a mammography device to detect breast_cancer more effectively . Other researchers are designing a better flywheel battery , making the clothing industry more competitive in the world market , developing neural net supercomputers for the IRS and helping Chrysler build better cars . Cooperative research agreements with industry are at record highs . More_than 700 companies have signed_up with an Energy_Department lab , up 70 % in two years , officials said . Livermore has more_than 100 such contracts . Nonetheless , they occupy no more_than about 5 % of Livermore ' s work_force , lab officials said . To keep their scientists employed , Livermore and other labs have aggressively solicited new business by moving_into such fields as law_enforcement , environmental cleanup and human genetics . &quot; In the past year , I have been inundated with weapons people and engineers who want to work with us , &quot; said Arthur V . Carrano , director of Livermore ' s Human Genome Center . &quot; A lot of people in the weapons programs were looking_for new venues and a lot of them got interested in health care. &quot; Critics eager to see weapons research curtailed even further contend that the labs are overestimating their ability to function as incubators of new industrial technology . They doubt that labs dedicated for so_long to the exotic demands of warhead design can ever adjust to the more fickle demands of commercial entrepreneurs . &quot; The problem for the weapons labs is to avoid becoming hired guns , so to speak , for whoever wants to buy their expertise , &quot; said Kevles at Caltech . &quot; National labs ought to have some overarching goal that is related to the national purpose. &quot; Despite the enthusiasm for civilian research , some scientists are concerned that the labs face a crisis of creativity . &quot; If the nuclear_weapons program will not be the main source of technology advance in the labs in future years , what will be ? &quot; ask experts at the congressional Office of Technology Assessment . In the meantime , the White_House and Energy_Department teams , along with congressional experts , are reappraising the marriage between science and the federal_government . In all , hundreds of federal laboratories , which receive about $ 25 billion a year -- more_than one-third of federal research funding -- are under evaluation . Defense_Department labs spend about $ 11 billion a year . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration spends $ 3.5 billion annually . Under one proposal , the entire Energy_Department could be abolished . Even the venerable U.S. Geological Survey , the nation ' s oldest federally supported science organization , has become a candidate for closure . &quot; The question facing them is whether . . . large parts have to be written_off as dinosaurs . Collectively , they desperately need a mission , &quot; said Stuart W . Leslie , a Johns Hopkins University historian and author of &quot; The Cold_War and American Science. &quot; &quot; The whole notion of endless scientific frontiers and basic research as the key to American security and prosperity is being re-evaluated , &quot; he said . No longer do the technical challenges of military preparedness command such a share of national resources . No longer can researchers garner big taxpayer-funded grants simply by holding_out the possibility of a military application . The prospect of a more conservative Congress next year makes some weapons lab scientists more optimistic about future funding , but most experts believe that the pressure to cut costs and reduce the budget_deficit will outweigh any effort to revive military research budgets . &quot; When the Cold_War ended , science lost its last remaining bastion of support -- the fact that it was regarded_as essential to national security , &quot; said Robert Park , a former Los Alamos physicist and a spokesman for the American Physical Society , which represents many U.S. physicists . &quot; Now who needs it ? &quot; he said . Tom Thomson knows that no one in the United States needs his special skills now . But he has an eye on the day when his expertise will once more be in_demand . With nuclear tests banned for the foreseeable future , Thomson and his colleagues are studying ways that thermonuclear blasts can be simulated in the laboratory and studied in detail . Other designers are committing their expertise to videotape and CD-ROM disks , where it can be preserved for bomb makers as yet unborn . In the interim , defense planners are laying the groundwork for the sophisticated scientific &quot; stewardship &quot; of the 3 # 500 thermonuclear warheads the United States intends to keep_on hand in the decades to come -- more_than the country had in 1958 . Those warheads -- each with far more destructive power than the atom_bomb that leveled Hiroshima -- are intended to be the keystone of U.S. military superiority for the foreseeable future . Ironically , the scientist who was so instrumental in creating many of them believes today that they are useless . Speaking with an openness rarely found among security-conscious nuclear_weapons researchers , Thomson said he cannot imagine why anyone today would ever want to use these warheads , precisely because they are too powerful . They are , he said , &quot; spite weapons &quot; designed for annihilating a superpower in a nuclear Armageddon . They would be useless against the smaller military targets of a more modern , limited conflict . &quot; Why should we assume the weapons that won the last war will have anything to do with the next war ? &quot; Thomson asked . &quot; I can ' t think_of any target for anything in our stockpile. &quot; He is quick to say he sees no credible nuclear threat for at least the next decade , but in his view that is no reason to give_up on weapons design . He sounds wistful when he muses on the possibilities of a new generation of low-yield tactical nuclear_weapons that &quot; could take_out an aircraft_carrier in the Pacific &quot; yet elude detection . &quot; I don ' t see any need to build the things , &quot; he said , &quot; but we ought to have an active ( research ) program. &quot; For Thomson , Dearborn , and Livermore itself , the future of such research is embodied in what until recently was one of America ' s most closely guarded scientific secrets -- a tiny pellet shaped like a cold capsule . The pellet , called a hohlraum , is used to trigger nuclear_fusion in an experimental process called inertial confinement fusion . The pellet would be used in a proposed $ 1.1-billion laser lab , called the National Ignition Facility . When barraged by lasers , the pellet ignites in a fusion reaction that promises a way to examine the titanic forces in a thermonuclear blast without field-testing a bomb . In October , spirits at Livermore were buoyed when Secretary_of_Energy Hazel O ' Leary approved a proposal to build the test lab there -- one of the largest defense and energy projects of the next decade . But there is no guarantee Congress will fund it . Livermore scientists already have the NOVA laser -- the largest and most powerful laser ever made -- to simulate weapons effects and conduct about 300 intricate experiments every year that probe the basic physics of nuclear_weapons . But that laser is not powerful enough to simulate fusion_bombs . The proposed facility would generate temperatures above 10 million degrees Fahrenheit -- the kind of heat created when a hydrogen_bomb explodes . Critics insist that there is no need for the more powerful laser . The National Ignition Facility , they say , is only an expensive sandbox to keep scientists such_as Thomson occupied . &quot; But , &quot; countered Thomson , &quot; kids can learn a lot in a sandbox. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) The Bombs They Built By the best available estimates , the United States has 14 # 900 nuclear_weapons today , compared to 29 # 000 nuclear_warheads in Russia and the other states of the former Soviet_Union . The precise number of nuclear_weapons , their locations , yields and production histories are still secret . How Bombs Work : The atomic_bomb starts a fission chain_reaction in uranium or plutonium that , in a fraction of a second , unleashes intense radiation and explosive power equal_to thousands of tons of dynamite . Today such fission_bombs are mostly used as triggers in thermonuclear weapons . Detonator Explosive Casing Uranium or Plutonium Sphere Neutron Source * * * The hydrogen_bomb uses a fission_bomb to compress deuterium and tritium at extremely high_temperature to cause instant fusion , producing a blast equal_to millions of tons of TNT . Detonator Explosive Casing Uranium or Plutonium Trigger Fusion Fuel Uranium Jacket Neutron Source * * * How Times Have Changed : U.S. strategic force levels today , as measured by the number of warheads , are the same as they were in 1972 . Russian strategic weapons are believed to be at the same level as they were in 1982 . By 2003 , the number of U.S. strategic nuclear_weapons will be equivalent_to those in 1962 , just after the Cuban missile crisis . Russian strategic nuclear forces will have returned to their 1976 level . Bigger Than a Breadbox : The 100 metric_tons of weapons-grade plutonium produced by the United States is so dense that it all could fit_in a 6-by-6-foot box . Trying Them On for Size : The five declared nuclear_powers -- the United States , the Soviet_Union , Britain , France and China -- acknowledge conducting 2 # 031 nuclear tests since 1945 . More_than half of those were by the United States . How Many Is Enough : Since 1945 , the United States has produced about 70 # 000 nuclear_weapons and the Soviet_Union is estimated have produced about 55 # 000 . The Big Bang : The explosive power of the U.S. nuclear arsenal peaked in 1960 at about 19 # 000 megatons , or to 19 million kilotons . Where Old Bombs Go : The Energy_Department ' s Pantex plant near Amarillo , Tex. , is the custodian of more_than 6 # 000 bowling-ball-size &quot; pits &quot; of highly toxic plutonium retrieved from dismantled nuclear_weapons .

( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Reinventing The Atom Shops In the years after World_War_II , the federal_government set_up nine major national laboratories to capitalize on the expertise generated by building the first atomic_bomb . Today , the Energy_Department spends about $ 7 billion a year to operate them and its other research facilties .
