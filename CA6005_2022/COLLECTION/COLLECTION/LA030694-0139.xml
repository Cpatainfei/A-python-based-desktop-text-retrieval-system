   <HEADLINE> BRAZILIAN ARMY WAITS IN WINGS AS GOVERNMENT TRIES TO CLEAN_UP ITS ACT ; POLITICS : THOUGH TALK OF A COUP IS DISMISSED , MILITARY_LEADERS DEMAND THAT THE COUNTRY ' S CORRUPTION AND ECONOMIC WOES BE ADDRESSED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When a leftist legislator found evidence of a scandal that could shake Brazil ' s young democracy to its foundations , he went straight to the army minister , bypassing the president and even his own party . The scandal had nothing to do with the armed forces , but Rep . Aloizio Mercadante knew an old truth about Brazil : For action in a crisis , the military is the place to go . Gen . Zenildo Lucena encouraged Mercadante to investigate . He also told him the army wanted a political housecleaning , fast , and that Congress should purge itself . A few days later , Benedito Onofre Bezerra Leonel , army chief_of_staff , said in a speech : &quot; Beware the anger of the legions . In moments of turbulence , military_leaders have always proven to be true leaders. &quot; Since relinquishing power in 1985 after 21 years of rule , military commanders have extolled the constitution and dismissed rumors of an impending coup . The latest comments , however , represent an unusually open attempt to influence events . &quot; These are warning lights of an institutional crisis , &quot; said Geraldo Cavagnari , a retired colonel who heads the Nucleus for Strategic Studies , a military think_tank . &quot; The armed forces are giving the civilian institutions a free hand to respond to these corruption crises . But if they ever fail , the conditions will be ripe for a takeover. &quot; Still other rumblings can be heard in the 325 # 000-member Brazilian military as it wrestles with its own identity_crisis , searching for a mission in a world without a Cold_War , under a government with no money . Sharp cuts_in defense spending and low pay have fed support among the middle ranks of officers for a military-backed coup of the sort carried_out by Alberto Fujimori , the Peruvian president , in 1992 . Such an uprising was proposed in October after Rep . Mercadante discovered 18 boxes of documents at the home of chief of the Odebrecht construction firm , one of Brazil ' s biggest . The documents contained the names of lawmakers who channeled public projects to builders for kickbacks . President Itamar Franco rejected the idea , but military analysts say a serious risk remains if Congress does not expel corrupt members and put the country ' s finances in_order . On Jan . 17 , a congressional investigating committee recommended the expulsions of 17 deputies and a senator for corruption . Votes by the full Chamber of Deputies and Senate are expected in March . Inflation of 2 # 500 % a year and soaring unemployment have made many Brazilians openly nostalgic for military rule , when economic_conditions were much better . Nearly half the respondents in opinion polls say Brazil would be better_off without Congress . Many residents of Rio speak fondly of the two-week Earth Summit in 1992 not for ecological reasons , but because many soldiers patrolling the streets provided a respite from crime . Low pay has become a serious problem for the military and the generals are pressing Franco to do something about it . A four-star general gets_about $ 30 # 000 a year after 25 years of service . Recruits are paid barely $ 80 a month . Congressmen receive more_than $ 80 # 000 annually , and most have high absentee_rates . Junior officers moonlight as plumbers , auto mechanics and taxi drivers . Their wives can be seen peddling chewing gum , popcorn or beverages outside movie_theaters . Although soldiers have never been paid generously , their fortunes began to decline in 1990 when Fernando Collor de Mello , the first directly elected civilian president since military rule , pledged to demilitarize Brazil . He slashed annual military spending to $ 2 billion , or 0.5 % of the gross_national_product , about one-sixth the level during army rule . Military_leaders say Brazil spends $ 13 per capita on the armed forces . Argentina and Chile , two other nations ruled by the military not long ago , spend spend $ 35 and $ 55 , respectively . So tight is the army ' s budget that it no longer provides each soldier with two uniforms . Recruits are sent home on weekends to save money . They train with blanks and BB_guns . In maneuvers , some units simulate attacks without weapons . Paratroopers simulate air invasions by leaping from vans -- jokingly called &quot; vancopters &quot; -- instead of helicopters . The division that guards Brazil ' s border with Colombia hasn ' t eaten meat in six months . Marine commanders and sailors spent only three weeks at_sea last year . Pilots train with 20-year-old F-5 jets and in a year fly no more_than 50 hours , the average monthly flight time for a U.S. pilot . In October , Finance_Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced a further 40 % cut_in defense spending as part of an effort to balance the federal budget and control inflation . During his speech in December , Gen . Leonel called Cardoso an &quot; irresponsible , crafty man with a disrespect for our moral values. &quot; Shortly afterward , President Franco ordered Cardoso to spare the military . Such costly projects as the $ 40-million nuclear submarine program , a rocket development program and maneuvers in the Amazon jungle were left intact .</TEXT>
