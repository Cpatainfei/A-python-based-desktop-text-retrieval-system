   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEW ; ' KEVORKIAN FILES ' PROBES DEATH ETHICS ; PBS ' EXAMINATION OF THE CONTROVERSIAL PATHOLOGIST AND HIS PATIENTS SHOWS THEM ALL TO BE DRIVEN BY STRONG BELIEF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Between the lines of &quot; Frontline ' s &quot; report , &quot; The Kevorkian Files , &quot; is the notion that Dr. Jack Kevorkian represents an attitude toward death unacceptable in a predominantly death-denying culture . Producer Michael Kirk ' s account of the doctor notorious for his &quot; death machine , &quot; his suicide-driven clientele and his incessant faceoffs with the courts suggests that there ' s something much deeper here than headline-grabbing . As a trained pathologist , Kevorkian could have quietly plied his craft . For decades , however , he appears to have linked his training with the knack of an experimental scientist . He studied eye movements in hospital patients at the moment of death . He published articles calling_for organ donations and transplants from death-row inmates and blood_transfusions from dead to wounded soldiers in the field . He even painted death imagery . Kevorkian was persona_non_grata in the U.S. medical Establishment long before the death machine , and in the numerous video_recordings shown here of his consultations with patients before their suicides , it ' s easy to sense Kevorkian getting his ammunition together for another battle . Perhaps the Kevorkian presented in &quot; Files &quot; is pathological about pathology , but he also seems driven by the faith of his patients that they are both doing the right thing . * The heart of the story are accounts of key patient histories , from Alzheimer ' s victim Janet Adkins ' case ( which triggered the first murder indictment against the doctor ) to the more mysterious case of Marjorie Wantz , whose maladies couldn ' t be detected by the medical_examiner who did her autopsy . Friends and family members uniformly express a mixture of sadness and relief as they recall their loved ones ' suicides . They do not seem concerned by the ethical problems of the Wantz case and others , just as some of the doctors interviewed do not seem concerned by the patients ' demands for some kind of release from their pain . Kevorkian may or may_not be performing some form of quackery ; at_the_same_time , these patients ' medical desires can ' t be callously dismissed as merely seeking quick_fixes . We never hear from Kevorkian ' s most virulent critics , those allied_with the anti-abortion movement . Instead , a doctor who has also assisted a patient with dying speaks_for those in the conflicted middle on the issue . Dr. Timothy Quill is often unsure of Kevorkian ' s means and ends , but he dramatically concludes that this &quot; File &quot; of patients is actually a condemnation of doctors unwilling to help those in their direst hour . Why did these people have to resort_to Kevorkian ? Where , Quill asks , were these people ' s doctors ? * &quot; The Kevorkian Files &quot; airs on &quot; Frontline &quot; tonight at 9 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15 , and at 8:30 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24 .</TEXT>
