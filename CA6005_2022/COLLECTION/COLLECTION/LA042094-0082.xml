   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES : PASTOR PUTS BELIEF INTO PRACTICE IN HIS WORK WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD ; REV . STEPHEN J . MATHER OF ANAHEIM ' S LEADERSHIP IN THE ORGANIZATION BRINGS CIVIL RIGHTS AWARD , AND CONTINUING PROTEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On April 24 , the Orange County Human Relations Commission will present the Rev . Stephen J . Mather of First Presbyterian_Church in Anaheim one of its 1994 awards for outstanding contributions in the area of human and civil_rights . That might not seem very surprising at first . The clergy , after all , is often in the vanguard of the human_rights struggle . But the honoring of Mather may surprise the religious right because he ' s being cited for his volunteer work as president of the board of directors of Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties . It will come as no surprise to those who know that the organization provides health_care services to thousands of women and men yearly . These services include contraceptive care , cancer screening , treatment of sexually transmitted diseases , AIDS testing and counseling , prenatal health_care and education , pregnancy prevention programs for teens and first-trimester abortions . When Mather was appointed 16 months ago , he caught the attention of some anti-choice people who believe that being pro-choice and Christian are incompatible . The religious right has attempted over the years to marginalize pro-choice Christians and Jews and to promote the view that all truly religious people share the same beliefs . However , a significant number of religious organizations are officially pro-choice and believe a woman has the ultimate right to decide when and if she wishes to bear a child . In fact , the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice ( formerly the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights ) is supported nationally by some 34 religious organizations . In Southern California these include the Evangelical Lutheran_Church in America , the United Methodist_Church , the Presbyterian_Church ( USA ) , the United Church of Christ and most non-Orthodox Jewish groups . Most of the clergy in these denominations are solidly pro-choice and some have been_active and visible supporters of this position . However , the firm stand the Rev . Mather has taken is extraordinary . By his public involvement with Planned Parenthood , he has made a commitment to responsible family_planning , to women ' s health and reproductive rights , and to curbing the burgeoning problem of teen pregnancies . And it has cost him . On most Sundays for the past 10 months , anywhere from five to 35 demonstrators have gathered outside Mather ' s church to protest his work as board president of Planned Parenthood . He has also received letters and telephone_calls from people critical of his position . For the most part , these individuals don ' t believe_in a woman ' s right to control the most basic and intimate decisions about her reproductive life . Nor do they believe_in the Rev . Mather ' s right to practice his religion or follow his conscience . By doing so in spite of pressure , he stands_in the tradition of people of conscience from the Hebrew prophets to the Rev . Martin_Luther_King Jr . and the other civil_rights activists of the 1960s and ' 70s .</TEXT>
