   <HEADLINE> VEGETARIANS DO THANKSGIVING ON A HIGH-FAD DIET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dana Diamond ' s family has resigned itself to the fact that she lives an &quot; alternative lifestyle. &quot; But in spite of certain aberrations , she ' ll be spending today celebrating Thanksgiving with them , dodging the discrimination inevitably forced upon those with her particular bent . Diamond is a vegetarian . She came_out about it two years ago when she began using &quot; live food &quot; like fruits and vegetables to nullify the long-term effects of an omnivorous upbringing . &quot; I remember some pretty gross things I used to eat , at fast-food restaurants , &quot; says Diamond , of Huntington Beach . &quot; Every once in a while you ' d find a bone in something . It was gross. &quot; Diamond is like many of her peers who still wonder what constitutes a Cheeto and are haunted by macabre images of Ronald McDonald wielding a watering_can in a hamburger patch . &quot; Being a vegetarian is a whole lifestyle , &quot; says Diamond , 20 , a clerk at Mother ' s , a health_food supermarket in Huntington Beach . And that lifestyle includes some pretty sophisticated , if esoteric , ingredients . Aromatherapy , iridology , homeopathy , colon therapy , body work -- Diamond says they are all part of the holistic lifestyle she and her peers have adopted in retaliation to their upbringing , during the age of microwaveable convenience_foods and the inauguration of the drive-through . This Thanksgiving , Diamond will feast on latkes -- Jewish potato_pancakes -- and vegetable quiche . She ' ll spend it with her mother and about 23 others , most of them feasting on turkey , prime rib and ham , stuffing ( is that with or without sausage ? ) and gravy made from pan drippings ( that ' s turkey fat ) . Pass the papaya enzymes , please . &quot; When the cavemen found something on the ground -- like a carrot -- they picked it up and just ate it . It was right there , and it was perfect , &quot; she says . Today ' s youth are more sophisticated about food than their parents , many of whom relied_on the then newly emerging convenience_food market to make_sure their kids got fed . Such foods were increasingly available in unprecedented variety , yet were generally loaded with preservatives and devoid_of nutrients -- remember Tater Tots , Fish Stix and frozen broccoli that smelled like weeds after you nuked it ? The variety of health_foods was once extremely limited , and those who indulged were typically thought to be eccentrics who never wore shoes . Yet today , vitamins and herbal and natural food supplements are big business . We know more now about the diet and its effect on the quality of our lives . A new_wave of hippie individuals is going_home this Thanksgiving to meet with yuppie parents who were once granola-snuffing hippies themselves , and who will greet them at the door wielding trays of baby vegetables to appease their squeamish palates . Paul Costuros , 20 , of Huntington Beach , was raised by vegetarian hippies . They eventually divorced . He ' ll be spending Thanksgiving with his mother , who now drives a BMW and lives in a house of perfect Southwest design , he says . Though he says his parents have &quot; sold_out , &quot; Paul nonetheless maintains a complete vegan diet , which includes the package of non-dairy chocolate chip cookies he is purchasing at Mother ' s , where he just had dinner with his friend and fellow Golden West College_student , Don Miller , 21 . While Paul plans on contributing spaghetti and tofu to his mother ' s menu , Don will cope_with the holiday in his own rhetorical way . &quot; I ' ll be feasting on stuffing , a dry martini and a cigarette , &quot; he says . * Studies show 12.4 million Americans consider themselves vegetarian , says Lige Weill , president of the Vegetarian Awareness Network , a national nonprofit organization in Washington , D.C. , established in 1980 . An Illinois-based group called Teen-age Resource Unlimited says a quarter of all American teen-agers are vegetarian , while the National Restaurant Assn . notes that at least 15 % of college_students lead a vegetarian lifestyle . &quot; And it ' s definitely on the rise , &quot; Weill says . Fewer than 10 % of vegetarians say they are completely vegan -- exclusive of all animal and dairy_products . Others generally consider themselves either ovo-lacto , meaning they eat eggs , milk , cheese and other dairy_products , or lacto -- they eat some dairy , with the exception of eggs . Of the 250 employees of the two Mother ' s stores ( the other is in Costa Mesa ) , about 65 % are vegetarian , most of them in their 20s , says Kelly Henry , who manages the Huntington Beach store . &quot; that ' s usually the reason they come_to work here. &quot; His store sold 150 free-range turkeys this Thanksgiving , as well as plenty of meatless turkey substitutes . Toward the rear of the store , clerk Johnnie Renna is pointing_out meat and dairy substitutes available to lure the omnivore : Rice Dream , Tuno , Wham , Soysage , Not Dogs , Sweet Nothings , Nyetnaise , Phoney Bologna , to name a_few . Renna , 23 , of Costa Mesa , calls himself an on-again-off-again ovo-lacto vegetarian . He was off again recently during a cross-country backpacking trip in Montana , where to rebuff a good porterhouse_steak is generally thought to be un-American . &quot; There wasn ' t a health_food store for miles , &quot; says Renna , who attributes his vegetarianism to &quot; health and money reasons. &quot; Now he ' s on again . &quot; I ' m a fruits and vegetables guy , &quot; he says . &quot; My parents think this stuff is really weird , but to me it ' s just food -- it ' s just a tamale . &quot; Renna remembers as a child the warm and pungent tuna sandwiches dripping with mayonnaise , oil and butter that filled his school lunch box . Today , tuna comes packed in water and is generally dolphin safe . For 10 years , Renna ' s father has battled one form of cancer or another , a fact the younger Renna says has influenced his own eating habits . &quot; You gotta make_it easy for people or they won ' t do_it , &quot; he says , waving his arms in a wide arc toward the freezer . &quot; By eating animal_products you take_on certain karma , &quot; says lacto-vegetarian Mark Drake , 24 , of Costa Mesa . &quot; The less karma you accrue in life , the lighter your being becomes. &quot; Raised in Texas , Drake says he got caught_up in some typical modes of rebellion -- alcohol and other destructive behaviors -- as the result of a repressive upbringing . Being a vegetarian , he says , offered something different . &quot; There was utter repression of everyone in my family . It was because of how my parents acted with one another . They were always holding things inward , and that block of anger was really repressive , &quot; says Drake , who is spending the day with his wife , Christy ' s , family . &quot; Every time I see someone yelling , I think they should eat less meat. &quot;</TEXT>
