   <HEADLINE> A DIFFERENT KIND OF COURT TV ; HIGH-TECH SYSTEM MAY HELP SIMPSON JURORS SEE EVIDENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Much of America will be glued to the tube during the O.J. Simpson murder trial , so why should the people in the courtroom be any different ? Yes , the big screen is coming_to the courtroom of Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito . Make that two really big screens -- 67-inchers , to be exact -- onto which visual evidence will be beamed for the benefit of jurors and courtroom spectators . The ultra-tech , interactive Evidence Presentation System was loaned to the court by a Los Angeles company called Trial Presentation Technologies , which is hoping to get business from free publicity during the trial , which is to begin next month . Neither the prosecution nor the defense has yet promised to use the new equipment , which has only been used before in civil cases and will have its criminal case premiere during a less-celebrated murder case Monday . If attorneys in the Simpson case decide to use the system , they can take_advantage of features including : * Instant translation of a court reporter ' s coded shorthand into plain English , which would appear on courtroom computer_screens as the reporter typed . * The 67-inch screens -- one for the jury , one for the spectators -- capable of displaying evidence including documents , photographs , charts , videos or even animation . * Computer monitors on the witness_stand , on the judge ' s bench , and on the defense and prosecution tables , that would be used to view the evidence and the instant testimony . * Technological wizardry that can superimpose documents on moving pictures . Portions of the documents also can be instantly enlarged or shrunk before the jury ' s eyes or circled with a colored light_pen by a witness sitting 10 feet away . * Two consulting companies , also working for free , will be available to advise the lawyers on the pros and cons of the technology -- including whether it would be appropriate to display gory crime scene pictures on such huge screens . It ' s not &quot; cyber-justice , &quot; to crib a term Superior_Court Judge George Trammell used Friday while describing the technology to reporters , but it is a tool for helping jurors understand sometimes complicated or hard-to-see evidence as it is presented , rather than some time later during deliberations . Trammell , the court ' s in-house computer_technology supervisor , has been helping set_up court computer_systems for about three years and has been using some Evidence Presentation System equipment in his courtroom since June . He persuaded Ito to take_advantage of the technology for the widely watched Simpson case . Pamela Huenke , managing partner of TPT , said the equipment -- which alone would cost as much as $ 150 # 000 -- will be installed before the trial ' s scheduled Sept . 19 start and will be available to both sides , even if they choose not to use it . * Suzanne Childs , speaking on behalf of Deputy Dist . Attys . Marcia Clark , Bill Hodgman and Lisa Kahn , said the prosecutors had not had a chance to examine the TPT system and so did not know if they would take_advantage of it . The same was the case for Robert L . Shapiro , lead attorney for Simpson , who has pleaded not_guilty to the June 12 slayings in Brentwood of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman . His decision , Shapiro said , will depend_on &quot; the type of evidence we use and how we ' re going to use it. &quot; John Swenson , a Los Angeles attorney who is not involved in the Simpson case , has used the technology twice in civil proceedings . He said it &quot; leads to a better administration of the system of justice &quot; because jurors can see evidence such_as documents with their own eyes , up close , as it is being presented and testified to . &quot; Normally they would n ' t see a document until deliberations , &quot; Swenson said , adding that by that time -- in some cases months later -- they may have forgotten what the testimony pertaining to it was all about . The same would be true of photographs and charts , which are now often displayed on a bulletin_board just inches away from witness who are testifying , but several feet from some jurors . The new evidence display methods will require that charts , photographs and other materials be &quot; imaged &quot; and computerized by a TPT technician , who will work for free . If there are some materials that one side does not want the other to see until the jury does , consultants outside the court will have to prepare them for the computer and they will be entered &quot; under tight security , &quot; Trammell said . Even with so_much high_technology in the courtroom , the potential for human error remains . To minimize the chance of some forbidden document making an unscheduled appearance on the big screen , Judge Ito will be equipped with a &quot; kill switch &quot; that would shut_off the equipment instantly . State_of_the_Art A high-tech computer_system will be available in the courtroom during the O.J. Simpson murder trial . The system , with computer monitors at various locations and large-screen displays for he jury and spectators , is being installed by a Los Angeles firm for the duration of the trial . Documents , charts , photographs , videos and animations can be shown on the computer monitors and the larger screens . Here is a look_at how the system can be used . * Judge : Reviews transcripts or evidence before they are seen by jury and spectators . * Jury and spectators : View evidence and other items on high-resolution , wide-screen monitors . * Court Reporter : Electronically translates stenographer ' s notes into English for showing on the monitors . * Witness : Sees evidence while the same material is shown in other parts of the courtroom . Can also make notes on the monitor using a &quot; light_pen &quot; that will be visible to others in the courtroom . * Technology : Evidence is displayed from the main computer after it is admitted by the judge , who can order any monitors turned_off at any time . * Attorneys : View transcripts or search for earlier testimony . While at podium , they can annotated evidence with &quot; light_pen &quot; . Source : Trial Presentation Technologies</TEXT>
