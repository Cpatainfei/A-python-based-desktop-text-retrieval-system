   <HEADLINE> ZULU LEADER NEARS DEAL TO END S . AFRICA VOTE BOYCOTT ; ELECTIONS : BUTHELEZI HINTS OF ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY . ACCORD WOULD HELP HALT VIOLENCE IN NATAL PROVINCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi appeared on the verge Monday of making a deal that could end months of battles with the government and the African National Congress and lift the biggest remaining obstacle to this nation ' s first all-race elections . In a surprise six-hour meeting , Buthelezi , President Frederik W . de Klerk and ANC Secretary_General Cyril Ramaphosa hammered_out broad outlines of an agreement to end the Inkatha Freedom Party ' s boycott of next week ' s elections and , South_Africans hope , help bring peace to the warring people in Natal province . Details were sketchy , and negotiators , worried about scuttling the accord in its infancy , were reluctant to say too_much publicly . But sources said that if ANC President Nelson Mandela agrees to the deal worked_out by his negotiators , he will interrupt a campaign swing through the eastern Cape province and return to join the talks , due_to resume today . And , late Monday , ANC officials in the Cape said Mandela was headed back to Johannesburg . &quot; The discussions have gone very well , &quot; a smiling Buthelezi told reporters on the steps outside De Klerk ' s office in Pretoria . And he added that &quot; we may have something positive to announce &quot; today . Government and ANC officials also sounded optimistic , though they noted that only a week remains before the nationwide voting begins next Tuesday . &quot; Time is running_out , but there is always time to find solutions , &quot; De Klerk said . Added Ramaphosa : &quot; We are dealing with very sensitive matters , as you all know . And we are trying everything to see what is possible. &quot; Hopes of a breakthrough in the impasse with Inkatha have been raised and dashed time and again in recent months , but Buthelezi ' s position had hardened and the killing continued . Since De Klerk declared a state of emergency in Natal on March 31 , almost 240 people have been killed there in attacks and counterattacks by supporters of Inkatha and the ANC . An international mediation team , headed by former Secretary_of_State Henry A . Kissinger , gave_up before it could even start its work last week when the parties could not agree on the ground_rules for their talks . But political analysts saw important differences this time . For one thing , Buthelezi made a major shift Monday in his bargaining position , backing_down , for example , from his demand that the April 26-28 elections be postponed ; that demand had sent the international mediation team packing . &quot; I don ' t think there is any possibility of postponing the elections , &quot; Buthelezi said . &quot; I would prefer a postponement , but I am a realist. &quot; Buthelezi also apparently abandoned his insistence that the homeland of KwaZulu , which he controls , be given full autonomy under the Zulu king , Goodwill Zwelithini -- Buthelezi ' s nephew . The ANC has said it will give the Zulu monarchy greater_powers and privileges as well as a secure place in the country ' s new constitution . But the ANC and the government have refused to grant autonomy to the old Zulu kingdom . Analysts said another positive sign was the decision of the Inkatha Youth Brigade to cancel a workers strike planned for today . Earlier , it had canceled plans to stage a march Monday to ANC headquarters in Johannesburg , which the police had declared illegal . But , taking no chances , police put_up razor wire around the ANC building Monday and blocked_off roads in part of downtown . &quot; When there are discussions , there is always hope , &quot; said Roelf Meyer , the government constitutional affairs minister who joined the talks Monday . And De Klerk said he hoped &quot; something constructive will come_out of it. &quot; The only way to end the violence in South_Africa is to remove its underlying cause , De Klerk said . In the past , he has identified that cause as the long rivalry between Inkatha and the ANC , which has resulted in 20 # 000 deaths in Natal province in the past decade . &quot; We must remove that if we really want to bring reconciliation and peace to our country , &quot; the president said . Even as the talks were continuing Monday , violence flared anew in townships near Johannesburg . In Thokoza , southeast of Johannesburg , Inkatha supporters holed_up in a hostel exchanged fire with ANC &quot; self-defense units &quot; and members of the new National Peacekeeping Force , deployed in the region just three days ago . Among those killed Monday was Ken Oosterbroek , 31 , a photographer for the Star newspaper in Johannesburg who last week was named South_Africa ' s photographer of the year . Hospital officials said he died of a broken neck while running_for cover from gunfire . Oosterbroek was the second journalist killed this year in South_Africa . Another photographer , Greg Marinovich , a free-lancer for Newsweek magazine who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1991 , was seriously wounded by gunfire but was reported in stable condition . The resurgence of violence in Thokoza was a worrying development . A full return of the ANC-Inkatha war to the country ' s largest urban_area , which has been relatively quiet for months , could seriously damage the credibility of next week ' s voting -- the first all-race elections in 350 years of white domination . It also marked a rocky beginning for the blue-uniformed National Peacekeeping Force , a unit of former ANC guerrillas and government army soldiers formed to combat township unrest . More_than 1 # 400 of the heavily armed peacekeepers , riding armored vehicles , had been deployed in the region to replace South_African Defense Force_units . Army_units were sent_back into the area late Monday to restore peace . If Buthelezi decides that Inkatha will participate in the election , it will raise difficult logistic problems for the Independent Electoral Commission . Most of the 80 million ballots , for example , already have been printed -- without Inkatha ' s name on them . Although it might be too late for Buthelezi to be included on national ballots , the party could possibly contest elections for the regional government in Natal province . Analysts say the ANC and the government , while steadfastly opposed to postponing the election , might be willing to delay regional voting in Natal . Natal includes the KwaZulu homeland . But after the elections , KwaZulu will become part of South_Africa , and Buthelezi ' s administration , including his police_force , will be dissolved . No one knows for_sure whether Inkatha could muster a credible election campaign in the short time remaining . Some political analysts say Inkatha supporters might be confused by the sudden change in direction . But the party , which claims 2 million members , is a fairly cohesive group with a network of local chiefs who could get the word out quickly . Recent public_opinion_polls in Natal , where Inkatha is strongest , indicate that about 50 % of potential voters support the ANC , compared with 25 % for Inkatha and 19 % for De Klerk ' s National Party . If Inkatha does not participate , analysts have said , at least some of its supporters might vote for the National Party . Inkatha ' s vow to boycott the election has cast doubt on the ability of election monitors to stage a free , fair poll in Natal province , Buthelezi ' s home base and scene of years of bloody ethnic and political conflict . Many people in Natal have said they fear casting ballots in the region , where 26 people died in political violence over the weekend . Some worry that Inkatha supporters might attack polling_stations and burn homes of people who leave on election_days to vote . At first , election officials planned to open 1 # 600 polling_stations in the province . But the police and army complained that their force of 2 # 000 could not adequately guard so many sites . The number has since been reduced to about 1 # 000 , mostly schools in the region . But the security_forces said Monday that they would like to see the number brought_down to 750 .</TEXT>
