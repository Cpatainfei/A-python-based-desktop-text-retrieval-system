   <HEADLINE> AND STILL ANOTHER PHONY PEACE PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During President Clinton ' s recent visit to France , the United States renewed its commitment to a peace plan assigning 51 % of Bosnia-Herzegovina to its Muslim-Croat majority and 49 % to its Serb minority . Inconveniently , the Bosnian Serbs now hold not 49 % but 72 % of Bosnia ' s territory , which leaves one-fifth of the country in_dispute . The Serbs are not going_to give the disputed territory back . The French and Americans are not going_to take it back . So_much for the agreement . At a tense meeting this week in Geneva , the belligerents agreed to a one-month cease-fire . This is inconsequential . Real forward movement is not likely to come either in wrangling over the details of the partition map or in the making and breaking of cease-fires . In a daring economic move , Serbia has made its dinar convertible with the German mark . Some predict that after a brief boom , Belgrade -- which has only a_few months ' hard-currency reserves -- will face a devastating economic collapse . Others , however , claim that this move coupled with a weakening European will to maintain the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations on Serbia has made the sanctions moot . If the latter view is correct ( and the next few months will tell ) , then the threat of lifting the sanctions is also moot as a form of pressure on the Muslims and Croats . Meanwhile , U.S. congressional pressure for a unilateral U.S. breach of the arms embargo on the former Yugoslav republics continues to grow . On Thursday , ignoring pleas from the White_House , the House of Representatives voted by a strong 244-178 margin to lift the embargo . The Senate has already voted 50-49 for the same action . Neither chamber is likely to override a Clinton veto , but Clinton may find the political cost of a veto prohibitive . If both the sanctions and the embargo are abandoned , the Balkans war may evolve into a new kind of civil_war pitting Serbia against a rearming alliance of Croatia , Bosnia-Herzegovina and , unofficially , Slovenia -- with a fifth_column of ethnic Hungarians and Albanians within Serbia . &quot; The Geneva agreement is merely a one-month calm before an unprecedented storm and a prelude to total conflict , &quot; the Bosnian Serb leadership ' s SRNA news_agency said late Wednesday . The partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been urged as the best possible outcome under the circumstances . But since no coalition of major_powers intends to impose the partition , this outcome becomes as moot as the sanctions and the embargo . In short , the war is overwhelmingly likely to escalate . And in that case , an unpleasant question could begin to become inescapable : Which side should the United States support ? The current paradox is that all_the major_powers , by refusing to intervene and insisting on negotiations , have made negotiations virtually meaningless and neutrality increasingly difficult to maintain .</TEXT>
