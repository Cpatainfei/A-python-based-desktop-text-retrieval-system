   <HEADLINE> A NEEDLESS NEW RISK OF BREAST_CANCER ; BIOTECH : THERE ARE WELL- FOUNDED SUSPICIONS ABOUT MILK FROM COWS TREATED WITH THE NEW GROWTH_HORMONE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Food and Drug Administration recently warned dairy producers , distributors and retailers against &quot; hormone-free &quot; labels on milk from cows that have not been given the biotech milk-production stimulant known as recombinant bovine growth_hormone . The FDA states that such labeling could be &quot; false or misleading &quot; under federal law , as there is &quot; no significant difference between milk from treated and untreated cows. &quot; Monsanto , maker of the hormone , is already suing one large Midwest milk producer for using the label . The confusing FDA guidelines were , according to the consumer publication Daily Citizen , written by Deputy Commissioner Michael Taylor , a former counsel for Monsanto and a biotech umbrella organization . The guidelines are scientifically flawed and reckless and reflect flagrant disregard of consumers ' right to know . Furthermore , the FDA ignores evidence linking milk from treated cows with increased risk of breast_cancer . The concerns , based on published research : * The biotech hormone induces a marked and sustained increase in levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 , or IGF-1 , in cow ' s milk . * IGF-1 regulates cell growth , division and differentiation , particularly in infants . While human and normal bovine IGF-1 are identical , they are largely bound to protein and thus probably less biologically active than the unbound IGF-1 in treated milk . * IGF-1 is not destroyed by pasteurization or digestion and is readily absorbed across the intestinal wall . In a 1990 FDA publication disclosing toxicity tests conducted by Monsanto , feeding the hormone ( trade_name Posilac ) to mature rats for only two weeks resulted in statistically significant increases in body and liver weights and bone length . These effects were seen at a small fraction of injected doses given to control rats . But by gerrymandering these explicit data , the FDA alleged that IGF-1 &quot; lacks oral toxicity. &quot; Neither the FDA nor Monsanto has investigated the effects of long-term feeding of IGF-1 and treated milk on growth , or on more sensitive sub-cellular effects in infant rats or infants of any other species . * Cows injected with the biotech hormone show heavy localization of IGF-1 in breast ( udder ) epithelial_cells ; this does not occur in untreated cows . * IGF-1 induces rapid division and multiplication of normal human breast epithelial_cells in tissue cultures . * It is highly likely that IGF-1 promotes transformation of normal breast epithelium to breast_cancer . * IGF-1 maintains the malignancy of human breast-cancer cells , including their invasiveness and ability to spread to distant organs . * The breast tissues of female fetuses and infants are sensitive to hormonal influences . Imprinting by IGF-1 may increase future breast-cancer risks and sensitivity of the breast to subsequent unrelated risks such_as mammography and the carcinogenic and estrogen-like effects of pesticide residues in food , particularly in pre-menopausal women . These concerns are not new . In a 1989 letter to the FDA , I warned that the effects of IGF-1 &quot; could include premature growth stimulation in infants , ( breast enlargement ) in young children and breast_cancer in adult females. &quot; More recently , the Council on Scientific Affairs of the American Medical Assn . stated : &quot; Further studies will be required to determine whether the ingestion of higher than normal concentrations of bovine insulin-like growth factor is safe for children , adolescents and adults. &quot; The opposite of &quot; further study &quot; is uncontrolled , unlabeled sales of treated milk to unwitting consumers . Apart from risks of breast_cancer and other IGF-1 effects , the FDA and industry have downplayed additional differences between hormonal and non-hormonal milk . The FDA-approved label insert for Posilac , a pamphlet that only dairy_farmers see , admits that its &quot; use is associated with increased frequency of use of medication in cows for mastitis and other health problems. &quot; Monsanto ' s own data further show_up to an 80 % incidence of mastitis , an udder infection , in hormone-treated cattle and resulting contamination of milk with statistically significant levels of pus ; this will necessitate virtually routine use of antibiotics , with attendant risks of allergic_reactions and antibiotic resistance . Congress should insist that , at the very least , the FDA immediately revoke its restrictions on labeling of milk from untreated cows . More prudently , it should ban the use of these hormones .</TEXT>
