   <HEADLINE> HARRAH ' S , TRIBE PLAN $ 22-MILLION CASINO ; GAMBLING : THE PROJECT SHOWS MAINSTREAM GAMING INDUSTRY ' S WILLINGNESS TO VENTURE INTO RESERVATION PARTNERSHIPS IN CALIFORNIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Following the foray of Caesars World into California Indian gaming , Harrah ' s Casinos disclosed Wednesday that it will develop a gambling hall on a reservation in northern San Diego County . Harrah ' s officials and tribal leaders of the Pala band of Mission Indians will formally announce plans today to build a $ 22-million bingo and card club casino on the Pala reservation , 50 miles north of San Diego and 85 miles southeast of Los Angeles . The announcement reflects a growing willingness of mainstream casinos to join California tribes in bringing a flavor of Las Vegas to the state , rather than resist the spread of gambling to California as a threat to their Nevada business . The move also reflects efforts by gaming giants to capitalize on reservation gambling in California in the face of resistance to the spread of gambling elsewhere . &quot; Indian gaming is an attractive area because a lot of jurisdictions voted_down gaming ( in elections ) last month , &quot; Harrah ' s spokesman Steve Brewster said . &quot; With Indian gaming , we don ' t have to worry about legislative procedures or referendums . We can go_in , get the approvals , and we ' re there. &quot; Brewster said the Pala reservation was considered an excellent site to attract day-trippers because of its location on California 76 six miles east of Interstate 15 . The San Diego-Riverside thoroughfare carries about 55 # 000 vehicles a day , he said . Caesars World announced plans two years ago to develop a $ 25-million casino on the Agua Caliente Indian_reservation in downtown Palm Springs . That project has been stalled by lawsuits . As is the case with Caesars , Harrah ' s -- the casino division of the Promus Cos . -- said it would not introduce electronic slot_machines to California , which are banned by the state but are nonetheless used by a handful of Indian tribes . More_than 2 # 000 electronic slot_machines are now available for play_on three other San Diego County reservations . About half of the proposed 61 # 000-square-foot Pala casino will be dedicated to bingo , table_games and pull tabs , Harrah ' s said . The facility also will feature a restaurant , lounge and retail shops . The 900-member Pala band now gets most of its income by leasing land to a sand and gravel company . Tribal secretary Stan McGarr said the gaming facility is expected to generate more_than $ 1 million annually for the tribe . &quot; We really hope to find economic self-sufficiency through this , &quot; he said . McGarr said the facility is expected to open in about a year , after approval by the National Indian Gaming Commission . Later this month , Harrah ' s will open a casino on the Ak-Chin Indian_Reservation outside Phoenix , and has signed agreements to develop Indian casinos in Washington state and in Alabama . The Memphis-based company operates 14 casinos in seven states .</TEXT>
