   <HEADLINE> PROGRAM AIMS TO BRING POLICE AND COMMUNITY CLOSER TOGETHER ; CRIME : LAPD OFFICER IN PACOIMA IS PAID BY GRANT INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE PREVENTION AND LONG-TERM PROBLEM SOLVING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Officer Hank Stockdale of the Los Angeles Police_Department is paid from a $ 4-million federal grant designed to help bring peace to urban war zones . But the price of the framed picture of John Wayne -- so far the only decoration in his week-old Pacoima office -- came_out of_his_own pocket . &quot; I have no illusions about being the new sheriff in town , &quot; said Stockdale , a 6-foot , 200-pound mustachioed blond who nonetheless looks and acts the part . &quot; But if I can make a difference , then I ' m 100 % successful. &quot; Stockdale ' s new job is to bring the department closer to the community it serves -- in this case , a largely Latino neighborhood that surrounds a rough stretch of Van Nuys Boulevard east of the Golden State Freeway . He is one of 54 officers who will be working citywide , using grant money the Clinton_Administration has awarded to financially strapped cities . The two-year grant , which is augmented by $ 9 million in city funds , is intended to encourage community-based policing , which emphasizes prevention and long-term problem_solving . &quot; We need to place police_officers in places where they can more closely interact and get feedback from the community , &quot; said Sgt . Ron Tingle of the LAPD ' s Office of Operations , which coordinated the grant . Stockdale ' s new duties will include regular office hours at a Van Nuys Boulevard storefront from 9 to 11 a.m. , Monday through Friday . The rest of the day , Stockdale meets with local shop owners and patrols the streets in his black-and-white . * Although the new job frees him from the obligation to respond to radio calls , Stockdale , like most officers , usually wants to swing by to see what is going_on , especially if the call is close enough and interesting enough . And in this part of the Valley , there is no shortage of interesting calls -- for police , anyway . The neighborhood , patrolled by the Foothill Division , ranks as one of the poorest and least educated in the San Fernando Valley . Although the overall per-capita crime_rate in the division fell between 1981 and 1992 , the area is among the Valley ' s worst for homicides and aggravated assault . It lags behind other Valley police divisions in the number of robberies and burglaries , perhaps because its widespread poverty makes other communities more attractive to thieves . The economic options for many here range from welfare to minimum-wage jobs . About one-third of adults in the adjoining communities of Pacoima and Arleta have less than a ninth-grade education , according to the 1990 U.S. Census . About one-quarter speak little or no English . More_than one-third of the area ' s residents are not U.S. citizens ; 70 % are Latino . Entrepreneurial choices on this part of Van Nuys Boulevard include selling aluminum cans to Tony ' s Recycling Center at 92 cents a pound and selling pea-sized bits of street-corner cocaine for the equivalent of $ 44 # 000 a pound . Drug dealing is a lure that accounts_for at least half the area ' s crime , Stockdale said . It ' s almost impossible to catch burglars -- often drug_addicts -- who are in and out of houses in a flash . But catch somebody in a drug deal and essentially you ' ve caught a burglar the easy way , since many who steal are trying to support a $ 150- to $ 200-a-day drug habit , Stockdale said . The street here is a mix of struggling retail_stores , doughnut shops , liquor_stores , restaurants , bars , car-repair shops and storefront churches . Bright banners announcing the 1994 World Cup Soccer hang from street lights , offering a splash of color . During the day , Van Nuys Boulevard is busy . The sidewalks fill with pedestrians , mostly what Stockdale calls the area ' s decent people . At night , the same streets fill with predators , he said . &quot; My first goal is to start cleaning_up Van Nuys Boulevard , &quot; said the 28-year-old graduate of Granada Hills High_School and Cal State Los Angeles . &quot; If I work my ass off for three to six months , we ' ll probably see a difference. &quot; He believes he was picked for the job because he is an aggressive self-starter , an officer who makes arrests and doesn ' t need much supervision . Stockdale decided on police work while in high_school after being angered by the 1983 shooting death of LAPD motorcycle officer Paul Verna in Pacoima . He spent his day_off last weekend painting the office , an 8-by-13-foot room located inside the Avtech language_school at the Plaza del Sol shopping_center . During an afternoon patrol , Stockdale is constantly punching license_plate numbers into his car computer -- checking for stolen cars , cars with outstanding warrants , crooks on the lam . He checks the plates of expensive cars , which stand_out in this poor neighborhood , as well as cars filled with teen-agers . &quot; What ' s up ? &quot; he calls to three teen-age boys sitting on a couch that someone has left on the sidewalk . He asks where they got the expensive mountain_bike . One boy says he bought_it , he ' s got a good job . &quot; Doing what ? &quot; Stockdale wants to know . Cleaning planes at Van Nuys Airport , the boy says . * Satisfied , Stockdale moves_on . Punching_in more license_plates , stopping wherever youths are gathered_in groups -- to say hi , to ask questions and yell a little , sounding a lot like a stern father , even though he is at most 10 years older than those he questions . He follows an older Toyota carrying two men that is taking a circuitous route through alleys and back_streets and finally ends_up at one of the few banks in the area . They turn_out to be employees at a local gas_station . Their boss , fearing robbery , orders his staff to take such a route when they deposit the day ' s receipts . Stockdale -- who grew_up in the Valley but like many fellow officers now lives about 50 miles away -- took the job in part &quot; to prove I was more_than a gung-ho street cop. &quot; But he cannot resist a drive through San Fernando Gardens , a public-housing project where Latino gangs have taken_control from black gangs , due largely to the changing demographics of the past decade . Gonzalez Park , across the street , is a regular drug-buying area , where sellers can easily hide their wares under a clump of grass should they spy a police_car . Three teen-agers spot Stockdale ' s car and turn_to run . He accelerates through the parking_lot and gives chase , but they have a head_start and soon disappear into the housing complex . A group of older_men watch and laugh . &quot; How long you think they ' ll be running ? &quot; Stockdale yells . He spins the car around the corner but the teen-agers are long gone . Instead , two youngsters wave and ask_for baseball_cards , which LAPD officers give_away by the box load every spring . &quot; Up until they are about 8 years old , the kids here love the police , &quot; Stockdale said . &quot; After that , it ' s not so cool to wave . . . . Some of these people are lost , but if we can get_to the kids , get them started off right , they still have a chance to be a decent human being. &quot; In December , Stockdale himself became a father ; his wife gave_birth to a girl . The family lives in an 1 # 800-square-foot house in the mountains about 20 miles west of Lancaster . At night , &quot; It ' s so quiet that the sound of the crickets and frogs is deafening , &quot; Stockdale said . &quot; that ' s the way I like it. &quot;</TEXT>
