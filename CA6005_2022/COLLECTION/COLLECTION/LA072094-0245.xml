   <HEADLINE> THE FORGOTTEN VICTIMS ; EVERY YEAR AT LEAST 3 MILLION AMERICAN CHILDREN WITNESS THE BATTERING OR KILLING OF ONE OF THEIR PARENTS . THEY RARELY GET_OVER THE TRAUMA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They are the invisible victims -- peering eyes and straining ears -- watching and listening_in horror to the kicks and punches and shouts . They are the children who witness one parent brutalizing another . Usually it is a father savaging a mother with fists or words or both . Usually it is a mess -- loud , ugly and vulgar . Sometimes there is blood . Always there is unfathomable anger . Every year at least 3 million American children 3 to 17 are exposed to this at-home violence , according to Richard Gellis , a University of Rhode Island professor who has spent 25 years researching domestic violence . This sometimes daily shattering of the family order is a betrayal by the very people they depend_on for security . Most kids never recover . Last year , 1 # 421 women died at the hands of their husbands or partners , Gellis says . In three-quarters of those cases , a child was watching . The children of O.J. and Nicole Brown Simpson have been out of the public_eye for the six weeks since their mother was murdered and their father accused of the crime . Sydney , 9 , and Justin , 6 , who were supposedly asleep during the fatal attack , are coping well , according to family reports . But if reports of domestic violence in the Simpson household are true , these children , like others in similar situations , may face problems in the future . At least they have the means to get counseling . Most kids don ' t have a chance to unravel the complicated trauma that results from observing violence . Instead they must spend years under the specter of a violent father and demoralized mother . The experts -- psychologists , researchers , sociologists and child advocates -- fault &quot; the system &quot; for not rescuing these children . There are shelters and programs to protect battered women ; the legal_system is supposed to chase the battering man . But unless children are themselves abused , they are frequently left to shuffle behind a shellshocked mother on her road to assistance or simply live amid violence . &quot; When people rush in to help a family caught_up in violence , the children are too often forgotten , &quot; says Deanne Tilton Durfee , executive_director of the Los Angeles County Inter-Agency Council on Child_Abuse and Neglect . There may be action to remove custody of the children from the father , but across the country there will be no special attention to their emotional needs , adds Durfee , who is also chair of the U.S. Advisory Board on Child_Abuse . &quot; In L.A. County , we are just beginning to put_together a list of therapists and grief counselors , &quot; she says . &quot; But I fear for all those children quietly living a lie. &quot; In part , the problem is that laws involving child_abuse , battered women and child abduction evolved separately during the late 1970s and 1980s . And advocates for the various groups often compete for the same government dollars , which means children ' s needs often are lost in the competitive shuffle . &quot; These problems are all_of a piece but unfortunately the laws were all made like chopped liver , &quot; says Kathryn Turman , a child advocate in Virginia working for a nonprofit group there . &quot; If legislators would give_up their committee chairmanships and work together , we could have a coherent strategy to help kids. &quot; In an experimental program to coordinate services for victimized children in the Tampa , Fla. , area , police are being trained to at least be aware if there are children home when they respond to domestic abuse calls . &quot; Cops are among the few public officials to regularly make house calls , &quot; Turman says . &quot; They should know if there are kids home. &quot; * Turman went_along with two sheriff ' s deputies responding to a beating complaint . The deputies , who had been to this home several times , said they didn ' t know if the couple had children . This time , while one deputy was subduing the fuming man , the other noticed a spelling book on a coffee_table and began to search . Finally , in the master_bedroom , she heard a noise coming from the closet . Inside , three small children were huddled_together . The older brother had a gun . Whenever a fight broke_out , he would grab the gun and hide the other children . &quot; The Tampa police , the sheriff ' s department , any number of people had been in that house without paying any attention to those kids , &quot; Turman says . As part of this project a new question was added_to the police incident report : &quot; Is a Child Present ? &quot; If that box is checked , several other questions are asked and the information about the children is fed into a computer that draws reports from other agencies that deal with_children . &quot; The ultimate goal is to identify kids who are victims of abuse or maltreatment and deal with them , &quot; Turman says . About half the children who witness their mothers being beaten are also abused themselves , numerous studies confirm . But Gellis says it ' s actually much worse for the children to watch abuse than to receive it . &quot; The learning experience is stronger , &quot; he says . &quot; There are more suicide attempts , more dysfunction in school , more likelihood of violence later in life , more withdrawal . More everything. &quot; Witnessing domestic violence affects children of different ages in different ways . The problems can start in the womb . Several studies suggest that mothers who report high levels of stress during pregnancy , such_as from violence , tend to have babies who are hyperactive and developmentally delayed . Very young children often have the worst physical reactions . One psychologist recalled treating a toddler who would spontaneously get diarrhea every time his parents started fighting . More typically the younger children exhibit a type of social autism : They speak very little , show self-destructive behavior , cling_to their caretakers and suffer short-term depression , sleep_disorders and heavy separation anxiety . Gellis says he has seen children as young as 4 show signs of post-traumatic stress syndrome , usually associated with rape victims or Vietnam veterans . &quot; It ' s very scary to see this in one so young , &quot; he says . Older children and teen-agers tend to try to get_in between their parents in what has been dubbed &quot; the Bill_Clinton phenomenon. &quot; As a young teen , Clinton reportedly stood_up to his mother ' s second husband several times , but on one pivotal occasion in 1960 grabbed his stepfather by the arm , looked him in the eye and said &quot; Hear me . Never ever touch my mother again. &quot; Such a dramatic stand can be physically risky , but sometimes the child is emboldened by an emotional need to make things &quot; right. &quot; * The children who seem to suffer the most are ages 5 to 10 , according to most experts . They know what ' s going_on but they ' re too_little and too weak to do anything about it . They experience hopelessness and sometimes thoughts of suicide ; they often get headaches and stomachaches ; they can become utterly passive and numb , or uncontrollably violent . To recover , a child needs careful counseling -- or at least a special relationship with an empathetic person . &quot; Bill_Clinton talks_about his grandmother , &quot; Gellis says . &quot; She was his anchor . But it didn ' t work for young Roger ( who is 10 years younger ) . He is , as we in the profession call it , the ' clinical symptom carrier ' for that household . He was the troubled one. &quot; Roger Clinton , according to a biography by his mother Virginia Kelley , lost his anchor when older brother Bill went_away to school and he was left alone to witness his father ' s drunken rages against his mother . Whatever the age of the child , the solutions are the same : therapy , a mother who gets help for herself , a caretaker who is nurturing , sympathetic day_care and schools that offer a stable environment . The challenge for school officials and day-care workers is often excavating the truth about what ' s going_on at_home . One barrier is that it ' s just so embarrassing and confusing to children that their parents ' anger can escalate out of control . Betsy McAlister Groves , a social_worker in Boston City Hospital ' s Children Witness to Violence project , says she treated a 7-year-old boy who one week described horrific scenes between his parents and how angry he was at his father . Oddly , though , the very next week he talked_about what his father did_well . &quot; Children are very loyal -- particularly the young ones who , in terms of their moral development , believe might makes right , &quot; Groves says . &quot; This little boy had to be told that his father could both be good and bad. &quot; She says that so many of these children walk_around with an overwhelming sense_of_shame that as they grow older , they believe they are defective people . While these child witnesses have a greater chance of being in violent relationships -- about 40 % repeat the behavior of their parents -- as_many are in danger of becoming numb , desensitized adults who have no relationships at all . Turman and others believe that the movement in family courts to keep families together at all costs is based on a myth that enough therapy can make the violence and pain go_away . Instead , these people believe that the best thing for the children is to get them away from the violent parent . &quot; Only a certain proportion of families can be fixed , &quot; Turman says . &quot; Do we have three or four or five years to experiment with a family ? Not when the children are being damaged. &quot; In fact , it ' s not unusual for children traumatized by domestic violence to cope well initially -- to make_it through school and college and to get jobs -- but then later experience depression and other symptoms . * At 42 , Barbara Corry runs a private consulting_company in Alhambra to educate groups about domestic abuse . But telling her life_story is her real work . For it provides compelling testimony of the ugly legacy of domestic abuse . After all_the therapy , after all her studying to earn a master ' s degree in sociology , after all_the work to unravel her ugly past , Corry ' s voice still shakes at the mention of what she survived . &quot; When I came_along I was supposed to make things better , &quot; she says in a phone interview . &quot; But all my birth did was bring another person into a not-good situation . Corry says her father was an alcoholic who would return home from work drunk two and three times a week and scream at her mother . He would charge at her with a fist in her face ; yell at her ; keep her awake for hours raging that the lettuce on his sandwich was limp or that she hadn ' t sewn his shirt right . Once or twice he punched her , but mostly he restrained himself physically -- which only seemed to increase the intensity of his verbal abuse . &quot; My mother was raised very traditionally , so when she couldn ' t take it anymore she went_to see the priest , &quot; says Corry , referring to a time before she was born and her brother was 7 . &quot; The priest told her to pray for my father and try to be a better wife . He instructed her to have another baby to make things better. &quot; As Corry got a little older , she would try to intervene between her parents . &quot; My cries and my pleas would distract my father or somehow cut the circuits . But it never stopped him. &quot; When her older brother was 16 , he got_into a fistfight with his father and was sent to live with an uncle in Indiana . &quot; I didn ' t want to be sent_away , &quot; Corry says . &quot; My strategy was to shrink_back and to be sweet and cute. &quot; As Corry describes her family during an interview , she keeps switching into the third_person as if to distance herself from such a horrific tale . &quot; My anger was directed inward , &quot; she continues . &quot; I developed a serious eating disorder . I was very shutdown , you know , on automatic_pilot . I think I was stuffing anger , stuffing pain , stuffing myself. &quot; She didn ' t move away from home until she was 25 and received counseling after that . But her brother and mother died -- he of AIDS , she of cancer -- before they could get any emotional help . Corry , who moved to Los Angeles 12 years ago , wrote her father a long letter explaining her feelings . He never wrote back . Their only contact is a Christmas_card each year . &quot; Hope all is_well , &quot; says the card . &quot; Love , Dad. &quot; As she describes the card , Corry chokes and starts talking clinically about &quot; people who are that monstrous. &quot; Later she explains that although she has conquered her compulsive eating problems and made great strides in understanding her family , she has been unable to have a relationship of_her_own . &quot; I saw that it is possible to devastate a person ' s personality and spirit , &quot; she says , her voice again halting and shaky . &quot; You ' ve got_to prove to me you ' re not a ( jerk ) before I get involved . It ' s all terror-based. &quot;</TEXT>
