   <HEADLINE> A DOG ' S LIFE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The story that you printed about the little cockapoo who was rescued from the freeway was very heartwarming . I ' m sure that this story with the photos was responsible_for getting this dog adopted . The diligent work of animal regulation officers and highway patrol officers saved her life once . You saved it a second time . Bringing the follow-up story to our attention , the fact that she would be euthanized ( killed ) because she was unclaimed and unwanted , certainly brought those people to the shelter willing to give her a good an loving home . I hope that this little_dog ' s story helps to make the public aware of just how many wonderful dogs and cats are sitting in our shelters right now , waiting for a home . They don ' t have their pictures in the paper . There are two basic reasons that these animals are sitting in shelter cages . Too many people didn ' t get their animals spayed or neutered . Approximately 18 # 000 animals are killed in our county each year because they are not wanted . The other reason is that people who adopt or purchase an animal do not see this as a lifetime commitment to the pet . At the first sign of a behavior problem in the animal , such_as digging or chewing , instead of working with a reliable animal behavior consultant or even reading a book on training , the animal is discarded . I hope that all_the people who were touched by the story of the little_dog will remember the thousands of others who need loving homes . Some of them will die today . DEBBY MOONEY Ventura * I am writing with_regard_to the article &quot; Fight Grows Over Missing Dog &quot; on Oct . 2 . I am the owner of several dogs and currently have my dogs Identichipped , which is a microchip . The microchip is the AKC-recommended form of identification for dogs . Had Lady / Cassie been microchipped , there would be no questions as_to her identity . The animal control officers could simply pass the scanner over the dog and determine immediately if in fact she was the_Frenches ' dog . Had Lady / Cassie been microchipped , it would have minimized the_Frenches ' heartache , eased Ms . Warwick ' s doubts and saved us the taxpayers the cost , which we will ultimately bear , for the lawsuit and the enforcement . LAUREL McVEY Newbury Park</TEXT>
