   <TEXT> Brazilian authorities Friday will introduce their country ' s sixth currency since 1986.All the others fell victim to hyper-inflation , which has made the notes almost valueless unless carried around in satchels . Consumers , businesses and other currency users have been given ample time to convert their old bills to the new real , which will be pegged in value to the U.S. dollar . The government hopes that this time Brazil will finally achieve a stable currency . Skeptics , however , argue that the plan is a political ploy designed to improve the prospects of its creator , former Finance_Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso , in the Oct . 3 presidential elections .</TEXT>
