   <TEXT> People who spend long periods in strange lands develop unique ways to ward_off the melancholy that descends at odd , unbidden moments , transfixing us with memories that leave us standing naked before the mirror and suddenly late for dinner . An American diplomat I know in Macedonia soothes her homesick nerves by eating Cocoa Puffs straight from the box . A Midwestern journalist who covers Bosnia lugs around a tape_deck , filling the alien air with dulcet harmonies of American folk_music . I shoo_away hearth-sickness -- at least temporarily -- by losing myself inside bookstores and libraries , preferably those with old books . This works best in genteel , slightly frayed dowagers of cities like Sofia and Thessaloniki , which are packed with bookstores that smell of stale talc perfume and evaporated dreams . During a recent four-month stint in the Balkans , I reached for this fix much like any addict . As Sam Cooke would say , it sent me . Books were my panacea against the bitter cold , the car exhaust fumes , the oppressive talk_of blood and death that consumes the Peninsula these days . At the American Center library in Skopje , I met suave newcomers such_as Oscar Hijuelos and renewed relationships with venerable masters such_as Edith Wharton . After making a selection , I trotted home like a dog with a meaty bone . On nights when the winds howled down from Vodno Mountain into the deserted streets , whipping the falling snow into a dry lather , I sat propped_up in bed with my stacked tomes , amulets to protect me from unseen ghosts . The more incongruous my reading was with my locale , the more it transported me . Maybe that ' s the way I filter reality . Prior to my trip , I had spent months engrossed in Balkan history books while Los Angeles shot and burned itself into a frenzy . Now , there was something deliciously dissonant about sitting in a Macedonian cafe listening to the muzzein in the minaret call the faithful to prayer while reading &quot; In Country &quot; by Bobbie Ann Mason , a tale of Vietnam vets , coming of_age in Kentucky and national disillusion . I ordered another Turkish_coffee and turned the page . But I had to put aside Louise Erdrich ' s &quot; Love Medicine &quot; during a visit to Tirana . Albania was too weird and fantastical , as well as a bit sinister , for me to concentrate_on this quintessentially American book about a Native_American family on a Dakota reservation . Maybe it also struck too close to home . Cut_off from the world for decades , ground down by massive unemployment , abject poverty and hardscrabble mountains where little would grow , dominated by tribal law , Albania struck me as one big reservation . Yet it also glowed with the magic_realism that Erdrich evokes so well in her novels . For once I didn ' t need fiction . I found no old bookstores in Albania , which didn ' t surprise me , since the country ' s first university wasn ' t even built until 1957 , as Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha with bloody cruelty wrenched his nation of 3.2 million from feudalism . But poking around musty corners of Central Europe has yielded_up gems over the years , and they have kept my brain from seizing up . In 1989 I spent days haunting antiquarian shops in Budapest -- a book-lover ' s paradise -- reading old travelogues and thin volumes of poetry by a British spinster who penned delicate verses in 1871 about gardens and platonic friendship . How did this century-old book from London wind_up in Hungary , surviving world_wars , cataclysm and Communism , I wondered , growing more interested in its provenance than its author . A worn copy of &quot; A Farewell to Arms &quot; made me muse how many Hungarian eyes had gazed at Papa ' s nuanced prose and vowed to try their own hand at writing . On that trip , I still rue passing_up a leather-bound volume chronicling the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 illustrated with hand-tinted historic photos of men , horses and artillery . It cost $ 20 , which at the time seemed like a lot but now seems absurd . Always a believer in chance encounters , I went_to Bulgaria last fall and scanned the block-long , open-air book market in Sofia ' s Pencho Slaveykov Square for another copy . In the afternoon shade , dealers stomped their feet to keep warm in between swills of rakia -- the harsh grape brandy that lubricates life in the South Balkans . A friendly book-dealer confided that Slaveykov was a Bulgarian symbolist poet of the early 20th Century , on whom that small fierce country once pinned its hopes for a Nobel Prize in literature . In typical Balkan fashion , Slaveykov was undermined when jealous rivals sent an anonymous letter to the committee , denouncing the poet as a traitor and spy . We clicked our tongues over man ' s tragic fate and he tried to interest me in a coffee-table book on Bulgarian icons . But because he still mourned for Slaveykov , his heart wasn ' t in it . Book lovers the world over have a kind of radar for each other . Like members of a secret_society , we reveal ourselves by a strategically dropped word , a gleam that kindles the eye when discussing a favorite author . On a cold and dreary bus ride from Sofia to Skopje , a balding Albanian won my undivided attention by rhapsodizing about Goethe and Schiller . We also shared chalky Turkish chocolate and orange pop . In the languid Greek port city of Thessaloniki , I visited Molho Bookstore , built_in the 1870s on the shopping street Tsimiski and today one of the few remnants of the city ' s once vibrant Jewish culture and intellectual life . As early as 1493 , Jewish book-dealers built the first printing_press in the Balkans here . For almost five centuries , Jews , Turks , Albanians , Bulgarians , Greeks , Vlachs , Kurds and Serbs lived_in relative peace in the land they called Macedonia , yoked by common exigencies of the Ottoman empire . Since the past molds the future while haunting the present , I asked the clerk at Molho ' s for Leon Sciaky ' s elegiac memoir &quot; Farewell to Salonica , &quot; which I learned about from another book , Robert Kaplan ' s recent &quot; Balkan Ghosts. &quot; &quot; Salonica slept , oblivious of gathering forces , &quot; Sciaky wrote , recalling his childhood at the century ' s turn . &quot; In the afternoon it sat in the gaily lighted cafes along the quay sipping apertifs . . . it drank_in the taverns of the back_streets and played backgammon and smoked narghiles . It spoke a dozen tongues and was garbed in as_many costumes . Salonica was in Macedonia , but not of it . It slumbered in blissful ignorance of the passions of which now and then it heard faint rumbles. &quot; The rumbles would reach a bloody crescendo during World_War_II , when the Nazis deported more_than 55 # 000 Salonic Jews to the gas_chambers , wiping_out the truly multicultural world that Sciaky had evoked so vividly . But the black-bearded clerk appraised me silently from behind Molho ' s counter and exhaled heavily . Perhaps he was relieved I wasn ' t looking_for the new Jackie Collins zipper-ripper . &quot; You will have trouble finding that book , &quot; he said gently . &quot; It is a very old and rare title , which is out of print. &quot; Often , searching for an elusive book can be as exhilarating as reading it . Of course , one has better luck in Western Europe ' s bookstores , but their stocks are picked_over , their books pricey and their staffs distinctly capitalist . In 1984 I visited Shakespeare &amp; Co . -- the Paris institution where Sylvia Beach first published James Joyce ' s &quot; Ulysses. &quot; In addition to some bibliophile sightseeing , I wanted to sell &quot; Quartet &quot; by Jean Rhys and &quot; Lithium for Medea &quot; by Kate Braverman . The owner , a cantankerous old_man named George with a white goatee , peered at me through his glasses and said irritably that he couldn ' t give me much for the books because they were too avant-garde to move off his shelves . Inwardly thrilled by his assessment of my literary tastes , I accepted his meager francs and bought &quot; The Ariel Poems &quot; by Sylvia Plath . It didn ' t occur to me until later that night , back in the seventh-floor walk-up of my Latin_Quarter garret , that Shakespeare &amp; Co . was the ne_plus_ultra of avant-garde Boho Paris and that George had parlayed my puerile vanity to his advantage . That was one of the few times books failed to allay the melancholy that descended with the speed of a hungry raptor . But since I was in France , I consoled myself with Bordeaux and foie_gras .</TEXT>
