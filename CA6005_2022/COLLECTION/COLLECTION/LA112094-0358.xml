   <HEADLINE> CHURCHES THAT FOUGHT 187 NOW SOUL-SEARCHING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Only days after the passage of Proposition 187 , Dr. Samuel Scheibler ' s tiny congregation moved quickly to help children who may one day be affected by the controversial initiative that prohibits education , social_services and all but emergency health_care to illegal immigrants . St . Albans , a 70-member ethnically mixed Anglican_church in Brea , began to organize a tutorial program , anticipating that undocumented immigrant children may ultimately be kicked_out of school under provisions of the sweeping initiative overwhelmingly approved by voters Nov . 8 . &quot; We take the position that the people of California have the right to pass ballot initiatives , and we don ' t dispute the fact that illegal immigrants are , after all , illegal , &quot; Scheibler said . &quot; But children brought over the border are victims of their circumstances . . . . We wanted to try to alleviate the problems that might result &quot; from the proposition ' s passage . The congregation may be the first in Orange County to lay the groundwork for such a program , but other members of the clergy , many of whom openly criticized the initiative , are considering ways to respond to its passage and wondering why their words of opposition from the pulpit had so little apparent impact . The issue is a troubling one to the priests , ministers , nuns and rabbis who fought against 187 , convinced that its aim of denying most public benefits to illegal immigrants constituted not only a political issue but a moral one . Despite opposition from every major religious denomination in California -- and grass-roots efforts by the clergy to rally their congregants against it -- the statewide ballot measure passed_by a margin of 59 % to 41 % . In Orange County , voters favored it by 67 % to 33 % . Faced with that result , several clergy members said they could not help but wonder whether religious_leaders are no longer able to sway their flocks on such thorny political and ethical issues . At a meeting Friday of Catholic clergy from parishes across Orange County , several priests asked whether &quot; we ( have ) lost our moral power , &quot; said Father John Lenihan , pastor of St . Boniface Catholic_Church in Anaheim . Not so , answered Msgr . Jaime Soto , vicar for the Hispanic community of the Diocese of Orange . &quot; Some priests say people chose not to listen to us ( about Proposition 187 ) , but others ask what would have happened if we had said nothing , &quot; Soto said . &quot; I think we did have an impact , even if it was to make some voters very angry at us . &quot; Unfortunately , for many people , we were not successful in helping them understand the moral and social consequences of this proposition. &quot; The election result signaled &quot; an alarming trend , &quot; in the Catholic_Church , which already has &quot; a shepherd-flock gap &quot; between the attitudes of lay Catholics and their bishops ' strict stands against legalized abortion and the death_penalty , wrote editor Tod Tamberg in a post-election issue of the Tidings , the newspaper of the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese . According to Times exit polling , 69 % of Protestant voters cast ballots for Proposition 187 , despite public opposition expressed by United Methodist , Episcopal , Presbyterian and other mainline church leaders . Catholics , who make_up the state ' s largest denomination , opposed it by a narrow 51 % to 49 % . But non-Latino white Catholics supported the measure 58 % to 42 % . The Rev . Gary Collins , pastor of St . Mark ' s Presbyterian_Church in Newport Beach , said members of his church who disagreed_with his opposition to Proposition 187 often asked him how he could support those who broke the law . &quot; I tried to explain that the church looks_at the law , but also at a second level as well , &quot; said Collins , whose 300-member church is considered one of Orange County ' s more progressive congregations . Collins said he finds it difficult to gauge the effect of the clergy ' s opposition to the initiative ; no polls , for example , asked voters both their views on Proposition 187 and whether they belonged_to congregations whose pastors actively opposed it . But he said he believed it would have passed_by a greater majority if the clergy had not spoken out against it . Still , he said , the fact that the measure was approved and by such a large margin may be &quot; another sign that the church doesn ' t have the great moral power &quot; over its members that it once did . Lenihan , whose 7 # 000-member Catholic_church is predominantly Latino but includes a number of white and Vietnamese American families , said churchgoers may have felt justified in disregarding their pastors ' views because the issue was not as clear as other recent political questions on which the clergy has taken a stand , including abortion and euthanasia . &quot; The bottom_line is we didn ' t have quite the same clear moral imperative in this one , &quot; Lenihan said . &quot; For many , I think the issue was blurred by the notion that these people were here illegally. &quot; At St . Mary ' s , a Catholic_church in Fullerton , Father Richard C . Kennedy said many of his parishioners have been silent on the issue of Proposition 187 since its passage . &quot; I think it just reveals that people will vote for what they think and not listen to the church for guidance . This is something serious and complex and I ' m very much saddened by it , but things will go on. &quot; Scheibler , whose tiny church borrows the facilities of a Congregational church for its weekly services , said his parishioners came_up with the idea for a tutoring program within days of the election , even though it remains unclear how much of the so-called Save Our State initiative will actually be implemented . Under the church program , which will be called Innocentia -- a reference_to the biblical passage in which King Herod put the children of Bethlehem to death -- six bilingual volunteers would tutor children in reading , math , science and history , Scheibler said . The church is still searching for a facility . &quot; We ' re certainly hoping we never need the Innocentia program , but we want to be ready , &quot; he said . &quot; We just want to be_active in helping any children who may need this at any time. &quot; Soto said the Catholic Diocese is also studying whether its network of parish homework centers might need to be expanded in the wake of the initiative ' s passage . More generally , Soto said , the church leadership here is pondering what actions to take . For the immediate future , though , &quot; we will continue , particularly now as we approach the holiday season , to preach and practice the good news that we are all God ' s children and we are all brothers and sisters of one another , &quot; he said . &quot; As old as the message of Christmas is , people still need to hear it . &quot; And maybe now even more_than before. &quot; * Times staff writer John Dart contributed to this report .</TEXT>
