   <HEADLINE> DEMOCRACY ; THAI PROTESTER WHO HELPED FELL JUNTA AIMS AT CIVILIAN PREMIER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In May , 1992 , a hunger_strike by Chalad Vorachat against military rule started a chain_reaction of street protests that led to the collapse of a government headed by a retired army chief . Last week , Chalad announced he was going_to resume his fast to the death . This time his target was not the influence of Thailand ' s powerful military but civilian Prime_Minister Chuan Leekpai , who came_to power on a wave of popular support for democracy . Chalad ' s protest was perhaps the most graphic sign so far of popular disenchantment with democratic government two years after as_many as 100 people were killed in clashes with the army during demonstrations demanding elected , civilian rule . Paradoxically , among the most vocal critics of the government now are the same newly affluent business people whose support for democratic reforms was instrumental in bringing_down the government of Suchinda Kraprayoon two years ago . &quot; A lot of people in the middle_class are disillusioned , &quot; said Amarr Siamwalla , head of the Thailand Development Research Institute , a Bangkok think_tank . &quot; The government hasn ' t accomplished an awful lot . They appear to be just bumbling along. &quot; Chuan , who took_office at the head of a five-party coalition in September , 1992 , does get high marks from many analysts for trying to decentralize the economy and for keeping his government relatively corruption-free , no small accomplishment compared to the rapaciousness of past Thai governments . But Chuan is widely criticized for appearing paralyzed by indecision in the face of pressing problems such_as Bangkok ' s notorious traffic gridlock . &quot; Chuan is too cautious . He needs to be more assertive , &quot; said Suchit Bunbangkong , a respected political analyst at Chulalongkorn University . A frustrated Chuan complained after a particularly bruising defeat in Parliament that &quot; it is difficult for an elected administration to please everyone . The work is even more difficult when the government is trying to do its job and uphold democratic and legal_principles at the same time. &quot; The problem came_to a head at the end of March when the ruling coalition called a special_session of Parliament to consider 25 changes designed to liberalize the constitution that was drafted under a military junta in 1991 . Among the proposed changes was an amendment designed to reduce the power of the Senate , the upper house of Parliament that is filled with former military_men and senior civil_servants who were appointed by the previous administration rather than elected . The Senate , rebelling at the prospect of having its perquisites cut_back , joined with opposition members of the lower house of Parliament and voted against the proposed democratic reforms . Instead , they adopted an entirely different constitution that was literally cut and pasted together from past charters . The Nation newspaper , one of the loudest proponents of democracy in Thailand , called the maneuver a &quot; quiet , sinister coup in broad daylight. &quot; The opposition demanded that Chuan dissolve Parliament and call new elections , a demand he has so far ignored . The political crisis is far from over . A second_reading of the proposed new constitution is coming_up in two months , and the same coalition of opposition parties and disaffected senators appears ready to override the government and pass its own version . If it does , Chuan may have little choice but to resign . Chuan ' s government won a brief reprieve from the barrage of criticism thanks to a timely announcement from Washington . The U.S._government disclosed Tuesday that it had seized a luxurious Beverly Hills home and Mercedes-Benz belonging_to Thanong Siriprechapong , a member_of_Parliament for the opposition Chart Thai party , on charges they had been purchased with the proceeds of millions of dollars in marijuana sales in the United States . While Thanong initially denied the allegations , the charges helped to revive memories of corruption in Chart Thai , which also had close ties to past military rulers . Compared to drug dealers in Parliament , Thai political analysts mused , perhaps Chuan did not look so bad after all .</TEXT>
