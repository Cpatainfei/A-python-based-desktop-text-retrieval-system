   <HEADLINE> VALLEY VOGUE / CINDY LAFAVRE YORKS ; NEW LOOKS FOR LIPS AND LIMBS ; DARK TINTS GAIN POPULARITY FOR LIPSTICK AND NAIL COLOR , WHILE CASTS GO FROM BLAND TO BRIGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Teen-age girls are puckering up with the season ' s hottest lip colors -- near-sinister shades of black , with nails to match , natch . Who could have foreseen the rise of licorice lips and ebony talons ? Probably only the big beauty companies , such_as Clinique , YSL , M.A.C. , Chanel and even such natural lines as Origins , which are offering the ultra-deep shades . They come_in the form of rich purplish cocoa hues and neo-black shades like Chanel ' s Vamp -- and are changing the way women think_about lip color . At the Topanga Plaza Nordstrom store , the darker shades are selling briskly , confirms Wendy Stark , beauty director for the store ' s entire Los Angeles region . Stark says makeup mavens hot to follow trends are wearing the wine to near-black colors on their lips in a variety of matte , glossy and sheer textures . While age is not really a factor_in determining who wears them , she says , the shape of the lips does make a difference -- narrow-lipped women should shy_away_from anything too dark and go_with something shimmery . As far as the dark nails are concerned , Stark says it ' s groovy if they match the deep lips , but another really haute color for nails this fall to complement the deep colors is no-nonsense nude . &quot; It goes_with all lip colors , &quot; she says of the noncommittal flesh-colored gloss . * CAST BLAST : The same old signatures aren ' t the only ways kids are individualizing their casts these days . At the Tarzana office of Dr. John King -- where orthopedics are the specialty -- kids can choose from a variety of whimsical designs : bright solid colors , teddy_bears , balloons , dinosaurs and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Styles featuring professional_football , baseball and basketball_teams also are available . Best of all , the relatively insignificant additional cost of the novelty casts are not passed_on to the patient , since insurance would not cover such frivolity . Why does the office offer them , then ? &quot; It ' s a psychological acceptance of the cast we want our young patients to have , &quot; explains Debbie Martin , medical orthopedic assistant . &quot; The benefit to the kids is that it motivates them to treat their injured limbs more carefully , and to keep the casts clean and dry. &quot; The nouveau casts are so popular that they are requested three times as often as the plain vanilla style . * SHOULDER CHIC : After a five-year hiatus , it seems shoulder_pads are returning to the fashion forefront for spring ' 95 . Bill Blass , Anne Klein , Oscar de la Renta and a number of European designers are refocusing their interest on the shoulder area , after a short de-emphasis spearheaded by Italian designer Romeo Gigli . Does this mean that linebacker shoulders , first introduced by Norma Kamali and popularized in the late ' 70s and ' 80s , are back in_style ? Definitely not , explains Harold Lopato , president of Majestic Shapes , the New York company that makes many of the accessories sold to designers and boutiques for women to wear under their garments . &quot; I don ' t know many women today who won ' t occasionally put a shoulder_pad under a dress , so it never really went_out of style , but those Frankenstein football looks are not coming_back , &quot; Lopato says . The pads add definition to petite women by adding height , he says . For others , pads narrow hips and chisel the waist . Locally , Flair boutique in Encino carries an array of shoulder_pads , which sell in pairs for about $ 10 ( price varies according to style ) . * CHAIN_GANG : Female baby_boomers who are finding they need glasses to read the entrees du jour on restaurant menus are turning_to eyeglass chains to avoid constantly searching for their glasses . Classic faux tortoise styles to more elaborate antique versions are making fashion news , with many in silver or gold_plate . Chains made of turquoise , hematite and glass are $ 15 to $ 35 at Dr. Robert E . Brill ' s Studio City optometry office . But more affordable designs featuring plastic beads and adorned cords sell between $ 10 to $ 35 at Sunglass Hut in Topanga Plaza .</TEXT>
