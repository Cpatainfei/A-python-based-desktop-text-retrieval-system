   <HEADLINE> AROUND TOWN : SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS HAD A DICKENS OF A TIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Pickwick Club ' s Christmas spectacular was the very Dickens . Even the queen and her prince were there . Victoria and Albert , that is . &quot; An evening of seasonal Victorian entertainments , &quot; the invitation promised , hosted by &quot; the world-famous theatrical family of Mr. Vincent Crummles. &quot; And there he was , straight out of the pages of &quot; Nicholas Nickleby , &quot; greeting one and all , waving a pole from which dangled a clump of mistletoe . &quot; I ' m too_large a character to be confined within so small a book , &quot; explained Mr. Crummles ( a.k.a. David Springhorn of Pasadena ) . Ladies and gentlemen sipped cider ( there were no stimulants ) , nibbled savories such_as shepherd ' s pie and pasties and danced waltzes , polkas and something called The Portland Fancy . &quot; I miss the old graces . This is a moment of grace , &quot; said a be-feathered Mrs . Vincent Crummles ( Linda Underhill of San Rafael ) . Ostrich feathers bobbed atop her head and black feathers ( &quot; chicken , madame &quot; ) fluttered on the plunging bodice of her circa 1830s gown . With logs ablaze in the greenery-swagged fireplace , one could almost forget for the moment that this was Davies Hall in Altadena , not Dickens ' England . ( The metal folding_chairs , which grew harder with each passing hour , were a reminder. ) But , as Mrs . Crummles suggested , &quot; It ' s more the spirit of Dickens than the letter of Dickens &quot; when The Pickwick Club celebrates . Mr. Crummles , a character as familiar to a true Dickens devotee as Mr. Pluck , Miss Squeers or Mr. and Mrs . Curdle , then took_the_stage to announce a performance by his theatrical troupe , renowned worldwide &quot; or at least within the boundaries of several provincial parishes. &quot; There followed an evening of truly terrible poetry , incredibly bad jokes and , in the true English music_hall spirit , a sing-along or two , helped along by oversized cue cards . Mr. Crummles introduced a pair of ladies &quot; whose hearts are large , and whose bodies reflect that radius. &quot; Enter two plump , tiptoeing , wand-waving fairies , &quot; Snowdrop &quot; and &quot; Gumdrop. &quot; ( The 19th Century predated political correctness. ) &quot; Snowdrop &quot; sang of the injustice of being 40-plus : &quot; My magic wand is_full of power , but this is not enough . They want their little magic from a younger bit of fluff. &quot; And then there was a Sweeney Todd skit ( &quot; Sweeney Todd the barber . My God ! He was better than the plague . . . &quot; ) . All joined in a chorus of &quot; Rule Britannia , &quot; led by Mrs . Crummles , who ' d draped herself in a Union_Jack . Queen Victoria and Prince Albert arrived with their nine offspring , including a cigar-puffing Edward , Prince of Wales . A bit of an inside joke , Edward ( Jonathan Graff , an actor from Playa del Rey ) explained later : &quot; Queen Victoria hated cigars &quot; and it ' s said , on learning of his mother ' s death , the heir to the throne lighted a big stogie and announced , &quot; Gentlemen , you may smoke. &quot; Graff is a dedicated member of the Pickwick Club , a sort of literary society that meets quarterly in a Victorian Pasadena home to sip port and discuss the_likes_of Dickens , Poe and George Sand . This being 1994 , it admits women , which would n ' t have happened in Dickens ' day . Springhorn , a portly actor who portrays W.C. Fields at Universal Studios , is founder / president and Darla Kruger ( &quot; Gumdrop &quot; ) , a legal secretary in real_life , is &quot; recording secretary and everything else. &quot; Those who join , said Graff , are hooked on &quot; the genteelness of the era , the gentleness . You could talk and dance at_the_same_time . And you could easily tell the men from the women. &quot; At evening ' s end , guests pulled their chairs into a semicircle around the piano and sang carols . &quot; We ' re bringing back our idealized version of the past , &quot; said Kruger . &quot; I ' m Jewish and I have a lovely time with this. &quot; &quot; Do not restrain yourselves , &quot; urged Mr. Crummles . The finale : A rousing &quot; Hallelujah Chorus. &quot; Cue cards were hoisted just in case anyone didn ' t know the words . All told , the evening had a &quot; very warm &quot; feeling , reckoned Kruger . &quot; Or maybe it ' s my corset. &quot; Not All Little Angels Have Wings and Halos Just before noon on a Saturday , Clark and Donna Staub of Claremont arrived_at the Angel Store in Pasadena with their little ones all freshly bathed and ready to sit for their angel portrait . At least Hydra the Dalmatian and Laurie , a big black and brown mixed-breed hound , were ready . They blinked stoically as proprietor Bridget Fonger strapped them into satin halos and wings . &quot; The dogs are awesome , &quot; said Fonger . Yes , agreed Donna Staub , amazed , &quot; And they ' re both in heat. &quot; Dylan Staub , 4 , also seemed resigned to his otherworldly ordeal . He was thinking ahead -- to lunch at McDonald ' s , maybe , and a visit to the toy store . &quot; Can we get Grandma a dump_truck ? &quot; he asked . His parents assured him Grandma would adore a dump_truck , but first let ' s get_on_with this portrait for Grandma . Fonger opened her doors in June , about the time the AIDS Service Center in Pasadena began a family and pediatric program . She took the coincidence as a sign . For each hand-tinted portrait , she donates 15 % , or a minimum of $ 10 , to the center . To date , about 80 angels or angel groups have been snapped . Dylan ' s brother , Rainer , 20 months , wasn ' t up for this angel stuff . &quot; He won ' t wear a hat , &quot; explained his father , as Rainer shook_off his glittery halo . And those big , scratchy feather wings elicited more tears . &quot; that ' s OK , &quot; said Fonger . &quot; He ' s a little angel who set_aside his halo and wings for the moment. &quot; Sometimes , she said , &quot; I feel_like a dentist must feel. &quot; The Dalmatian ' s halo had just slipped to a jaunty angle . &quot; Your own wings ! Wow ! &quot; said photographer John Emmons , trying a little psychology on Rainer , who only cried louder . A compromise was reached . Even with one wingless , halo-less angel , the portrait is destined to be a family treasure . &quot; I ' m really happy with it , &quot; Donna Staub said later . &quot; Everyone was looking_at the camera and smiling , except the dogs , of course. &quot; Hydra and Laurie were Emmons ' third and fourth canine Christmas angels . Earlier , he ' d immortalized a Labrador and a dachshund . No cats so far ( the very thought makes him wince ) . The family Staub departed and Nicholas Matute , 4 months , arrived from Glendora in the arms of his mother , Michelle . An angel with a pacifier . &quot; It ' s time for your close-up , &quot; said Emmons , adjusting Nicholas ' wings .</TEXT>
