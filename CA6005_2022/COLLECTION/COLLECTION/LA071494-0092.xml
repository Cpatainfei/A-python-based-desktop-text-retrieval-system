   <HEADLINE> THE COLLECTORS ; WINE_CELLARS FROM THE GROUND UP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If someone tells me , &quot; I have a wine collection , &quot; I look carefully to see whether the speaker shows signs of the same affliction I had many years ago . The signs are subtle , but the trained observer can make a diagnosis without asking embarrassing questions . Look_at the fingers . Are they slightly redder than yours ? Perhaps this is a sign of having just come from a wine tasting ( red_wine dripping from glass ) . Look_at the pants . Are the knees a bit worn ? Could be an indication the person has been rummaging about on_hands and knees in convenience_stores that once had a wine section , looking_for a long-forgotten prize . Other signs : purple-stained teeth , a fascination with old Chenin Blanc , an inability to chat about dates in history without bringing_up how good or bad a vintage it was . Persons so afflicted are unlikely to know they are suffering from a mania that a psychotherapist might term &quot; obsessive-compulsive. &quot; For most people , collecting wine starts the way it started with me : with the taste of a great wine that I just had to have more of . In my case it was 1970 Oakville Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon &quot; Van Lobel Sels. &quot; In 1976 , it was $ 10 a bottle , almost as expensive as Chateau Latour . I found six bottles . I called a friend , not really to gloat . OK , to gloat . He was blase . He said if I was starting a collection , I should get 1970 Simi Cabernet . It was only $ 6.50 and it was better . I froze ! Better ? I dashed_down to my local store . &quot; Do you have 1970 Simi Cabernet ? &quot; I asked , hopeful . &quot; I think we ' re out , &quot; said the clerk . &quot; Look_on that shelf. &quot; I was crestfallen . Cases of the 1971 Simi were there ; no ' 70 . I started pushing the boxes around . There , way in back , was a case of the ' 70 ! It was in my trunk in seconds . I had won my first treasure_hunt . I now realize that was a seminal moment in my fixation . One thing led to another -- a_few bottles of 1973 Diamond Creek , a bottle of 1973 Mouton , nine bottles of 1974 Caymus Cabernet bought one at a time . I started going_to my favorite wine shop every Saturday , then to wine tastings , then to wine auctions . I joined a small wine club . At the same time , my car began acting strangely . It automatically stopped at every store that had a &quot; Liquor &quot; sign_on it . I had nothing to do with it ; the car was possessed . Once I was an hour late getting home . I walked in with two bottles of 1976 Chateau Laville Haut-Brion . &quot; How much . . . ? &quot; asked my wife . I replied , &quot; Eleven doll . . . . &quot; &quot; A bottle ? ! &quot; I know people whose lives are consumed by collecting . Not to mention their closets , cabinets and garages . Pretty soon there is serious discussion about using other space in the house to store wine . ( &quot; Does Cindy need all that space in the nursery ? She ' s only 2. &quot; ) There is , however , a way to manage the mania , to keep it under_control and to assemble a respectable collection of wine without losing a sense of reality . But it must be done with a sense of proportion . If collecting gets_out of hand , you could be in_trouble : Few therapists specialize in treating vinomania . * DECIDE WHAT YOU LIKE : Start by deciding what kind of wine you like . Then see if you like that wine with age . No sense aging something if you like to drink young wine , and many people do . Should you buy a wine newsletter to help you find such wine ? Newsletters typically tell you only what someone else thinks_of a young wine now , not how you will like this same wine in a decade . Your best bet is to see if you can find an older version of it and try it alongside the youngest version available . Sure , the older bottle may set you back a_few bucks , but it ' s a surer and cheaper way to see if you should be investing a lot of money in young wine that you intend to consume later . If you buy now without knowing how the wine ages , you may pay later too . To find an older version of a current favorite , phone your local wine shop and ask to speak_to the wine buyer . Good wine shops have a specialist ; great wine shops have many . * BUY IN MODEST AMOUNTS : Once you know that you like a certain type of wine and have a good idea of what is worth buying_in quantity , buy a small amount of the wine , perhaps six bottles at most . Sure , I bought full cases of wine years ago , but I found that I usually ended_up buying too_much . And although it ' s tempting to buy a case of something when it ' s young , in most cases within five years you can usually find the same wine at a price not much more_than it originally sold for , factoring in inflation . This may_not be true for something like Chateau Latour or one of my favorite wines , Chateau Margaux , but the aftermarket for fine wine -- other_than certain highly sought items -- is pretty broad , and these days a lot of collectors are selling_off older wines through wine shops . My best advice is : If you plan on having a good-sized , broad-based wine collection , start with small amounts of very good wines . * DIVERSIFY : Most people start by collecting one or two things . In California , the mania for young collectors is Cabernet Sauvignon . But older collectors I ' ve interviewed almost all say they wish they had gotten more 1971 Barolo , 1985 Solaia , 1971 German Rieslings , or 1977 Port . So even if you have no present interest in , say , red_wines from the Rhone Valley , it might be a good idea to buy a_few bottles of top-rate Hermitage from 1990 , one of the greatest vintages of all time , and lay them away . Later , you may find you love the character of old Rhones . If not , you can certainly trade them for something you like with other collectors . * WHEN TO BUY A LOT : There is one exception to this admonition : With extremely hard-to-get wines ( such_as Grange Hermitage of Australia , Guigal ' s Cote Roties , Chateau Le Pin of Bordeaux , some of the Gaja Barbarescos ) , you may have to buy the amount you desire up front , because so little is ever seen in the aftermarket . A little homework will tell you if your favorite wines fall_into this category . * TASTE BEFORE PURCHASE : It ' s best to try a bottle of an expensive wine before you buy a large quantity of it . How many people would buy a pricey car without taking a test_drive ? Especially with expensive wines , buy a bottle as early as you can and taste the wine with knowledgeable friends . Take careful notes . Pay_attention to how the wine tastes alone , then with food . How does_it develop over an hour or two ? Do you like it more as time passes , or less ? In particular , is it worth what you paid_for it ? * SPLIT CASES WITH FRIENDS : Often the best way to buy is with others who like the same wines . ( You can find these people by joining wine-tasting clubs , attending winemaker dinners , or even meeting people with like tastes in wine shops. ) Since most great wines are shared with friends anyway , having a friend with a half case of a wine you like is a little like an insurance_policy . In case you drink all yours while the wine is still in its ascendancy , you may have another chance or two to try it again . * BARTER : Trading wine with others is a good way to maximize your exposure to great wines . It ' s not always easy to determine whether you made a fair trade , but if both parties are satisfied , the trade is a good one , and it is especially good for collectors who have more_than they need of a particular wine . My best trade : In 1976 I got a bottle of 1961 Chateau Mouton-Rothschild from a collector who couldn ' t find two wines that I had -- 1974 Caymus Cabernet and 1973 Freemark Abbey Edelwein . * INITIALLY , STORE SIMPLY : Temperature-controlled wine cabinets are lovely to look_at and keep wine at optimum temperature . However , they are anything but cheap , and wine doesn ' t seem to age significantly better in them than with simpler methods . A starter wine &quot; cellar &quot; is the back of a closet that doesn ' t change temperature much . ( A bit of additional insulation is an inexpensive insurance policy. ) Keep wines out of direct light ; keeping them in original boxes is practical . Some people use a room such_as an office for storing wine and add a room air conditioner . But since air conditioners draw moisture out of the air , wine corks can dry_out . Moreover , this storage method works only until all_the space is used_up . One man I know built an extra little &quot; home &quot; on his property to house his wine , then a mere 400 cases . He installed a large commercial refrigeration unit to keep everything cool . Often on hot days , he ' d wander down to the house and do an inventory , sipping a 20-year-old white_Burgundy as he went . Constant temperature is more important than cool temperatures that fluctuate . Readings as high as 70 will not harm most wine as long as they are constant , but at this level young wine ages a bit faster , and older , more fragile wines can deteriorate . Areas underneath houses are popular storage spots , as are public storage_lockers ( see accompanying story ) . * DRINK THE WINE BEFORE IT ' S DEAD : Most red_wine matures enough in its first five years to gain some bottle bouquet ; few red_wines require more , but unless you taste a wine now and then , you won ' t know how it ' s developing . There ' s a saying that addresses the problem : I ' d rather drink a wine on the way up than on the way down . Waiting for a wine to reach its peak is some mystical trick that is more often frustrating than rewarding . If you like wine , drink it before it turns nasty . * As for my own addiction to collecting wine , I thought I was cured two years ago when I ran_out of space to store the stuff . I called a friend to inform him of my freedom from dependence . He asked me if I had bought any wine in the last 60 days . I admitted I had . He asked me if I was still on a winery ' s mailing_list and buying from it . I admitted I was , on three , in fact . He asked me what I knew about D-day in 1944 . I said 1944 was a lousy vintage . &quot; You ' re not cured , &quot; he said . &quot; You ' re in denial. &quot;</TEXT>
