   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON : HOLLYWOOD SEES NO DRAMA IN ' GREEN PAPER '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hollywood ' s response on Thursday to the long-awaited release of the European Union &quot; Green Paper &quot; on audiovisual policy was dramatically undramatic by community standards . There was little gnashing of teeth or doomsday prognosticating . . . even from the industry ' s former Chicken Little , Motion_Picture Assn . of America President Jack Valenti . That may reflect a new cautiousness in dealing with the sensitive trade issue , especially in public . Or it may reflect the belief that the long-range significance of the report will be minimal -- because its proposals are expected to be vigorously debated before action is taken . The Green Paper was formally presented at a Brussels press_conference Thursday , after leaking_out late Wednesday . It contained many of the expected anti-American recommendations , with the EU commissioners calling_for tougher quotas and subsidies on Hollywood-based productions as a way to help stimulate Europe ' s troubled entertainment_industries . Among the specific recommendations : stricter enforcement of rules requiring that 50 % of all television broadcasts in Europe be of European origin and &quot; parafiscal &quot; levies on items such_as cinema tickets , television advertising revenues and video rentals as a way to raise money for indigenous production . Speaking at the press_conference , EU Commission President Jacques Delors said the issue goes_to the heart of Europe ' s self-image . &quot; Cultural goods are the expression of the identity of each people , the vehicle for their language , of their history , of their heritage and their artistic patrimony , &quot; he said . Audiovisual Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro , who also was_on hand , called_for &quot; urgent action &quot; to help Europeans prepare_for the digital revolution that will create demand for new programs . According to wire_service accounts of the event , Pinheiro criticized the current trade imbalance , in which European audiovisual exports to the United States equal $ 200 million , compared with more_than $ 4 billion in imports from the United States . That imbalance has been magnified in importance since entertainment was excluded from the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade last year , and it threatens to spill_over to next month ' s Cannes Film Festival , where there ' s a suspicious lack of American commitment so far . At the time of the GATT defeat , Valenti predicted dire consequences for Hollywood . But Thursday he was more optimistic . The longtime movie_industry lobbyist , who has been meeting with European leaders over ways to resolve their differences , said the Green Paper actually omits some earlier &quot; Draconian suggestions. &quot; &quot; It ' s saying , ' How does the EU go_into the future and nourish thriving film and TV industries ? ' &quot; Valenti said . &quot; And that ' s what we are about now . We ' re trying to put ( GATT ) behind us and see how can we help build healthy industries in Europe , because a healthy industry is good for us , too. &quot; * Not everyone shared Valenti ' s sunny assessment of the report . Privately , some Hollywood executives said they fear that the recommendations could significantly reduce the flow of American entertainment to European shores . that ' s a serious issue , since Hollywood has come_to rely_on overseas markets for roughly 50 % of its theatrical revenue alone . Others charged that the commission ' s recommendations are ill-conceived , and destined to fail in reviving interest in European film and TV productions . &quot; The suggestion of higher levies on the business to support ( unpopular European movies ) is neither healthy nor useful , &quot; said George Vradenburg , executive_vice_president of Fox Inc. &quot; The efforts to harden the quotas is particularly troubling. &quot; Jonas Rosenfield , president of the American Film Marketing Assn. , said he was expecting a more substantive evaluation of the European entertainment_industry ' s current policies and problems . &quot; They ' re saying time is running_out , and that they only have 10 years to reverse the situation , &quot; Rosenfield said . &quot; But there ' s no real input on why they ' re in such dire circumstances. &quot; The Green Paper is supposed to form the basis for discussion of specific commission proposals due this fall . The EU ' s 12 member states will then approve a specific set of rules . * Remembering Wells : A ceremony honoring the late Walt Disney Co . President Frank G . Wells will be held at the company ' s Burbank headquarters at 4 p.m. Monday , and will be broadcast live to employees at Disneyland and Disney World . In addition , Disney ' s Burbank-Glendale offices will be closed Monday in memory of Wells , who was killed in a helicopter accident Sunday . In a prepared statement , Disney Chairman Michael D . Eisner said : &quot; Frank ' s death was a shock to us all . We will never forget his wisdom , his awesome intelligence , his fiery competitiveness , his zest for life and the many lessons he left as a legacy to us all. &quot; The Wells family has requested that all donations in his memory be made to Environment Now , which is dedicated to environmental restoration and protection . The address of Environment Now is 450 Newport Center Drive , Suite 450 , Newport Beach , CA 92660 .</TEXT>
