   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA 1994 ; AMERICA ' S PASSION_PLAY ; THE UNITED STATES ' SURPRISING SUCCESS IN THE FIRST ROUND HAS ALLOWED ITS FANS A CHANCE TO FEEL THE HEAT THAT IS SYNONYMOUS WITH WORLD CUP COMPETITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Channel surfers are zapping from the weather in Denver to the financial ticker to &quot; Little House on the Prairie &quot; reruns and are stopping to watch corner_kicks and wondering when Alexi Lalas is going_to host &quot; MTV Unplugged. &quot; Suddenly , there seems to be room on talk radio for soccer . True passion doesn ' t necessarily bloom overnight and no one expects U.S. stock_markets to close during World Cup games , like they did_in Brazil . But soccer left the stadium and joined pop culture , at least temporarily , when the United States defeated Colombia , 2-1 , on Wednesday in the first round of the World Cup . Any forecast on whether the U.S. soccer team will set_off a spark that turns_into the vibrant flame that exists almost everywhere else in the world is premature and presumptuous , of course . But World Cup ' 94 already has surpassed its pre-tournament billing as another sporting contest that was being force-fed to a reluctant public and recalcitrant media . &quot; The masses have it and they want it and they are doing_it , but I ' m not sure if the power_structure is quite there , &quot; said Martha Lopez-Garza , a sociology professor at Occidental College . &quot; I ' m not convinced yet. &quot; Power_structures , in this case possible sponsors , advertising executives and the media , might rely_on raw data , but passion and emotion aren ' t easily measured , not always fitting into neat little categories on flow_charts . No one was_on hand to poll the fans who staged a spur-of-the-moment celebration Wednesday night at a Yorba Linda gas_station when goalkeeper Tony Meola and defender Marcelo Balboa stopped for a bathroom break on their way back to Dana Point , serenading them with cheers of &quot; U-S-A ! U-S-A ! &quot; Then there were the fans with patriotic makeup -- red , white and blue faces -- clad in flags , wandering the streets of Pasadena , slowing traffic long after the game ended on Wednesday night . Or how about the afterglow lasting through the rest of the week . Lalas combed through a pile of fan mail on Friday while doing interviews . At the team ' s resort_hotel in Dana Point , a solid line of television trucks lined the entrance on Thursday . The proliferation of satellite dishes made the parking_area look_like a mushroom farm . &quot; There were more one-on-one interviews in one day than in the last 15 months combined , &quot; said agent Leigh Steinberg , who is representing the U.S. team . U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic , a man_of_the_world in the truest sense , has been getting calls_in every language . Except he is trying to convince some of his friends that , yes , the Americans did win , 2-1 . No , it was not a misprint . In Dallas , officials of soccer ' s governing body , FIFA , were stunned . Already , the warm reception the World Cup has received in the United States had allayed FIFA ' s fears that Americans would not give the event its due respect . &quot; I have been in football 19 years as an executive , and I have never ( seen ) this feeling of emotion , and the awareness of our games as we ' ve had in the United States , &quot; said Joseph Blatter , secretary_general of FIFA . &quot; They proved that this game has a right to have its place in the U.S. &quot; Two days after the victory , Chief Sebastian Babatunde Williams of Nigeria still could not believe what had happened . &quot; Now ( Americans ) started reacting to it , &quot; he said . &quot; And they are enjoying it . I see the expression on their faces . When I get_in a cab , the driver wants to talk_about soccer. &quot; Said World Cup ' 94 chairman Alan Rothenberg : &quot; The response has been overwhelming . People are walking by and high-fiving us as we ' re traveling around , getting_in and out of cabs and at airports. &quot; Steinberg pointed_out the importance of today ' s game against Romania from a television standpoint , since it is_on ABC , and is only days after the upset of Colombia . Wednesday ' s U.S.-Colombia game drew a 4.3 national Nielsen rating for ESPN . In contrast , Game 7 of the Stanley Cup_finals between the New York Rangers and the Vancouver Canucks drew a 5.2. But ESPN ' s opening-day baseball_game between the Cincinnati Reds and St . Louis Cardinals received a 4.1 , the cable network ' s best rating of the season for baseball . Jack O ' Hara , executive producer of ABC sports , refused to make any predictions for today ' s U.S.-Romania game . &quot; I refused to make any ratings guesses before the World Cup and I ' m glad I did because I would have been way off , &quot; he said . &quot; But I will say it should be a huge rating . All the conditions are right . It ' s a Sunday afternoon game facing little competition. &quot; Lopez-Garza of Occidental has students who were passionate about soccer long before this World Cup tournament and could get their fix only from Spanish-language Univision . Some were from places such_as Armenia and Cameroon and didn ' t care if they couldn ' t understand a word during the games . ( Univision drew a 19.1 rating among its households for the U.S.-Colombia game ) . &quot; The whole world plays , &quot; she said . &quot; Soccer in the United States was almost like the way we treated the metric_system . We resisted it when it came_up . &quot; It ' s a very active sport . It doesn ' t seem to be as violent as some sports , especially for kids . It ' s a lot more exciting than baseball . &quot; As a society , we like to be ahead . We don ' t like to be last on the bus or last at a party . We said , ' It ' s not our game . Everybody else is already doing it. ' &quot; Corporate and media resistance to soccer in the United States was noticeable before the World Cup landed here . Guillermo Canedo of Mexico , FIFA ' s senior_vice_president , recalled when only he and Joao Havelange of Brazil , FIFA ' s president , supported the idea of bringing the World Cup_finals to the United States . &quot; The old people didn ' t believe football could make_it here , &quot; said Canedo , chairman of the World Cup_finals organizing committee . If anyone had reason to be skeptical , it was Canedo , a former part-owner of the Los Angeles Aztecs and the San Diego Toros , now defunct professional teams . &quot; But we knew exactly what could happen , &quot; Canedo said . &quot; Americans understand this sport like people in my country . How many millions of Americans are from Europe and the Americas ? The immigration is tremendous . These people are going_to fill these stadiums and bring their American friends . They are going_to be the teachers . &quot; When the next league begins , well , that is the moment for change in the United States. &quot; Rothenberg likes to say that the real job begins July 18 , the day after the World Cup_final . Blatter and his colleagues campaigned vigorously to boost the U.S. national team and bring soccer to America . They have been frustrated for years because millions of American youth played the sport , then dropped_out of sight before ever buying a ticket . Now optimism is replacing frustration and FIFA believes soccer has reached a crossroad . &quot; It is not like some American commentators have said , it is not a one-time event , &quot; Blatter said . &quot; It is a legacy , not a two-day circus . One half hour after the match ( at the Rose Bowl ) , people were still in the stadium cheering . We have seen the United States play with such a fighting spirit , it is such a tremendous thing to see . They produce such an emotion. &quot; Emotions spilled_over in the Rose Bowl stands , too . Generally , the crowd was_well behaved and Colombians and Americans seemed to get_along . Once it became clear that the United States had a decent chance of carving out a bit of soccer history , the mood got tense in one section , according to Al Mistri , who is the soccer coach at Cal State Fullerton . &quot; There was a fight in the section behind my wife , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m not sure what exactly happened , but someone got_in a Colombian ' s face . It ' s not the kind of thing you like to see at a game . But at least someone finally gives_a_hoot about soccer . I feel proud . It felt really good to see . &quot; This is the kind of passion that only this game can produce. &quot; Today , the passion will play_out at the Rose Bowl . Wednesday might very well have been the highlight of the ' 94 World Cup tournament , but now the expectation level has been raised with the U.S. performance . What are the chances of the passion staying alive after the World Cup ? &quot; The bottom_line is that this has helped propel us up , &quot; Mistri said . &quot; I may_not see it . You may_not see it . But your children will see it . &quot; Before Wednesday , I would have said no. &quot; * Times staff writers Elliott Almond , Julie Cart and Larry Stewart contributed to this report .</TEXT>
