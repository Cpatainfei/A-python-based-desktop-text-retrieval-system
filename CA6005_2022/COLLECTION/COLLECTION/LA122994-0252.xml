   <HEADLINE> O.C. DEFICIT COULD TRIPLE TO $ 120 MILLION BY JUNE ; BANKRUPTCY : COUNTY PROJECTS LOSS OF INTEREST INCOME . OFFICIALS INDICATE HARSHER CUTBACKS MAY BE NEEDED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Only a week after announcing $ 40.2 million in budget cutbacks and savings , officials said Wednesday that Orange County ' s revenue shortfall for the next six months could be triple that amount and signaled that more severe measures will be needed to close the gap . The deficit could reach $ 120 million by June , financial managers now say , because they no longer can count_on earning interest on the county government ' s $ 2.7-billion share of the now-bankrupt Orange County investment pool . &quot; We ' ve got_to deal with an interest earnings loss of about $ 120 million , &quot; said Ernie Schneider , the county ' s administrative officer , who was counting_on the interest income to balance the $ 470-million general fund budget through June 30 . In other news Wednesday , three weeks into Orange County ' s bankruptcy : * The county ' s top lawyer revealed for the first time that he accompanied former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron to a meeting in April with officials of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission , but did not tell the Board of Supervisors about the agency ' s concerns over the county ' s high-risk investment strategy . County Counsel Terry Andrus said he did not believe it was necessary to alert supervisors at the time . * It was learned that a treasury oversight committee recommended by the county auditor in 1987 was never officially convened because Citron strenuously resisted the idea and refused to participate , even on an experimental basis . * A somber protest by about three dozen members of the Orange County Employees Assn . failed to persuade county officials to reinstate labor_contracts that were voided after the county filed for bankruptcy Dec . 6 . Labor_leaders contend that layoffs can be accomplished quickly within contract guidelines , but county management says that process could cost the county millions of dollars in delays . &quot; The next step is our lawsuit , &quot; said John H . Sawyer , the association ' s general_manager , who led the team that met with county leaders for about two hours . * The beleaguered city of Montebello received a $ 14-million infusion from the investment pool , a key part of the Los Angeles County community ' s plan to avoid defaulting_on a $ 25.6-million note payment due Friday . * The Huntington Beach City_Council voted to sue Orange County if an agreement is not reached by Jan . 6 to release city property_tax revenues frozen in the pool . Officials in Costa Mesa said they may do likewise . * A dozen municipal_bond firms expressed interest in helping the county sell bonds to bolster its finances -- a bailout strategy employed in the mid-1970s , when New York City teetered on the edge of bankruptcy . Among those interested : Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co. , Lehman Brothers , J.P. Morgan Securities and Bear Stearns &amp; Co . Cash_Advances County officials said the additional revenue losses calculated Wednesday may be offset somewhat by further cash_advances from federal , state and local sources . It also is possible that the collapsed investment pool may yet generate some interest . But the county is no longer counting_on any money from a stream that had been budgeted to be its single biggest revenue source this year . The growing deficit could mean even greater cutbacks than those already announced , and it could add urgency to talk_of dipping_into emergency funds and selling_off county assets , such_as John Wayne Airport . The revelation about the magnitude of the county ' s shortfall stunned labor_leaders , who have equated $ 40.2-million worth of cuts and savings to a loss of 800 to 1 # 000 jobs . Tripling the budget gap over just the next six months could mean much greater staff reductions , officials say . Sawyer said the trio of county managers who announced the cutbacks last week made_it clear at a Wednesday meeting that the budget situation was more serious than county officials had earlier believed . But they did not mention that the budget_cuts might be significantly higher than the $ 40.2 million already announced , Sawyer said . Regardless of the severity of the crisis , he added , management should comply with bargaining agreements in laying_off employees . &quot; We ' ve got the same position we had before , &quot; he said . &quot; Whatever they can prove to us is necessary , we can work it out within the provisions of our contract . It makes_it more severe , but the procedures are the same. &quot; County officials ' estimate of a huge loss in income over the next six months is based on their anticipated inability to collect $ 120 million in budgeted interest income from the now-collapsed investment fund , which has dropped $ 2.02 billion in value this year . County officials also are uncertain how much interest -- if any -- will be generated next year as the portfolio is liquidated and disbursed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court . Although no one has come_up with any firm ideas of how to cover a $ 120-million revenue shortfall in the next six months , county officials say they have reserves that will have to be emptied , such_as $ 70 million set_aside for &quot; economic uncertainties. &quot; Meanwhile , officials said , the county has 1 # 525 budgeted but unfilled jobs , and 2 # 256 current employees are eligible for early retirements that could ease the pain . The staggering new figure &quot; adds an urgency to strategies that will produce additional revenue for the county , &quot; Supervisor William G . Steiner said . &quot; The $ 40 million in cuts are only part of the solution. &quot; The county treasury had invested $ 7.8 billion on behalf of 187 cities , school districts and other agencies in a high-risk investment strategy that backfired this year as interest_rates rose and the value of the pool plunged 27 % . At a closed-door meeting Wednesday in Irvine City_Hall , city and school officials from across the county expressed dismay at the county ' s assertion that it had not yet formed a clear picture of its fiscal condition . &quot; I have to assume the county doesn ' t know , &quot; said Seal Beach City_Manager Jerry L . Bankston . &quot; They honestly do not know. &quot; Another city_manager who did not want to be identified said the county ' s financial management practices appeared to be &quot; from the Stone Age. &quot; Accounting_Firm Cities and school districts with money tied_up in the ill-fated investment pool plan to hire an accounting_firm to help make_sense of county records , said Craig A . Barbarosh , an attorney who represents some cities that invested in the pool . &quot; At this point , we simply don ' t have equal access with the county to information , &quot; Barbarosh said . &quot; We need to know what the county , as the debtor in this case , needs short-term as well as long-term . We need information from the county to do that. &quot; Huntington Beach Mayor Victor Leipzig said there are &quot; drumbeats of discontent &quot; among municipalities that invested in the fund . But Leipzig added that public officials seem , for the most part , willing to work within the system set_up last week by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John Ryan for distributing money from the fund on an emergency basis . &quot; The cities are committed to working with the county , &quot; Leipzig said . &quot; But they ' re getting frustrated , because the county does not appear to be working with them . The county could solve a lot of their problems by being a little bit more upfront. &quot; Newport-Mesa Unified School District board_member Judy Franco said there have been no indications that the county has a long-range plan in place for dealing with the crisis . &quot; The question is , where do we go from here ? &quot; Franco said . &quot; There isn ' t a lot of information out there yet. &quot; City officials said they are hopeful that ongoing negotiations with the county will lead to the distribution of some property_tax revenues that have been held_up since the bankruptcy filing . The county administers the money for the cities . &quot; We ' re negotiating with the county to get those funds made available to the cities and districts , &quot; Barbarosh said . &quot; We ' re hopeful that those pre-bankruptcy petition dollars will be made available soon. &quot; Union Contracts Also Wednesday , the county ' s management council -- made_up of Sheriff Brad Gates , Dist . Atty . Michael R . Capizzi and Health_Care Agency Director Tom Uram -- spoke with union_members about the county ' s dire economic picture . The three stood_by their recommendation that the Board of Supervisors suspend union contracts . The county employees association had requested that the management council urge supervisors to rescind last Thursday ' s resolutions . Those actions superseded layoff provisions in employee contracts , which require that any terminations be based on seniority . &quot; We ' re hopeful , but they certainly didn ' t agree with our request , &quot; Sawyer said . &quot; They said they had made their decision. &quot; Some employees said they felt betrayed . &quot; God knows how many countless hours I ' ve sat in negotiations with the county , &quot; said Jim Best , a civilian employee with the Sheriff ' s Department who has been_on union bargaining teams since 1982 . &quot; It makes me wonder , what have I done with all this time if they unilaterally rescind our contract ? &quot; Best said he addressed the management council on the topics of &quot; honesty , honor and dishonor. &quot; &quot; Every worker is angry . What are we going_to do to remedy this situation ? &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t feel very comfortable knowing that my department_head can arbitrarily lay me off two weeks from now. &quot; But Bruce Moore , a deputy probation counselor , said he talked with Capizzi after the closed_session and found him receptive to workers ' concerns . &quot; He appeared to be agonizing over the process , &quot; said Moore , a 23-year county employee . &quot; I think we might have moved him a fraction of an inch , to at least go_back to the board and express our feelings. &quot; Members of the union , which represents 11 # 000 of the county ' s 18 # 000 workers , expressed concerns about accrued benefits such_as vacation , sick time and retirement money placed in deferred compensation accounts , employees said . The meeting came as other unions researched the legality of last week ' s actions by the Board of Supervisors , which has asked county department_heads to report back Jan . 10 with specific plans for budget_cuts and layoffs . The Orange County Attorneys Assn . -- made_up of about 300 lawyers from the offices of the district_attorney , the public_defender and the county counsel -- met with the management council Tuesday to discuss similar issues , said Paul Crost , who represents the association . Crost said he made_it clear that the association believed that its contracts should be reinstated and that accrued vacation hours should not be tied_up in the bankruptcy proceedings . &quot; We ' re going to be considering the legal ramifications of actions they have taken , &quot; Crost said .
