   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITIONS ; VOTERS APPROVE ' THREE STRIKES ' LAW , REJECT SMOKING MEASURE ; PROPOSAL FOR GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH_CARE SYSTEM , GASOLINE_TAX TO FUND RAIL PROJECTS ARE ALSO DEFEATED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Californians overwhelmingly approved Proposition 184 , the tough &quot; three strikes &quot; sentencing law Tuesday , and solidly rejected the tobacco industry-financed initiative to roll back the state ' s strict smoking restrictions . Voters also slapped down a sweeping , labor-backed Proposition 186 to impose a tax-funded , government-run health_care system , and an initiative that would have added a 4 % sales tax on gasoline to fund rail projects . Voters did agree to overhaul the system of disciplining judges , approving Proposition 190 . By a surprisingly large margin , voters showed their skepticism that cigarette makers had their best health interests at heart , soundly defeating the tobacco_industry ' s failed $ 18-million effort to win passage of Proposition 188 . Gaylord Walker , co-chairman of the campaign against 188 , hailed the results , saying the outcome proved that &quot; when you tie tobacco companies to an initiative . . . the voters easily see_through it. &quot; Election night proved to be a poignant time for Mike Reynolds , the wedding photographer who set_out to change criminal_law in June , 1992 , after his 18-year-old daughter , Kimber , was shot to death in a robbery outside a popular restaurant in her hometown of Fresno . Reynolds gathered with a_few friends and political supporters at his home , where several judges , prosecutors and lawyers hatched the concept 30 months ago that came_to be known as the &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; sentencing law . &quot; This started with a promise to my daughter and I think this is a promise kept , &quot; said a somber Reynolds , who watched election returns at his home . Proposition 184 restates word for word the &quot; three strikes &quot; sentencing statute Gov . Pete Wilson signed into law in March . Although &quot; three strikes &quot; is already the law , Reynolds pressed ahead with the initiative . He wants legislators to realize it would be political suicide to water_down the new law . One of the most sweeping overhauls of sentencing law ever , the measure limits plea_bargaining and the right of judges to grant probation . It will double and triple sentences for thousands of felons annually , and ensure that they spend at least 80 % of their sentences in prison . The campaign for the &quot; three strikes &quot; measure raised more_than $ 1.6 million , compared to the paltry $ 28 # 000 raised by opponents . With only five citizen-generated initiatives on the ballot , 1994 was a light_year for initiatives . But their costs were large . Donors pumped more_than $ 35 million into this year ' s initiative crop . As much as that is , however , it pales in comparison to the 1988 initiative wars , when a single insurance industry-backed initiative cost $ 37.5 million . The year did bring one initiative record . Philip Morris , the nation ' s largest cigarette manufacturer , spent $ 12.6 million to win passage of Proposition 188 . California Common Cause says that is the largest sum ever spent by a corporation on a California initiative . For the tobacco_industry , Proposition 188 appeared to be an act of desperation . The tobacco_industry is being pilloried by hard-hitting ads aired by the state_Department of Health Services . Local officials from Los Angeles to Redding have passed indoor smoking bans . The Legislature approved and Wilson signed one of the nation ' s toughest anti-smoking laws this year , banning smoking in restaurants and most indoor workplaces . Philip Morris urged retailers in a letter to pass_out pro-188 literature , saying passage of the measure was &quot; vital to the continued profitability of the cigarette category. &quot; Philip Morris Inc. told shareholders in another letter that passage of 188 is &quot; of paramount importance to our consumers , our employees and you , our stockholders. &quot; With a campaign that played_on Californians ' desire to reduce smoking , the tobacco_industry led in polls that came_out in September . That shocked many foes , and the American Cancer Society , the American Lung Assn . and the American Heart Assn . responded by donating more_than $ 600 # 000 combined . In all , the no-on-188 campaign raised about $ 1 million , using most of it to broadcast commercials in which former U.S. Surgeon_General C . Everett Koop called the initiative a tobacco_industry lie . Opponents received a boost from an unusual $ 4-million campaign funded by two health foundations . Designed to educate voters about Proposition 188 , the campaign helped the opponents by simply informing voters through ads that the tobacco_industry was behind Proposition 188 . Proposition 186 , the health_care initiative , was the next most expensive . Opponents , led by the insurance and health_care industries , spent more_than $ 9 million in an effort to kill the measure , designed to create a Canadian-style state-run health_insurance system on a scale unprecedented for a state . The initiative , which sought to provide health_insurance for all legal state residents , called_for new personal , business and cigarette taxes that would have raised $ 40 billion to $ 50 billion annually . The system would have been run_by an elected health commissioner . Kirk West , president of the California Chamber_of_Commerce , said Tuesday that the proposed $ 100-billion benefits program , accompanied by historic tax increases that would be needed to finance it , was more_than voters could swallow . &quot; The simple fact is that voters aren ' t interested in turning_over a tenth of the economy to the state_government , &quot; he said . Opponents aired radio spots focusing_on the proposed tax increases and played_on voters ' distrust of a health system run_by an elected official . Proposition 186 ' s backers included unions , consumer activists and senior_citizens groups . They aired television ads playing_up their grass-roots support and attacking insurance_companies , who had the most to lose from 186 . In a year when new taxes were less popular than incumbent politicians , the environmentalist Planning and Conservation League pushed Proposition 185 , which would impose an additional 4 % sales tax on gasoline to be used primarily for rebuilding the state ' s urban and intercity rail system . As the election grew closer , its support evaporated when its two primary backers -- the Southern Pacific Railroad and Morrison-Knudsen , which builds passenger rail cars -- withdrew their financial_support . Both stood to benefit from the measure ' s passage .</TEXT>
