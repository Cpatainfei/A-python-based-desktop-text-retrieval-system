   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; WHAT UKRAINE ESPECIALLY NEEDS NOW IS A LITTLE MORE NATIONALISM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the leader of a country in the midst of an identity_crisis , Ukrainian President Leonid D . Kuchma visited the White_House last week with an unusual mission . Because Ukraine is still uncertain whether to orient its economy and foreign_policy eastward or westward , Kuchma looked_to President Bill_Clinton to help his country find its way in post-Cold War Europe . Economic reform , financial assistance and Ukraine ' s pledge to rid itself of nuclear_weapons were all key features of the agenda . But the most important message conveyed by Clinton was that Ukraine , if it so chooses , will be welcomed into the West . It is now up_to Kuchma and his voters back home to take_up the offer and ensure that Ukraine emerges as a stable , sovereign nation . Ukraine ' s identity_crisis has deep historical roots . After centuries of foreign rule and the intermixing of populations , the country is profoundly multiethnic and multicultural . Nowhere in Europe is national identity more amorphous . This weak sense of nationhood has clear advantages . Ukraine is not Europe ' s next Yugoslavia . Ethnic Ukrainians and ethnic Russians comfortably live intermixed . Minority groups -- Poles , Romanians , Bulgarians , Moldovans , Belarussians , Jews and Hungarians -- are well-treated and protected by progressive legislation . Ukraine ' s blessing , however , is also its curse . The Balkans may have too_much nationalism , but Ukraine has too_little . As they struggle to establish a functioning state , Ukrainians are not bound together by the cultural , religious and linguistic ties of a common heritage . Elsewhere in Eastern Europe , nationalism provides a sense of cohesion for societies engaged in building new states . But in Ukraine , a nation and a state must be constructed anew . And without the momentum provided by an intact national identity , a new state is emerging very slowly . Meantime , diverging regional interests risk Ukraine ' s breakdown , if not its break-up . Because of Ukraine ' s size , location and nuclear_weapons , not only its own stability , but Europe ' s as well , hangs_in the balance . Ukrainian television demonstrates the country ' s struggle to reclaim nationhood : Channel One is still Russia ' s national station . In my meetings with government officials and intellectuals , Russian , not Ukrainian , was the language of choice . When I asked whether the allegiances of Russian colleagues are ever questioned , the reply was always the same : &quot; We do not know or care who is Ukrainian and who is Russian. &quot; Why do most Ukrainians still prefer to speak Russian ? Why aren ' t Ukrainians reveling in a reclamation of their identity like other East Europeans ? The answer is that the images and symbols that constitute Ukrainian identity are up for grabs . After three centuries of Russian domination , much of Ukraine is so Russified that the country ' s language , religion and culture no longer serve as anchors of a national identity . The weight of history and proximity is especially telling in the eastern half of the country . Independence means little for eastern Ukrainians , especially when it comes at the expense of raw_materials and markets for their deteriorating factories . Residents do not want to surrender sovereignty to Russia , but they do want to restore the economic ties severed when the Soviet_Union collapsed . Russification reaches deep into the country ' s interior . In Uman , a provincial town in south-central Ukraine , residents speak a mix of Ukrainian and Russian . Twenty-five miles west into Ukraine ' s agricultural heartland , Russia ' s imprint is still clear . Nadia , who served in the Red Army during World_War_II and was married to an ethnic Russian , says of the country ' s new-found independence , &quot; Ukrainian nationalism is worthless and meaningless . It is being forced on the country by people from the west. &quot; Just as history and proximity have pulled eastern and central Ukraine toward Russia , they have pulled western Ukraine in the opposite direction . Centuries of outside rule -- first by Poles , then by Austro-Hungarians -- have left their mark . Buildings are more Central European in_style . Religious affiliations point west . Western Ukraine is mostly populated by Greek_Catholics , while Ukrainian and Russian Orthodox dominate the east . But neither the Poles nor the Austro-Hungarians suppressed Ukrainian language and culture as did the Russians . Nor was the west as integrated into Russia ' s economy as the east . Westerners thus remain far more attached to a distinct national identity . Still , this stronger sense of identity has limited ethnic content . Rukh , the main nationalist party , stands more for full sovereignty and independence from Russia than it does for a revival of Ukrainian culture and language . The absence of a stronger sense of nationhood has its benefits . If ethnicity mattered more , eastern Ukraine and Crimea , where ethnic Ukrainians and Russians live interspersed , would be tinderboxes . Instead , Ukrainians and Russians alike , largely for economic reasons , desire closer relations with Russia . But there is a downside . Without a strong national identity and a national project that follows from it , Ukraine ' s political_system has foundered . On questions as central as relations with Russia and economic reform , elites have been unable to chart a coherent course . Elections this year replaced a Parliament stalemated between communists and nationalists with one dominated by a coalition of communists and socialists . Kuchma enjoys Parliament ' s support of his plan to renew economic ties to Russia . But after only four months in office , Kuchma ' s position is already threatened . Although Parliament passed his package of economic reforms in October , his flanks are now exposed to a leftist coalition opposed to building a market_economy . It is no accident that the country has lacked the leaders needed to provide vision and push_through reforms . Without nationalism and the sense of loyalty that accompanies it , many of the country ' s best and brightest are elsewhere . This brain-drain , mostly to Moscow , has deprived the country of the intellectual capital needed to build a nation and a state virtually from scratch . The lack of a widely shared sense of nationhood also saps the electorate ' s energy and constrains its willingness to bear the costs of reform . National independence provides little emotional satisfaction . As a result , independence is judged in more narrow , materialistic terms . And the assessment is not favorable . As one Kievan told me , &quot; National independence and privatization mean two things : corruption and economic decline. &quot; Absent a shared sense of ethnicity and culture , responsibility for keeping the country together has fallen to the state . If nationhood cannot be based on a common ethnic identity , it must be based on civic identities that emerge from an integrated political community and the sense of belonging that comes_with it . But the state is far from being able to provide basic economic welfare ( Ukraine ' s inflation_rate for 1993 was 8 # 940 % ) , no less to create the political community necessary for a civic nationhood . Here is Ukraine ' s central dilemma . Because the country lacks a strong sense of national identity , responsibility for providing political community and social cohesion falls upon the state . But the state is too weak to shoulder the responsibility -- largely because nationalism has not been available to drive forward painful political and economic reforms . Clinton ' s meeting with Kuchma has helped lay the groundwork for resolving this dilemma . The United States has pledged Ukraine $ 900 million in economic assistance and is pressing its G-7 partners to raise their contributions . Kuchma is fulfilling Ukraine ' s part of the deal by agreeing to make his country nuclear-free and guiding ambitious economic reforms through a hostile Parliament . Continued encouragement and support from the United States will increase the chances that these measures get implemented . This combination of domestic reform and outside assistance promises to provide Ukraine what it most needs : a functioning state . Clinton , by offering the country a perch in the West , has also given Ukraine the chance to forge a new national identity . Because of its location and history , Ukraine will surely retain close ties to Moscow . But were Russia to re-absorb Ukraine , whether in whole or in part , whether by Moscow ' s design or Kiev ' s default , the prospects for erasing Europe ' s residual Cold_War divides would considerably dim . To ensure that this does not happen , Ukraine must keep one foot firmly planted in the West . This straddle is now possible only because Clinton has made clear that the option exists . As long as Ukraine takes_up the offer of security assurances from the United States , new trade and investment links to the West , more contact with Americans and West Europeans , and more robust links to the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , the European Union and other institutions , the country should be able to resist the eastward pull of history . Ukrainians must now do their part to keep reform moving ahead , proceed with denuclearization and build new links to the West . If they do so , Clinton ' s embrace of Kuchma will have helped provide Ukraine the more intact national identity that it needs if it is to balance between Europe ' s east and west . The Balkans have given nationalism a bad name in post-Cold War Europe . But in Ukraine , a little nationalism is just what ' s needed .</TEXT>
