   <HEADLINE> PARENTS GET PANEL TO KILL SEX EDUCATION PROPOSAL ; MOORPARK : THE GROUP PERSUADES A DISTRICT COMMITTEE TO DROP CONSIDERATION OF PROGRAM TO TEACH HIGH_SCHOOL STUDENTS ABOUT CONDOMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fearful that teaching Moorpark High_School students about condoms would promote promiscuity , a group of angry parents successfully lobbied a school district committee Thursday to kill the proposed sex education program . Helen Taylor , a parent and frequent critic of the district , organized a small but vocal group of parents to attend a meeting of the district ' s Growth and Development Committee , which oversees health and sex education curricula in the Moorpark Unified School District . &quot; It ' s like fighting fire with a blast of oxygen , &quot; said Taylor , who is also a member of the committee . &quot; This tells students that it ' s OK to engage in sexual_activity . It encourages and promotes sex. &quot; The issue surfaced after Moorpark High_School health teacher Rich Uphoff proposed that the committee consider adopting a 12-step instruction program that has been taught at Channel Islands High_School in Oxnard . &quot; This isn ' t a recommendation or a proposal , &quot; he told the committee Thursday . &quot; I ' m just trying to get some direction to see if you feel this would be appropriate. &quot; The committee , which includes teachers , school administrators and a school_board member , was formed several years ago to develop the district ' s abstinence-based sex education curriculum . While the program allows_for discussion of contraceptives such_as condoms , it has never included details on how to use them . &quot; Abstinence is still the No . 1 point we make , &quot; Uphoff said . &quot; We make the point that the only way to avoid pregnancy or HIV is abstinence , but we can ' t be like ostriches . Eighty-five percent of high_school seniors engage in or have engaged in sexual activity. &quot; Uphoff said the method used in the Channel Islands High class includes a group activity with both male and female students that goes_over the steps_on the proper use of a condom . But of about 10 parents at Thursday ' s meeting , none spoke in favor of the curriculum . Several condemned the district ' s sex education program altogether . &quot; The more it is discussed the less embarrassed kids are about sex , &quot; said Kandy Zierenberg who took her two daughters out of Moorpark High_School in part because of the sex education program . &quot; I think embarrassment solves a lot of problems. &quot; Patty Daniels , who came_to the meeting with her husband , agreed . She said the more that students were exposed to sex education courses the more they would have_sex . Committee_member Lorraine Feuerstein was the only one at the meeting to speak in favor of teaching students how to use condoms . Feuerstein ' s motion to approve the curriculum , however , failed for lack of a second . &quot; Ignorance is what we are trying to avoid here , &quot; she said . &quot; Frank speech is essential to prevent disease and pregnancy . I don ' t think anyone is comfortable talking_about this , but I ' d much rather demonstrate the proper use of a condom than read about someone killing their kids. &quot;</TEXT>
