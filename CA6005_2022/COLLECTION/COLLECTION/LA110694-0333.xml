   <TEXT> I knew the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Waikiki was big , but until last month , I didn ' t suspect it had room enough for two Hawaiis . The most obvious of the two is the commercially packaged version that lies all around as you walk the 20-acre , 2 # 542-room beachfront resort on a Friday night . On those evenings , bathed in the light of its 77 gasoline-fed tiki torches , the hotel stages its &quot; King ' s Jubilee &quot; show with 10 hula dancers and a man playing the role of King David Kalakaua , the &quot; merry monarch &quot; of the islands who revived interest in hula and Hawaiian music in the 19th Century . After the free hourlong performance , the hotel staff explodes fireworks over the beach , and thousands of vacationers stand below and marvel at the indigo sky , the creamy sand , the commotion of the tides . I took_in a portion of that scene the night I arrived . But after a_few minutes , I snuck off to the hotel ' s Tapa Ballroom to spend a_couple_of hours with the other Hawaii , the one that native Hawaiians are struggling to sustain . The event was a community children ' s hula competition , advertised on bulletin_boards within the hotel . I paid the $ 10 admission and sat among several hundred locals to admire the dancing , chanting and drumming of 18 hula schools , known as halau , and the kumu ( teachers ) who lead them . The annual Hula Oni E Keiki Hula Festival , assembled by the Halau Hula O Hokulani , was created three years ago . If the cultural offerings outside felt vaguely like a Las Vegas floor_show , the atmosphere of these performances shared more with mainland Little_League games and piano recitals . Vendors offered homemade crafts . In the front row sat a line of impassive judges . And before them proceeded scores of nervous keiki -- children -- some of whom had studied hula for eight years and were just entering their teens . As 13-year-old Jessica Kamalani Bond prepared to take her solo , the master of ceremonies read a_few details from her bio . &quot; When she grows_up , &quot; he said , &quot; she would like to be a computer technician and professional hula dancer. &quot; That night , and for the next six days on Oahu , Kauai and Maui , I found two distinct trends at_work : Hawaiians are exploring and celebrating their native culture with more enthusiasm than they have in perhaps a century , and the Hawaiian tourism industry is pouring new emphasis into replicating and advertising the most visitor-friendly elements of that culture . If you ' re a strictly sun-sand-surf traveler , you ' re likely to notice small things here and there , many of them merely cosmetic : fewer plastic leis at the hotels , more Hawaiian-made products in gift_shops , more taro dishes on menus . Still , the list grows longer daily : At the Hyatt Regency Kauai , members of the island ' s historical society meet with interested guests for &quot; talk-story &quot; sessions . At the half-dozen sites of Hawaiian Hotels &amp; Resorts , an &quot; essence of Hawaii &quot; promotional campaign , devised last year , highlights historical aspects of each site . On the two ships of American Hawaii Cruises , passengers now find that the crew includes a traditional Hawaiian storyteller . Last month on the Big Island of Hawaii , the Kona Village Resort threw a birthday_party for 83-year-old Imgard Aluli , one of the state ' s most prolific Hawaiian songwriters . Meanwhile , Molokai , for decades one of the least tourism-oriented of the islands , now sells itself to visitors as &quot; the most Hawaiian island &quot; of them all . But there ' s more to this than marketing . Glance at a community bulletin_board , chat with a resident , make an inquiring phone_call to a museum or cultural group , look in one of the islands ' local festivals , or perhaps merely take a closer look_at your hotel lobby , and you ' ll probably find hints of a deeper , more rewarding -- and more conflicted -- Hawaii . In fact , a stranger can easily see those 77 closely tended Hilton torch flames as a sign of the strange state of tourism and cultural politics in Hawaii these days : Everyone , it seems , is declaring his or her eagerness to protect the flame of native Hawaiian tradition . But for every torch-bearer , there seems to be another set of presumptions and ambitions and another formula for feeding the flames . One obvious element in Hawaii ' s introspective mood is the delicate condition of the tourism industry , which generates an estimated 40 % of the state ' s gross product and is only now coming_back from a deep three-year slump . Too poor to continue the developers ' orgy of mega-resorts , monorails and water slides that capped_off the 1980s , the industry ' s leaders last year publicly vowed to renew their emphasis on trappings of traditional Hawaii , a trend that had already been growing for several years . Now , in ever-greater numbers , tourism leaders are matching hotels with local hula schools , urging local guides to pass tests in island history and tutoring workers in aloha spirit . The state ' s Tourism Training Council has certified about 250 of the estimated 2 # 000 tour guide-bus drivers in the state . The training_program , created a year ago and run_through Kapiolani Community_College , costs about $ 100 , requires about 40 hours of classroom time over 10 weeks , includes a detailed text ( which addresses head-on such issues as the deposing of Queen Liliuokalani , Hawaii ' s last reigning monarch , and the epidemics sparked by diseases imported from Europe ) and culminates with a 100-question exam . Those who score 85 or higher are certified and presumably become more attractive to employers . The program is expected to grow from Oahu to other islands . George Kanahele , a Cornell Ph.D. in government who has become the hotel industry ' s leading instiller of aloha spirit , estimates that his Waiaha Foundation has made presentations to two_dozen or more hotels since his first effort at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel ( on the Big Island of Hawaii ) in 1985 , and says he senses more receptivity now than in years past . His current clients include the 28-property Outrigger hotel chain . &quot; If you ' re in the hospitality business , you ' re in the aloha business , &quot; Kanahele says . &quot; They ' re one and the same. &quot; Still , this is not charity work . For the hotels and their siblings in the tourist trade under off-island ownership , being Hawaiian may have other benefits , but the bottom-line objective is to lure tourists and give them service that will bring them back again . * Meanwhile , in the background of the tourist landscape stand leaders of the rapidly advancing but many-headed Hawaiian sovereignty movement . For many of them , being Hawaiian means not only political empowerment but mistrust of past exploiters , including the tourism industry . Though its leaders cannot agree on whether they want full independence , limited sovereignty under continued statehood , land , financial reparations or some combination of those , the movement has grown so powerful that last year it extracted from President Clinton a formal apology to native Hawaiians , on behalf of the American people , for the behind-the-scenes American scheming that brought the fall of Queen Liliuokalani in 1893 . After an upwelling of public demonstrations in Honolulu on the anniversary of the January coup ( &quot; RETURN STOLEN LAND ! &quot; demanded one placard ) , the movement has largely receded from view of most tourists . But its advances elsewhere continue : In May , after decades of using the island of Kahoolawe as a target for practice bombings -- and recent protests by native Hawaiian groups -- the Navy yielded the unpopulated , ordnance-scarred island to Hawaiian control . A state commission is deciding how the land will be used . Clearly , hoteliers and the sovereignty movement leaders aren ' t natural bedfellows . Yet as these mirror-image trends advance , each reaps benefits from a broader , quieter grass-roots Hawaiian cultural renaissance that has been building for two decades , leading more families to enroll their children in hula classes , more farmers to consider planting taro , whose roots when pounded become poi . In these circles , being Hawaiian is often a more personal matter . On my second day on Oahu , I walked along the Waikiki waterfront , past stacked surfboards , crimson Texans , and two hip-looking Hawaiian teen-agers gently strumming ukuleles while a sign across the street shouted an offer of &quot; MUUMUU FACTORY TO YOU &quot; bargains . Enduring native culture in the shadow of crass commercialism , I thought . But what is native ? A 1989 state population study found that just 1 % or less of the islands ' million-plus population was full-blooded Hawaiian , with another 18 % classified as part-Hawaiian . And if the line between native and non-native history is drawn at 1778 , when Captain James Cook arrived , the ukulele doesn ' t make the cut . As I later learned , it didn ' t exist in Hawaii until Portuguese sailors arrived in the 1870s bearing small guitars , and locals made a_few changes in design . * On Kauai , I stayed happily at the Hanalei Bay Resort , which was rich_in tennis_courts , immaculately landscaped , featured taro pancakes on the breakfast menu and had just reopened after belated hurricane repairs . When I had a chance , however , I headed down the_hill to investigate the lavish Princeville Hotel . That resort , on bluffs over Hanalei Bay , was renovated in 1991 into one of the most formal settings in the islands , with classical_music in the lobby and employees in suits and ties . Then came Hurricane Iniki in 1992 and some rethinking on the part of the hotel ' s Japanese owners and its ITT Sheraton management . When the hotel reopened in October , 1993 , the idea was to take_on a more Hawaiian profile -- more aloha shirts and muumuus , less formality . But they ' re still working with the same building . When I got there , the lobby gleamed with black_and_white marble , the lounge was lined with clubby bookshelves and full of classic European furnishings , and a gold-trimmed piano from Paris stood next to the dining-room entrance . Room rates began at $ 225 . At 6:30 p.m. , the blurt of a conch sounded in that genteel lobby , and a young_man stepped_forward with shell and drum , joined by a chanting woman with a lei and a crown of grass and bright fabric . Soon he was drumming ( as his back rested against an overstuffed love_seat ) , and she was dancing and narrating tales of Pele the volcano goddess . The cocktail crowd gathered to watch , applauded . I was half-ready for a waitress to appear bearing poi in fine china , but instead the audience fell_back into pre-dinner chat , and the mist of surreality cleared . The Princeville hotel was also contributing to a new project that seemed to hold interesting possibilities : a taro festival , celebrating the root that has been central to Hawaiian diets for centuries . The October event , staged at various sites on Kauai ' s north shore , was designed to promote camaraderie among island taro growers ( the water-rich Hanalei Valley is one of the state ' s prime taro-growing areas ) and encourage young Hawaiians to consider growing the root commercially . Yet here , too , there ' s irony at_work . Of roughly 50 taro growers on the island , estimated Rodney Haraguchi , president of the Kauai Taro Growers Assn. , far fewer than half are from native Hawaiian families . ( Haraguchi ' s family came_to Hawaii from Japan three generations ago , and started growing taro in 1971. ) And despite the cultural renaissance and a strong demand for taro , many native Hawaiian workers are drawn to jobs at resorts or construction companies that pay more and make fewer physical demands than taro farming operations do . I missed the taro festival , but my timing was better for the Eo E Emalani I Alakai -- that is , the sixth annual salute to the day in 1871 when Hawaii ' s Queen Emma led an expedition to the Alakai Swamp above Kauai ' s Waimea Canyon . On the appointed Sunday , I made the scenic journey to Kokee -- two hours , since I had to drive two-thirds of the way around the island , but what a pleasant chore -- climbed the narrow road along the edge of Waimea Canyon and pulled_up at a green meadow next to the small Kokee Natural_History Museum . The festival , which featured several hula halaus and a re-enactment of the queen ' s horseback ride through the area , had been advertised widely on the island , but there appeared to be only a_few tourists among the hundreds who claimed free seats on the grass . It was a great day . The sun shone brilliantly . In the shade , dragonflies coupled . The re-enactment of Queen Emma ' s ride , led by regal Lisa Uilani Pai in Victorian-style dress on a white_horse , drew a colorful posse of tag-along children in BONGO brand jeans and baseball_caps . While the hula halaus posed for photos in their leaf crowns and grass_skirts , less traditionally inclined Hawaiians lounged in jeans and cowboy_hats . And when the hula performances began , they communicated a range of expression not likely to be found in dances at tourist venues : Some dances were exultant , others were somber and mournful , some developed slowly and gradually , and all were driven by a stark accompaniment of chanting and the pounding of hands on gourds . * The most far-flung stop on my Hawaiiana itinerary was Hana , the idyllic town on Maui ' s isolated back side . To reach Hana by car you must navigate the 50-odd narrow and winding miles of the Hana Highway , a journey that takes three hours or more . Driving the highway , I had that pleasant sense of trading mass commercialism for a world where coconut_meat is peddled in driveways and waterfalls roar at every turn . Reaching Hana , you find that the 66-acre Hotel Hana-Maui and the 4 # 700-acre Hana cattle_ranch are the center of virtually everything . The hotel was born , with 10 rooms and a different name , in 1946 , when ranch owner and mainland businessman Paul Fagan imported his minor_league baseball_team , the San Francisco Seals , to spend their spring_training in Hana . Sportswriters followed , as Fagan knew they would . One of them labeled the place &quot; Heavenly Hana , &quot; and the exclusive resort was off and running . Ownership has changed since then -- the management is now Sheraton -- and a $ 24-million renovation in 1989 pushed the size of the hotel to 96 rooms and suites , many dressed_up with hardwood floors , skylights and blankets of merino wool , woven in England . But the staff of about 200 still includes many native Hawaiians , and the sprawling porches and wicker furniture are_well suited to the tropics . For the last six years , the hotel has hosted the Haku Mele O Hana , a festival that gathers practitioners of traditional Hawaiian song for a non-competitive celebration of the arts . As an arriving guest , I felt I had landed in a place apart . This is as it should be , really , because most of us were paying more_than $ 300 nightly . ( There are a_couple_of other much more affordable lodgings in town. ) It ' s no problem slipping into the slow pace of the place -- a koi pond here , a canopy of trees there , a pair of long swimming_pools , a &quot; wellness center &quot; for workouts , tennis_courts . Shuttles leave hourly for Hamoa Beach , a nearby lolling spot where hotel staff_members are_on hand to offer refreshments . I snapped pictures . I watched the rain ( this is the wet side of Maui. ) I took a ukulele lesson from the hotel social director , Makala Waring , who is full-blooded Hawaiian . Our first tune was &quot; Tiny Bubbles , &quot; of Don Ho fame , which made_for an interesting scene : While I strummed the chords , and rain splattered on the fronds outside , Waring outlined the historically close relationship between the hotel and its employees and stressed the importance of finding a tourism-friendly solution to the sovereignty question . That night I signed_up for the hotel ' s weekly luau at Hamoa Beach ( $ 53 a head for adults ) . There was a pig in a pit oven , plenty of poi ( though mainlanders are put_off by its pasty blandness ) , multiple refills of rum punch , family-style seating at picnic tables , and lots of live guitar and ukulele music , performed by musicians who double as workers in the hotel ' s stables , engineering department and front office . The hula portion of the show was dominated by three daughters of hotel staff_members , none older than 11 . The evening ended with a rendition of &quot; Aloha Oe , &quot; the most famous of many songs written by the deposed Queen Liliuokalani . By day , I drove_out toward Oheo Pools in Haleakala National_Park . The Oheo Pools are a becalming scene -- a river drops_by stages over black volcanic_rocks into the sea -- but they are also a fine illustration of how , in years past , some promoters ' idea of being Hawaiian seemed to involve a little artificial history . Over decades , with encouragement from hotel employees and rental car_companies , Hana has become known as the site of &quot; The Seven Sacred Pools. &quot; This is despite the fact that original Hawaiians aren ' t known to have had any particular beliefs or superstitions associated with Oheo Pools or any of the other streams in the area , and despite the fact that , depending_on the water flow and how you count , you might see seven or 17 or 70 pools along just about any stream ' s path . You might as well call them the Several Secular Pools . Rangers for the National_Park_Service have abandoned subtlety on this issue and now hand_out flyers saying &quot; Seven Sacred Pools ? There ' s no such place ! It ' s a name made_up as a sales gimmick to attract tourists to Hana . . . ( and ) is degrading to native Hawaiians who are trying to preserve their language and culture. &quot; From Hana I headed_home , sheet_music to &quot; Tiny Bubbles &quot; folded into my suitcase , sand in my shoes . No matter where you are in contemporary Hawaii , there are certain circumstances on which you can rely . There will be sand , there will be sea , and there will be an identity_crisis .
