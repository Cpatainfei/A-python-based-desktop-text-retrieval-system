   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; NORWAY IS SIMPLY GOLDEN ; SKIING : LUNDBERG AND DAEHLIE WIN NORDIC EVENTS TO PUSH COUNTRY ' S LEADING GOLD-MEDAL TOTAL TO SEVEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you ' re a Norwegian sports nut , it doesn ' t get much better than this . Hardly had Norwegian Fred Borre Lundberg won the Nordic combined event Saturday at the Olympics when countryman Bjorn Daehlie strode to his second gold medal in three days -- third medal of these Games and seventh of his career -- in the men ' s 15-kilometer cross-country_skiing pursuit race . Their victories gave Norway seven gold medals , more_than any other country , and a total of 12 medals , two fewer than leading Russia . Best of all , the day ' s triumphs were achieved in Nordic events , which mean more in this country than speedskating , Alpine skiing , even World Cup soccer . And in each case , enthusiastic crowds of 50 # 000 or more -- estimates ranged as high as 100 # 000 for the pursuit race -- were_on hand , lining the course and turning the Birkebeineren ski stadium into a rippling sea of red , white and blue Norwegian flags . &quot; It ' s amazing , unbelievable , &quot; said Daehlie , who waved and blew kisses as he neared the finish_line , then executed a 360-degree turn_on his skis just before crossing it . &quot; I knew it was going_to be crazy when I was out on the course , warming_up , before the race . There were so many people. &quot; Too many , according to American John Aalberg , a native Norwegian who only days ago was saying how great it was that so many people were turning_out for cross-country races . &quot; It was crowded all_the way around the loop , &quot; Aalberg said . &quot; People were killing each other . I couldn ' t even look_up at the people because I was afraid I would run_into somebody or they might hit me. &quot; In the pursuit race , a freestyle event , the winner of Thursday ' s 10k classical starts first , the rest of the skiers starting as far behind as they finished the earlier race . So , Daehlie started with an 18-second advantage over Vladimir Smirnov of Kazakhstan and 22 seconds ahead of Italy ' s Marco Albarello . Albarello faded back to 10th -- another Italian , Silvio Fauner , won the bronze -- but Smirnov skied a strong race and cut_into Daehlie ' s lead , if only briefly . &quot; I was afraid all_the time because I was going extra hard in the beginning , &quot; Daehlie said . &quot; I was very tired in the uphills and worried about Smirnov. &quot; Daehlie kept pushing , though , and Smirnov fell_off in his challenge about midway through the race , settling again for second . In the second_half of the Nordic combined , another 15k freestyle ski_race , Lundberg , who had put himself into the lead Friday with two excellent jumps_off the normal ski_jumping hill , assured himself of the overall victory by running_away from the field . Carrying a a Norwegian flag a fan had handed him as he approached the finish_line , Lundberg , who had started 23 seconds ahead , coasted across the finish_line with a 1 minute 17.5-second victory . &quot; My ( plan ) was to open fast and scare the racers . . . behind me , &quot; Lundberg said . &quot; I think it was a success. &quot; Japan ' s Takanori Kono won the silver but another Norwegian , Bjarte Engen Vik , was third , eight-tenths of a second behind Kono . Kono had started fourth after the jump , 50 seconds behind Lundberg . Vik had started third , 43 seconds behind the leader . Todd Lodwick , 17 , of Steamboat Springs , Colo. , who had surprised by jumping to fifth place Friday , fell to 13th in the cross-country race , 5:13 behind Lundberg . He had started 1:40 behind .
