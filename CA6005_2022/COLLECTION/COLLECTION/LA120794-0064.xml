   <HEADLINE> HILL IS GIVEN DEATH SENTENCE FOR SLAYINGS AT ABORTION CLINIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Paul Hill , the former preacher who killed a doctor and his unarmed escort with a shotgun at an abortion clinic here , was sentenced Tuesday to die in Florida ' s electric_chair . Standing lanky and tall in a green jail jumpsuit , the married father of three did not ask the court for mercy . &quot; I know for a fact that I ' m going_to go_to heaven when I die , &quot; Hill , 40 , had said last week . &quot; I am certainly guilty of no crimes . . . . My actions are honorable. &quot; In court Tuesday , Hill said little before he was given the ultimate penalty by Circuit Judge Frank Bell , who sternly concluded : &quot; May God have mercy on your soul. &quot; Moments later , the son of the retired Air_Force_officer who was slain alongside the doctor dismissed Hill as &quot; a nut. &quot; &quot; He shot my father in the head with a shotgun , &quot; said James Barrett quietly , his eyes red , his lips tight and trembling . &quot; My father was a good man . A good , decent , kind man. &quot; Pending appeals , Hill ' s execution would complete a circle drawn_in blood in Pensacola . The city has been the scene of pitched anti-abortion protests , including the bombing of clinics and the murder last year of another abortion provider , Dr. David Gunn , whose killer was sentenced to life in prison . Hill , who defended himself in court but never put_on any witnesses and asked few questions , contends that he murdered Dr. John Britton , 69 , to protect the lives of &quot; the unborn. &quot; He earlier told the court that his July 29 killing was &quot; justifiable homicide , &quot; but Judge Bell refused to allow Hill to present such a defense . Also slain in the attack at the Ladies Center abortion clinic here was retired Air_Force Lt . Col . James Barrett , 74 . Barrett ' s wife June was wounded in the assault . As Hill ' s death sentence was pronounced , his wife , Karen , sat almost frozen , lips pursed , her head trembling slightly . Karen Hill reportedly left Pensacola four days before the shooting , taking her children and $ 10 # 000 in cash . Paul Hill has said no one knew of his plan to kill the doctor . Hill has said he feels no remorse . Although he may choose not to appeal the sentence himself , he is granted an automatic appeal under Florida law , and it could be years , if ever , before he is electrocuted .</TEXT>
