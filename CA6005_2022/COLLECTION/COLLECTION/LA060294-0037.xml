   <HEADLINE> CENTERPIECE : CROWNING SUCCESS ; PAGEANT STRIKES BALANCE BETWEEN LOOKS AND TALENT , BUT COMPETITION STILL TAKES A TOLL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s Monday , May 2 , and Irene Panossian , 21 , sits on a sofa in the home of Pageant Director Mickey Stueck , waiting for the other Miss Moorpark contestants to arrive . Panossian is following the lead of her younger twin sisters who entered the pageant last year . She figures this will help build confidence , something she says she ' ll need when she becomes an entertainment lawyer . Contestants arrive in spurts for the 7:30 p.m. orientation . There ' s Stephanie . Cheyenne . Jessica . Julie . Everyone knows Julie . To those in this circle , Julie may as well be royalty . Actually , she is royalty . Julie Owen is the reigning Miss Moorpark . She is dressed casually in black jeans , a white shirt , a checked vest and no crown . Becky Bryan , Miss Teen Moorpark , arrives a little later . She is more immediately distinguishable , wearing her Miss Teen sash . Nine of the 10 contestants , four moms , one dad , two defending champions , Stueck , and two pageant photographers are present for this first_step toward the May 21 Miss Moorpark / Miss Moorpark Teen Queen Pageant 1994 . The pageant , sponsored by Women of Moorpark Enjoying Networking ( W.O.M.E.N. ) , is open_to contestants age 13-16 ( teens ) and 16-22 ( misses ) . The primary purpose of the meeting is to acquaint the contestants with the &quot; Handbook of Rules and Regulations. &quot; Many of the young_women are already familiar_with the drill -- four of the five would-be Miss Teens have been here before . Contestants can ' t have criminal_records or have used illegal substances . They are not allowed to smoke in public . They cannot consume alcohol . They must always be_on time to Miss Moorpark events and meetings , or give advance notice explaining an absence or lateness . And as for the evening_gowns , Stueck says , &quot; Feel good in it. &quot; But , &quot; teens can ' t wear solid black or strapless. &quot; Bryan has been helping to organize the event , but on this night she and Owen are there for support . &quot; Just go_in with a clear mind and have a good time , &quot; Owen tells the assembled group . &quot; Last year I didn ' t think I had a chance , but my personality came_out . It wasn ' t my looks . It wasn ' t my dress . It was my personality . And if you don ' t walk away with the crown , it doesn ' t matter. &quot; &quot; Be yourself , &quot; says Bryan . &quot; that ' s what ' s going_to get_it for you . Only one of you will have the crown , but all_of you will be winners. &quot; Change of Attitude Considering Stueck ' s long-held opinion of pageants , it ' s somewhat unlikely that she is directing one . &quot; I had a very negative attitude toward pageants all_of my life , &quot; she said . &quot; I always thought they were meat markets. &quot; But her experience with a pageant in Oklahoma , where she lived before heading West , changed her mind . &quot; The emphasis was_on the girl as a person , not just as a beauty , &quot; said Stueck . &quot; Pageants aren ' t all bad . There ' s a lot of good that comes_out of them , as long as they ' re tempered in the right direction. &quot; So Stueck became the Moorpark pageant director five years ago , after her husband Jim volunteered her for the position . Stueck immediately made some changes in the pageant , so that intelligence and personality are the qualities emphasized over looks . She instituted a test of written communication skills to be included in the overall evaluation . Grade-point averages are also factored in . She didn ' t stop there . &quot; When I took_over I did_away_with the bathing_suit competition immediately , &quot; said Stueck . &quot; I don ' t think_of the pageant as a ' beauty ' pageant . I feel very strongly that we do young people , girls especially , a disservice when we have a standard that says looks will get you everything. &quot; Friendly Competitors It ' s Saturday , May 7 , the pageant ' s traditional mother / daughter luncheon at the home of Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason and his wife , Connie . The guests arrive in spring attire -- lots of floral prints . They are seated at three circular tables . At the third table back from the front_door sits Cheyenne Ritchie and her mother Becky , Renee Kinnan and her mother Val , and Stephanie Sill . The girls , all students at Moorpark High_School , are good friends . Most of the pageant contestants are friends . In fact , 14-year-olds Jessica Devers and Laurel Heitzman , seated at another table , have been best_friends since last year ' s pageant . &quot; We ' re inseparable , &quot; says Heitzman . Of the three girls at the back table only Cheyenne , 16 , is a repeat contestant . She says she isn ' t nervous . &quot; We just get all excited trying to get_to the finish , &quot; she says . Stephanie , at 17 , is the oldest of the girls at the table . She will graduate this year and in the fall plans to enter Moorpark College ' s teaching program . She says her stage experience will come_in_handy in the pageant . &quot; I ' m on stage all_the time , &quot; she says . &quot; I ' m in the chorus , I ' m a cheerleader , the ASB ( student government ) , I hosted a fashion show. &quot; Table conversation throughout lunch covers a variety of subjects -- moving violations , prom attire , boyfriends , Garth Brooks , more Garth Brooks . There is talk_of the American flag . Renee , 14 , will deliver a monologue on it , accompanied by the &quot; Star Spangled Banner , &quot; for the talent portion of the pageant . &quot; She has a thing for flags , &quot; says her mother . &quot; Mickey_Mouse and American flags , &quot; says Renee . Dance Rehearsal Tuesday , May 17 . &quot; We ' re late . Let ' s do_it fast . Let ' s press on. &quot; These words are spoken by Pam Rossi , owner of Dance Ten studio where the contestants are rehearsing the opening number for the pageant . The 1940 ' s-style piece , performed to &quot; In the Mood , &quot; is choreographed and directed by Rossi , an original member of television ' s Solid Gold Dancers . The pageant is less than a week off and the dancing is still shaky . &quot; We know the dance , &quot; 15-year-old Karen Blum reassures Rossi . The seven contestants who show_up for the rehearsal -- several are missing because of school exams -- prove Karen right . Steps are higher . Bounces are bouncier . Maybe too bouncy . &quot; I feel the Taco Bell bouncing around , &quot; says Cheyenne . &quot; Here comes the chicken burrito. &quot; Rossi has been through this before . She ' s made guest appearance in national teen pageants , and was runner-up to Miss San Luis Obispo 1975 . She knows what the judges will be looking_for . At one critical_point of the opening dance , where the contestants come_together in pairs for their first pageant poses , Rossi makes a suggestion . &quot; Don ' t touch each other . Just do a pose -- otherwise you look_like you ' re drunk or something , &quot; she says . &quot; You ' ve got_to remember , when you ' re on stage you are representing yourself . If you don ' t do_good on a pose , nobody is going_to look_at you. &quot; Rehearsal ends with an encouraging word from Rossi and hugs from Miss Moorpark . Royal Ambition At age 18 , the reigning queen Julie Owen seems mature beyond her years . Throughout the pageant rehearsals she has served as a big_sister . As she prepares to give_up her Miss Moorpark crown -- something she said she is &quot; ready &quot; to do -- Owen begins readying herself for the upcoming Miss Thousand Oaks pageant . Simply for the challenge . &quot; I do_it purely for the competition . I like the rush . I ' m very much of a competitor , but I do_it well . If I lose , it bothers me , but not to_the_point that I hate the other contestants . I ' m proud_of them , &quot; says Owen , who also won the 1991 Miss Teen and Miss Congeniality honors in Moorpark . &quot; I like the spotlight . When I got_out of high_school I was no longer in the spotlight. &quot; If she wins the Thousand Oaks pageant , Owen will advance to the state level . But she is determined to go well beyond that . &quot; My ultimate goal is , by age 30 , to be Miss Fitness USA , &quot; she says . &quot; I mountain_bike ride and I have a personal trainer . I told him my goal and he said we ' ll do what it takes. &quot; Passing the Scepter While Owen seems , for the most part , to take her un-crowning in stride , the 17-year-old Bryan openly shows her letdown . &quot; It ' s sad . I had so_much fun this year , &quot; she says . &quot; I used to look_up_to beauty queens in awe . I ' d say , ' I want to be that some day. ' This year I got a chance to speak with a lot of children . It was nice to know that I was a positive role model. &quot; After capturing the Moorpark crown , Bryan finished first runner-up in the Twin Counties pageant and among the top 15 in the Miss Teen California contest . The state pageant differed considerably from the small-town Moorpark contest , she says . &quot; There were a lot of girls there who had been doing pageants since they were ( little. ) You can spot them because they ' re the ones not being themselves , &quot; she said . &quot; In ( the Moorpark ) one they are all natural girls . There are no fakes. &quot; Practice_Session Thursday , May 19 , 6:30 p.m. The contestants are rehearsing at the Moorpark Community_Center , site of the pageant , for the first time . They remember the place from their younger days . &quot; Isn ' t this where they used to have the dances ? &quot; asks Nicole Lawin , 18 . Lawin is a dancer who plans to study bioengineering at UC San Diego next fall , when she &quot; straightens out her priorities. &quot; &quot; It used to be bigger , &quot; says Stephanie . &quot; We used to be smaller , &quot; says Nicole . The contestants run_through their opening dance on stage . Or they try to . The stage is smaller than the dance studio so adjustments must be made . After they dance awhile , Stueck gives the contestants some tips for Saturday afternoon ' s interview with the three judges , something that will count heavily in determining the overall winners . Make eye_contact . Give a firm handshake . Watch your body_language -- keep your posture straight , don ' t roll your eyes , don ' t let your mouth hang open . On the subject of eye_contact Julie says , &quot; I always pick a point above the judges ' heads . It looks_like you ' re looking_at them but you ' re not . It makes them feel spppeeeccial. &quot; As for Christine Nilay , a 20-year-old studying microbiology at UC Santa Barbara , she just plans to take_off her glasses when interviewed . &quot; So all I see is a fuzzy sea of eyes , &quot; she says . Following a pizza break -- and talk_of cellulite and acne -- the contestants run_through the entire show , which includes much practicing of the all-important &quot; pageant stance &quot; -- body at a slight angle to judges , arms casually hanging at side , front knee bent . Soon the talents are unveiled . Karen sings &quot; This is Dedicated to the One I Love. &quot; Jessica , whom Stueck described as a wallflower who blossomed at last year ' s pageant , dances to &quot; Rockin ' Robin. &quot; &quot; Last year I was nervous , &quot; says Jessica . &quot; I even lied_about my age during the introductions . . . but not intentionally . This year I ' ll do my best . If I don ' t win , I don ' t win. &quot; Laurel sings &quot; Put_on a Happy Face. &quot; Kim Isaac does an offbeat monologue called &quot; My Blankey , &quot; which seems to mesmerize the other contestants . Renee does a dramatic reading of &quot; Our Flag. &quot; Cheyenne gives an emotional rendering of Winona Judd ' s &quot; My Strongest Weakness. &quot; &quot; You made a tear form in my eyeball , &quot; says Owen . &quot; I puddled. &quot; Lawin dances to &quot; Under Pressure , &quot; by Boyz II Men . Nilay plays the piano and sings &quot; On My Own. &quot; Panossian performs a Beethoven medley on piano . Stephanie sings Garth Brooks ' &quot; The River. &quot; Then it ' s on to evening_gown practice , for which sneakers and socks are replaced by high heels . &quot; I really need nylons for this , &quot; says Jessica . &quot; And I just tore mine off. &quot; Last-Minute Jitters Parents mingle in the auditorium lobby while the contestants ready themselves behind closed doors . Some mothers make 11th-hour clothing drops . It ' s May 21 , pageant night , and nearly three weeks of intense preparation will culminate in less than three hours . In the lobby the guests file_in . Miss Thousand Oaks arrives , all glittery . Miss California USA , Toay Foster , whose mother is a judge , is expected . Bryan is reminded to breathe deeply as she paces back and forth . At 7:40 p.m. , with the audience seated , the room goes dark . And the pageant begins . Contestants march_on stage for their opening dance . Every one of them is smiling , as Rossi ordered . Cameras flash here and there . As the pageant proceeds , the parking_lot to the side of the stage becomes the contestants ' waiting area . The side mirrors of a car are used for last second make-up checks . Throughout the evening there are countless crossed fingers and high-fives as contestants root for and congratulate one another . Before long it ' s talent time . The pageant is moving fast . Karen sits on a stool near the parking_lot , waiting to sing . She ' s looking tense . &quot; Someone give me a hug , &quot; she says . Stueck , who is handing_out words of encouragement and directing traffic with her husband , is the first to respond . But not the last . The stool quickly becomes a pile of wrapped arms . Karen is the first on stage for the question-and-answer portion of the contest . If you had to lose one of your senses , which would you chose ? She explains that she would choose her sense_of_smell , so she would n ' t have to smell all_the terrible things . At the conclusion of competition , a nervous Stueck heads for a conference_room with Robert Duclos , a local CPA who ' s quick on the adding machine . The contestants , back in the dressing rooms , await the tabulation of the judges ' ballots . &quot; This is the tense part , &quot; says Stueck . Both competitions are too close to call . Stueck says she ' s been invited to a contestant slumber_party where she will present them all with crowns from Burger King . &quot; I ' ve said , even if they don ' t walk away with the crown , they are all queens. &quot; When the winners have been determined , the contestants and reigning queens are summoned . &quot; I don ' t want to give this up , &quot; says Bryan . &quot; Steph , good_luck if you win , &quot; says Nicole . Bryan and Owen , battling with their tears , give their farewell presentations . And then it ' s time for the big announcement . The winners are . . . Miss Congeniality : Stephanie Sill . Miss Teen Moorpark : Jessica Devers . And Miss Moorpark : Stephanie Sill . As the onslaught of photos ensues , and a year of public appearances gets under way , Karen , Most Photogenic Teen , leaves the stage . &quot; Oh my God , &quot; she says . &quot; Thank God it ' s over. &quot; Where to Compete Every local ribbon-cutting , parade and festival seems to include an appearance by one Miss Pageant Queen or another .
