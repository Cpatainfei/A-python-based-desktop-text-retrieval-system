   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : RALLY AGAINST REGISTRATION FEE INCREASES FIZZLES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Student leaders at Ventura College held a rally Tuesday in an effort to stir_up frustration over rising registration fees , but the event was sparsely attended . The students passed_out pamphlets , urged students to sign petitions and letters to state representatives , and issued a call to legislative arms from a microphone mounted on a campus quadrangle . &quot; What we are being adamant about is that we will not accept any more fee hikes , &quot; said Kenn Woodward , the school ' s representative to the California Students ' Assn . of Community_Colleges . &quot; The students that were here were very into it. &quot; Rally leaders said few students showed_up because student government was notified only three days ago that a protest was planned and had little time to organize . A small but steady stream of students trickled by from 9 a.m. to noon , and about 40 students had assembled by the end of the rally . At Oxnard College , student government officers said they were unaware that a protest had been planned . Moorpark College_student government officers could not be reached for comment . Fees at community_colleges statewide increased from $ 6 per unit in fall , 1992 , to $ 10 per unit in spring , 1993 , before rising to $ 13 per unit last fall . Gov . Pete Wilson in January proposed raising the fees again to $ 20 per unit . A full semester load is about 15 units . Woodward said campus leaders are already organizing another protest for April 13 that they hope will be more effective . Ventura College_students Brian Henry , 21 , and Mike Hanger , 23 , did attend Tuesday ' s protest , but they were not impressed . &quot; I liked what they were saying , but I didn ' t like the way they were saying it , &quot; Henry said . &quot; They were yelling at us to get_off our butts and do something , but we ' re just the little guys , and those big guys ( in Sacramento ) don ' t care about us. &quot; CONSTANCE SOMMER</TEXT>
