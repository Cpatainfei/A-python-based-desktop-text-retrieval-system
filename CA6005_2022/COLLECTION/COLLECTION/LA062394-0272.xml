   <HEADLINE> THEN , IN THE END ; AS THE SCHOOL_YEAR WINDS DOWN , STUDENTS FACE NEW CHALLENGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> New black parking_lots have given La Quinta High_School a crisp look , just in time for the national education inspectors . Word is in that campus has passed with flying colors . Oh , that all 1 # 300 students here would . Inside the student store , overseen by popular Spanish teacher Larry James , the mood is jocular , the talk_of graduation and summer jobs . In this teen-age community called high_school , the place functions like the town general_store . During lunch and between classes , students drop_in to buy sodas and snacks . James makes change and small_talk . When he ' s coaching volleyball and advising student leaders , the talk can get more personal . He has been a confidante since I was a student here . Regrettably , I divulged nothing to him before I graduated in 1977 , barely surviving in his Spanish class . I spent more time that year aimlessly driving_around in my friend ' s car smoking cigarettes , or making_out with my boyfriend . Ditching school was my escape_from grief and the responsibilities inherited as my mother ' s body slowly surrendered to cancer . Back then I just felt_like a failure , even as senior_class treasurer . James treated me no differently for my absences , and I used to thank him for giving me extra credit for painting a poster : Seniors are Numero Uno . It ' s easier to see now why many students -- boys and girls -- have entrusted James with their triumphs and fears . He and his wife have taken some students into their home while parental battles were worked_out . That has not changed , even as the student population in the past 17 years has shifted from mostly white to mostly Asian , from comfortably middle-class to 40 % of the campus being enrolled in the subsidized lunch program . &quot; Kids are kids , &quot; said James , who was briefly stranded after school one day after loaning his car to a student . &quot; Culture and language are the only differences over the years . Interracial dating is_on the rise , and we sell ( Vietnamese ) grass jelly drink_in the student store now . But the kids ' concerns are the same as they ever were : boyfriends , girlfriends and grades. &quot; * Trouble is more often what we hear about teen-agers , but high_school life here is far more ordinary -- certainly less dramatic -- than crime reports and TB scares . And there is far more good news than bad at this modest campus . A camera panning school life would reveal snapshots of both on some days . The Class of ' 94 is noticeably more academic than others , and five students have tied for valedictorian . Only one gave the commencement speech at exercises for about 300 blue-robed seniors Monday because &quot; otherwise , &quot; principal Mitch Thomas says with a laugh , &quot; we ' d be there all day. &quot; Prom Queen Lynn Phu , the well-liked co-president of the Vietnamese Club , has been accepted at and will attend UC Davis in the fall . This is thanks to her grades and application essay citing her community service and quotations of author Pearl S . Buck . Some kids are takers . She is a giver . Charming and helpful , she hopes to become a schoolteacher . Thanh Tang , student body vice_president and son of restaurant owners , has reached his goal of earning a 4.0 grade point average as this semester ends and will major in business law at UCLA come September . He plans to share a nearby apartment with three other La Quinta classmates . His dream of Harvard was abandoned because Massachusetts is so far from his family , and the cost is too high . But he has already earned a $ 1 # 500 scholarship and has applied for more . Amber McCammack , 18 on Father ' s Day , is trying to find a job , hopefully a full-time clerical position , until she can save enough to move_into an apartment . Then , she says , she will reconsider college . Pregnancy and childbirth in her junior year caused her grades to drop . A clarinet player , she wanted to attend Berklee College of Music in Boston , but audition tapes were_due the first of November , and she missed the deadline due_to marching and concert_band demands . &quot; College is_on the back burner until I know what ' s going_to happen with work and the money situation , &quot; she says . &quot; But I ' ve got a real hope to be something in music . It ' s been in my life since I was born. &quot; She has spent her senior year attending adult-education classes to pick_up office skills and recently took a typing test for an employment_agency looking_for a law office clerk . &quot; They were seeking someone who types at least 40 words per minute , and I stunk on the test , &quot; she said one day after school . &quot; Normally I can type 47 to 50 words per minute , but I did 39 -- I guess because I was nervous. &quot; She hasn ' t heard back . Her grades are pretty good , and she is getting_along well with family and her boyfriend , who got kicked_out of La Quinta for swearing at a teacher and then didn ' t get enrolled at a continuation school . He plays in a rock_band but , Amber says , he will start looking_for a job when he is 18 . She sees him almost daily after school . Two things are weighing most on her mind now , flattening her voice to a dull pitch . &quot; I dunno , &quot; she explains . &quot; Once I turn 18 my mom ' s ( medical ) insurance doesn ' t cover me anymore , so I ' m kinda screwed there . I worry about that a lot . It ' s been_on my mind. &quot; Was there anything else making her blue ? She sighs heavily and gives it up . &quot; I was supposed to get_the_pictures of the baby last month , and I didn ' t , so I ' m kind of pissed . Every three months ( the adoptive mother ) sends them , but she hasn ' t. &quot; Ask her how old her daughter is , and she asks_for the date , then does the math in her head quickly . &quot; She ' s one year , two months and seven days . I last saw pictures of her in February . She ' s got my blue eyes , and she ' s getting curly hair , which her father is pretty happy about . It ' s got red in it . She looks a lot older than she is. &quot; Amber knows that to see the child in_person is unlikely . &quot; Hopefully , when she turns 18 and it ' s legal to look_for her , I will . It ' s funny . I can be in the worst mood , and I come_home and the pictures are sitting there , and I am the happiest person in the world. &quot; She is excited about graduating and detects a strong case of &quot; senioritis &quot; on campus as the school_year closes . &quot; This is how school works : As freshman you are scum ; you are nobody , you are nothing . As sophomores you move a step_up the ladder : You still don ' t know much but you ' re learning . Then you are juniors ; they know everything , they ' re always on the ball . And seniors -- all they can think_of is graduation . &quot; But my junior year I was more worried about having my baby . would n ' t you know it ? My peak year. &quot; She giggles . &quot; Oh , well. &quot; * Students such_as Eric Sizelove seem to have lived several years ' worth of turbulence this semester . The promising water_polo player we met a_few stories ago was kicked_out of La Quinta on March 23 for knocking_out a fellow student with two punches , ruining what coaches expected to be a successful swim team season , possibly even a CIF bid . His dream had been to work_out an athletic scholarship and attend a four-year school , maybe Cal State Long_Beach . But his dismissal , he says , has ruined all that . He feels sorry_for himself , puts the rap on the school . &quot; I went from going somewhere to going nowhere . I blame La Quinta , because La Quinta knew that was going_to happen. &quot; When pushed , he concedes : &quot; I should have backed_away . You know how it is ; it was a stupid mistake on my part . If I would ' ve known what would happen . . . ( but ) I wasn ' t concerned about that . The guy made me mad , and that was it. &quot; A bright student who excels , Eric has the potential to be somebody . But his father dying young and his mother ailing now have left him angry at everyone , says his mother , Elaine Sizelove , 41 , starting to cry . &quot; He hasn ' t dealt with me dying , &quot; she says with difficulty . &quot; He ' s mad at me for that , but we never talk_about it . He says , ' Mom , you used to be able to change the oil on a Harley ( motorcycle ) yourself . Now you can ' t do anything. ' &quot; Eric has struggled through school with a learning disability . Recognizing the strikes against him , principal Thomas , teachers and coaches kept a tight rein on him . When he would start to slip , they would grab his hand . So it was with particular sadness that they sent him away after the fight . He was allowed to attend the Garden Grove Unified School District ' s Lake Continuation School , where all he met were students he deemed losers . So he resumed hanging with the gang members from his neighborhood , near Westminster Avenue and Edwards Street . Deciding he needed a fresh scene , Eric drove each Tuesday to adult_education classes in Riverside , where he earned his final credits toward a high_school degree . But in May he was arrested on a felony charge after a fight in which police pulled_up to find him clutching a Club car security device . Gang members showed_up and broke his car_windows outside a florist , he said , and he chased them . The charges were dismissed , his mother said . He has also been arrested again , this time for carrying a concealed weapon -- a sickle -- in his car . The &quot; grim_reaper thing &quot; belonged_to a friend , he said , along with a toy gun also found beneath his spare tire . Until he sorts_out his problems , he is restless and spending considerable time in his room , where the walls are covered with his pencil drawings and graffiti . Sports trophies cover a dresser top . The good news : Eric says he sees now that he is bound for prison or a path of failures if he does not change_course . He is a bundle of contradicting remarks , though , from one conversation to the next . I tell him I will call before this story runs to make_sure he is not behind bars . He laughs a little , but he knows I am only half-kidding . For now he and his mother are getting_along , they both say , talking tough but honest with each other , painful as it is for both . &quot; He punches walls_in his bedroom , and I say , ' It ' s your bedroom but my home. ' It ' s hard to watch your kid take his lumps , but you have to , &quot; his mother says . &quot; But he ' s trying now . It ' s cool. &quot; &quot; I ' m so scared of going_to jail , &quot; he says , &quot; but if something happens now that I ' m driving_around Orange County now , I ' m gonna have to take_care of it , and if I get caught and go_to jail , I do . &quot; But I ' m changing my life , &quot; he says , saying goodby for now as yet another friend pages him on his beeper . &quot; If I want to do this , I can do this. &quot; * By last week , the La Quinta campus was pumping with passion about two big news_events : the baseball_team ' s ride to glory and a new TB scare . Senior Debi French , who relapsed into a highly drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis late last year , had part of her lung removed in late May to stop the disease after first-line medications failed . Her case attracted a horde of reporters to the school . The attention had students outraged -- not over the disease , but over media coverage . They found it for the most part sensational and misleading . &quot; We ' re tired_of being ' TB High , ' &quot; said civics teacher Doug Mercer . All 1 # 300 students were tested this month for TB . Preliminary screenings showed that 97 additional students and nine staff_members have tested positive for the bacteria that can later cause the disease ( there is a 10 % chance of contracting it in the lifetime of a person testing positive ) . But there are only 17 active cases detected since the problem emerged in 1991 . Hundreds of understandably unnerved parents called or visited the principal ' s office , where they were mostly calmed with the assurance that officials were doing all they could . Parents were told what the students by now had learned : TB is difficult to contract and easy to treat . Those on campus who tested positive for TB have been interviewed by the county health department and the Centers_for_Disease_Control to track all_the people with whom they have had the close contact necessary to transmit the virus . Follow-up work will stretch well into summer . Rather than distance the students , the notoriety has spawned a circle-the-wagons mentality on campus , with students bound together against what they think are ill-informed media and other outsiders . They seem to spare me this wrath because I haven ' t covered the daily new stories . &quot; It ' s drawn us all closer , not apart , &quot; says senior Deanna Del Monte , 17 . At an assembly June 10 , Debi French , who has not returned to class , was presented with a signed ball by the CIF-winning baseball_team . She took briefly to a microphone for a_few tearful words to her schoolmates . &quot; ' I ' m sorry this happened , and I put you through this , ' &quot; Deanna recalls her saying . &quot; Everybody was crying and hugging each other. &quot; The administration served cookies and punch that day as a morale_booster , and it further created a We Survived the Scare bonding . In a 10 a.m. history class last week , the students seemed knowledgeable_about TB . They seemed to accept the testing interruptions and extensive questioning about their associations with people . But they have suffered most , they say , from the subsequent stigma . &quot; The kids who tested positive are still negative for ( active ) TB , and you don ' t get that feeling from the newspaper , &quot; said Amber Jones , 15 . &quot; But even so , my best_friend ' s father didn ' t want to be near me . He made my best_friend wash all_of my clothes that she had at her house. &quot; At a CIF baseball_game at La Quinta , the parent of an opposing team player wore a surgical mask in the bleachers . &quot; I walked by their bus that day , &quot; Deanna says with amazement , &quot; and the players were , you know , being guys ( translation : flirting ) . And they said , ' Do you go_to this school ? ' And I said , ' Would it matter ? ' &quot; So they knew , and they were saying . . . ' TB ' &quot; Getting summer jobs is a major worry for La Quinta students , who say they have been asked by some prospective employers for proof that they have tested negative for TB . &quot; They treat you , &quot; Amber says , &quot; like they treat people who have AIDS . Now we know what that feels like. &quot; Not surprisingly , the principal and others are concerned about any impact the TB situation may have_on enrollment come September , when parents will be allowed_for the first time to decide which district school their child attends . But since the first case of TB among La Quinta students was detected , enrollment has actually risen slightly . Students are otherwise calm about the outbreak -- the nation ' s largest at a school -- and understand that most cases can be treated if addressed early and diligently . * Attention is far more intensely focused_on this week ' s graduation and a future outside the home of the La Quinta Aztecs . A sea of royal_blue gowns and caps fill 357 folding_chairs seating La Quinta High_School ' s Class of ' 94 . Most of the seniors are wearing sunglasses ; others squint into the bright sunlight beating_down on the grass football_field of Bolsa Grande High_School , the closest campus with a stadium big enough for Monday ' s graduation ceremonies . American flags flutter beside the rows of students . Coincidental to this momentous occasion , a pink inflated King Kong floats in the air above a car dealership across the eastbound Garden Grove Freeway that flanks the field . Both light-hearted and brimming with profundity , the commencement speakers quote Henry_David_Thoreau , poet Robert Frost , the Revs . Jesse Jackson and Martin_Luther_King Jr. , Malcolm X , former New York Mayor Ed Koch and U2 lead singer Bono . Introductions are made by a girl-boy team of Naheed Simjee and school newspaper_editor Chris Dutton , both of whom refer to the year ' s major news_events -- on and off campus . &quot; We ' ve been through floods , fires , riots , &quot; Chris recalls , &quot; . . . or what about the earthquake that shook school second_period ? &quot; He reassures his classmates that if they made_it through the TB spotlight , &quot; we can make_it through the times ahead. &quot; Lynn Phu , the aspiring teacher bound for UC Davis , soon takes the podium , urging the people with whom she has spent four pivotal years to always have a dream to chase . She reminds them that they have lived harmoniously inside their campus community in a way many neighborhoods have not yet managed . &quot; The greatest lesson I ' ve ever learned in school came not from a textbook but from all_of you , &quot; Phu tells her classmates . &quot; You ' ve taught me to understand , accept and appreciate each other ' s differences . La Quinta itself is a multicultural society , one that is still in its infant years but has already proven to have the potential of becoming a model for the rest of the world . &quot; It is my belief that every generation that rises in this world brings with it a new culture that is irreplaceable . . . . No matter how much has been said that history repeats itself , I can promise you that there will never be another Class of 1994 , especially the one that you and I know. &quot;</TEXT>
