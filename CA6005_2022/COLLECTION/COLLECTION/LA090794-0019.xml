   <HEADLINE> ' MEDITATIONS ' GOES BEYOND RECOGNITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A wag once said that in our time if you want to be famous , the best thing to be is a rock_star , but if you want to be a failure the best thing to be is an artist . * In this century the artistic impulse is not always the same thing as a lusting after fame . On the contrary , the calling is often a way of fulfilling a creative urge while remaining largely anonymous . Artists of this stamp come second only to poets in obdurate determination to do their thing while protecting their privacy . The point is made by &quot; Three Meditations &quot; at the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena . It consists_of installations by a trio of artists each more interested in contemplation than recognition . Marvin Harden held his first solo show in 1967 at La Cienega ' s lovably rear-guard Ceeje Gallery . It produced a larger crop of honorably obscure artists than any interesting gallery before or since . About the only one to float more-or-less accidentally to larger recognition was Charles Garabedian . Harden , from the beginning , made work so introspective it could barely be seen . He painted or drew very small cows or horses on relatively large formats . About the only embellishment he allowed himself were poetic , slightly wistful titles . In the ensuing decades he confined himself to studios in rural locations , declined to define his art in written statements and never made an issue of the fact he is an African American . About the only changes in his work consisted_of its growing ever smaller ; witness the prints and paintings on view . None is larger than about 3-by-7 inches . All depict a single bird nearly invisible against its background . All paintings are titled with the same brief verse : songs sung ( with grace ) of an inward place , in a stillness , sweet , in morning , mourning in evening , even . He has made his pictures more sumptuous over time . Each frame is marbled gold . Mats are a close match to his images , often rendered in lush texture with metallic pigment . Clearly , however , the intent of all this is to create an atmosphere rather than an impression . Images seem to exist as objects hovering on the brink of disembodiment . They are like the first rays of dawn or the last of dusk . MacRae Wylde is almost literally unknown . Just 30 , he ' s held only four exhibitions in venues each more modest than the last . He ' s hiked around from the Central_American rain_forest to the natural American outback on both coasts . He collects earth and rock that he grinds into painting pigment . His installation is called &quot; Four Places. &quot; Each wall of a small pavilion in mid-gallery bears a number of thick , nearly square paintings , groups of which are in one solid earth hue -- siennas , ochres and grays . Evidently grouped according to the source of the pigment materials , the work brings_to mind severely minimal artists from Malevich to Judd but it doesn ' t matter much . If anything is unimportant here , it is the usual citing of influences evident in the artists ' work . To whatever extent this group has paid_attention to other artists , it has only been with a view to translating other ideas into their private languages . Wylde ' s most interesting piece is &quot; Slocum River. &quot; Two of its large gray compositions cantilever vertically from the wall on their edges , becoming virtually architectural . The artist seems to muse on the primal moment when humans began to apply rational process to the primal ooze . If Wylde is intuitively involved in philosophy , the remaining meditator reaches to cosmology . She goes_by the pseudonym &quot; Madame X , &quot; upping the obscurity ante . She explores &quot; Eternal Culture &quot; in various mandala drawings bearing the usual diagrammatic vortexes , whorls and cryptic writing . But there is nothing scholarly or archeological here . Madame X goes_about this like autobiography . &quot; In the year 0000 Madame X journeyed into the sphere of eternal history , becoming the first to observe its eternal order , &quot; she writes in one mandala . One wall displays a group of &quot; Little Spirits &quot; -- sculpture that look_like an abstract distillation of votive folk carving . An inner sanctum nook encloses a &quot; Model of Time &quot; that is a beautifully formed hinged wooden cone covered with decorative glyphs and containing a double spinning_top . There ' s a whiff of camp about both Mme . X ' s persona and her work , but where is it written an occult seer can ' t have a sense_of_humor ? Her art harks back the adventurous spirit of the late ' 50s , the art of Wallace Berman and George Herms and the films of Kenneth Anger . It ' s both apt and bracing to find this happening in a coercively conformist decade that makes the Eisenhower years look_like a bacchanal . * Armory Center for the Arts , 145 N . Raymond Ave. , Pasadena ; through Oct . 9 , closed Monday , ( 818 ) 792-5101 .</TEXT>
