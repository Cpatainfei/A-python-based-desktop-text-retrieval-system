   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; COUNTY HALTS CITIES ' PARK GRANTS ; RECREATION : FUNDS FOR EQUESTRIAN TRAILS AND BASKETBALL_COURTS -- AMONG OTHERS -- HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED BY BANKRUPTCY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County officials have informed more_than a dozen cities that $ 2.7 million in urban park grants they were promised this year will be suspended indefinitely because of the bankruptcy . The move places in jeopardy park improvement projects from Yorba Linda to Costa Mesa and was described Thursday by city officials as another sign of the magnitude of the financial crisis . &quot; It ' s a disappointment , and it hurts , &quot; Brea Mayor Bev Perry said . &quot; ( But ) given the magnitude of the county crisis , it ' s not unexpected. &quot; City officials will now try to determine if they will have to delay or cancel some of the projects , which range from the repair of equestrian trails to the installation of basketball_courts . The county informed agencies about the grant delays this week . Cities affected by the move include Brea , Costa Mesa , Cypress , Fullerton , La Habra , La Palma , Los Alamitos , Mission Viejo , Orange , Placentia , Santa Ana , Stanton and Yorba Linda , as well as several local youth groups . The grants ranged from $ 5 # 000 to $ 385 # 000 . Kenneth W . Scattergood , chief of program support for the county ' s Harbors , Beaches and Parks Department , said the grant money is frozen in the county treasury because of the bankruptcy and cannot be distributed . The grant money came from the Harbors , Beaches and Parks District , a special district that is funded through property_taxes . Cities applied for the grants earlier this year , and county officials selected recipients in the fall , Scattergood said . Among the hardest-hit cities is Yorba Linda , which expected to use $ 385 # 000 in grants for a variety of projects at parks and other recreational_facilities . The situation has placed in limbo the Adventure Playground at Hurless Barton Park . City officials had hoped to use $ 150 # 000 to relocate the playground , according to Parks and Recreation Director Steve Rudometkin . The city plans to build a gymnasium where the playground is . The city also planned to use grant money to build an access_road at Arroyo Park and improve equestrian trails . Another community feeling the pinch is Rossmoor , which was set to receive $ 300 # 000 in grants that officials intended to use to help convert a vacant school site into a park . Now , those plans are_on hold , said Jim Alexander , a board_member of the Rossmoor Community Services District . &quot; We ' re sitting in a very precarious situation , &quot; Alexander said . &quot; We can ' t ( spend money on the park ) unless it ' s an absolute necessity. &quot; Los Alamitos city officials planned to use $ 239 # 000 in grants to improve five parks and install lights at the McAuliffe Middle_School athletic_field . City_Manager Robert C . Dunek said the city cannot afford to finance the work_on its own and will have to delay the projects . Costa Mesa planned to build outdoor basketball_courts at TeWinkle Park with its $ 216 # 000 grant . Officials said that they were still trying to assess the impact of the county ' s action . In Placentia , the delay of a $ 55 # 000 grant has jeopardized plans to repair the edge of a lake at Tri-City Park . City_Manager Bob D ' Amato said he put the project on hold even though the city has not been officially notified that the grant was frozen . &quot; We were_on the verge of awarding the contract &quot; when the county filed for bankruptcy Dec . 6 , D ' Amato said . &quot; We decided on our own to go_into a hold mode . I ' m assuming the grant will be canceled. &quot; A $ 90 # 000 project to put_up lighting and resurface a basketball_court at Brea Junior_High_School has been suspended indefinitely , officials said . The frozen grant money has prompted Los Alamitos ' Dunek to order a review of all grants the city receives through the county , including Community Development Block_grants , which are used to improve blighted neighborhoods and finance programs for low-income families . He said the review is intended to determine how much money the city is owed and what the city would do if the county cannot turn_over the money . Parks On Hold Because funds are frozen in the county treasury as a result of bankruptcy , Urban Park Grants promised this year will be delayed .
