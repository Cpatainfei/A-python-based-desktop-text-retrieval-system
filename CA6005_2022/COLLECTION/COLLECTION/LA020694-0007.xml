   <HEADLINE> AN EAST-WEST AMBIVALENCE ; IN EUROPE ' S NAME : GERMANY AND THE DIVIDED CONTINENT , BY TIMOTHY GARTON ASH ( RANDOM HOUSE : $ 27.50 ; 680 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This is an ambivalent book about an ambivalent subject : Germany and &quot; Ostpolitik , &quot; its policy toward the East from the late ' 60s to the early ' 90s . A country that itself is the very epitome of ambivalence , Germany has found itself regularly pitted against the West , but it also fought Russia and Poland . In peace , it embraced Enlightenment as well as Romanticism , Western liberalism and Nazi totalitarianism . Frederick the Great of Prussia wrote French and lionized Voltaire , but that did not keep him from militarizing his society and fighting the entire neighborhood -- right , left and center . The Federal Republic ( formerly West Germany ) was born as a child of the West , as progeny of Western strategy in the Cold_War . But it was an uneasy youth . As soon as Konrad Adenauer , the founding_father , had gained entry to NATO in 1955 , he opened a diplomatic channel to Moscow . Hardly had the Berlin Wall gone_up in 1961 , seemingly dividing Europe and East_Germany forever , when Willy Brandt , the future chancellor , began drafting the New Ostpolitik . That policy would eventually position Bonn halfway between an alliance with the West and a separate detente with the East . Today , all_of Germany is in the West , but in truth , the West is no more , and neither is the East . So where does that leave Germany ? &quot; Troubled and burdened , &quot; Timothy Garton Ash concludes in this brilliantly written and researched analysis of East-West diplomacy . The &quot; favorable variant &quot; he had &quot; imagined for Germany and Europe . . . did not seem probable. &quot; Yet , he concludes , &quot; there are worse combinations than that of skepticism and hope. &quot; &quot; Skepticism and hope &quot; -- another expression for ambivalence -- could almost serve as the motto for this book . While Ash , the Oxford scholar , may have liked to deliver hard and fast answers to the age-old question &quot; Whence and whither Germany ? , &quot; he has ended_up writing in the manner of a New York Review of Books essay : learned and magisterial , but with a journalist ' s penchant for drama ; reflective to_the_point of rumination , but with a fine eye for irony and imagery . Ash ' s book is indeed an exciting tale and veritable gold mine of original information . In seven years of research , he gained access to the personal papers of chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt , of Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Egon Bahr , Brandt ' s confidante and architect of the New Ostpolitik . Thanks to the collapse of East_Germany , Ash could also tap into minutes of the Politburo , Central Committee records and files of the Stasi , the East_German secret_police . Ash lets them all speak_for themselves , copiously and patiently . But what did all those leaders really want ? Did they , as Brandt put it , really &quot; accept the results of history &quot; and their definitive attachment to the West ? Or did they -- slowly and craftily -- actually seek to subvert the postwar order by pushing Russians and Americans out of the European center in the name of disengagement and disarmament ? Did West German leaders speak &quot; in Europe ' s name , &quot; all_the while pursuing coldblooded national interests ? Or was Helmut Schmidt , chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , merely acting_as &quot; honest interpreter &quot; for the West when he ventured to Moscow a_few months after the Afghanistan invasion ? &quot; Plain speaking , &quot; Ash notes , &quot; was not Bonn ' s forte . Waffle was. &quot; Here , too , Ash the journalist as historian is the master of ambivalence , and perhaps rightly so . He puts the problem well on Page 2 . It is the difficulty of &quot; distinguishing between what people said in public , what they said or merely thought in private , and , not least , what they think or say now that they thought or said then. &quot; Let this sink_in , and you ' ll understand the perils of contemporary history . Sorting_out reasons and rationalizations , which Ash does with a sharp eye for posturing and obfuscation , becomes even more difficult when , in the middle of it all , history suddenly overturns the gaming board . &quot; Whither Ostpolitik ? &quot; became a moot question on Nov . 9 , 1989 , when East_Germany began to collapse . Less than a year later , Germany was reunified ; by Christmas_Day , 1991 , the Soviet_Union was no more . Suddenly , Bahr ' s schemes or Genscher ' s circumlocutions no longer mattered . It was as if they had worked away at needlepoint when , in a twist of cunning , history hit them with the whole textile factory . Ash , in his cautious and subtle way , does leave us with some lessons worth pondering . For one , he faults Ostpolitik for its excessive , coldhearted realism . For all its pieties ( which Ash deftly skewers ) , Ostpolitik , especially in its Social Democratic variant from 1969 to 1982 , came very close to betraying the very values it purported to uphold . Rather than saying so himself , Ash lets Vaclav Havel -- the Czech writer and dissident who would become President -- speak : &quot; Ostpolitik . . . managed at times to be_well and truly ambiguous . . . . It signified , of course , the first glimmer of hope for a Europe without Cold_War . . . ; yet at_the_same_time -- alas -- it more_than once signified the renunciation of freedom , and hence of a basic condition for any real peace. &quot; Did Ostpolitik and detente really kill them with kindness ? There was certainly plenty of &quot; reassurance , &quot; but very little &quot; relaxation. &quot; In the end , it was not Bonn ' s latter-day Metternichs but Solidarity and the people gathering by the hundreds of thousands in Leipzig that forced liberty from the tightfisted hands of the Communist regimes . In the meantime , Ash ' s book has become a munitions dump from which the left and the right draw freely to snipe away at each other again . Social Democrats see &quot; In Europe ' s Name &quot; as proof consummate that they had always been right : It was Ostpolitik and detente that softened up the Soviet Empire . Further to the right , politicos and publicists point instead to Reagan , SDI and the &quot; Euromissiles &quot; -- the West had simply arms-raced the East to death . To use the book so brazenly as Exhibit X for both sides does Ash wrong . His forte is not the battle-ax but the thin-bladed rapier , always poised to pierce cant and to slash pretense . And he is too scrupulous -- and too subtle -- a historian to hawk a simple message . Was it Brandt-Bahr-Genscher or Reagan-Perle-Baker who undid the Soviet_Union ? Let Ash respond : &quot; The first answer is : both . The second is : neither. &quot;</TEXT>
