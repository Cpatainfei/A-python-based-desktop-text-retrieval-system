   <TEXT> * Little Saigon Supermarket , 9822 Bolsa Ave. , Westminster , ( 714 ) 531-7272 , 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily . The powerful whirling helicopter blades kicked_up thick clouds of dust as Twan Ngo pushed her youngest child into a hovering American chopper . It was April 27 , 1975 , three days before the fall of Saigon and the last time Ngo would see her suburban Saigon home . Many of the 165 # 000 Vietnamese who came_to the United States in the first post-war wave of immigrants were relocated in Northeastern or Midwestern cities . At first the Ngos found themselves in Green_Bay , Wis. , where , as you might expect , they found little in the way of Vietnamese food . Eventually , along with many fellow transplanted Vietnamese , the Ngos wound_up in Orange County near the neighborhood centered_on Bolsa Avenue -- and running from Westminster through Garden Grove to Santa Ana -- that came_to be known as Little Saigon . Lured by the warmer climate and a growing , cohesive Vietnamese community , the Ngos found many ties to their culture here , one of the strongest being the ready availability of Vietnamese foods and ingredients . &quot; You won ' t find most of these vegetables in Wisconsin , &quot; Ngo says , picking_over the greens in the produce section of the bright , ultra-modern Little Saigon Supermarket on Bolsa Ave . By &quot; these vegetables , &quot; she means the dozens of Vietnamese specialties such_as bac ha , the pale green spongy stems that go_into sour soup , or muop huong , a squash resembling a large zucchini . * In recent years , specialty produce farming has turned_into a livelihood for a number of local Vietnamese farmers , evolving hand in_hand with a now-sizable Vietnamese food industry . Many of these California-grown or -made goods are distributed nationwide to serve the million or so Vietnamese who have come_to the United States over the years . At the center of this commercial_activity is Orange County , where Vietnamese residents officially increased 271 % in the last decade ( the Vietnamese-American Political Action Committee contends the number is nearly twice what the census reports ) . The sheer size of this local customer base opened_up a lucrative market for prepared foods as well as shelf-stable items ; in much smaller Vietnamese communities , it probably would n ' t be economic to market these perishables . But at Little Saigon Supermarket , Ngo chooses from an increasing range of Vietnamese-style processed meats , all sorts of fresh noodles , herbs , pickled vegetables and soy products ( such_as fresh tofu and soy milk ) that are impossible to import . The selection has made Vietnamese eating here as close to authentic as it gets outside of Vietnam itself . As the selection shows , Little Saigon Supermarket owner David Tran knows the Vietnamese food business inside and out . Tran came_to the Little Saigon area when it was still in its awkward growth stages -- a mere stretch of bean and strawberry fields , flower warehouses and bottling plants , and just a_few Vietnamese stores and businesses . * He had left Vietnam in ' 78 on a crowded boat and ended_up temporarily in Escondido , learning English and studying to be an electronic technician . Tran found it impossible to support his family on a technician ' s wages , but having been a businessman ( a bicycle wholesaler , to be exact ) in Vietnam , he perceived a growing need for Vietnamese wholesale food distribution . He formed Delta Food_Company and began to supply Orange County ' s escalating number of Vietnamese restaurants and markets with wholesale produce and other ingredients used for Vietnamese and Chinese cooking . As time went_on , local Asian farmers began to produce small quantities of specialty herbs and vegetables . &quot; Some would ask him to distribute them , &quot; says Denise Tran , who is David ' s sister-in-law and also vice-president of the market . The 1975 Vietnam trade_embargo meant an end to Vietnamese imports . Producers in other Asian_countries , particularly Thailand , began putting Vietnamese-language labels on foods they had in common with Vietnam , such_as fish paste , dry rice noodles and curry_powder , and exporting them to the US for the expatriate market . In the beginning , Tran stocked a lot of these items , but they weren ' t created specifically for the Vietnamese palate , and many Vietnamese cooks have never ceased to regard them as mere substitutes . Now , however , Vietnamese in this country are no longer dependent_on imports . They ' re producing their own extravagant assortments of Vietnamese-style sauces , spice blends , pickled fish , fresh rice_papers , deli foods , sweets , beverages and baked_goods , all made in America . * There ' s as much competition among the various brands of these foods as there is between American breakfast cereal or coffee companies . You see five or six styles of curry_powder and at least that many of the fresh hot chile sauce called tuong ot toi ( not to mention many other varieties of hot_sauce ) . Four companies manufacture the skinny fresh rice-noodle cakes called banh hoi and at least half_a_dozen make the bologna-like Vietnamese sausages chua lua and cha bi . The UPC bar-coded packages of fish dumpling paste in the freezer case also come from several companies . In addition , Little Saigon Supermarket stocks prepared deli foods such_as cakes , vegetable-filled rice noodle rolls , taro balls , mung_bean desserts and other tidbits , all from bakeries and snack shops in the area . These are displayed on a huge table in the middle of the store and their packaging is still rather basic : foam trays enveloped in shrink wrap or &quot; clam shell &quot; boxes designed for take-out foods . But the manufactured foods ' packaging is starting to get more sophisticated . Now there are even convenience products such_as spice packets to flavor duck_soup , mixes for Vietnamese rice rolls and a Hamburger Helper-like mix to season bo kho , the Vietnamese beef_stew . So far though , no Vietnamese TV_dinners have become part of this burgeoning industry ' s repertoire . Shopping List It ' s not possible to cover all_the locally made Vietnamese products here but this will give you a little taste of what ' s out there . SOUP SEASONING MIXES Noodle soups are a daily food in Vietnam , as popular as breakfast cereals or hamburgers in this country . Over there , few people bother to make them at_home , since the soups are sold on practically every street_corner . Expatriates apparently take a different view , for there are scores of styles and brands of convenience-style soup seasoning blends on the market . These aren ' t instant soups but rather a combination of spices in a tea bag-like sachet that you cook ( usually with meat ) to make broth with just the right taste . Vifaco , in La Mesa , makes seasoning for pho , the famous Vietnamese beef noodle soup , and they ' ve put fairly good English directions on their box . ( You can also get the right meats for this soup in the butcher section and the proper fresh thin rice noodles in the fresh rice noodle section , near the produce. ) Anise , cinnamon , ginger and allspice are the soup ' s predominating flavors . Pho originated_in the beef-eating North , but in Hue , where the food is spicy , they use beef and pork-hock for their soup called bun bo Hue ( pronounced boon bo whey ) . Bun is the style of fresh rice noodle that goes_into the soup ; bo is the braised beef that garnishes it . Kung Sing , based in Santa Ana , makes bun bo Hue seasonings , available in sachets . Kung Sing also makes a pho seasoning and has a long list of seasoning mixes_in its line . Not to be outdone by all this , the D &amp; D Gold Product Corporation in Santa Ana , which often packages products under the Golden Bell label , has the exclusive_rights to manufacture a pho soup seasoning base from a recipe of the well-known noodle soup restaurant_chain Pho Hoa . ( For a Vietnamese company that ' s kind of like having the recipe for McDonald ' s secret sauce. ) Joseph Dinh , the nephew of one of D &amp; D ' s owners , suggests that for the best flavor , you should not make soup the regular way , adding the spices at the beginning . Instead , you should simmer meat and onion in water until the broth is almost done and add the seasoning packet only in the last 30 minutes . D &amp; D also makes seasoning packets for duck noodle soup and is a manufacturer of Vietnamese-style spice mixes , condiments , and mixes for flour products such_as dumplings and pancakes . One of the company ' s principles , Sam Tieu , manufactured chile paste and plum_sauce in Vietnam . At first he worked as a chef in this country and eventually used his food production expertise to become a major partner in D &amp; G Gold which does have an excellent chile sauce in its line . CURRY PASTE AND POWDER Although the_French and Chinese have left a more significant mark on Vietnam ' s cooking , India has contributed curry , primarily in the south . Unlike the Thais , with their various red , green , orange , yellow and roasted curry mixtures , the Vietnamese have just one sort of cari ( as they call it ) . It ' s Madras-style , ocher-colored and tasting predominantly of the warm Indian spices : turmeric , cinnamon , cloves and cumin . What goes_into the curry dish is another matter -- it may be chicken with lemon grass , or shrimp or squid or tofu . I ' ve even had goat curry in our Vietnamese restaurants . Little Saigon Supermarket devotes a sizeable hunk of shelf space to curry_powder mixtures and curry pastes suspended in oil . Kung Sing brand cari ni an do is the curry_powder and cari dau an do is the paste . Golden Bell , of Pho Hoa fame , also makes curry_powder and paste , as does Zesty Foods , the distributor for Pepper House International . MORE SEASONING MIXES : Among the spice mixtures in Kung Sing ' s extensive line is Seasoning for Orange Duck . The instructions are in English and Vietnamese and they tell you blend the seasoning mix with butter , rub it on four pounds of whole duck legs , then bake . Kung Sing also makes Oriental Spices for Catfish . Denise Tran says , &quot; You simply sprinkle on the filleted fish before cooking it , preferably over charcoal -- but broiling is OK. &quot; Bo Kho Seasoning : Vietnamese beef_stew , which has Chinese seasonings and is served with French_bread , is basically a simple dish to make ; the only complicated thing is gathering the long list of seasonings that go_into it . To the rescue : Kung Sing ' s gia vi nau kho , which means ( roughly translated ) &quot; stew seasonings. &quot; You use the seasoning to marinate the stew beef before simmering it in liquid . Fresh Chile Sauce : Many companies make Vietnamese fresh chile sauce called tuong ot toi , but Huy Fong brand is the one that seems to be everywhere -- from Mexican delis to gourmet shops . Maybe it ' s because Huy Fong was smart enough to print the label in Spanish , French , Chinese and English as well as Vietnamese . This sauce of roughly pureed fresh red chiles , with their seeds , is potent -- nothing you ' d want to dip corn_chips into . Huy Fong also makes a chile and garlic_sauce and a smooth seedless chile puree labled Sriracha , after the Thai sauce . MARINATED , PRESERVED FISH PRODUCTS Mrs . Binh Harrison started Viet-My , her fish importing and packing company , in Alexandria , Va. , back in 1972 . She procured Vietnamese mudfish , gourami and anchovies , marinated them and packed them in the Vietnamese manner ( but in a USDA-approved plant , using the purest sea salt , imported from Holland ) . To most Vietnamese , the flavor of these salted fish is as basic as salt and pepper in a Western setting . Without them , certain dishes are like garlic_bread without the garlic . When the embargo cut_off her import supply , Harrison had to scout around for a new way to get the salted fish she required . After an unsuccessful attempt to make her product from Thai preserved fish , she eventually found a Singaporean supplier that could cure the product to her exacting standards . The freshwater_fish she uses , such_as mudfish and gourami , must be cleaned and salted down within 40 minutes of being alive . And what do you do with Viet-My ' s anchovies of the East ? Mam thai chau doc , which is marinated fillet of salted mudfish , is the obligatory seasoning for mam chung , a sort of steamed Vietnamese-style meatloaf . It ' s also eaten with pork_belly slices with mint and herbs , rolled in rice_paper burrito-style . Mam nem xay , or ground anchovies , is an essential ingredient in the dipping sauce for Vietnamese-style beef_fondue and many other dishes . And mam loc chau doc , whole salted and marinated mudfish , is delicious steamed under a layer of seasoned pork puree ( see meats ) . Viet-My now makes about 16 other products including a soy bean paste sauce called tuong bac cu da , which serves as a dipping sauce for fried tofu or stir-fried rau muong ( Chinese watercress ) . Because it is high in protein , tuong bac cua ca is popular as a vegetarian food . BEVERAGES Mighty Soy , Vita Soy , Wy Ky Foods , Soy Foods of America and Visoy Foods are all makers of soy milk . Both Chinese and Vietnamese love this lightly beany-tasting liquid as breakfast . They often eat the unsweetened version warm with a dash of chile oil and Chinese crullers ( yu t ' iau , which are sold here in the deli area ) . The sweetened soy drinks aren ' t ignored at breakfast , but they are also popular as a pick-me-up snack and come_in_handy six-ounce bottles as well as larger containers . Visoy also makes an herb-infused sugar_cane drink that they label Imperatae and Cane Drink . No one could figure_out what imperatae means , but the Chinese characters on Visoy ' s label say that the cane juice is steeped with mao gen , a plant or medicinal herb that is thought to be a cooling element in the diet . This is why the drink is so popular on hot days . If sugar_cane juice doesn ' t sound appealing , you might want to try Visoy ' s Iced Chrysanthemum Tea . Roasted Brown_Rice Drink Mix : This mild-tasting flour with roasty overtones contains barely a trace of sugar . The label claims it is good for babies and explains that you can drink it hot or cold . The drink is another product made by Kung Sing spice company . According to Denise Tran , you mix it into milk or water like Milo ( a prepared drink like Ovaltine , popular all_over Southeast_Asia ) . GREEN VEGETABLES Little Saigon Supermarket ' s produce department has all sorts of vegetables I ' d never seen before my visit . Fortunately , I met Mrs . Tuyet Luu , a steady customer at the store , who explained in great detail how to cook my newly discovered greens . &quot; For this , &quot; she said of the muop huong , a large slender green squash , &quot; you peel_off the skin and fry your meat in garlic first and then toss_in the squash for a_few minutes , because it cooks very fast. &quot; It ' s also best to cut the squash , which has a slightly spongy texture , into rather large pieces so it won ' t overcook so readily . For soups , muop huong is traditionally paired with rau den , the red_amaranth leaves often called Chinese spinach or red spinach . Chile leaves may be called la ot or rau ot in Vietnamese . Unlike the spicy fruit of the chile plant , the pointy , triangular leaves have a mild flavor , rather like a somewhat intense spinach . Because their texture is more substantial , they are much easier than spinach to fry . There are often delicious little flowers in the bunches , and both leaves and flowers are wonderful deep-fried . Mrs . Luu also suggests using them in shrimp soup or any stir-fry dish . Dot bi , or opo squash leaves , are broad and slightly fuzzy with hollow stems . I suggest removing the stems because I find them harsh-tasting and stringy , but the leaves lose their slightly fuzzy quality when they are cooked in broth . La trau , also known as betel_palm , are flat , sturdy , vividly green leaves shaped like teardrops . They are not for cooking but &quot; for the old people to chew , &quot; in Tran ' s words . Can nuoc is a milder breed of celery than the Chinese_celery called ca vin in Vietnamese . The latter is added_to stir-fries as a seasoning , while can nuoc is stir-fried either with meat or on its own . It ' s especially good with strips of beef , Mrs . Luu says . NOODLES The 1 # 000-year Chinese presence in Vietnam imposed more_than chopsticks and stir-frying on the local eating habits . It also left noodles , which loom large in the Vietnamese diet . Noodles are not just lunch dishes or midnight snacks . They appear at almost every meal -- in soups , in stir-fries , or mixed with bits of meat or fish and fresh herbs and wrapped in lettuce and / or rice_paper . You have to go_to three parts of the market to see all_the noodles . Dry noodles are_on the right wall at the front of the store . There ' s a cooler in one of the aisles for fresh wheat noodles . Fresh Rice Noodles : Fresh rice noodles , which come_in half_a_dozen widths , have their own section next to the produce department . They include products from the V.N. noodle company and Ban Hoi Chao Doc No . 2 , who make the fresh rice vermicelli called bun toi . Several other companies make the familiar wide flat rice noodles . You can tell competition is fierce in the fresh rice noodle business because there are at least four brands of banh hoi . These are lacy noodle doilies that look_like they ' ve been made from thread . Banh hoi are used like a tortilla to pick_up morsels of barbecued meat or grilled meat balls wrapped in a morsel of lettuce and garnished with a_few leafy herbs from the ever-present Vietnamese salad platter . MEATS Cold Cuts : The Vietnamese love their French-inspired cold cuts , and they show_up in many guises . Thinly sliced , they ' re eaten with sheer rice noodle sheets , several sprigs of a fresh herb and dipping sauce . Or they may be layered on a French roll spread with mayonnaise to make the Vietnamese-style submarine_sandwiches called banh mi . There are products from no fewer than six meat companies in Little Saigon Supermarket ' s cooler against the back wall and in the freezer opposite it . A random_sampling of their wares would find the inevitable cha lua ( also called gio lua ) , with its bologna-like texture and banana-leaf wrapper . Cha bi has a similar flavor but a crunchy texture from pork skin threads . There ' s a Vietnamese version of fromage de tete ( head cheese ) -- unappetizingly labeled by one company as &quot; steamed pig ' s head loaf. &quot; All these and more sausage varieties are produced by Great Wall , Great River , Tay Ho , Phu Huong and the Viet-Hung Paris company . Que Hong , another meat company , makes thit doi , a cured pork roll with an ultra-thin wrapping of steamed pork-skin . The snowy covering makes the roll look_like a cylindrical French pate . Meat Balls : A popular specialty made by Que Hong , among several other companies , is bo vien , a smooth-textured meat ball that is put into soups and used as one of the ingredients in hot-pot dinners . Tay Ho makes a seasoned , ground pork mix , nem nuong , which is usually made into meatballs and barbecued . Similarly , Phu Hong makes gio song , a smooth seasoned pork paste that can also be barbecued or mixed with salted fish and steamed as a sort of meat_loaf . The paste is sold frozen . Frozen Fish Paste : If fish meat emulsion doesn ' t strike you as particularly appetizing , you haven ' t yet learned to ignore the creative names on some Asian labels . If you were to call the Gai Phat Food_company ' s fish paste a quenelle base , or even a dumpling , it might be more appealing . In any case , this smooth puree of mild fish is lightly seasoned with garlic , onion and spices and its wonderful fried as little patties or scooped with two spoons into tiny egg shapes and poached in hot broth .</TEXT>
