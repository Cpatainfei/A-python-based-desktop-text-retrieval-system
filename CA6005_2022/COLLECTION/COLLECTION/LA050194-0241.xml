   <HEADLINE> BLACK INFANT DEATHS WILL TRIPLE WHITE BY 2000 AT CURRENT RATE , OFFICIALS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Black babies will be three times more likely to die than white babies by the year 2000 if the gap in the U.S. infant_mortality_rate continues to widen , federal health officials warned Friday . Blacks ' risk of dying before their first birthday was twice that of whites in 1960 , the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention said.The disparity is even greater now . From 1980 to 1991 , the most recent year for which data are available , the rate of black infant deaths dropped 20.7 % , from 22.2 to 17.6 per 1 # 000 births . But the rate for whites fell 33 % , from 10.9 to 7.3 per 1 # 000 , the CDC said in its weekly report . The report did not include figures on other ethnic_groups . At least two-thirds of the gap was_due to an increase in the number of very low birth weights among black newborns , the CDC said . Overall , the U.S. infant_mortality_rate was 8.9 per 1 # 000 births in 1991 , down 29.4 % from 12.6 in 1980 , the CDC said .</TEXT>
