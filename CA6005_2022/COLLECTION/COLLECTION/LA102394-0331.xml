   <TEXT> Los Angeles County judges and prosecutors have considerably softened the blow of California ' s new &quot; three strikes &quot; law , sending only one in six eligible defendants to prison for the 25 years to life prescribed for three-time losers . In the six months since the law was enacted , in fact , defendants in cases involving third &quot; strikes &quot; were just as likely to be sentenced to a year in jail as they were to be put_away for life , a study by The Times found . The Times reviewed all 98 &quot; third-strike &quot; cases that were resolved between March , when the law took_effect , and Aug . 31 . Defendants in most of these cases were shoplifters and drug abusers . Fewer than one in five were accused of crimes of violence . Although most defendants were spared life sentences , many received longer terms than they would have before &quot; three strikes &quot; because the threat of life terms gave prosecutors more leverage to negotiate tougher plea bargains . For example , a man who stole diapers from a supermarket was sentenced to eight years in prison , and another was sent_away for eight years for possession of a rock of cocaine and a bag of marijuana . In Orange County , the new law has thus far ensnared mainly drug_users and burglars , underscoring the complaints of critics who say that the law targets the wrong defendants . Of the 94 men and women charged under the new law , only 18 face new felony charges for crimes of violence , according to a list of &quot; three strikes &quot; defendants compiled by the Orange County district_attorney ' s office . Deciding whether repeat offenders should get life , a year in jail , or something in between can be a wrenching experience for judges and prosecutors . &quot; When talking_about a person ' s life , there ' s no such thing as an easy decision , &quot; said Philip H . Wynn , head deputy district_attorney in the Van Nuys office . More_than 500 crimes that are felonies under California law , ranging from placing a bet in an office pool to murder , can constitute a third &quot; strike &quot; under the law if an offender has been previously convicted of two or more serious or violent crimes . The law makes no distinction between offenses . As a result , many judges and some prosecutors have tried to draw their own lines . Some have differentiated between violent and nonviolent crimes , while others have given special consideration to defendants whose most serious offense was far behind them , The Times found . For example , Judge Carol J . Fieldhouse , a key member of the Los Angeles County Superior_Court ' s special committee to study the impact of &quot; three strikes , &quot; said that although violent criminals deserve to be sent_away for life , people he considers to be &quot; nuisances &quot; do not . &quot; I refuse to dispense injustice , &quot; Fieldhouse said , adding that judges must find ways to &quot; outwit &quot; the law . &quot; I wasn ' t put here to annihilate people because some politically hungry morons wanted ( me ) to. &quot; The &quot; three strikes &quot; law signed by Gov . Pete Wilson in March was intended to toughen sentencing of repeat offenders by limiting the discretion of judges and prosecutors . Under the law , which voters will be asked to reaffirm on the Nov . 8 ballot in the form of Proposition 184 , criminals with one prior conviction for serious or violent crimes are supposed to be sentenced to double the usual term . Criminals with two or more such &quot; strikes &quot; who commit any new felony are subject_to a prison_term of triple the usual amount_of_time or 25 years to life , whichever is greater . The law , however , also preserves some discretion for prosecutors by giving them the authority to ignore a defendant ' s past &quot; strike &quot; in the &quot; furtherance of justice. &quot; Judges were not explicitly given that authority . A Times analysis of the 98 resolved &quot; third-strike &quot; cases found that although some felons are getting longer prison_terms , judges and prosecutors have exercised their powers to moderate the impact of the new law . In court and in interviews , they emphasized their obligation to act in the interest of justice within the constraints of the law . &quot; You want to bend over backward to be fair to community , the intent of legislation , the spirit of the law and , at_the_same_time , be fair to the person charged with the crime , &quot; said Wynn of the district_attorney ' s office . Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti said in an interview that some of his prosecutors find it traumatic to seek a life sentence for a minor offense , even if a defendant ' s criminal history is serious . But , he said , prosecutors have to adjust their &quot; mind-set &quot; to the community ' s growing impatience with business as usual . What prosecutors &quot; feel is justice may be at_odds with what the community wants or expects in terms of justice , &quot; he said . The author of the &quot; three strikes &quot; law , Assemblyman Bill Jones ( R-Fresno ) , indicated that he was not surprised by The Times ' findings . Acknowledging that district_attorneys and judges retain considerable discretion , he said he never expected that everyone who was eligible would get life terms . But he said he believes the law is effective as a deterrent by telling would-be three-time losers : &quot; Stop committing felonies in California. &quot; In the cases examined by The Times , judges and prosecutors largely agreed on how to handle more serious offenses , such_as residential burglary , robbery or rape . But judges concluded that prosecutors did not show enough defendants the compassion they deserved . In those cases , judges acted_on their own to reduce penalties . Deputy district_attorneys gave breaks to 25 defendants , while judges took action that benefited 27 more . In cases in which prosecutors ignored a &quot; strike , &quot; the average prison_term was five years . Some judges claimed pre-existing law gave them the power to ignore a past &quot; strike &quot; even though &quot; three strikes &quot; did not . More commonly , they used their well-established authority to reduce certain felonies to misdemeanors , which are punishable by no more_than a year in jail . In cases in which judges intervened , defendants went_away for an average of 2 1 / 2 years . Fourteen of the 97 defendants were sentenced to life and another is awaiting imposition of a life term . Thirty-one others had their cases dropped or settled because the prosecution did not have enough evidence against them . Garcetti said he has been told by his staff that they are exercising their discretion to ignore &quot; strikes &quot; in fewer than 10 % of all &quot; third-strike &quot; cases . He said the Times_study overstated his office ' s willingness to ignore &quot; strikes &quot; by looking only at resolved cases , and not the more_than 800 &quot; third-strike &quot; cases filed_in the same period that are still pending . He added that he was troubled by the inconsistencies in sentences documented by The Times , but blamed them on judges . &quot; Why should one person get a one-year county jail sentence and the other get , in_essence , a life sentence ? &quot; he asked . In general , those who received the maximum sentence had committed more serious offenses as their third &quot; strike. &quot; They had burglarized a residence while a terrified homeowner watched , held_up a gas_station armed with a pellet gun or sodomized a cellmate at knifepoint . But their ranks also included people who stole a bicycle , sold a single rock of cocaine to an undercover police_officer or were seen by police in a parked stolen car . The criminal history of those who got life and those who received lighter sentences appeared similar . Most were thieves with drug habits , according to probation reports and criminal histories , and most had been convicted in the past of at least one crime of violence , such_as robbery . At an average age of 35 , they were a decade older than the age at which experts figure the average criminal is most active . Most were unemployed and many were homeless , such_as John B . Fernandez . One hot day in July , Fernandez -- still on parole after a 1982 armed-robbery conviction -- plucked two 40-ounce bottles of beer from a cooler in a San Fernando liquor_store and told the clerk to call police ; he ' d be drinking the beer outside . Fernandez later told police he wanted to go_back to prison because &quot; he was hungry. &quot; Because of the nature of Fernandez ' s offense , Deputy Dist . Atty . Mark Vezzani chose to ignore a &quot; strike &quot; -- a 1981 robbery_conviction . In turn , Fernandez pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison , a more severe penalty than he would likely have received prior to &quot; three strikes. &quot; Vezzani wrote in the case file that he asked his superiors for permission to handle the case as a misdemeanor , but was denied . He complained that such decisions will cause the system to be flooded with trivial cases . &quot; This is a classic example of why the law is doomed to destruction -- the sooner the better , &quot; he wrote . Within the district_attorney ' s office , there are conflicting views_as to how the law should be applied . Like many of his colleagues , Dist . Atty . Garcetti favors a version of &quot; three strikes &quot; that would target only serious or violent offenders with life terms . But he has directed his deputies in written memos to enforce the law fully and to use their discretion to cut deals only in &quot; rare &quot; cases . At a meeting in August , supervisors from the branch offices were split over whether that policy was just . Some said their scruples demanded that they be given greater discretion to ignore prior &quot; strikes. &quot; Denis K . Petty , the head prosecutor in Torrance , said he told Garcetti that he intended to follow his own conscience in deciding when it was appropriate to seek life sentences on a third &quot; strike. &quot; According to him and others who attended the meeting , Garcetti said nothing . Petty said he took that to be tacit approval of his position , and said he has since shown mercy to more three-time losers than any of his colleagues . Donald Isaac Peoples is a case_in_point . Petty said he could not bring himself to &quot; put a guy away for 25 to life for stealing underwear. &quot; So Petty ignored one &quot; strike &quot; and Peoples pleaded guilty . He was sentenced to four years in prison . Other supervisors have said they feel obligated to follow Garcetti ' s written policy . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s fair , but it ' s the law , and I have a duty to enforce the law , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Kenneth C . Wullschleger , a supervisor in the Downtown criminal_courts building . He said he has sought life sentences against drug_users even though he personally believes the punishment to be unjust . Judges have criticized the district_attorney ' s office for failing to exercise discretion more often . Many have tried to make deals on_their_own , over the D.A. ' s objection and despite the fact that the law does not empower them to ignore a &quot; strike. &quot; Long_Beach Superior_Court Judge Arthur Jean decided to intervene in the case of Calvin Bailey , 29 . Bailey , who had been convicted in 1986 of two robberies , faced life imprisonment for walking_out_of K Mart with $ 225 worth of merchandise that included toothpaste , razors , a camera and a pair of jeans . Jean decided to ignore one of Bailey ' s &quot; strikes &quot; and sentence him to seven years in prison . &quot; In a basic shoplifting situation , to commit somebody to prison for life appears to me to be foolish , foolish and unfair -- terribly , terribly unfair and wrong , &quot; Jean said in court . Prosecutors have appealed his decision , arguing that only they have the power to ignore a &quot; strike. &quot; &quot; Maybe the appellate_courts will make me do these things , &quot; Jean said from the bench . &quot; I hope not . I hope to God not. &quot; Many predict that pressure will grow to make deals . With &quot; three strikes &quot; still in its infancy , much of the debate within the judiciary and the district_attorney ' s office has focused_on issues of fairness and justice . But , with time , more practical concerns may dominate the discussion . By the end of August , 800 cases involving a third &quot; strike &quot; remained unresolved . Most of those cases will go_to trial unless prosecutors and judges cut deals . If they don ' t , there will be a shortage of courtrooms , judges , public_defenders and prosecutors . The math is simple but powerful : Before &quot; three strikes , &quot; an overburdened court system resolved its caseload because district_attorneys and judges used plea bargains to settle nine of every 10 felony cases before trials . A &quot; three strikes &quot; defendant facing 25 years to life is unlikely to plead guilty unless someone offers him a better deal . &quot; A huge wave ( of trials ) is building and building and building , &quot; said Los Angeles County Public_Defender Michael P . Judge . Already , criminal cases are trickling into civil courtrooms . One judge reported that he has interrupted civil trials -- sending home plaintiffs , defendants and witnesses -- to make room for criminal defendants who are entitled to speedy trials . &quot; When the system reaches the point where it is bulging and exploding , which it will . . . I think D.A.s will exercise more discretion , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Peter Berman , a supervisor in the Downtown criminal_courts building . Garcetti , however , said he has no intention of giving his deputies greater leeway to settle cases . &quot; I expect there will be more judges who will feel the pressure of the number of cases that the criminal system has to deal with and start exercising their discretion , &quot; he said , promising to fight those who intervene too often . In the meantime , judges and district_attorneys are searching for standards of fairness to apply to the myriad cases they handle daily . The six cases detailed here illustrate the variety of solutions that have emerged from that collective search . The Rapist While many prosecutors and judges wrestle with their consciences over sending shoplifters and drug abusers to prison for life , none expressed such concerns for Hilton Booker . Booker , 37 , began getting_in trouble as a teen-ager when he was convicted of robberies , burglaries and drug possession . Over the next two decades , the criminal justice system was a revolving door that repeatedly put him back on the street . Without fail , Booker would be arrested within months of his release from prison -- for robbery , stealing a car , shooting at a house or fighting , according to probation records . He accrued 10 aliases and came_to be known in prison as &quot; Prince. &quot; A month after his release in June , 1993 , Booker was arrested for the rape of a prostitute in Lancaster . While serving a prison sentence in that case , he and a partner beat_up and repeatedly raped a fellow cellmate at knifepoint . A sentencing report prepared by the Probation Department said Booker &quot; could easily fit the description of the type of convict the community has been talking_about who should probably spend , if not the rest of his life , at least 25 years ( in prison ) . &quot; Booker was sentenced in August to 42 years to life by a judge who piled on extra penalties . The Shoplifter Terrence J . Carello had been shoplifting meals three or four times a day from his neighborhood Lucky ' s in Long_Beach . The 6-foot , 5-inch Carello had more_than one conversation with the store ' s much-smaller security_guard about his habit of not paying_for food . He informed the guard that he planned to continue stealing food for his family . In May , however , a police_officer happened by soon after one of Carello ' s visits and caught him with pilfered pancake mix , syrup , sausages and Kool-Aid . Carello had racked_up six shoplifting convictions during one three-year period in the early 1980s . As a teen-ager and young adult , he had committed a robbery and a burglary . As a result , he faced 25 years to life until Patricia Ryan , who heads the district_attorney ' s Long_Beach office , agreed to ignore one of the previous offenses . She said she was willing to accept less than life in prison because Carello had not been violent or even threatening in this case . Carello will go_to state_prison for more_than 10 years . Before &quot; three strikes , &quot; the offense probably would have gotten him no more_than a_few months in jail . The Drug Abuser Dennis Allen Lyon had been arrested for jaywalking . Then the deputy who stopped him found he was carrying enough methamphetamine to get him high , or send him to prison for life . Lyon , 39 , had been in and out of jails and prisons for 20 years on drug and theft charges related to his almost daily use of marijuana , heroin , cocaine and speed , according to a probation report . Two of his thefts -- a robbery and residential burglary he had committed 12 years ago -- were classified as &quot; serious , &quot; and the charge of drug possession was his third &quot; strike. &quot; Pasadena Superior_Court Judge Dino Fulgoni thought a life sentence in Lyon ' s case was inappropriate . Such a penalty would have been an &quot; unconscionable way to treat the defendant , who is a pathetic drug_addict , and an unconscionable way to treat the people of California , because they need the prison space for people who are more violent , currently , than he is , &quot; Fulgoni said in an interview . &quot; I think this guy belongs in prison ; don ' t get me wrong , &quot; Fulgoni said . &quot; But he comes far from belonging in prison for life. &quot; Fulgoni said he does not believe he has the authority to ignore a &quot; strike. &quot; So he exercised another option : He reduced Lyon ' s drug charge to a misdemeanor . Misdemeanors , by definition , carry a penalty of no more_than a year in jail . that ' s what Lyon got . &quot; Without the cooperation of the D.A. , the statute gives me the option of putting him in jail for a year for a misdemeanor or committing the injustice of putting him in jail for life , &quot; Fulgoni said . The Diaper Thief The case against Rudy Roman Rodriguez was simple . &quot; He told officers that he had been drinking a little , he remembered that he needed some diapers at_home , so he went and took some , &quot; a probation_officer wrote . Rodriguez , 31 , who had been convicted of robberies in 1982 and 1990 , was caught this time shoplifting a $ 29.99 pack of Huggies from a Downey supermarket . Norwalk Superior_Court Judge Robert W . Armstrong , who could not see sentencing Rodriguez to life , maneuvered prosecutors into a compromise by threatening to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor . Prosecutors agreed to ignore a &quot; strike , &quot; which allowed Armstrong to sentence Rodriguez to eight years . &quot; If they were not willing to back_down on this . . . I would have taken it into my own hands and he ' d have gotten a year , &quot; the judge said in an interview . Armstrong said he felt it was his &quot; obligation to temper justice with mercy . . . . I ' m not going_to be cowed by politicians who I think are pandering to the public to take_advantage of the public ' s fear of crime. &quot; The Abusive Boyfriend In Christopher Renault Kinsey , prosecutors had a chance to lock_away forever someone they thought was a menace . But they also had a problem : a weak case . Kinsey , 30 , was accused of attacking his live-in girlfriend days before she was to give_birth to their second child . But the victim wasn ' t willing to cooperate , even though Kinsey had served prison time for assaulting her while she was pregnant with their first child . With their key witness shaky , prosecutors offered Kinsey six years in return for a guilty plea . He wasn ' t interested . Kinsey decided to try his luck with a jury . If his gamble failed , he would almost certainly face life because of his long , violent record . He had been convicted of two attempted robberies at ATM machines and the robbery of a woman pushing a baby stroller . According to his lawyer , Deputy Public_Defender Mitchell Bruckner , Kinsey changed his mind 15 minutes into jury selection , but the prosecutor told him that her supervisor said the deal was no longer on the table . &quot; ' You ' re 15 minutes too late , ' &quot; Bruckner recalled the prosecutor telling him . The prosecutor , Deputy Dist . Atty . Meredith Rust , remembered it somewhat differently . It was more like two hours , she said . Kinsey was convicted and sentenced to 29 years to life . The Tire Thief Girmai Gabremahdin , 27 , was headed for life in prison until Long_Beach Judge William T . Garner stepped_in . During a monthlong , cocaine-driven crime spree that began in December , 1986 , Gabremahdin was a notorious &quot; bump-and-run &quot; bandit in Santa Monica . He pleaded guilty to robbing 21 women , most of them lone motorists whose cars he had intentionally hit so he could grab their purses . He served four years of an eight-year sentence , then stayed out of big trouble until 2 a.m. one rainy night last March , a week after the &quot; three strikes &quot; law became effective . Gabremahdin ' s car got a flat_tire and he didn ' t have a spare . He was caught taking one from a Wilmington junkyard ; a jury convicted him of theft . Garner acknowledged Gabremahdin ' s violent criminal past but refused to sentence him to life . Instead , he sentenced him to a year in jail . &quot; This is a misdemeanor , &quot; Garner said . &quot; It should have been prosecuted as a misdemeanor. &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . Dolores ( Dee ) Turner , who prosecuted the case , called Garner ' s decision outrageous . &quot; Whatever we think_about the statute , the Legislature clearly intended this guy when they passed it , &quot; she said .
