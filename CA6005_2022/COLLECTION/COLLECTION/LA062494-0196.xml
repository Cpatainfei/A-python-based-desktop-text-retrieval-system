   <TEXT> La Mamma is the same dominant figure in Italy today that she was in Caesar ' s time , but she is raising fewer bambini than ever , and her changing role is forcing a social revolution in a country that is running_out of children . A land where baby clothes hanging_on urban wash lines has been as much a tradition as pasta is now graying rapidly . Italy ' s birthrate today is the lowest in its history and the lowest in the world -- 1.3 babies per woman . And that number is falling . The decline has been a long_time building ; now , long-range scenarios of its impact are beginning to alarm some specialists . And for the first time , the Italian government is casting_about for social and economic_policy initiatives to revitalize the family . Italy ' s bambini gap is at once a product of change and a catalyst for further change . On the one hand , it triggers here-and-now challenges that reach_into every corner of national life . On the other , it implicitly offers an against-the-odds chance for a new life to ambitious immigrants like Fan Shu Li . When she left her native town near Shanghai four years ago , Fan says , she knew coffee as an exotic luxury that only foreigners drank . Now , she serves cappuccino for a living in the shadow of the 2 # 000-year-old Pantheon here -- one of thousands of new arrivals doing jobs for which there are too few native Italians . If current rates persist , in another century instead of 57 million Italians there will be about 15 million , half older than 60 , said Antonio Golini , director of the government-financed Institute for Population Studies . &quot; High or low fertility only become dangerous if they last too long . Italy is reaching that point , &quot; he said . &quot; If the trend continues for another five to 10 years , it will be really alarming , because it becomes so difficult to reverse. &quot; Numbers , Golini notes , are inexorable . If Italy ' s birthrate were to rise overnight to two children per woman , it would still take 30 years for the population to grow . Italy is aging quickest , but all_of Western Europe is shunning children in the waning years of a tumultuous era . Europe had about one-third the world ' s population when the 20th Century began . Today , it has one-tenth , the consequence of both its falling population and exponential growth in the Third_World . Fertility_rates for Europe of 2.8 in 1965 fell to 2.1 in 1975 , and to about 1.5 by 1990 . By 2020 , there will be 4 million fewer West Europeans . Among the 12 member states of the European Union , only in Ireland are enough babies being born to keep the population growing . Italy , where Pope John Paul II regularly rails against birth_control , is the most notorious dropout : Already there are only 83 children younger than 14 for every 100 adults older than 65 . There are 11.5 million Italians younger than 18 ; that is 4 million fewer than 20 years ago . Despite unflagging Vatican opposition to artificial birth_control and abortion , Catholic Spain and Portugal join Orthodox Greece and formerly Communist eastern Germany near the bottom of the European fertility charts . In Italy , big , close-knit families have historically formed the backbone of society : Jobs , recommendations , partnerships , doctors , plumbers , priests , lawyers -- all sprang from a seemingly endless chain of cousins and in-laws . Even 20 years ago , children were still fashionable , as one New York woman discovered when she married a Roman . &quot; We have six , and not a lot of money but faith in their futures , &quot; said Gretchen Triulzi , 54 . &quot; I think people these days are more materialistic . They want designer clothes and to keep the lifestyle they had as singles . Me ? I ' d do_it my way all_over again. &quot; More typical of today ' s mother , Monica Falcone is a professional woman who has just turned 40 and has a 5-year-old son . &quot; I think we have been affected by the fact there is no more child culture in Italy . There is no space for children , socially or even physically in a city with few parks , playgrounds and nursery_schools , &quot; she said . &quot; Someone once said that I haven ' t allowed my life to be built around my child . She meant that as a compliment , but I ' m not sure I like it. &quot; What triggered Italy ' s dramatic turn_away from children ? All the same things that have lowered birthrates in other parts of the industrialized world , says Carla Collicelli , deputy director of Censis , a private research_center : industrialization , education , communications , the pill . &quot; What is different in Italy is the speed of change . It was an agrarian country , and women came late to the labor_market , &quot; Collicelli said . &quot; Now , women working is a question of economics but also of identity. &quot; * In the United States , 2.1 births per woman keep the population stable . In Italy , women tell pollsters that 2.2 children is their ideal . In fact , they are having one baby less . &quot; We call the difference between the ideal and reality the ' deficit child , ' &quot; Golini said . Ever-high economic and social expectations are often the reason for the deficit child . Stress , infertility and the fact that male attitudes have not changed much are also part of the equation , he said . As ever , kids are women ' s work in Italy . Often for a mother with a job outside the home , her second child is one cradle too many . Maternity benefits are liberal , and women routinely return to their jobs . But if , for instance , after a second child a woman wants a job less than full time , the workplace has trouble accommodating her . Collicelli laments what she calls &quot; an absence of flexibility &quot; in employment laws . About 5 % of jobs are filled by part-time workers , the lowest percentage in Europe , Golini said . In places like Britain and the_Netherlands , part-timers are as much as 30 % of the work_force . &quot; Women want to work , but the problem in Italy is that once you leave there ' s no way back , &quot; said Collicelli . By now , the shortfall is taking a national toll . In such cities as Venice , where the population is rapidly dwindling , public_schools actively compete for students -- to save teachers ' jobs . Across Italy , small_towns that once bristled with energy are becoming melancholic preserves for the old ; the women in their kitchens , the men with their canes and wool caps around the piazza reliving old times . * &quot; There are no jobs here , people go_to the cities , population is dropping , the family is in crisis -- so we decided to do something about it , &quot; said Ivo Boscardin , a 44-year-old schoolteacher and part-time mayor of Enego , a mountain village of 2 # 300 people in northern Italy . To encourage growth , the City_Council will pay about $ 400 per year in nursery_school fees for parents who have three or more children . &quot; It is only a gesture , but judging from the national response , it has touched a nerve , &quot; Boscardin said by phone . More_than civic vitality is hostage to the deficit children . The national health and pension systems are in financial distress . They will need drastic overhaul as Italians retire , grow older and fall ill with proportionately fewer of their countrymen and women to shoulder the cost . Already , the government pays more pensions than there are people working in Italy , and as in the United States , many workers are deferring retirement until they can afford it . Think_of this : fewer people in a rich country and an array of necessary , sweaty jobs that Italians will no longer do despite serious unemployment among the young . The combination makes Italy an inviting target for enterprising outsiders . Last month , police on Italy ' s Adriatic coast broke_up a ring smuggling Asians and East Europeans into the country via Albania . Large Italian cities such_as Milan and Rome are still more homogeneous than big cities in France or Britain . But they are rapidly acquiring an international cast that can be only partly explained by an official 30 # 000 immigrants a year . For the record , about 1 million foreigners live_in Italy , but some estimates say there are as_many as 400 # 000 more . Rafaele Ciarelli , a law professor who counsels immigrant groups , estimates that 200 # 000 foreigners are in Rome -- 120 # 000 of them illegally . Rodrigo Hidalgo , president of an association of expatriate Peruvians , says there are 60 # 000 in Italy -- 40 # 000 of them illegal . The newcomers ' presence is pervasive . Italians still work as seamstresses , but not many as house cleaners : The homes of well-to-do Romans are cleaned almost exclusively by Filipinas and other Asians . &quot; Fifty years ago , my relatives in Tuscany remember asking black American GIs for permission to touch them -- they had never seen a black_person , &quot; said John Navone , a Jesuit theologian from Seattle who has lived_in Italy for 31 years . There is hardly_a sidewalk in central Rome without Senegalese salesmen hawking faux designer sunglasses and pocketbooks . And knots of Roman Somalis , Ethiopians and Nigerians form and dissolve around the clock at the vast Termini train_station . At the high end of the economic scale , boutiques of Italian designers in cities like Rome and Florence boast Japanese sales clerks . There is a boomlet of Korean and Indian restaurants in Rome . When a fellow bread buyer couldn ' t speak basic Italian early one recent morning , she was offered help in French , under the assumption she was West_African . She replied in Portuguese -- she was a Brazilian newly arrived to cook for a wealthy family . During the Cold_War , it was Poles who washed windshields at Roman traffic_lights . By now they have moved_into blue-collar industries and Fiats of_their_own , and the best corners are patrolled by North Africans and Bangladeshis . Navone remembers a single hard-to-find Chinese restaurant when he came_to Rome 30 years ago . Now , they are everywhere , the only ethnic food ( discounting American hamburgers and french fries ) to make a dent in King Pasta . Sociologist Collicelli was surprised to learn the nationality of the oven master at a legendary Roman pizza_parlor : &quot; A Filipino ? That is interesting . So many pizza makers are Egyptians nowadays. &quot; Two of the three movements in Italy ' s young right-wing coalition government are anti-immigrant . The &quot; they ' ll overrun us &quot; school spews alarming figures . At current rates , in 30 years Italy ' s population will drift from 57 million to about 52 million . At their present levels of growth , in that same period Morocco will go from 26 million to 47 million , Nigeria from 115 million to 285 million and Iran from 61 million to 144 million . Immigrants from all three countries routinely come_to Italy -- legally or not . &quot; At the moment , we see no economic , social or cultural factors to make the numbers change for Italy , &quot; said Golini . &quot; The state should act to remove obstacles that stop people from having the children they would like . We need practical changes and structural changes. &quot; An innovation of the new government of Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi ( a billionaire father of five ) is a Ministry of the Family presided over by 49-year-old child psychiatrist Antonio Guidi . * Guidi , a father of three who took_office last month , foresees across-the-board reforms to strengthen the family : expanding child_care , making_it easier for employers to hire part-time workers , offering tax relief for couples with_children and financial_aid to young families buying a house . &quot; Many couples who decide to start a family don ' t know how . There is no house , and no work . What we must do is find ways to help them , &quot; Guidi said . And , he said , the government must win_back Italian cities from the automobile and make them more livable for families . Reformers who hope to reverse population decline say official audacity can help : Sweden ' s birthrate soared after women who had two children within 30 months were offered two long , well-paid leaves . In larger Italy , though , it is clear that the bambini gap will be a long_time closing . That is hardly dismaying to thousands of new Romans like Fan Shu Li . &quot; My name is Ana now . I ' m here to stay , &quot; she said . Ana ' s Italian is still shaky , but she makes cappuccino like a Roman .</TEXT>
