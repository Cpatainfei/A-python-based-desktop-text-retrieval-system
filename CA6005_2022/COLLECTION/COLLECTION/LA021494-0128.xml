   <TEXT> Moe was not aware that First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was in_attendance at Kvitfjell when he won the gold medal in men ' s downhill . Moe : &quot; When they said Hillary was here , I thought they meant Hilary Lindh. &quot; Lindh is a member of the U.S. women ' s ski team . * Rather quietly , American Kyle Rasmussen has supplanted AJ Kitt on the U.S. downhill depth chart . Rasmussen finished 11th in Sunday ' s downhill , missing a top 10 spot by one-hundreth of a second , and only sixth-tenths of a seconds out of first . &quot; I just had another solid , good run , &quot; Rasmussen said . &quot; Like I ' ve been having the last month or so . One of these weeks I ' m going_to break_through . This is my best finish in ( international ) competition . It was a good run and I ' ve got_to be happy with it. &quot; CHRIS DUFRESNE</TEXT>
