   <HEADLINE> SOME SAY CULT HAD REPLACED LEADER ; QUEBEC : GROUP ' S TREASURER SAYS NEW CHIEF DIED IN SWITZERLAND . MEMBERS WHO REPORTEDLY JOINED SPLINTER_GROUP WERE ALSO AMONG VICTIMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As specialists , friends and associates tried Friday to shed more light on the doomed Swiss-Quebec cult that is somehow mired in more_than 50 deaths , the picture only grew murkier . In fact , the cult ' s treasurer insists that Luc Jouret , the supposed chief of the cult now sought by the_Swiss police , lost the leadership position seven years ago and took three of its most prominent members -- all apparently among the dead found in Switzerland -- out of the cult with him a_few years later . This version of events -- which contradicts Quebec and Swiss police reports that describe Jouret as the cult ' s current leader -- was repeated by Roger Giguere , treasurer of the Order of the Solar Temple , to both the Montreal Gazette and a Quebec radio_station . Giguere said Jouret was succeeded as president and grand master of the order by Robert Falardeau , a Quebec civil_servant who was one of the victims in the mass murder-suicide in Switzerland . Giguere acknowledged that Jouret , a Belgian doctor , was an incredibly dynamic speaker . But he said the doctor become too egotistical and too outlandish in his futurist predictions for the taste of most order members . Jouret then founded another sect , known as ARCHS -- the_French acronym for the Academy of Research and Knowledge of the High Sciences . He then won the allegiance of temple members such_as Mayor Robert Ostiguy of the town of Richelieu , his wife and Quebec journalist Joce-Lyne Grand ' Maison . All three died in Switzerland this week . Giguere ' s comments may simply represent an attempt by surviving members of the order in Quebec -- estimates of their number vary from 30 to 50 -- to disassociate the group from Jouret now that he is officially a fugitive . But there is evidence that there had been some kind of split within the order in recent years and that Jouret had a penchant for setting_up new , yet interlocking , organizations in both Quebec and Switzerland . To confuse matters even more , some police believe that the real power behind Jouret was a Swiss businessman named Joseph Di Mambro , who was Jouret ' s partner in the ownership of the three buildings that served as cult headquarters . Government-run Radio Canada reported that Di Mambro may have used the cult as a front for an international arms-smuggling ring . Radio Canada said Di Mambro sold the arms and laundered millions of dollars in Canadian banks and in the purchase of real_estate that he then sold to cult members . Some kind of financial crisis may have overtaken these organizations recently . Giguere said Falardeau had gone_to Europe to straighten_out business dealings involving the European branch of the Solar Temple . Falardeau had informed him by phone recently , Giguere said , that the Europeans wanted to depose Falardeau and stop paying dues_to the Quebec temple . Friends and relatives continued to insist Friday that the victims were upstanding citizens who had joined the Solar Temple only because of Jouret ' s motivational teachings and their desire for an intense religious experience . Those who knew that their friends had joined the temple did not think_of the sect as bizarre in any way . La Presse , a Montreal newspaper , reported that the journalist Grand ' Maison had twice proposed that the editors hire her as their Swiss correspondent . She had traveled often to Switzerland , she told the editors , and had many friends there . Paul Audsley , her British husband , told Radio Canada he believed she had become less involved with the cult in the last few years , although she continued her close friendship with other members . &quot; I knew members of the order , &quot; Audsley said . &quot; They were very normal people with many responsibilities . They wanted to do something positive in this world and to go_farther than others. &quot; In Sainte-Anne-de-la-Perade , where the Solar Temple operated an organic farm , neighbor Danielle Auclair told La Presse : &quot; Don ' t judge ! It ' s too easy and , what ' s more , they are gentle people who live_in harmony with nature , in equilibrium with themselves. &quot; Auclair said she had worked_on the farm and listened to lectures by Jouret but had never joined the sect . She said Jouret , in the lectures , &quot; offered us a way of living and , as he had so_much magnetism and charisma , the things he taught were extremely attractive. &quot;</TEXT>
