   <HEADLINE> SMOKE GETS IN HIS EYES ( AND ON HIS NERVES )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Let me tell you about the tyranny of secondhand smoke . I cough every morning for about two hours just to get my lungs open . Lately , I have a constant need to clear my throat and chest , which takes the form of a loud and guttural grunt not unlike the noises heard during war sequences of Kurosawa movies . It can be a social handicap . I quit smoking ( puffing , not inhaling , occasional cigars ) in 1980 . I had no congestion problem ; it just seemed like a smart thing to do . Then , as the decade progressed , I noticed a nagging congestion that worsened , year by year . By 1986 , allergy seasons were hellish periods when I would stay awake all night , drinking hot water , breathing steam and coughing_up phlegm , just to recover some lung capacity . A doctor diagnosed my condition as &quot; mild asthma &quot; and gave me an inhaler . I threw it away ( yes , it was denial ) and opted for improving my diet and increasing exercise . Three years ago , I sniffed_out the culprit . I had always noticed that my 50-year-old apartment_building smelled musty . I stupidly attributed this to &quot; old building smell &quot; -- that is , until a friend identified the odor as the acrid stench of secondhand cigarettes . No , I didn ' t live above a bar , but I might as well have . My downstairs neighbor , you see , was an elderly woman whose life centered around listening to the Dodgers and sucking on generic-brand cigarettes . She sat in her apartment , all day and often all night , chain smoking . The smoke would accumulate to_the_point that it would literally pump out of her opened front_door , through her windows , and up into my apartment -- entering through my door , windows and , most insidiously , through the gas_heater vent . I suddenly realized I had spent about 10 years being poisoned . Good lungs don ' t run in my family . My mother , a heavy smoker , died of congestive_heart_failure . My father was plagued by occasional lung infections and pneumonia . My grandfather , an immigrant coal_miner in Ohio , suffered from black_lung . You guessed it -- I am rather frightened . My secondhand-smoke allergy has reached a point where the slightest whiff causes congestion , wheezing , chest tightness , discomfort . Prolonged exposure gives me sharp pains , and leaves me short of breath . I have a constant odd sensation in my bronchial_tubes -- they feel sort of stiff , as if they are made of balsa_wood . Many have been the nights when I have awakened at 3 a.m. gasping for breath because my downstairs neighbor had decided to puff away her insomnia . I have begun most days with a sore_throat . My neighbor -- call her Mrs . Butts , in honor of the Doonesbury character -- and I have always had a cordial relationship . In fact , because she was elderly and alone , I have gone_to great lengths to be kind to her . I have shopped for her ( sometimes at my own expense ) , picked_up prescriptions for her , bought her pumpkin_pies at Thanksgiving , driven her to the bus_station and back when she goes_to visit relatives , changed her light_bulbs , moved her furniture , fitted her toilet with a special seat . What ' s more , I phoned her in the hospital when she had her hip replaced , and after she was struck by a car and left with a broken arm . I gave her many pep talks . I spent hours listening to her prattle , out of pity . I drove her to the hospital and back during several medical emergencies . On one especially memorable hospital trip , Mrs . Butts lost_control of her . . . uh . . . bodily_functions . . . in the front seat of my car while we were stuck_on the freeway during a heat_wave . &quot; Don ' t worry , &quot; I advised , &quot; happens to the best of us ! &quot; On the morning of the earthquake , I wrapped her in a blanket , gave her my radio , calmed her down and persuaded her to phone her grandson and leave the crippled building for the day . I once argued against a neighbor who wanted to persuade authorities that the woman was too old to care_for herself . Frankly , I never even liked Mrs . Butts . I was just trying to be a decent guy . The smoke pouring into my home was so powerful that even my clothes and hair smelled of cigarettes . Move , friends advised . I considered it . But even with rent control , on my glorious income as a free-lance writer I might have afforded a pretty good place Downtown -- say , around 2nd and Main . Instead , I bought an air purifier and two smokeless ashtrays for Mrs . Butts ( one for her occasionally visiting , chain-smoking son. ) It didn ' t help . The short version of this story is that naughty Mrs . Butts fibbed about using the ashtrays , ultimately took_to sneering at me , laughing snidely at my claims that her smoke was affecting me ( &quot; Oh , how does_it get_in your apartment ! &quot; ) , and telling cigarette-addicted neighbors things like , &quot; Look_out ! Oh God , don ' t light that cigarette ! Here comes Rip ! &quot; My last , and always doggedly polite , written request imploring her to use the smokeless ashtrays -- in which I detailed my health_problems and suggested that it ' s entirely possible that my life has been shortened by her secondhand smoke -- elicited no response . Just increased smoke . She and her son seemed to take sport in attempting to smoke me right out of my home . That was it . She had no apparent respect for my privacy or my health . I opted to follow a similar policy . I changed my lifestyle from being an extremely quiet neighbor to doing pretty much whatever I damned well pleased . This included setting_up my drums , which I play very poorly , and practicing about an hour a day . She complained to the landlord , who gently asked her to use the ashtrays . Her response : &quot; I ' ve smoked since I was 17 . I ' ll never stop ! I don ' t like those ashtrays ! They make_noise ! &quot; ( They contain tiny fans. ) Now when I mentioned the tyranny of smoke , I was also referring to its hold_on the smoker . The lady ' s humanity was held hostage by the little white tubes . What ' s more , Mrs . Butts is one of those people who takes the attitude that smoking is an act of death-defiance -- that smokers are cavalier , philosophical souls who are showing the world they aren ' t afraid to die . I ' ve noticed that many media commentators adopt this same attitude -- and in a not entirely tongue-in-cheek manner . One recent commentary in this newspaper took that very position -- that smokers are to be celebrated for being &quot; the only ones prepared to tell the truth about the inevitability of life and death , &quot; as opposed to those who have , as the commentator put it , replaced holiness with health . ( I submit that this sophomoric and insensitive notion is also inaccurate . Nonsmokers -- especially those with lung problems -- are so acutely aware of death that they are trying to legislate secondhand smoke_out of existence. ) Here ' s the point that Mrs . Butts , and all_the commentators and the tobacco companies who scoff at nonsmokers battling to breathe smoke-free air either ignore or do not understand : Not everybody has leather lungs like Mrs . Butts , who has lived into her 80s . The smoke that might not bother you might , in fact , send an asthmatic scurrying in mortal terror . The vast increase in asthma in this country has been widely reported . There are a whole_lot of people with lung problems , and a whole_lot of people who don ' t want lung problems . I ' ll just bet they constitute a majority . As for Mrs . Butts , well , she has moved far away . Never thanked me for all_the years of watching_out for her , the kindness , never said goodby . Left her home of 40-plus years to live with her son in nicotine Nirvana . Presumably , they are now smoking themselves silly . And as I sit in my apartment , freely breathing that great fresh mixture of combustion-engine particulate matter and oxygen known as Los Angeles air , I have a wish to convey to Mrs . Butts , her son and to the smokers ' rights commentators , and especially to the tobacco_industry , which is bitterly campaigning to convince people that the dangers of secondhand smoke are so_much hot_air . Here ' s my wish : May you all wind_up in that place where the smoke billows thick and strong for all eternity . With nary a lozenge in_sight .</TEXT>
