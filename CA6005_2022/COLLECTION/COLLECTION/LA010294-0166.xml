   <HEADLINE> THE NBA / MARK HEISLER ; RESOLUTIONS WAITING TO BE BROKEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> New Year ' s resolutions for some of our favorites : Michael Jordan -- It was great getting_away from it all . Now I want to go_to spring_training with the White Sox , join the golf tour and fly my Lear jet up_to Nova Scotia to see a total_eclipse of the sun . After that , I ' ve got_to win my money back from that chump in San Diego . Charles Barkley -- If Mike retires , I ' m gone , too . Oh , he ' s back ? David Stern -- How about a seniors circuit , guys ? NBC will carry it and do a Saturday show too , like Inside Puff , er , Stuff . Quinn Buckner -- If I get another TV gig , I ' m hanging onto it . That was something I could do . One week , USA Today ' s Rudy Martzke said I had_the_best line of everyone : &quot; Chicago looks tough. &quot; Mike Fratello -- I hear you , Mighty . Rudy praised me for : &quot; The Bulls have to give the ball to Jordan here. &quot; Willis Reed -- If I ever get another GM job , I will not trade for Benoit Benjamin even though he was a great player for me at Creighton . Chuck Daly -- Next time I interview for a job , my first question will be : Did Benoit Benjamin ever play for you in college ? Benoit Benjamin -- $ 3.2 million a year , 15 minutes a game . Is this a great country or what ? Donald T . Sterling -- Pia ' s coming_to this spring ' s lottery party , so don ' t miss it . Is Ron Grinker representing Glen Robinson ? Oh , we don ' t have our pick ? Never mind . Danny Manning -- It ' s been great fun , but it was just one of those things . Ron Harper -- I ' m outta here , I ' m outta here , I ' m outta here . You ' re offering $ 3 million a year ? You just bought yourself a basketball_player . Randy Pfund -- I ' d better learn to relate to my young players . What ' s &quot; Off the pig &quot; mean ? Ahmad Rashad -- I ' m tired_of people saying I ' m Michael Jordan ' s bobo . I ' m going_to be my own man , at least in public . More cocoa , Mike ? Pat Riley -- My resolutions will be published by Putnam ( $ 22.95 , $ 28 in Canada ) under the title , &quot; Ruminations of a Winner. &quot; Shaquille O ' Neal -- Peace on earth , good_will toward all men . Is the interview over ? Here ' s a copy of my CD , &quot; ShaqDiesel. &quot; Check_out the third track : &quot; Zo Go 2 Hell. &quot; Alonzo Mourning -- So he ' s three inches bigger , 50 pounds heavier , has 4 % body fat , pulls_down backboards , leads the league in scoring , appears in a commercial every five minutes and out-earned me by $ 12 million last year ? What else does he have that I don ' t ? George Shinn -- I ' ll never give another player $ 84 million if they have to push him into my office in a wheelchair . Larry Johnson -- Next summer , charity game , breakaway , crowd going nuts ? I ' m going_to lay it up . Dennis Rodman -- Hare_Krishna , Hare_Krishna , Hare Rama , Krishna Krishna . . . . Don Nelson -- Not that I ' m superstitious , but step_on a crack , break your point guard ' s back . Larry Brown -- My traveling days are over . I ' m happy to be in . . . . Where is this again ? Magic Johnson -- I ' m not going_to say one controversial thing this year . No . Really . LATEST DISPATCHES FROM THE PIT The Clippers are going_back to UC Irvine for another camp this week ? Great . Maybe they can make that Danny Manning-Glen Rice deal they pulled_out of their last time there . Indeed , Heat boss Lew Schaffel said the Clippers called_up last week to see if Miami was still interested . The Heat was . Unfortunately , Ron Grinker wasn ' t . Schaffel said Manning ' s agent now refuses to negotiate , even with a team Danny wanted to go_to 12 weeks ago , with which he had agreed to a $ 5.5-million-a-year contract . With no assurance of keeping Manning , the Heat passed . Grinker is only doing what he said he would when the Clippers killed the Miami deal . Unless he relents , they ' re not likely to find a buyer at any price and , if Manning leaves via free_agency , would get nothing for him . Meanwhile , back on the front_lines . . . . Years of organizational chaos have produced a roster-wide funk . The Clippers should go 41-41 by accident except they ' re barely bothering to show_up for games . After losses , someone like Harper and Mark Aguirre protests they were flat , they didn ' t show_up , this is intolerable , etc . Aguirre might get himself ejected and swat some fan ' s popcorn all_over the court . The next game , everyone comes_out flat again . Forget Irvine . Try Lourdes . JERRY REYNOLDS , DEC . 1990-DEC . 1993 We regret to report the resignation , probably forced , of the Sacramento general_manager , a funny guy who deserved a break but succumbed to the twin menaces , bad_luck and new ownership . Even with one of the premium lottery slots , you have to be lucky in the draw . For every Orlando or Charlotte , there ' s a Sacramento or Washington -- one great player away and lacking only the good_fortune to get him . The Kings drew a No . 1 overall pick once , but it was in the woeful 1989 draft . They chose Pervis Ellison over Danny Ferry , Stacey King and Sean Elliott . The rest of the time , they got lower choices and had to settle for Walt Williams instead of Shaquille O ' Neal , Billy Owens instead of Larry Johnson , Bobby Hurley instead of Chris Webber . It ' s something to remember as the Lakers begin their lottery era and the Clippers finish squandering the last of their riches . Opportunities are precious . Success is precarious . As Reynolds could tell you , that ' s show_biz . In his honor , a_few of his greatest hits : -- Assuring King fans they would like new pickup Jim Les : &quot; I ' m willing to stake what ' s left of my credibility on it. &quot; -- After seeing himself on TV : &quot; I told my wife , ' I look_like a fat , little hillbilly. ' She said , ' that ' s because you are , dear. ' &quot; -- On getting a contract last season after having worked without one for two years : &quot; People were sniffing around this job like lions sniffing_out the weak antelope . It ' s a typical contract -- five years or 50 losses , whichever comes first. &quot; -- On owner Jim Thomas ' state_of_mind as the Kings struggled this season : &quot; Oh , it ' s great . Jim ' s like ( King Coach ) Garry ( St . Jean ) and myself . He ' s having a good time with it . Of course , he has advantages we don ' t. &quot; FACES AND FIGURES Seasons greetings , Western-style : Sun Coach Paul Westphal , delighted after victories at Seattle and at_home over Houston : &quot; Nothing in December means anything , but we ruined two teams ' Christmas. &quot; . . . Right you are , Santa : After the loss to Phoenix , SuperSonic Coach George Karl yelled at publicist Cheri White , closed the door to his office , yelled at the walls and never came_out to face reporters . &quot; I didn ' t want to ruin my Christmas or anyone else ' s , &quot; Karl said later . . . . No wonder Atlanta and Chicago are such surprises -- someone in the woeful East has to win some games . There isn ' t an Eastern team that can ' t be beaten on its home court . The Knicks have lost at_home to the Jazz , Rockets and Nets . The Hawks have lost to the Pacers ; the Bulls to the Heat . The Rockets , Suns and SuperSonics have lost a total of three games at_home , two to each other . Going_into Sunday ' s games , the East was 22 games under . 500 . Add panic : They ' re recircling the wagons in Charlotte , where Larry Johnson played his best game of the season -- 29 points , 20 rebounds -- and came_out of it with his back sore . First announcement by the Hornets : This was &quot; totally unrelated &quot; to his other back problems . ( What , those were in a different back ? ) Second announcement : Team physician Glenn Perry says a connection &quot; can ' t be discounted. &quot; Prognosis : Johnson will be gone &quot; three to 30 days. &quot; Bottom_line : Johnson went_on the injured list , meaning he ' ll be out at least 10 days . . . . Isiah Thomas ' contract is up this season , and he ' s upset that his longtime patron , Piston owner Bill Davidson , hasn ' t stepped_up with a Jerry Buss-type $ 10-million balloon payment . Thomas , who usually plays through fractures , took last week off with a strained arch . He ' s lucky Davidson doesn ' t take_out a contract on him . . . . Clyde Drexler ' s legs may_not be as shot as his head . Portland insiders say his troubles started with his announcement he deserved a $ 17-million ballon payment , which Trail Blazer management treated with scorn , even if Clyde , at $ 1.4 million , was No . 6 on the payroll . Drexler apologized , sulked , slumped , then sprained an ankle and went_on the injured list . Portland got hot without him ; now teammates whisper the ball moves better without him . The Knicks continue to stumble , and they ' re getting jittery . &quot; I ' m not convinced with Charles Smith and Hubert Davis , both injured , we have what it takes_to get_it done , &quot; said team President Dave Checketts . &quot; We ' ve got_to add a piece to this puzzle to win it all this year. &quot; . . . And Checketts on what happened : &quot; Maybe the rules have taken something away . We ' re not nearly as physical as we were last year . We ' re unable to play that way . We ' re timid overall. &quot; . . . Comment : Wrong . The Knicks are still No . 1 in defense -- almost five full_points below last season ' s average of 95 points . Their problem is their two-man , Patrick Ewing-John Starks offense , No . 18 in the league . The Buck isn ' t stopping here : Buck Williams ' sore heels feel better , and he ' s playing his best ball in years , averaging 10 points , 11 rebounds and shooting 59 % . However , his contract is up , and Trail Blazer management wants his $ 1.8-million slot for a young free_agent . &quot; I won ' t be spending Christmas next year in Portland , that ' s certain , &quot; Williams said . &quot; I can ' t say I ' m not a little disappointed. &quot; . . . There are young teams -- Charlotte , Orlando -- in dire need of a power forward with Williams ' kind of tangibles and intangibles . Whoever finishes second in the Horace Grant derby will have a wonderful fall-back position . Learning experience : Shaquille O ' Neal , still railing he can ' t get a call , got bounced from his second game of the season , No . 4 of his 109-game career . For good measure , referee Bennett Salvatore tossed teammate Jeff Turner and two Magic fans . . . . Former Cavalier Coach Lenny Wilkens , defending his old team , more or less : &quot; They ' re not soft . They ' re finesse players . What I ' m saying , we never had a guy on the team who was a tough-minded , physical player . But you don ' t throw_out what you have unless you get something better. &quot; . . . Celtic Coach Chris Ford , acknowledging the obvious : &quot; It ' s an issue , but I can ' t allow these guys to fall_back and say , ' We ' re just not as talented. ' Then we ' d just be rolling_over . We ' ve got 12 guys on the roster . Let ' s get the most out of them. &quot; . . . Sun guard Danny Ainge , after Boston ' s Dino Radja went_for 14 : &quot; People said he struggled . Struggled ? He got_up 14 shots in only 18 minutes . He ' s my idol. &quot;</TEXT>
