   <HEADLINE> STABLE WHOLESALE PRICES EASE INFLATION WORRIES ; ECONOMY : ANALYSTS ARE ENCOURAGED AS MARCH INDEX RISES ONLY 0.2 % . MARKETS ARE UNAFFECTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steady energy costs helped offset a rise in food prices as wholesale price inflation was in check_in March , the government said Tuesday . The report eased inflation worries just one day before a much-anticipated report on consumer prices , and financial markets -- which have been shaken recently by expectations of rising inflation and interest_rates -- were stable . Wholesale prices rose 0.2 % last month , and for the first_quarter of 1994 they were up at an annual rate of 3.9 % , the Labor_Department said . For all_of last year , they were up only 0.2 % . The index measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer . The Labor_Department is_due to announce today the consumer_price_index for March ; most analysts predict a modest increase . Economists said that even though some commodity prices rose -- with storms and icy weather driving fruit and vegetable prices higher -- the overall picture is tranquil . &quot; I ' m trying to worry . But I can ' t find much to worry about , &quot; said Ron Schreibman of the National Assn . of Wholesaler Distributors . &quot; Inflation is the rhinoceros in the room that everyone fears but no one can locate. &quot; Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . said inflation will continue to be tame as long as labor costs remain low . The Clinton_Administration hailed the report as further evidence that inflation is under_control . &quot; We just don ' t see a scenario under which inflation rises meaningfully from present levels , &quot; Deputy Treasury_Secretary Roger Altman said . The government ' s producer_price_index had jumped 0.5 % in February , the largest increase in 10 months , because of surging heating costs . March ' s increase matched January ' s 0.2 % advance . Energy prices , which soared 2.8 % in February as Americans turned_up their thermostats to ward_off winter ' s chill , were level in March as spring arrived . Gasoline prices declined 1.8 % and heating_oil was down 0.7 % . But gas for home heating increased 1.9 % , breaking the previous record of 1.5 % set_in June , 1993 , and October , 1992 . Food prices , down 0.4 % in February , shot_up 0.5 % last month .
