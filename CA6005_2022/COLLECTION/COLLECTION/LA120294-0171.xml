   <HEADLINE> THE GATT VOTE : IMPACT ON BUSINESS ; INDUSTRY-BY-INDUSTRY IMPACT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The GATT agreement will pare tariff barriers , cut subsidies and protect intellectual property_rights . Here is brief look_at the impact on various U.S. industries : * Agriculture : American farmers will be able to boost sales of wheat , corn and rice . European subsidies for agriculture will decrease , and Japan will buy increasing amounts of U.S. rice , beef and dairy_products . California growers should benefit substantially . * Aircraft : The European Union will restrict its heavy financial subsidies for the Airbus . This will help expand worldwide sales for American-made planes , with Boeing , Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas standing to benefit . Apparel : U.S. clothing manufacturers are expected to be hit hard by rising imports . But California ' s bustling industry , with local designers and fast turnaround_times , should be able to handle the competitive pressure by keeping_in close touch with rapidly changing fashions and styles . * Automobiles : Voluntary restraints by Japan on auto shipments will end , allowing expanded sales to the United States and Europe . But American auto exports , particularly of parts , will be helped by reductions in tariffs . * Movies and television : The industry is disappointed because foreign governments can still enact quotas limiting American movies and TV_programs , but Hollywood welcomes provisions in GATT that it believes will help battle piracy . * Telecommunications_equipment : Boom times are expected for high-quality , U.S-made telephones , switches , fiber-optic cable and other equipment , as foreign countries remove tariffs and other barriers . * Computers and computer_accessories : Already the world leader in computer innovation , the United States will boost sales of everything from hard_drives to software as local tariff barriers fall_in more_than 100 nations . U.S. strength is in the high end of the market , which encompasses more sophisticated machines and programs . Silicon_Valley will share_in the prosperity . * Intellectual property protection : For the first time , GATT members are pledged to take action against pirates of videos , movies , software and computer_games . U.S. industries welcome the effort but are unsure if the campaign will be successful . * Construction equipment : U.S. makers of tractors , dump_trucks , excavators , bulldozers and other big-ticket items will carve out significant markets in developing countries , where high tariffs sometimes blocked access .
