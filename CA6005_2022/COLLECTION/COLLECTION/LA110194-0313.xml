   <HEADLINE> EUROPE : FIVE YEARS LATER ; THE BERLIN WALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> WALL FACTS The Wall began as a barrier between the east and west_sides of Berlin , but it was later extended_to surround West_Berlin , sealing it off entirely from East_Germany . * The concrete structure that faced the West was made_up of three-ton panels on average 11 1 / 2 feet tall , 3 1 / 2 feet wide and 8 to 10 inches thick . * In some places , the barrier had up_to nine elements , including guard towers and a vehicle barrer trench . * 45 # 000 panels were used . Each cost 856 marks to manufacture , or $ 572 at the current exchange_rate . * The panels were originally intended for use as building_blocks for corn silos . * &quot; Wall-peckers &quot; was the nickname given by Berliners to the entrepreneurs who chiseled out and sold chunks of the Wall as souvenirs . * East_Germany sold 70 of the most interesting panels at auction in Monaco with plans to apply the proceeds to improving health_care and restoring historic buildings . * Average price at auction : 30 # 000 marks , or about $ 20 # 000 . * Many of the 230 panels not sold at the auction have left Berlin as gifts , from the East_German government or through private sales . * Much of the rest of the Wall has either been ground up for paving material or sent_back out into the eastern German countryside to be used in construction of corn silos . WHERE THE WALL IS NOW Panels from the Berlin Wall are now at sites scattered all_over the world , including : * The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley , Calif . * The Freedom Forum World Center in Arlington , Va. , a human_rights and press freedom center , which has 10 panels and the Checkpoint Charlie guardhouse . * The John F . Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston . * CIA headquarters in Langley , Va . * The collection of Danish artist Jens Galsciot Christophersen , who has two panels in Denmark and others on reserve in Berlin . * The border between North and South_Korea . * La Gibauderie , the Paris home of cognac heiress and former Yugoslav actress Ljiljana Hennessy . * The Hotel Metropole Palace in Monte Carlo . This panel was a gift of the East_German government . * The Vatican , the gift of clergymen from the former East_Germany . * The collection of Jaguba Rizzoli in Cap Ferrat . * Rhein-Main Air_Base in Frankfurt , Germany . * The German town of Dingelstedt , which has made the panel into a sundial . * The collection of Thomas Steffen , a master baker in the southern German town of Waldshut-Tiengen . Source : Hagen Koch , Berlin Wall Archive The Berlin Wall &quot; Outermost barrier element &quot; : The literal translation of the official East_German term for the wall . 101 miles . Vehicle barrier Control Strip Intra-Wall road : For East_German army vehicles . Light row Guard tower , command_post : 190 of them at intervals . Antitank barrier Border-indicator fence Back wall : The faced East Berlin . 42 miles . One Who Was There It came suddenly . The Central Committee of the East_German Communist_Party announced at 7 p.m. that it had decided to relax travel restrictions . Then the state radio indicated that checkpoints along the infamous Berlin Wall would be opened . The flood began . Thousands of East_Germans headed , without exit visas , for West_Berlin . It was one of those scenes fixed forever in the memories of correspondents like myself and all_the others who were there in Berlin on that flood-lit night of Thursday , Nov . 9 , 1989 . It was the most dramatic_event in Europe since the end of World_War_II . East_German border guards , instead of shooting , stood_by as Berliners passed_through the hated and impregnable Wall that had divided their city . Hundreds of jubilant Germans from the East climbed atop the graffiti-scrawled section in front of the massive columns of the Brandenburg Gate to hail the unity of Berlin and all it portended . In the long , exuberant pre-dawn hours , everyone around me was_full of excitement and filled with relief that it had happened without violence . Berlin that night became a capital of hope .</TEXT>
