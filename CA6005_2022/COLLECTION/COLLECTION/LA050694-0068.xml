   <TEXT> The simple , civilized handkerchief doesn ' t belong in the world of writer-actor Joe Lucas ' solo performance work , &quot; Once a Man , Twice a Boy. &quot; Simple civility had no place in the dank , dreary and bloodstained Pennsylvania coal mine communities where generations of Lucas ' family were born and grew_up and married and labored and died . Yet it was a handkerchief that started the play_on its course to tonight ' s opening at Theatre West . Lucas was studying 10 years ago with legendary acting teacher Nina Foch , who ran her students through an exercise requiring them to speak their feelings about a chosen object . Lucas happened to choose his grandfather ' s handkerchief . &quot; As I held it , looked_at it , &quot; Lucas says , sitting on the edge of the Theatre West stage , &quot; it brought_back a specter of the mines , my grandfather ' s slow , painful death -- the way miners usually died , from black_lung_disease -- and the lives people led in that memorable , terrible place . Nina was moved to tears , and , believe me , she ' s a very tough lady. &quot; Seven years passed , though , until Lucas , in his early 30s , wrote his memories down for a Theatre West workshop . Only later did Lucas realize that he was writing a solo play that opened a long-shuttered door on an ugly , brutish chapter of American history . While &quot; Once a Man , Twice a Boy &quot; intertwines Lucas ' account of himself and his father with an intimate telling of miners ' lives , work and struggles , its dramatic centerpiece is the 1875 miners ' strike , led by the Working_Mans ' Benevolent Assn . The organization , co-founded by Lucas ' great-great grandfather , Thomas O ' Neill , was the incipient union that later became the United Mine Workers . O ' Neill ' s men posed the first real challenge to the mining_companies ' iron grip on workers and families , triggering the companies to hire Pinkerton ' s National Detective Agency . &quot; The Pinkertons , &quot; as they were known , Lucas says , concocted an imaginary cabal , supposedly led by O ' Neill and others called the Molly Maguires . O ' Neill and 19 others were tried , convicted and hanged for the murder of mining officials . &quot; It was one of the largest mass executions in U.S. legal history , &quot; says Lucas . &quot; The Pinkertons mistook old rituals the miners knew from the_Irish fraternal group , the Ancient Order of the Hibernians , like handshakes and so on , and falsely attached them to a group conspiracy . It brought_back all_the old dislikes of the_Irish -- the whole region was rife_with ethnic conflicts -- and destroyed the strike ' s coalition. &quot; Pennsylvanian historian Joe Wayne informed Lucas that he is the first descendant of the hanged strikers to tell this history , which Lucas says has been distorted in such previous tellings as Martin Ritt ' s 1970 film &quot; The Molly Maguires. &quot; The final work , resulting from many months ' collaboration between Lucas and director Mark Travis , is &quot; the expression of guilt and pain . Guilt , which is mine , because I describe how I left my family and hometown of Pottsville ( Pa. ) behind for UCLA , an education and a better life -- all while they suffered back home. &quot; The pain is even more complex . Until the Franklin D . Roosevelt Administration made_it illegal , mining_companies kept workers in permanent debt under a system in which the companies owned goods , services and property and issued a weekly &quot; bobtail check &quot; to each worker that tallied the money owed the company after expenses were deducted from wages . The result : Miners ' children were born into debt . &quot; If you tried to leave town , &quot; Lucas says , &quot; company guards could shoot you on sight because you were considered a thief , running_out on what you owed. &quot; &quot; When Joe told me this story , &quot; says Travis , &quot; he was amazingly matter-of-fact about it , as if this were typical practice in any American town . He had so internalized it , because it had been such a fixed reality of those peoples ' lives , that he didn ' t view it as something extraordinary . I mean , is there anything else like it in American history ? &quot; At the same time , Travis says he has drawn_out of Lucas other kinds of &quot; assumptions , amazing details that needed explaining but that fill_out the story. &quot; Unlike his usual practice , which is to develop an autobiographical script with a performer , Travis began working with Lucas after a_few rewrites . &quot; The first time I heard it , &quot; Travis says , &quot; it was a history lecture , but Joe the person was lost in it . I encouraged him to bring himself out more , which nicely worked with my core interest in the performer ' s personal journey and making that live_on stage . &quot; But this piece contains something I ' ve never seen before , which is Joe ' s blending of his father , his growing_up and the history of the mining region , turning history into a personal story. &quot; It may have begun with a handkerchief , but it ends with the title , a miners ' adage with a typically grim meaning . &quot; As a boy miner , &quot; Lucas says , &quot; you ' d be assigned to pick_out or ' size ' coal . Then , as a man , you ' d be sent_down into the mine shafts . After they ' d worn you out_in the mines , you ' d be sent_back up_to ' size ' coal again , an old_man working with the boys . So ' once a man , twice a boy. ' &quot; Lucas says it with a slight shudder , knowing how close he came_to never leaving that life for UCLA and an acting career that includes everything from a four-year stint playing a gang member on &quot; Days of Our Lives , &quot; to Brian Friel ' s drama , &quot; Freedom of the City. &quot; &quot; I know people my own age who ' ve never left , &quot; he says without a hint of judgment . &quot; Maybe , as bad as that place still is , they feel that the outside world is even worse. &quot; WHERE AND WHEN What : &quot; Once a Man , Twice a Boy. &quot; Location : Theatre West , 3333 Cahuenga Blvd . West , Universal City . Hours : 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays ; 2 p.m. Sundays . Ends June 12 . Price : $ 15 . Call : ( 213 ) 851-7977 .</TEXT>
