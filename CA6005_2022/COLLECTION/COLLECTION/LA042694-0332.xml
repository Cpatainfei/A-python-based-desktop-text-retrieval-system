   <HEADLINE> THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA ; A GUIDE TO THE GUIDE ; PUTTING THIS GUIDE TOGETHER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> THIS SEVENTH EDITION of The Times 100 , our annual inquiry into the performance of companies headquartered in California , was produced by the Los Angeles Times business staff using data collected and analyzed by Star Services , a San Francisco business research company . Star gathered information on 790 California-based companies whose stock is publicly traded , relying_on databases , corporate and government reports , a mail survey and phone_calls to companies . Certain historical and other data was obtained from a variety of databases , corporate and government reports , a mail and fax survey and telephone_calls to companies . The tables generated by Star were closely reviewed by Times editors and reporters . Criteria for the rankings were jointly developed by The Times and Star . Annual figures for this section may_not match the latest fiscal_year numbers reported by companies . If a company ' s fiscal_year did not end in November or December , 1993 , or January , 1994 , then the latest 12-month period ending in one of those months was used to calculate an annual figure . For year-to-year comparisons , the 1993 figures are compared to the corresponding four quarters ending in November or December , 1992 , or January , 1993 . Page 39 of this section lists those companies whose fiscal_year does not coincide with the calendar_year ; it also lists the 12-month period on which data is based . Financial data from prior years has not been restated for acquisitions or discontinued operations . This allows readers to see actual historical growth for the company , whether from internal growth or acquisitions . A few companies have majority-owned subsidiaries that are traded as separate entities . The financial results for these subsidiaries are presented independently as well as on a consolidated basis in the accounts of the parent companies . This applies , for example , to ICN Pharmaceuticals ( parent ) and SPI Pharmaceuticals . General Criteria All companies must be publicly traded on one of the major exchanges -- the New York Stock_Exchange , the American_Stock_Exchange or Nasdaq -- and be headquartered in California . Income is defined as after-tax income from continuing operations and excludes extraordinary items , as well as gains or losses from discontinued operations . Sales exclude excise_taxes , extraordinary income , revenue from discontinued operations and other income such_as interest . For banks and savings and loan associations , revenue equals the sum of interest and non-interest income . For insurance_firms , revenue equals the sum of earned premiums , realized gains or losses from investments and net investment income . For all charts except the stock_market performance charts , companies must have had at least $ 50 million in 1993 sales . Section Notes The Bottom_Line : Return on equity measures the profit a company earns for every dollar common stockholders have invested in the firm . Return on equity is defined as income available to common shareholders divided by the average common shareholder ' s equity . Income available to common shareholders is calculated by subtracting preferred dividends ( if any ) from income from continuing operations . The Times 100 table ranks companies by the average return on common equity for the last two years . For The Times 100 table , companies must have met these criteria : publicly traded since December , 1992 ; sales in 1993 greater than $ 50 million ; profit from continuing operations in 1993 and 1992 , and no negative common equity for either of the last two fiscal_years . Companies in the Top 25 and Bottom 25 in Absolute Profits must have been publicly traded_in 1992 . Just as the Top 25 in Absolute Profits ranks companies by dollar amount of profits from continuing operations , the Bottom 25 ranks companies by dollar amount of loss . The Top 25 Banks and S &amp; Ls table shows return on assets , which measures the percentage profit for every dollar in assets . Companies must have been publicly traded_in 1992 with total assets exceeding $ 200 million . Return on assets in The Times ' list may differ from what is disclosed by the institutions themselves because Star divides income by the average of assets for the same reporting period . The figure thus reflects profit earned on a constantly growing asset base . The Top 25 in Profit_Margins measures the percentage profit for every dollar in sales . Companies must have been publicly traded_in 1993 with total sales exceeding $ 50 million . The Born Again table shows companies that have had the greatest turnaround from a loss in 1992 to a profit in 1993 . The Nose_Dives table shows companies that have suffered the greatest decrease in earnings from a profit in 1992 to a loss in 1993 . Real_estate investment_trusts and limited partnerships were not eligible for inclusion in this section because income for these companies , which is not taxed at the company level , is not comparable_to after-tax income for corporations . The Giants : The Sales 100 ranks companies by net revenue . For banks and savings and loan associations , revenue equals the sum of interest and non-interest income . The Biggest Service companies table ranks service_firms by net revenue . Service companies include entertainment , leisure , media , retail , utility , transportation , wholesale , business and personal service , investment , real_estate and insurance_companies . View From the Street : A company ' s stock must be available for trading on the New York or American_stock_exchanges , Nasdaq or among the major listings , and must have been available for trading before Dec . 31 , 1993 , to make the Market_Value 100 and the Lowest Priced , Highest Priced , Favorites and Forlorn tables . Market_value is the company ' s stock price times the number of shares outstanding and generally reflects the esteem in which investors hold a company ' s stock and the confidence they have in its future success . Book_value is total stockholders ' equity ( assets minus liabilities ) . Companies on the Favorites and Forlorn tables must have had 1993 sales of at least $ 10 million . For the Charging Ahead and Falling Behind tables , a company ' s stock price on April 8 , 1994 , must have exceeded $ 2 . Stock prices as of March 31 , 1993 , have been adjusted to reflect stock_splits and stock_dividends . For the Lowest-Priced and Highest-Priced lists , a firm ' s market_value on March 31 , 1994 , must have exceeded $ 100 million . The Divvying It Up list of dividend yields ranks companies on the ratio of their current indicated annual dividend to their stock price as of April 8 , 1994 . In most cases , this figure is the latest quarterly dividend multiplied by four . There is no guarantee that the same amount of cash dividend will be declared for subsequent quarters this fiscal_year or that a dividend will be declared every quarter . The list excludes real_estate investment_trusts and master limited partnerships because their dividends often include a return of capital . The table of Top Performing Initial Public Offerings ranks companies that had their initial public common_stock offering in 1993 by the stock price appreciation between the initial_offering date and April 8 , 1994 . Certain data was provided by Spotlight Development of San Francisco . The Great Expectations list ranks companies based on investment analysts ' published earnings estimates , as compiled by Star Services . A minimum of 15 analyst estimates are required for each company listed . The estimates are as of March 31 , 1994 . The estimated earnings-per-share increase and percentage increase are an average of all analyst forecasts for that company . Rising Fortunes : For the Growth 100 , sales growth can come either by generating new business or acquiring other firms . A company must have been publicly traded since 1992 , with 1992 sales exceeding $ 30 million . Companies eligible for the Fastest Profit Growth table must have been publicly traded and shown a profit from continuing operations for the last two years . Income in 1992 from continuing operations must have been at least $ 10 million . Net_income figures for all companies have been adjusted to exclude changes in accounting rules issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board involving the setting_aside of reserves when federal taxes rise . The Human Factor : California-based companies are ranked by the number of full- and part-time employees worldwide at year-end , excluding consultants and contractors . Employment figures are estimates provided by the company . If year-end results were not available , employee estimates are from the latest completed quarter . The table excludes companies that are large employers in the state but are headquartered elsewhere . The Most Productive Employees list ranks only the top companies in each sector by revenue per employee ( worldwide ) , but the group average is computed from figures on all_the companies in the industry that were surveyed . Hiring trends were obtained from the companies , which used the following guideline when responding to the question : &quot; What is your company ' s hiring outlook for the upcoming 12 months ? &quot; : Increasing ( up more_than 5 % ) , neutral ( as much as 5 % up or down ) , reducing ( down more_than 5 % ) The Regions : Same criteria used for the main tables . Abbreviations : Stock_exchange symbols are as follows : NY / New York Stock_Exchange , AS / American_Stock_Exchange and NMS / National Assn . Securities Dealers ' National Market System . The company stock_symbol refers to its stock_ticker symbol and is not necessarily the way the company is listed in_stock tables in this newspaper .</TEXT>
