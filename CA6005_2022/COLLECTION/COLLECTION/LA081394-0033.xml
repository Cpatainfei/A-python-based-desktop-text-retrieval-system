   <HEADLINE> RWANDAN CHURCHES WERE TAINTED BY TRIBAL POLITICS , OFFICIAL SAYS ; STRIFE : CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT LEADERS WERE ENTANGLED WITH HUTU REGIME , SAYS ECUMENICAL LEADER AFTER FACT-FINDING TRIP . IN MANY PLACES , NO FORMAL STRUCTURES ARE LEFT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Catholic and Protestant leaders in Rwanda betrayed their beliefs by aligning themselves far too closely with the former Hutu-dominated regime and its tribal politics , a high-ranking official of the World_Council of Churches said in Geneva . &quot; In every conversation we had , with the government and church people alike , the point was brought_home to us that the church itself stands tainted , not by passive indifference , but by errors of commission as well , &quot; said Samuel Isaac , a deputy director to the ecumenical organization . He had just returned from a fact-finding mission to the Rwandan capital of Kigali . &quot; From what we have seen and heard , ( this claim ) was valid for all churches in Rwanda , Catholic and Protestant alike , &quot; said Isaac , who had visited Kigali and refugee camps outside Rwanda ' s borders in early August with officials of the Lutheran World Federation and the All Africa Council of Churches . More_than 500 # 000 Rwandans have died in the carnage that has pitted members of the Hutu and Tutsi tribes against one another in recent months . Isaac said that just as the entire nation must be reborn , so must religious institutions . There are virtually no official church structures left in Kigali , Isaac said . Church leaders have either been killed or are living as refugees outside the country . At a news_conference Thursday in Geneva , Isaac said that in one incident , a Roman_Catholic Hutu priest allegedly shot 10 of his Tutsi parishioners who sought refuge in the church from massacres by the former government militia . Religious_leaders in Rwanda &quot; had made a mistake in being too aligned to the previous regime , &quot; Isaac told Ecumenical Press Service , the communications arm of the World_Council of Churches . &quot; There is a general feeling which regretted that the church , which should have been promoting reconciliation , was unwittingly aligned with a regime that had built itself up over tribal lines , &quot; he said . Hugh McCullum , spokesman for the All Africa Council of Churches and a member of the delegation , said Thursday in a telephone_interview from Nairobi , Kenya , that the story of the priest ' s alleged involvement has become widespread throughout church circles in Africa , but cannot be independently confirmed . McCullum said he met the priest , who lived and worked in Kigali and was known as Father Wenceslas , on a previous visit to Rwanda and that the priest carried a gun . A Tutsi refugee who had attended the priest ' s church and later fled to Nairobi told McCullum that she had been in the church when the killings took_place . But it was not clear from her comments how many people died or whether the priest committed the murders , McCullum said . Willis Logan , director of the Africa Office of the New York- based National Council of Churches , said that given the horrific nature of the Rwandan conflict , any story about who committed specific acts of violence must be verified carefully . &quot; On the surface , it doesn ' t sound credible , &quot; he said about the priest ' s alleged involvement . Ezekiel Pajibo , a lay Catholic and policy analyst with the Africa Faith and Justice Network , a Washington-based organization of Catholic missionary organizations , said the report did not surprise him . There have been numerous reports circulating of Hutu priests identifying Tutsi in their congregations , marking them for slaughter by Hutu forces . Pajibo said Isaac ' s comments reflect a prevailing assessment among many observers that the Rwandan church , rooted in Belgian colonialism , has been a compliant institution , first behaving according to colonial dictates and later having too close of a relationship with the former Hutu-led government . &quot; They need to see themselves in a new image , &quot; Pajibo said . &quot; They ' re acting on the wrong side of history . . . which is why they have not played a major role in reconciliation efforts. &quot; William Minter , associate director of information for the Washington Office on Africa , a church-linked group in the nation ' s capital , said he , too , was not surprised at the report of church complicity , given the context of the war in Rwanda . &quot; Everyone was caught_up in it , &quot; said Minter . He described the situation in Rwanda as &quot; very comparable_to what the German churches did_in the Holocaust , &quot; when some church leaders spoke out against atrocities and lost their lives while others turned the other way . Though the general outlines of church activities in Rwanda suggest reason for alarm , said Minter , it is too early for finger-pointing . &quot; My initial take_on it , &quot; he said , &quot; is that I would be careful about blanket condemnations. &quot; In some cases , Minter said , people who did the killing may have been under threat of death themselves if they failed to follow orders . But for generations , Minter said , the question &quot; Did they resist ? &quot; will be asked_over and over again in Rwanda . One important part of the answer , said Minter , will be &quot; under what circumstances did they do_it ? &quot;</TEXT>
