   <HEADLINE> PROSECUTION BARRED IN U.N. OFFICIAL ' S DEATH ; CHILE : MILITARY INTELLIGENCE_AGENTS WILL NOT BE TRIED IN MURDER OF SPANIARD . FAMILY ' S LAWYER PLANS AN APPEAL , BUT COURT IS UNLIKELY TO ACT FURTHER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Supreme Court justice has ruled against the prosecution of military intelligence_agents for the abduction and murder of Carmen Soria , a U.N. official and Spanish citizen killed here in 1976 . The Thursday ruling confirmed an earlier decision by a military_court to close the Soria case , a notorious emblem of unredressed human_rights violations under Chile ' s former dictatorship . Gen . Augusto Pinochet , who headed that military government , turned_over power to an elected civilian government in 1990 but remains commander of the army . Many laws decreed during the dictatorship remain in_force , and hundreds of cases of human_rights violations under the regime have yet to be resolved by the courts . Without naming agents responsible_for Soria ' s death , a military judge ruled_in early December that they were eligible for amnesty under a 1978 decree . Soria ' s family appealed that decision to the civilian Supreme Court . After Madrid called its ambassador in Santiago back to Spain for consultations , the Supreme Court appointed one of its members , Marcos Libedinsky , to investigate the military_court ' s decision . Libedinsky announced Thursday that he had found no legal grounds for reopening the Soria case . Both the family and civilian government officials have argued that the amnesty law does not apply in cases that affect the country ' s relations with foreign governments . EFE , the Spanish news_agency , said that a spokesman for Spain ' s Foreign Ministry expressed &quot; deep disappointment &quot; over Libedinsky ' s decision . Alfonso Insunza , a Chilean lawyer representing Soria ' s family , said he will appeal the decision to the full Supreme Court . Insunza said the amnesty is unconstitutional in this case because Chile has ratified an international treaty that requires it to prosecute cases of homicide against international officials . The conservative Supreme Court has rarely ruled against military_officers in human_rights cases . It was the Supreme Court that transferred the Soria case from civilian to military jurisdiction in November . &quot; Libedinsky virtually brings an end to a case that caused recent diplomatic tension with the Spanish government , &quot; said a front-page report Friday in the Santiago newspaper El Mercurio . Libedinsky ' s decision , published Friday , cites evidence that Soria was detained by a group of military_men working for the Directorate of National Intelligence , the political police agency formed after Chile ' s 1973 military coup . The agency , known as DINA , has been charged with hunting_down and killing hundreds of leftists . Soria was taken_to the Santiago home of Michael Townley , an American expatriate who worked for DINA . There , &quot; he was subjected_to interrogation , physical force and , finally , was killed , &quot; Libedinsky wrote in his decision . Soria ' s body , with a broken neck , was found later in an irrigation canal . Soria , who fled Francisco Franco ' s regime in Spain , had both Spanish and Chilean citizenship . In 1976 he headed the editorial_department of the Latin_American Demographic Center , part of the Santiago-based U.N. Economic Commission for Latin_America and the Caribbean . Chilean newspapers have reported that DINA was investigating him for helping Communists escape secretly from Chile to avoid persecution by the military regime .</TEXT>
