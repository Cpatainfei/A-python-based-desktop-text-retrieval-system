   <HEADLINE> 2 DIE BY LETHAL INJECTION AS THIRD AWAITS IN ARKANSAS ; PENALTY : INMATES SAY THE TRIPLE EXECUTION IS LIKE TAKING ' HOGS TO THE SLAUGHTER. ' BUT PRISON OFFICIALS SAY IT MAKES IT EASIER ON THEIR STAFF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first two of three killers scheduled to be put_to_death Wednesday night in the nation ' s first triple execution in 32 years received fatal injections after refusing to offer final words . The three men had all argued in a late-hour appeal_to the Supreme Court that they were being reduced to &quot; hogs at the slaughter , &quot; but the last execution was expected to follow the first two within hours . &quot; Nope , &quot; was all Hoyt Clines and Darryl Richley said when asked if they had any last words . Then they were strapped to gurneys , about an hour apart , and the lethal_doses of drugs were injected . Minutes before Clines ' execution , a federal appeals court lifted a stay_of_execution granted for James Holmes . He had been scheduled for execution after Clines , but at the last minute prison officials dropped him to the third spot . Holmes , 37 ; Clines , 37 ; and Richley , 43 , were scheduled to die one by one beginning at 5 p.m. PDT for killing a businessman in front of his family during a 1981 robbery . Clines was pronounced dead at 5:11 p.m. and Richley died at 6:07 p.m. , a state_prison official announced . An appeal for Clines was denied at 4:55 p.m. Two other appeals -- one on behalf of all three men , the other for Richley -- were also denied by the Supreme Court . A three-judge panel of the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals had stayed Holmes ' execution Wednesday so he could have more time to pursue a separate appeal . But that stay was dissolved less than three hours later by an 8-3 decision of the full 8th Circuit . The three-judge panel had said Holmes should be granted additional time to appeal his conviction and death sentence on the basis of a new argument that his trial counsel was ineffective . Before the last-minute change , the order of their executions was to have been determined by their prison serial numbers -- Clines SK886 ; Holmes SK887 ; Richley SK888 . Prison officials didn ' t immediately say why they moved Holmes to the third spot . The prison planned for 45 to 60 minutes between executions -- enough time to carry the body out_in a bag , wipe down the gurney and change the needle before the next man was brought_in . &quot; This scheduled mass execution , by reducing human_beings to hogs at the slaughter , will exponentially increase the level of fear , uncertainty and psychological stress that someone condemned normally experiences in the usual course of death , &quot; the inmates said in their appeal . They also argued that it is unconstitutional for the state to &quot; assess who they think is worthy of another hour or two of life. &quot; The state has said that multiple executions reduce overtime and stress on employees . &quot; Nobody wants to get_up in the morning and go kill somebody , &quot; Correction Department spokesman Alan Ables said earlier this year . But Diann Rust-Tierney , director of the Capital_Punishment Project for the American Civil Liberties Union , said : &quot; To take mass execution as a model of efficiency only underscores how out of step we are with the rest of the world. &quot; The murder victim , Don Lehman , was beaten with a motorcycle chain and shot in the chest and head by four masked men who forced their way into his home , chased him down and held him on a bed . His wife was_on the bedroom floor at the time . The fourth man convicted in the murder had his death sentence commuted to life in prison after a court ruled that hypnosis-induced testimony from the victim ' s daughter may have affected his sentencing . The nation ' s last triple execution was Aug . 8 , 1962 , when three men went_to the gas_chamber in California . Arkansas put two prisoners to death for unrelated crimes on May 11 in the first double execution since the Supreme Court in 1976 allowed capital_punishment to resume . On Feb . 1-2 , 1951 , Virginia sent eight men to the electric_chair . Before that , at least 17 states executed four or more people in one day . In 1862 , federal_officials in Mankato , Minn. , hanged 38 Dakota Indians after the tribe declared war on the United States for failing to honor treaties . Six inmates have been executed in Arkansas , and 246 nationwide , since capital_punishment resumed . &quot; I think what we ' re about to witness in Arkansas is a shocking spectacle , &quot; Rust-Tierney said . &quot; The notion that Arkansas is getting_into this assembly-line mentality doesn ' t fit_in with our societal respect for life. &quot; Ables ' response to the opponents : &quot; If anybody is going_to be criticizing us , it ' s nice to be criticized for being efficient . &quot; The people that are involved in this are very concerned that what they do is proper , ( done ) professionally and with decorum , &quot; he said . &quot; They want this to go well. &quot;</TEXT>
