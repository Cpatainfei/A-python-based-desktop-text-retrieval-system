   <HEADLINE> PROSECUTORS WILL FIGHT NICHOLSON ' S LEGAL MOVE ; COURTS : THE ACTOR PLANS A ' CIVIL COMPROMISE ' OVER CHARGES STEMMING FROM A DISPUTE WITH ANOTHER MOTORIST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prosecutors said Tuesday that they will fight a proposal to be made next week by Jack Nicholson , who wants charges of attacking a Mercedes-Benz effectively dismissed because he settled a civil lawsuit with the driver . An arraignment for the Oscar award-winning actor was delayed for the third time Tuesday so that the victim can appear in court next week and testify about the financial settlement . Nicholson ' s attorney , Charles R . English , for the first time Tuesday publicly acknowledged that he will ask a judge to stall prosecution in a legal move known as a &quot; civil compromise. &quot; English will make the motion , which could effectively dismiss the misdemeanor charges of assault and vandalism , Monday in Van Nuys Municipal Court . California law allows a judge to permanently stay misdemeanor criminal actions if the victim receives compensation as a result of a civil lawsuit . A civil compromise effectively dismisses the charges in a case and prevents authorities from later prosecuting . Skirting the issue of Nicholson ' s fame and focusing_on the &quot; level of violence , &quot; Deputy City Atty . Jeff Harkavy said he opposes a civil compromise . Nicholson allegedly used a three-iron golf_club to smash the hood and windshield of Robert Scott Blank ' s car following a traffic dispute Feb . 8 near the intersection of Moorpark Way and Riverside Drive_in Toluca Lake . English contended in court that Blank , a 38-year-old Hollywood resident who received an undisclosed sum to settle his lawsuit , will testify in favor of a civil compromise . Harkavy said that was not his understanding . Blank must agree to the civil compromise or else violate the terms of the settlement he negotiated with Nicholson , according to the prosecutor . &quot; Mr. Blank is not free to come_in and say he does not want a civil compromise , &quot; Harkavy said , &quot; or else he would be sued by Nicholson. &quot; &quot; There is of course a concern , &quot; Harkavy acknowledged , &quot; that the public may perceive that people like Mr. Nicholson can buy their way_out of trouble , but that is not the reason we are opposing a civil compromise. &quot; The prosecutor said his position comes from the allegation that Nicholson swung the golf_club &quot; toward the victim ' s face &quot; to either injure or intimidate him . Harkavy said Blank received minor injuries when glass from the windshield struck him in the face . English said the windshield was slightly damaged , with the shattered section only two inches in diameter . Nicholson , who recently appeared in the film &quot; A Few Good Men , &quot; won an Academy Award in 1975 for his portrayal of a mental patient in &quot; One Flew Over the Cuckoo ' s Nest. &quot;</TEXT>
