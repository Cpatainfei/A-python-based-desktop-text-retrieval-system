   <HEADLINE> U.S. , 15 OTHER NATIONS ACT TO BOLSTER DOLLAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Plunging aggressively into volatile currency markets , the Clinton_Administration moved Wednesday to prop_up the value of the steadily slipping dollar and head_off a potential threat to the struggling global economic recovery . The Treasury_Department and Federal_Reserve , coordinating their measures with 15 other nations , moved_in concert for the first time since President Clinton took_office to prevent the dollar from weakening further against the Japanese yen and the German mark . In New York , the dollar closed at 1.654 German marks , up from 1.637 marks on Tuesday . The dollar also rose to 101.85 yen , up from 101.05 yen late Tuesday . Since the end of 1993 , the dollar ' s value has slumped from a high of 1.738 marks and 111.6 yen . In the short run , the action could make imports from these two major manufacturing nations less expensive in the United States . And in the longer_run -- if successful -- it could restore stability and predictability to the international currency trading picture . The dollar has been losing value all week , despite a much more limited intervention in currency markets Friday . In recent days it has been flirting_with a historic low against the yen and a six-month low against the mark . The declining dollar placed the Clinton_Administration in a &quot; damned if you do , damned if you don ' t &quot; predicament . If investors expect the dollar to lose value , they hesitate to put their money into the United States . That cuts_down the flow of much-needed foreign capital to U.S. financial_institutions . But a strong dollar brings problems of its own , tending to worsen the nation ' s trade_deficit . That is because it boosts the price of U.S. products bought with foreign currencies overseas . Conversely , it makes imports cheaper in the United States . That might be good news for consumers but it damages the ability of U.S. manufacturers to compete with foreign rivals in price . For now , the Administration has decided that propping_up the dollar ' s value is the lesser evil . Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen , highlighting the significance of the move by taking the unusual step of publicly announcing it , said Wednesday ' s actions &quot; reflect our view that recent movements in exchange markets have gone beyond what is justified by economic fundamentals. &quot; Bentsen sought to make_it clear that the United States was not trying to drive down its trade_deficit by letting the dollar slide . &quot; This Administration sees no advantage in an undervalued currency , &quot; he said . The dollar has been sagging even though U.S. interest_rates have been rising . Higher rates usually make the dollar a more attractive investment for money managers , and growing demand pushes the dollar ' s value up . But for now , investors seem to have discounted the effect of rising U.S. interest_rates , and , with U.S.-Japanese trade talks stalled , analysts said there was little else to promote long-term confidence in the dollar . Most private analysts found Wednesday ' s coordinated intervention in the currency markets significant . &quot; For the first time , &quot; said Marc Hendrix , head of research at the_Swiss Bank Corp . in London , &quot; central_banks have become concerned about the dollar ' s decline and the potential for a mini-crisis . It is significant in terms of restoring some order or stalling the dollar ' s decline. &quot; The intervention was accomplished through a massive sale of other currencies for dollars , a move designed to drive_up the dollar ' s value much as a large purchase of stock can drive_up the value of remaining shares . The specific amount of purchases was not disclosed but it was believed to involve several billion dollars . The step had the desired effect of driving_up the dollar ' s value , if only temporarily . But the dollar began to slip again by the end of the day . Senior Treasury officials said the intervention was meant to counteract what was described as &quot; a negative psychology that had developed on the basis of false perceptions that the United States was trying to drive the dollar down for reasons of competitiveness and leverage. &quot; They said the United States is &quot; not indifferent to where market forces took the value of the dollar. &quot; Republicans in Congress warned that , with an estimated trillion dollars washing through international currency markets every day , foreign governments could not influence currency values for long . Rep . Jim Leach of Iowa , ranking Republican on the House Banking , Finance and Urban Affairs Committee , called the intervention &quot; a risky sideshow -- risky in the sense that taxpayer funds are being used as a hedge_fund ; a sideshow to the extent that any effect is likely to be short term : hours , days , perhaps weeks. &quot; &quot; The only sustaining governmental action that can bolster a currency relates to long-term political and monetary discipline , not to transitory political manipulation , &quot; Leach said . C . Fred Bergsten , a senior Treasury official in the Jimmy_Carter Administration and now director of the Institute for International Economics , said the Clinton_Administration was making &quot; a mistake , based on a fear we might get a large dollar decline that might drive the bond market down further . I see little evidence of that. &quot; * RISING RATES : Lawmakers criticize the Federal_Reserve ' s interest_rate hikes , while a Southland business_deals with the impact . D1</TEXT>
