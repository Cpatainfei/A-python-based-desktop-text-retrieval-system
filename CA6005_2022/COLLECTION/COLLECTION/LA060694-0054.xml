   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / ELLIOTT ALMOND ; IMAGE PROBLEM ISN ' T HELPED BY COURIER ' S BOORISH ATTITUDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Almost anyone who has swung a racket during the_French Open the last two weeks has been asked about the state of their sport . The questions have been legitimate , what with the women ' s game missing Monica Seles and any element of drama . Even Mary Pierce ' s upset at Roland Garros does little to ensure the game ' s resurrection until she proves her mettle . The image of the men ' s game also is suffering , although this Grand_Slam tournament has given us some new faces to talk_about . Which is nice . Because , really , it is becoming tiresome listening to some of the old_hands . In this category , Jim Courier , the avowed new man , ranks No . 1 . No one can criticize his powerful , determined game . His work ethic is unsurpassed . But his boorish behavior off the court only hurts the game that has given him so_much . He claims to have brought a &quot; sunny new disposition &quot; to Paris this year , but mostly he has been his taciturn self . After winning his second French Open two years ago , Courier was asked by a young local radio reporter to speak French for her audience . After all , Courier had thanked the Center Court crowd for their support in French , and prides himself on his language skill . But he was defiant in refusing her simple request . He acts_as if the world is against him , and such an attitude does little to enhance the game that could use some help . He has been telling us that he has changed , and is much happier because of it . &quot; I decided I was tired_of being the angry young_man , &quot; said Courier , a semifinal loser to Sergi Bruguera of Spain . &quot; I ' ve let the mask down and shown the real person . This is the way I am. &quot; But it seems he is struggling with this nice-guy image as caustic_remarks continue to lace his interview sessions . And that ' s too_bad for a game that is trying to sustain interest and develop personalities . * Andrei Medvedev of the Ukraine is a rising star who is proof that for all_of the game ' s flaws , tennis remains a fun and intriguing sport . He wears a mischievous smile that endears him to younger fans . He actually looks as if he enjoys himself during matches . But the 20-year-old must be careful not to follow many of the big-name stars , who seem to have let fame and fortune go_to their heads . &quot; I know all_the guys . Every guy has charisma and personality , and you just don ' t look_at it , &quot; he chided reporters last week . &quot; The people are blaming us for not smiling and for not showing character . But , unfortunately , the sport is not as easy as it looks . Everyone serves more_than 180 kilometers ( about 108 m.p.h. ) an hour . . . just once try to return that serve , you will understand why we are not smiling . &quot; I would like to make jokes . ( But ) you don ' t have to take me as a clown . I am not here to entertain you . If I lose , I will not try to make a tragedy or act like a loser . I would actually try to ( play so ) people would still enjoy the game . For them , it is a show , I understand that . For us , it ' s a job. &quot; * Michael Chang , who has never been able to repeat the magic that helped him win the 1989 French Open at 17 , has , along with top-ranked Pete Sampras , brought a dignity to the game . Chang ' s perspective on tennis ' problems : &quot; It seems like team sports , you take each localized city and they are able to relate to a team . Tennis is so_much an individual sport . Tennis has been brought_up in such a way that it is so_much a gentleman ' s sport that it is very difficult to get_away from traditional ideas and traditional ways of presenting a match. &quot; He suggested that promoters consider some of the changes that have made the NBA an international success . &quot; The way they market it is so_much of an energy type of thing , they are showing the dunks and stuff like that , &quot; Chang said . Chang also noted that although tennis is losing some interest in the United States , it is booming in Asia , where he is a fan favorite . * The quality of tennis_players is as high as ever . A Courier-Sampras match at a Grand_Slam tournament has the potential to be as exciting as Borg-McEnroe . Perhaps tennis simply is going_through a temporary slump , as_many officials claim . Not surprisingly , they have lost their sense_of_responsibility . Where are the ambassadors to replace the Arthur Ashes and Ken Rosewalls ? If Courier thinks a little proclamation that he has changed is the answer , he is more gullible than his adoring public . He and his ilk are going_to have to work as hard off the court as they do on it to change tennis ' image . Perhaps Andre Agassi was right all along : Image is everything . * Courier , who has played in 22 Grand_Slam tournaments , was asked to rate the sites . Wimbledon is No . 1 in his book , the_French Open No . 2 , followed by the Australian Open and the U.S. Open , which he called a distant fourth . &quot; I think I ' d rate Court 1 at Wimbledon over the U.S. Open Center Court , actually , &quot; Courier said * Brooke Shields had a tennis connection long before she started dating Agassi . Frank Shields , her grandfather , qualified for Wimbledon in the 1920s , but was unable to compete because of an injury . He did play in the first round of the U.S. Open but lost . Tennis Notes Boris Becker is scheduled to make a rare Southland appearance in the Los Angeles Open Aug . 1-7 at UCLA . Becker won titles at Indian Wells in 1987 and ' 88 , but has never played in the L.A. Open . Also scheduled to compete are Andre Agassi , who won the tournament in 1988 , and Michael Chang , a finalist in three of the last five years . . . . Three &quot; opportunity &quot; tournaments -- July 6-10 at Rancho San Clemente Tennis &amp; Fitness Club , July 13-17 at the Beverly Hills Tennis_Club and July 20-24 at Rancho Valencia Resort -- will send their winners to a qualifying tournament for the Toshiba Classic , a WTA event Aug . 1-7 at La Costa .
