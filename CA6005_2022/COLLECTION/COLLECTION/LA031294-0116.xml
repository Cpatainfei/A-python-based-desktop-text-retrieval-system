   <HEADLINE> REP . HUNTER ' S SELF-IMPOSED 50 % PAY_CUT TO END AFTER THIS SESSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shortly after he was caught_up in the House bank overdraft scandal in early 1992 , Rep . Duncan Hunter ( R-El Cajon ) announced that he would turn_back half of his congressional paycheck until the unemployment_rate improved in his district by 2 percentage_points . It didn ' t.It got_worse . So having already donated $ 64 # 000 to the U.S. Treasury -- and facing the prospect of nearly $ 130 # 000 by the time his term is up -- Hunter on Friday announced that the self-imposed sacrifice will come_to a halt at the end of this session of Congress . Calling the half-pay diet &quot; a real character-builder , &quot; Hunter said lots of other Americans are &quot; having a tough time all_over the country . This is no big deal. &quot; If he ' s reelected to an eighth term , Hunter says he ' ll &quot; start fresh &quot; and end his personal deficit-reduction program . Hunter had signaled earlier this year that he was thinking_of revising the half-pay regimen but didn ' t confirm until Friday that the new arrangement would return his full salary to the family checkbook . Hunter admitted early in 1992 to 399 overdrafts at the House bank . Afterward , he flew home and toured his district , spreading the cursed checks on a card_table at every stop . Several days later , to the apparent amazement of aides , he announced the half-pay penalty .</TEXT>
