   <HEADLINE> FLAWED BUILDING_CODES ARE CITED IN COLLAPSE ; QUAKE : DEFECTS FOUND AT NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS , WHERE 16 DIED , BUT DEFENDANT ' S EXPERTS SAY IT MET ' 70 STANDARDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For almost a month , they chain-sawed and crow-barred their way into the flattened walls of the Northridge Meadows Apartments , where 16 people died in the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake . In a pathos-filled exercise in urban archeology conducted amid the litter of rotting food , crushed automobiles and scattered memorabilia , dozens of lawyers , engineers and city building specialists picked_apart the rubble , seeking to learn why the three-story complex collapsed . Attorneys representing former tenants and families of the deceased found what they allege to be design flaws and construction defects from the foundation to the roof of the 163-unit complex . Poorly secured stucco , missing shear walls , skimpy nailing , undersized connectors and materials substitutions showed a pattern of shoddy workmanship , they contend . Although conceding the existence of some such defects , experts for the defendants downplayed their significance . They said the 25-year-old building met the standards of its time , and was largely a victim of geography , standing nearly above the epicenter amid a cluster of heavily damaged or destroyed apartment_buildings . &quot; It ' s a simple case , infuriatingly simple , &quot; said Seb Ficcadenti , engineer for Northridge Meadows ' builder , Heller Construction . &quot; A couple hundred yards around the site , five buildings with partial collapse. &quot; Beyond the pretrial posturing , however , the board-by-board dismantling of Northridge Meadows -- conducted under court_order and costing an estimated $ 500 # 000 -- produced some lessons that are widely accepted . Foremost is the inadequacy of building_codes for two- and three-story wooden structures . The inspection showed that even today ' s standards , though tougher than those of 25 years ago , fail to provide the level of safety they should , Los Angeles building officials have concluded . Secondly , the building that killed 16 people was not a lot different from other buildings that survived the Jan . 17 quake , suggesting that there could be a loss of life in future earthquakes . &quot; There was nothing different , &quot; said Nicolino Delli Quadri , chief of the Training &amp; Emergency Management division of the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety . &quot; Typical construction for that time . There ' s nothing at this time that we found atypical. &quot; The common_ground is that the causes of the Northridge Meadows failure include inadequate seismic resistance built into the walls and over-reliance on structural elements that have been shown to provide less strength than was thought in 1970 . Not only are such flaws endemic to buildings of that era , but , in some cases , today ' s code still allows them . Delli Quadri , spokesman for the Department of Building and Safety ' s post-earthquake analysis team , is also a member of the committee examining wood frame construction . He said the group is preparing recommendations for further tightening of the code for new buildings and a program to strengthen older buildings . If adopted , a retrofit program would require the owners of hundreds -- and possibly thousands -- of buildings of the early 1970s and before to remove gypsum_board or similar outdated materials from critical walls and resurface them with stronger materials such_as plywood . &quot; A lot of us in the building_department had a high confidence in wood frame buildings , &quot; Delli Quadri said . Now , they are &quot; looking_back , asking questions about the buildings we approved in the past . How safe are they ? They could be safer. &quot; Although the final analysis of what made most of the first_floor of Northridge Meadows collapse must await extensive calculations based on the data collected over the past month , several of the experts now agree on a rough explanation . They say its design relied_upon a medley of structural elements to work together in the building ' s shear-wall system of seismic resistance : stucco exterior walls , diagonal wood bracing , gypsum_board interior walls , plywood walls and a partial steel frame . But most of those building materials were inherently weaker than the strength ratings they were then given_in the building_code , and , reacting differently to the stresses , the weaker elements failed first , increasing pressure on the stronger ones , several of the experts said . &quot; The code allowed the architect to put_in stucco , drywall , plywood , &quot; Delli Quadri said . &quot; The stucco and drywall gave_up . The rest of the load went_into plywood panels . Overwhelmed , they failed. &quot; As litigation progresses , the questions attorneys raise about Northridge Meadows will most likely focus narrowly on the building standards of 1970 : Did the design satisfy the requirements of the code ? Did the builder follow the design ? Joel Castro , the lead attorney in a tangle of lawsuits filed by several tenants and the families of dead tenants , asserted that the evidence resoundingly answers both questions no . As his experts wrapped_up their inspection late last month , Castro presented their findings as a catalogue of flaws . &quot; You ' re looking_at what we consider some very substantial construction problems , &quot; Castro said . &quot; And then the design -- it ' s just inadequate shear wall to support these loads. &quot; Among the problems Castro alleged : * Design of tuck-under parking . The architect designed the first_floor to be divided between living area and parking , leaving the second and third floors suspended over long open spaces instead of rigid walls . In two sections , cars could be parked two deep , leaving more_than half the first_floor open , without the honeycomb support of the interior walls . Special plywood shear walls were supposed to add strength . They were inadequate , however , and failed . * Use of steel frame_in design . Plans called_for a large steel I-beam to run lengthwise across the parking_areas . One end rested_on a heavy steel column , but the other end of the beam was spliced into a large wood beam . The other end of the wood beam rested_on another steel column . In the earthquake , the wood beam broke_away from the supporting steel column . Smaller pipe columns that supported the beam in the middle either bent or disconnected . Castro contends that the steel frame could have provided horizontal resistance to an earthquake , but wasn ' t designed properly . * Installation of stucco . A thick layer of plaster laid_over wire mesh , stucco provides a rigid exterior skin that resists distortion of a building ' s shape . At Northridge Meadows , large sections of stucco separated from the wooden frame when the staples holding the wire mesh to the framing pulled loose . Investigators found that in many cases , there were no staples along the top and bottom , the critical_points . * Installation of drywall . Gypsum drywall on interior walls helps to hold the building together . Because the chalk-like filling crumbles easily , nails must be driven at close intervals to provide cumulative strength . In hallways , required by code to have double thickness drywall , the lower layer was only tacked in place , rather than nailed thoroughly . No nails were placed along the top and bottom edges . Investigators found that many sheets of drywall were torn_off the walls , leaving nails behind . * Foundation attachments . The building_code required bolts a minimum of every 6 feet to secure the framing to the foundation . In spots , investigators found bolts spaced almost 10 feet apart . In addition , brackets designed to secure walls to the foundation at corners , which were not necessarily required by code , were not used or specified in the design , investigators found . * Framing . In places , only minimal nailing was used to attach floors to walls , allowing the joint to give . The joints could have been strengthened with short 2-by-4s , called horizontal shear blocking , nailed into both parts . In addition , Castro ' s team also identified several deviations from the architect ' s plan , such_as wood planking substituted for plywood , the use of smaller metal hangers , the absence of plywood in some walls , and structural breaks caused by an elevation change in the foundation . In interviews , engineers representing defendants in the lawsuit rebutted Castro ' s assertions one by one , either minimizing the effect of the alleged deficiency or justifying it as an accepted practice of the time . For example , they pointed_out , the code did not require drywall to be nailed on top and bottom . The building_code also allowed the wall-to-floor joint to be secured by nailing only , without the short 2-by-4 block Castro said should have been used . Code revisions since 1970 have increased the maximum seismic forces that engineers must take_into_account and reduced the seismic capacities of stucco , drywall and plywood walls . Diagonal bracing , one of the main lateral stiffening methods in the complex , was judged after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake to be of little seismic value and is no longer allowed_in calculations of seismic resistance . The current code also prohibits the practice of mixing different types of rigid material in a shear wall . Thus , walls at Northridge Meadows that relied_on stucco , diagonal bracing , plywood and steel together to meet seismic requirements would be considered to have significantly less seismic resistance under current code . Further , experts for the defendants said , the code in_force in 1970 made no distinction between plywood or diagonal planks for floor sheathing and did not specify which joist hangers should be used . Bill Grinell , a contractor and architect hired by the attorneys for building owner Shashikant J . Jogani , contended that the floor joists -- as well as the I-beam splice -- separated under the weight of the falling building rather than from the shaking of the earthquake . Some questions about the construction of Northridge Meadows remain because neither its architect , Morris Brown , nor its engineer , David Weiss , have spoken publicly about it . Brown ' s attorney , Jay Sherman , said he had only been retained last week ( 5 / and could not make detailed comments . He said the design complied entirely with the code then in_force . Sherman said the structural engineer , not Brown , was responsible_for the building ' s ability to withstand the earthquake . Weiss has not produced his calculations , and attorneys for both sides said they don ' t expect to obtain them . Neither Weiss nor his attorney returned calls from The Times . Without the original calculations , observers can only speculate how the engineer intended the building would resist seismic forces . But the tuck-under parking , which leaves one side of the building with no lateral strength , has emerged as a concept that all agree posed special problems . Ficcadenti said he believes the engineer came_up with the steel beam system , embedded in a reinforced_concrete footing to make_up for the lack of interior and exterior walls . Thus , one side of the building relied_on steel for its rigidity , and the other on conventional wood and plaster . In the earthquake , the different materials reacted differently under stress , causing the weaker elements to fail first . Ficcadenti said the understanding of the dangers of this phenomenon , called &quot; vertical stiffness differential , &quot; were derived from the experience of the 1971 earthquake . Since then , the code has been changed to require shear walls to be made of only one material . Independent experts have also focused_on tuck-under parking -- prevalent in apartment designs of the 1970s -- as a significant problem . &quot; I guess we all have come_to the same conclusion , &quot; said Helmut Krawinkler , co-director of the John A . Blume Earthquake Engineering Center at Stanford_University . &quot; In all those practices where the first_floor is wide open because of tuck-under parking . . . it is really no surprise that those soft stories collapse . &quot; In other buildings I looked_at , the entire first_floor was carport . People didn ' t get crushed . In Northridge Meadows , part ( was ) parking and part apartments . It was that mixture that caused the casualties. &quot; Although Northridge Meadows may_not have been unique in its failings , the tragedy of its 16 deaths may help the city take steps more swiftly and decisively than after the 1971 quake , when the major alarm was raised over unreinforced masonry buildings . After examining dozens of apartment_buildings damaged or destroyed Jan . 17 , Los Angeles city building officials are preparing recommendations for a major revision of the code covering two- and three-story wood construction . Among the revisions Delli Quadri said the department is considering : * Downgrading the strength rating given to stucco , drywall and plywood walls_in seismic calculations . * Prohibiting the use of staples to secure stucco . * Requiring the manufacturers of connecting and fastening devices to subject them to cyclical testing , which measures performance under repeated stress , rather than the static testing currently done . * Require all framing on first_floors of three-story wood buildings to be made of boards three inches thick instead of the 2-by-4s or 2-by-6s that are currently standard . Often , the nails holding plywood sheathing to the framing merely pulled_out when the studs split , Delli Quadri said . But all_the proposals , he anticipates , will run_into opposition from some builders and apartment owners who don ' t want the added expense and complication . &quot; We ' re going to run_into all kinds of hell to change it , &quot; he said . &quot; They don ' t like to do it. &quot; The Search for Answers Identifying Possible Causes of the Northridge Meadows Collapse Before the Northridge Meadows Apartments could be completely razed , they were partially dismantled floor by floor in an attempt to determine why the building partially collapsed during the Northridge earthquake . All 16 people who died were_on the first_floor . Dozens of people were involved in the gathering of evidence , including city building and safety personnel , structural engineers and attorneys for the building owner , tenants and families of the deceased . Attorneys will use pieces of the structure as evidence . During the controlled demolition that began last month , lawyers for survivors have identified a number of what they believe to be design flaws and construction defects . Attorneys for the owner and builder downplay the importance of such fault , which they contend can be found in all buildings of the time . They said the building met the code in_force in 1970 , when the building was designed , and that the code was deficient . Some of the disputed points are shown . Basic Structural Components These are structural components common to all buildings . Connections : Nails , blocking and joints . Distributing elements : Roof and floor . Foundation Resisting elements : Walls , columns and bracing . The distributing element of a building are those that lie horizontally . They tie the walls together and disperse the static weight of furnishings and occupants . The resisting elements are the vertical components . They support and transfer the load of the distributing elements to the foundation . The foundation supports and ties together the walls and transfers the weight of the building to the ground . The connections tie all_of the above elements together . The Walls The structure shown below is a composite of several areas of the Northridge Meadows complex and is not a depiction of an actual room . Joist Hangers Problem : Steel brackets , used to secure the floor joists to the sill , were smaller than specified in the plan . Effect : Floor joists popped_out of the joist hangers , even though the code allowed smaller brackets . Plank Flooring Problem : The builder substituted diagonal planks for the plywood floor sheathing specified in the plan . Effect : Floors may have been less rigid than the builder intended , although the code treated the two materials the same . Stucco Problem : With the wire mesh attached directly to the paper behind it , there was inadequate bond between the wire and the stucco . Effect : The stucco could break_away from the wire , losing its strength . Interior Wall Bracing Problem : Several interior walls that were subjected_to great side-to-side forces were braced only with gypsum_board , which has less strength than previously believed . Effect : Walls lacked lateral rigidity . Diagonal Wall Bracing Problem : Diagonal bracing used as a primary means of providing lateral rigidity has been shown to provide minimal strength to walls . Plywood would have provided more strength . Effect : Braces broke or separated , allowing wall to deform . Stucco Problem : The wire mesh , which strengthens the stucco , was not stapled to the sill and top plate . Effect : &quot; Waves &quot; may have occurred in the stucco as they would when shaking a rug , causing the stucco to pull_away and crack . Stucco is important to a building ' s seismic resistance . The Foundation Anchor Bolts Problem : Too few anchor bolts were used to secure some walls to the foundation . Effect : A large section of wall was ripped from the foundation . The Floor Wall / Floor Connections Problem : To compensate for a step_in the foundation , a two-by-four was turned_on end to fill the space , but was not nailed to the floor . Effect : The wall was able to shift laterally as shown by the arrow . Truck-Under Parking interior Garage Walls Problem : Interior garage walls that ran parallel to the garage entrance were sheathed in plaster . City building officials are recommending retrofitting of such walls with plywood sheathing . Effect : These walls had very low side-to-side rigidity and in many cases collapsed .
