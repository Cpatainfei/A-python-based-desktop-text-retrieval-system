   <HEADLINE> IN U.S. REVERSAL , MINORITY-BASED SCHOLARSHIPS OK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reversing a controversial George_Bush Administration policy , Education_Secretary Richard W . Riley announced Thursday that colleges and universities can offer scholarships made available only to members of minority groups . The new policy will encourage institutions to offer scholarships based on race or national origin to remedy past discrimination by the institutions or to achieve diversity , officials said . &quot; We want the doors to post-secondary education to remain open for minority students , &quot; Riley said . &quot; This policy helps to achieve that goal in a manner that is consistent with the law. &quot; The policy is based on the Clinton_Administration ' s interpretation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which prohibits recipients of federal funds from discriminating on the basis of race , color or national origin . Aware of the legal complexities involved , however , the policy said that the awards must be &quot; narrowly tailored. &quot; For example , colleges should demonstrate that they have considered other methods of diversifying their campus before turning_to minority scholarships . The latest controversy over race-specific scholarships erupted in late 1990 when the head of the Education_Department ' s civil_rights office advised officials of the Fiesta Bowl -- a post-season college football game -- that it should not earmark scholarship money for African American players on the two teams . The education_department official , Michael Williams , argued that the restriction would violate the civil_rights law by discriminating based on race . The decision catapulted Williams -- a relatively obscure Bush appointee -- into the limelight and made the White_House nervous . Williams , who still stands_by his interpretation of the law , said the issue made such a big splash &quot; because I ' m black , because I ' m Republican and because the White_House got scared. &quot; To avoid further negative publicity , the Bush_Administration decided not to issue further rulings until the Government Accounting Office issued a report on the subject . The report , issued last month , found that scholarships restricted to applicants based on race , sex , religion , disability or national origin amounted to only a small portion of all scholarships -- 5 % in undergraduate schools , 3 % in graduate_schools and 10 % in professional schools . Of those , at least three-fourths were granted on the basis of racial or ethnic background . School officials believe minority-targeted scholarships help them attract students who might otherwise not be interested because of financial limitations or a perception that they would be culturally isolated . &quot; By increasing diversity within their student bodies , schools can promote equal access to educational opportunities and provide a broader and more enriched educational experience , &quot; the report states . Williams challenged the assumption that it will give more minority students access to higher education . &quot; It will not increase the total number of minority kids going_to college , &quot; said Williams , who now works as a civil_rights attorney in Ft . Worth . &quot; What these scholarships do is decide what school they go_to -- they ' re recruiting tools. &quot; The only way to increase the total number of minority students going_to college , he argued , is by offering better elementary and secondary_education so more students are prepared_for college . More important , the new policy &quot; allows_for discrimination , &quot; he argued . &quot; Any time it ' s advantageous to one group of people , by definition , it ' s disadvantageous to another. &quot; In November , a federal judge ruled that a four-year , all-expenses-paid scholarship program at the University of Maryland that is exclusively for black students is constitutional because it is aimed at correcting past discrimination at the school . The Latino student who filed a lawsuit challenging the scholarship requirements has filed an appeal and the case is now under review by the court of appeals . The student ' s attorney said Thursday he is confident that the lower court ' s decision will be overturned , making the new education_department policy obsolete . &quot; It is ultimately the courts that will decide this question , &quot; said Richard A . Samp , chief counsel at the Washington Legal Foundation , a conservative public interest_group . &quot; The department_of_education does not interpret the Constitution , the courts do. &quot; Samp argues that the department is &quot; misinterpreting the law. &quot; &quot; Title VI clearly states that any recipient of federal funds may_not discriminate based on race , &quot; he said . But Robert Atwell , the president of the American Council on Education , called the &quot; reverse discrimination &quot; argument &quot; bogus &quot; and said the department ' s action will increase the opportunities for minority students by encouraging post-secondary institutions to establish special scholarships for minority students .</TEXT>
