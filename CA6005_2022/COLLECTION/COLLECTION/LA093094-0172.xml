   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION : WHICH CREEP SHOWS HAVE A GHOST OF A CHANCE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I was having this drink_in a bar alone , and an alien approached me . -- Woman in &quot; Ghostbusters 2 &quot; * Some of us would go just about anywhere for a good scare . Even to PBS , where Sunday ' s season opener for the once-grand , now-gray &quot; Masterpiece Theatre &quot; stars Oscar-winning Emma Thompson in a ghost story called &quot; The Blue Boy. &quot; Blue boy , shmue boy . Bob ' s Big Boy is scarier . Luckily , there are hair-raising alternatives to this limp PBS offering . When it comes_to TV tales about the supernatural and other seemingly inexplicable phenomena , Fox ' s celestial second-year series , &quot; The X-Files , &quot; is by far television ' s finest . And though resonating comical tabloid headlines , the syndicated series &quot; Sightings &quot; and &quot; The Extraordinary &quot; are also eerier than &quot; The Blue Boy. &quot; Still more tingle potential arrives Oct . 9 with the return of &quot; Encounters : The Hidden Truth , &quot; Fox ' s replacement for the just-shelved &quot; Fortune Hunter. &quot; Even &quot; The UFO Cover-Up : Live From Area 51 &quot; -- Larry King ' s Saturday-night special on cable ' s TNT -- promises more suspense than &quot; The Blue Boy. &quot; It couldn ' t promise less . * There was a time when the season ' s first &quot; Masterpiece Theatre &quot; was an awaited event , but that golden_age is long past , mirroring a decline in British productions of the quality that for years had nourished TV ' s most Anglophilic drama series . Those redcoattails are now so short that &quot; Masterpiece Theatre &quot; has little to grab onto . Thompson ' s box-office potential is the only possible rationale for launching things with something as bad as &quot; The Blue Boy. &quot; Inspired by legend , it ' s an inferior , one-hour story that finds Thompson playing a Scottish woman whose stay_at a rural lakeside hotel with her philandering husband ( Adrian Dunbar ) turns ghostly -- but never ghastly enough to supply even a mild fright . It turns_out that the place is haunted by the spirit of a boy who drowned in the lake , the cold depths turning him blue . Despite laboring to veil his BBC production in dark mystique , director / writer Paul Murton falls_short_of even murkiness . Even the highly proficient Thompson can ' t warm this cadaver . When the blue boy does show_up , well , the word silly comes_to_mind , making this the slightest &quot; Masterpiece Theatre &quot; premiere in years . Measured against &quot; The Blue Boy , &quot; Fox ' s consistently intriguing hour , &quot; The X-Files , &quot; is a true masterpiece . There ' s no more challenging series on television and , as a bonus , it ' s also brainy fun . While assigned last season to investigate unsolved cases called X-Files , FBI_agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) encountered all sorts of creepy , crawly things . And even though their separate X-Files operation has now been mysteriously scotched by superiors , paranormal specialist Mulder and physician Scully are still on_the_job this season . Last Friday ' s exquisitely stinky episode had them investigating a sewage-habitating parasite , a half-human / half-monster hybrid that turned_out to be a radiation-bred creature of the Chernobyl disaster . That revelation ended the hour on a note of melancholy not atypical of this interestingly moody series . But while &quot; The X-Files &quot; is straight-faced sober except for an occasional sardonic crack by Mulder , there was something delectably tongue-in-cheek about having the yucky predator at one point hide in the slop of a portable toilet . And something terrifying about the eely thing that slithered from the corpse of one of its victims as Scully performed an autopsy . Tonight , Mulder -- assisted mostly from long range by Scully -- probes a series of killings by phobic individuals who receive subliminal commands from digitalized messages transmitted via screens of all kinds . Although a thickening residue of clues allows Mulder to figure_out what is happening , not all is revealed , and the episode purposely dangles a big loose_end for viewers to ponder . It also expands its running mystery about unseen government forces shaping the fates of Mulder and the X-Files venture . The underplaying Duchovny and Anderson are swell in their roles as attractive opposites who somehow are not romantically attracted to each other . Credit executive producer Chris Carter with knowing that romance could dilute the cerebral inkiness of his series , which to date has been remarkably schmaltz-free . Not so &quot; Sightings , &quot; which suckles on schmaltz while featuring a bunch of Coneheads who have either been in the sun way too long or know a lot more_than the rest of us . To believe the messages delivered by &quot; Sightings , &quot; you have to first believe the messenger . In this regard , &quot; Sightings &quot; is more show_biz than fact biz . It doesn ' t help the show ' s credibility that it has an obvious unsavory side , merging creepy music , real footage and unlabeled re-enactments in ways intended to confuse viewers and promote belief in the paranormal . Yet &quot; Sightings &quot; somehow remains seductive , if only because the exotic claims it chronicles -- from alien abductions to disembodied souls acquiring human form -- cannot be entirely discounted . Even though most seem pretty loopy . * A couple of weeks ago , &quot; Sightings &quot; checked_in on a &quot; frightening entity &quot; that was terrorizing a family somewhere in the Midwest , capturing on videotape its &quot; hours of bizarre ghostly activity. &quot; Look , there on the wall , a dark blotch . Was that the shadow of a frightening entity or what ? It turned_out that the entity was a long-dead girl named Sally , whose presence could be detected by a &quot; swirling frigid aura , &quot; after which , if she really got ticked_off , she would inflict deep scratches on the body of the husband in this household . And look , it was happening right there on the screen . The camera zoomed_in on the guy ' s arm , which bore bloody scratch marks . &quot; Sally , stop it , &quot; demanded the man ' s wife . Then a &quot; Sightings &quot; crew_member said , &quot; It ' s cold in this part of the room. &quot; Things got so scary that a psychic had to be summoned . &quot; I feel her , &quot; he said . &quot; Hi , Sally . What ' s goin ' on ? &quot; It was a definite crisis . So who do ya call ? Showing_up at this haunted house in the following week ' s episode was &quot; Sightings &quot; host Tim White , who not only felt a supernatural coldness but also was horrified by the &quot; mysterious welts &quot; forming on the forehead of one of his crew_members . Weighing in next was &quot; ghost expert &quot; Al Rauber , who suggested that Sally could be a form of energy , even though he wasn ' t ruling her out as a ghost . In any event , White concluded , &quot; This case merits further investigation. &quot; As do so many others , including the two women claiming in the same episode to have been abducted by aliens and taken aboard their spacecraft . To make things worse , one of them reported , when she was returned , her contact_lenses were missing . But enough of them and on to &quot; Angels Rescue Schoolmates from a Madman. &quot; If not angels , then at least &quot; some unseen force was at_work , &quot; White deduced before moving_on to the cattle mutilations linked to &quot; many lights_up in the sky. &quot; As for this Sunday ' s episode , you may want to skip the segment on alien spacecraft ( &quot; Suddenly a series of red-orange objects . . . &quot; ) and even the psychic animal therapist who learned from a dog that its owner ' s husband was sleeping_with the next-door neighbor . But don ' t miss &quot; Alien Abductees Receive a Terrifying Message From Their Captors. &quot; That message , controversial Harvard Prof . John Mack says in the segment , could be that these &quot; little gray &quot; abductors are mad at us and consider Earth &quot; a malignancy at a cosmic level. &quot; Mack , the author of the book &quot; Abductions , &quot; says that &quot; there ' s no reason to believe they ( the alleged abductees ) are not telling the truth. &quot; That level of trust also permeates Saturday ' s campy premiere of &quot; The Extraordinary , &quot; whose highlights include Telly Savalas ' terrifying account ( related in an interview taped shortly before his death ) of years ago encountering a dead man with an effeminate voice . Even more chilling is that , in a re-enactment , the voice sounds like Julia Child .
