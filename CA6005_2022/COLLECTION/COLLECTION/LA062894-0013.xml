   <HEADLINE> A MAN OF INTEGRITY STAYS FOR THE ELECTION ; MEXICO ' S SALINAS WAS RIGHT NOT TO LET CARPIZO QUIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Given the traumas Mexico has faced this election year , the minor political melodrama that played itself out last weekend in Mexico_City might seem insignificant . It wasn ' t . It was a defining moment leading_up to Mexico ' s most historic election_day since 1910 , when a controversial presidential vote set_off a major revolution . The weekend crisis began when the popular government_minister who will oversee Mexico ' s elections , Jorge Carpizo MacGregor , threatened to resign . In a letter to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , Interior Minister Carpizo said a political_party -- which he did not identify -- was making his job so difficult it was hard for him to deal with that party in the impartial manner his position called_for . Salinas refused to accept Carpizo ' s offer to resign . The two men met and on Sunday it was announced that Carpizo would remain . That decision was met by acclaim from all_the major political_parties : Salinas ' powerful Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) and the conservative National Action Party ( PAN ) . For all_the political differences among them , and for all_the personal enmity among some of their leaders , Mexico ' s political factions agree that Carpizo is someone they can trust to run a clean election . Some observers believe that Carpizo ' s threat to resign was a brilliant maneuver to jar political_leaders into a sense of reality and responsibility . The rhetoric and conduct of the campaign had become increasingly corrosive as the Aug . 21 election grew closer . Carpizo , 50 , an attorney , was a respected human_rights advocate when Salinas named him to be his government ' s first human_rights ombudsman . He later was attorney_general and then became head of the Interior Ministry after his predecessor there failed to anticipate the peasant revolt that broke_out in the southern state of Chiapas Jan . 1 . There was powerful symbolism in Carpizo ' s appointment to the Interior Ministry . Besides other things , that ministry oversees Mexico ' s often-criticized election system . Among many electoral improvements , from campaign spending limits to a new high-tech voting_system , Carpizo ' s appointment was the single most visible sign that Salinas really wants political , as well as economic , reform . Salinas put a man with a reputation for outspoken integrity in_charge of the voting . And having an honest election is the single most important challenge facing Mexico , notwithstanding the unresolved Chiapas rebellion and the controversial probe into the assassination of PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio . Those two challenges -- and many_more -- will be waiting for Mexico ' s next president . But the effectiveness with which the new president can deal with all_of Mexico ' s problems will be determined by how openly and honestly he is selected . Salinas knows that as well as anyone . For despite all his remarkable reforms , Salinas ' tenure has been dogged by suspicions that his narrow electoral victory as PRI candidate in 1988 was tainted by voter fraud . Thus it is utterly vital -- whoever wins the August vote , be it PRI standard-bearer Ernesto Zedillo , the PRD ' s Cuauhtemoc Cardenas or the PAN ' s Diego Fernandez de Cevallos -- that the victory be clean . Only a president who is honestly elected can govern with popular support and international respect . Carpizo is the man who will have a great_deal to say about whether Mexico ' s next president gets either .</TEXT>
