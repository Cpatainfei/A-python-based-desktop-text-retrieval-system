   <HEADLINE> ON THE ISSUE : INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY ' S TOPICS ; SHOULD THE U.N. ' S TROOPS STAY IN BOSNIA ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After months of deliberations over the merits of evacuating United Nations forces from Bosnia-Herzegovina , the United States and French defense ministers proposed a series of measures Monday , designed to make troops better able to fight against harassment by Serbian nationalists . An example of such harassment occurred that same day , when a Bangladeshi armored car in Bihac was struck by two anti-tank missiles , killing one soldier and wounding three others . The attack , the most serious strike against U . N . forces yet , was believed to have been launched by Croatian Serbs in northwest Bosnia . The soldier ' s death marked the 133rd fatality since the U . N . began its peacekeeping role in Bosnia . Supporters of an evacuation argue that the vacillating stance taken by the U . N . has contributed to the problem . A lifting of the U . N . arms embargo that has kept the Muslim-led Bosnian government from defending the country from heavily armed Serbs has been suggested as an alternative to the U . N. ' s present role . But , most of the U . N . forces are stationed in Serb-encircled enclaves , which makes them vulnerable to further attacks and hostage-taking if the Serbs fear that withdrawal will lead to the elimination of that embargo . The peacekeepers could also face blockades from nervous civilians opposed to a U . N . pullout . Should U.N. troops remain in Bosnia-Herzegovina ? Ram Roy , professor of political_science , Cal State Northridge &quot; The decision to pull_out was causing a lot of concern . The Muslim countries are now meeting in Morocco and will make a decision that will have an impact on the situation . If the U . N . were to have pulled_out immediately , it would have affected its own image . The impression conveyed would have been that the U . N . is very weak , that an aggressor could frustrate U . N . attempts in a certain situation and it would walk away . The U . S . has been playing it safe for obvious reasons : The situation is not of vital interest to ( the American public ) , and no President can afford to get involved in a civil_war where the outcome is not clear . For these reasons , the situation has worsened. &quot; * Marija Miletic Dail of North Hollywood , an activist in Los Angeles ' Croatian community &quot; The U . N . is not doing a good job there , so they should get_out . As of late , they have proven to be the enemy of the little people and the friend of the aggressor . They are feeding the people there , but letting them get slaughtered . They ' ve tied the Bosnian government ' s hands behind its backs and are letting the Serbs shoot . The few sacks of food they give are not enough to buy the tragedy that ' s happening there . They only need to lift the arms embargo . These people are itching to fight for themselves. &quot; * Ronald Stupak , professor of public administration , USC ' s Washington Public Affairs Center &quot; The U . N . got itself into a bind . They stayed there too long . I don ' t know whose business it is to get involved in someone else ' s civil_war . Of course , when there are genocidal incidents occurring , you get involved . But we don ' t know who is telling the truth . We can ' t intervene in a way where we tell them who the good_guys and bad_guys are . You can ' t moralize about international relations and foreign_policy . You have to look_at the situation ' s interest , the reality of it , the struggle involved , and then you make decisions. &quot; * Douglas Mattern , president , Assn . of World Citizens &quot; The U . N . must_not lose face in Bosnia . All of the member states have the duty to give full support to the effort . The U . S . should play a major role in that support , but only under the auspices of the U . N . The U . N . is the key to building a better world . The only way to abolish the war system is to have international_law , and the U . N . is the best agent for that. &quot;</TEXT>
