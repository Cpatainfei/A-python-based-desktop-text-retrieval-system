   <HEADLINE> THE ONE-MAN ACADIAN LIBERATION FRONT ; WHEN THE BRITISH EXPELLED THE ACADIANS FROM NOVA SCOTIA , THEY DIDN ' T COUNT ON WALTER PERRIN . TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS LATER , THIS CAJUN LAWYER WANTS JUSTICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Frowning mightily , Warren Perrin gazes around his garden . Clearly , something is amiss . &quot; Is it the azaleas ? &quot; asks a visitor . &quot; Do they look a little wilted ? &quot; No , it isn ' t the azaleas . And it isn ' t the rhododendrons . Or the fishpond . Or the sandlot . Then what is it ? &quot; This , &quot; says Perrin , pointing at what should be a lawn . &quot; I don ' t know why , but I can ' t grow grass. &quot; His lawn has been resodded three times now , and a lesser person would have called it quits . Not Perrin . He has every intention of trying again . A successful lawyer in Lafayette , La. , Perrin loves a contest . Though small and hampered by bad vision , he tried_out for and eventually captained a weightlifting squad that placed first in the nation four years in a row when he attended the University of Southwestern Louisiana in the mid-1960s . Then , in 1972 , just months out of law_school , he took_on Texaco . His more experienced colleagues said he couldn ' t win , but the rookie proved them wrong , forcing the oil giant to raise significantly the royalties it pays his parents to operate a natural_gas recycling plant on a portion of their land . More recently , Perrin has thrown down another gauntlet , challenging an institution more formidable than Texaco : the_British government . His complaint this time has nothing to do with royalties , but with an event he calls &quot; one of history ' s great wrongs &quot; -- the peacetime expulsion of his Acadian ancestors from Nova Scotia in 1755 . Some of these exiles -- a precise number has not been determined -- settled in Louisiana where , over time , the name &quot; Acadian &quot; evolved into &quot; Cajun. &quot; Perrin is seeking neither monetary damages nor the restoration of ancestral lands . He doesn ' t want an apology either because , he says , the government didn ' t order the expulsion ; it was an action taken by a rogue officer , a man he calls &quot; one of the Ollie Norths of this world. &quot; What he does want is : ( 1 ) that the_British government admit that the Acadians were done an injustice ; ( 2 ) that it order an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the expulsion ; and ( 3 ) that the expulsion order be officially revoked . Until it is , he says , he and people like him remain exiles and , technically at least , risk arrest when they visit Nova Scotia . He lays such store by these demands that four years ago , he incorporated them into a petition and sent them to Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street . Oh , and there was something else : Perrin advised both Queen Elizabeth_II and then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that unless he heard from them within 30 days , he would file a lawsuit . The next four weeks were long ones . If the_British ignored him , he ' d look ridiculous . &quot; I ' d be seen as a kook or a joke and be printed up in the offbeat column of the newspaper. &quot; And then , just a day before his deadline , the_British Embassy in Washington called . Take no action , he was instructed . Someone will contact you within 24 hours . It was all very cloak-and-dagger -- only missing was a password -- but Perrin was ecstatic . He was contacted a day later by a lawyer retained by the_British consulate general in Houston . And the two have been exchanging letters and phone_calls ever since . He holds_up the file containing their correspondence . It ' s hefty . But beyond this tantalizing glimpse , he declines to describe their exchanges in any detail . &quot; I ' ve got_to keep that quiet , &quot; he says . &quot; We agreed to negotiate in private and in good_faith . Failing that , all bets are off. &quot; But he did divulge this : The British have made &quot; some interesting offers. &quot; Then he ' s confident that his three demands will be met sometime soon ? Perrin invokes his favorite word . &quot; Absolutely , &quot; he says . But the_British are not so sanguine . &quot; I don ' t think the government feels there ' s any particular point in having an official investigation or anything like that , &quot; says Helen Mann , Britain ' s vice consul in Houston . &quot; And I don ' t see how you could possibly describe a contemporary Cajun as living_in exile . To say that a Cajun who travels_to Nova Scotia is breaking the law is a real stretch. &quot; BEFORE I MET PERRIN , I ' D HEARD OF THE TEXACO CASE AND HIS WEIGHTLIFTNG prowess . In the mental_picture I had formed of him , he resembled Falstaff -- loud , impetuous , flamboyant . And big , of course , &quot; a huge hill of flesh. &quot; But he ' s not like that at all . Slight and solemn and self-effacing , he ' s defiantly undramatic . Dressed in gray and as thin as a broomstick , he looks penitential . He offers to take me to Erath , a little town 15 miles from Lafayette , where he has a branch office and runs a small museum . Our route takes us through fields of sugar_cane and soybean . Perrin looks_around appreciatively . &quot; The land here is completely flat , &quot; he says . I am reminded suddenly of John Gay , the_English poet who hated hills because they offended his sense of order . Perrin ' s life has changed dramatically in the last five years . And all because of a question posed by one of his sons . &quot; Why were the Cajuns thrown_out of Nova Scotia ? &quot; the boy wanted to know . &quot; What did we do wrong ? &quot; &quot; And I wasn ' t able to tell him , &quot; says Perrin . &quot; Like most Cajuns at the time , I knew very little about our history. &quot; And so he began to read . And the more he read , the more livid he became . In 1755 , Acadians numbering in the thousands were deported -- some to Europe , some to the West Indies , and some to the_British colonies of Virginia , Massachusetts , Maryland and the Carolinas . The expulsions weren ' t just immoral , he says , they were illegal . Only a governor could order a deportation and , in 1755 , Nova Scotia ' s governor was ill in London . By presuming_to act_on his behalf , Charles Lawrence , then a mere lieutenant_governor , was exceeding his authority . Why expel the Acadians at all ? Two reasons , says Carl Brasseaux , a professor of Cajun history at the University of Southwestern Louisiana . At a time when Britain and France both sought control of North_America , the French-speaking Roman_Catholics were thought to pose a security threat . And then there was the_matter of their lands . &quot; Beginning in 1754 , &quot; says Brasseaux , &quot; Gentlemen ' s Quarterly in London ran a number of articles saying that probably the best farmland on the northeast Atlantic coast was in Nova Scotia , and since it was occupied by Papists , the time had come_to turn it over to Protestants. &quot; The diaspora decimated Nova Scotia ' s 15 # 000 Acadians . &quot; It was genocide ; a holocaust , &quot; says Brasseaux . By shipping the Acadians to places like Virginia and Massachusetts , &quot; the overt intention was to force their absorption by the Anglo population , &quot; he says . But thousands died of exposure , malnutrition and disease . &quot; Initially , the deaths were an offshoot of this ( assimilation ) policy . But over time , the policy_changed . The goal now was not just to destroy the culture , but the people as well. &quot; Brasseaux commends Perrin ' s efforts , but wonders if he isn ' t being too conciliatory . &quot; I would n ' t be surprised if more militant voices emerge , &quot; he says -- a reference_to a small but increasingly vocal group of lawyers in Louisiana and New Brunswick . &quot; It may be that the_British government is blowing a golden opportunity to extricate itself from this situation with minimal damage. &quot; But Perrin has no intention of changing_course . &quot; I get letters probably once a month from somebody saying , you ' re not being aggressive enough ; you need to file a lawsuit ; you need to sue for $ 1 billion . Well , I accept no money from anybody , so it ' s still my petition . I prefer being conciliatory . Back a cat into a corner , and it ' s going_to scratch your eyes out . But pet him , and you ' ve made a friend. &quot; TWO OF PERRIN ' S CLIENTS ARE WAITING when we reach his office : a man struck by a car and another , a long-distance trucker , injured in a collision . I ask the trucker if he missed being able to work . &quot; God , yes , &quot; he says . &quot; Every time I see a rig , my heart aches. &quot; Perrin specializes in personal-injury cases &quot; to help the people I grew_up with . My relatives and the people I know are working people -- people who get hurt offshore , hurt in accidents . I opened this office to represent them. &quot; People drop_by all afternoon , many of them just to chat . Since filing his petition , Perrin has become something of a celebrity . And not just in Louisiana . In New Brunswick , home to most of Canada ' s Acadians , he ' s seen as a hero . &quot; The papers up there interview me all_the time , &quot; he says . His fame has even spread to France where , in April , 1993 , he was invited to address a human-rights conference in Normandy . His law office shares a one-story former bank_building with the museum he founded five years ago . He did so , he says , &quot; to try to excite the kids in the community about their heritage. &quot; A modest collection , most of the exhibits were contributed by townspeople : cooking pots , branding irons , letters , maps , quilts and numerous editions of &quot; Evangeline , &quot; the Longfellow poem inspired by the Acadian exile . There are photographs , too . By far the most startling is one of Perrin standing cheek by jowl with the achy-breaky-heart man , Billy Ray Cyrus . &quot; It was taken at the Grammys a_few years back , &quot; he says . &quot; I went_out there with D.L. Menard. &quot; Menard is known as the Hank Williams of Cajun music , and I mention admiring him a lot . &quot; Heck , he lives just down the road , &quot; he says . &quot; Come on . I ' ll take you to meet him. &quot; Menard , all sprawling nose and jutting ears , is standing on the porch when we reach his run-down bungalow . &quot; Come on in , &quot; he calls . &quot; I ' ve just made a fresh pot of coffee. &quot; Though it ' s mid-afternoon , the kitchen is in semi-darkness , everything painted a chestnut brown . &quot; Have you seen this ? &quot; asks the 61-year-old performer . &quot; It ' s a Hank Williams flask . Wind it up and it plays ' Your Cheatin ' Heart. ' &quot; &quot; Hank would have loved that , &quot; says Menard ' s wife , Louella . Then she returns to lecturing one of her grandchildren : &quot; When I was your age , we got one pair of shoes a year . We had to learn to make them last. &quot; She was 13 when she and her husband married . &quot; How old were you ? &quot; she asks him . &quot; Pushing 20 , &quot; he says , sounding as if she had been his last chance . The talk turns_to lineage -- a Cajun obsession -- and Perrin tells them that his mother is expecting her first great-grandchild later that day . &quot; It ' s good for her , &quot; he says . &quot; My dad died in December . She needs this in her life. &quot; For the first time all day , Perrin looks relaxed , animated , telling us how his dad had served in the Pacific in World_War_II . &quot; Who was your granddaddy ? &quot; Louella wants to know . For some reason , the question delights him . He is among his own kind : the people he grew_up with , the people he most admires . No trace of solemnity now . Warren Perrin is happy . THREE WEEKS LATER , PERRIN drives me to St . Martinville , 15 miles from Lafayette , to see the Evangeline oak . Under this tree , the sundered lovers on whom Longfellow based his poem were supposedly reunited . &quot; I would stress supposedly , &quot; says Perrin , anxious , I think , that he not seem credulous . &quot; It ' s all supposition. &quot; In the poem , Evangeline , exhausted by her years of searching , becomes a nun . One day , treating victims of a pestilence , she recognizes a dying man as her former lover . When he expires , she dies of grief , and the two are buried together , finally united . The oak is a massive thing covered in moss and extending in all directions . Under its branches sit four old_men , their faces as gnarled as the tree that gives them shade . A few feet away flows Bayou Teche , its red-brown waters the color of an aging gumbo . The Evangeline oak is dying -- a situation viewed in St . Martinville with some dismay . Even if its claim to fame is spurious , this tree is a tourist attraction . &quot; Had Longfellow not written Evangeline in 1847 , the expulsion would have become a footnote in history , &quot; says Perrin . &quot; By touching the world ' s heart , he kept our story alive. &quot; He looks tired ; he is just back from a holiday in Mexico in the course of which a car_bomb exploded in front of his hotel . But for all his fatigue , he remains optimistic that Britain in time will yield . &quot; I believe that absolutely . If I didn ' t , I ' d be fishing. &quot; He describes himself as &quot; obnoxiously positive &quot; and says it serves him well . But at times , he reminds one of the young_women in 19th-Century novels who delude themselves that a glance from a man could only mean he intends marriage . When , for example , English historian Robert Lewis came_to Lafayette last April to attend a conference about the expulsion , Perrin decided that he had been sent there by the Foreign Office &quot; to feel us out , to see what kind of people we are. &quot; &quot; that ' s an astounding development , &quot; he says . &quot; His name was never publicly mentioned as being there officially . It was totally low key . ( But ) I know the_British paid his expenses. &quot; But contacted at the University of Birmingham , Lewis says he represented no one at the conference . &quot; I was in no official capacity whatsoever. &quot; And he denies receiving any public money . &quot; The university gave me 180 pounds , and I had a small grant to do research in Washington . I received no money from the government. &quot; Lewis subsequently wrote to Perrin asking that he not tell people he was some kind of government official . Perrin promised that any future reference he might make to the historian would describe him only as an &quot; interested observer. &quot; Driving back to Lafayette , Perrin reaches_into his box of cassettes . &quot; What do you want to hear ? &quot; he says . &quot; Cajun or Wagner ? &quot; To the rhythms of Beau Soleil , he explains the way exploring his history has changed him . &quot; Discovering how the Acadians suffered has helped me to understand the sufferings of others , &quot; he says . &quot; African Americans , for example . I recently hired a young black lawyer . Five years ago , I would n ' t have done that. &quot; He calls his wife on the car phone to tell her he is bringing_home a guest for dinner . &quot; Is there anything I should pick_up ? &quot; &quot; Get a box of yellow-cake mix , &quot; she says . &quot; I ' ll make an apple crumble. &quot; &quot; I owe a lot to my wife , &quot; he says later . &quot; When I get too involved , she kind of shakes me and says , ' Hey , there ' s more to life than this petition. ' If it weren ' t for her , this would be a full-time obsession. &quot; Does he ever fear he ' ll fail ? &quot; Absolutely not , &quot; he says . &quot; I really don ' t . Failure is relative . You can always salvage something. &quot; And if the_British government sticks_to its guns ? What can be salvaged from that ? There is a long pause . &quot; I ' ll pursue this for life if I have to . But if I don ' t get an acknowledgment ? Then at least I will have tried . A life placed at the service of a cause is a good life . It ' s a good way to be remembered. &quot; He falls silent . And then , just for a moment , this &quot; obnoxiously positive &quot; man loses some of his confidence . &quot; I always thought it would take_five years . I think now it ' s going_to take longer . I hate to set timetables , but if there ' s no breakthrough in , say , three months , six months , a year -- then I ' ll go_ahead and file a lawsuit. &quot; If that happens , a court would have to weigh the merits of Perrin ' s claim that the exile was carried_out in violation of English and international_law of the time . But which court ? Perrin ' s complaint involves three sovereign nations -- the United States , Great Britain and Canada . &quot; Jurisdiction is a problem , &quot; he concedes . &quot; No matter where I file , the_British are going_to say I ' m in the wrong court . The case could end_up in the European Court of Human Rights. &quot; By the time Perrin reaches home , his native optimism has again taken_charge . He changes into jeans and a T-shirt . Opening a bottle of Medoc , he glances out at his garden . &quot; That grass , &quot; he says , shaking his head . &quot; First thing tomorrow , I ' ll order sod. &quot;</TEXT>
