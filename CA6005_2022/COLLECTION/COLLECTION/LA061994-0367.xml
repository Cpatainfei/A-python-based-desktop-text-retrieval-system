   <HEADLINE> CALLING A CRIME A CRIME ; FOR BOTH MORAL AND POLITICAL REASONS , WORLD MUST ACT ON U.N. REPORT ON BALKANS ATROCITIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United Nations on June 2 issued its final report on war_crimes in the former Yugoslavia . The report accused Bosnia ' s Serbs of crimes against humanity , especially in the once mainly Muslim , now &quot; ethnically cleansed &quot; town of Prijedor in northwest Herzegovina . Of the slaughter or expulsion of more_than 50 # 000 of Prijedor ' s people , the report said , &quot; It is likely to be confirmed in court under due_process_of_law that these events constitute genocide. &quot; But will there be a trial ? The heavily documented report has been forwarded to the tribunal established in The Hague to try those indicted , but the U.N. Security_Council has not named a top prosecutor , and the report has been all but ignored in the world press . Britain and France reportedly believe that the prosecution of war_criminals must_not be allowed to impede a peace settlement . The United States , which once called Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic a war_criminal in so many words , may now , tacitly , be deferring to its European allies . But the presence of presumptive war_criminals in positions of authority in the breakaway Serb republics adjacent to official Bosnia-Herzegovina is not just a moral issue . It also bears directly on the political question of whether the international community can reasonably recognize those republics and compel affected Muslims and Croats to submit to their rule . Trying to set war_crimes aside as a secondary political issue in the Balkans is like trying to set terrorism aside as a political issue in Northern_Ireland . It is rather less reasonable to expect Muslims and Croats to submit to rule by Karadzic than it would be to expect Ulster Protestants to submit to rule by Irish_Republican_Army leader Gerry Adams . Whatever the salons of diplomacy may decree on a point like this will inevitably be overruled by terrified people on the scene . There is something deep in human nature that wants to look_away from atrocity . Unfortunately , maintaining a discreet silence about the war_crimes report would be not only a moral disgrace but , in the long_run , a political blunder .</TEXT>
