   <HEADLINE> HE INADVERTENTLY EASED OSKAR SCHINDLER ' S PATH TO SAFETY ; DEATH CAMPS : DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER FINDS THAT THE FATE OF A RETIRED PRINTER ' S OWN FAMILY IS LIKELY TO MAKE A LOT OF AMERICANS UNEASY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He ' s a retired printer living_in Arizona who unwittingly ensured Oskar Schindler ' s passage to safety in the uncertain days after the fall of the Third_Reich . He also recently became a key figure in an unsettling documentary about American attitudes toward Jews in the days of Adolf Hitler . Kurt Klein , now 74 , had a quirky encounter with Schindler at the end of World_War_II that probably saved Schindler from confinement in a detention camp . Schindler , the man made legendary by Steven Spielberg ' s film &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; was a German industrialist who saved more_than 1 # 000 Polish Jews from the death camps by bribing officials to let them work in his factory . Documentary filmmaker Martin Ostrow also has told a story about the Holocaust . But his indictment is not of Nazi Germany , but of the U.S._government and , by extension , American society . * It is about Kurt Klein , and , through him , about countless others who were prevented from saving Jews . A few years ago Ostrow began researching a historical film on the Jewish experience in America before and during World_War_II for PBS ' s &quot; American Experience &quot; series . He wondered if Adolf Hitler ' s persecution of Jews was a subject of conversation in this country . He was surprised to find that Americans seemed barely aware of the atrocities that began in the 1930s and culminated in the death camps during World_War_II . &quot; I learned the story was very different than what I thought was the truth , &quot; he said . &quot; I found people didn ' t know very much until after the war. &quot; Ostrow ended_up making a very different film than he ' d planned , one that explored why Americans knew so little about the Holocaust while it was happening . What he found through research and interviews with historians might be unsettling to some Americans . Kurt Klein had firsthand knowledge . Klein left his hometown outside Heidelberg , Germany , in 1937 at age 17 to escape the growing specter of Nazism . Following in the footsteps of his sister , he settled in Buffalo , N.Y. His brother came the next year . Their parents planned to follow later . Soon after arriving in Buffalo , Klein and his siblings tried to get their parents safe passage to America . But he ran_into bureaucratic roadblocks . He corresponded with his parents , who were first in Germany , later in France . They described Kristallnacht , the &quot; night of the broken glass &quot; on Nov . 9 , 1938 , when Nazi storm_troopers and Hitler Youth destroyed Jewish properties . &quot; We never intended they would come immediately , &quot; Klein said from his home_in this Phoenix suburb . &quot; But Kristallnacht changed all that . A tremendous panic set_in . &quot; Everybody then wanted to leave , and by and large , many countries didn ' t want them. &quot; After two years of trying to get_to the United States , Klein ' s parents were deported to France , where they lived under_control of the collaborationist Vichy government . Now his parents needed myriad visas to get_out : French exit , Spanish and Portuguese transits , American entrance . They couldn ' t secure the U.S. entrance visas . There was talk_of quota regulations , additional requirements and other impediments . &quot; We thought ( the U.S. authorities ) were putting_up a tremendous amount of red_tape , &quot; Klein said . &quot; Even when you completed all_the requirements , nothing happened. &quot; Filmmaker Ostrow concluded that U.S._government indifference and actual preventive measures ensured that possibly hundreds of thousands of Jews who might have been saved died at the hands of the Nazis . His investigation led to the documentary , &quot; America and the Holocaust : Deceit and Indifference , &quot; which aired in April . Ostrow says that although most Americans were in the dark about the extent of the atrocities in Europe , that wasn ' t the case with certain people in the government . &quot; The people whose business it was to know , did know , &quot; he says . Although immigration quotas often were cited as the reason for denying entry to Jews , historian David Wyman states in the documentary that the United States never came_close to filling its quota for immigrants from Germany . The documentary cites a memo from Assistant Secretary_of_State Breckenridge Long recommending that U.S. diplomats in Europe &quot; postpone and postpone and postpone &quot; granting visas to Jews . As the 1930s came_to a close , Klein had entered his third frustrating year of trying to bring his parents to safety . &quot; As soon as we complied with all_the requirements , they dreamed_up new ones , &quot; he said . &quot; We had testimonies saying that my parents were not politically active . After producing them we were told we had to get testimonies about the people who gave the testimony to show that they were not politically active either. &quot; Eventually , he even went_to Washington to plead with the State_Department . In January , 1942 , he got a letter from his parents saying they had almost obtained the coveted American visa , but were told to come_back to the consul in another week . The letter was dated Dec . 6 , 1941 . The next day , the Japanese attack on Pearl_Harbor sealed the wartime fate of America and , with it , that of Klein ' s parents . He received his last letter from them in June , 1942 . After the war , Klein found records in Paris that said they had been deported &quot; in the direction of Auschwitz &quot; in August , 1942 . They became two of the 6 million Jewish victims of Nazi death camps . By November , 1942 , Klein was a U.S. soldier . He ended_up a 1st lieutenant in the Army ' s 5th Infantry Division , an interrogator , thanks to his fluency in English and German . On May 6 , 1945 , he first encountered survivors of the Nazi camps . In a Czechoslovak factory were 120 women who had been_on a forced march all winter . Their guards had just abandoned them . At one time they numbered 4 # 000 . Among them was Klein ' s future wife . A few days later Klein came face to face with a second group of refugees , including Oskar Schindler . It was Klein ' s job to determine where Germans and other refugees were to be sent . Schindler , as director of a Nazi labor camp , should have gone_to an American detention center . He even could have been tried as a war profiteer for running a labor camp , although he actually saved the lives of thousands . But Schindler was being smuggled away from danger by some of the Jews whose lives he had saved . They were trying to get him out of Czechoslovakia , away from Germans , Russians and even Americans .</TEXT>
