   <HEADLINE> NUNN WARNS OF RESTRICTING CHINA TRADE ; DIPLOMACY : THE GEORGIA DEMOCRAT TAKES_NOTE OF HUMAN_RIGHTS . BUT HE SAYS BEIJING IS NEEDED TO HELP COUNTER NORTH_KOREAN NUCLEAR THREAT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Trade restrictions against China because of its human_rights record are &quot; too heavy a weapon &quot; when the United States needs China ' s help in stopping the North_Korean nuclear threat , Sen . Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) said Sunday . &quot; We have to understand here the stakes are very high , &quot; the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said on NBC ' s &quot; Meet the Press. &quot; &quot; Let ' s keep the pressure on human_rights , but that is not our top priority . Our top priority has to be in that region of the world to prevent proliferation , to prevent the nuclear arms race. &quot; Nunn said China ' s backing is crucial in the event the United States asks the United Nations to impose economic sanctions on North_Korea for refusing to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities . &quot; I think using total cutoff of MFN ( most-favored nation trading status ) is too heavy a weapon , particularly when we have the other stakes in northeast Asia , as we ' ve just mentioned with North Korea. &quot; The Clinton_Administration says it will not renew MFN status , which gives China the low tariffs enjoyed by most U.S. trading partners , when it comes_up for review in June if Beijing does not make significant progress toward improving its human_rights record . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , after a meeting with the Chinese foreign_minister in Paris last week , acknowledged that China has taken some steps to improve its human_rights record but said more needs to be done . However , the Administration in recent weeks has also indicated that it wants to avoid a trade war with China that could jeopardize billions of dollars in American sales to China and undermine Chinese cooperation in stopping North_Korea from developing nuclear arms . National Economic Council Chairman Robert E . Rubin said last week that while the United States must keep leverage on human_rights , ending the link between human_rights and trade &quot; is a very good objective to shoot for. &quot; Asked about a report that Japan is close to developing its own nuclear bomb , Nunn said that Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa summed_up his country ' s nuclear policy to him in Tokyo 10 days ago . &quot; They will not develop a nuclear_weapon no matter what the North_Koreans do , &quot; Nunn said . &quot; But what we have to realize , though , is that this is what I consider an interim , temporary position and they have the capability and could develop nuclear_weapons very rapidly. &quot; Nunn also said he did not agree with the State_Department ' s expected plan to retain Strobe Talbott as special adviser on Russia and the other former Soviet republics once Talbott , nominated to be the new deputy secretary , is confirmed in his new position . &quot; Strobe Talbott is a good man , but to try to do both those jobs is too_much , &quot; Nunn said . He said the United States should continue providing aid to Russia for specific investment and nuclear dismantlement programs . But , &quot; I think we also have to be a little bit more muted in our economic advice , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m afraid that the things that are going_wrong now in Russia are being blamed too_much by the Russian people on America. &quot;</TEXT>
