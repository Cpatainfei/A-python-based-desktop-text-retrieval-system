   <HEADLINE> AN ORCHID IN A LAND OF THORNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Night had fallen and the power was out again so we got_out the Coleman lantern and huddled around it . Outside , a torrential rain was transforming the dirt side streets into mud swamps . Inside , it was humid and smelled of bug spray . After much discussion , we decided not to visit the trendy club where Albanian nouveaux riches threw greenbacks at Russian girls who stripped on stage . When someone brought_out a novel by Ismail Kadare , talk turned from the salacious to the_sublime . Kadare wasn ' t just famous in his small , impoverished , mountainous country . When I was in Albania last fall , the author , whose prose glimmers with the magic_realism of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and the bleakness of Jean Paul Sartre -- was up for a Nobel Prize in literature . I had even spotted him one night at the National Theater debut of &quot; Waiting for Godot &quot; -- the first time such bleak but appropriate fare had been staged by Albanian actors in their own language . Albania ' s most famous export looked_like a 1960s European intellectual : thick , black horn-rimmed glasses , piercing hawk eyes and wavy gray hair , holding court in the theater lobby as well-wishers paid their respects . When it comes_to their nation ' s literary lion , Albanians remain deeply ambiguous . On one hand , they are proud because he is the only artist they have who commands the world stage . But they also feel betrayed , they will tell you , their hollow faces arching into grimaces , because Kadare abandoned them for a cushy berth in Paris in 1991 , when his presence would have succored them after Communism fell and mobs destroyed factories , looted food warehouses and forced the closure of Tirana University . And how to explain Kadare ' s long friendship with Enver Hoxha , Albania ' s Draconian leader until he died in 1985 , who shielded the writer while most intellectuals were hounded -- often to death . Was Kadare , who came from Hoxha ' s hometown in a country where clans are all-important , the dictator ' s alter_ego , his pinprick of conscience , expressing universal truths that Hoxha knew in his bones but could not countenance from anyone else ? Albania has a long history of backwardness , obscurity , brigandry , gun worship and blood_feuds . Despite small , elite clusters of Western-educated intellectuals prior to World_War_II , the country never experienced the Renaissance , the Reformation , the Enlightenment , the Industrial Age or , until after World_War_II , the age of literacy . In a Communist regime that subverted all art to the politics of socialist realism , Kadare ' s survival was even more enigmatic . He was a hothouse orchid blooming in a land of thorns . I didn ' t bring any of this up that night . Instead , I picked_up his autobiographical novel , &quot; Chronicle in Stone. &quot; Its narrator is an unnamed Albanian boy who recounts with childhood sobriety how the Italians , the Greeks and finally the Nazis conquered his &quot; gray immortal city , &quot; which is also never named in the book , but is understood to be his hometown , Gjirocaster . It was a city where you could &quot; walk down the street , stretch_out your arm and hang your hat on a minaret , &quot; Kadare wrote . &quot; Everything in the city was old and made of stone , from the streets and foundations to the roofs of the sprawling age-old houses covered with grey slates like gigantic scales . It was hard to believe that under this powerful carapace the tender flesh of life survived and reproduced . &quot; It was a steep city , perhaps the steepest in the world , defying the laws of architecture and city_planning . . . . It was surely the only place in the world where if you slipped and fell_in the street , you might well land on the roof of a house -- a peculiarity known most intimately to drunks. &quot; Spurred by these descriptions -- and the knowledge that Albania gets more beautiful as one leaves Tirana -- some friends and I hired a cab to visit Gjirocaster , which had writhed and moaned under the invaders ' boots but survived the war , much like the Albanians themselves : In Central Albania , we traversed steep mountain_passes barren save for scrub and the occasional goat whose dun colors blended into a land deforested by poverty and deliberate environmental manipulation . It was a land and a mood that Kadare also evoked in &quot; General of the Dead Army , &quot; which recounts the travails of an Italian officer who travels Albania to dig_up and ship home the bodies of his fallen comrades during World_War_II . Five hours later , we arrived , in air so pure and cold that it hurt to breathe . Kadare ' s city was severe and beautiful , perched on a mountain like an eagle ' s aerie . It looked unchanged since the Middle_Ages , when a Crusade had passed_through on the way to the Holy_Land . Lyric Lord Byron had also graced these parts , passing_through Tepolina on his way to die ignobly and too early in 1824 at Missolonghi , Greece , fighting for Greek independence . Fifty years later , the stunning cityscapes set against towering mountains remain , but other parts of Gjirocaster looked downright sinister . On the vertical streets , townspeople tugged protectively at our arms and warned : &quot; You must be careful ; there are bad ones among us. &quot; But they vied for the honor of inviting us into their whitewashed stone houses to bring_out the traditional sweets and coffee . Inside the homes , long Turkish cushions still lined the wall much as Kadare had described , where women had sat to drink tea and gossip . Wandering in the waning light , we found the sheltering fig_trees and grape_arbors of Kadare ' s childhood . The stone homes still stood with their heavy doors and solid iron fittings . But the Addis Ababa cafe described by the anonymous boy in &quot; Chronicle in Stone &quot; is long gone . Today , thin men in shabby suit jackets hunker over syrupy coffee and raki -- the ubiquitous and fiery grape brandy -- in grim cafes that exude little of the charm such watering_holes evoke elsewhere in the world . In &quot; Chronicle in Stone , &quot; Kadare describes how Gjirocaster ' s young radicals discussed Karl Jung and idly flipped a globe , dreaming of its wide and unknown expanses . Those youths , whose Western educations contrasted so starkly with their environs , took_to Communism like thirsty plants during World_War_II . But did I detect a note of ambiguity as Kadare described how they ran_off to the mountains to join the partisans ? &quot; Young boys and girls are getting_together in the cellars to sing forbidden songs , &quot; he wrote . &quot; They say they want to destroy the old_world and rebuild a new one . . . . They say that blood will have to be spilled for this new_world to be built. &quot; For the next 40 years blood would gush , as Albania ' s paranoid Stalinist leader sentenced hundreds of thousands to forced labor or internal exile -- often down into the fourth generation . Now even that was over , but Albania still seethed with discontent . Today only Italian TV , alcohol and hopes of immigration provide opium to the masses . On the morning we left , we took a rickety taxi out , down the same path that Kadare ' s narrator fled on foot when the Nazis arrived . &quot; Chronicle in Stone &quot; ends on a slim note of hope , with the residents of Gjirocaster trudging resignedly back to their city . The will to live is strong and people will always return home because they know no other way . Albania was small and defenseless , its people had to be pliant to survive . And they did , through one of the most brutal Communist regimes ever . The epiphany hit then : Kadare was writing_about himself as well as his people . He was a survivor . &quot; The Concert , &quot; translated by Barbara Bray from the_French translation by Jusuf Vrioni is available from Morrow . &quot; Chronicle in Stone &quot; is available through New Amsterdam Press in New York . Also recommended and published by New Amsterdam : &quot; General of the Dead Army. &quot; How are Nobel Prize_winners picked ? See Page 8 .</TEXT>
