   <HEADLINE> A STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND IS HOLLYWOOD PICTURES ' NEW PLAYER ; MOVIES : FORMER PUBLISHING CHIEF MICHAEL LYNTON HAS TAKEN THE REINS OF DISNEY ' S TROUBLED FILM DIVISION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hollywood can be a tough and skeptical town -- particularly if you arrive here without a Rolodex or a road map to the lay of the land . It is peculiar in that even an industry outsider can be both a stranger in a strange land and an instant &quot; player , &quot; just by breaking_into the business in the right job . A month ago , Michael Lynton , 34 , a Harvard-educated , ambitious executive from New York ' s literary community working for Walt Disney Co. ' s book and magazine publishing unit , Hyperion , became president of Disney ' s troubled movie division , Hollywood Pictures . He replaced Ricardo Mestres , who had headed the label since it was begun five years ago . Lynton -- whose background is in corporate finance , publishing and marketing -- is believed to be the first non-movie executive ever to be installed as head of production at a major studio . That high-level job typically goes_to an executive who ' s risen through the ranks and paid some dues . By virtue of how high and where he landed -- Disney being one of the most successful entertainment companies in the world -- Lynton automatically has player clout . Since relocating here from New York and taking_over the post in early July , he has naturally been deluged with calls and scripts from agents eager to get their actor , writer , director and producer clients in business with him . &quot; Agents love a new guy . They can pull_out their old inventory that ' s already been rejected by the last guy and they can easily sell him new ideas and talent -- they get a new lamb they can take_to slaughter , &quot; says one cynical Hollywood filmmaker . United Talent Agency partner Jeremy Zimmer , one of the few agents Lynton met before his move to Hollywood , says , &quot; Politically , he ' s already making all_the right moves. &quot; Translated , that means he is having meals and meetings with all_the right folks . He ' s had the quintessential power dinner at Morton ' s with Jay Moloney , one of CAA ' s most aggressive , high-profile young agents . He ' s played tennis with Jim Wiatt , president of ICM , another prominent agency . He ' s even had dinner with Warren Beatty . On the surface , it all looks well-calculated . But Lynton , who is self-effacing and swears he won ' t be trading_in his dusty Chevy jeep for a new Range Rover , insists , &quot; I ' m not aware these were the right moves. &quot; When asked if he had dined at Morton ' s on a fashionable Monday night , Lynton answered , &quot; Yeah , I think so . Why , is that significant ? &quot; The dinner with Beatty , he claims , &quot; was totally separate from anything -- purely social. &quot; Zimmer suggests that while Lynton ' s naivete may be genuine , one of the subtleties of Hollywood is &quot; how seductive it is. &quot; While your tennis partner or dinner companion may appear to be your friend , &quot; it ' s often just about people selling each other. &quot; Sitting at breakfast at the posh Four Seasons Hotel in West Hollywood , dressed in a gray suit ( he owns no Armani ) and brown oxfords , Lynton seems remarkably calm and cool for someone who just became head of a movie label , recently bought and moved_into a $ 1.4-million house in Los Feliz , and , along with his wife , Jamie Alter , vice_president of Court TV , is about a week away from expecting his first baby . &quot; It ' s been hectic and I know I have a lot of balls in the air , but for the most part it ' s been invigorating , &quot; says Lynton , insisting that so far he ' s neither shell-shocked nor intimidated by the Hollywood crowd . &quot; I may be naive and a bumpkin , but I haven ' t had this much fun in a long time. &quot; Lynton never expected to find himself in Hollywood . He was in Colorado on a ski holiday in March when his close friend David Hoberman , president of motion_pictures at Walt Disney Studios , called and asked if he ' d be interested in the job . The two had become friends after meeting three years ago at a Disney corporate retreat in Aspen . * Within days , Lynton called_back to say he would consider it . He met with Disney Co . Chairman Michael Eisner and Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg , both of whom he had known since his association with Disney began in 1987 . They were no doubt impressed with Lynton ' s track record . He began as manager of business development for the consumer products division and after a year was promoted to director of marketing . In 1989 , he moved_into publishing and helped launch several new book imprints including Hyperion , Hyperion Books for Children , Disney Press and Disney Mouseworks . Also established under his tenure was the monthly magazine Disney Adventures and the upcoming Family PC . Lynton , who received his MBA from Harvard in 1987 , said initially he wondered how transferable his skills would be and how the industry would receive his lack of experience . Disney management expressed confidence in his smarts and promised to give him &quot; adequate time to learn the ropes. &quot; Hoberman says he hired Lynton &quot; because he brings a new discipline and point_of_view to the job . He knows literary material , he knows what a good_story is and he knows what appeals_to him. &quot; He added that Lynton ' s mandate is to &quot; make an eclectic group of films of a certain quality &quot; at Hollywood Pictures , whose lackluster slate of inexpensive comedies over the years included such box-office duds as &quot; Holy Matrimony , &quot; &quot; Aspen Extreme &quot; and &quot; Super Mario Bros. &quot; To his advantage , Lynton inherits the benefits of an experienced production staff and a year ' s worth of movies set_up under Mestres , including Robert Redford ' s highly anticipated &quot; Quiz Show , &quot; the Sarah Jessica Parker-Antonio Banderas drama &quot; Miami &quot; and &quot; My Posse Don ' t Do Homework , &quot; starring Michelle Pfeiffer . Lynton says while there are certain aspects of his former job that are similar to the movie business ( &quot; you have to trust your own taste , stand_by your decisions and be able to spot a good_story &quot; ) , he also says he feels_like &quot; a stranger in a strange land. &quot; Where dealings in the book world , he says , tend to be relatively straightforward , with only one author and one agent , there are &quot; many_more parties involved ( in a movie deal ) and each is willing to negotiate a variety of different arrangements. &quot; Moloney , who has been a friend of Lynton ' s for the past two years , is confident the executive &quot; will find his way through the maze ( of Hollywood ) very quickly . . . . He ' s a very elegant , sophisticated , intelligent guy who already has a good_sense of the protocol and who to go_to to make something happen . He ' s figured_out rather quickly the general politics of the town. &quot; * But that doesn ' t mean he won ' t have to navigate carefully . United Talent Agency President Marty Bauer says , &quot; This town is about ego and power . . . . I don ' t think Hollywood is open_to outsiders normally , because people don ' t like change . It ' s very easy to be a player in Hollywood . . . but the question is , how do you become a successful player ? And that depends_on whether or not you can function with the power in an effective way. &quot; There are some producers who wonder if Lynton ' s taste in movies might be too elitist and highbrow , given his literary background . &quot; He seemed a little fancy , &quot; said a producer who met with him . Lynton says , &quot; My tastes are neither highbrow nor pretentious -- quite the contrary -- they ' re very broad and mainstream. &quot; He said that even at Hyperion , &quot; by far the bulk of our ( book ) list was extremely mainstream and the magazines were mass circulation. &quot; The imprint has published several celebrity and entertainment-related books , from Tim Burton ' s &quot; Nightmare Before Christmas &quot; children ' s book to Robert Evans ' autobiography , &quot; The Kid Stays in the Picture. &quot; * He said that in his new post , the intention &quot; is not to do art-house movies . We are a commercial studio . I recognize that and want to do mainstream , commercial movies of all genres. &quot; A movie fan from childhood , Lynton was born in Holland to upper-middle-class German Jewish immigrants . &quot; I ' ve always loved movies , &quot; says Lynton , recalling his frequent trips as a young boy to his neighborhood theater , the Asta , &quot; which was run_by an old guy named Ben who sat at a card_table in front and knew everyone by name. &quot; The cinema , he said , &quot; had 10 rows of folding_chairs for the kids and 10 to 15 small tables in the back where adults could drink and eat dinner. &quot; Some of his all-time favorite movies are &quot; The Longest Day , &quot; &quot; The Godfather , &quot; &quot; American Graffiti , &quot; &quot; Rocky , &quot; &quot; Saturday Night Fever , &quot; &quot; Chinatown &quot; and &quot; Shampoo. &quot; Of this summer ' s stock , Lynton listed among his favorites &quot; Speed , &quot; &quot; Forrest Gump , &quot; &quot; True Lies &quot; and the_British comedy &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral , &quot; which he regards_as &quot; the perfect movie. &quot; At least initially , Lynton is getting a warm reception from Hollywood . It was hard to find anyone who didn ' t say of him , &quot; he ' s smart , &quot; &quot; he ' s savvy , &quot; &quot; he ' s well-read &quot; and &quot; he seems like a quick study. &quot; One literary_agent even noted , &quot; He ' s very much a politician. &quot; But , in the words of one skeptical industry insider : &quot; The personal politics take a long_time to navigate in those ego-strewn waters. &quot; &quot; He has a lot of homework to do , &quot; insists a producer . &quot; Hollywood is a whole other business . We trade on relationships and knowing people . This is not stoves or widgets. &quot; Ron Mardigian , longtime head of the motion_picture literary department at William Morris Agency , says of Lynton : &quot; He seems very interested in learning about the business and what he could do to make things run more smoothly. &quot; A Disney insider predicts , &quot; He has a year and a half to get his sea legs and another year and a half to prove himself. &quot; And a filmmaker in town suggests , &quot; If he rubs enough butter on the bread of Mike Ovitz , Jim Wiatt and Jeff Berg , he ' ll do just fine . But , at the end of the day , he has to put himself behind some good movies. &quot;</TEXT>
