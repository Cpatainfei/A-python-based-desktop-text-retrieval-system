   <HEADLINE> ASIA ; HONG KONG ' S NEW AIRPORT FINALLY GETS OFF GROUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Anyone who has flown into the airport here knows the gut-wrenching dogleg turn before landing , the plane skimming so close to crowded apartment blocks that passengers can almost see what the families inside are eating for dinner . More_than one plane has overshot the single runway and gone skidding into Hong Kong ' s not-so-fragrant harbor . &quot; It ' s like landing on an aircraft_carrier , &quot; says former astronaut James Van Hoften . Van Hoften , now a vice_president of San Francisco-based Bechtel Corp. , is helping change all that . He is supervising the construction of Hong Kong ' s $ 20-billion airport , which will replace the overburdened Kai Tak , the world ' s third-busiest airport , and some say its scariest . The new airport , Chek Lap Kok , lands a different set of superlatives . It is the world ' s largest civil_engineering project -- with six times the cost of the giant new airport in Denver and built_on a man-made island four miles square . &quot; It ' s not the Great Wall , but you can see it from space , &quot; says Van Hoften , pointing_out the site on satellite photos with the practiced eye of the first civil_engineer to ride in a rocket . In the time it has taken the Denver International Airport to sort_out its baggage-handling system , contractors in Hong Kong have quietly flattened a small mountain , created an island the size of Beverly Hills and started a suspension_bridge longer than the Golden Gate to reach it . And engineers promise that , even with projections of 87 million passengers coming and going , it will not sink , as has happened to the new airport in Osaka , Japan , which was built_on reclaimed land . The target date for completion is June 30 , 1997 -- the final day of Britain ' s sovereignty here . Hong Kong ' s last colonial governor , Chris Patten , could potentially pass the city ' s keys to his Beijing-named successor in Chek Lap Kok ' s VIP lounge . But rather than representing cooperation between Hong Kong ' s past and future rulers , the airport has instead become a symbol of Sino-British confrontation . Britain decided to build Chek Lap Kok in the wake of the 1989 massacre at Tian An Men Square in Beijing as a morale_booster for Hong Kong , a concrete show of Britain ' s optimism that the onetime colony would remain international and autonomous . To China , though , the implication that anyone lacked confidence in their rule was seditious . The airport , Beijing claimed , was an extravagance designed to drain Hong Kong ' s coffers before the territory reverts to China ' s hands . China withheld approval of the financing agreements , which straddled 1997 , and during almost four years of talks , it looked as if the airport project would not fly . &quot; What it is really about is power and fear , &quot; says a source close to the talks . &quot; Sabotaging the project to punish Britain was a true case of cutting_off one ' s nose to spite the face. &quot; In November , after a four-year impasse , Beijing gave Hong Kong ' s new airport the all-clear . While the politicians were haggling , workers from Poland to the Philippines quietly forged ahead with construction funded from Hong Kong ' s reserves , building an airport on faith and sand from the sea . Van Hoften tries to ignore the politics -- he has enough international relations_to worry about on_the_job . On one tunneling project , for example , the contractor was Dutch , the site observers were British and Polish workers started tunneling on one side to meet Thais digging in from the other . &quot; We ' ve combined 10 projects under one team , &quot; says Van Hoften . &quot; It ' s my job to make_sure they all play together. &quot;</TEXT>
