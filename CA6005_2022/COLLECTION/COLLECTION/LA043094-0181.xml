   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A ; WHAT EFFECT THE WEAK DOLLAR HAS_ON AMERICANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dollar ' s recent fall against the Japanese yen could affect everything from what you pay_for goods to what you earn at_work . Here are some answers to questions about the dollar ' s decline . * Q So what does all this mean to me , the U.S. consumer ? * A As the dollar falls , it means you have to bring more money with you when you travel overseas . It also means you might see prices of foreign goods go_up , if manufacturers are worried about falling profits . Already this year , Japanese car prices have risen far more quickly than those of Detroit ' s auto_makers . But there is a benefit from a falling dollar , if you own overseas stocks and bonds . When foreign currencies rise , your overseas investments translate into more dollars . And if you work for a company with foreign operations , the company will generate more profits from abroad , fueling profit-sharing plans and even pay raises for workers at_home . * Q How long has the dollar been falling ? * A The dollar has been in a general decline since early 1985 , when it was at the 260-yen level . At that time , the major industrial nations agreed to lower the value of the dollar to help correct the U.S. trade_deficit , especially with Japan . A weaker dollar makes American goods cheaper and more competitive on world markets , and the move was supposed to help cut the trade_gap . * Q So the dollar is dropping solely because of the trade conflict ? * A Trade is just one factor . The dollar also fell because the U.S. economy weakened more quickly in the late-1980s recession than other countries ' did , and interest_rates here fell more steeply and stayed lower than our trading partners ' rates . More recently , U.S. stocks and bonds have been declining , scaring_off foreign investors . As they liquidate American stocks and bonds , they will also sell_off the proceeds -- dollars -- in_order to buy other currencies to invest in other countries . Big institutional investors , so-called hedge_funds , have been known to be selling the dollar . * Q Is the U.S._government comfortable with how the markets are reacting and the dollar ' s recent fall ? * A Apparently not . On Friday , as the dollar dropped toward that postwar low of 100.40 yen , the Federal_Reserve_Board stepped_in and bought dollars for German marks and Japanese yen . It made its presence known , and the currency market reacted by pushing the battered dollar back_up . * Q Why did the government intervene ? * A Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the United States wants to promote currency stability . Economists say Washington might be fearful that a further fall_in the dollar would scare_off foreign investors and hurt the stock and bond markets even more .</TEXT>
