   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; ATTACK SHOWS NATO HAS BITE TO BACK_UP ITS BARK ; BOSNIA : SERBIAN FORCES MAY RECOIL FROM PUNISHMENT RATHER THAN RISK MORE WESTERN INTERVENTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With its first resort_to force after almost two years of empty threats and toothless directives , NATO has sent a message to Bosnia ' s warring factions that there is military muscle behind alliance warnings and a price to pay_for flouting its edicts . By striking out at Bosnian Serb warplanes blatantly violating a U.N. &quot; no-fly &quot; order , the 16-nation alliance took an easy , unassailable shot at Serb nationalist rebels with clear enforcement authorization from the Security_Council , which even Serb-allied Russia had endorsed . Although the first reaction of the targeted Bosnian Serb forces was to escalate bombardment of the northern city of Tuzla , there were signs that Serbian forces may recoil from the punishment rather than retaliate and risk further Western intervention . Bosnian Serb military and political_leaders responded with contradictory expressions of bluster and restraint , hinting at disarray among the rebel forces that until Monday had encountered no serious Western deterrence to their deadly land grab . For almost two years , Western diplomats and other observers of the conflict in the former Yugoslav federation have argued whether the use of force against Serb nationalist aggression would break rebel resolve to carve a Greater Serbia out of ethnically diverse communities or spark angry retaliation and a wider Balkans war . After Monday ' s action to enforce the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone , the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization and the United Nations may see their peacemaking initiatives heeded with more respect . The U.N. Protection Force in the Balkans has set a March 7 deadline for opening an airport in Tuzla to humanitarian relief flights -- an objective that looked , until Monday , to have little chance of achievement . But Bosnian Serb forces now have to reckon with the possibility of forceful retaliation , if they continue to block relief flights to the airport and pepper the U.N.-controlled runway with artillery_fire . Likewise , a U.N. plan for gradually imposing peace between Croats and Muslims in Central Bosnia appeared to get a boost from the NATO action . Fighting had continued unabated since the United Nations announced last week that it would seek to extend a tense peace imposed on Sarajevo to other areas of the republic . But the guns were reported to have fallen silent after word of NATO ' s first forceful intervention in the nearly 3-year-old Balkans war . Bosnian Serbs last week had scored a major diplomatic coup by evading punitive NATO air strikes , despite flagrant violations of an alliance order to pull heavy artillery out of firing_range of Sarajevo . After a heavy artillery shell killed 68 civilians at a crowded open-air_market on Feb . 5 , NATO ordered all tanks , howitzers and rocket-launchers out of a 12-mile zone around the Bosnian capital . As the Feb . 21 deadline approached , U.N. Protection Force officers and Russian politicians bargained for restraint on NATO ' s part , claiming an end to the siege of Sarajevo had been achieved by the threat of force alone . But hundreds of Serbian weapons remained deployed within the exclusion zone , and increasing instances of mortar_fire and artillery movements in recent days have made clear that NATO had foregone its opportunity to show the rebels it has the confidence and authority to use force . NATO last summer threatened to strike at the Serbs , if they continued their slow strangulation of the Bosnian capital , and an earlier warning of impending air strikes to enforce a U.N.-mediated partitioning of the republic had also gone unfulfilled , leading the rebels to conclude NATO was a paper tiger . The &quot; no-fly &quot; zone proclaimed in October , 1992 , was the most brazenly violated NATO order and , therefore , a wise choice for enforcement by the alliance that needed to restore the notion that credible force stands behind its threats . Russian intervention on behalf of traditional Serbian allies spared the rebels NATO air strikes last week ; the Serbs appeared emboldened enough by that support to step_up attacks on other government targets like the Tuzla airport , the besieged Maglaj region and the volatile Muslim enclave around Bihac . NATO ' s first-ever shots fired in anger also sent a warning to the Kremlin that it will not be allowed to protect Serbian rebels from Western punishment if they continue to violate U.N. resolutions and thwart the international community ' s attempts to restore peace . The Kremlin ' s response to NATO ' s downing of the four fixed-wing Galeb aircraft suggested that it had beat a face-saving retreat to join Western allies in their claims of resolve to halt the Balkan bloodshed . &quot; If the Serbs did this , I see no justification , &quot; Russian Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev said of the reported &quot; no-fly &quot; zone violations . Although Russia has warned that military intervention could worsen the war , there were no immediate protests of the NATO action from Russian authorities in positions of power . The commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia , British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , also reacted with words of support for NATO , despite unmasked opposition to the air strikes that were threatened last week . &quot; It shows NATO has teeth , &quot; Rose said of the NATO plane downings . &quot; It shows that if people are in flagrant violation of agreements , they ' ll suffer the consequences. &quot; Rose ' s reputation has been riding_on the deteriorating cease-fire proclaimed in Sarajevo prior to the NATO deadline for moving heavy guns out of firing_range of the capital . At Rose ' s insistence , NATO withheld enforcement action only to see a steady escalation of hostile fire from remaining Serbian positions . Even Bosnian Serb leaders refrained_from belligerent statements after the NATO action . Nationalist chieftain Radovan Karadzic , en route from Belgrade to Moscow for consultation with Slav Orthodox allies , said NATO reports that Bosnian Serbs had violated the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone were being investigated . &quot; We simply do not know the truth yet . We will know soon what happened , whether it was a Croat or Serb flight or some training or combat flight , &quot; an uncharacteristically contrite Karadzic told reporters at Belgrade airport . His wait-and-see approach contrasted sharply with the flat denial issued by the Bosnian Serb army , which claimed Serbian aircraft had &quot; never breached the ' no-fly ' zone since it came_into force in October , 1992. &quot; U.N. sources say at least 1 # 000 violations have been recorded , most of them by the Bosnian Serbs , who have at least 30 fixed-wing planes and 20 attack helicopters , in contrast with a handful of helicopter gunships held by the Croats and no combat aircraft among the Muslim-led government forces . Times special correspondents Laura Silber in Belgrade , Yugoslavia , and Danica Kirka in Zagreb , Croatia , contributed to this report . The ' No-Fly ' Zone A look_at the area over Bosnia declared off limits : * Background : The United States declared a &quot; no-fly &quot; zone over all_of Bosnia-Herzegovina , aimed primarily at Bosnian Serbs , in October , 1992 . On April 12 , 1993 , NATO planes began Operation Deny Flight , intended to enforce the declaration , the first instance of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization flexing its military muscles beyond the territory of member states . * Execution : Warplanes from aircraft_carriers in the Adriatic_Sea and NATO bases in Italy fly over Bosnia on daily patrols with the help of AWACS surveillance planes operating over Hungary to the north . * Past violations : Though frequent violations of the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone have been reported , most often by helicopters said to be transporting troops or weaponry , there were no known instances of NATO aircraft trying to shoot_down violators before Monday ' s incident . Mountainous terrain often makes spotting and confirming such violations difficult . * Planes : Bosnian Serbs have older-model fixed-wing warplanes and helicopters at Banja Luka , their stronghold in northwest Bosnia . The Muslim-led government and Bosnian Croats are believed to have only a_few helicopters used for transport . Source : Times wire reports</TEXT>
