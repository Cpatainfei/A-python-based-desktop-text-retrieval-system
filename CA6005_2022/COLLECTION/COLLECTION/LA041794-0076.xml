   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : SWITZERLAND ; OLD TOWN , NEW MONEY ; BUSINESS AND PLEASURE MIX IN THE PRISTINE LAKESIDE TOWN OF ZUG -- A LOW-TAX HAVEN FOR FOREIGN FIRMS that ' s NEARLY TOURIST-FREE DESPITE ITS STORYBOOK SETTING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The coffers of Zug were not always brimming with gold . For most of its 700-year history , Zug ( pronounced Zoog ) was a poor little lakeside town 19 miles due_south of Zurich , notable only for its catastrophes . On three occasions , in 1435 , 1594 and 1887 , large tracts of the town built along the curve of shoreline suddenly collapsed and slid into Lake Zug , each time devastating the community ; the first and worst of these fatal events , late one March afternoon after an early thaw , wiped_out a third of the population . But shortly after the end of the Second_World_War , the fortunes of Zug -- capital of a tiny rural canton of the same name -- improved considerably . Tired of being poor and eking out a hardscrabble existence from the land , the citizens devised and voted to adopt a bold fiscal plan , startling in its simplicity . Zug would lure foreign corporations , operating mainly outside of Switzerland , to their canton with the golden carrot of low taxation . Gigantic , multinational corporations ( and small , private firms as well ) would pay their taxes -- a fraction of 1 % of their registered capital -- to Zug ; the citizens would benefit by significantly lowered taxes of_their_own , and the infrastructure of the town and its environs would remain virtually unchanged . Most of the 10 # 000 foreign firms that are today listed in Zug exist in boxes smaller than a case of Dom Perignon . And so Zug , conjuring money out of thin air , prospered . The millions and millions of Swiss_francs that flow in from companies registered with names such_as Gnomes Securities Workshops Ltd. , Savoir Vivre Ltd. , and variations on the theme of Prudential-Bache Securities and Salomon Brothers , have changed the face of the once-shabby town . The glittering nugget at the center of Zug is its handsomely and expensively restored Old Town at the edge of the lake . Period-perfect 15th- and 16th-Century houses , gabled and timbered , line this self-contained village ' s two main_streets , the Unteraltstadt and the Oberaltstadt ( Lower Old Town and Upper Old Town ) , and surround the wide , cobbled passage known as Fischmarkt . One particularly beautiful restoration is the early 16th-Century Rathaus , or Town_Hall . Its Parliament Room features richly carved paneling in the late-Gothic style and a courtroom dominated by a massive 17th-Century ceramic stove , decorated with scenes from Greek_mythology . At the harbor , near a turn-of-the-century aviary of parrots , a handful of lively cafes circles the broad , cobbled plaza . Known as Landsgemeindeplatz , it has been a gathering place since the 15th Century , when male citizens voted by raising their swords . Quaint and pristine , the Old Town is as perfect as a movie set . Even the tall , beveled-in-stone letters identifying the imposing polizei station on the Kolinplatz gleam with fresh gilt . Hovering high above Old Zug , and offering a quick , accessible escape_from life in town , is the Zugerberg , a grassy , bucolic peak . The summit , 15 minutes straight up along the narrow Zugerbergstrasse , can also be reached by the little red funicular_railway that makes frequent ascents throughout the day . Dominating the top of the Zugerberg is an exclusive private_school , the Institut Montana , favored by the sons and daughters of foreign nationals working in the canton . Just a_few yards away , on the other side of the funicular stop , is a simple , seasonal hotel and restaurant , the Hotel Zugerberg . Its terrace offers a panoramic view of Zug and the lake framed by mountains fading into the haze . Spreading_out below the peak , like a lushly textured dirndl skirt , are broad , sloping acres of fertile farmland . Cherry orchards , high pasture and meadows full of wildflowers form a patchwork , laced through_with well-marked walking paths from peak to base . A popular refreshment stop for hikers , and a very pleasant spot for lunch or dinner when the weather is good , is the Blasenberg , a farm-restaurant with red-umbrella-topped tables on a stone patio outside and a rustic dining_room within . Here , in a charming , terrace-roof farmhouse decked with flowers , chef Angelo Limacher prepares such honest country fare as platters of air-dried beef from the Grisons , salad_plates of wurst and cheese in a mayonnaise dressing , wienerschnitzel and his specialty : free-range roast capons , prepared to order with a reservation 24 hours ahead . Dotting the shores of Lake Zug , called the Zuger See locally , are small , pretty villages and hamlets that have become bedroom communities for executives working in Zug . In Cham ( pronounced Hahm with a guttural first h ) , on the west_side of the lake , is the villa where the Nestle Corporation was born . ( The giant food conglomerate began life in the mid-1800s as a condensed-milk factory founded by an American , George Page. ) Cham is also noted for its beautiful shoreline park , often the setting for outdoor festivals and sculpture exhibitions , and for La Villette , a villa-restaurant now owned and operated by the town that takes full advantage of its wonderful lakeside setting . The reasonably priced food won ' t be memorable , but the view across thick green lawns sweeping down to the water , where sailboats glide back and forth in front of an Alpine backdrop , will be . The Zuger See landscape is rich with intriguing dwellings and old inns nestled under the tall firs . In Cham is the majestic St . Andreas castle , built_in the early 14th Century . Further along the lake , in the hamlet of Buonas , is the Schlosshof Buonas , a castle built by the Knights of Buonas in the 11th Century . Also near Buonas is the spacious white_house -- owned by an aristocratic Englishwoman -- where Margaret Thatcher frequently vacations . You may encounter the former prime_minister if you stop in Buonas for a meal at the Gasthaus Wildenmann in the center of the hamlet . This atmospheric old tavern features grilled or roasted meats -- appropriate fare at a restaurant whose sign depicts a wild_man poised to club his dinner into submission . With its storybook Old Town , the pastoral high country of the Zugerberg and the placid prettiness of the deep lake fed by Alpine streams , Zug would seem to be the poster-perfect stuff of a tourist ' s dream . But as it happens , there are virtually no tourists in Zug . More_than 90 % of the visitors who pass_through the city are here on business , and more_than a_few have very likely never seen the top of the Zugerberg , or even the oriel_windows of the Old Town . Zug today , in addition to being a tax haven to thousands of foreign firms-in-a-box , is the thriving base of hundreds of dynamic , on-site corporations , both domestic and international , all drawn by the variety of factors that make Zug a fiscal lure : the lowest taxes in Switzerland , a central location in Europe , proximity to Zurich and its international airport , the stability of the_Swiss economy , the confidence inspired by Swiss banks and a very pleasant lifestyle . The third smallest of Switzerland ' s 26 cantons , Zug has the highest per capita income -- about $ 58 # 000 -- in the confederation . Among American corporations with sales offices or subsidiaries here in the canton of Zug are Nutrasweet , 3M , Johnson &amp; Johnson , Eastman Chemical and Hoover U.K. Big business and foreign money have sparked the somewhat chaotic development of New Zug , a totally different , and significantly less charming , entity from Old Zug on the lake . Sprouting from the_hills above the town , and rising from the sidewalks of the streets leading away from the railroad_station , are clusters of mid-rise office_buildings , apartment_houses and shopping_centers . For the pioneer tourist to Zug , the town offers a good couple of days ' worth of quiet pleasure , away from the tour buses , the loudspeakers and the camera-slung hordes rampant in Switzerland ' s more breathtaking destinations . With its travel trade geared to businessmen and women , however , the choice of hotels is less than exciting . The best option is the City-Hotel Ochsen on the Kolinplatz in the Old Town . It ' s a historic hostelry built_in 1480 with a guest list that had included 19th-Century German poet Johann von Goethe ; King Louis-Philippe , who abdicated his French throne in 1848 , and Cardinal Borromeo , who visited Zug in 1570 . The renovated lobby is a contemporary mix of copper , granite and terra_cotta , while most of the 46 rooms are cloaked in a monastic palette of gray , brown and white . One recent guest described the decor as &quot; luxury clinic , &quot; but the rooms are not quite so antiseptic . The best room is No . 305 , a large double with a little round breakfast alcove set within one of the building ' s two oriel_windows . An alternative to the Ochsen is the Parkhotel , not far from the railroad_station and the Metalli Center shopping arcade in the contemporary part of town . Sleek , bustling with business people , the Parkhotelhas a Hilton-esque , you-could-be-anywhere ambience designed to diminish culture shock in a foreign city . For dining , there are several good restaurants in Zug and its environs with Old_World atmospheres or memorable views . &quot; Fish from the lake &quot; are_on almost every menu : They include felchen , a kind of whitefish ; egli , or perch , and the Lake Zug specialty , ro tel , a trout . The most acclaimed kitchens in town belong_to the Rathauskeller ( closed for renovation until August ) , the Aklin , the Hecht and the dining_room of the Ochsen , all_in the Old Town , and the Rosenberg , a hotel-restaurant high above town on the Zugerberg , with a terrace overlooking the lake . For a light lunch or dinner there is the Fischmarkt , a popular little bistro run_by the owners of the Aklin . You can get a generous ham-and-cheese sandwich on a baguette , pasta and salads , or daily specials of veal , chicken or lake fish . At least one meal in Zug should end with the region ' s most ubiquitous dessert -- the famous Zuger kirschtorte , a heady , moist , cake-and-cream confection that makes ample use of the cherry eau-de-vie called kirschwasser distilled in town from the local cherries . ( Many aficionados believe that the kirsch of Zug , powerful , pure and intensely fragrant , is the best in the world. ) At Christmastime the Zug post_office is kept busy sending_out the 35 # 000 kirschtorte that have been mail-ordered from around the globe . Visiting the shops and sights of the Old Town will take_up the better part of a day . The Museum in Der Burg -- with its collection of local art , history and culture -- is a large and impressively restored 12th-Century castle usually empty_of people but full of well-displayed prehistoric relics , religious art of the 15th and 16th centuries , traditional handicrafts , furniture , clocks , costumes , armor and weapons . Nearby is the handsome Kunsthaus Museum where six to eight temporary exhibitions a year feature 20th-Century art . You can take a private peek at the inner workings of the Zytturm , the 15th-Century clock_tower rising from the ancient town wall , by requesting the key at the police_station . On one landing of the tower are two small wooden cages once used , in a less humanitarian age , as jails ; on another landing are the exposed movements of the astronomical clock . Down at the harbor , a short walk from the Landsgemeindeplatz , three excursion boats -- the MS Zug , the MS Schwyz and the MS Reje -- depart mornings and afternoons for cruises that crisscross the lake , making two brief stops at each coastal village . On a warm , sunny day the trip is a nice way to improve your tan , but the three-hour ride begins to drag after the first 80 minutes or so . Rather than staying_on the boat the whole time , disembark at the little port of Immensee , have a dessert or a coffee or a tall , cool drink on the terrace of one of the harbor-side restaurants , and pick_up the boat again as it circles back about an hour later . Zug by day is percolating with activity and deals ; Zug by night is not . After dark , this is a very quiet town . Most Zugers prefer to spend evenings at_home with friends or family , going_out only when there ' s a particularly intriguing performance at the lakeside Theatre Casino , a colonnaded pink-and-white edifice built_in 1909 . In season , between September and June , a wide variety of cultural offerings light_up the hall . The eclectic , worldly roster of performances , which also include opera and symphony_orchestras , appeals_to a sophisticated audience largely comprised of what local residents call &quot; yoopies. &quot; This ever-growing segment of the population is generously augmented by young executives and their families from other European_countries and the United States . Zug , old as it is and provincial as it was , is now a cosmopolitan &quot; yoopie &quot; town full of youth , optimism and a distinct sense of well-being . The money , so many dollars , yen , pounds , pesos , marks , francs , riyals and dinars melted into one pot , helps . The spirit of Zug , and the Zugers , has grown open and friendly , unafraid of the new , the foreign , the different . In a country noted for its insularity and its cool reserve , Zug is a deep pocket of warmth .
