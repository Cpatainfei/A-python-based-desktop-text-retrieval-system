   <HEADLINE> JAMES HILL ; ' BORN FREE , ' ' AVENGERS ' DIRECTOR WAS 75</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> James Hill , whose directorial scenery ranged from the rich African veld of &quot; Born Free &quot; to posh British estates where &quot; The Avengers &quot; often worked their wily ways , has died . The Associated Press reported this week that Hill -- who won an Academy Award for his 1960 short film &quot; Giuseppina &quot; -- was 75 when he died in London on Oct . 7 . Neither The Times of London nor the wire_service reported a cause of death . Although the commercial success of &quot; Born Free , &quot; an overwhelmingly popular picture of 1966 , could have given Hill the choice of projects earlier denied him , he continued into his later years directing the small , quaint films he found appealing . &quot; Giuseppina , &quot; one of his first pictures , was an example . Produced in Britain and sponsored by British Petroleum , it was almost a formless documentary of one afternoon in the life of the daughter of a service_station proprietor . Hill ' s unobtrusive camera tracked her wry observations of her father ' s customers . After a brief stint as an actor with the Bradford Civic Playhouse near his birthplace in Airedale , England , Hill began directing after joining Britain ' s General Post_Office Film Unit . Funded by the government , it produced a series of documentaries still considered among the best of the genre . He joined the Royal_Air_Force as a filmmaker shortly after World_War_II broke_out in 1939 and found himself on bombing raids over Germany and Italy . Hill -- sometimes confused with U.S. producer James Hill who was once married to Rita Hayworth -- was taken prisoner after being shot down over Germany and was later decorated for bravery . Following the success of &quot; Giuseppina , &quot; Hill in 1961 directed a film adaptation of Arnold Wesker ' s stage play &quot; The Kitchen , &quot; and in 1962 made two film versions of plays by John Mortimer : &quot; The Dock Brief &quot; ( known in the United States as &quot; Trial_and_Error &quot; ) , which starred Peter Sellers as an unsuccessful attorney , and &quot; Lunch Hour &quot; with Shirley Anne Field . In 1965 , he moved_into the mystery-horror field with &quot; A Study in Terror &quot; and then to pop_music with &quot; Every Day ' s a Holiday. &quot; &quot; A Study in Terror &quot; was an imaginative account of how Sherlock_Holmes identified Jack the Ripper and featured some of Britain ' s best-known actors : Anthony Quayle , John Neville , Donald Houston and Judi Dench . &quot; Every Day ' s a Holiday &quot; had Freddie and the Dreamers as a prime musical attraction . Neither of the films was_well received . During the 1960s , Hill also worked in television , writing and directing many episodes of two popular and long-running thriller series -- &quot; The Saint &quot; and &quot; The Avengers. &quot; &quot; Born Free , &quot; based on Joy Adamson ' s autobiographical account of a family of lions and filmed in Kenya , starred the husband-and-wife team Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers as game_wardens . But the real stars were Elsa , the lioness , and her cubs . The documentary-drama , with its intimate examination of the family life of lions , was a huge hit with audiences of all ages . Hill followed that with other animal films -- &quot; An Elephant Called Slowly &quot; in 1970 , again with McKenna and Travers ; &quot; Black Beauty &quot; in 1971 based on Victorian writer Anna Sewell ' s children ' s classic about a horse ; &quot; The Lion at World ' s End , &quot; which Hill co-directed with Travers in 1971 , and &quot; The Belstone Fox &quot; in 1973 .</TEXT>
