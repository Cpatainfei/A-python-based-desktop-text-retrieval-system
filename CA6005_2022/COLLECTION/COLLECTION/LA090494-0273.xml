   <HEADLINE> CAMPAIGN ' 94 : ISSUES AND ANSWERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two candidates are running in the Nov . 8 election to represent the 67th Assembly District . They are Democrat Jonathan Woolf-Willis of Huntington Beach and Republican Doris Allen , the incumbent , from Cypress . Here ' s where they stand on four issues . &quot; Three Strikes &quot; Crime Law Woolf-Willis : &quot; The concept of ' three strikes ' is good . It prevents violent felons from hurting more victims . But the law must focus_on those who commit violent felonies . If we do not combine ' three strikes ' with alternative programs for nonviolent offenders , we will overcrowd our prisons and bankrupt our state . Here are several additional programs of smart prevention and tough enforcement that I propose : more police on the street , community-based policing , early intervention , a ban on automatic weapons , prisoner work programs to compensate victims and pay_for room and board , expanded drug treatment programs. &quot; Allen : &quot; Although there are always alternatives that may prove effective in dealing with crime , I have always been a staunch supporter of ' three strikes ' legislation . When fully implemented by the judicial_system , these laws put an end to the repetitive nature of felons . If you are not on the street , you can ' t commit crimes against society . The people of California called_for real time for real crimes , and I agree . What needs to be watched now are the liberals ' attempts to weaken the law by inserting exemption clauses on felonies that otherwise would be included in ' three strikes. ' This circumvention could render one of the toughest crime deterrents in the state impotent. &quot; Measure to Curtail Benefits to Illegal Immigrants Woolf-Willis : &quot; Illegal immigration is wrong . It needs to be stopped . I support what is being called a ' citizenship based ' immigration policy . It combines support for cutting the flow of illegal immigrants with measures to assist new immigrants in becoming citizens and acculturating . The three key aspects of this policy are : tough enforcement of immigration laws , assimilation of newcomers and re-examination of current immigration policies . ' SOS ' is not an intelligent response to the problem because it makes our doctors , nurses , teachers and social_workers do the job of federal law_enforcement . These professionals should not be the ones interrogating and arresting illegal immigrants -- that ' s like something out of Nazi Germany in the 1930s. &quot; Allen : &quot; The cost of services for illegal residents in California is enormous . Unless something is done to curtail this , it will bankrupt the state . While it is clear that something needs to be done , the jury on the ' Save Our State ' initiative is , in my mind , still out . It is unfortunate that the public has had to use the initiative process to resolve this legislative issue . While there were many attempts to address this matter legislatively , certain interests successfully stymied those efforts . Any negative impact on the health and safety , as well as any unanticipated future costs to the legal residents of California , needs to be seriously and thoroughly scrutinized before a vote on this serious ballot measure is cast. &quot; Single-Payer Health Initiative Woolf-Willis : &quot; I have two objections to the plan . First , it is funded primarily by a business payroll tax at a time when businesses are leaving California for other states where there are less taxes and less regulations . Secondly , health_care is a national problem . Reform should come_on the national level . Most Americans want a universal health_care program of some type . That need transcends partisan politics . I am hopeful that the current bipartisan efforts in Congress will result in a plan that will have the least impact on small businesses , while meeting the pressing need for reform. &quot; Allen : &quot; The idea that the government can supply the people of California with a better and more affordable health plan is a fallacy . California currently offers some of the best health_care in the world . Forming a huge government bureaucracy to implement health_care would neither lower costs nor improve the quality of services available , and it would be an incredible strain on the state ' s already fragile economy . What is needed is less governmental involvement , not more. &quot; Future Uses For El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station Woolf-Willis : &quot; The future use of the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station is the most important regional decision that will be made in Orange County this decade . The appointed commission should finish its job and make its recommendations on the highest and best use for the property . One concept that deservess more study is converting El Toro into a mixed-use sporting facility , including a first-class professional_baseball stadium for the California Angels . That would permit a complete renovation of Anaheim Stadium as part of our community ' s efforts to keep the Rams . Youth sports and Olympic training centers could also be combined with the stadium. &quot; Allen : &quot; I have always believed_in the process of government responding to the people . The issue of the potential development of a commercial airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station will be before the people on the November ballot . The wishes of the voters should be the single most important factor_in deciding the future use of this great resource for Orange County . The question before the Orange County electorate is whether the county will choose to aggressively move_into the international arena or to continue the status quo. &quot; * Source : Individual candidates ; Researched by ERIC BAILEY / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
