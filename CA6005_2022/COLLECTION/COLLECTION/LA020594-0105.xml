   <HEADLINE> CENTRAL ASIA ; TAJIK REFUGEES : PRISONERS OF FEAR IN A FOREIGN LAND ; ABOUT HALF OF THOSE WHO FLED TO AFGHANISTAN TO ESCAPE CIVIL WAR HAVE RETURNED . BUT THOUSANDS ARE DAUNTED BY TALES OF DEATH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The tent is swept clean and the bedding neatly folded against the wall . Kalander Mahmadnazar sits cross-legged while his wife and daughters kneel behind a low table , covering their faces from the strangers at the door . &quot; It ' s hard to live here in the winter , &quot; says Mahmadnazar , a refugee from Tajikistan . &quot; But the Communists burned our houses . We escaped because they tried to kill us . They accused us of being Muslim extremists. &quot; Not long ago he got a letter from home , about the new farmhouse he had built just before leaving . The letter said the roof had been stolen . It has been a year since Mahmadnazar fled with his 13 children from the civil_war in his former Soviet republic , joining an exodus of about 70 # 000 to Afghanistan . War has since given_way to occasional skirmishes ; about half the refugees have returned under a U.N. repatriation program . The rest are still in Afghanistan , held_back by their leaders-in-exile or their own fears . More_than 20 # 000 people died in the fighting in 1992 and early 1993 , when the Communist elite that ruled Tajikistan in Soviet days defeated an insurgency led by Islamic and democratic_parties . Opposition leaders were imprisoned , killed or driven into exile . After regaining control , the Russian-backed regime began repatriating refugees last April , hoping to dry_up the pool of anti-government guerrillas and take the economically shattered country off a war footing . At least 18 returning refugees were killed in reprisals in the early stages . But U.N. officials now say security is good . Refugees here , however , have been told little about the repatriation option . Asked about their plans , most mention the killings as an obstacle . &quot; If there is security , everyone will go , &quot; one old_man in the Kunduz camp said . &quot; I ' ll go_back when Tajikistan is free , &quot; said Abdul Karim , a young_man drawing water from a well , who came here with his wife and 4-year-old son a year ago . Of the original 70 # 000 refugees in Afghanistan , 36 # 000 have returned to Tajikistan , 18 # 000 remain in a camp near Mazar-i-Sharif , 15 # 000 in Kunduz and 1 # 000 in Talokan , U.N. officials say . Their life is harsh here in Kunduz -- no electricity , telephones and other amenities they took_for granted in Tajikistan . They subsist on dry bread that townspeople use for animal fodder . The United Nations stopped giving food aid to refugees here after an attack on one of its officials a year ago . &quot; We were told in various ways that we were not welcome , &quot; another U.N. official said . When Tajik opposition leaders refused to let the United Nations distribute the food , its mission left . Behind the dispute , U.N. officials say , is an effort by opposition leaders to block repatriation , which threatens to undermine their political base . These leaders maintain publicly that there are 80 # 000 refugees in the camps and that &quot; only a_few &quot; have returned to Tajikistan . &quot; We could have repatriated the lot if it hadn ' t been for constant harassment , &quot; the U.N. official said . Opposition leaders are especially resistant because the Tajik government refuses to negotiate with them . As long as it is in power , they might never be allowed to return . In the leafy town of Talokan sits one such leader , Sayed Abdullah Nuri , in an office furnished in the spare Afghan style . He claims that 5 # 000 armed fighters are under his leadership and that they control most of the Pamir mountain region of eastern Tajikistan . While the Tajik government claims it is fighting a holy war against Islamic militants , there is little evidence in the refugee camps of fundamentalist fervor or significant military aid from Afghan moujahedeen or Arab Islamic groups . In any case , Tajik guerrillas cross clandestinely into their country from Afghanistan , skirmishing with 25 # 000 Tajik border troops and 15 # 000 Russian soldiers . &quot; Our struggle is for a united Tajikistan , &quot; Nuri says , looking_out at the distant snowcapped peaks of his homeland . &quot; We want to free_people from the hands of a cruel government . If it can be settled by negotiations , I ' m in favor of this. &quot;</TEXT>
