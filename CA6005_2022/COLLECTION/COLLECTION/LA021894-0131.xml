   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : ALLURING FOREIGN BOND FUNDS CAN BE RISKY BUSINESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Imagine two cars on opposite ends of a roller_coaster , and you ' ll get_the_picture on the sudden divergence between U.S. interest_rates and rates in most other countries . U.S. rates are climbing as investors focus_on our economy ' s strength . But in Europe , Japan and Latin_America , rates remain on a downward slope because economic weakness still is the rule abroad . On Thursday , we saw new supporting evidence for both trends . Yields on 30-year U.S. Treasury_bonds jumped to 6.54 % -- the highest since August -- as investors anticipated inflation rising as the U.S. economy revs_up . Meanwhile , Germany ' s central_bank cut its short-term discount_rate to 5.25 % from 5.75 % . It was another in a string of cuts aimed at priming the German economy for recovery . For the millions of Americans who own bonds or bond mutual_funds , the polar difference between the interest_rate outlook here and the outlook abroad is no minor issue : The simple fact is , rising rates here are eating_away at U.S. bonds ' principal values , while foreign bonds are appreciating as market rates slide elsewhere in the world . * So , is it time to trade your U.S. Treasury or corporate_bond fund for a foreign fund ? On the surface , at least , that looks_like a smart move . For one thing , long-term bond yields abroad are generally higher or just slightly lower than U.S. yields , which means you may be able to grab a higher current yield than what you ' re earning in a U.S. fund ( depending_on when you bought your U.S. fund ) . Second , the likelihood of foreign rates declining further is strong , because there ' s no sign of economic recovery in Europe or Japan . &quot; The Europeans figure they ' re 18 months behind us &quot; in their economy , said Carl Ericson , manager of the Colonial Strategic Income mixed-bond fund in Boston . Eighteen months ago , of course , the United States thought it was still mired in recession , and interest_rates were ratcheting ever lower . Even in 1993 , though U.S. interest_rates were still falling_for much of the year , foreign rates fell faster . The result : The average foreign bond fund produced a total return ( yield plus share-price appreciation ) of 17 % last year , according to fund tracker Lipper Analytical Services in New York . In contrast , the average U.S._government bond fund ' s total return was 9.3 % for the year . Unfortunately , the numbers make foreign bonds look_like a layup . They aren ' t . The risk in buying foreign bonds today is substantial , experts warn . Start with currency risk . If our economy continues to expand while Europe flounders , a natural side_effect should be a stronger dollar . When the dollar rises , it automatically devalues foreign securities held by Americans -- which means you can lose money , on paper , even if foreign interest_rates fall and your foreign bonds appreciate in their home country . A bond fund can attempt to hedge against currency fluctuations using futures and options , and many do . But hedging costs money , and it doesn ' t always work as advertised . For a reminder of the pitfalls in foreign currency fluctuations , think_back to the trauma to Europe ' s monetary_system in 1992 , when European_nations suffered from a mass devaluation of their currencies . The result was havoc in many U.S.-based foreign bond funds , hedged and unhedged . That year , the average world bond fund ' s total return was a paltry 2.82 % , even though nominal yields on the funds were over 8 % . * Perhaps the greater risk today in foreign bonds is political , said Robert Di Clemente , economist at Salomon Bros . in New York . Japan is obviously in a political uproar over the trade row with America . In Europe , elections loom in Italy ( March ) , Germany ( October ) and other countries . With high unemployment and social strife across Europe , Di Clemente said politicians could be tempted to choose re-inflation ( i.e. , heavy government spending ) as a way_out . If that happens , interest_rates could reverse in a hurry . Finally , before you dump your U.S. bond fund because interest_rates are rising here , remember that the rise has been going_on since last fall . Di Clemente and many other pros believe that long-term U.S. yields are closer to a near-term top than a bottom . This may be the wrong time to sell . Still , if you can accept the risks in foreign bonds , they may make_sense for a portion ( say , 20 % to 25 % ) of your bond portfolio . If you don ' t want to buy a foreign fund directly ( most fund companies offer them ) , you can get foreign diversification another way : Choose a &quot; flexible &quot; or &quot; mixed &quot; bond fund that can invest in any type of bond . Most of them own at least some foreign issues .
