   <HEADLINE> INS MUST CONSIDER ' FAMILY TIES , ' APPEALS COURT RULES ; IMMIGRATION : THE DEPORTATION CASE INVOLVES A CANADIAN WHO HAD LIVED WITH HER U.S. BOYFRIEND FOR MANY YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Immigration officials must consider a woman ' s &quot; family ties &quot; to her boyfriend and his relatives in deciding whether to deport her , a federal appeals court ruled Friday . In a 2-1 decision , the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Ruta Marie Kahn of Encinitas may be able to demonstrate family ties , a factor weighing against deportation , even though the couple ' s relationship was not considered a marriage under California law . The court did not say that all unmarried couples should be considered to have family ties for purposes of the deportation law . But the judges indicated that a relationship qualifying as a common-law_marriage in states that recognize such marriages should be considered by immigration officials in assessing cases from other states . In dissent , Judge Alex Kozinski , who quoted the Paul Simon song &quot; 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover , &quot; said the Immigration and Naturalization Service has a legitimate reason to define a couple ' s family ties as marital_status under state law . Couples who live together in a state that does not recognize common-law_marriages &quot; can go their separate ways any time they please , &quot; Kozinski wrote . He cited one of the &quot; 50 ways &quot; in the Simon song : &quot; Just slip out the back , Jack. &quot; A common-law_marriage -- two people considering and representing themselves as husband and wife but without a legal ceremony -- is considered the equivalent of marriage in 13 states and in Washington . California does not recognize common-law_marriages but will accept another state ' s determination of such . Kahn ' s attorney , Frank Vecchione , said Kahn and boyfriend John Caldwell were recently married after having lived together for many years . Vecchione said their previous relationship probably would have been considered a marriage in many states . Kahn , a Canadian national , was admitted to the United States as a permanent legal resident in 1978 . The INS sought to deport her after she pleaded guilty to money-laundering and conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine . Vecchione said Kahn ' s role was limited to selling glassware in a chemical supply shop in San Clemente five or six years ago . He said she was placed on probation by a federal judge . Federal law allows deportation to be waived if an immigrant ' s good character , ties to the United States and other sympathetic factors outweigh the seriousness of the grounds for deportation . An immigration judge ruled_in Kahn ' s favor , citing , among other things , her relationship with Caldwell -- who likened it to a common-law_marriage -- and his family . But the Board of Immigration Appeals denied a waiver , saying California law precludes recognizing the couple ' s relationship as a family tie . The appeals court majority , Judges James Browning and Procter Hug , ordered the case reconsidered , saying deportation must be decided under a uniform federal policy . If family ties depend_on varying state laws , the court said , &quot; whether an alien is granted a waiver of deportation may depend_on that alien ' s state of residence. &quot; But Kozinski said the administration of many federal laws , including immigration law , depends_on state definitions of marital_status . For example , he said , a legal marriage to an American citizen , determined by state law , may make an immigrant eligible for admission to the United States . &quot; Marriage connotes a_level of stability and commitment that simply doesn ' t exist between unmarried folks , no matter how warm their relationship , &quot; Kozinski said . He also said the cases of many long-term gay and lesbian couples were more compelling than that of Kahn , who had the option of getting_married . Vecchione said the ruling &quot; reflects a recognition that in modern-day society , most romantic relationships of long standing have equal status with that of a legal marriage. &quot; He declined to comment on the possible implications for same-sex couples .</TEXT>
