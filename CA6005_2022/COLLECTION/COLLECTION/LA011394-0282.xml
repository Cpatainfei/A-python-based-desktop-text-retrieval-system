   <HEADLINE> SHOP_TALK ; NOW COULD BE RIGHT TIME TO BUY COMPUTER ; IT ' S A BUYER ' S MARKET . COMPETITION AMONG MANUFACTURERS IS FIERCE AND THE PRICE RANGE BETWEEN MAJOR BRANDS HAS NARROWED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last month Comp USA , one of the leading computer chains , opened a store at Oxnard ' s Rose Avenue shopping_center . It didn ' t get the attention Walmart got when it opened there , but the computer_store ' s arrival sure seemed to please local computer folks . Not that the store ' s presence makes_it any more palatable to plunk_down a couple thousand dollars on something you can ' t drive or live_in . It just provides more from which to choose . This might be a good sign for those of you computer illiterates out there who have been waiting for just the right time to take that plunge into the computer world . Not only is there more selection locally , but the computer market in_general is in good_shape . &quot; It ' s a great time to buy computers , &quot; said Jerry Reiter , a salesman and technician at Computer Village in Ventura . &quot; The industry has probably doubled_over the last six months to a year. &quot; Reiter said prices between rival computer makers , such_as Macintosh and IBM , are far more competitive than they once were . Macs used to be substantially more expensive than IBMs . Also IBMs are closer_in price to their clones than they ever have been . Now , before you go running_off on your high-tech journey , we thought we ' d give you some basic shopping tips , without getting too technical . Computer shopping is no easy task . You probably figured that one out yourself . Like buying a car , a house and other investment items , purchasing a computer is not to be rushed into . First , sit_down and figure_out a_few things before shopping around . &quot; What are your computing needs ? Define your short-range and long-range needs , &quot; said Bob Barbabella , owner of Data Connections in Simi Valley . &quot; Then determine what computer is going_to meet those needs . A lot of people have no idea and they are going_to want to find a computer_store where the people are knowledgeable and will take the time to help them. &quot; We took Barbabella ' s advice and checked_out a_few shops . Generally everyone was friendly enough . People at the Good_Guys , Circuit City , and Comp USA were all willing to help and to answer questions they must have heard a_thousand times . One thing that concerned us , however , was that we asked the same technical questions of different salespeople and got different answers . People tended to be more knowledgeable_about computers at stores that specialize in computers . If you ' re a first-time buyer that can be critical . Sometimes things aren ' t what they seem . And sometimes it ' s hard to tell what things seem to be anyway . &quot; You ' ve got_to know what you ' re buying . Know what ' s inside the box , &quot; said Barbabella . &quot; If there ' s no name on a car and you can ' t look under the hood , you would n ' t buy_it . But people do that all_the time when dealing with a computer . We tell people you don ' t want to be penny-wise and pound-foolish . Rarely , rarely , rarely is the lowest buy the best deal. &quot; Part of the decision process is determining which computer_system to go_with : IBM ( or versions of it ) or Macintosh . Reiter has a simple answer_for people who ask . &quot; I ask them what they ' re going to be using the computer for . If this is their first time with a computer and they have no knowledge , I recommend Mac . If they have knowledge and they are going_to be using it in business , I recommend IBM . I would n ' t let someone sell you on a monstrous machine if all you ' re going to do is write letters. &quot; In addition to the overwhelming choices out there , computer_technology is changing so rapidly that the machine that is &quot; in &quot; today may be old stuff tomorrow -- or sooner . There ' s that fear -- for first-time buyers in particular -- that by the time you learn how to use the equipment you ' re about to purchase , it already will be obsolete . &quot; I could sell you something and a half-hour later something new is_on the market . It ' s no different with cars or TVs , &quot; said Reiter . &quot; I recommend people buy a higher-end computer over a lower-end computer because they might not outgrow it as quickly. &quot; Not that the older versions won ' t work . Many older computers can handle the faster software available today . But there are many that can ' t . Barbabella said it is important to find a machine that can be upgraded if necessary . When you feel_like you ' re ready to hit the stores , grab a_few local publications and check_out the computer ads . At some point -- probably sooner than later -- you ' ll have to balance your computer needs with how much you can afford to spend . Just about everything is_on sale somewhere these days and many older computer_systems have dropped_in price . These ads are nice to have in_hand when you visit stores , because many local shops , Comp USA and the Good_Guys among them , will often offer to match advertised prices . A final word_of_advice : You will probably want to consider shopping at a store where assistance by phone or in_person is available , should something go_wrong with your machine . It ' s nice to know you can get help when necessary . Leo Smith is a regular contributor to Ventura County Life .
