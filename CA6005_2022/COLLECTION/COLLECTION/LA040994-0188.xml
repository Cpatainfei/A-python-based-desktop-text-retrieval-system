   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; EXIT HOSOKAWA , CUE BUREAUCRATS ; JAPAN ' S ECONOMY LIKELY TO IMPROVE , BUT NOT TRADE RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While it provoked a brief -- and quickly reversed -- plunge on the Tokyo stock_market Friday , Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ' s plan to resign is widely viewed_as unlikely to hurt Japan ' s struggling economy and might even help , many analysts said . Hosokawa ' s resignation is expected to end a political deadlock , increasing chances that a budget will be passed and that economic stimulus measures can take_effect . Japan ' s recession -- its worst in the postwar era -- is widely expected to end this year , thanks in part to growing exports to an expanding U.S. economy . Longer term , however , there are serious questions about whether Japan will undertake substantial economic and political reforms no matter who succeeds Hosokawa . Without such change , trade relations could worsen with the United States and the rest of the world . Still , assuming that there is a smooth transition to someone within the ruling coalition , such_as Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata , Hosokawa ' s departure is &quot; not necessarily bad news for the economy and stock_market , &quot; said Kathy Matsui , a strategist at Goldman Sachs ( Japan ) Corp . &quot; Our economist is saying it ' s actually quite good news that Hosokawa is out. &quot; At Nomura Securities in New York , Anne Zachara , vice_president in_charge of Japanese equities , concurred , noting that Hosokawa ' s government was a reform coalition dedicated to economic stimulus through income_tax cuts and public spending as well as some initial steps to open Japan ' s markets to foreign competition . &quot; Those policies are all_in place and unlikely to change , &quot; she said . The most immediate effect of Hosokawa ' s departure may be passage of the government ' s budget . The opposition Liberal Democratic Party has blocked passage of a national budget_for the current fiscal_year , which began April 1 , to press its demand that Hosokawa respond to allegations of financial improprieties in the 1980s . Most observers now expect the Liberal Democrats to drop their opposition to passage of a budget , which in turn could make available funds for public works projects . &quot; They got his head , &quot; Jeffrey Young , an economic analyst at Salomon Bros . Asia Ltd. , said in referring to the Liberal Democrats ' role in_forcing Hosokawa from office . &quot; They can ' t ask_for too much. &quot; &quot; To the extent that Hosokawa was unable to push_through a fiscal stimulus package because of political opposition , his departure will help Japan deal with its slow economy , &quot; said Richard Drobnick , head of an international business program at USC . * Japan ' s economy has endured its worst postwar recession during the last three years , and its major banks are still saddled with an estimated $ 250 billion in bad loans left over from the giddy 1980s when real_estate and Tokyo stock prices soared in tandem . During the recession , Japan ' s companies have begun to restructure , although not as dramatically as their U.S. counterparts . Major layoffs have not hit the big companies . Still , banks have been writing_down some loans . And the belief has been growing in recent weeks that the recession is near an end . Bank_of_Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno , who has a reputation as a conservative forecaster , said this week that &quot; the economy is brighter. &quot; &quot; Inventory adjustments and corporate restructuring programs have progressed steadily , &quot; Mieno said . &quot; Exports are recovering due_to brighter overseas economies led by the United States. &quot; But that very reliance on exports to the United States indicates that long running imbalances in Japan ' s economy have not been dealt with and could cause problems . Hosokawa ' s departure is likely to increase trade tensions , Japan experts said , because it will leave policy controls in the hands of powerful government ministries that are opposed to a real opening of Japan ' s markets . The outgoing prime_minister had been trying to fundamentally change Japan ' s economy by reducing the power of the Ministries of Finance and of International Trade and Industry . But he faced determined opposition and his resignation will leave &quot; bureaucratic government in power indefinitely , &quot; said Chalmers Johnson , professor emeritus at UC San Diego . The Finance Ministry had already trimmed the size of a Hosokawa tax cut . Its foot dragging_on economic reform could aggravate tensions with the United States . In that respect , it would be better if the ruling coalition selects Hata , the apparent front-runner , to be the next prime_minister . Hata &quot; is perceived as serious about reform , he ' s got a better domestic base and the U.S. has a lot of confidence in him , &quot; Young of Salomon Bros . said . Another possibility is that both the ruling coalition and the opposition Liberal Democrats would split and that Michio Watanabe , leader of a Liberal Democrat faction , would be the next prime_minister . Hata and Watanabe , both former finance_ministers , are well-respected economic policy-makers , said Kenji Mizutani , vice_president of Tokai Research &amp; Consulting . Under Hata , &quot; there should be a continuation of policies , &quot; while Watanabe &quot; may change some of the nuances , &quot; said Kunio Miyamoto , chief economist at Sumitomo Life Research Institute . &quot; But I don ' t think we have a viable alternative to further deregulating our economy and further expanding domestic demand . So the substance shouldn ' t be very different. &quot; Mizutani added , however , that the overall political situation is likely to remain unstable at least until there is a new election that produces a clear winner . With so many political_parties and factions competing against each other , political uncertainty could continue for a year or two , he said . During this period , &quot; businessmen will not expect much &quot; in the way of decisive economic_policies , he said . Holley reported from Tokyo and Flanigan from Los Angeles . A Troubled Economy... Japan has been mired in its worst recession in the postwar era , due in part to slowed consumer spending and sluggish demand abroad for Japanese goods . Political troubles of now-resigning Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa have not helped matters . Japan ' s gross_domestic_product , quarterly in billions of U.S. dollars : $ 1 # 757.63 ...but a Reviving Stock_Market Despite the recession and Hosokawa ' s political troubles , the Japanese stock_market has rallied from its lows of last November . The comeback is partly just a buying response from bargain hunters , but there also has been optimism that an economic stimulus package would help pull the economy out of recession . The Nikkei index , weekly closes except latest : Friday : 19 # 934.99 , up 44.01 Sources : WEFA Group ; Bloomberg Business News</TEXT>
