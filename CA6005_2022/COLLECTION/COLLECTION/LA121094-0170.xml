   <HEADLINE> BRITISH , IRA WING HOLD FIRST-EVER FORMAL TALKS ; PEACE : THE SIDES ARE SEPARATED BY THEIR DEMANDS , BUT THE MEETING IS AMICABLE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT , SINN FEIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Leaders of the_British government and Sinn Fein , the political arm of the_Irish Republican Army , held their first-ever formal talks Friday as part of the continuing search for peace in Northern_Ireland . At the historic meeting in Belfast , the_British insisted that the IRA must hand_over weapons and explosives as part of a permanent settlement and that a majority of the people in Northern_Ireland should determine the eventual fate of the troubled province . Sinn Fein , for its part , called_for an end to British military operations in Northern_Ireland , where a 3-month-old cease-fire is holding after 25 years of violence , and argued that the_Irish people of both north and south should decide the province ' s future . The amicable talks , the first such negotiations in 22 years , lasted more_than three hours in Stormont Castle , once the seat of Northern_Ireland ' s government when the province was largely self-governed . Both parties agreed to meet again Dec . 19 . Former IRA member Martin McGuinness , who led Sinn Fein ' s delegation , told reporters : &quot; This is an opportunity which needs to be built_upon . It is now time to liberate the oppressed and the oppressor. &quot; McGuinness , leading a five-member delegation that included a man and woman convicted on terrorist charges , said the speedy release of IRA political_prisoners would greatly help the peace process . Until now , the_British government would not speak directly with Sinn Fein , because for years its leaders refused to renounce violence in its campaign to unify the island . But the_British have now accepted that the cease-fire , which began Aug . 31 , is evidence that the IRA is renouncing violence , and the government now feels free to talk directly to Sinn Fein leaders . But hard-line Protestant Unionists , who want Northern_Ireland to stay part of the United Kingdom , bitterly protested the direct talks between London and Sinn Fein . The Rev . Ian Paisley , leader of the Democratic Unionist Party , declared that the_British decision to deal with Sinn Fein was &quot; an utter disgrace. &quot; &quot; I ' m not worried about who Sinn Fein brings_to talks , &quot; Paisley said , &quot; I ' m worried about the talks themselves . They shouldn ' t have taken_place anyway. &quot; Britain ' s minister for Northern_Ireland , Michael Ancram , said after the Friday talks that they were &quot; businesslike and constructive &quot; and that everyone &quot; should take encouragement from them. &quot; But he added that illegal arms are a &quot; central issue &quot; in the peace process , saying , &quot; Their safe disposal will provide convincing evidence of a permanent end to the use of violence and of commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and the democratic process. &quot; But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said at a press_conference that the_British should not use the arms issue as an excuse to block talks . &quot; I ' m sure the_British government recognizes that as part of a lasting settlement there needs to be a decommissioning of all weapons , ( including ) the decommissioning of the_British army , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
