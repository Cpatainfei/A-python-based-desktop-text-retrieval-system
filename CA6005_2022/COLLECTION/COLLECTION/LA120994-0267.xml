   <HEADLINE> FORMER PREMIER TO LEAD JAPAN ' S NEWEST PARTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japanese politics was once again turned_on its head Thursday as a former ruling party prime_minister was elected to lead Japan ' s newest and biggest-ever opposition party . Toshiki Kaifu , who led the nation and served as president of the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) from August , 1989 , until October , 1991 , was elected over two rivals to the leadership of the New Frontier Party , a combination of eight opposition groups that lost power in June . Kaifu ' s selection , together with the unopposed choice of Ichiro Ozawa as secretary_general of the new party , put the same two men at the helm of Frontier as had steered the LDP when Kaifu was in power . In Thursday ' s election , Kaifu , 63 , won 131 votes among the 214 Frontier members of both houses of Parliament , defeating former Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata , who polled 52 , and Takashi Yonezawa , chairman of the middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist_Party , who received 31 votes . There were 180 Frontier members of the lower house voting , guaranteeing that the party would have at least that many seats in the chamber that chooses the prime_minister . The LDP , whose 38-year unilateral rule of Japan ended in August , 1993 , now controls 200 seats in the 511-member lower house and is the biggest part of the governing coalition under Socialist Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama . It was Ozawa , who favors an activist role for Japan abroad and a smaller government with less control over the economy at_home , who ended the LDP ' s almost four decades of unilateral power by defecting from the party 18 months ago . Then Kaifu bolted the LDP in June to run as Ozawa ' s candidate for prime_minister when the LDP backed Murayama . &quot; It is like turning the clock backward , &quot; the newspaper Asahi said in an editorial . The selection of Kaifu and Ozawa &quot; lacks freshness , &quot; it complained . Some TV commentators criticized the new party , which will hold an inaugural convention Saturday , as simply &quot; a second LDP , &quot; with no distinctive policy of its own . Yoshiro Mori , LDP secretary_general , condemned the combination as &quot; a resurrection of the old LDP essence , &quot; as if to imply that his own party had assumed a new character after forging its coalition with the Socialists -- an alliance that was the biggest upset of political traditions here . Kaifu returned the criticism . &quot; When I look_at the LDP-Socialist coalition , I see only support for the status_quo , &quot; Kaifu said . &quot; We need decisive reforms , decisive policies. &quot; Taking_over in the wake of a stocks-for-favors scandal , Kaifu , with a clean image , was a popular but ineffective prime_minister .</TEXT>
