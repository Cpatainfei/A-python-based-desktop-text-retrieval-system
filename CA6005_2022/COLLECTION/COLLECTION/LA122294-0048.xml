   <HEADLINE> STRICT LAWS GOVERN AMATEUR COLLECTORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Paleontology aside , fossil hunters are also required to know the law on hunting and collecting fossils . Basically , fossil hunting is regarded_as plundering by federal and state agencies . The law : collecting or even disturbing the remains of vertebrates on federal or state land is punishable by as much as $ 10 # 000 and 10 years in jail . Clear enough ? The law means that all_of the county ' s exotic fossils , from the rhinoceros-like Oredon to the 13-foot-tall imperial_mammoth , are off limits to hunters in Los Padres National Forest , Channel Islands National_Park , Point Mugu State Park and McGrath State Beach -- vast areas of land . The federal_government technically allows the collection of invertebrates , tiny spineless animals like the Ventura County starfish . But then it bans the use of invertebrate fossils for &quot; commercial purposes &quot; -- which the U.S. Forest Service defines as &quot; trading &quot; fossils , an activity that is almost inherent in serious fossil collecting . Beside a desire to preserve fossils , federal_officials hope to prevent the land from being torn_up by overzealous fossil hunters . &quot; Amateurs are very destructive , &quot; said Steve Horne , Forest Service archeologist , citing petrified wood beds that have &quot; nearly been destroyed &quot; in the Los Padres . The squeeze on fossil hunters goes_back to the 1906 federal Antiquities Act , which grew out of an effort to stop professional fossil hunters from looting dinosaurs bones after the great dinosaur discoveries of the 1880s and 1890s in Utah , Wyoming and Colorado . While accredited paleontologists doing university research are allowed to use federal and state land -- and even search for vertebrates -- government_agencies won ' t issue permits to amateur fossil hunters . &quot; I think there should be some controls , but I don ' t think it ' s fair that amateurs can ' t collect on public land , &quot; said fossil hunter Ray Meisenheimer . Fossil hunters say federal_officials are off base about them . &quot; As clubs and individuals , we do everything possible to follow the law , but we are being denied the right to pursue our hobby , &quot; Dave Champion said . &quot; The ( federal_government ) has an attitude about us . I even heard ( an official ) say , ' Why don ' t you just take pictures of the fossils ? ' that ' s the dumbest thing I ' ve ever heard . It ' s like telling a brewery to stop brewing and let people just take pictures of beer. &quot; The state goes even further than the federal_government . Removing anything , including invertebrate fossils , is prohibited at all state parks and beaches -- children are even barred from bringing_home a rock as a souvenir . Ventura County also has an ordinance against collecting anything from its parks and beaches . That doesn ' t leave much for county fossil hunters . They can hunt on public no-man ' s land -- road shoulders , freeway underpasses , city properties -- or they can find a friend or stranger willing to let them use private land , such_as construction sites and mountain ranches . But any rare discovery is likely to be claimed by the landowner . Fossil hunters have something besides access to worry about . Notorious pack_rats , they often have to build additions to their homes to house the Collection That Ate the Garage . The hobby is that consuming . &quot; A lot of us have our own museums , &quot; Bruno Benson said . &quot; Fossil hunting can really get_to a person. &quot; JEFF MEYERS</TEXT>
