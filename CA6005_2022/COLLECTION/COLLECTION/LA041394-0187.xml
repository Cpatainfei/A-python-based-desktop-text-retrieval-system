   <HEADLINE> ARTS CENTER OPENS UP TO RAY CHARLES ; VENUES : THE BOOKING OF THE LEGENDARY R &amp; B SINGER / PIANIST MARKS ANOTHER STEP IN A PLAN TO EXPAND ITS PROGRAMMING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a step beyond the hall ' s traditional boundaries , Orange County Performing Arts Center officials Tuesday announced that Ray Charles will perform there on June 9 . The renowned singer and pianist will be joined by the Ray Charles Orchestra and by his backup singers , the Raelettes . Jazz-blues singer Ernestine Anderson will open the show . Charles has performed at the center once before , in a pops concert with the Pacific Symphony , but this is the first time he will play with his own band in a concert presented by the center itself . Until a concert last year by Art Garfunkel , the center had shied_away_from pop acts of the post-World War II era . The Charles booking &quot; reflects my desire to continue to expand programming somewhat , &quot; said center president Tom Tomlinson . He maintained , however , that the concert is not really a departure , in that the center does offer an annual jazz series . Indeed , Tomlinson said he wanted to offer Charles as part of the jazz series , but timing made that impossible , so the concert is being offered as a &quot; stand-alone &quot; event . In a career spanning more_than 40 years , Charles has served a variety of American musical forms including jazz but also blues , R &amp; B , gospel , pop , even country . He scored his 12th Grammy award last month for his recording of &quot; A Song for You. &quot; Earlier this week , the center also announced a return engagement for magician David Copperfield , who will perform eight shows May 26 through 29 . Today , the center is expected to announce a weeklong run of a Broadway musical to be offered outside the regular Broadway series . Tickets for the Charles concert , which will start at 8 p.m. , range from $ 26 to $ 44 ; Copperfield tickets will be $ 19.50 to $ 35 with $ 7 discounts at matinees for children 12 and under . Both shows go_on sale April 24 . Information : ( 714 ) 556-2787 .</TEXT>
