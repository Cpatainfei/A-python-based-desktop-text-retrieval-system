   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; LOWELL WEICKER ; AN INDEPENDENT POLITICIAN AT A HIGHLY PARTISAN TIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even before he bolted the GOP to be elected governor of Connecticut as a third-party candidate in 1990 , Lowell P . Weicker Jr . had a reputation as a maverick politician with a keen intellect , an acerbic tongue and an unusual willingness to take unpopular stands . Indeed , Weicker has always taken_pride in being the antithesis of the slick , media-savvy politician . A giant of a man who stands 6-feet-6 inches tall and lumbers through life like the proverbial bull in the china shop , Weicker is known to his friends and enemies alike as both arrogant and highly principled . As a member of Congress for 20 years , before being defeated in 1988 , he often took stands that set him apart from most of his colleagues in the Republican_Party . He spoke out_in favor of abortion rights . He was arrested on the front steps of the South_African Embassy in Washington for protesting apartheid . And as a member of the Senate Watergate Committee , he was one of the first Republicans to find_fault_with then-President Richard M . Nixon . Later , as governor and founder of A Connecticut Party , Weicker succeeded in setting the state ' s finances straight by doing what_for most politicians would have been an act of political suicide : imposing a state income_tax . Not surprisingly , Weicker ' s personality and political record have made him highly controversial . While held_in high esteem in some quarters , it is not surprising that Weicker is portrayed as a villain by many of his constituents -- particularly conservative Republicans whose views he has consistently challenged . Weicker , in fact , seems to enjoy the vilification . As he sees it , hostility to his brand of politics is evidence that voters do not really appreciate the kind of principled leadership they claim to want . At age 63 , Weicker will be leaving public life in January . Although he entered politics with inherited family wealth , he now says a lifetime of service in low-paying elected offices has depleted his financial resources . As a private citizen , Weicker says he plans to do three things : make money , have fun and spend more time with his wife , five children and two stepchildren . Nonetheless , Weicker , whose success in getting elected in Connecticut has inspired other independent efforts across the nation , is suspected of nurturing a secret desire to run_for President in 1996 -- as a national third-party candidate . * Question : As the election approaches , there has been a lot of hand-wringing about the deterioration of political discourse and leadership in this country . How do you view the state of politics ? Answer : I think democracy is working as it should -- which is to say that the politicians are reflecting the views of their constituents . I do not belong_to the school that there ' s Washington out there , and there ' s us back here . I think the people of America do not want decisions ; they don ' t want the tough news or the bad news . They sort of want to coast along , and the net result is that the politicians are coasting along and the parties are coasting along . I realize this puts a somewhat reverse twist on everybody saying , &quot; Gee , you know , we ' re looking_for the right people in Washington. &quot; But the fact is that finger-to-the-wind politics , which never solves any problem , is creating finger-to-the-wind government , so that the most difficult problems are never resolved and we get increasingly frustrated . The fact is , the American people have now accorded their highest honors to those politicians who don ' t stand_for anything . And the net result , as far as the system is concerned , is we have gone from a politics of accountability to a politics of electability or reelect-ability . And that just does not work , because , very frankly , the realities of both opportunity and the realities of the problems don ' t yield to easy political solutions . Q : Hasn ' t finger-to-the-wind politics always been a problem ? A : I think_of my first important national election , i.e. , when I ran_for Congress in 1968 , and I ran against an incumbent Democrat , Donald Irwin . Irwin was a Johnson , pro-war , pro-Vietnam War Democrat . That was his position . I took the position we should be out of there . Both of us knew that we were going_to live or die on our position . That was going_to decide the election . And it did . that ' s not politics today . The idea today is to fuzz it up as_to where you stand on the issue . And that ' s where the shift has come . I increasingly saw it when I was in Washington , as both the Republicans and Democrats would get_together , sort of , on consensus solutions to deficit reduction that were meaningless . But they felt they didn ' t want to rock the boat too_much before an election and , therefore , it would n ' t become an issue . And it didn ' t become an issue and , consequently , it didn ' t become executive and legislative action after the election was over . Q : Is there a solution to this problem ? A : I think it ' ll come_to pass with the emergence of a third_party , or maybe more_than that . But at least a third to give competition to the other two . It ' s amazing that we have deregulated everything in the United States of America that ' s economic . The only thing we haven ' t deregulated is politics . We left it as a duopoly , or a monopoly , and it suffers all_the ills of any monopoly . In the case of the economics , of course , it ' s high prices and bad products . In the case of politics , it ' s bad ideas and bad candidates . So I think that that ' s the way this thing is going_to correct itself . Q : Where do you see a national third_party coming from ? A : It is already taking_place at the lower levels of government , i.e. , in local elections and state elections . I realize that what ' s probably running_through your mind -- and everyone else ' s mind -- is that we already have it nationally in terms of Ross Perot . But that ' s an aberration . It hasn ' t come_to pass nationally . I think , especially in politics , everything builds from the ground up , and it ' s building now and , someday , you ' ll end_up with a true centrist third_party . Don ' t forget Perot ' s just an individual out there . There ' s no party . But I ' m talking_about in a party sense -- that would develop_into a centrist third_party . We ' ve had a lot of other parties running at the national level , but never all-encompassing as far as the issues are concerned -- more centrist in addressing these issues . that ' s going_to happen . Q : First as a moderate Republican , then as a third-party politician , you ' ve had a unusual perspective on partisan politics . How has the dynamic between the two parties changed ? A : I think that you certainly have more attacks on the individual . that ' s not to say the parties didn ' t used to lock horns on issues and philosophies , but the personal aspects of politics have certainly not changed for the better . It ' s the substitution of ignorance and name calling_for intelligent debate . Again , I have to say that I do not exonerate the American people . They all sit there and say , &quot; Oh , that ' s just horrible , those negative ads. &quot; Well , let ' s face it , they follow those negative ads and they act_on those negatives . The price of this is that good people are not going_to go_into politics . Who wants to dive into a mud_bath ? And that ' s what you ' re asking people to do . Q : Are the two parties entirely to blame ? A : The media has to take it ' s share of responsibility . You have gone -- I say that in the editorial sense -- from a precise profession to a tabloid profession . And that has changed the tenor of everything . For example , suppose I say my press secretary kisses cows . The media used to say , &quot; All right , senator , let ' s see the proof here . We ' re not printing anything like that . Show us. &quot; In other words , show us the pictures , show us the evidence , show us the testimony where he kisses cows . Nowadays , if I say that , it ' s up_to him to prove that he doesn ' t . The media don ' t always demand the accountability of the politician as it used to . Indeed , they sort of revel in the more sensational and salacious of the accusations , the more it sort of sloshes around down there with them . Look , you know why the personal stuff has all_of a sudden come_to_the_fore . It ' s very , very easy . This monster called television needs material . And if the material is free , that ' s great -- because they ' ve got bottom_lines ; they ' re not philanthropic organizations . They ' ve got_to show a profit . So the more free material they get , the better . Q : Do you see the Republican_Party continuing to move to the right ? A : You can ' t spend , you know , 28 years in the party like I did and still not have an affection for it . And I still hope that the Republicans succeed , but not on the basis of where they stand now . Hopefully , they ' ll come_back to the center . I take_heart when I see a man like Rudy Giuliani . I wasn ' t for Giuliani to become mayor of New York City . He was too conservative . But I think he ' s doing an outstanding job . The force of his constituency that he is trying to serve dictates that he can ' t take stands way the hell off the road into the bush . But that ' s never been a comfortable factor for the Republican_Party . Witness Lowell Weicker , Jack Javits , Cliff Case , Ed Brook . I could go_down the whole checklist of men that represented very difficult Democratic constituencies and eventually it was the Republican_Party that did us all_in . Q : Rep . Newt Gingrich says people in Washington are abnormal -- A : That certainly applies to Newt Gingrich more_than anybody else . Q : His point is that our leaders in Washington have lost touch . A : No . No . They ' re very reflective of what ' s out here . I think the American people are getting exactly what they want . What they want right now is nothing . They don ' t want change . . . . And then when we get_into trouble , they blame Washington . Q : How do you view President Clinton ? A : Whether you agree or disagree_with President Clinton on many of his initiatives as_to the details , the fact is , for the first time , this Administration is raising great issues to the level of national debate . So I admire the Administration -- we ' re talking health_care , we ' re talking welfare reform , we ' re talking deficit reduction . I say agree or disagree -- but these are major issues that confront the nation , and they should be discussed . They should be voted on . And the minute anybody comes_forth with a plan for change , everybody jumps all_over it . It ' s not an easy task to lead . That is the problem right now . They get leadership ; they don ' t want leadership . The American people eventually will understand that all this nonsense doesn ' t work and they ' ll then demand -- No . 1 -- leadership , and they ' ll demand that leadership do the things , as unpleasant as they are , to go_ahead and put the nation back on its feet . Q : This year , a lot of wealthy_men , like yourself , are running_for office . Will they be any more independent , more willing to lead ? A : I ' m not the guy to ask because I ' m not independently wealthy . I ' m broke . But rumor aside , let me just say one thing right now . Every time you try to effectuate any sort of a pay raise for public officials , God , all_the editorial writers and the public have a field_day . I ' m running , in the state of Connecticut , a $ 10-billion business . that ' s the budget of the state . I get paid $ 78 # 000 . I mean , how ridiculous . I ' ve not asked_for a pay raise . But what about the brilliant young_person who , let ' s say , has had a tough time coming_up ? Are you going_to get them in public_service for those kinds of prices ? I don ' t think so . For God ' s sake , pay the people who are in public office and it ' ll do two things . No . 1 , it makes them independent of the special_interests . No . 2 , it is an attraction in terms of people able to serve and you have a far greater talent pool than just people that , as you say , are independently wealthy. *</TEXT>
