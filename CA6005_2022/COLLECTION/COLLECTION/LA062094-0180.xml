   <HEADLINE> DID GRASS SCARE OFF PIERCE ? ; WIMBLEDON : WITHDRAWAL OF FRENCH OPEN FINALIST LEADS TO MUCH SPECULATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The London tabloids are in mourning , to say nothing of the All England Lawn and Tennis_Club , where a fortnight of Wimbledon begins today without the tormented Mary Pierce , without much suspense and without a monopoly on the days ' headlines . Pierce , seeded seventh and set to make her first Wimbledon appearance , withdrew from the tournament late Saturday , citing &quot; reasons far beyond my control. &quot; In Pierce-speak , that presumably means her father , banished from the tour for verbally abusing the 19-year-old star , was making a beeline for Wimbledon , ban or no ban . But not everyone was convinced . Billie Jean King , interviewed for British television , suggested that Pierce was scared stiff of the draw , so_much so that fellow players were making bets_on when she would pull_out . &quot; Many of the players think the story about her dad was just a smoke_screen , &quot; said King , a former Wimbledon champion who is here as an HBO analyst . A more likely scenario is that Pierce is simply scared of Wimbledon ' s grass courts . After reaching the_French Open final , Pierce arrived_at the Volkswagen Cup at nearby Eastbourne and was beaten promptly in the quarterfinals of an under-21 event by Czech Ludmila Varmuzova , ranked 639th . The surface : grass . Whatever the reasons , Pierce , one of only two players to defeat No . 1-ranked Steffi Graf this year , is a no-show . Her absence not only ruins things for the Fleet_Street beasties ( &quot; I Love To Walk Around My House Naked , &quot; read a recent Pierce-inspired headline in the Daily Mirror ) , but it also further reduces the chances of anyone upsetting the near-invincible Graf on the clipped-grass courts , where she has won three consecutive titles . Granted , it would have been a stretch . Pierce beat Graf on the clay courts of Roland Garros , which isn ' t exactly the same thing as the fickle crew-cut surfaces of Wimbledon . &quot; Mary killed her . . . well , beat her pretty bad , &quot; said Murrieta ' s Lindsay Davenport , who is seeded seventh after moving_up two spots following Pierce ' s withdrawal . &quot; More players now have a little more confidence. &quot; Maybe it ' s ignorance , maybe it ' s jet_lag , but Davenport said she has as good a chance as anyone of moving through the brackets . Big girl . Big serve . Big game . Of course , Davenport , 18 , didn ' t arrive until Sunday -- she skipped the pre-tournament practice_sessions at Wimbledon to attend her high_school graduation ceremony -- and didn ' t hear about Pierce ' s decision until early afternoon . As for the supposed reason for Pierce ' s absence , Davenport didn ' t buy_it . &quot; I don ' t think she ' d pull_out because of that , &quot; she said . So , gone is Pierce , and long gone is Monica Seles , leaving the task of an unlikely upset of Graf to the_likes_of No . 4 Martina Navratilova , No . 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and No . 3 Conchita Martinez , both of Spain , and No . 5 Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic . Navratilova , a nine-time singles winner at Wimbledon and the oldest player in the draw at 37 , is making her final singles appearance at the Grand_Slam event . Though Navratilova was beaten_in the quarterfinals at Eastbourne , her serve-and-volley game could get her to the semifinals , maybe to the final if the tennis gods have a flair for the dramatic . Sanchez Vicario is fresh from winning the_French Open , while Martinez has the memory of last year ' s trip to the Wimbledon semifinals . Novotna led , 4-1 , against Graf in the third set of last year ' s final before losing . Longshots ? Eighth-seeded Natalia Zvereva of Russia , 30th-seeded Zina Garrison-Jackson or perhaps unseeded Lori McNeil , who faces Graf in the first round . In 1992 , McNeil upset Graf in the opening round of the Virginia Slims Championship and became the lowest ranked player ( No . 18 at the time ) to defeat the German star since 1985 . The men ' s side of the draw is more muddled . No . 1-seeded and defending champion Pete Sampras has one of the deadliest serves in the game -- a near-must to win Wimbledon -- and has lost only five matches all year . But on occasion , Sampras has a knack of struggling with his concentration . Germany ' s Michael Stich , who won here in 1991 , is seeded second and is 6-1 on grass this year , and Sweden ' s Stefan Edberg , seeded third , has won two Wimbledon titles and has the serve-and-volley game to win another . From there , who knows ? Croatian Goran Ivanisevic , seeded fourth , has the killer serve and the killer inconsistency . Fifth-seeded Jim Courier reached the final of last year ' s tournament , but will be the first to acknowledge that grass isn ' t his favorite playing surface . American Todd Martin , who is seeded sixth , beat Sampras in the final at Queen ' s Club a week ago , which should count for something . Then there is seventh-seeded Boris Becker of Germany , a three-time champion who almost always plays well at Wimbledon . But as late as Sunday evening , there were rumors that he might withdraw because of a knee injury . Andre Agassi , two years removed from his surprising Wimbledon title , is healthy , happy and capable of confounding the experts once more . Last year , he arrived with a gut , but no chest hair . This time , no gut and . . . well , no word on the chest hair .</TEXT>
