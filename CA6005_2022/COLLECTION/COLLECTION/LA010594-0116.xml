   <HEADLINE> BOSNIA WARNED THAT U.N. TROOPS WILL LEAVE IF WAR GOES ON ; BALKANS : WORLD BODY ' S MILITARY COMMANDER IN WAR-TORN REPUBLIC HAS QUIT IN FRUSTRATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> European Union mediator Lord Owen warned at the start of peace talks here Tuesday that U.N. troops will be pulled_out of Bosnia-Herzegovina unless the bloodletting ceases -- a threat underscored by disclosure that the U.N. commander in Bosnia has resigned in frustration . Lt . Gen . Francis Briquemont asked a month ago to be relieved of his duties , the Belgian Defense Ministry said in Brussels on Tuesday in confirming his imminent departure . Last week Briquemont lambasted the U.N. Security_Council for passing grandiose resolutions while failing to provide the military muscle to enforce them . His complaints echoed those of French Gen . Jean Cot , who is in_charge of the entire 26 # 000-strong U.N. Protection Force mired in the Balkans and has been increasingly resentful of what many see as Mission_Impossible . Announcement of Briquemont ' s decision to leave his post came as Bosnian and Croatian leaders met here for the latest attempt at negotiation . The talks between Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic adjourned without any reported breakthrough but were expected to resume today . The meeting was mediated by Owen and his U.N. partner in the roving peace talks , Thorvald Stoltenberg , in hopes of calming one of the two most vicious conflicts in Bosnia prior to the Jan . 18 resumption of negotiations in Geneva that will tackle the larger offensive , that of the Bosnian Serbs . Sarajevo , the Bosnian capital , continued to suffer an intensive artillery pounding by Serbian rebels , with at least nine civilians killed by the shelling after 15 fatalities Monday . In central Bosnia , forces of the Muslim-led government have been engaged in a bloody struggle with Bosnian Croats for control of the vital Lasva River valley , which both sides want as part of their ministates being carved out of shattered Bosnia . Owen was apparently seeking to step_up pressure on the Muslims and Croats when he threatened during a British radio interview to remove U.N. forces from Bosnia deployed to escort lifesaving aid to virtually all_of the population . Some diplomats from the European Union ( formerly the European Community ) have complained that the humanitarian mission is keeping the battles alive , as well as the civilians . Owen and Stoltenberg have brought the combatants near to a negotiated settlement twice over the past four months , only to see agreement collapse as one side or another balked at a last-minute concession . Silajdzic and Granic have proclaimed themselves in_agreement on basic issues after past negotiations , but both have failed to compel some elements of their armed forces to abide_by calls to resume joint efforts to withstand the Bosnian Serb sieges . &quot; I do not think we have the right to fail any more , &quot; Silajdzic told reporters before his talks with Granic . But he conceded that the Croatian and Muslim populations are now deeply distrustful of each other . Both government and Croatian forces are feeling pressured by this week ' s change of EU leadership to agree to the formula for ethnic division endorsed by Owen and Stoltenberg . It would grant about half of Bosnia to the Serbs , one-third to the government , 17 % to the Croats and put Sarajevo under U.N. administration . Greece has assumed the rotating EU presidency , raising fears it will work in favor of its closest Balkan allies , the Serbs.DEMOBILIZATION</TEXT>
