   <HEADLINE> KWAN WILL GET A TICKET TO SKATE ; OLYMPICS : BECAUSE SHE IS AN ALTERNATE , DETAILS OF WHEN OR WHERE THE 13-YEAR-OLD WILL GO HAVE NOT BEEN DETERMINED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Michelle Kwan of Torrance has been notified by U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . officials that they will send her a plane_ticket . They have not , however , told her when or where she is going . Although the association announced Wednesday that Kwan will travel_to Norway to train for the Feb . 12-27 Winter_Olympics , officials acknowledged that they have to work_out numerous details , including her exact destination . Because Kwan , as an alternate , is not allowed to live_in the athletes ' village with the other figure skaters or to train with them at the official practice rink , other accommodations are being sought , preferably 80 miles south of here in Oslo . But if they cannot arrange ice time in the Norwegian capital , they will have to look elsewhere . A spokesman for the Kwan family said Copenhagen and London have been mentioned . &quot; I don ' t know quite when we ' re going or where or what else is happening , &quot; said Frank Carroll , who coaches Kwan at Lake Arrowhead ' s Ice Castle International Training Center . &quot; All I know is we ' re going . Now , at least we can get organized , do our laundry and pack. &quot; Of course , the larger question of whether Kwan will actually compete in the Games still looms . When she became the first alternate for the two berths the United States has in the women ' s competition here by finishing second to Tonya Harding in last month ' s national championships , it appeared that Kwan might replace Nancy Kerrigan . The defending champion withdrew from the U.S. competition because of knee injuries sustained in an assault the day before the skating began . But now that judges have decided Kerrigan can compete , it is more likely that Kwan will be called_upon to replace Harding . A hearing panel appointed by the USFSA will reconvene Friday to decide whether it should recommend Harding ' s removal from the team because of code of ethics violations , including her failure to report immediately all that she knew about the assault on Kerrigan to law_enforcement authorities . The U.S. Olympic Committee has until Feb . 21 , two days before the women ' s skating competition begins , to substitute Kwan for Harding . Carroll said the USFSA has discussed Feb . 12 and Feb . 16 as possible departure dates for Kwan . &quot; In light of developments in the last month concerning both Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding , we felt it would be a sensible move to send Michelle Kwan to Norway , &quot; Claire Ferguson , the association ' s president , said in a statement . &quot; Michelle is still a relatively young competitor , and by allowing her to train in Norway , we hope she will have a chance to get acclimated and prepared in case she is called_upon to compete. &quot; If she competes , Kwan , 13 , would become the youngest U.S. figure skater to participate in the Winter_Olympics . &quot; The only thing that has changed is that now I get_to train in Norway , and that will be fun , &quot; Kwan said .</TEXT>
