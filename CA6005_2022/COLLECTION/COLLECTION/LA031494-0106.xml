   <HEADLINE> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ; TEAM-BY-TEAM LOOK_AT THE NCAA MEN ' S TOURNAMENT ; WEST REGIONAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> 1 . MISSOURI ( 25-3 ) * Player to watch : Choose between senior guard Melvin Booker , the Big Eight Conference player of the year , or swingman Kelly Thames , the league ' s freshman of the year . Both players are largely responsible_for Missouri ' s success . Thames is often compared to Chicago Bull forward Scottie Pippen . Same facial_expressions . Somewhat similar moves . * Little-known fact : Two statistics the Tigers would prefer to forget : Coach Norm Stewart ' s teams are 9-14 in NCAA tournament play and none have reached the Final Four . * Outlook : If senior forward Jevon Crudup , who gives the Tigers an intimidating inside presence , can stay out of foul trouble , Missouri could be tough to beat . The Tigers have lots of experience ( eight seniors ) , lots of depth and unlike most Missouri teams , can shoot the three-pointer . The Tigers looked a little shaky as the regular season came_to an end , but that might have been because of the pressure to finish the Big Eight schedule without a loss ( they did ) . 2 . ARIZONA ( 25-5 ) * Player to watch : Guard Khalid Reeves is the easy choice , what with his 24.1 scoring average . But keep_an_eye_on Reggie Geary , the excitable and exciting sophomore guard who almost always is assigned to the other ' s team best offensive player . Geary held Michigan ' s Jalen Rose to 12 points and , before he fouled_out , caused all sorts of problems for Lamond Murray of California . It was no accident that as soon as Geary left the game , Murray began scoring . * Little-known fact : During the last seven seasons , Arizona has an . 841 winning percentage , the nation ' s highest . * Outlook : Arizona has one of the best backcourts in the country with Reeves and Damon Stoudamire , but they don ' t have a high-scoring small forward , something of a rarity for a Lute Olson-coached team . Instead , they have the defensive-minded Geary at that spot . As usual , Olson has done an admirable job during the regular season . Now he needs to re-establish his postseason credentials . The Wildcats lost each of their last two opening NCAA matchups . 3 . LOUISVILLE ( 26-5 ) * Player to watch : North Carolina ' s loss has been Louisville ' s gain as former Tar Heel Clifford Rozier continues to establish himself as one of the best centers in the nation . He recently named as one of five finalists for the U.S. Basketball Writers Assn. ' s player of the year . * Little-known fact : Louisville ' s NCAA record of 46 consecutive winning seasons , established from 1944-1990 , was matched by UCLA this season . * Outlook : A strange but often wonderful team , the Cardinals are good_enough to go long and far . . . and inconsistent enough to lose in the first round . We like their chances to go_far , but only if they keep their starters out of foul trouble and shoot reasonably well from the perimeter . Louisville has a thin bench , but its starters , especially Rozier and senior guard Greg Minor ( who ranks among the top 10 in six of the top 10 statistical categories in the Metro Conference ) , are golden . 4 . SYRACUSE ( 21-6 ) * Player to watch : Junior Lawrence Moten doesn ' t jump that well , doesn ' t run that fast , doesn ' t dazzle anyone with dunks . But CBS basketball analyst Billy Packer calls Moten one of the smartest players he ' s seen in recent years . Packer will get no argument from Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim , who has seen Moten ( 20.7 scoring average ) distinguish himself as a Big East all- conference selection in each of the last two seasons . * Little-known fact : Moten was a high_school teammate of Syracuse quarterback Marvin Graves . * Outlook : The Orangemen don ' t have much depth , but they do have three excellent players in swingman Moten , guard Adrian Autry and forward John Wallace . All three are among the top 10 scorers in the Big East . How will it translate in the NCAA tournament ? Sweet 16 sounds about right . 5 . CALIFORNIA ( 22-7 ) * Player to watch : Jason Kidd not only is the player to watch , he ' s the player to gawk at . The sophomore guard ( soon to be NBA rookie ) is the only player in Pacific 10 Conference history to record four triple-doubles . He leads the nation in assists ( about 9.5 per game ) and is averaging 16.8 points ( nearly four points higher than last season ' s average ) and 6.6 rebounds . * Little-known fact : The Golden Bears ' record is even more impressive considering that Coach Todd Bozeman has only seven scholarship players available . * Outlook : If the Golden Bears can stay out of foul trouble and not dip_into their iffy bench -- a big if -- they could reach the Final Eight . Kidd has no peer at guard and forward Lamond Murray ( 24.1-point average , 48 % shooting ) is a star in his own_right . Cal also needs contributions from swingman Monty Buckley ( 13.1 points ) and center Ryan Jamison ( 7.5 points ) . If it happens , watch_out . Kidd might get his going-away wish : a trip to the Final Four . 6 . MINNESOTA ( 20-11 ) * Player to watch : Guard Voshon Lenard is one of the 10 best guards in the country . Case closed . * Little-known fact : In the last three seasons , the Golden Gophers have won only seven Big Ten Conference road_games . And all came against Northwestern , Wisconsin or Penn State . * Outlook : We had high hopes for Minnesota , but it is obvious that the Golden Gophers are a different team when they have to pack a suitcase and go_on the road . Sure they won the NIT last year , but the first three games were at_home . The NCAA isn ' t so generous . For Minnesota to have a chance at a title run , Lenard can ' t afford a poor shooting night . Forwards Randy Carter and Chad Kolander also have to contribute in a big way . A Sweet 16 team , but the Gophers should have been better . 7 . VIRGINIA ( 17-12 ) * Player to watch : Junior forward Junior Burrough became the centerpiece to Virginia ' s offense when star guard Cory Alexander suffered an injury during the season . Without the gifted Alexander , Burrough , like the entire Cavalier team , has struggled . * Little-known fact : The Virginia roster includes senior guard Chris Havlicek , son of former Boston Celtic star John Havlicek . * Outlook : The Cavaliers were hard-pressed to earn an NCAA invitation and don ' t figure to last long . Barring the unexpected return of Alexander -- and even then , how good could he be ? -- Virginia is probably destined for one-game-and-out status . At times , an ugly team to watch . 8 . CINCINNATI ( 22-9 ) * Player to watch : Freshman Dontonio Wingfield is the obvious choice , but we ' ll pick guard Lazelle Durden . If Durden , who gives the Bearcats a perimeter game , is making his outside shots , things get much easier inside for Wingfield . * Little-known fact : Three of Cincinnati ' s starters were named to the conference ' s all-newcomer team . * Outlook : Very young , but very talented . The kind of team that is capable of an upset or two . . . or getting blown_out . The Bearcats have a problem concentrating for 40 minutes , a must in tournament play . 9 . WISCONSIN ( 17-10 ) * Player to watch : Junior forward Michael Finley and freshman center Rashard Griffith both deserve mention . Finley hasn ' t had quite the season everyone expected , but then again , everyone expected so_much after his All-Big Ten Conference selection last year . As for the 6-11 , 265-pound Griffith , he certainly doesn ' t look_like a freshman . Or play like one , either . * Little-known fact : The Badgers haven ' t been to the NCAA tournament since 1947 . * Outlook : Wisconsin enters the tournament with six losses in eight games , which is the wrong kind of momentum . But the Badgers survived a grueling Big Ten schedule and scored their share of upsets . 10 . NEW MEXICO ( 23-7 ) * Player to watch : Only 5-7 , senior point guard Greg Brown averages 19.9 points and was recently named Western Athletic Conference player of the year . Born and raised in Albuquerque , Brown has made Coach Dave Bliss a very happy man . The reason : Brown has bumped_up his scoring average more_than 10 points from last season . * Little-known fact : This is New Mexico ' s eighth consecutive 20-victory season . Only three other teams have longer streaks : North Carolina , Syracuse and Duke . * Outlook : The Lobos lead the nation in three-pointers , which makes_sense since they don ' t have much of an inside game . Maybe good for two tournament victories -- tops . 11 . SOUTHERN ILLINOIS ( 23-6 ) * Player to watch : A tough call simply because Southern Illinois is so balanced . If you had to pick someone , it would probably be guard Paul Lusk , who is averaging 15.4 points . * Little-known fact : Lusk , who transferred from Iowa , is a former roommate of Hawkeye star Chris Street , who died in an automobile accident in January of 1992 . * Outlook : Southern Illinois has five players in double figures , including Lusk and forwards Marcus Timmons and Chris Carr . Timmons is a legitimate NBA prospect . The Salukis are a strong rebounding team and have held opponents to 43.2 % shooting . But they also are prone to turnovers -- a no-no in the tournament . 12 . WISCONSIN GREEN_BAY ( 26-6 ) * Player to watch : After a so-so freshman season , Jeff Nordgaard has established himself as Green_Bay ' s first offensive choice . The sophomore forward / center averaged only six points last season , but has since increased his average to 15.3 and added 6.3 rebounds per game . In 17 of the Phoenix ' s last 20 games , Nordgaard has been the leading scorer . * Little-known fact : Since the NCAA expanded the tournament field to 64 , Wisconsin Green_Bay is the first_team to win 25 games but not receive a bid to the tournament . It happened in 1991-92 , when the Phoenix finished 25-4 . * Outlook : This isn ' t the most athletic team you ' ll ever see . But conference opponents rave about how smart the Phoenix play . Nationally ranked in team scoring defense and field-goal defense , the Phoenix make opponents work for their points . A first-round victory is unlikely . Then again , so is a blowout loss . The Phoenix play most teams tough . 13 . HAWAII ( 18-14 ) * Player to watch : Senior guard Trevor Ruffin , a streak shooter if you ever saw one . Example : After scoring only six points in the first_half of Saturday ' s victory over Brigham Young in the Western Athletic Conference tournament final , Ruffin pumped in five three-pointers . In all , he made six of 11 second-half shots . * Little-known fact : Hawaii is the first NCAA tournament entry not to come from the 48 contiguous states . * Outlook : The Rainbows played a tough nonconference schedule ( North Carolina , among others ) and have some size and a decent backcourt . The kind of team that could sneak_up on someone . BYU , which blew a 14-point lead against the Rainbows , can attest to that . 14 . BOISE STATE ( 17-12 ) * Player to watch : Senior forward Shambric Williams , a sometime starter last season , has established himself as an offensive force this season . Williams scored 27 points in the Big Sky Conference tournament final and was named the tournament ' s most_valuable_player . * Little-known fact : The Broncos lucked out big_time when conference officials named the Boise State Pavilion as site of the conference tournament . The home-court advantage helped the Broncos defeat three higher-seeded opponents as they earned the improbable NCAA bid . * Outlook : Williams can score another 27 in the first-round NCAA tournament game , but it won ' t matter . The Broncos are fortunate to be here . Alas , no more home-court advantage . 15 . LOYOLA ( Md. ) ( 17-12 ) * Player to watch : Two players are the key for Loyola ' s slim upset chances -- Michael Reese , a 6-8 senior forward who averages 20.3 points , and point guard Tracy Bergan , who averages 17.6 points and was recently named the most_valuable_player of the Metro Atlantic Conference tournament . * Little-known fact : Loyola Coach Skip Prosser , who helped Pete Gillen rebuild the Xavier program , is a graduate of the U.S. Merchant_Marine Academy -- not exactly the birthplace of college basketball_coaches . * Outlook : Dreadful . Reese is the tallest starter and Loyola lacks any sort of bulk inside . The Greyhounds shot lots of three-pointers and made 33 % . They ' ll have to do_better than that if they plan to stay close . 16 . NAVY ( 17-12 ) * Player to watch : Junior guard T.J. Hall , the only returning Navy player with backcourt experience , has become the Midshipmen ' s leading scorer , averaging 13.7 points . During Navy ' s recent seven-game winning_streak , Hall averaged 21 . * Little-known fact : After an 8-19 record last season , second-year Coach Don DeVoe has Navy back in the tournament for the first time since 1987 , when David Robinson was at Annapolis . How big of a turnaround is it ? Navy ' s last five seasons included victory totals of eight , six , eight , five and six . * Outlook : Navy , which has won 12 of its last 14 games , has 10 players who average five points or more . The Midshipmen out-rebound opponents by five per game and feature the No . 1 defense in the Patriot League . Of course , it is the Patriot League we ' re talking_about . Still , DeVoe and Navy deserve a round of polite applause before their first-round loss .</TEXT>
