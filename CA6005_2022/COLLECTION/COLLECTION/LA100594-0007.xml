   <HEADLINE> ICON OF AN IDEALIZED PAST ; HARRIET NELSON ' S DEATH IS A REMINDER OF MODERN FAMILY PLIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet , &quot; the popular old television_show , portrayed the ideal family of the 1950s . The death this week of the highly respected Harriet Nelson provides a sad reminder of the fading of the traditional two-parent family . Of course the show , as its late co-star herself often emphasized , was intended as entertainment , not as a documentary on American family life . But her death reminds us anew that the two-parent family is close to becoming the exception rather than the rule . Barely a majority of American children , only 50.8 % , now live_in a nuclear_family -- and that figure is expected to fall further unless some dramatic and fundamental change can be achieved . Unwed mothers get much of the blame in political rhetoric and bear most of the stigma . Divorce , however , is also a major contributor . William J . Bennett , a writer , a conservative and a former federal drug czar , recently pointed_out the lack of stigma attached_to wealthy , older_men leaving their first wives and children for a younger wife . Bennett , speaking last month to a convention of the religious right , argued that the damage of divorce is worse than the damage that some Christian fundamentalists have attributed to homosexuality . Marital breakups ( the majority of U.S. marriages don ' t last ) sometimes are benign ; some are actually in the best interest of the children . However , many divorces push families into poverty . And though children raised by single parents often excel , statistically they are more likely to drop_out of school , have trouble finding work and to become single parents themselves . In real_life , Harriet Nelson ' s parents separated . The &quot; good old days &quot; weren ' t good for everyone . But 40 years ago most children lived with both parents , like in &quot; Ozzie and Harriet. &quot; Times , alas , are changing .</TEXT>
