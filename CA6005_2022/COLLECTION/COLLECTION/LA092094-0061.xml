   <TEXT> The pendulum of power is swinging again in Latin_America . No , the generals are not coming_back . The political pendulum of the 1990s moves between civilians -- insiders and outsiders . Just a_few years ago , the label of political insider could be a serious handicap for a Latin_American presidential candidate . Electorates in many countries seemed disillusioned , even disgusted , with politicians from parties that had inhabited the halls of power . Outsiders and newcomers were_on the rise . They challenged insiders with surprising new strength , and they won the presidencies of Brazil and Peru . A major reason was economics , said Peter Cleaves , director of the Institute for Latin_American Studies at the University of Texas . &quot; Latin_America went_through enormous economic changes_over the last 15 years , &quot; he pointed_out , &quot; and just at the time when the economic_crisis seemed deepest , and the population had the least respect for the political_system , you had an opportunity for a lot of outsiders to come in. &quot; But lately it has been the other way around . As a series of elections puts the region ' s politicians through their paces , insiders , standard-bearers of the political Establishment , are claiming victory in country after country . &quot; Now the economic situation is picking_up a bit , &quot; Cleaves said . &quot; The incumbents and those who sort of promise stability are going_to do better. &quot; Stronger and increasingly well-organized party systems also favor insiders in many Latin countries , analysts say . A prime example is Chilean President Eduardo Frei , who was elected by a landslide and took_office March 11 . Frei is this country ' s second Christian Democratic president in a row , a former senator and party chairman . He also is an insider by heredity , having lived_in La Moneda , the presidential palace , when his father was Chile ' s chief_executive in the 1960s . A Christian Democratic alliance with the Socialists was a key to Frei ' s victory . &quot; The Chilean case is the consolidation of a political_system and a party system , &quot; said Manuel Antonio Garreton , a political_scientist with the University of Chile . Presidents inaugurated this year in Colombia , Costa Rica , the Dominican_Republic , El_Salvador , Honduras and Panama are also vested insiders from parties in power or ones that had held power in recent years . Presidents with similar Establishment credentials took_office last year in Bolivia and Paraguay . On Dec . 1 , President-elect Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico ' s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party will take_over in Mexico . &quot; El PRI &quot; has been ushering its insiders into the presidency without a break for 65 years . Political analysts say Mexicans want political and social reform but have opted for change from within , fearing an outsider might bring disarray . Zedillo , a former budget minister , belongs_to a new generation of party insiders who stand_for moderate reform . Although he won with the lowest majority ever tallied by the ruling party , 48.7 % of the votes , his ballots almost doubled those of outsider Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , the rightist runner-up . And insiders are now favored to win other Latin_American elections in the coming months : * In Brazil , Fernando Henrique Cardoso , a former Senate leader and Cabinet_minister , is expected to finish ahead of outsider Luis Inacio ( Lula ) da Silva , a leftist former labor_leader , in the first round of presidential elections Oct . 3 . Cardoso ' s Brazilian Social Democratic Party has never produced a president , but he held the posts of foreign_minister and finance_minister in the current Brazilian administration , and his rivals for the presidency call him &quot; the government ' s candidate &quot; and &quot; the official candidate. &quot; Economics has been the key to Cardoso ' s success in opinion polls . As finance_minister , he pushed_through an economic reform plan that has reduced inflation from an alarming monthly rate of more_than 45 % in June to less than 2 % in August . * In Uruguay , former President Julio Sanguinetti of the Colorado Party is widely seen as the likely winner in presidential balloting scheduled for Nov . 27 . The Colorados and the now-governing Blancos , or National Party , are Uruguay ' s traditional insiders . In 1989 , when many Latin_American outsiders were_on the rise , Tabare Vazquez won election as mayor of Montevideo , the national_capital and home of more_than one-third of all Uruguayans . But this year , Vazquez and his outsider coalition of leftists and Blanco dissidents are lagging behind Sanguinetti and the Colorados in polls . * Alberto Fujimori , the former outsider who won Peru ' s presidency in 1990 , is now the No . 1 insider and the favored candidate for April elections . Fujimori gained in popularity in 1992 when , backed by the army , he suspended the constitution and shut_down the Congress , which was dominated by old-line insiders who opposed him . A new , pro-Fujimori Congress was elected later in 1992 . Fujimori ' s main rival so far for the 1995 contest is Javier Perez de Cuellar , who is well-known as a former secretary_general of the United Nations but is an outsider to Peruvian politics . * Argentina ' s flamboyant Carlos Saul Menem is favored to win a second term in May elections , thanks to a recent constitutional reform that eliminated a ban on reelection . Menem is the leader of the Peronist Party , founded by the late President Juan D . Peron in the late 1940s . Menem and Fujimori took_office amid tidal_waves of hyper-inflation , and both have tamed spiraling prices with drastic cuts_in government spending , privatization of state-owned enterprises and other policies favoring a free market . Their policies have brought brisk economic_growth but also increased unemployment and hardship for their countries ' poorest people . Like Menem ' s supporters , Fujimori ' s have pushed_through a constitutional amendment that allows his reelection . In most Latin_American countries , constitutions prohibit the immediate reelection of a president -- a provision aimed at keeping insiders from becoming too entrenched in power . The military coup has been the other notable way of removing Latin_American insiders from power . Then , in the 1980s , the pendulum made an almost complete swing to democracy -- and there it has stayed , with the notable exceptions of Cuba and Haiti . But at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s , civilian insiders seemed vulnerable in many Latin_American countries . Debt crisis , recession and high inflation had beleaguered the region during most of the 1980s , dubbed Latin_America ' s &quot; Lost Decade. &quot; Relief from economic problems seemed slow in coming , and official corruption began cropping_up . Voters almost everywhere were open_to leadership from sectors outside old-line political elites and main-line party machines . In the past , leftist movements might have been an alternative to traditional parties in Latin_America , but the collapse of international communism and democratic gains around the world discredited revolutionaries and militarists alike . It was as if there were a vacuum waiting for outside forces to fill . Fernando Collor de Mello , a telegenic but obscure politician from one of Brazil ' s smallest states , started the outsider trend , launching a campaign for the presidency with a newly created party that had no national structure . He lashed_out at political insiders , promising a new era of clean and efficient government . The message caught_on , and Collor rose from obscurity to victory , beating another outsider , Lula da Silva , in a runoff vote . Then , in 1990 , the even more obscure Fujimori repeated the feat in Peru . Outsiders , it seemed , were_on a roll . On the eve of his runoff victory , Fujimori told The Times : &quot; If I win and am successful , this will be contagious for all_of Latin America. &quot; Although the pendulum never made a full swing across the region , the trend toward outsiders looked strong for a while . Mexico ' s Cuauhtemoc Cardenas with his new Democratic Revolutionary Party had become a powerful force , as was television talk-show host Carlos Palenque and his new party in Bolivia . Other outsiders were emerging by winning races for mayor in such important cities as Montevideo ; Lima , Peru ; and Sao Paulo , Brazil . Skillful use of television helped them . TV was an increasingly effective vehicle for political mobilization in Latin_America . In many cases , voting for an outsider was less a vote of faith or allegiance than a &quot; punishment vote &quot; against political elites or a desperate gamble on someone new . In Brazil , the voters lost their bet_on Collor . Little more_than two years after his election , a Congress dominated by political insiders impeached him on charges of corruption . Now , as economic_conditions across the region improve , voters seem more inclined to stick_with familiar politicians than to take_a_chance on new ones . Since mid-1993 , insiders have taken_office in these countries : Bolivia -- Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada , a former planning minister who led the conquest of Bolivian hyper-inflation in the mid-1980s , assumed his country ' s presidency in August , 1993 . He belongs_to the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement , which has held power several times . Paraguay -- Juan Carlos Wasmosy took_office in August , 1993 . A former Cabinet_minister , he is the country ' s first civilian president in four decades and a member of the Colorado Party , which supported military President Alfredo Stroessner until the general was deposed in a 1989 coup . Honduras -- President Carlos Roberto Reina was inaugurated in January . Reina , a professional politician most of his life , comes from the social democratic wing of the Liberal_Party , which held power during most of the 1980s . Venezuela -- With the economy a shambles and corruption scandals raging last year , voters picked longtime political insider Rafael Caldera as president . Caldera , inaugurated Feb . 2 , ran as an independent and beat candidates of Venezuela ' s two main old-line parties . But as a former leader of one of those parties , the Social Christians , and as a former president and senator , he also has solid old-line credentials . Costa Rica -- Jose Maria Figueres became president on May 8 . Like Chile ' s Frei , Figueres is the son and namesake of a former president . El_Salvador -- Armando Calderon Sol took_office June 1 . Calderon Sol is a member of the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance , or Arena , the party in power when he was elected . Colombia -- President Ernesto Samper took_office Aug . 7 , keeping the traditional Liberal_Party in power . Dominican_Republic -- President Joaquin Balaguer , dean of the region ' s elected insiders , took the oath of office Aug . 16 for his seventh presidential_term . Balaguer , 87 and now blind , has governed his Caribbean nation for 20 of the last 28 years . But his victory this year , tainted with fraud charges , was a narrow one -- possibly because of persistent economic problems . Panama -- Ernesto Perez Balladares took_office Sept . 1 . He was an aide to the late Panamanian strongman , Gen . Omar Torrijos , and his party has dominated Panamanian politics in recent decades . Perez ' s Democratic Revolutionary Party was the political arm of Gen . Manuel A . Noriega , the dictator ousted from power by the U.S. military invasion of Panama in 1989 . Noriega is now serving time in the United States for drug trafficking . Perez , who was temporarily jailed by the Americans after the invasion , is accompanied in government by some of Noriega ' s staunchest cronies . Many insiders now holding office are leaders of a new generation within established parties . Figueres in Costa Rica took_office at age 39 , Calderon Sol in El_Salvador at 45 , Perez in Panama at 48 , and Samper in Colombia at 43 . Zedillo in Mexico is 42 and will be his country ' s youngest president this century . Most promise change and reform , and to some extent , all_of them advocate free-market , lean-government policies . Said Mark B . Rosenberg , a Latin_America specialist at Florida International University in Miami : &quot; I think it ' s now common wisdom that countries only have one option , and that is to open their economies and be competitive in the global commercial environment . And they ' re all trying to find ways in which they can attract foreign investors . And heck , in the old days , that was anathema. &quot; Insiders * Fernando Henrique Cardoso Presidential candidate in Brazil Age : 63 Marital status : Married Past offices : National senator , 1983-92 Government leader in Senate , 1985-86 Foreign minister , 1992-93 Finance_minister , 1993-94 &quot; I can provide continuity because I already have been an integral part of the government . I know the programs , I don ' t have to stop , I can advance. &quot; * Alberto Fujimori President of Peru Age : 56 Marital status : Separated Past offices : Rector ( president ) of the National Agrarian University , 1984-1988 President , 1990-present &quot; The answer , as always , is more schools , more health centers , more roads , more of everything for the Peruvian people. &quot; * Eduardo Frei President of Chile Age : 52 Marital status : Married Past offices : National senator , 1990-1993 President of Christian Democratic Party &quot; I believe one of the reasons I received that tremendous vote was that I was very loyal to my government during the term of President ( Patricio ) Aylwin. &quot;</TEXT>
