   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY SCHOOLS TO GET FULL TAX SHARE ; FINANCES : LEVIES ON PROPERTY WERE COLLECTED AFTER THE BANKRUPTCY FILING . NONPROFIT GROUPS ALSO GET GOOD NEWS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Orange County Board of Supervisors on Sunday told school officials -- many who feared they could not make their first post-Christmas payroll -- that they can have their full share of the millions in property_taxes collected after the county filed for bankruptcy nearly two weeks ago . And in a separate action by the county ' s new bankruptcy management council , more_than 100 nonprofit groups will get $ 2.9 million to cover the services they provided before funds in the county investment pool were frozen Dec . 6 . As supervisors moved Sunday to repair the financial damage caused by the nation ' s largest municipal bankruptcy case , state auditors sought to determine whether former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron criminally violated laws governing trust_accounts . State Auditor Kurt Sjoberg said that attorneys from his office are looking_at whether the agreements that Citron established with certain investors constituted trusts , and whether he dipped_into some trust_accounts to satisfy the needs of other investors . A finding by state auditors that trust agreements existed with investors could not only leave Citron open_to possible criminal prosecution , but also further financially cripple the county . The investors found to have trust agreements might be entitled to be paid in full , leaving the county and other government_agencies to bear the brunt of county investment fund losses now estimated at more_than $ 2 billion . The trust agreements also may specifically limit how investors ' funds can be used . &quot; Clearly we will be looking_to assure ourselves that local and state regulations were being followed , &quot; said Sjoberg , who is reviewing Citron ' s books from June 30 forward at the request of Gov . Pete Wilson . Chief_Assistant Dist . Atty . Maury Evans would not confirm whether his office was investigating Citron ' s handling of the trust_accounts . &quot; We have an ongoing review going_on and we ' re working with a number of agencies , both state and local , &quot; he said . Separate Account The best news Sunday came for county schools , when the five supervisors set_up an account_for schools separate within the beleaguered county pool . Both the recent property_taxes and about $ 50 million that the state is scheduled to turn_over at month ' s end will be deposited in the account . The school fund will be invested in conservative investments , officials said . The schools ' separate account &quot; will alleviate any concerns the state has that the ( schools ' ) money might get tied_up in bankruptcy , &quot; said Ronald D . Wenkart , general counsel for the Orange County Department_of_Education . The supervisors ' action Sunday allows county school districts , many of which said they might not be able to operate past March without new funds , to breathe a little easier . Under the agreement , school districts will receive their portion of property_taxes that were paid after Dec . 6 , when Orange County filed for protection under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code . Saddleback Valley Unified School District Supt . Peter A . Hartman described the action as a &quot; very positive step , &quot; but just one of many needed to help school districts operate for the rest of the year . &quot; It ' s taken longer than we hoped , but I ' m glad it ' s done , &quot; he said . &quot; This will give us some breathing room for the next month or two. &quot; The district , one of the county ' s biggest , will receive about $ 20 million in recent property_tax payments , about 40 % to 50 % of what it expects to receive for the year , Hartman said . That money will be used to help the district pay its employees at least through February , he said . The action also was necessary to calm the worries of state school officials that state money sent to the county would not be used solely for education . &quot; I think this is very good news , to know that schools can expect this post-petition money , &quot; Wenkart said . But Wenkart stressed that Sunday ' s agreement does not free up money that schools deposited in the county fund before bankruptcy was filed . And Wenkart couldn ' t say how much money the schools can now expect . Sunday ' s agreement simply guarantees that schools will be able to meet their immediate financial_obligations , by ensuring that they will be able to write checks on an account that isn ' t embroiled in bankruptcy proceedings , he said . &quot; This agreement doesn ' t involve a specific amount_of_money , it involves the flow of money , &quot; said Wenkart , adding that schools still expect to get 100 % of their pre-petition money out of the investment fund . &quot; What I would say to parents of schoolchildren in Orange County is that this is a good first_step , &quot; Wenkart said . &quot; Now we have to work_on getting more money. &quot; Nonprofit Groups The county ' s relief agencies were themselves relieved Sunday as news spread that the emergency council coping_with Orange County ' s crisis had authorized payments to 108 desperate nonprofit groups . At Hope House , a long-term , 40-bed residential drug treatment program in Anaheim , the news lent a bit of extra cheer to an annual potluck Christmas dinner . At Phoenix House in Santa Ana , another substance_abuse treatment program , a senior counselor could only say , &quot; Whoopee ! &quot; &quot; It ' ll help us survive , &quot; said Marc Corradini , executive_director of Hope House . He said his agency would have run_out of money in February , so Sunday ' s news was not a last-minute reprieve , but something very close . Residents at the treatment center were aware of the crisis , Corradini said . &quot; They know what ' s going_on and they were reading the papers and asking me , so I pretty much let them know what our status was. &quot; Corradini said he was determined that the center would not close its doors , especially not for want of $ 5 # 000 . &quot; We literally were turning_out lights in our therapy room and trying to get food donated because there ' s not much fat in our budget , &quot; he said . &quot; Today , we ' re having a potluck celebration . Families brought_in ( food ) to celebrate Christmas . So ( the news ) comes at a very nice time. &quot; But Supervisor William G . Steiner warned the county ' s nonprofit agencies , most of which rely_on county funds , that they may_not be able to count_on public money in the future . The county will pay_for bills it already has received from the groups , but future bills face more delays and uncertainty , said Steiner , the former director of Orange County ' s home for abused and neglected children . &quot; I was alarmed at how many depend_on public funds , &quot; Steiner said . &quot; This means , of course , that they ' re at greatest risk of their programs being jeopardized , in contrast to those agencies . . . that are primarily relying_on private donations. &quot; Trust Agreements While the schools and relief agencies celebrated their bit of extra cash , the state auditor ' s office was trying to sort_out what their status was in the county pool . Auditor Sjoberg said his office is looking_to determine whether investors -- such_as school districts that are required by law to invest in the county -- had , in_essence , trust agreements with Citron . The auditors are also scrutinizing whether these agreements detailed how their money could be used . Sjoberg said auditors will be looking_to see whether Citron violated trust agreements by using some investors ' money to pay_off other obligations . Sjoberg said that if a trust_fund was established by a specific agreement or contract or by government statute , Citron &quot; could not dip_into those funds for any purpose than what ' s spelled_out in the trust agreement. &quot; The auditor ' s legal department also is attempting to determine what the potential penalties would be for the violations of a trust agreement , he said . The trust_fund provision states that &quot; when any public entity or public official . . . who is required or authorized by law to deposit funds into a county treasury makes a deposit , those funds shall be deemed to be held_in trust . . . these funds shall not be deemed funds or assets of the county. &quot; If investors ' funds are found to be trusts , the county would be required to repay investing agencies in full before withdrawing any money for itself . That argument is already being made forcefully by school district_attorneys , individuals who invested court settlements at the encouragement of local judges , and some government_agencies that say they had received assurances and documentation from Citron that their money would be invested separately and more conservatively . On Friday , U.S. Trustee Marcy J . K . Tiffany , who is overseeing the case for federal Bankruptcy Court , dismissed the idea of investors recovering their money from the fund first as &quot; shortsighted &quot; and not supported by the law . &quot; It ' s like choking yourself with your own hand , &quot; she said . If all other investors were repaid in full , the county could lose about three-quarters of the nearly $ 3 billion it has tied_up in the fund . Some investors have said they have letters from Citron indicating that their funds were protected from risky investments and kept_in a &quot; bond pool &quot; separate from the commingled county investment pool . But Bruce Bennett , the county ' s bankruptcy attorney , said Saturday that it remains unclear whether funds in the pool were kept_in separate accounts earning different returns . Bennett said he had discovered conflicting records about whether Citron -- who resigned two weeks ago -- kept segregated accounts_for some of the 187 cities , school districts and other agencies that had money in the county ' s investment pool . Sjoberg said the auditors would be looking_at the letters that investors received from Citron &quot; to see whether they create a contractual agreement or trust agreement. &quot; News that state auditors were looking_into the issue of trusts and whether Citron handled them properly was greeted with enthusiasm by the fund ' s investors Sunday . &quot; All investors , especially those school districts who were assured their investment was risk-free , have to certainly welcome the state auditor ' s investigation , &quot; said Peer Swan , chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District . Swan said he had never heard that Citron juggled investors ' funds to meet other obligations , but he said , &quot; I think we will all be very curious about that. &quot; Times staff writer Anna Cekola contributed to this story . * BANKRUPTCY COVERAGE : Related Orange County stories inside .
