   <HEADLINE> LEAD POISONING : A REAL OR HYPED-UP DANGER ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I take offense at the March 20 childhood lead-poisoning article ( &quot; Old Paint Young Victims &quot; by Stephanie O ' Neill ) . Occupying 80 % of the page is an inflated article complete with a picture of mom and daughter , stricken by lead_poisoning . Your article is an example of good / bad reporting . Your mission is to educate your readers to the dangers of lead_poisoning but it is done out of proportion to its danger , especially in California . For example , your headline says &quot; An estimated 3 million children in the U.S. suffer from lead contamination. &quot; Yet later in your article you report 700 cases of childhood lead_poisoning statewide in 1993 , and only 12 % of those cases were considered &quot; medical emergencies. &quot; that ' s 84 out of a total statewide population of over 28 million people ! Using specific heartfelt cases of individuals suffering the contamination is common journalistic practice , but it can also result in a prejudiced communication . It wasn ' t until I read the smaller companion article ( &quot; Should You Test Your Child ? &quot; ) that a reality check was done . Three doctors point_out resources are_better spent elsewhere than by testing for elevated blood levels . It would have been more responsible journalism to incorporate these doctors ' observations within the lead article in the interest of balance . PHYLLIS MUELLER Pasadena * In her article , O ' Neill writes &quot; . . . there are no government loan programs or other financial assistance aimed specifically at private lead abatement work. &quot; True for now . However , there is a campaign sponsored by the Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning and the Environmental Defense Fund to push House Resolution 2479 , which would impose a &quot; polluter pays &quot; excise_tax on the lead industry . This legislation would provide an additional $ 1 billion dollars to local_governments to help improve the health and well being of local communities , creating tens of thousands of high-skilled jobs without raiding other federal programs , or raising the deficit . JOHN J . CURRAN El Segundo * I would like to thank The Times for addressing such an important issue as childhood lead_poisoning caused by lead-based paint . This is a disease that affects one in six children , resulting in slower cognitive development , lower IQ scores , deafness and in some cases mental_retardation . Lead poisoning is considered to be the No . 1 environmental health hazard to children , while at_the_same_time , it is the most preventable . Yet , and this is extremely disturbing , there is no existing government financial_aid targeted at lead abatement programs . Our children are our future , and the moral_obligation to deal with problems affecting children rests with us . Please call 1-800-LEAD-FYI to learn more about childhood lead_poisoning .
