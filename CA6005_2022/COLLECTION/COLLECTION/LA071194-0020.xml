Samsonite Corp . and Besicorp Group Inc. have teamed_up to produce a briefcase equipped with a solar_panel that can collect solar_energy for such electronic goods . The luggage manufacturer and the alternative-energy company announced a joint_venture in which Sun Wize Energy Systems Inc. , a subsidiary of Besicorp. , will manufacture the battery panels and Samsonite will install them in its briefcases . The panel unit will be about the height and width of a standard sheet_of_paper and as thick as two credit_cards . The panel , which is featherweight , can pool energy from direct sunlight or indirect artificial lighting . A universal plug , similar to the attachment that can tap battery power through a car ' s cigarette lighter , will transfer the collected energy to cellular_phones , laptops and other electronic gear , according to a Samsonite spokesman . The solar briefcase should be_on the market by the spring of 1995 , he said .</TEXT>
