   <HEADLINE> TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS : INSIGHT ; THERE ' S OPPORTUNITY FOR U.S. AS LATIN TRADE_BARRIERS FALL AWAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With crucial votes scheduled in Congress this week on the GATT world trade agreement , Capitol_Hill ' s new Republican leaders -- emboldened by their election victory -- are sounding more and more like their predecessors of the late 1940s . Then , as now , a Republican Congress faced an unpopular Democratic President . Then , as now , long and arduous negotiations had led to the signing of an ambitious world agreement that would slash barriers to trade_in goods and services , promote international investment and safeguard intellectual property_rights . Then , as now , the agreement called_for international arbitration procedures with real teeth . And then , as now , a coalition of conservative Democrats and Republicans rallied against any abdication of American sovereignty , providing a useful flag in which to wrap special_interests clamoring for protection . In 1950 , President Harry S . Truman gave_in to the conservative coalition , dropping the Havana Charter and its promise of a new international trade organization . This week , by contrast , President Clinton seems likely to win approval of GATT . The price for incoming Senate Majority_Leader Bob Dole ' s support : Creation of a judicial panel empowered to monitor decisions taken by the new_World Trade Organization ( scheduled to replace the GATT on Jan . 1 ) and recommend withdrawal if it rules too often against U.S. interests . In reality , the Democratic President is simply picking_up where Republicans left_off in pursuing free_trade . Fresh from his success in Indonesia , where the President won a commitment from the nations of the Pacific Basin to eliminate trade_barriers by 2020 , Clinton heads in two weeks to Miami for a summit with Latin_American heads_of_state . There , the United States will face increasing pressure to make_good on President George_Bush ' s promise of a free_trade zone stretching from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego . The region ' s transformation has been startling since the debt crisis of 1982 and the subsequent collapse in living standards and business_activity . * The old order of_import protection and government-led industrialization has fallen_away . In its place came a new order characterized by fiscal discipline , falling trade_barriers ( tariff rates dropped from an average of nearly 50 % in 1985 to about 15 % by 1992 ) , big privatizations and deregulation of foreign_exchange markets and direct foreign investment . The results have been dramatic . Chile , which led the process under Gen . Augusto Pinochet ' s regime , has experienced sustained growth of more_than 6 % in recent years , with inflation down to single digits by 1994 . The successful transition to democracy has added new vigor to the economy and to the stock_market . President Carlos Menem ' s government in Argentina overcame a history of ineffective reforms and saw inflation reduced from 5 # 000 % in 1989 to 4 % this year . Growth has been dynamic , exceeding 8 % in the first_half of 1994 . * Brazil has had seven finance_ministers , three currencies and two economic shock_treatments in the last four years . But now , with the imposition of the &quot; real &quot; plan and the election of its author , Fernando Cardoso , to the presidency , the country seems poised to fulfill its role as the engine of Latin_American growth . Inflation dropped from more_than 50 % in June to less than 1 % in September . Economic growth is expected to boom to the 7 % to 8 % range for the rest of the decade . There are , of course , exceptions . Venezuela represents the worst-case scenario . After a short-lived reform process , the country is now retreating under the leadership of a populist government modeled after the old order . A severe banking crisis has caused the government to reinstate exchange controls and increase the public deficit to more_than 18 % of gross_domestic_product . Still , the prospects for the region have not been brighter in decades . Improvements in productivity augur well for the competitiveness of local industries , particularly in sectors such_as steel , automobiles and mining . And a spate of regional free_trade pacts has added fuel and discipline to the liberalization process : * Following the signing of NAFTA , Mexico has joined in bilateral free-trade agreements with Chile and Costa Rica . Two-way trade between Colombia and Venezuela has doubled since they signed a customs agreement in 1992 . And in June of this year , the two joined Mexico to form the &quot; G-3 &quot; duty-free area , pledging to liberalize most trade among them . * After languishing in the 1980s , the Andean Pact -- linking Colombia , Venezuela , Ecuador , Peru and Bolivia -- has markedly lowered barriers to trade and investment in the last five years . Beginning in January , it will become a common tariff and customs union , providing uniform treatment to all foreign investors . * Since Brazil , Argentina , Paraguay and Uruguay created the Mercosur free_trade area in 1991 , their internal trade has nearly tripled to about $ 12 billion this year . By Jan . 1 , this group , too , will enter into a customs union with common external tariffs and a renewed commitment to integration into the world economy . * All of this is good news for American business . U.S. exports to the region have more_than doubled since 1987 , to more_than $ 80 billion last year . And U.S. firms have been_active in investing in these growth markets , pouring in more_than $ 25 billion in the last five years . It would be a great shame if a new provincialism in Washington means that all this progress is met with an excessively cautious approach in Miami next month .</TEXT>
