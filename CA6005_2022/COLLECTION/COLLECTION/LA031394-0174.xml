   <HEADLINE> LAGUNA HILLS TIES FOR 2ND IN ACADEMIC QUIZ</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Their team includes a baseball pitcher , a volleyball_player , a_few basketball hotshots , a wrestler and an offensive tackle . It ' s the Laguna Hills High_School academic decathlon team . Wait , aren ' t these the kids who are supposed to read all day and do calculus in their sleep ? Team member Jamie Miller -- known as &quot; Piggy &quot; to his soccer teammates -- thinks otherwise . &quot; We ' re not some nerds , &quot; Miller said . Make no mistake about it , though . The Laguna Hills team wins and wins often . Team members take their decathlons very seriously , studying until the last minute with flash_cards and skipping social_activities that draw other teams . Saturday , after months of preparation , they tied for second place in the Super Quiz portion of the California Academic Decathlon in Stockton , a game show-style contest held_in front of rows of cheering parents and friends . Laguna Hills ' squad tied with Sacramento County ' s Bella Vista High_School at the Super Quiz , which was held at the University of the Pacific ' s basketball arena . It was the last event of the two-day competition , and the only event open_to the public . Taft High_School of Woodland Hills and West High_School of Torrance tied for first place , scoring 5 # 400 points_out of a possible 6 # 000 . Laguna Hills , representing Orange County , scored 4 # 900 . The Super Quiz accounts_for only 10 % of the competition ' s total points , so coaches were optimistic the Laguna Hills team may still win the overall title . &quot; We ' re still in the hunt , &quot; said Kathy Lane , who coaches the Laguna Hills Hawks with fellow English_teacher Roger Gunderson . The event ' s organizers will announce winners of individual and team medals today . The Laguna Hills team began the competition against 378 students from 42 other teams Friday . After nervously cramming all week , contestants took exams in six areas : mathematics , science , social_science , economics , languages and literature , and fine_arts . Contestants were quizzed on this year ' s topic , &quot; The Documents of Freedom , &quot; 19 historical texts ranging from the Mayflower Compact to the 1978 Camp David Accord between Israel and Egypt . Each academic decathlon team is divided evenly among students with A , B and C grade-point averages . The Laguna Hills team members are Miller , Genevieve Go , Alex Fung , Romy Christensen , Bryan Cotta , Megan Ferrell , Terry James , Loren Colin and Renn Amstead . All are seniors . Under a clear sky and hot sun outside the pavilion before the Super Quiz on Saturday , team members said they felt relieved to be so close to the end of a competition that they have anticipated since last summer . &quot; I just want it to be over ! &quot; Cotta said . In December , the Laguna Hills team beat 47 other squads to win the Orange County competition and advance to the state contest in Stockton . Taft High , an academic powerhouse that in 1993 won the statewide crown and took second place in the national contest , is the favorite to win here . Taft has won its district title four times and has gone undefeated in its three trips to the state finals . The Laguna Hills team took the state title in 1990 and 1991 . The school has represented Orange County in the state competition every year for the past six years . Laguna Hills High Assistant Principal Kary Bemoll said competition is fierce just to land a spot on the school ' s decathlon team . &quot; There are a lot of kids that try_out and don ' t make_it , &quot; she said . Fung , for one , tried_out annually since his freshman year before making the team this year , Bemoll said . The California Academic Decathlon originated 14 years ago as an outgrowth of an Orange County competition . Former Orange County Supt . of Schools Robert Peterson created the contest in the 1970s as a way to encourage students to study a variety of subjects . The competition is sponsored by a nonprofit organization funded by corporate donations . James , a stocky senior , plays offensive tackle for the varsity football_team . Last December , he had to compete in a California Interscholastic Federation conference playoff_game the night before the county academic decathlon championships -- and still pulled_through on his tests , his coaches said . Amstead is_on the wrestling team , and Christensen participates in basketball , softball and volleyball . Miller , who pitches for the baseball_team , said he studies to the sounds of &quot; punk music. &quot; Team captain Ferrell wields an intimidating decathlon pedigree . Her older brother , Jeff , a member of Laguna Hills ' team the last time the school carried home the state title , notched the highest individual score in last year ' s state finals . Gunderson called Ferrell &quot; a selfless leader &quot; who helped other teammates improve their scores . As quickly as they sat_down Friday night for dinner , the coaches and the team rose to rush back to the Holiday Inn where they were staying to prepare again for the next day ' s competition . While other teams attended an ice-cream social that night to meet and exchange gifts , the Hawks practiced speeches and studied flash_cards to prepare_for the Super Quiz . &quot; We came_to win , &quot; coach Lane explained . Laguna Hills ' hard-nosed rival to the north , Taft , also skipped the party . Hawk team members said they take winning very seriously . They began putting_together study packets last summer for the rest of the team , Colin said , and they met after school and on weekends for about 20 hours a week before the competition . Ferrell ' s parents hosted the students at their home for numerous weekend and after-school study sessions . They said they were pleased with the team ' s performance Saturday and with the competition ' s importance to their children . &quot; I ' d rather have my kids go_through four years of ( the Orange County Academic Decathlon ) than go_to class , &quot; said Todd Ferrell , Megan ' s father .
