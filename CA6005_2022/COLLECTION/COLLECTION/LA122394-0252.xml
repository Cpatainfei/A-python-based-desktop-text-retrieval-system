   <HEADLINE> NAVAL NEST ; STATION AN IMPORTANT SANCTUARY FOR BIRDS OF PREY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The bait was set . A small wire cage containing a mouse and a sparrow sat in a field , easily seen by any of the sharp-eyed red-tailed_hawks in a nearby grove of eucalyptus_trees . Within 20 minutes , one of the large birds swooped in_for a late breakfast and was snared . An elated biologist , Pete Bloom , had one more startled young_bird to measure , weigh and hold firmly , carefully avoiding its sharp talons while he wrapped an aluminum identification band around its leg . It was the 116th red-tailed_hawk that Bloom had banded and the 221st he had counted this season at the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station . Bloom , who is under contract with the Navy to identify and count all birds_of_prey that utilize the 5 # 000 acres of marsh and uplands , works even after sunset , searching the night skies and fields with spotlights for owls . The survey is part of a joint effort by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Navy to protect and enhance wildlife in the undeveloped part of the military facility . Besides warehousing weapons , the site is an important winter destination and rest stop for southbound birds_of_prey along their migratory flight_path between the Arctic_Circle and South_America . In recent years , biologists have aided a resurgence of endangered shorebird species at the station by controlling predators and providing a man-made island and floating nests . They also want to increase the numbers of hawks , owls and other birds_of_prey that hunt in the station ' s expansive uplands that shoulder the marsh . Off-limits to the public and protected from development , Bloom said the large expanse of open space at the station is &quot; an incredibly significant resource that supports several species of raptors that are almost absent in the rest of Orange County. &quot; And it is increasingly essential to migratory birds , he added , as other wetlands and open spaces fall to development along the western coast of North_America . &quot; Birds that are migrating south along the Pacific Flyway have no safe place to land and catch a meal in the 30 miles between the Santa Monica Mountains and Seal Beach , &quot; Bloom said . &quot; The most important aspect of the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station is that it is protected and will remain a sanctuary. &quot; Bloom said one of his most surprising findings is that the uplands provide a winter home to the highest density of red-tailed_hawks in North_America . The booming population of red-tailed_hawks reflects an exceptional breeding year for the birds throughout California , Oregon and Washington . The hawks , 90 % of which were fledged last spring , are attracted to the base , Bloom said , by an abundance of ground_squirrels and gophers that inhabit the burrow-pocked fields and offer good eating . Bloom has found 20 species of birds_of_prey on the base , including eight pairs of burrowing owls , a once-common inhabitant of Orange County that has been decimated outside the Naval Weapons Station by development . &quot; This is where they are making their last stand , &quot; Bloom said . In the winter , the base is visited by a growing number of peregrine_falcons , a bird_of_prey on the federal and state endangered species list . This fall and winter Bloom expects that at least 100 peregrines will stop at the base on their winter migration to feast on smaller shorebirds . The peregrine population is starting to rebound nationwide because of a reduction in the use of agricultural pesticides and because of successful breeding efforts , Bloom said . While birds_of_prey inhabit the uplands , the marsh is filled with shorebirds and water fowl , including large flocks of Canada_geese . The geese drop_in this time_of_year to feed_on leftover lima_beans from harvests on nearby fields that the Navy leases to farmers . In all , 155 bird species use the Navy station , said Rodd Kelsey , a biologist who works for the Navy and oversees protection of wildlife on the base . Among his challenges , he said , is dealing with barn owls that raise their young inside some of the storage buildings . Another of Kelsey ' s responsibilities , he said , is making certain that those who farm on the base do not endanger the birds by using pesticides or by exterminating rodents that the birds depend_on for their diet . * Credit for a significant local comeback of two bird species , the California least tern and light-footed clapper rail , both of which are listed as endangered , is given to the Fish and Wildlife Service , which since 1972 has operated about 1 # 000 acres of marshland on the base as a national wildlife refuge . Although the least tern population at the station dwindled to only five in 1983 , Kelsey said last spring biologists counted 198 pairs nesting on a man-made island that is surrounded with electric fencing to protect the terns ' eggs from opossum , skunks , hawks and other predators . Michael Mitchell , a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist at the weapons station refuge , said there has been an even more dramatic rebound of light-footed clapper rails , which over the last eight years have multiplied at the refuge from 10 birds to 150 . Artificial , floating nests have been provided to encourage the birds to breed on the water -- out of the reach of skunks and opossums . Most important , Mitchell said , the Fish and Wildlife Service between 1986 and 1993 trapped and removed about 300 red_fox , a non-native species of fox with a wide-ranging appetite that had been thriving on the endangered birds at the weapons station . &quot; It is an ecosystem coming_back into order , &quot; Bloom said .</TEXT>
