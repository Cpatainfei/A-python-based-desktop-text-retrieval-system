   <HEADLINE> SMALL FISH MAY PLAY BIG ROLE IN FATE OF LAGOON ; ENVIRONMENT : ACTIVISTS PREDICT THE GOBY ' S INCLUSION ON ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST WILL PROVIDE IMPETUS TO CLEAN_UP THE WATER NEAR MALIBU CREEK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is a tiny , unremarkable fish that feeds off microorganisms at the bottom of estuaries . But the unsung goby , environmentalists predict , just might provide the impetus for a solution to the decade-long controversy over how to clean_up and restore Malibu Lagoon . In the month since the goby was added_to the federal endangered species list , residents , surfers , environmentalists and government_agencies have been waiting to see how the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife plans to ensure the survival of the two-inch-long fish , which lives and breeds in the brackish , polluted lagoon . To maintain the goby ' s habitat , the state_Department of Parks and Recreation is expected to adopt the Fish and Wildlife Department ' s guidelines . The plan is expected to call_for strict regulation of mechanical breaching of a sandy berm that separates the lagoon from the ocean . State parks department employees bulldoze sections of the berm when the lagoon water reaches the brim so that septic_tanks that feed into the lagoon do not back_up . * But breaching the berm can harm the goby because the practice upsets the balance of salt and fresh_water in the lagoon . The guidelines , due in a_few months , probably won ' t include recommendations to eliminate the lagoon ' s bacteria and disease-causing microorganisms because such pathogens have been found not to harm the goby . Environmentalists nevertheless are optimistic that the goby may indirectly help the movement to clean_up the lagoon . If closely regulated breaching can be achieved to protect the goby , the thinking goes , then clearing the bureaucratic wrangling among government_agencies that has blocked the cleaning_up of the lagoon can ' t be far behind . &quot; I think the ( federal endangered species ) listing is going_to be the driving force and catalyst to get restoration going , &quot; said Mark Gold , scientist for Heal the Bay . &quot; Hopefully it will also get us off the dime to clean_up the storm drain runoffs. &quot; * The goby has disappeared from half of California ' s few remaining wetlands and has been listed as a &quot; state species of special concern &quot; by the state Fish and Game Department for more_than five years . Tidewater goby live_in estuaries from Humboldt to San Diego counties , where , according to Cat Brown , a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife , they are in imminent danger of extinction . The goby died_off in the lagoon in the 1960s when the dredging of Malibu Creek and bulldozing of the upper lagoon for flood_control covered the course , sandy bottom of the lagoon with sediment , destroying the goby ' s nesting area , said Sean Manion , an ecologist with the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation District . In April , 1991 , Manion , using an $ 18 # 000 state parks department grant , reintroduced 52 goby to the Malibu Lagoon . They have reproduced to 500 . &quot; People say , ' What is so special about the goby ? ' &quot; Manion said . &quot; It ' s just one more cog in the wheel of biodiversity interconnected to all other species ecologically , including man . The fear ecologists have is that you take a species out and there will be an environmental ripple effect or a cascade of extinctions to follow. &quot; * The lagoon , located at the mouth of Malibu Creek at Surfrider Beach , has been polluted by treated sewage flowing in from the Tapia Water Reclamation Plant along the creek as well as pesticides and human and animal waste from communities upstream . Still , the pollutants have had little effect on the goby , whose worst threat is the rapid increase of water salinity brought_on by breaching . Parks employees began bulldozing the berm in 1983 after Malibu residents complained that their septic_tanks were backing_up . The berm is breached whenever the water_level of the lagoon reaches 3.5 feet above the average low_tide , Manion said . Surfers , or &quot; the shovel brigade , &quot; as they have been nicknamed , dig_out their own break to avoid natural breaching , which occurs in the middle of Surfrider Beach ' s long wave break . Some environmentalists believe surfers pose the greatest threat to the goby . &quot; It ' s a bad situation , &quot; said Rainer Hoenecke , a scientist for the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project . &quot; You are going_to have to keep an officer posted there to keep surfers from shoveling out breaks. &quot; * Brown said she is confident that surfers , who are generally environmentally conscious , will curb their breaching of the berm for the sake of the goby once they learn more about the fish . The second greatest threat to the goby , Manion said , is runoff from soil tilling , which disturbs the course , sandy bottom of the lagoon that the goby depends_on for nesting and breeding .</TEXT>
