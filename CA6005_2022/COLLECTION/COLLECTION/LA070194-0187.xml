   <HEADLINE> JUSTICES UPHOLD CALIFORNIA DEATH_PENALTY STATUTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Supreme Court upheld California ' s death_penalty law against a broad constitutional attack on Thursday , sparing state prosecutors the huge headache of seeking new sentencing hearings for the 388 convicted killers who sit on the state ' s Death Row . By an 8-1 vote , the justices said jurors in California are given enough &quot; common-sense &quot; guidance to choose between sentencing a murderer to death or to life in prison without parole . &quot; The states may adopt capital sentencing processes that rely_upon the jury , in its sound_judgment , to exercise wide discretion , &quot; Justice Anthony M . Kennedy wrote for the court . Although that conclusion seems reasonable , it conflicts with opinions in other recent death_penalty cases that set strict standards for capital_punishment in the Southern states . Indeed , Thursday ' s ruling tried to clear_up confusion that the Supreme Court itself had created . Just two years ago , in an another opinion written by Kennedy , the justices struck_down part of Mississippi ' s death_penalty law because it failed to guide sentencing jurors . Then , the court used a scale as a model . Jurors must weigh aggravating factors and mitigating factors , it said . If the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors , the killer gets a death sentence . Otherwise , it would be life in prison . Speaking_for a 6-3 majority in the Mississippi case , Kennedy said it is now &quot; a well-settled principle : Use of a vague or imprecise aggravating factor_in the weighing process invalidates the sentence. &quot; That is so , he said , because allowing jurors to weigh &quot; an illusory circumstance &quot; would unfairly put a &quot; thumb . . . on death ' s side of the scale. &quot; In that case , the disputed circumstance was the prosecutor ' s contention that the murder was &quot; heinous , atrocious and cruel. &quot; California ' s law has wording similar to Mississippi ' s statute . Jurors are told that they &quot; shall impose a sentence of death if ( they ) conclude that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances. &quot; Not surprisingly , defense_lawyers cited the Mississippi decision in their appeals on behalf of Death Row inmates . Acting on two such appeals , the justices in January announced that they would hear a broad challenge to the California law . One appeal was filed on behalf of Paul P . Tuilaepa , who in 1986 shot four men in a Long_Beach bar and killed one of them . Los Angeles County prosecutor William Hodgman called Tuilaepa a &quot; menacing figure and fearsome killer. &quot; The second appeal was filed on behalf of William Proctor , who in 1982 had raped , tortured and murdered a Shasta County schoolteacher . Both appeals argued that the California law allowed jurors to weigh vague factors , such_as the &quot; circumstance of the crime &quot; and the age of the defendant . Since it is hard to weigh something as definite as age or the circumstances of the crime , the law should be deemed unconstitutional , they argued . But in its opinion Thursday in Tuilaepa vs . California , 93-5131 , the high_court barely mentioned the Mississippi case and dropped its references_to weighing matters on a scale . Once a person is convicted of murder with &quot; special circumstances &quot; under California law , &quot; the jury then is free to consider a myriad of factors to determine whether death is the appropriate punishment , &quot; Kennedy wrote . &quot; Indeed , the sentencer ( jury ) may be given unbridled discretion in determining whether the death_penalty should be imposed. &quot; In a concurring opinion , Justice David H . Souter commented that decisions about the death_penalty are &quot; not susceptible to mathematical precision. &quot; California Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren expressed &quot; a great relief &quot; at the outcome . He said the ruling reaffirms his belief that California ' s death_penalty law is &quot; fair and reasonable , and that penalties in these cases have been justly imposed. &quot; &quot; It ' s the same old thing : You run_up against the too-much-murder rule , &quot; said attorney Howard Gillingham of North Hollywood , who represented Tuilaepa in his appeal . &quot; They don ' t want to overturn 200 or 300 cases. &quot; Wendy C . Lascher , the Ventura attorney who represented Proctor , remains convinced that the state ' s jury instructions are not sufficiently precise . &quot; It ' s as if the judge says , ' We ' re going to tell you the instructions ' , but the instructions might as well be in Russian , &quot; she said . Lawyers said Tuilaepa and Proctor have several more steps_in their appeals before they face an execution date . Meanwhile , in a second death_penalty ruling , the high_court on a 5-4 vote said federal judges can intervene to block an execution before a defendant has filed a writ in federal_court . The ruling settles an abstract question of federal jurisdiction that took_on practical significance recently in Texas . There , prosecutors move swiftly to execute Death Row inmates as soon as their final appeals are rejected in the state ' s highest_court . In the case of Frank McFarland , a federal judge said he had no authority to stop the execution to give defense_lawyers enough time to file a writ_of_habeas_corpus in federal_court . The U.S Court of Appeals in Texas agreed , raising the possibility that an inmate could die before a federal_court could examine the substance of his appeal . But in McFarland vs . Collins , 93-6497 , the high_court said federal judges are empowered to grant a stay_of_execution to allow time for the filing of a federal appeal . * Times staff writer Dan Morain in Sacramento contributed to this story .</TEXT>
