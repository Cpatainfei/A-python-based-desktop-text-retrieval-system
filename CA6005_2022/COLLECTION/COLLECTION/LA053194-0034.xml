   <HEADLINE> NEW APPROACH IN WAR ON A TENACIOUS PLAGUE ; RETURN TO BASIC SCIENCE IS URGED IN SEEKING AN AIDS CURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cruel in its manifestation , fiendishly enigmatic in its pathogenesis , AIDS marches on relentlessly . Already 360 # 000 cases have been diagnosed in this country alone ; 220 # 000 people have died . Worse is sure to come soon . It is about 10 years since the disease was first identified . With its stealthy years-long latency , that means thousands infected by the HIV virus in the mid-1980s , before they learned how to protect themselves , will soon start to develop symptoms and die . Despite massive research , the tiny virus has outwitted the best scientific minds . Little progress has been made in finding a cure or vaccine . The time has come for new thinking , new approaches . A lucid and logical framework for the future comes now from Bernard N . Fields of the Harvard Medical_School . In a paper in the_British journal Nature , he argues that AIDS is far more complex than anyone imagined and calls_for a broadening of research and a return to basic science . In other words , valuable time has been lost in following narrow hunches for an easy cure , some magic_bullet . &quot; The real challenge , &quot; he writes , &quot; is to put aside politics and the illusion of easy answers so that we can concentrate_on studies that offer a real possibility of working. &quot; He adds : &quot; In our zeal to control AIDS , we have invested enormous resources in the search for drugs and vaccines . This may have been reasonable 10 years ago , but is no longer. &quot; Wise words , but politically difficult . A huge medical , corporate , bureaucratic and political infrastructure is committed to testing new remedies and vaccines . Even as Dr. Fields ' words were published , the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious_Diseases appeared , reluctantly , to be ready to spend tens of millions of dollars on human tests of two vaccines even though laboratory tests showed they had no effect on HIV viruses isolated from infected people . In their legitimate outrage over the federal_government ' s shameful slowness to act_on AIDS during the last decade , activists forced quick approval of unproven drugs . As a result , the drug AZT was widely prescribed to delay the onset of disease in infected people who had not yet developed symptoms . Only later did further studies show it was useful only in people with advanced disease . AIDS has dashed hopes that it could be controlled as polio was . That devastating epidemic too was caused by a virus . Once it was identified , a vaccine could be developed . Alas , as Fields notes , the HIV virus is far more complex , unpredictable and nefarious . Fields calls_for expanded research in related areas ( such_as on other infectious agents ) , on basic study of the early events of HIV infection and on the so-called opportunistic_infections that often fell AIDS patients . &quot; AIDS is a novel disease requiring new paradigms and a new conceptual framework , &quot; he argues . &quot; We must give serendipity ( and reasoned scientific redirection ) a chance to join the war on AIDS. &quot; His notions are embraced by many AIDS experts , including Dr. Mervyn F . Silverman , president of the American Foundation for AIDS Research , and Dr. William Paul , new director of the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health . Some activist groups , such_as the New York ACT UP organization , continue to focus_on a speedy cure and support a bill in Congress that would set_up a focused research program outside of the NIH . But other AIDS groups , though divided , have begun to see that such narrow approaches have so far proved counterproductive . We need a new beginning on AIDS .</TEXT>
