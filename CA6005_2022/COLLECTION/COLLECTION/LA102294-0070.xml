   <HEADLINE> MAJOR ACCEPTS IRA CEASE-FIRE , OPENS BORDERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In another long step toward peace in Northern_Ireland , British Prime_Minister John Major announced here Friday that he accepts the current cease-fire in the troubled province , and he ordered all border crossings opened . The cease-fire now being observed by both sides in the long-running conflict is &quot; intended to be permanent , &quot; Major said , and Britain will enter into talks with Sinn Fein , the political arm of the outlawed Irish_Republican_Army , &quot; before this year is out. &quot; The announcement indicated that , after 25 years of violence in Northern_Ireland , leaders of all factions would be invited to sit at the same table to seek a solution that would satisfy both the majority Protestants , who want to retain British rule_in the province , and minority Catholics , who want the_British out . Speaking_to a luncheon of Belfast business people , Major said he is also lifting a British ban against Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams and Vice_President Martin McGuinness , allowing them now to travel freely in Britain . Additionally , the prime_minister said he will review the need for British army soldiers to patrol the streets of Northern_Ireland and may begin turning policing over to the civilian Royal Ulster Constabulary . During the cease-fire , the soldiers have kept a low profile , and army sources say that some units may now be returned to Britain . Major said the coming talks will address the sensitive matter of paramilitary groups turning_in their weapons and explosives , but he did not make_it a condition of any party joining the talks . The prime_minister ' s announcement was hailed by most moderate leaders in Northern_Ireland , particularly Protestant and Catholic clergymen . The exception was the militant Protestant Rev . Ian Paisley , head of the Democratic Unionist Party , who charged that Major had &quot; gone_back_on promises to the people of Northern_Ireland over talks . He said the cease-fire had to be permanent. &quot; Until now , the_British government had insisted that the IRA and Sinn Fein must declare any cease-fire permanent -- as called_for in last December ' s Downing Street Declaration signed by Major and Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds , which spelled_out terms for peace talks . On Friday , Major said the IRA ' s adherence to the cease-fire was &quot; more compelling than their words. &quot; Paisley also declared that a surrendering of weapons by paramilitary forces should be made a condition of any peace talks . Protestant Member_of_Parliament Ken Maginnis , a moderate , said of the Friday announcement : &quot; It is risky but courageous . John Major is throwing down the gauntlet to the paramilitaries to keep the cease-fire. &quot; The IRA announced a unilateral cease-fire on Aug . 31 , which the group has observed . They were joined last week by the main Protestant Unionist paramilitary groups . Reynolds and American leaders had pressured Major to accept that the cease-fire was working and join in talks with all parties north and south of the_Irish border . In Washington , President Clinton congratulated Northern_Ireland ' s warring parties on their progress , calling the developments &quot; very hopeful &quot; and adding : &quot; I am very glad that the United States has been able to be involved in this peace process in Northern Ireland. &quot; Major , supported by British loyalist leaders in Northern_Ireland , urged caution Friday , but he apparently is now convinced that the cease-fire will hold long enough for talks to begin . &quot; I am now prepared to make a working assumption that the cease-fire is intended to be permanent , &quot; he said . &quot; If we can continue reasonably to assume that Sinn Fein is establishing a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods , if the IRA continues to show that it has ended terrorism , then we shall be ready to convene exploratory talks before this year is out. &quot; &quot; If the cease-fire breaks_down , &quot; one commentator here said , &quot; the prime_minister can ' t be blamed for trying. &quot; And Major himself , under drizzly skies , visited border areas Friday . In Dungannon , he told well-wishers : &quot; I hope the violence is over . If not , it was not for want of trying. &quot; A total of 88 border crossings will be opened , thus easing the burden of rural farmers who have relatives and business interests on both sides of the border with the Republic_of_Ireland . Major said in his speech that his strategy &quot; is to make_sure that the violence is over for good . We must aim to make a return to violence unthinkable. &quot; Sinn Fein ' s McGuinness said of Major ' s announcement : &quot; I think we have seen the_British government at last moving_in the right direction . We are heading for a melting_pot of talks , where eventually the_British government ends its jurisdiction over Northern Ireland. &quot; But striking an ominous note , a former Sinn Fein and IRA chief accused Adams of betrayal and warned that a new terrorist group will emerge to fight British control of the province . Ruairi O ' Bradaigh , said to have been an IRA chief during the 1960s , told the Belfast Telegraph that the IRA cease-fire is permanent , because the leadership has been &quot; constitutionalized. &quot; But in the nature of the long struggle , he said , another group would rise_up to take its place . On Monday , Major will meet Reynolds in England to discuss the next steps_in arranging all-party peace talks .</TEXT>
