   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; ECONOMIC REPORTS PUT DOW ABOVE 3 # 800 ; BONDS RALLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fresh signs that inflation was under_control in May inspired a bond rally that helped hoist the Dow Jones industrial average to its highest close since late March . The broad advance on Wall_Street was led by hard-charging cyclical stocks . The Dow climbed 31.71 points to 3 # 814.83 as investors snapped_up shares of businesses particularly sensitive to changes in the economic weather . It was the first time the blue_chip indicator finished above 3 # 800 since March 24 , when it closed at 3 # 821.09. Since then , worries about rising interest_rates and inflation have tempered investors ' buying fever . In the broader market , gainers led losers by about 11 to 7 on the New York Stock_Exchange , where the volume totaled 288.55 million shares . A range of stock measures moved ahead . The NYSE composite index rose 1.34 to 255.10 , and Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500-stock index added 3.27 to 462.37. Smaller companies also posted solid gains , with the Nasdaq composite index rising 4.28 to 735.98. Equity investors took their cue from the bond market , where traders bought enthusiastically at the outset of the session in response to government economic reports . The buying pace moderated as the session progressed , but prices of Treasury_notes and bonds still sported decent increases by the end of the day . The yield on the key 30-year issue fell to 7.30 % from 7.35 % on Monday , driving its price up about half a point . In the morning , bond yields fell after reports showed that May retail sales dropped and the consumer_price_index for May edged_up modestly . Gains were eaten_away a bit later by a report of higher retail sales for the first_half of June . Bond investors tend to be scared by strong economic_growth , which carries the threat of inflation . Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities such_as Treasuries . The much-anticipated release of May consumer_price_index figures affected the market less than it might have , because the data came_in as expected , traders said . The 0.2 % drop_in retail sales marked the second straight monthly decline . The Commerce_Department data provided further evidence that the Federal_Reserve_Board interest_rate increases this year are helping slow the economy , analysts said . The Labor_Department ' s May inflation report said consumer prices edged_up 0.2 % as falling gasoline prices and the biggest one-month drop_in airline fares in 25 years partly offset rising food costs . Apart from the falling bond rates , stocks also benefited from renewed interest in companies particularly sensitive to the economic climate . Keeping_in mind that an expanding economy will generate business , investors focused_on companies most likely to reap the rewards , such_as construction machinery makers and car_manufacturers . Among Tuesday ' s market highlights : * The Big Three auto_makers were all active on the Big Board , with General Motors moving_up 1 1 / 2 to 53 5 / 8 , Chrysler up 1 3 / 8 to 49 7 / 8 and Ford Motor up 2 1 / 4 to 61 1 / 8 . * Cyclicals also rose , including Caterpillar , up 3 3 / 8 to 109 3 / 8 ; Ingersoll-Rand , up 1 3 / 4 to 38 3 / 4 , and Hercules , up 2 3 / 4 to 112 3 / 4 . * Exxon fell 5 / 8 to 59 in active trading . The stock tumbled 2 1 / 4 on Monday after a federal jury ruled that the oil_company acted recklessly in the events leading_up to the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska . * Sprint slipped 2 3 / 4 to 37 1 / 8 after telecommunications monopolies in Germany and France unveiled plans to buy 20 % of the third-largest U.S. long-distance carrier . * New World Communications rose 1 3 / 4 to 13 3 / 8 on news that it named former NBC Entertainment chief Brandon Tartikoff to head its production company .

Conrail gained 2 5 / 8 to 57 1 / 2 and Norfolk Southern added 1 7 / 8 to 67 1 / 8 . * Travelers jumped 2 to 35 1 / 2 on word that the company will merge with Metropolitan Life_Insurance in a deal that would create one of the nation ' s largest health_insurance networks .
