   <HEADLINE> IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY , STUDY AND BUSINESS EXPERIENCE ABROAD ARE CRITICAL . YET AMERICANS STAY HOME WHILE 400 # 000 FOREIGN STUDENTS COME HERE TO LEARN . CALL IT ... ; THE STUDENT GAP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shadowing the $ 100-billion U.S. merchandise trade_deficit with the ascendant economies of Asia is an equally astounding &quot; student gap &quot; -- a strategic lapse that experts warn is laying a groundwork of ignorance and incompetence for the United States as a player in the global economy . At last count , there were 63 times as_many foreign students from Asia on U.S. campuses as there were Americans studying in Asia , according to the Institute of International Education . The statistic means American businesses will remain at a distinct disadvantage as they negotiate with their counterparts in Asia across language_barriers and cultural chasms , analysts contend . Opportunities are bound to be lost , they say , because of limited access to basic information in the markets of America ' s most important economic rivals . &quot; The imbalance implies a huge problem , &quot; said Eric J . Gangloff , director of the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission , an agency created by Congress to foster cultural exchange . &quot; To be able to work effectively with Japan or other Asian_countries , we need a large_number of young Americans coming_up through the ranks who are competent . But this can only be accomplished through in-country learning. &quot; To be sure , the lopsided relationship is_due largely to a laudable American tradition of opening its educational system to the world . The IIE says 438 # 618 foreign students were enrolled at U.S. campuses in 1993 , more_than half from Asia . The assumption is that some will end_up working for American industry and that many others will return home with a profound appreciation of democratic values -- an intangible_asset for U.S. influence on the world . But when it comes_to training its own students , the United States suffers from world-class myopia , despite the wealth of international diversity on its campuses . Perhaps out of cultural arrogance , perhaps out of apathy or the fear of the unknown , relatively few young Americans venture outside of the comfort of Western Europe for international learning experiences . Of the approximately 13.5 million American university_students , only 8 % are enrolled in language courses and a mere 0.5 % go overseas to study , surveys show . Only a small number of exchange students and graduate fellows are gaining experience in Asia , the Middle_East , Africa or Eastern Europe . Instead , nearly three quarters of them go_to Western Europe ; one in four goes_to Britain for study . In a competitive world , that kind of student deployment no longer makes_sense to a growing number of educators and policy-makers . The new thinking on global education is moving away from the time-honored fantasy of reading poetry in Parisian cafes during a junior year abroad and instead refocusing on such practical matters as training engineering students to read patents in Japanese . &quot; There ' s a real shortage of people with technical expertise who know Japan well , &quot; said Norbert Hootsmans , who interned in a Hitachi engineering research lab in Japan after getting his Ph.D in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology two years ago . &quot; I see a strong need out there , but there are very few people who can bridge the gap. &quot; Hootsmans now works as a scientist specializing in manufacturing technology development at United Technologies in East Hartford , Conn . For him , going_to Japan for experience was the logical thing to do . &quot; In my field , &quot; he said , &quot; you go_to where the technology is the best. &quot; Hootsmans is a success story , but he ' s the exception . To redirect the Eurocentric orientation of overseas study , Sen . David Boren ( D-Okla. ) pushed a bill through Congress in 1991 establishing the National Security Education program . The program ' s aim is to finance overseas study outside Western Europe and build academic infrastructure at U.S. institutions for study of neglected areas of the world . The program was originally authorized for a $ 150-million &quot; peace dividend &quot; endowment from the intelligence budget , but lawmakers ultimately wrangled the money from the B-2 bomber program . Already , however , the program is under pressure . In June , about a month after its first 485 awards were announced , the House defense subcommittee on appropriations rejected authorization to spend interest from the endowment_fund to finance next year ' s operations . Proponents hope they ' ll have better luck in the Senate , where the Appropriations Committee is considering a bill that would restore authorization to spend $ 8.5 million on the program . It was funded at $ 10 million this year and had requested $ 14.3 million for next year . &quot; I think there ' s a lot of misunderstanding of what the program is doing , &quot; said Charlene King , director of the lean staff of volunteers administering the grants . King rejects criticism from some members of Congress that the program is frivolous , noting that a third of the undergraduate fellowships awarded this year are sending students to East Asia , a critical and challenging study environment . &quot; The return on investment comes when these students take their skills into the work_force , &quot; King said . &quot; Heaven knows we need it. &quot; But budget cutters in Congress are also snipping away at another peace dividend program for higher education , this one aimed primarily at preparing American engineering and science students for the real-life challenges of competing with Japan in the global high-technology arena . Administered by the Air_Force , the U.S.-Japan Industry and Technology Management Training Program subsidizes student internships in Japanese companies . ( It is this program that helped Hootsmans land his berth at Hitachi. ) Its model is a program , run_by MIT since 1981 , that has trained about 300 engineering and business students in Japanese-language and regional studies and placed them in internships with Japanese corporations . The Air_Force adopted the MIT design and over the past three years has expanded the number of institutions offering such training and internships to 10 , including Stanford and UC Berkeley . It has sponsored an additional 415 students to date . But this year ' s authorized funding of $ 10 million was chopped in half , according to a spokeswoman for the Office of Air_Force Scientific Research , which administers the program . &quot; We work very hard with Congress and government people to help them understand this program , &quot; said Patricia Gercik , director of the prototype Japan Program at MIT . &quot; But I think America has become very insular . We didn ' t used to be this way. &quot; The consequences come_down to dollars and cents . Norman Peterson of the Alliance for International Education and Cultural Exchange , a Washington group that monitors student exchange issues , asserts that there is a direct_correlation between foreign study and economic competitiveness . &quot; Across the board , we have a major gap , and it costs us , &quot; Peterson said . &quot; We continue to be perplexed at how the Japanese do business . We don ' t have an experience of any size that helps us to understand and work with Japan. &quot; In the past , government-funded efforts at sending American students abroad have been broadly aimed at academia . The venerable Fulbright Fellowship program , for instance , has emphasized exchanges of scholars bound for teaching posts . But now , the focus is slowly shifting to technical and professional career training . An example is the Japan scholarship at Columbia University ' s Graduate_School of Journalism , one of the programs supported by Gangloff ' s federally funded Friendship Commission . Columbia prepares two Japanese-speaking American students each year for long-term internships with news organizations in Japan . Over the past decade , graduates have gone_on to take positions in the Tokyo press corps , raising the standards of Japanese-language proficiency among foreign reporters there . But acquiring a solid foundation in difficult languages such_as Chinese , Japanese or Russian requires a major investment of time , educators point_out . Study should begin in high_school and continue in college , they say , ideally galvanized by an in-country living experience . The most recent studies say college enrollment in Chinese-language courses rose about 15 % between 1986 and 1990 , while study of the Japanese language doubled . But the numbers are still small . In 1990 , more_than a quarter of a_million students enrolled in French , but only 19 # 490 enrolled in Chinese and 45 # 719 took Japanese . Interest in Japanese is spreading significantly in American high_schools , where about 26 # 000 studied the language in 1990 . But that ' s a far_cry from English study in Japan , where the subject is required in grades seven through 12 . David Maxwell , director of the National Foreign Language Assn . in Washington , worries that university study of Russian has recently taken a &quot; dramatic dive &quot; as students find it hard to imagine visiting the area . &quot; The perception is that the former republics of the Soviet_Union continue to be one of the most dangerous places on Earth , &quot; he said . Maxwell is encouraged by indications that Japanese study is continuing to rise dramatically , although he has misgivings about the naive expectations of easy wealth that apparently motivate some students . &quot; A lot of students are saying they are going_to study Japanese , get an MBA at Harvard or Stanford and then get rich , &quot; Maxwell said . Yet while interest in Japanese studies has soared with the recognition of that country ' s economic prowess , the number of Americans studying in Japan appears to be declining . The cause appears to be the appreciating Japanese yen , which makes the cost_of_living untenable for many and exacerbates the difficulties of adjusting to life in a relatively closed society . A study by the Laurasian Institution , a Washington think_tank , notes that the count of U.S. students in Japan peaked at 1 # 769 in the 1991-92 academic_year , declining 20 % by this year . In comparison , the number of Japanese students in U.S. universities has risen dramatically since the value of the yen began to soar in 1986 , approaching 43 # 000 in 1993 . Study in China has also suffered a setback , but for different reasons . Following the Tian An Men massacre in 1989 , when Chinese troops crushed pro-democracy student demonstrators , estimated American enrollment in Chinese universities and language_schools dropped_by more_than 50 % to about 700 students . &quot; Students being shot is not the best marketing &quot; for a host country , said Philip Palin , director of the Laurasian Institution . &quot; But the problem in China is also very similar to Japan . There ' s a lack of infrastructure to receive foreign students . There ' s no English-language curriculum and a lot of problems with housing. &quot; Chinese students , meanwhile , topped the charts of foreigners attending U.S. schools , numbering more_than 45 # 000 in 1993 . One of the favored destinations for Asian students is the University of Southern California , which ranks among the top three American institutions in foreign student enrollment . Two-thirds of USC ' s 4 # 189 foreign students in the 1993-94 year were from Asia : 995 from Taiwan , 432 from South_Korea , 426 from China , 266 from Hong Kong , 264 from India , 218 from Japan and 204 from Indonesia . In the other direction , USC sent 112 students abroad , most of them to Western Europe . Fifteen students went_to Japan -- the same number that went_to Australia . New programs are in the works to send students to universities in China , Taiwan and South_Korea , according to the Office of Overseas Studies , but no students have participated in them yet . To bolster the number of undergraduates studying in Japan , the Friendship Commission ' s Gangloff is working with other institutions to establish a clearinghouse to provide aspiring students with information on available programs . Meanwhile , a Washington nonprofit organization called Gateway Japan is offering the services of a database it is assembling on Japan study programs . Former Vice_President Walter Mondale , the U.S. ambassador to Japan , has taken a personal interest in the issue . After long negotiations , Tokyo ' s Ministry of Education is relenting to American demands that the national university system be made more accessible to foreign students . Tokyo University is planning to open an international division with an English-language curriculum . Nobel laureate Leon Esaki , president of state-run Tsukuba University , chairs a commission examining the question of how to get more American students into university programs in Japan . But Gangloff and other educators agree that one of the biggest obstacles is at this end : the lack of an academic infrastructure to prepare students for the trials of studying in Japan . &quot; The real nut to crack is how do we get more numbers , &quot; said Jackson Bailey , a historian from Earlham College in Indiana and a pioneer in taking American undergraduates to Japan . &quot; But we need to get more undergraduates interested and prepared if we ' re going to try to open new opportunities in Japan . There ' s the danger that we may throw a party and nobody comes. &quot; Ironically , the very mentality of the U.S. job market may be the biggest barrier of all to developing young Americans with badly needed expertise in Asia . Educators lament that American corporations -- even multinationals with years of experience battling for business in Asian markets -- typically ignore language skills and overseas study experience when evaluating the credentials of candidates . U.S. employers prefer to hire candidates with business degrees , they say , and are reluctant to invest the time to train someone who might have significant experience studying in Asia . That takes_away the incentive to learn . &quot; If students don ' t get the word that you ' ll get a better-paying job if you graduate with joint degrees in Japanese and business , for example , they aren ' t going_to be motivated . There ' s no incentive in their brain , &quot; said Richard Drobnick , a USC business professor . &quot; There may be a general awareness of this at the senior levels of the companies , &quot; he said . &quot; The CEOs are sympathetic , but not at the recruiting level. &quot; Study in Contrasts More_than six times as_many foreigners come_to the United States for higher education as Americans go abroad to study . The gap -- which has broad implications for business competitiveness -- is especially wide vis a vis Asia . There are 63 times as_many Asian students on U.S. campuses as Americans studying in Asia .
