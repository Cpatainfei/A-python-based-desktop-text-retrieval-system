   <HEADLINE> MOVIES ; THE AGE OF INSOLENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kalle Matso and Scott White , both 26 , have been film critics for the Beach Reporter , a weekly newspaper , since August , 1992 . In their column , &quot; The Reel Deal , &quot; they chat back and forth about their opinions of the movies they ' re reviewing -- sort of a Siskel &amp; Ebert for the twentysomething set -- though they would like it to be pointed_out that they have not been to film school and don ' t profess to know more about movies than anyone else . Today ' s topic is the current debate raging through Hollywood : Are Generation X movie- g oers , weaned on MTV and Nike ads , physically addicted to films that are long on style and short on substance , and are studios pandering to them ? And if so , does anybody care ? Kalle Matso : You know , people are always saying , &quot; They don ' t make movies like they used to. &quot; My take_on that is . . . duh . The technology has completely changed , and so has the audience . The real issue is are we hitting new lows in entertainment or reaching new highs ? Scott White : New lows . No doubt about it . As a self-loathing member of the much ballyhooed Generation X , I ' m a testament to the negative effects of too_much Diet Coke , MTV and Sega Genesis . If I go just one day without some kaleidoscopic visual input , my mother has to call the family internist . Matso : Well , look , that ' s life . It ' s a cosmic law that everything gets faster and faster , and that applies to movies as well . White : I know what the trends are , but because big studios target my demographic , great movies -- like &quot; The Godfather &quot; and &quot; One Flew Over the Cuckoo ' s Nest &quot; -- are fewer and farther between . Matso : It sounds to me like you have some kind of sick fascination with the ' 70s . White : Oh , I can name some great modern movies . &quot; Dances With Wolves &quot; and &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; are both fine films . My point is that the movie_industry mirrors the times , and right now we are in an age where Howard Stern and Jerry Seinfeld top the nonfiction bestseller list , and there ' s more interest in who will replace Chevy Chase than there is in the fact that Roger Clinton has unlimited access to the White_House . Matso : that ' s such a reactionary viewpoint . Every age decries the values of the younger generation . My father and his buddies were called &quot; juvenile_delinquents &quot; for wearing red jackets after they saw &quot; Rebel Without a Cause. &quot; I was labeled &quot; not quite right &quot; when , after seeing &quot; Batman , &quot; I took_to wearing a utility belt . What ' s the difference ? White : The difference is in the degree . Now , even people ' s reactions to movies are dumber and more self-destructive . Look_at all these dolts daring cars to run them over after seeing it done_in &quot; The Program. &quot; I ' d be very surprised if your dad or any of his buddies ever saw &quot; The Grapes of Wrath &quot; and thought it would be pretty cool to become oppressed migrant workers . Matso : So would I , but Generation X doesn ' t have a monopoly on stupid audiences or stupid films . People talk wistfully about the era that produced &quot; The Graduate &quot; and forget that , right next door , Jane Fonda and a guy with wings were going at it on the set of &quot; Barbarella. &quot; White : But if they remade &quot; Barbarella &quot; with THX sound and Industrial Light and Magic special_effects , it would probably be a serious contender for a_People ' s Choice Award . With computer-generated animation , MTV-style camera work and a soundtrack by a_couple_of Seattle bands , they could make a PG-13 blockbuster based on the last_days of Dylan Thomas . Most of the big movies of this age ( &quot; Star Wars , &quot; &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; ) , sans technological advancements , would have been B-movies 20 years ago . Matso : Great . I ' m debating movies with one of the Monkey_Wrench Gang . Look , you ' re never going_to stop the progression of technology , and there ' s no reason to try unless you ' re a Pennsylvania Mennonite . More sophisticated movie-making techniques make_for more sophisticated entertainment . Just be thankful that &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; was an amazingly realistic foray_into the prehistoric era rather than 120 minutes of &quot; The Land of the Lost. &quot; White : But it ' s all technique now . &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; was impressive , but anything cerebral in the film was completely overshadowed by the highly provocative scene in which Laura Dern plunges her hands into a big pile of dinosaur doo-doo . Matso : I disagree . I came_out of &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; asking myself lots of questions . How much do I really know about genetic_engineering ? Where do we draw_the_line between manipulating nature and playing God ? Does Jeff Goldblum ' s chaos theory have any effect on keno ? White : I don ' t know . &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; might have inspired spirited discourse on the moral implications of cloning in Newsweek and Scientific American , but over at the Mann 6 , the debate centered squarely on who would win in a fight : T . rex or Carl ( The Truth ) Williams . Matso : Look , I think you ' re searching for subtlety in all_the wrong places . You should see one less flick a week and squeeze in a visit to the Getty Museum . Great movies that completely lack intellectual qualities are a staple of Hollywood filmmaking . Check_out &quot; Jaws , &quot; &quot; Star Wars &quot; and &quot; Ghostbusters , &quot; great films mostly devoid_of social commentary , unless you count the thematic motif in all three films -- that , in the end , evil will always get blown_up . White : But we ' ve let fast and flashy movies -- like all three &quot; Back to the Futures &quot; -- define our theater experiences . We don ' t want movies to pose questions any more profound than &quot; would going_back in time and being able to predict future events help me meet babes ? &quot; Matso : Challenging intellectual concepts are all well and good , but I can ' t tell you how stoked I was as a 14-year-old watching &quot; Raiders of the Lost Ark &quot; to forget , for at least two hours , that I was wearing headgear for my braces . I don ' t think there ' s any reason to apologize for creating good escapism . White : The problem is that escapism is no longer a means to an end but an end in itself . At least past generations had a reason to escape ; they were living under the threat of nuclear Armageddon . What are we worried about -- the future of GATT ? Matso : C ' mon . It doesn ' t take much for people to feel the need to escape . In fact , sometimes I need to escape_from bad entertainment . It was absolutely essential for me to re-rent my favorite movie , &quot; Witness , &quot; after sitting through four hours of the Rose Parade . White : I just think that our generation has defined itself by its ability to find various ways of avoiding responsibility . In their middle 20s , our parents went_to John Wayne films to forget about house payments . I spend endless hours in coffee_shops wondering why my mother insists on charging me a token rent . Matso : Generation X doesn ' t avoid responsibility . I think we forget about it because today ' s entertainment is so good . I used to do small chores during television ads ; now I stay_put for fear of missing a new Miller Lite commercial . White : I don ' t think entertainment is any better , just more ubiquitous , so that we actually get shocked if there ' s nothing captivating on the tube . In the past , if there was nothing good on TV , people would converse or read . Now , if all 50-plus channels fail , people panic and beeline to a video outlet , hoping that at least one of the &quot; Police_Academy &quot; movies will still be available . Matso : We do have more entertainment options than any generation before us . I mean , I ' ve been planning to buy a chess_set for a while , but I figure why not wait until it comes_out on virtual_reality ? White : Your fascination with flash is exactly what I ' m talking_about , and it ' s reflected in the movies that Hollywood pumps out . Most Generation X moviegoers are hooked on fast-paced flicks and consider anything else a bad substitute . Of course , these are the movies that make the big bucks , which explains why George Lucas is poised to displace Italy in the Group of Seven while the maker of &quot; The Wedding Banquet &quot; can be seen holding a sign that says , &quot; Will direct for food. &quot; Matso : What are you telling me -- that soon it will be impossible to find movies that are out of the mainstream ? White : No , but there are a lot of us who love the medium of film and want desperately to kick the pulp habit , and it just seems that there are fewer and fewer movies that allow us to &quot; go_on the wagon &quot; every once in a while . Matso : That I can agree with . There aren ' t enough movies made these days that explore the middle ground between compelling visuals and intriguing stories . There are some exceptions -- &quot; Boyz N the Hood &quot; and &quot; Unforgiven , &quot; to name a couple -- but mostly the movie listings consist_of &quot; Wayne ' s World 2 &quot; playing right next to &quot; The Piano. &quot; It ' s the restaurant equivalent of offering patrons either a chili_dog or escargot . White : It ' s either period_pieces or pyrotechnics . I very much liked &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; but , because my grandmother was unwilling to forgo her aqua therapy , was forced to see it alone . I had difficulty convincing friends my age to spend $ 7 to watch a sexually repressed British butler for 2 1 / 2 hours . Matso : Yeah . I was clearly the youngest_person in the theater when I saw &quot; Remains. &quot; And it was the same thing with &quot; The Age of Innocence , &quot; a movie that , in my opinion , was extremely well made but had nothing to offer our generation . I guarantee that virtually no one in the 20th Century can empathize with a character that turns_down Michelle Pfeiffer because of social pressures . If people want to get Generation X ' ers into more thought-provoking movies , they should pick subjects that are more relevant . White : What , like the upcoming &quot; Beavis and Butt-head &quot; and &quot; Jerky Boys &quot; projects ? If the movie_industry completely kowtows to our spiraling standards we ' ll end_up with &quot; Geraldo : The Movie. &quot; Doesn ' t it trouble you that challenging films are made almost exclusively by foreign and independent filmmakers or by directors who have more money than you can shake a stick at ? Matso : Not particularly . I think it ' s great that Steven Spielberg made &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; a very heavy , black-and-white movie about the Holocaust . There ' s no way it will generate his usual gross , and I doubt that he ' ll be able to make much money on merchandising rights . White : But only Spielberg can pull_off a risky movie like that . He could make a megahit about philately . Matso : that ' s not true . Look_at &quot; Flesh and Bone , &quot; for example . Here ' s a movie billed as a thriller and yet only has five gunshots in the entire screenplay . It was a tight and deliberately slower-paced film . White : Which no one saw . If you ' re going to make a movie that ' s driven more by the characters than by the action , the protagonist has got_to do more_than restock vending_machines and stare cryptically at the open road . Matso : You ' re being a little harsh . &quot; Flesh and Bone &quot; was a good movie . White : To you , maybe . To me it was a boring version of &quot; The Hitcher. &quot; Still , I hope it encourages producers to sanction movies that aren ' t based on television sitcoms and don ' t have Roman_numerals in the title . Matso : Need I remind you that &quot; The Godfather II &quot; won an Academy Award for best picture ? White : Need I remind you that &quot; Rocky IV &quot; sucked even more_than &quot; The Exorcist III &quot; ? Matso : Look , the bottom_line is that you ' re worried for no reason . I think people have always had high- and low-road entertainment options . White : I still think there are fewer and fewer exceptions to what is becoming an ever-hardening rule . Our generation demands films that fit easily into one of three categories : fast-paced , light or maudlin . Matso : Let me just ask you one last question . Don ' t you think twentysomethings ' demand for snappy and wisecracking cinema has also produced some good movies ? I mean , in a less frenetic decade , the Coen brothers ( &quot; Raising Arizona , &quot; &quot; Miller ' s Crossing &quot; ) would have been diagnosed with brain_fever . White : Sure . There ' s been some good stuff , and , yes , I ' m certain that James Cameron ' s next movie will be a real joy ride . On the other hand , I ' m equally certain that our generation is paying a price for its addiction to flash . Maybe it ' s because I have_younger brothers who bring_up the tail_end of Generation X . I know for a fact there is only one way I could get them into an edifying film like &quot; The Remains of the Day. &quot; Matso : And that is ? White : I ' d have to tell them that Merchant and Ivory , while famous for excellent adaptations of literary_works , are also renowned for really bitchin ' graphics .</TEXT>
