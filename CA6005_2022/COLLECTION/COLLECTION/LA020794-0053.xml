   <HEADLINE> COUNTDOWN TO LILLEHAMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; EVEN WITH EXPORTS , RUSSIA STILL HAS A HOCKEY WELL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alexei Kovalev greeted Alex Zhitnik , who was chatting with Sergei Zubov , while Sergei Nemchinov and Alexander Karpovtsev were deep in a discussion , perhaps deciding where they would go_after their game . It was not in Moscow , but in Inglewood , between the Kings and the New York Rangers . The NHL is home to so many expatriates from the former Soviet_Union that nearly every night , the exotic and deep sounds of Russian resound through the corridors outside their locker_rooms . Closely pursuing the Kings ' Wayne Gretzky for the NHL scoring title is center Sergei Fedorov , who four years ago exchanged his Central Red Army uniform for the winged wheel of the NHL ' s Detroit Red Wings . As he blossoms into one of the league ' s best two-way players and earns consideration for most-valuable-player honors , he has a four-year , $ 11.7-million contract . Fedorov ' s former linemates , Pavel Bure and Alexander Mogilny , are thriving , too . Bure led the Vancouver Canucks in scoring last season with 60 goals and 110 points . Mogilny , of the Buffalo Sabres , tied for the league scoring lead with 76 goals . He was named the Sabres ' captain this season after Pat LaFontaine suffered a season-ending knee injury . Also flourishing is center Alexei Yashin of the Ottawa Senators , a top candidate for rookie of the year . The Winnipeg Jets ' Alexei Zhamnov , the Philadelphia Flyers ' Dmitri Yuskevitch , the Toronto Maple Leafs ' Dmitri Mironov , the Sabres ' Yuri Khmylev and the Red Wings ' Viacheslav Kozlov and Vladimir Konstantinov are mainstays of their teams , too . They are merely the more recent arrivals . Viacheslav Fetisov of the New Jersey Devils , Alexei Kasatonov of the Mighty Ducks and Sergei Makarov and Igor Larionov of the San Jose Sharks , who have each played three NHL seasons or more , are old-timers . The fruits of the Soviet hockey program continue to be harvested by the NHL , and there ' s no end in_sight to either the outbound stream of talent or the success of the Russian team , heir to the legend of the Big Red Machine . Hockey_players have become a major export for Russia and its neighbors as they struggle with the economic and social upheaval of the Soviet breakup . Transfer fees collected from teams in the NHL , Switzerland , Finland and Germany line the pockets of the factions fighting for control of Russian hockey , instead of supporting local clubs , yet that nation continues to churn_out a steady supply of clever puck-handlers and dazzling skaters who will challenge for another gold medal in the Winter_Olympics , opening Saturday . &quot; Yes , they ' ve lost an awful lot of players to the NHL , but they ' re perhaps one of the best countries at developing talent , and they have a wealth of it , &quot; said Tim Taylor , coach of the U.S. Olympic team . &quot; I still think Russia has to be considered one of the favorites . They are perhaps the best team ( at ) developing talent and they have a wealth of it . They ' ve got an awful lot of excellent hockey_players and coaches in that country. &quot; The gold medal won at Albertville in 1992 by the Unified Team , as it was then known , was supposed to be the last hurrah for the Soviet system and for venerable Coach Viktor Tikhonov . The predicted collapse hasn ' t happened , for several reasons . With a population of 150 million and a spirit that remains fierce in the face of famine and economic hardship , Russia still produces enough players to compensate for its losses . Its coaches still emphasize technique over competition well into players ' teen years , scheduling relatively few games so they can spend time refining skating and passing skills . That combination of sheer numbers , attitude and attention to detail enables Russia to prevail over countries that have experienced similar talent drains . &quot; As the Russian talent pool has decreased , so has the Swedish pool , the Finnish pool and the Czech pool , &quot; said Paul Theofanous , an agent who represents several Russian players in the NHL and has traveled extensively in Russia . &quot; Bank on the place with the larger reserve of players , and that ' s Russia any day of the week. &quot; So , although the nation ' s best players might be skating for NHL teams , the squad that will represent Russia in the Olympics is rated one of the favorites to win the hockey tournament . And that ' s even if high-scoring forwards Viacheslav Bykov and Andrei Khomutov aren ' t released by Fribourg of the_Swiss League , their current employer . &quot; The Russians still have those skills -- that ' s part of their game you can ' t take_away , &quot; said Chuck Grillo , vice_president and director of player personnel for the San Jose Sharks . &quot; That and the hockey sense . That part ' s fine , no matter what else has happened over there . &quot; I don ' t think you replace the Larionovs , Bykovs and Khomutovs . I don ' t think they make guys like that anymore , anywhere in the world . But to measure what kind of talent they have left , look_at this : In Izvestia ( a major international tournament held_in Russia in December ) , they had two teams and they ended_up in the finals against each other. &quot; At Izvestia , in which Canada , the United States , Sweden and the Czech Republic entered virtually the same squads that will compete in the Winter_Olympics , Tikhonov ' s team trounced a team coached by former Soviet star Boris Mikhailov . However , Tikhonov , who has coached three gold medal-winning teams , would not declare it an omen of Russian Olympic success . &quot; I am not in favor of forecasting the future , &quot; he said . &quot; However , I always try to develop the psychology of a winner in my players. &quot; He seems to have no trouble doing that . &quot; Granted , Tikhonov is getting older , but he ' s still got his marbles , &quot; Theofanous said . But Tikhonov , who is in his late 60s , can ' t keep his players from leaving home to earn American or Canadian_dollars or Swiss_francs to buy the luxuries unavailable to them in Russia . Gone are the days of players who competed in two Olympics or even three , as defense partners Fetisov and Kasatonov did when their team won the silver medal in 1980 and the gold in ' 84 and ' 88 . The legendary goaltender , Vladislav Tretiak , also helped win the gold in 1972 and ' 76 and the silver in ' 80 . Gone are the days when a trio of forwards would skate alongside each other so_long , their line would earn a nickname that brought instant international recognition , like the K-L-M line of Vladimir Krutov , Larionov and Makarov . &quot; You look_at it , and they were always able to keep their superstars together , &quot; Grillo said . &quot; that ' s why we think there ' s a drop-off in the quality of their play , because they don ' t have the same units for as long as they used to and they have to replace people . But no one ' s been able to do_it here , either . There ' s never been a group kept together at one level -- an NHL team or an Olympic team. &quot; Of the 27 players on the preliminary Russian roster for the Olympics , only two played_at Albertville in 1992 -- and those two , Khomutov and Bykov , probably won ' t be released by their professional teams for these Games . A blend of the two squads that competed at Izvestia , the Russian team has two defensemen who are 23 and two who are 22 , including Andrei Sapozhnikov , a fifth-round draft choice of the Boston Bruins last June . Otherwise , it has mainly players who have experience in the World Championships , although few have been drafted by NHL teams . Notable among the forwards are Valeri Karpov , a 22-year-old left_wing chosen 56th overall by the Mighty Ducks last June ; 20-year-old left wing Andrei Nikolishin , who was selected 47th in 1992 by the Hartford Whalers , and right_wing Ramil Gusmanov , picked 93rd last year by the Jets . Not drafted but sure to grab the attention of NHL general_managers is center Georgy Yevtyukin , 23 , who was voted the most_valuable_player on the Izvestia Cup championship team . Another difference from past Russian teams is the diversity on the roster . Moscow Dynamo and the Central Red Army teams used to supply the majority of the Olympic players , but there ' s now a mix from outside Moscow . Many play for Chelyabinsk and Spartak , but Chimik , Togliatti and Krylja Sovetov also contributed players . &quot; There ' s an incredible amount of hockey talent over here , &quot; Mark Kelley , a scout who is part of a partnership between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Central Red Army team , told the Ottawa Citizen . &quot; They have some tremendous players . I don ' t see any falling_off in ability at the junior level from 10 years ago. &quot; The Russian junior team was third in the World Junior Championships in December , but it went_to the unusual extreme of asking two players to come_back from North_America for the tournament . Right_wing Valeri Bure , brother of the Canucks ' Pavel Bure and a second-round pick by Montreal in the ' 92 draft , and left wing Maxim Bets were playing for Spokane of the Western Hockey_League when they were invited to play for Russia . Bure was named to the tournament all-star team . It ' s a measure of the talent Tikhonov believes he has that Bure and Bets aren ' t on the Russian Olympic squad . Nor is Oleg Tverdovsky , a dynamic 17-year-old defenseman whom the NHL ' s Central Scouting Bureau rated the best European player available in the June draft . Nor is left wing Alexander Kharlamov , son of the late Valeri Kharlamov , who was ranked behind Tverdovsky on Central Scouting ' s list . Of the bureau ' s top 20 Europeans eligible for the June draft , six are Russian . Those players will skate for Russia in 1998 , if not before , and they promise to continue the great Soviet-Russian hockey tradition . that ' s unless the economic_crisis battering Russia eats any further into the hockey program . Teams are drawing few fans and are having difficulty meeting day-to-day operating_costs since the political_system collapsed and government funding evaporated , and Kelley , who is based in Moscow , noted players using old , hand-me-down equipment . &quot; It ' s like a crop , &quot; Kelley said . &quot; You can always have great seeds , but you ' ve got_to water it and care_for it or it will just wither away. &quot;</TEXT>
