   <HEADLINE> HIJACKERS HAD PUT DYNAMITE ON FRENCH JET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The four Muslim extremists killed by French paramilitary forces Monday had planted dynamite in the Air France jetliner they hijacked , apparently intending to at least threaten to blow_up the plane carrying them and 170 hostages as it flew over Paris , French investigators said Tuesday . About 20 sticks of dynamite connected to detonators were found in bunches under one seat near the cockpit and under another in the midsection of the wide-body Airbus A-300 . That was enough , said French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua , &quot; to blow the plane to bits in mid-flight. &quot; The revelation offered the first strong evidence of the ultimate goal of the hijackers , who commandeered the Paris-bound airplane on the airport tarmac in Algeria ' s capital Saturday and were killed 54 hours later in Marseilles in a daring French police commando raid in which 25 people were injured . And it suggested the lengths to which the hijackers , members of the Armed Islamic Group fighting the military-backed government in Algeria , were willing to carry their demand that France end its support for the Algerian regime . Throughout the standoff in Marseilles , where the plane arrived before dawn Monday , French negotiators had refused to meet the hijackers ' demand that the jet be refueled and allowed to fly to Paris . Pasqua said Tuesday that authorities had strong suspicions , after receiving an anonymous tip from a caller to a French consulate in Algeria and questioning some of the 63 hostages released Saturday , that the heavily armed hijackers had dynamite and planned &quot; a suicide mission over Paris. &quot; The authorities also were suspicious of the hijackers ' request for nearly three times the amount of fuel that would be necessary to fly to Paris . Early Monday , Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur and Pasqua decided that the only option was to keep the plane in Marseilles and use the elite &quot; intervention force &quot; of the national police to end the standoff . The hijackers , who already had killed three hostages in Algiers , had set a 5 p.m. deadline Monday for being allowed to fly to Paris , where they said they wanted to hold a news_conference . So determined were French authorities to keep the plane on the ground in Marseilles that they offered to take television crews on board &quot; so ( the hijackers ) could make their declarations , &quot; Pasqua told a news_conference . But shortly after 5 p.m. , when one of the hijackers pointed a weapon out a cockpit window and fired at the control_tower , the black-uniformed police moved_in , killing the gunmen and freeing the hostages in a seven-minute operation . Officials said Tuesday that they weren ' t sure whether the hijackers would have carried_out the suicide mission . But they said the guerrillas may have intended to use the threat of detonating those explosives in a fuel-laden plane , over a metropolitan area of 8 million , to press the_French government to withdraw support for the rulers in its former colony . Meanwhile , the violence in Algeria continued Tuesday when four Roman_Catholic priests , three French and one Belgian , were killed by assailants that the Algerian government said are Islamic fundamentalist guerrillas . The four priests , members of an order known as the White Fathers , were shot to death in Tizi Ouzou , 70 miles east of Algiers . The assailants escaped , and no group has yet claimed responsibility for the shootings . The most radical anti-foreigner guerrillas battling to install Islamic rule_in Algeria are members of the hijackers ' organization , the Armed Islamic Group , or GIA . It says it wants to purge the North African_nation -- which won independence in 1962 after 114 years of French colonial rule -- of Western influences . And it has repeatedly pressed the_French government to halt its economic and political support of the Algerian regime , which seized power by force three years ago when an Islamic party won the first round of parliamentary elections . Since then , an estimated 10 # 000 to 20 # 000 people have been killed , many in clashes between the Algerian government and Islamic fundamentalists . Of more_than 70 foreigners killed , 24 have been French expatriates . President Francois Mitterrand held a reception Tuesday in Paris to honor the 50-member police unit that freed the hostages , and he expressed &quot; the nation ' s gratitude &quot; for its actions . Earlier , officers were applauded by hostage families awaiting the return of their loved ones at Orly Airport outside Paris . Of those injured in the raid , 16 were passengers and crew_members and nine were police_officers . Eight of the police had gunshot wounds , and one lost several fingers on his right_hand in a grenade explosion . Meanwhile , France ' s top terrorist prosecutor began interviewing the hostages . And the leader of the hijackers was identified by the police Tuesday as Abdallah Yahia , head of one of the more militant cells of the GIA . The hijacking marked the most serious intrusion of the Algerian conflict in France , which is home to about 1 million Algerians . In the past 15 months , police have stepped_up their efforts to identify supporters of the Algerian guerrilla movements in France and have expelled several dozen suspected terrorists . Human_rights groups have complained , though , that the crackdown has given police a free hand to harass all foreigners of color . Although France recognizes the Algerian government , it has urged that country ' s leaders to negotiate with the militants .</TEXT>
