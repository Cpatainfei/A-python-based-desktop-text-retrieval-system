   <TEXT> The post-Cold War era is tough on U.S. allies . When Clinton_Administration officials said &quot; time is up &quot; and figura tively drew_a_line in the sand against intolerable international behavior , they were not threatening unilateral action against the gang of Haitians who prevented U.S. troops from landing in Haiti to help implement a U.S.-brokered agreement transferring power from military to civilian authorities . Or the North_Korean government that , despite agreeing to international inspections of seven nuclear facilities , continues to dodge questions about its nuclear-weapons capability and ambitions . No , the Clinton_Administration was targeting a Japanese leader who has opened_up his country ' s rice and construction markets , adopted a huge economic-stimulus plan to encourage more Japanese imports and who has committed himself to deregulating his economy and initiating major political reform . The press_conference after the failed talks between President Bill_Clinton and Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa did nothing to dispel this impression . Although Clinton was gracious , even effusive , in his praise of Hosokawa , the President made_it clear that he has reached the end of his patience with Japan . The subsequent U.S. threat to impose sanctions unless Japan fully opens its cellular-phone market , official hints of renewing the Super 301 provision , which mandates retaliation against trading practices that the United States deems &quot; unfair , &quot; and the implicit warning to drive_up the value of the yen as a means of reducing Japan ' s trade surplus -- all underscore the Administration ' s determination to alter the status_quo . These developments , coming immediately after Clinton ' s public call_for a &quot; period of reflection , &quot; also suggest that the Administration has come_to see a hard-line stance on Japan as something of a &quot; win-win &quot; situation : Either Japanese leaders cave_in to U.S. demands for specific import targets and numerical indicators of progress in opening the Japanese market , or Clinton gains stature and credibility with the American public for hanging tough . This suggests a second lesson : Slamming Japan is good politics . Both lessons are products of long-evident changes . The collapse of the Soviet_Union and end of the Cold_War not only removed the sense of common threat but also weakened the glue cementing U.S.-Japan relations . The advent of global economic interdependence linked the creation of domestic jobs directly to the behavior of America ' s key trading partners . And the increased U.S. dependence on trade and exports for stimulating domestic economic_growth boosted the importance of opening the Japanese market . Cumulatively , these changes did not so_much relegate strategic issues to a back burner as they made critical domestic imperatives key strategic objectives . Most analysts agree that the overwhelming share of the U.S. trade_deficit is caused by macroeconomic factors . They also agree that structural differences between the U.S. and Japanese economies are at the heart of bilateral economic tensions . Addressing these differences will necessarily be a time-consuming process . Even so , it is striking how slow Japan has been in responding . The dominant U.S. inclination is to ascribe this slowness to the power of Japan ' s bureaucracy and the unwillingness of Japanese political_leaders to compel change . While there is some truth to this explanation , a number of underlying factors appear more salient : * Principles . No matter how packaged , U.S. insistence on &quot; objective criteria &quot; and &quot; numerical indicators &quot; for measuring progress in opening Japan ' s markets comes_across to Japanese as managed trade . Nearly universal Japanese opposition to this approach has enabled the government to claim the moral high ground and bolstered bureaucratic and political opposition to U.S. pressure . The Administration ' s inability to redefine the issue in terms that could enlist greater public support in Japan may represent the single greatest failure in U.S. policy . * Distrust . Japan ' s &quot; principled &quot; opposition to managed trade is bolstered by its semiconductor experience : A specified goal was transformed into a minimum level of_imports that had to be reached to avoid U.S. sanctions . Underlying this experience , however , are years of mounting resentment of what many Japanese , rightly or wrongly , perceive to be U.S. unilateralism and highhandedness on trade issues , which make Japanese suspicion more resistant to persuasion . * Recession . It was the misfortune of the Clinton_Administration to present its demands for greater shares of Japan ' s markets at precisely the time when the Japanese economy is going_through a long and deep recession . Whatever willingness Japanese companies might have had in the days of growth and prosperity to consider voluntary import arrangements , their enthusiasm for affirmative-action programs at a time of low domestic growth and strong pressures on Japanese exports is clearly minimal . * Competitive politics . The establishment of a new coalition government in Japan signified more_than the defeat of the Liberal Democratic Party . It marked the advent of competitive politics , with its emphasis on public persuasion and ad_hoc alliances . Together with Hosokawa ' s weak political base , the end of single-party rule has both complicated consensus-building and exacerbated the task of implementing political change . All this may suggest a third lesson : A weak Japan is not a strong U.S. partner . What happens next ? The most likely outcome remains some sort of compromise . Both sides agree that there must be some means for measuring progress in expanding foreign access , and the high stakes weigh against a major rupture . In the end , Japan will exert maximum efforts to reach an accommodation , because the United States is central to Japanese interests . These efforts are likely to involve the implementation of market-opening measures already proposed in U.S.-Japan discussions , along with plans to stimulate and further deregulate the Japanese economy . Japan will strive to avoid tit-for-tat retaliation , although it may well initiate actions under the General_Agreement on Tariff and Trade against any U.S. sanctions . New efforts to find a term other_than numerical targets are likely . Tentative indications that the U.S. might not insist on guaranteed market shares and specific sales numbers if some_other means of tracking Japanese performance is developed suggest a possible resolution . But the danger should not be underestimated . Already , charges of &quot; betrayal &quot; and &quot; bad faith &quot; are heard . The slope leading to souring relations is that much slippery . Underlying forces in both societies make political paralysis in Tokyo and gridlock between Japan and the United States a real possibility . A ratcheting up of tensions and some form of trade war cannot be ruled_out . Even if the current impasse is surmounted , however , the collapse of the framework negotiations raises a number of longer-term questions . Is it possible to maintain a mutually advantageous relation in an environment where either of the parties sees at least temporary political payoffs from its deterioration ? Can we move away from defining U.S.-Japan relations so singularly in terms of trade and approach the relationship as a critical means of extending our global interests ? As we look_to the 21st Century , what kind of world do we want to see develop and what role do U.S.-Japan ties play in facilitating its development ? Once U.S. officials get done patting themselves on their backs for having avoided a &quot; bad &quot; agreement , and Japanese leaders get_over their rush at having finally &quot; said no &quot; to Uncle_Sam , they should address such questions. *</TEXT>
