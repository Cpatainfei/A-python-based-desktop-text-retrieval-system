   <HEADLINE> CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE : YOUR MONEY ; ARBITRATORS UNFAIR , CAR OWNERS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Less than one-fifth of Toyota , Lexis and Porsche owners who participated in a program to resolve warranty disputes in 1993 thought they were treated fairly , a survey shows . The program , administered by the American Automobile Assn. , has been discontinued . As previously reported , AAA said it decided to get_out of the arbitration business to focus resources on activities that served its members . The decision came as regulators in Florida and California questioned the fairness of the AAA program . According to the survey , 19 % of the car owners using the arbitration program thought they were treated fairly and 63 % of participants said they did not get the award they wanted . The survey was conducted by the California Arbitration Review Board , which each year asks participants ' opinions of state-certified arbitration programs . Arbitration programs are intended to settle warranty disputes without costly lawsuits . An arbitrator may order the manufacturer to replace or repair a vehicle under warranty or to offer the consumer restitution . The arbitrator may also deny the claim or propose some_other settlement . The process is binding on the manufacturer but not on the consumer , who may go_to court if dissatisfied . Ford owners were the group most satisfied with arbitration . According to the survey , 47 % who went_through arbitration thought the process was fair and received the results they were looking_for . The survey found that 35 % of General Motors owners thought arbitrators had treated them fairly . The Better Business Bureau runs the GM program , and it tends to mediate a high percentage of cases before they reach arbitration . One-quarter of Chrysler owners said the arbitrators were fair . The survey comes as the Legislature is considering a bill that would replace manufacturers ' programs with a state-run board . A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the bill is scheduled for Tuesday . * Shock around the clock : Talk_about scaring up business . In mail solicitations for its accidental-death policy , Allstate Insurance Co . traces the steps of a make-believe guy , A.J. Smith , as he narrowly escapes disaster 20 times . Among A.J. ' s close encounters : He is nearly killed crossing a street and feels threatened when a fired co-worker returns to the office to argue . A.J. ' s family is accident-prone . His wife nearly strikes a lamppost while driving . An electric_socket at_home is overloaded . A.J. ' s kids gulp their food and risk choking -- no doubt because they know the wiring is about to blow . We can only hope that after such a charmed day , A.J. doesn ' t settle into his recliner and croak from a heart_attack . The accidental-death policy would n ' t cover him then . Which brings us to what we see as the moral of this story : Accidental death policies are inexpensive because coverage is limited . Premium dollars are_better spent on life_insurance , which also covers accidental deaths . * Sounding the alarm : The cost of having a security alarm service is likely to go_up as a result of telephone rate increases tentatively approved by the California Public_Utilities Commission . Alan L . Pepper , an attorney representing the California Alarm Assn. , said the state ' s security alarm industry expects its costs to rise by $ 15 million to $ 20 million a year if the PUC adopts the rate increases next month . Pepper said the biggest increases will come_in private-line services , in which the security company leases a separate dedicated phone_line for each alarm_system it monitors . High-risk establishments such_as jewelry_stores , drugstores and government_agencies use private-line services . For GTE customers , for example , installation_charges for a private_line are expected to jump to $ 253.87 from $ 92 . Monthly charges would triple to $ 18.08 from $ 6 . Residential customers whose alarm services run_on their regular phone_lines may see a small boost in security charges because local phone rates are also rising , Pepper said . * Holding the line : How ' s this for encouragement ? In mailings offering customers a $ 20 discount on phone installation , Pacific Bell warns that &quot; installation_charges may increase substantially as a result of rate proceedings currently under review by the California Public_Utilities Commission. &quot; The warning appears outdated . In a tentative ruling issued last month , the PUC turned_down PacBell ' s request to raise installation rates . They are expected to remain at $ 34.75 for each residential line and $ 70.75 for each business_line . The discount offer expires Aug . 14 . How They Did... The state Arbitration Review Board examined how arbitrators settled auto warranty disputes in 1993 . New-car owners can seek arbitration of disputes over defects or repairs if they are dissatisfied with the dealer ' s response . The state-monitored program is intended to head_off costly lawsuits . 05 # 28 , 06 # 07 , 10 # 06 Decision AAA * BBB * * Chrysler Ford Replacement or restitution 12 % 21 % 30 % 39 % Repair 20 43 25 33 No relief 64 35 26 23 Other -- 4 16 -- * American Automobile Assn . hears disputes for Toyota and Porsche . * * Better Business Bureau arbitrates disputes for General Motors and Nissan .
