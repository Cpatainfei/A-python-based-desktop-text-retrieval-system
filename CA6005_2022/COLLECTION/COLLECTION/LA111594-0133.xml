   <HEADLINE> FORCED_OUT OF FIRE ACADEMY , WOMEN SAY ; HIRING : EX-RECRUITS CONTEND THAT AN AUDIT ACCURATELY DESCRIBES HARASSMENT INTENDED TO MAKE THEM QUIT THE CITY DEPARTMENT . AN ASSISTANT CHIEF DISPUTES THE INQUIRY ' S FINDINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even after she reported that she had pulled a muscle in her back , then-fire recruit Diane Cameron said the drill_instructor ordered her to repeatedly lift a heavy ladder as he ridiculed her and the other women trainees . They were too weak and didn ' t have what it took_to_be firefighters in the Los Angeles City Fire_Department , he allegedly said . &quot; They made my life and other females ' lives miserable , &quot; said Cameron , 27 , a 5-foot-10-inch , 160-pound athlete who filed a state discrimination complaint against the department last month . &quot; They basically ran us off the department. &quot; In the past seven years , about 40 % of women recruits washed_out of the Fire_Department ' s training academy , where they were reportedly &quot; weeded_out &quot; by instructors who treated them more harshly than male recruits and relied_on &quot; subjective &quot; evaluations , a city audit found . The findings of the 225-page Personnel_Department audit -- one of the most critical evaluations ever made of the Fire_Department -- were disclosed Saturday by The Times . The audit said widespread cronyism , nepotism and racial discrimination were believed responsible_for the department ' s inability to integrate its top-level administration , which is 95 % white male . The audit found that the training academy -- where recruits are drilled_in the physical and technical aspects of firefighting during an intensive , 15-week course -- was the focal_point of problems in a department that has had difficulty retaining women and minorities . Women make_up only 3 % of the 3 # 100-member department . The percentage of women who quit the academy or were fired was about twice the rate of male recruits , according to the audit , which will be released Wednesday at a hearing of the City_Council ' s Personnel Committee . In 1984 , the academy was restructured to allow recruits who were having trouble to repeat training instead of being fired . But that helped fuel resentment among many white firefighters , who felt that training standards were lowered , and who tried to run rookie women and minorities out of the department , the report said . Since 1986 , attrition_rates for minorities -- especially African Americans -- have been higher than those for white males . About 33 % of all black firefighters hired in that period have left the department -- twice the percentage of white firefighters , according to Fire_Department data . &quot; Attrition_rates at the academy and during the remainder of probation need to be analyzed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the department is not only applying job-related performance standards , but is doing all it can to ' encourage ' rather than ' weed_out ' recruits , &quot; said the draft audit . Assistant Chief Dean E . Cathey , a department spokesman , disputed the audit ' s findings Monday , saying he has spoken with many women firefighters and never received complaints about abusive treatment in the academy or firehouses . &quot; To a person , I ' ve never had one tell me that they have a lousy work environment , &quot; he said . However , the three council_members who serve on the Personnel Committee said Monday that they have received numerous complaints from current women firefighters who are afraid to speak out for fear of retaliation . &quot; The level of fear of coming_forward by women on the Fire_Department is much higher than women on the Police_Department , &quot; said Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg , the committee chairwoman , who has studied sexual_harassment in the city ' s work_force . Goldberg , who said the failure rate for women is &quot; a cause of grave concern , &quot; noted that her office has received about two_dozen complaints since the audit ' s findings were reported in The Times . &quot; I think that the department leadership has to understand that there is an atmosphere of intimidation in the Fire_Department , &quot; Councilman Mike Hernandez said . Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said he was approached in_person Sunday by a number of firefighters commenting on the audit . &quot; They were just relieved that the issue has finally seen the light of day , &quot; he said , &quot; and in more_than one instance , indicated that the situation is worse that the report said. &quot; Assistant Chief Cathey faulted women who complain anonymously for not coming_forward . &quot; People who complain about discrimination privately and not publicly probably get what they deserve . . . because nothing will change , &quot; he said . The main reason women fail in the academy , Cathey said , is that they lack the physical strength to do tasks such_as lifting ladders and pulling heavy hoses . Women selected for the academy must pass the same physical skills test as men , but Cathey said that exam is not rigid enough to accurately assess whether a candidate has the strength needed for the job . The Personnel_Department is currently reviewing all hiring procedures for firefighter candidates . Women in the academy , according to interviews with former recruits and findings in the audit , were treated more harshly and drilled harder than their male counterparts . In Diane Cameron ' s 1993 class , in which 28 of the 64 recruits were women , she said minority women were treated the worst , followed by white_women , then minority men . Of the women , 11 quit or were fired before graduation . &quot; There was such an atmosphere of intimidation there , &quot; said Cameron , who added that the &quot; macho &quot; mentality among some of the instructors was &quot; like a high_school football_team gone crazy. &quot; She and other female recruits said they were constantly told that they did not belong in the fire service , ordered to repeat tasks such_as raising ladders more_than men , and subjected_to insensitive remarks such_as : &quot; You have hearts of an eagle , but bodies of a pigeon , &quot; and , &quot; You ' re like European sports_cars . You run_on high r.p.m. ' s but need continuous maintenance. &quot; In her complaint filed Oct . 13 with the state Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , Cameron alleges that she was told she would be terminated within two days if her back did not heal from the pulled-muscle injury caused by raising ladders . * Hurt physically and emotionally , Cameron said , she quit rather than face termination . &quot; I was totally depressed and ended_up getting an ulcer , &quot; said Cameron , an avid surfer and weightlifter who is still trying to become a firefighter with other departments . &quot; But in a way , I was kind of glad to leave . Who wants to spend 20 years in that kind of environment ? &quot; Kay Harter , 22 , who was in Cameron ' s class , walked_out two weeks before graduation because of what she says was the constant abuse . She , too , filed a discrimination complaint with the state last month . &quot; It was a living hell . It was the worst experience I have ever been through in my entire life , &quot; said Harter , who last week set a women ' s record for the physical agility test administered by the Ventura County Fire_Department . &quot; They kept saying I was going_to be fired . I finally had it and walked_off , &quot; said Harter , who claims she was treated even worse after she complained that a male recruit was making constant sexual remarks . Harter recalled one particularly disturbing incident allegedly involving a black female recruit . As the woman put_on a protective face_mask , a white fire instructor took a puff from his cigar , blew the smoke into a hose leading to the recruit ' s mask and plugged the end with his hand . He then laughed while the woman gagged and said , &quot; that ' s so you know what it ( smoke ) feels_like , &quot; Harter said . A male recruit in the same class who was quoted in the Personnel_Department ' s audit also reported that women were treated differently than the men . He said all_the recruits were reminded daily by the instructors that it was the worst class instructors had ever taught because half the students were women . The class became polarized , the male recruit said . &quot; It became male vs . female . If one of the females needed extra help or something , it was the females that helped. &quot; Cathey said the department offers personal strength training for women during recruitment to prepare them for the department ' s physical agility test . And to improve attrition_rates , the Fire_Department completely revamped the training academy curriculum in 1993 with the help of outside advisers . The new techniques have reduced male attrition_rates this year from about 20 % to 12 % . But the failure rate for women increased to 56 % . Cathey said he was not sure why the percentage increased . Fire_Chief Donald O . Manning last week proposed a $ 2-million department reorganization that would create a 17-person human resources bureau to study ways of improving retention rates for women and minorities and improve tracking of discrimination and harassment complaints .</TEXT>
