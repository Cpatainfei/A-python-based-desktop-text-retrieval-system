   <HEADLINE> S . AFRICA TO PROBE ABUSES , OFFER AMNESTY ; HUMAN_RIGHTS : PANEL TO FOCUS_ON RECONCILIATION . THOSE WHO CONFESS TO POLITICAL CRIMES WILL BE PARDONED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An official commission will investigate state-sanctioned murders and the catalogue of other human_rights abuses committed under apartheid , this nation ' s African National Congress-led government decided Tuesday . But eager to allay fears within South_Africa ' s security_forces of Nuremberg-style trials , officials also offered a new amnesty for politically motivated crimes to those who are prepared to confess before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission . Justice Minister Dullah Omar said the commission will focus_on reconciliation efforts , highlighting victims ' suffering as well as perpetrators ' responsibilities . &quot; The fundamental issue for all South_Africans is to come_to terms with our past on the only moral basis possible -- namely , that the truth be told and that the truth be acknowledged , &quot; Omar said . &quot; We cannot forgive on behalf of victims . The identity of the victims and what happened to them and the identity of perpetrators must be made known. &quot; He said the commission will investigate abuses by both the state and liberation movements , including the ANC . But he argued that the two are not comparable . &quot; I do not and will not equate those who fought in the struggle against apartheid with those who participated in all kinds of activities in_order to keep apartheid in place , &quot; he said . &quot; I do not see the two sides as having the same moral claims. &quot; The panel ' s precise mandate will not be defined until the government presents legislation to Parliament later this month . Besides investigating the assassinations of prominent individuals and the torture of those in police custody , human_rights lawyers say the commission could be expected to take_up issues such_as mass detentions during the state of emergency and involvement by security_forces in massacres , such_as the killings of 39 in Boipatong in June , 1992 . That incident led the ANC to suspend its negotiations with the white government . Human_rights groups are pressing for the commission to examine apartheid ' s broader harm -- abuses such_as the forced removal of blacks from their land , a deed that the whites-only Parliament deemed legal but the United Nations declared a crime against humanity . More_than 3 million blacks were driven from their homes to desolate areas called &quot; homelands. &quot; Victims groups see the Truth Commission as a mechanism to restore their land rights or obtain compensation . But some victims fear that the government plan for the commission will sacrifice full disclosure of the truth -- including names of those responsible_for crimes -- in favor of reconciliation . Exposing the past threatens to conflict with President Nelson Mandela ' s efforts to win the confidence of whites who still dominate the economy and the hierarchy of the security_forces . If the commission were given a free hand , a large proportion of those implicated in political murders and other abuses are likely to be Afrikaners in the police and army ; revelations about them , some in the ANC fear , could destabilize the security_forces . Full disclosure could also be expected to implicate white members of the former administration who are part of the new government of national unity . Similarly , delving into the role of Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi ' s Inkatha Freedom Party in political violence might spark new rounds of killing . And an investigation of the ANC role in township violence -- including the notorious &quot; necklace &quot; killings in which victims were burnt alive -- and abuses in its Angolan prison_camps could prove embarrassing to Defense Minister Joe Modise , among others . The ANC came under increasing pressure from victims , human_rights lawyers and its own supporters to investigate apartheid crimes after the government -- in an effort to promote reconciliation -- said it planned to grant amnesty to many of those convicted of political crimes . Omar said the government still plans to go_ahead with its amnesty for those convicted of political crimes , or indemnity for those facing charges . But it will require a confession to the commission . While white segregationist political_parties and paramilitary groups have demanded the unconditional release of their supporters held for politically motivated crimes , human_rights activists have argued that a blanket amnesty would remove the incentive to testify before the commission . Omar also said there would be no amnesty for crimes committed after Dec . 5 , 1993 , when a power-sharing administration was installed . That means that the killers of Chris Hani , a top leader of the ANC and Communist_Party , and Amy Biehl , an American Fulbright scholar , could be eligible for an amnesty if their crimes were deemed politically motivated . But unless Mandela exercises his presidential prerogative , that rules_out the release of 36 neo-Nazis accused in election-week bombings that killed 21 . There were further calls_for a Truth Commission last week after an inquest concluded that Matthew Goniwe , a prominent anti-apartheid activist , and three colleagues were murdered in 1985 on state orders . Judge Neville Zietsman said a secret army signal ordering Goniwe ' s &quot; permanent removal from society &quot; was his death_warrant . But the judge said he could not prove that Gen . Joffel van der Westhuizen , the officer who ordered the signal , was responsible_for the killings . Goniwe ' s outraged widow , Nyameka , said the judge ' s decision made the case for why South_Africa needs a full accounting of its past . &quot; I can ' t forgive and forget , or go_on with my life , until I know the actual killers , &quot; she said . &quot; We cannot close this chapter yet. &quot;</TEXT>
