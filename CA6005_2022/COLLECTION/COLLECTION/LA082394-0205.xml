   <TEXT> Think encyclopedias and you think_of Oxford dons in flowing gowns and the tweedy world of New York publishing . But what you really should be thinking is : Redmond , Wash . that ' s the home of Microsoft Corp. , whose Encarta CD-ROM encyclopedia , replete with video and sound , has become the world ' s best-selling encyclopedia in its first year on the market . The sudden ascendance of Encarta is more_than just another indication that the electronic information age has arrived . To many , it ' s a sign of a changing intellectual landscape , one in which the information-technology outposts of the West are quietly becoming hubs of thought and creativity as well . &quot; New York used to be the center of the information industry , &quot; says Tom Corddry , one of Microsoft ' s multimedia gurus . &quot; But electronic publishing could be based on the West Coast. &quot; Consider Encarta . The encyclopedia has already made Microsoft a major player in the knowledge business , giving it a pivotal role in deciding just what these essential references contain , how they behave and what they do . Encarta is so successful that Microsoft , whose forte has been computer_programs , doesn ' t just create the coding for the CD-ROM . It also hires writers , editors and artists to produce original material , then handles distribution . In other words , the medium doesn ' t only help shape the message . It also helps determine from where the message comes . Nobody is saying New York is about to disappear as a center of ideas , or that Los Angeles will soon lose its grip on movie and TV production . But there are strong signs that changing technologies are starting to redraw the nation ' s cultural map . &quot; Just like painters had to be in New York in the ' 60s and Paris in the ' 20s , if you want to rub ( your ) mind with people in these disciplines , you have to be &quot; in the West , says Bob Bell , a professor at San Francisco State University ' s multimedia center , which offers courses to thousands of professionals each year . &quot; You are getting painters , artists , writers , designers moving here because of employment opportunities , &quot; Bell says . New media technologies are evolving extremely rapidly . Taking_advantage of the latest advances requires close interaction among musicians , artists , writers and computer_experts . The technical wizards and creative professionals most attuned to the new media tend to be concentrated in the West Coast ' s major metropolitan centers -- notably the San Francisco Bay Area , the Northwest and Southern California . &quot; It ' s an exciting time and place . We ' re shaping something new , &quot; says Amy Satron , who recently left Apple Computer to develop multimedia texts for Wadsworth Publishing , a San Francisco textbook company . The concentration of talent &quot; is leading to outcomes that would n ' t otherwise be possible , &quot; says Satron , whose husband is working_on a multimedia product for Amnesty International , the human_rights watchdog group . Of the 4 # 500 members of the International Interactive Communications Society , a group of multimedia professionals based in Beaverton , Ore. , close to half are in San Francisco or Los Angeles . New York has 357 members . This melding of the technically literate and the artistically inclined is generating a cultural phenomenon some like to call techno-bohemian -- techno-boho , for short . It ' s a peculiar amalgam of 1960s hippiedom and 1980s capitalism , suffused with the very 1990s notion that technology is making_possible entirely new forms of artistic expression . Richard Haukom , a San Francisco-based multimedia producer , finds the term techno-boho pretentious . But he sees in the local multimedia community a broad recognition of the new medium ' s expressive power . The ability to mix words , sounds and images , and give people the power to control them in novel ways , he says , also has great potential for social good . &quot; Some see multimedia as a literary_genre ; some will use it as an art_form , &quot; he says . &quot; I think it ' s the most phenomenal educational technology ever invented. &quot; Migrations of talent have occurred throughout history as national fortunes changed and technologies evolved . Driven by the desire for more clear days for shooting , the American movie_industry moved west from New York generations ago , dragging a goodly sum of intellectual capital in its wake . Beginning in the 1920s , waves of writers -- including Hemingway , Faulkner and Fitzgerald -- were drawn by the high pay and excitement of Hollywood . Today , of the 11 # 000 members of the Writers Guild -- the union that covers movies , television and radio -- 7 # 500 live_on the West Coast , about 5 # 600 of them in Los Angeles . And , although publishing and the fine_arts remain based in New York City , the rise of universities as patrons of the arts long ago dispersed writers and other creative talent around the country . By their nature , the newer , more outdoorsy and less densely populated cities of the West do not have the intellectual maturity or intensity of Paris or New York in their heyday . Perhaps they never will . But they are cultural centers of a different sort , drawing energy from technological innovation and social change rather than from tradition . More like Hollywood than Greenwich_Village , these communities are driven as much by a desire for worldly success and a search for a better quality_of_life as by the yearning for artistic fulfillment . Multimedia companies find cities in the West have_the_best selection of people with both technical and artistic talent . Compton ' s NewMedia , formerly a subsidiary of Britannica and now owned by the Chicago Tribune Co. , established itself in Carlsbad , north of San Diego , rather than at its parent ' s base in Chicago . &quot; How many people would be willing to move to Chicago ? &quot; Tom McGrew , Compton ' s vice_president of marketing development and product planning , asks rhetorically . Southern California was ideal , he says , because of the graphic designers , musicians and cartoonists attached_to the movie_industry . A new multimedia title called &quot; Rescue the Scientist , &quot; for example , will feature a television_star to help in the marketing battle for scarce shelf space . &quot; We want programmers with an aesthetic sense , &quot; says Greg Roach , who recently moved his multimedia company , Hyperbole , to Seattle from Houston . His recent hires in Seattle include a programmer who is also a sculptor and another who is a drummer in a rock_band . A former playwright , Roach began working in new media after he found himself writing plays that involved sets exploding into flames and other fantastic scenes he could not afford to produce . &quot; In the computer I can do all those things , &quot; says Roach , who is widely recognized as a leader in_advancing multimedia as an art_form . One recent morning , Roach was in a small studio on the edge of the city directing three actors through his next interactive movie , a futuristic story in which the Earth ' s survival depends_on mining of a rare material that would require destroying the native tribe of a faraway planet . The only set was a backdrop painted cobalt_blue . A sci-fi city would be &quot; created &quot; -- programmed in later -- using computer modeling tools . The setup may look amateurish and the script is sometimes hackneyed , but Roach is convinced that the new medium will find a major place in the pantheon of high culture . &quot; It ' s a ' B ' interactive movie , &quot; Roach admits . &quot; But we are positioning ourselves ; we are learning the craft. &quot; Artists are not the only ones moving to where the action is . East Coast publishers , afraid of being left_behind , are testing the waters by buying_up or pairing up with technology companies in the West . Random House and Novato , Calif.-based Broderbund Software are in a joint_venture to publish interactive children ' s books . The venture combines Broderbund ' s production skills with Random House ' s library , which includes the Dr. Seuss , &quot; Berenstain Bears &quot; and &quot; Babar &quot; series of children ' s books . The Washington Post Co . recently purchased Mammoth Micro Productions , the Seattle firm that helped put_together a quarterly version of the Post ' s Newsweek magazine on CD-ROM . With their control over what ' s known in the trade as &quot; content , &quot; publishers still have the potential of pulling the focus of multimedia development back to their home base in New York . But their success depends_on their ability to translate print-based products into the electronic medium . So far , the New York publishers have been largely unsuccessful , criticized instead for producing &quot; shovelware &quot; that does little more_than dump printed words onto CD-ROM discs with the addition of a_few pictures . Books such_as Michael Crichton ' s &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; that are put_on CD-ROM with added pictures and sound -- or &quot; repurposed &quot; -- have not sold well . &quot; If you can buy ( Dr. Seuss ' ) ' One Fish , Two Fish ' for $ 6.99 ( in print ) , would you pay $ 49.95 for the CD-ROM ? &quot; asks Shelley Day , chief_executive at Humongous Entertainment , a Seattle company that produces a successful series of original children ' s titles . Tradition-bound publishers -- many still insist that writers submit manuscripts on paper instead of on computer disk -- tend to be slow to adapt to new technology , putting them at a disadvantage . &quot; It used to take them two years to get a book out , &quot; recalls Rick Smolan , a former Time photographer , who used to publish his &quot; Day in the Life &quot; coffee_table picture_books from an office in New York . When Smolan approached his New York publishers years ago about developing CD-ROMs , they gave him a blank look . &quot; They all have directors of multimedia , but few are doing anything , &quot; he says . Now , Smolan uses the latest in computer equipment to publish his books in five months . They are accompanied by CD-ROM titles that allow readers to more fully explore the themes . Some people still find New York alluring . &quot; There ' s a greater concentration of writers , artists and musicians ; it ' s a richer soup , &quot; says Robert Stein , development director at Voyager , a multimedia company that recently moved to New York from Santa Monica . &quot; San Francisco is all hardware and money. &quot; And as new technology makes_it easier for non-technical people to develop multimedia titles , the multimedia business may become more dispersed . In the long_run , the staying power of these new multimedia centers depends_on the future of the technology and society ' s ultimate desire to adapt to a new way of projecting ideas . Some are skeptical . &quot; Books have been around for 400 to 500 years for a good reason , &quot; says Michael Powell , owner of Powell ' s in Portland , Ore. , the nation ' s largest bookstore . &quot; They are hard to improve upon. &quot; Alvin Kernan , a Princeton professor and author of &quot; The Death of Literature , &quot; believes that multimedia will prove to be an extension of television , computers and the other electronic media that have gradually replaced books as sources of information and entertainment -- and he mourns the trend . Although CD-ROMs may evolve into an art_form with more intellectual content than movies or TV , Kernan says , &quot; it won ' t be literature. &quot; &quot; Sitting and reading encourages a complex sense of truth and reality. &quot; With greater use of images in TV , movies and CD-ROMs , he says , &quot; you don ' t need so_much thought to understand what is in front of you. &quot; But others see multimedia ' s ability to transmit ideas and information through the use of interactive programs as an important advantage over print in areas such_as educational texts , reference_works and documentary-style nonfiction . For whatever reason , Americans are turning_to the new medium in huge numbers . Last year , 5.5 million families owned multimedia computers . Simba Information Inc. , a market research and publishing_company in Wilton , Conn. , predicts the number will rise to 17 million by the end of 1995 . CD-ROM title sales , excluding games , quadrupled to $ 300 million last year , according to Dataquest , a San Jose market research firm . It expects sales to triple this year . As multimedia titles become available not only on CD-ROM but also through on-line computer services and eventually interactive television , the number of potential customers for new titles will soar . Economics also favor electronic publishing in important areas . The Encarta encyclopedia , which sells for $ 70 , costs $ 2 per copy to manufacture . A set of the World Book Encyclopedia costs $ 150 to print and huge sums to market and distribute . That means , over time , Microsoft will have more money than its print counterparts to spend on commissioning fresh work from artists and writers . Microsoft has long been buying_up rights to artwork around the world to use with its products . So far , new media titles haven ' t made money for most developers . The average multimedia firm has up_to three people and brings_in revenues under $ 50 # 000 a year , according to a Dataquest survey . Many depend_on corporate presentations for their bread_and_butter . &quot; It ' s like having to waiter to support yourself as an actor , &quot; says Bruce Ryon , principal in_charge of multimedia research at Dataquest . Microsoft , however , has gone straight for the starring role . The company has pledged to produce 100 consumer titles by next year and is investing big money in the business . Programmers accustomed to discipline and logical clarity are paired with ethno-musicologists and designers who deal in the intangible . &quot; You have to go_back and forth between what is desirable and what is possible , &quot; says Corddry , who has found himself mediating between these disparate worlds . &quot; If I were a publishing executive , I would look_at Microsoft and be shaking in my boots , &quot; says Paul Saffo , director of the Menlo Park-based Institute for the Future think_tank . &quot; They have piles of money ; they are motivated to do something in this market , and they are ruthless. &quot;</TEXT>
