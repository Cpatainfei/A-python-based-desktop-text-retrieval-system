   <HEADLINE> ALLIES SALUTE BERLIN FOR THE LAST TIME ; MILITARY : FRENCH , BRITISH AND U.S. TROOPS HOLD MUTED FAREWELL PARADE . DEPARTING RUSSIAN SOLDIERS WERE NOT INCLUDED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nearly 2 # 000 U.S. , French and British soldiers shouldered their rifles and marched for the last time down Berlin ' s monument-studded main boulevard in a farewell parade that provided a muted final chapter to the long saga of the Cold_War . Paratroopers made a farewell jump under a cloudy sky , a World_War II-vintage Dakota zoomed down for a tree-level pass , and bagpipers in kilts and leopard-skin capes played &quot; Scotland the Brave &quot; as they marched past a crowd of applauding Berliners estimated at about 75 # 000 . &quot; For the last 50 years , you and your comrades have been in the front_line of defense of not only the freedom of Berlin but the freedom of Europe , &quot; Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen told the departing soldiers . &quot; Without your commitment , Berlin would not be free and Germany not united. &quot; But for all_the warm words , Saturday ' s parade lacked the trappings that marked military parades in Berlin at the height of the Cold_War , when annual Allied shows of force regularly drew 200 # 000 people . There were no trucks , no armored personnel_carriers , no throngs of pro-U.S. militants wildly waving the Stars and Stripes . &quot; We used to have parades every year back when Germany was divided , but in those times , people used to seem more enthusiastic , &quot; said Peter Beblik , a native Berliner who came_with his wife and small son to watch the parade . &quot; Now people look a little bored. &quot; Nor was there any triumphal march through the Brandenburg Gate -- a lofty , pillared structure that is the symbol of Berlin itself . And , significantly , there were no representatives of the departing Russian army in the parade . Even though the Cold_War has long since been declared over , Berlin is still not ready to let what is left of the Red Army parade down its Strasse Des Siebzehnten Juni with the rest of the World_War_II Allies . About 12 # 000 U.S. , British and French soldiers had been stationed in Berlin in the years leading_up to the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall , compared to the more_than 300 # 000 Red Army troops stationed in East_Germany . The United States , France and Britain began calling their soldiers home_in 1990 as the old Communist threat faded_away , and today about 3 # 000 of the Westerners are left . On Sept . 8 , the last U.S. troops will pull_down the American flag in a suburban compound and make their final departure . The crowd sending them off at Saturday ' s parade consisted mostly of middle-aged and elderly Germans from what used to be West_Berlin -- people eager to express their friendship and gratitude toward the Western Allies . &quot; The Americans are my friends , &quot; said Guenter Fischer , who had climbed atop a telephone switching post for a better view of the parade . &quot; I was born in 1936 . At the end of the war , the Russians occupied my neighborhood and plundered all_of our belongings . They took_away our radios , our bicycles , everything . But then the Americans came_in with their armored vehicles . The Russians had to pull_out , and they weren ' t allowed to take any of our things with them. &quot; Even though many in the crowd echoed Fischer ' s feelings of warmth and appreciation , no one seemed to believe that there was any point in a continued foreign presence in Berlin . &quot; I ' m thankful to the Allies , &quot; said Rainer Schoewe , a western Berliner who brought his two small children to watch Saturday ' s ceremonies . &quot; But I ' m not sad that they ' re leaving . They ' re not necessary anymore . As long as Germany was divided , I was happy that they were here , but now that we are together , as a German , I ' m happy that they are leaving. &quot; The only point where any bitterness arose among the onlookers was in the way the parade ' s German organizers had refused to let the Russian army take_part . It was , after all , the Red Army that captured Berlin in the spring of 1945 , virtually single-handedly , and at a cost of more_than 300 # 000 Soviet lives over three terrible weeks . But in planning its official farewell to the Allies , the Berlin government initially planned to let the Western forces hold a full-fledged military parade -- marching through the Brandenburg Gate and all -- and excluded the Russians entirely , asking them to hold their own goodby party far away in the eastern German town of Weimar . The Russian commander for Germany , Gen . Matvei Burlakov , complained , and the Germans eventually said the Russians could march in Berlin -- but not with the other Allies . To further soothe the Russians , the Germans scaled back the scope of the Western parade , dropping the symbolic Brandenburg Gate segment from the route . The compromise , and the way it fails to acknowledge the Soviets ' 1945 role as Berlin ' s liberators , has left some deeply wounded feelings , particularly on the part of East_Germans , who believe that their part of Germany has been mistreated by western Germany since unification . &quot; Maybe I ' m biased , but I don ' t like this , &quot; said Manfred Behrens , who traveled_to Berlin from a small_town in former East_Germany to watch the Allies march . &quot; East_Germany didn ' t consist_of 17 million enemies of the Russians . If all 17 million East_Germans had hated the Russians so_much , there would have been a revolution much earlier . There are many people who just don ' t want to recognize this fact. &quot;</TEXT>
