   <HEADLINE> QUESTIONS STRETCH ACROSS THE NATION ; BROAD IMPACT OF ORANGE COUNTY ' S BANKRUPTCY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the dust settles_on Orange County ' s breathless passage from a worried community to a bankrupt one , what the public still does not know looms large . To date , officials at the center of the storm have done little to clarify matters or provide perspective . On Wednesday , the day after Orange County filed for protection under Chapter 9 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , county officials still were trying to come_to grips with the consequences of the risky investment strategies employed by Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron , who resigned Monday . A SHAKEN MARKET : It is understood that officials are caught_up in a struggle to cope_with the crisis , but the fact remains that this financial disaster has its roots in a lack of public explanation and understanding . Addressing the public ' s need to know the extent of the problem , and how it happened , is paramount . The declaration of bankruptcy has undermined the confidence of the entire bond market . Meanwhile , government workers in Orange County are wondering whether they will be paid , and the municipal and school agencies that employ them are scrambling to figure_out what all this means for them . It is imperative that the county government come completely clean if it means to fully address the problem and enlist community and national support in moving forward . Information has been harder to find than an eager new investor in a county bond . Orange County has been dispensing it in dribs and drabs , much as office gossip might leak_out around the water cooler . Wall_Street , a continent away , has turned_out to be the only real source of information on the county ' s earlier efforts to liquidate its holdings and possibly avoid bankruptcy . With Wall_Street sources reporting that losses may be even greater than the $ 1.5-billion figure given last week , there still has been no full accounting from Orange County . And it remains unclear what the actual value is now for the investment-pool fund that Citron operated . SOONER THE BETTER : And there are more questions : On what basis , and on whose advice , did Orange County become the largest municipality in U.S. history ever to file for bankruptcy ? People on the street , investors and school and other public officials wonder whether less drastic action was considered . If so , why was it rejected ? And how was Citron was able to operate without oversight ? The Board of Supervisors must answer that one . All these questions have national implications . One of the attractions of bonds has been their relative stability , based on support by the taxing power of local_governments . If governments suddenly and unexpectedly can declare bankruptcy , this important economic assumption may vanish for all municipal_bond investors . Orange County officials must understand that their fiscal affairs are now a matter of national importance , perhaps even urgency . The sooner all_the facts are public , the better .</TEXT>
