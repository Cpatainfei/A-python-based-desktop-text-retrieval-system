   <HEADLINE> GUN-TOTING BACKERS BOOST ARAFAT WITH MASSIVE RALLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a massive show of force , an estimated 10 # 000 supporters of PLO leader Yasser Arafat marched in Gaza City on Monday , firing their guns in the air and chanting slogans against the Islamic opposition just days after Arafat ' s security_forces and Islamic militants engaged in bloody street battles . &quot; Here is the weapon , here are the Fatah Hawks , at the hands of our leader , Yasser Arafat , ready to heed your call , &quot; roared thousands of young_men armed with automatic weapons . &quot; Whoever wrongs Fatah , Fatah will open his head. &quot; Fatah is the largest faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization and was founded in the 1960s by Arafat , chairman of the PLO and head of the Palestinian self-governing authority . The march marked a change of tactics for Arafat from the conciliatory stance he took_after his police_force opened_fire on Islamic demonstrators Friday , killing 14 . The two sides quickly agreed to a truce , but efforts to extend that to a broader political accord between Arafat and Islamic militants stalled Monday morning . Fatah ' s march seemed calculated to show the Islamic organizations that Arafat ' s faction remains the strongest in Gaza . &quot; No one can compete with Fatah and with the PLO or with the Palestinian police and the Palestinian security_forces , &quot; Arafat told the cheering crowd , speaking from the same spot where he first addressed Palestinians after his return to Gaza in July after decades in exile . After negotiations with the Islamic militants began to falter Sunday night , Arafat requested the rally , according to Palestinian sources . On Monday , the Voice of Palestine , the Palestinian Authority ' s official radio_station , broadcast blunt warnings to the Islamic opposition groups . Describing Fatah as the mother of all Palestinians , Voice of Palestine warned that any child who disobeys his Fatah mother will face severe punishment . At first , an unidentified commentator said , the child will be grabbed by the ear . If he continues to disobey , &quot; the ear will be cut . Maybe later , also hands and legs will be cut , and also throats will be cut . The message of the mother of the children is clear and open and harsh and tough. &quot; The radio_station also appealed_to Fatah activists to attend the pro-Arafat march and to bring their guns with them . Many of the militants who responded by the busload to Arafat ' s call were leaders of the Palestinian uprising , or intifada , that erupted in Gaza and the West_Bank in 1987 . They had been largely pushed_aside when Arafat and other PLO officials arrived in Gaza from Tunis , Tunisia , to take_over the self-governing authority in July . But Arafat turned_to them Monday as his strongest base of support in the territories . &quot; Today is a referendum of the national authority , a referendum of the PLO , &quot; Arafat told the crowd . &quot; The state of alert continues , and eyes are open . You are the protectors of security ; no one can take_away from Fatah and the Palestinian police , &quot; he said . Hours before the march began , leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad told reporters that they would not sign an accord with Arafat brokered by a group of Israeli Arab leaders . &quot; Arafat must accept personal responsibility for what happened Friday . That is our No . 1 condition . Until that condition is met , we will not sign anything , &quot; said Ahmed Bahar , a Hamas leader in Gaza . The Palestinian Authority had offered to set_up a judicial commission of inquiry into Friday ' s occurrences but balked at accepting blame for what the opposition calls the &quot; massacre. &quot; On Friday , an estimated 200 armed Palestinian police , wearing helmets and carrying riot shields , surrounded the Palestine Mosque in downtown Gaza City , where about 6 # 000 worshipers -- many of them supporters of Hamas and Islamic Jihad -- had gathered for noon prayers . Accounts differ over who started the confrontation that ensued , but a riot erupted as prayers ended . Police fired at rock-throwing demonstrators , and the clash soon spread into surrounding streets . It was the first clash between Palestinian police and civilians since Israel handed day-to-day control of the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho to the PLO in May . Before the fighting ended Friday night , about 13 people had been shot dead and at least 129 wounded . A 14th victim , Ata Kanan , died of his wounds Monday and was buried . About 200 supporters of Islamic organizations attended his funeral . Friday ' s bloodshed sent shock_waves through the Palestinian community and raised the specter of civil_war erupting in Gaza . Mediation efforts were launched immediately , and all sides initially called_for calm . But the Islamic opposition parties listed stiff political demands they said Arafat must fulfill as their price for reconciliation . They refused to disarm or to moderate their violent opposition to the PLO ' s accord with Israel . Some leaders of the more militant Islamic Jihad and the Izzidin al-Qassam faction of Hamas have even threatened to begin attacking Palestinian police and Palestinian officials unless Arafat agrees to dismiss , try and execute senior police_officers and dismiss Justice Minister Freih abu Medeen . &quot; This was a Fatah rally with a clear message , &quot; Hisham Abdel Razik , a Fatah leader in Gaza , said in an interview on Israeli television Monday night . &quot; The message is that Fatah is the one who carried the struggle for 30 years . It is Fatah who brought_about the success of the political process . It is Fatah who brought_about the first_step on_the_road to Jerusalem. &quot;</TEXT>
