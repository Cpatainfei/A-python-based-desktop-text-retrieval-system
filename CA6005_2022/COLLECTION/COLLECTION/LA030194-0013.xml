   <HEADLINE> JEWS HAVE LONG SUFFERED IN HEBRON ; TERRORISM : THE CRIME OF ONE GUNMAN can ' t BE EQUATED WITH CENTURIES OF ARAB VIOLENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For centuries , blood has flowed in Hebron -- in almost all cases , Jewish blood spilled by Arab violence . In 1929 , as in 1517 , 1841 and 1851 , the Jews of Hebron were slaughtered . Because of Arab pogroms , in 1936 , the_British forcibly removed most Jews from Hebron , after more_than 3 # 500 years of continued residence . Jews were not permitted to return until after the Six-Day War of 1967 . Since then , there have been numerous attacks , the most notorious in 1980 , when Arab terrorists waylaid a group of Jews walking back from evening_prayers at the Tomb of Abraham and murdered six of them . Since the signing of the PLO-Israeli agreement last September , the situation has deteriorated , with almost daily Arab terrorist attacks resulting in at least 30 Jewish deaths in the West_Bank . The act of Baruch Goldstein last Friday -- entering a mosque and killing at least 40 people there -- is reprehensible . It defies both Jewish law and tradition : While Judaism supports acts of defense , indiscriminate violence is condemned . Yet the world ' s uproar over this great crime is one-sided . Arab terrorism is organized ; Goldstein acted alone . He was a quiet man , and his closest friends , even his wife , had no idea of what he intended to do . Goldstein went_to Hebron years ago to serve as a physician . Daily , he saw firsthand the carnage as those wounded in Arab attacks were brought_to his care . Since the gunning_down of his closest friend and his friend ' s son in December , Goldstein became deeply distressed . Last Thursday night , during a Purim service at the Tomb of Abraham , he heard , along with many others , the cries of Arabs in the mosque next door : &quot; Etbak el Yahud -- kill the Jews. &quot; Many of Goldstein ' s friends feel that this pushed him over the edge . The next morning , he rose at dawn and went_to the mosque and killed those he thought were going_to kill him . It is hypocritical for the world to condemn the irrational act of one man and ignore the organized efforts of Arab terrorist groups . In the last 10 days alone , they murdered a pregnant mother and an army reservist and made dozens of other unsuccessful attacks . Hamas , the Fatah hawks of the Palestine Liberation Organization and other groups have been orchestrating a systematic policy of terror against Jewish civilians in the West_Bank . These efforts are the cause of the tensions , not the actions of one person , terrible as it was . Time and again , we witness the murder of one Jew after another and there is nothing but silence from the PLO and the world . Now , after this terrible carnage , the PLO demands that the settlers be disarmed . Who then will protect the Jews from the daily attacks -- Yasser Arafat , the man with the blood of hundreds if not thousands of Jews on his hands ? Jews are not interlopers or settlers in Hebron . They have a historic right to live there . The first Jew , Abraham , buried his wife Sarah in Hebron . Despite pogroms , expulsions , attacks and murders , Jews have continued to live_in the city of their forefathers . Goldstein ' s grandparents were from Hebron , forced_out by Arab violence decades ago . He , like many other Jews , just wanted to live_in the home of his ancestors . Living_in Hebron has not been easy for Jews . A very close friend of mine , Sara Nachshon , a mother of 10 , was one of the first Jews to renew the ancient settlement after the Six-Day War . She has been attacked numerous times . One day , the bus she was riding in was machine-gunned ; the bullets missed her by inches . Another time , as she was going_to pray at the Jewish cemetery , an Arab tried to kill her with a knife . Her oldest son , Yehuda , was stabbed in the back as he walked through the market ; the thick seam on his denim jacket saved his life . Every Jew in Hebron has been the target of such violence . The Arafat-Rabin agreement has accelerated the violence . The Arabs of Hebron and the West_Bank are hoping to accomplish what they did_in 1935 : drive the Jews out . The world , naive , without a sense of yesterday , only sees the terrible carnage of today . It does not see the fresh grave of a mother gunned_down with a baby in her womb a week ago or the dozens of others who have met similar fates . The present Israeli government carries much of the responsibility . It has failed to protect its citizens from Arab terrorism . This breakdown in basic security calls into question the very agreement that the government is supporting . If the army cannot protect its citizens from Palestinian terrorists now , what will happen when Palestinians themselves are the police ? Things will only get_worse , not better , with Arafat in Jericho instead of Tunis . As Jews , we must condemn an act of violence against another human_being , even if that person is filled with hatred toward us . Baruch Goldstein was wrong to spill blood in the mosque in Hebron . But we cannot let the world compare the acts of one person to the continuous attacks of Arab groups that are dedicated to pushing Jews out of our homeland .</TEXT>
