   <HEADLINE> OUT OF INNER MONGOLIA ; EXHIBITION COVERS 3 # 500 YEARS OF HISTORY -- AND MAKES SOME OF ITS OWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Genghis Khan has few peers in the annals of world history . The Mongol conqueror , who lived from around 1167 to 1227 , united nomadic tribes into a terrifyingly effective army and founded the largest land empire in history , stretching from Eastern Europe to the Sea_of_Japan . His cultural achievements are less celebrated than his military and political genius , but the law and order he imposed on the Asian steppe fostered East-West exchanges along the system of trade_routes known as the Silk_Road . With all those credits , few would dispute Genghis Khan ' s right to change his name from Temujin , or iron worker , to the Chinese equivalent of &quot; universal ruler. &quot; Fewer still would question the marketing wisdom of attaching his moniker to a landmark exhibition , &quot; Genghis Khan : Treasures From Inner Mongolia , &quot; which opens Sunday at the Natural_History Museum of Los Angeles County . The show actually covers 3 # 500 years of history -- most of them before Genghis ' reign -- but the American appetite for celebrities , violence and precious objects makes the title irresistible . Nothing is routine about the display of artworks from China ' s legendary hinterlands , however . &quot; This is the first major exhibition of cultural relics from one of China ' s autonomous regions , and it comes at a timely moment , &quot; said Adam T . Kessler , a Los Angeles-based archeologist who organized the show . &quot; Of all_the areas in the People ' s Republic_of_China where archeological survey and excavation have been carried_out , Inner Mongolia is one place that has made remarkable strides . &quot; For one thing , its ( dry ) climate has helped to preserve an astonishing array of ancient settlements , cities , burial_sites and artifacts , &quot; he said . &quot; The work of Inner Mongolian archeologists who have been laboring for decades in the field has resulted in finds that are nothing short of extraordinary. &quot; None of the artworks in &quot; Genghis Khan &quot; have been previously exhibited in the West . Indeed , some of them have been unearthed during the past few years and are only known to a small circle of specialists . Among the treasures are a spectacular headdress from the Warring States Period ( 475-221 BC ) with a turquoise eagle atop a spiral of gold bas-relief , and a gilded bronze funerary mask from the Liao Dynasty ( 907-1125 ) . Reciting a litany of the show ' s unusual features , Kessler noted that it doesn ' t conform_to regulations governing China ' s national treasures . An 18-month tour -- proceeding from Los Angeles to the Morris Museum in Morristown , N.J. , the American Museum of Natural_History in New York , the Tennessee State Museum in Nashville and the Royal British_Columbia Museum in Victoria -- exceeds the customary 12-month limit for loans of artworks . A maximum of 100 objects is generally permitted to leave the country in a traveling exhibition , and no more_than 15 % of them can be plucked from rosters of &quot; first category , &quot; or first-class , objects . But &quot; Genghis Khan &quot; contains more_than 150 pieces and more_than half of them are from the top echelon . The exhibition is the first concrete example of the liberalization of Chinese policies regarding national treasures , Kessler said , and he hopes it will set a precedent . But impressive as these facts may be , he believes the show ' s primary value is educational . &quot; Most Westerners know of Genghis Khan and the Mongols , &quot; he said . &quot; On the other hand -- although we commonly acknowledge such maxims as ' Rome was not built_in a day ' -- we tend to assume the spontaneous_generation of a historical phenomenon such_as the Mongols and to shroud their cultural heritage in a mysterious and impenetrably dark past. &quot; But Inner Mongolian archeologists emphasize the value of viewing the Mongol conquests as the culmination of a continuous historical process , rather than an isolated phenomenon , he said . &quot; I have designed this exhibition so that Western audiences can appreciate the fact that the Mongols were but the last in a long series of steppe empires to emerge from East Asia and were truly the inheritors of a rich and diverse past , &quot; he said . The artworks tell a story beginning with the Stone_Age and proceeding through the evolution of various empires . Text panels , maps , photographs and facsimiles -- including a partial re-creation of a Mongol-era tomb -- enhance the exhibition ' s educational and expository value . So-called treasures shows -- which foster appreciation for the cultural heritage of faraway places -- are said to be a thing of the past because they have become too expensive or politically explosive to be worth the effort . But the flow of objects from Inner Mongolia is probably only beginning , Kessler said , because the region is a great archeological frontier and Inner Mongolians are eager to spread the word of their achievements . They didn ' t exactly roll_out the red_carpet and empty their coffers upon request , however . Organizing the exhibition was a four-year effort that required harrowing journeys to remote sites and protracted negotiations with officials at small prefectural museums ; Ulan Bator , the capital of Inner Mongolia , and the Bureau of Culture in Beijing . Despite his fluency in Chinese and scholarly contacts , Kessler often doubted that he could bring_off the exhibition . &quot; Like any Westerner , I was unprepared for the obstacles I had to hurdle , &quot; he said . The fundamental problem is philosophical , he said , noting that Americans tend to see things in black_and_white , and to demand quick answers , while the Chinese view everything in terms of tradition and the needs of their developing country . &quot; We don ' t have the patience or the tenacity to see things through , &quot; he said . Seeing things through Mongolian-style meant pushing trucks over hills during flash_floods , hitching rides when his vehicles broke_down , smoking hundreds of cigarettes with government officials and persuading them to loan precious artifacts . The result is an array of gold and silver objects , bronze vessels and weapons , silk garments , paper documents , ceramics and funerary ware , spanning the second millennium BC to the 14th Century . &quot; This is not intended to be an art show , &quot; Kessler said . &quot; I think that what ' s important to bring_out from China now is what archeology can tell us about ancient records and historical events . But that doesn ' t mitigate the beauty of the pieces . They are works_of_art ; they are masterpieces. &quot; * &quot; Genghis Khan : Treasures From Inner Mongolia , &quot; Natural_History Museum of Los Angeles County , 900 Exposition Blvd .
