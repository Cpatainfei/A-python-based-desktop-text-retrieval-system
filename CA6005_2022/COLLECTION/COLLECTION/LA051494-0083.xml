   <HEADLINE> ELECTIONS / VENTURA COUNTY SUPERVISOR ; POLITICAL NEWCOMER REVIVES DORMANT PLAN FOR WORLD-CLASS MARINA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although he has never run_for public office before , rancher Carter Ward says he is running_for Ventura County supervisor because he has ideas for keeping a lid on property_taxes while generating more revenue for the county . One solution , Ward says , would be for the county to consider a long-dormant proposal to build a world-class marina along a 2 1 / 2-mile stretch of beach property near the Los Angeles County_line . The project was initially proposed by landowner Lee Mansdorf a decade ago , but never seriously pursued with county leaders . It would include a separate development on 1 # 100 acres Mansdorf owns nearby with several luxury estates , two hotels , a golf_course , a 60-acre lake and other amenities . Ward estimates the county could generate as much as $ 5 million annually in tax_revenues from a 3 # 500-slip marina project , money that could be used to pay_for law_enforcement , fire protection , waste disposal and other county services . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s going_to hurt the environment , so I think it ' s OK , &quot; said Ward , 50 , who is competing for the 2nd Supervisorial District seat that covers Thousand Oaks , Oak Park and Port Hueneme . Ward said he would rather see development of a marina instead of having state and federal park agencies continue to buy_up thousands of acres in the Santa Monica Mountains . Those agencies do not contribute to the county tax rolls , he said . &quot; We need to raise money , &quot; said Ward , who received a $ 500 campaign contribution from Mansdorf . &quot; I don ' t want to have to pay more taxes . It seems like a good_deal . The guy owns the land , and I ' m a property_rights advocate from the word go . I say , why not ? &quot; Ward said he did not enter the supervisorial race at the urging of Mansdorf , but rather because he believes the marina plan fits_in with other ideas he has for generating additional revenues for the county . The proposed Deer Creek Marina -- so named because it would be situated along the southern tip of the county near Deer Creek Road -- first surfaced in the mid-1980s when Mansdorf began to put_together preliminary plans for the project . But the proposal was never brought before the Board of Supervisors for consideration . Mansdorf said part of the reason is he did not believe the support was there to approve zoning changes for the project . He hopes the proposal will receive positive attention through Ward ' s campaign for supervisor . &quot; Carter likes the project because he realizes that this is a positive use of land and that it will provide revenues for the county and jobs , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s no reason it should be turned down. &quot; Mansdorf said if the county approves the zoning changes necessary for the project to go_forward , he could easily recruit a developer to build the marina and nearby resort . The marina , he said , would be the only one of its kind between Channel Islands Harbor in Oxnard and Marina del Rey . Mansdorf said an agreement would be worked_out under which the county would own the marina , with Mansdorf holding a long-term lease . With the county as owner , he said , it would be easier to get approval for the marina from the California Coastal Commission and other regulatory_agencies . &quot; There ' s interest out there from developers , &quot; Mansdorf said . &quot; We have all_the engineering and geological reports ready . We just need the permits. &quot; Another way to raise revenue for the county would be to ease zoning regulations in unincorporated areas to allow estates to be built_on 10-acre parcels , Ward said . Zoning now restricts housing construction on lots of 10 to 100 acres in size , with hilltop land being more restricted . But Ward said anything beyond 10 acres makes_it too expensive to build . &quot; We live_in a Mediterranean climate where everybody wants to live , &quot; he said . &quot; I say let them come_in . But we don ' t have to have high density like Los Angeles . I think what we can do is have affluent houses ( on 10-acre lots ) that pay lots of taxes. &quot; If elected , Ward , a retired civil_engineer , said he would push to do_away_with what he considers overly restrictive building_codes . One example of this , he said , is a county policy that requires households dependent_on well_water to have the capability of providing up_to 7 # 200 gallons of water per day . Ward said the average daily use of water per person is about 50 gallons . &quot; There are people who want to build houses but are not permitted because of regulations -- regulations that don ' t make any sense , &quot; Ward said . &quot; And I ' m tired_of it , so I ' m becoming political. &quot; Ward ' s ideas for generating revenues have raised questions from some of his opponents , including Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo , former Ventura County Supervisor Madge Schaefer , taxpayer advocate H . Jere Robings and attorney Trudi Loh . Schillo said the county already owns two of nine marinas operating out of Channel Islands Harbor . He said what makes these marinas different from what Ward is proposing is that they are situated within a protected inlet . The Deer Creek Marina &quot; would have to be built right out on the ocean , and I have a problem with that , &quot; Schillo said . &quot; I would n ' t be for it just for the money . I would come at it from the standpoint of aesthetics and from an environmental standpoint. &quot; Another question that has arisen is whether there is enough demand to support another large marina in the county . Channel Islands Harbor , which has 2 # 600 boat slips , has a 15 % to 20 % vacancy_rate due in large part to the recession , Harbor Master Frank Anderson said . The 1 # 500-slip Ventura Harbor reported a similar vacancy_rate . But Ward said the Deer Creek Marina would be different because it would only allow large yachts and sailboats , rather than small motorboats . He added that even if the marina were approved it would probably not be built for three or four years , by which time the economy should be better . &quot; I think it ' s going_to be a win-win situation , &quot; Ward said . Meanwhile , Loh expressed reservations about Ward ' s proposal for 10-acre residential lots in unincorporated areas . She said she thought there might be better ways for generating more revenues for the county . &quot; I would rather see the county spend less money , instead of plowing down our countryside , &quot; she said . But Ward said if people want to preserve private land as open space , then they should &quot; buy_it because I don ' t want to buy_it with my tax dollars. &quot; On other issues , Ward said he believes the county Fire_Department in the future should share_in revenues generated from the Proposition 172 sales tax measure approved by state voters last fall to fund public safety programs . The money is now split among the county ' s law_enforcement agencies and criminal justice system . &quot; If the firefighters say they need it , I ' m going_to have to go_along with that , &quot; Ward said , adding that firefighters helped save his hilltop ranch when wildfires swept_through Little Sycamore Canyon near Malibu in November . &quot; I went_through the fire of 1993 with great admiration for the Fire_Department , &quot; Ward said . &quot; I saw the most efficient group of men and women work for me than I ' ve ever seen before. &quot; Although a county audit showed that the Fire_Department was spending too_much on overtime and sick_leave , Ward said he would have to examine the report before commenting on it . Ward said he does not support the creation of a county firefighter paramedic program because it is not clear how it would be financed . &quot; I would not want to start a program unless I knew how we were going_to pay_for it , &quot; he said . &quot; Show me how we ' re going to pay_for it. &quot; Ward said he supports a proposal to establish a commercial airport at Point Mugu if it can be done without disturbing residents who live_in the surrounding area . The Navy has offered to share its runway with the county to cut its operating_costs . &quot; I think it ' s a great idea , &quot; Ward said . &quot; But the ( potential noise ) is a question that we would have to look into. &quot; On waste management , Ward said he reluctantly backs the development of a new west county landfill at Weldon Canyon near Ojai . Officials and residents there have successfully fought against a dump for years . With Bailard Landfill in Oxnard scheduled to close_in 1997 , Ward said , the county has little choice but to develop another landfill to service west county cities . He said he understands Ojai residents ' opposition to a landfill at Weldon Canyon but knows of no other possible site . &quot; Show me a better place , &quot; Ward said . &quot; I ' m on their side . But they need to help me . I haven ' t seen a better solution. &quot; But Ward said the county must start looking_for alternatives for disposing_of its trash in the future , such_as advanced recycling and composting programs . He said during the 20 years he worked_at Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory in Port Hueneme he did extensive research on landfills and recycling programs and understands the challenges facing the county . &quot; Landfills are dangerous , &quot; he said . &quot; We are now entombing our trash . We surround it with plastic , and this is a pathogenic spawning ground for future diseases. &quot; To further reduce trash flow into landfills , Ward suggested that the county might consider implementing a reward or penalty to households to increase the effectiveness of its recycling programs . Although Loh has suggested that the county possibly ship its trash by rail to another county or state , Ward said he believes that would be far too expensive . If a landfill is developed at Weldon Canyon , he said , it should be one with a short life span to further pressure the county into finding other alternatives for trash disposal . &quot; Landfills are not the future , &quot; he said . On health_care , Ward said he does not support a proposed $ 30-million expansion of the Ventura County Medical_Center . He said the county should hold_off on its plans for the project until it is known what impact the Clinton_Administration ' s health-care reforms might have_on the local health-care system . The county project has spurred an opposing campaign by neighboring Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura that considers the public hospital a potential competitor for private patients . &quot; My understanding is we have too many vacancies in hospitals , and I would never be in favor of a program that would be a loser economically , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t want to build empty bed spaces. &quot; But Ward said his main focus will be to generate revenues for the county by working to ease zoning and building regulations . He plans to hold a candidates ' debate at his Dry Gulch Ranch on May 22 . With no name recognition or government experience and little money to spend on his campaign , Ward said he knows he is fighting an uphill battle . &quot; If I lose , I won ' t be disappointed , &quot; he said . &quot; At least I can say I tried. &quot; Profile of Carter J .
