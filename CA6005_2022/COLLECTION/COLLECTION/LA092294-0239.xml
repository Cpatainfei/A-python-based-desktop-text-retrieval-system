   <HEADLINE> SEARCH IN SIMPSON CASE UPHELD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A detective recklessly misstated facts to get a search_warrant a day after the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman , but that is not enough to justify throwing_out evidence obtained in the search of O.J. Simpson ' s estate , Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito ruled Wednesday . The ruling was another victory for prosecutors in fending off relentless defense attempts to have Ito suppress what may be key evidence against Simpson . But as soon as the ruling came_down , a new battle began as Ito allowed the defense to call witnesses in an attempt to suppress evidence that had been gathered from Simpson ' s home under a second warrant . The defense contends that the second warrant precipitated a search that was overly broad and therefore illegal . During that testimony , defense_lawyers learned from the two lead detectives in the case that some items taken_in the second search seem to have little to do with items that the warrant authorized them to seize . The challenged items include videos of &quot; Frogmen , &quot; a television movie pilot that Simpson was shooting , and highlights of his football career . Simpson has pleaded not_guilty to the June 12 slayings of his ex-wife and Goldman outside her Brentwood condominium . Jury selection in his trial is scheduled to begin Monday . Wednesday ' s hearing was one of a series of pretrial proceedings in which attorneys have jockeyed to bolster their cases before presenting them to jurors . In other action Wednesday , Ito : * Put_off until next week an inquiry into why Simpson ' s longtime personal assistant , Cathy Randa , shredded some papers investigators saw at his business office and later came_back to seize with a search_warrant . * Ordered turned_over to the defense and prosecution police records relating to an August , 1993 , unsolved slaying in Hollywood . Simpson ' s lawyers contend that the manner of death in that case makes_it so similar to the Brentwood murders that it may point to a suspect other_than Simpson . * Refused to allow the defense to call Marcia Clark , the lead prosecutor in the case , to the stand Wednesday , but left open the possibility that she , and presumably other prosecutors , could be called later . * Heard arguments on whether a warrant issued to seize Simpson ' s Ford Bronco authorized police to search the vehicle and on whether the vehicle was so loosely monitored at an auto yard that it was burglarized and left open_to other tampering . * Postponed a decision on whether to allow the defense to take testimony to challenge the credibility and character of Mark Fuhrman , a Los Angeles police_detective who has testified that he found a bloody glove on Simpson ' s estate similar to one discovered at the murder scene . Fuhrman ' s lawyer went_on the offensive Wednesday to try to protect the reputation of his client . At a news_conference during the hearing ' s noon recess , Robert Tourtelot told reporters that a woman lied when she contended that his client once made racist statements . Defense_lawyers contend that those statements by Fuhrman indicate bias against Simpson . She either confused Fuhrman with someone else or was angry because he had rejected her romantic advances , Tourtelot said . Kathleen Bell , in a written declaration she turned_over to defense_lawyer Johnnie L . Cochran Jr . in July , has contended that Fuhrman in the mid-1980s made disparaging remarks about black people in_general and interracial couples in particular , raising the possibility that he was predisposed to dislike Simpson , who is black and whose ex-wife was white . Tourtelot also asserted that during an Aug . 29 court hearing , Cochran misrepresented Bell ' s statements about Fuhrman and the assertions of a man whose lawyer contends that Fuhrman made a racial slur to him after the officer and his partner shot him , allegedly without cause . Tourtelot said he would ask Ito to refer the Cochran statements to the California State Bar for possible discipline against the defense_lawyer and would ask Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti to refer the Bell matter_to the state_attorney general for investigation . Bell could not be reached for comment , and Cochran dismissed Tourtelot ' s allegations as &quot; preposterous. &quot; Bell , a San Pedro real_estate_agent , contends that Fuhrman made the offensive remarks to her at a Marine Corps recruiting station in Redondo Beach in 1985 or 1986 . But Anthony J . Pellicano , a private_investigator hired by Tourtelot to investigate Bell ' s background , contended at the Wednesday news_conference that three former marines who say they were present when Fuhrman talked to Bell do not recall him saying anything improper . Pellicano acknowledged that he has received no sworn affidavits from the marines . One of the marines , reached Wednesday evening , confirmed that he knew Bell and Fuhrman in the mid-1980s , when Bell worked_at a real_estate office above a Marine recruiting station in Redondo Beach . Maximo Cordoba , 44 , of Bellflower , said that Fuhrman had come_into the recruiting office twice to talk_about going_on active duty in the reserves . &quot; At no time , when Mark was with me or in our office , did he speak in any racist manner about blacks or anyone , &quot; said Cordoba , who said he is black . Cordoba said he did not recall seeing Bell in the office when Fuhrman was there . In ruling on the flawed search_warrant , executed June 28 , Ito said he was concerned about how an experienced officer , Detective Philip L . Vannatter , one of the two lead investigators in the case , could make so many errors in his request for a judge ' s authorization to search Simpson ' s property . In the search_warrant request , Vannatter said human blood was found on Simpson ' s Bronco , on the driveway of his estate and on the glove found on the property when no such confirmation had been made . He described as &quot; unexpected &quot; a trip to Chicago that Simpson had planned for two months . Vannatter also failed to note on the request that Simpson had agreed by phone to return to Los Angeles and cooperate with police . Ito rejected Clark ' s contention that representations were at most negligent . &quot; I have to make a finding that it is at least reckless , &quot; Ito said . But he nonetheless spurned the defense ' s request to invalidate the search conducted after the warrant was obtained . Although the defense lost its attempt to get the evidence suppressed , legal_experts said that Ito ' s finding produced a public relations point for Simpson . &quot; One important theme throughout the pretrial process that the defense has pushed insistently is that you can not necessarily trust the credibility of police_officers , and Wednesday in a limited fashion Judge Ito helped endorse that message by his finding , &quot; said UCLA criminal_law professor Peter Arenella . In agreeing to allow the defense to query witnesses about the scope of the second search_warrant , which Ito also ruled legal Wednesday , the judge said he had &quot; about 30 questions I want to ask myself. &quot; The first witnesses called by the defense were Vannatter and his partner , Tom Lange . In questioning them , the defense &quot; did a very effective job of demonstrating that the second search of Mr. Simpson ' s home included police behavior that is extremely hard to justify , &quot; Arenella said . What the defense is trying to establish , he said , is that the second search &quot; degenerated into a general exploratory search in which the police seized a great_deal of material not listed in the warrant and which was clearly not incriminating on its face , &quot; including the &quot; Frogmen &quot; tape . During the questioning , defense_lawyers repeatedly suggested that officers sat around Simpson ' s living room watching watching the movie and football videos on television . They also suggested that officers may have assembled a &quot; shrine &quot; from photographs of Simpson ' s family in his bedroom . Vannatter acknowledged that scripts , schedules and notepads were seized from Simpson ' s home when none of those items were listed on the warrant . Vannatter appeared testy Wednesday and said he believed everything that was seized was obtained legally . &quot; I believe if I see an item in plain view that has evidentiary value , ( it ) can be seized , &quot; he said . The defense wants Clark , her co-counsel , Deputy Dist . Atty . William Hodgman , and a third prosecutor to testify about what they saw during the search . All three have been subpoenaed by the defense , but are fighting being forced to take the witness_stand . Vannatter testified Wednesday that the prosecutors were at the scene during the search , but were merely questioning witnesses , including Fuhrman . * ' MEDIA CITY ' : Television_news organizations have built an encampment across the street from the courthouse .
