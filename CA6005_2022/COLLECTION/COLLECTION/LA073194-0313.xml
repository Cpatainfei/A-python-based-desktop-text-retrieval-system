   <HEADLINE> 1ST U.S. TROOPS REACH RWANDAN CAPITAL TO SECURE AIRPORT ; AFRICA : MISSION WILL PREPARE THE WAY FOR MORE AID . DEFENSE_SECRETARY IS SCHEDULED TO INSPECT EFFORTS TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first U.S. troops landed in the Rwandan capital Saturday to secure the airport for an expanded international aid effort . The next step is encouraging millions of scared , displaced people to return home . President Clinton on Friday ordered 200 U.S. soldiers to Kigali to support the relief effort in Rwanda , where millions have fled their homes to escape ethnic carnage that killed up_to 500 # 000 people . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry was scheduled to inspect the U.S. aid mission today . Lt . Gen . Daniel Schroeder , commander of the joint U.S. task_force , said it was unclear how many American soldiers will eventually be sent to Rwanda , whether they will be deployed outside Kigali or how long they might stay . Maj . Gen . Romeo Dallaire , Canadian commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force here , said total U.S. troop strength in Rwanda could reach about 2 # 000 -- if the Americans agree to take_on all jobs the United Nations would like them to . U.N. officials hope a new commitment of American , Canadian and British troops will help them carry_out their mission and prompt other nations to send the troops they have pledged . &quot; The fact the Americans are here will make the other countries send their troops quicker , &quot; said Shaharyar Khan , special representative for Rwanda for U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali . Thousands of refugees have died in a cholera epidemic in Goma , Zaire , where hundreds of thousands of Rwandans are packed into squalid camps . Relief efforts so far have concentrated_on providing them with food , medical_care and clean water to prevent the spread of the water-borne cholera bacteria . The goal now is to persuade the refugees to return home . Most are majority Hutus who fled in fear of reprisals by the victorious Tutsi-led rebels for the mass killings of Tutsis . The rebels have installed Rwanda ' s new government . Aid officials in Goma said Saturday that they thought the cholera epidemic was coming under_control . But in Kimumba , the most crowded of the camps around Goma , hundreds of refugees rioted as a Red_Cross convoy distributed bags of cooking_oil , beans and corn flour . Refugees said at least one person was killed and others were wounded as men wielding clubs fought_off mobs that surrounded the bags of food . Dallaire said all 200 of the first Americans ordered in should arrive by today . Schroeder , the U.S. commander , said the size and scope of the U.S. mission in Rwanda were &quot; still ambiguous. &quot; He said those factors will be determined by security conditions and humanitarian needs . U.N. military sources , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the plan is to use additional U.S. troops to help move relief supplies to distribution hubs within Rwanda . The Canadian and British troops would join in to move supplies from the hubs to the countryside . U.S. Special Forces psychological_warfare teams would bring_in radio equipment to help the new government encourage more_than a_million refugees in neighboring Zaire to return home . The Tutsi-led government has assured Hutu refugees that there will be no reprisals for the massacres of Tutsis . Trucks used to carry food into the country would bring_back refugees on the return trip . Dallaire said a convoy of six small trucks sent as a test brought_back 400 refugees and was mobbed by others wishing to return . For now , Dallaire said , refugees would be brought_back only from Ruhengeri , in northwest Rwanda , to prevent the spread of cholera from Goma or the Rwandan border town of Gisenyi . Cholera has an incubation_period of two days , the amount_of_time it takes_for refugees to walk from Goma to Ruhengeri . Dallaire said way stations and medical_aid stations would be set_up along the route . U.N. forces in Rwanda number about 750 , but Dallaire said he hopes to increase that number to about 4 # 000 in the next few weeks . The U.N. Security_Council has authorized 5 # 500 new peacekeepers for the mission . Britain is sending 600 soldiers to help Rwandan refugees return home , Defense Minister Malcolm Rifkind said Saturday . The U.N. commander said an additional 4 # 000 troops would help replace the 2 # 500 French troops withdrawing from the protection zone they established in southwestern Rwanda . The French are credited with preventing another 2 million people from fleeing into Zaire by providing them with a haven in Rwanda . But Dallaire said he did not want to create a situation in which refugees would be returning only because foreign troops are in the country . &quot; I am not going_to put a soldier on every street_corner to give Rwandans a sense of security , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
