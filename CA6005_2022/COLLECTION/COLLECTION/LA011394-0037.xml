   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVES ON OPENING NATO MEMBERSHIP ; YES : DON ' T ABANDON EASTERN EUROPE -- AGAIN ; THE BONDS OF SECURITY , ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL INTERESTS TIE EAST AND WEST , BUT THE COMMUNIST SPECTER STILL LURKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Feb . 11 , 1945 , my wife and I listened_in London to the evening news as the signing of the Yalta agreement was announced . It solidified the wartime cooperation between three victorious major_powers ; they granted themselves the authority to carve out the new frontiers of Europe . Smaller and weaker allies , irrespective of their contributions to the joint war efforts , were sacrificed on the altar of big-powers unity . At that moment , we decided to change our status from soldiers to political exiles . There was no way that we could return to our native Poland and face a foreign-imposed regime . Yet that decision was challenged by the political mood of the period . The government would be wise , pontificated the venerable Times of London , &quot; to curb hostile voices of disgruntled Poles attacking their newly formed government. &quot; Three years later , when we went_to the American consulate to collect our immigration visas , the consul inquired why we were not returning home . &quot; Poland is free , &quot; he said , &quot; it has a newly established government recognized by the Allies . You would risk nothing returning. &quot; And both Washington and London justified their policy as the only one acceptable to Moscow . It would be foolish to irritate the Soviet_Union . Is history repeating itself ? We are witnessing a widespread discussion about the future of NATO and the split in the ranks of the State_Department policy-makers . Apparently , stronger personalities and stronger presidential ties prevailed . Instead of responding to Eastern European calls_for admission to the Western security umbrella , a watered-down formula called &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; was offered . It would be foolish to irritate Russia and President Boris N . Yeltsin , the current darling of the American foreign-policy Establishment . Is history repeating itself ? Probably , but circumstances are dramatically different . Half a century ago , the big powers ' decisions rested_on the premises that the two halves of the continent -- Eastern and Western -- could remain separated and equal . Today , another element enters into equation : global interdependence , which neither Eastern Europe nor America can neglect . It manifests itself in security , economic , fiscal and political ties . Since 1989 -- the year that Solidarity assumed power in Poland -- a number of solid bridges have been erected between East and West . Democratic governments , free elections and market-driven economies became new political realities . Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel are both products of that reality . They received accolades ( including a Nobel Peace Prize for Walesa ) , political encouragement and fiscal assistance . The aid channeled through the World_Bank and the International Monetary Fund put the prestige of these two institutions and their judgment on the line . It is the economic_growth that is being counted_upon by numerous American and multinational corporations . They keep testing the newly opening markets as well as manufacturing facilities.Modern technologies , be they in telecommunication , transportation or merchandising , are being absorbed eagerly by Eastern Europeans . The United States , for years suffering from negative trade_balances , may be looking toward these new markets to alleviate that problem . Thus interdependence has taken_root , yet it appears to have been negated by the Clinton_Administration . The issue of NATO membership has been interpreted solely from the Eastern European perspective , neglecting potential benefits and pitfalls for both sides . The pitfalls are in_evidence in today ' s Poland . Recent elections -- free by any standard -- produced victory for former communists . While there is little doubt that harsh economic_conditions played a role , a sense of abandonment by the West played an equally important role . Poland , denigrated to satellite status during the last 50 years , yearns to be readmitted to the Western family of nations as a full partner rather than an associate . The current discussion related to NATO , bypassing the reality of existing interdependence , made Poles feel pressured once again to look eastward . The protest vote , bringing_to a democratic Poland a communist prime_minister , should be a warning to all those who five years ago celebrated the change . For the United States , there was another warning recently from Moscow : Parliamentary elections catapulted into prominence a demagogue calling openly for restoration of a defunct Russian empire . Should this be translated into action , a strong rebuff by the Czech Republic or Poland would trigger global repercussions -- another indication of interdependence in the security area . An anonymous State_Department official was quoted as suggesting that Eastern Europeans should accept the partnership idea ; otherwise , he implied , America will just go elsewhere . I suddenly saw once again the surprised face of the American consul in 1945 encouraging me not to emigrate to the States but to return home . Is it possible that he is still around , devising the new policy ?</TEXT>
