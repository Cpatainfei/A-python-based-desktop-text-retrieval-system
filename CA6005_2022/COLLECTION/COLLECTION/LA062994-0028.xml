   <HEADLINE> FILM RATINGS BOARD PICKS MOSK AS ITS NEW LEADER ; MOVIES : AFTER 20 YEARS , RICHARD HEFFNER IS STEPPING_DOWN AS HEAD OF A PANEL THAT REMAINS A HOTBED OF CONTROVERSY . RICHARD MOSK TAKES_OVER JULY 1 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two decades after his appointment as chairman of the Classification &amp; Rating Administration , the film_industry ' s controversial ratings arm , Richard Heffner is relinquishing the hot_seat . His successor , Richard Mosk , will assume the post July 1 . &quot; Nothing lasts forever , &quot; explains Jack Valenti , president of the Motion_Picture Assn . of America which , with the National Assn . of Theater Owners , oversees the ratings board . &quot; After 20 years , we ' re bringing someone else in to keep the institution alive. &quot; Mosk , 54 , an honors graduate of Stanford_University and Harvard Law_School , is a partner with the Los Angeles firm of Sanders , Barnet , Goldman , Simons and Mosk , specializing in litigation arbitration law . He was a staff_member of the Warren Commission investigating the assassination of President Kennedy ; one of three American judges on the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal that arose out of the hostage situation ; and a member of the Christopher Commission investigating the Los Angeles police in the wake of the Rodney G . King beating . * Once again , he ' ll have his hands full . Ratings of movies are routinely second-guessed by filmmakers who ' ve called the standards ambiguous and arbitrary . Debate continues over the 4-year-old &quot; adults-only &quot; NC-17 rating that has proven to be nearly as stigmatizing as the &quot; X &quot; it replaced . And the committee -- nearly a dozen parents whose job it is to provide guidelines about a movie ' s suitability for children -- is caught in a cross fire between artists who view its very existence as institutionalized censorship and local school_boards or right-wing religious groups eager to take matters into their own hands . The board is a political football in the industry , as well . &quot; The system works -- for the major studios , at least , &quot; observes Mitch Goldman , president of marketing and distribution at New Line Cinema . &quot; But there ' s a definite double_standard when it comes_to rating the independents . Because we ' re not Paramount or Universal , we had a tough time with ( &quot; Nightmare on Elm Street ' s &quot; ) Freddy Krueger . He ' s a very popular horror character who became Heffner ' s main nemesis. &quot; Nonsense , retorts the departing chief . &quot; Our badge of honor is that the big guys -- as well as the little ones -- are unhappy with us , &quot; Heffner says . &quot; Despite this industry ' s cult_of_personality , we don ' t rate producers or directors or studios but movies. &quot; Some argue that the 25-year-old group is , in some ways , as outmoded as the Motion_Picture Code that preceded it . &quot; The problem with the ratings board is that they ' re set_up to deal with one culture -- and we ' re in a multi-cultural society , &quot; observes Samuel Goldwyn Jr. , chairman of the Samuel Goldwyn Co . &quot; Words and language offensive to people in Greenwich , Conn. , may have no meaning in a black environment . There ' s a fear of language and a preference for violence -- which is actually a far greater threat . You can cut heads_off , sever hands . . . but don ' t let them use the ' f-word ' twice. &quot; Goldwyn knows whereof he speaks . His company picked_up Martin Lawrence ' s &quot; You So Crazy &quot; from Miramax after the movie was awarded an NC-17 . Releasing the movie with an adults-only designation may have embarrassed the family-oriented Disney , which purchased Miramax last June . But releasing it without a rating -- as the independent Goldwyn ultimately did -- is a luxury not afforded the major studios by the MPAA . &quot; You So Crazy &quot; -- despite the NC-17 flap -- performed well at the box_office , taking_in between $ 12 million and $ 13 million domestically . Though major movie chains such_as AMC and Cineplex Odeon agreed to play the picture , that ' s frequently not the case . Mall owners occasionally prohibit theaters from showing NC-17 films . Some newspapers and networks will not accept NC-17 advertising . And several video outfits , including Blockbuster , the largest , keep NC-17 movies off their shelves -- a policy that led Universal Pictures to release two versions of &quot; The Getaway &quot; : an R-rated theatrical version for Blockbuster as well as a steamier unrated one . &quot; The board is way behind the times -- not to mention the rest of the world -- when it comes_to sex , &quot; maintains director Phillip Noyce , who cut three minutes from &quot; Sliver &quot; to get the desired R rating . &quot; And it has very strange directives . I was told we couldn ' t show Sharon Stone moving when she was astride Billy Baldwin -- as though moving . . . enjoying the act . . . made_it more objectionable . The focus seemed to be more on the publicity surrounding the film and Stone ' s notoriety than on what was there on the screen . It ' s unfortunate that an organization set_up to avoid government censorship is so afraid of controversy that it bends over backward in regulating itself. &quot; * The R-rated &quot; Sliver &quot; grossed $ 37 million domestically , while the uncut version took_in more_than twice that overseas . That , according to Heffner , is at the heart of the_matter . &quot; Most of the criticism of the ratings_system comes from the fact that we are perceived to be taking money out of the pockets of people , &quot; he asserts . &quot; The lucrative contracts these directors sign requiring them to deliver an ' R ' make_for an incredible amount of hypocrisy . They want to maintain their ' vision ' ? Fine . Just release the movie with an NC-17. &quot; His successor concurs : &quot; We ' re not censoring or making artistic judgments about a given movie -- just providing information to help parents decide if their children should see it , &quot; says Mosk . &quot; The process is not a science . It ' s inherently subjective . But 74 % of those polled last October said they found the ratings ' very ' or ' fairly ' useful . The issue of what ' s appropriate in art and literature has been with us forever . People criticized the nudes on Michelangelo ' s Sistine Chapel ceiling -- and that was a deeply religious project commissioned by the Pope. &quot; Valenti points_out that all but two of the countries in the world -- Germany and Japan -- have government censorship that ranges from &quot; stern to substantial. &quot; Voluntarism , he ' s convinced , is a plus . &quot; I ' m not saying that we haven ' t made mistakes in rating the 11 # 773 movies we ' ve looked_at over the years , &quot; he admits . &quot; But the question -- as in all_of life -- is ' If not this . . . what ?
