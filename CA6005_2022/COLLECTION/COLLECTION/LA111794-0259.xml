   <HEADLINE> UKRAINE AGREES TO RELINQUISH NUCLEAR ARMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After three years of agonized wrangling , the Ukrainian Parliament closed another Cold_War chapter Wednesday by agreeing to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and surrender nuclear_weapons forever . However , lawmakers qualified their approval of the treaty by demanding that the United States , Britain , France and Russia sign an international agreement promising not to attack Ukraine militarily or economically after it dismantles its 1 # 800 nuclear_warheads , the third-largest atomic arsenal in the world . U.S. and Russian officials had lobbied hard to extract the agreement from a recalcitrant legislature that has long feared Ukraine ' s problems will drop to the bottom of the world ' s agenda once the former Soviet republic ceased to be a nuclear_power . Ukrainian President Leonid D . Kuchma warned of financial ruin and political ostracism if lawmakers insisted on keeping the 176 missiles left on Ukrainian territory when the Soviet_Union collapsed . &quot; What will the treaty give Ukraine ? &quot; Kuchma asked lawmakers . &quot; A good reputation , which we don ' t have now. &quot; The Parliament , or Rada , voted 301 to 8 , with 20 abstentions , to join the 160 other countries that have already signed the non-proliferation treaty . The vote means that Kuchma will get a more sympathetic reception when he makes his first_state visit to the United States next week and asks_for more help in reviving Ukraine ' s moribund economy . U.S. Ambassador William Miller , who watched the voting from the Rada gallery , predicted that the vote &quot; will clear the way for strengthening relations between the United States and Ukraine. &quot; In Washington , State_Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly applauded the ratification and said the Clinton_Administration &quot; takes a strong interest in Ukraine ' s independence , its sovereignty and its existing borders. &quot; &quot; We ' re prepared to offer security assurances to Ukraine once it has acceded_to the treaty , &quot; Shelly said . &quot; We have , of course , very strongly supported and encouraged Ukraine ' s accession to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapons state , &quot; she said . &quot; So we applaud the leadership exhibited by President Kuchma in bringing this very important treaty before the Rada. &quot; Russian officials also praised the treaty vote . &quot; Good news ! &quot; agreed Yuri Dubinin , Russia ' s special envoy to Ukraine on nuclear issues . Dubinin and others said the Ukrainian move should smooth negotiations that began Wednesday on other thorny Russian-Ukrainian problems , including dividing the Black_Sea Fleet and payment of Ukraine ' s huge energy debt to Russia . The move allows the United States , Russia and Ukraine to begin downsizing their bloated post-Cold War nuclear arsenals . Moscow has refused to implement the strategic arms reduction treaty START I , which would cut its nuclear stockpile by a third , until Ukraine joined the non-proliferation treaty . The 1968 pact , which is up for extension next spring , recognizes only five official nuclear_powers : the United States , the United Kingdom , France , China and what was once the Soviet_Union . Now four of the 15 former Soviet republics -- Russia , Ukraine , Kazakhstan and Belarus -- are nuclear_powers , although Kazakhstan and Belarus have already relinquished all claims to the weapons and agreed to dismantle them . Even as Ukrainian lawmakers ratified the non-proliferation treaty , they attached six qualifications and explanations , stating that the pact &quot; does not fully deal with the situation of a nuclear state -- the Soviet_Union -- collapsing. &quot; They also stated that the mere presence of nuclear_weapons on Ukrainian territory does not violate the treaty -- an apparent claim to the warheads until the day they are dismantled , leaving no room for Russia to try to regain them . &quot; We own nuclear_weapons , &quot; Kuchma told an unusually silent chamber . &quot; But we don ' t control them. &quot; At the moment , Russia has launch control over the missiles and could theoretically fire them without Ukrainian consent . However , Moscow has pledged to honor a veto from Kiev on their use . An agreement signed by Russia , the United States and Ukraine in January committed Ukraine to rid itself of all its warheads within seven years . However , Kuchma reminded the deputies that an unpublished side agreement between Ukraine and Russia last spring committed Ukraine to transfer the warheads to Russia within 2 1 / 2 years in exchange for fuel for nuclear_power plants . &quot; Those caught_up in the passions of false patriotism should remember that Ukraine can ' t make nuclear_weapons , and it can ' t even use the warheads it inherited , &quot; Kuchma said . &quot; Just creating a system for safely maintaining the weapons it has would cost $ 10 billion to $ 30 billion. &quot; Kuchma once headed the giant factory that produced missiles , and he opposed the treaty until he was elected president in July . Lawmakers apparently were impressed by his conversion to the disarmament cause . &quot; When Kuchma talks nukes , lawmakers listen , &quot; parliamentary adviser Petro Matiaszek said . In the end , with $ 4 billion in promised Western aid in the balance , Kuchma told lawmakers that further delay would be unacceptable . &quot; We have no choice , &quot; the president said . Ukraine ' s access to world markets for its space launchers had been blocked because it had not joined the non-proliferation treaty . Now , the technology-minded Kuchma expects to sign a space cooperation agreement with the United States during his visit next week . To sweeten the pie , Kuchma ' s trip was bumped_up from simply an official visit to a state visit , complete with a white-tie dinner rare for the Clinton_Administration . Ukrainian officials have delighted in telling reporters that only Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin has been so honored by the Clinton White_House . &quot; This is a triumph for Ukrainian diplomacy and Ukrainian independence , &quot; Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko said . Just hours before the vote , Ukrainian officials announced that they had achieved final agreement on security guarantees from the United States , Russia , Britain and France . The leaders of the four nuclear_powers and Ukraine are expected to sign a document to that effect at a meeting in Budapest , Hungary , in early December . Nevertheless , the security guarantees compel the nuclear four only to consult one another if Ukraine is attacked ; they do not oblige the Western nations to defend Ukraine militarily . Times staff writer Efron reported from Moscow and special correspondent Mycio from Kiev .</TEXT>
