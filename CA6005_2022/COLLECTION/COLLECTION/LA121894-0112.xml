   <TEXT> We have read &quot; The Taiwan Connection &quot; ( by Marlowe Hood , Oct . 9 ) with disappointment and feel obliged to register our protest . The article ' s figures for the kilos of heroin seized in Taiwan were incorrect . Except in 1980 and 1981 , more_than three kilos of heroin were seized each year in the 1980s , and in 1983 , 1984 and 1986-89 , more_than 10 kilos were confiscated . True , the year 1993 was a peak year , with 1 # 113.9 kilos of heroin seized , but the first eight months of 1993 saw a 30 % decline in the amount confiscated . The figure was 579.63 kilos , not 1 # 000 kilos as the article stated . Taiwan is not a transit point for drugs or illegal immigrants . The accusation that Taiwan is a major transit area rests primarily on the assumption that &quot; the massive amounts of heroin seized is far in excess of the amount needed to supply the Republic_of_China ' s domestic needs , &quot; according to a 1993 FBI report cited in the article . However , the number of drug abusers may total 240 # 000-480 # 000 people , and the republic ' s &quot; domestic needs &quot; have created a large market that consumes thousands of kilos of heroin and methamphetamines each year . It is inconceivable for drug_traffickers to smuggle heroin into Taiwan and run a great risk again by smuggling it out_to the United States when it can be readily sold in Taiwan at good prices . No political corruption has been found so far . The 1993 International Narcotic Control Strategy Report published by the State_Department in April , 1994 , states that &quot; authorities are increasingly involved in combatting the rapidly growing drug-abuse problem . Taiwan ' s drug laws are being strengthened. &quot; Accusations of high officials who are involved in the smuggling rings have never been independently verified either by U.S. officials or authorities of the republic . We welcome any information in this regard . Finally , the article incorrectly quoted Justice Minister Ma as saying , when asked whether any linkages remained between the government and organized crime , &quot; That was a long_time ago. &quot; In fact , the minister does not know about any of these &quot; links &quot; and would appreciate being apprised of any evidence of corruption involving officials . Ying-chao Wu , director Department of Prosecutorial Affairs Ministry of Justice Taipei , Taiwan * Hood responds : According to Taiwan ' s government-run China News_Agency , on April 15 , 1993 , &quot; police seized an average of 3 or 4 kilos of ( heroin ) each year before 1989 , &quot; a figure confirmed by Taiwan ' s National Police Administration . But even if Wu ' s marginally higher figures are correct , the point is that seizures soared 819 % between 1990 and 1993 . As for 1994 , the same NPA source showed me an internal report indicating that more_than 900 kilos had been seized as of May . Taiwan no doubt faces a growing drug-abuse problem . But surely Wu does not mean , as his calculations suggest , that one in 25 inhabitants of Taiwan is a heroin_addict . Wu also attempts a statistical sleight-of-hand : Most of the 47 # 836 drug offenders convicted in 1993 abused amphetamines ( &quot; ice &quot; ) , not heroin . As for &quot; re-export , &quot; yes , it does make_sense for a drug_trafficker . Until recently , at least , Taiwan was less suspect to U.S. Customs as a &quot; port of origin &quot; than , say , Thailand . Wu asserts that &quot; no political corruption has been uncovered so far. &quot; This year alone his ministry indicted more_than 300 politicians , including 38 % of all local councilors , in the worst vote-buying scandal in Taiwan ' s history . Then there is the case of a naval_officer murdered after uncovering major corruption in arms procurement . One year later , tape-recorded evidence has been mysteriously erased and multiple investigations have stalled . These cases are not related to immigrant smuggling and drugs , but they do point to criminality and corruption in high places . Multiple revisions and editing resulted in my quoting Ma somewhat out of context . What he referred to as happening &quot; a long_time ago &quot; was not links between organized_crime and government in_general but the specific example of the 1984 murder of journalist Henry Liu , a naturalized U.S. citizen who published an unflattering biography of Taiwan ' s then-President Chiang Chingkuo .</TEXT>
