   <HEADLINE> TRACKING THE SCENT ; A SNIFF CAN TURN YOU HUNGRY OR WARN YOU TO RUN . DR . JAMES EVANS IS STUDYING WHY SOME PEOPLE ' S SENSE OF SMELL STINKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It only happens now and then , and only for a_few precious seconds : the quickest whiff of blooming flowers , of coffee brewing , of bacon grilling , of freshly cut grass . Then , nothing . No smells at all . Not noxious odors , not glorious , evocative scents . that ' s what it ' s like for Toni La Motta of San Diego . One tantalizing perception , then her olfactory mechanism , for some reason , shuts down . It ' s been like that , she says , since high_school , more_than 30 years ago . And , until recently , she never found a doctor who seemed to care . &quot; It ' s very annoying to me that the medical_profession has ignored it , &quot; La Motta said . &quot; It ' s like it ' s really not an issue . Most doctors , when you tell them you have no sense_of_smell , say , ' So what ? Live with it. ' &quot; But not Dr. James Evans of UC Irvine . Instead , Evans will seal you inside a dark , soundproof cubicle , stick electrodes all_over your head , wire you up_to a lab full of computers and diagnostic gizmos , stick a plastic tube into one of your nostrils and blow various scents into your nose . Evans , an assistant_professor of neurology and the director of the Chemical Senses Clinic at UCI , is out_to help people such_as La Motta smell the roses . Since 1987 , Evans has been researching the brain triggers ( he calls them &quot; olfactory-evoked potentials &quot; ) that allow us to distinguish smells ; about a year ago he developed an intricate and highly_sensitive system to measure olfactory_perception . In recent months , he has used the high-tech system to measure olfactory and neurological responses in some 70 test patients , from head injury victims to allergy sufferers to victims of neurological_disease to even more mysterious cases such_as La Motta ' s . Through his research , Evans hopes to identify more accurately the causes for loss of smell ( and , by extension in most cases , loss of the sense_of_taste ) and develop methods to treat them . It can , he said , be a mysterious process , but he has at least one biological advantage . &quot; One of the interesting things about olfactory_nerves , &quot; Evans said , &quot; is that they die and regenerate regularly. &quot; This means that in some cases of loss of the sense_of_smell , it may be possible to stimulate the growth of olfactory_nerves and thereby resurrect that sense . I n Evans ' lab , he and a group of assistants are refining techniques to differentiate between loss of sense_of_smell because of trauma to the olfactory_nerves ( such_as a head injury ) and loss because of inhalation of toxic substances , or because of allergies or possibly because of neurological_disorders such_as Alzheimer ' s disease . These diagnostic techniques range from measurement of brain activity to the Jelly Belly test . The Jelly Belly test is actually an informal demonstration of how the olfactory receptors , which are in the upper part of the nose , work . Evans offers a visitor two or three Jelly Bellies ( a popular , small and highly flavorful variety of jelly_beans ) and asks the visitor to pinch his nose before popping the candy in his mouth . The result : a vague sense that something sweet is in the mouth but there is no discernible taste . However , once the nostrils are released , there is a sudden burst of taste : strawberry , coconut or grape . This is , Evans said , one way to gauge what is known as &quot; conductive loss &quot; ( odors can ' t reach the olfactory receptors ) and &quot; general loss &quot; ( in which the olfactory_nerves have been sheared in an accident ) . Dorothy Cotton , an 83-year-old test subject from Newport Beach , said she suspects that her inability to smell may be tied to conductive loss . &quot; It came_on slowly , &quot; she said , &quot; and I think it may be tied with my sinuses . It ' s been at least 15 years that I haven ' t been able to smell. &quot; In the lab tests , she said , she still could smell nothing . However , she said , Evans recommended she take zinc supplements for two months , discontinue the nose drops she was using and substitute antihistamines to clear her sinuses . Zinc , explained Evans , can be depleted by certain types of viruses that can also affect smell . &quot; I can taste sweet and sour and salty on my tongue , no problem , &quot; Cotton said after starting the zinc treatments . &quot; But if you blindfolded me I would n ' t know what I was eating . You learn to appreciate some foods by the sight of them , but eating is a pleasure . I would give a lot to have my taste working again. &quot; Another rather low-tech test in the lab is called &quot; forced choice , &quot; in which patients are given two small squeeze bottles , one imbued with an odor and the other odorless , and asked to identify the one with the odor . The odors are not all_the same strength , however , because researchers have found that &quot; the smelling scale ( is ) analogous to the decibel scale , &quot; Evans said . That is , just as there are degrees of deafness , Evans said , one person may be able to smell an odor only in a strong concentration , while another may be aware of it in its weakest strength . For instance , a low concentration of amyl acetate smells like bananas to a subject with healthy olfactory apparatus , while a very strong concentration can smell like airplane glue . &quot; At different concentrations they have different qualities , &quot; said Evans , &quot; from quite noxious and foul to quite pleasant. &quot; It has been found , Evans said , that some people suffer from a condition called &quot; specific anosmia , &quot; a kind of olfactory color_blindness in which the person cannot smell certain smells but can perceive most others . To test for this , the lab stocks a catalogue of more_than 50 aromas . &quot; There may be no genetic receptor in a person for a certain class of odors , &quot; Evans said . &quot; And it appears to run in families . There are about 150 types of odor receptors , which means that we can identify that many classes of smells. &quot; Unless something goes_wrong . Then patients may find themselves attached_to the most advanced of Evans ' testing apparatus . The entire system measures olfactory evoked potentials ( OEP ) -- brain activity in response to stimulus of olfactory receptors in the nose . Evans said he developed the technique of measuring OEP in rats at UCI in 1987 but has been using the present system , which he also developed for about a year on various human test subjects . At its most basic , the system involves nothing more_than air and smell . It ' s the measuring that elevates the process . It works like this : The patient is fitted with several scalp electrodes to measure brain activity and is plugged into a console inside a dark , soundproof booth ( the only stimulus Evans wants is through the nose ) . A small plastic nozzle is fitted into one nostril , and a gentle stream of air is directed through it into the patient ' s nose . For the most part , the airstream is clean . But at intervals , a machine outside the booth emits a click . This means that for 4 / 100 of a second , what Evans calls &quot; a pulse of odor &quot; is introduced into the stream . Computers measure any brain_wave activity that occurs at that instant . This entire process allows Evans and his researchers to locate , among other things , the possible source of loss of brain response . Treatment , Evans said , depends_on the cause . In the case of a head injury , the nerves may regenerate on_their_own , or there may be no hope for treatment . Sometimes , he said , traditional respiratory therapy can bring_back some function . Polyps , benign growths , allergies , swelling , infections , sinusitis -- all can be treated to different degrees . However , he said , matters become more murky when patients are affected by neural degenerative diseases such_as Alzheimer ' s disease , Parkinson ' s disease and Korsakoff ' s psychosis ( seen in alcoholics ) . &quot; Smells will bring_back strong memories to you , &quot; Evans said , &quot; and all_of these diseases are associated in some way with memory loss. &quot; Partly because of this , he said , &quot; olfactory loss may be one of the first things to go &quot; in a patient suffering from such diseases . Research is continuing into drug therapy for neural disorders , and Evans called the work &quot; promising. &quot; However , the tie-in remains a mystery . Depression is common among people with loss of smell , said Evans , although he added that &quot; after years , many resign themselves to it and find ways of stimulating what receptors they have with salt and spices. &quot; Still , there is yet another factor to consider : safety . Without a sense_of_smell , fires and natural-gas leaks can go unnoticed . La Motta knows this . &quot; I remember an incident in high_school , &quot; said La Motta , a 48-year-old writer and teacher who participated in Evans ' research , &quot; when we were doing a hydrogen_sulfide experiment , and I couldn ' t smell anything in the lab. &quot; Later in life , she said , &quot; I ' d be in the living_room and there would be smoke all_over from the kitchen . I ' d be reading and absorbed and not even notice . One of my major problems today is that I burn things frequently in the kitchen . &quot; There are some times when it ' s scary , especially if I leave the house and don ' t know something ' s burning . And the ( cat_box ) is worrisome . My friends have to tell me to change the ( cat-box filler ) . &quot; During her testing at UCI , La Motta said she &quot; felt &quot; the smell in her nose during her time in the booth but didn ' t actually smell it . &quot; It was fascinating to me , though , because he was actually measuring it . I ' ve been through acupuncture , to several doctors . They all said they can cure it , and nobody has . I hope this time it ' s different . &quot; People joke with me all_the time and say I ' m lucky , but I don ' t see it . I can ' t smell roses or the spring or the ocean. &quot; How Sense_of_Smell Works Most people can distinguish thousands of different odors , whether foul or fragrant , with a simple sniff of the nose . For people without a sense_of_smell , food doesn ' t taste as good , flowers and perfume evoke no special memories , and potential hazards signaled by noxious odors go unnoticed . 1 . Airborne molecules of a rose travel through nasal passages . 2 . Molecules dissolve in mucous_membrane . 3 . Receptor cells are stimulated , then generate nerve_impulses . 4 . Nerve_impulses travel through olfactory_nerve to the olfactory bulb . 5 . Olfactory bulb analyzes impulses and sends them to brain , which identifies the smell . A Perfect Match : Scientists believe the smell process occurs when there is a physical connection between odor molecules and receptor sites . Bleach molecules , for example , would only fit with receptors on some cells , while the odor molecules of a rose would only fit on receptors on the other cells . Fast Facts : Women , on average , have a better sense_of_smell than men . Older people typically lose their sense_of_smell . Changes in ability to smell may be an early sign of Alzheimer ' s and Parkinson ' s diseases . Cigarette smoke and other airborne toxins can lessen or distort sense_of_smell . People with depression , schizophrenia or other psychological disorders can develop dysosmia , a condition that makes them believe that something pleasant-smelling has a bad odor .
