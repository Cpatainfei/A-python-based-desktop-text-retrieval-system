   <HEADLINE> RESTIVE POLAND LOOKS FOR ITS PLACE IN EUROPE AND NATO ; GOVERNMENT : WARSAW HOPES TO JOIN THE WEST AND STILL MAINTAIN TIES WITH FORMER SOVIET BLOC ALLIES . BUT MORE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGE MUST COME FIRST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Five years after the fall of communism , Poland seems adrift , unsure where it fits into an evolving Europe or how to make its restive people happy . It wants to join the European Union and NATO , but more economic and political change must come first . It wants to stay friendly with its former Warsaw Pact allies and serve as a bridge to the West , but some Russian officials prefer that their buffer with NATO be more neutral . On the surface , Poland is doing_well . Europe ' s fastest-growing economy expanded by more_than 4 % last year and the Finance Ministry predicts that rate will continue for five years . Shops that once offered scant supplies of poor-quality goods are filled with Levis , Sony TVs and IBM computers . Retail sales jumped by 48 % last year . McDonald ' s , Pizza Hut and other fast-food outlets do a brisk business . But while some people are getting rich from the new capitalism , most are closer to the average monthly wage of $ 200 and find the plentiful luxuries beyond their means . The growing gap between rich and poor seems to be generating animosity . &quot; Poland is trying to reform its economy , but the process is difficult and the path from communism to capitalism is long , &quot; President Lech Walesa said . &quot; Western countries were constructing their capitalist systems for 200 years . We have to do this and adjust ourselves within a decade. &quot; Prime_Minister Waldemar Pawlak said that &quot; changing the social consciousness has proved to be the most difficult and time-consuming problem. &quot; Poland ' s 40 million citizens have learned the hard way that democracy and capitalism carry responsibility , the risk of failure and a much smaller social safety net than communism provided . A recent government report said 42.5 % of Poles are living below the poverty_line ( 45 % of national average pay ) , more_than double the 20.5 % in 1989 . So displeased are the people about not benefiting more quickly from the painful economic reforms that one opinion poll indicated one-third would willingly return to communism . Only one in 10 of those questioned felt his family ' s standard_of_living had improved . To counter the complaints , officials cite the shortages and limits on individual freedoms that characterized the old system . &quot; Poland today is better than the one before ' 89 despite the problems and frustrations of many people , who truly have reasons to be frustrated , &quot; said Aleksander Kwasniewski , a former Communist sports minister and probable candidate in next year ' s presidential elections . Kwasniewski leads one of the two parties in the governing coalition formed after the parliamentary elections of September , 1993 . In a backlash against reform , voters flocked to political groups that grew out of the old Communist_Party . Poland wants to join NATO as a safeguard against possible upheaval in the former Soviet_Union , but needs time and help to bring its military equipment and training up_to the alliance ' s standards . Tadeusz Iwinski , a member of the Foreign Affairs Commission in Parliament , said Poland &quot; is still looking_for its place in the international arena : It is no longer a country with limited sovereignty , but it is neither a NATO member nor a neutral country. &quot; Poland could play a pivotal role in the region . Washington has designated it as one of the 10 &quot; big emerging markets &quot; because of its capacity for growth and leadership , and President Clinton is scheduled to visit in mid-July . &quot; With national security and economic security increasingly intertwined , Poland is important both as a potential market for American goods and as a stable , growing economy in what is still a precarious region , &quot; U.S. Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown said last month . Private enterprise has boomed , and now accounts_for about 60 % of the gross_domestic_product . Poland has an association agreement with the European Union and has applied for full membership , but that is unlikely before 2000 and will be followed by a 10-year adjustment period . Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski believes agricultural policy will be the most difficult problem . Poland ' s farmers , a powerful lobby , are notoriously inefficient . About 8 million tons of potatoes rot each year , and too many are of low_quality . Unemployment is running about 16 % , or 3 million people . Although inflation has declined dramatically , it jumped 5 % in the first three months of 1994 and is forecast to total 23 % for the year . An estimated 1.5 million families do not have homes of_their_own and the building industry produced only 88 # 000 new apartments last year . Outdated factories and cars belch pollution . Coal still provides nearly two-thirds of the power . The road , telecommunications and utility systems are in poor condition . Organized crime and tax_evasion are increasing . The corruption that became entrenched under communism has been hard to root_out . With other former Soviet bloc countries suffering their own economic problems , Poland has been forced to seek new markets and foreign capital to help modernize its industry . Jozef Biskup , co-author of a report based on a survey of 570 foreign investors , said they like Poland because of its rapid economic development , the size of its market and the cheap labor . It also provides access to a free-trade zone being established by Poland , Hungary , Slovakia and the Czech Republic . But Biskup said investors are put_off by the red_tape , lack of good managers and unstable tax_system . Political stability also has become a question . Acrimony within government has increased , particularly between Walesa and the governing coalition . Five years ago , the confrontational Walesa was the country ' s most popular person as head of Solidarity , Eastern Europe ' s first free-trade union and the main force in bringing_down communism . With just a year of his presidency left , however , he found himself fifth in a recent poll of potential candidates . Kwasniewski was No . 1 . In September , Solidarity ' s political_movement did not even get the 5 % of the vote required for inclusion in Parliament . Still , despite all_the problems , officials say Poland ' s general course needs only minor corrections . &quot; No rational political group can think_about changing things now , &quot; Kwasniewski said . &quot; We have a good climate . We don ' t know how long it will last . This kind of chance may_not come again. &quot;</TEXT>
