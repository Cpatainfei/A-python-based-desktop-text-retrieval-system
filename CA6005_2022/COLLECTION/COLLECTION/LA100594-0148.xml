   <TEXT> For even the most happily married_couple , planning a child ' s wedding or bar mitzvahcan lead to skirmishes over everything from the price_tag to the guest list . Your mate says that if you don ' t invite Uncle Leo , you will scandalize the family ; you worry that Uncle Leo ' s tendency to hit the nearest bottle and hit on the nearest blonde will scandalize the family . If these blessed events are difficult for the happily married_couple to negotiate , imagine what a source of strife they can be for the couple that ' s divorced or divorcing . So perhaps it ' s no surprise that some former or soon-to-be-former couples are bringing such issues to divorce mediators . And mediators , who usually hammer_out divorce agreements that cover such matters as child custody and alimony , are helping them come_to terms on everything from color_schemes to flower_arrangements . It ' s not happening so frequently that you ' d call it a trend , but several mediators say they have had occasion to mediate children ' s weddings and bar and bat_mitzvahs in the course of their parents ' divorces . Barbara Aaron , a Hartford , Conn. , lawyer who ' s been doing divorce mediations for five years , says she is currently mediating a bar_mitzvah -- her first -- for a couple handling the rest of the divorce in the courts . &quot; I ' m not mediating the whole divorce , I ' m just mediating that piece of it , &quot; Aaron says . &quot; They ' re in litigation . And litigation , as we all know , takes a long_time , and the court system doesn ' t accommodate bar_mitzvahs and bat_mitzvahs , so they needed to get this issue handled. &quot; Mediators are often lawyers who also handle litigated divorces , or psychologists or psychiatrists who work with lawyers to put_together agreements that will be accepted by the courts . Rather than hiring two lawyers and sicking them on each other in court , couples can sit_down with a mediator and put_together an agreement that they can then present to the court as their settlement . It is cheaper . &quot; Our average one is about $ 3 # 500 , but without kids it might be $ 1 # 500 , something like that , &quot; says Bonnie Robson at the Family Law Mediation Service at the Institute of Living . &quot; It really depends_on how complicated the asset picture is . And also how agreeable the parties are . You know , lawyers always say that an angry divorce is an expensive divorce. &quot; A mediated divorce can cost anywhere between $ 2 # 000 and $ 6 # 000 , depending_on the complexity of the case , Aaron says . Compare that to a litigated case where two lawyers are duplicating each other ' s efforts , and every hour they spend waiting around the courthouse is billable . &quot; I mediated a divorce that ended_up costing the parties somewhere around $ 4 # 000 to $ 5 # 000 , &quot; Aaron says . &quot; If they ( had ) litigated this divorce , it would probably have cost them each minimally $ 15 # 000 to $ 25 # 000 apiece . Because it was a complicated case , there were children involved , there were a lot of assets. &quot; It is faster . In some areas , a mediated divorce can be completed in 90 days . A litigated divorce can take anywhere from two to four years . &quot; I ' ve got a case that ' s just coming_up for trial in October , &quot; Aaron says . &quot; And the case was started two years ago. &quot; And , as a rule , it is much less nasty . &quot; I sometimes see clients who are in the midst of litigating a divorce , and boy , how they end_up hurting each other and becoming very suspicious of each other and the thousands of dollars that they spend on litigation , and I just know it ' s not necessary for most of them , &quot; says Dr. Leslie Strong , a mediator and president of the Connecticut Assn . for Marriage and Family Therapy . &quot; Some people seem to require the catharsis of a battle . Most people really don ' t. &quot; The people most likely to seek mediation , Strong says , tend to be those for whom &quot; the family is bigger than their hurt or anger over the divorce. &quot; He cites the example of one couple he worked with whose son was getting_married even as they were getting divorced . &quot; Much of their discussion was about how to cope_with the wedding , &quot; Strong says . &quot; It seemed ironic to them to be going_to the wedding of their son while at_the_same_time knowing they were getting a divorce , and it kind of tinged the wedding with sadness , but they handled themselves with a lot of consideration. &quot; Despite the fact that mediation has been available for many years , mediators ( perhaps not surprisingly ) argue that it ' s still not as popular as it ought to be . A lot of people , seemingly unaware of the option , still choose to go_through litigation ' s gantlet . And , Robson says , more_than half the cases that come_before family court are &quot; post-judgment &quot; matters , &quot; people who are already divorced and there ' s something going_on and someone isn ' t complying with a part of the agreement. &quot; One solution to that problem , some mediators say , is something called mediation-arbitration , in which the mediator would be empowered to make binding decisions whena disagreement comes_up . Lloyd Frauenglass , a Glastonbury , Conn. , lawyer who has been mediating divorces for about 15 years , is a strong proponent of that approach . &quot; The arbitration process is that you present your evidence just like you do to a judge and the arbitrator makes a decision , &quot; Frauenglass says . &quot; Not a recommendation , a decision . You try to mediate , you do all_the things that help people to get unstuck. &quot; Other mediators have suggested that even couples who are not divorced or divorcing might find mediation a useful tool for resolving conflicts over big life decisions . &quot; Couples are not always in_agreement even if they stay married and even if they have a good marriage , &quot; Robson says . &quot; And what a mediator is is really a neutral third_party who can help identify what the issues are and what issues they ' re in_agreement about and what issues they ' re in conflict about and help them reach an agreement on it. &quot; In other words , a mediator might even help you solve the problem of Uncle Leo .</TEXT>
