   <HEADLINE> BRITAIN , IRELAND NOT DISSUADED ON ULSTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The British and Irish governments agreed Saturday that Sinn Fein ' s failure to accept their offer of negotiations will not stop the search for compromise in Northern_Ireland . British Prime_Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart , Albert Reynolds , told reporters outside Major ' s 10 Downing St . residence that their priority now is to start fresh talks with moderate parties in the_British province . The two leaders continue to fan hopes of attaining the big goal : a permanent Irish_Republican_Army cease-fire to pave the way for Sinn Fein , the IRA ' s political wing , to join peace talks . Major , Reynolds and key aides discussed their Northern_Ireland initiative for 75 minutes before going together to an Ireland-England rugby match . The meeting underscored their determination to speak with one voice on Northern_Ireland and to maintain pressure on Sinn Fein , which will hold its annual conference next weekend in Dublin , to reject IRA violence . Reynolds and Major on Dec . 15 announced that renouncing violence was necessary for Sinn Fein to be included in negotiations . In an interview with the_British Broadcasting Corp. , Reynolds said he thinks that the Sinn Fein-IRA leadership cannot agree on what to do . &quot; For them to come_to a decision of historic proportions will inevitably take time , &quot; he said . The IRA so far has signaled no change . Hours before Major and Reynolds met , a firebomb destroyed a newspaper vendor ' s shop and damaged six other stores in central London . There was no immediate claim of responsibility , but police suspected the IRA . Violence in Northern_Ireland has continued at a relatively low but lethal clip . Last week , the IRA attacked several army and police patrols , killing one policeman Thursday in a rocket attack . Protestant gunmen determined to preserve British rule wounded a 52-year-old Roman_Catholic man and twice struck Sinn Fein ' s west Belfast headquarters -- first with a rocket , then with gunfire that injured three workers . Major and Reynolds believe British-Irish solidarity will gradually undermine the IRA justification for violence -- that Britain holds Northern_Ireland against the will of most Irish_people . Their Dec . 15 &quot; framework for peace &quot; committed both governments to support any compromise formula that most Northern_Ireland citizens would accept , ranging from continued British rule to union with the_Irish republic .</TEXT>
