   <HEADLINE> GOP EXPECTS A BONANZA AS POLLS SHOW HARM FROM WHITEWATER ; POLITICS : SOME REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS SAY IMPACT COULD EXTEND TO FALL ELECTIONS . WILL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM CLINTON ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Republican strategists , already savoring the discomfort inflicted on President Clinton by the burgeoning Whitewater controversy , now hope to reap a much larger political bonanza . With polls showing Whitewater hurting both the President and the First_Lady , some GOP officials said that the impact could extend_to Democrats running in next November ' s congressional races and inflict long-term damage on the national party as_a_whole . Rep . Bill Paxon ( R-N.Y. ) , chairman of the GOP Congressional Campaign Committee , said Thursday that Clinton is becoming &quot; a serious liability &quot; to Democratic candidates . A year ago they would have sought his support , he said , but &quot; a majority of them now probably will distance themselves from him. &quot; If Republicans register gains in Congress and Clinton is further weakened , the result could be a major setback in the Democrats ' efforts to regain their old dominance of national politics . And the GOP has developed a two-part strategy to pursue that goal . Republicans in Congress are keeping_up attacks that have already led to the appointment of a special Whitewater counsel , the firing of White_House lawyer Bernard Nussbaum and heavy pressure for full-blown congressional hearings . At the same time , GOP Chairman Haley Barbour , in Denver attending a national meeting of state Republican chairmen , said that the party ' s strategy outside Washington is to leave Whitewater to the press . Almost daily reports of document shredding , improper White_House meetings and other alleged misconduct have kept the White_House on the defensive and the issue at a fast boil . &quot; The Democrats have this fraudulent defense that it ' s all being stirred_up by the Republicans , &quot; Barbour said . &quot; When the Washington Post , L.A. Times and New York Times dig all this stuff up , they can ' t say it ' s Republicans doing it. &quot; Republicans have been attacking Clinton on the Whitewater issue for several months and Barbour , in an interview with Denver Post editors Wednesday , declared that , while he doesn ' t know what the Clintons did , &quot; they are doing the best job of looking guilty I ' ve ever seen. &quot; On the other hand , Democrats in Congress have launched similar steady attacks on Republican presidents in the past . Democrats dogged President George_Bush in the controversy over diversion of U.S. aid that helped arm Iraq in the years before the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War . They also attacked President Ronald Reagan over the Iran-Contra scandal , which involved sale of U.S. arms to Iran in exchange for the release of American hostages , with proceeds from those sales going_to finance Contra rebels in Nicaragua . In both cases the Democratic majority in Congress conducted sweeping hearings into the controversies -- a step that it is now resisting on Whitewater . Some GOP officials attending the Denver meeting , apparently unaware of Barbour ' s strategy of leaving Whitewater to the press , were outspoken in saying that it would hurt the Democrats . California Republican Chairman Tirso del Junco called Whitewater &quot; more serious than Watergate &quot; and Jeanie Austin , who jointly chairs the Republican National Committee , called it &quot; definitely a negative for Democrats. &quot; Barbour said that he has refused to go_on television to discuss the issue and &quot; abet my adversaries ' defense. &quot; Democrats , he said , tried to get him to appear on television with Democratic Chairman David Wilhelm &quot; but I ' ve turned them down . It would make_it look political. &quot; Wilhelm said that he had agreed to go_on a television_show with Barbour , but he vehemently denied that Democrats had tried to get the Republican chairman to participate . &quot; I ' m happy to go_on television with him , &quot; Wilhelm said . &quot; that ' s a pretty transparent argument he ' s making . The Republican_Party is basing its entire strategy on Whitewater . It ' s their great political hope . They have nothing to say on health_care or welfare reform or anything else. &quot; Some Republicans , including former Vice_President Dan Quayle , have raised the specter of Watergate . And Rep . James H . Quillen ( R-Tenn. ) , who has called_on Clinton to resign , said that all telephone_calls to his office have favored his position . But Rep . Jim Leach ( R-Iowa ) , who has led the attack in the House , insisted that , while he expects hearings into Whitewater eventually to produce &quot; a blockbuster , &quot; he believes that any remedies for wrongdoing will be civil rather than criminal . Sen . Alfonse M . D ' Amato ( R-N.Y. ) , who has pressed the attack in the Senate and pushed for congressional hearings , insists that &quot; this is not an attempt to injure the presidency. &quot; But his attacks have gotten under the President ' s skin . &quot; The Republicans have decided that Sen . D ' Amato will be the ethical spokesman for the Republican_Party in the Congress , &quot; Clinton declared at one of two press_conferences this week at which he discussed Whitewater . The comment was a sarcastic reference_to an old Senate Ethics Committee inquiry that ended in 1991 with a rebuke of D ' Amato for not preventing his brother from using his office on behalf of a defense_contractor . Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) has dismissed the idea of congressional hearings as &quot; a political circus &quot; and said : &quot; All they want to do is to throw_up a lot of dust and embarrass the President. &quot; And several Democratic senators , including John D . ( Jay ) Rockefeller IV of West_Virginia and Tom Daschle of South_Dakota , rose to Clinton ' s defense on the Senate floor Thursday . But Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , declaring that Congress has a clear right to conduct hearings , said : &quot; Let ' s stop all_the finger-pointing and let ' s get_on_with the hearings. &quot; Sen . Phil Gramm ( R-Tex. ) , chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee , said whether Whitewater remains an issue in the future will &quot; depend mostly on what the President does now , and to a secondary extent what he did_in the past. &quot; Times staff writers Karen Tumulty and William J . Eaton in Washington and special correspondent Kristina Lindgren in Denver contributed to this story .</TEXT>
