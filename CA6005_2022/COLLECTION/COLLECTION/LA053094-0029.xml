   <TEXT> Your May 18 article on the possible relationship of cancer growth in mice to the antihistamines loratadine , astemizole and Atarax is of interest , but need not be of concern to allergy sufferers . There is published data showing that cancer occurs less commonly in individuals with allergic disease , indicating that histamine , the chemical that causes sneezing and running of the nose , may protect against tumor growth.Other articles refute the concept that individuals with allergies have less cancer . Antihistamines have been used in man for over 50 years and are considered to be among the safest medications . Numerous cold remedies contain antihistamines as well . Nonetheless , multiple studies have not revealed an increase in cancer prevalence in allergic patients . The most concern for the results of the study reported should be for mice injected with tumors by cancer researchers , and not for allergy patients seeking and receiving welcome symptomatic relief . If we allowed animal research to dictate drugs used in humans , penicillin would never have been produced . When injected into guinea_pigs , penicillin produces paralysis and death . It has saved lives of hundreds of millions of humans since World_War_II . M . MICHAEL GLOVSKY MD Director , Asthma and Allergy Center Huntington Memorial Hospital Pasadena</TEXT>
