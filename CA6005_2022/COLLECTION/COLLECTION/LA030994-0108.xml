   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; AUSTRALIA SKEPTICAL ABOUT TOUGH U.S. TRADE STANCE WITH JAPAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even here , seemingly far away from the economic frictions between Washington and Tokyo , the Clinton_Administration is finding that it cannot avoid listening to people worry about the impact of the aggressive American efforts to open_up Japanese markets . In two days of talks with Australian officials , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher found himself repeatedly defending the Administration ' s Japan policy and its tough trade stance . In fact , the Administration ' s efforts appear to have made Australians angrier at the United States than at Japan . That may seem paradoxical , because U.S. officials have repeatedly emphasized that the changes in importing behavior that the Clinton_Administration is seeking from Japan will benefit all countries , not just the United States . &quot; We think we ' re doing God ' s work in trying to open_up Japan ' s market for everybody , including Australia , &quot; Winston Lord , assistant secretary_of_state for East Asia , quipped Tuesday . Those words carry special resonance in Asia , a region of the world where the memories of missionaries are particularly strong and not always pleasant . Despite these American assurances , some Australians , including high-level officials , are nervous that Japan will wind_up buying more goods from America and less from Australia . In other words , the argument goes , whatever American intentions may be , in the end Australia will be harmed : Japan won ' t increase its overall level of_imports from the world . Rather , Tokyo will seek to satisfy or mollify the United States by increasing Japanese imports from America and cutting_back on its purchases from Australia . Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan said last weekend that the government of Prime_Minister Paul Keating worries that the United States will open_up the Japanese market &quot; at our expense. &quot; &quot; We understand why the U.S. , like Australia and the rest of the world , supports the opening_up of the Japanese market , but we don ' t support anyone doing_it in a unilateral or discriminatory way , &quot; McMullan said . One reason for Australia ' s concern : Some of its most important export industries compete directly with U.S. companies in the Japanese market . Japan could , for example , buy more American beef and cut_back on purchases from Australia . Australia also exports some auto parts to Japan , which could be affected by U.S. pressure to get Tokyo to agree to buy more American auto parts . Such fears are heightened by Australia ' s recent experience with American grain sales . Both the United States and Australia are among the world ' s leading wheat exporters . When the United States began subsidizing agricultural exports to help American farmers compete with similarly subsidized competitors from Europe , Australians found their wheat exports suffered . It is possible that Australian fears are being encouraged by some Japanese . A Japanese academic official reportedly said here recently that any increases in Japan ' s imports from the United States will come_out of Japan ' s purchases from Australia . Japan is now Australia ' s leading trading partner . The United States ranks No . 2 on the list , behind Japan , both as a market for Australian exports and as a supplier of goods to Australia . Lord said American officials have been explaining to the Australian government &quot; that our position has been somewhat distorted . Obviously , Japan is the closed market . We are the open market . Obviously , Japan is the one that is managing trade , not the United States . . . . We will make_sure that any opening we can achieve benefits everyone , including Australia. &quot; He said Australia is such a close ally of the United States and that the two days of meetings between American and Australian government officials have been so harmonious that &quot; there has to be some change of pace. &quot;</TEXT>
