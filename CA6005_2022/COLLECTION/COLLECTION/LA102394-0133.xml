   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / LAST WRITES : THEY EVEN INCLUDE AN AUTOGRAPH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Where there ' s a will . . . there ' s a Ted James way . Last will , that is . As in &quot; . . . and testament. &quot; James is the head researcher and spokesman for Celebrity Collectibles , a Phoenix outfit that specializes in reproducing celebrity wills and related documents . If you ' re still looking_for that perfect $ 10- $ 20 Halloween gift for your favorite Hollywood gravedigger , the company offers a catalogue of more_than 200 packages . The selections range from such old Hollywood legends as Darryl F . Zanuck and W.C. Fields to such cultural icons as Rock Hudson ( including a copy of his death certificate which identifies AIDS as a cause of death ) to rock gods Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison . A few of particular note : * A Marilyn Monroe package features not just a copy of her will , but claims on her estate , including ones from her psychiatrist , her hairdresser and even Western Union for telegrams allegedly sent to the Kennedys . * Sharon Tate left no will , but a set of papers dealing with her includes a successful claim from the owner of the Benedict Canyon home for damages done that awful 1969 night when the Manson clan_members committed the murders . * The newest addition to the catalogue is Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis ' lengthy , complex will , signed shortly before her death last spring , in which she bequeathed a Greek alabaster bust to her longtime companion Maurice Tempelsman -- and nothing to her sister , Lee Radziwill ( though she indicated that she made provisions for Radziwill while still alive ) . It ' s great stuff for celebrity junkies and business is booming , according to James . In fact , he says , the calls from star-devotees got so out of control that the company had its phone_number unlisted and now takes orders only by mail ( 2302 N . 44th St. , Suite 4-175 , Phoenix , AZ 85008 ) . But , frankly , isn ' t this whole business a little sick ? &quot; We ' re just supplying the curious something they want to see , people who are true fans , &quot; James says . James got the idea of dealing in celebrity wills five years ago after reading of a woman selling copies of Elvis Presley ' s will . &quot; She merely folded_up the copy in an envelope and sent it out , &quot; James says of the Elvis will . &quot; I thought , ' If this is available , what else might be ? ' and took it from there. &quot; And yes , it ' s perfectly legal . &quot; It ' s public_domain , &quot; James says . &quot; These documents are public record . We do a substantial amount of legal research to stay out of trouble , and we have disclaimers that this is not sanctioned by anyone ' s estates or the government. &quot; The truth is , anyone could go make his or her own copies . &quot; If you know where to look and have enough time and money , sure , &quot; James says . &quot; In New York , for example , if you wanted to get something by mail , you have to pay a research fee , and then it ' s five bucks a page for a copy . The Jackie O . document might run you $ 200. &quot; Almost as interesting as the estate documents they have are some of the ones they don ' t -- or can ' t -- get ahold of . &quot; We ' re looking_for Buddy Holly ' s , but can ' t find it , &quot; James says . &quot; We thought we ' d find it in Texas where he was born , but now we ' re looking in New York where he resided at the time of his death. &quot; In other cases they know where the wills are , or at least where they should be , but they ' ve still eluded the company ' s research_staff . &quot; One I ' ve been_after for years is Rudolph Valentino ' s , &quot; he says . &quot; I know it ' s there in L.A. , I badger the people in the documents department to death , but they just can ' t find it . And we went looking_for Babe_Ruth ' s last year , but the whole_thing has disappeared. &quot; James also says , &quot; We get an amazing amount of requests for Hedy Lamarr ' s will , and we have a little note we send_back that says , ' I ' m sorry . Hedy Lamarr is not dead. ' &quot;</TEXT>
