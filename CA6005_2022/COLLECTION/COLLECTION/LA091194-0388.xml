   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; DEATH_PENALTY MOVE ALTERS SIMPSON CASE DRAMATICALLY ; COURTS : JURY SELECTION MAY NOW FAVOR DEFENSE SIDE , EXPERTS SAY . GARCETTI COULD FACE SOME POLITICAL FALLOUT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The decision by the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office not to seek the death_penalty against O.J. Simpson shifts the dimensions of the closely watched_case , exposes the county ' s chief prosecutor to potential political fallout and dramatically alters many aspects of the upcoming trial , most notably the jury selection process . In interviews Saturday , legal analysts and others said the decision may subtly affect future death_penalty cases and may , at least in the short run , bring new attention to the issue of capital_punishment by linking it to such a well-known celebrity . Its greatest impact , however , will be_on the Simpson trial , where experts say it will shape the panel of prospective jurors , shorten jury selection and possibly leave prosecutors with a pool of potential jurors less inclined to convict Simpson . At the same time , the move represents the first ratcheting_down of the intensity in the Simpson case , which has galvanized national attention since the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were found June 13 . Simpson has pleaded not_guilty to those murders . &quot; This takes a bit of the cliffhanging drama out of it , &quot; said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe , senior associate at the Center for Politics and Economics of the Claremont Graduate_School . &quot; It ' s still a fascinating murder mystery , but some of the soap_opera is gone from it when it ' s not a struggle for life and death. &quot; Moreover , the decision announced Friday probably means that the Simpson trial -- which has sparked public discussion about hot-button issues such_as domestic abuse , racism and police conduct -- will not become a vehicle for prolonged debate about yet another contentious topic , the death_penalty . &quot; Had the prosecution sought the death_penalty here , it would have been an occasion to talk_about capital_punishment in society , about its imposition in a racist manner and about the other issues it raises , &quot; said Erwin Chemerinsky , a USC law professor . &quot; we ' ll hear some discussion about this over the next several days , but it won ' t go_on for months , as it would have if the prosecution had sought the death penalty. &quot; In the short run , opponents of capital_punishment say , the Simpson case may call new attention to their efforts , which have met with little support from the public . &quot; Simpson ' s case has educated people about the importance of having adequate legal_representation as well as having access to independent experts , and that is what is missing in so many capital cases , &quot; said Stephen B . Bright , director of the Southern Center for Human_Rights in Atlanta . Bright cited the case of Gary Nelson , sentenced to death in Georgia in 1978 for raping and murdering a 6-year-old girl . In contrast to the high-powered team of attorneys backing Simpson , Nelson ' s lawyer had never tried a death_penalty case before , was paid about $ 20 an hour and gave a closing argument that was a minuscule 255 words . Nelson spent 11 years on Death Row before his conviction was overturned . In the months since Simpson ' s arrest , Bright said , new attention has focused_on the death_penalty and its application . But he and others worried that interest may wane now that the issue is disappearing from the Simpson trial . For Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti , the issue is not likely to go_away so quickly . Few topics in criminal justice are as charged as capital_punishment , and some political analysts say that if Garcetti runs_for reelection , he will have to fight_off accusations that he yielded to pressure in the Simpson case . Already , some critics have accused his office of playing politics by not seeking the death_penalty against Simpson while pursuing it against Erik and Lyle Menendez , who are charged with first-degree murder in the shotgun killings of their parents . Others attacked the district_attorney for failing to seek the penalty in a case in which domestic abuse is alleged . And still others criticized him for their perception that prosecutors relied_on a focus group that met last month in Phoenix to help decide whether to try to seek Simpson ' s execution . &quot; The voters elected Garcetti to make these decisions himself , not to go_to a focus group , &quot; said author John Gregory Dunne , who described himself as &quot; truly appalled &quot; by that move . &quot; What I find most appalling is that he went_to Phoenix to a focus group , and the focus group_discussions indicated that a death sentence would never fly , &quot; said Dunne , who has written_about the Simpson case for an upcoming issue of the New York Review of Books . &quot; Eisenhower didn ' t use a focus group in 1944 to decide whether to attack in Normandy. &quot; Garcetti could face backlash from women ' s groups as well . Gloria Allred , a prominent Los Angeles lawyer and president of the Women ' s Equal Rights Legal Defense and Education Fund , called a news_conference Saturday to issue a furious denunciation of the move . &quot; The D.A. ' s decision in my opinion reflects a callous and conscious disregard for the value that should be placed on the life of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman , &quot; Allred said . &quot; It is apparently not enough that they were killed in a bloody and brutal slaying but now to make matters worse , they have , in my opinion , become human sacrifices on the altar of racial politics for the basest and crassest of reasons , to try to shore_up the career of Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti. &quot; Allred , who had urged Garcetti ' s office to seek the death_penalty , said that the failure to do so would endanger other women . &quot; The D.A. has in_effect declared open season on women and issued a hunting_license to men to prey upon their wives , ex-wives and lovers and terrorize them , brutalize them and even murder them and their friends without fear of the death_penalty , &quot; said Allred , who called_on Garcetti to resign . &quot; To obtain this hunting_license the applicant need only be male , a multimillionaire and a celebrity , preferably an athlete , with good political connections to a D.A. who can be placed in fear of what they will do if he does not appease them. &quot; Garcetti ' s office announced its decision late Friday and said prosecutors would not comment on it further . A spokeswoman for the office said Saturday that prosecutors would have no response to Allred ' s criticisms . Although Garcetti and his office will bear the consequences of the decision not to seek Simpson ' s execution , most legal observers backed the move , saying the Simpson case did not meet the district_attorney ' s criteria for capital_punishment . In fact , had the decision been announced soon after Simpson was charged , most observers said , prosecutors probably would have faced little criticism . &quot; I really have gained a new respect for Mr. Garcetti and the people on the committee &quot; that deliberated the issue , said Gigi Gordon , a Los Angeles criminal lawyer . &quot; This was a losing proposition either way . They made a legal decision as opposed to a political decision . I thought they would take the cynical approach because I thought there was a greater lobby for the death_penalty than against it. &quot; Garcetti ' s office made the right call &quot; from what I know about this case , &quot; said Los Angeles attorney Curt Livesay , who for several years under Dist . Atty . Ira Reiner was the sole person to decide whether the district_attorney ' s office would seek the death_penalty in homicide cases . Livesay said his opinion is based on his assumption that Simpson is guilty and that &quot; heat of passion &quot; was involved in the crime -- a mitigating factor . &quot; The death_penalty is seldom sought in domestic cases because of ' heat of passion , ' &quot; he said . Although he declined comment Friday , Deputy Dist . Atty . Frank E . Sundstedt , who chairs the district_attorney ' s special death_penalty committee , said in a July interview that &quot; it is very difficult to get a first-degree murder_conviction in any domestic violence case. &quot; Even many observers who supported the decision criticized the district_attorney ' s office for not acting more quickly . Prosecutors originally had said they would have a final_decision no later than Aug . 31 . Simpson ' s attorneys complained that the delay hampered their efforts to prepare_for trial , and their concerns were echoed by the judge and other legal_experts . &quot; They should have made the decision sooner , but as Justice Felix Frankfurter said : ' One ought not to reject wisdom because it comes late , ' &quot; Livesay said . &quot; It ' s too_bad the district_attorney has put himself in the position of having it appear that public influence was exerted , &quot; he added , referring to Garcetti ' s July meeting with leaders of the African American community who urged him not to seek the death_penalty . By failing to disclose the reasons for their decision , prosecutors raised questions about what distinguished this case from others in which they ask_for executions . The Los Angeles district_attorney ' s office uses 12 criteria to assess whether to seek the death_penalty , but prosecutors did not reveal which of those were applied in the Simpson case . In a letter to Simpson ' s attorneys , Sundstedt said the decision was made after &quot; consideration of all aggravating and mitigating penalty phase evidence , &quot; but he did not amplify . A member of the committee said Simpson ' s lack of a felony history was an important factor_in the decision . Simpson was arrested as a teen-ager and later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor in a spousal battery case , but he does not have an adult felony record . &quot; There may be a good sound reason for declination of the death_penalty , but this is the wrong way to announce the decision , &quot; said Bruce Fein , a former associate deputy attorney_general under President Ronald Reagan who is now in private practice in Washington , D.C. &quot; Our system rests_on the confidence of evenhandedness , that the poor don ' t take the brunt of punishment from the criminal_law system . that ' s why this decision coming_out unexplained like immaculate_conception is the last thing we want in the law . It needs to be explained , not to rest_on miracles. &quot; Standing unexplained , Fein said , the decision is subject_to a host of interpretations . &quot; There is nothing in the record , &quot; he said , &quot; that would discredit the theory ( that ) you don ' t get the death_penalty if you ' re wealthy , if you have resources to fight_off prosecutors with armies of attorneys , investigators , blood specialists. &quot; Fein said Garcetti ' s action makes_it clear that prosecutors &quot; wield an enormous amount of unfettered discretion in how our criminal justice laws are administered &quot; and that there is a need for clearer criteria on how such decisions are made . Leslie Abramson , the lawyer for Erik Menendez , echoed that criticism , saying California courts have given prosecutors such wide latitude on whether to seek capital_punishment that it may_not be worth it to file a motion demanding that the district_attorney drop its quest_for the death of her client . &quot; If we had such a hearing , I don ' t think we would prevail , &quot; she conceded , while continuing to assail Garcetti for seeking the death_penalty in the Menendez case . Although the district_attorney may be grappling with the fallout from the Simpson decision for months or even years , the most immediate impacts are_on the coming trial . Experts say they are likely to be profound . Although many legal analysts said they believed prosecutors partly decided against seeking the death_penalty for fear that it would endanger their chances of getting a conviction , they also noted that the decision could have the opposite effect . Prospective jurors who cannot support the death_penalty are automatically excused from cases in which capital_punishment is being sought . But Friday ' s decision means those people may now sit on the Simpson jury . Because they tend to be more liberal , capital_punishment opponents generally are considered more likely to vote to acquit criminal defendants , and thus the decision not to seek the death_penalty may work against prosecutors ' main objective : to have Simpson found guilty of the brutal double homicide . Like several others , Charles J . Ogletree Jr . of Harvard Law_School said the decision &quot; has shifted the advantage to the defense in selecting the jury . There are many jurors , and particularly jurors of color_in California , who are opposed to the death_penalty and who would have been disqualified from serving . This ensures a more diverse pool of potential jurors and increases the likelihood of a hung jury or an acquittal. &quot; Laurie Levenson , a Loyola law professor and former federal prosecutor , agreed that the makeup of the Simpson panel could be affected by the decision not to pursue the death_penalty , but added that the strategy questions were complicated by other possible advantages for prosecutors in dropping their quest_for capital_punishment . &quot; Any juror pauses before voting to convict in a case where the death_penalty might be imposed , &quot; she said . &quot; They should not be imposing a higher standard because of the possible punishment , but I think they do. &quot; In fact , some observers said the decision , though it may cost prosecutors some tactical points and gain them others , was in many ways a bow to the inevitable . &quot; What the D.A. ' s office has admitted by making this decision is that the horror of the offense is never going_to outweigh the humanity of the alleged offender , &quot; Gordon said . &quot; You can ' t dehumanize a guy who ' s been sitting in your living room for 27 years . No jury would execute this man . He will never be a thing . He will always be O.J. Simpson. &quot;</TEXT>
