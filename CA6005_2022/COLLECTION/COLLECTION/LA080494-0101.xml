   <TEXT> Steve Richardson recalls feeling more puzzled than excited when he opened his missions service letter from Salt_Lake_City . The 20-year-old Texan had no qualms about his assignment -- telling Chinese people in the San Gabriel Valley about the Mormon gospel . What perplexed him was the language he had to speak : Mandarin . &quot; I didn ' t even know what Mandarin was , &quot; Richardson said . &quot; I knew what Chinese was but I didn ' t know the dialects . The whole_thing was pretty new ( to me ) . &quot; Fourteen months into his two-year mission , the boy who grew_up learning Spanish in Alvin , Tex. , now speaks , reads and studies Mandarin daily in his Alhambra apartment . He and his partner , David Wells , 20 , of Utah , know enough of the language to share their beliefs about Jesus_Christ and the_Book_of_Mormon with much of the Chinese American community . Dressed in the standard Mormon missionary outfit -- white short-sleeve shirt and plain-print tie -- the two spend six days each week roaming through Alhambra and Monterey Park , looking_for Chinese homes to visit and hoping to win some souls for the church . &quot; After a while , you just figure_out which doors are Chinese or not , &quot; Richardson said . &quot; You look_for shoes , Chinese signs_on the door , characters. &quot; The Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter-day_Saints -- a once-homogenous entity best known outside its ranks for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir , Brigham Young University and the Osmond family -- is expanding and diversifying at a rapid pace in Southern California and around the globe . Mormon_church membership grew by 22 % in the United States between 1982 and 1991 , while some mainstream Protestant_denominations reported declines of up_to 40 % , according to the National Council of Churches . Mormon_church membership worldwide has climbed from 5 million in 1982 to 9 million currently , according to church figures . And for the first time in the church ' s 164-year history , half of the world ' s Mormons now live outside the United States , officials say . In Southern California , the trends have been mixed . The church has seen some of its white membership age and retire to other regions of the country . But in the San Gabriel Valley and other areas , the church has reached_out to replace its departing white members with Latinos , Chinese , Koreans and others . Such demographic changes are in striking contrast to a common perception that the Mormon_church is a predominantly white church that has sought to stay that way . After all , the church denied its priesthood to blacks for more_than a century until a &quot; divine revelation &quot; in 1978 ended such discrimination and opened the door to &quot; every faithful , worthy man in the church. &quot; The San Gabriel Valley has about 26 # 000 members among its seven Mormon &quot; stakes , &quot; which are based in Pasadena , Arcadia , Glendora , La Verne , Covina , Hacienda Heights and Walnut . Stakes are regional units made_up of congregations called wards , which typically have 400 to 600 members , and branches , which range from a dozen members to several hundred . * Although whites still make_up a majority of Mormon membership in the valley at 78 % , the proportion of Spanish-speaking followers has climbed to 20 % and speakers of Asian languages to 2 % , said Brad Foster , president of the Arcadia Mission , and Reid Gunnell , Foster ' s assistant . A more significant figure that Foster and Gunnell turn_to is the ratio of converts . Just two years ago , 70 % of new converts in the valley were white , 25 % Latino and 5 % Asian , Foster said . Now whites make_up half of those converted , 35 % or 40 % are Latino and the rest are Asian , Foster said . And among Asian Mormons , those of Chinese origin lead the flock . There were no Chinese-language services in the valley 13 years ago . But in the summer of 1981 , church leaders commissioned Chinese American members to form the first branch in Rosemead , where services and programs are held_in Mandarin . Two others have since sprung_up in Hacienda Heights and Arcadia ; Koreans also have a branch in Hacienda Heights . Vietnamese Mormons join the Chinese in Rosemead for Sunday services . * &quot; At that time , they saw a need , &quot; recalled Charles Chen , who served as president of the Chinese branch in Rosemead when it first opened . &quot; Regardless of how many members . . . they just told me to go_ahead and organize one . After the second meeting , we had 20-some people . &quot; We have grown quite a lot . Every time we have 100 members , we split out_to a different branch. &quot; Gunnell also sees potential growth among the Chinese . &quot; The Chinese people , a lot of them are interested in our message , &quot; Gunnell said . &quot; They come from a very different background , from the standpoint of religion. &quot; To keep_up with growth , the church has poured millions of dollars into its Southern California facilities , erecting a new chapel in Duarte and renovating other buildings in the valley . Built_in 1990 , the 15 # 600-square-foot Duarte chapel at 1452 Royal Oaks Drive features a connecting hall for sports activities , banquets and dances . It also accommodates services for 200 Spanish-speaking and 400 English-speaking members , said Mel Reeves , president of the Arcadia stake . The San Gabriel Valley ' s Chinese branches , which range from 40 to 170 members , share facilities with English-speaking branches , though they eventually would like to acquire a building . &quot; We have talked_about it many years , &quot; Chen said . &quot; The qualifications to have your own building are tougher &quot; than in Taiwan or other Asian_countries . The local changes are only part of an increasingly diverse Mormon_church . Almost from its inception , the church began sending missionaries to Europe and Mexico . Since then , the church has ventured into 149 countries , &quot; every country that allows it to come_in , &quot; said J . Gordon Melton , director of the Santa Barbara-based Institute for the Study of American Religion . He added : &quot; Today , Mormons would be among the five most ethnically and culturally diverse churches going. &quot; The Book_of_Mormon , the pillar of the church ' s faith , tells the story of immigrants from the Middle_East who founded elaborate civilizations in the Americas . Visited by Jesus after the Resurrection , they prospered for centuries , only to disappear after falling victim to evil ways and fighting among themselves . Their story , inscribed on golden tablets , was said to have been found by Joseph_Smith in New York in 1823 , guided by a vision of an angel named Moroni . It is an image of Moroni , covered in gold_leaf , that can be seen holding a trumpet atop the church ' s temples around the world . Smith established for the church a strict code_of_conduct that has been modified over the years but continues to place a large_number of demands on its members . Mormons are expected to donate a tenth of their income to the church , wear special undergarments decorated with markings that symbolize a covenant with God , and follow dietary rules known as the Word of Wisdom , which bans alcohol , coffee , tea and tobacco , and urges that meat be consumed &quot; sparingly. &quot; Families gather one night each week for a &quot; home evening &quot; devoted to prayer , study and activities from board_games to night skiing . The church teaches that it is important for families to get_along because they will spend eternity together in heaven . Devout Mormons pray , study and socialize every Sunday at chapels , or meeting_houses , scattered across Southern California . Classes , worship and meetings can fill_up to 10 hours a week . Asian American converts in the valley say they were drawn to the church ' s commitment to traditional family values and stringent moral guidelines . &quot; A lot of love at_home . The parents and the kids seem to be very harmonious -- and that ' s very important , &quot; said Jiin-Jen Lee , reflecting on what drew him to the Mormon faith 30 years ago . Lee , a civil_engineering professor at USC , was a student at Utah State University in 1964 when Mormon missionaries introduced him to the religion . His parents practiced ancestral worship -- a popular Asian religion -- but Mormonism offered answers to Lee ' s questions about life and family . A more recent convert , Carry Tan of Duarte , had been a Buddhist for 40 years . But when her husband died of cancer 3 1 / 2 years ago , she could not find solace in Buddhism . Rather , solace came knocking_on her door in the form of two Bible-carrying missionaries . &quot; The Buddhists always tell you you ' re poor because you ' re no good , &quot; said Tan , a part-time housekeeper and the mother of three . &quot; Who will judge you for being good or bad ? You ' ll never get the answer . &quot; But in our church , they are very clear . Jesus will judge you , &quot; she said . &quot; If you have a poor life , you can learn Mormonism . If you do your best , eventually your life will be better. &quot; Perhaps the most effective conversion mechanism is the church ' s missionary operation . Mormon children are groomed for missionary_work early on . By the time they are 19 , the age at which they are eligible to serve , few Mormon men consider doing anything else . They send letters to Salt_Lake_City stating their willingness to serve and wait for marching orders . Women are eligible at 21 and now constitute 22 % of the missionary roster , church officials say . If a foreign language is required , missionaries are trained at the Missionary Training Center in Provo , Utah , which offers courses in 44 languages and trains about 3 # 300 missionaries each month . Like virtually all their missionary counterparts , the Alhambra-based Richardson and Wells team receives no financial_support from the church during their assignments . Instead , they and their parents set_aside $ 8 # 400 to cover missionary expenses for two years , which include room and board . While serving their missions , Richardson and Wells are expected to abide_by rules of conduct that make everyday Mormon standards seem relaxed : no dating , no television , no radio , no movies , no family visits and no more_than three phone_calls home per year -- on Mother ' s Day , Father ' s Day and Christmas . They rise at 6:30 a.m. , study religion for a_few hours and hit the sidewalk by 10:30 a.m. Aside from lunch or dinner breaks , they are not permitted to return to their apartment until 9:30 p.m. Richardson and Wells are two of 184 missionaries in the Arcadia mission , which stretches from Pomona to Glendale . Of those , six are assigned to bring_in Chinese converts , another six to Koreans , two to Vietnamese , 70 to Latinos and 100 to whites . One Latino convert was brought_up by her parents as a Catholic , became a Pentecostal Christian in 1992 and abandoned her Assembly of God church in Orange County after her divorce . &quot; I met the missionaries , &quot; said Dorothy Marie Bustamante Bandy , 30 , of Monrovia . &quot; They were visiting my sister , and they were very helpful to me. &quot; After tasting aspects of each religion , Bandy said she ' s confident that the Mormon faith stands_out above the others . &quot; There was no structure in the Pentecostal church , &quot; said Bandy , the mother of a 6-year-old boy . &quot; Anyone can walk in and serve in the church. &quot; &quot; In the Latter-day_Saints church , you need to be in_attendance and you pray about it -- there is a procedure. &quot; Church_members are helping Bandy find employment . &quot; The structure of the ( Mormon ) church is not to take and take , &quot; she said . &quot; They give and give. &quot; The reaction of other local religious_leaders to Mormonism ' s tenacious campaign ranges from grudging admiration to restrained irritation . The Mormon missionary activity is &quot; far more aggressive than anything we ' re doing , &quot; says Father Gregory Coiro , a spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles . &quot; I don ' t want to say being aggressive is bad . Maybe we should be saying we ' re not aggressive enough. &quot; The Catholic_church has begun strengthening its ties to the ethnic communities of Southern California , he said . The St . Thomas_Aquinas parish in Monterey Park , for example , was recently designated a Chinese-speaking evangelical center . The move was intended to offer a home parish to the region ' s Chinese population , though the decision angered a large segment of the parish ' s predominantly Latino membership . But Coiro said he does not believe the Catholic_church ' s Latino stronghold is being eroded by the Mormon_church . The Mormon_church is &quot; one of the many religions , sects and cults that are out there trying to attract people , &quot; he said . Nor has the church ' s efforts within the Asian community caused problems among Buddhist leaders in the San Gabriel Valley . &quot; We are not concerned about other religions , &quot; said the Rev . Man Tau of Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights . Since its opening in 1988 , the temple at 3456 S . Glenmark Drive has amassed 10 # 000 Chinese , Japanese and Korean members . Unlike the Mormon creed of spreading the Gospel , Buddhists refrain_from evangelizing the world and instead encourage individuals to seek their own paths to Buddhism . &quot; We don ' t go_out for family visits , &quot; Tau said . &quot; We are strictly forbidden to convert people to believe . This is not the right way. &quot; Times staff writers Mathis Chazanov and Diane Seo contributed to this story .</TEXT>
