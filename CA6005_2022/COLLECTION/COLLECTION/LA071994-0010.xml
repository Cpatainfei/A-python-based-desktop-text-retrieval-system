   <HEADLINE> THE NUMBERS TELL A STORY ; QUAKE STATISTICS ARE LIKE NOTHING ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The sheer magnitude of the Northridge quake ' s impact demands an extensive review of the now six-month-old recovery effort by federal , state and local officials . Simply put , there is nothing in the recent memory of the nation that compares with the January temblor . These are not the self-serving impressions of the hometown newspaper . The facts come from the Clinton_Administration , which said last month that the effect of the Northridge quake was bigger than the combined impacts of the Midwest floods , Hurricane Andrew , the Loma Prieta earthquake and South Carolina ' s Hurricane Hugo . Since then , the Northridge numbers have continued to grow -- and so the growing concern . It is typical after a major disaster , for example , for there to be a huge gap between the number of loan_applications issued and the usually far lower number actually filled_out and turned_in . But , again , it is the magnitude of the Northridge numbers that beg questions : 497 # 225 applications issued , 197 # 867 actually filed . In terms of businesses alone , there were 135 # 049 applications handed_out and just 43 # 657 filed . The gap is just too_large , and the number of employers and employees too great , to avoid an investigation of why so few were turned_in . Was the paperwork too daunting , the process too discouraging ? Were language_barriers a factor ? Answers to such questions are badly needed , well before the extended loan-application process ends . Next , we know that the Small Business Administration is examining the high number of loan_applications that were withdrawn ( 14 # 157 or about 12 times more_than for the Midwest floods or Hurricane Andrew ) . We know that the SBA is also re-examining about 17 # 000 loans that were previously denied . In that regard , we note that the loan denial rate for Northridge has been higher than previous natural disasters as well . Certain factors deserve consideration . It is arguable , for example , that California ' s deep recession was greater than anything faced by the Midwest before its floods , or by Florida before its hurricane . Did the downturn in the economy disqualify applicants who otherwise might have deserved aid ? Perhaps the loan standards could be relaxed commensurately , to acknowledge the unusual recent lows of the state economy . A plan pitched last week by U.S. Commerce_Secretary Ronald Brown would offer California businesses funds that could be leveraged into greater amounts . The proposal could help some businesses become better loan prospects . Sounds good , but it ' s a relatively small program . We also know that the SBA is attempting to give priority to the loans of businesses located in the ghost_towns that have evolved since the quake . that ' s good , but when one visits such areas , one realizes that many merchants are still in the dark concerning the larger workings of government . Northridge quake victims need a specific telephone_number -- just one , only one -- that they can call to obtain information . The only number now is mainly useful in directing people to one of the 10 quake-recovery service centers still open . that ' s not good_enough . The questions here are simply stated : Is there enough aid , and is enough being done to get_it to those who need it ? This must be closely examined in Washington , Sacramento and here at_home , and soon .</TEXT>
