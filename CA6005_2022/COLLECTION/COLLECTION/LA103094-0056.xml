   <HEADLINE> RECORD RACK : IN BRIEF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * * Brandy , &quot; Brandy , &quot; Atlantic . A teen-age newcomer with surprisingly mature chops , Brandy imbues the hit single &quot; I Wanna Be Down &quot; with self-assured authority.Elsewhere on this debut effort , she ' s saddled with drab , subpar songs that don ' t do her justice . Forget maturity -- Brandy ' s too young to be mired in this mellow a mode . New albums are rated on a scale of one star ( poor ) , two stars ( fair ) , three stars ( good ) and four stars ( excellent ) . Connie Johnson</TEXT>
