   <TEXT> All was not sweetness_and_light in the men ' s 40-kilometer cross-country ski relay , according to Norway ' s Vegard Ulvang , who said that Italy ' s Marco Albarello had broken one of the ski_poles used by Finland ' s Harri Kirvesniemi . &quot; Albarello came from behind and took the lead at the bottom of the second slope ( in the second leg of the race ) &quot; said Ulvang , who was skiing just behind the Italian and the Finn. &quot; Kirvesniemi didn ' t want to let Albarello go and happened to touch Albarello ' s ski . Albarello was so annoyed . . . that he turned and lashed_out with his pole , breaking Kirvesniemi ' s pole. &quot; A Finnish team coach calling splits to Kirvesniemi quickly handed him another pole , and the skier continued running with the leaders . * There hasn ' t been much made of the Norwegian-Swedish rivalry during the Games , the Swedes generally getting warm receptions from the predominantly Norwegian crowds . But Swedish radio reporter Mats Dahlberg couldn ' t resist taking a shot at the host country the other day when Sweden ' s Pernilla Wiberg won the women ' s combined gold medal in Alpine skiing . &quot; Here at Hafjell it ' s wonderful to be a Swede , especially since the best Norwegian could only manage 15th , &quot; Dahlberg gloated .
