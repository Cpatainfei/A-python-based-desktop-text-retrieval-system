   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / ROBERT SCHEER : DEATH_PENALTY : A FASHIONABLE IDEA FOR THE ' 90S ; HARD-LINERS ACT AS IF CRIME WOULD GO_DOWN IF EVERYONE ON DEATH ROW DIED TOMORROW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> She was a perfect Exhibit A for the law-and-order hard-liners -- young , white , vulnerable , appealing and constantly invoking the name of the Lord . Perfect , except that she now sits in a South Carolina jail accused of having killed her own tiny children . Perfect also was the man she accused , an unidentified black male carjacker between 20 and 30 years old . Catch him and kill him is the slogan of the moment , and the nation would have rested easier if a suspect , any black suspect , had met that fate . No matter the truth , a composite of this nonexistent suspect has already been burned into our consciousness by the mass media ; tried and convicted . This was the case in Boston five years ago when a white_man all but convinced police that his pregnant wife had been killed by a black male . In the end , the white fellow leaped to his death from a bridge as the police were about to arrest him for the murder . But the damage had already been done and the stereotype of black_and_white , good and evil perpetuated . How many black males , or others , now sit on Death Row falsely accused of murder because , in their cases , the truth didn ' t come_out ? We have fresh evidence that there may be quite a_few . Thanks to DNA testing , scores of people serving time for heinous crimes have had their convictions overturned . Once carried_out , the death sentence makes a reversal of such error irrelevant . That is one reason why Amnesty International and virtually every human-rights group in the world oppose capital_punishment . They are not being softhearted or indifferent to victims ' rights , but rather recognize the cold reality that the victim is sometimes the accused . Speak of forlorn causes . I don ' t even know why I bother to bring this up now except that Kathleen Brown ' s opposition to the death_penalty has been an issue in this campaign and she has failed miserably to justify it . Instead , she has insisted that hers is a personal position and that as governor she would execute with the best of them . She points_out , accurately enough , that her father as governor killed 36 people on Death Row while Republican governors in this state have only managed to do_in two prisoners in the past 12 years . Evidently being in principle against the death_penalty , as Pat Brown was , makes_it that much more likely that you will order the cyanide to be dropped . Gov . Pete Wilson defends his inactivity as an executioner by reference_to drawn-out court appeals and insists he has the will to kill if only he could gain the legal authority . I don ' t doubt that . What I do doubt is his motive in_using the death_penalty as a litmus test for being serious about fighting crime . Like his immigrant- and welfare-bashing , it is further evidence that he is quite willing to pollute the climate of our social discourse in the interests of advancing his own political fortunes . This is just flag-waving to arouse the mob . He now concedes that his Proposition 187 is unenforceable and will do nothing to stop illegal immigration , just as he previously had to admit that his welfare-reform schemes cost more_than they save . And he is certainly too intelligent to believe that the difference between a death_penalty and a mandatory life sentence goes_to the root causes of crime . What these litmus-test issues do is distract us from the serious tasks at_hand . They are a sideshow . Kill everyone on Death Row tomorrow and crime will still not go_down . Pass Proposition 187 and next week Wilson ' s friends in agribusiness will hire just as_many illegals to harvest the crop . Wipe_out welfare and a new army of homeless families will choke the main arteries of our cities . But the scare tactics and quick-fix solutions evidently have great electoral appeal . The danger is that other politicians will now rush to play these same cards . Remember candidate Bill_Clinton dashing back to Little_Rock to personally preside over the execution of a prisoner possessed of such limited mental_capacity that he thought something pleasant was up ? And our own Sen . Dianne Feinstein , whom only Michael Huffington could make appear principled , never misses an opportunity to talk up her ardent support for the death_penalty and barbed wire on the border . In the new Congress , there will be no shortage of Democrats pushing all_of the irrational but tough-sounding proposals that their opponents now use to torment them . Few leaders in either party will have the courage to seriously work the problems , lest they be called softhearted liberals or , even more dastardly , moderate Republicans . In the short run , the hard-liners will win ; but in the long_run we , the public , will suffer .</TEXT>
