   <HEADLINE> CANDIDATE TERRIFIED BY FIREBOMB ; CRIME : MOLOTOV_COCKTAIL DOES NOT EXPLODE , BUT FOLLOWS BY A WEEK SHOTS INTO HOME OF LA HABRA ACTIVIST DOROTHY RUSH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Molotov_cocktail crashed through the bedroom window of a La Habra City_Council candidate early Friday in an apparent attempt to set fire to her house in the Grace / Pacific neighborhood , police said . The firebomb did not explode but was still lit when authorities found it on Dorothy Rush ' s bed shortly after 2 a.m. Rush , 60 , was not in the room when the device -- a beer_bottle filled with gasoline and plugged with a cloth -- crashed through her window and landed on her bed . She and her husband , Larry , 62 , were uninjured . The incident is the second in as_many weeks in which unidentified attackers have struck Rush ' s house , La Habra Police_Officer Cindy Knapp said . The home was also the target of two separate attacks earlier this year . &quot; Someone ' s trying to kill me , &quot; said Rush , a retired dress maker who gained notoriety over the past several years because of her public fight to get_rid_of gangs and blight in parts of the neighborhood . Last week , police said someone sprayed her Grace Avenue home with gunfire , puncturing walls and knocking_out windows . &quot; I ' m scared and I don ' t know why this is happening . If they don ' t want me to run_for the council , they ' re defeating their purpose because they ' re just giving me publicity , &quot; said Rush , who has been prodding the city for years to enact strict parking and property maintenance laws . Knapp said detectives believe the two recent incidents are related but don ' t know if they involve gangs . No arrests have been made in either case , Lt . John Buchholz said . Police found 9-millimeter bullet slugs inside Rush ' s home after the Sept . 1 shooting , which occurred about 6:10 a.m. Neighbors said they saw a man fire at the home while riding in the bed of a faded red pickup_truck with a white camper shell , Buchholz said . That wasn ' t the first time Rush ' s home was targeted in a drive-by_shooting . Gunshots fired in February shattered a living room window . The attackers also scribbled the name of a neighborhood gang on the front of her house , Rush said . In April , cinder_blocks were hurled into Rush ' s bedroom and living room windows , one hitting her on the back as she slept , another grazing cat and a third shattering a dresser mirror . Since Rush began a Neighborhood Watch program , graffiti usually appears on her driveway after each monthly meeting of the group . She said she organized area residents in an effort to persuade police to step_up patrols in her area . Rush also founded the Grace / Pacific Community Assn . last year to get tenants to maintain their properties and get landlords to evict those who do not . Some of those neighbors have accused her of meddling and blamed her for their evictions . &quot; Because she ' s active in the community , she has , unfortunately , made some people unhappy , &quot; Knapp said . Knapp said police patrols have been stepped_up in Rush ' s Grace / Pacific neighborhood . Police urge anyone with information to telephone Detectives Mel Ruiz or Jose Quirarte at ( 310 ) 905-9683 or leave word on the department ' s anonymous tip line : ( 310 ) 905-9611 . &quot; Somebody wants me out of here , but I ' m not going anywhere , &quot; Rush said . &quot; For some reason , they really hate me and all I ' m doing is trying to clean_up the neighborhood . . . . It ' s no fun , but if ( her attackers ) really got a gripe , tell me what it is and maybe there ' s something we can work out. &quot;</TEXT>
