   <HEADLINE> GOOD RULING , BAD LAW ; COURT MAKES RIGHT CALL , BUT RICO IS A WORRISOME GRAB BAG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Supreme Court ' s unanimous decision Monday permitting use of a federal anti-racketeering law against anti-abortion protesters sends two strong and clear messages . The first : Militant groups such_as Operation Rescue that try to blockade clinics and harass women seeking abortions could be engaging in a conspiracy even though they are motivated by moral or political principle rather than financial gain.In light of the ruling , these protest groups should now finally acknowledge that their First_Amendment right to express their opposition to abortion does not extend_to physical intimidation or violence . The second : A congressional review of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act is very much in_order . The 1970 statute was originally directed against the conspiratorial activities of the so-called crime families . However , the law is so loosely worded that any two instances of illegal conduct within a 10-year period can , if they involve telephones or mail , be prosecuted as a pattern of racketeering activity . The RICO act has been invoked against Chicago commodity brokers , Los Angeles slumlords , Wall_Street financiers and Huntington Beach traffic_cops . Absurd . Not surprisingly , some RICO prosecutions under this vague and excessively broad statute have impinged_on the due-process rights of defendants . Critics charge they also have led to prison sentences and assessments of damages far beyond the bounds of fairness . Congress is moving to eliminate any doubt that might remain about the legality of violent anti-abortion protest . Both the House and the Senate have passed versions of the Freedom of Access to Clinics Act and soon will consider a conference version . Congress should now turn its attention to RICO .</TEXT>
