   <HEADLINE> BY DESIGN ; FAB DUO IS , WELL , FABULOUS ; BRITAIN ' S EDINA AND PATSY ARE THE FASHION WORLD ' S NEWEST SWEETIE DARLINGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cave_dwellers and the cable-challenged might have missed the premiere of &quot; Absolutely Fabulous &quot; on Comedy Central on Sunday , but the fashion watchers didn ' t . Their fingers were poised on the record buttons of their VCRs to tape the daylong British sitcom ' s orgy of sex , drugs , dysfunctional families and eye-jarring fashion statements . They were only too thrilled to vicariously roll in the gutter with Edina ( Jennifer Saunders ) -- the rebirthed , channeled , crystallized , &quot; I ' m-chanting-as-we-speak &quot; Buddhist publicist and her best_friend , Patsy ( Joanna Lumley ) , a magazine fashion director whose talents include procuring casual sex , cocaine and champagne . &quot; All the drugs and stuff reminded me of the way past , &quot; Los Angeles fashion_designer Gregory Poe says . &quot; There was a time when I actually was in a trance-like state . The show had that same sort of a trance-like quality . The head trips reminded me of the fashion world , the ones people don ' t want to admit -- stuff like ' reschedule my rebirth for next Thursday. ' &quot; &quot; The people who are talking_about it are the ones lampooned by the show , &quot; notes fashion writer and Newsday columnist Frank DeCaro . &quot; Not only are we the target audience but we ' re also the target. &quot; The &quot; Absolutely Fabulous &quot; gals smoke , they swear , they have serious substance-abuse problems . Edina is an unfit mother and Patsy is your mother ' s worst nightmare . Her anti-grav tower of blond hair , Chanel suits and garishly lipsticked leer have elevated her to the style pantheon : She is the latest specialty among drag queens . And even though the pair ' s bad influence wasn ' t felt in this country until this week , they already had loyalists . &quot; It ' s taken_over my life , &quot; DeCaro admits . No kidding . He has all 12 shows on tape , a book that includes scripts and photographs , the &quot; Absolutely Fabulous Sweetie Darling &quot; T-shirt , the Pet_Shop Boys ' single &quot; Absolutely Fabulous &quot; -- which contains lines from the show -- and photographs of himself with Lumley and Saunders taken at a recent New York taping . Was he circumspect when he met the divine duo ? &quot; Of course . I ' m not a complete geek , &quot; he says . Cynthia Hall , a Dallas stylist turned independent film_producer , was desperate to see the show , even though her cable_system deemed it too racy . &quot; Two drunken women doing drugs ? It ' s right up my alley . &quot; It reminded me of the first time I saw ' All in the Family ' -- I was spellbound but sort of embarrassed . I kept looking_around the room to see who was laughing . It ' s kind of like giggling in church . You know you shouldn ' t , but the harder you try to stifle , the worse it gets , &quot; she says . References_to the show are turning_up in fashionable places . DeCaro reports overhearing them this week in New York at the menswear shows . &quot; Everyone is calling everyone else ' sweetie darling. ' I ' ve heard ' Lacroix sweetie , Lacroix , ' and ' I ' m chanting as we speak. ' &quot; &quot; AbFab , &quot; as it ' s called by fans , appeals_to the true fashion insider . &quot; ' Models Inc. ' hasn ' t got a clue about fashion , &quot; DeCaro says . &quot; With ' AbFab , ' accuracy is its best feature. &quot; Janet Orsi , a Los Angeles publicist , definitely recognized Edina as a member of the flack sisterhood . &quot; Oh , Edina , she ' s one of us . I loved the part where she ' s given a present and she says , ' Is it Lacroix , I love it -- if it ' s Lacroix . Is it Lacroix , sweetie ? ' That is right on the money . Only in the fashion world will you hear people say , ' Love your jacket , whose is it ? ' Any sane person would say , ' It ' s mine. ' In the fashion world , you have to give its lineage. &quot; Which brings us to the clothes , sweetie darling . &quot; I thought design-wise , they had it spot on , &quot; says British expatriate David Stamper , public relations director of the California Mart . &quot; Edina was amazing , she was so badly dressed , &quot; gasps Tim Flannery , art_director for a large national specialty_store . &quot; Oh , my God , that fake fur_coat with Versace bell-bottoms and a brocade Lacroix vest. &quot; Edina ' s ghastly , one-size-too-small , multilayered , designer-labeled get-ups impede her ability to walk a sidewalk , drive a car and sit in a chair . They also are a constant source of comment both on the show and in the audience . &quot; What ' s that you ' re wearing ? &quot; Patsy sniffs . &quot; Lacroix. &quot; &quot; Oh , Lacroix -- it ' s fabulous. &quot;</TEXT>
