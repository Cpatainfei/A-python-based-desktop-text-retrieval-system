   <HEADLINE> IT SEEMS AT &amp; T HAS COME UP WITH RIGHT NUMBER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Not everyone is having trouble doing business in China . AT &amp; T ' s USA Direct service is one way the company found to avoid problems that trip_up other foreign ventures . Here ' s how it works : Suppose Xiao Wang wants to call his cousin in Los Angeles but , like most people in China , doesn ' t have a phone or the means to pay_for an expensive long-distance_call . Now he can go_to the neighborhood phone_booth and dial 10810 for access to a Chinese-speaking AT &amp; T operator . Cousin Wang in America pays_for the call , which would otherwise cost Xiao Wang about three days ' wages for three minutes . AT &amp; T receives payment in the United States for the service , sidestepping two bugbears of business in China -- getting paid in foreign_exchange and repatriating profits . It took several years to set_up USA Direct in China , much longer than in other countries , said AT &amp; T regional managing director Darryl Green . But the service is bringing_in immediate profits . The toughest part of negotiations was to convince the government-owned telephone_company that AT &amp; T would n ' t usurp profitable long-distance traffic but would , instead , boost phone use and bring_in more foreign_exchange . &quot; For every person who calls_out of China now , 10 people call_in , &quot; Green said . The result is a positive cycle : AT &amp; T settles the difference with China in foreign_exchange , which the government often uses to pay_for telecommunications_equipment from AT &amp; T . China plans to install 12 million to 15 million new telephone_lines annually , the equivalent of a U.S. Baby Bell a year , and packages like this give AT &amp; T a competitive edge . &quot; It ' s almost like self-financing , &quot; Green said . &quot; Everybody wins. &quot; Marketing USA Direct brought a whole different set of challenges . People dislike having others pay_for them , Green said , so using a Mandarin-speaking operator as an intermediary helps overcome that resistance . AT &amp; T ads in the United States encourage people to send special calling_cards to friends and relatives in China to make_it even easier to pick_up the phone . In China , AT &amp; T passed_out 25 million bicycle fender stickers to advertise 10810 ; at the launch in Shanghai , it gave_away free three-minute phone_calls for the first 200 people to arrive . &quot; Thousands of people showed_up , &quot; Green said . But the first_person in_line was a 93-year-old scientist who once worked_at Bell Labs in Princeton , N.J. He had camped_out all night so he could call his brother in America . &quot; He made the inaugural call , &quot; Green said . &quot; It seemed appropriate. &quot;</TEXT>
