   <HEADLINE> POPE BREAKS LEG , WILL BE IN HOSPITAL SEVERAL WEEKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a commonplace bathroom fall , but it means a long convalescence for the century ' s most physically active Pope : John Paul II is recovering nicely from surgery to repair a broken leg and will be hospitalized for several weeks , the Vatican said Friday . Worse , for the dynamic , journeying John Paul , recovery will require long therapy , and it will be months before he can resume his normal , active daily life . Meantime , papal trips are canceled and stand-ins will take the Pope ' s role at Vatican ceremonies . John Paul , who will be 74 next month , has now broken bones in falls twice in less than six months . But the Vatican sought Friday to defuse concern about his general health . &quot; It was a banal accident , unfortunately very common when one has wet feet and is getting_out of the shower , &quot; papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro told reporters . He said the fall was the result of a slip , not dizziness or any loss_of_consciousness . The Pope was &quot; his normal , calm self &quot; after the two-hour operation to replace the broken thighbone with a metal prosthesis , Navarro said . Emilio Tresalti , director of the Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital and a member of the surgical team , described the Pope as &quot; a very strong man &quot; in &quot; excellent health. &quot; &quot; It went very well -- a surgeon always knows , &quot; said surgeon Gianfranco Fineschi , who inserted the prosthesis . After regaining consciousness , the pontiff was wheeled to a top-floor hospital suite he knows better than he would like . &quot; I am a music_lover , and my advice to the Pope now is : ' Andante , ma non troppo ' ( moderately , but not too ) , &quot; Fineschi said . Surgeons said they replaced the ball and neck of the inverted L-shaped femur bone in the Pope ' s right leg . All postoperative vital signs were normal , Navarro said . Tresalti observed : &quot; Fifteen years ago my mother , who ' s now 73 , had the same fracture and was operated_on by the same surgeons . She ' s very well . These are breaks which can be easily mended ; it ' s the classic bathroom slip. &quot; Friday ' s arrival by ambulance marked the Pope ' s sixth admission to the big Catholic teaching hospital on the northern edge of Rome . &quot; You have to admire my loyalty , &quot; John Paul said in wry self-disgust as he entered the institution where , as of Friday , he had spent 106 days of his 15-year pontificate . In Italy , hospital stays tend to be much longer than in the United States , and doctors say John Paul will remain there two to three weeks . He will then need months of therapy back home at the Vatican . Swimming , a papal favorite , will help . But skiing is out for good . So , at least for this year , is the annual week of Alpine hiking that the pontiff treasures . John Paul fell as he left the shower in his apartment at the Vatican about 11 p.m. Thursday , Navarro said . In pain , he summoned an aide who called Renato Buzzonetti , John Paul ' s personal physician . X-rays in a small but well-equipped dispensary in the Apostolic Palace confirmed a break close to where the femur turns toward the hip . A &quot; complete trans-cervical sub-capital fracture of the right femur with a dislocation , &quot; doctors would declaim in a statement later . The Pope was told that surgery would be necessary but that there was no particular urgency about getting him to the hospital . While John Paul went_to_bed with the aid of painkillers , which Navarro called &quot; generic analgesics , &quot; Buzzonetti marshaled surgeons in a round of midnight calls . Friday morning , after about four hours of fitful sleep , John Paul concelebrated Mass with his two personal secretaries , a Pole and a Vietnamese , Navarro said . On the 20-minute ambulance ride to the hospital he recited the rosary , by Navarro ' s account . He did not arrive in a good mood . &quot; I am in pain , and I am sorrowful , &quot; he said , referring to enforced cancellation of a scheduled weekend visit to Sicily . As his patient was being prepped for the operation , Tresalti noted : &quot; His humor is that of someone who should have left town today and has a load of appointments which have to be canceled. &quot; Before the fall , John Paul was preparing to leave Friday afternoon for the Sicilian city of Catania . Vatican sources said he intended to fire new salvos there today in his war against the Mafia . A May visit to Belgium is also being canceled , Navarro said . The Pope will also miss a Mass he was to have celebrated closing a monthlong synod of African bishops . And neither will he likely be able to participate at a consistory of cardinals he has summoned May 9-10 to discuss their church ' s millennial observances . It is still too early to know whether John Paul will be able to keep a scheduled meeting with a visiting President Clinton in early June . John Paul ' s love of exercise , honed as a priest and bishop on weekly mountain hikes in his native Poland , has survived his illnesses . Twice since breaking his arm in a fall last November , John Paul has gone skiing . The first time the Vatican didn ' t announce it because it was against doctor ' s orders . On the second trip , the Pope ' s Polish secretary broke his collarbone . Repeated setbacks have stalked John Paul in recent months since the November fall , when he tripped on the hem of his cassock in the Vatican . He remained overnight in the hospital for treatment of a fractured shoulder_bone and a dislocated right shoulder . Since then , history ' s most traveled Pope has had to scrap a planned June trip to Lebanon for security reasons and abandon hopes of visiting the Holy_Land this year . Last Wednesday , at his last public appearance , John Paul addressed pilgrims at a general audience on the dignity of suffering . Preaching from the Beatitudes , he said : &quot; Earthly suffering , when it is surrounded with love , is like a bitter shell which encloses the seed of new life , the treasure of divine glory which will be conceded to man in eternity. &quot; Never in modern times had a modern Pope gone_to a hospital outside the Vatican before John Paul was shot in St . Peter ' s Square on May 13 , 1981 . He spent six hours on a Gemelli operating table that time and was readmitted later that summer for treatment of a virus acquired from a blood_transfusion . In July , 1992 , the Pope was operated_on for removal of a benign intestinal tumor . A postoperative checkup there last year showed him to be in robust health .</TEXT>
