   <HEADLINE> SINGER AND STORYTELLER HAS TALENT WORTHY OF A FAMOUS NAME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Robin Williamson dropped the last two letters from his surname and stuck the remainder on a marquee , it would be mischievous and wrong , but it would n ' t be totally fraudulent . The swarms of &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; fans who turned_out to see a wonderful comedic talent would get exactly what they paid_for , and more . The Scottish folk_singer and storyteller can claim seniority over his near namesake , having been a part of the international music scene since his debut with the Incredible String Band in 1966 . Sixties-vintage ISB was the epitome of mystical , flower-power hippiedom , but its best music from that era remains charming and fresh . That is_due in large part to Williamson ' s adventurous pursuit of multiple styles played_on even greater multiples of instruments ( he is said to play more_than 30 different ones ) , to the utterly idiosyncratic nature of his wobbly , fluttery vocal style , and to a sense of tradition and idealism strong enough to withstand the passage of time . For the past decade or so , Williamson , 50 , has reached even deeper into Celtic traditions , culling ancient harp tunes from dusty musical archives and resurrecting folk tales and myths as old as Stonehenge . Meanwhile , he has carried_on the traditions by inventing new stories and songs of_his_own . Saturday night at Shade_Tree Stringed Instruments , he brought all those strands together in an engaging performance . His early show was a tapestry of spoken tall_tales , jokes and digressions ( all accompanied by nimble plucking on his primary instrument , the Celtic harp ) as well as solid folk_songs . It was an unpredictable yet cohesive and intelligently structured hour-plus in which wry observations about 1990s junk culture could intrude momentarily upon the strange and funny doings of enchanted characters from once upon a time . In one long set_piece , an impoverished Welsh harpist named Evan strikes it rich with supernatural help , hobnobs with God and the_devil ( the latter -- leave it to the_British -- speaks in an effete French accent ) , gets drunk a lot , and winds_up indirectly responsible_for the previously pure sea turning salty . Like the other Robin , Williamson commanded the diverse tools of a great storyteller : a gift for accents , dialogue and mimicry , flawless comic timing , a pliant face that could readily twist itself into all manner of illustrative , aptly humorous contortions , and a world-class twinkle in his blue eyes . The evening wasn ' t all tall_tales and laughter out loud . Williamson established his harp playing first with a traditional air , &quot; The Blackbird. &quot; The dulcet loveliness of his playing served as a reminder of why the angels in heaven are said to play harps instead of , say , banjos or electric_guitars . The concert also maintained a philosophic unity . The core theme was the unpredictable nature of life and its capacity to deal both laughter and blows . The tale of Evan suggested that things can work_out magically well , but Williamson followed it with &quot; Wheel of Fortune , &quot; a graceful ballad that suggests all ' s-well endings never are guaranteed : &quot; Life of man is most uncertain , &quot; goes the refrain , &quot; and there ' s none can say what may be. &quot; Williamson expounded upon that point with &quot; Maya , &quot; a 1968-vintage song from the wonderful Incredible String Band album &quot; Wee Tam and the Big Huge. &quot; He shortened the long opus considerably , but sang it with conviction , his round shoulders swaying like the unpredictable undulations of life depicted in the lyrics . &quot; Maya &quot; rode atop a guitar accompaniment that lent it a firm backbone and rhythmic complexity . Its harmonic structure has changed radically . Williamson sang in a lower key , giving what had been an airy piece for the ISB a new sense of weight and poignancy . Later , a lovely , symbolic ballad that holds_out idealistic hope for peace in Northern_Ireland led into a 19th-Century folk_song acknowledging crueler possibilities in its true account of a hellish prison colony in Australia . &quot; The Prisoner ' s Lamentation on the Death of Captain Logan &quot; ended with a sense of justice done , however ( the Nazi-like prison governor is slain by Aborigines ) . In a subsequent song about courtship gone awry , Williamson suggested that , as unpredictable as life is , we should face it hopefully : &quot; There ' s many_a dark and cloudy morning turns_out to be a fine and sunshiny day. &quot; Then again , nightfall always follows the day , as Williamson acknowledged in a concluding ballad full of intimations of death and sad parting . He sang it in aged , wizened tones that carried a quintessentially Celtic brand of sadness . Without tragedy that needs relieving , there would be no comic relief . Williamson is uniquely qualified to tell the whole story , the fanciful with the real , laughter with the tears .</TEXT>
