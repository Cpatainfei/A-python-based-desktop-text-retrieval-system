   <HEADLINE> LEGAL RULES MAY HAVE WRONG MAN IN PRISON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the fighting was over , one young_man had been shot in the head and Ernesto Avila , by his own account , was running_away with a gun in his pocket , fleeing the crowded Lynwood park before the police arrived . Avila got_away that afternoon in 1990 . But his brother , Jesus , was arrested and charged with attempted murder . Several witnesses say Ernesto Avila almost immediately tried to set the record straight , telling a private_investigator he had pulled the trigger , and then acknowledging the same to a lawyer . But neither the lawyer nor the private_investigator -- both of whom were bound by confidentiality rules -- told anyone about Ernesto Avila ' s admissions . When the case came_to trial , the jury did not hear anything about Ernesto ' s possible involvement , and Jesus was convicted . The Avila case has thrust the two brothers -- both of them gang members who had had scrapes with the law -- into a pair of intense legal debates , testing the limits of confidentiality agreements between lawyers and their clients and stoking a long-running controversy about whether judges are too unwilling to reopen criminal cases when new evidence emerges . At the center of one of those controversies is Jesus Avila ' s original lawyer , George D . Denny III , a respected Los Angeles criminal defense_lawyer , who learned early on that Ernesto Avila might be the shooter . But Denny never told anyone because he represented Ernesto in another matter and believed that he could not be a party to implicating him -- even if doing so might help clear his other client , Jesus . While Denny wrestled with his ethical quandary , Ernesto and the Avila family gambled . Rather than come_forward and testify for his brother at the trial , Ernesto kept his peace , hoping that Jesus would win his freedom anyway . &quot; We thought Jesus would be acquitted and Ernesto would not have to go_to jail either , &quot; said Christine Avila , their mother . &quot; Maybe that was the wrong thing , but that was what we hoped for. &quot; They were to be bitterly disappointed . &quot; I thought it was a joke , &quot; Jesus Avila said in an interview last week from prison . &quot; Now , the way this is going , it looks_like I ' m never going_to get out. &quot; When the case came_before Superior_Court Judge William R . Pounders after Jesus Avila ' s conviction , the judge heard sworn testimony that Ernesto Avila was the guilty party , both from Ernesto and several other witnesses . Pounders declined to order a new trial for Jesus , saying later that he did not find Ernesto ' s admissions credible . Instead , Pounders ruled that Jesus ' trial_lawyer did a competent job with the information he had at the time and that Jesus received a fair trial . The result : Ernesto , who says he pulled the trigger , is free , while Jesus , who maintains his innocence , has spent nearly four years in some of the nation ' s toughest maximum security prisons for a crime that many people today doubt he committed . &quot; We , like doctors , like other people , sometimes make a mistake , &quot; Denny said of Pounders ' decision . &quot; Sometimes those mistakes can be very costly. &quot; * Jesus and Ernesto Avila were guests at a baby shower in Lynwood ' s Ham Park on Aug . 19 , 1990 . Pink and blue balloons floated from the benches and trees . A table was piled high with gifts . During the party , a group of young black_men wandered through the park and were confronted by Jesus and some of his friends , members of a Latino gang known as the Young Crowd . At first , the two groups talked_about their tattoos , but then a large group of Latino gangsters surrounded Demetrius Kidd and his friends , some of whom were members of a rival Crips gang . As they turned_to run , someone fired several shots . Kidd was hit behind the left ear and fell to the ground . Sheriff ' s deputies arrested Jesus Avila at the scene , and Kidd identified him as the attacker . Another witness , Romel Johnson , also testified that Jesus Avila was the shooter . But there were other witnesses who contradicted them . Several guests at the party -- including some with no apparent reason to lie for Jesus Avila -- recalled that he was far away from the area of the park where the shooting occurred . They remembered him hitting the ground when the shots were fired . Some of those witnesses went further . They told Denny ' s private_investigator , David Lynn , that Ernesto had been the shooter . At a hearing on Jesus ' appeal , Lynn described some of those conversations under oath . &quot; Did anyone else tell you that Ernesto was the shooter while you were the investigator on the case ? &quot; Barry Levin , one of Jesus ' lawyers , asked . &quot; He did , &quot; Lynn said . &quot; Ernesto. &quot; Lynn warned Denny that they might have a problem , so the lawyer called Ernesto in_for a meeting . According to testimony from several witnesses at the hearing , Denny questioned Ernesto and confronted him with the information that he was the shooter . Although Denny cannot recall the exact words from that meeting , he left convinced that Ernesto , not his brother , had fired the gun . &quot; I had no doubt whatsoever that Ernie did_it based on the conversation that we had , &quot; Denny said . &quot; He was telling me that he did it. &quot; Under most circumstances , a lawyer would be overjoyed to get such information . After all , Ernesto ' s admissions would greatly undermine the prosecution case against Jesus . A jury would almost certainly have a tough time convicting one brother of a crime that the other brother admitted committing . But no jury ever heard Ernesto ' s story . Instead , Denny told the court that he had a conflict_of_interest , and he withdrew from representing Jesus , never telling the lawyer who replaced him why he had been forced to make that decision . &quot; Quite frankly , I was in a quandary , &quot; Denny said . &quot; Because Ernie was my client in another matter , I had an absolute obligation to him . . . . Knowing what I did know at the time , I don ' t feel that I could have done anything else. &quot; Some legal_experts fault Denny for not sharing the information with the lawyer who took his place . But most agree that the lawyer-client relationship is so sacrosanct that Denny was obligated to keep Ernesto ' s secrets , even if that worked against the interests of Jesus . The California Rules of Professional Conduct strictly prohibit any lawyer from disclosing confidential communications from a client . There are a_few exceptions noted in the code -- in cases where a client obtained the services of a lawyer to commit a fraud , or when the lawyer believes disclosing information is needed to keep the client from committing a crime . But for the most part , the rules are unyielding . &quot; Under the rules of professional conduct , you can ' t tell anybody , even if it is to the value of another client , &quot; said Laurie Levenson , a Loyola law_school professor . &quot; You can just never do that. &quot; Lynn ' s handling of witness statements implicating Ernesto is more problematic . Those interviews are not covered by the attorney-client_privilege because they did not involve conversations with the client . Nevertheless , Lynn never turned_over the details of those interviews to anyone . In fact , he made_a_point of not taping them and not writing them down because he did not want to be a party to implicating Ernesto . &quot; This was a problem for me , &quot; Lynn said in an interview last week from San Salvador , where he is working with a United Nations commission investigating death squads . &quot; I ' d been an investigator for less than a year , and I was being told to protect both their interests . I couldn ' t do it. &quot; So Lynn sat on the information . When the new lawyer took_over for Denny , he got some files from Lynn but nothing indicating that the real shooter might be Ernesto . The new attorney tried to win an acquittal for Jesus by putting_on evidence that he was_on the other side of the park . Faced with other witnesses who identified Jesus as the shooter , the jury voted to convict . On May 31 , 1991 , Jesus was sentenced to life plus eight years in prison . * Two years later , Jesus got a second chance . This time , Ernesto came_to his defense . The court of appeal had reviewed Jesus ' plea for a new trial . Based on it , the court_ordered a special hearing , and Pounders was picked to handle it . As they prepared_for the hearing , Nancy Coan and Levin -- the two lawyers who represented Jesus in his appeal -- began canvassing witnesses . Several told them that Ernesto was the guilty party , so they met with him . He admitted it and said he would be willing to waive the attorney-client_privilege that had bound his lawyer to silence for two years . But Ernesto continued to hedge about testifying . According to his family and his brother ' s lawyers , he was frightened about the prospect of admitting his guilt under oath . In fact , Ernesto continued to balk right up_to the moment that the hearing began . Then , seeing his brother in court , Ernesto decided he would tell his story . Levin called him to the stand , and Ernesto , for the first time , told a judge that he was the shooter . Describing the events of that day , Ernesto told of a fight between his homeboys and the others and gave a disjointed account of people running in various directions . &quot; And then I reached in my pocket , and I pulled_out a handgun , and I shot a couple shots at them , &quot; he said . He equivocated about some details , claiming that he could not be totally sure that his shots struck Kidd because he never saw Kidd fall . But he testified that he fired the only shots in the park that day , and he acknowledged that his admission could be used against him . &quot; Do you have any reason to come_into court and , under oath , lie and say that you committed a serious crime that you did not commit ? &quot; Levin asked . &quot; No , there is no reason for me to do that , &quot; Ernesto responded . Having heard that testimony -- as well as the sworn testimony of the lawyer and private_investigator and a number of other witnesses -- the judge nevertheless declined to recommend that Jesus receive a new trial . Instead , Pounders found that Jesus was competently represented at trial and that Ernesto had missed the opportunity to come_forward at the time . Christine Avila was dumbfounded . &quot; Somebody comes_forward in a court of law , knowing the risks , and says he committed a crime , &quot; she said . &quot; He handed them all this evidence , and the judge sat there and didn ' t believe him . What more did he want ? &quot; Many legal_experts note that it is extraordinarily difficult to get judges to order new trials based on new evidence . In this case , the battle was made more difficult by the fact that Pounders only was asked to assess whether Jesus ' trial_lawyer had effectively represented him . But Levin stressed that no one was asking Pounders to free Jesus , merely to grant him a new trial so that a jury could assess the evidence against him in light of Ernesto ' s admissions . Other legal_experts sympathize_with Levin ' s frustration . &quot; Ten years ago , I was co-counsel in a case involving a 16-year-old named Gordon Castillo Hall , &quot; said Gerald F . Uelman , dean of the Santa Clara University Law_School . Hall was convicted of first-degree murder but on appeal his lawyers presented evidence that somebody else had done the shooting . The court threw_out Hall ' s conviction and the district_attorney then dropped the case , Uelman said . &quot; I ' m convinced that if that happened today , Gordon Hall would still be in jail , &quot; Uelman said . &quot; Courts don ' t have time to do_justice anymore. &quot; In an interview last week , Pounders acknowledged that it is difficult for appellate_courts to examine new evidence , but he explained that in the Avila case he did not find Ernesto credible . &quot; When this case began , my thought was , ' God help us if the process has convicted the wrong person , ' &quot; Pounders said . &quot; I felt it was my job to look_at this with wide eyes and almost a feeling of terror that the wrong person might have been convicted. &quot; In fact , Pounders said he felt exactly that as the evidence began coming_in . But as more witnesses testified -- a total of 23 took_the_stand in an extensive hearing -- he began to doubt Ernesto ' s story more and more . Ernesto ' s admissions , Pounders said , were evasive and inconclusive -- &quot; dancing in the shadows , &quot; the judge termed them -- and he concluded that they were &quot; an attempt to spring the actual criminal loose. &quot; Asked whether she is convinced that the right Avila brother is in prison , prosecutor Eleanor Barrett demurred . &quot; Frankly , it ' s irrelevant what I believe , &quot; she said . &quot; What ' s important is what the judge believes. &quot; Joseph P . Furman , a deputy attorney_general who handled the Avila case on appeal , stressed that prosecutors have &quot; an overriding duty to see that justice is done &quot; and added that Avila and his lawyers have had every opportunity to present the facts of their case . &quot; The issue was fully aired before a Superior_Court judge who was sitting as a referee , &quot; Furman said . &quot; There was a lengthy , thorough and comprehensive hearing. &quot; Based on Pounders ' recommendations , the court of appeal denied Jesus ' plea . The state Supreme Court followed_suit last month , leaving Jesus ' only possible recourse with the federal system . His family still holds_out hope , but it is fading . Other cases with some similarities have failed to sway the appeals courts : In 1993 , the U.S. Supreme Court denied an appeal by a Texas Death Row inmate who presented affidavits suggesting that his brother had committed the crime for which he was convicted . In that case , however , the brother was dead by the time the affidavits were filed . And the brother never told anyone at the time the crime was committed that he was to blame . Similarly , Sheldon Sanders was convicted of murder in a 1985 shooting in Compton . His brother later confessed to his lawyer , family and others . But when the brother was called to the stand , he invoked the 5th Amendment . The facts in the Avila case bode better for Jesus -- his brother has testified under oath and there is evidence , albeit disputed , that he admitted his responsibility just days after the shooting . Still , persuading a court to order a new trial remains an uphill struggle , as even his family and lawyers concede . &quot; I always say that this is the one that got_away , &quot; Levin said . &quot; Jake ( Jesus ) is an innocent man , and he may spend the rest of his life in prison just because no one bothered to give him a fair hearing . that ' s wrong. &quot; Jesus ' father , Ernesto Avila Sr. , could not agree more . &quot; They say it ' s justice for all , but they got the wrong guy , &quot; he said last week , sifting through photographs of his two sons . &quot; that ' s no justice for anyone. &quot;</TEXT>
