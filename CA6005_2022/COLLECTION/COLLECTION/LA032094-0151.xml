   <HEADLINE> HEAT &amp; SOUL ; BAHIA ' S UNIQUE AFRICAN-BRAZILIAN SENSIBILITY , A LEGACY OF BRUTAL SLAVE_TRADE , HAS LEFT BEHIND A MESMERIZING MIX OF PASSIONATE SPIRITUALITY AND EXOTIC SENSUALITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It took two buses and three more hours of bouncing travel after our Saturday morning flight from Rio de Janeiro to the northeastern Brazilian city of Salvador , but we decided to push_on to Cachoeira that same day . We wanted to be sure we would n ' t miss that evening ' s service of Candomble , in the town where it is most devoutly practiced . An African-Brazilian cult developed by black slaves forced to mask their Yoruba religion in the cloak of Catholicism , Candomble is still widely practiced throughout Brazil ' s Bahian region . During all-night ceremonies , shaman priestesses , spun into frenzied trances , serve as conduits between worshippers and their African orixas or deities . Perhaps more_than anything else , Candomble evokes for me the passionate soulfulness and exotic sensuality of Bahia . The Brazilian state of Bahia is where Portuguese explorers landed at the turn of the 16th Century . They stayed for more_than 300 years , turning this coastal region and its capital city of Salvador into a wealthy commercial hub and a slave trading_post . Today , industrial development has not kept pace with that in the nation ' s southern states , leaving the vast majority of its black-skinned residents in dire poverty . Still , Bahia ' s African connection has left a cultural legacy that causes even its often condescending neighbors further south to consider it the soul of Brazil . That sensibility is what drew me and my friends Miriam and Ruth to northeastern Brazil in late August for an eight-day trip . And Bahia delivered on its promise of of spiritual and cultural intensity . I tasted it in the fragrant stews spiced with dende palm_oil and coconut_milk and heard it in pulsating African rhythms that pounded my lungs and eyes as much as my ears ; I read it in the magical lyricism of Bahian novelist Jorge Amado and saw it in the grotesquely carved wooden statues depicting proud Africans in chains , a reminder of Bahia ' s brutal history of plantation slavery . That first night in Bahia , I also felt it at the enigmatic Candomble ceremony we found , with the help of a cabdriver , across the river in Cachoeira ' s sister village , Sao Felix . As we made our way up a dirt path that wound around shabby matchbox houses , I heard a steady drum beat and a piercing chant that managed to simultaneously pique my sense of adventure as well as my anxiety . One look inside the crowded , steamy house at the top , however , and rapt wonder shoved aside my discomfort . Two women , heads shaved , lay face down in the center of the floor , their white lace petticoats ballooning around them like parachutes that had just hit level ground . Slowly they rose to their feet , joining three other women in a sensuous dance-like movement . Suddenly one woman went rigid , her cocoa-colored features collapsed in on each other as if her face were compressed in a painful vise . The fevered intensity of the trance lasted only a_few moments before her body slumped and the other women gently led her out of the room . Although the ceremony usually continues till dawn , after only an hour I was already drunk with the throbbing rhythms and ritualistic movements that we were welcome to quietly watch but failed to fully understand . We awoke the next morning determined not to spend another night in the dirty , bug-infested pousada , or pension , we had happened_upon the evening before . So we moved to what every guidebook seemed to agree is the only place worth staying in Cachoeira , the Convento do Carmine , an old Franciscan monastery that has been converted into a charming hotel . We stayed in one of the blessedly clean , high-ceilinged rooms with dark mahogany floors that are located around the perimeter of a lush , open-air square of green at the center of the monastery . Although barely anyone spoke English , nearly everyone we ran_into patiently waited until we made ourselves understood , using a blend of phrase-book Portuguese and hand signals . The town , designated a historical landmark by UNESCO , boasts 18th-Century churches and municipal buildings that date_back to the days when Cachoeira was a busy trading post between the vast sugarcane plantations and the rest of Brazil . But that morning , we opted to leave our guidebook in the room and just wander through the sleepy colonial town . We passed the delicate , scalloped facades of row_houses , some crumbling away from years of neglect . Yet their chipped and fading pastels lent the town an aura of authenticity that the studied prettiness of historical reconstructions couldn ' t hope to match . It was winter in this country below the Equator , and by afternoon a chilling rain drove us back to the convent where we decided to indulge , Brazilian style , in a langorous two-hour lunch that cost less than $ 10 each . We had the convento ' s entire dining_room to ourselves and watched the rain as a sweet-faced waiter served us a thick , steaming soup made of potatoes , carrots and rutabagas . Then we moved_on to a moqueca , a heavenly sizzling , spiced Bahian stew usually made with shrimp or fish . * After Coachoeira ' s spiritualism , we opted for the sensuousness of the deserted beaches of Praia do Forte , about a two-hour bus ride_away . We decided to forego the luxurious but pricey Praia do Forte resort in favor of a quiet , inexpensive inn called Pousada des Artistes , that had suprisingly good paintings by its Spanish owner and small balconies strung with hammocks . Although I ' m not sure which Candomble divinity granted our wish , by morning the previous day ' s steel-wool sky was replaced by a dazzling sun that warmed temperatures to the 80s . Ruth slept_late , so Miriam and I set_out to explore the sea_turtle sanctuary that sits right off the beach , before sitting_down at our pousada to a breakfast of fried cinnamon bananas , fresh rolls , and thick slices of mangoes , pineapples and papaya . As with most hotels or inns in Brazil , breakfast was included in the room rate . We immediately fell_into our own routine of activities at Praia do Forte , which primarily consisted_of lying on the deserted beach ( seven miles long ) , eating pungent moquecas , and drinking smoldering sugar-cane alcohol at the restaurants and bars along the village ' s main_road . The rest readied us for our plunge back into the energetic swirl of Salvador . The capital of Portuguese-ruled Brazil until 1763 , Salvador has never regained the wealth that flowed in as sugarcane , tobacco , and gold flowed_out . But Brazil ' s fourth largest city , situated on the tip of a jutting peninsula that looks_out_on All Saints Bay , manages to retain joyous vitality . Since there was a music festival occuring in Salvador during our visit , we decided for once to make room reservations . We chose a simple , Italian-run hotel recommended by my guidebook and located in a section near the beach called Barra , a center for restaurants , hotels and nightlife . But while we slept there , we spent our days in Pelourinho , the city ' s historical district which contains the best examples of colonial architecture on the continent . Pelourinho , which means whipping post , also has a darker notoriety as the auction_block or punishment site for many of the estimated 5 million slaves_shipped to Brazil to work the sprawling plantations and gold mines owned by Portuguese colonists . Now a UNESCO-protected historical area , Pelourinho is in the midst of a $ 30-million restoration project that has spawned an angry debate between those who believe it will protect Bahia ' s cultural legacy and those who fear gentrification will squeeze_out poor black Brazilians who embody that heritage . Though entire blocks are often swarming with workmen , the triangular center of Pelhourinho swarms with tourists weaving in and out of a succession of shops selling handsewn lace , strangely shaped musical_instruments and even intricately carved coffins balanced upright in a row like soldiers at roll_call . Ruth and I had stopped inside one of the brightly painted , baroque storefronts when Miriam came running back to fetch us . A tall , well-muscled teen-ager had beckoned her into one of the capoeira schools to watch a demonstration . If Bahia ' s African spirit finds a religious outlet in Candomble , its vent for artistic impulses is capoeira . Part-martial art , part-dance , capoeira was developed by slaves disguising their combat techniques from their masters ' watchful eyes . Performing to the tinny plink of a berimbau , a one-stringed gourd instrument , capoeiristas manage to blend fierceness and grace in thrilling , rapid-fire acrobatics . Mesmerized by the stunning choreography , we ended_up following the troupe like capoeira groupies as they performed through the cobblestone streets for tips . * In true Bahian style , we spent our last_day in Salvador mixing the sensual and the spiritual . In the morning , we walked along the beach in Barra , watching the rows of thong-bathing-suited sunbathers drinking out of split coconut shells . In the afternoon , we made a pilgrimage to the 18th-Century church of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim in the western part of the city . Though other churches outdo it in architectural brilliance and ornate decor , Bonfim is unmatched for the intensity of its religious devotees . The most striking testament to faith in Saint Bonfim ' s power is off the sanctuary in the Sala dos Milagres , Room of Miracles , where white translucent plastic arms , heads , feet , lungs and hearts hang from the ceiling as in a ghostly meat locker . Suppliants offer the waxy body_parts to ask_for help or give_thanks for a successful lung operation or to speedily mend a broken arm . Below , the walls are plastered with letters , photographs , momentos and ribbons thanking Bonfim for rescuing a missing child , for help on a test , for blessing a marriage . On the approach to the church , scrawny children ran after us , throwing ribbons in the hopes of getting a tip_in exchange . Legend has it that by tying a ribbon or fita around your wrist and allowing it to fall_off naturally , your wish will come true . Although not particularly superstitious , we had sufficiently fallen_under Bahia ' s spell to be wary of courting bad_luck by prematurely cutting_off the ribbon . So we all tied our fitas in loose knots that would undo at the slightest movement . Yet our cab driver , who credited Bonfim with helping him buy his taxi , was so moved by our apparent faith in the saint ' s power that he insisted on properly securing the fita around Miriam ' s wrist . Indeed , his handiwork is still remarked upon by our friends , who three months later , rarely fail to comment on the graying , ragged ribbon that is still tightly wound around her wrist .
