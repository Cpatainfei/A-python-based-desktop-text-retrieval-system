   <HEADLINE> AFTER THE FALL , CITRON SILENT , DEFENDERS FEW ; PROFILE : LONG CAREER MARKED BY CREDIBILITY , WORK ETHIC AND FINANCIAL ACUMEN ENDS IN AN EXTRAORDINARY TWIST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For years , Robert L . Citron was lauded as the genius whose aggressive investment strategies brought_in millions of dollars for Orange County and other governments . He was a popular figure -- particularly for a Democrat in a Republican bastion . But on Monday , if there was anyone in political circles who still thought he was up_to the job , they weren ' t saying so -- or at least not very loudly . Not even Citron himself . Holed_up in his Santa Ana home after resigning in the midst of the county ' s financial crisis -- Citron remained silent . It was an extraordinary twist in the political career of a man whose credibility and work ethic and ability to gain reelection had rarely been challenged in more_than two decades of public_service . The first hint of trouble had come last spring , as Citron faced his first political opponent since he was elected treasurer in 1970 . Citron was almost aghast that anyone -- especially his Republican challenger , John M.W. Moorlach -- would question his handling of the county ' s billions . &quot; My reputation is so good as_to the types and the quality of investments that I do , &quot; he said at the time . &quot; I ' m not blowing my own horn here , but I am recognized nationally for my investment ability and by the state of California. &quot; Citron ' s opinion of himself was echoed then by many others -- Democrats and Republicans -- including Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F . Riley , who told The Times : &quot; I don ' t know how in the hell he does_it , but he makes us all look good. &quot; One of his longtime friends , Republican businessman Doy Henley , remembered teasing Citron during the most recent campaign . &quot; How come you ' re the only county treasurer that ' s getting this &quot; return on the investment ? Henley would ask jokingly . &quot; He never answered me on that one . . . . He ' s the kind of guy that could not do_well with a lot of criticism . He had never had any criticism. &quot; Now , in what has proven to be not only a looming financial disaster but also a political embarrassment for top Orange County officials , no one was looking good -- especially not Citron . The man known as a &quot; fighter &quot; who would never give_up ultimately gave_in after a barrage of unprecedented criticism . Citron received support Monday from some outside the political circle , like Howard Hughett , a board_member of the Orange County Trojan Club , where Citron was known as an unabashed cheerleader for his alma_mater . ( His car is equipped with USC vanity plates and a horn that plays the university fight song , and past Christmas_cards featured him and his wife , Terry , attired in Trojan colors. ) &quot; I don ' t think he should have &quot; resigned , Hughett said . &quot; Why should he ? &quot; Operating in relative obscurity for so many years , Citron was rarely seen on the local political circuit of dinners and fund-raisers . But he was a veteran of the internal political battles of Orange County government . Early in his career , he was reprimanded by the Orange County Grand_Jury for unjustly criticizing the head of the county ' s data-processing department . And in one of his first run-ins with Sheriff Brad Gates , Citron accused Gates of trying to &quot; con &quot; the county in_order to get more money for his departmental budget . When he learned this year that Gates would not be joining the county ' s $ 2-million gang prosecution program -- funded with proceeds from Citron ' s investments -- he was one of the few county officials to publicly criticize the sheriff . Gates threatened to &quot; have a heck of a lot to say &quot; if Citron ever verbally attacked him again . Citron was confident , then . He was the hero . He had helped write the state law more_than a decade ago that allowed local_government treasurers across the state to engage in his innovative investment planning . During the last decade , his investments yielded an average return of 9.03 % -- nearly double that of some comparable investment pools . He was known as a man who worked around the clock and rarely took vacations . The &quot; gifts &quot; he listed on financial-disclosure forms were mostly dinners with investment_advisers . In September , 1993 , for example , he reported a dinner with seven investment_firms -- with each firm chipping_in $ 14.06 to cover the bill . He also reported a $ 22 Christmas wreath from Bradford and Marzec Inc. , a Los Angeles firm , and a $ 9.48 pocket calendar from Callan Associates . As the only Democrat in elective office in Orange County government , Citron said he tried to separate his personal politics from county business . He once hosted a fund-raiser for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown in his Santa Ana home , and in recent years gave only token campaign contributions to recipients including U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein and the local and state Democratic Party organizations . But in what he would later blame as the reason Republicans had targeted him in his most recent election , Citron sent_out a letter using his official title in 1990 on behalf of then-Assemblyman Tom Umberg , the Garden Grove Democrat . The Democratic Assemblyman beat Republican Curt Pringle , and county GOP Chairman Thomas Fuentes never forgot it . With the backing of the local Republican leaders , Moorlach entered the race this year and began criticizing Citron ' s investment portfolio , calling it too risky . Never having been challenged before -- his last fund-raiser had been held eight years ago when he thought he might have an opponent -- Citron reached_into his own pocket and jump-started his reelection campaign with an $ 11 # 000 loan to himself . And then he began raising money , including some from firms that do business with the county . During the last campaign , Citron raised $ 51 # 222 -- a large amount for a race usually ignored by voters . About one-third of the donations came from attorneys , investment_bankers and brokerage_firms , including $ 3 # 000 from members of the county ' s brokerage_firm , Merrill Lynch . As pressure mounted in recent days for Citron to resign , some of his financial backers in the investment community did not want to comment . Some quickly hung_up when they heard his name . Republican activists who failed to unseat Citron in the June primary were now smug . &quot; Over the past few days , we had a lot of people calling_in for a recall effort , &quot; said Bill Christianson , executive_director of the county GOP . &quot; Today , we ' ve had people calling_in and saying , ' We told you so. ' &quot; Republican Vice Chairwoman Jo Ellen Allen echoed the sentiment and laid part of the blame at the feet of the Board of Supervisors -- all Republicans -- who chose to back Citron instead of listen to Moorlach ' s concerns . &quot; They should have looked_at it and instead they chose to ignore it , &quot; Allen said . &quot; It sounds to me like ( Citron ) must be in more trouble than he thought , otherwise he would have stuck this out. &quot; For his part , Moorlach urged the county Monday to set_up an independent citizen panel to review the financial crisis and said he would consider taking_on the treasurer ' s job if the supervisors ask him . But there is a chance that may_not happen , since he has been a loud critic of the supervisors for refusing to heed his warnings . State Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) said Citron ' s resignation was &quot; probably was the appropriate thing to do &quot; from a political standpoint . &quot; But there ' s a concern as far as having the ability to bring aboard the expertise that we need at a time when we have to come_up with some solutions , &quot; said Bergeson , who joins the Board of Supervisors next month . During the campaign , she had withdrawn her endorsement of Moorlach because she feared his criticism of Citron might harm the county ' s investment pool . Some city officials who had gained from Citron ' s financial success before being shocked by the downfall were saddened by his decision to step_down . Seal Beach City_Manager Jerry L . Bankston called the resignation &quot; tragic. &quot; And La Palma City_Manager Pamela Gibson said she felt sorry about how a once glowing career had ended . &quot; I feel bad his career , which has been so successful and so beneficial to everyone involved , has to end this way , &quot; Gibson said . &quot; I think it ' s very , very sad and I wish it would be otherwise. &quot; Citron Moments Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron ' s 24-year career as a relatively low-profile public official has been largely successful and sometimes pointed : * Election : First elected county tax_collector in 1970 . Became treasurer in 1973 when Board of Supervisors combined the positions . * Politics : Only elected Democrat in Orange County government . Ran unopposed between 1970 and 1994 but faced unsuccessful election challenge in June primary from Republican John M.W. Moorlach , a certified_public_accountant who blasted his investment strategy as risky . * Most recent annual salary : $ 100 # 339 * Galling Gates : In one of his first public run-ins with County Sheriff Brad Gates in 1977 , Citron accused the sheriff of engaging in &quot; a con_game &quot; by asking_for more money in his budget than he needed and also subjecting the county to costly legal settlements . Gates responded that he didn ' t expect &quot; someone who manages a very small operation , performing relatively simple and predictable tasks , to understand the dynamics &quot; of running the Sheriff ' s Department . * Investors : Citron managed funds from 185 cities , school districts and other government_agencies . Yields from his investment pool have been consistently the highest in the state . * Lobbying : Successfully lobbied the state in the 1970s to expand the investment options of government_agencies . Citron ' s success over the years lured Santa Barbara and other municipalities from outside Orange County , along with nearly all local agencies , to contribute to investment pool . In the county , only San Juan Capistrano and Garden Grove did not contribute . * Investment strategy : Relied heavily on using investment pool ' s Treasury_bills and bonds as collateral to borrow short-term at low interest_rates and investing the borrowed funds in mid-term corporate_bonds and securities that pay higher return rate . * Returns : Averaged 9.03 % return during the past decade , nearly double that of some comparable investment pools . However , in the past three years , returns have declined steadily , dropping as interest_rates increased . * Best return : 16.9 % in 1982 . * Recognition : Named by the trade magazine City &amp; State as one of the best county finance officers in the nation in 1988 . Honored in December , 1993 , by County Board of Supervisors for generating enough interest revenue through his investments to bankroll a new gang-suppression program run_by the district_attorney ' s office . * Current status : Citron announced his resignation Monday , less than a week after disclosures that his risky investment strategy led to a $ 1.5-billion drop_in the county ' s portfolio , now valued at $ 18.5 billion .
