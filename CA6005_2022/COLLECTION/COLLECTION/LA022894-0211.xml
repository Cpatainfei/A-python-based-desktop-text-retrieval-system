   <TEXT> Twenty years ago , they called it a puffy , fluffy , tacky magazine filled with celebrity piffle that could be read cover to cover in the supermarket checkout line . Some of those same barbs are still being lobbed at People magazine two decades later . But after attaining a circulation of 3.15 million and becoming a Time Inc. money machine , the weekly is laughing all_the way to the cash_register . Its 20th anniversary double issue hits the newsstands today , and the hoopla doesn ' t end there . With a hardcover book ( &quot; People Celebrates People : The Best of 20 Unforgettable Years &quot; ) , a commemorative soft-bound publication ( &quot; 20 Years of People Covers &quot; ) and a television_show ( &quot; People ' s 20th Birthday , &quot; scheduled to air March 7 on ABC ) , this birthday seems more a national event than a mere milestone . Maybe that ' s fitting for a magazine that has chronicled popular culture while becoming part of it . It has given us royal battles ( Di versus Charles ) , battles_royal ( Mia versus Woody ) , royal pains ( Morton Downey Jr. ) , plus fads ( mood rings ) , trends ( disco ) , flops ( New Coke ) losses ( Ryan White ) and triumphs ( the 1980 Olympic gold medal-winning U.S. ice_hockey team ) . It has determined the Sexiest Man Alive , the Most Intriguing People , and the Best and Worst Dressed . But People magazine deserves credit for more_than its breezy blips and copious black_and_white photos , its supporters say . &quot; I think the magazine took the term popular culture and broadened it enormously , just as it broadened the term celebrity , &quot; says Richard Stolley , the founding editor of People and senior editorial adviser for Time Inc. &quot; If you had asked back then what a celebrity was , the answer would have been someone in entertainment and sports , probably . What People discovered through its correspondents is all these interesting people out there . . . who rose to national prominence in so many other fields. &quot; People didn ' t just broaden the term celebrity , it blew it up_to the size of a football_field . Springing from the back pages of Life magazine , the weekly debuted on Feb . 28 , 1974 , cost 35 cents ( current price : $ 2.39 ) and featured on the cover Mia Farrow coyly biting a strand of pearls . Until then , Americans had gotten their personality news via such newspaper_columnists as Walter Winchell and Hedda Hopper , breathless fanzines such_as Photoplay or the briefest of mentions in_general interest magazines and newspapers . People also vaulted just-plain folks to instant fame in showcasing what Stolley calls &quot; ordinary people doing extraordinary things , &quot; which has become one of the magazine ' s mantras . The Menendez brothers , Lorena Bobbitt and Amy Fisher all qualified for infamy status under this clause . The concept quickly caught_on . &quot; When I worked_at Newsweek , it had the Newsmakers section , and it was kind of dumb and dull , &quot; says Edwin Diamond , now media critic for New York magazine . &quot; After People magazine came_out , the People section of Time ( magazine ) was spiffed_up , the Newsmakers section of Newsweek was spiffed_up , newspapers had columns about Hollywood people , New York people . You can physically see the change , physically measure it in this country. &quot; Former Editor Stolley suggests that the cultural climate of the ' 70s was ideal for cultivating a personality magazine . &quot; We had just been through a decade of war , racial tension and protest , and the individual in a sense had gotten buried in things like mass protests , &quot; he says . &quot; By the time the magazine started , a lot of that anger had started to drain out and we were looking_at individuals again. &quot; Television may also have aided People ' s explosion , Diamond says . &quot; We had movie_stars in the ' 30s , ' 40s and ' 50s , but these people weren ' t coming_into the house . . . . Television just brought so many previously unknown visages into our homes. &quot; * The fallout from People can be seen all_over the media , in personality-driven magazines such_as US ( debuting in 1977 ) and Vanity_Fair ( debuting in 1983 ) , plus legions of television_news magazines and TV tabloid shows ( &quot; Inside Edition &quot; and &quot; Hard Copy &quot; ) . But the hunger has led to a feeding frenzy . The competition for access to celebrities -- real and manufactured -- is cutthroat . Want Whitney on your magazine cover ? Stand_in line . Dying to interview the players in a surrogate-mother custody_battle ? Talk to their agents and pray they haven ' t yet made a movie-of-the-week deal . Personalities have become commodities . &quot; I ' m waiting for the New Yorker to start putting celebrities on the cover , &quot; says Landon Y . Jones Jr. , managing editor of People since 1989 . &quot; There are many_more outlets seeking to live_off the same universe of stars , and that has driven_up the value ( of celebrities ) enormously . And that ' s happening to ordinary people who are thrust into fame . They ' re told ( by their agent or lawyer ) to hold_out for the best offer . . . . &quot; They ' re thinking , ' Why hand this over when we can control this , sell it , extract a higher price ? ' Everything ' s on the table now and being bargained for ( in an interview ) -- what ' s talked_about , what ' s not talked_about , who the writer will be . I would say we ' re not exactly Snow White , but most of the stuff we won ' t do. &quot; People won ' t promise a cover to a celebrity ( &quot; All we ' ll say is , ' We think it ' s going_to be a cover , ' &quot; Jones says ) and won ' t pay_for stories , although he knows how the celebrity journalism game is played . &quot; Do I ask_for covers ? Sure . Absolutely , &quot; says Pat Kingsley of the top L.A.-based publicity firm PMK , whose clients include Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise . Does she get them ? &quot; If I don ' t , we don ' t do the story , at times . You have to understand , this business is so competitive . . . . In order for ( a magazine ) to get exclusivity , we ' ve got_to get something in return . Those are the rules . But ( the magazines ) set that agenda , not us. &quot; Kingsley concedes that a_People cover is &quot; an advantage , &quot; but it ' s difficult to say if it translates into higher box_office receipts . &quot; It ' s all hopeful , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s something you can ' t prove . You just know you have to try . Because the ad dollars are so expensive , you have to have that free publicity. &quot; * But sometimes &quot; free &quot; publicity exacts a price . Although she declined to discuss specifics , Kingsley hinted that she has not always been thrilled with People ' s treatment of her clients . &quot; I think there was a time when we didn ' t work with ( People ) for about a year , &quot; Kingsley says . &quot; I don ' t want to go_into it , it was a promise made that wasn ' t kept . But none of those ( editors ) are there anymore. &quot; One well-publicized case of a star getting_into a snit occurred in 1988 , when Robin Williams was profiled in a_People cover story . It chronicled the breakup of Williams ' marriage to Valerie Velardi and cast the couple ' s nanny , Marsha Garces ( now his wife ) , as the home-wrecker . &quot; At 35 , Robin is caught_up in a private turmoil of passion and anguish , &quot; the magazine gushed , reading like the cover blurb of a bodice-ripping romance novel . Williams was still steamed about the story last fall , saying in an interview with the Los Angeles Times : &quot; They wrote an article basically saying things that were untrue . The idea of home-wrecking is b.s. &quot; &quot; Does_it bother me ? Yes , &quot; Jones says of Williams ' anger . &quot; It was six years ago . I ' ve talked to him and said , ' The whole staff of the magazine has changed since the story appeared , why do you keep doing this ? ' But you and I would probably feel the same way if it happened to us. &quot; The struggle for control has led to fewer celebs wanting to tell all , Jones says . &quot; There are definitely people who are afraid to reveal much of themselves in public at all , &quot; he says . &quot; that ' s posed a problem for us because we really like to see people at_home , a real look_at a real person . It happens , but it ' s harder and harder to get . Certain people -- certain publicists -- are harder to deal with. &quot; But actress Tracey Gold has done some gut-spilling . A recent cover story updated readers on her struggle with anorexia , first chronicled in a 1992 People cover story . Why put a semi-obscure television actress on the cover ? &quot; Her cover two years ago was one of our best all-time sellers , &quot; Jones explains . &quot; We knew the public was interested in her and her battle with anorexia and this was a sequel story . It did OK , not the blockbuster we thought it was going_to be , but there were no problems. &quot; * The magazine ' s best newsstand seller was the &quot; John Lennon : A Tribute &quot; cover in 1980 ; &quot; Prince Charles &amp; Princess Diana : It ' s Over &quot; became the all-time highest circulation ( subscription and newsstand ) issue . And Princess Di has the distinction of being the most popular cover_girl , appearing 32 times ( followed by Elizabeth Taylor and Fergie , tying at 12 each ; Michael Jackson at 10 ; Cher at 9 , and Jacqueline Onassis at 8 ) . But don ' t expect an unending supply of royal covers . &quot; We had a peak year in 1992 , &quot; Jones says . &quot; The royals is Diana -- Fergie and Andrew are supporting players in the story of Diana . Now that she truly seems to be heading into private life , even though she may be dating , I don ' t think she ' ll have the prominence she had before . We haven ' t had a Diana cover so far in 1994 -- and my God , we ' re almost out of February ! &quot; If Di does make major headlines again , you can bet People editors will be sizing_up cover photos . So will countless other publications , and readers will be sopping_up every factoid they can . Can they distinguish between the information carried in a_People or Vanity_Fair and the print and broadcast tabloids ? &quot; I used to think that people could distinguish fact from fancy , hype from reality , show_business from news , that people are smarter than we give them credit for , &quot; says media critic Diamond . &quot; But I ' m beginning to entertain the notion that there ' s so_much out there that numbness is taking_over . Everything is impossibly muddied now . I used to believe that people could make the distinction -- I still believe that emotionally , if not intellectually. &quot; Jones has a bit more faith in his readers : &quot; I think people do know the difference between the tabloids and People . I believe people take our magazine seriously . When it ' s a media feeding frenzy , as with Tonya ( Harding ) and Nancy ( Kerrigan ) , I think we present a reasonable point_of_view . &quot; There ' s an earthquake , fires , the Whitewater issue -- and everyone sits there with their eyes half-closed . But someone comes_over and says , ' Let me tell you what happened to my sister during the earthquake , ' then everyone listens . It ' s fundamental to the magazine ' s success to find the common human experiences and relate them. &quot;</TEXT>
