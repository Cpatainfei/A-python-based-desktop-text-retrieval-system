   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; TURBULENT MARKETS SEEN MASKING HEALTHY ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Talk_about the mysteries of finance . Strange as it is for most folks to understand , the strengthening U.S. economy is being blamed for the unsettling drop_in stock and bond prices as interest_rates have risen dramatically in recent weeks . Each day ' s good economic news seems to rattle the financial markets -- and Thursday was no exception . Government reports that unemployment claims fell while factory orders rose were cited by analysts to explain further declines in the value of bonds and stocks . What is going_on ? Are we at a turning point , as some analysts believe , where fears of inflation and a fragile global financial system are about to send the markets -- and the economy -- into a long decline ? No , say the great majority of economic and financial experts . The markets , as they usually do , are reacting to fears that economic expansion will bring increased inflation and rising interest_rates . But this time market fears appear to be overblown . What is really happening is that the U.S. economy is expanding in a very healthy way , with rising productivity and without more inflation . And that healthy expansion could continue for some years , according to Federal_Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , who surprised analysts a month ago when he raised short-term interest_rates . The markets reaction to that move has been extraordinary , but analysts now believe that Greenspan ' s purpose may_not have been the usual inflation-fighting action but part of a strategy to deflate the threat of an international speculative bubble . The activities of major global investors , swinging massive amounts of borrowed capital in international securities and currency markets , threatened to become a destabilizing force . These so-called &quot; hedge_funds &quot; made huge bets early this year that interest_rates on Japanese and European bonds would continue to drop and that the Japanese yen would weaken . But their investments , more_than $ 300 billion by some estimates , distorted bond markets in Europe and Japan . To counter this potentially dangerous speculation , according to a growing consensus among financial professionals , Greenspan raised U.S. rates , thus affecting European and Japanese markets . This caused the hedge_fund bets to go_wrong , with billions of dollars in losses . The resultant sell-offs of their holdings have contributed to market gyrations , many traders say . That explains the violent reaction in U.S. stock and bond markets to Greenspan ' s small quarter-point hike in U.S. interest_rates , to 3.25 % from 3 % . Since Feb . 4 , nervous traders have driven_up the rate on the U.S. Treasury ' s 30-year bond , the instrument that influences most mortgages and business and consumer borrowing , to 6.83 % from 6.3 % . In the super-sensitive world of the financial markets , that ' s a dramatic rise , &quot; one of the fastest in 40 years , &quot; according to John Isaacson , research_director of Payden &amp; Rygel , a Los Angeles investment_firm specializing in fixed income securities . But with ordinary home mortgages and mutual_funds being affected by distant events , investors are worried . Many wonder whether this is a rerun of 1973 when a quadrupling in the price of oil sparked raging inflation and sent stocks into a long decline . Or is it 1987 all_over again , when the markets crashed amid mounting trade tension and an overheating economy ? This time is not at all like those earlier periods . The U.S. economy and financial markets are not on the brink of a long decline . On the contrary , the economy has turned from its long recovery from the recession of 1990-91 into an expansion . Economists now predict 3.6 % growth this year , or an additional $ 216 billion worth of economic activity . California may_not join fully in such growth until early next year , although a better national economy could quicken the pace here . That kind of economic_growth creates jobs , and in fact most predictions are that this morning ' s unemployment report will be favorable . Yet increased inflation is not seen as a real threat because productivity , up more_than 4 % last year , is growing across the board . Both in manufacturing and services_industries , U.S. business is getting more output per dollar of investment or hour of labor these days . And that means low or decreasing inflation . Today , change is in the air , not decline . The economies of Europe and Asia are adjusting to the post-Cold War period , as the U.S. economy has been doing since 1990 . Though the effort to change Japan ' s has led to a very public dispute , it is not likely to upset an increasingly interdependent and growing world economy . The contrast with earlier periods of economic change and market volatility is dramatic . In 1973 , the start of a bear_market saw a quadrupling in the price of oil and the instability of Watergate in the U.S._government . In 1980 , then Federal_Reserve Chairman Paul A . Volcker was forced to bail_out U.S. and international banks that had become overextended in the inflation-driven speculations in silver , oil and other commodities . He also had to take stern action , and trigger a recession , to break the back of double-digit inflation . Greenspan , who acted quickly to curb the market slide in 1987 , may have made a timely move again . He stepped_in to curb hedge_fund speculation before banks and markets were truly threatened . Some financial professionals disagreed_with his action , saying in_effect that the normal workings of markets would have resolved difficulties . But markets typically go_to extremes before speculation is reversed , in a resounding crash with the collapse of brokerage_houses and threatened failures of banks . It is when bank_failure is threatened that economies are truly disrupted . As with Volcker in 1980 , the Federal_Reserve has to step_in with emergency funds , distorting and inflating the economy . No crash seemed imminent in the current situation , but there was a halt in trading Wednesday in the stock of Bankers Trust New York , one of the leading dealers in interest_rates swaps and other mechanisms of what are called financial derivatives , so that reports of trouble could be dispelled . Still , even the fact that the economy could be threatened by excesses of hedge_funds and deal making in obscure financial instruments like interest_rate swaps , will strike most people as inexplicable . If hedge_funds are a threat , why are they allowed at all ? The answer is that hedge_funds are just a part of a new and still-emerging global financial system in which more_than $ 1 trillion of securities , currencies and all manner of financial instruments are traded every day , with benefits for all . &quot; The trading is maximizing the efficiency of capital movements , bringing_together money that is available in one spot but required in another , &quot; says Dennis Weatherstone , chairman of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co . For example , financing for the development of countries like Mexico , China and Indonesia is possible because this immense financial market allows risk to be spread , Weatherstone and others explain . Risk is spread , typically , by swapping -- reducing the risk of a long-term loan to finance a factory in China , say , by trading it for a security that has a floating rate_of_interest . Trading it to whom ? Perhaps to one of the hedge_funds , which would accept the risk of long-term interest as part of its &quot; bet &quot; on the general direction of rates . The dangers in this new_world of finance are evident in the example : What if the factory doesn ' t get built_on time , and its output is not then available to pay the loan ? What if interest_rates go_against the direction bet_on by the hedge_fund ? &quot; The consequence would be failure of the loan or bankruptcy of the hedge_fund , &quot; says Patricia Klink , president of Advisers Capital Management , a New York-based investment_firm . that ' s acceptable so_long as the bankruptcies don ' t get too_large and their consequences don ' t spread too far . One reason for the volatility in_stock and bond markets today is that Fed Chairman Greenspan stepped_in to prevent things from going too far . As the dramatic effects of his action play_out , ordinary investors and mortgage holders are advised to keep_an_eye_on the underlying strength of the U.S. economy and not be diverted by the froth on the top . * RELATED STORIES : D1 , D2</TEXT>
