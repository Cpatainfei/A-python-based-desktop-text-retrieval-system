   <HEADLINE> COUNTERPUNCH : ' ALL-AMERICAN GIRL ' : IS IT GOOD OR BAD TELEVISION ? ; ASIAN AMERICANS PUT_ON TRIAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like many others in the diverse Asian American viewing audience , I anxiously awaited the debut of &quot; All-American Girl &quot; on ABC starring Margaret Cho , starved as we are for substantive representation on prime-time network television . And as a student of America ' s most potent art_form -- the situation_comedy -- I wondered how well the Cho show would fare among competitive programs . Moreover , I hoped for a commercially successful program that did not compromise Cho ' s formidable talent as an Asian American performer . Despite its sometimes feeble humor , flaccid gags and prodigious underutilization of talent -- B . D . Wong and the other co-stars probably could carry a program by themselves -- I found &quot; All-American Girl &quot; to be no more , no less banal than most other sitcoms . But what rankles most is the underlying assumption that people of Asian descent living_in the United States are somehow less than &quot; All-American. &quot; The very title of the program begs the question . In a book I wrote_about the relationship between postwar American society and the TV sitcom , &quot; Nervous Laughter &quot; ( 1989 ) , I discuss the proliferation of shows beginning in the late 1960s that featured African Americans . Until &quot; Julia &quot; appeared in 1968 , African Americans had been virtually excluded from TV as featured performers . Today , African Americans are actually overrepresented on TV , according to a recent report issued by the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington . Beyond their respective superficial differences , 1970s-vintage programs such_as &quot; Julia , &quot; &quot; Sanford and Son , &quot; &quot; Good Times , &quot; &quot; that ' s My Mama , &quot; &quot; The Jeffersons , &quot; &quot; What ' s Happening ! ! &quot; and &quot; Diff ' rent Strokes &quot; attempted to normalize and &quot; regulate &quot; a restive African American population after nearly two decades of civil_rights struggle . Sitcoms such_as these helped admit African Americans into mainstream society on a &quot; probationary &quot; basis . It might be argued that Asian Americans -- currently the fastest-growing immigrant population -- are undergoing a process akin to that of African Americans more_than 20 years ago . Although Asian Americans have become an increasingly foreign-born population due_to the 1965 revision of national immigration law that once discriminated against Asians , it should be kept_in mind that Asians have had a productive presence in the United States over 150 years . Like immigrants from Europe , people of Asian descent have contributed to the vast social wealth of the United States for most of the Republic ' s existence . Yet as each of the episodes of &quot; All-American Girl &quot; has dramatized , Asian Americans are still very much on &quot; probationary &quot; status . This time it is the fictional Kim family who bears responsibility for &quot; normalizing &quot; a diverse group that is beginning to assert its presence in institutions that were once the exclusive preserve of European Americans . The controversy surrounding the week of interviews with Judge Lance Ito granted to reporter Tritia Toyota of KCBS news notwithstanding , the most noteworthy aspect of the broadcasts was that for the first time the viewing public was permitted to observe a bright , articulate , witty , compassionate and wryly humorous Asian American individual speak_for himself without others scripting the words , as in &quot; All-American Girl. &quot; * Comedian Henry Cho does a great job hosting &quot; Friday Night &quot; ( NBC ) during fringe hours ( 1:30 a.m. ) while Johnny Yune presides over a Korean-language program on KSCI , but it was the television appearance of Ito that ironically demonstrated the virtual absence of Asian Americans capable of speaking_for themselves on perhaps the most important of communications media . Although the program represents a significant step toward democratic representation on TV , it is not enough for &quot; All-American Girl &quot; to feature a predominantly Asian American cast . For Asian Americans to escape this insidious form of social containment , they must gain access to positions where substantive decisions are made : producing , writing , directing . But for this to occur , the television industry must reform exclusionist practices that prevent minorities from occupying such positions . For example , the &quot; Hollywood Writers ' Report &quot; ( 1993 ) commissioned by the Writers Guild , West , states that &quot; non-minority writers still account_for over 95 % of employment in television. &quot; There are few professions so racially segregated as TV and film writing . The situation is simply unacceptable in a multiracial , democratic society . Cho can be applauded for her welcome efforts in making the absurdities of Asian American life the basis of her art . ( Yes , why is it that Asian Americans -- regardless of Asian ethnicity -- always celebrate family occasions at Chinese restaurants ? ) Still , it is the art of the probationer , an adaptive strategy derived from continually being pressed to justify one ' s existence in a society where Asian Americans are viewed_as a perpetually alien presence . It is this undercurrent of anti-Asian racial intolerance that put the parents of Lance Ito in a relocation camp for most of the war years . The temporary media-induced celebrity of Ito should not blind us to the fact that even his presence on the bench has little effect on the probationary status of Asian Americans so_long as exclusionist practices reign in key institutions such_as those selfsame media industries .</TEXT>
