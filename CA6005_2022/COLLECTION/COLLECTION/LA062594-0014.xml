   <HEADLINE> JAPANESE PREMIER FACES VOTE OF NO-CONFIDENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata ' s efforts to lure the Socialist_Party back into his minority coalition ran_into a wall Friday , raising the likelihood that he will be forced to dissolve the lower house of Parliament and call a general_election . The lower house ' s steering_committee first scheduled a session for early today to vote on a no-confidence motion submitted Thursday by members of the Liberal Democratic Party , whose 38-year rule ended last summer . At 3 a.m. Friday , however , the committee rescheduled the session for noon today , and it was still uncertain that the vote would be conducted . Hata could preempt it by resigning , by dissolving the lower house or by an eleventh-hour , surprise compromise with the Socialists . Ichiro Ozawa , the coalition ' s chief strategist , emerged from a 10 1 / 2-hour meeting with Hata at 3:30 a.m. to say that consultations with the Socialists &quot; are not over yet. &quot; He refused to elaborate . On Friday , the Socialists stunned Hata , who only the day before had offered to appease them by going_through what he believed would be a ritual resignation . But Wataru Kubo , the Socialists ' secretary_general , declared that his party would not support Hata again in a lower house vote that would have to be conducted after the prime_minister stepped_down . For more_than a month , pledging to support Hata ' s reelection , Kubo had made Hata ' s &quot; voluntary &quot; resignation a face-saving prerequisite for the party ' s return to the coalition it bolted eight weeks ago . Ozawa immediately withdrew the offer for Hata to quit . Another meeting between Ozawa and Kubo was scheduled to allow the prime_minister ' s chief strategist to work_out with Hata the coalition ' s final reply to the Socialists . Despite the Socialists ' surprise demand for Hata ' s departure , Kubo made no suggestion as_to who should replace him as premier . Hata supporters unofficially proposed a &quot; grand conservative alliance &quot; that would give the Liberal Democrats a slice of the power they lost 11 months ago . But with its no-confidence motion pending , the party rejected the bid . Liberal Democrats , meanwhile , suggested they would be willing to support Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama as prime_minister , with their own leader , Yohei Kono , as vice premier in a coalition between the two parties that have been at each other ' s throats since 1955 , when both came_into existence . Whether the offer was sincere or merely an attempt to thwart the Socialists ' reunion with the coalition was unclear . No Socialist has been touted as a prime_minister since 1947 . Over the years , the party gradually has shed its Marxist ideology and advocacy of a socialist_economy . But it still maintains friendly relations with Communist North_Korea , advocates strong government subsidies for welfare and favors reducing defense spending . Its opposition to an opening of Japan ' s rice market and its refusal to support an increase in a 3 % consumption tax plagued former Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa during his eight months in office . Twelve hours after they joined in electing Hata prime_minister on April 25 , Socialists bolted his government , leaving the coalition with only 37 % of the seats in the lower house . Only the necessity to enact Japan ' s 1994 budget -- which passed the upper house Thursday -- forestalled a challenge to Hata at that time . Both the Socialists and the Liberal Democrats have condemned what they call &quot; arbitrary , high-handed &quot; decision-making by Ozawa . But they are united on few , if any , other policies .</TEXT>
