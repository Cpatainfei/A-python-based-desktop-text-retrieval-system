   <HEADLINE> VIRGINIANS IN CIVIL WAR OVER DISNEY PARK PLANS ; DEVELOPMENT : THE ATTRACTION IS INTENDED TO ILLUSTRATE HISTORY , BUT AT PRESENT IT ' S DRIVING A WEDGE BETWEEN BLUE-COLLAR HAYMARKET AND EXCLUSIVE THE PLAINS . HAYMARKET IS ECSTATIC , THE PLAINS AGHAST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A tale of two towns : Historic old Haymarket , workaday and blue-collar , where a church raises funds with an all-you-can-eat spaghetti supper and grocer Mike Davis sells nightcrawlers . And , just over Bull_Run Mountain , a town called The Plains , its tidy brick sidewalks and antique shops nestled in Virginia ' s old-money , fox-hunting countryside ; a place where the village smithy , craftsman Nol Putnam , forges ornate gateposts on his anvil . Between these two towns and these two neighbors , a wedge has been driven : Walt Disney is coming , to Haymarket ' s delight and The Plains ' dismay . Disney woke_up the countryside last fall by revealing that its agents had quietly bought land or options on 3 # 000 acres of Prince William County countryside , on the edge of Haymarket , as the site for its fifth theme park , its third in America . Disney ' s America is intended to illustrate American history , from Pocahontas to Steven Jobs . The park will open in 1998 -- unless opponents like blacksmith Putnam prevail . Disney plans a man-made lake where the Monitor and the Merrimack will re-enact their Civil War battle . America ' s immigrant experience will be retold at a replica of Ellis Island . The &quot; painful , disturbing and agonizing &quot; stories of the enslavement of the blacks , the massacre of the natives , the divisions of Vietnam -- all will be dealt with , said Disney Chairman Michael Eisner . There will be a steam train , a Ferris wheel and a roller_coaster too . And with a push of a button , an &quot; audio-animatronic &quot; Bill_Clinton ( or whoever is President in 1998 ) will deliver a speech . All this makes some historians itch . Richard Moe , president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation , mused : &quot; Can George_Washington coexist with Mickey_Mouse ? Can slavery be properly interpreted in an amusement_park ? &quot; These are not questions that plague Haymarket grocer Davis . He was one of the first to capitalize on Disney ' s plans . He printed up T-shirts with the legend , &quot; Haymarket , Virginia -- Just Another Mickey_Mouse Town. &quot; By Christmas , he ' d sold 1 # 200 -- in a town of 483 citizens . Davis estimates that 80 % of Haymarket welcomes Disney , on the grounds that development is inevitable and Disney will bring jobs and prosperity . Even those with doubts , Davis said , hesitate chiefly because they think the company , and not Virginia taxpayers , should pay_for the new roads and sewers that Disney demands . &quot; Something is going_to get the land out here , &quot; he said . &quot; It might as well be Disney . We couldn ' t ask_for a better taxpayer. &quot; Over the mountain , volunteers hand_out bumper stickers that say , &quot; Disney Makes Millions . We Pay Millions , &quot; and another that shows the shield symbol of I-66 and asks , &quot; Disney ' s New Parking Lot ? &quot; I-66 , already congested , carries commuters to Washington , 35 miles away . Blacksmith Putnam bemoans the changes he foresees . &quot; We ' re getting seduced , &quot; he said . &quot; The Plains will no longer be a bucolic little town . we ' ll get the spillover -- maybe not 30 # 000 visitors a day , but we could get 5 # 000 . we ' ll be inundated . And following that will be all_the things people want , gas_stations , motels and , God help us , the fast-food strips. &quot; Disney knew what it was doing when it picked Haymarket . Twenty million tourists a year visit Washington -- exactly the family clientele Disney appeals_to . Most come_by car . Disney plans to lure them west . Unlike Walt Disney World in Orlando , Fla. , which is a vacation destination by itself , the Virginia park is intended to be one day ' s stop in a Washington vacation . It will be only a 10th the size of the Orlando extravaganza , insists Mark Pacala , general_manager of the Virginia project . Disney ' s re-enactments will play_out on historic soil . Long before George_Washington made war on the_British , Haymarket was an important colonial crossroads . When the Civil War broke_out , &quot; Every man but one in Haymarket voted for secession , &quot; said town historian Robert L . Crewdson . &quot; Apparently that man was very nearly mobbed. &quot; Two Civil War battles , the First and Second Battles of Bull_Run , were fought in the_hills nearby . Both were Confederate routs known to Southerners as the battles of Manassas . Later , Union troops sacked Haymarket . Within a day ' s easy drive are other tourist draws -- King ' s Dominion and Busch Gardens , two commercial parks ; and Jamestown , Yorktown and the restored village of Colonial Williamsburg . And thousands of tourists will be pulled to nearby Dulles Airport when the Smithsonian Institution builds a huge air and space museum there to house the B-29 that dropped the first atomic_bomb , a Concorde supersonic transport and the space shuttle Enterprise . Disney expects to welcome as_many as 30 # 000 visitors a day ( in 7 # 500 cars ) , Pacala said , and to reap other profits too . In addition to the 125-acre theme park , it plans a 144-room hotel , a 27-hole golf_course , 2 # 500 homes , and office and retail space . He said the company will invest $ 1 billion in 15 years . &quot; Virginia is open for business , &quot; declared newly installed Gov . George Allen , hailing Disney ' s plans . He asked the Legislature , which is somewhat more wary , for $ 163 million to build a new I-66 interchange , widen roads and provide infrastructure . County taxpayers would have to approve additional millions . Enter the opposition , mostly from the next-door Fauquier County , much of it from the Piedmont Environmental Council , waging a splashy campaign called &quot; Disney -- Take a Second Look. &quot; ( A joke making the rounds , the Fauquier Citizen reported , is that if God wanted to move heaven to Haymarket the PEC would advise , &quot; God -- take a second look. &quot; ) The quality of jobs Disney will bring has become an issue . Disney foresees 12 # 400 new jobs -- 2 # 700 at the park , 3 # 700 at the hotel and other Disney enterprises and the rest spinoff jobs created by the arrival of so many newcomers to the area . But these are mostly low-paying jobs , and the new residents may require government services that will more_than absorb the tax_revenue generated by Disney , opponents say . Many of the same activists succeeded a_few years ago in blocking a regional shopping_center that would have bordered the Manassas battlefield . &quot; We ' re not opposed to a Disney theme park for Virginia , but Haymarket is the wrong place , &quot; said Bob Dennis , president of the environmental council . &quot; It would destabilize a thriving agricultural economy to have a city -- that ' s what is coming -- plopped right down on its edge , in a mixed landscape ranging from cattle_farms and wood lots to highly invested vineyards and horse-breeding facilities , &quot; he said . Disney ' s Pacala attributes the furor to a small core of Virginia ' s landed gentry . &quot; It ' s amazing what money can buy , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
