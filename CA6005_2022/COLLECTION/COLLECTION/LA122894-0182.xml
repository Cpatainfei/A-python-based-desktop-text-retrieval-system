   <HEADLINE> OFFICER CHARGED IN FRIENDLY-FIRE DEATHS SEEKS EXONERATION ; MILITARY : HE SAYS RELEASE OF SECRET INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENT WOULD HELP HIS DEFENSE IN THE MISTAKEN DOWNING OF TWO U.S. HELICOPTERS OVER IRAQ .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Air_Force Capt . Jim Wang , the lone airman ordered to a court-martial in the worst friendly-fire case in recent military history , is spending the holidays in the city where he grew_up , far from the accusations that might ruin his decorated military career . Wang is trying to persuade his superiors to open a secret defense intelligence document that he believes will convince the Air_Force he should not go_to prison . Failing that , he hopes his general court-martial on three criminal counts of dereliction of duty will come swiftly next month . He wants to exonerate himself , to prove to his country and the families of the 26 killed in two Army helicopters over Iraq earlier this year that the deaths were not intentional . Most of all , he wants to walk shoulder-high again with the other five airmen who , after pretrial hearings , were absolved of any criminal wrongdoing in the April 14 tragedy . He doesn ' t believe that he alone should carry the blame . &quot; You wonder whether it could have been prevented , and you know definitely it should have been , &quot; Wang said in an interview in his parents ' Columbus home . &quot; But there were a lot of breakdowns . And in hindsight , there were a lot of people who could have done something to break the chain of events . There were things I could have done , too , had I had the right information. &quot; He was born in Taiwan , the only son of a carpenter . The family immigrated here when he was 2-years-old . He became a naturalized citizen . Just down the street is his old_school , Hamilton High , where he was a star athlete . A thousand miles away -- maybe more , it seems now -- is the U.S. Air_Force_Academy in Colorado , where he went when he left here 10 years ago , full of promise at the start of his military_service . He is soft-spoken and subdued . He appears much younger than his 28 years . The other day , he had to show an ID to buy beer . He could almost pass as the local high_school kid , had he not come_home this time accompanied by his wife , Wendy , their 22-month old son , Jim Jr. , and his deep , sad reflections on what has been a most terrible year . Just across town live John and Linda Garrett , the parents of one of the U.S. servicemen killed in the accident , Army Warrant_Officer 2nd Class John W . Garrett Jr . He , too , was a career military_man , and he was their only child . &quot; I feel sorry he ' s the only one being charged when so many people did so_much wrong , &quot; Linda Garrett said Tuesday . &quot; . . . The Pentagon already said it was a combination of mistakes made by a lot of people. &quot; She has not met Wang , but she would tell him this : &quot; He feels bad he ' s going_to lose his career . But it ' s better to still have your life. &quot; Wang said he feels &quot; very much for the families &quot; who lost loved ones . &quot; But I don ' t feel they should hold this against me , &quot; he said . &quot; Because before this is over , I want to air as_many questions as they do. &quot; Wang graduated from the Air_Force_academy in 1988 with a basic science degree and an emphasis on computers . Almost immediately , he focused his career on radar technology . He joined the special AWACS crews -- the airmen who provide Airborne Warning and Control_System backup to help pilots spot enemy aircraft . He said he has won the Air_Force humanitarian medal , the Southwest Asia service medal and three outstanding unit awards . Just before April , he was accepted into a special instructor school for squadron officers at Tyndall Air_Force Base in Florida . One last assignment was a 35-day duty in_Operation Provide Comfort , which enforces the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone over Iraq . He left the United States on April 10 . The ill-fated mission was his first deployment in Iraq . He was supervising three crew_members aboard an AWACS plane that was flying in support of two F-15 jets enforcing the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone . An hour or so into the flight , he said , his crew &quot; locked_up some contacts on the radar &quot; -- meaning their screens showed what could be enemy aircraft in the &quot; no-fly &quot; area . He and his crew passed that information to the two F-15 pilots , who he said answered that they had identified them as Iraqi Hind helicopters . &quot; that ' s how they called them off , &quot; Wang said . &quot; And from all_the information we had received up_to that time , there was nothing contrary that said they were friendly . We even interrogated them , we asked them if they were friend or foe , and we didn ' t receive any return. &quot; Both pilots fired , each of them blowing a helicopter out of the air . &quot; They followed their own rules of engagement , and there was no requirement for them to come_back to us for a second opinion or for permission to fire , &quot; he said . Initially , Wang said , he believed the pilots fired defensively . He heard the pilots radio &quot; Splash one Hind &quot; followed by &quot; Splash second Hind. &quot; The AWACS crew flew for another 11 hours , but within 30 minutes Wang began to worry something had gone_wrong . He was told to help direct search and rescue operations , something that would n ' t be done for a downed enemy aircraft . Then he heard radio transmissions reporting that the F-15s had shot down two Army Blackhawk helicopters carrying military_personnel and civilians . &quot; It was unbelievable , &quot; he said . &quot; Nobody on board the AWACS plane wanted to believe that . It was so silent . Then everybody kept saying , ' No way could that have happened. ' &quot; In September , Wang and five other airmen were named in various criminal charges . One of the F-15 pilots was accused of 26 counts of negligent homicide . But Wang eventually learned that he alone would be court-martialed , while the rest would be exonerated . Wang has been charged with failing to supervise his radar controllers , failing to maintain a &quot; current and accurate &quot; radar picture of his area of responsibility and failing to make_sure the pilots knew there were Army helicopters in the area . If convicted , he faces a maximum of three months in prison on each of the three counts , a garnishing of his wages , and possible discharge from the service . His attorney , Air_Force Maj . Donald P . Holtz , said he learned recently of a secret National Security Agency report that , if revealed , could provide evidence that would clear Wang . The exact nature of the information is not known , but so far , military authorities have refused to turn the document over , saying it is not relevant . &quot; To court-martial Capt . Wang for this tragedy would not only be grossly unfair , &quot; Holtz said , &quot; but would subject the United States Air_Force to public scorn and the ridicule of the American people. &quot;</TEXT>
