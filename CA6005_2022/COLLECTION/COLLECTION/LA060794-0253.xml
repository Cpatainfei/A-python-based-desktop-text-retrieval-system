   <HEADLINE> PACIFIC RIM TRADE ; ASIAN DYNAMISM FILLS AN OCEAN OF COMMERCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They steam out of West Coast ports every day , an average of 26 ships carrying 3 # 000 tons of cargo each , from tiny computer chips to gigantic earthmovers for buyers in China , Japan and other nations of the vast East Asian market . On their return trips to America , the ships are laden with 5 # 000 tons each of cheap Chinese clothing , top-of-the-line Japanese computers and a bounty of consumer goods in between . The imbalance in tonnage reflects the stubborn U.S. trade_deficit with Asia . The Pacific_Ocean and the sky above it have become the modern equivalent of the storied Silk_Road , the overland route from the Orient to Europe that carried East-West trade_in ancient times . As early as the 2nd Century BC , Romans were wearing garments made of Chinese silk , and the Chinese were burning oil in lamps imported from Rome . Camels carried the freight . Now the routes of commerce are infinitely more complex . &quot; When traced on a map , a vast network of air and ocean shipping routes , supported by threadlike communication links , forms a cat ' s cradle of Pacific Basin interconnections , &quot; says Mark Borthwick , American executive_director of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council , a 21-nation organization based in Singapore . The U.S.-Japan link is the principal transpacific route , but just one of many . Of every $ 10 worth of U.S. trade with the Orient , Japan accounts_for $ 4 . China , looming as an economic giant , now accounts_for $ 1 in every $ 10 of U.S.-Asian commerce , and its trade with the United States has doubled in just three years . Taiwan , South_Korea , Singapore and Hong Kong are not far behind . &quot; It ' s easier to think_about the United States and Japan , rather than an extremely complex matrix in which it is important to think_about three-way , four-way and five-way trade , &quot; Borthwick notes . While trade between the United States and East Asia is growing rapidly , trade among East Asian_nations is growing faster still . In 1993 , the value of international trade within East Asia surpassed that between East Asia and the United States . Coal from New Zealand is shipped to Taiwan , where it fuels a furnace that turns_out sheets of automotive steel . The steel is purchased by the Nissan Motor Co . and sent to Japan or , perhaps , Thailand , Malaysia or the Philippines . There , it is pressed into the shape of a station_wagon , the AD Resort , in production in each of the four countries , with parts made throughout the region . &quot; We are a country with global interests , &quot; says Jeffrey E . Garten , U.S. undersecretary of commerce for international affairs . &quot; Power and wealth are shifting to the Pacific , and we want to participate in that growth . This is another frontier for the United States . &quot; American commerce once looked_to the taming of the West and the development of cities up and down the Pacific Coast as the growth story . They are now turning_to the countries of Asia in the late 20th Century . The benefits will be measured in a more vibrant U.S. economy. &quot; America ' s Role Such involvement gives the United States a role in Asia based on more_than the presence of its military , he said . In effect , economic ties become a common thread , along with shared values and political goals , weaving individual countries into a community of nations . President Clinton last month left no doubt about how much U.S. economic links to East Asia mean to him . Reversing the position he advocated during the election campaign and his first year in office , Clinton renewed China ' s privileged trading status with the United States despite Beijing ' s continuing record of what he called &quot; very serious human_rights abuses. &quot; Now that Washington is no longer bound to Asia by a strategic relationship built_on containment of the Soviet_Union , it must compete for influence along the Pacific Rim on the basis of economic power . And it must face the prospects of greater friction , not just between itself and Japan but between Japan and Asian_nations no longer willing to be Japan ' s economic puppets . Entrepreneurial spirit is blossoming in East Asia : in Malaysia , whose trade with the United States has nearly doubled in three years ; in China , which is systematically unshackling markets that had been hamstrung by communism ; even in Vietnam , which is establishing initial diplomatic links with Washington two decades after the American military withdrew from its disastrous involvement there . It is an atmosphere in which the titans of Asian industry flourish . Kim Woo Choong has built South_Korea ' s Daewoo industrial conglomerate into a world-class colossus . Taiwan ' s Y.F. Chang began his working life as an apprentice sailor and now owns one of the world ' s largest container shipping fleets . From his base in Hong Kong , Li Ka-shing ( net worth : $ 3.5 billion ) controls an industrial empire whose tentacles extend_to Europe and North_America . Changing Patterns Beyond merely generating wealth , they are influencing the political and social development of their region , sometimes in surprising ways : * Even as increasing contact between the United States and Asia opens the door to a greater awareness of each others ' cultures , economic independence is leading to a political confidence that allows Asian_countries , many of them former colonial territories , to stand_up to Western pressures . So the onetime British colony of Singapore can ignore , without apology , U.S._government protests over the caning of a young American offender . * The traditional pattern of trade that moved mostly on an east-west axis is shifting . Transpacific commerce is huge and growing , but north-south routes are developing rapidly , with products and parts moving throughout East Asia and the United States playing little or no role in much of the process . * But the need for highways , for bridges , for sophisticated communications networks -- those developments known as infrastructure -- that will allow the easier transport of goods and ideas in Asia presents a huge opportunity for U.S. firms . Bechtel International and Motorola have found a profitable market in this field , establishing a base that could pay_off for years to come . Similarly , Boeing is busily supplying the region with new airplanes , and with them a toehold for parts and maintenance work in years ahead . &quot; The location of the telegraph_lines and railroads influenced the patterns of communication , the economic flows and how integration took_place &quot; in the American West of the 19th Century , Robert B . Zoellick , undersecretary of state for economic affairs in the George_Bush Administration , said in a speech last fall . &quot; Today , in the Pacific , we are determining where the airline routes go , what telecommunication_systems we will use , what languages people will speak , where students will study and many other questions that will set patterns of future interaction . It is in the interests of America and of Asia that the U.S. turn_out to be a key part of this ' infrastructure. ' &quot; * While low-skilled , poorly paid Asian workers are still turning_out running_shoes , plastic toys and inexpensive clothing , the notion that Asia offers little more_than raw_materials , a cheap production platform and factories spewing cars and televisions and VCRs is more_than a decade out of date . Now it is home to stock_markets , computer companies and heavy industry employing educated and motivated workers -- in short , a complete economic food_chain . &quot; In many circumstances , companies went_to Asia to take_advantage of low wages . Now , they stay there , and more companies come_in , to take_advantage of very talented , highly educated , knowledgeable workers , scientists , design engineers , for the up-market production , &quot; said Robert Hormats , vice_chairman of the investment_firm of Goldman , Sachs International . Technical Edge Singapore is producing approximately half of the world ' s computer disk_drives . Malaysia is the world ' s third-largest producer of semiconductors . Indonesia , which 12 years ago depended_on oil sales for 80 % of its export earnings , now has a diversified manufacturing economy , with oil representing only one-third of its exports . &quot; Contrary to conventional wisdom , you are looking_at countries that are seeking to get_at the cutting edge of technology . They are no longer the Nike shoe boys , &quot; said William T . Archey , former international vice_president of the U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce , who is teaching a graduate course in global trade relations at George Mason University in northern Virginia . A massive middle_class is emerging : educated workers commanding higher salaries that , in turn , can raise living standards and create a consumer market for U.S. farmers to feed . Not even counting Japan , &quot; there will be some 75 million households in Asia with incomes comparable_to those earned by middle-income Americans &quot; within six years , U.S. Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said recently . The evidence was readily apparent to Bentsen during a recent tour of the region : skyscrapers sprouting from the sprawling landscape of Shanghai ; satellite dishes perched on Beijing rooftops ; vertical shopping_malls beckoning shoppers in Indonesia . Problems Persist But this is no utopia . There are also great social and economic disparities that make some corners of Asia unattractive at many levels : the seamy world of the Bangkok sex shops , the polluted skyline of Jakarta and the often authoritarian political regimes that predominate even as democracy gains a foothold . &quot; It ' s growth without development &quot; contends James Fallows , author of &quot; Looking_at the Sun , &quot; a study of Asian capitalism and the challenge it poses to the United States . &quot; The question is whether they will develop a capacity for sustained development. &quot; Nevertheless , politically , Asia ' s economic development is exposing a region with a tradition of authoritarian government to the values of Western political thought . &quot; The economic integration has political overtones , &quot; said Zoellick , the former Bush_Administration official . &quot; If you have economic liberty , it tends to be associated with political_liberty . It tends to be associated with the development of a middle_class . This roughly shared value system is a form of security . People will tend to have similar views of issues if they share political systems. &quot; With the advent of satellites and faxes , computers and modems , and the increased contact accompanying increased trade , &quot; it is impossible for governments to control thinking , &quot; said Garten , the Commerce_Department undersecretary . &quot; This makes the relationship between trade and politics quantitatively different from anything we have known. &quot;</TEXT>
