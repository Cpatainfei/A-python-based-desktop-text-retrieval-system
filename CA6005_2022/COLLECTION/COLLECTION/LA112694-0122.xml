   <HEADLINE> FOR THE HOMELESS , SOME UNORTHODOX SUCCESS ; SHELTERS : PASADENA ' S PILOT_PROGRAM DISCARDS TOUGH LOVE APPROACH , BLENDING INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT WITH GREATER AUTONOMY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For months , 26-year-old Francoise Parker and nine other homeless people had slept under a rickety , tent-like encampment at Pasadena ' s Memorial Park , eking out a sorry living recycling cans and bottles . Then one day in April they were persuaded to leave the park for a converted church hall -- and a surprisingly dramatic transformation began for most of them . Within 45 days , three of the 10 had found housing . Within six months , seven had moved_into an apartment , rental house or were staying with a friend . ( The remaining three went_back to the streets ) . Six had applied for work or found jobs . Four had enrolled in -- and later completed -- residential drug rehabilitation_programs . Each had obtained valid California identification . Their lifeline was a $ 15 # 000 , city-funded pilot_program aimed at quickly turning_around the lives of the chronically homeless by giving them a remarkable degree of personal autonomy in a group shelter . The Pasadena program turned the traditional homeless shelter notion of tough love on its head . It left it up_to the individual to show_up for counseling sessions , go_to_bed at a reasonable hour and stop drinking or using drugs . Rule breakers -- who in most shelters are kicked_out or lose privileges such_as telephone use -- were left to deal with their own conscience and asked to focus_on individual responsibility . The lesson , sponsors say , is that flexibility makes_it easier to attract the hard-core homeless to shelter programs , and grooms them to carry_on their own lives once they leave . &quot; ( Other programs ) really don ' t treat you like adults , &quot; Francoise Parker said . &quot; They treat you like kids , like you don ' t have a mind or opinion of_your_own , that you ' re really not capable of doing anything by yourself , that you always have to be guided by the hand. &quot; The numbers of people who succeeded in the pilot_program &quot; are some of the best I ' ve heard , &quot; said USC geography professor Michael Dear , author of &quot; Malign Neglect , &quot; a book on homelessness in Los Angeles . However , the gains came at a high price . In many bigger programs , homeless advocates say , one case manager might have to juggle 15 clients or more . By contrast , Pasadena had six case managers for the 10 homeless people . In addition , one social_services agency agreed to pay the first and last month ' s rent for those who found housing . &quot; I ' ve never seen anything -- in this region at least -- so intense , with the hand-holding aspect of it , &quot; said Ruth Schwartz , executive_director of Shelter Partnership , a countywide nonprofit organization that works with groups that serve the homeless . Pasadena city officials began their plan to move the homeless people from Memorial Park in response to numerous complaints and a local theater group ' s request to use the stage for rehearsals . First , social_service providers had to persuade park regulars to clear_out for good and move_into the church hall . In exchange , they offered a promise : This program would be different from all_the others that the participants had turned their backs on . The targets were people who had been_on the streets for four years or more and could not abide_by the simplest of rules_in a traditional shelter , said Joseph Colletti , director of Lutheran Social_Services in Pasadena , which coordinated the project with three other agencies . The program was helped not just by the high number of case managers , but by the fact that the park group had already lived together like a family . They had stuck_together through the worst of times , sleeping under the graceful arc of Memorial Park ' s Art Deco band shell in the heart of the city , their encampment strung together with overturned shopping_carts , rope and canvas . Parker , the only woman in the group , had started running_away at age 12 after endless fights with her mother . She started to use drugs and alcohol regularly , and was_on and off the streets for years . She got_married , but her husband was jailed on a parole violation and she did not want to stay in his grandmother ' s house anymore . So in December , 1993 , she started sleeping at Memorial Park . There , she whiled away the days drunk -- on beer or vodka -- or high on crack cocaine . She tried to ignore the way passersby averted their eyes . Parker , who is 6-foot-1 , countered by dressing defiantly , in tight bike shorts and crop tops that clung to her bony body . She cursed up a storm , spitting_out angry words . And she carried a hammer to protect her self-esteem more_than anything else , ready to strike at the smallest of slights . Parker scoffed when social_workers came_to the park , promising a quick program to get her off the streets . She had tried four other longer recovery programs and either quit or got kicked_out . But everyone else was packing it up for the park relocation program , so she went too . Case managers asked participants to set the rules ; no one told them what to do . The group decided to set an 11 p.m. curfew -- but latecomers would not be punished -- and share cleaning chores . Everything else was up_to the individual . Nobody nagged them to go_to 12-step meetings , nobody reminded them that they should use the free phone to check on job openings . In other programs , Parker ' s schedule was dictated minute by minute , from 5:45 a.m. to 5 p.m. In one program , she could not have a radio , and her telephone privileges were restricted . In another , she could not talk to male participants . In still another , she was not allowed to leave the building for 14 days . And in all_the programs , any major rule violation -- such_as falling_off the wagon -- meant that she was shown the door . One night , Parker rolled into the Pasadena shelter at 2 a.m. after a night of drinking beer and smoking marijuana . The next morning , she confessed to a case manager . &quot; How are you feeling ? &quot; the case manager joked . There was no lecture , only : &quot; Are you sure that ' s something you want to do ? &quot; That marked a turning point for Parker , whose guard came_down . &quot; If I want to ( make progress ) , let me do_it at my pace , &quot; Parker said . &quot; Just don ' t steadily keep cramming me with ( lectures ) , because the more you cram me with it . . . I ' m going_to look the other way , and I ' m going_to do what I want to do . . . . Let me gradually get_it a little at a time. &quot; Parker ' s husband , 32-year-old Samuel McWhorter , joined the Memorial Park program when he got_out of jail , replacing one person who had dropped_out . Six months later , the couple had rented a room in a house with four roommates . Parker had completed a three-month substance_abuse recovery program . She got a maintenance job with the city of Pasadena ' s parks department , adding income to her husband ' s job as a construction worker . She gained 50 pounds and sometimes wears dresses or skirts . Now her speech is measured and if she slips_up and swears , she says : &quot; Pardon my French. &quot; The no-rules concept is rare but picking_up speed in social_services circles , said Dear of USC . The Pasadena program is the first that Dear knows of in the nation to use the maximum flexibility concept . The city of Los Angeles is planning to open a $ 4-million drop-in center in the industrial zone east of Downtown using the same policy ; it could be running in about two years . According to the city ' s proposal , the center would have only minimum health and safety rules_in a setting &quot; that respects human dignity and does not feel oppressive or institutional. &quot; Shelters and recovery programs have to impose rules and structure in_order to manage huge groups of people and keep them on track , said USC religion professor Donald Miller , author of &quot; Homeless Families : The Struggle for Dignity. &quot; But too many rules can backfire . &quot; It strikes me that what Pasadena was able to do is put an enormous amount of resources in intervening in the lives of a small number of individuals , &quot; Miller said . &quot; Having the freedom to do that allowed them to relate to people in much more adult ways , and in honoring the people that they were dealing with , they empowered them to be responsible adults. &quot; In the Memorial Park program , case managers were crucial . Parker ' s managers helped her track_down her birth_certificate from Frankfurt , Germany , and clear a_couple_of warrants for drinking in public . In addition , a case manager used contacts to help get the city maintenance job and find her the room to rent . Another took her shopping for basics , such_as an alarm_clock . Even now , almost six months after the program ended , Parker calls one of her case managers almost daily . &quot; Each thing represented another breakthrough , &quot; Colletti said . Eventually , besides Parker and her husband , three people found work -- two in the delivery department of a local newspaper , and one as a restaurant janitor . Six others receive disability income or are unemployed . Case managers are happy enough with their numbers to plan another project , tentatively set to begin in February . The new project will target chronically homeless women . Longtime homeless women , who are commonly assaulted on the street , tend to shy_away_from traditional social_service programs , Colletti said . Parker started off that way . Now , she lives_in a drafty room , with old sheets covering the windows and an empty dresser drawer spilling over with bread , peanut_butter and boxes of macaroni_and_cheese . &quot; It ' s privacy , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s mine. &quot;</TEXT>
