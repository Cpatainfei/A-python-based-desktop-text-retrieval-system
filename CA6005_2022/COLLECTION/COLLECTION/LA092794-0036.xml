   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVES ON COURTROOM TELEVISION ; CAMERAS ENSURE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE ; ONE DISPUTED REPORT ISN ' T WORTH THE RISK OF CUTTING ALL DIRECT ACCESS TO A TRIAL AS CONTROVERSIAL AS SIMPSON ' S .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito has guided the O . J . Simpson murder trial into jury selection under a cloud with profound implications for freedom_of_the_press and the public ' s right of access to its justice system . On Friday , Ito again castigated alleged inaccurate reporting by television_station KNBC , about a story linking a sock found in O . J . Simpson ' s bedroom to the slain Nicole Brown Simpson . Ito and others have called the story grossly inaccurate . The story may or may_not be accurate ; it may_not be the most responsible report ever broadcast in Los Angeles . However , its accuracy -- or the judgment involved in broadcasting it -- is not the real question here . Ito has served notice that he intends to hold a hearing this week on terminating all electronic media coverage of the trial . Not only is this proposed punishment unrelated to the media ' s alleged violation , but it poses serious legal and practical problems . Ito has a legitimate -- indeed , critical -- interest in seeing that Simpson receives a fair trial . But the judge knew that when , on Aug . 2 , he entered an order specifically allowing television_cameras in his courtroom and setting ground_rules for broadcasters to place cameras elsewhere in the Criminal_Courts Building . Absolutely nothing has happened in the past two months to indicate that those initial findings -- that electronic coverage would not impair Simpson ' s fair trial rights -- were wrong . Indeed , over the past weekend , even members of Simpson ' s defense_team publicly opposed ending electronic courtroom coverage . From the perspective of public policy as well , such a decision would make no sense . First , pulling the plug would not address Ito ' s complaint with KNBC , which based its story not on events in the courtroom but on information obtained from confidential sources outside . It is illogical to impose in-court punitive measures when out-of-court practices have enraged the judge . In the media world of the late 20th Century , television_cameras are no different from the pencils and note pads of newspaper reporters . Television is a unique medium , effective because it brings_to its audience the faces , inflections and words of its sources . To deny television_camera access to the trial is to bar the public from witnessing the proceedings -- in a system of justice that the people pay_for and in which the people must have confidence . If anything , the frequency of stories like KNBC ' s disputed report will only increase under the action contemplated by Ito . The reality is that in-court proceedings become the news_story on days when court is in session ; they also act_as a check on the mainstream media ' s need or desire to conduct independent investigations . The ultimate irony of Ito ' s position is that the very existence of electronic media coverage of the Simpson trial serves to limit or eliminate any damage that otherwise prejudicial information might cause . His nationally televised condemnations of KNBC ' s story have more_than fully mitigated whatever damage may have been done_by the original report . As a practical matter , limiting television coverage from the courtroom would work a hardship on all news media , since most reporters covering the trial rely_on the live television feed as a practical alternative to crowding into a courtroom far too small to accommodate them . Reports prepared by those excluded from the courtroom would inevitably be less reliable and accurate . The importance of assuring the public that the Simpson trial is fair and open_to public scrutiny is paramount . Nothing will guarantee that outcome with greater certainty than continuing to afford the nation an electronic eye and ear into Ito ' s courtroom .</TEXT>
