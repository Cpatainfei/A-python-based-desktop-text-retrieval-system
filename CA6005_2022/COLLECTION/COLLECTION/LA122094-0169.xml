   <HEADLINE> JAPANESE SAW EARLY SCRIPTS FOR A-BOMB EXHIBIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Smithsonian Institution allowed Japanese officials an early glimpse at scripts for a much-disputed exhibit on the atomic bombing of Japan in 1945 , Rep . Sam Johnson ( R-Tex. ) said Monday . Johnson provided minutes from a July 5 , 1994 , Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum senior staff meeting that indicate communications with Japan over the script for &quot; The Last Act : The Atomic Bomb And The End Of World_War II. &quot; The minutes read : &quot; The Japanese version of ' The Last Act ' script has been Federal Expressed to Japan , asking_for a quick response. &quot; Air and Space Museum spokesman Mike Fetters acknowledged that at least three versions of the script were sent to city officials in Nagasaki and Hiroshima . But Fetters denied that the Japanese were allowed to make any changes . Johnson still questioned the propriety of the Smithsonian ' s actions , saying the institution was allowing the Japanese input that it didn ' t provide to U.S. veterans groups .</TEXT>
