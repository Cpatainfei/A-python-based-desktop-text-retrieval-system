   <HEADLINE> THE BIG HOUSE THAT DON NOVEY BUILT ; WORKING THE PR , SPREADING BIG BUCKS , A CANNY UNION BOSS DEMANDS MORE PRISONS AND TOP PAY FOR HIS GUARDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> John Denning is carrying an assault_rifle again . He hadn ' t planned to . After serving as a combat Marine in Vietnam , Denning had hoped to make a living carrying nothing more lethal than a blackboard pointer . To that end , he earned an elementary-school teaching credential at Cal State Chico . But an interesting thing happened on his way to a classroom job : Denning learned that he could make a lot more money guarding the state ' s prisoners than he could teaching California ' s children . And unlike the available teaching position , the prison job would be_full time . So the tall , easygoing Denning holds a 9-millimeter Heckler and Koch rifle as he scans a bank of prison_cells arrayed in a semicircle before his control booth . He is_on duty at Mule Creek State_Prison in Northern California ' s Gold Country , one of 15 new penitentiaries opened in the past decade to house the state ' s mushrooming convict population . After five years in uniform , Denning was earning $ 14 # 000 a year more_than he would have as a teacher in Chico . And he could have saved himself the time , trouble and expense of a college education . California prison_guards need only a high_school diploma to qualify for a job that starts at $ 27 # 432 per year , jumps to $ 36 # 768 after two years and tops out at $ 44 # 676 after six years , approximately what a CHP traffic officer makes after a similar period . &quot; It was good when I started , but it ' s much better now , &quot; Denning says . Good salaries and other benefits for state_prison guards did not simply drop_out of the sky . They are the result of the shrewd leadership of one of_their_own -- a former guard -- and a multibillion-dollar prison construction program that created a growing demand for guards . Don Novey , the 46-year-old president of the California Correctional Peace_Officers Assn. , is known for his hard-nosed bargaining , tough-guy demeanor , belief in professionalism and a flair for PR . Novey wears a fedora , talks basic law and order and cultivates a bombastic Jimmy Hoffa image . But in interviews , the mustached , pink-cheeked union chief , a fifth-generation Californian , is soft-spoken and cautious about what he says . Novey doesn ' t possess high-voltage academic credentials -- he has an associate of arts degree from American River College in Sacramento -- but he is intelligent and erudite . Novey knows , for example , what Dostoevsky had to say about prison conditions , that they reflect society ' s values . He is a family_man , with a wife of 23 years and three children . He speaks Polish and German and is learning Spanish . His office radio is tuned to a classical-music station . And he has learned how to tune into California ' s channels of power . Novey has taken a small , listless public employees union and forged it into one of the most powerful political organizations in the state . He and the guards union pour millions of dollars into political_campaign coffers . And , to the dismay of critics , they get results . For instance , the union helped put Republican Pete Wilson in the governor ' s office in 1990 , spending nearly $ 1 million . In 1992 -- the most recent year for which data is available -- the union ' s political_action_committee contributions to candidates were topped only by those from the powerhouse California Medical Assn . And the guards ' largess wasn ' t restricted to Republicans that year . Its $ 60 # 000 contribution to the war_chest of Democrat Willie Brown , the flamboyant and influential speaker of the Assembly , was the seventh-largest during his ' 92 reelection race . The $ 1 million total to political_campaigns in 1992 was only slightly more_than the $ 992 # 000 handed_out to politicians by the California Teachers Union , according to California Common Cause , which advocates campaign finance reform . But the guards , outnumbered 10 to 1 by the teachers , know how to get a better bang for their buck . Common Cause says that the correctional officers ' massive contributions have given them far too_much power for a group of state employees . &quot; They can exert this incredible influence to make_sure they come_out ahead in the salary game , &quot; maintains executive_director Ruth Holton . &quot; Why should one group of state employees have so_much more influence than others simply because they happen to give more ? &quot; Adds Vince Schiraldi , executive_director of the Center_on Juvenile and Criminal Justice , an organization that advocates alternatives to prison : &quot; Why should we have the best-paid correctional officer staff in the country and not the best-paid teachers , professors , health-care workers and social_service staff ? It just proves that when the ( guards union ) said , ' Jump , ' the Legislature and the governor said , ' How high ? ' &quot; Novey scoffs at such complaints , and needles the press for repeating them . &quot; I ' ve never seen the media attack the California Medical Assn. , Arco , the California Trial_Lawyers Assn . when they ' re doing the big spend , &quot; he says . &quot; But once the little blue-collar worker gets_up to the plate , everyone gets antsy. &quot; IT IS AN EERIE SCENE : SEVEN HUNDRED WHITE COFFINS , EACH BEARING A red rose , are arranged row upon row on the lush grass next to the Capitol building in Sacramento . Several dozen people are seated on folding_chairs adjacent to the coffins . A color_guard of uniformed officers from the California Youth Authority reformatory at Preston marches down an aisle through the chairs . In front of the gathering are several speakers , including Atty . Gen . Daniel Lungren and , wearing the ever-present fedora , Don Novey . The audience is from an organization of crime victims ' families and the cardboard coffins represent California murder victims . This annual ceremony is sponsored by Novey ' s California Correctional Peace_Officers Assn . It is only coincidental that , at dawn that spring day , Robert Alton Harris was executed in the gas_chamber at San Quentin State_Prison , the state ' s first execution in 25 years . Lungren , a conservative law-and-order advocate , is subdued in his manner and remarks . He and Novey had been at the execution and look tired . But when Novey speaks , he is anything but subdued . He acknowledges that witnessing the execution was &quot; difficult , &quot; but hastens to add , &quot; The only thing I felt sorry_for is that we had an open chair and I damn well would have liked to see Charlie Manson sitting in it alongside Robert Harris. &quot; Then Novey describes Harris ' death as though it had been an electrocution . &quot; Extra crispy &quot; is his flip comment . Novey knows that the folks in front of him are not in a reflective mood . He knows they have just had a taste of vengeance and that it is their day to exult . Novey knows his audience . After all , it was he who helped create groups like this with funds from his union . It is good public relations for the union to support victims-rights groups and to espouse their causes , Novey knows , because he realized early on that California ' s prison_guards could not ascend to real power on their numbers and dues alone . They also needed an image . When Novey , fresh out of the Army , first walked through the medievally turreted East Gate of century-old Folsom Prison to work as a guard in 1971 , he and his fellow officers were scorned by the public as lowly turnkeys . They didn ' t have proper uniforms , much less a training academy . &quot; We ' d come_in cold , &quot; he recalls . &quot; They ' d hand you a set of keys and you were_on your own. &quot; At some prisons , the rate of guard turnover was higher than 40 % every two years . After nine years as a guard at Folsom , Novey was convinced he could change the status of correctional officers . &quot; I saw a group of people who were trying to do something right , but they were running_into each other , &quot; he says of the union . &quot; It just disturbed me. &quot; So he got himself elected president and hasn ' t lost a reelection yet . At the time , recalls Novey , &quot; It was just a good old_boys club. &quot; There were 2 # 000 members , the treasury held $ 25 # 000 and the organization operated out of a rented office . The top salary for guards was $ 21 # 000 a year . Now there are 23 # 000 members in the union , including parole officers and medical technicians . Guard salaries have more_than doubled since 1980 , while monthly dues of $ 35 bring_in around $ 9.5 million per year . Those funds were used to help build a $ 3-million Sacramento headquarters , a gleaming blue and white building with a large archway over the entrance and a grand staircase leading to Novey ' s comfortable , but by no means plush , office . There he works constantly to polish the guards ' image . It is a nasty business , going behind prison walls each day to keep others under lock and key . And it ' s an ironic calling , since those who do_it become imprisoned themselves . Guards suffer long periods of numbing boredom , broken by instances of terror . And even now they generally get only slightly more respect than those they watch . Sometimes less . Almost everyone else in the criminal justice system gets a share of glamour : cops , prosecutors , defense_attorneys , judges . In films , even convicts are depicted as colorful guys played by the_likes_of James Cagney and Clint Eastwood . So Novey and his top staff spend about $ 500 # 000 a year on public relations . Union leaders insist that guards be called correctional officers . And Novey coined a slogan for their job : &quot; the toughest beat_in the state. &quot; Union_representatives hand_out &quot; Tough Teddy &quot; stuffed bears to kids during goodwill visits to hospitals . But , in fact , prison work is not the toughest beat_in the state . A Los Angeles police_officer , for example , is far more likely to be killed on_the_job than a prison_guard . During the past 30 years , 13 prison_guards were killed . During the same period , the Los Angeles Police_Department -- which is only about half the size of the prison_guard force of 14 # 000-plus -- lost 63 officers in the line_of_duty . that ' s the reality , but in the state Capitol , it ' s often the image that counts . &quot; Ask any legislator in Sacramento , &quot; Novey says with a laugh . &quot; They say , ' Here they come , &quot; The toughest beat_in the state. &quot; ' &quot; But a legislative aide who asked not to be identified disagrees . Prison_guards want to consider themselves cops and be able to do cop-type things , like carry concealed weapons off-duty . &quot; They ' re big-time wanna-bes , &quot; he says with a sneer . Indeed , guard training is inferior to that of many police_departments . The six-week paramilitary course that new guards must complete offers classes ranging from report writing to hostage survival . But its six-week duration pales in comparison to the 6 1 / 2 months required by the LAPD . Nevertheless , the union ' s track record under Novey has been remarkable . It helped establish a training academy in Northern California for guards and set_up a lobbying office in Washington to push for national training standards for correctional officers . And benefits have certainly improved under Novey . Like most peace_officers , for example , guards receive significantly better retirement_benefits than other civil_servants , such_as better pensions at an earlier age . NOVEY IS NOT HESITANT TO REWARD FRIENDS AND PUNISH ENEMIES IN the state Legislature in his pursuit of improving the welfare of his guards . Dave Elder , former Democratic assemblyman from Long_Beach , frequently carried legislation on behalf of the union , including a bill to improve retirement_benefits . The guards showed their appreciation by giving him $ 114 # 000 in campaign contributions from 1987 to 1992 . At times , Novey ' s method of building political influence is as subtle as the siren at Folsom Prison . Six years ago , for example , the union created a furor when it handed_out personal gifts of $ 10 # 000 each to three politicians for their work in the state Legislature . One was Sen . Robert Presley ( D-Riverside ) , chairman of the Joint Committee on Prison Construction and Operations . Presley says he considered the money an overly generous speaking fee . Another beneficiary was then-Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier ( R-Encinitas ) , who left her sickbed to vote_in favor of locating a prison in Los Angeles . The third check went_to then-Sen H.L. Richardson ( R-Glendora ) , well-known for his support of police and gun owners . Such personal gifts to state lawmakers have since been banned , but legal campaign contributions by the guards continue . The union gave more_than $ 3 million to political_campaigns in California from 1987 to 1992 . And those who cross the guards can face retaliation . Take John Vasconcellos . The veteran Democratic assemblyman from Santa Clara has liberal ideas on crime and punishment , but he did , nevertheless , receive $ 7 # 250 from the guards between 1987 and 1990 . Then Vasconcellos co-authored the ballot argument against a $ 450-million prison construction bond issue in 1990 . Voters rejected the bonds , and the guards , in return , bankrolled the campaign of Vasconcellos ' opponent , Tim Jeffries , in the Assembly race two years later . Vasconcellos won the election , but the union ' s $ 81 # 000 donation to Jeffries made what should have been a walkover a closer contest . &quot; I think it contaminates the system , &quot; Vasconcellos says of the union ' s methods . &quot; People who do that think they can muscle the system. &quot; The guards have indeed muscled the system into making prisons a sacred_cow , contends Kim Alexander , former policy analyst for California Common Cause . &quot; That kind of campaign funding has a chilling effect on the rest of the Legislature , &quot; she says . The chill has frozen_out any serious consideration by Sacramento lawmakers of alternatives to building more prisons , reformers insist . &quot; What you ' ve got is a powerful interest_group invested in the status_quo , &quot; a system built around prisons , says Barry Krisberg , president of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency , a criminal justice research organization based in San Francisco . &quot; Change becomes difficult when every legislator is looking over their shoulder to see how this in-group is going_to stand on their next election. &quot; Krisberg ' s organization and others aren ' t convinced that prisons are the answer . They advocate alternatives such_as intensely supervised parole programs for violent offenders and no parole supervision for lesser offenders , community corrections facilities and revised sentencing guidelines . Krisberg also advocates privately run prisons , which have been used sparingly in the state and are militantly opposed by the guards union . Novey responds , tongue in cheek , that guards , too , are interested in reforms such_as shorter sentences to reduce the prison population : &quot; We ' ve advocated for shorter sentences for a heinous crime : murder . We want state executions for Murder 1. &quot; Not only the Legislature , but the governor , too , is chummy with Novey and the union leadership , critics say . Sometimes that relationship gets too close even for the union membership . Novey angered his rank_and_file as well as that of other state labor organizations in 1991 when he promised Gov . Wilson that his members would take a 5 % pay_cut . But Novey subsequently helped to drive a bargain with the Administration that allowed the guards to recoup wage reductions months before other civil_servants who had taken a pay_cut . State Sen . Alfred E . Alquist ( D-San Jose ) contends that Wilson is so beholden to the guards that he insisted last year ' s state budget contain increased funds for prison operations while all other departments suffered cuts . Alquist co-authored with Vasconcellos the 1990 ballot argument against prison bonds . Wilson responds that his decision to increase the prisons ' budget during the state ' s financial crisis had nothing to do with the guards ' political clout . And he stuck_to his guns in his January budget proposals for this coming fiscal_year . He recommended a 10 % boost in the prison budget , about $ 335 million , and the hiring of 3 # 215 new guards to handle an anticipated 7 % increase in the inmate population . Wilson also proposed a $ 2-billion bond issue to build six new prisons , subject_to voter approval on the June or November ballot this year . Filling_out his anti-crime package , which critics say is spurred by his reelection bid this year , Wilson supports the &quot; three-strikes-and-you ' re-out &quot; proposal , which would mandate life sentences to some repeat offenders . His enthusiasm has overreached even some of his key GOP allies , who oppose adding_to the state ' s debt load . &quot; We are unanimously opposed to any bonds for any reason , &quot; insists Senate Republican leader Ken Maddy of Fresno . For his part , Novey argues that the guards union wants more prisons to relieve dangerous overcrowding , not to create more guard jobs . &quot; All we want is access and the ability to explain our position , &quot; he says . &quot; We ' re not going_to run_out there and demand that you pass a bill. &quot; He proclaims with a note of piety : &quot; My goal in life -- and we ' ll never achieve it -- is for this profession not to exist . It ' s a sad reflection of our society that we have crime out there. &quot; WHEN DON NOVEY STARTED WORK_AT FOLSOM 23 YEARS AGO , IT WAS AN era of bloody prison uprisings . Convicts like George Jackson and the Soledad Brothers made headlines and California ' s prison system became notorious . &quot; They were killing officers right and left , &quot; Novey says of the inmates of that time . New officers weren ' t issued standard uniforms and , as a result , they stood_out like the vulnerable green hands they were , he says . &quot; It sort of identified you as fish bait to the inmates. &quot; After a nine-month probation , guards were allowed to wear regular olive-colored uniforms , but the outfits didn ' t include badges or state_Department of Corrections arm patches , as they do now . Novey ' s ascendancy to chief of the guards ' union took_place as California embarked_on an unprecedented prison-building program . In 1982 , there were 12 state_prisons and 6 # 300 guards . Twelve years and more_than $ 5 billion later , there are 27 state_prisons in_operation , one more scheduled to open this month and the number of guards has more_than doubled , to 14 # 388 . The rapid expansion of the 1980s occurred because California had long neglected its penitentiary system and state legislators were knocking each other over to introduce laws increasing prison sentences . Budget-minded critics warned that the state could not afford to build enough prisons . Nevertheless , the construction continued unabated , though it remained well behind the sentencing curve . By the early to mid-1980s , the prison system was bulging at 155 % of its design capacity . And still the number of inmates increased . California ' s prison system , once the model of progressive penology nationwide , had become a string of stinking dungeons , dangerous for guards and lethal for convicts . Incidents of armed assaults among inmates rose from 200 to more_than 800 per year from 1978 to 1987 . In 1987 , 20 prisoners were killed by other inmates or by guards . Places like Deuel Vocational Institution in the little Central Valley town of Tracy became known as the Stabbing Capital of the World and the Gladiator School as gangbanger convicts carried_on their outside wars inside the walls . Conditions at San Quentin and Folsom were aptly described by observers as a riot in slow_motion . Inmates lived -- and still do live -- two to a closet-sized cell and were kept &quot; on lock-down &quot; -- confined to their cubicles nearly 24 hours per day -- much of the time . Yet the members of the warring Mexican Mafia , Black Guerilla Family , Aryan Brotherhood and Nuestra Familia managed to murder one another and attack their keepers . In 1983 , federal and Superior_Court judges handed_down decisions lambasting the state ' s prisons , especially San Quentin , for overcrowding , rampant violence , filth , rodent infestation and plumbing that leaked so badly that correctional officials considered issuing chamber pots to the inmates . Who would voluntarily enter such a place ? Nola Hearney did_in 1983 , when she was 22 . She had just graduated with a degree in psychology , full of idealism and desperately in need of a job . The Department of Corrections needed guards at San Quentin . &quot; I said , ' I ' ll go_to San Quentin , ' &quot; recalls Hearney , one of the state ' s 2 # 300 women guards . &quot; ' I ' ve heard of that place. ' &quot; Hearney is now an administrative assistant to the warden of Mule Creek State_Prison . The new facility is a far_cry from what Hearney encountered when she walked into San Quentin . &quot; It was a foul place to work and the noise was deafening , &quot; she says of the state ' s oldest prison . &quot; It was a very intimidating environment , &quot; she explains . &quot; Every day was a struggle , initially . They ( the inmates ) were deeply , deeply mentally_ill and violent . They defiled you without even knowing you . I believed when I started with the department that everyone was inherently good and that , with enough concern , that good could be brought_forth . I was wrong. &quot; The first_person Hearney ever saw die was an inmate who had been stabbed by another convict and lay on a cold San Quentin floor with his life oozing away . &quot; And another inmate spit on him while he was dying , &quot; she says . &quot; I ' d go_home and cry . I thought , ' Is this what humanity has come_to ? ' &quot; People who are locked_up for long periods_of_time become ingenious at making things out of very little . Add rage and hopelessness and the items produced can be lethal . Prison officials say that convicts make a crude gunpowder , for example , from ground-up match heads . Something as innocuous as a newspaper is turned_into a deadly spear by rolling it into a long tube and fitting it with a piece of metal that has been smuggled out of a shop and filed to a razor ' s edge . A colleague of Hearney at San Quentin was jabbed in the eye with a prison-made spear . He survived . Another , Sgt . Howell Burchfield , was also speared . He died . The day before he was killed in 1985 , Burchfield , a well-liked officer with an ironic sense_of_humor , had written in his diary : &quot; I always wanted to be a cop or join the circus . Here I have both at San Quentin. &quot; Novey keeps that quotation on the wall of his union headquarters office . Burchfield was the last state_prison guard to be killed on_duty . Department of Corrections statistics indicate that the state_prison system is not as dangerous as it used to be despite the current record level of overcrowding , now pushing 185 % of design capacity . The number of assaults on staff_members , though still in the hundreds , peaked in 1984 , according to the department . Several theories are posed to explain the apparent reduction . For instance , court rulings in the 1980s forced the cleanup of San Quentin and Folsom as well as requiring more humane treatment of prisoners . Meanwhile , some of the more violent gang leaders are aging , their authority waning and their rage cooling . Get-tough-on-crime legislation also has diluted the violence quotient of the prison population by locking_up an increasing number of less dangerous thieves and drug offenders . And as new prisons open , officials are able to isolate the most violent inmates in modern facilities and scrutinize their movements . But even change is often controversial . For instance , a class-action lawsuit in federal_court in San Francisco charges that inmates at the futuristic Pelican Bay_State Prison are subjected_to brutality by guards and isolation so complete that convicts are driven mad . Human_Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union issued a report in December contending that Pelican Bay prisoners are hogtied and made to lap_up their food as disciplinary measures . Correctional officials acknowledge that some unruly inmates were tied_in restraints several years ago , but insist that the practice has stopped . They deny the other allegations . NOT LONG AGO AT MULE CREEK , the model prison where John Denning worked until recently , a cellblock guard momentarily let his attention drift . A prisoner bolted across the day-room floor and , at full stride , smashed his fist into the side of the officer ' s head , knocking him to the concrete floor . The guard now has a metal plate in his head . Wary of such an occurrence , Denning , a six-year veteran , tries to tread a fine line with the inmates , staying alert without becoming mindlessly rigid . &quot; These guys are my bread_and_butter , &quot; he says . &quot; I ' m going_to treat them with respect , give them what they ' re entitled to under the law. &quot; But he knows they will try to manipulate him . &quot; They ' ll game you , &quot; he says . &quot; These inmates know us better than we know each other . They have nothing to do 24 hours a day but study us. &quot; Yet , like many guards , Denning rarely reads case files on inmates . &quot; I don ' t want to know why they ' re here , &quot; he says . &quot; You don ' t want to dwell_on it because it might play mind games with you. &quot; Denning , who has transferred to another prison , frequently worked in one of Mule Creek ' s raised , glassed-in booths that are equipped with control_panels enabling him to open cell doors without coming_into contact with prisoners . Because he has access to a firearm , no one in the cellblock below , including other guards , was allowed to enter his booth . When Denning needed something sent up , he lowered a plastic jug on a rope , the item was placed in the jug and he hauled it back_up . &quot; We have a state-of-the-art facility , &quot; he says with a smile . But for the truly primitive , there is Folsom . In the oldest part of the penitentiary , which has been evolving cellblock by cellblock since 1880 , correctional officer Dave Cruz takes sack lunches to the Latino prisoners who are_on lock-down . They are confined because one of their number was stabbed and officials haven ' t yet determined why . That is the way prisons operate : a Latino is stabbed , lock down the Latinos . Cruz moves along the tiers and unlocks the cells so that inmates can open the solid steel_plate doors that are set_in ancient granite blocks . They reach_out and pick_up their lunches as the guard stands_back and nudges the sacks toward them with his foot . Cruz , 38 , used to be in construction but became a guard eight years ago because he thought the law_enforcement field was more stable than the building industry . He feels safer behind the walls of Folsom than he does on the street , but he has to remind himself to stay alert as he performs the monotonous task of passing_out lunches . &quot; It ' s kind of like driving , &quot; he says . &quot; Sometimes you get complacent . You don ' t pay as much attention as you should . Maybe an inmate gets some bad news and he ' ll take it out on the first_person he meets . And it might be you. &quot; Outside , in a tiny exercise yard in a newer , but still antiquated part of the prison , Gregory Wilson -- unarmed except for a nightstick and a whistle -- stands among men whose arms and upper bodies are buffed out from pumping prison iron and whose bare torsos are covered with prison tattoos . These men hold heavy metal weights in their hands and are within arm ' s length of Wilson , but the 46-year-old guard does not seem overly concerned . If they want to get you , he says , they ' ll get you , no matter where . For Don Novey , it ' s been six years since he walked the line as a guard at Folsom , but sitting in his safe and comfortable office , he still remembers the feeling . &quot; An officer on the line has got_to survive on his wit and his whistle . It ' s like living_in a city of convicted felons . And , &quot; the chief of the guards union hastens to add , &quot; you should be duly rewarded for working the toughest beat. &quot;</TEXT>
