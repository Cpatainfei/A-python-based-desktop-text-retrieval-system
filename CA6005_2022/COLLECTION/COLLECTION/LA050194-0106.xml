   <HEADLINE> BEHIND THE KIDNAPING OF CHILDREN FOR THEIR ORGANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The recent mob attacks in Guatemala on two American women suspected of kidnaping children for organ transplants may be part of a right- wing strategy to create a climate of instability hostile to human-rights monitors . In the more serious of the two incidents , June D . Weinstock , an environmental writer from Fairbanks , Alaska , was engulfed by an enraged mob in San Cristobal Verapaz , in the Mayan Highlands , after she was seen caressing a child whose mother reported him missing immediately afterward . Weinstock was stripped , stoned , stabbed repeatedly and beaten unconscious by her assailants , who were egged_on by state road workers and unidentified outsiders . Although her condition has been upgraded from comatose to &quot; in stupor , &quot; she probably will not recover fully . The assaults on the women and other foreigners tap into indigenous fears that are at least 500 years old . When the Spanish conquistadors invaded the Guatemalan Highlands in the 16th Century , Mayan mothers believed the men with pale complexions and blond beards were anemic , and required the blood of brown-skinned infants to become well . These ancient fears have resurfaced with the rise of a baby-trafficking contraband that accounts_for the disappearance of six children a day , according to Guatemala ' s Public Ministry . Most of these abducted children , who range from newborns to primary schoolers , will be hidden away in &quot; fattening houses &quot; before they are flown to illicit adoption agencies in the United States and Europe . Atty . Gen . Telesforo Guerra Cahn reports 20 kidnaping rings and at least 65 fattening houses operating in Guatemala . The baby trade is so lucrative -- illegal adoptions bring as much as $ 10 # 000 a head -- that high government officials are known to take_part in it . One of the largest rings is allegedly headed by a top government official . Attempts to prosecute him have failed because of his parliamentary immunity , not to mention his influence over the court system and its judges . In recent weeks , this multimillion- dollar traffic has taken a macabre twist , as rumors have resurfaced that some kidnaped babies are being flown abroad for their organs . Like the medieval blood libels in Europe that accused Jews of stealing Christian babies for satanic rituals , the organ-transplant hysteria has taken_on a life of its own . Unlike the medieval blood libels , which were fanned by zealous anti-Semite clerics , there is growing evidence that the organ-transplant rumors may have a basis in fact . In its March 21 issue , Mexico ' s Proceso , which has tracked the baby-trafficking story for months , interviewed Eric Sottas , president of the Geneva-based World_Organization Against Torture , who confirmed the existence of international rings that kidnap children , &quot; not only for illegal adoptions , pornographic activities and child prostitution , but for the purpose of trafficking in organs. &quot; The &quot; Sottas Report , &quot; elaborated over a three-year period with the collaboration of 200 human-rights agencies , was presented March 8 at a conference of transplant experts in Basil , Switzerland . Among many other horrors , the report lists 17 clinics in Tijuana and Juarez , on Mexico ' s U.S. border , that perform sophisticated transplants of kidneys and corneal tissues from kidnaped children to wealthy Europeans and North_Americans who pay top prices for the operations , no questions asked . The Latin_American countries listed as confirmed traffickers in child organs are Brazil , Argentina , Peru , Honduras , Colombia and Mexico . The chief beneficiaries , apart from North_Americans , are reported to be Swiss , German and , above all , Italian buyers . In an earlier report to the United Nations , Sottas named Guatemala , Haiti and Brazil as three countries in which street children are kidnaped for their organs . Most of these children are not heard from again . Whether or not the reports of organ transplants in Guatemala are proved true , their usefulness as a political tool against foreigners is undeniable . In the attack on Melissa C . Larson in Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa , on Guatemala ' s southern lowlands , diplomatic sources reported two military intelligence_officers inciting the crowds . A mob of several hundred set fire to the prison where Larson was being held_in protective custody after townspeople accused her of complicity in the abduction of two children . Larson was freed 19 days later for lack of evidence . Another factor_in the attacks on foreigners could be the breakthrough in the latest round of peace talks in Mexico between the government and leftist guerrillas of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union . For the first time , human-rights violations were placed on the agenda for continuing negotiations in Norway in mid-May . On March 29 , the Guatemalan government agreed to permit a 10-member United Nations verification team to inspect military bases and guerrilla camps and work with other human-rights agencies in Guatemala . The military ' s displeasure with this agreement is hardly surprising , as foreign observers accuse them of responsibility for as much as 95 % of human-rights violations committed by all sides during Guatemala ' s 33-year war of counter- insurgency . In past months , the army moved to tighten its reins on Ramiro de Leon Carpio ' s presidency , pressuring him to dismiss his highly respected interior minister and human-rights specialist , Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso , and his chief of police , Mario Rene Cifuentes , who headed the presidential human-rights commission . Ortiz and Cifuentes were replaced by hard-liners who support the army ' s call_for immunity from prosecution for all its past abuses of power . By far the heaviest blow to Guatemala ' s democratic apertura was the assassination , on April 1 , of Epaminondas Gonzales Dubon , who had been president of Guatemala ' s constitutional court for nearly a year . It was Gonzales who prevented former President Jorge Serrano Elias from abolishing the courts and the congress last May , and ruling the country by dictatorial decree . As a result of Gonzales ' murder and the continuing attacks on foreigners , the U.S. State_Department has issued an advisory against travel_to Guatemala , and 200 Peace Corps volunteers have been recalled from the countryside . President De Leon Carpio backed_down , temporarily at least , from declaring a state of emergency that would include the suspension of constitutional guarantees -- a move that would play further into the military ' s apparent attempts to seal_off the country against foreigners . Meanwhile , the stories of abduction of children for illicit purposes continue to proliferate throughout Latin_America . In Guatemala , the organ-trafficking rumors refuse to go_away . Even if these claims continue to elude confirmation , the verifiable story of a Guatemalan supreme- court president who heads a child trafficking ring is sinister enough to cause stupor in Washington and European capitals , and to keep the pot boiling within Guatemala . As long as army generals and high-level officials continue to get_away with systematic assassinations and infant abductions , the chances are slim that a U.N.-sponsored truth commission could get the job done , and pin_down those responsible_for the murder and disappearance of more_than 100 # 000 Guatemalans in one of the hemisphere ' s bloodiest and longest-lasting armed conflicts. *</TEXT>
