   <HEADLINE> U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN BOSNIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Your April 20 editorial regarding The Times ' proposals for bringing peace to Bosnia literally cries_out_for response . The pursuit and implementation of the policies you advocate are , make no mistake , an act of war . To remove U.N. peacekeepers and initiate a significantly increased tactical air operation , while at_the_same_time lifting the arms embargo , ensures direct United States entry , however distant it may currently be , as an active participant in war . Unless you and those who would advocate similar policies are prepared to support the commitment of the full might of the armed forces of the United States , and the potential consequences of such events , it would be a wiser policy to minimize U.S. involvement in such affairs . The pages of history of the region are dripping with the blood spilled in ethnic and tribal civil_wars . How many of America ' s sons and daughters must be sacrificed before the folly of such actions is finally recognized . DREW J . PHILLIPS Carson * Four points about Bosnia : * Since when can American blood and treasure be put at risk upon &quot; request &quot; by the U.N. , NATO , Boutros-Ghali , or anyone else other_than Americans ? * How can we bomb with a &quot; limited &quot; objective ? If I start with the limited objective of punching you in the nose and you respond by hitting me on the head with a baseball_bat , how &quot; limited &quot; can my objective remain ? * Before risking American lives , why are not the armed-to-the-teeth Arab countries rushing to the aid of their Muslim brothers in Bosnia the way we rushed to their aid in Kuwait ? * The bottom_line : Our government is lying to us about Bosnia . ANDREW GULLIVER Los Angeles * Bill_Clinton should be reminded that he was elected President of the United States , not king of the world . If he wants to go_to_war , let him begin at_home just outside his back yard . RUTH HOROWITZ Los Angeles * Rep . Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) and Sen . John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) and , earlier , former President George_Bush have raised the air of hypocrisy to levels never before seen even in Washington , which is famous for hypocrisy . If Bush and his apologists in Congress had not been deaf and blind to the developing tragedy in Yugoslavia we would not have the crisis today . Their current criticism is merely a smoke_screen to divert attention from the disastrous inaction of the Bush_Administration at a time when non-military action could have helped . By seeing intervention only in military terms two and three years ago and dismissing all other actions to avert a crisis , they have created the disaster in Bosnia today . KEITH PRICE Los Angeles * As a specialist in South Slavic studies for over 20 years , I read Jack Valenti ' s commentary on Bosnia ( April 22 ) with interest . His primary illustration of the dangers of &quot; ancient feuds and the surliest of landscapes &quot; was that &quot; 20 crack Nazi divisions were still stumbling over Yugoslavia in futile frustration when the war ended. &quot; I hate to toss a cold bucket of reality on Valenti ' s point-making , but there are no ancient feuds in Bosnia . The Croatians and Serbs never fought a war in history until 1914 , when Serbia assassinated Archduke Ferdinand , starting the Third Balkan War , which quickly became World_War I . The war in Bosnia is about Serbian aggression , not ancient feuds . Croatia and Bosnia have some of the most beautiful landscapes on earth . There were never 20 &quot; Nazi &quot; ( I think he meant &quot; German &quot; ) divisions in all_of Yugoslavia during World_War_II . As for &quot; crack &quot; I ' m not sure what that means , but the 369th , 373rd , 392nd , and 13th &quot; Handschar &quot; divisions operating in Bosnia during the war were mostly locally recruited Croatians and Muslims with German officers . Most German forces withdrew from Yugoslavia well before the war ended . C . MICHAEL McADAMS , Director Central Valley Regional Campus University of San Francisco Sacramento</TEXT>
