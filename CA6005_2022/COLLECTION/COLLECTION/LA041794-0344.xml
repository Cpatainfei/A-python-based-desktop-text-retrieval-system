   <TEXT> The death toll from pre-election violence in South_Africa had reached_into the hundreds early this month , and an accord between Zulu nationalists and the African National Congress seemed more elusive than ever . From his vantage_point in Phoenix , where he lives_in retirement , the Rev . Leon H . Sullivan was viewing the turmoil with dismay . &quot; I keep remembering that our main objective was to end the apartheid system and get South_African blacks the opportunity to vote , &quot; he said one day recently . &quot; But I have mixed emotions when I see the violence . I did not expect this cleavage between the Zulus and the ANC to continue once it got_to the point where apartheid had ended . &quot; But , &quot; he concluded , &quot; I still have no question about what I worked for. &quot; Sullivan is one of the grand old_men of the campaign to end South_African apartheid through economic pressure . A member of the General Motors board in 1971 , he made corporate history by challenging the company ' s management via a shareholder appeal_to sell_off -- divest -- its South_African operations . In 1987 , as the author of the &quot; Sullivan Principles , &quot; which bound U.S. corporations doing business in South_Africa to promote racial equality and provide greater advancement opportunities for black employees there , he was banned from visiting the country . Now the sanction campaign has effectively ended -- ANC President Nelson Mandela called_for a lifting of foreign restrictions last September -- and its fruits will be_on display next week with the country ' s first multiracial elections . With that in mind , Sullivan and other leaders of the campaign are assessing its role in the changes in South_Africa and its effect on the country ' s future course . For the most part , they regard their achievement with unalloyed pride . &quot; The campaign could not have been more successful : It accomplished exactly what we set_out to accomplish , &quot; said Randall Robinson , who heads TransAfrica , a leading anti-apartheid campaigner . Many note that few other grass-roots campaigns have ever produced the kind of mass consciousness-raising among U.S. voters that the sanction drive did . More_than 100 U.S. localities imposed their own sanctions , refusing to do business with companies that had South_African connections -- a trend that helped push Congress to enact federal sanctions in 1986 over a Ronald Reagan veto . Recalcitrant corporations found themselves shunned by important institutional investors and pressured by freshly politicized shareholders . Scores of major corporations chose to avert public censure by withdrawing from South_Africa altogether . Those remaining as signatories of the Sullivan Principles committed themselves to raising the living standards of their nonwhite employees through education and training_programs . &quot; No company wanted to be identified with apartheid -- that wasn ' t the argument , &quot; said William Moses of the Investor Responsibility Research_Center , &quot; but it was how best to address it . They would say that if they stayed , they could provide jobs and benefits , push the envelope from within . The Sullivan Principles didn ' t fundamentally change South_Africa or the way black South_Africans lived , but it fundamentally changed the lives of those touched by the programs of their employers. &quot; Still , there is little question that overall the sanctions have damaged the South_African economy , at least for the near term , and thus rendered it less able to provide the job growth necessary to satisfy black workers ' expectations of a better lifestyle . That could exacerbate the social tensions already manifesting themselves in sectional violence . The situation revives the longstanding debate over whether sanctions were the proper -- or the best -- tool with which to influence South_African politics . &quot; The question is , what did you hope to achieve ? &quot; said Herman Nickel , an opponent of sanctions who was U.S. ambassador to South_Africa in 1982-86 and now is a consultant to a group called Global Business Access . &quot; Is the economic damage caused sufficiently offset by the political gains ? &quot; Nickel maintains that the demands of economic_growth in the country were already forcing white businesses to bring blacks into the system as workers and even managers . In time that would have led to the political changes wrought by the political accord reached last year by Mandela and President Frederik W . de Klerk . &quot; All this you ' re seeing now would have happened even without sanctions , &quot; he said . Anti-apartheid activists sharply disagree . &quot; There ' s no evidence that economic_growth would have changed anything in South_Africa , &quot; said Jennifer Davis , a native South_African who is executive_director of the New York-based Africa Fund . &quot; The 1960s were years of tremendous economic expansion and also years of the intensification of repression. &quot; Others , such_as Robinson of TransAfrica , believe that the sanctions were indispensable in_forcing South_African whites to confront the costs of apartheid . &quot; We began the sanctions effort in the 1960s , and all that time the apologists for apartheid argued that they would not work , &quot; he said . &quot; Meanwhile , the apartheid system got stronger and more Draconian . It was_after the sanctions reached full bite and South_African whites began to pay a real price for the system that it began to crumble . I think ( the sanctions ) changed fundamentally the cost-benefit calculus in a way that caused De Klerk to come_to the table and to release Nelson Mandela &quot; from prison in 1990 . The 1986 U.S. federal sanctions barred the export of most products to South_Africa and the import of such commodities as fruits and vegetables and raw steel . But blood had already been drawn . South_African business people and many analysts agree that the single most damaging blow to the country was the drying_up of international capital after 1985 , when Chase Manhattan Bank refused to renew its $ 30 million in short-term loans in the country and said it would engage in no new lending . Other U.S. banks , which had about $ 4.2 billion in loans outstanding to South_African institutions , followed_suit . &quot; When the banks took a tough stand , it became clear to the South_African community that business couldn ' t go_on as usual , &quot; Davis said . Today ' s estimates of the total cost to the South_African economy from foreign divestiture range from $ 10 billion to $ 50 billon , much of that measured in higher capital expenses , higher consumer prices and the cost of illicitly circumventing trade_embargoes . But circumvent they did . Some estimates say the value of clandestine South_African imports and exports equaled the value of overt , non-embargoed trade_in most years during the sanction period . Oil and other raw_materials continued to come_into the country , albeit at higher prices . And even in such staunch anti-apartheid African_countries as Ivory_Coast , one could find cans of Coca-Cola labeled in Afrikaans in the late 1980s . As for the fact that the campaign ' s economic burden often fell on black as well as white citizens , its leaders say it always involved a delicate balancing of short-term pain and long-term goals . Others maintain that the root of South_Africa ' s economic troubles is not the sanctions but the political_system that provoked them . &quot; The basic cause of damage to the South_African economy was apartheid , &quot; said Dumisani Kumalo , a South_African who is project director for the Africa Fund . &quot; If you ' re a country of 40 million people and you ' re only harnessing the energies of 5 million , you ' re not running the economy at full speed . It took millions of dollars to create these separate systems . The economy was overtaxed to fund a system that ' s now discredited. &quot; One important element in the success of the campaign in the United States was its grass-roots nature -- not unusual for a domestic political_movement but rare for an effort to influence foreign_policy . Its organizers made a deliberate decision to start not in Washington but among the municipal and state councils of the U.S. heartland . &quot; The South_African government had spent millions buying access to senators and congressmen , &quot; Kumalo said . &quot; So it was difficult for us to do anything in Washington . But at the state and city level , there was an even playing field. &quot; The resulting proliferation of local anti-apartheid initiatives was &quot; quite extraordinary , &quot; Moses said . &quot; At least 179 local entities decided to have local sanctions , &quot; a response unique in its scale , he said . &quot; The South_Africa issue really caught_fire . Last summer we were still finding new sanctions on the books. &quot; Many of these regulations hit companies in their pocketbooks by barring those with South_African ties from receiving local_government contracts , forcing corporations large and small to choose between doing business with South_Africa or with , say , the city of Los Angeles . &quot; A lot of companies felt it was better to keep their business closer to home , &quot; Moses said . Among the most detailed was that of Los Angeles , which barred companies that had even the most trivial or remote connections with South_Africa from doing business with the city . &quot; The idea was to give them a message about how the city_fathers and mothers felt about South_Africa , &quot; said George Wolfberg , a financial analyst in the city administrative office who administered the program . &quot; Literally thousands of companies had to sign an affidavit that they were not doing business with South_Africa in any way. &quot; Today , of course , what South_Africa needs is reinvestment . Many of the old campaign ' s leaders are now turning their attention toward how to re-inject U.S. capital into the country in_order to promote socially responsible corporate behavior in the post-apartheid era . Since July , 1991 , when President George_Bush ended a five-year ban on new U.S. investments in South_Africa , 45 companies have entered or returned to that market , according to the Investor Responsibility Research_Center . Some have repurchased affiliates that they had parked with local investors for the period of divestiture . The number of U.S. companies now operating there is 152 ; in 1986 , when the sanctions went_into effect , there were 267 , according to the center . Most analysts agree that South_Africa cannot make the transition to post-apartheid democracy without such an infusion of outside capital . &quot; The challenges ahead are more daunting than the ones we ' ve overcome so far , &quot; Robinson said . &quot; Before , it didn ' t matter that 7 million of 22 million blacks were living_in self-erected shacks or that the education system was spending five to 10 times less to prepare black students than white ones . Now it does matter . But the money to correct this is not in South Africa. &quot; Sullivan himself has drafted a new set of principles for incoming investors , binding them to promote equal_opportunity , management training , the support of black businesses and other idealistic goals . U.S. Investment ANC President Nelson Mandela called_for a lifting of foreign restrictions last September , and the number of American companies doing business there is_on the rebound . U.S. companies in South_Africa ' 86 : 267 ' 87 : 168 ' 88 : 151 ' 89 : 138 ' 90 : 123 ' 91 : 104 ' 92 : 106 ' 93 : 119 April ' 94 : 152 Source : Investor Responsibility Research_Center Inc .</TEXT>
