   <HEADLINE> EXTRA DAY IN ORBIT BRINGS SCIENCE BONUS ; SPACE : ASTRONAUTS CONSERVE SUFFICIENT ELECTRICITY TO POWER ADDED LASER LIGHT ATMOSPHERIC EXPERIMENTS . THEY ARE TO RETURN TO EARTH MONDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The space shuttle Discovery showered Earth with lightning-quick pulses of green laser light Saturday , a day of bonus science for the astronauts and researchers on the ground . It was much quieter and more subdued than Friday , when two of the crew took turns using a jet pack for the first untethered spacewalks in a decade . &quot; It ' s a little bit disorienting , &quot; spacewalker Carl Meade told a radio interviewer Saturday . &quot; But other_than that . . . it felt quite normal outside. &quot; &quot; I tell you , it was absolutely phenomenal , &quot; said astronaut Jerry Linenger , who directed the spacewalkers from inside the cockpit . The mission originally was supposed to end today after nine days , but the astronauts conserved enough electricity to allow_for a 10th day for science work . Landing was rescheduled from today to 11:24 a.m. PDT Monday . As of Saturday , ground controllers had fired more_than 1 million laser pulses from Discovery for a study of the atmosphere . Researchers were elated , especially those who had lost data because of earlier equipment_failures . &quot; We ' re making_up for it , getting as much as we ever hoped for and more , &quot; said laser experimenter Bob Menzies , an atmospheric scientist at the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena . The six astronauts could see the pencil-thin , fluorescent green pulses streaming from Discovery at a rate of 10 per second . But they couldn ' t see the laser light reflecting off the tops of clouds or Earth ' s surface . And there were no reports of anyone on the ground seeing the laser pulses , NASA said . An instrument aboard Discovery collected the reflected laser light , allowing Menzies and other scientists to calculate the altitude and density of desert dust and other pollutants in the atmosphere . They will use the findings to better understand global weather ; one of Saturday ' s laser targets was Typhoon Melissa in the Pacific_Ocean . It ' s the first time the $ 25-million laser package has flown in orbit . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration gave_up trying to fix a laser-data recorder aboard Discovery , which never worked right from the start . The recorder was needed to save any laser measurements that could not be transmitted instantly to ground controllers ; that turned_out to be a small portion of the data . Researchers studying the exhaust from the shuttle ' s steering jets also had to contend with a data-relay problem , which popped_up again Saturday . Astronauts worked around the problem and fired the jets at instruments carried by an 82-foot-long beam extended from the shuttle . NASA wants to know how engine exhaust affects solar_panels and other structures in space before sending Atlantis to dock with Russia ' s Mir space_station in May .</TEXT>
