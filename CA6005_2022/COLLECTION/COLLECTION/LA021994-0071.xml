   <HEADLINE> THE STING OF SACRAMENTO ; BRILLIANT FBI WORK SHOWS THE UNDERBELLY OF CORRUPTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Another one bites the political dust in Sacramento -- and the dust is still stirring . Assemblyman Pat Nolan ( R-Glendale ) , in a deal struck with federal prosecutors , pleaded guilty to political corruption and has resigned.It ' s the end to another chapter in a continuing , disgusting saga of government for_sale . The former Republican Assembly leader agreed to enter a guilty plea to one racketeering count in exchange for a sentence of two years in prison and nine months in a halfway house . He thus avoided a trial on six criminal counts for which he could have expected a six-year sentence . Earlier this week lobbyist Clayton R . Jackson was convicted of corruption and given a 6 1 / 2-year sentence . Jackson ' s co-defendant , disgraced former state Sen . Paul Carpenter , also was convicted but fled the country and is a fugitive . All were swept_up in the FBI ' s eight-year investigation of corruption in Sacramento , in which agents offered money in return for official action . The sting has led to the conviction or indictment of a dozen people . The FBI , to its credit , has relentlessly pursued the investigation , which has illuminated the dangerously cozy relationships between legislators and lobbyists in the state_capital . Are lobbyists indeed the unelected arm of government in Sacramento ? The investigation sadly demonstrates that too often legislating doesn ' t quite work the way it ' s described in the civics books .</TEXT>
