   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON : COMPANY TOWN ; FRENCH FIRM TESTS HOLLYWOOD WATERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hachette , the Paris-based publishing giant behind such popular magazines as Elle , Woman ' s Day and Metropolitan Home , is in discussions about expanding its presence in Hollywood . Dominique Bigle , the new chairman of Hachette ' s Film Office division , has met with senior executives at Paramount Pictures , Universal Pictures and other entertainment companies during a 10-day swing through Los Angeles . Bigle said he ' s scouting for projects that will help extend Hachette ' s reach_into the_French home video , television , theatrical and merchandising markets . &quot; We want to make the Film Office more of an entertainment division , &quot; said the 43-year-old Bigle . &quot; It ' s my intention to develop the company . If I find something , I will put the money on the table. &quot; Bigle is specifically discussing film and TV co-productions . While Hachette might commit to broader joint_ventures , he said it is not looking_to acquire an entire company . Bigle expects to announce the first of his deals , involving family entertainment , soon . He is also in discussions about opening a Los Angeles office . Hollywood always welcomes new money , especially from deep-pocketed companies such_as Hachette , a division of the Lagardere Group , which had more_than $ 10 billion in sales last year . But those investments carry more_than a little risk . Canal Plus , the_French pay TV giant , is a major investor in perennially troubled Carolco Pictures . Another French company , CIBY 2000 , closed its Los Angeles office after much fanfare , following the failure of its &quot; Twin Peaks : Fire Walk With Me. &quot; Based on what he ' s observed , Bigle says , it makes better business sense to invest in specific projects than in companies , but he says he also wants to build long-term relationships . As the European Union considers possible barriers to American entertainment imports , Bigle adds , &quot; I ' m sure we can find studios that will be happy to have a French partner in Europe. &quot; * While vast French companies like Hachette have reputations for moving slowly , one executive who specializes in the international market agreed with Bigle ' s assessment of the market . &quot; Hollywood is very open_to deals , especially after being excluded from the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , &quot; the executive said . &quot; More things will happen between now and next year than ever . You won ' t recognize the entertainment map. &quot; Sources say Bigle ' s first priority is expanding Hachette ' s presence in home video , a market that ' s underdeveloped in France . One plan calls_for putting videos in the kiosks where Hachette ' s magazines are sold . The company has a nine-picture deal with Cinergi Pictures , a limited video retailing pact with Disney and an uncompleted deal with Carolco . * While many of his countrymen are fighting to curtail the pervasive influence of Hollywood films in France , Bigle calls himself a big fan . &quot; You have fantastic product here , &quot; he says . With the Lagardere Group independently exploring new-media opportunities , Bigle has focused_on marketing entertainment with Hachette ' s magazines . A third target is merchandising , which helps explain his interest in family entertainment . &quot; It makes_sense to control the product from beginning to end , &quot; Bigle said . &quot; that ' s how you get the most bang for the buck. &quot; People who have worked with Bigle say he ' s well qualified to exploit those opportunities . His father , Armand , handled Walt Disney Co . films in France , and the younger Bigle played_at Walt Disney ' s house and attended the opening of Disneyland . He later became vice_president of Walt Disney Co . France before leaving to form his own United Communication . &quot; Dominique has been dealing with the major studios and leading independents for years , &quot; said Stephen A . Unger , managing director of the worldwide entertainment and communications practice at SpencerStuart , an executive recruiting firm . &quot; He wasn ' t wanting for job opportunities . He could have picked his spot at any of the American or European majors. &quot; * Cinderfella Story : Twentieth Century Fox on Friday quietly purchased the rights to the first screenplay by Antwone Fisher , who until last fall was employed in a vastly different studio capacity -- as a security_guard at Sony Pictures Entertainment . The script , tentatively titled &quot; The Antwone Fisher Story , &quot; is based on_the_moving life_story of the former security_guard , who was born in jail without knowing any members of his family and raised in a series of sometimes abusive homes before enlisting in the Navy , where a psychiatrist encouraged him to begin a process of self-discovery . Fisher , 35 , was found by producers Randa Haines and Todd Black while participating in a screenwriting program led by Chris Smith in South-Central Los Angeles , just one month before he would have lost his job as part of Sony ' s decision to contract_out its security work . The Fox-based producers set him up in an office , paid him a weekly salary and helped him learn the basic techniques involved in screenwriting . Asked to describe Fisher ' s finished product , Haines said : &quot; It ' s about hope . It ' s about how one person can save themselves. &quot; Fox declined to discuss the project . But sources say Fisher will receive in the low to mid-six figures if the film is made .</TEXT>
