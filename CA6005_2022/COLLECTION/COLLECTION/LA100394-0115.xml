   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / GRAHAME L . JONES ; NORTH CAROLINA WOMEN TIE , STREAK BROKEN AT 92</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It had to end sometime and Sunday was that time . The University of North Carolina women ' s soccer team , which had won 92 consecutive games , finally met its match . The fact that it was Notre Dame that ended the Tar Heels ' record streak should not have come as any surprise to UNC Coach Anson Dorrance . It was Notre Dame that ended the UCLA men ' s basketball_team ' s NCAA-record 88-game winning_streak set between 1971- ' 74 , so the_Irish have a history of playing the spoiler . On Sunday , Notre Dame held North Carolina to a 0-0 tie after overtime in St . Louis to snap the longest winning_streak in college sports history . &quot; If you look_at us five years ago , or even four years ago , we didn ' t belong on the field with North Carolina , &quot; said Notre Dame Coach Chris Petrucelli . &quot; Even last year , we couldn ' t stay with them. &quot; But North Carolina , which has won eight consecutive NCAA championships and 12 of the last 13 titles , still has one streak going . The Tar Heels , whose teams features many of the players on the defending world champion U.S. women ' s national team , are unbeaten in 97 games since tying Central Florida in 1990 . The goal of 100 still is within reach . * U.S. national team defender and former UCLA star Mike Lapper set a record of sorts in his debut for VfL Wolfsburg of the German second division . Playing against Fortuna Koln , the 23-year-old scored a goal on his first shot in the league when he fired home a deflected corner_kick . First-place Wolfsburg won , 3-0 . Lapper ' s performance earned him a spot on Kicker magazine ' s team of the week . * Anghel Iordanescu , Romania ' s national team coach who led his country into the quarterfinals of the World Cup , has been rewarded , sort of . Iordanescu has been promoted from colonel to major general in the Romanian army . * Colombian prosecutors have been unable to uncover sufficient evidence to keep two men in prison on suspicion of ordering the murder of World Cup team defender Andres Escobar . The men have been released on bail , but Umberto Munoz Castre , the man accused of committing the murder , remains behind bars in Bogota awaiting trial . * Miguel Kodja Neto , the president of the Brazilian club Santos , is having second_thoughts about his criticism of Pele . Neto fired Pele from his position as &quot; international adviser &quot; to the club he helped make world famous in the 1960s after the two had disagreed over Pele ' s role at the club . &quot; He just comes here as a visitor and all he does is complain , &quot; Neto said . In a show of solidarity with Pele , the rest of the Santos board of directors immediately resigned , leaving Neto to run the club on_his_own . * Santos has been in the news for all_the wrong reasons lately . First there was the incident with the club ' s fiery coach , Serginho , who was fined $ 50 # 000 for an on-field incident after Santos had been beaten , 4-0 , by Guarini . Walking past the Guarini bench on his way back to the locker_room , Serginho kicked a Guarini club official in the groin after the man allegedly had called him a &quot; cowardly pig. &quot; Then , during another match against Vasco da Gama in Rio de Janeiro , Santos fans became involved in a brawl , the highlight of which , for neutral observers , was a Brazilian policeman being bitten by his own dog while trying to quell the riot . * From the &quot; what goes_around , comes_around &quot; department : Leonardo , the Brazilian player whose dangerously thrown elbow felled U.S. midfielder Tab Ramos in the World Cup , has found himself on the receiving end of an opponent ' s anger . Playing for his new club , the Kashima Antlers in Japan ' s J-League , Leonardo was sent writhing to the ground in agony after a hard tackle by an Urawa Reds ' player . The tackle injured Leonardo ' s right knee , which will require surgery and will keep him sidelined for two months or more . The get-well_card from Ramos is in the mail . * Mexico ' s World Cup coach , Miguel Mejia Baron , has been given a new , four-year contract that will run_through the 1998 World Cup in France . Under terms of the agreement , Mejia Baron also will have charge of Mexico ' s 1996 Olympic , Under-20 and Under-17 national teams .</TEXT>
