   <HEADLINE> DOCTOR DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS HIT RECORD HIGH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A record 3 # 081 doctors in the country were disciplined by state authorities last year but further efforts are needed to weed out incompetent or unfit physicians , officials of a national organization said Tuesday . The number of disciplinary actions has increased 14 % in four years , according to Dr. Hormoz Rassekh , president of the Federation of State Medical Boards , whose members include 67 state and territorial medical licensing boards . &quot; The encouraging part of this data is that we see overall continued activity in an upward movement , &quot; said Dr. James R . Winn , the federation ' s executive_vice_president . But he added : &quot; We think more can be done and we intend to do more. &quot; Disciplinary actions rose in California as well , although the Medical Board of California disagreed_with the federation ' s figures for the state . According to the federation , California officials took action in 280 cases last year . But Dixon Arnett , executive_director of the state board , said that the actual number was 367 -- an increase from 202 the previous year . The numbers differ because the state counts certain actions , such_as temporary restraining orders and interim suspensions , that the federation does not include , Arnett said in a telephone_interview . Assuring high_quality medical_care has become a clarion call_in the health_care reform debate in part because the White_House has embraced it as an abiding principle . In a related development Tuesday , union officials announced that the labor_movement has begun an aggressive grass-roots lobbying effort to persuade undecided Democratic members of the House to support President Clinton ' s health legislation . Full-time staff_members of various unions have been dispatched to 32 congressional_districts to coordinate volunteers on behalf of the legislation , said Gerald Shea , who heads the AFL-CIO ' s health_care efforts . At a news_conference earlier Tuesday , union officials released a study claiming that working families could lose as much as $ 128 billion over the next six years if a tax is placed on employer health benefits to help finance health_care reform . The tax would be passed along to workers , forcing them to dip_into their pockets to maintain coverage , according to the study , which was conducted by the Lewin-VHI research firm for the Service Employees International Union . The proposed tax on benefits is included in a health_care reform package sponsored by Rep . Jim Cooper ( D-Tenn. ) that is being advanced as an alternative to the Clinton health plan . The disciplinary actions against doctors cited by the federation cover a range of punishments , including the most serious steps -- revocation or suspension of licenses to practice . Winn said that the federation hopes to encourage greater funding for state boards to speed_up disciplinary proceedings . Currently , an average of 37 weeks passes between the receipt of a complaint and disposition of a case , said Gerald J . Bechamps , a Winchester , Va. , physician and incoming federation president . Concern over quality also has been fanned by the growth of managed care networks , which many believe is not always consistent with the delivery of the best quality care . The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations announced Tuesday that it has launched a major new program to provide public evaluations of medical provider networks . Hospitals , insurance_companies and doctors are rapidly forming combined service networks .</TEXT>
