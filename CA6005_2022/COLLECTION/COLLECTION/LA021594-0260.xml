   <HEADLINE> CHANGE IN SLEEPING HABITS MAY HAVE CUT INFANT DEATHS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> University of Washington researchers said Monday that advice to parents against allowing infants to sleep face down has reduced the incidence of sudden_infant_death_syndrome in the United States . Sometimes called crib_death , it is the most common cause of death in developed countries among children between 1 month and 1 year . &quot; We believe the balance of the evidence to be overwhelmingly against the continued use of the prone position and that a national campaign to inform parents on the risk of the prone position in the first six months of life should be given serious consideration , &quot; said the report from the University of Washington in Seattle . The study was published in the February edition of the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine . In April , 1992 , the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that the face-down position be avoided . In the ensuing six months there was a 12 % drop_in the number of SIDS cases reported nationally compared to the previous year , the study said . If there is a national campaign to alert parents to the danger , the study said , it should also &quot; draw parents ' attention to other actions that will lower the risk of sudden_death -- namely breast-feeding , not smoking , not having the baby sleep_in the parents ' bed and not overheating the baby with too many clothes or blankets. &quot; In an editorial published in the same journal , Carl Hunt of the Medical College of Ohio , in Toledo , cautioned that more study is needed before concluding that a change in sleeping position is the sole answer to reducing sudden infant deaths .</TEXT>
