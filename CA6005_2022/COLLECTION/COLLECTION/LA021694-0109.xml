   <HEADLINE> VENTURA COUNTY INDUSTRY ASSAILS EPA SMOG PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The broad-based smog remedies recommended Tuesday by federal environmental officials were met with alarm and skepticism by Ventura County industry leaders , who said the weighty regulations could drive them out of business . Several Ventura County business_executives promised to challenge portions of the proposal at every step of the public process before the federal Environmental Protection Agency recommendations become final next year . Others complained that such stringent air quality efforts would have severe impacts on production and jobs . One of the federal recommendations prompting special concern in Ventura County affects companies that emit more_than four tons of hydrocarbons or four tons of oxides of nitrogen annually . Under the proposal , those firms would have to lower emissions by 6 % a year for four years , beginning in 2001 . &quot; If they ' re talking a 24 % reduction over four years , that ' s an extraordinary reduction , &quot; said Robert Paulger , an engineer for Procter &amp; Gamble , which produces paper products at its Oxnard facility . &quot; I think it would have substantial negative implications , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t know that we could do it. &quot; The draft EPA plan covers virtually every source of air_pollution in Ventura County and two other jurisdictions -- greater Los Angeles and Sacramento -- that have perennially failed to meet federal air quality standards . The recommendations were ordered by a federal_court after Citizens to Preserve the Ojai and other Southern California environmental groups sued the EPA for failing to require local_governments to observe federal laws requiring compliance with clean-air standards by 2005 . &quot; It has to be comprehensive to achieve the deadlines , &quot; said Neil Levine , an attorney with the Environmental Defense Center of Santa Barbara , which represented the Ojai group in its lawsuit . &quot; It ' s going_to affect everybody ' s lives because they can ' t afford to leave anybody out , &quot; Levine said of the EPA plan . &quot; Hopefully , with the public comment period , we can get something effective in reducing the ozone in the air without causing too_much grief to people. &quot; Ventura County air quality officials said Tuesday that the federal plan would give teeth to local regulators . &quot; It ' s going_to provide substantial emission reductions that we need and can ' t attain on our own because we don ' t have the authority , &quot; said Richard H . Baldwin , director of the county Air_Pollution Control District . &quot; All of these things are things that were out of our grasp before that will be beneficial to our attainment strategies , &quot; he said . &quot; The district has no authority on mobile sources ( of air_pollution ) , and a lot of the reductions will come from mobile sources. &quot; In addition to the reductions called_for in local industry , motor_vehicles would be required to pass a smog-check system three times tougher than the existing program . Roughly half of the ozone produced in Ventura County is the result of vehicle_traffic , the air_pollution district said . Several of the county ' s major employers , including Southern California Gas Co. , Southern California Edison and the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station , said they could not yet tell what impact the proposal would have_on their operations . Edison has already been targeted by Rule 59 -- a county ordinance approved in June , 1991 , that requires power_plants to reduce smog-causing emissions by 88 % before 1997 . Agricultural leaders said the EPA proposals would have broad impact on the county ' s billion-dollar farming industry . For example , they said , proposals to more closely regulate use of pesticides could threaten citrus and avocado growers . &quot; If they were to restrict the amount we use or the days we could use them , it might force us to use non-selective materials , &quot; said Dave Machlitt , a Ventura County Farm Bureau board_member . Using less effective pesticides &quot; can cause other pests to become problems. &quot; &quot; That would raise costs and lead to insect resistance , &quot; Machlitt said . &quot; It gets you on a treadmill where you use more and more pesticides. &quot; Under the proposal , delivery_trucks from outside the area that do not comply with local rules would be allowed only one stop in the county per visit -- which could have a severe impact on agriculture by raising transportation costs . &quot; Ninety-nine percent of the trucks in this county don ' t meet certain emission standards , &quot; county Agricultural Commissioner W . Earl McPhail said . &quot; If they go_into non-attainment , they can only make one stop in the county , and that has us very concerned. &quot; McPhail said county officials have overestimated the contribution that pesticides make to air_pollution . But he expressed hope that the proposal can be amended to suit farming interests . Other industries complained Tuesday that they too would be hard-pressed to comply . &quot; that ' s going_to chase us out of here sooner or later , &quot; said Jon Cronk , director of health and safety for Union Oil , which has several operations targeted by the plan . Kevin Rubey , plant manager for 3M ' s computer tape production facility in Camarillo , said the plan seems to penalize companies that have already cleaned_up emissions . &quot; What we have put_in place today is the most technologically advanced system that ' s available in the world , &quot; Rubey said . &quot; For us to reduce from this point can ' t be done. &quot; One of the plaintiffs in the Ojai group ' s lawsuit said tough new laws are long overdue . &quot; There may be other methods ( to reduce air_pollution ) that are less difficult to deal with economically , &quot; said Stan Greene , president of Citizens to Preserve the Ojai . &quot; that ' s why there is a lengthy public comment process. &quot; Greene said the benefits of cleaner air far outweigh its costs to industry and jobs . &quot; The real cost in air_pollution is what it costs in lower farm production , poor crops , health-care costs and lost working_days , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s what we have to weigh it against , and people don ' t always look_at that. &quot; * CAR CURBS : Ventura County supervisors get_tough on car-pooling .
