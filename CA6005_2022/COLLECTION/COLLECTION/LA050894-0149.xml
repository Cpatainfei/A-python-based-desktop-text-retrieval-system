   <HEADLINE> RADIO ; LEADING L.A. TO THE LIGHT ; AFTER TWO YEARS , TV NEWS REFUGEE WARREN OLNEY REFLECTS ON HIS REBORN CAREER AND THE UNEXPECTED CLOUT OF ' WHICH WAY , L.A. ? '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Possibly stranger things have happened in broadcasting , but Warren Olney ' s trans-media journey from the anchor desks at Channels 2 and 13 to his seat at the controls of KCRW-FM ' s &quot; Which Way , L.A. ? &quot; remains in defiance of the laws of electronic journalism . Highly paid TV news people do not , as a rule , migrate to the prestigious poverty of public radio . Few TV anchors would probably qualify even if they had the desire , and few have the desire because the money and celebrity are in television . Olney , at 56 , has taken_the_road less traveled . And it has remade his career . Hurled onto the air by local National Public Radio affiliate KCRW ( 89.9 ) in the wake of the April , 1992 , riots , &quot; Which Way , L.A. ? &quot; in two years has surpassed even its creators ' best expectations , becoming a critical daily gathering place for the hearts and minds of this complex and troubled megalopolis , a small clearing where it often seems that the warring tribes are talking to one another . The head gatherer at this 1 p.m. Monday-Friday democratic inquiry ( the program is rebroadcast at 7 p.m. ) is Olney , who seems to be doing something no one has ever done before , at least in Los Angeles , by combining the skills of a political reporter with those of a diplomat and street referee , forging a new role as a kind of ombudsman of the air . He sits alone in a small basement studio on the campus of Santa Monica College and reins_in by telephone five or six carefully chosen guests -- activists , elected officials , ministers , reporters , professors , ordinary citizens -- sometimes taking additional callers , probing , mediating and making as clear as possible the conflicting points of self-interest surrounding a given issue . It ' s an hour of in-depth discussion with , of course , no commercial breaks . The show has been essential listening in government_offices and newsrooms but also in kitchens and cars and on portable radios tuned_in by Angelenos trying to make_sense of the law , the schools , the police , the environment , crime and health_care , as well as the forces of race , class and culture that set the city on_fire two years ago . &quot; It does pack some wallop in the political and governmental community , &quot; says Westside city councilman and former mayoral candidate Zev Yaroslavsky , who has been a guest on the show several times . &quot; When I ' m on , people tell me they ' ve heard me . People definitely listen . If somebody says something newsworthy or interesting on ' Which Way , L.A. ? ' it will be all around town that day. &quot; One measure of the show ' s clout came last year during a program on the mayoral campaign when , at one point , the leading candidates -- Michael Woo , Richard Katz , Richard Riordan and Joel Wachs -- were all on hold , waiting for Olney to question them . &quot; He manages to make domestic stuff compelling , with a very high level of debate , &quot; says Ian Masters , the host of the long-running Sunday morning foreign_policy program &quot; Background Briefing &quot; on public station KPFK-FM ( 90.7 ) . &quot; Not only is it rare to have somebody talking_about something important , but he ' s doing_it when the trend in the media is to be more circus-like , with less and less reasoning. &quot; Unlike the personalities who dominate commercial talk radio , Olney chooses not to flaunt his own opinions . He has not taken it as his mission to be amusing or provocative or as deliberately charming as the popular and genteel Michael Jackson of KABC-AM ( 790 ) . Yet he has been a powerful presence on the air : a voice full of curiosity and intellect that is somehow soothing at_the_same_time . In the continuing social disarray that is Los Angeles , it has sometimes seemed that if anyone is pulling the city together it ' s not Mayor Riordan , it ' s not Magic Johnson , it ' s , of all people , Warren Olney . &quot; Well , it ' s Ruth Seymour and it ' s Larry Stein and it ' s Sarah Spitz and a lot of people , &quot; Olney says when he hears this , acknowledging the KCRW team that assembles the show with him . &quot; And it ' s the guests who really make_it . But if that ' s true , if it does have that function to some extent , then that ' s the highest form of achievement as far as I ' m concerned . You know there aren ' t a lot of things that do pull this place together. &quot; The closest thing to Olney ' s show is the nightly half-hour &quot; Life &amp; Times &quot; on KCET-TV Channel 28 , which is a more conventional talk_show , with three seated hosts and frequent in-studio guests . While the audience for &quot; Which Way , L.A. ? &quot; may be small ( about 150 # 000 listeners a week ) by the standards of television ratings or Howard Stern radio numbers , it is considered an influential and diverse group . &quot; It ' s not just the yuppie Westside , &quot; Olney says . &quot; I get a lot of response from government and a surprising amount of recognition from places I didn ' t expect it -- from the black community in particular . It ' s hard to account_for that except to say that we are dealing with issues that other people aren ' t , giving people a voice that they don ' t have elsewhere . And taking them seriously , which is probably the most important thing . that ' s one of the lessons of the riots : People were pissed_off from not being heard from , being ignored. &quot; * Olney walked away from KCOP-TV Channel 13 and a hefty six-figure salary in December , 1991 , because , he says , &quot; I just didn ' t want to do_it anymore , really . I wanted to do something different and sort of get_back to where I started , which was reporting . I was casting_about . Ironically , I had thought_about doing radio because I ' ve always liked radio . I grew_up with radio as a listener. &quot; Yet he had never worked in radio . He started his career in newspapers and jumped to TV early . He met Ruth Seymour ( then Hirschman ) , KCRW ' s general_manager , in the 1970s , when both were members of a local journalists ' chapter of Amnesty International , the organization that monitors political imprisonment and torture around the world . After leaving television , he ran_into her at a social_gathering and told her that he listened to the station and that if she ever needed any help , he was available . &quot; I never thought_of Warren as a television anchor , &quot; Seymour says . &quot; I always saw him in the context of that group , which shared certain concerns . I knew he was somebody interested in the world , human_rights and the way the city operated. &quot; Seymour , whose critics had accused KCRW of having a preoccupation with national and international affairs at the exclusion of local politics , took the riots as a further sign that the high-profile station had to change some of its focus . She called Olney and asked him to host a one-time round_table on the riots presented in concert with a related show on PBS affiliate KCET . Things went so well that she asked him to come_back and do_it for a week , then a second week , as Los Angeles continued to re-examine what had happened to itself on April 29 , 1992 . Believing that the show might have legs , Seymour came_up with a running title , &quot; Which Way , L.A. ? &quot; &quot; After two weeks there was still stuff to talk_about , &quot; Olney recalls . &quot; I had a sense that my former colleagues ( in TV ) would be going_back to business as usual , which I think they subsequently did , so we thought maybe we can keep some of these things alive a little longer . So then it went_on for the summer and then , Jesus , the rest of the year , and then we got a grant to do_it for another year . So here we are still doing_it . I had no intention of doing this . It came_about completely by accident. &quot; * Though he may have been a new figure to KCRW listeners , Olney had been a familiar face on local television_news since the ' 70s , having worked for Channels 2 , 4 , 7 and 13 as either a reporter or anchor . It became apparent from the first days of &quot; Which Way , L.A. ? &quot; that he was not just another big , round voice bringing the sound of television_news to public radio . But then , he had never exactly been a typical TV_newsman . &quot; He was one of the guys who did his homework , &quot; says Los Angeles City Councilman Wachs , who remembers Olney as a TV_reporter . &quot; When he ' d come_to interview you , he was always well-prepared . He took the time to become knowledgeable. &quot; He is , to be precise , Warren Olney IV , a fourth-generation Californian whose great-grandfather was the mayor of Oakland , a friend of conservationist John Muir and a founder of the Sierra Club . His father , Warren Olney III , was a Bay Area prosecutor and state_attorney general who became head of the criminal division of the Justice_Department under President Dwight D . Eisenhower . Warren IV grew_up in Berkeley , then moved with his family to Washington , D.C. , for high_school . He went_to exclusive Amherst College in Massachusetts and while he was still an undergraduate married his high_school sweetheart -- not an everyday occurrence at Amherst , which was then all-male . The marriage ended in divorce after five years and two children . ( He has , in all , four children and four grandchildren from three wives. ) After doing graduate work in English at Berkeley and Cornell , Olney was drafted into the Army in 1963 and almost got sent to Vietnam as a radio operator . But his military job was changed to information specialist and he served out his time at Ft . Monroe , S.C. , writing news releases and speeches for generals . He hastens to add that this was not what steered him into journalism : &quot; I don ' t want to give credit to the Army for anything positive in my life , except learning how to beat the system , learning how to survive. &quot; He took his first newspaper job in 1965 at the Newport News , Va. , Daily Press . &quot; I had always wanted to be a writer , &quot; he says . &quot; And I had no idea how you could make a living at that except to be a reporter . Then I found_out I could do it. &quot; Before long , Olney was back in California , at the Sacramento Bee , then switched to television , becoming the Sacramento bureau chief for a San Francisco TV_station . He says he loved TV -- at first : &quot; There was a different ethic at the time , more emphasis on reporting and what ' s the story . Reporters were asked what they had learned when they came_back rather than why didn ' t it turn_out the way the producer thought it was going_to look before you left . You could actually tell a story . A story of four minutes was not unusual . So I had a wonderful time . It ' s fun to make these little movies , you know , it really is . It ' s a kick. &quot; Olney went_to Washington to work for local stations , then returned to California in 1970 , ending_up in Los Angeles at Channel 2 in 1972 . &quot; Television anchoring was never my goal or particular interest . I just did_it because they paid you . It ' s advancement , and when you ' re in the business you want to advance . And I ' m enough of a performer , I suppose , that I enjoyed that aspect of it. &quot; He prefers not to discuss how much money he made in television , except to say that it was &quot; three or four times &quot; as much as he is making at KCRW , which in any case is paying him more_than the station has ever paid anyone , says Seymour , the general_manager . &quot; I made a lot , but I certainly did not ascend to the stratospheric heights that are current today , which I find obscene -- appalling , absolutely appalling . Again , as a reporter , how much do you need ? These guys are getting a_million bucks -- ( Paul ) Moyer and ( Jerry ) Dunphy . And , you know , there are a lot better ways to spend that money. &quot; * Olney , who lives near the border of Venice and the Marina , gets_to the station each day about 10:30 a.m. and takes a seat at a desk in a room with eight other desks , occupied by staff and volunteers . When he first came_to KCRW , Seymour recalls , &quot; I told him , ' I ' ll get you a desk , ' and he said , ' I don ' t need a desk. ' Where do you get a TV anchorman who says he doesn ' t need a desk ? He fit_in right away. &quot; On a recent morning he was dressed for work in loose khakis and a long-sleeve cotton blue shirt , unbuttoned at the neck and rolled_up to his forearms . His face is tanned and serious , but one thing you can ' t hear on the radio is the look of refined amusement that crinkles his features from time to time . He goes_over the day ' s program with producers Spitz , Stein and other aides . He ' s told what guests have been contacted , and he composes the day ' s news summary that he will read at the top of the hour . Olney , Seymour , Spitz and Stein meet about twice a week to brainstorm topics . Coming_up with four , five or six appropriate guests day after day can be a killing regimen . ( &quot; I don ' t know how he finds all these people , &quot; Yaroslavsky says. ) &quot; Incredible , &quot; says Olney , saluting his producers . &quot; Their achievement in doing this is not to be dismissed . I ' m not being modest when I say that. &quot; Sometimes the day ' s scheduled subject is pushed_aside for more pressing events , as when the verdicts in the Reginald O . Denny beating case were returned or the day of the Northridge earthquake . The show is done completely on the phone . There are never in-studio guests . &quot; We discovered that people are more candid on the phone , &quot; says producer Stein . &quot; Somehow they seem freer. &quot; Guests call_in from office phones , car phones and airport lounges . At least one , American Civil Liberties Union spokesman Allan Parachini , called from an airliner somewhere over Idaho . While he sits alone in the studio with his headphones , Olney faces a small computer monitor that connects him with Spitz and Stein , seated in another room working the phones and typing messages that tell him who ' s on-line and who ' s not . * His style has been likened to that of Ted Koppel of ABC ' s &quot; Nightline , &quot; but Olney doesn ' t seem to be imitating anyone , especially Koppel , whose self-importance can loom larger than his subjects . &quot; I see myself as what I ' ve always been , which is a reporter , essentially , &quot; Olney says . &quot; So what I ' m trying to do is get people to tell me what they think . I ' ll ask whatever question it takes_to get them to do that . that ' s what ' s satisfying to me . And I want to hear from people whose ideas I don ' t find compatible. &quot; He does not pre-interview the guests , preferring to take them as they come . &quot; In so many ways , it ' s similar to what I ' ve always done , &quot; he says . &quot; When I did interviews for television , I don ' t know that they ' ve been all that different from the kinds of interviews I ' ve done on the air , but you just didn ' t see them . Because you just take a little piece out of it. &quot; One difference on &quot; Which Way , L.A. ? &quot; is that Olney must function not just as a reporter but as someone who , in Stein ' s words , &quot; can really listen to people and facilitate interaction among them. &quot; The interaction can be mild or it can get tense , as it did on a recent show about the shooting of a Latino youth in Lynwood by a Korean grocer who told police the boy had stolen a bag of cookies . Guests included a Latino member of the Lynwood City_Council , Armando Rea , and a Korean American activist , Marsha Choo , who by the final 15 minutes of the show were shouting at each other . Olney did not make_peace between them , but with his own questions he succeeded in framing the dispute so that its different angles of interpretation were plain and palpable . There was a discussion of how the story had been played in The Times and on television . Angela Oh , a Korean attorney , came_on to mention that the English-language press had failed to notice that , in the last year , more_than 40 Korean store owners in Los Angeles had been shot , 19 fatally . It was not , in other words , the usual news . After the show , which he likens to taking a daily exam , Olney winds down by calling as_many of the guests as he can reach to thank them for appearing . He tends not to eat lunch , but snacks on a fruit_bar packed from home while he busies himself with thoughts about upcoming shows and stays around for a couple more hours . For relaxation he takes long walks on the beach . He recently learned how to play golf , but he ' s not sure he wants this known . &quot; It ' s such an imperialistic game , &quot; he says as an afterthought . He spends a lot of time with his wife , Marsha Temple , a lawyer and aspiring fiction writer , whom he remarried last year . The two met in 1972 when she was working for George S . McGovern ' s presidential campaign and Olney was covering it . They married in 1975 and divorced in 1983 . * &quot; Which Way , L.A. ? &quot; has become &quot; the 900-pound gorilla &quot; at KCRW , in_General Manager Seymour ' s words . A station once criticized for its lack of local news and public affairs is now harnessed to a show about Los Angeles that is its most expensive and ambitious undertaking ever -- made_possible with grants from GTE , the California Community Foundation and other donors , along with the station ' s 40 # 000 paying members . Two years after the riots , the show , like the city itself , has backed_away from the heat of those first fearful months , when the future seemed cast in ethnic hatreds and doom . The show ' s focus has broadened to include such topics as the war in Bosnia , the role of regents at the University of California , the assassination of Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio , &quot; the new nihilism , &quot; the press and the Whitewater affair and violence in motion_pictures . Olney concedes that the focus has changed somewhat , but he says emphatically that he believes the relevance of the program ' s title is not in danger . &quot; L.A. seems to represent the world . I can ' t think_of a subject except maybe arctic cold that would n ' t apply to L.A. It ' s the most exciting thing about it and the most daunting . There ' s no way we can stop being topical. &quot; As for the political temperature of the city , he says : &quot; I ' m not sure much has changed . People just aren ' t as mad about it at the moment . But you wonder when they might get mad again. &quot; He says that he is committed to the show for the foreseeable future and that he hopes to augment his salary with a number of video projects he plans to produce on the side . &quot; You don ' t get paid a lot for doing this . On the other hand , you have to decide what you want to do with your life . There frankly are not a lot of jobs -- I can ' t think_of any at the moment -- in local television that appeal_to me . This appeals_to me a lot . There ' s enormous freedom and independence . The value structure is different . &quot; Every once in a while somebody ( in TV ) says , ' Jesus , I wish I could do that ' -- although not too often . I don ' t want to ask why. &quot; * * &quot; Which Way , L.A. ? &quot; airs weekdays at 1 and 7 p.m. on KCRW-FM ( 89.9 ) , serving Los Angeles and Orange counties . The program can be heard in Ventura County on KCRU-FM ( 89.1 ) and in the Palm Springs area on KCRY-FM ( 89.3 ) . Information : ( 310 ) 450-5183 .</TEXT>
