   <HEADLINE> TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS : INSIGHT ; NEW PRODUCTS SERVE AS SIGNPOSTS TO THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I got that ISDN line I wrote_about in my last column , the one that ' s supposed to provide really fast communication between my computer and other people ' s . My company ' s computer people tell me it works . It just doesn ' t do anything when I try to use it . But I ' m feeling really wired anyway . The information highway is bursting_out all_over -- just not in the ways that most of the media write_about so glowingly . Consider these recent events in my digital life : * On Oct . 23 , President Clinton came_to speak at the high_school up the road from my house . The headline in our weekly newspaper , the San Carlos Belmont Enquirer Bulletin , read , &quot; White_House Catches Up With SC on the Internet. &quot; About six months before , San Carlos had put_up its first &quot; home page &quot; on the World Wide Web -- an easy-access way to publish documents on the ' Net . The White_House had just gotten_up its own home page the week before the Clinton visit . This is one of the wonderful subtleties of the information highway : A town with 28 # 000 people and a full-time staff of 75 can provide a service before the White_House can . What ' s the proper role of the federal_government if the Internet allows_for the kind of democracy in which economies of scale are a liability instead of an asset ? * The weekend the President came_to town , I played with a new product called XBand from Catapult Entertainment . Catapult calls it a video_game modem . XBand plugs into the Sega Genesis video_game machine and the telephone_line so you can play standard video_games with other people over the phone . You call Catapult toll-free and have the supplier match you up automatically with another player who has the same game cartridge plugged into his or her machine . I played several games of NBA Jam , first with Spiff from San Mateo and then with Aminal from San Rafael . I clearly have earned my computer nickname , Nerd Man . But when my 9-year-old son , Stewart III , joined me on line , we gave Aminal a run_for his money . ( XBand is supposed to be available in_stores later this month. ) * A few days later , I got my new version of America Online ( Version 2.5 ) , which is the hot on-line service these days . Loading the software on my computer , I noticed a new feature called TCP Connection -- something the people at the service haven ' t promoted . Using it means I can sign onto America Online through my company ' s Internet connection -- at speeds about 10 times as fast as with a fast modem , the devices most of us have been using to connect to on-line services for the last 10 years . When you start using commercial services at speeds like this , you see that you can do new and ever more interesting things . For instance , you can electronically browse through newspapers with real photographs and graphics or shop for products after studying high-resolution photographs and listening to a recorded explanation of the features of each model . * For the last few weeks , I have been carrying a Sony Magic Link , a new device Sony calls a personal communicator . In reality it is a small , under-powered computer that processes a new kind of animated electronic_mail ( courtesy of AT &amp; T ' s Personalink service ) and provides an address book , calendar , calculator , checkbook and other personal management features . ( It can also be used for remote_control of a Sony TV or stereo system. ) Magic Link is not wireless ; that technology is not ready for prime_time . It ' s designed to plug into any phone_line so you can collect and send mail toll-free . The screen is dim , there isn ' t enough storage , it ' s a little too big , it doesn ' t synchronize well with a personal_computer and the software needs more work . But the device does what it ' s supposed to , and it ' s really engaging . Bottom_line : I ' m using it . * I also got a new version ( Version 5.0 ) of Quicken , the checkbook program from Intuit , the company Microsoft is in the process of buying for a mere $ 1.5 billion . Now I can push a button called Quicken Quotes and the program will collect the current ( 15-minute delayed ) prices of stocks , bonds and mutual_funds I have listed and update the value of my portfolio automatically . I can then buy more shares by filling_out an electronic check , which Quicken delivers to Checkfree Corp . for forwarding to my brokerage_house . Intuit is working_on something called Quicken Online , a service that will let Quicken users integrate checking and savings account information , brokerage activity and credit_card accounts . In this way , you ' ll be able to manage all your personal finances in one place , plan for retirement , college and other things , produce and file tax_returns electronically and buy or sell equities and other financial instruments . No wonder Microsoft was so interested in Intuit ! No , I don ' t have my ISDN line doing anything yet . But I certainly do feel wired . The problem , of course , is that few of these things actually work with one another -- yet . Sometime shortly after 2000 , when they do -- and when my ISDN line or TV cable or satellite dish is the route for getting_to them -- I ' ll be all_the way up the on-ramp and cruising on the information highway .</TEXT>
