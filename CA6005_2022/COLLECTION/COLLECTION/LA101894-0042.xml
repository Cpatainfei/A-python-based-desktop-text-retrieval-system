   <HEADLINE> ELECTIONS / PROP . 187 ; OFFICIALS SEE HEALTH RISKS IN MEASURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ventura County public health officials on Monday denounced a statewide ballot initiative that would bar most health_care to illegal immigrants , calling it a reckless measure that could lead to epidemics of communicable_diseases . &quot; If we don ' t have the tools to deal with those people who are ill , we ' re not going_to be able to protect anybody ' s health , &quot; said Dr. Gary Feldman , the county ' s public health officer . &quot; The result is that we all suffer. &quot; Proposition 187 , which has become the center of an increasingly heated public_debate , would leave people more vulnerable to the spread of AIDS , tuberculosis , measles , hepatitis and other infectious_diseases , Feldman warned . &quot; These diseases don ' t ask anyone whether they ' re a legal resident or whether they have a green_card , &quot; Feldman said during a news_conference at the County Government Center in Ventura . &quot; Whomever they infect can transmit that illness throughout the community. &quot; But supporters of the measure said that illegal immigration continues to be one of the major problems facing the state , and pointed_out that opinion polls show voters favoring Proposition 187 by as much as 2 to 1 . &quot; I expect all_the usual suspects to come_out and scream and pound their chests &quot; against Proposition 187 , said Steve Frank , coordinator of the Ventura County campaign in support of the measure . &quot; But real people , the voters who are paying the bills , are not buying this gobbledygook . They ' re saying , ' If politicians won ' t take action , then we will. ' &quot; * In addition to non-emergency health_care , Proposition 187 would also bar education and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants and their children . With such a strong showing of public support for the measure , immigrant activists and local_government and school officials have begun their own campaigns to oppose the ballot initiative . The Ventura County Board of Supervisors , the county Board_of_Education and school_boards in Oxnard and Ventura have all passed resolutions opposing Proposition 187 . The board of the Simi Valley Unified School District will discuss the issue at its meeting tonight . And last week , hundreds of opponents of the initiative marched through the streets of Ventura to urge defeat of the ballot measure . A similar demonstration in Los Angeles on Sunday drew 70 # 000 people . Feldman and other county officials said Monday that their primary concern is the effect that Proposition 187 would have_on public health , particularly in preventing children from being immunized against polio , measles and other transmittable diseases . &quot; It ' s a real step backwards , &quot; said Dr. Barbara Thorpe , chairwoman of the county ' s Public Health Community Advisory Board . &quot; It ' s a regressive step for an enlightened society. &quot; * Thorpe added that it is much cheaper to prevent the spread of diseases , rather than to treat those who are already infected . &quot; What we ' re really doing is deferring the cost , &quot; she said . Joining Feldman and Thorpe at Monday ' s news_conference were school nurse Linda Butcher , who is also a member of the county ' s Public Health Community Advisory Board , and county Supervisor John K . Flynn . All of the officials agreed that something must be done to stem the tide of illegal immigration , but that Proposition 187 is not the answer . &quot; I think we should be legislating problems with immigration at our borders and not in our neighborhoods and communities , &quot; Butcher said .</TEXT>
