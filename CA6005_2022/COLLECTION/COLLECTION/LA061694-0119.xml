   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 DAILY REPORT ; ROTHENBERG GIVES WORLD A LESSON IN U.S. HISTORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alan Rothenberg , chief organizer of the World Cup ' s U.S. edition , borrowed from Abraham_Lincoln to assure officials of FIFA , soccer ' s world governing body , that the game has found a home_in the United States . At the opening of the 49th Congress of FIFA on Wednesday in Chicago , Rothenberg said , &quot; We want the people of the United States to embrace this beautiful game , &quot; adding that &quot; we are at the threshold of history. &quot; Then , quoting from Lincoln ' s Gettysburg Address , he said that &quot; people will little note nor long remember what we say here , but they will not forget what they did here. &quot; Delegates from 190 nations began a two-day meeting at which most of the issues already are decided . The highlight will be today ' s re-election -- unopposed and probably unanimous -- of Joao Havelange to a sixth term as FIFA president . * In Chicago , Fair Play Awards , designed by FIFA to promote sportsmanship and abolish rough tactics , went_to Nandor Hidegkuti , the Hungarian coach , player and administrator ; and the Zambian soccer federation , which almost qualified for the World Cup with a team put_together in weeks after the national team was killed in a plane crash . The Order of Merit , FIFA ' s highest individual award , went_to 10 people , including Gene Edwards of the United States and Norway ' s Gunn Nyborg for promoting women ' s soccer . * Chicago , which had greeted the event with a yawn earlier in the week , showed a little World Cup fever with a parade that featured festive native garb , mariachi musicians and soccer players dribbling balls_up a street lined with thousands of viewers in an eclectic mix of languages and cultures . Lest Chicagoans forget about the American_football that will remain when World Cup leaves , the grand marshal was former Bear star Walter Payton . * Visions of the World Cup generating $ 4 billion in the United States are vanishing . &quot; I absolutely believed it was going_to be the equivalent of nine Super Bowls -- much bigger than the Olympics , &quot; said Bob Solomon , chairman and chief_executive_officer of Dakin Inc. , a national purveyor of plush toys , key_rings , figurines and mugs . But while orders from big airports , duty-free shops and some hotels were encouraging , World Cup merchandise is in fewer than 5 # 000 stores nationwide , about 25 % of the number of stores that carry &quot; Flintstones &quot; or &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; merchandise . The bottom_line is sales of $ 5 million , one-fifth as much as during the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics . * The referee for Saturday ' s U.S.-Switzerland game at Pontiac , Mich. , will be Francisco Lamolina of Argentina . Fabio Baldas of Italy will be the referee for the U.S.-Colombia game Wednesday at the Rose Bowl . * A Belgian mainstay fell victim to the 95-degree heat of Orlando , Fla. , where his team scored a 6-0 victory over the U.S. under-23 team . Absent after halftime was midfielder Lorenzo Staelens , last season ' s most_valuable_player in the Belgian league , who remained in the locker_room suffering from dizziness . The Soccer Expert Colombia ' s Express Colombia is the clear favorite to win Group_A , which includes the United States . With the wizardry of midfielder Carlos Valderrama , the scoring prowess of forward Faustino Asprilla and the goalkeeping of Oscar Cordoba , the team is considered capable of winning the title . Colombia lines_up in what appears to be a 4-2-2-2 to take_advantage of the talents of Valderrama and Asprilla . Source : Times staff</TEXT>
