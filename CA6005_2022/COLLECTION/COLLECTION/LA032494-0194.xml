   <HEADLINE> SCIENTISTS DEFEND OCEAN NOISE TESTS ; ENVIRONMENT : TRANSMISSION OF SOUNDS WILL BE HALTED IF THERE ARE SIGNS OF HARM TO MARINE MAMMALS , SCRIPPS INSTITUTION OFFICIALS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scientists seeking to transmit loud sounds through the Pacific_Ocean to measure global warming defended their experiment Wednesday , insisting that the noise would not deafen whales and pledging to halt the project if it appeared to be causing harm . &quot; We are not out_to harm a single whale with these underwater sounds , &quot; said David Hyde , director of the research project at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego . &quot; We will cease sound transmissions to avoid harm to marine mammals. &quot; The controversial experiment , which could begin as early as next month , would broadcast a high-volume , low-frequency rumbling sound for 20 minutes , six times a day , from the ocean_floor off Big Sur and Kauai , Hawaii . The sound would be detected at U.S. Navy listening posts in the ocean as far as 10 # 000 miles away . Some whale experts have charged that the unusual project could deafen or damage the hearing of acoustically sensitive marine mammals and have sought to block a federal permit needed for the study . But Scripps scientists said the experiment is essential to learn if the ocean ' s temperature is rising -- a phenomenon they say would pose a far greater risk to marine life than the loud sounds broadcast during what they hope will be a 10-year experiment . The researchers also said they have included in the project a comprehensive study of marine mammals near the broadcast sites to determine if the noise is disturbing the whales or driving them from the area . &quot; We are an environmental research project and we are sensitive to environmental concerns , particularly with_respect_to marine mammals , &quot; Hyde said . &quot; We share that concern with our critics. &quot; Project leaders acknowledged that Scripps had done little to prepare the public for the experiment and said they were caught off_guard by a sudden outpouring of opposition to the federally funded project . Scripps scientists did not respond to The Times ' requests earlier this week for interviews . Responding to calls from constituents , both California senators , Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer , urged the National Marine Fisheries Service on Tuesday to move cautiously in approving the experiment . But Andrew Forbes , the project ' s deputy director , blamed poorly informed marine mammal experts for irresponsibly alarming the public with misconceptions . The sound would be broadcast at 75 hertz , which is at the low end of the range of human hearing but may_not even be audible to many marine mammal species , Hyde said . Transmitted from loudspeakers about 900 meters deep , the initial volume of 195 decibels would quickly drop as the sound travels away . Only an animal within 200 meters of the sound source would suffer ear damage , Hyde said . To warn animals away , the sound would be turned_up gradually for the first five minutes of each 20-minute broadcast . Also of concern to whale researchers is the possibility that the frequent transmission could alter the behavior of endangered marine mammals , reduce feeding or reproduction , or drive them from the area . Whales are known to change their behavior in response to noises of 120 decibels . Hyde said the experiment ' s transmission would be heard at that volume or higher within a 30-mile radius of the sound source , potentially affecting 677 # 000 marine mammals near California that live or travel through the area off Big Sur . But the scientists said their noise would not be as loud as other sounds that pollute the ocean , including the engine noise of large ships , explosions detonated during oil exploration and naval activities .</TEXT>
