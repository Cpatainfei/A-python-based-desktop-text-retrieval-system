   <HEADLINE> BEAUTY BY THE YARD ; ACCESSORIES FOR THE GARDEN ARE GETTING ARTSIER AND BIGGER -- MUCH BIGGER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Say the words yard art and property values plummet . For many , they connote cast-iron lawn jockeys and ceramic sombrero-wearers in a siesta pose , both terribly passe and politically incorrect . The decorated yard got a bad reputation when overzealous practitioners refused to stop with just one gewgaw and filled their landscapes with bunnies , burros and wishing_wells . Excess gave the movement a bad name , and in the ' 60s these tchotchkes joined Elvis on velvet in the kitsch closet of the art world . Anything even slightly reeking of the stench of yard art was relegated for several decades to the rear aisles of garden shops . But if Pucci prints and boomerang-shaped tables can come_around again , so can yard art . It ' s back in a ' 90s kind of culturally sensitive , environmentally considerate and , in some cases , quite whimsical way . Landscape designers call this new incarnation the &quot; garden ornament &quot; ( probably looks classier on the invoice ) , and they are using large , stately , often pricey pieces in some of the finest back yards in town . And in the two- or three-figure realm , stores that specialize in garden supplies are dragging their decorative bird feeders , fountains and ceramic bovines up front , within sight of the cash_registers . Garden art is being reintroduced because it adds drama , texture and color . It can be colossally extravagant or incredibly modest . It can be the focal_point or a hidden treasure . One of the most notable aspects of the new yard art is its scale . Landscape_architect Mia Lehrer of Lehrer Architects and BLS Design in Los Angeles has decorated yards with urns that stand taller than an NBA forward , and stone balls the size of weather balloons . &quot; The sense of scale has changed a lot , &quot; she says . Often , the new outdoor art is combined with water and lighting to perform a dual function . In the Pacific Palisades back yard of Charles Eglee and Ninkey Dalton , landscape_architect Robert Steiner placed a ceramic pot pond-side and plumbed it for a fountain . Glazed a brilliant orange , the pot matches the slippery koi that circle beneath . And Los Angeles architect Mark Rios of Rios Associates designed massive stone urns with portals of light for a Brentwood home . Rios has also created outdoor furniture that borders_on the sculptural , such_as a long , undulating bright yellow bench for a large garden with a huge expanse of lawn . &quot; A lot of our product design came_about because of deficiencies in the marketplace . Garden furniture was boring , &quot; says Rios , who is making more of the caterpillar benches to keep_up with demand . * Some of the custom-made pieces are more humble . For another client ' s vegetable_garden , Rios created a bean pole shaped like an oil derrick . On top of the derrick twirls a metal carrot-shaped wind_vane , and on top of the carrot is a spigot capable of watering the entire garden . But such fanciful pieces are rare . Few , it seems , have the nerve to decorate their lawns with bowling_balls instead of specimen plants , as record producer Allie Willis has done_in Studio City . Or to turn their front_yards into shrines to Snow White , as Robert Cohen , a senior_vice_president of Paramount Pictures who lives_in Venice , has done . &quot; Snow White , of course , represents the eventual and inevitable triumph of love over evil , always so important an object_lesson to hold onto when dealing with Hollywood agents , &quot; he says . One proponent of the nothing-is-sacred approach is Jay Griffith . The yard surrounding his Venice landscape design office is littered with treasures just waiting for the right home . &quot; It ' s a roiling , boiling cesspool of garden ornament , &quot; Griffith says proudly of his collection . Among the prized possessions is a three-dimensional gold arrow the size of a subcompact car and a shed-sized Aladdin ' s lamp from a movie_theater . Both are wired for lights -- again , dual-purpose yard art . For his own garden , Griffith is creating a life-sized rendition of the Mad Hatter ' s tea_party . In the back yard of his neighbors , graphic designers Charles Bennett and Kathleen Cornell , Griffith fashioned a 20-foot-tall stage . Iron beams support curtains made of pleated wire netting with a swag of brass screen . Bougainvillea climbs the wings . Rolling around the lawn is a disco mirror ball . And off to the east , in a shady corner of the palm court , is a treasure_chest that hints of a pirate ' s plunder . * For yard-art enthusiasts who prefer to do their own decorating , contemporary versions of classic garden ornaments can be had at retail_stores . And large but simply shaped fountains , bells and gongs by Washington state artist Tom Torrens are sold at Armstrong ' s , the Home and Garden Place in West Los Angeles . &quot; I ' ve always liked doing things for outdoor use . I like the functional overtones of adding sound , and therefore I do a lot of ringing devices , bells and gongs , &quot; says Torrens , once a gallery-represented sculptor . Taking his work from the galleries and placing it in the back yard proved to be lucrative . &quot; It opened_up a wide range of markets when we went from the gallery , which was austere and intimidating to the more public aspect of yard art . With the added functionalism , the pieces were no longer considered fine_art , but moved closer to a craft. &quot; There is a stigma attached_to outdoor artworks , which may explain why the retail market is lacking in well-designed pieces . And , who knows , in a_few years , today ' s oversized urns may join Elvis in the closet , or bob for years in Griffith ' s cesspool . But for now , they are having a glorious moment in the sun .</TEXT>
