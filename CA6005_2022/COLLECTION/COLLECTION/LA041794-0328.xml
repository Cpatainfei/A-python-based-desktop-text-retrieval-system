   <TEXT> The sky is cloudless and the summer sun is scorching . Thousands of blacks have packed a soccer stadium in Maokeng , a dusty sprawl of matchbox homes and tin-roofed shanties . Beside the field , a crowd is squashed inside a chain-link fence , and crying children are passed back over a sea of heads to safety . Other people hang_on trees and fences , or cling_to lampposts . The rickety stands are jammed , and above them on the roof , dozens of youths are doing the toyi-toyi , the stomping , high-kicking dance of liberation . Suddenly , half the tin roof rips and collapses , dumping shrieking dancers onto the people and benches below . Wailing ambulances and honking trucks soon carry 30 bruised and bloodied people to the hospital . The survivors simply move onto the other half of the roof and the frenzied war_dance continues . Then pandemonium sweeps the stadium . Nelson Mandela is approaching ! The next president ! Perched in the back of a pickup_truck , the legendary leader of the African National Congress waves and grins as the ecstatic mob surges around his feet . Their hands reach up , hoping for a touch ; one grizzled , gray-haired man appears to weep at the sight . &quot; He is like a god , &quot; the man says before he is swept_away in the crush of the crowd . As Mandela mounts the stage , they wave their fists and roar in delight . Amandla ! Power ! Mandela tells of his last visit to this township outside Kroonstad in January , 1952 . &quot; I collided_with a young boy on his bicycle , a white boy , with my car . He wasn ' t hurt , but I stopped my car . A drunk police_sergeant , a white_man , came up. &quot; He switches from English to Afrikaans for the punch-line . &quot; He said , ' Kaffir , I ' m gonna make you shit ! ' I said , ' Sergeant , when I do that , I don ' t need instructions from a drunken white sergeant. ' I was expecting to be assaulted , the coward that I am . But it seemed to deflate him . And that made me braver. &quot; A broad grin crinkles his face as wild cheers and laughter echo across the township . Another day , another rally , this one halfway across the country : President Frederik W . de Klerk also rides a pickup into a raggedy soccer stadium , his bald head glinting in the sun . He ' s in Postdene , a mixed-race township outside Kimberley . Many mixed-race voters are sympathetic to De Klerk ' s ruling National Party , if only because they fear they will suffer under black rule . Unlike Mandela , De Klerk has no raised stage , no portable toilets , no giant banners , no tall banks of booming speakers . His voice is tinny , rasping through small speakers set_on the small truck ' s hood . The crowd , perhaps a_few hundred people , is wary , surly , nervous . A few hold small flags , but the president is met in stony silence . His security men are jittery . Something is wrong . Then , chaos . Several dozen blacks with ANC posters run_across the field straight for De Klerk . They rip down a National Party banner , then grab and shred posters and paper flags . A wild shoving match ensues beside the truck . A plainclothes cop grabs a protester ' s shirt and yanks a knife away . &quot; Don ' t touch me , &quot; the man screams . De Klerk scowls as hecklers drown him out with ANC chants . A hail of stones and wadded-up paper fills the air and something hits the president under his left ear . He flinches , more in surprise than pain , but bravely stays erect behind a tight circle of bodyguards as the truck lurches away . &quot; Goodby , De Klerk , goodby ! &quot; jeers the laughing crowd . &quot; Away , De Klerk , away ! &quot; Moments later , armored vehicles rumble in with flak-jacketed riot police clutching assault_rifles . The crowd scatters , pounding De Klerk ' s motorcade with their fists and pelting photographers with stones . Police deploy outside the township entrance with snarling dogs and huge coils of razor wire . A black organizer for the aborted rally is terrified to go_home . &quot; I ' m not safe there , &quot; he says , pleading for a place to sleep , a place to hide . De Klerk tells the press afterward , &quot; We will not cringe , we will not run away. &quot; Later , an aide scouts the site of the day ' s final rally in a nearby black township . He comes_back breathless . A white_man , the son of a local National Party leader , has emptied a pistol into another mob of stone-throwing protesters , killing a black_woman . De Klerk cancels the rally . With South_Africa ' s First Free Elections Only Days Away , the country is a tense , tenuous place , unsure whether it is headed for war or peace . The past is riven with hate , suffering and the bitter divisions of apartheid . The present is filled with violence , intimidation and fear . And the future is a dream of multiracial democracy . When balloting starts April 26 , the black majority will vote and run their own country for the first time since Dutch merchant Jan van Riebeeck built the initial white settlement at Cape_Town in 1652 and started a legacy of harsh white rule . Although the official , enforced segregation of races has ended , South_Africa remains a land of separate and unequal societies . The 5.1 million whites dominate 30.6 million blacks , 3.4 million &quot; Colored , &quot; or mixed race , and 1 million Indians . Under apartheid , blacks were denied citizenship , decent schooling or health_care . Millions were confined to squalid reservations called homelands . The rest lived_in townships , usually sprawling slums and smoke-filled shantytowns with no electricity , running water or paved roads . Most blacks still live_in those appalling conditions . Nearly half have no formal job , and cannot read or write . Black incomes are barely one-tenth those of whites . Black infant_mortality is eight times that of whites . One in 20 black children dies before age 5 . In November , a typhoid epidemic affected more_than 1 # 500 blacks in the squatter camp of Botleng . Less than an hour from downtown Johannesburg , Botleng has no sewage_system , simply buckets that are dumped on rotting garbage_heaps . The roads are ankle-deep in mire and muck . Drinking water comes from rusty street taps or muddy puddles . Two miles away stands the posh white town of Delmas , with manicured lawns , tree-shaded streets and BMWs . It also has a hospital that refused to admit typhoid-stricken black children , shipping them to another medical facility 20 miles away . But profound change is coming . The government is beginning to return land to blacks who were removed at gunpoint from their farms and dumped in desolate areas because their property was a &quot; black spot &quot; in &quot; white areas. &quot; Schools and neighborhoods are slowly , reluctantly , opening their doors . State media is no longer the government mouthpiece . And most important , history is about to be reversed . The whites who have ruled with racial tyranny are about to hand power over to blacks who were mostly in prison or in exile only four years ago . Even more astonishing , the ANC and the National Party , black_and_white , are delivering black liberation through a &quot; negotiated revolution , &quot; not all-out war . Mandela is virtually certain to win and win big . ANC polls show a solid base of 55 % , but the vote could go much higher . For the 16 million to 18 million blacks who are expected to cast ballots for the first time , the election is not about who offers the best housing or fiscal_policies . The largest poll ever done here -- sponsored by the Matla Trust , the nation ' s largest voter-education group -- was clear on that much . &quot; What was the most important reason to vote ? Freedom ! &quot; says poll director Susan Booysen , analyzing the results of interviews with more_than 8 # 000 people . &quot; Freedom was more important than jobs , better government , or a better life. &quot; The hard part , of course , comes_after the voting . Except for race , little here is black_and_white . Just as communism suppressed ethnic tensions in Eastern Europe for 40 odd years , apartheid overshadowed other animosities here . The new South_Africa promises to be a pressure_cooker of racial , ethnic and political tensions , with schisms between black_and_white , rich and poor , urban and rural and , of course , black and black . Bitter grievances between the two largest tribes , the Zulus and Xhosas , over issues of land , cattle , power and politics , have fueled a savage spiral of violence over the last four years . So have battles between rival groups of Zulus . Rogue police officials , seeking to weaken the ANC , have contributed to the carnage . At least 15 # 000 people -- nearly all_of them black -- have been burned , shot or hacked to death since 1990 . The murder rate in what Mandela calls the world ' s most violent country is 10 times that of America . &quot; The only certainty about the situation is that the system of apartheid will go , &quot; says Colin Eglin , a leader of the tiny Democratic Party . &quot; The uncertainty is what kind of system will be put_in its place. &quot; Minefields already abound . A low-intensity civil_war is raging between ANC supporters and their rivals in the Inkatha Freedom Party in Zulu strongholds of Natal province . More_than 290 people were killed and hundreds wounded there last month , a sad new record that forced the government to declare a province-wide state of emergency . The powerful Zulu leader , Chief Mangosuthu G . Buthelezi , who heads both Inkatha and the KwaZulu homeland , wants greater local autonomy . Prickly and petulant , he has sworn to boycott the elections , ignore the constitution and fight an ANC-dominated regime . So has a motley alliance of rabid white racists . It is easy to ridicule blustering bullies and buffoons like Eugene Terre ' Blanche ( headline writers call him E.T. ) , head of the neo-fascist Afrikaner Resistance Movement , and their belligerent demands for a secessionist white state . It ' s not so easy to ignore their threats to wreck the election and sabotage the new black-led government . Their claim of 60 # 000 ready-to-fight supporters is absurd , but a handful of dedicated terrorists can create havoc . Witness Northern_Ireland . And many blacks fear the consequences of unfulfilled political promises . Mandela is partly to blame . Although he routinely warns against &quot; exaggerated expectations , &quot; he also vows that &quot; each and every person would be entitled to housing like the whites have now. &quot; At each rally , he dutifully repeats the ANC ' s ambitious platform : to build 1 million homes , to create 2.5 million jobs , to provide electric_power for 2.5 million homes , to guarantee 10 years of free schooling and free health_care for children and much , much more . Laudable goals , of course . But realistic ? Not any time soon . &quot; For us to turn the country around , it will take decades and decades , &quot; warns Tokyo Sexwale , a regional ANC leader . Olga Chauke , a young black_woman who runs voter education workshops in the western Transvaal , agrees . &quot; People think after the election , they ' ll get big houses and a Mercedes-Benz . And people believe that ! I blame the politicians . They lie to the people. &quot; Several scenarios are possible after democracy finally dawns in the world ' s most racially polarized country . The first , discussed endlessly in the press and nervously at dinner_parties , is apocalypse . It goes like this : Backed by white army_officers , right-wing terror squads sabotage power_stations , bomb factories and assassinate black leaders . The bloodletting in Natal erupts into wholesale slaughter . Angry young blacks riot in the cities and leafy white suburbs , seeking new homes , cars and revenge . Wealthy whites flee , the civil_service crumbles , foreign investors stay home and Africa ' s largest and strongest economy collapses . The next scenario is less pessimistic . The ANC wins a landslide , taking two-thirds of the vote . They run_roughshod over political foes in the so-called government of national unity . Security_forces crack_down on black_and_white extremists , jailing thousands without trial and declaring a state of emergency . The Communist_Party , the ANC ' s longtime partner , asserts itself with a vengeance , and the government nationalizes mines , banks and factories . After four decades of oppressive rule by the white National Party , authoritarian blacks in the ANC take_charge . Yet another version is more hopeful . Pride and exhilaration sweep the land after a huge election turnout . Vote-related violence is localized and doesn ' t derail the May 10 inauguration . President Mandela ' s pleas for racial tolerance and peace are respected . Security_forces stay loyal , and white extremists are marginalized into small hate groups , like the Ku Klux Klan . A majority of Zulus vote ANC , and turmoil subsides in Natal . A Constitutional Court keeps the new rulers in check . Foreign investors , governments and international agencies pump in billions to show support . The first McDonald ' s opens . The last scenario , or some version of it , seems the most probable . Time and time again since De Klerk released Mandela from 27 years in prison in 1990 , launching the nation on the bloodstained path to democracy , South_Africa has teetered on the brink of catastrophe -- and turned_back . The country is resilient and the center has held . It may take generations , as it has in America , for hate-filled minds to change , for decent schools and jobs programs to take_hold , and for real opportunities to emerge . And as in America , bitter battles lie ahead in small_towns and local school_boards . But barring an unforeseen disaster , the birth of the new South_Africa stands a good chance of succeeding . Dressed in a glittering tuxedo , with a thin mustache and a fast patter , Aubrey Welsch is teaching South_Africa how to vote . Welsch hosts a new Saturday night TV quiz show called &quot; It ' s Your Vote ! &quot; It offers &quot; fabulous prizes , &quot; a catchy jingle and Jessica , the ever-smiling assistant in a black sequined minidress . Mike , a plumber , is the contestant tonight . The first question : How many people are allowed to enter a voting_booth ? Mike ponders the possible answers ( no limit , one or three ) , and the prizes ( a refrigerator , microwave or video_game gadget ) before venturing &quot; one. &quot; Then come more questions about voting procedures . Finally , Welsch turns_to five &quot; voters &quot; from the studio audience . Each must mark a ballot on whether they think Mike ' s answers are correct . &quot; It ' s a secret vote , &quot; Welsch says , then turns_to the camera . &quot; that ' s right , folks , the vote is totally secret . So Mike won ' t know who voted for him . But he has to accept the vote . And it ' ll be the same in the elections . Your vote will be totally secret . And whichever party wins , everyone has to accept it . that ' s democracy ! &quot; Television otherwise plays a small role in this election -- political ads have been banned so rich parties can ' t dominate the airwaves . And most of the 100 or so other voter education programs are more mundane . Unions , churches , factories and non-governmental groups hold mock elections and training sessions to teach people to vote who have never voted before . It ' s a critical task . Experts fear that millions of votes may be accidentally invalidated , undermining the legitimacy of the final tally and the authority of the new government . Many of the uneducated rural voters may be too frightened , or too confused , to mark the ballot correctly . It ' s easy to see why . South_Africa ' s first free elections are not simple . Some 26 parties are running . The ballot for the 400-seat National Assembly alone will be longer than a newspaper page . Each of the nine new provinces will have a separate second ballot for their provincial assemblies . Many of the parties are brand-new and virtually unknown , and one is so poor its phones were recently disconnected for lack of payment . But under a system of proportional_representation , any party could win a seat or two . And any party that wins 5 % of the total vote will be guaranteed a place in the Cabinet of the new government of national unity . Win 20 % and you get_to be a deputy president . Fabulous prizes ! The Independent Electoral Commission is in_charge . The 16-member panel must certify if the election is &quot; substantially free and fair , &quot; a term that clearly covers a lot of ground . The chairman , Judge Johann Kriegler , outlined the still-evolving election plans over lunch recently . Up to 300 # 000 workers and monitors will be assigned to 9 # 000 polling_stations . Another 1 # 800 United Nations monitors , plus more_than 1 # 000 international observers , will watch for trouble and fraud . Countless volunteers are coming from colleges , churches and peace groups around the world . So are 10 chartered jumbo jets loaded with 80 million ballots being printed in England , enough so no polling_station runs_out . Officials say no single South_African printing_company could ensure production , delivery or security for such a large_order . Unlike most countries , South_Africa has prepared no voters ' roll , so the 22.7 million eligible voters can go_to any polling_station anywhere in the country . Voters ' hands will be dipped in ink that shows under ultraviolet_light to ensure no one votes twice . The voting itself will take three days . To maintain security , the army and police have canceled leaves and called_up reservists . Virtually every police_officer and soldier in the country will be assigned to guard against intimidation at the polls or to ride shotgun when the sealed ballot_boxes are moved overnight to local jail_cells or bank_vaults . The boxes will finally go_to 90 # 000 &quot; enumerators &quot; at 1 # 091 counting posts -- one for every 10 polling_stations -- so no one will know how a single community voted . &quot; We fear reprisals , &quot; Kriegler says . &quot; We ' ve told people ' your vote is secret. ' What if we then announce you ' re the only ANC village in , say , an Inkatha zone ? &quot; The same fear has led the electoral commission to ban exit polls , even by foreign TV networks . &quot; We ' ve told people , ' No one can ever know how you voted and your vote is secret , &quot; ' he says . &quot; And then you come_out of your voting station and there ' s a man , a white_man at that , with a foreign accent , asking_for whom you voted . We ' d be a laughingstock given all_the promises we made. &quot; Tom Lodge , a political_scientist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg , takes a caustic view of all this . If the ANC meets its goal of winning 67 % of the vote , Lodge notes , it will have the legal majority in Parliament . It could then rewrite the current interim constitution without considering the concerns of smaller parties , among other things . Lodge finds that prospect worrisome : &quot; Remember , the ANC is a relatively recent convert to liberal democracy. &quot; But so are nervous whites like Cornelis Serfontein , a lanky 48-year-old farmer in the right-wing stronghold of Potchefstroom . Like many of the 3 million Afrikaners , descendants of the early Dutch and French pioneers , he is caught in a dilemma . He has lived his entire life in a land where white power , prestige and privilege were guaranteed . He served 15 years as local vice_chairman of the National Party , presiding during the most brutal years of the apartheid era . But , like his country , he has changed . He resigned his party post recently , and his story pours_out of him with passion and pain . &quot; The more enlightened Afrikaner is caught between the right-wing forces , &quot; Serfontein says . &quot; And if you move to the left , you ' re in danger . If I stand_up today in Afrikaner company and say I am leaning toward the ANC , I ' m totally cut_off and isolated . And my children are intimidated . You must look_after your family . We have nowhere to go . Make no mistake . We ' re born and bred South Africans. &quot; He pauses , then adds , &quot; The National Party has had no opposition since 1948 . There was a lot of corruption . We can ' t argue that away . We always say look_at corruption in the rest of black_Africa . But the corruption here was only more refined . It ' s unreal what we have done to our country. &quot; He grows quiet as several whites pass_on the street , then resumes . &quot; I can say I probably won ' t vote for the ANC . But I can see in the future , when I see how they run the economy , then I might . I want to see a better standard_of_living for everybody. &quot; Perhaps 3 # 000 people attend the Feb . 2 kickoff of the national Party campaign . They fill the hangar-like hall at the World Trade Center outside Johannesburg , where the interim constitution was adopted and signed last December after exhausting , exciting round-the-clock talks . Tonight , however , the hall has all_the thrill of a physics lecture . Delegates and party workers sit stiffly at long tables , quietly waiting for something to start . Several hundred mixed-race supporters pack the back of the hall . But the majority of the non-revelers are the red-faced , overfed Afrikaners that the party has long attracted . A six-man , all-white brass_band blares &quot; When the Saints Go Marching In. &quot; A black preacher suddenly takes_the_stage . &quot; Viva De Klerk ! Viva ! &quot; he shouts several times , thrusting his fist into the air . The audience looks nervous -- &quot; viva &quot; is a standard ANC chant . A few shout back , but the chants are stillborn . Still , it is nothing to what follows . The band pulls_out new sheet_music , and lyrics flash on giant screens at the front of the hall . And then it begins , an excruciating attempt in the name of national unity to sing &quot; Nkosi Sikelel ' i Afrika , &quot; the call-and-response hymn that has become Africa ' s chief liberation anthem . Sung at every ANC rally , it is a haunting tune that thunders out of stadiums and echoes across the townships . Every black schoolchild knows the words . Here , the audience struggles to read the Xhosa words on the oversized cue cards and follow a tune that the band , clearly unfamiliar_with the music , tries to play with a polka beat . Later I mention this incident with a laugh to one of De Klerk ' s advisers . He sighs . &quot; People are in shock , &quot; he says . &quot; You have to remember Afrikaners come from a religious culture where public dancing was frowned_upon . They ' re staid , conservative , very disciplined and organized . And they ' re uncomfortable with all this public stuff. &quot; Jan Bosman , another aide , agrees . &quot; The National Party is more used_to City_Hall meetings , with all_the people sitting_down , all very dressed_up and polite , &quot; he says . &quot; You started with a prayer , had a long-winded address by the president , then tea and cookies . All very formal and polite . And , of course , all white. &quot; Of course . And that ' s the problem . First elected in 1948 , the National Party invented and institutionalized apartheid and used every power of a police_state , including torture and murder , to enforce its dictums . It still has all_the powers of the state -- cars , phones , police and the_like . But it can ' t hope to win enough votes to become a respectable opposition party unless it can appeal_to the people who have the most reason to resent them -- blacks . Polls show black support for De Klerk in the low single digits . As a result , De Klerk ' s uphill campaign is more interesting in some ways than Mandela ' s . As a fourth-generation Afrikaner politician , De Klerk is member of a family that was partly responsible_for the horrors of apartheid . No one expected him to be different . The young lawyer went_to Parliament in 1972 and quickly joined the verkrampte , or hard-line wing of the party . As education minister in the mid-1980s , he never publicly questioned the policy of providing only substandard schools for blacks . To this day , he has never said apartheid was wrong , only that it didn ' t work and he ' s sorry_for the misery it caused . But De Klerk ' s nobler side began to show after his party narrowly elected him president in August , 1989 . &quot; Our goal is a totally changed South_Africa , &quot; he said when he took_office . Six months later , he released Mandela from prison , legalized the ANC and other black opposition parties and began official desegregation . The uncertain march from apartheid to democracy had begun . The next few years saw tortuous on-again , off-again negotiations between the ANC , the government and 24 other parties . The result has been not only the new constitution , but a black-dominated transitional executive_council that has become a virtual shadow government . Today , De Klerk , 58 , remains far more popular than his party . So he tells voters that he heads the &quot; new National Party. &quot; There ' s a new slogan ( &quot; We ' ve made the change ! &quot; ) , a new logo and flag ( the pastel design was reviewed by traditional black witch_doctors ) and a new message of atonement . They even hired spin_doctors , Lowe Bell Communications , whose London-based directors have advised leaders from Margaret Thatcher to Billy Graham . The consultants studied election returns from other African_countries . They commissioned focus groups , opinion surveys , heavy media buys and tracking polls . The results ? A majority of blacks think the party is still all white and still in favor of apartheid . And something else . &quot; There was a perception that De Klerk lived_in an ivory_tower , that he was strait-laced , that he had no understanding or concern for the way poor people lived , &quot; says Chris Fismer , a senior aide . &quot; It was not true , but that was the perception. &quot; Enter a new De Klerk , clad in polo_shirts instead of suits , and ever willing to pose with tribal robes , spears and shields . At a seaside lunch of grilled lobsters at Lambert ' s Bay , aides huddle as the relaxed , open-collar candidate drinks a glass of red_wine and smokes a Lexington cigarette . The aides decide that he should sit on a rough-hewn log , with his back to the white-capped ocean , for a news_conference . &quot; Make him look_like a man of the people , all that stuff , &quot; one says . I ask if it really matters , given the party ' s other problems . &quot; Most people don ' t care , &quot; he replies with a laugh . &quot; We could put him up against a skull_and_crossbones and people would n ' t care. &quot; But De Klerk cares . &quot; There ' s a request for a photo opportunity , &quot; he says after the news_conference . &quot; Does_it still exist ? &quot; The photographers , of course , say yes . So De Klerk strides to the water ' s edge . He dips his hand in the surf and stares pensively out_to sea . After a moment , he slowly turns and walks down the lonely sand . The cameras click furiously . &quot; Enough ? &quot; he asks . It is reminiscent_of the famous photo of Richard Nixon walking the beach in his wingtips . De Klerk has taken several tips from Nixon ' s handbook . He appeals_to the &quot; silent majority &quot; in his speeches , isn ' t above packing his crowds with government workers and plainclothes security men and is running a law-and-order campaign . He demonizes the ANC as &quot; secretly controlled by Communists , militants and extremists &quot; dedicated to using violence . It ' s a tricky strategy . For one thing , De Klerk has spent the last four years trying to convince terrified whites that Mandela and the ANC can be trusted . The other problem is he ' s at least partly right : angry black protesters try to disrupt nearly every township rally he holds . He ' s been spit on , shoved and shouted_down . I join De Klerk as he barnstorms a dozen forlorn farming and fishing towns in a desolate , wind-swept area of the Western Cape . South_Africa is almost twice the size of Texas , and here the landscape has the same rolling hills , dusty plains and vast emptiness with two-lane blacktops stretching to the horizon . Mixed-race voters predominate , and polls show many are undecided . So at each stop , De Klerk fans fears of blacks and Communists , then promises that he will stand_up to the ANC . &quot; They burn houses and destroy schools , &quot; he says . &quot; They are the breakers . We are the builders. &quot; And at nearly each stop , young ANC protesters oblige by ruining his rallies . The first stop is in Atlantis , built_on empty sand dunes 18 years ago for mixed-race families forced_out of Cape_Town by the mad social engineers of apartheid . About 40 ANC protesters chant and boo as De Klerk shouts to be heard inside a small hall . &quot; I think it ' s a disgrace he wants to enter this town , &quot; complains Rachel Visser , a local ANC activist . &quot; They forced us to live here . We don ' t have money for food , our schools don ' t have books and now the factories are closing . And he wants our vote. &quot; But Diane Cupido , a 29-year-old unemployed woman , proudly holds a De Klerk poster nearby . &quot; The reason I support the National Party is blacks want to take revenge , &quot; she says . &quot; They all went_to prison and now they want revenge. &quot; By the fourth stop , at a street rally in tiny Vredenburg , dozens of blacks have gathered to dance and shout . Beefy security men lock arms to try to hold them back . &quot; Go_to hell , De Klerk , &quot; the mob chants , drowning_out his speech . Finally , they rush his sound_truck . An armored personnel_carrier quickly rumbles up and an all-white squad of riot police jumps_out with shotguns , assault_rifles and tear_gas . The crowd eyes them nervously as De Klerk ' s BMW drives_off . Then shouts echo up the street . A police_van in the convoy has clipped a protester , then sideswiped a photographer ' s car . The driver never stopped . An angry crowd quickly surrounds the black hit-and-run victim . &quot; They ' ve killed him ! They ' ve killed him ! &quot; one woman shouts hysterically . Pushing closer , I can see the man on his back , but he ' s talking and in no obvious discomfort . An ambulance quickly carts him off . Both sides , it seems , are satisfied . The local ANC gets a martyr , another black victim of white brutality . And De Klerk gets another picture in the paper of dangerous ANC intimidation . ANC strategy , in contrast , seems simple : blame others for the violence , rein_in its hooligans and convince voters , and the world , that it is ready to govern a nation of 40 million people with a giant economy and an untested constitution . &quot; We must behave as people who are fit to govern , &quot; Mandela told a recent rally in Kimberly , &quot; people who have a sense of responsibility. &quot; So the ANC uses advertisements and rallies to underscore the message that the former revolutionary movement and guerrilla army is , indeed , prepared . Each week , it runs full-page newspaper_ads with detailed plans to build schools , homes and communities . Stanley Greenberg oversees the ANC polls and communication strategy when he isn ' t working for his other chief client , President Clinton . I ask whether voters read the ads . &quot; It ' s reinforcing that they have a plan to address problems , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s not in the details . It ' s in the belief that the plan is there. &quot; Just as Clinton peddled copies of his campaign ' s economic plan , the ANC urges people to send_for the party ' s manifesto , called &quot; A Better Life for All. &quot; And just as Clinton used &quot; town_meetings , &quot; Mandela conducts regular &quot; people ' s forums &quot; to answer questions about everything from police brutality to crumbling hospitals . His bodyguards were trained by U.S. State_Department security agents , but no American presidential candidate ever got the frenzied , adoring , star-struck crowds that Mandela routinely draws . This election , after all , is their own liberation . A rally in Ikageng , in the western Transvaal , is typical . The whole township turns_out , not just to see him , but to celebrate . Thousands of people line rooftops , cling_to lampposts and stand shoulder-to-shoulder along the dirt roads . Drum majorettes , in white satin and gold_braid , march to thumping drums and blaring trumpets . Teen-agers dance to a reggae band . Women ululate and sing praises to Mandela . Former guerrillas , and at least one tiny toddler , proudly wear camouflage fatigues . The crowd spills_out of the packed stands and surges past the hapless guards , shoving and shouting in cathartic glee . Euphoria fills the air . But as often happens , it fizzles when Mandela speaks . He ' s stiff , wooden , and prone to lecturing the audience . He drones_on about crime , reading a long list of statistics -- so many dead since 1984 , so many murders a day , so many robberies , so many gun licenses issued and so on . Then onto collective_bargaining , a breakdown of the education budget , pension reform and the new Constitutional Court . He speaks in English , which some Tswana-speakers clearly don ' t understand . People soon begin drifting out . Still , at 75 , Mandela has a regal bearing and unflappable dignity . He is trim and fit , although he wears a hearing_aid and special socks for a circulation problem . But unlike De Klerk , image is no problem . At one rally , women draped a purple blanket on his shoulders and gave him a padded rocking_chair . He arranged the robe so it hung over one shoulder and wrapped around his waist . He sat in the chair , as erect as on a throne , the very picture of the royal Thembu chief he was raised to be . He enjoys recounting those early years . Helicoptering into tiny Mqekezweni , he takes reporters into a round grass hut with a floor of smeared cow dung where he had lived as a child . Outside , he says with a grin , &quot; It was here I made my first love to a young_lady . So you can see how important this area is for me. &quot; He talks , too , of his long , lonely years as a political_prisoner : of learning of the death of his mother , Nosekeni , in 1968 , and his eldest son , Thembi , in a car crash a year later . He was forbidden to attend the funerals . &quot; I was deeply hurt that I could not pay my last respects_to either my mother or my son . I could not share my pain with anyone , &quot; he says during a visit to his former cell at Robben Island . Not all_the memories are bad . He has built a four-bedroom vacation house modeled exactly on the prison warder ' s home he occupied during his last two years of incarceration . And he still rises at dawn , exercises and makes his bed as he did_in prison . The stern authority and paternal presence that saw him through prison are visible on the campaign trail . He publicly rebukes his staff for mismanaging campaign events . And he is furious that De Klerk and the National Party claim credit for ending apartheid . &quot; The people are shunning the National Party like lepers , which they are , &quot; he says angrily at Zambela , another township . &quot; They are still a racist party that clings in one way or another to the policies of racial discrimination. &quot; And later , he mocks De Klerk for complaining about the hecklers . &quot; South_Africa has got robust politics and sissies should not address political meetings. &quot; But Mandela also can be a loose cannon . In recent weeks , he has said that right-wing whites would be able to vote for a self-ruled state . Then he said it wasn ' t certain that an ANC leader -- him , in other words -- must be president . Finally he told Dutch TV he might resign after a year as president and let a younger_man finish the next four years . Each time , his aides quickly backpedaled and described his recorded comments as a joke , a misunderstanding or a misquote . As president , Mandela will inherit staggering social and economic problems . Life for many South_Africans has grown worse since he was released from jail . A culture of criminal violence rages in the townships . Black schooling has virtually collapsed . The economy is mired in the longest and deepest recession in decades . And the new democracy will be a fractious collection of competing interest_groups . Young , aggressive politicians will be_on the make in the new national and provincial assemblies . Some of Mandela ' s strongest supporters -- the Communists , trade_unions , even his estranged and militant wife , Winnie -- may become albatrosses once he ' s in power . How will he manage ? Post-colonial Africa is littered with the shattered dreams and ruined economies left by charismatic , nationalist heroes who were unable to rule . To avoid their fate , Mandela must steer a careful course between black expectations and white fears , between revolutionary zeal and government abuses . His closest aides , people like ANC Secretary_General Cyril Ramaphosa , 41 , and party chairman Thabo Mbeki , 51 , will play a key role . The challenge is immense , but there are many reasons for hope . And in the end , Mandela ' s hectic campaign schedule shows how miraculous this election is . On most days , he skips the wealthy white enclaves , with their Mercedeses and back-yard swimming_pools , that have always run South_Africa . Instead , he heads for the wretched townships , the miserable mining camps and sad squatter settlements -- neglected , impoverished , often unmarked , and always out_of_sight of the white minority . And when the unmistakable gray-haired figure arrives , with his beaming smile and infectious enthusiasm , he ' s greeted as a martyr , a hero , a symbol of freedom and leader of liberation . His aura and appeal are almost religious . Mandela obviously agrees . &quot; All of you , without exception , are my flesh and blood , &quot; he tells a crowd at one recent rally . &quot; Your aspirations are my aspirations . Your victory is my victory. &quot; The cheers are deafening .</TEXT>
