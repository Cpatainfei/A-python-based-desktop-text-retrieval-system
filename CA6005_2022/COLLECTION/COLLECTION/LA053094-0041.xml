   <HEADLINE> STREET SMART : U-TURNS NEAR AIRPORT EXIT WOULD CREATE TRAFFIC DANGER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dear Street Smart : Why is there a &quot; No U-Turn &quot; sign at northbound Campus Drive and Airport Way ? Because of the sign , motorists are required to enter the airport to make a U-turn . I cannot see any problems that would be created by allowing U-turns . Phil Salisbury Newport Beach Rich Edmonston , traffic engineer for Newport Beach , said that if drivers were allowed to make a U-turn on northbound Campus Drive at that spot , they would be turning_into lanes used by motorists turning right out of the airport on Airport Way . And because that airport traffic is particularly heavy , the city does not want to allow a U-turn on Campus . Dear Street Smart : This is regarding a traffic_signal at the southbound Valley View Street on-ramp to the northbound San Diego Freeway . There is a lane which directs on-ramp traffic only . It is separated from the other southbound lanes by a solid line . However , there is a confusing traffic_signal at the entrance to the on-ramp . The same light that controls southbound traffic on Valley View is placed to the right of the on-ramp entrance . Since there is no permissible access to the on-ramp from any other direction , is this light to be treated like a right-on-red situation ? Kevin E . Condon Garden Grove No . Because you have to go_past the signal to get_to the entrance of the on-ramp , a right turn_on red is not legal , said Rose Orem , a Caltrans spokeswoman . Dear Street Smart : When is the extension of Weir Canyon Road from the Riverside Freeway to the end of Jamboree Road at Santiago Canyon Road in the Orange Hills planned to open ? This would provide an alternate route to the Costa Mesa Freeway , especially for South County . Brian D . Bowski Mission Viejo The Weir Canyon Road extension is_on the Orange County Master_Plan , but it will be at least 20 years before anything is done there , said Richard Peterson , manager of transportation planning for the county . A few years ago , when the economy started spiraling downward , development plans for the eastern portion of the city of Orange were squelched . When those plans died , plans for the road died with it , Peterson said . * The Orange County Transportation Authority has made several changes in its fares and bus_routes . Route changes will take_effect June 12 and the new fares will take_effect July 1 . Transfers that now cost a nickel will be free . The transfers will allow passengers to board_up to two other buses and can be used for two hours from the time they are issued . OCTA also is introducing a fare coupon book at a discounted price .
