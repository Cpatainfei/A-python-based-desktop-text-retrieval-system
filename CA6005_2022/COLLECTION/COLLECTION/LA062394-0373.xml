   <HEADLINE> AROUND THE VALLEY : PLUCKING FRUIT FROM LIMB SWEETENS SEASON FOR CHERRY LOVERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Big John Mayfield was just about picked clean . But he wasn ' t complaining . In fact , he was encouraging visitors to pluck the season ' s last gleaming red cherries from the upper limbs of his orchard in Leona Valley . The pickers had to climb ladders to reach the few clusters still clinging_to the highest branches . This was the season ' s last -- some say its sweetest -- fruit . A few weeks earlier , Mayfield and Leona Valley ' s other &quot; U-Pick &quot; growers had opened their gates to hordes of cherry lovers . Even the lowest branches were then thick_with fruit , drooping under its weight . But like a lot of life ' s pleasures , cherry season just didn ' t last long enough . It began a_couple_of months earlier when delicate white cherry blossoms burst open_to signal the beginning of spring . Soon , the petals gave_way to tiny round fruit . By early June , the sweet_cherries were ripe . Most of Los Angeles County is too warm_to support cherry_trees , which need plenty of freezing weather each winter to produce fruit . But Leona Valley , tucked up against the mountains west of Palmdale and no stranger to snow , is fertile ground for cherries . Each spring , the little town celebrates the opening of picking season with a parade . Winter temperatures and rainfall affect the size of the crop . In a good year , cherry-picking season may last seven or eight weeks . A more modest crop , such_as this year ' s , lasts only three weeks . During the first two weekends this month , thousands of visitors invaded Big John ' s Orchard , snapping_up much of his crop . By a recent afternoon , many branches were bare , and only about two_dozen pickers showed_up for the last of the harvest . The price was a buck a pound . Trish Reilly of Valencia and her four children found slim pickings . &quot; You ' ve got_to go pretty high ( to find branches with cherries ) on this farm , &quot; she said . To reach the upper branches , Reilly , who was visibly pregnant , scaled an aluminum ladder . &quot; I ' m not afraid , &quot; she said . But she quickly added : &quot; My OB would kill me . . . . &quot; Still , the work was worth it . &quot; Fruit ' s always better_off the tree , &quot; Reilly said . &quot; It ' s always better here than at the market. &quot; Nearby , Judith Flowers of Monrovia was using one hand to hold the leash attached_to her frisky dachshund . Her other hand steadied the ladder her 12-year-old son Nathan had climbed to pick cherries . She watched as he devoured some of the fruits of his labor . &quot; One in the mouth , two in the bucket , &quot; she said laughing . &quot; that ' s why this is taking so long. &quot; For Flowers , the visit to Leona Valley was a trip down memory lane . As a youngster , she picked plenty of cherries here , usually by climbing the trees -- a technique that Big John forbids because of the risk to pickers and tree limbs . &quot; I was raised_up here , &quot; Flowers said . &quot; My father was one of the people who planted the first big cherry orchard in Leona Valley . . . . For me , it ' s coming_back once a year and doing what I did_in my childhood. &quot; She gazed into the branches where her son was busy . &quot; The ones at the top are the best because they get the most sunshine , and they last the longest , &quot; she explained . &quot; I ' d like to get that cluster up there , but it ' s out of reach. &quot; * Flowers said her son appears to have inherited her affection for cherry picking . &quot; Even though it ' s a lot of work , he asks to come_back each year , &quot; she said . A few trees away , Leslie Smoot , who runs a day-care center in Lancaster , was riding_herd over 20 children and adults who were_on a cherry-picking field trip . She was having a tough time keeping the younger kids from climbing the trees . &quot; Big John said it was better if they gathered the ( cherries ) on the ground , &quot; Smoot said . &quot; He won ' t charge us for them. &quot; At the checkout_counter , Norman Lobo of Northridge strode up with 18 pounds of the fruit , which he planned to serve at his church ' s potluck dinner . It had taken him two hours to pick . &quot; You take one of these cans , stick it around your neck and drop it in with both hands , &quot; he explained . &quot; You have to get_up high to get the good ones . If you ' re afraid of heights , forget it. &quot; Another customer approached Big John himself with a more modest pail of pickings . &quot; That should do me , &quot; the visitor said . &quot; Not quite , &quot; replied the orchard owner , as he grabbed a machete-sized knife and brought it down with a loud whack . A thick red slice of watermelon fell_over on the cutting board . Big John grinned and handed the sample to his customer . Tanned , wearing blue_jeans and a T-shirt stained with dust and fruit_juice , Big John Mayfield , 63 , looks_like a hard-working farmer . Producing fruit , vegetables and honey was once merely a hobby . Now it consumes much of his life . As a contractor , Mayfield says he helped build thousands of tract houses in the west San Fernando Valley . Later , he specialized in building custom homes . He ' s lived_in Leona Valley since 1959 and bought his cherry orchard 17 years ago . Now it ' s grown to 265 trees and Mayfield is just about retired from the building business . His cherry season is over now . But Mayfield plans to keep his roadside stand open , selling the honey he gets from his 200 beehives . Pretty soon , he will add the watermelons , tomatoes and bell_peppers he is growing across the street . Soon afterward , his Asian pears will be ripe . Mayfield ' s goal ? To keep the stand open until October , when the pumpkins will be ready for harvest . &quot; It sounds silly , but I ' m not in it for the money , &quot; he says . &quot; I always wanted to be a farmer . I don ' t care if I ever build another house. &quot;</TEXT>
