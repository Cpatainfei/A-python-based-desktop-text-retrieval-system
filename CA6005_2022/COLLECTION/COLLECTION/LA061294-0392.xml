   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 ; WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / GROUP_B PREVIEW ; SWEDEN AT A GLANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * COACH : Tommy Svensson . * KEY PLAYERS : Tomas Brolin , Martin Dahlin , Thomas Ravelli . * STRENGTHS : The Swedish team gained huge confidence and a sense of togetherness by finishing third in the 1992 European Championship , played in Sweden . A pair of talented strikers in Dahlin and Brolin , excellent midfielders in Jonas Thern and Stefan Schwarz , hard-tackling defenders like Jan Eriksson and Roland Nilsson , and a veteran goalkeeper in Ravelli will make_it a difficult team to beat . * WEAKNESSES : The team seldom rises to any great height in terms of performance . It does_well enough to win but lacks sparkle . It is fast up front and on the wings but a lot slower in midfield and on defense , something that could be exploited by Brazil and Cameroon . * WORLD CUP HISTORY : Eight previous appearances . Record of 11-14-6 . Best finish was as runner-up in 1958 . Was fourth in 1938 and third in 1950 . * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT : Defender Joachim Bjorklund is the nephew of Coach Tommy Svensson . * OUTLOOK : After a disastrous 1990 World Cup when it lost all three matches and went_home from Italy licking its wounds , Sweden should do much better this time around . On paper , it is the second-best team in its first-round group and will advance with ease . The luck of the draw comes_into play after that , but the Swedes could make the final eight . * PREDICTED FIRST-ROUND FINISH : Second . ROSTERS 03 # 05 , 19 # 12 No .
