   <HEADLINE> COURT ALLOWS ABORTION SUITS UNDER RICO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Supreme Court gave abortion providers a new legal weapon Monday by ruling that militant foes of abortion can be forced to pay crippling damage verdicts if they are found to have led a campaign of violence and threats against abortion clinics . The 9-0 decision reinstates a lawsuit filed by the National Organization for Women against Joseph Scheidler and his Pro-Life Action League , and Randall Terry and his Operation Rescue . The suit charges the abortion opponents with leading a nationwide conspiracy to shut abortion clinics through bombings , arson , break-ins and threats . If the charges are proven , the high_court said , Scheidler and his allies violated the federal anti-racketeering law and can be required to pay damages three times greater than the total losses suffered by the abortion providers . More broadly , the ruling also gives government prosecutors the power to use the law against any terrorist organization that uses violence for political reasons . Similarly , it would permit lawsuits against animal rights activists , environmental extremists or others who use force or violence to achieve their goals . Most lower courts have dismissed such suits on the grounds that the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act applies only to mobsters , crooks or con_artists who prey on legitimate business . Since the abortion foes acted for moral reasons , not for &quot; an economic motive , &quot; a federal appeals court in Chicago had dismissed NOW ' s suit . But Chief_Justice William H . Rehnquist , writing for the court , concluded that the 1970 law does not require that criminals be motivated by money . The law covers &quot; any enterprise . . . individual ( or ) association &quot; which engages in a pattern of criminal activity , such_as robbery , murder , arson , fraud , drug dealing or the use of violence and threatened force . &quot; Nowhere in ( the language of the law ) is there any indication that an economic motive is required , &quot; Rehnquist said . A targeted group &quot; need only be an association in fact that engages in a pattern of racketeering activity. &quot; Monday ' s ruling is also noteworthy because the legal outcome is not necessarily in_line with the personal preferences of the justices . Several of them , including Rehnquist , have repeatedly expressed concern about the broad reach of the RICO law . While the justices have urged Congress to amend the law , they have also said that they have no authority to rewrite it on_their_own . Originally enacted as a weapon to combat organized crime , during the 1980s the law became a favored means of attacking regular businesses that engaged in fraud . The targets included the executives of failed thrift_institutions , stockbrokers who deceived customers , city officials who took bribes , even accountants , travel_agents and insurance sellers who put their names on misleading statements . Critics now say that the law has become a dangerous tool in the hands of greedy lawyers . The justices could have invoked the First_Amendment and ruled that a racketeering suit such_as the one in this case violates the free-speech rights of abortion foes . But as Rehnquist noted in his opinion in the case ( NOW vs . Scheidler , 92-780 ) , lawyers for abortion foes did not raise that issue in this case . Given previous interpretations of the RICO law , attorneys for Operation Rescue presumably thought that they could win without a First_Amendment argument . Now , however , as the case returns for trial in Chicago , the anti-abortion leaders are free to argue that their activities are protected as free speech . On Friday , the justices also announced that they would review a Florida judge ' s order that limited anti-abortion picketing near a clinic . A ruling in that case , due by July , should clarify the free-speech rights of the abortion foes . Leaders of NOW praised Monday ' s decision and predicted that it could help quell the &quot; escalating anti-abortion terrorism. &quot; &quot; This decision allows us to go_after the leaders , the kingpins of this conspiracy , &quot; said Helen Neuborne , executive_director of the NOW Legal Defense Fund . &quot; We believe we can connect them to these bombings and the other acts of violence. &quot; Anti-abortion lawyers denounced the decision and said they feared that it &quot; may bankrupt not only pro-life organizations but other political activists throughout the nation , &quot; said Clarke Forsythe , general counsel for Americans United for Life , who represented Scheidler . Defending itself in the 8-year-old case has already cost Pro-Life Action League more_than $ 1 million , he said . &quot; We expect a costly abuse of RICO . . . will threaten all activists that oppose various businesses , &quot; Forsythe said . Both the House and Senate have passed bills that would make_it a federal crime to block the entrances to an abortion facility . A final version of that legislation is expected to gain congressional approval by spring . Abortion rights lawyers said that the new measure would permit authorities , including federal judges , to intervene against ordinary protesters who break the law . Last year , the Supreme Court stripped federal judges of their power to intervene in these disputes by ruling that federal civil_rights laws do not protect women seeking abortion .</TEXT>
