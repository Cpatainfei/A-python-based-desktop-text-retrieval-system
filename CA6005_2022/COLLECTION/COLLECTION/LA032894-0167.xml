   <HEADLINE> A DIRECTOR ON HEROES AND A HOPEFUL ' EPOQUE ' ; MOVIES : FERNANDO TRUEBA THANKED BILLY WILDER WHEN HE WON AN OSCAR FOR FOREIGN-LANGUAGE FILM , BUT HE ALSO DREW ON RENOIR AND MARCEL PAGNOL FOR INSPIRATION , HE SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the 66th Academy Awards ' pithiest acceptance speech , Spanish director Fernando Trueba , picking_up a best foreign-language Oscar for his sly , seductive &quot; Belle Epoque , &quot; remarked that he &quot; would like to believe_in God so that I could thank him , but I just believe_in Billy Wilder . So thank_you , Billy Wilder. &quot; &quot; If I win , I think : I would be horrified to have to talk in front of so many people , &quot; said Trueba the morning after the big night . &quot; I can ' t understand how I finally did_it . &quot; For me , Wilder really is the best director ever , a major direct influence on me . He ' s also the best screenwriter ever . He ' s made more masterpieces than anybody . If it were not for his movies , maybe I would not be a director today . He called me today -- and said , ' It ' s God. ' &quot; &quot; I wish he hadn ' t said that , &quot; retorts Wilder , by phone from his office . &quot; People start crossing themselves when they see me ! &quot; ' Belle Epoque ' is a picture with a lot of style -- it could be made here in English , &quot; Wilder continues . &quot; Trueba is a very , very serious picture-maker . The Spaniards are so on top of everything : He and Pedro Almodovar know more about me than I do . Almodovar came_by my office , kissed me on both cheeks and said , ' Now I might as well turn_around and go home. ' &quot; For all his admiration of Wilder , Trueba , a slim man of 39 , has taken as a key inspiration for &quot; Belle Epoque &quot; in its sensual mood and idyllic setting Jean Renoir ' s &quot; A Day in the Country , &quot; as well as the films of Marcel Pagnol . Another inspiration for him and his distinguished screenwriter Rafael Azcona was the libertarian-spirited writings of Georges Brassens , whom Trueba regards_as one of the most important poets of the century . * He and Azcona then picked a golden moment in modern Spanish history in which to tell their story : the end of the monarchy and the beginning of the Republic in the early ' 30s . &quot; People had a lot of hope then , &quot; he said . &quot; A lot of people believed_in the possibility of a Utopia. &quot; The starting point for &quot; Belle Epoque &quot; ( now playing throughout Southern California ) , however , was his own relationship with his father-in-law . In the film , a rural landowner ( the great character star Fernando Fernan Gomez ) befriends a handsome young army deserter ( Jorge Sanz ) , but is afraid that if the young_man should fall_in_love with one of his four beautiful daughters -- the attraction between him and all four of them is steamily mutual -- he would lose a friend albeit gaining a son-in-law . &quot; When I was 19 I met an older_man -- he was 52 -- and we became very , very good friends , &quot; said Trueba . &quot; He was a painter , a draftsman , and had a lot of humor . I never met anybody who read more books . He liked Italian neo-realist films , the_French films of ( Marcel ) Carne and that generation , while I preferred the new_wave and American films . We closed every bar in the neighborhood talking_about politics and movies . Later , I married one of his four daughters . We ' ve always been friends , but it isn ' t the same. &quot; Trueba was a Madrid film critic when he made his feature debut with the 1982 &quot; Opera Prima , &quot; a delightful romantic comedy . Currently , he is preparing his next picture , an adaptation of the Donald Westlake thriller &quot; Two Much , &quot; to be filmed in Miami this fall and produced by his savvy longtime colleague Andres Vicente Gomez ( who joined him onstage Monday night to accept the Oscar ) . Gomez hopes the Oscar will trigger the release of some of Trueba ' s earlier films . &quot; ' Two Much ' has a lot of humor . It ' s very crazy , &quot; said Trueba , who made his English-language debut with &quot; Mad Monkey &quot; ( retitled &quot; Twisted Obsession &quot; by Carolco and released in 1990 ) . &quot; The central idea is that the hero pretends he has a twin , and then he ' s forced to play both roles . It ' s a perfect idea for a screwball comedy . I got a letter from Westlake . He said that now that he ' s seen ' Belle Epoque ' he ' s not worried. &quot; Although Trueba said he &quot; absolutely &quot; intends to remain a Spanish director , he concedes &quot; I would like to work here also -- if I can do_good projects . I never did a movie I didn ' t believe_in . Maybe I made mistakes but I believed_in what I was doing . Making an American comedy , ' Two Much , ' is like a dream come true . Making a dream a reality is good , yes ? &quot;</TEXT>
