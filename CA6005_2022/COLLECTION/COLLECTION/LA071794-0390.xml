   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA 1994 ; COMMENTARY ; WILL MIDDLE AMERICA KEEP SOCCER FRONT AND CENTER ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It might turn_out that soccer won ' t make_it big in America permanently because soccer has made_it so big in America temporarily . The World Cup has come , 52 games ' worth , and now it will go , sometime around 3 p.m. today . It will leave a legacy of good feeling , of memorable moments , of exciting and emotional games and of clean , safe fun for all . Stadiums have been all but filled everywhere , and lots of money has been made . Also , the generally cynical foreign press came , saw and was mostly conquered by a well-done event . But today , it will go . And before long , Part 2 of Alan Rothenberg ' s plan for making soccer a big-time sport here will begin . Sometime in the spring , at various cities all_over the country , Major_League Soccer -- a league that represents the most-recent attempt to rank the sport alongside football , basketball , baseball and hockey on an already crowded sports calendar in this country -- is scheduled to make its debut . For the American public , the balloon payment will have come due , and there are many reasons to expect a default . First , the World Cup has spoiled American soccer fans , especially those really paying_attention to soccer for the first time . It has been high-quality entertainment and athletic competition , but it is also the best that foreign money can buy . We are watching AC Milan and FC Barcelona and Bayern Munich and Real Madrid and the University of Mexico_City . We will not be watching them this spring . Nor , in most cases , will we be watching the American players who , almost overnight , became household names . Alexi Lalas will probably take all that facial hair and find a regular barber in Europe . Paul Caligiuri has become a hot item and it is likely we will discover that you can take the boy out of Diamond Bar , especially for lots of European diamonds . Tony Meola has been_on every TV_show except &quot; Geraldo , &quot; and he might be able to squeeze that one in too before he also is enticed to the lands of francs , pesetas or pounds . Then there are the American stars , who , while certainly American in heritage , were mostly here on a soccer lend-lease deal from Europe and Mexico . They are John Harkes , Ernie Stewart , Tom Dooley , Eric Wynalda , Cle Kooiman . . . . So it ' s the same old story . How you gonna keep them down on the farm after they ' ve seen Paree ? Or at least after they ' ve seen Paree ' s checkbook . Rothenberg has done a wonderful job with this World Cup . He has tackled the task , taken his knocks and gotten_it done . American capitalism , innovation and work ethic have come_through again , with Rothenberg leading the way . When Peter Ueberroth made the 1984 L.A. Olympics into a huge financial and aesthetic success , Time magazine put him on its cover and called him man of the year . But when the ' 84 Olympics ended , Ueberroth ' s remaining mandate was merely to write some large checks to the International Olympic Committee and have the stadiums swept out . Rothenberg too must write some large checks to FIFA and have the stadiums swept out . But he must then persuade the American public to keep all its recently acquired warm and fuzzy soccer feelings on hold for about eight months and then go_out and plunk_down lots of season-ticket money for games in lesser stadiums featuring lesser players in an atmosphere of lesser soccer ambience . that ' s not impossible , just very difficult . America is a big-show place . It loves its Olympics , its Super Bowls and now its World Cups . But try to sell it soccer on Tuesday night in Tulsa and watch it turn_tail . The press will play a key role in this . The World Cup has become something of a writers ' event . Whereas some publications have merely covered it , others have romanticized it . It is a sport that seems to stir those who love to wax poetic . James Michener , no less , in an article for Soccer Watch , wrote : &quot; Every four years , when the World Cup is up for grabs -- the supreme contest in the world ' s sporting events -- national patriotism rises to a fever pitch and the great spectacle is under way. &quot; The distinguished Murray Kempton , in Thursday ' s New York Newsday , wrote : &quot; It occurs to me that the worm of time ' s gnawings could well make this my last World Cup and that I must hasten to multiply my prostrations at the Communion rail . Since the Almighty is a multinational deity , I cannot conceive_of any game_licensed for playing in heaven except the World Cup . The archangel Michael will , of course , be coach and object of widespread grumblings in the angelic choir . But then , he can quiet all public discontents by bargaining Diego Maradona ' s release from the infernal_regions . And then heaven will be truly heaven. &quot; Suddenly , an American press that , four weeks ago , didn ' t know AC Milan from AC-DC finds itself interested in the European Championships , interested in whether Stoitchkov and Romario can truly get_along as side-by-side strikers at Barcelona , in whether Roberto Baggio will forsake his Italy for Japan ' s J-League , in whether Miguel Mejia Baron survives and Bora stays . Indeed , the approach in the press will be different . The knee-jerk rejection and cynicism to anything involving the sport probably will be lessened , especially at some of the larger outlets . The Times will continue regular soccer coverage , using the established expertise of Julie Cart and Grahame L . Jones ; the New York Times , led by the elegant writing and soccer perspective of columnist George Vecsey , will probably continue ; the Chicago Tribune should carry_on quite nicely with veteran Phil Hersch and a powerful and knowledgeable soccer advocate in its Washington bureau chief , Jim Warren . But how is the show likely to play off Broadway , in America ' s hinterlands ? In a discussion on non-soccer business recently with Dale Bye , sports editor of the Kansas City Star , the World Cup came_up . Bye said he thought his paper had done_well in giving its readers good coverage of the event and even mentioned the name Stoitchkov in the conversation . That was a shocker . It ' s not that Bye isn ' t knowledgeable , or that Kansas City lacks sophistication . It is simply that , for the Bulgarian star to have become that common a name and that quick a frame_of_reference throughout the United States is to think that , just maybe , Rothenberg ' s Major_League Soccer does have a chance . If so , Time magazine had better start planning another cover .</TEXT>
