   <HEADLINE> RIFLING THE DRAWERS OF THE DEAD ; THE SILENT WOMAN : SYLVIA PLATH &amp; TED HUGHES , BY JANET MALCOLM ( ALFRED A . KNOPF : $ 23 ; 208 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ours is not an age in which literary events create much stir , but the publication in the New Yorker last summer of Janet Malcolm ' s study of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes was an exception . Brilliantly packaged by Tina Brown , with reprints of the Plath poems that had been originally published in the New Yorker , the issue was a sellout on both sides of the Atlantic , and for weeks no dinner_party from Westwood to Hampstead was complete without a discussion of it . Now published as a book , &quot; The Silent Woman &quot; is a scathing denunciation of the ethics of literary biography , as well as a defense of Plath ' s survivors -- Ted Hughes , now poet_laureate ; his fiercely loyal sister Olwyn , and indirectly the writer Anne Stevenson , whose book about Plath , &quot; Bitter Fame &quot; ( 1989 ) , was &quot; pilloried &quot; because it was seen as a vehicle for the Hughes family ' s view of the marriage . Writing less about Sylvia Plath ' s life than about her afterlife as a legend , Malcolm takes arms against the hordes of biographers , journalists and feminist literary critics who have probed the mystery of Plath ' s suicide , and blamed Hughes for his infidelity in life and his iron control of Plath ' s copyrights in death . According to Malcolm , biographers are just professional burglars , snooping through the drawers of the dead for loot -- that is , intimate , scandalous or damaging information . Readers of literary biography are driven by &quot; voyeurism and busybodyism , &quot; deceiving themselves that they are having &quot; an elevating literary experience , &quot; when they are actually &quot; listening to backstairs gossip and reading other people ' s mail. &quot; Journalists are the cruelest of all these scavengers , trading in &quot; sadism and reductionism &quot; ; and even the subject ' s relatives , &quot; the biographer ' s natural enemies , &quot; can be sucked into hapless collusion . Among the seven deadly_sins of literary biography , Malcolm warns , greed also plays a leading role . Since Malcolm herself has been involved in a notorious case about libel and invasion_of_privacy brought by the modest and reclusive Jeffrey Masson , the topical ironies of the book have attracted a great_deal of attention . We might well ask why she is eagerly publishing big chunks of previously unpublished correspondence between Ted Hughes , Olwyn Hughes and Anne Stevenson , let alone why she is sneaking around Ted Hughes ' garden in Devon . The magnetic pull of Sylvia Plath ' s story , and Malcolm ' s personal attraction to it despite her proclaimed scruples , produce the tension that makes &quot; The Silent Woman &quot; so fascinating . The book is a tour_de_force , the best thing Malcolm has ever done . Apparently a journalistic expose of sorts , it is more like an epistolary novel , a Jamesian quest_for American innocence and European corruption , and an exploration of the terrible costs of female creative achievement for the American generation of the 1950s . Why is Sylvia Plath ' s story so compelling ? Malcolm quotes an excerpt from Plath ' s own journal of 1958 : &quot; Liz Taylor is getting Eddie Fisher away from Debbie Reynolds , who appears cherubic , round-faced , wronged , in pin_curls and house robe -- Mike Todd barely cold . How odd these events affect one so . Why ? Analogies ? &quot; She finds many analogies between Plath ' s experience , Anne Stevenson ' s and her own ; indeed , she claims , Plath was a paradigmatic figure of her generation -- &quot; the fearful , double-faced fifties. &quot; For intellectual women with literary ambitions , the times were particularly inauspicious ; in the years before the sexual revolution ( the 19th Century in America , Malcolm writes , didn ' t really end until the 1960s ) , women ' s destinies seemed bounded by their choice of men . And while all writers must struggle against convention and their own resistances , &quot; women writers seem to have to take stronger measures , make more peculiar psychic arrangements than men do to activate their imaginations. &quot; Yet while other women surrendered or failed , Plath resisted the period ' s blandness and confronted its concealed horrors head-on . In her life , as in her writing , Plath &quot; was able -- she elected -- to confront what most of the rest of us fearfully shrank from. &quot; Asking herself how Plath , the scrubbed and shiny college_girl from Massachusetts , became the terrifyingly mature and powerful poet of Ariel , Malcolm hypothesizes that expatriation was an important element . In one sense , she argues that Plath was alienated in postwar England , and closed_out by the feline British intelligentsia , so different from the burnished image that appealed_to bookish and romantic American undergraduates in the 1950s . Yet she also believes that Plath had to flee the puritanism and duplicity of Eisenhower America ; she &quot; did not write -- and could not have written -- ' The Bell_Jar of Ariel ' in her native Massachusetts. &quot; Plath had to shed her American accent , appearance , identity , to become an artist . In a parable of American women ' s writing , which has functioned at least since the 19th Century , she was Persephone : &quot; Like so many women writers , she had to leave the daylight world and go underground to find her voice. &quot; In the course of the book , Malcolm becomes a Persephone too , following Plath , and also Anne Stevenson , into darkest England . Beginning in February , 1991 , in a London deserted by tourists because of the Gulf War , she travels in freezing weather and incompetent British Rail trains to interview Plath ' s friends and enemies , her survivors and her critics . Ironically , Malcolm never meets Ted Hughes , although she finds &quot; a kind of Chekhovian largeheartedness and melancholy &quot; in his letters . Indeed , the further she travels , the more complex the &quot; truth &quot; appears to become , and the more sympathetic the motives of all involved . Malcolm ' s quest ends , during another trip , in September , 1991 , when she meets Trevor Thomas , who lived_in the flat below Plath ' s when she killed herself , and who was the last person to see her alive . He is a self-obsessed eccentric , whose account of Plath ' s emotional distress is mingled with his own grievances , and whose house is crammed with a lifetime ' s accumulation of junk . Malcolm takes it as &quot; a kind of monstrous allegory of truth &quot; and &quot; a metaphor for the problem of writing. &quot; How can a biographer shape a narrative from this chaotic material ? Ultimately the journalist , like the novelist , picks a card from the deck , but in the Plath game the room is &quot; so dark and gloomy that one has a hard_time seeing one ' s hand ; one is apt to make mistakes. &quot; Malcolm calls the book &quot; The Silent Woman &quot; in reference_to an anecdote about a quarrel between Plath and Olwyn Hughes , which ended in Plath ' s mute glare . This &quot; ( Medusan ) speechlessness , &quot; Malcolm writes , &quot; is the deadly , punishing weapon. &quot; It is also a metaphor of suicide ; Plath stopped the conversation forever , and spoke only from beyond the grave with the blazing poems that have made her one of the most widely read writers of our century . In their stunning achievement , Malcolm writes , the books and poems are also &quot; full of threatening silences . . . we stand before the Ariel poems as Olwyn stood before the stone-faced Sylvia. &quot; Plath ' s art is &quot; threatening , &quot; I assume , in its challenge to the reader ' s own compromises and timidities . But finally the silent woman in this book is Janet Malcolm herself . Repeatedly but with tantalizing vagueness , she draws connections between herself and Plath , between herself and Stevenson , who was one year ahead of her at the University of Michigan , and seemed to have lived_out her own &quot; fantasies of nonconformity. &quot; It seems clear that Malcolm has used journalism as a shield and a passport into alternative lives , places where women both long to go and fear to tread . Plath ' s story is a thread she follows into the labyrinth of sexuality , art and death , and into the uncertainties of nonfiction where &quot; we almost never know the truth of what happened. &quot; Beneath its high-minded denunciations of biography , &quot; The Silent Woman &quot; is a step across a threshold , and the first tentative notes of a personal voice . As Malcolm knows very well , it ' s not Sylvia we mourn for . BOOK MARK : For an excerpt from &quot; The Silent Woman , &quot; see the Opinion section .</TEXT>
