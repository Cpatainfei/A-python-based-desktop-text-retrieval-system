   <HEADLINE> RECOVERY WATCH ; ALL TOO MOBILE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The mobile_home has become a major category of housing in the United States . Born as vacation housing and later popular as retirement housing , the mobile_home now is permanent housing for millions of Americans.In California , with its mild climate , the percentage of mobile_homes among single-family dwellings always has been large . Unfortunately , earthquake is as permanent a part of California life as sunshine , and mobile_homes are particularly vulnerable in a temblor . A classic trailer , ready to roll_down the road behind an automobile , may just bounce on its tires in a quake . Ironically , the larger , stationary , &quot; double-wide &quot; mobile_homes are considered more vulnerable . Their floors are supported by I-beams that rest_on simple tripods . In an earthquake , those beams can hop off the tripods , causing tens of thousands of dollars ' damage . Technical fixes for this problem are available both at the manufacturing stage and , for the mobile_home owner , at the retrofit stage . Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan was right when he said during a visit to a quake-damaged mobile_home park , &quot; Most of this could have been avoided with some common-sense measures. &quot; The cost of the available measures is modest when amortized over the life of a mobile_home . We urge the Golden State Mobile_Home Owners League , the manufactured-housing industry and the state_Department of Housing and Community Development to formulate and implement a common set of remedies for this eminently solvable problem .</TEXT>
