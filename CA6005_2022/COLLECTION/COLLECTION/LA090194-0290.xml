   <HEADLINE> IT INCREASINGLY APPEARS THE SEASON IS LOST ; BASEBALL : FEDERAL MEDIATORS SEE NO REASON TO BRING OWNERS , PLAYERS TOGETHER FOR NEGOTIATIONS AT THIS TIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal mediators met separately Wednesday with negotiators for baseball ' s club owners and striking players , and determined that there was no reason to bring them together for further bargaining at this time . There have been only two negotiating sessions since the players went_out on Aug . 12 and none since last Thursday . The calendar now reads September , and what remains of the 1994 season is about to go_under . &quot; There is nothing scheduled and no reason to believe anything will be scheduled soon , &quot; said Donald Fehr , the union ' s executive_director . &quot; The mediators are out of ideas too. &quot; Fehr confirmed a story that appeared in Wednesday ' s editions of The Times , saying he has had informal contact with an owner , Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies , but would n ' t discuss the nature of their talks . He did not classify them as secret negotiations and maintained that nothing substantive has emerged . On Day 20 of the strike , mediators met in New York for more_than three hours with representatives of the owners , then spent only 15 minutes with the union ' s staff , assured that there has been no change in the union ' s resistance to a salary cap and no indication that the owners plan to withdraw it . Owners ' negotiator Richard Ravitch said : &quot; I ' m optimistic by nature , but I have nothing more_than nature to base it on. &quot; Ravitch said the union ' s ongoing refusal to discuss issues of cost and how revenue can be divided on a percentage basis is inexplicable and that the losses being absorbed by the clubs because of the strike significantly reduce the amount_of_money they will have to spend on player compensation next year . That sounded like a threat , but Ravitch said the $ 1 billion guaranteed the players in the owners ' proposal -- based on a 50-50 split of all revenue -- would still be there if the players accepted the proposal . In that case , he said , the owners would have to reduce other expenditures to compensate for strike losses , which could exceed $ 200 million if play is not resumed . Ravitch also said the $ 140 million that the owners had at risk in postseason TV revenue is now less than that since advertisers , concerned about the uncertainty of the playoffs and World_Series , are spending their money elsewhere . That situation is so bleak , sources said , that the postseason -- barring a settlement -- could be buried by the end of next week . Both Ravitch and Fehr said their constituents understood the risks of their respective courses . The players missed their first full paycheck Wednesday . First distributions from their $ 175-million-plus strike fund will be mailed on Sept . 15 , a normal payday . &quot; The players understood that a strike costs the industry money and costs them money , and that ' s an indication of how strongly they feel ( about a salary cap ) , &quot; Fehr said . The cap , Texas_Rangers pitcher Kevin Brown said Wednesday , is not an option &quot; this year , next year or in 1996 , &quot; meaning the union is prepared to stay out indefinitely , as Fehr has predicted , if the owners unilaterally put it in place . Acting commissioner Bud Selig said the prospect of the strike continuing in 1995 is a &quot; grave concern , &quot; but the long-term consequences of failing to establish a system of cost certainty would &quot; be even graver. &quot;</TEXT>
