   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS : NEWPORT BEACH ; IRVINE CO . PLAN CLEARS CITY PLANNING PANEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An Irvine Co . plan to build a 173-home gated community between Jamboree Road and the Back Bay in Newport Beach has won the approval of a short-staffed Planning_Commission . But environmental concerns must be resolved with state and federal agencies before the plan can go_forward . As planned , the Newporter North development ' s northern boundary is San Joaquin Hills Road and the southern boundary is adjacent to the Hyatt Newporter resort . The single-family houses would be built_on 30 acres ; almost 60 more acres would be given over to open space . Homes would be_on the top of the bluff , with a wilderness park in John Wayne Gulch below . The plans include a 12-foot-wide public bicycle trail on the bluff top around the housing_development and a pedestrian trail below in the gulch . But the area is peppered with coastal sage scrub that is a habitat for the gnatcatcher , a bird that is_on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department ' s list of species threatened with extinction . &quot; The Newporter North site is probably the most environmentally sensitive of the ( Irvine Co. ' s planned housing ) parcels , &quot; advance planner Patricia Temple told the commission last Thursday . In a recent environmental survey , four nesting pairs and two solo male gnatcatchers were discovered , she said . That has caught the eye of federal_officials , who want to make_sure the birds are protected . The Irvine Co . is subject_to federal regulations protecting threatened species and their habitats , even though the city has approved the project . Wildlife officials could forbid grading in areas where it would be required to construct the bicycle trail . That leaves the bicycle trail -- which is planned to connect with others in the city ' s network -- in_question , because home_buyers could mount a legal challenge to building it if the environmental issues are not resolved and the trail isn ' t finished before the homes are occupied . Another concern is an ongoing lot line dispute . Two survey maps show the tract property_lines in different places , so the commission gave permission for lot line adjustments , if the shorter boundary_line is found to be accurate . HOLLY J .
