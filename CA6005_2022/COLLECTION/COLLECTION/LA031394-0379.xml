   <HEADLINE> O.C. GEARING_UP NOW TO COPE WITH BEES ' ARRIVAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Telephone hot_lines are being set_up . Schoolchildren and service_club members are being talked to . Plants at amusement_parks are being pulled and different shrubs plunked in their places . All this to prepare_for the bees . The Africanized honeybees are not expected to begin arriving in Orange County until late 1994 or early 1995 . Still , local officials say it will take at least that long for government_agencies to perfect contingency plans and for people to learn enough about the bees to calm their fears . &quot; I think it will be a big problem at first , &quot; said Larry Shaw , a specialist with the Orange County Vector Control District , which oversees pest eradication . &quot; There will be a lot of fears and concerns about the unknown , then people will learn to live with them. &quot; The bees -- which have been making their way slowly northward from Brazil since 1957 -- look almost exactly like the more familiar European honeybees and have a sting of about the same intensity . Unlike their European cousins , however , the Africanized bees are easily provoked and then tend to attack aggressively in swarms . They are commonly called &quot; killer_bees , &quot; a nickname that makes biologists wince because it exaggerates the danger . To prepare_for their arrival , county officials nearly two years ago created the Orange County Africanized Honeybee Technical Advisory Team -- a group composed of representatives of various county agencies who meet monthly to make plans and disseminate information . The team has come_up with several prongs of attack . County officials now make regular forays to elementary_schools and service_club meetings to teach children and adults alike about the bees and what precautions to take . A hot_line is being prepared to handle the expected avalanche of calls once the first Africanized honeybee sightings are confirmed . And vector control officials are organizing a five-member eradication team to respond to calls from people who discover bee swarms in their back yards or outdoor property . The Orange County Fire_Department is getting_into the act by training its personnel in special rescue techniques to be employed in the event of bee attacks . Some of the department ' s trucks are being equipped with special bee vales -- netted head_coverings -- to protect the firefighters who conduct those rescues . And Disneyland is preparing_for possible encounters with the migrating bees . Park officials are maintaining existing contracts with pest controllers to eradicate any Africanized bees that decide to settle there and training all personnel about the insects . In addition , maintenance crews are replacing some bee-friendly plants and flowers , said John McClintock , the park ' s supervisor of publicity . &quot; Because we don ' t want our guests inconvenienced or made uncomfortable , &quot; he said , &quot; we have done some replanting in areas around food services to put_in different kinds of vegetation less attractive to bees . We believe that we are prepared_for any situation that might occur. &quot; A spokesman for Knott ' s Berry Farm said that park officials there had not yet developed a plan to combat potential incursion by the bees . &quot; We ' re taking our natural disasters one at a time , &quot; spokesman Bob Ochsner said . Is all this fuss really necessary ? Experts say that most people likely will be little affected by the infestation unless they happen to disturb a hive . And even then , they say , the average person should be able to outrun the bees quickly enough to get_away without serious injury . In any case , here are the experts ' suggestions : * Remove any debris from your property that provides dark enclosed areas likely to attract bees . This would include such things as old tires , trees containing large knot-hole cavities , piles of rubble and unused nursery plant containers . Screen_off likely shelters such_as attic openings , vents and small openings under the house . * If you find a bee swarm within the structure of your house , contact a local pest control company to eradicate it . If the swarm is outside on or near your property , call the county vector control department . * Leave the bees alone . Stay as far away from them as possible and avoid making loud_noises or strong vibrations such_as those associated with power yard tools like blowers and lawn_mowers . * If you are attacked by a swarm of Africanized honeybees , run in a fast zig-zag pattern away from the direction of attack . Cover your face with your shirt or coat and try to make_it to a building , car or some_other enclosed area as quickly as possible . * If stung , try to remove the stingers as soon as possible but only after you have reached a safe haven and are no longer in danger of being attacked . Remove the stingers by scraping them off sideways with a sharp implement . * Do not panic . Consult a physician immediately or as soon as possible and report the stinging incident to local authorities .</TEXT>
