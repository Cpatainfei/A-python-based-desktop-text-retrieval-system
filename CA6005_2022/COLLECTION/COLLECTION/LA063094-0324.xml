   <HEADLINE> ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH : INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS / EXECUTIVE TRAVEL : SPOTLIGHT ON GERMANY ; STAYING_ON THE MARK IN GERMANY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Business travel in Germany is increasing as more foreign investors look_for ways to capitalize on the developing economy in its eastern regions , as well as those in other Eastern European_countries . Here are some suggestions for making business trips to Germany go smoothly . Getting There A number of U.S. and international airlines fly to Germany from Los Angeles . American flies through Chicago or Dallas-Ft . Worth to Munich , Dusseldorf and Frankfurt . Delta connects through Atlanta , New York or Cincinnati to Hamburg , Berlin , Frankfurt , Stuttgart and Munich . Northwest flies through Boston or Detroit to Berlin or Frankfurt , or passengers can connect through Amsterdam and fly KLM to Frankfurt , Berlin , Dusseldorf and Hamburg . TWA connects through New York en route to Frankfurt . Lufthansa , the German airline , flies direct daily from Los Angeles to Frankfurt , and the airline shares flights with Lauda Air , an Austrian carrier , on Wednesdays , Fridays and Sundays to fly directly to Munich . Another German airline , LTU , also flies direct from Los Angeles to Dusseldorf and Munich on Mondays and Thursdays . Frankfurt is the hub for trips to most of the country ' s smaller cities . Getting Around Within Germany , both Lufthansa and LTU operate frequent flights among all major cities . If you ' d rather take a train , Lufthansa runs the Lufthansa Express among Dusseldorf , Cologne , Bonn and Frankfurt exclusively for its ticket holders . ( Baggage is automatically transferred between plane and train at the airport. ) German Railways operates a discounted &quot; Rail and Fly &quot; service connecting cities with 14 German airports . German Railways , one of the most extensive train systems in Europe , also connects all major cities in western Germany . In addition , high-speed express_trains connect Hamburg to Frankfurt and Munich . Driving in Germany can be an unsettling experience for Americans . Most Germans drive faster , particularly on the autobahns , where there ' s no speed_limit . For those renting a car , an international driver ' s permit is recommended but not required . However , you must have proof of liability insurance to drive , so double-check that it is included in your rental policy . National ( known as InterRent and Europcar ) , Avis , Hertz , Thrifty , Dollar Rent a Car ( known as Eurodollar Rent a Car , ) and Budget operate in Germany . When getting quotes , remember that the figure will not include a 15 % value-added_tax . For travel within cities , most business_travelers prefer to take cabs . It is customary to tip the driver by rounding_up to the nearest full mark ( or about 10 % ) . In addition , expect to pay 50 pfennigs for each piece of luggage you carry . Money German currency is based on the deutsche_mark , which equals 100 pfennigs . Banks and bank-operated exchange booths at airports and railroad_stations usually offer the best exchange_rates . Hotels , stores and private exchange firms will charge more for the service . Traveler ' s checks are widely accepted in all but the smallest cities or rural_areas . Now that cash_machines are proliferating throughout Europe , you may be able to get money through an international network such_as Cirrus or Plus . If you use a credit_card , the issuers typically charge 1 % to convert a foreign purchase into a dollar amount . Telephones The phone_system was updated in 1992 and is now fully automated throughout the country . To reach an operator for an international call , dial 0010 . Avoid making international calls from a hotel_room , however , since you ' ll be charged double or triple the norm . Post_offices have special booths for international calls , or you can make calls from public phones that say &quot; Inlands und Auslandsgesprache. &quot; You can buy a phone debit card from most newsstands or post_offices , for use in most public phones . If you purchase a phone card for 50 marks , for example , you can make 60 marks worth of calls with it . AT &amp; T , MCI and Sprint have special services that will help you avoid hotel surcharges . Computers German wall outlets require plugs with two round prongs rather than the two flat prongs that are standard in the United States , so an adapter is needed . Any appliance will also require a converter to operate_on Germany ' s 220-volt circuits . Older laptop_computers may require a special transformer to operate in Germany . Newer models have built-in sensors that can operate with only the adapter plug . If your computer was not made in the United States , make_sure you register it with U.S. customs upon leaving to avoid paying an import tax . If it is American , check with the German Consulate to see whether it should be registered upon entering . Hotels Although more business-class accommodations now have rooms with private baths , many hotels still have shared bathrooms , so make_sure to request a room with a private bath if you want one . Remember that many German hotels do not provide soap . Tipping For luggage , it is customary to tip a hotel porter about 2 marks per bag . In restaurants , service_charges are included in the bill . &quot; Tipping is not as strict as it is here , &quot; says Uwe Petri , a spokesman for the German Consulate in Los Angeles . &quot; Only give a tip if you are very satisfied with the service. &quot; If you do choose to tip , give it directly to the person who waited_on you ; do not leave it on the table . Safety Germany has a low violent-crime rate , according to the U.S. State_Department . As in most countries , pickpocketing and purse snatching are most likely to occur in crowded urban_areas . When in Germany , you can get updated information on crime and security by calling the U.S. Embassy ' s toll-free , 24-hour hot_line : 0130-826364 .</TEXT>
