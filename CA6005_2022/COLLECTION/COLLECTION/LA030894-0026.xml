   <TEXT> Labor , Consumers Join Utilities Against ' Wheeling ' : Unions , independent power producers , consumer activists and environmentalists -- including San Francisco-based Toward Utility Rate Normalization and the Natural_Resources Defense Council -- announced that they oppose any move to deregulate retail electricity sales . Wholesale generation is now largely deregulated , but some big industrial power users -- including General Motors Corp . -- want to shop for electricity outside their local utility ' s territory , with that utility only delivering the power.Consumer activists and the utilities say this could let big users &quot; cherry pick &quot; low rates , leaving small businesses and residential ratepayers to pay more of their local utilities ' fixed costs . Environmentalists fear that retail deregulation could reduce utilities ' efforts to conserve fuel and reduce air_pollution . Industrial users say that retail &quot; wheeling &quot; would result in lower rates for households as well as their companies .</TEXT>
