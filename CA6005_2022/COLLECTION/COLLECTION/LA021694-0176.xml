   <HEADLINE> FIRST U.S. WOMAN FIGHTER_PILOT READY TO TAKE WING ; LT . JEANNIE FLYNN BIDED HER TIME IN FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR ' S COURSE UNTIL THE AIR_FORCE ' S COMBAT BAN WAS LIFTED . NOW SHE WILL FLY THE F-15E .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Air_Force Lt . Jeannie Flynn had never been one to buck the system . Even though she had graduated first in her pilot training class early last year , she knew the Air_Force would turn_down her request to fly its top fighter plane . Women were , after all , prohibited from serving in combat . When the expected denial came , Flynn quietly switched to Plan B and enrolled in a flight instructor course in California , hoping that some day the clouds would lift over her primary target . Then the phone_call came : the Clinton_Administration had lifted its ban against women in air combat and the Air_Force was offering her the chance to fly its screaming F-15E Strike Eagle . Now , more_than 10 months later , the 27-year-old Flynn has finished her training and will report next month to her unit -- the Fourth Wing at Seymour Johnson Air_Force Base in North Carolina -- as the first woman fighter_pilot in U.S. history . In an acknowledgment that not everyone loves a trailblazer , Flynn said Tuesday : &quot; I realize that not every person wanted this to happen . . . . But I also know that at this time , that ' s irrelevant. &quot; She added that she was excited about reporting to duty as a full-fledged combat pilot , noting : &quot; I ' ve been in training for most of my Air_Force life so far. &quot; When the Administration lifted the ban last April and permitted women to join the ranks of fighter_pilots , Flynn and 14 other women were chosen to lead the way . Flynn was ushered almost immediately into Strike Eagle qualification training at Luke Air_Force Base in Arizona , while the others began or are scheduled to start training on an array of other combat aircraft . When she reports to duty after completing a brief survival course , Flynn will find herself in control of an attack plane considered to be the most advanced in the world . Originally built by McDonnell Douglas in 1972 , the Strike Eagles were among the first aircraft that were deployed in the Persian_Gulf in August , 1990 . They led an attack on Iraqi forces on Jan . 16 , 1991 . Able to fly at low altitudes day or night and in bad_weather , the planes can fight their way to and from targets and hit them at close or long range with infrared air-to-surface_missiles and laser-guided bombs . Born in St . Louis , Flynn said that becoming a fighter_pilot was the unexpected realization of a dream . &quot; I wanted to fly ( a fighter ) but I thought the policy would be ( in_force ) for much longer than it was , &quot; she said . &quot; I was looking_at other options in case combat wasn ' t available to me. &quot; Her interest in flying began with her first trip on a commercial airliner when she was a senior at Bishop DuBourg High_School in St . Louis , where she graduated in the top 1 % of her class . Flynn went_on to study aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at Austin , graduating with honors . While in college , she enrolled in a two-year Reserve Officer Training Corps program that gave her her first taste of flying in a military jet . &quot; Once I tried that , I was hooked , &quot; Flynn said , explaining that she then began to look_at career opportunities that would allow her to fly planes -- or perhaps become an astronaut . Flynn joined the Air_Force on active duty in January , 1992 , after a yearlong wait to enroll in a pilot training course . During the hiatus , she earned her master ' s degree in aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford_University , graduating in December , 1991 . Flynn said she has long gotten_over the rejection of her first request to fly the Strike Eagle and now looks_forward to the challenge . And she has no worries about facing harassment from her male colleagues , saying she has never faced that problem in the Air_Force . &quot; What really matters is just that you ' re qualified and that you ' re competent in your job , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
