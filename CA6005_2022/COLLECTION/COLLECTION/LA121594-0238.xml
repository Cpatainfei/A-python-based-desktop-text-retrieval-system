   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL HOLIDAY CARDS CHEER CREATORS TOO ; CHILDREN WITH CANCER USE ARTWORK TO RAISE SELF-ESTEEM , CONSCIOUSNESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For most of her life , Andi Drayer , 17 , has been drawing and doing artwork of other kinds . But when she was found to have cancer in 1989 , the watercolors , paints , pens and crayons she used for pleasure suddenly became tools in her fight against illness . &quot; I was only 12 when I found_out I had cancer , &quot; Andi said . &quot; I ran_down the hall crying and throwing_up . I didn ' t think it would happen to me . Art was like the thing that got me through it , not really the radiation and chemotherapy . The art was a big part of my life . I was able to show my feelings through the art. &quot; Today , Andi is one of more_than a dozen children with cancer to have her art featured on Christmas_cards through Kids Cancer Connection Inc. , an Irvine-based nonprofit organization founded in 1989 by a group of parents dedicated to helping children with cancer and their families . Now into its fifth year , the Glad Tidings holiday card program is a therapeutic and educational effort that helps children with cancer gain a greater sense of self-worth , heightens public awareness and raises funds , said Shirley Thiel , executive_director of Kids Cancer Connection . Inside each card is a short biography of the artist , the type of illness the child has and some background about the organization . Most of the cards also have a holiday greeting . &quot; Self-esteem , for anyone , is so important , &quot; Thiel said . &quot; Here , you have a little boy or girl who has lost all their hair because of chemotherapy . You can imagine how much self-esteem they get_by seeing their cards bought by corporations and individuals. &quot; To the kids , it ' s just fun . When staff_members went_to 4-year-old Daniel Harberts ' home_in San Clemente with an armload of art supplies , he was so excited and having so_much fun scribbling that they couldn ' t get any artwork out of him , Thiel said . People who have seen the cards usually comment on how professional they look . Getting children as young as Daniel to create a workable design can be a challenge , said Nicole Whitman , special projects director . Still , the art itself is not the main purpose , she said . &quot; What I want people to realize is that Kids Cancer Connection is not about being talented , &quot; Whitman said . &quot; If they can draw , they draw . The self-esteem they get from it is incredible. &quot; To help guide the children , Joan Corman Bloch , a Laguna Beach artist , volunteers her time . When Daniel had difficulty getting started , she came_up with the idea of letting him paint the background , sprinkle salt on it to create white stars , then glue a_few cut-out yellow stars on top of it all . &quot; It ' s like a little art lesson , &quot; Bloch said . &quot; To watch them develop and do something that they ' re proud_of is what keeps people teaching . They realize at a very young age that their life could be very short and this is a lasting gift for other people. &quot; There were times when Jill Hickey , 37 , of Trabuco Canyon thought her daughter , Megan , wasn ' t going_to make_it . When Megan was 18 months old , doctors discovered a tumor in her bladder . Today , Megan has been in_remission for more_than six years and proudly totes her card around with her , showing it to teachers and friends at school . Megan likes having her art on the cards so_much that she ' s already starting her design for Christmas , 1995 , she said . &quot; I ' m doing joy , &quot; said Megan , who is also considering a career teaching art . &quot; The J is a candy_cane , the O is an ornament and the Y is holly . It ' s fun . I like meeting new people and making the picture look real. &quot; * Jill Hickey said she hopes other parents take comfort in knowing there are success stories of children recovering . She also urges other parents to become one of the 75 to 80 families on the Kids Cancer Connection mailing_list . &quot; When I was in the hospital with Megan , I wanted desperately to see success stories , &quot; Jill said . &quot; I wish we had this program at the time she was going_through treatment in San Diego . It ' s such a positive in a negative life. &quot; Andi is another success story . Her cancer is in_remission , but a barrage of radiation treatments have impaired her vision and growth . She hopes to attend UC Irvine next fall_for a possible career in art therapy . Andi works part time after school and on the weekends in the activity center at Fundazzle in the Tustin Marketplace . She also teaches art_classes to third- through sixth-graders at Vista Verde School . Seeing her daughter overcome her visual disability and be strong in the face of a deadly illness has also been inspirational for Barbara Drayer , 46 . &quot; She draws so well , &quot; the mother said . &quot; She loves to draw for them and she also comes_into contact with kids with similar experiences . She ' s able to talk to them and relate to them. &quot; * Barbara Elam , 41 , of Irvine , mother of three healthy children , has bought packs of the cards for the past four years . &quot; I ' m so fortunate my kids don ' t have cancer , &quot; said Elam , who first saw the cards in a store where she worked . &quot; I think it ' s a good cause and a good donation. &quot; A pack of 24 cards goes_for $ 15 . Also available is wrapping paper ( $ 8 for six 20-inch-by-30-inch sheets ) and note cards ( 12 cards for $ 7 ) . Organizers hope to sell $ 200 # 000 worth of cards and paper this year . Proceeds support various programs for children with cancer , such_as the annual UC Irvine Medical_Center weekend family retreat for the young patients , their parents and siblings ; the Hooked On Hopes gift-giving program for financially troubled families , and the annual childhood cancer information fair at Jonathan Jaques Children ' s Cancer Center in Long_Beach Memorial Hospital . Last year the group made $ 140 # 000 in sales , with about $ 70 # 000 forwarded to the programs . Cards can be purchased at the Kids Cancer Connection office at 17925 Sky Park Circle , Suite C , Irvine , at Pet Metro stores ( one of the Kids Cancer Connection board_members is chairman of the pet store chain ) and at various local shops . The organization also has a sales cart in the Fashion Island shopping_center in Newport Beach .
