   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : SEMIFINALS ; TODAY ' S GAMES AT A GLANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At Giants Stadium East Rutherford , N.J. Italy vs . Bulgaria * TIME : 1 p.m. PDT . * TV : ESPN , Univision . * KEY MATCHUPS : The Bulgarians need to stop the Baggios . The Italians need to stop Stoitchkov . This one is that simple . Roberto and Dino Baggio -- you ' ve read 100 times that they are not related -- have combined to bring Italy from the brink of elimination to the threshold of their fifth World Cup finale . The Baggios have combined on five of Italy ' s six goals . Dino ' s have given Italy a short-handed victory over Norway and broken a scoreless tie with Spain . Roberto ' s last-minute goals have beaten Nigeria and Spain . The Bulgarian defenders , however , think they can end all this . Since losing to Nigeria in their opener , 3-0 , they have not given_up a goal on anything other_than a penalty kick . Leading the defensive stand will be the trio of Petar Houbtchev , Zlatko Iankov and Trifon Ivanov . The task of the Italian defense is just as formidable . It must stop Hristo Stoitchkov , who is big , fast and surly . Stoitchkov has scored five of his team ' s nine goals on eight shots inside the penalty area . He doesn ' t miss much . The Italian defense will be handicapped by the loss of Mauro Tassotti , who was suspended after breaking Spaniard Luis Enrique ' s nose in the quarterfinals . * OUTLOOK : Knowing the controlling nature of the World Cup Organizing Committee , there might be a clause that prohibits lightning striking twice at the same venue . The truth is , it can ' t happen here . The Italians won ' t have to go_down to the wire this time . Italy has improved every game , to_the_point that it is probably the best team left in the tournament . If the Bulgarians concentrate_on stopping the Baggios , then who is going_to guard Giuseppe Signori or Daniele Massaro ? They are only two of the best scorers in the world . Italy is too deep for the Bulgarians . * OUTCOME : We said Bulgaria would not beat Germany in our lifetime . Oh , well . Another day , another lifetime . And we will say it again : There is no way Bulgaria can defeat Italy . Frankly , the only thing the Bulgarians have going_for them is that we are picking against them . Italy by two .
