   <HEADLINE> ROAD PROJECTS TAKE_BACK SEAT TO SEISMIC WORK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Millions of dollars in road projects designed to ease congestion on Los Angeles ' clogged freeways face lengthy delays because of a severe financial crisis in the state ' s transportation program . Rail projects critical to getting residents out of their cars may also be vulnerable as state officials attempt to make_good on their promise to give highway earthquake safety first priority for scarce transportation dollars . For Los Angeles County the crisis means that everything from the long-awaited extension of the Foothill Freeway in the San Gabriel Valley to the completion of a system of high-occupancy-vehicle lanes along the San Diego Freeway may be put_on hold . Even mass transit projects such_as the extension of the Blue Line to Pasadena and the planned east-west San Fernando Valley rail_line could be postponed as officials try to squeeze enough funds out of road and rail projects to pay_for strengthening of highway bridges susceptible to damage in severe earthquakes . The official estimate is that the projects will be delayed at least a year , but other transportation experts predict that it could be much longer , as the state continues to identify more bridges in need of earthquake retrofitting . The revenue crisis is &quot; going_to ricochet back and forth , up and down the state , &quot; said California Transportation Commission Chairwoman Octavia Diener . &quot; A lot of projects are going_to be stretched_out and take a lot longer to build , and it already takes too long to build these things. &quot; Transportation officials will use the summer months to formally pick and choose among the projects and identify which will be postponed to free up funds for retrofitting . But even as congestion-easing projects are being delayed , Los Angeles residents should not lose sight of what they are getting_in return -- the peace_of_mind that highway bridges will not collapse in a major temblor , Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) said . &quot; Los Angeles is at much greater risk because of a lack of seismic retrofit than the expansion of road projects , &quot; he said . &quot; Having to make the choice , I think seismic retrofit is much more important than new roads . We ought to make the roads that we have safe. &quot; The funding tug of war between roads and earthquake retrofitting was precipitated by the rejection of Proposition 1A in the June primary . The defeated bond measure earmarked $ 1 billion for seismic strengthening of bridges . As a result of its rejection , all bridge retrofitting costs will have to be absorbed by the transportation program , which is already facing funding shortages because of a slump in gasoline_tax revenues and voter rejection of an earlier rail bond issue . In fact , last January , even before the Northridge earthquake made seismic retrofitting a high-profile issue , Caltrans Director James van Loben Sels confided to a legislative workshop that insufficient revenues would send the state ' s transportation program &quot; off the cliff &quot; in 1995 . &quot; Because of the June 7 defeat of Proposition 1A . . . the voters shoved the program over the precipice and into a free fall about six months sooner than expected , &quot; Arthur Bauer , executive_director of Californians for Better Transportation , wrote his members in the group ' s latest newsletter . Late last week , state transportation officials determined that the second phase of their retrofitting program will involve the strengthening of an additional 1 # 364 overpasses at a cost of $ 1.05 billion . They have already identified 1 # 039 other bridges that need strengthening in the first phase of the program , which is funded . The vulnerable projects will be those , like the Foothill Freeway extension and the widening of a 35.9-mile stretch of the Antelope Valley Freeway , that are not scheduled for construction until after 1994 . Rail projects are less threatened because , in most cases , they do not have to share scarce gasoline_tax dollars with the seismic program ; much of their financing is from bond issues or specially earmarked federal funds . The catch there is that a $ 1-billion rail bond scheduled to go_on the ballot in November is considered to have little chance of passing , given the fiscally conservative mood of the voters . Some officials , including Katz , are pushing to keep the measure off the ballot rather than face what they predict is certain defeat . Without that bond issue , the state ' s transportation funding shortage would climb to about $ 3 billion , and financing would become less certain for projects such_as the Pasadena light rail_line and the San Fernando Valley ' s east-west line . &quot; If we don ' t have a bond issue or some_other way to fund those ( rail ) projects , they could be impacted ( by the crisis ) , &quot; said Linda Bohlinger , the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority ' s deputy executive_officer for capital planning . She said one hopeful sign that these projects may have a better chance of keeping_on track than the road projects is that both Katz and Quentin Kopp ( I-San Francisco ) , chairman of the state Senate Transportation Committee , are urging the Wilson Administration not to delay any mass transit projects . &quot; The rationale for leaving rail out of the freeze is that rail is the one thing that worked well both in the Loma Prieta and the Northridge earthquakes , &quot; said Katz . Caltrans officials acknowledge that road projects are the ones most likely to be postponed , but they do not yet know how many . What they do know is that delays are likely to affect most large projects scheduled for the latter half of the decade . &quot; At all those ( places ) where Angelenos spend hours in congestion , they ' re going to have to grin and bear it , because in all likelihood the state ' s not going_to have the resources to go_ahead and push those projects through on a timely schedule , &quot; said Jim Drago , Caltrans press secretary . He said an exception will be made_for highway safety projects that , like seismic projects , will get top priority for funding . But he said these are usually small , low-cost jobs that involve minor construction to straighten_out a dangerous curve or install a stoplight at a busy intersection . Drago said one of the knotty decisions facing officials will be what to do with mammoth projects that are being done_in stages over many years . Take the case of the Santa Ana Freeway widening , an ambitious , decade-long project that ultimately will double the number of lanes from southern Orange County to the Los Angeles County_line . About a third of the project is completed , another third is under way and the final phase is set to begin soon . The final segment calls_for the replacement of several bridges . If the project is delayed , the bridges would have to be earthquake retrofitted only to be torn_down in a_few years when the project is started_up again . &quot; On all these projects , we ' re going to have to weigh what makes the most sense from an engineering and financial view , &quot; Drago said . Stuck in Traffic Here are the Los Angeles County road projects that could face delays because of a financial crisis in the state ' s transportation program : * The six-mile extension of the Foothill Freeway from its terminus at Foothill Boulevard in La Verne to the San Bernardino County_line . The $ 274-million project has been the highest-priority freeway project in Los Angeles County for years because it would relieve a critical bottleneck in the fast-growing northeast sector of the county . Plans for the extension call_for the construction of four lanes -- including a car-pool lane -- in each direction . * The construction of a San Diego Freeway interchange at Arbor Vitae Street in Inglewood , a project first requested by the Los Angeles Department of Airports in 1976 . The $ 24-million project would provide access to Los Angeles International Airport from the San Diego Freeway as well as the Century Freeway . * The widening of a 35.9-mile stretch of the Antelope Valley Freeway from the Golden State Freeway in Santa Clarita to the Avenue P-8 overcrossing in Palmdale . The $ 134-million project , expected to take 10 years to complete , would add a car-pool lane in each direction . * The addition of car-pool lanes in both directions on a 7.6-mile section of the San Diego Freeway from the Orange County_line to the Long_Beach Freeway in Long_Beach . The $ 37-million project is a key element in local plans for a major high-occupancy-vehicle system designed to relieve congestion on Los Angeles County freeways . * The widening and rehabilitation of Baseline Road in the northeast part of the county , making_it a continuous four-lane highway from Foothill Boulevard in La Verne to the San Bernardino County_line . Costing $ 11 million , the 5.3-mile project is to be completed in four segments .</TEXT>
