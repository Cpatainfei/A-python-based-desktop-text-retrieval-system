   <HEADLINE> DISCOVERY OF CANCER GENE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * I ' m writing to clarify one point in an otherwise excellent article on the discovery of BRCA1 , the first inherited breast_cancer gene to be identified . Although , women who inherit this gene have a tendency to have earlier onset of breast_cancer , and ovarian cancer , a large proportion of the women who get breast_cancer from BRCA1 are not under age 30 . Many women in these families were 50 or older before developing cancer . As we become able to test individuals and families , I feel certain that it will be found that most or all cases occur after age 30 . Appropriate families for genetic counseling and testing are those with several relatives with breast , ovarian or related cancers . A genetic counselor can determine , based on family history , if gene testing is appropriate . While the testing may be a year or more away , some people may wish counseling sooner . A common misunderstanding is that genes for breast_cancer are inherited only through the mother ' s side . The genes for familial breast and colon_cancers can be inherited through the mother or the father , so analysis should include a complete history of both sides of the family . ELLEN R . KNELL Director , Medical Genetics Los Angeles Oncologic Institute St . Vincent Medical_Center * In science , it is a dictum that discoveries spawn more questions . Ellen Goodman ( Commentary , Sept . 18 ) would have had us wait for the discovery of the breast_cancer gene ; she now wants us to wait for the cure . I suggest that we should not simply &quot; wait. &quot; It is equally critical , in the interim , to attempt to resolve the many ethical , legal and financial issues that all scientific discoveries bring_to the forefront . We can use the available time to reach a consensus on such diverse and divisive issues as : a ) ethical considerations for procreation , if we know that the offspring will be subject_to a life-threatening condition ; b ) availability of health_insurance coverage for those known to be carriers of suspect genes ; c ) privacy considerations . It is possible to sit_back and complain , instead , that we want to avoid scientific progress , if we are not ready for it . D.A. PAPANASTASSIOU Pasadena</TEXT>
