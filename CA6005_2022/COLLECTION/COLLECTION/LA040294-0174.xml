   <HEADLINE> PENTAGON IS SCALING BACK ITS DRUG-FIGHTING ACTIVITIES ; MILITARY : THE MOVE IS THE RESULT OF SHARP BUDGET_CUTS , AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION ' S NEW FOCUS ON DISCOURAGING DOMESTIC NARCOTICS USE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Pentagon , which entered the war on drugs with fanfare in 1989 , is cutting spending and changing its role in fighting narcotics . The move comes partly because of recent sharp cuts_in the military budget and partly because of a high-level Clinton_Administration review that has changed the emphasis of federal drug enforcement efforts . Under the new Clinton plan , the government will be devoting more of its time and resources to discouraging drug use at_home rather than attempting to stop drug trafficking from the Caribbean and Latin_America . Lee P . Brown , director of the White_House Office of National Drug Control Policy , said in a speech earlier this year that relying largely on intercepting drug_traffic from foreign sources had proved expensive and not very effective . Brown said that while some interdiction efforts would continue , including most of those that have been carried_on or aided by U.S. military_units , &quot; our national goal must be the reduction of the overall demand for drugs in America. &quot; The Administration has begun aiming more of its drug enforcement efforts at_home , with programs designed to decrease the use of narcotics by teen-agers and college_students . As a result , with the approval of Congress , the Pentagon has eliminated 24 of its 170 counter-narcotics programs and cut its spending on anti-drug operations by $ 273 million -- a reduction of nearly one-fourth from the high of $ 1.2 billion in fiscal 1993 . The military also has begun rechanneling its efforts from trying to stop drug_traffickers on the high_seas to helping the military and police organizations in such drug-growing countries as Bolivia , Peru and Colombia stamp_out drug cartels . * The changes have drawn some protests , primarily from law_enforcement officials in states such_as Florida and Texas , who fear that the cutbacks will undermine their ability to stop drugs at the border . But Brian Sheridan , deputy assistant secretary_of_defense for drug enforcement , insists that the changes will not affect the military ' s ability to help local law_enforcement officials . &quot; We are not backing_away -- what we are doing is fine-tuning the whole effort , &quot; Sheridan says . &quot; We had a program that was fat , that was unfocused and that had no major goals or objectives . Now , it ' s lean and can be more effective again. &quot; The Pentagon ' s appetite for getting involved in the nation ' s drug enforcement effort has been constantly changing . Before 1989 , military_leaders were strongly opposed to using the armed forces for counter-narcotics missions , contending that it would distract from their war-fighting readiness . But the George_Bush Administration pushed the services into the fray , promoting drug enforcement as a reason to keep a strong military despite the breakup of the Soviet_Union . Then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney called drugs &quot; a direct threat &quot; to U.S. sovereignty . * Today , hit by demands for a U.S. military presence in Bosnia and other global hot spots and pinched by White_House and congressional spending cutbacks , the military again has lost its enthusiasm for diverting resources to the drug war . While insisting that the military will continue some interdiction efforts , Sheridan argues that Americans &quot; need to develop realistic expectations of what the Defense_Department is equipped to do . &quot; Somewhere along the line , people began to think that if the military gets_into the act , we will stop the flow of drugs into the United States flatly , &quot; Sheridan says . &quot; That is not going_to happen . We can help law_enforcement agencies . But demand for drugs is too high. &quot; Law_enforcement officials say privately that the Pentagon ' s changes probably will not make much difference , partly because much of what the Defense_Department labeled as new programs in the drug war actually were not new . For example , one federal_official points_out , the military always had some ground troops conducting training exercises in the Southwest . In 1989 , these units were renamed as part of &quot; Joint Task_Force Six , &quot; and the exercises were counted as counter-narcotics efforts . &quot; A lot of this was little more_than an accounting effort , &quot; one official says . Experienced drug enforcement officials say the military ' s efforts over the last few years have made a &quot; modest contribution &quot; to the anti-drug war , forcing traffickers to change their routes or send goods by ship . But they have not reduced the total flow of drugs . They say the military ' s most effective contribution has been to provide intelligence about aircraft and ships , as well as communications_equipment for other enforcement efforts . &quot; We ' re dealing mainly at the margin here , &quot; a drug enforcement officer says . Pentagon officials insist that most of the 24 programs they have cut were modest -- such_as a runway sensor device that had proved ineffective in detecting landings or a blimp-based radar-tracking program that could be run less expensively by land . One of the most controversial cuts involved trimming the drug enforcement budget of the National_Guard by $ 30 million -- a move that officials concede most likely will leave fewer helicopters available for eradicating marijuana plants . * The Administration also took $ 17 million out of the Defense Mapping Agency ' s $ 25-million budget_for making special counter-narcotics maps . Even so , officials say such efforts have not proved crucial , and the military is pushing to use the money elsewhere . &quot; How many anti-drug maps can you make ? &quot; a Defense_Department official asks . Officials also point to new operations that they say will continue or improve the previous drug-tracking efforts at less expense . For example , the Navy has begun using over-the-horizon radar units that can cover the entire Caribbean at a fraction of the cost of patrol_ships . Times staff writer Ronald J . Ostrow contributed to this story .</TEXT>
