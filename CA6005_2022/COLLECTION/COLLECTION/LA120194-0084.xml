   <TEXT> Residents , police and animals have been given a new code to live_by . The Palos Verdes Estates City_Council voted 5 to on Nov . 22 to enact a dangerous-animal ordinance . The city ' s Police_Department took_over animal regulation from the Los Angeles chapter of the Humane Society last year , but existing city codes did not offer police any guidance . Police_Chief Gary Johansen said the department received about six calls last year of dogs biting , and in some cases killing , other animals . Animals that seriously injure or kill people or pets are considered dangerous , as are dogs maintained for the purpose of fighting , according to the ordinance . Violating the ordinance is a misdemeanor , punishable by up_to six months in jail and a $ 1 # 000 fine for the owner , said City Atty . Stephanie Scher . Dangerous animals may be put_to_sleep or allowed to stay in the city as long as they are properly contained and identified . Owners who disagree_with police that their animals are dangerous may take their case to the Humane Society pound master . JEFF KASS</TEXT>
