   <HEADLINE> CLINTON ADVISER IS REPORTEDLY FAVORED FOR FED POST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> White_House economist Alan Blinder is likely to be nominated as vice_chairman of the Federal_Reserve_Board , a senior Clinton_Administration official said Monday . The official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said Blinder is &quot; the strong front-runner , &quot; with the support of President Clinton ' s advisers . Clinton could make his final_decision on the recommendation as early as this week , the official said . Clinton ' s approval is expected , the official said . Another official , not directly involved in the selection process , said a routine FBI background check may be the only thing standing in the way of Blinder ' s nomination . Blinder was a respected economist at Princeton_University before joining the Administration last year as one of three members of the President ' s Council of Economic Advisers . In addition to his teaching duties , Blinder wrote a regular column for Business Week magazine . He once characterized himself as an &quot; inflation dove &quot; and holds views that make him appear less hard-line in fighting inflation than some current Republican-appointed Fed members . Blinder would be Clinton ' s first Fed nominee . The vacancy was created when David Mullins , appointed by then-President George_Bush , unexpectedly announced his resignation Feb . 1 to join a private investment management firm . In addition to the vice_chairman ' s post , Clinton must fill another position on the seven-member board that was created when Wayne Angell left recently after his term expired . One of the names most often mentioned to fill the Angell vacancy is George L . Perry , an economist at the Brookings Institution , but the senior official said the White_House was not as close to naming someone to fill Angell ' s seat . It was unclear whether Perry was still in the running or whether he would accept a spot on the board if he was passed_over for the more prestigious position of vice_chairman . Clinton ' s Fed nominees must be approved by the Senate . Officials have said that the person Clinton names to the vice_chairman ' s job would have to be considered a top candidate for the post of chairman when Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan ' s term ends in 1996 .</TEXT>
