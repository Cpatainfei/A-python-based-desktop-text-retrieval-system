   <HEADLINE> OPPOSING VIEWS ON IMMIGRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The major party candidates for U.S. Senate -- Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Michael Huffington -- began airing new statewide television commercials last week about immigration . Both commercials respond to attacks by the opponent ' s campaign . * THE FEINSTEIN AD : It opens by showing a San Francisco Chronicle editorial while an off-camera narrator explains : &quot; The Chronicle says : ' The Huffington ad blatantly distorts Feinstein ' s record on the issue of illegal immigration ' and calls it ' a plain and simple lie. ' &quot; The ad then features a graphic of a Senate immigration vote by Feinstein followed by a picture of a letter to President Clinton . The narration continues : &quot; The truth : Feinstein ' s leading the fight against illegal immigration . Her leadership secured funding for 600 new border guards -- funding that Congressman Huffington voted against , three times . And Huffington is the only California Congress member who refused to sign this letter to the President to repay Californians the cost of illegal immigration. &quot; It ends : &quot; Congressman Huffington . He ' ll say anything to get elected. &quot; * THE ANALYSIS : Feinstein ' s ad responds to a charge Huffington made in a commercial that attacked the Democrat ' s claim she is tough on illegal immigration . The Huffington ad contended that a 1985 resolution Feinstein signed while mayor of San Francisco ordered police to violate federal law by not reporting illegal immigrants . Feinstein supporters said the non-binding resolution recommended that police and other city officials should not initiate the deportation of refugees fleeing a particularly violent period in El_Salvador and Guatemala . An editorial in the Chronicle recently called Huffington ' s claim a &quot; lie &quot; because the resolution ' s language addressed the relationship with federal law . The ad ' s claim that Feinstein helped secure 600 new border guards refers to the senator ' s support for a recent appropriations_bill . Huffington said he favors more border guards , but he opposed the appropriations_bill because he said it included other wasteful spending . Huffington also said he did not sign the letter to the President because he sent a separate one that called_for even more funding reimbursement to the state . * THE HUFFINGTON AD : It begins with Harold W . Ezell , former western regional commissioner of the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service , speaking_to the camera . &quot; I know a lot about immigration , &quot; Ezell says . &quot; I was regional commissioner . You ' ve seen ads about San Francisco ' s sanctuary policy . Mike Huffington is right. &quot; The ad then shows a picture of a 1985 San Francisco Chronicle story , highlighting a headline about the sanctuary vote and a phrase in the story that says &quot; in defiance of federal law. &quot; Ezell continues : &quot; When Dianne Feinstein declared San Francisco a sanctuary , a safe haven for illegal aliens , it was in defiance of federal law. &quot; Picturing Ezell again , he continues : &quot; Feinstein ' s hometown newspaper would have you believe something different , but I know the truth , I was there . Feinstein ' s policy encouraged the invasion of illegals into California. &quot; * THE ANALYSIS : The ad is Huffington ' s second attempt to persuade voters that Feinstein and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors violated federal law by passing the 1985 sanctuary resolution . Huffington bases his claim on two sources : a 1985 San Francisco Chronicle news_story that used the phrase &quot; in defiance of federal law &quot; and Ezell , a former federal immigration official under President Ronald Reagan and a prominent Republican activist . Chronicle Editor Bill German said recently that the newspaper ' s 1985 news_story that contained the phrase &quot; in defiance of federal law &quot; was incorrect . In fact , the resolution addresses the issue of federal law . It refers to a federal_court decision that said a local_government is not required to provide an individual ' s immigration status to federal authorities . It also added : &quot; The city and county of San Francisco is not , in adopting this resolution , encouraging its employees and citizens to violate any local , state or federal laws. &quot;</TEXT>
