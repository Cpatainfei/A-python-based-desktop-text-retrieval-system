   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; MEXICO KILLINGS STIR FEARS OVER THE SYSTEM ' S STABILITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The second major political assassination in six months raised questions Thursday about the continuing effectiveness of the system that has kept this nation stable for six decades . At the least , the virtual one-party system -- which Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa has called &quot; a perfect dictatorship &quot; -- seemed less so as federal police began to slowly provide information and correct Wednesday ' s misinformation about the killing of yet another prominent figure . Atty . Gen . Humberto Benitez said late Thursday that Francisco Ruiz Massieu -- the second-ranking official in the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , which has ruled this country for 65 years -- was killed by an Intratec 9-millimeter handgun and that the suspect in the slaying had previously been misidentified . The suspect in custody is now believed to be Daniel Aguilar Trevino from the northern state of Tamaulipas , where authorities on Wednesday conducted sweeps against the &quot; Gulf &quot; drug cartel . He told authorities that two men paid him the equivalent of $ 17 # 000 to commit the killing , Benitez said . The weapon used to kill Ruiz Massieu has been traced to a community in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas , U.S. law_enforcement sources said Thursday . Benitez refused to take questions after reading a brief statement or to confirm information about the gun that U.S. authorities , who helped with the investigation , said is a model known as a &quot; Tec 9 &quot; and was purchased in an unnamed border city . It was not immediately clear who made the purchase or when . Ballistics tests_match the bullet that killed Ruiz Massieu to the gun , Benitez said . Aguilar Trevino allegedly said in his statement to police that he was hired by Carlos Angel Cantu from his village of Corralejo in San Carlos county in Tamaulipas , a state with a reputation for violence and illegal drugs . Cantu and Aguilar Trevino arrived in the capital three weeks ago , and , for the four days before the killing , stayed_at the home of Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez , whom Aguilar Trevino identified from a photograph , Benitez said . Cantu and Rodriguez Gonzalez showed the suspect a magazine photo of Ruiz Massieu , and Cantu accompanied him to the murder scene , the attorney_general said . Warrants have been issued for the arrest of Cantu and Rodriguez Gonzalez on murder_charges , Benitez said . He provided no explanation for why they might have hired the suspect to kill Ruiz Massieu . The mixup about identity -- which Benitez attributed to the suspect ' s having initially misidentified himself , then clarified when he made his formal statement -- exacerbated lack of public confidence in law_enforcement ' s ability to solve crimes . As the investigation continued , Mexicans mourned and confronted doubts about their political_system , public safety and the seeming impunity of drug dealers as they conducted funeral services for Ruiz Massieu . Coming just six months after the assassination of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio , Ruiz Massieu ' s slaying heightens worries that Mexico could be returning to the days of political violence that this nation endured in the 1920s , which led to the formation of the PRI as a peaceful way to broker power struggles . Ruiz Massieu was fatally shot Wednesday morning in front of a downtown hotel as he left a breakfast for his party ' s recently elected federal deputies . His body lay_in state at party headquarters Wednesday evening , later being moved to a funeral_home in the south of the capital , where a small group of mourners gathered Thursday morning , until he was taken_to the Spanish Cemetery for cremation . Citizens paying tribute to the politician got_into a shouting match as they reviewed the events that have shaken their country this year . &quot; The person who pulled the trigger did not do this on_his_own ; there was somebody behind him , &quot; said Maria Concepcion Moguel , 60 , a retired government employee . Juan Manuel Zavala Sanchez , 50 , an engineer , answered sharply , &quot; You do not know that. &quot; &quot; that ' s my opinion , &quot; she snapped back . &quot; And what about Colosio ? &quot; shouted another voice from the crowd , weaving an elaborate conspiracy theory . &quot; Do you know when this is going_to be solved ? &quot; &quot; Never , &quot; responded Moguel . &quot; It ' s the PRI , the system itself . They are killing each other. &quot; &quot; They are trying to blame it on drug dealers , &quot; said one man , who would not give his name . &quot; Who is going_to believe that ? &quot; But U.S. law_enforcement sources said they find plausible the scenario that drug_traffickers had killed Ruiz Massieu to send a message to his brother , Deputy Atty . Gen . Mario Ruiz Massieu . &quot; It ' s a good theory , &quot; a U.S. official said . &quot; But that ' s all it is -- a theory . Mario Ruiz has been_active in directing ( anti-drug ) operations and providing manpower to go_after the cartels. &quot; Any of Mexico ' s top drug cartels could have been involved in the slaying , the official said . Mario Ruiz Massieu also had visibly stepped_up efforts to capture Benjamin , Javier and Ramon Arellano , the drug lords believed to have masterminded a Guadalajara airport shootout last year . Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo was killed in that incident . The Arellano brothers have recently been identified as suspects in the slaying earlier this year of Tijuana Police_Chief Jose Federico Benitez . Last week , a special team of more_than 150 federal police agents swooped into Baja California to press the hunt for the fugitive Arellanos , leaders of the Tijuana cartel . The raids resulted in 15 arrests , including a cartel lieutenant and a former chief homicide detective of the Baja state police ; the detective is accused of helping Ramon Arellano escape a March shootout between corrupt state officers and federal_agents . The Arellanos are considered particularly violence-prone and are influential enough to have eluded capture with the help of a protective network of corrupt officials . The simultaneously brazen and bumbling style of the Ruiz Massieu assassination , in which the gunman ' s weapon -- capable of either fully automatic or semiautomatic fire -- jammed after firing a single bullet , resembles previous incidents involving Arellano hit_men . But U.S. law_enforcement officials familiar_with Mexican cartels were reluctant to speculate whether the Arellanos or other kingpins would choose to strike back at law_enforcement by killing a political figure . The possible involvement of drug dealers , though , gives renewed credence to concerns about an alliance between narcotics cartels and some political factions . Concern about violence was an important issue in last month ' s presidential election , which Colosio ' s successor , Ernesto Zedillo , won after a campaign that emphasized peace and stability . Reform of the judicial_system , from police to the courts , was an important plank in his platform . &quot; The seed of instability has been planted in the country , &quot; Moguel said . &quot; Now besides the hunger we have in this country , there is also fear. &quot; Darling reported from Mexico_City and Rotella from San Diego .
