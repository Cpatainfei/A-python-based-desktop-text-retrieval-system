   <HEADLINE> THEATER ; THE ' BEAUTY ' OF BROADWAY ; DISNEY EYES THE FUTURE : IF THE STAGE VERSION OF ' BEAUTY AND THE BEAST ' IS A HIT ON BROADWAY , ' ALADDIN ' AND OTHERS ARE IN THE WINGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Actor Gary Beach was watching the movie &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; at Hollywood ' s El Capitan Theatre a_few years ago when the Disney film ' s suave French candlestick , Lumiere , started singing &quot; Be Our Guest. &quot; &quot; Why doesn ' t somebody write a part like this for me ? &quot; Beach wondered . A few years later , somebody did . Disney ' s &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; opens on Broadway on April 18 with the animated film ' s score , songs and sentiment essentially intact . But this time around , Belle , the Beast and the Enchanted Objects -- including Beach as Lumiere -- are live . Few films , animated or otherwise , have received the kind of encouragement to move onstage that &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; has . It won Oscars for both best score and best song , and film and theater_critics alike compared it favorably to staged musicals . The New York Times ' then-drama critic , Frank Rich , called the film ' s score &quot; the best Broadway musical_score of 1991. &quot; Such remarks inspired Disney to take &quot; Beauty &quot; to Broadway . So , of course , did the film ' s phenomenal success . The feature , the first animated film to be nominated for a best picture Oscar , grossed $ 146 million domestically , another $ 200 million internationally . More_than 22 million video units have been sold , and until it was topped by &quot; Aladdin &quot; -- now at more_than 24 million -- &quot; Beauty &quot; was the best-selling video ever made . The big question was would it work as well onstage as on film ? &quot; The creative team had to convince us that you could translate this onto the stage ( and ) keep the basic integrity of the work , &quot; says Disney Chairman and Chief_Executive_Officer Michael D . Eisner . &quot; It had to stand on its own but grow out of the movie. &quot; &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; is surely the first Broadway show to be developed first as storyboards . As the musical took_form , set designer Stan Meyer and his staff created 140 intricate black-and-white renderings . Many of them featured arrows to show the directions people , props or sets moved . Meyer counts 73 different settings in the final show , with 42 of them in the first act alone . The show , starring Susan Egan as Belle and Terrence Mann as the Beast , adds six songs , including one written originally for the film , as well as plenty of magic and special_effects . The &quot; tale as old as time &quot; remains the classic fairy tale -- as interpreted by Disney . Sweet , adventurous Belle offers herself as a prisoner in place of her father , Maurice , when he is imprisoned by the Beast ( who is , of course , an enchanted prince ) . Assisted by a household of servants who ' ve been transformed into objects , and undeterred by her vain suitor Gaston , Belle eventually sees beneath the Beast ' s foul exterior , loves him and breaks the evil spell . Will the people who bought all those movie tickets and videos buy theater_tickets as well ? Many already have . The show broke box-office records at Houston ' s Theatre Under the Stars , where it tried_out before landing in New York , and it opens on Broadway with advance sales reportedly at more_than $ 6 million . That advance , however , is still far below that of &quot; Miss Saigon , &quot; which had a London run to build interest and a record $ 37 million during two years of advance ticket sales ; even &quot; The Goodbye Girl , &quot; which closed after less than six months , opened_to a $ 10-million advance last season . And with a budget that Eisner pegs at &quot; under $ 12 million &quot; -- a figure comparable_to mounting &quot; Sunset Boulevard &quot; at Century City ' s Shubert Theatre -- &quot; Beauty &quot; is among the costliest shows ever to hit Broadway . &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; is also the first venture of Walt Disney Theatrical_Productions Ltd. , a new entity that could wind_up transferring other Disney properties to the stage . Disney also recently signed preliminary agreements with the city and state of New York to restore and reopen Broadway ' s historic New Amsterdam Theatre . Corporate attention to &quot; Beauty &quot; has been considerable , Eisner concedes . He and Jeffrey Katzenberg , chairman of the Walt Disney Studios , went_to all major auditions and participated in so many creative sessions that director Robert Jess Roth personally bought Katzenberg a notebook to jot_down suggestions . Eisner , who majored in theater in college and even wrote a_few ( &quot; very sophomoric &quot; ) plays there , readily acknowledges that he ' s been having a good time . But &quot; fun , &quot; he makes clear , is just one reason for his own major involvement . &quot; The image of our company is at stake here . We ' re going to the media capital of the world. &quot; Talk_of a &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; stage adaptation started soon after the film was released in fall , 1991 . Eisner and Katzenberg called key staff people at Walt Disney Attractions , which oversees the company ' s worldwide entertainment projects , and asked them to appoint a creative team to look_into it . Roth , Meyer and choreographer Matt West were assigned to the project . The three , all_in their 30s , had each come_to Disney with professional theater experience . At Disney they staged mini-musicals such_as &quot; Mickey ' s Nutcracker &quot; and &quot; Motorcar Madness &quot; for theme parks and other Disney enterprises . They created a new adventure for Dick Tracy , for instance , around the time Disney released the film in 1990 . Their biggest project before &quot; Beauty and the Beast , &quot; the Dick Tracy mini-musical was designed for the Anaheim and Orlando parks , ran 30 minutes and cost more_than $ 1 million . Learning about computerized scenery and other sophisticated staging , Roth says , &quot; was good education for us and proved very useful now. &quot; They had all seen &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; the day the film opened in Hollywood , driving_in together from their homes_in Long_Beach . Assigned to investigate the film ' s stage potential , they went_back to see it again in a Long_Beach mall , and this time they took_notes . Bundling_up Linda Woolverton ' s film script , they went_off to Las Vegas for one weekend , to Palm Springs for another . To refresh their memories , they ' d stop in movie_theaters to see the film again . Over the next several weeks , a basic stage structure evolved with songs , locations , possible entrances and exits . Begun as doodles tossed_off during an airplane flight , Meyer ' s sketches grew more and more formal . Eventually , they emerged as 140 storyboards done_in quarter-inch scale on 11-by-17-inch boards ( to fit a photocopier ) . While design sketches are common in the theater and can easily number in the dozens on a big show , rarely do they suggest stage_directions . &quot; We felt ( the sketches ) had to be totally clean and figured_out , because Michael and Jeffrey were used to this scale of presentation , &quot; Meyer says . &quot; We were trying to get them to say yes. &quot; In July , 1992 , Roth led a presentation to Disney executives in an Aspen , Colo. , hotel conference_room . They reviewed fabric swatches , costume sketches and a boy-as-teacup illusion . Then , narrating a slide show of the storyboards , Roth talked his listeners through the entire show . At the end of his presentation , Roth recalls , &quot; Michael said , ' OK , we ' re going to do this. ' &quot; Disney next brought the &quot; Beauty &quot; stage and film teams together at L.A. ' s Four Seasons Hotel . Screenwriter Woolverton , who was called_back from a Hawaiian vacation to attend the event , concedes that &quot; it was a daunting prospect given the magic element and translating objects onstage. &quot; It was not a surprising prospect , however . Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman created the hit musical &quot; Little Shop of Horrors &quot; before moving_on to &quot; The Little Mermaid &quot; and &quot; Beauty. &quot; Woolverton , who has a master ' s degree in theater for children , even ran her own children ' s theater for a while , and says the three would often talk_about the theatricality of their film . &quot; I thought , foolishly , that it would be more of a physical than storytelling problem , &quot; Woolverton says . &quot; But when we really started working_on it ( in January , 1993 ) the prospect became much more a storytelling problem. &quot; Just one scene wound_up exactly the same as the film , she says , and it has been altered during previews . Characters changed as they became three-dimensional , and , Woolverton says , &quot; the tone is different -- I wanted to expand the characters and put a little more sophisticated spin on them. &quot; She heightened the chemistry between Beauty and the Beast &quot; so we discover with them what they have in common. &quot; Their developing Tracy-Hepburn-style relationship existed in the film , Woolverton says , but is more apparent in the stage version . Back is the song &quot; Human Again &quot; that Menken and Ashman wrote originally for the film , and composer Menken has said he tried to construct the show ' s five new songs from musical_themes in the film so they would seem familiar . ( The new songs have lyrics by Tim Rice , the_British lyricist who also wrote lyrics for &quot; Aladdin. &quot; ) That left the problem everyone worried about : how to portray the Enchanted Objects onstage . The creative team chose to suggest objects , Meyer says , rather than have them be objects . Beach , for instance , says he plays not a candlestick but &quot; a man turning_into a candlestick ; my hands light_up , and my feet look_like the base of a huge candelabra. &quot; Costumes help , since identities need to be clear for children as well as adults . To test themselves , the show ' s creators drew_on what Roth calls the &quot; Leah factor. &quot; Costume_designer Ann Hould-Ward , who also designed costumes for &quot; Into the Woods , &quot; has a 7-year-old daughter named Leah and , says Roth , &quot; we wanted Leah to be able to look_at sketches and say , ' that ' s Lumiere. ' &quot; Rock ' n ' roll fan Roth also tapped rock concert-style lighting and theatrics for his show , studying the appearance and sexuality of rock_stars for use in creating the stage ' s Beast . At the end of the first act , when the Beast sings his lament &quot; If I can ' t Love Her , &quot; Meyer says , &quot; the costume , setting and lighting all come_together . The focus is totally on the Beast . He ' s like a rock star. &quot; &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; arrived in New York after 50 performances at Houston ' s Theatre Under the Stars . Eisner says the 3 # 000-seat arena was selected in part because it was far enough away from Los Angeles &quot; to give the show room to breathe. &quot; It was hardly out_of_sight , out of mind , however . Eisner went_to Houston 10 times , he says , and figures he talked to Roth almost every day by phone . Director Roth , in turn , calls Eisner and Katzenberg &quot; part of the creative team. &quot; &quot; They ' d come watch the show , we ' d go_to a room at the theater , and they ' d have lots of notes , &quot; he says . &quot; Their involvement led to a lot of discussions about how to make things clearer ; because they were not there every day , they had fresh eyes. &quot; But Meyer disputes media reports that Roth was hired because he could be easily controlled by corporate brass . &quot; This production is really Robert Roth ' s production of ' Beauty and the Beast , ' &quot; Meyer says . &quot; They didn ' t pick Rob to tell him what to do . ( Eisner and Katzenberg ) were involved , but they weren ' t in the rehearsal halls . . . . Rob is definitely not a puppet for them. &quot; Asked about staffing the stage show , Eisner talks company loyalty more_than malleability : &quot; We produce in the U.S. more live entertainment and spend more on our attractions than all_of Broadway put_together . . . . It seemed to me to do Broadway and not do_it with our own people , people who worked with us , was unfair . It would be inappropriate. &quot; It would also be more expensive , particularly with the major players generally selected for such big-budget musicals . Although Broadway veterans do appear backstage as well as onstage , the show ' s producer , director and set designer are making their Broadway debuts . &quot; We always believed_in nurturing new people , &quot; Eisner says . &quot; It is definitely an economic issue but not the overriding issue . The overriding issue is talent . The expensive part of putting_on the show is putting_on the show , not a_few salaries . But if you have the talent and have seen ( it ) with your own eyes , why would you go_to anyone else ? &quot; &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; also represents a new corporate direction for Disney , one of the few Hollywood studios to resist previous Broadway involvement . Both Eisner and Katzenberg have long been interested in theater , as a business as well as an art_form , and a confluence of factors finally made the timing right . Earlier , says Eisner , he didn ' t want to divert corporate attention &quot; towards something limited to one theater , extremely risky and , for a lot of people , a hobby. &quot; But as Eisner saw Disney profits climb in other areas , so did his appreciation of the enormous profits possible in the theater . He was watching composer-producer Andrew Lloyd Webber and mega-producer Cameron Mackintosh , Eisner says , &quot; and the afterlife of some of their shows . If you can hit , it makes_it economically viable for a big company . You can create content , or software , for future use as part of your inventory. &quot; The show ' s Beast , Terrence Mann , received a Tony nomination playing Rum Tum Tugger in &quot; Cats , &quot; and Disney has obviously noted the Mackintosh merchandising acumen that helped &quot; Cats &quot; hit $ 2 billion in worldwide grosses earlier this year . &quot; Beauty &quot; programs and cast albums were also ready during previews , very rare on Broadway , and already open in New York are Bloomingdale ' s ' Beauty &amp; the Beast &quot; shops . Disney is the show ' s sole Broadway producer , and Disney Theatrical producer Robert McTyre says Disney will &quot; almost certainly &quot; remain the sole producer on domestic tours . International touring will probably require local affiliates , McTyre adds , reporting interest already from such places as Australia , Mexico , England , Germany , Israel , Canada and Japan . Other Disney stage ventures also seem likely , given both Disney ' s frequently expressed commitment to live entertainment and the company ' s planned restoration of New York ' s New Amsterdam Theatre . Terms call_for Disney to contribute $ 8 million toward restoring the 91-year-old theater , the country ' s first major Art Nouveau building , plus take_on a $ 21-million loan for the rest from the public sector . Should final negotiations and construction go according to plan , the theater could reopen as early as fall , 1996 . &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; plays Broadway ' s Palace Theatre , but McTyre says Disney hopes its next production will open the New Amsterdam . Pressed to name likely candidates , he mentions &quot; Aladdin , &quot; &quot; The Little Mermaid &quot; and &quot; Mary Poppins &quot; ( which has also been mentioned by Lloyd Webber as a possible future project ) , &quot; not necessarily in that order. &quot; Like &quot; Beauty , &quot; all three musicals won Oscars for best score and best song . And &quot; Aladdin &quot; has already topped &quot; Beauty &quot; in both film grosses and video sales . Disney keeps turning_out more potential stage fodder , of course . &quot; The Lion King &quot; opens this summer with music and lyrics by Elton John and Tim Rice , while Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz teamed for 1995 ' s &quot; Pocahontas &quot; and &quot; The Hunchback of Notre Dame. &quot; Also on the roster are Schwartz ' s &quot; Fa Mulan , &quot; based on a Chinese folk tale , &quot; Hercules , &quot; with songs by Menken and lyricist David Zippel , and a reteaming of John and Rice for &quot; Aida. &quot; Possible , too , are original musicals and dramas . Disney will also look_to see what might be adapted for the screen , Eisner says , acknowledging even the possibility of a live-action film version of &quot; Beauty and the Beast. &quot; And if &quot; Beauty &quot; is not a Broadway smash ? &quot; I think we ' d be pretty disappointed if it didn ' t work , &quot; Eisner says . &quot; There was a standing_ovation every night in Houston and every night here ( in previews ) , and everybody calls and tells me they love it . If you get that kind of reaction in the movie business , it generally follows_through after the opening . I would be surprised and shocked and re-evaluate my own sense of understanding the market . But I would still be committed to go forward. &quot;</TEXT>
