   <HEADLINE> N . KOREA , U.S. NEAR NUCLEAR ARMS PACT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration is preparing to conclude a far-reaching new agreement with North_Korea that will permanently freeze that country ' s nuclear_weapons program but also will postpone for several years the requirement that it submit to special inspections of its nuclear waste dumps , U.S. officials said Friday . Under the deal , the United States and North_Korea will set_up liaison offices in each other ' s capitals within six months , the first_step toward establishing diplomatic relations . The Clinton_Administration will drop its earlier insistence that radioactive nuclear fuel rods now sitting outside the North_Korean nuclear plant at Yongbyon be transported out of the country , agreeing instead that they can be stored inside North_Korea . The accord is expected to be signed within the next two or three days in Geneva , where Special Ambassador Robert L . Gallucci has been negotiating with representatives of North_Korea . U.S. officials cautioned Friday that there still could be some last-minute hitch to delay the deal . But Administration officials have begun briefing Congress and the South_Korean government on details , and Assistant Secretary_of_State Winston Lord said Friday that the United States and North_Korea &quot; may be_on the verge of a rather significant breakthrough. &quot; The proposed deal will enable the Clinton_Administration to claim victory for persuading North_Korea to stop its nuclear program . It may also provide ammunition for Republicans and conservatives to attack the Administration for making concessions to Pyongyang . * The reported terms of the deal also drew sharp criticism in Seoul . Critics declared that the United States had sold_out South_Korea ' s interests . They said delaying the inspections could allow North_Korea to continue dodging questions about its nuclear capacity . &quot; There are too many concessions and nothing gained for the South_Korean side , &quot; said one government adviser and expert on North_Korea . &quot; There are two winners , the United States and North_Korea , and one loser -- South Korea. &quot; But Hangyoreh , a leftist newspaper in Seoul , said : &quot; It ' s a big breakthrough . It ' s a disappointment to hard-liners , but we have to learn to live with North Korea. &quot; The special inspections requested by the International Atomic Energy Agency are aimed at finding_out how much nuclear fuel North_Korea has already produced . By the CIA ' s estimate , North_Korea possesses enough weapons-grade plutonium to make one or two nuclear bombs . In sharp questioning over the reported deal before the National Assembly on Friday , Deputy Prime_Minister Lee Hong Koo told legislators that the government was not satisfied with the terms but had to accept them to prevent the outbreak of another war on the Korean_peninsula . Experts here said the U.S. interest in keeping North_Korea in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -- even at the price of tolerating Pyongyang ' s possession of one or two bombs -- was fundamentally different from South_Korea ' s interest . Unlike the United States , South_Korea is directly threatened by even one bomb and so has tried to argue furiously for the inspections of Pyongyang ' s nuclear facilities . But Seoul failed -- a smashing diplomatic triumph for Pyongyang , one expert said . * Selig Harrison , a specialist on North_Korea at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington , said the proposed deal &quot; is a true compromise . . . reflecting diplomacy at its best. &quot; Harrison has argued for several years that North_Korea would be willing to bargain away its nuclear capability in exchange for political and economic benefits from the West . In August , U.S. and North_Korean negotiators in Geneva reached a first , vague and preliminary agreement that set_out the goals both countries wanted to achieve . The United States said it would agree to exchange liaison offices with North_Korea at some point and would arrange for North_Korea to get new civilian light-water nuclear technology for energy production , if Pyongyang would freeze its nuclear_weapons program . But that earlier agreement left the most important questions unanswered -- such_as when the diplomatic liaison offices would be set_up , what country would supply the light-water technology and what would happen to the 8 # 000 fuel rods now cooling in a pool outside the Yongbyon reactor . Moreover , there was no agreement in August on the crucial issue of when international inspectors could examine nuclear waste dumps near Yongbyon . North_Korean negotiators later said they had no intention of ever permitting special inspections . If it is finally signed , the proposed new agreement will go much further and be much more detailed than the previous one . * In a new concession , Pyongyang will agree to let South_Korea take the lead role in providing North_Korea with new light-water civilian nuclear technology , which is worth about $ 4 billion . The United States and its allies have said they are willing to supply this light-water technology to Pyongyang , because it cannot be used to make fuel for nuclear_weapons as easily as North_Korea ' s current gas-graphite nuclear facilities . South_Korea has been seeking the right to supply this light-water technology to North_Korea , both because the contracts are economically important and because Seoul hopes that , some day , a reunified Korea will have all its nuclear plants using the same technology . Until now , however , North_Korea had demanded that the equipment to come from Russia or Germany . In the most significant compromise in the new accord , North_Korea would explicitly agree for the first time to submit to the special inspections of two sites where it is believed to have dumped nuclear wastes . But in a concession of its own , the Clinton_Administration would agree that the inspections need not take_place for three to five years , until after significant amounts of the new light-water technology and equipment arrive in North_Korea . Under the deal , North_Korea would also agree not to reprocess the 8 # 000 fuel rods and would promise not to refuel or start_up its current nuclear_reactor at Yongbyon . In exchange , the United States would agree to let the fuel rods remain inside North_Korea . Russia reportedly had said that it was willing to accept storage of the rods on its soil in exchange for money , but North_Korea did not want the rods shipped out of the country . Meanwhile , North_Korea ends a 100-day mourning period for the late President Kim Il Sung today with a ceremony that could reveal whether his son , Kim Jong Il , is being formally named the nation ' s leader . The younger Kim has not been named head of the Korean government or its ruling Communist_Party , and there has been speculation in the West that he is suffering from some undisclosed illness .
