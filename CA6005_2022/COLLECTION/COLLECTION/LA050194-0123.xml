   <HEADLINE> MOVIES ; BUILDING THE MODEL ACTRESS ; IT HASN ' T BEEN EASY , DESPITE HER HIGH-PROFILE PARENTS AND A TENDENCY TO SURROUND HERSELF WITH TALENTED MEN . BUT WITH HER FIRST LEADING ROLE BEHIND HER , ISABELLA ROSELLINI FINALLY FEELS SOME CONFIDENCE AS AN ACTRESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I ' ve been reluctant to take myself seriously as an actress , &quot; admits Isabella Rossellini , &quot; and that ' s probably because of who my parents were , and because of the wonderfully talented people like Martin Scorsese and David Lynch who ' ve surrounded my life . I felt I was expected to have a career as big as theirs , and that was difficult for me to get past . &quot; It wasn ' t until recently that I began to feel I know something of the craft of acting , and though I still have a lot to learn , I think I ' ve made progress , &quot; adds the 41-year-old actress , who has her first leading role in &quot; The Innocent , &quot; John Schlesinger ' s political thriller set against the backdrop of World_War_II , which opens next month . &quot; Working with John Schlesinger was a breakthrough for me because he told me I was a good actress and somehow made me believe him , &quot; adds Rossellini , who co-stars with Anthony Hopkins and Campbell Scott in the film . &quot; He was able to convince me because John is very fatherly , and if daddy tells you something then it must be true , &quot; she laughs . The director of such critically acclaimed films as &quot; Midnight Cowboy &quot; and &quot; Far From the Madding Crowd , &quot; Schlesinger admits to being &quot; a little concerned about whether Isabella would be able to handle the role during early rehearsals for the film , because she seemed curiously withheld . &quot; But an indefinable alchemy happened between her and me , and one day we had an extraordinary breakthrough session -- from then on my confidence in her was total . I don ' t often say this about my own films , but I think she ' s remarkable in the part. &quot; If Rossellini ' s pedigreed bloodlines made her reluctant to jump into acting feet first -- she is the daughter of actress Ingrid Bergman and Italian filmmaker Roberto Rossellini -- her extraordinary beauty posed a bit of a problem too . Best known as the signature face of the Lancome cosmetics line , Rossellini worked as a model before breaking_into film , and everybody knows models can ' t do anything but be beautiful . &quot; When you start_out as a model and then become an actress , it ' s always held against you , &quot; points_out Joel Schumacher , who directed Rossellini in the 1989 film &quot; Cousins. &quot; &quot; People assume great beauties aren ' t as intelligent or as deep , and there seems to be a desperate need to find the fatal flaw in every beautiful woman . &quot; But women like Isabella are rare -- she ' s a very accessible beauty and is human and down to earth . She ' s already turned_in some tremendous performances -- she was amazing in ' Blue Velvet , ' for instance -- and I think she has yet to do her best work. &quot; Rossellini herself scoffs at the idea that her beauty has been a problem in her pursuit of an acting career . &quot; I ' m losing my beauty , &quot; laughs Rossellini , who can also be seen this summer in Lawrence Kasdan ' s &quot; Wyatt Earp , &quot; &quot; so it doesn ' t get_in the way at all . I ' m 41 and although I may have the beauty of a 41-year-old woman , that ' s not the kind of beauty that ' s celebrated in this culture. &quot; Of her role in Wyatt Earp , Rossellini explains : &quot; I play Doc Holiday ' s girlfriend Big Nose Kate , who was one of the ugliest creatures I ' ve ever seen -- she ' s lucky they just picked on her nose , &quot; she laughs . &quot; She was a Hungarian woman , stocky and strong , and she looked_like a man . When I saw a photo of her I asked Larry Kasdan if he wanted me to wear a mask with a fake nose and he said , ' It ' s not important that you look_like her -- what ' s important is that you convey the violence of her relationship with Doc Holiday. ' &quot; Rossellini ' s being a bit disingenuous in saying she ' s losing her looks -- she ' s still a stunningly attractive woman ; moreover , women of a certain age are currently making unprecedented inroads in the beauty industry . Briefly in L.A. to tend to some odds and ends of business , she meets a reporter in a hotel_room , and upon entering the suite exclaims , &quot; Everywhere I go this cart of hors d ' oeuvres seems to follow me. &quot; An unpretentious woman with a bawdy sense_of_humor , a hearty , barnyard laugh and the physical elegance of an aristocrat , she ' s a wonderful juxtaposition of opposites . And she is recognizably the daughter of Ingrid Bergman -- like her mother , she exudes a luminous grace one rarely sees in movie_stars . Growing_up surrounded by famous movie people , however , left Rossellini decidedly ambivalent about the profession . &quot; There ' s always been a part of me that ' s very angry with film , &quot; she confesses , &quot; because film took_away my parents , my lovers , my husbands . It took them away on trips , to other lovers , to other families , so my relationship to movies is very personal and complicated. &quot; * Born in Rome in 1952 a_few seconds before her twin sister , Pia , arrived , Rossellini moved to Paris with her family at age 3 , and spent her childhood and adolescence shuttling between her parents , who divorced when she was quite young , in Paris , Rome and later , London . &quot; When I think_of myself as a child , the image that comes_to_mind is dirt -- I was a very busy child and I was always dirty , spotted and stained , &quot; she recalls . &quot; We lived mostly in hotels because my parents were always on_the_road , and I didn ' t know that was strange , or that I led a privileged life . I wasn ' t aware my parents were special , and never knew how famous they were . I remember being at school and asking my friend , ' Is my mother as famous as Joan Crawford ? How about Greta Garbo ? ' I had little understanding of any of this . &quot; My father worried about the prospect of me becoming an actress because there ' s very little work in Europe and the film_industry there is in bad shape , &quot; she says . &quot; And , I grew_up well aware that my mother was persecuted by the U.S. film_industry -- she suffered and I knew it . ( Ingrid Bergman was blackballed from Hollywood after giving_birth to Rossellini ' s older brother , Roberto , out of wedlock , in 1949. ) &quot; I was too_little to read the papers at the time , but she ' d tell me what they wrote , and I remember her being very sad and frightened about it . Famous people get_away with more , but more is expected of them too , and though people say to me , ' What happened to your mother could never happen in America now , ' I see it happening all_the time . &quot; Growing_up I didn ' t see a lot of movies , &quot; she adds . &quot; I probably saw more movies than factories , but I wasn ' t dazzled by movies and never felt , ' This is a world I must enter. ' It ' s different in Europe , of course . Hollywood is glamorous and revolves_around the notion of stardom . In Europe , film is a more intellectual art_form , and that was very much the way my father , who was an extremely cultured man , related to it. &quot; At the age of 18 Rossellini enrolled at Finch College in New York , where she found work translating and teaching Italian . That led to a job as a production assistant for Italian television , where she worked her way up_to a job as correspondent for an entertainment program for RAI , the Italian state television . From there she went_on to become the straight_man for Italian comedian Roberto Begnini on a comedy show called &quot; L ' altra Domenica. &quot; Returning to television journalism after the taste of fame she ' d experienced with Begnini left Rossellini despondent and bored , and her fathers ' death in 1977 was a hugely traumatic event for her . &quot; I ' ve always felt that the dividing line in the history of my life is the day my father died , &quot; says Rossellini , who later lost her mother to breast_cancer in 1982 . &quot; That was the day I had to become an adult and had to accept that if I was upset or frightened , I just had to live with it. &quot; Life was to take a dramatic upward turn for Rossellini two years later ; in 1979 she married director Martin Scorsese , and the following year Bruce Weber photographed her for British Vogue and her modeling career took_off . Rossellini had already done a bit of acting at that point -- in 1977 she appeared in &quot; The Meadow , &quot; a movie directed by Italian filmmakers the Taviani brothers -- but acting was the last thing on her mind in the early ' 80s . &quot; Working with the Tavianis didn ' t make me feel_like an actress because they use people who aren ' t professional actors in their films . This is done quite a lot in Europe , where people are often cast for what they emanate as people -- for their ' aura , ' or whatever you want to call it . I was hired for that -- I wasn ' t hired to act . &quot; Moreover , I didn ' t want to work as an actress during the years I was married to Marty , &quot; she adds . &quot; People offered me parts at the time , but no husband would encourage his wife to be an actress because that means you ' re gone all_the time . People have said that Marty would n ' t let me work as an actress , but I never felt that -- his attitude was an act of love . He told me , ' You don ' t need to do_it -- I ' ll take_care of you. ' &quot; By the time Rossellini and Scorsese divorced in 1983 , she ' d already been signed as the spokesperson for Lancome , so she was_well equipped to take_care of herself . The year of her divorce she married model Jonathan Wiedemann , with whom she had a daughter the following year . That marriage too was to end in divorce after barely a year . &quot; I don ' t know why it ' s so hard to keep a relationship together , &quot; says Rossellini . &quot; It ' s sad , but passion does fade , temptation comes_in and at a certain point you decide to follow the new thing . And let ' s face it , men are more subject_to this than women are , and are by nature more polygamous than women . If it was up_to me , I would never divorce -- I was always left. &quot; Following her second divorce , Rossellini decided to try her hand at acting again , and was cast opposite Mikhail Baryshnikov in the 1985 film &quot; White Nights. &quot; The following year she landed the part of battered femme_fatale Dorothy Vallens in David Lynch ' s dark masterpiece , &quot; Blue Velvet , &quot; and turned_in her most critically acclaimed performance to date . &quot; I had an intuitive understanding of this woman -- the minute I read the script I knew who she was and wanted to play her , &quot; she recalls . &quot; When the film was first released , however , I felt tremendous guilt , &quot; she continues . &quot; Today ' Blue Velvet ' is considered a classic , but when it first came_out , it was quite controversial . It was released in Italy by a bad distributor who promoted it as semi-porn , and the publicity generated by the film centered_on the idea that Ingrid Bergman ' s daughter couldn ' t make_it as a legitimate actress so she became a porno star . The Venice Film Festival refused to screen it on the grounds of defending my parents reputation , and I felt_like a total failure . If the film was praised , David Lynch and Dennis Hopper were praised , but if people didn ' t like it , I was attacked . They said it was a misogynist film that trashed my Lancome image. &quot; Though the release of &quot; Blue Velvet &quot; was a rough ride for Rossellini , her being cast in the film led to a four-year relationship with Lynch , and parts in several more films . In 1987 she had small roles in Mary Lambert ' s &quot; Siesta , &quot; and Norman Mailer ' s &quot; Tough_Guys Don ' t Dance , &quot; in 1988 she starred opposite David Lynch in Tina Rathborne ' s &quot; Zelly and Me , &quot; in 1989 she did &quot; Cousins , &quot; and in 1990 had a small part in Lynch ' s &quot; Wild at Heart. &quot; In 1992 she tried her hand at comedy in &quot; Death Becomes Her , &quot; and last year she turned_in a well-received performance in the Peter Weir film , &quot; Fearless. &quot; Though her ambivalence about film is less marked than it once was , Rossellini takes_issue with many aspects of her work . &quot; There ' s a problem with film and I ' ll tell you what it is , &quot; she declares . &quot; I recently had dinner with the Greek writer Oriana Fallaci , a nasty lady who ' s one of my best_friends . Nobody sees her but me , and we have long dinners and talk_about life . She told me a writer recently completed a biography about her that revolved_around a love_affair she ' d had , and that annoyed her . Love wasn ' t the engine of her life , she told me , nor was war or justice -- a sense of adventure is what drove her . When she said that , I realized it was true for me too . &quot; This is the attitude of a mature woman and it ' s not something you often see in film , which focuses_on romantic love as the most important thing in a woman ' s life , &quot; she continues . &quot; Menopause is a great blessing because it releases women from the question : should I get_married and have a baby ? At that point you start asking , what else is there ? I don ' t yearn to be married , and though I can ' t say being single is my favorite state , I ' m not lonely and would rather be single than be in many of the relationships I see. &quot; Rossellini currently lives in New York , where she is raising her 10-year-old daughter Elettra , and her 9-month-old son Roberto , a mixed race child she adopted last fall . When one comments that adopting Roberto was a wonderful thing for her to do , she says , &quot; I guess so . Everyone reacts like that , which surprises me . It ' s a lot of work in the beginning , but then it ' s really fun. &quot; Rossellini will have a bit more time for her children next year , when her contract with Lancome expires . &quot; I ' m sorry to see the relationship end , because I ' ve grown attached_to the company and we work well together , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s more their choice than mine to end our work together -- I ' ve represented Lancome for 14 years , and I guess I did my job so well that they now feel the need to separate their identity from me . &quot; Working for Lancome has been great fun for me , although it involves discipline , &quot; she points_out . &quot; A week before a shoot you feel a certain pressure -- obviously I can ' t gain ten pounds , get a tan , or get drunk the night before the shoot . But these pictures are designed to be about an emotion rather than a blueprint for physical beauty . The Lancome woman is me when I feel fulfilled , calm and relaxed. &quot; Though Rossellini regrets the termination of her relationship with Lancome , she accepts it -- as she seems to accept most things -- with good-natured resignation . &quot; I ' m fatalistic and believe you can ' t get what you want in life -- I know there are many things I want that I ' ll never be able to have , &quot; she concludes . &quot; You just have to resign yourself to that fact , and once you stop focusing_on some imagined goal you begin to see what ' s around you . And at that point , life begins to seem very rich. &quot;</TEXT>
