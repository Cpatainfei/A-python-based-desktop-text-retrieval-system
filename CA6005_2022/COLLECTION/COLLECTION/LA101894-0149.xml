   <HEADLINE> FOR JORDANIANS , TREATY MEANS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE ; REACTION : CITIZENS IN THE CAPITAL SAY THEY WANT PEACE , PROSPERITY . THEIR KING IS COUNTING_ON THOSE HOPES TO BOLSTER HIS DECISION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the working-class area of downtown Amman and the chic restaurants of the upscale Shmeisaneh district , Jordanians on Monday welcomed the draft peace_treaty with Israel . &quot; Who hates peace ? &quot; asked Majaad Ghanma as he bought pastries at Shmeisaneh ' s Jabri patisserie . &quot; The main thing is for Jordanians to feel that we are not expecting war anymore . &quot; You have to have peace_of_mind to plan for the future , and for 50 years , all we had was uncertainty and war , &quot; said Ghanma , an administrator at Yarmouk University . &quot; As long as our rights have been preserved , this is a good thing. &quot; On the other side of town , in a crowded , working-class coffee_shop filled with men smoking water_pipes and playing backgammon , Salim abu Dahab echoed Ghanma ' s sentiments . &quot; I believe that most of the people welcome this treaty , &quot; said Abu Dahab , a businessman whose family fled Jaffa , since incorporated with Tel Aviv , in 1948 , when the Jewish state was born . Now 60 , Abu Dahab says he no longer dreams of returning to Jaffa . &quot; It is impossible , &quot; he said . &quot; Only low-class people and fundamentalists are thinking_of going_back to Palestine . I am 60 . What do I know about Jaffa ? It exists only in my imagination. &quot; Instead of dreaming of return , Abu Dahab said , he thinks_of doing business with Israel . &quot; Until now , we hear about peace and we read about peace , but we don ' t feel peace , &quot; he said . &quot; We want to feel it , and the way to do that is through business . If there is business transactions , then people will welcome this peace. &quot; It is the hopes of people such_as Abu Dahab and Ghanma -- the desire to live a normal life and enjoy economic security and prosperity -- that King Hussein is counting_on to counterbalance the shock of making_peace with the Jewish state . Since Arab-Israeli peace talks opened in Madrid three years ago , Hussein has gradually prepared the population for the signing of a full peace_treaty with Israel . There has been more reporting here on peace negotiations , and on news occurring inside Israel , than in any other Arab country . Meetings between Hussein and Rabin have become almost routine , and Hussein is the only Arab leader who has agreed to conduct bilateral negotiations in Israel and to welcome Israeli negotiators in Jordan . Even so , Monday ' s agreement came as a surprise to most people here -- even newspaper_editors were reduced to turning their channels to Israel Television ' s live broadcast of the Hussein-Rabin news_conference to learn that a draft treaty had indeed been agreed on . There is likely to be some opposition expressed by Islamic fundamentalists and left-wing peace opponents , but neither group is particularly strong in Jordan . On Amman ' s crowded sidewalks Monday night , many people still had not heard the news , several hours after the draft treaty was announced . At the Babiche coffee_shop in Shmeisaneh , Palestinian students were divided in their reactions when a reporter told them that a treaty is scheduled to be signed_on the Israeli-Jordanian border next week . &quot; It ' s a good step , &quot; said Maha Abdul Hadi , an 18-year-old student at Amman University . Born in the West_Bank , Abdul Hadi grew_up in Saudi_Arabia after her family decided to leave . But she holds a Jordanian passport and said she feels both Jordanian and Palestinian now . &quot; It ' s time to do something , &quot; Abdul Hadi said . &quot; Now , everybody is talking_about peace . Maybe , with this treaty , it will be easy for us to travel from here to Palestine . That would be a good thing. &quot; Bayan Dawood , sitting across from Abdul Hadi , shook her head in_disagreement . &quot; I ' m not convinced that we should make_peace with Israel at all , &quot; said the 18-year-old Dawood , whose father was born in Nablus . &quot; Many people had their children and their brothers die fighting the Jews , and then we make_peace , after all that ? When I think_about the people that died , I feel selfish for making peace. &quot; Dawood declared that she will never visit Israel &quot; until it is Palestine , and until it is all ours again. &quot; Across the street , in the Al Sultan coffee_shop , a group of young Jordanian businessmen said the treaty might not please Palestinians -- who make_up more_than 50 % of the population here -- but will certainly be good for Jordan . &quot; So far , so good , &quot; said Munief Tall , 26 , a junior executive with the Jordanian Petroleum Co . Tall said that Israeli businessmen had already started faxing his company , putting_out feelers for business possibilities . &quot; Why not ? &quot; he asked . &quot; Nobody knows the future , but I think this will be good for business. &quot; &quot; It is the only choice , &quot; said Ali Dbbas , 24 , a salesman with an agricultural products manufacturing firm . &quot; There is no other choice for Jordan . There should be no more fights. &quot;</TEXT>
