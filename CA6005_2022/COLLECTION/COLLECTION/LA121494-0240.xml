   <HEADLINE> POPULATION ; U.S. STUDIES EMPLOYING FEWER CENSUS_TAKERS , MORE ESTIMATES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since 1787 , when the Constitution called_for a count of everybody every 10 years , census_takers have hit the streets in search of America itself -- specifically , those citizens who didn ' t return census forms . But if the government ' s Panel on Census Requirements gets its way , many of these temporary census_takers will have to look elsewhere for work during the next head_count , slated for 2000 . The panel says the Census_Bureau can get a more accurate reading by using statistical estimates than by sending census takers out_in search of the uncounted . &quot; You can deceive yourself into thinking you ' ve done a better job when you really haven ' t , &quot; said James Trussell , professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton_University and a member of the commission . &quot; We ' ve got_to change the way we look_at conducting a census. &quot; In the current process , surveys are mailed_out , then census_takers on the streets try to count those who did not respond . The problem is that despite repeat visits , many people aren ' t recorded . Counting people in urban_areas is not as easy as knocking_on doors in suburban single-family neighborhoods . Cities are packed with people living_on the margin -- the homeless , addicts and squatters . As the panel would have it , the new census would first mail_out the survey to all Americans and make a &quot; good-faith attempt &quot; to locate those people using on-foot census_takers . After that , the Census_Bureau would choose a handful of target zones around the country and saturate them with census_takers . The idea would be to get a nearly perfect count in those areas , and then use those findings to construct a statistical model for the nation . Stephen E . Fienberg , professor of statistics and social_science at Carnegie Mellon University , said the panel ' s method fuses old mathematical techniques with the latest statistical advances to account_for those regularly missed by the head_count . The report also calls_for the Census_Bureau to create more reader-friendly surveys and to expand efforts to publicize the mandatory nature of the census . Additionally , the report acknowledged that the issue of identifying one ' s race on the census may need to be more closely examined , now that more people of mixed races are born . Martha Farnsworth Riche , the director of the Census_Bureau , said that the statistical method would cut costs and improve accuracy . A test census is planned for 1995 to experiment with methods prescribed by the panel , she said . Accuracy isn ' t the only advantage , commission members say . The report says that if statistical estimation had been used in the 1990 census , the government could have saved_up to $ 400 million on the total bill of $ 2.6 billion . The savings would be even higher in 2000 . Statistical estimation would answer a longstanding call_for more accurate data in cities heavily populated by minorities . In 1990 , the census came under_fire for undercounting blacks , Latinos and other minorities . The census counted 248.7 million Americans , but statistical estimates calculate that 3 million people were missed . Changing_course to use estimates would have political implications : The census determines the boundary_lines of congressional , state and local districts . It also determines the number of congressional_districts in each state . The new procedure would likely turn_up many_more minorities in cities , which have been known to usually vote Democratic . Wade Henderson , director of the Washington chapter of the National Assn . for the Advancement of Colored People , said the undercount is a serious issue for the 2000 census . &quot; For the NAACP , the greatest concern is the accuracy of the census , &quot; Henderson said . &quot; The undercount of African Americans in 1990 was deplorable . All steps must be taken_to keep it from happening again. &quot; Charles L . Schultze , chairman of the panel , will appear today with other panelists before a House subcommittee to discuss the proposal . Any changes in the census ' method of operation must be approved by the Office of Management and Budget , the Census_Bureau and two congressional panels .</TEXT>
