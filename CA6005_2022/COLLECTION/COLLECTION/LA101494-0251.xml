   <HEADLINE> DETAINEES IN HAITI A FOCUS OF CONCERN ; OCCUPATION : THE U.S. REFUSES TO RELEASE THE NAMES OR CRIMES OF THOSE HELD . HUMAN_RIGHTS GROUPS QUESTION THE LEGALITY OF THEIR CONFINEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scores of Haitians have been arrested by American troops since the occupation of Haiti last month , and questions are being raised about the legal grounds on which the detainees continue to be held . With no functioning government in place yet , no charges have been filed against the people arrested . The U.S._government refuses to release the detainees ' names or other details about who they are and of what they stand accused . On Thursday , 64 people were being held_in a complex of warehouses on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince , said U.S. Army Col . Barry Willey , spokesman for the military_mission here . The number has fluctuated considerably , however , as some people are released and additional suspects are detained . The American military has not provided a total number of arrests and releases . Some human_rights groups have expressed concerns about whether the rights of the detainees are being respected and whether the arrests would stand_up in a court of law . &quot; We are skating on thin ice legally , &quot; acknowledged a senior U.S. official . The official said the United Nations ' resolution that authorized the use of all means necessary to restore democratic rule to Haiti is considered justification for the detentions . Critics say the questionable practices do little to further the cause of establishing a rule_of_law in Haiti and will end_up alienating the falsely accused . At least one U.S. citizen is among the people in custody , officials said . Some of the people arrested have been clearly identified as backers of the outgoing military regime . But in some instances , arrests have been made based almost exclusively on denunciations by neighbors or townspeople and with little corroborating evidence , according to sources familiar_with the cases . In the rural port of Fort Liberte , for example , the wealthiest_man in town , Nyll Calixte , was arrested along with his French-born wife by U.S. Special Forces within hours of their occupation on Oct . 5 . Calixte , a former Haitian ambassador and head of a law_school , was fingered by townspeople as the principal local representative of the military regime ' s armed civilian force . With the townspeople cheering , he was handcuffed , loaded in the back of a U.S. Army truck and held for hours in a dirt-floor prison until being transported to Port-au-Prince for interrogation . One day later , Calixte was released with an apology . The U.S. military came_up with a form_letter for this and similar occasions ; it says the bearer of the letter was arrested by mistake and &quot; is innocent. &quot; Willey said arrests are based on &quot; multiple intelligence &quot; and that the American military is respecting Haitian , U.S. and international_law . He said each person arrested is questioned in the presence of U.S. military lawyers and that the chief lawyer , or judge_advocate , determines whether the person should be released or continue in custody . &quot; Military lawyers are present , &quot; he said . &quot; All sides are heard . They ( the military lawyers ) are doing their thing in there to see that everyone gets a fair shake. &quot; Families and private lawyers have been given access to the detainees only in recent days , according to human_rights officials . Some of the families are still not certain of the reasons their relative is in custody . After considerable delay , the International Committee of the Red_Cross was given access this week to inspect the detention facilities , a spokeswoman for the agency said . Willey said all detainees will be turned_over to the government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , which will resume office with the exiled president ' s return to Haiti on Saturday . Although U.S. officials refuse to identify the detainees , another source gave the name of one man , Anthony Saieh , described as a prosperous farmer from a well-established entrepreneurial family . His 75-year-old mother , Jeanne Marie , said her son was arrested Saturday after being reported for possessing guns . She said he has licenses for the guns he owns . &quot; I cannot say if this is injustice or not , &quot; she said . &quot; We do not know what happened . We are not in politics . We do not interfere in the affairs of anybody . A family like ours cannot be involved in anything like this . So this is the way things are going_in Haiti. &quot;</TEXT>
