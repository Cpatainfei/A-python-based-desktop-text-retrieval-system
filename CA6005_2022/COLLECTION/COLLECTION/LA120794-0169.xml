   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY : Q &amp; A ; RAMIFICATIONS OF A CHAPTER 9 BANKRUPTCY FILING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County ' s bankruptcy filing raises questions about what effect it will have_on basic government services such_as police and fire protection , on county employees ' paychecks and on whether property_owners should pay their property_taxes due Monday . Chicago lawyer James E . Spiotto , a partner in the firm of Chapman &amp; Cutler , has handled several municipal bankruptcy filings and has testified before Congress regarding this type of bankruptcy . In an interview Tuesday , he explained the ramifications of the move : Question : What is Chapter 9 ? Answer : Chapter 9 lets a municipal_government adjust and rearrange its debt , not eliminate it . It recognizes its inability with its current revenues to repay its debts over a reasonable period_of_time . * Q : How will it affect the average Orange County resident or government employee ? A : For the average employee or creditor , any past-due wages or money owed would not be paid until after the filing of the bankruptcy reorganization plan , unless the court specifically orders otherwise . In addition , the only bond debt paid during the bankruptcy would be special revenue_bonds , which are specifically defined in the bankruptcy code as special taxes dedicated to payment of revenue_bonds . It would not include any bonds payable from general sales taxes , property_taxes or income_taxes . * Q : Do people who depend_on their bonds for income have any recourse ? A : Any municipal debt has some market . The price of those bonds may significantly drop to_the_point they would be considered unattractive to sell . It ' s always important , not only for Orange County but for all municipalities , that people carefully assess the situation and find a quick and effective situation that maximizes value to all and provides the least amount of pain to the county , its citizens and its creditors . ( Most California bond mutual_funds are diversified , with potentially troubled Orange County bonds a small percentage of assets . Also , many of the bonds are insured. ) * Q : Will companies that do business with the county be paid ? A : Those who supply services to the county , for any obligation owed to them prior to the date of filing , that claim would be part of the bankruptcy . From the date of the petition and thereafter , those companies would be paid on a regular basis . * Q : Will police , fire or other emergency services be affected ? A : The county should be able to provide the same services . * Q : Should I pay my property_taxes ? A : Even though a county files for bankruptcy protection , it still has the right to receive payment of taxes . * Q : How many cities , counties or districts have filed for Chapter 9 ? A : From 1937 to 1993 , there have been 475 . By and large , these have been small special tax districts or small municipalities . For example , between 1937 and 1972 , there were 362 municipalities involving $ 217 million worth of debt . They paid_back over $ 140 million of that debt . * Q : What was the largest ? A : The largest since the Great Depression was the city of Bridgeport , Conn. , in 1991 , which was dismissed by the Bankruptcy Court because it was found not to be insolvent . * Q : So Orange County becomes the largest ? A : Bridgeport had over $ 200 million in bond debt and 150 # 000 population . Orange County is obviously larger . * Q : Can the court deny Orange County ' s bankruptcy petition ? A : There may be motions to dismiss filed for a number of reasons . They may question whether the municipality is insolvent . They may question , like in the Bridgeport case , whether the county has specific authority under state law . * Q : Will county employees be paid on_time ? A : Going_forward from the time the county filed , they will be paid . But any wages owed prior to the date of filing would remain unpaid until the Plan of Adjustment ( as the bankruptcy reorganization plan is known ) . * Q : How long does_it usually take_for filing of the Plan of Adjustment ? A : It is subject_to negotiation between the government and its creditors . It is usually measured by months , instead of days or weeks . * Q : Do the largest creditors receive priority ? A : The largest priority claims will be paid during the course of the bankruptcy . The government reserves control over its revenue , property and political affairs and operations . The largest creditors will be paid based on priority , same as the people in their class . * Q : What kind of ill effects are caused by a bankruptcy filing ? A : The biggest problem is the stigma of bankruptcy in the bond market , either because a municipality has to pay higher interest_rates or because it cannot obtain any credit in the market . * Q : How long does that stigma last ? A : It depends_on how people perceive the problem . If people are afraid that this could be a serious problem , they may ask_for higher interest_rates or not participate in a future debt offering , making_it so it can ' t proceed . that ' s why in many troubled municipal situations , you have a refinancing authority or an oversight committee or state agency which may guarantee or provide an additional source of revenue . * Q : How do those oversight boards work ? A : Usually by state legislation to provide additional credit reporting and guidance to a municipality in a ( debt ) work-out situation . * Q : Why have so few local_governments ever filed for bankruptcy ? A : The market still looks_to the credit-worthiness and believability of that issuer . And municipalities have been always worried about the stigma of bankruptcy , the cost of bankruptcy in the future , high interest-rate charges or the lack of ability to borrow .</TEXT>
