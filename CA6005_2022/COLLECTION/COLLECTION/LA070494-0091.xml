   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA 1994 ; EXCITING GAME can ' t ERASE SADNESS OVER FALLEN STARS ; CROWD : FANS AT THE ROSE BOWL MATCHUP OF ROMANIA AND ARGENTINA REACT TO THE SLAYING OF A COLOMBIAN PLAYER AND THE BANNING OF AN ARGENTINE STAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite the frenzied play in what some called the most exciting game yet of World Cup ' 94 , much of the emotional energy was focused_on two of soccer ' s fallen heroes Sunday , as Romania scored a 3-2 victory over Argentina at the Rose Bowl . Beneath the cheers , there was shock and sadness : at the murder of Colombian defenseman Andres Escobar , shot and killed Saturday in his native city of Medellin , apparently in revenge for the accidental goal he scored that contributed to his team ' s loss to the United States at the Rose Bowl , and for veteran Argentine star Diego Maradona , banned from the World Cup competition last week after failing a drug test . &quot; It ' s the saddest thing I ' ve heard about Colombia since I came here five years ago , &quot; said Nicholas Paez , 30 , a Colombian immigrant who now lives here , referring to Escobar ' s violent_death . &quot; When I heard the news , I was about to cry. &quot; Although their own team was_on the field , Argentine fans among the crowd of 90 # 000 at the Rose Bowl found their attention diverted elsewhere -- with occasional sightings of Maradona also watching the game from the stands causing as much frenzy as the game . At halftime , after spotting him in a section of the stands beneath the press_box , thousands of fans leaped to their feet and trained their binoculars on the soccer idol . Throughout the contest , fans hefted blue and white Argentina banners with the words &quot; Viva Maradona ! &quot; Another massive banner went so far as_to thank Maradona ' s mother for giving_birth to him . The stocky , black-haired star , once regarded_as the world ' s best soccer player and the undisputed leader of the_Argentine team , watched his teammates from a seat high in the stands , wearing a bright , jungle-print shirt and surrounded by a phalanx of security_guards . &quot; You have your Magic Johnson ; we have our Magic Maradona , &quot; said Eduardo Fevres , 24 , of Buenos Aires , who was adorned in a blue and white wig and soccer outfit . Down his back streamed a cape made_out of Argentina ' s flag with the words &quot; Magic Diego &quot; stenciled on it . For Colombians , already disappointed at their team ' s elimination from the World Cup , Escobar ' s assassination was a particularly bitter pill . &quot; This really doesn ' t give Colombia a very good name , &quot; said Arturo Villegas , a Colombian native who lives here . &quot; A lot of people say that they are going_to kill someone , but it never happened until now. &quot; On Sunday , in honor of Escobar , many Colombians taped black slashes over their country ' s emblem on their caps and T-shirts . Some hoisted flags bearing Escobar ' s name crossed_out with black tape . &quot; This has ruined the World Cup for us , &quot; said Marco Sierra , 35 , of Pasadena . &quot; It ' s a tragedy that this happened . Nobody ' s life is worth a game. &quot; Still , in the absence of Marodona and Escobar , the overwhelmingly pro-Argentine crowd managed to stay upbeat , banging drums , shaking tambourines , rattling maracas , honking bullhorns and waving banners high in the air . Orlando Martinoli , 36 , of Northridge came_with a group of fellow Argentine immigrants from the San Fernando Valley , all dressed head to toe in blue and white . He brought as a good-luck token the soccer jersey that he wore to the ' 86 World Cup_finals in Mexico , which Argentina won . The small , badly faded jersey , autographed by the ' 86 champions , was stained and foul-smelling . &quot; I haven ' t washed it since 1986 , &quot; Martinoli said , waving it over his head . &quot; I brought it for good luck. &quot; His brother , Daniel Martinoli , 32 , of Northridge , said that everyone was disappointed at Maradona ' s suspension . &quot; Drugs or no drugs , he ' s the best . He can play with one leg , &quot; he said . &quot; Everybody loses today , because they ' re not getting_to see the best player in the world. &quot; Toward the end of the game Maradona was spotted leaving the stands . The crowd chanted &quot; Diego ! Diego ! &quot; as he walked past , looking straight ahead . &quot; I ' m excited to see him , &quot; said Emilo Vivot , 10 , of Monrovia , as his grandmother hugged him excitedly and pointed_out the soccer star .
