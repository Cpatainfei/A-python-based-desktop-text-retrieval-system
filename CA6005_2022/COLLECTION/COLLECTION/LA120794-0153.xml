   <HEADLINE> FRANCE CONVICTS 2 IRANIANS IN MURDER OF EXILED LEADER ; COURTS : PROSECUTOR SAYS TEHRAN ' AT THE HEART ' OF GROUP THAT STABBED FORMER PRIME_MINISTER OF IRAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After hearing testimony linking the state of Iran to a worldwide terror network , a French court Tuesday convicted two Iranians of murder in the 1991 assassination of Shahpour Bakhtiar , one of the Tehran regime ' s political opponents . Ali Vakili Rad , 35 , one of three men directly involved in the stabbing death of Bakhtiar and an aide in his Paris apartment , was sentenced to life in prison . Prosecutors said he was a secret_agent of VEVAK , the intelligence and security agency that monitors the Iranian government ' s opponents worldwide . Two other alleged assassins , along with other accomplices , are still at_large . French investigators say some of the suspects may be in the United States . A second defendant , Massoud Hendi , 47 , a relative of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and former Paris bureau chief of Iran ' s broadcasting network , was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison for helping the killers obtain false documents to enter France . A third man , a diplomat in Tehran ' s embassy in Switzerland and nephew of Iran ' s current president , was acquitted of helping the killers escape through Geneva . The five-week trial , presided over by a special terrorism court of seven magistrates , had created a political dilemma for the_French government , which has buckled to pressure from the Iranian government in previous terrorism cases . While it wanted to show that terrorist acts would be punished , the_French did not want a political trial that would increase tensions between their nation and Iran and touch_off renewed terrorist attacks . Last year , the_French government , ignoring an extradition request from the_Swiss government , expelled to Tehran two Iranians wanted for terrorist acts in Switzerland . And in 1990 , the_French government pardoned an Iranian sentenced to life in prison for attempting to kill Bakhtiar . The latest trial focused_on the crime itself . Much of French investigators ' evidence of a vast terrorist network , which stretched from Istanbul to Los Angeles , was not presented in court . Since the Islamic Republic was founded in 1979 , 63 exiles have been killed or wounded . But the_French prosecutor , Jacques Mouton , contended in court that the Islamic Republic of Iran was &quot; at the heart &quot; of the criminal organization that ordered the killing of Bakhtiar and his aide . And Mouton called the plot &quot; a perfect murder in perfect cold blood. &quot; Ali Chakeri , who replaced Bakhtiar as head of the Iranian exile group , said the trial and verdict amounted to a conviction of Iran for state-sponsored terrorism . But he and other Bakhtiar associates said they were disappointed that French concerns had kept the case from becoming a political trial of Iran . No official from the Iranian government was called to testify , and Iran denied involvement in the assassination , contending that Bakhtiar was killed by his own associates . Bakhtiar , 76 , a longtime champion of democratic rule_in Iran , was imprisoned by the shah of Iran . When the shah ' s hold_on power began to slip , he made Bakhtiar prime_minister , but that government lasted barely a month before the Islamic revolution . In exile , Bakhtiar was declared a target of Islamic punishment . He was slain Aug . 6 , 1991 .</TEXT>
