   <TEXT> &quot; Good evening , everyone . Tonight ' s top story is quite simply about fear. &quot; It could have been the lead-in to any local newscast on any night in America , one more doom-laden account of urban butchery and its attendant body_bags , blood-caked sidewalks and wailing survivors . But in late September , WCCO-TV , a CBS affiliate in Minneapolis , shook_up the familiar formula of crime and violence that dominates local television_news . After a motorist had been dragged from his car in north Minneapolis and fatally shot by bicycle-mounted attackers , WCCO explained to its viewers why they should not feel afraid . Most of the region ' s residents , anchor Don Shelby intoned , were rarely exposed to the &quot; clear but limited pattern &quot; of random murder . For a medium that has spent two decades honing and expanding its relentless coverage of crime , WCCO ' s retreat was perhaps little more_than a small step back . Yet in a year when Americans have singled_out criminal violence as the most critical national concern , any rethinking of television ' s obsession with crime comes as startling news . Since January , when WCCO announced a policy to remove violent images from a dinner-hour broadcast easily viewed by children , at least two_dozen stations around the country -- none in Southern California -- have begun tinkering with their old ways of covering crime . Adherents claim that they are responding to a public weary of hyped crime coverage , while many industry veterans belittle the moves as shallow attempts to attract attention and boost ratings . Editors at WCCO routinely erase tapes of bodies on gurneys , wounded gunshot victims and bloodied crime scenes from the 5 p.m. newscast -- although those images often appear on later broadcasts . WMAR in Baltimore edits_out gory footage from all newscasts and has reduced the time it devotes to routine slayings . In Tyler , Tex. , KETK-TV no longer airs stories about non-fatal shootings and stabbings , once a common feature of its coverage . &quot; People are just tired_of being afraid and tired_of what we ' ve been selling them , &quot; said John Lansing , a news executive who pioneered &quot; family sensitive &quot; news at WCCO and now manages a larger laboratory for his ideas at the Chicago CBS affiliate . Television executives and consultants in most major markets remain suspicious , perceiving WCCO ' s experiments as &quot; a marketing technique , &quot; said veteran consultant Eric Braun . Whether the experiments catch_on elsewhere may well depend_on how stations respond to an unresolved question about TV ' s impact : Does its emphasis on crime reflect or inflame the public ' s sense of insecurity ? Several recent studies have suggested that crime coverage does appear to influence fear . One report released this year by the Chicago Council on Urban Affairs found that the city ' s news stations devoted more_than half their air time to violence . And preliminary evidence from a UC Berkeley psychiatric study of California and Utah children who watched coverage of the Polly Klaas murder reveals lingering effects ranging from loss of sleep to a shared sense of peril . Much of this research has come_in an era dominated by the rise of &quot; tabloid news , &quot; a style of lightning-paced , crime-dominated local coverage eagerly adopted over the past four years by big city stations trying to overtake rivals in the ceaseless ratings wars . Launched at a Fox affiliate in Miami almost four years ago , tabloid-influenced local news still draws viewers there and in Los Angeles , Chicago and New York , thriving on a steady diet of sensational murders , dramatic accident footage and helicopter-camera views of police_car chases . Those who analyze television ' s impact on viewers have repeatedly drawn a bead on local coverage as the most influential and pervasive of media outlets . Both newspapers and television ' s new hybrids -- &quot; Cops &quot; and other police reality shows and tabloid programs like &quot; Hard Copy &quot; -- also have been criticized for their crime reporting . But local TV ' s impact is immediate and near , lacking the stylized distance of the programs that often cover celebrity cases or show police solving crimes . And local news reaches a much wider audience than newspapers , sometimes intensifying fears in rural communities remote from urban violence . Local news outlets fixated on crime coverage rarely &quot; make the attempt to draw isolated incidents into any context , &quot; said Robert Entman , a Northwestern University communications professor who headed the Chicago study . &quot; They heighten the public ' s sense of urgency and danger. &quot; Yet the daily litany of urban horrors -- in Chicago , a numbing parade of murders committed this summer by 10- and 11-year-old children -- convinces others that such perceptions are justified . &quot; The kind of fear we ' ve been seeing can ' t just be whipped_up , &quot; said Roger L . Conner , executive_director of the American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities , a Washington-based public interest_group . &quot; People say it ' s a media creation , but it ' s grounded in our own real experience. &quot; A Los Angeles Times Poll conducted on crime issues in January found that 68 % of Americans watch TV news_reports of violence almost every day . And 82 % of respondents said they believed those images increase viewers ' fears of crime . &quot; Too_much of what we see on the nightly news is useless information , &quot; said Brian Baxter , a Minneapolis bookseller who watches local newscasts every night . &quot; All you get_out of it is anxiety. &quot; It is a common complaint usually shrugged_off by local stations . But last Jan . 10 at WCCO , after hearing that message for months in viewer-complaint sessions , news director Lansing ordered his staff to produce a &quot; family sensitive &quot; newscast aimed at protecting children from graphic footage of death and violence in dinner-hour reports . Editors were told to remove shots of bodies , blood and grieving families from the 5 p.m. newscast . That one hour was selected , Lansing explained later , because it was &quot; the time our research determined that a lot of children have control of the TV set. &quot; Sanitizing a single newscast led critics like University of Miami communications professor Joseph Angotti to question &quot; how you think you can do any good by cleaning_up your act for one newscast and then going wild again an hour later ? &quot; Lansing said he had &quot; no control &quot; over violence broadcast on the CBS national news at 5:30 p.m. -- and that later local newscasts had smaller &quot; family &quot; audiences . WCCO ' s reporters , camera operators and video editors were equally suspicious of the sudden move . Those wielding the cameras were urged to shoot the same graphic footage they always had . But editors were told to abandon well-honed instincts to use the most startling images -- even for only one newscast each day . &quot; At first we felt our hands were tied , &quot; said chief editor Brian Halliday . &quot; This is a visually intensive media and there ' s not much to work with at a murder scene if all you can show are street lights. &quot; Over time , Halliday has adapted . Asked recently for old footage of the motorist ' s murder in north Minneapolis for the &quot; family sensitive &quot; newscast , Halliday used a photograph of the victim . &quot; It ' s pretty boring stuff , &quot; he said . &quot; But then , I ask myself , ' Would I want my 6-year-old getting a close-up of neighborhood kids wading in the poor guy ' s blood ? ' &quot; At WMAR in Baltimore , where crime coverage has been moderated , news director Jack Cahalan had to suppress &quot; gut instincts &quot; when a fatal shootout erupted at a suburban strip mall . Instead of &quot; going live &quot; to the shooting at the start of his late-night newscast as rival stations did , Cahalan placed the report lower in the show , giving it 45 seconds instead of the standard three minutes . &quot; For awhile there , my stomach was churning , wondering whether I did the right thing , &quot; Cahalan recalled . &quot; But then I realized : Did the world come_to an end because these two clowns got_into a fatal argument ? Nope. &quot; As a ratings tool , the &quot; family sensitive &quot; changes have not appeared to make much difference over the past nine months , said Braun , an executive at Frank Magid and Assoc. , a top news ratings consulting firm . At least 24 affiliates have altered their crime coverage this year . Many were clients of the ratings consulting_firm Audience Research and Development Inc. , whose president , Ed Bewley , said : &quot; You don ' t have to be a rocket scientist to see that the public is against the kind of overemphasis on crime. &quot; When WCCO officials asked viewers in more_than 100 informal meetings to elaborate on an unfinished sentence , &quot; I hate TV news because . . . , &quot; they were stunned at the vehemence of the replies . One angry viewer told them &quot; anybody can buy a scanner and run_around shooting crime scenes. &quot; Another said he was afraid to leave his home to go_to Twins baseball_games because of what he saw on the news each night . &quot; They told us we weren ' t giving them perspective , ' You ' re scaring us , we don ' t understand what the real problem is , ' &quot; Lansing said . Viewers have been increasingly barraged with half-hour reports dominated by crime since the 1970s , when ABC affiliates in New York and Philadelphia unveiled the &quot; Action News &quot; format , a forerunner of today ' s tabloid-influenced news_programs . Created by programmers as a strong lead-in to the network ' s evening news , Action News_shows placed &quot; a heavy emphasis on strong , moving visuals , rapid-paced reports -- usually 90 seconds or less -- and lots of crime , &quot; said John McManus , author of &quot; Market Driven Journalism , &quot; a critique of the industry . Successful in attracting audiences , the format became an industry staple . Consultants repeatedly told station executives that &quot; if you wanted to grab an audience ' s attention , nothing worked like a screaming fire_truck or a police_car with blinking lights , &quot; said Jim Snyder , a former vice_president for news at Post-Newsweek stations . &quot; It ' s not that audiences are being hypocritical , &quot; Braun said . &quot; But there ' s a genuine interest in stories about crime . People want to know what ' s going_on around them. &quot; In Los Angeles , the city that pioneered helicopter-cam coverage of police chases , that rationale has kept stations focused_on crime . &quot; Family sensitive &quot; editing and second-guessing of crime stories has yet to gain a foothold , say local news managers . &quot; I ' ve talked to people who work_at some of these ' family sensitive ' stations and they say they spend an awful lot of time talking_about a fuzzy yardstick , &quot; said Jose Rios , news director at KTTV-TV . &quot; They ' re concentrating more on what ' s permissible than on what stories they ' re doing. &quot; John Lippman is an independent producer who was news director of Los Angeles ' KCBS at the height of its tabloid format until he and the station parted company last year . He said he aimed his station ' s broadcasts at urban and lower-income viewers whose lives are most often imperiled by crime . Stations that devote less time to crime coverage , he insisted , give a distorted portrait of the stark reality of violence in Los Angeles and other cities . &quot; We followed up drive-bys and other crimes and interrupted programming for helicopter chases for a reason , &quot; Lippman said . &quot; We removed the middle man , the anchor , the white male expert who told people this is significant -- harrumph , harrumph . By personalizing crime , we got people stirred_up about it and dealing with it as an issue. &quot; Lippman insists he never heard complaints from minority community leaders . But television critics like Phyllis Kannis detect little altruism for minority audiences . &quot; To put it bluntly , local stations are exploiting the horrors of the inner_city to attract their audiences , &quot; said Kannis , a professor at the University of Pennsylvania ' s Annenberg School of Communications . In some cities , tabloid formats have stirred considerable resentment . Earlier this year , Thomas F . Hewitt , president of the Continental Cos. , owners of the Grand Bay Hotel and six other Miami hotels , pulled the cable plug on WSVN ' s tabloid-style news_reports to its 2 # 000 rooms because the crime-dominated coverage &quot; preyed on the fears of our guests. &quot; In Minneapolis , black community leader Randolph Staten , a former state_senator , has challenged stations to reduce excessive crime reports &quot; because it makes our entire community look_like killers. &quot; Three years ago in Chicago , a coalition of urban church groups boycotted CBS affiliate WBBM during its crucial rating &quot; sweeps. &quot; Rev . Michael Pfleger , a Catholic priest who led the boycott , charged that the station ' s preoccupation with crime left residents feeling hopeless , often dissuading them from taking stands against neighborhood violence . Pfleger said he repeatedly tried to build support for anti-crime marches and other initiatives only to hear &quot; people tell me ' What ' s the use ? We can ' t do anything. ' Time after time , I ' d ask them if something happened to them that made them so dispirited . And it was always , ' No , it ' s what I see every night on TV. ' &quot; Since then , Pfleger has seen little change on Chicago ' s stations . Learning that Lansing , the man behind &quot; family sensitive &quot; coverage , had taken_over WBBM ' s news operation , he brightened . &quot; There ' s always room for hope , &quot; he said . Before he left for Chicago , Lansing ' s co-workers decided to give him a memento . At a going-away party , they handed Lansing a videotape of &quot; family insensitive &quot; footage , studded with unedited shots of some of Minneapolis ' goriest car crashes , murder scenes and police chases . &quot; Just so he remembers , &quot; one co-worker said , &quot; where he came from. &quot;</TEXT>
