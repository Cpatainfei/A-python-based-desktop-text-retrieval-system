   <HEADLINE> RUNAWAY , 16 , CALLS TO SAY HE DOES NOT WANT CANCER_DRUGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nine days after running_away from home because of painful cancer treatments , 16-year-old Billy Best called his parents from Texas to say he ' s OK . He also said he ' s not ready to come_home , that he needs more time to himself . &quot; He said he still feels_like ( the medication ) is killing him and he doesn ' t want to do_it , &quot; Billy ' s father , William , said Saturday . The call from Billy late Friday , and two calls early Saturday from people he met on his trip , helped unravel the mystery of his whereabouts since he ran_away Oct . 26 . Two weeks earlier , the high_school junior was told that the chemical and radiation treatments for his cancer , Hodgkin ' s disease , would have to continue . &quot; The reason I left is because I could not stand going_to the hospital every week , &quot; Billy wrote in a note he left for his parents . &quot; I feel_like the medicine is killing me instead of helping me. &quot; Hodgkin ' s disease is a cancer of the body ' s lymphatic_system , which is used to fight infection . While the disease is fatal if untreated , doctors say that up_to 80 % of its victims are deemed cancer-free if they undergo full chemical and radiation treatments . Dr. Cliff Takemoto , who had been treating Billy , said that without continued treatments , Billy ' s cancer would worsen . But he also said the treatment can be modified .</TEXT>
