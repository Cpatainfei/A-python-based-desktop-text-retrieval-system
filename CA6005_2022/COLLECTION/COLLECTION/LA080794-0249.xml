   <HEADLINE> SIMPSON CASE HEIGHTENS STAKES IN ' DNA WAR ' ; COURTS : DEFENSE WILL ARGUE MERITS OF TESTING RESULTS EITHER WAY . IT IS ONE OF THE MOST VITRIOLIC DEBATES IN LAW , MEDICINE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As scientists perform the tests that could alter the course of the O.J. Simpson murder case , the former football star ' s attorneys are constructing two parallel defense strategies -- one for whatever results the DNA analysis produces . If the tests show that Simpson ' s blood does not match that of samples found at the scene of the crime , two of the nation ' s foremost criminalists , Dr. Henry Lee and Dr. Michael Baden , will be prepared to argue that someone other_than Simpson is almost certainly the killer . But if the tests indicate that Simpson ' s DNA matches that of samples recovered by detectives , his lawyers are ready for that too . They have hired Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld , two of the nation ' s premier legal_experts on the shortcomings of DNA evidence and the limits of its usefulness in identifying criminal suspects . &quot; We have a good team assembled that can deal with any set of results , &quot; said Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , one of the leading members of Simpson ' s defense_team . &quot; We can cover it both ways. &quot; No matter which DNA faction of Simpson ' s team gets the call , the experts and lawyers who square_off to argue DNA will be wading into one of the most vitriolic debates in the legal and medical_communities today . It is a highly technical area where biology and statistics converge , and it has pitted the operators of forensic labs against academic scientists in a furious disagreement over how DNA tests are performed and whether they are reliable enough to send defendants to prison in certain cases . The raging debate over DNA is complicated further by shifting legal standards for considering scientific evidence in court . In 1993 , the U.S. Supreme Court adopted new rules for judges to employ in admitting scientific evidence , but those rules only apply in the federal_courts . Legal experts are eagerly awaiting word on the subject from the California Supreme Court , whose rulings bind state judges such_as the one presiding over the Simpson case . All of that could give Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito a huge problem to sort_out . Since he was assigned to the case last month , Ito has broached the DNA issue once and will return to it Tuesday when he is expected to hear arguments about splitting blood samples . As the case goes_forward , he could have bigger dilemmas before him . Experts say it could take weeks for Ito to hear conflicting testimony about the DNA , then to decide whether the tests are admissible and , finally , to determine how much statistical significance jurors should attach_to any possible DNA &quot; match. &quot; All those decisions could have important consequences for the case , and Ito will have few hard-and-fast rules to guide him . &quot; Nothing is nailed_down here , &quot; said John Wiley , a UCLA law professor and former federal prosecutor . &quot; Judge Ito really has got a nightmare on his hands. &quot; The forum in the explosive Simpson case will be what is known as a &quot; Frye hearing , &quot; a dry , technical and possibly prolonged session that will focus_on contested evidence in the case and which Ito has indicated he intends to conduct after a jury is impaneled . Neither side in the DNA war disputes the central scientific premise behind the process -- that different people have different DNA structures , and that DNA testing can therefore identify or exclude people as the sources of blood , hair or tissue samples . Even a skeptic such_as Scheck has said that DNA testing is &quot; an extraordinarily powerful tool that is going_to be done reliably. &quot; But , he added : &quot; Has it yet become reliable ? No. &quot; Egged_on by rival lawyers , scientists have staged an increasingly testy disagreement on that subject , accusing colleagues of faking results , stealing others ' work and slanting experiments for money . The debate has grown so heated that one expert titled his article on the subject &quot; Lessons From the DNA War &quot; and lists among his credentials the fact that one of his articles has been reprinted three times and plagiarized once . Some scientists say they have been threatened with income_tax audits or investigations into their immigration status after testifying in DNA cases . Others who have been through the experience describe it as &quot; harrowing &quot; and have vowed never to take_the_stand again . &quot; These cases have forced the adversarial process into the scientific process , &quot; said Deborah Williamson , an assistant federal public_defender from Phoenix who has waged an aggressive challenge to DNA evidence on behalf of a client . &quot; Scientists are not used to being challenged and picked_at . It ' s gotten pretty mean. &quot; Few expect the Simpson case to prove an exception . No eyewitnesses to the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman have come_forward , and Simpson has vigorously maintained his innocence , saying through his attorneys that he was at_home at the time of the killings . So DNA evidence is likely to form an important element of the prosecution ' s effort to show that Simpson was at the scene of the crime . Preliminary DNA tests conducted by the Los Angeles Police_Department lab in June showed that Simpson could have left blood droplets leading away from the murder scene , and that blood found on a glove outside his Brentwood mansion could have come from the two victims . Those tests were not presented during last month ' s preliminary hearing . Prosecutors instead relied_on results of conventional blood testing done on a droplet discovered at the murder scene -- results that a police expert testified pointed to Simpson as a likely source of the drop . Since the hearing , prosecutors have sent their blood samples to a Maryland laboratory , Cellmark Diagnostics , where scientists are performing more rigorous DNA tests known as restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) analysis . That procedure is the most commonly accepted by courts , but it too has come under assault in numerous trials . Leading the attack often is the tag team of Scheck and Neufeld , a highly regarded pair of attorneys who pioneered the defense bar ' s challenges to DNA in the late 1980s . &quot; If I was the defense , there isn ' t anybody else I would call , &quot; said Myrna Raeder , a professor at Southwestern University School_of_Law . &quot; Barry is incredibly well-respected . . . . In the mid-1980s , nobody was challenging DNA at all . Then Barry took_a_look at it and started talking to scientists . He almost single-handedly , with Peter Neufeld , started this debate. &quot; Among the earliest milestone cases in the DNA war was one known as People vs . Castro . On Feb . 5 , 1987 , a 20-year-old pregnant New York woman and her 2-year-old daughter were found stabbed to death in the_Bronx . A janitor named Joseph Castro was charged with the murders , and prosecutors offered as evidence a bloodstain from his watch . That stain , according to DNA experts , matched the blood of the dead mother . They concluded that the chances of it having come from anyone else were more_than 189-million-to-1 . The lab in that case was New York-based Lifecodes , and its findings were backed by a number of prominent scientists . But Scheck and Neufeld fought_back vigorously , suggesting that the lab ' s procedures were sloppy and that analysts had ignored data that might tend to clear the defendant . Some experts who originally testified for Lifecodes eventually reconsidered and joined in the criticism . After an exhaustive Frye hearing , the judge ruled that the evidence of the victim ' s blood on Castro ' s watch could not be admitted . But the Castro case , which might have been an unmitigated victory for critics of DNA testing , ended on an eerie note . Having successfully fought to keep the DNA evidence out of court , Castro then pleaded guilty to the crime . Since that case , Frye hearings have become the increasingly fractious testing grounds over the admissibility of DNA evidence and the reliability of the principal DNA laboratories , Lifecodes and Cellmark . Both laboratories have steadfastly defended their work and noted that results of their tests have been accepted in courts nationwide . Acceptance has not come without a fight , though . In case after case , Scheck and Neufeld have attacked both labs for sloppy work -- Neufeld once accused Lifecodes of producing &quot; garbage &quot; -- and have questioned the statistical significance of DNA &quot; matches. &quot; To arrive_at the odds of two &quot; matching &quot; samples coming from different sources , analysts perform a simple arithmetic exercise . Say there are three characteristics in a given DNA sample and each one occurs in the general population with a frequency of 1 in every 10 people . By multiplying the odds of a person having each characteristic , analysts might conclude that there was a 1-in-1 # 000 chance of a single person having all three characteristics . ( Multiplying . 10 x . 10 x . 10 produces a result of . 001 or 1 in 1 # 000. ) Proponents of DNA testing say presenting the jury with those statistics helps allow jurors to assess the likelihood of samples coming from the same or different people . But critics say there is a hitch : Imagine that the three characteristics being studied reflect the coding for black hair , dark eyes and dark skin . And imagine that sample came from an Indian_reservation in Arizona or New Mexico . The sample could be linked to far more people in that population than the 1-in-1 # 000 ratio would indicate . To avoid that , analysts study segments of DNA that are believed to be highly individual , avoiding sections that code for hair or eye color , for instance . Nevertheless , critics say the statistical significance of a DNA match can vary by region , by the specific characteristics being studied and by the population from which the sample is drawn . All those factors complicate any statistical conclusions about the sample ' s significance , even if a &quot; match &quot; is produced . Assuming Cellmark ' s tests withstand any quality_control challenges from the defense , most legal_experts believe that Ito will allow jurors to hear DNA evidence in the Simpson case . But Peter Arenella , a UCLA law professor , echoed the view of other experts in predicting that Ito probably will force prosecutors to use conservative estimates when it comes_to assessing the probability that any DNA sample can be matched to Simpson or the victims . That could narrow the field of possible suspects but also leave the Simpson defense_team with room to maneuver . At the preliminary hearing , a police expert said conventional blood_tests demonstrated that a blood drop found at the crime scene could only have come from about one in every 200 people -- including Simpson . Gerald F . Uelmen , one of Simpson ' s lawyers , pounced on that statistic to note that tens of thousands of people in the Los Angeles area thus could have left the drop . In the end , moreover , even if the DNA evidence shows everything that prosecutors hope it will , their case would still be incomplete . The onetime football superstar is charged with two counts of first-degree murder , a charge that requires prosecutors to prove premeditation . Doing that will require prosecutors to produce old-fashioned evidence such_as testimony about a defendant ' s statements to police , behavior before and after the crimes and relationship to the victims . Assessing Simpson ' s premeditation forces jurors to venture inside the Hall of Famer ' s head . And there , even DNA cannot lead them . &quot; At the most , DNA can link you to a killing , &quot; said Harland W . Braun , a noted criminal defense_lawyer in Los Angeles . &quot; It doesn ' t do anything beyond that . To get_to premeditation or intent , the prosecution is going_to have to do more , and it ' s going_to have to rely_on other kinds of evidence. &quot; * THE LAB INVOLVED : Cellmark Diagnostics prepares_for the battle ahead .
