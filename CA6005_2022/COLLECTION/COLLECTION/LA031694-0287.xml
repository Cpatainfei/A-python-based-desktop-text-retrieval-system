   <HEADLINE> AMERICANS GET NO GOLD STARS FOR CURRENT EVENTS ANSWERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The test did not seem difficult . Anyone who keeps_up with the news ought to know that Boris N . Yeltsin is president of Russia and Boutros Boutros-Ghali is secretary_general of the United Nations , right ? But Americans failed badly , faring far worse than their neighbors and West European allies in a survey of eight countries released Tuesday by the Times Mirror Center for the People &amp; the Press . As part of its survey of how the world regards newspaper and television_news coverage , the center asked five current events questions in the United States , Canada , Mexico , Britain , France , Spain , Germany and Italy . The Germans did best . But the results offer a bleak picture of American knowledge of current events , as the center reported that an astounding 37 % of Americans polled answered all five questions incorrectly . Here are how some of the groups fared : * 94 % of Germans correctly named Yeltsin as Russia ' s president . The right answer was given by 76 % of Italians , 65 % of Spaniards , 63 % of British , 61 % of the_French , 59 % of the Canadians , 50 % of the Americans and 42 % of the Mexicans . * 58 % of the Germans knew Boutros-Ghali is U.N. secretary_general . The question was answered correctly by 43 % of the Italians , 32 % of the_French , 26 % of the Canadians , 22 % of the_British , 15 % of the Spaniards , 14 % of the Mexicans and 13 % of the Americans . * 79 % of Germans knew that the Palestinians are the people with whom the Israelis recently reached a peace accord . The question was answered correctly by 60 % of the_French , 59 % of the_British , 56 % of the Italians , 51 % of the Canadians , 40 % of the Americans , 29 % of the Spaniards and 21 % of the Mexicans .</TEXT>
