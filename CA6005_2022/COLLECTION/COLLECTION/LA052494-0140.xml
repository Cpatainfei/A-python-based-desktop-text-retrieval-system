   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : OXNARD ; PASTRY MAKERS SWEETEN TRIP OF JAPANESE COOKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After trimming a white layer_cake with borders of matching white frosting , Oxnard College_student Mike Lodi announced to his audience of Japanese visitors that he would now add a scroll-like design . But suddenly the Japanese tour guide who was translating Lodi ' s presentation Tuesday at Oxnard College stopped talking . Grabbing his Japanese-English dictionary , the guide hurriedly opened_to the section listing English words and searched for an unfamiliar term : &quot; scroll. &quot; He found it and then promptly continued his narration . Despite such language_barriers , the Oxnard College_students who gave the pastry-making demonstration said they believe their Japanese audience followed most of what they were doing . &quot; They may_not understand your words , &quot; said Coral Elandt , a student in the college ' s Hotel and Restaurant Management program . &quot; But when you show them something with your hands , they understand. &quot; Indeed , the Japanese students who were in the audience are not new_to baking . They are all cooking-school majors at Kokusai Business_College outside Tokyo , part of a group of 200 Kokusai students who have been visiting the Oxnard area since Friday . Kokusai is a sister school of Oxnard College . But some of the Kokusai students said they are unfamiliar_with American-style culinary_arts . Kouichi Koyama said he had never before seen &quot; a square cake &quot; such_as the rectangular pan cake that Lodi decorated . In Japan , he said , cakes are usually round . And Yuiko Usui , 17 , said she noticed that Americans make French-style pastries with more sugar and less salt than the Japanese . &quot; Jet_lag , &quot; said Yuiko , explaining why some of her classmates had let their heads droop to their chests and others had slouched low in their seats . It was , after all , 2:30 a.m. Tokyo time , even though it was 10:30 a.m. in Oxnard . MAIA DAVIS</TEXT>
