   <HEADLINE> CLINTON EXPECTED TO RENEW CHINA ' S TRADE PRIVILEGES ; COMMERCE : A COMMISSION TO MONITOR THE NATION ' S HUMAN_RIGHTS IS REPORTEDLY PLANNED . LIMITED SANCTIONS ON CHINESE GUNS AND AMMUNITION ARE POSSIBLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton is expected to announce today that he will renew China ' s trade privileges , but he may impose extremely limited sanctions on Chinese-made guns and ammunition , according to sources who were briefed on the White_House decision . The sources said Wednesday that the Clinton_Administration also plans to set_up a new commission to examine human_rights abuses in China . The commission reportedly would be headed by former President Jimmy_Carter , who established diplomatic relations with the Beijing regime in 1979 while he was in the White_House . The commission would be designed as a replacement for the approach that Clinton proposed last year but will now abandon : using trade as leverage to improve human_rights in China . In recent days , human_rights groups have denounced the idea of a human_rights commission for China as a meaningless exercise . &quot; It would have no authority , no clout and no teeth , &quot; said Mike Jendrzejczyk , Washington director of Human_Rights Watch ( Asia ) . The Administration is facing a deadline of June 3 to decide whether to renew China ' s most-favored-nation trade benefits , which permit Chinese goods to be sold in this country under the same low tariffs enjoyed by virtually all other countries . Last year , Clinton suggested that China should make &quot; overall significant progress &quot; on human_rights if it wanted renewal of these benefits for next year . The President ' s decision to renew the trade benefits would stand unless both houses of Congress passed a resolution to revoke it . As Clinton prepared to announce his decision on future policy toward China , the White_House struggled throughout Wednesday to win the critical support of Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) , the principal architect of the policy of linking trade benefits to human_rights . In the last few days , the main question was not whether Clinton would renew China ' s overall trade benefits , since all sides have agreed for weeks that he would do so . Rather , the issue was whether he would impose sanctions on Chinese imports in response to rights abuses . Administration officials hope to avoid the embarrassment of a split with Mitchell , who has urged the White_House to impose some significant sanctions on Chinese products . The White_House was considering limited economic sanctions on Chinese weapons , or no penalties at all . But Mitchell was pressing for broader , more significant penalties on all Chinese products made by the People ' s Liberation Army or by defense-related companies . Not only is Mitchell the Senate majority_leader , he has also done more_than anyone to create the China issue that was used for years by congressional Democrats against former President George_Bush . In the years after China ' s bloody 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations , he pressed for legislation attaching conditions to the renewal of China ' s trade benefits . Eventually , Clinton embraced Mitchell ' s approach during the 1992 campaign , when he accused Bush of &quot; coddling dictators &quot; in Beijing and criticized Bush for vetoing legislation on the issue that Mitchell had sponsored . Now , after a year in the White_House , Clinton is backing_away from Mitchell ' s policy . Administration officials said he plans to drop the presidential executive order he issued last year attaching a series of human_rights conditions to the renewal of China ' s most-favored trade status . By imposing penalties exclusively on Chinese-made guns and ammunition , the Administration would , in_effect , convert the China trade issue into a gun-control measure . Mitchell has objected , saying that the penalties on Chinese-made guns and ammunition do not go_far enough . China exports more_than $ 31 billion in products to the United States , and the guns and ammunition make_up only a tiny share of these sales . The Administration has been under intense pressure from the U.S. business_community to renew China ' s trade benefits . U.S. firms fear that if the benefits are revoked , China will retaliate against U.S. companies and deal instead only with their European and Asian competitors . The executive order that Clinton issued last year put the Administration into an awkward position . Officials believed at the time that the human_rights conditions they imposed were so reasonable and limited that China would be willing_and_able to meet them . Under the 1993 order , China was required to open the way for emigration of the families of some dissidents and to take action to curb the export of goods made with prison labor . In addition , China was supposed to make &quot; overall significant progress &quot; on releasing dissidents from prison , on stopping the jamming of Voice of America broadcasts and on preserving Tibet ' s cultural heritage . China has repeatedly denounced imposition of these conditions and has said it will never be pressured into changing its domestic policies .</TEXT>
