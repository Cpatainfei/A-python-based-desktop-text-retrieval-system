   <HEADLINE> BOUTROS-GHALI URGES U.N. WARNING TO SOMALI WARLORDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a somber report , Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged the Security_Council on Thursday to warn feuding Somali warlords to reconcile by September ' s end or face the possible withdrawal of all U.N. peacekeepers from their country . His careful words , etched with pessimism , underscored the prospect that then-President George_Bush ' s dispatch of more_than 25 # 000 Marines to Somalia beginning in December , 1992 , and the large U.N. peacekeeping operations that followed will prove to have done little to untangle the Somalis ' political turmoil . Boutros-Ghali blamed the depressing situation on the continual feuding between Mogadishu warlords Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Gen . Mohammed Farah Aidid . He lamented the failure of both the United States and the United Nations to disarm them . Bush refused to involve U.S. Marines in_general disarmament , and President Clinton persuaded the United Nations to call_off all aggressive engagements after 18 Rangers died in October , 1993 , in an abortive U.N. manhunt for Aidid . In recent months , the Clinton_Administration , which has withdrawn all American troops from the peacekeeping mission , has urged the United Nations to reduce the number of its troops to save money . The United Nations now has 18 # 760 peacekeeping troops in Somalia . But Boutros-Ghali -- while accepting limited reductions -- proposed holding_off substantial cuts while giving Mahdi and Aidid until the end of September to reach a peace settlement . The secretary_general acknowledged that &quot; the omens do not appear promising. &quot; In the report , he said that &quot; lack of progress in disarmament , as well as factional disputes , inter-clan rivalries and conflicts , have made_it impossible to proceed with the establishment of a central administrative mechanism. &quot; He mostly blamed feuding within the Hawiye clan -- to which both Mahdi and Aidid belong . He said dissension and tension among all 15 political factions of Somalia &quot; are also by and large attributable to rivalries within the Hawiye clan. &quot; Mahdi and Aidid have promised to take_part in a Hawiye reconciliation conference , Boutros-Ghali said , &quot; but there are . . . no clear signs that preparations for a Hawiye conference are under way. &quot; Still , he proposed that the Security_Council wait a_few more weeks to see if the Hawiyes convene one . Discussing the numbers of troops , he said that it would be possible to cut the force to 17 # 200 by the end of September and even to 15 # 000 without preventing it from carrying_out its mandate . Peacekeepers now have authority mainly to guard airports and seaports , escort relief convoys , protect the premises of humanitarian groups and organize a police_force and judicial_system . Although Boutros-Ghali confessed to &quot; grave misgivings about the seriousness of their ( the Somali factions ' ) commitment to peace and national reconciliation , &quot; he said it is too early to conclude the U.N. mission &quot; cannot achieve the objectives for which it was established. &quot; The mission ' s U.N. mandate expires March 31 . Boutros-Ghali said &quot; there might even be a case for extending the mission . . . if national reconciliation can be achieved and an interim government established by the end of 1994. &quot; But an end to the peacekeeping mission could also halt relief operations , since there would no longer be troops to protect aid workers .</TEXT>
