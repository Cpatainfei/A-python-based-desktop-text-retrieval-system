   <HEADLINE> TRAVELING IN STYLE ; MEXICO ' S SECRET GARDEN ; SAN MIGUEL DE ALLENDE ' S NEW BOTANICAL PRESERVE ISN ' T JUST A BUNCH OF PRETTY FLOWERS : IT ' S AN ECOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE WONDERLAND OF DESERT LIFE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> IT ' S A FOUR-HOUR BUS RIDE NORTHWEST FROM MEXICO_CITY to San Miguel de Allende , a trip that takes the traveler far from streets choking with smog , factories belching smoke , body shops engulfed in clouds of paint fumes -- far from people , people , people . But San Miguel in the middle of a fiesta is not much of a refuge . My wife and I arrived there recently for Easter weekend to find ourselves in the middle of the Mexican version of Spring Break . Hordes of drunken day-trippers from Mexico_City packed every bar and restaurant and roamed the downtown streets whooping , crowing and belting off-key serenades . Walking up_to the church of the Oratorio de San Felipe Neri , I was met by an army of street_sweepers in orange jumpsuits busily cleaning_up the refuse from the day ' s Good_Friday procession . Billows of dust and manzanillo petals swirled in the air , mingling with the diesel exhaust of buses disgorging an endless stream of new arrivals ready to party . That night , as I tossed and turned , there was a constant clamoring of church_bells that sounded neither romantic nor exotic -- more like a John Cage composition of sheet_metal percussion playing an endless loop in my brain . I ' ve never considered myself a cranky traveler , but this was too_much . Even my wife was muttering about finding some over-the-counter Valium . But the next day , someone suggested that we flee the city and take a stroll through the region ' s newest and most un-resortlike attraction -- the botanical preserve called El Charco del Ingenio , The Pool of the Ingenious One . The Charco , which draws its name from its series of rock pools and from the fact that the term ingenio was traditionally applied in colonial America to those who constructed waterworks , covers more_than 160 acres on the plateau above San Miguel . Although only 15 minutes from the center of town by taxi , it is so far off the beaten tourist track that even my cabdriver didn ' t know where it was . I had him drop me at Gigante , the huge , ugly , orange-and-pink neo-deco supermarket that sits coincidentally close to the new prison . I trudged over the dusty plain , through a local dump decorated with what looked_like the remains of a love gone sour -- underwear , rebozos and shoes tossed angrily among burnt cans and broken rum bottles -- and followed a dirt road that led to a wide wooden gate . Here was El Charco del Ingenio . And for five pesos , peace was mine . I had plenty of room to indulge my desire for solitude : Thirty of the 160 acres are laced with nearly five miles of well-marked pathways leading to a domed conservatory , as yet unfinished , containing hundreds of species from a dozen Mexican states , then down along the shore of La Presa de las Colonias ( a large reservoir that supplies water to the towns north of San Miguel ) and along the edge of a dramatic steep ravine . The ravine , called the Landeta Arroyo , is dotted with a series of descending rocky pools , shrouded by pepper_trees , willows and giant garambullo cacti . Down in the green waters of the deepest pool , nestled in the sheer granite walls of the arroyo , it is said , lives Chan , the local Chichimecas ' god of water . The botanical_gardens and the 130 acres of ecological reserve on the far side of the arroyo retain a strong connection to the indigenous Toltec-Chichimeca peoples . All the stone border pathways , mosaics and the four large plazas of the garden were designed and built by Chichimeca stone masons and ironworkers , contributors to a lasting landmark to the culture that inhabited the area before the arrival of the Spanish 500 years ago . In the Plaza of the Four Winds , roughly in the center of the park , stands a large red stone cross on a pyramid of stones and flowering plants . The cross is left purposefully rough on one side and is overlaid by another cross made of cane . Here is where the Spanish and Chichimeca intersect , for the cross is a symbol sacred to both cultures . The pyramid was completed and purified by Chichimeca elders when the garden was dedicated , at precisely the moment of the total_eclipse of the sun visible in San Miguel on July 11 , 1991 . The plaza is the centerpiece of the garden , offering the best view not only of the preserve but also of the surrounding countryside to the Chichimecas ' four cardinal points , the four distant mountain_ranges , the four winds of life . There are four circles marking these points on the inlaid stone floor , each with a mosaic highlighting the Chichimeca world_view : To the north is a brown pyramid , the color of earth ; to the south in green and blue is a swirling spring , signifying water ; to the west , colored red , is a coyote , representing the animal_kingdom , and to the east is a yellow maguey plant , the most important member of the plant world in this semi-arid land . I walked west toward the far end of the garden , to Sunset Point , where the path curves around onto the edge of a steep precipice . This is where the arroyo ' s mouth widens and marches to the north to the Mountain of Dangerous Water . Directly in front , it falls_away into another reservoir , where the ruins of an old mill stand decaying . A section of an aqueduct dating_from colonial times rises from the water . And to the south rise the spires of the churches of San Miguel . The gothic needles of the main church , the Parrochia , are most prominent , and are elegantly offset by the silver and gold dome of the Oratorio church . From here the context of the town is fulfilled , its relation_to the land revealed . Crows came cawing up the arroyo , while to my left , I could hear the scream of a peacock in Atascadero , the complex of condominiums and mansions , complete with lap pools and 40-foot-high living_rooms , where much of San Miguel ' s wealthy expatriate population lives . The view from Atascadero is much the same as the one I was enjoying at the moment -- but I couldn ' t help feeling that these visual riches were mine alone . MY CRANKY MOOD DISSIPATED AS I slipped into the rhythm of the countryside . The ragged sound of an out-of-tune , out-of-sync brass_band floated up in the wind , mixing with the brays of burros , the barking of dogs , the plaintive bleat of a herd of goats nibbling at the edge of the lower reservoir . A pair of snow-white ibises meandered through the muck at the edge of a pool hundreds of feet below me , probing repeatedly in the mud . It was nearing dusk as I finally headed back to the main entrance . Along the way , I passed a field of golden_barrel_cacti , a_few of them an astounding four feet high . Their tops were bright gold and as the spines tapered down along the ribbed sides , they softened into yellow , ochre and pale white . It ' s reassuring to see them because they are a rare species in the Mexican wild , where 90 % of their natural habitat has disappeared in recent years . Beyond them I could see the border of the garden , now railway ties and wire , but growing slowly in an even line was the fence of the future : the stubby deep green pillars of organ cactus . To beat the twilight closing , I raced along the water-side trail of the Presa de las Colonias , dodging overhanging mesquite and garambullo . I wanted to visit the conservatory , which is dedicated largely to succulents . In this pipe-frame structure , the variety of specimens is enormous , ranging from globular mounds that look_like brightly speckled eggs to fuzzy , wispy brushes to tall and twisty pipe shapes to earth-hugging dollops that are more mineral than vegetable in look . Many are ringed in tiny flowers , tiaras of ruby and emerald and yellow gold and sapphire . Near the entrance , in a covered shed , hundreds of smaller cacti were lined_up in tiny posts , selling for $ 1 to $ 5 , depending_on the rarity . The retail stall is a fairly new addition to the park , part of the plan to make the project self-supporting and to foster among locals an economic respect for the environment . As I inspected the plants , I heard a bicycle on the dirt trail behind me . It was a guard , making his round through the park . Another guard lives in a small cottage across the presa , he told me , who conducts his daily circuit on horseback . The bicyclist stopped to peer through a pair of binoculars . &quot; What do you see ? &quot; I asked , expecting him to point_out one of the scores of migratory birds that use the lake as a stopping-off point . &quot; Look , &quot; he said , handing me the glasses . &quot; See the people ? &quot; On the far side of the lake , near the ruins of an old hacienda , I spotted a pair of kids jumping the fence . No collecting of anything is allowed_in the reserve -- no firewood , no nopales , no cacti fruit . Without another word , he set_off on his bike , pedaling furiously . THE NEXT DAY I WALKED OVER TO the headquarters for Cante , the private nonprofit foundation that is the organizing force behind the botanical_gardens . My host was Federico Gama , a former sociologist and co-founder of Cante -- a Chichimecan word meaning &quot; water that gives life. &quot; Construction of the garden began four years ago but as Gama quickly told me , &quot; a botanical_garden never ends. &quot; Gama , middle-aged , born and educated in Mexico_City , formed Cante in 1987 -- a nonprofit concept centered_on rural development projects with an ecologically Mexican bent , mixing art and cultural preservation with conservation and self-help communal associations . Cante developed slowly , but then Gama met Charles Glass , one of the world ' s foremost experts on cacti . Glass had just returned to Mexico from his home_in Arizona to resume research he had started decades earlier . Concerned that urban growth and expanded agriculture were threatening the Mexican cactus population , Glass was investigating means of artificially propagating these species . He was immediately attracted to Gama ' s multipart plan for a large natural garden dedicated to the arid and semi-arid lands of the high plateau , a nature preserve for endangered species from all_over Mexico and a reforestation project in the mountains to the southeast . The two began collaborating , and the seeds for El Charco del Ingenio were sown . &quot; It is possible to make an experience like this self-sustained , without destroying nature , &quot; Gama said . &quot; It ' s an attempt to fight modernization , in which progress means changing everything in a way that harms nature . It ' s hard to explain to people . Many see us as ecology freaks who are doing something very nice . My feeling is we are doing what has to be the future of nature. &quot; I asked him why he even bothered trying to educate a population largely dependent_on tourist dollars -- a population whose roots in the campo are growing ever weaker . He shrugged and shook his head . &quot; Why not ? &quot; he answered . Why not indeed ? I ENLISTED MY WIFE AS Awalking partner the next morning , and we set_off to visit the pool where Chan , the water god , lives . We headed_up the ravine , walking under the shade of pepper_trees and willows . At the first pool , the path we had been following faded into nothing and we wandered lost for a_few minutes . I crawled out of the brush and heard the thick drone of a beehive thrumming busily in the rock face above me . This wasn ' t the way -- or at least not our way . At the second pool , we came_upon a pair of lovers entwined in a desperate embrace . Coughing loudly to announce our approach , we said our good_days and asked where the trail to the water god ' s pool was . The young_man smiled awkwardly and pointed over his shoulder at the opposite side of the ravine . &quot; It ' s over there , &quot; he said . &quot; Turn right at the garambullo. &quot; His girlfriend kept her head discreetly buried in the crook of his arm . The trail hugged the side of the arroyo , just above where the high-water_mark would be in rainy_season , and as we scrambled through the bushes and over the dried lichen of rocks , we regretted our Gap shorts and our walking_shoes designed more for concrete than an uneven , dried riverbed . One pool led to another and as we progressed up the arroyo , the walls closed_in on us . Looking_up we could see the nests of birds and scores of garambullos and other cacti clinging_to small ledges in the granite . The view from here was far more intimate than that afforded from the garden above . The trail petered out against a solid stone_wall and we angled back in to the riverbed , climbing over huge rocks . After another hour of scrambling over rocks , we eventually came_to the end of our journey , the still , deep pool of Chan . Far above us , the stone walkways of the garden were clearly visible as they zigzagged along the walls of the arroyo . This was as far as we could go and it was just as well . My feet were killing me and we had run_out of water a half-hour earlier . But I wasn ' t sorry we had come . While the view from the garden had opened my eyes to the country , making the trek to the pool of Chan was the closest I had come_to the home of a god .
