   <HEADLINE> FAEROE ISLANDS ' BOOM TIMES WASH AWAY ; EUROPE : ARCHIPELAGO IN THE NORTH_SEA PROSPERED WITH ITS RICH FISHING GROUNDS . BUT A COLLAPSE HAS LEFT RESIDENTS SADDLED WITH DEBT , SOCIAL PROBLEMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like the fog that often envelops their weathered landscape , an economic and social crisis has crept over the islands that once seemed like an oasis amid the ills of Europe . An economic boom in the early 1980s has yielded to recession in the semi-independent Danish territory , a North_Sea archipelago of striking fjords 250 miles north of Britain . Jobs are no longer plentiful . Drug and crime problems are growing . Money is tight , and young people are emigrating . The good times are over in the Faeroes . &quot; We lived_on borrowed money without thinking_of what tomorrow would bring , &quot; Premier Marita Petersen said . Rich fishing grounds in the North Atlantic helped bring prosperity to the 41 # 000 Faeroese , who are outnumbered by the 70 # 000 sheep and millions of birds on their 18 islands . The territorial legislature won huge subsidies from Denmark , using much of the money to build roads , tunnels and bridges along the fjords to link the shorelines to hamlets on the sheer cliffs above . Borrowed money bought fishing_boats and new houses . Satellite dishes sprouted from the grass-covered roofs of wooden cottages painted yellow , green or blue . New Japanese cars became commonplace , stores were_well supplied and video shops offered the latest American hits . Then , in the mid-1980s , the stocks of fish began shrinking just as world prices went_into decline . By the early 1990s , the island economy was near collapse . &quot; We don ' t sell on credit any longer . No one does , &quot; said Jon Heinesen , a household_appliances dealer in Torshavn , capital of the islands . Economic problems have dramatically altered the attitudes of Faeroese . In the early 1970s , they would not go_along with Denmark in joining what has since become the European Union , citing the strict fishing quotas . But in the July election , most voters chose the Unionist Party , which advocated EU membership as the only way_out of the economic hole . The Social Democrats dropped from 10 seats to five in the 32-member legislature and the Unionists gained two seats for a total of eight . The Faeroes would join the EU under the wing of Denmark , which has handled their foreign_policy , defense , justice and currency since 1948 and provides subsidies of more_than $ 150 million a year . Bjarni Olsen of the islands ' Economic Council blamed the economic troubles on a decade of &quot; unprofitable investments in both the private and the public sector. &quot; Premier Petersen , a Social Democrat serving as caretaker until a new government is formed , put it more bluntly : &quot; We ' re all responsible . All the political_parties backed these expenditures. &quot; Many businesses connected with fishing , which accounts_for 97 % of exports , have gone broke_in the last few years . Two years ago , the island government asked Denmark to lend a hand in helping struggling businesses . The Danish Parliament voted an extra $ 462 million , but it did not solve the problems . Last year , the Faeroes ' foreign debt reached $ 1.13 billion . Unemployment has grown to 17 % and an estimated 5 # 000 people in their 20s and 30s , more_than 12 % of the population , have emigrated to Denmark , the government says . Police say reported cases of theft and drug smuggling have increased by about 20 % . Mogens Neper-Kristensen , chief of the island police , said the increase in crime is &quot; probably linked to the slump. &quot; Some Faeroese take_heart in the recent discovery of oil south of the islands , but Petersen cautioned : &quot; Let ' s be prudent about making big dreams. &quot;</TEXT>
