   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI ; WIMBLEDON WAS PREPARED FOR ' PROBLEM FANS , ' INCLUDING PIERCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Security has become a major priority at Wimbledon . Tennis stalkers . . . obsessive fathers . . . the possibility of terrorism -- they all have contributed to the increased presence of police_officers and contingency plans . So skittish are officials about the arrival of so-called &quot; problem fans &quot; that photographs of the best-known offenders have been posted within the Wimbledon complex . Included on the list is Jim Pierce , father of Mary Pierce . Pierce , known for his abusive behavior toward his daughter , is banned from attending WTA Tour events . For reasons still not entirely clear , Mary Pierce , seeded seventh at Wimbledon , withdrew before the tournament . Billie Jean King , a former Wimbledon champion and HBO broadcaster , suggested that Pierce ' s departure had more to do with her fear of playing_on grass than the possibility of Jim Pierce making an uninvited appearance . Maybe so , but posters of Jim Pierce were distributed to Wimbledon security_guards that read : &quot; This man is banned from the grounds . Stop him from entering if possible . However , if sighted he must_not be challenged but control must be informed. &quot; As for King ' s theory that Mary Pierce ducked Wimbledon , not everyone agreed with the assessment . Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker recently had dinner with Pierce . The two discussed the situation , specifically Jim Pierce . &quot; I strongly think that she had a bit of a problem with her father , and you know , she is a very good tennis_player obviously , &quot; Becker said . &quot; She doesn ' t have to fear nobody. &quot; Pierce defeated Steffi Graf at the_French Open and has been hailed as the newest star on a tour in need of fresh faces . &quot; It ' s quite a new life for her , and you know , with having a father like that , what could she do really ? &quot; Becker said . &quot; You know , everything has been so fast now . In about four weeks , you know , she is supposed to save the women ' s game and I think she needs time to think_about the whole picture , what she wants to do_in tennis and then she is going_to be back strong. &quot; * In a mostly uneventful first-round 6-4 , 6-3 loss to Larisa Neiland , American Katrina Adams was summoned to a postmatch news_conference by curious British tabloid reporters . After an obligatory question about Adams ' play , the reporters zeroed_in on the controversy that mattered . Question : &quot; Your colorful clothing caused a little bit of a stir , I understand , on Court Five -- particularly your underwear . Can you tell us about that ? &quot; that ' s right , an underwear expose . Adams ' multicolored tennis undies , called Fancy Pants , were seen early and often because of the blustery conditions . If they were noticeable , it was only because of the All England Lawn_Tennis Club ' s strict rule regarding predominantly white playing wear . Adams ' tennis pants were pink , green , black_and_white . &quot; If it ' s any consolation to you , &quot; the_British reporter said , &quot; we all thought they were very attractive anyway. &quot; Said Adams , who was making her seventh appearance at Wimbledon : &quot; Thanks a lot . You saw my bottom a lot today , huh ? No peeping Toms or anything. &quot; Meanwhile , the fashion police found time to criticize the ultra-baggy ( by tennis standards ) shorts worn by Americans Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras . Agassi has said the shorts were designed at his request , though a Nike spokesman reportedly disputed the claim . Nike said Sampras first wanted a looser-fitting pair of shorts . Whatever the case , the baggies weren ' t much of a hit with the upper_crust at Wimbledon . &quot; Agassi looked an absolute mess , &quot; Alan Little , librarian at the Wimbledon museum , told the London Times . &quot; I have never seen anyone look so scruffy on a Wimbledon court . I hope this doesn ' t start yet another fashion. &quot; Little has seen every male Wimbledon champion since 1950 . He remains no fan of Agassi ' s court-wear tastes . &quot; At this rate he could be in long johns next year , &quot; he said . * In an effort to make ATP Tour matches more interesting , the respective Player and Tournament Councils recently announced four changes in policy : -- Spectators , who usually are expected to keep their mouths shut , will be allowed &quot; to spontaneously react during a point as long as it is not intended to distract players. &quot; -- The time between points will be reduced from 25 seconds to 20 . -- Fans with seats in the upper reaches of tennis stadiums will be allowed to move_in and out during points . -- Microphones will be positioned so conversations between players and officials can be heard by the audience . Some of the changes go_into effect as early as July 18 , but according to Bud Collins , a Tennis Hall_of_Fame inductee who writes for the Boston Globe and does analysis for NBC , the ATP Tour could have -- and should have -- done more . Collins wanted the ATP Tour to open the men ' s locker_room to reporters . With the exception of the U.S. Open , no other tournament allows locker_room access to journalists -- a given_in almost all other major sports . The better the access , Collins said , the better chance the average tennis fan would learn more about the players on the tour . That might translate into more interest . Collins also suggested the ATP Tour put a clock_on the court ( a la the NBA ' s 24-second shot ) for the latest time rule change . * The trickle-down effect from Jennifer Capriati ' s arrest could soon be seen on the WTA Tour . Members of a Women ' s Tennis Council select panel have completed their research on age minimums for players and new rules could be instituted by next year . The panel ' s results will be released during the U.S. Open , which begins Aug . 29 . At present , players 14 and older are allowed to compete on the tour . But there is a movement to increase the limit to 16 , maybe even as high as 17 -- partly because of reaction from Capriati ' s April arrest on marijuana possession . Critics of the current minimum-age standard contend that Capriati ' s situation could have been the partial result of her early entrance on the WTA Tour . Others , such_as Billie Jean King , who contributed to the select panel ' s research , are less sure about the effects of increasing the limit . &quot; There have been many 13- and 14-year-olds , like Steffi Graf and Gabriela Sabatini , who have made the adjustment to pro life , but the media deals with just the exceptions , &quot; King said .</TEXT>
