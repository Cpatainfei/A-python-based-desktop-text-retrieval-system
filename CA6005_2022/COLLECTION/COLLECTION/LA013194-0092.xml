   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL , PLO MOVE CLOSER TO ACCORD ; MIDEAST : ARAFAT SAYS ANOTHER WEEK IS NEEDED TO COMPLETE DRAFTING OF AGREEMENT ON PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE . BOTH SIDES INDICATE EXTENSIVE COMPROMISES WERE OFFERED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization came_close to an agreement Sunday that would have cleared the way for implementation of their accord on Palestinian self-government , but they found that two days of intensive negotiations were not enough to resolve the complex issues involved . PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat , with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres at his side , said at least another week would be needed to reach compromises on a number of issues and to complete drafting of the agreement . &quot; Many principles have been agreed upon , &quot; Arafat said after emerging from eight hours of talks with Peres late Sunday . &quot; We are now looking_to the drafting . . . but ( these agreements ) have to be drafted accurately to ensure the accord is implemented precisely . &quot; At this point , it is_better not to hurry. &quot; Although Israeli and PLO officials declined to disclose details of the negotiations , they indicated that both sides made extensive compromises on control of the entry points into the Gaza Strip and the Jericho District in the West_Bank after Palestinians establish their administration there , among other issues . But Peres , pressed to further explain the points of disagreement , replied simply , &quot; The drafting. &quot; Both sides were disappointed because they had believed earlier in the day that they were within reach of a broad , if still tentative , agreement on the major issues that have held_up implementation of the accord for the last two months . Arafat , again with Peres at his side , had announced , in fact , that he would meet with Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin this week in Cairo to sign the agreement , which would be the next major step toward peace in the Middle_East . But the negotiators failed , despite their late evening talks and the mediation of Egyptian Foreign Minister Amir Moussa , to agree on a package of measures that could be presented to Rabin and the PLO leadership for approval . &quot; This is natural and not a surprise , &quot; Yasser Abed-Rabbo , a member of the PLO Executive Committee , said after the two delegations broke_off talks at midnight . &quot; Some of the problems are in the details , and some are in the substance . Above all , however , is a mutual desire for a very clear agreement , a very explicit agreement , because we want to avoid problems in carrying it out. &quot; Uri Savir , director general of Israel ' s Foreign Ministry , went_further , describing the negotiating session here as &quot; the best meeting yet &quot; in the current series of talks on implementing the autonomy accord , which was signed_in September . But he too said neither side had realized how difficult it would be to settle the details of the new agreement once the basic_principles had been resolved . A major problem was Peres ' limited authority , according to PLO officials . Although Arafat was ready to commit the PLO to measures agreed by the negotiators , Peres said he would have to take them back to Rabin , who found himself preoccupied Sunday by a bitter parliamentary debate on Israeli health_care reforms and unable to focus_on the negotiations . Peres acknowledged his need to consult Rabin but promised answers when he meets Arafat in Cairo , probably next Sunday . Arafat had raised expectations of a major breakthrough in the long-stalemated talks when he told the World Economic Forum , an annual gathering of political and business_leaders here , that he and Peres had virtually resolved the issues that have delayed the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho District . Officials on both sides cited major compromises on the issue of border controls . Israel has insisted on maintaining total control over entry and exit from the two areas to prevent the return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees , to ensure that arms are not smuggled in and to underline that the regions are not , in fact , independent . The PLO has sought to minimize the Israeli security controls , particularly Israeli searches of entering Palestinians , and to heighten its own presence through the deployment of Palestinian police_officers , Palestinian flags and other symbols of statehood . The negotiations Sunday also addressed questions about the borders of the Jericho District , according to Israeli and PLO sources , and about the protection of Jewish settlers , now numbering about 5 # 000 , who will remain in the Gaza Strip after the autonomy accord takes_effect . Clearly pleased that the lengthy impasse in the negotiations appeared to be almost over and that implementation of the autonomy accord would soon begin , Arafat thanked Peres profusely for &quot; his positive stance &quot; in the talks here and a week earlier in Oslo . Peres replied with praise for Arafat for &quot; his supreme effort to bring our peoples together in peace and hope. &quot; In their search for an agreement after weeks of frustrated negotiations , the delegations had put new and modified proposals on the table , enlarging what had been almost agreed upon in Oslo and earlier in Cairo until they had what one participant described as &quot; a package worth the price. &quot; Peres , addressing the World Economic Forum , said the negotiations have not been easy for either side . For its part , however , Israel is determined &quot; to make the Palestinian story a story of success , a story of good neighborliness , a story of hope for coming generations , &quot; Peres said . Arafat and Peres , who had mounted the stage hand-in-hand , both appealed for international support , economic as well as political , to ensure the success of the autonomy accord , signed_in September . Replying to a question , Arafat said that extremist groups opposed to compromises he has made in the negotiations with Israel will probably try to undermine the accord ' s implementation . &quot; These fanatic groups will increase in this atmosphere of instability , poverty and injustice , &quot; Arafat said , saying they will be countered by &quot; justice , justice , justice for all_of us -- and at_the_same_time , a very strong economic base . . . . &quot; &quot; Either we can have another Somalia , &quot; he said , noting that 58 % unemployment in the Gaza Strip feeds the unrest there , &quot; or we can have another Singapore . . . with the high skills and level of education that we have. &quot; Peres urged Western governments to provide investment guarantees for their companies to undertake projects in the Gaza Strip and West_Bank . &quot; If you can help us make the Middle_East prosperous , &quot; he told the business_leaders , &quot; peace will endure. &quot; Meanwhile , the absence of peace continued to fuel violence in impoverished Gaza on Sunday . A Jewish settler was shot and seriously wounded on a road leading to Gush Qatif , the largest group of Jewish settlements in the region and the target of frequent attacks by armed Palestinian groups opposed to the peace agreement . The Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas , which has vowed to fight the accord , distributed leaflets taking responsibility for the incident . Elsewhere in Gaza , the armed wing of Arafat ' s own Fatah group claimed responsibility Sunday for wounding three Israeli soldiers in a grenade attack on an army patrol in Rafah . That attack broke a cease-fire between Fatah and the Israeli army , begun after the peace agreement was signed . Many of Arafat ' s armed Fatah Hawks in the Gaza Strip say they will continue to attack the army as long as Israeli forces continue to arrest and imprison them .
