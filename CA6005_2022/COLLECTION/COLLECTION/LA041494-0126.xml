   <HEADLINE> EX-SOMIS COUPLE HELD ON BANKRUPTCY FRAUD CHARGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A former Ventura County couple , forced to declare bankruptcy after losing a lawsuit , were arrested Wednesday on federal indictments charging them with lying_in bankruptcy court to shield $ 1 million in embezzled funds and $ 9.5 million in furs and jewelry . Robert and June Dubin , former residents of Somis , face charges of bankruptcy fraud and conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles . In addition , Robert Dubin , 52 , is charged with filing false income_tax_returns . Prosecutors say he failed to mention more_than $ 1 million they believe he embezzled from one of his accounting clients . The Dubins , who now live_in Palm Springs , were each released on $ 25 # 000 bail and are awaiting trial . They could not be reached for comment . But the indictment paints a vivid picture of a couple scrambling to protect their most valuable assets after losing a lawsuit over a car accident . The story begins in 1987 , when June Dubin was involved in an accident that left another motorist dead , said Special Assistant U.S. Atty . Steven Jay Katzman . After a civil trial two years later , the Dubins were ordered to pay $ 4.4 million in damages . Three months after the court ruling , the Dubins declared bankruptcy . But the lawyer for the other party suspected they had not disclosed all their assets to the court , Katzman said . The lawyer contacted IRS and FBI_agents , who launched an investigation . According to the indictments , the agents charge that : * Robert Dubin , an accountant operating in Hollywood and Encino , embezzled more_than $ 1 million from a client , Arrow Highway Steel . He did not report this income in bankruptcy papers or on tax_returns . * June Dubin , 54 , moved jewelry , coins and crystal to her mother ' s house and failed to list these valuables as assets in the bankruptcy proceeding . * The Dubins failed to include 10 fur_coats , worth an estimated $ 42 # 400 in their statement of net worth . * The couple transferred $ 82 # 000 to a corporation , made_up of their children and stepchildren . The corporation then bought the Dubins a home_in Palm Springs . * The couple opened new bank_accounts to conceal some $ 234 # 800 in expected income . The income was not included in the assets listed for the bankruptcy . * The Dubins denied possessing or concealing these assets when questioned in a 1990 court hearing . Katzman said the suspected embezzlement came_to_light because of the bankruptcy investigation . Since embezzlement is not a federal crime , prosecutors are charging Dubin with making false_statements . Altogether he faces nine counts of conspiracy , bankruptcy fraud and making false_statements . His wife , June , faces one count of conspiracy and one count of fraud .</TEXT>
