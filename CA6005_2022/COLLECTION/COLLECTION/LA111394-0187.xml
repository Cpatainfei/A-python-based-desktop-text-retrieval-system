   <HEADLINE> A PRUDENT REALITY CHECK IN FANTASY LAND ; THERE CAN BE NO QUARREL WITH A MORE MODEST DISNEYLAND EXPANSION IN THIS ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Walt Disney Co . Chairman Michael Eisner ' s recent update on the Westcot project at Disneyland was not all that might have been hoped for , but it was not all that it might have been_on the negative side , either . In announcing that the scale of the project was being reconsidered , Eisner was vague on specifics , but at least left the impression that the company was looking_for an economically feasible way to do the project . For some time , it has been relegated to limbo status , leaving Anaheim and the region uncertain as_to how to plan . It could have been worse ; Eisner might have announced that the company was abandoning the project altogether . The idea that there will be something rather than nothing was reinforced by the subsequent announcement that Paul Pressler , the head of the company ' s Disney Stores division , had been appointed president of Disneyland . Pressler has overseen considerable growth in the stores and was described by the chairman as a &quot; star executive &quot; within the company . There can be no real quarrel with a more modest plan for the expansion in_view of the general economic climate . In his remarks this month , Eisner acknowledged that the company was still smarting from the more_than $ 550 million in losses from Euro Disneyland in France . It is hard to argue with the assessment that it might be wiser_to go_forward in increments rather than trying to take_on a colossal project . The city of Anaheim continues to handle the frustrating uncertainty as well as can be expected . It has made its own wise decision about the need to go_ahead with urban renovation in the Disneyland area as an investment in its future . The company ' s outstanding demand for $ 800 million in financial_support from the city , Orange County , and state and federal agencies still must be resolved , and the city has to mind its pocketbook . In addition to the comments on the new project , it was heartening to hear an affirmation of the company ' s commitment to the core Disneyland enterprise . Eisner said that the company was going_to continue putting money in . &quot; We ' re never going_to let Disneyland become an aging theme park , &quot; he said . While the company has spread in many directions , Disneyland remains an important part of the Orange County economy and a draw for tourism . Building on what has worked in the past makes_sense in a changing environment . If it means going_ahead with the new project in a less ambitious way , so be it . This is a time for realistic assessments .</TEXT>
