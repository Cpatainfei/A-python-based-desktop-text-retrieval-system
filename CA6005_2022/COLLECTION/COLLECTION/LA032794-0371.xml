   <HEADLINE> VALLEY BRIEFING : MOVING MOUNTAINS ; THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE SURROUNDING THE VALLEY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Craggy or rounded , green or purple , the mountains that ring the San Fernando Valley have many faces . Although their geologic histories are similar , the Santa Susanas and the Santa Monicas are youngsters compared to the granddaddy of our mountains , the San Gabriels . Before there was a San Fernando Valley , seas covered the area and dried_up , leaving sediment that turned_into rock . Underwater volcanoes erupted to the west , spewing lava . Then the tremendous forces that move continents caused land to fold and uplift , creating the mountains . The mountains we see today began pushing_up about 4 million years ago , eroding into the ranges that Valley residents know . Geologists attribute the existence of these mountains of the Transverse Range to the same forces that cause earthquakes on &quot; low-angle thrust defaults &quot; similar to the one that caused the Northridge quake . Quakes in these areas can create mountains or raise ranges that already exist . The Santa Susanas rose about 15 inches in the Jan . 17 quake . The 1971 Sylmar quake , also on a thrust_fault , lifted the San Gabriels three feet . The mountains are still rising and eroding , and evidence of earth-moving activity miles below the ground is visible in many areas . The San Andreas fault can be seen in the Antelope Valley , and other faults are visible in road cuts around Chatsworth . Layers of ancient sedimentary_rock , often tilted from past quakes , are noticeable at many places throughout the mountains . What Caused Our Mountains When plates collide rather than slide horizontally past each other , rocks will either fault ( crack ) , or fold upward , forming mountains . In our region , earthquakes on low-angle thrust_faults have caused rocks to move vertically , as well as horizontally . This results in the horizontal layers of sedimentary_rock , or strata , at the surface to be pushed_up . The buckling forms an arch called an anticline , visible as the upswept mountains that surround the Valley . Geologists categorize folds and , according to some geologists , the mountains here are the result of &quot; fault propagation folds. &quot; Similar to a rug on a floor being pushed together , rock layers that were once flat have been pushed_up when one block rises over another at a thrust_fault . What They Are Made Of The mountains are made_up of sedimentary , igneous and metamorphic_rock . Some sedimentary layers are horizontal but most are tilted and twisted due_to folding and uplift from quakes . Sedimentary rock is youngest and metamorphic_rock , which is the core of the mountains , is oldest . Sedimentary The result of weathering and erosion , these rocks formed from materials that were once part of older rocks , plants and animals . They accumulated in layers called strata and hardened . Most in our mountains are less than 18 million years old . * Sandstone : Natural chemical substances cement grains of sand together . * Shale : Clay is compressed into thin , hard layers , which often split apart . * Conglomerate : Naturally cemented gravel . Igneous_Rock that has solidified from a molten or nearly molten state . * Granite : Hard , coarsely crystalline rock that makes_up most of the Earth ' s continental crust . Metamorphic Sedimentary and igneous_rock that changed due_to heat or mountain-building movements deep in the Earth ' s crust , geologists call this &quot; basement &quot; rock . It makes_up the core of our mountains . * Gneiss : Formed from metamorphism of granite , causing feldspar and quartz crystals to form layers between which mica crystals often lie_in wavy bands . Where They Are Headed Geologists divide California into &quot; geomorphic &quot; regions . The Transverse Ranges east-west , the opposite of most other western ranges , which run north-south . Many geologists believe the Transverse Ranges used to run north-south before rotating 90 degrees starting about 14 million years ago . They believe this was caused by isolated blocks of rock caught between the southeastward-moving North_American plate and northwestward-moving Pacific plate . According to this theory , the twisting opened the space now occupied by the Los Angeles Basin . Santa Susana Mountains * Size : 30 miles long , 16 miles wide at longest point . * Highest point : Oat Mountains , 3 # 747 feet . * Appearance : Brushy slopes made_up of young , sedimentary_rock . The oldest exposed rock is 15 million years old . Very little metamorphic_rock is exposed . Vegetation is abundant because sedimentary_rock allows good soil to build_up quickly and good chaparral cover to develop . * History : About 3 million years ago , a large river created a delta in what is now the Santa Susanas and Simi Valley . The river existed until about 700 # 000 years ago , when seismic forces squeezed the area up , forming the Santa Susanas . The mountains lifted so quickly the river couldn ' t cut_through the range and was forced to the north , forming the Santa Clara River . San Gabriel Mountains * Size : 64 miles long , 24 miles at widest point . * Highest point : Mt . San Antonio , 10 # 064 feet . * Appearance : Erosion is deeper than other ranges , exposing older metamorphic and igneous_rock such_as granite and gneiss , giving the mountains their rocky , craggy look . Vegetation is sparse since there is little soil in which seeds can germinate . * History : Igneous_rocks in the range area age 80 million to 1.2 billion years , and some metamorphic_rocks are older than 1.5 billion years . Lifting began 45 million years ago ; by 25 million years ago , the mountains were fairly large . Rapid uplift has taken_place in the last 5 million years . Since at least 80 million years ago , about 12 miles of rock has been eroded and deposited into the Santa Monica Bay . Verdugo Mountains * Size : 14 miles long , 5 miles at widest point . * Highest point : Verdugo Peak , 3 # 126 feet . * Appearance : Exposed granite that formed 200 million years ago is visible . The Verdugos are considered the foothills of the San Gabriels , so their rock content is similar . They have the same geologic history of erosion of sedimentary layers . Santa Monica Mountains * Size : 50 miles long , 10 miles at widest point * Highest point : Sandstone Peak , 3 # 111 feet . * Appearance : Tilted sedimentary_rock , predominantly sandstone and shale , is rounded because it is young and less eroded . Underlying granite , the oldest rock , can be seen where they have been exposed by erosion in Griffith Park . Dark Santa Monica slates are visible in Topanga State Park and in road cuts along the San Diego Freeway . Brown or reddish volcanic_rock can be seen in the western part of the range . Modelo shale , which forms a mantle over the older rock layers on the north flank , is the youngest formation , containing fish and seaweed fossiles . Chaparral thrives in sedimentary soils of the steep hillsides . Formation of the Santa Monicas This geologic timeline highlights some of the events that formed the Santa Monica Mountains . Histories of other ranges parallel this one , although some rock is much older . Years on the timeline are approximate . 140 million years ago : Slates in area that is now Santa Monicas are formed when mud or shale is deposited beneath a shallow sea . 140 million years ago : Oldest known bird , Archaeopteryx , the size of a crow , flew the earth . 120 million years ago : Molten rock bakes sedimentary shales into slates and cools into granite . 90 million years ago : Period of uplift and erosion , with seas covering the land . Marine rocks that formed the cliffs in lower Topanga Canyon are deposited . 80 million years ago : Eroded area begins to be covered by oceanic sedimentary_rock . Area begins long period under water . 63 million years ago : Mammals became the dominant animals on Earth . 60 million years ago : Another cycle of erosion begins and then another return of the sea , laying_down sedimentary_rocks of marine origin , which can be seen from Topanga Canyon . 25 million years ago : Western part of range remains under water for another 10 million years . 15 million years ago : Underwater volcanoes near Conejo Mountain erupt , spewing lava , now visible as rock in Conejo Valley and Griffith Park . 13 million years ago : Volcano becomes extinct . Area again drops under water and remains that way for about 10 million years 5 million years ago to present : Seas recede . Compression pushes land_up , causing the folded and faulted rocks we see today . 2 million years ago : Modern human_beings develop and the Ice_Age begins . * Sources : California Division of Mines and Geology ; Dr. Peter Weigand , Dr. Eugene Fritche , Cal State Northridge ; Davis-Namson Consulting Geologists ; &quot; California Landscape &quot; ; &quot; Flowering Plants of the Santa Monica Mountains &quot; ; World Book Encyclopedia</TEXT>
