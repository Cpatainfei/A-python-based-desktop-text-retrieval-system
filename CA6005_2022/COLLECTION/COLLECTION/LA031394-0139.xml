   <HEADLINE> ART ; THE ART OF THE BODY_PART ; SCULPTOR KIKI SMITH HAS FOUND SUCCESS IN THE ART WORLD WITHOUT REALLY TRYING WITH HER DEFIANTLY FEMINIST BODY POLITICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There was much clucking of tongues last fall when the New York Times Magazine ran a laudatory profile of New York mega-dealer Arne Glimcher of the Pace-Wildenstein Gallery . There was Glimcher on the cover surrounded by his stable of talent -- all_of them solidly established male artists on the downside of 50 . Pace , a notorious bastion of male_chauvinism , built its foundation largely through representing Louise Nevelson during the ' 70s but hadn ' t taken_on a woman artist since Agnes Martin joined the gallery in the mid- ' 70s . In light of that , it came as a bit of surprise last month when Glimcher decided to throw his weight behind 40-year-old New York sculptor Kiki Smith . Not only is she a woman , but she makes intensely emotional , defiantly feminine art that ' s markedly at_odds with the generally ultra-cool Pace aesthetic . &quot; Every so often an extraordinary artist happens , and Kiki ' s one of them , &quot; Glimcher says of Smith , who since 1990 has shown locally with the Shoshana Wayne Gallery . &quot; Her work is resonating very powerfully in the culture right now because it ' s intensely personal . . . . Kiki ' s work isn ' t the product of a system or school -- it ' s about her. &quot; Smith is inarguably the toast of the town at the moment , but all it takes is a brief conversation with her to deduce that she ' s singularly lacking in the careerist instincts one assumes are mandatory if one wants to play hardball with the big boys in the upper echelons of the art world . &quot; I ' m just a hippie , and the work I make is totally sentimental and schlocky , &quot; Smith cheerfully points_out during an interview in the bar of a Santa Monica hotel . Smith , the subject of an exhibition at the University Art Museum at UC Santa Barbara on view through April 17 , scored her first solo show just five years ago and seems to regard the fact that she ' s currently hailed as one of the most influential artists of her generation with a mixture of incredulity and delight . &quot; I don ' t know where my career came from -- it ' s a miracle , &quot; says the artist , who reportedly decided to leave her dealer of 10 years , Joe Fawbush , and relocate to Pace on the advice of her astrologer . &quot; I don ' t even know that I wanted it -- it just happened. &quot; Smith ' s career is indeed happening -- she was lauded as one of the few redeeming presences in last year ' s otherwise much-maligned Whitney Biennial , and prices for her major works currently hover around $ 75 # 000 . The reasons for Smith ' s ascent are easy to trace . For starters , she takes the human_body as her central theme , and at the moment the body is the subject in art ( this could have to do with the fact that baby_boomers , hard hit by the politics of abortion and the AIDS epidemic , are now middle-aged and are looking death in the face for the first time ) . Exploring ideas concerning mortality and the body first introduced by Joseph Beuys and Bruce Nauman , Smith ' s work presents the body as a politicized arena in which the great battles of culture and humanity are waged . Her sculpture , however , differs from most current militant body art by virtue of its unabashed lyrical edge ; Smith is an unrepentant romantic , and whereas her colleagues cultivate a clinical edge_in their art , she inflects hers with mysticism and the heavy perfume of Surrealism . In a sense , her art can be read as a reaction to dominant art-world trends of the ' 80s , when irony ruled supreme , money and power was the name of the game , and art was big , slick and often produced assembly-line fashion . The mark of the artist ' s hand is front and center in Smith ' s sculpture , which is fashioned out of a diverse range of materials , including exotic papers , beads , salt , tin , beeswax , cloth , human hair , glass and bronze . Ideologically , Smith ' s work is painfully human , direct and free_of irony . Her imagery , focusing_on the body ' s failures and traumas , as opposed to an eroticized idealization , has been described as morbid by some who squirm at evocations of bodily_fluids , fetuses and mammary_glands . Included in the Santa Barbara exhibition , overseen by museum curator Liz Brown , is &quot; Train , &quot; a 1993 life-size wax_figure of a female nude with a spray of red beads trailing from her vagina . A few feet away is &quot; Zweite Auswahl ( Second Choice ) , &quot; a 1987 work of ceramic and bronze that is essentially a bowl of human organs , and &quot; Untitled ( Red_Man ) , &quot; from 1991 , a life-size human form cast in paper ; the arms and head have been torn loose and laid_in front of the torso , which is tacked to the wall like a forlorn , deflated balloon . The room fairly pulsates with intimations of mortality . &quot; My body has always treated me well -- I ' ve hardly been_sick at all -- but despite that , I don ' t have a good relationship with my body , &quot; says Smith , a tall , exotic woman who tends to dress in black , sports several tattoos and has an ethereal air that is at_odds with the challenging art she makes . &quot; I wasn ' t raised to have a relationship with my body at all , and maybe it ' s because I ' m not very physically conscious that I make the work I do . I think_of myself as sort of floating and have to make an effort to think_about the body because I ' m not in it enough. &quot; So precisely what is_on her mind as far as thinking_about the body these days ? &quot; Well , certain body_parts don ' t hold as much meaning for me -- I never really cared much about brains , for instance , &quot; she says with a laugh . &quot; There are other body_parts that seem used_up -- hearts , for example ; there are zillions of images of hearts around -- so that ' s something I avoid . As to what body_parts are most compelling to me , that changes all_the time . &quot; At the moment I ' ve been thinking a lot about the back of the knee -- it ' s such a sexy spot -- and I ' ve been thinking_about parts of the body where there ' s no fat and the skin is very thin . The skin between the upper leg and the abdomen , at the back of the knee , and under the arms is very vulnerable and thin , and maybe people fly in and out of your body there -- maybe those are entry points . These areas of the body remind me of Santos figures popular in the Philippines , where the trunk and extremities are carved out of wood and the joints are made of cloth. &quot; Religious art -- particularly the medieval sculpture of southern Germany -- is a major influence on Smith , who was born in Nuremberg , Germany , and raised Catholic . More significant than Smith ' s religious training , however , was the cultural milieu she grew_up in . As the daughter of opera singer Jane Wilson and the rigorously pure proto-Minimalist sculptor Tony Smith , she was raised in a world where &quot; art was never separated_out from life -- it was just part of it. &quot; Tony Smith , an internationally acclaimed sculptor credited with having served as a crucial link between ' 50s Abstract_Expressionism and Minimalist art of the ' 60s , was also represented by the Pace Gallery before his death in 1980 -- which , coincidentally or not , also happens to be the year when Smith discovered the body as the ideal vehicle for the things she wanted to express in her work . &quot; Prior to my father ' s death I was having a hard_time committing to a career as an artist , but that ' s not because of who he was -- it was because of who I am , &quot; she points_out . &quot; It ' s true , though , that I felt I shouldn ' t compete with him and that those feelings went_away after he died . But I don ' t see my work as diametrically opposed to my father ' s -- some people say it is -- and I ' ve never felt the need to metaphorically ' kill ' my father or deny his existence . I love my father ' s work and I learned a lot from him -- the most important thing being that art is a practice of necessity . He absolutely had to do his work and it always came first in his life , and though I probably didn ' t like that as a child , I ' m very sympathetic to it now. &quot; Smith grew_up in the suburbs of New Jersey , the eldest of three girls . She describes her childhood as &quot; not quite normal. &quot; &quot; I was raised to do nothing , &quot; she says , laughing . &quot; I don ' t know what my parents had_in_mind , but I had no ambition whatsoever . I practically flunked out of high_school , then enrolled in trade_school and studied baking because I thought I ' d do manual_labor the rest of my life . After baking school I went_to live_in San Francisco , but it was too lackadaisical for me -- everybody was smoking pot , which I never liked , and being from the East Coast , I wanted to do something . Lounging_around in nice weather didn ' t make_sense to me , so I left after a year. &quot; From there , Smith enrolled at the Hartford Art_School in Connecticut , but she dropped_out after a year and a half . She finally rolled into Manhattan in 1976 planning to go_to art_school , but &quot; after I dropped my portfolio off at the School of Visual Arts , I never went_back to pick it up because I was afraid they would n ' t let me in . Then a friend told me , ' You don ' t have to go_to school -- you can just be an artist , ' and that seemed more appealing than finding_out whether I ' d been accepted at school. &quot; From there , Smith embarked_on the perfunctory series of odd jobs -- she was employed by a factory where she airbrushed clouds and starbursts onto dresses , worked as a bartender , a short-order cook and an electrician -- and hung_out on the fringes of New York ' s then-burgeoning punk scene . &quot; I had my hair cut_off and wore ripped T-shirts , &quot; recalls Smith , who plugged_away at her art when she wasn ' t at a day job . At the time she was making dolls and teapot cozies , life-size canoe sculptures and paintings of guitars . &quot; For a year I drew a pack of cigarettes to teach myself perspective. &quot; In 1979 Smith fell_in with a group of artists known as Colab ( short for Collaborative Projects ) that includes Robin Winters , Tom Otterness and Jane Dickson , and began to make body-related artworks that were included in group shows . With the death of her father the following year , the themes of death and the body became increasingly prominent in her work , and she embarked_on a course of research that included three months of emergency medical training in 1983 . &quot; I ' d been making things about the body that were totally subjective , and I thought it would be interesting to be in a situation where the agenda with the body was different , &quot; she says of the experience . &quot; What I discovered was that I basically wasn ' t interested in the physical healing of things . &quot; I also went_to some schools to look_at dead_bodies , but the more I did that , the more it distressed me . At first I was thrilled to get_to see what bodies really look_like , but then I began to be offended by the situation . Seeing people chopped_up with their brains pulled_out -- yes , it ' s interesting , and yes , I ' ve used it in my work , but still . . . we don ' t really know where consciousness resides . What parts could you lose and still think_of yourself as yourself ? &quot; With the AIDS epidemic gathering momentum during the ' 80s , the issue of mortality occupied an increasingly important role in art ; it became all but unavoidable for Smith in 1988 when her younger sister Bebe Smith died of the disease . ( Smith ' s other sister , Seton Smith -- Bebe ' s twin -- is also an artist and lives in Paris ) . &quot; AIDS has critically affected my life , and yes , I have done_work about it , but I don ' t like to think_of my work as being specifically about things , &quot; Smith says in response to the fact that the critique that has developed around her work often pivots on the AIDS epidemic . Reflecting on how she sees her work evolving , Smith says her interest in the body seems to have shifted &quot; from a fascination with the inside of the body and internal processes to the outside of the body. &quot; &quot; Having people accept my work has been really beneficial , and proved to me that a little bit of nurturing goes_a_long_way , &quot; she says . &quot; My earlier work was much cooler and relied conceptually on language -- I wanted to hide behind the idea that the work was about concepts as opposed to being about me . As I gain more confidence , I see my work becoming more true_to my real nature and growing increasingly decorative -- I ' ve always loved decorative things and see my work as residing somewhere between decorative art and fine_art . &quot; As to where it ' s going next , I don ' t know if I want to make work about the body for the rest of my life -- an artist ' s work is always changing , and I don ' t have any control over the way it changes . My work has always been super-autobiographical , and it ' s always the result of me trying to figure_out some question that ' s prominent in my mind -- I don ' t expect that to change . In fact , some pieces are so personal that it ' s hard for me to put them out into the world . I ' m a fairly secretive person in my intimate relationships with people , and the essential challenge of my work is that it forces me to expose myself . One of the things I keep learning from art is that it ' s OK to put yourself out there and trust life. &quot; Among the six new works included in the show at Santa Barbara ( the bulk of the exhibition is drawn from California collections ) is &quot; Untitled ( Roses ) , &quot; a life-size cast-aluminum figure of a woman with a thicket of roses blooming from her spine . &quot; I ' m terrified to show this work -- it ' s a highly sentimental piece about self-appreciation , &quot; Smith says , &quot; and it has to do with my belief that when a person is in_love with you , they give you space to bloom in . I wanted to make something overtly romantic , but because of the roses this piece feels really vulnerable . For the last few years I ' ve wanted to use flowers in my work , but artists tend to be punished for using flowers , probably because they ' ve come_to be associated with women . &quot; There ' s so_much deeply internalized hatred for women and for anything associated with the feminine in this society -- it ' s like this endless onion and you can just keep peeling back the layers of hatred . I ' m often amazed that when I really examine something dismissed as unimportant to us as a culture , it turns_out to be somehow associated with women . &quot; Women ' s bodies have always been given an eroticized depiction in art , &quot; she adds , elaborating further on her interpretation of the female form , &quot; but I don ' t present it that way , because unfortunately , that ' s not as big a part of my life as it should be . &quot; There ' s this mythical history of legions of women who lounge_around naked , and I wish I could do more of that , &quot; she says with a laugh , &quot; but I have to go feed the cat or do some work . So my work presents what I guess you could call a more realistic depiction of women ' s bodies in the world . &quot; That seems like a worthwhile thing to do too , because it seems to me that ideally , the way art should function in society is it should make more space for people ' s lives. &quot;</TEXT>
