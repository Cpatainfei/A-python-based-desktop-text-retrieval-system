   <TEXT> The powers that be can reconstruct Laguna Canyon Road into an expensive transition road from the eastern toll road to the San Joaquin Hills toll road , but they cannot reconstruct someone ' s brain . If a grown man wishes to race down the wrong side of Laguna Canyon Road at 80 m.p.h. in rush-hour traffic with his two children in the car , one without a seat_belt , an expensive new road is NOT going_to give him one single brain_cell .
