   <HEADLINE> WOMEN AND CHILDREN LAST ; NEXT TIME SHE ' LL BE DEAD : BATTERING AND HOW TO STOP IT , BY ANN JONES ( BEACON PRESS : $ 22 ; 288 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Count to 12 . Another woman has just been beaten by her spouse or lover or ex . Ann Jones , author previously of &quot; Women Who Kill , &quot; doesn ' t like the term domestic violence . In her new book , &quot; Next Time She ' ll Be Dead : Battering and How to Stop It , &quot; she describes it as &quot; one of those gray phrases , beloved of bureaucracy , designed to give people a way of talking_about a topic with out seeing what ' s really going on. &quot; What atrocities have been obfuscated by the euphemism domestic violence ? Here are a_few : assault , battery , rape , kidnaping , captivity . Torture and murder . These offenses ( except perhaps for rape ) , if committed on the streets by one man against another , or by a stranger upon a woman or child , in all likelihood would be vigorously prosecuted . But traditionally , a man ' s home is his castle , and what he does to his wife and children in the privacy of_his_own home is his own business . &quot; Written by men for men , &quot; Jones tells us , &quot; the law is designed to protect men from the power of the state and adjudicate conflicts between men , to preserve order in a society of men. &quot; Women and children first ? Not when it comes_to the right to live free from bodily harm . In media reports , should a case be so gruesome as_to merit the attention of the Fourth_Estate , women &quot; experience battering . They suffer abuse . They undergo assault . Rarely in the authoritative literature does a man hit a woman : in the gut , for instance , or the face , with his fist , hard -- hard enough to split her lip , loosen her teeth , break her nose , lace her eyeball with a red web of ruptured veins -- hard enough to make the blood run_down the page . In real_life it happens all_the time. &quot; The language of the reports themselves places blame for the attack on the victim , refusing even to acknowledge that there must have been someone on the scene to do the hitting , kicking , punching , spitting . The &quot; passive_voice of the journalists &quot; is but a reflection of another kind of passivity . The police stand idly by , often refusing to arrest when a man beats his wife or ex-wife , his girlfriend or ex-girlfriend . Even in localities that compel police_officers to do so by enacting mandatory arrest laws , there are cops who will face disciplinary action rather than arrest a man who is beating_up his wife . This sudden and highly unusual passivity on the part of the police is often reinforced by the courts , who will tell the bruised and battered woman standing before the bench asking_for a restraining order to go_home and try to work things out . Some judges just don ' t like the idea of breaking_up a family , even when husband is breaking his wife ' s bones . Jones tells us that &quot; . . . more_than half the women assaulted are injured , and at least 25 % of them seek medical treatment . Ten percent of the injured visit hospital emergency_rooms and many others visit private physicians to have their wounds dressed , their broken bones set , their injuries treated . . . . Of women requiring emergency surgery , one in five was battered , according to one study ; one in two , according to another . Battering accounts_for half of all cases of alcoholism in women . It accounts_for half of all rapes of women over the age 30 . . . . Battering is a cause of one-quarter of suicide attempts by all women , and one-half of suicide attempts by black_women . And the Journal of the American Medical Assn . reports : ' Approximately 37 % of obstetric patients , across class , race and educational lines , are physically abused while pregnant. ' Among the results : ' placental separation , antepartum hemorrhage , fetal fractures , rupture of the uterus , liver , or spleen , and pre-term labor. ' Pre-term labor , of course , may mean spontaneous_abortion or miscarriage. &quot; The carnage Jones documents in &quot; Next Time She ' ll Be Dead , &quot; and the lack of concern , not to mention assistance , on the part of those institutions that are supposedly in place to help battered women , are enough to make us lose hope . We learn that from 1967 to 1973 , &quot; battering men killed 17 # 500 women and children in the United States . To grasp the enormity of that figure consider that only a little more_than twice as_many men -- 39 # 000 to be exact -- were killed during the same period in combat in Vietnam . Thankfully the war in Vietnam ended , but the count of women injured and killed by men on the home front continues . In 1991 more_than 21 # 000 domestic assaults , rapes , and murders were reported to the police every week. &quot; But this is not simply a book of horrifying statistics . Jones introduces herself to us as the victim of an abusive , battering father . &quot; My father was a drunk , &quot; she says , &quot; a wife beater , and a child abuser . that ' s never the whole story of course , so he was also other things : a modestly successful businessman , a civic_leader , a war hero , an athlete , a prize-winning angler , a churchgoer , a tenor , a patriot , a Republican , a baseball fan , a formidable player of gin_rummy . And more important , a delightful and funny man . Of all my family , all now long gone , it ' s my father I miss. &quot; Though her righteous anger at the &quot; simplistic , regimented , confrontational , adversarial , and overly technical -- in a word , macho &quot; nature of the law and at those who only pretend to enforce it is present in every sentence , Jones does not seem to be writing for vengeance or out of any man-hating impulse . What she deplores is something many men also abhor : male violence against women and children , and the inertia that has infected each and every institution that could possibly do something to reduce that violence . Assumptions about the &quot; typical &quot; battered woman are many , fed to us by psychologists and sociologists trying to prove their theories or make quick money on a self-help book , and almost always wrong . All battered women are not passive . Most make multiple attempts to escape the men who are beating them ; they continue to try to get_away until they succeed or are killed by the men who &quot; love &quot; them to death . Jones draws an important distinction between passivity and powerlessness . &quot; Powerlessness is a political condition , while passivity is a strategy adopted by the powerless to survive. &quot; Not all battered women lack jobs or education : Battering cuts a swath across socioeconomic lines . The sole characteristic battered women share is that they are women . And what of the batterers ? Are they , as they and many psychologists claim , victims of_their_own lack of control ? Willing , but unable to stop themselves ? Jones tells us &quot; it ' s vital to understand that battering is not a series of isolated blow-ups . It is a process of deliberate intimidation intended to coerce the victim to do the will of the victimizer . The batterer is not just losing his temper , not just suffering from stress , not just manifesting ' insecurity. ' . . . These are excuses for the violence . . . . Batterers can be perfectly agreeable , straightforward , or conciliatory to police_officers , bosses , neighbors , co-workers , or friends when they think it ' s in their best interests . . . . No , the violent man is not out of control . He is a man at_work on_his_own agenda , which is to train ' his ' woman to be what he wants her to be , and only what he wants her to be , all_the time. &quot; If there is no set of psychological characteristics which predestines a woman to a life of being battered , and no set from which the &quot; experts &quot; might properly determine which boys will grow_up to be batterers , what are we to make of all_the male violence being heaped on women ? Jones asks , &quot; Could it be that battered women have some function , some role or social utility we haven ' t taken_into_account ? . . . What are battered women for ? &quot; Battered women , she concludes , &quot; are to sexism what the poor are to capitalism -- always with us . They are a source of cheap labor and sexual service to those with the power to buy and control them , a ' problem ' for the righteous to lament , a topic to provide employment for academic researchers , a sponge to soak_up the surplus violence of men , a conduit to carry_off the political energy of other women who must care_for them , an exemplum of what awaits all women who don ' t behave as prescribed , and a pariah group to amplify by contrast our good opinion of ourselves . And for all their social utility , they remain largely , and conveniently , invisible. &quot; There are suggestions , in the final chapter , for reducing or even , ideally , ending the violence , for doing_away_with battered women not by ignoring their plight until the men who love them shoot them or stab them or bludgeon them to death , but by making changes in policy and in judgment that include new legislation , education of health_care professionals , clergy , and teachers , and money for the shelter network . Print and broadcast journalists should lose the &quot; sexist cliches , &quot; stop talking_about the spurned lovers , fits of rage and despair . Look_at it objectively . A man beat a woman . that ' s assault_and_battery . Arrest him and prosecute him and hope the court gives him jail time . Take_a_look at our priorities . The Federal Bureau of Prisons admits that 95 % of its prisoners are nonviolent . Get them into alternative punishment programs and make room for the men who are beating , maiming and killing women . Another good way to free up prison_cells to make room for the violent would be to release the thousands of women who are currently locked_up because the police and the courts and the doctors and the clergy left them , alone and terrified , to defend themselves against men who were trying to kill them .</TEXT>
