   <TEXT> Trim and tan , polished and polite , former South_African secret_agent and commando Eeben Barlow is the very model of a modern mercenary . At 38 , he heads Executive Outcomes , a multimillion-dollar corporation that employs 500 or so fellow soldiers_of_fortune , including a motley crew of former assassins , spies , saboteurs and scoundrels . They hail from half_a_dozen nations and are veterans of combat around the globe . Most fought in losing battles to save colonial reigns and racist regimes in countries such_as Congo , Kenya , Rhodesia ( now Zimbabwe ) and especially South_Africa . Many worked for apartheid ' s most sinister security_forces . But this is no ordinary band of rogues . &quot; We are dynamic , professional and work to achieve success , &quot; Barlow explained at his bush headquarters here , a former Cuban air_base . &quot; We are profit-driven , and our profit depends_on the satisfaction of the client. &quot; The company logo -- emblazoned on calling cards , not to mention tie_tacks and cuff links -- is a paladin , the same chess knight featured on the old TV series &quot; Have Gun , Will Travel. &quot; These hired guns have traveled_to what the United Nations has called the world ' s deadliest war . Now , under their second $ 20-million contract from the Angolan government , Barlow ' s men have spent 14 months helping to train a ragtag army of conscripts , and they plan and coordinate fighting in key battles . Even their critics concede that the self-described &quot; military consultants &quot; have helped the long-beleaguered government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos gain territory and a decided advantage in the long , bitter war against Jonas Savimbi ' s rebel UNITA movement . Other factors were also critical . Independent analysts say UNITA has been hard pressed by an international arms and oil embargo and the loss of lucrative diamond-producing areas , which paid_for the war effort . The result is that the rebels are increasingly on the ropes . &quot; There ' s no doubt FAA ( Forcas Armadas de Angolanas , the government army ) has the upper_hand now , &quot; said Yvon Madore , a senior U.N. official in Luanda , the refugee-clogged capital . &quot; UNITA has lost momentum. &quot; That explains why the government and UNITA may sign a U.N.-brokered peace pact next month after almost a year of stormy talks in neighboring Zambia . It calls_for demobilization of combatants , U.N. peacekeeping troops and ultimately a government based on power-sharing . But many doubt that the &quot; Lusaka Accord &quot; will bring lasting peace -- or even a cease-fire -- in a 19-year-old war that the world has largely forgotten . UNITA , the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola , now controls about a third of the countryside , less than half what it held a year ago . It has signed peace pacts before but used the time to resupply and regroup forces . In 1992 , Savimbi even ran in U.N.-supervised elections . When he lost , he cried fraud and resumed the war with a vengeance . But for the first time , the Dos Santos government is in a position of strength . It has international legitimacy from winning democratic elections , plus an estimated $ 2 billion in new arms and equipment . The air_force , now able to bomb at night , controls the skies . Morale has improved . As a result , government hard-liners insist that Savimbi can now be beaten , or at least pushed_back to the bush . They want to force UNITA from diamond-producing areas and cut its supply_lines to Zaire . Heavy fighting along the border last week after months of calm suggests that the hawks are getting their way . &quot; Why should the government share power if they can beat them militarily ? &quot; asked Mike McDonagh , country director for the_Irish aid group Concern . Government troops are entrenched about 30 miles outside of Savimbi ' s last urban stronghold , the central highlands city of Huambo , and slowly closing_in from three sides . Losing Huambo would be a decisive defeat for UNITA , which captured the battered city last year after a fierce 55-day siege . As always , civilians have borne the brunt . The United Nations estimated last year that up_to 1 # 000 Angolans were dying each day of war-related wounds , hunger and disease . Aid officials say the toll probably has not fallen much . They say one-third of the population of 11 million is directly affected by the war . Until recently , aid groups and the United Nations were unable to fly badly needed food and medicine to most major cities because of fighting or other problems . Kuito , where an estimated 25 # 000 people died last year , was especially hard hit . Relief flights , stopped since May , resumed only in mid-October . &quot; The problem now is a lot of bodies are buried in people ' s gardens , &quot; said Sarah Longford , spokeswoman for the U.N. Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Unit in Luanda . &quot; When the rains come , there will be a real health risk. &quot; Angola is potentially one of Africa ' s wealthiest countries . It is a fertile land rich with oil and diamonds . But millions of land_mines still in the soil will ensure heavy casualties for years to come . Barlow planted at least some of those mines . Trained as a combat engineer , he rose through the ranks of the &quot; 32 Battalion , &quot; an infamous force of black troops led by white South_African commandos deployed in Angola in the 1980s . Many of Barlow ' s current colleagues fought under him then , although he insists that none were involved in the battalion ' s reported atrocities . The irony is they fought on behalf of UNITA -- the group that is now their enemy . Barlow speaks poorly of his former comrades in arms . &quot; We could never understand why we had an ally like UNITA , &quot; he said . &quot; They stole our equipment . . . . And they would n ' t fight. &quot; But UNITA was anti-Communist and heavily backed by Washington , as well as Pretoria . On the other side , Cuba sent 50 # 000 troops and the Soviet_Union shipped supplies to prop_up the then-Marxist Angolan government in Luanda . The Cold_War ended , but unfortunately , the proxy war did not . In 1983 , Barlow said , he joined South_Africa ' s Directorate of Covert Collection , one of the apartheid regime ' s most infamous security units . &quot; I was responsible_for espionage operations against so-called ' front-line ' states , &quot; the black-ruled countries around South_Africa that led the campaign against apartheid . After six years , he said , he moved to the Civil Cooperation Bureau . Run_by the military , the innocent-sounding group ran death squads against political foes . Barlow said only that he headed a five-man cell that set_up front companies in Cyprus and seven other countries . that ' s when he formed Executive Outcomes in Pretoria . So when the Civil Cooperation Bureau closed_in 1991 , he began selling &quot; specialist security services &quot; across Africa , offering everything from espionage to encryption . Angola ' s oil_company hired them to protect its huge coastal facility at the town of Soyo . And that , in turn , led to a unique offer last year to restructure and retrain Angola ' s military . The company ' s military commander , former South_African Lt . Col . Nick van der Bergh , promoted himself to brigadier . Applications came from as far away as Germany and Australia , drawn_in part by monthly salaries ranging from $ 2 # 500 to $ 10 # 000 . Some cited service with legendary Irish mercenary Michael ( Mad Mike ) Hoare , who once tried to take_over the Seychelles . A helicopter pilot who listed his work as &quot; shooting Tamils out of trees &quot; in Sri Lanka . A father who enlisted with his son and boasted he ' d never lost a war . &quot; I always killed someone , &quot; he said . Today , Executive Outcomes works from three major bases in Angola . The largest and closest to the front is at Saurimo , a provincial_capital now surrounded by UNITA forces . Most of the company ' s 15 killed or captured employees in Angola were working there . Flying the firm ' s chartered Boeing 727 into Saurimo last week , the pilot opted for caution . &quot; we ' ll fly a left spiral down , &quot; he announced cheerfully . &quot; Nothing to be alarmed about . Just a precaution against SAMs , Stingers and other heat-seeking_missiles . . . . Hope you enjoy the flight. &quot; With that , he cut power to the engines and the jet dropped from the sky , cork-screwing from 17 # 500 feet at a gut-wrenching angle to a runway lined with shot-up planes and bombed-out buildings . No missiles were fired . The company ' s other major training area is at Longa , 125 miles south of Luanda , along a crocodile-infested river inside a national_park . Monkeys scamper in branches overhead , scorpions race over the dirt , and malaria is endemic . About 100 trainers live_in tents there , and on a recent muggy morning they reviewed several hundred fresh Angolan conscripts . Most of the new troops wore only rags , some were barefoot ; they drilled with sticks for weapons . They will be issued guns and uniforms after several months of training . Out on a dusty field , however , Wynand du Toit had organized a display by newly trained Angolan special forces . It was not a good_day . They failed twice to detonate a string of explosives that Du Toit had explained was &quot; good for destroying a car park. &quot; An instructor finally set the charge . Next , a 10-man squad spoiled a mock assault when they fired their AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades into the ground as they ran , rather than at a target . But the final exercise went_off without a hitch . Du Toit , 36 , is perhaps South_Africa ' s best-known soldier . He spent 2 1 / 2 years in a Luanda military jail after he was captured trying to destroy an Angolan oil facility in 1985 . Shot in the neck , he almost died in prison and came_home a war hero . Burly and bearded , he said it felt &quot; funny &quot; to return to Angola to work for those who almost killed him . But he insisted that he has no regrets : &quot; I feel liberated . I don ' t work for any political_party . I don ' t work for any government. &quot; that ' s the problem , say critics in South_Africa ' s new government . Rusty Evans , director general of the Department of Foreign Affairs , has condemned Executive Outcomes as mercenaries and a &quot; dangerous , criminal and destructive force in Africa. &quot; Not so , Barlow said . &quot; We are a stabilizing force and we have broken no laws. &quot; And he hates being called a mercenary . His men don ' t fight , loot or maraud , he insisted . &quot; We are military advisers. &quot; But that may be a matter of semantics . About 100 &quot; advisers &quot; were in the attacking column of 1 # 500 Angolan troops when they captured Cafunfo , center of the diamond trade_in the north , in July after a six-week offensive . By then , UNITA had fled . One South_African , who roared into Cafunfo on a tank , smiled as he recalled the victory -- and the party that followed . &quot; We plundered the town , &quot; he said . His only regret , he added , was that he and his friends got too drunk to find any diamonds .</TEXT>
