   <TEXT> Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott , a smokers ' rights advocate , has launched a campaign to make smoking legal again in the city ' s Riverfront Stadium . Schott has disobeyed the city ' s no-smoking ordinance by smoking in her seat . The city has scheduled a hearing for her appeal . All major_league stadiums but one -- New York ' s Shea Stadium -- have smoking restrictions . Schott says the Riverfront smoking law is a reason the first-place Reds are having an attendance decline this season . Meanwhile , it was announced that Schott has been chosen grand marshal of the Ohio Tobacco Festival ' s Aug . 26 parade in Ripley , Ohio . Trivia time : Name the only major_league pitcher whose strikeouts and age , in one game , were the same ?

Media boycott ? From John Steigerwald , in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , before the recent ceremonies at Cooperstown , N.Y. : &quot; ( Steve ) Carlton will be inducted into the Baseball Hall_of_Fame this weekend . It would be fitting if the media walked_out during his acceptance speech . &quot; The more you hear what Steve has been saying lately , the more you realize how fortunate America was that he refused to speak_to the media all those years. &quot; Instant star : Triple-A Vancouver Manager Don Long , who joined the Angel coaching staff for a week , was excited when he heard a fan recognize him . Long acknowledged him and started to walk over to autograph a baseball , when the kid holding it yelled : &quot; Could you go get Bo Jackson ' s autograph for me ? &quot; Said Long : &quot; I should have known. &quot; Babe seminar : Hofstra University , which has held numerous symposiums on U.S. presidents , is organizing one for Babe_Ruth . Ruth ' s life will be the focus of a history conference next April , celebrating the 100th year since his birth . Hundreds of historians , journalists and baseball experts are expected to attend . Fare deal : Fred Perry , the 1934 , ' 35 and ' 36 Wimbledon champion , was honored on his 85th birthday during the recent Wimbledon tournament . Said Perry , after receiving awards and accolades : &quot; If there is anything I can do to help the game anywhere in the world , I am happy to do so . . . provided you pay the fare. &quot; Trivia answer : Bob Feller , 18 , when he struck_out 18 Detroit Tigers on Oct . 2 , 1938 .
