   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : ITALY ; INN-TO-INN TREKKING IN THE DOLOMITE ALPS , NEAR THE AUSTRIAN BORDER , GIVES_RISE TO AN ECLECTIC ITINERARY OF RUGGED WALKS AND GOURMET MEALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We were sitting in the Piazza Walther , eating pasta with beer . Our waiter greeted us with buon giorno while the busboy wished us a guten tag . Welcome to the town of Bolzano in the Alto Adige , Italy ' s northernmost province . Bolzano is situated at the foot of the Dolomites , the Eastern Italian Alps , which rise from the Venetian Plain about 100 miles north of Venice , and separate Italy from Austria . We were in Italy , but not the Italy of terra_cotta tile_roofs or ocher stucco walls . The notion of a Mediterranean Italy is so ingrained , it was hard at first to grasp this place , its gloomy arched portals leading out_to pale blue and yellow stucco walls embroidered with lacy rococo arabesques . But border cultures have their own seductions , and it would become apparent in no time that this blend of Italian and Austrian was no different , with food , language and custom all its own . Even the mountains are a fusion of rock found nowhere else in Europe . Spectral battlements in the morning mist , fluted crowns reflecting pink by the late afternoon , they combine gray dolomitic limestone ( named for its 18th-Century French discoverer , Deodat de Dolomieu ) and dark brown volcanic_rock in the plateaus . They tend to erase any lingering nostalgia for the Italy of the south . The mountains , I reminded myself , were the main reason we had come here to a place we had barely heard of to join 15 strangers on a weeklong hiking trip . Other aspects of the trip had some importance . We were going_with Butterfield &amp; Robinson , the Toronto-based touring company well known to a certain brand of sybarites who enjoy the idea of several hours of biking or walking in between sustained bouts of eating and drinking . From a previous biking trip with B &amp; R , to Provence , we knew they also understood how to make group travel appeal_to group-travelphobes . There was no artificial intimacy force-fed by relentlessly chipper guides . We suffered through no singing of &quot; Auld Lang Syne. &quot; Instead , the guides had encouraged people to get_up when they pleased and go at their own pace . Ranging_in age from 45 to 65 , we were business and professional people from Minnesota , Kentucky , Florida , Texas and California . We were not all made_for each other , but we managed a shipboard camaraderie . After meeting over drinks on the veranda of a Bolzano hotel , we boarded a bus for the two-hour ride to the mountain hamlet of Corvara in Badia . Sloping down a broad , green valley bracketed by huge mountains , Corvara was typical of towns we would see . Each had a doll-sized stucco church with slender onion-domed campanile , houses of whitewashed stucco and unpainted wood , and window_boxes full of neatly pruned red and pink hanging_geraniums . Ski chalets and quaint woodcarvers ' shops were everywhere -- Gepetto and Pinocchio could have stepped_out of any of them . We would spend two nights at a local hotel , take an exploratory day hike and then move_on , by foot , to our next destination . The pattern would be repeated at each of our four hotels with one exception . We spent just one night at a rough hewn rifugio high in the mountains , where some of us , or at least my husband , could happily have spent the summer . * Our first night in Corvara was a festive one , begun with a hearty , eclectic meal of South Tyrolean and North Italian cuisine -- risotto followed by pigs ' knuckles topped_off by the boiled custard and meringue desert known as floating island . Much beer and wine . Toward the end of the evening , Signor Costa , the hotel owner , and his sons regaled us with local songs -- yodeled with virtuoso vocal agility in Ladin , a Latin-derived Romansch language still preferred in much of the region to the Italian and German also spoken by most natives . Their accompaniment was a Spike Jones-like instrument called a violina del diavolo , or devil ' s violin ; a stringed post with knots carved into gnarled faces , and an attached tambourine . The first full-day hike turned_out to be a thriller . After the threat of rain and fog caused our two leaders to scrap the planned itinerary , a local mountain guide was recruited to take us on what was supposed to be an easier route . Maurizio , the guide , proved to be the soul of Alpine cheer and competence , even if his idea of easy was open_to question . After a chairlift ride and a short climb through a piney thicket , we were out on the vast , open Pralongia plateau , surrounded in the far distance by a seemingly unbroken wall of chiseled gray cliffs . By mid-afternoon , the group was strung out_in an ever-lengthening line of trekkers along a narrow path at the base of two craggy peaks . We made our way across the skirt with teetering , deliberate steps over wobbly boulders and scree , always looking over the immense valley miles below . Rounding the end of the massif , we descended into trees and meadows , then climbed again . A trickling waterfall was our staircase , leading_up to a wide marsh and the end of the trail . Just as daylight was fading , we watched rain_clouds gather over the ghost of a World_War I barracks at Valparola , the scene of some of the fiercest fighting between the Italians and Austrians . Back at our hotel , another sumptuous dinner -- quail , venison and apple crisp with honey ice_cream -- did not allay altogether the anxiety of the day ' s trek . Our sub-group of eight had been exhilarated by the adventure . Others had been a little frightened . In particular , other members of the group had not enjoyed negotiating a hand-over-hand ascent of a waterfall , even a miniature one , in semi-darkness . We were about to become two groups , and while our two handlers weren ' t keen on the idea of leading a divided expedition , they rose graciously to the challenge . The two guides also made_sure there was time for a little independent exploration of the towns where we stayed . You didn ' t have to go_far to find a lot . One morning , I slipped next door to the hotel to explore a small , white church I had barely noticed almost hidden behind a high wall . Although I wasn ' t expecting a treasure in such a remote and unassuming place , I had learned not to trust the perfunctory treatment given these towns in even the best guidebooks . While in Bolzano , we had stumbled onto the Gothic parish church , and were surprised to find a wealth of late medieval and early Renaissance altarpieces . In addition to altarpieces , the 15th-Century church in Corvara was surrounded by a military cemetery with a forest of crosses formed out_of_wrought iron into twining tendrils over every grave , whose plots were well-tended flower beds ablaze with color . The next day , an easy morning walk took us along another part of the Pralongia plateau , with the chalky mountains always looming on the horizon , and then down into a field dotted with dark log_cabins . Called baitas , these cabins serve to provide minimal shelter , normally for ski outings , and a shamefully picturesque setting for a walk . We were looking_for the baita with the terrace and smoking grill . Spread_out in front of the baita was an hors d ' oeuvres table laden with regional specialties , including various cheeses and sandwiches made with speck , a ham similar to prosciutto , but thicker and saltier -- Austrian in name and flavor . To balance the northern food , our aperitif was the more Italian Tirola , a mixture of white_wine and Campari . Then we sat_down at picnic tables on the deck for the main meal and watched as enormous vats of risotto with porcini , just in season , were stirred patiently , then ladled steaming , into big , white bowls . That tour_de_force was followed by barbecued chicken , sausages and ribs , then apple_fritters fried before our eyes in another vat and chased down by grappa and coffee . On our third day out , a three-hour morning hike led us to a high , wind-swept plateau that is the site of the pilgrimage shrine of Santa Croce , a simple 16th-Century church with interior frescoes and a wall of flickering votive candles . At intervals along the misty forested path to the church , each of the 14 Stations of the Cross is commemorated in a vitrine , a small case mounted on a stake , with a scene inside , either carved or painted in differing folk styles . Making their way down from the shrine were solemn processions of pilgrims praying aloud as they passed . Like noisy tourists barging_in on a high_Mass , we were awed and silenced . Our planned route from San Cassiano to the Rifugio Fanes , at 6 # 798 feet the highest , most remote spot on our itinerary , circumnavigated the massif called Sasso della Croce , making use of the van to get_to a chairlift , then to the trail . Our group of eight , fueled the night before by the local wine and an inspirational slide show on mountaineering , decided to tackle a more challenging route . The guides submitted our plan to Maurizio , who assured them that while strenuous , the trek was manageable . Starting early the next morning from the chairlift , at 6 # 072 feet , we ambled through farmland and cow pastures , lulled into a relaxed state of confidence while stopping for lunch in a rolling meadow dotted with purple gentian . But soon the woods gave_way to a scrubby stretch that opened into the immense and barren Passo San Antonio above the tree_line . Hardly visible high above was a saddle atop a loose , gravelly trail that clung for a very long_time to the side of a precipitous drop-off , then accelerated its angle toward the vertical as it snaked up_to the summit , at 8 # 138 feet . A couple of hours later , when , one by one , we had all peered over the other side , all_the strain and struggle fell_away as we took_in the rocky meadows below punctuated by miniature turquoise lakes and ancient low stone_walls defining the ridges , our rifugio barely in_sight miles away . We made a grand gesture of drinking the searing cold and sweet water of a clear stream ( when was the last time it was safe to drink from a stream in the New World ? ) , as we reached the last meadow to be traversed . Marching to the deck of the rifugio as the sun was beginning to set , we were greeted with cheers and champagne toasts by the others , who had passed the binoculars to monitor our entire descent . A rustic rifugio is exactly where one should stay after such a day . Its unpainted wood and stone structure , beds with down comforters flanking a window and framing a view of our trail , communal showers way down the hall , and boisterous dining_room filled with the singing of local revelers , seemed the only fitting end . * In contrast to the relentless thrills and strain of the previous days , the walk down from Fanes to the chic ski town of Cortina d ' Ampezzo through the Parco Naturale provided the week ' s most docile beauty of lakes , pale ice-blue rivers , tranquil woods and dappled sunlight . We stayed in the quietly elegant Hotel de la Poste in this larger , more cosmopolitan town ( pop . 8 # 500 ) in which it was easy to fall_into the local pattern , ordering gin_and_tonics at sunset on the tiny outdoor terrace in front of the hotel , from which we watched life go_by around the piazza . The final dinner is a company ritual . Ours was a sumptuous debauchery consisting_of a succession of dishes of escalating richness -- ravioli , tagliatelle , duck with chanterelles , pancetta and liver , beef and polenta and countless regional wines . Ski pins were handed_out as awards in several categories for special distinctions -- stupid trail decisions , for example -- and toasts offered with high spirits and heartfelt appreciation . The most hard-boiled member of the group -- a grouchy , debonair and funny former investment_banker -- gave a touching one to the making of friends . We were only minutes away from &quot; Auld Lang Syne. &quot; GUIDEBOOK / Dolomite Directions Getting there : Milan is the closest international airport with good rail connections .
