   <HEADLINE> MAN ARRESTED IN ATTACK ON ICE-SKATER KERRIGAN ; CRIME : NEWS_REPORTS SAY HE CONFESSED INVOLVEMENT . WARRANTS ARE ISSUED FOR AT LEAST TWO MORE PEOPLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Arrest_warrants were issued Thursday in the attack on Olympic figure_skating star Nancy Kerrigan and one man was taken into custody , authorities said . The FBI arrested the suspect at Portland ( Ore. ) Airport on a flight from Phoenix , but Doug Roberts , Port of Portland spokesman , refused to give any details about the man . Local news_reports identified him as Derrick Smith of Phoenix , and described him as the second man to confess his involvement in the alleged conspiracy to injure Kerrigan , 24 , of Stoneham , Mass . Earlier , Harding ' s bodyguard , Shawn Eric Eckardt , was said to have acknowledged a role in the attack . ABC news named a Portland man , Shane Stant , as suspected of being the attacker who hit Kerrigan in the leg Jan . 6 . at the U.S. Figure_Skating Championships in Detroit . The assailant escaped . Deputy Police_Chief Benny Napoleon in Detroit acknowledged that warrants had been issued but did not specify the number or who had been named in them . Sources familiar_with the investigation told The Times that Portland authorities expected to arrest two more men later Thursday . The plot reportedly involved Tonya Harding ' s ex-husband , Jeff Gillooly , Eckardt , and several others . Earlier Thursday , Boston television_station WCVB reported that warrants were issued in Portland for Eckardt , Smith and Stant . The station also reported Harding was named in the warrants , but authorities denied that . Harding , 23 , won the U.S. Figure_Skating Championships last week after her chief rival , Kerrigan , was forced to withdraw because of the leg injury suffered in the attack . Harding has denied any link to the assault , calling the allegations ludicrous . &quot; You guys know me better than that , &quot; Harding said earlier this week . &quot; I had my hopes for a long_time of competing against Nancy and proving I ' m as_good_as her and better. &quot; Harding and Gillooly were divorced Aug . 28 , according to Columbia County court documents , but they later reconciled and have lived together since October . The latest developments led investigators to three states -- Michigan , Oregon and Arizona -- in an effort to break the case . Eckardt , the bodyguard , told authorities that Gillooly asked him to arrange last week ' s attack , unidentified law_enforcement sources said . The suspects were expected to be arrested for conspiracy to commit an assault , a felony punishable by up_to 10 years in prison and a $ 100 # 000 fine . Although Kerrigan , the 1992 bronze medal_winner in Albertville , France , and the favorite to win the gold in Lillehammer , Norway , next month , could not compete last week , she was later added_to the U.S. Olympic team . She and Harding will represent the United States . Kerrigan ' s injured right knee showed improvement after two days of physical_therapy , Dr. Mahlon Bradley said in Boston . At the Detroit news_conference , Napoleon said a woman from out of state called the Police_Department on Saturday and insisted on speaking with him . Napoleon said the woman indicated that she heard a conversation regarding the planned assault on Kerrigan several months ago . Napoleon said the woman identified about four people , and he gave the names to the FBI . The woman said she listened to a tape of the conversation a_few months ago . The plot allegedly involved Eckardt , Gillooly , an Eckardt acquaintance in Phoenix and a Portland man who attacked Kerrigan for $ 100 # 000 . Detroit police said they recovered a collapsible metal baton , believed to be the weapon . A Detroit resident found it in a trash_can behind the arena , police said . Harvey Schiller , executive_director of the U.S. Olympic Committee , said Harding ' s participation in the Olympics would not be affected because &quot; there ' s no indication that Tonya ' s involved at all. &quot; The U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . in Colorado Springs issued a statement saying it would not comment on speculation about the investigation . Times staff writer Ronald J . Ostrow contributed to this story .</TEXT>
