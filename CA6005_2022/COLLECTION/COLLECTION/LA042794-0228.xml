   <HEADLINE> SMOKE SIGNALS ; ACTIVISTS SOUND AN ALARM ABOUT YOUR WOMEN , MEDIA IMAGES AND TOBACCO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the next few years , Lisa , a 17-year-old high_school junior , will confront a series of milestones . In four years , she ' ll be able to walk into a bar and drink . In just a year , she ' ll be able to vote . And when she reaches that magic age of 18 , Lisa will also be able to buy cigarettes legally . Of course , that particular rite of passage doesn ' t mean much -- Lisa ' s been smoking since she was 12 . &quot; I know how terrible it is , &quot; she says emphatically . &quot; I saw on some ( TV ) show all_the stuff they put_in it . It ' s terrible . They ' re death sticks. &quot; But the looming possibility of chronic heart and lung disease is not enough to get Lisa , who asked that her real name not be used , to stop . Nor is the fact that her grandfather is in the hospital dying of lung_cancer . Or that her father -- a surgeon -- offered her $ 10 # 000 to quit . Says Lisa : &quot; You can ' t quit till you ' re ready. &quot; Lisa ' s habit is shared by hundreds of thousands of girls nationwide who are spending their pre-adult years up in smoke . And that is alarming anti-smoking groups who don ' t want to see girls -- and young_women -- succumb to pressure from tobacco companies , media images or their peers . The anti-smoking camp sees_red flags everywhere . One recent research report revealed that teen-age smoking in_general is_on the rise . Another found a link between cigarette advertising and smoking among teen-age girls . And still another suggests that women are more susceptible to lung_cancer than men . Watch-dog groups complain about recent portrayals of smoking in a variety of media . The already besieged Camel ad_campaign , featuring the cartoon character Joe Camel , has come under more fire for featuring female Camels for the first time . Ads with beautiful , slim models touting thin cigarettes remain a focus of criticism . Even the popular movie &quot; Reality Bites &quot; has become a target because its young heroine , played by Winona Ryder , is a smoker . Of course , teen-age girls and young_women aren ' t the only concerns of health officials and anti-smoking camps -- they ' re concerned about everyone who might be susceptible to positive images of smoking . But they are worried that when it comes_to young_women , tobacco companies are becoming more savvy about which buttons to push . And advertising , together with other influences , can make_for a potent lure . &quot; I think the powerful themes that the ( tobacco ) industry has used have been women ' s liberation , empowerment and the whole appeal_to thinness , &quot; says research scientist Lloyd Johnston of the University of Michigan , who led a study of drug and tobacco use among high schoolers . &quot; Most of the women ' s cigarettes are long and thin , the packs are long and thin , and the models are exceptionally long and thin . . . . Clearly there are different messages sent to the two sexes . For women , it ' s thinness and elegance and being liberated . For males , it ' s much more the macho or cool kind of image , self-contained , like the Marlboro man. &quot; The issue of young people and smoking has long fueled a volatile debate between anti-smokers and the tobacco companies . &quot; This is the first Camel ad that has these camel-ish-looking twiggy women cavorting in a nightclub , where the whole theme is ' Light Up the Night , ' &quot; says Dr. Sidney Wolfe , director of the Washington , D.C.-based Public Citizen ' s Health Research Group , the Ralph Nader-founded medical watchdog organization . &quot; The idea is to lure young , impressionable teen-agers who want to look sexy and be socially accepted , and this is just the ticket for them. &quot; The tobacco companies deny the allegations . &quot; ( We ) developed this campaign to change what had become adults ' perception that Camel was a tired , old brand that their grandfather smoked , &quot; says Peggy Carter , a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds , manufacturers of Camels . &quot; We have , as with any ad_campaign , tried to stay_fresh with the audience to whom it ' s directed , which in our case is adult smokers. &quot; * Clare van de Mark , 15 , started_out as a &quot; social smoker , &quot; having an occasional cigarette with friends . &quot; Then I just started smoking whenever . It wasn ' t like peer pressure . I was around it so_much , it just grows on you . &quot; My friends didn ' t even want me to start smoking , &quot; says the 10th-grader , who describes herself as a B-average student and &quot; serious about my education. &quot; &quot; When I ' d ask my ( older ) friends to buy me cigarettes they ' d say , ' You ' re too young to smoke. ' But it was OK if they smoked . They were kind of protective . &quot; One of my friends quit and that was fine , &quot; adds Clare , who lives_in the San Fernando Valley . &quot; We all supported her , it was no big deal . &quot; It ' s not even cool anymore , &quot; she admits . &quot; It ' s looked down upon in society . It ' s not even trendy anymore. &quot; But smoking does seem to be picking_up among high schoolers , according to a 1994 report from the University of Michigan . Scientists , led by Lloyd Johnston at the school ' s Institute for Social Research , found that although smoking rates had been steady for nearly a decade , they ' ve increased about 2 % in the past year for high_school students . Says Johnston : &quot; I do think that the massive ads for cigarettes are effective in getting young people to start smoking. &quot; And even if most young_women ' s magazines , such_as Seventeen and Sassy , don ' t carry tobacco ads , he says , teen-agers will see them while looking through Mademoiselle , Vogue and Cosmo . A strong link between cigarette smoking and advertising was recently reported in the Journal of the American Medical Assn . Researchers found that about 1967 , there was a marked increase in girls 17 and younger starting to smoke -- the same time cigarette ads targeted to women began to appear . The numbers peaked about 1973 , declining as information about the harmful effects of smoking was pumped at the masses . But the study is considered significant for discovering a correlation between gender-specific ads and smoking . The tobacco companies have long denied that they ' re chasing after the youth market . They cite statistics saying that advertising doesn ' t encourage teen-agers to start smoking , such_as a 1992 Journal of School Health report stating that the major reasons for 10th-graders beginning to smoke were curiosity , social norms and peer pressure -- not advertising . Says Carter of R.J. Reynolds : &quot; To direct ( the Joe Camel campaign ) at a youth market would indeed be the dumbest thing we could do. &quot; Says Karen Daragan of Philip Morris , makers of Virginia Slims , &quot; Not only do we not market toward teens , but advertising and promotion is not effective in influencing people to smoke . It can help people choose a brand if they already smoke , and it can enhance brand recognition. &quot; But what about such brands as Virginia Slims , Capri and Misty that use powerful images of young , thin , attractive , vibrant women ? An ad for Capri Ultra Lights says they ' re &quot; the super slim that ' s surprisingly rich. &quot; And Misty cigarettes are &quot; fashionably inexpensive. &quot; Tobacco company marketing campaigns go beyond selling cigarettes . Virginia Slims has its V-Wear catalogue of chic clothes ( leather jackets , vests ) that can be bought only with proofs-of-purchase ( Daragan says the items are available to smokers 21 or older , and participants must sign a form stating that ) . The brand also sponsors tennis tournaments . Linda Sarna , a registered nurse and assistant_professor at UCLA ' s School_of_Nursing , takes these ads to task for emphasizing glamour and slimness . The images become &quot; insidious . It ' s part of the fabric of our society and it ' s difficult to escape. &quot; And it doesn ' t help , she adds , that many young_women view smoking as a way to stay thin and fear that if they stop , they ' ll gain an enormous amount of weight . &quot; I see the public ' s general thinking is that the lower weight is a better health advantage than not smoking. &quot; * For Lisa , who smokes Marlboros , cigarette ads are &quot; just another page in the magazine. &quot; &quot; I saw another thing on TV about how Camel cigarettes are attractive to teens . . . maybe that ' s true for younger kids , but not for my friends. &quot; Since she started smoking , she has found few obstacles in buying cigarettes from neighborhood liquor and convenience_stores . &quot; We had this 18-year-old live-in baby-sitter from Australia . She smoked , and I thought she was the coolest thing -- I even dressed like her . One day I asked her for a cigarette -- she just gave it to me . I used to sneak into her room to smoke . She left a year later , and by that time I was smoking. &quot; Lisa ' s father &quot; flipped out &quot; when Lisa told him . &quot; My mother , who smokes occasionally , didn ' t believe me until I pulled_out a pack of cigarettes from my purse and smoked it . She goes , ' Oh my God , ' and that ' s all she really said. &quot; But her parents still encourage her to stop -- witness the ten grand cash offer . &quot; I know what happens from smoking , &quot; says Lisa , who lives_in Los Angeles . &quot; My dad has taken me to the hospital and shown me pictures of lungs from people who have smoked . And I saw my grandfather in the hospital hooked_up to all these machines . But the only time I see myself quitting is when I plan to have children , and that ' s not going_to be for a while . I ' m addicted. &quot; And that ' s why anti-smoking groups aren ' t just attacking advertising . They are also scrutinizing smoking on television and in movies . Their latest target is the film &quot; Reality Bites &quot; -- specifically , the Winona Ryder character , a new college grad and neophyte video director who smokes up a storm throughout the film . &quot; Let ' s think_about the larger message , &quot; says Susan Swimmer , fitness , food and features editor of Seventeen magazine . &quot; I ' m in no way suggesting some form of censorship , but I think those of us who are sending a larger message have a responsibility . She could have smoked five cigarettes ( Swimmer counted 15 smoking scenes ) . I think they went a little overboard . I ' m not saying smokers don ' t exist , but it would be as believable to not have them smoke . That was the choice they made , and I think it was the wrong choice. &quot; Time magazine said of the film : &quot; Winona Ryder in ' Reality Bites ' showed that among Generation X , smoking is cool. &quot; The film ' s screenwriter , Helen Childress , takes_exception to that . &quot; I thought something like this might happen , &quot; says Childress , who wrote the movie while a student at USC a_few years ago . &quot; I thought people might get a little put_off by that character trait . ( She says that Ryder herself doesn ' t smoke. ) that ' s kind of the reality , though . Half the people I know do smoke , and it ' s not that big of a deal . It ' s like , no one cares . . . . I wasn ' t doing_it to make her cool or a bad role_model . It was just because I smoke when I write , and I just put that in . I was making an honest documentation of what was going_on around me . &quot; I know smoking ' s bad , and hey -- I want to quit , &quot; she adds . &quot; I certainly wasn ' t trying to win_over smokers. &quot; If they tune out advertising , both Clare and Lisa are keenly aware of the much-publicized health risks that go_along with smoking . Clare says her mother made her write a four-page report on the effects of smoking . Although she calls the project &quot; a very big pain in the butt , &quot; she did learn about links between smoking , cancer and heart_disease ; the effects of secondhand smoke , and about additives in cigarettes . &quot; It freaked me out , &quot; she says , &quot; and it did make me think_about quitting because it made me sad about what may happen later on . I know I ' m not going_to smoke when I get_married , and when I have kids , I ' m definitely quitting . . . . When I first started smoking , I got bronchitis and I quit for a month after that . But I haven ' t been_sick at all this past year . My friends and I are really healthy , we eat well , take vitamins , and smoking is the one thing we do to ourselves that ' s bad. &quot; But it ' s difficult for Clare to focus_on the distant future . &quot; When you read about something like ( cancer ) , you don ' t really apply it to yourself . This is going_to happen to another person , and it ' s hard for me to think_about getting lung_cancer and dying of it . You can ' t live_in paranoid fear of cancer -- we do live_in L.A. and we have smog . . . . &quot; I don ' t plan on smoking for the rest of my life , just until I get sick_of it . Maybe that ' s unrealistic , but it works for me. &quot; UCLA ' s Sarna would like young_women to think_about the future -- long and hard . &quot; There ' s a lot of attention in the media on breast_cancer , which is well-deserved , &quot; she says , &quot; but ( in recent years ) lung_cancer has become the No . 1 cause of cancer-related deaths in women . If you look_at the current health publications for women , you ' ll find there ' s almost nothing about the negative effects of smoking or about lung_cancer . If they do , they ' ll talk_about fetal risk -- but most women are not pregnant most of the time. &quot; Women may even be more susceptible to lung_cancer than men , according to a recent report_out of the Yale_University Medical_Center . Dr. Harvey Risch found that men who smoked about a pack of cigarettes a day for about 40 years had a risk of contracting lung_cancer that was nine times higher than the rate of male nonsmokers . But female smokers ' risk was 27 times the rate of female nonsmokers . The reasons are inconclusive , although Risch speculates that a woman ' s disadvantage might be her slightly smaller lung capacity . &quot; I used to be a cross-country runner , &quot; Lisa says . &quot; I could run a pretty good mile in about six or seven minutes . At the end of last year I tried it -- no way . It took me about 10 minutes . I have chronic_bronchitis , and of course , it ' s directly from smoking . It does scare me . But I smoke more_than the times I really think_about it. &quot;</TEXT>
