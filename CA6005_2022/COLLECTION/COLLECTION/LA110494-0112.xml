   <HEADLINE> ' BANDIT QUEEN ' ELIGIBLE FOR OSCAR TRY ; MOVIES : BUT PRODUCER S . S . BEDI ' S CONTROVERSIAL FILM STILL FACES A LAST HURDLE -- IT NEEDS TO BE NOMINATED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After traveling from India to Hollywood to appeal for Academy Award eligibility for his controversial film , &quot; The Bandit Queen , &quot; producer S . S . ( Bobby ) Bedi has won assurances that it had qualified for entry all along . The Academy of Motion_Pictures Arts and Sciences informed him last Friday that , unlike domestic movies that must have a seven-day run in_order to qualify for Oscar consideration , films in the foreign language category must only have had a single public screening in their country_of_origin -- a standard met by &quot; Bandit Queen , &quot; which played for a day before the Delhi High_Court issued a nationwide stay against screening the film in public or in private . India ' s Censor Board sought the ban and is demanding cuts before the film can be shown . The board wants to eliminate profanity , rape sequences and references_to the landowning Thakurs , who are portrayed as villains . Bedi contends that the censors ' objections are based on the film ' s critical portrayal of caste injustice . Bedi also benefited from the fact that the academy had granted an extension of the Oct . 31 submission deadline to the Indian Film Federation , the body responsible_for selecting the country ' s official entry . The group had written to request more time in light of the country ' s cholera plague . When the producer returns from the London Film Festival , where &quot; Bandit Queen &quot; is being screened today , he intends to make the federation his next target . &quot; Getting them to nominate the film is the only hurdle left to cross , &quot; observed the 38-year-old Bedi . &quot; Though they might decide to oppose the film because the government did , I ' m optimistic . The ban -- after the overwhelmingly positive reviews at film festivals in Toronto , Montreal , Tokyo and Edinburgh -- has made the movie a cause_celebre at_home and abroad. &quot; The controversy has been fed by a breach of privacy suit by Phoolan Devi , whose life it purports to portray . * The $ 1.4-million &quot; Bandit Queen &quot; -- which Kushwant Singh , India ' s best-known newspaper_columnist , called the best Indian movie he had ever seen -- relates the tale of a member of the lowly Mallah caste who , at age 11 , is sold into marriage in exchange for a cow and a bicycle . After repeated rapes and the murder of her lover , she picks_up a gun and takes revenge on the higher-class Thakurs . In 1981 , Devi was charged with the murder of 22 members of that caste -- an allegation she denied before being imprisoned without trial for 11 years . She was released from jail this year . &quot; The film should be called a work of imagination and not my real_life story , &quot; Devi told The Times . Devi ' s opposition to the film , Bedi suggests , stems from the fact that she may be running_for political office and is fearful of negative publicity . And the High_Court would like nothing better than to thwart the movie ' s Oscar prospects because of its unflattering view of India , he claims . Another hearing on &quot; Bandit Queen &quot; has been scheduled for Monday , at which time the authorities will review the decision to ban the movie unless certain scenes depicting sex , violence and material insulting to the Thakurs are snipped . &quot; Without cuts , it ' s impossible the movie will be shown , &quot; Bedi said . &quot; With cuts , there would be nothing left of the film -- it would become ' Mickey_Mouse III. ' Rape and child molestation , after all , are at the heart of the point that I ' m making . Although the government and the censor board permitted &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; to be shown with far more nudity and violence than mine , ' The Bandit Queen ' hits too close to home . The last time the caste_system was this seriously attacked was by Mahatma_Gandhi , who took a peaceful approach . This film makes you hate yourself , as a country and as an individual. &quot; Failing in his effort to have the ban lifted , Bedi -- whose previous film &quot; Electric Moon &quot; ( 1991 ) dealt with the real-life practice by former Indian Maharajis of peddling bogus elephant safaris and other cultural artifacts to unsuspecting tourists -- headed for Los Angeles to plead his case . The producer says he found the group unusually sympathetic . Bruce Davis , executive_director of the academy , pointed_out , however , that no rules were bent . &quot; Mr. Bedi was asking_for special treatment , &quot; he said . &quot; But if we start playing that game , it will come_back to haunt us . We ' ve heard wonderful things about his film , but how do we know that it is the best one out of India this year ? If we start making that determination instead of relying_on the committees in the respective countries to do so , we ' d be vulnerable to anyone who comes_over here with a good public relations person. &quot; &quot; Bandit Queen , &quot; which was directed by Shekhar Kapur , is not the first foreign language film to encounter political opposition in its search for an Oscar . &quot; Farewell My Concubine &quot; was banned in China but , because a number of its creators were born in Hong Kong , was ultimately submitted by that country . China also asked that the nomination of &quot; The Story of Ju Dou &quot; be rescinded -- a request the academy ultimately turned_down . Should the Indian Film Federation decide to bypass Bedi ' s film , there ' s still a possibility that &quot; Bandit Queen &quot; could compete in other categories . In an ironic twist , if the movie has a seven-day run in Los Angeles County by Dec . 31 , it would qualify for all_the narrative categories -- except foreign language film . Insiders consider this an improbable scenario , however . &quot; The chance of lining_up a North_American distribution deal and showing the movie in the next eight weeks is a long_shot , &quot; said one person close to the proceedings . &quot; As_good_as the movie is , the business just doesn ' t work that fast. &quot;</TEXT>
