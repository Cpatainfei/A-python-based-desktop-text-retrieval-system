   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : SAN PEDRO ; HIS FLEET OF SHIPS IS THE VERY MODEL OF PERFECTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> John Pignatelli has built scores of ships in his lifetime , but no one has ever sailed on any of them . And yet , looking_at Pignatelli ' s ships , at their detail and realism , you get the feeling that you could easily sail one across an ocean -- if only you could shrink to 1 / 96th scale . Pignatelli is the artist in residence and master modeler at the Los Angeles Maritime Museum in San Pedro , building and repairing the vast armada of miniature ships that fill the exhibit halls . One of a handful of full-time professional ship modelers in the nation , he has managed to turn a common boyhood fascination into art that is historically accurate and sometimes astonishingly beautiful . &quot; I love doing_it , &quot; says Pignatelli , 45 . &quot; When one is finished , and it ' s looking good , everything is right , it ' s a great feeling. &quot; Take a stroll through the Maritime Museum and you can see his art in action . There ' s the World_War_II cruiser Houston , which appeared in the made-for-TV movie &quot; Mission of the Sharks , &quot; aired Sunday night . There ' s the cruiser Los Angeles , 14 feet long and perfect to the smallest detail , which took Pignatelli two years to build . There ' s the little harbor tug that was used in a scene in &quot; The Hunt for Red October &quot; and a couple dozen commercials . Although Pignatelli built only a_few of the 700 models on display at the museum , even the ones he did not make have benefited from his expertise . About a dozen of the museum ' s sailing_ship models were badly damaged in the Jan . 17 earthquake , and Pignatelli and his volunteer helpers spent months getting them back in shape . &quot; His models are exceptional , &quot; said Maritime Museum Director William B . Lee . &quot; We feel very fortunate to have him affiliated with the museum. &quot; Pignatelli ' s art isn ' t limited to the Maritime Museum , however , but can be found at museums and private collections around the world . His model of the ill-fated luxury_liner Titanic is in a Taiwan museum ; a 60-inch model of the_British ocean_liner Britannia will soon be there , too . His models , some of which take at least 1 # 000 hours to build , also have been featured in numerous movies and television_shows . Some sell for $ 25 # 000 or more . &quot; I ' m not getting rich at it , &quot; says Pignatelli , a Rancho Palos Verdes resident . &quot; But there are worse ways to make a living. &quot; Pignatelli came_to ship modeling naturally . Born three blocks from the Philadelphia Navy_Yard , the son of a civilian naval_engineer , he started building plastic ship models from kits . His first was a Revell kit of the battleship Missouri ; his first sailing_ship was the frigate Constitution , nicknamed &quot; Old Ironsides. &quot; Later , after he married ( Pignatelli and his wife , Robin , have two children ) he took a job as the head of an air shipping company . But he kept building models . Eight years ago he retired from the air shipping business and took_up the model making_full time . He got some jobs through contacts in the film_industry . Pignatelli recalls building a model of a speedboat for Universal Studios , which insisted on as much detail as possible . So Pignatelli spent weeks adding details such_as a tiny beer_can sitting on a table inside one of the cabins , along with tiny lamps and chairs . Pignatelli proudly delivered the ship model to the studio , where technicians promptly blew it up for a battle scene , tiny beer_can and all . Pignatelli uses actual shipyard plans when possible . ( He has a security clearance from the Navy to obtain at least partial blueprints of ships. ) Parts are made of special rubber , fiberglass , wood , photo-etched copper or stainless_steel . He and his primary volunteers -- Paul Knierm , Al Smith , Jim Cummings and Garrick Gilham -- are working_on a plan to raise money for the museum by creating limited_editions of famous ships . The first two efforts will be 500 models of a Liberty_ship at $ 1 # 000 a copy , and another 250 models of the famous Bluenose fishing schooner at $ 2 # 000 per copy . Pignatelli teaches a modeling class at the museum Saturdays but points_out : &quot; There ' s no school for this . &quot; It really takes a lifetime to learn . And I ' m still learning. &quot;</TEXT>
