   <HEADLINE> HOT TOPIC : STARS , NEWS COVERAGE ; TELEVISION : RADIO-TV NEWS DIRECTORS DEBATE THE ETHICS OF REPORTING SENSATIONAL STORIES AT THEIR 49TH ANNUAL CONVENTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 49th annual convention of the Radio-Television News Directors Assn . winds_up here today after four days of discussions and debates ranging from the latest digital technology to methods for keeping tired viewers awake to see the late news . Despite all_the latest state-of-the-art equipment being demonstrated on the massive exhibit floor at the Los Angeles Convention Center and several panels about politics and technological advances , however , much of the buzz among the about 2 # 000 attendees centered around the evaporating line of ethics surrounding the coverage of sensational stories and celebrities . Jose Rios , news director at KTTV-TV Channel 11 , said , &quot; Here in Los Angeles especially , with all_the recent examples we ' ve had , the whole profession is long overdue for some healthy self-examination. &quot; During one of the livelier panels at the convention , attorney Howard Weitzman , who has represented Michael Jackson , Kim Basinger and O.J. Simpson , and others blasted the news directors for stories filled with rumors and innuendo that they said have damaged the lives and reputations of celebrities . &quot; I ' m one of those who feel that journalists have not only stepped over the line , but you can ' t see the forest for the trees , &quot; Weitzman said during a panel_discussion Thursday titled &quot; Private Lives of Public People. &quot; &quot; You don ' t even know where the line is anymore. &quot; Weitzman , who represented Simpson before he was charged with the murder of his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend Ronald Goldman , called the television_news coverage of that case &quot; outrageous. &quot; &quot; There seems to be this sick obsession with the voyeuristic aspect of celebrities , and people are getting overdosed on it , &quot; said another panelist , Roy Aarons , president of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Assn . But panelist John Tomlin , executive producer of the tabloid TV newsmagazines &quot; American Journal &quot; and &quot; Inside Edition , &quot; defended the intense interest of journalists in the comings and goings of celebrities . &quot; I believe celebrities think they have privileges that most of us don ' t have , &quot; said Tomlin . &quot; We should look_into their private lives . We have an obligation to see what they ' re up to. &quot; Weitzman also complained that news organizations are too slow to apologize or issue retractions when mistakes are made in their coverage . The moderator of the session , Emily Rooney , a former ABC News producer who is now working_on a new newsmagazine for Fox , blasted KNBC-TV Channel 4 for its apology concerning a recent erroneous story about the Simpson case by reporter Tracie Savage . Several days after her report about tests conducted on socks seized at Simpson ' s home was denounced as false by Judge Lance Ito and prosecutors , Savage went_on the air and blamed her sources for supplying erroneous information . &quot; That apology was wimpy and mealy-mouthed , &quot; Rooney said . &quot; I would have been happier if they had said , ' We made a mistake ; we blew it. ' People are ready for that. &quot; Illustrating her point , Rooney praised KCBS-TV Channel 2 for its explanation and apology for an error on a Simpson-related story about what time prosecutor Marcia Clark had been present for a search of the former football star ' s home . Some news directors at the session also said they were horrified at some of the coverage surrounding celebrities and at the intense focus_on the Simpson case . And in the hallways , some expressed concern about the direction of television_news .</TEXT>
