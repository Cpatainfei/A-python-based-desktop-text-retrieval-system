   <HEADLINE> HAITI MILITARY TO FINANCE ANTI-ARISTIDE CAMPAIGN IN U.S. , SOURCES SAY ; CARIBBEAN : LT . GEN . CEDRAS OBTAINED $ 500 # 000 FROM THE CENTRAL_BANK AT A FAVORABLE EXCHANGE_RATE . SOME SEE THE MOVE AS A SIGN HE IS DIGGING IN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , the military strongman here , recently obtained $ 500 # 000 from the Central_Bank at a highly favorable exchange_rate to finance a lobbying and publicity campaign in the United States against the return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , Haitian political and financial experts say . In what is seen as a sign of his financial independence and his determination to stay in power , Cedras -- a leader of the September , 1991 , military overthrow of Aristide -- brought 500 # 000 Haitian dollars to the bank late last week and drew $ 500 # 000 U.S. The normal exchange_rate , however , is $ 3 Haitian for $ 1 U.S. , meaning Cedras -- if involved in a routine swap -- should have received about $ 167 # 000 U.S. from the bank , which is so close to being broke that it has been unable to regularly pay government workers . As a sign of just how severe the dollar shortage is here , private donors had to raise $ 300 # 000 so Haitian television could pay to broadcast the World Cup soccer games . Evans Paul , the pro-Aristide mayor of Port-au-Prince , said he had been told that the money will go_to American lobbyists , politicians and journalists to campaign against the return of Aristide , Haiti ' s first democratically elected president . Other business sources confirmed the transaction . One said of the money ' s planned use : Military_leaders &quot; already are portraying Aristide as a traitor who is promoting American military intervention . What they want to do now is get their allies in the United States to renew the campaign to show Aristide as unbalanced , untrustworthy , anti-democratic and not worth U.S. intervention . I think you will also begin to hear complaints ( from anti-Aristide forces in the United States ) that the embargo is only hurting the poor , while Aristide sits in Washington in comfort and criticizes American policy. &quot; As part of U.S. efforts to turn_up the pressure on the Haitian military regime , all passenger air service between the United States and Haiti was cut_off Friday , causing jams in airports . There were Haitians in New York and Miami who were flocking home , laden with food and other necessities and determined to wait out the deepening crisis at_home . Meantime , in Haiti , there were foreigners and Haitians who were trying to flee the Caribbean nation . Haitians and others can still fly_on other routes on non-U.S. carriers -- especially Air France -- to get_around the toughened U.S. sanctions , which also included Wednesday ' s blocking of all Haitian-held accounts in U.S. banks worldwide and the freezing of the assets of the Haitian elite in the United States . Despite the now almost-complete economic embargo against Haiti and a U.S. policy to restore Aristide , the Haitian military has received extensive and high-level support in the United States , including from prominent senators , journalists and political operatives . Sources said the new U.S. ban on financial transactions presented no obstacle to Cedras , as he seeks to transfer his newly acquired funds to supporters in the United States . &quot; Cedras simply puts the money in an offshore account in a non-American bank and then moves the funds to the States , &quot; a finance expert said . The sources said the Cedras operation is evidence of several trends in the Haitian crisis . Cedras raised the money from other military_officers and some civilians who have developed close business_relationships with the army since the coup , other sources said . &quot; This shows that the general and his friends have no intention of giving_up , &quot; a Haitian political figure said . &quot; If they were going_to leave the country , they would n ' t be using ( this money ) for an anti-Aristide publicity campaign , &quot; one diplomat said . A financial expert with extensive government experience pointed to the experience of Jean-Claude Duvalier , the last of his family ' s dictatorial dynasty , who looted the Central_Bank just before he fled the country in February , 1986 . &quot; When he knew he was going_to have to leave , &quot; the expert said , &quot; he drew millions from the treasury . He didn ' t trust banks and liked to have a stock of money on_hand in case anything happened. &quot; Another signal , according to the sources , was the source of Cedras ' cash . &quot; He raised the money from other officers and his friends , &quot; one political source said . &quot; That shows he doesn ' t need the elite , that he has access to all_the money he needs without asking_for help. &quot; The source was making the point that , until recently , the military was largely at the mercy -- financially and politically -- of Haiti ' s wealthy elite , particularly the six richest families , who could direct the armed forces in their policies and actions . But since the coup , said one diplomat , Cedras and his friends &quot; have become independently wealthy -- and I stress independently . That is why the ( American ) policy of trying to get the elite to put pressure on the military hasn ' t worked and won ' t work now. &quot; He was referring to the latest Clinton_Administration sanctions aimed at punishing the elite , in the hopes that would force them to demand the expulsion of Cedras and other ranking officers . &quot; First of all , ( they ) . . . the Mevs and the Brandts ( two prominent families ) and the others have had enough warning to have moved most of their money and other assets to safe havens . Beyond that , Haitians won ' t blame the military , and , if they do , they are afraid to challenge them . But they will blame the Americans. &quot; A leading anti-military business figure supported that view , saying : &quot; All of the phone_calls I ' ve received are saying , ' What are your American friends doing , trying to kill us ? ' I tell them they have to take responsibility on themselves and go_to the military , but all they say is that it ' s the Americans ' fault and they have to fix it. &quot;</TEXT>
