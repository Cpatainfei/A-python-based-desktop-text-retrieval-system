   <HEADLINE> EX-SEN . CARPENTER SEIZED IN COSTA RICA ; FUGITIVE : THE FORMER LEGISLATOR FLED EARLIER THIS YEAR AFTER BEING CONVICTED OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION . PROSECUTOR IS CONFIDENT HE WILL BE EXTRADITED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former state Sen . Paul B . Carpenter , who fled the country earlier this year after his conviction on political corruption charges , was arrested Thursday in Costa Rica . U.S. Atty . Charles J . Stevens said that Costa Rican authorities found Carpenter living_in a condominium in a suburb of that nation ' s capital city , San Jose . Carpenter ' s attorney , Charles F . Bloodgood , said the 66-year-old former Democratic lawmaker from Downey apparently expected to be caught , but perhaps not quite so soon . Bloodgood said he received a vague note some weeks ago in which Carpenter apologized for his flight . Carpenter wrote that his attorney from an unidentified country would contact the Sacramento lawyer &quot; when the FBI catches_up_with me. &quot; &quot; I hadn ' t expected they would find him so soon , &quot; Bloodgood said . &quot; Paul Carpenter is a very intelligent , resourceful individual . The FBI got him comparatively quickly. &quot; Bloodgood said he believes that Carpenter left the country with no more_than $ 8 # 000 in savings and without prospects for additional income . Federal prosecutors last month obtained a court_order that in_effect cuts_off Carpenter ' s state pension . &quot; He wasn ' t in very great financial shape , &quot; said Bloodgood , who noted that legal expenses had depleted Carpenter ' s savings . &quot; It was a very , very low-budget flight. &quot; Prosecutor Stevens said his office , working with the U.S. State_Department , has asked that Carpenter be held without bail while awaiting extradition . Stevens was confident that Carpenter would be returned to the United States , where he faces sentencing . &quot; This is a straightforward , slam-dunk extradition request , &quot; Stevens said , pointing_out that the United States has an extradition treaty that has generally been honored by the Costa Rican government . In February , Carpenter failed to show_up at a sentencing hearing after his conviction on 11 counts of extortion , racketeering and conspiracy . He faced a maximum sentence of seven years and three months in prison on those charges , and he was awaiting a retrial in a separate corruption case as well . He is also facing possible charges relating to his flight that could add_up to 10 years to his sentence . After Carpenter fled , he sent a note to federal_District Judge Edward J . Garcia saying that he was leaving the country for alternative treatment for terminal prostate cancer . In the handwritten note , Carpenter wrote : &quot; I find my drive for survival stronger than my sense of obligation to your legal system. &quot; On Thursday , Bloodgood said he always expected that Carpenter would one day voluntarily return for treatment of his disease in California , where he was covered by medical insurance . After Carpenter ' s flight , the FBI issued a postcard-size wanted notice , which it distributed around the world . Stevens said Carpenter was first spotted in late February , living_in a hotel in San Jose under a false_name . Earlier this week , when all_the necessary papers were filed and Costa Rican authorities moved_in for the arrest , Carpenter had checked_out of his hotel without leaving a forwarding address . &quot; We were concerned that he had gotten_wind of the extradition request and fled Costa Rica , &quot; Stevens said . But Costa Rican authorities soon found him again , living_in a condominium in a suburb of San Jose , and arrested him . A source close to Carpenter indicated that he may have felt safe from extradition in the Central_American_country . But Stevens said that extradition difficulties are more likely to occur in cases where a fugitive has been accused of a crime but not convicted . &quot; Typically , if the request is based on a conviction , ( extradition ) should be more streamlined. &quot; Bloodgood predicted that Carpenter will fight extradition . &quot; He ' s looking_at a lot of trouble , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
