   <HEADLINE> UFW SETS OFF ON TREK BACK INTO THE FIELDS ; LABOR : WITH MEMBERSHIP AND INFLUENCE FLAGGING , THE UNION SAYS ITS 330-MILE PILGRIMAGE SYMBOLIZES A RENEWED COMMITMENT TO THE DREAMS OF FOUNDER CESAR CHAVEZ .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United Farm_Workers , hoping to reclaim the magic that once made_it such a force in these fields , began a 330-mile march up the spine of the Central Valley on Thursday -- a trek that signals the union ' s return to the work of organizing farm laborers . The pilgrimage , or peregrinacion , opened with a 90-minute Mass on the 67th anniversary of Cesar Chavez ' s birth . About 750 people led by Arturo Rodriguez , Chavez ' s son-in-law and successor , and Dolores Huerta , co-founder of the union , marched from the UFW ' s Forty Acres compound to the first overnight stop , the town of Richgrove , about eight miles northeast . The union hopes to enlist 10 # 000 new members by the time the march is over . It will end with a rally in Sacramento in three weeks , on the first anniversary of the union founder ' s death . &quot; The pilgrimage is about recommitment and penance , &quot; Rodriguez said at the outset of the march , &quot; recommitment to building a national union for farm_workers , penance , because all_of us let Cesar carry the responsibility for organizing the union on his soldiers . Now the burden for fulfilling Cesar ' s dreams and our own rests squarely on each of us. &quot; Even as the pilgrimage was announced , municipalities elsewhere in the state were underscoring how far the union has come . In Los Angeles , the Eastside ' s landmark Brooklyn Avenue was renamed Cesar E . Chavez Avenue . Meanwhile , the city of San Fernando -- the first in the state to declare Chavez ' s birthday a holiday -- held a march in the labor_leader ' s honor . But the march also signals an important departure from the strategies of Chavez . No longer will the grape boycott be the centerpiece of the UFW ' s activities , as it has for the past decade . The union ' s leadership has decided to return to the fields to enlist new members , confront growers and push for new contracts . The shift in strategy is a concession that the boycott alone has not been enough to improve the lot of farm_workers , whose wages have leveled_off or dropped_in the past decade . The return to organizing is seen as a gamble for a union that has suffered years of defeat and infighting and the death last April of Chavez . Today , the UFW does not have a single contract with grape growers ; in 1973 , it had contracts with 80 % of them . It has fewer than 15 # 000 members now , compared to 100 # 000 at its height . Critics called the march a desperate public relations ploy to revive a dying union . &quot; This march is a publicity stunt , &quot; said Richard Baiz of the Grape Workers and Farmers Coalition , an advocate group representing the grape industry that opposes the UFW . &quot; The grape boycott was a huge failure and now they want to organize in the fields . &quot; Well , they ' re going to find it tough out there . The farm_workers are happy just to have a job , and working conditions have improved a great_deal since the 1970s . For the UFW , this is Custer ' s last stand. &quot; The shift in strategy is welcomed by longtime supporters and former top UFW organizers . The pilgrimage retraces the path Chavez took 28 years ago this spring , a march that transformed the relatively unknown labor_leader and this farm town into national symbols . For the past decade , some of them have decried the union ' s retreat from the fields and its singular dependence on the grape boycott and the issue of toxic pesticides as a means of pressuring growers to improve the lot of farm_workers . They asked how can a union be a union without organizing workers . Times staff writer Miguel Bustillo contributed to this story .</TEXT>
