   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : WESTMINSTER ; FIRE CONTRACTING PLAN WON ' T BE_ON BALLOT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A proposal to ask voters in November whether the city should contract for fire services with the Orange County Fire_Department got nowhere with the City_Council this week . Council_members discussed the proposal Tuesday but did not take a vote , effectively killing Councilman Craig Schweisinger ' s suggestion to let voters decide if the city ' s Fire_Department should be phased_out . Schweisinger said that residents have urged the city to contract with the county to save money . He said that preliminary studies indicate the city could save about $ 2 million a year by disbanding its Fire_Department , which has a $ 7-million budget_for fiscal_year 1994-95 . &quot; I don ' t think this is the time to do_it , &quot; said Councilman Tony Lam , citing the ongoing reorganization of the 65-member department . The council later approved filling three new management positions in the Fire_Department . An assistant fire_chief and two division chiefs will be hired next month or in early September , Fire_Chief John T . DeMonaco Jr . said . DeMonaco said that applicants were interviewed earlier this month . One of the finalists for assistant fire_chief is a battalion chief in the department , he said . &quot; I hope this ( reorganization ) is given a chance to work , &quot; DeMonaco said . The council has created a 10-member Finance Review Committee that is looking_into ways the city could provide fire protection services at less cost . Among the options being considered is contracting with the county , officials said . &quot; We need a massive reworking of our fire services , &quot; Councilwoman Charmayne S . Bohman said . &quot; We have to look_at all alternatives. &quot; The Finance Review Committee also will consider privatizing fire services and combining services with other cities , she said . Acting City_Manager Robert J . Huntley said that there had been preliminary talks with Garden Grove officials to consolidate fire services but reorganizing the Fire_Department has been his main concern over the past several months .
