   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : CENTRAL : DOWNTOWN ; PANEL SEARCHES FOR EL PUEBLO MANAGER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A seven-member panel overseeing operations at El Pueblo de Los Angeles is starting a nationwide search for a new general_manager to run the city ' s birthplace , officials said . Commissioners are scheduled to discuss and finalize the manager ' s job description at a meeting Thursday , said chairwoman Lydia Lopez . That information will then be passed along to the city personnel_department , which will advertise the opening nationwide . The search could take six to eight months . &quot; We want the job to be a general_manager position that allows us on an annual basis to review that person ' s work , &quot; Lopez said . The commission will also look_for an interim director for the El Pueblo monument , home to merchants who run tourist shops and restaurants along Olvera Street . Manuel Mollinedo , assistant general_manager for the city ' s recreation and parks department , has been assigned to supervise El Pueblo ' s staff until an interim director is appointed . Mollinedo replaces Anthony Gonzales , who ran business operations at the monument for three years when the El Pueblo commission was formed . Because no one was appointed to the seven-member panel until this summer , the parks department has continued to manage El Pueblo and its merchants . Many Olvera Street merchants who complained about Gonzales ' effectiveness saw his removal as a top priority for the new commission . But before that board could take any action , parks officials decided earlier this month to transfer Gonzales to work_at a service yard as an analyst -- his regular job title . &quot; The sense was that it would be good to have a fresh_start because it ' s no secret that Mr. Gonzales was controversial , &quot; said Elliott Porter , parks personnel director . &quot; This wasn ' t disciplinary. &quot; Porter added that while Gonzales earned $ 49 # 235 a year , the permanent El Pueblo general_manager could receive at least $ 75 # 000 annually . Gonzales declined comment . Linda Barth , associate director for history at El Pueblo and director of Travel Town in Griffith Park , said the need to promote and increase visitors to the monument are key concerns for the El Pueblo director .
