   <HEADLINE> A FRANK DISCUSSION ; YES , HOT DOGS ARE A HIGH-FAT , GUILTY PLEASURE . BUT A CONNECTION BETWEEN FRANKFURTERS AND CANCER IN KIDS ? SAY IT AIN ' T SO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First it was Alar on the apples in Mom ' s apple_pie . Then it was pesticide residue in the milk from mother ' s breast . Now we ' re supposed to worry about the last remaining all-American food : the humble hot dog . And just in time for the Fourth_of_July . As icons go , the hot dog ' s halo has been slipping for some time . Decades ago , frankfurters were identified as a leading cause of choking death among young children . They became even more of a guilty pleasure when federally mandated food labels confirmed hot dogs ' high-fat , high-sodium constitution . In 1992 , the federal_government included hot dogs on a list of foods that can be hazardous if not fully cooked . So it comes as no surprise that these slippery pink logs of unspecified animal innards are not health_food . But -- hot dogs and leukemia ? that ' s the relationship being investigated in the wake of recent findings by USC researchers , who compared the hot dog intake of 232 Los Angeles children who developed leukemia to a matched group of children who did not . According to USC epidemiologist John Peters ' report in a cancer research journal , children who eat more_than 12 hot dogs per month have nine times the normal risk of developing childhood leukemia . Two other reports in the same issue of Cancer Causes and Control suggest that children born to mothers who ate_at least one hot dog per week while pregnant have twice the risk of developing brain_tumors , as do children whose fathers ate too many hot dogs before conception . &quot; Geez , wasn ' t it just last week we had that popcorn scare ? &quot; says Lon Rosenberg , who proudly oversees hot dog concessions at Dodger Stadium . &quot; Now they ' re after Dodger Dogs ! Enough is enough . &quot; When I was growing_up , I ate_at least a dozen dogs a month at the ballpark . And I ' m sure my kids eat that many now , &quot; Rosenberg says . &quot; If there was anything wrong with that , my friends at Farmer John would ' ve warned us , would n ' t they ? &quot; Sure would , say the folks at Farmer John , who make Dodger Dogs . They , like the dozens of other hot dog manufacturers , are steamed about all_the media attention over what they call an &quot; obviously flawed &quot; study . &quot; They shouldn ' t have released the study , &quot; Farmer John spokesman Ron Smith says . &quot; It doesn ' t do any good . Why cause such a ruckus ? &quot; &quot; Trust me , we never meant to cause a ruckus , &quot; says Peters , still reeling from the reaction to research quietly published last March . &quot; We never set_out to indict hot dogs . &quot; Dietary exposure to processed or cured meats was part of a little side questionnaire to our study on ( electro ) magnetic_fields . We were as surprised as anyone by the hot dogs findings . . . . It was the biggest risk for anything we saw in the study -- about four times the risk for EMFs. &quot; Any cancer in children is considered very rare . Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia strikes only about three in every 10 # 000 children , so even a ninefold increase still presents a relatively small risk . Even so , some health experts , including Peters ' group , suggest that children reduce their consumption of hot dogs and other processed foods -- such_as bacon , ham and bologna -- until more is known about the danger . For now , no one knows what the connection is between hot dog-heavy diets and childhood cancer , or even if it is a cause-and-effect link . &quot; Is it the mustard or the ketchup or the relish or the . . . bun ? We operate in a state of ignorance on such questions , &quot; Peters says . * Only one of the ingredients in a typical hot dog sandwich is a known carcinogen -- and that is nitrite . The preservative , which has been found to cause cancer in animals , is added_to hot dogs to protect consumers from botulism and other nasty , even life-threatening bacteria . Proper cooking would kill most of those germs , but the dogs are often eaten raw -- especially by kids . Because the government considers processed meats &quot; fully cooked and ready to eat , &quot; some packages do not warn consumers to cook them further . The risk from bacteria appears to be far greater than that from nitrites , so substituting one of the various nitrite-free brands on the market may pose different hazards . Some pediatricians , including Dr. Nick Roulakis of Arcadia , say studies such_as Peters ' validate his family ' s decision to avoid cured meats altogether . &quot; They are not a crucial part of our diets , &quot; Roulakis says . &quot; In fact , we know that complex carbohydrates like pasta and cereals are much better for children , as well as for adults. &quot; * For ease of preparation , cost-per-serving and fun-per-bite , hot dogs may well be the perfect food . &quot; For two-career ' 90s families with picky eaters like mine , &quot; says Eileen Marsh of Los Angeles , &quot; I ' m not sure I can even imagine life without hot dogs . . . . I haven ' t told the kids yet . I ' m going_to wait till we finish_off this last pack in the fridge. &quot; And what about the Fourth_of_July ? &quot; It ' s just as patriotic to eat healthy hot dogs , &quot; says Eric Hawkins , a buyer for Wild_Oats Community Market in Pasadena . &quot; We ' ve got a nice supply here of tofu-based Smart Dogs and Soy Boys . Very nice on the barbecue . . . . &quot;</TEXT>
