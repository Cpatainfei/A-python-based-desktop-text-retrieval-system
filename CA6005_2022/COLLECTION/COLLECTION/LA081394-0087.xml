   <HEADLINE> LANDSCAPING ; REAP BETTER ENERGY EFFICIENCY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nicest thing about energy-efficient landscaping is that it pays_off year after year . So if your home ' s energy bills seem high , check the landscaping to see if different plants or positions will help . It should -- in winter , in summer and the in-between months . Start now by considering the cooling comfort of a shady spot on a hot day . Trees can be used in much the same way to strategically shade a home from the most intense sunlight . Conversely , in winter , the sun -- if not blocked by landscaping -- will supply free solar heat . Deciduous trees are ideal for energy-efficient landscaping because they provide shade during the warmest months but allow the sun to reach and warm the house in winter , cutting heating costs . A University of Arizona study some years ago reported that exterior shading was seven times more effective than interior cooling . The study , by horticulturists William Miller and Charles Sacamano , found that an outside wall_in full sun transmits three times the heat of a shaded wall to the interior of a structure . It said an unshaded roof adds_to the interior twice the heat of a shaded one . A dense tree canopy was estimated to screen_out at least 80 % of the full-sun radiation and reduce the maximum high_temperatures inside a typical house by 20 % . In a similar context , the Salt River Project , a major supplier of electricity in Arizona , advised customers that , after they mature , three trees planted on the west and southwest sides of a house can save $ 50 to $ 100 in summer-cooling costs . Few areas of California receive as much sunshine as Arizona , but the basic premise will be correct for any climate . In setting_out landscaping plants , be sure to consider how shadows move throughout the year . While the sun always travels on an east-west arc , the arc varies as the sun moves from the southern sky in winter to the northern sky in summer . About June 21 , the summer_solstice , the sun reaches its highest point . The sun is lowest about Dec . 21 , the winter_solstice . As days lengthen and seasons change , so do the shadow directions and lengths . The University of Arizona study found that at noon in southern Arizona , a 40-foot tree will cast a 58-foot shadow at the winter_solstice on Dec . 21 , a 25-foot shadow at the spring and fall_equinox ( March 21 and Sept . 22 ) and a six-foot shadow at the summer_solstice ( June 21 ) . Heat or cooling will also be lost or gained through the home ' s building_materials . Insulation will help , and sealing cracks around doors and windows is essential . But there always will be some conduction through the building , no matter how good the insulation and sealing . that ' s why properly placed plants are important in reducing the differences in inner-outer wall surfaces . Plants also can contribute to energy conservation and living comfort by directing the airflow around a home . Windbreaks should be planted perpendicular to wind direction to reduce the wind ' s effect . Channel cooling breezes by creating an opening at appropriate places in the windbreak planting . Another good strategy is to shade the outside air-conditioning unit . Well-placed small trees or evergreen shrubs will aid its cooling capacity and cut costs . Be sure not to block the discharge area . If the idea of shading walls with vines sounds appealing , be sure to determine first if they can cause physical deterioration of the wall or become invasive to the house .</TEXT>
