   <TEXT> &quot; Video Jam ' 94 , &quot; an exhibition of Cal State Northridge stu dent video art , will be presented Thursday in CSUN ' s Little Theater . These are the works of students in the school ' s fine_arts department , not its radio / television / film department . The art_students ' work is done with a different orientation , says Jack Riley , instructor of the video arts_classes . &quot; These works represent an experimental approach to the video medium , in contrast to regular TV . These works are personal artistic statements , &quot; Riley says . &quot; These artists are completely free . &quot; Some of it is really outrageous , &quot; Riley adds , recommending viewer discretion . The work of about 25 video artists will be presented . Featured works include computer animation and music videos , in addition to personal and political narratives . Jessica Vitale , a CSUN Arts Council scholarship winner last year for her work in computer animation , will present another computer animated project , &quot; Andy &amp; Rufus. &quot; Andrew White ' s &quot; Whiskey Wisdom &quot; combines crayon drawings with computer animation , and John Ledell ' s &quot; Project Molecular Change &quot; combines computer animation and live action .

Video Jam ' 94 will be presented from 8 to 9 p.m. Thursday in the CSUN Little Theatre in the Speech Drama Building , 18111 Nordhoff St .

Call ( 818 ) 885-2242 . * CELEBRITY MUSIC-MAKING : Many churches and temples are busy presenting holiday music programs , but Metropolitan Community Church in the Valley stands_out . Actress and singer Edie Adams will emcee its Yuletide event , &quot; Christmas in Song 1994. &quot; Steven Applegate , the church ' s director of music , says this annual concert , which was hosted last year by actress Sandy Duncan , has become a tradition for many Valley residents . &quot; People come_to get_in the mood for the holiday season , &quot; Applegate says . &quot; Our audiences have grown from about 300 to 600 people just by word_of_mouth . We ( the church ) only have a membership of 125. &quot; Adams , a graduate of the Juilliard School_of_Music and Columbia School of Drama , first gained popularity on &quot; The Ernie Kovacs Show &quot; on television in the early 1950s . In 1955 , she married Kovacs , who died in 1962 .
