   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; GOLD JUMPS , YIELDS HIT 2-YEAR HIGH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Long-term bond yields shot_up to 2 1 / 4-year highs Tuesday after the Federal_Reserve_Board decided to maintain interest_rates for now . But short-term yields fell . A nearly $ 4 jump in gold prices added_to inflation worries among traders in long-term securities . Gold is often used by investors as a hedge against inflation prospects . The dollar dipped , and in the stock_market , blue_chips outperformed the broader market for the second straight session . The Dow Jones industrial average ended_up 13.80 at 3 # 863.04. More stocks lost ground than gained on the Big Board , however , and the other exchanges were essentially flat . &quot; The movement in gold directed things , &quot; said David de Rosa , a director at Swiss Bank Corp . in New York . &quot; The gold market reacted to the Fed as if there will be higher rates_of_inflation . Bonds headed for the_hills and that took the dollar down. &quot; While largely expected , the Fed news reinforced market worries that the central_bank may be falling_behind in its efforts to curb inflation , which gradually harms the value of securities that don ' t mature for many years . Most economists and market players had previously predicted the Fed would wait until at least next month to push_up interest_rates for the sixth time this year . The yield of the Treasury ' s main 30-year bond increased to 7.84 % , the highest close since June 23 , 1992 , and up from 7.79 % . But short-term maturities moved_in the opposite direction . For example , the yield on the three-month bill tumbled to 4.83 % . Market_analysts said the rush to buy Treasury_bills reflected relief that short-term maturities would hold their value for now . The central_bank targets short-term rates to carry_out its monetary policy , and higher rates on new securities tend to hurt the value of already-sold investments that pay a fixed rate of return . With all_the attention on the Fed , investors largely ignored a report that showed unexpectedly weak consumer optimism in the economy . The Conference Board reported its September consumer confidence index slipped to 88.4 from 90.4 in August . Gold and other precious_metals prices surged in domestic dealings after falling slightly overseas . On New York ' s Commodity_Exchange , gold for current delivery rose $ 3.70 to $ 398.00 per troy_ounce , while the heavily traded December futures contract shot above the key $ 400 level . On the Comex , silver for current delivery rose 9 cents to $ 5.712 per troy_ounce . In London , silver closed at $ 5.64 , down 2 cents . Gold mining stocks got a boost from the rise in the metal . Newmont Mining gained 1 to 46 3 / 4 and Placer Dome added 5 / 8 to 25 7 / 8 . The Fed inaction doesn ' t rule_out another rise in rates soon , said Michael Metz , a vice_president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co . &quot; The non-news is out now . But the probability is we will have a move by the Fed in the next month or so , &quot; Metz said . Instead of being preoccupied with rates , investors now might wonder whether the Fed is more fearful of an economic downfall than of future inflation , according to Metz . Among Tuesday ' s market highlights : * Among economically sensitive , Dow Jones component stocks , International Paper rose 1 3 / 8 to 79 , Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber gained 7 / 8 to 33 , while DuPont rose 1 / 4 to 57 3 / 4 . Alcoa rose 1 3 / 4 to 87 1 / 8 after PaineWebber upgraded the stock . Gap dropped 3 / 4 to 31 3 / 8 in heavy trading . Traders said Wall_Street analysts cut earnings forecasts on the retailer . General Motors rose 3 / 4 to 47 1 / 2 despite a United Auto Workers strike at a key parts plant . Baby Superstores surged to close at 34 3 / 4 on heavy Nasdaq volume on its first day of trading . The stock ' s initial price was 18 , and it hit a high of 38 during the session . * Meanwhile in the corporate_bond market , prices of Greyhound bonds plummeted after the company said it would delay a $ 4.2-million interest payment . Greyhound Lines Inc. said it wanted time to develop a restructuring plan . * The drug sector was rejuvenated by Congress ' abandonment of health_care reform legislation for this year . Several pharmaceutical stocks were_active on the NYSE including Merck , up 1 1 / 8 to 36 ; Johnson &amp; Johnson , up 2 1 / 8 to 51 1 / 4 , and Pfizer , up 1 3 / 8 to 69 3 / 8 . * Nynex jumped 2 to 38 and was among the most heavily traded NYSE issues . The regional telephone_company submitted a plan to state regulators today to cut basic rates in New York while freezing other higher rates for seven years . Long-distance companies criticized the plan , saying Nynex is using it to hold_off potential competitors . * Varying performances by stocks overseas didn ' t have much bearing on U.S. trading . Stocks stumbled in Tokyo and the European markets were mixed . * The dollar plunged more_than a pfennig on the German mark , reflecting some disappointment with the central_bank ' s inaction . Higher U.S. rates tend to attract deposits in dollars and give the currency a boost . Against the Japanese yen , the dollar ' s losses were more modest , with dealers reluctant to make bets in either direction amid uncertainty about the outcome of the stalemated U.S.-Japan trade talks .</TEXT>
