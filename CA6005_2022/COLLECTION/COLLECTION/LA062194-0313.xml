   <HEADLINE> ENVIRONMENT ; DIRTYING THE WATERS ; BAD AIR AND POLLUTED LAKES AND RIVERS ARE LEGACIES OF COMMUNIST RULE IN POLAND . WOMEN ARE EVEN ADVISED TO LEAVE KRAKOW DURING PREGNANCY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wojciech Garlej , a 24-year-old driver , is standing patiently in_line to pay_for something that should be the birthright of anyone living_in a European capital at the end of the 20th Century : clean drinking_water . &quot; The water that ' s for free in the taps is not fit for drinking , it ' s so polluted . It ' s simply dirty and has a funny smell , &quot; says Garlej after buying 10 liters ( 2.6 gallons ) of specially treated well_water . Like Garlej , hundreds of Warsaw residents head every day to a small building in the city ' s ritzy Mokotow district to fill canisters with water that meets the highest purity standards . They pay 300 zlotys -- or 1.3 cents -- for each liter ( about a quart ) . Even that tiny sum mounts_up for 70-year-old pensioner Halina Fondalinska , who purchases five liters every_other day . She resents paying_for water but says &quot; what you get_through the pipes doesn ' t even classify as water . When you make tea with this well_water , it ' s really tea. &quot; Bad drinking_water is only one of the many penalties Poles are still paying_for 45 years of environmental damage done_by the negligent Communist system . A report prepared by the Polish Environment Ministry for the United Nations concedes that Poland ' s air_pollution is among the worst in Europe . * Between 1987 and 1989 , for example , Poland was responsible_for 10 % of the total emissions of sulfur_dioxide -- a key ingredient of acid_rain -- on the Continent . Much of the blame falls on use of brown_coal for home heating and electricity generation . Over 80 % of the forests in Poland have been damaged by acid_rain . Within Poland there are some particularly black_holes . Heavily industrial Katowice province , in southern Poland , which represents only 2.1 % of the country ' s territory , emits 20 % to 25 % of its sulfur_dioxide , nitrogen_oxide and dust . The Katowice region is considered the most polluted in Europe . Air and water contamination are so serious in nearby Krakow that pregnant women are often advised by their doctors to leave the city during pregnancy . As for water , the Environment Ministry report called the quality of surface water in the country &quot; tragic. &quot; Like visitors to a Third_World country , foreigners in the Polish capital are warned by locals not to drink from the tap . Not that anyone would be tempted by what comes_out of the spigot . It emerges in hues ranging from pale yellow to deep rust . In some neighborhoods , it reeks of chlorine . The people who operate Warsaw ' s water treatment plants argue that they bring the water up_to World_Health_Organization standards or better before sending it out_to homes and factories . But by the time it ' s traveled through antiquated pipes , bacteria , excessive iron and other dangerous chemicals may be swept along . &quot; Although the water meets the standards , unfortunately the smell and taste of it is not too good , &quot; admits Bozena Mistag , director of the water-quality laboratory at Warsaw ' s Northern Water Treatment Plant . A major problem is the raw_material the water treatment plants receive . Only 4 % of Poland ' s rivers and lakes contain water clean enough to drink even after boiling . A third of the country ' s rivers are so polluted that their waters cannot even be used for industrial purposes because they corrode metal . Water from two-thirds of residential wells in Polish villages is undrinkable . The Vistula_River , from which Warsaw gets much of its drinking_water , often fails to meet even the lowest standards of water for any use -- never mind drinking . And for consumers downstream , it ' s even worse . Warsaw is the only European capital other_than Albania ' s Tirana to dump raw sewage into its main river . As a consequence , Poland is the worst contributor -- among 14 countries -- to Baltic Sea pollution . It bears the dubious distinction of having 38 identified &quot; hot spots &quot; where factories and towns pour pollutants into rivers that empty into the Baltic . Polish authorities estimate that they need $ 6.4 billion to clean_up the country ' s contribution to Baltic pollution -- money the government does not have . * At Warsaw ' s Northern Water Treatment Plant , manager Jan Grzymkowski points_out the disgusting murky gray-brown color of the water taken_in from Zegrzenski Lake -- not far from the spot where numerous villages and small_towns dump their raw sewage . &quot; Our main problem is to get_rid_of the color of the water and the high amount of organic substances in the water , &quot; he says . The water is treated with ozone , one of the most modern methods available . Still , that ' s no guarantee of quality . &quot; The quality of the water when it leaves our plant is much higher than when it reaches your home , &quot; Grzymkowski admits . This is one reason so many Warsaw residents head for wells that deliver water that was trapped in rocks in the Oligocene period . Unfortunately , the Health Ministry warns that even water from these Oligocene wells can be dangerous . Of 50 such wells in the Polish capital , 23 were found to be polluted ; several have been closed . Despite the grim picture , Alicija Lopatek , head of environmental hygiene for the Health Ministry , insists that Polish tap_water , although unappetizing to the eye , &quot; doesn ' t endanger health. &quot; But many residents think otherwise . Ecology activist Barbara Kitta-Gajkowska says her chronic stomach problems disappeared two years ago when she stopped using tap_water . Grzymkowski says : &quot; The only solution is for the government to force factories and towns to build sewage treatment plants so they don ' t dump raw sewage into the rivers we have to drink from. &quot;</TEXT>
