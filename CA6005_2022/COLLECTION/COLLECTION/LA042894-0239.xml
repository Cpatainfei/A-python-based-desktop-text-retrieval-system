   <HEADLINE> FOES AGREE ON PLAN TO CLEAN BAY OFF SANTA MONICA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A $ 67-million plan to clean_up and protect Santa Monica Bay , one of the nation ' s most troubled coastal resources , was unveiled Wednesday by an unusual coalition of elected officials , government experts , scientists , industries and environmentalists . In a landmark program borne of consensus and billed as politically practical , 73 steps to heal the bay are recommended by 1999 -- from stemming pollution flowing through storm drains and creating a citizen &quot; gutter patrol &quot; to restoration of the Ballona Wetlands . The planning effort , which lasted five years and cost $ 5 million , sprang from an unprecedented alliance between warring factions brought_together by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1988 . But the real work begins now to ensure the &quot; action plan &quot; won ' t be followed by years of inaction . &quot; As we ' ve all seen far too often , you can have_the_best plan in the world , but if there is no teeth in implementation and compliance , the actions won ' t get implemented , &quot; said Mark Gold , staff scientist of the environmental group Heal the Bay and one of 50 committee_members . &quot; Everybody ' s biggest fear is that we have this . . . document that just sits on a shelf and gathers dust. &quot; In all , 250 steps were outlined in the plan , but the 73 were designated priorities . If all_the steps suggested were followed , the cost would exceed $ 134 million -- a figure the committee did not include in the report released Wednesday . But achieving even the 73 priorities would cost $ 67 million and test the ingenuity of government , businesses and environmentalists . While $ 30 million can be raised through existing grants and loans and perhaps private fund raising , the rest remains a shortfall , according to the plan . Filling the $ 37-million gap will be &quot; very tough &quot; because of the state ' s ongoing recession , acknowledged Catherine Tyrrell , director of the project . She said the committee hopes that Congress , as it debates reauthorization of the Clean Water Act , or the state Legislature will be generous with grants . &quot; Given the economic climate , some group is likely to be very opposed to most of these ideas , &quot; Tyrrell said . &quot; It ' s going_to take a lot of work and hearing from the public on what they think is important and how the plan can be implemented . There is no easy fix . It may be that everybody is going_to have to contribute a little bit. &quot; The massive estuary faces virtually every type of ecological threat imaginable . It is one of Southern California ' s most popular resources for swimming , boating and surfing , drawing 4 million visitors a year to its more_than 50 miles of beaches stretching from Ventura County to the Palos Verdes Peninsula . The restoration plan focuses_on cleaning_up 19 &quot; pollutants of concern , &quot; some that threaten swimmers and surfers and others that contaminate fish and other aquatic life . &quot; Although it may look healthy , the bay ' s condition is influenced by more_than just what happens in its waters or along its shores . The bay is also affected by what happens in the 414-square-mile watershed that drains into it , &quot; the report says . The brunt of the cleanup proposals focus_on an estimated $ 42 million to control pollution -- not from industrial_plants or sewage , but from the millions of people who live_in the vast watershed that drains into the bay . Urban runoff , the mix of oil , garden chemicals , grease and other debris that flows_from neighborhoods , is considered the primary problem . Public_debate over the 2-inch-thick report will begin tonight at a town_hall meeting from 5 to 8 p.m. at the Westchester Municipal Building at 7166 W . Manchester Ave . Two public hearings will be held June 2 , and all comments are_due June 15 before the plan becomes final . Tyrrell said the plan ' s strength is that it combines &quot; the collective wisdom &quot; of all types of key players involved with the bay , from politicians to scientists to business representatives . &quot; When folks first got_together they were sort of staring each other down around the table and most people thought it certainly couldn ' t work , &quot; she said . &quot; But over time , people realized it ultimately is less costly , and action happens a lot sooner than if we wait 20 years for a lawsuit to get settled. &quot; David Kay , who represents Southern California Edison on the committee , said in a statement that the power_company &quot; will continue to support ( the plan ) through its implementation , &quot; saying &quot; it makes_sense &quot; from an environmental as well as a business standpoint . But Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) , a longtime supporter of cleaning the bay , said he is skeptical because Chevron USA , Edison and sewage treatment plant operators played a major role in choosing the priorities . He has asked_for a Senate committee hearing to analyze the plan . &quot; I ' ve been concerned about whether we ' re spending a lot of money for a rather ineffectual plan , but I am willing to be convinced otherwise , &quot; Hayden said . Gold , of Santa Monica-based Heal the Bay , said he is pleased with the proposals , but noted they are voluntary , so success hinges_on whether local and state_government develop aggressive programs to tackle urban runoff . The report ' s authors said the priorities were based on real risk rather than those the public may perceive as important . For example , proposals to spend $ 3 million to build two rehabilitation centers for marine mammals and birds harmed by oil spills did not make the top list . &quot; There ' s not a lot of money out there , so we wanted to be very practical about choosing the absolutely essential things , &quot; Tyrrell said . Many of the proposals outlined in the plan will be funded through existing resources , so they are not counted in the cost estimates . After 15 years of opposition , Los Angeles County recently agreed to spend $ 400 million to enhance treatment at its Carson sewage plant , which goes_a_long_way toward reducing bacteria that threatens swimmers . Los Angeles ' Hyperion sewage treatment plant also is undergoing a $ 1.1-billion renovation . Other problems , however , are more insidious , particularly ocean sediments laced with 200 tons of the pesticide DDT , which still is contaminating fish and the rest of the bay ' s food_chain two decades after it was banned . Surveys show much of the public believes swimming at the bay ' s 22 public beaches is unsafe . However , many health experts say the threat comes only after rains , when large volumes of runoff elevate bacteria levels . A primary aim of the plan is to find and remove sources of those human pathogens from storm drains before they reach the bay . Specifically , it proposes to divert runoff that flows into the bay during dry weather into treatment plants . Another priority proposal includes boosting the state ' s inspection program to search for illegal sewage connections into storm drains . Another is to develop a better scientific way to measure the health risk of swimming in the surf zone and revise public health standards to &quot; accurately inform the public of where it may be safe to swim , and where it may be not , and why , &quot; according to the report . The plan also proposes measures to protect the aquatic_plants and wildlife that depend_on the bay . Priority proposals include restoring 260 acres of Ballona Wetlands -- one of the last and largest marshes remaining in Los Angeles County -- and hiring additional wildlife wardens at the bay . When it comes_to fish consumption , panel members contended that current research is good and that the threat poses less risk than swimming and loss of wetlands . Informing fishermen of health advisories was the only proposal rated a priority . Picking what pollution sources to target was the most controversial part of the planning . Months of debate centered_on how much to focus_on high-profile sources of pollution , including Chevron ' s El Segundo refinery , the two sewage treatment plants and a now-defunct Montrose chemical plant in Torrance . A majority finally agreed that much of the pollution from those sources already is being controlled by regulations and lawsuits . &quot; Those other fights have already been won , &quot; said Gold . &quot; What has been really lax is control of urban and storm runoff. &quot; Fixing Santa Monica Bay Santa Monica Bay , one of the nation ' s most coastal areas , faces myriad problems . Urban runoff , industrial pollution , sewage and other sources of contamination pose a health risk to swimmers and harm marine life . A coalition of government , scientists , industries and environmentalists unveiled a five-year plan that includes 250 steps -- 73 considered priorities . The estimated cost of just those steps is $ 67 million . Some key proposals are : * Hiring and training city and county workers to manage a program to control urban runoff . Cost : $ 8.9 million * Educating people in how to prevent polluted runoff from their own homes and neighborhoods . Cost : $ 6.2 million * Developing ways to determine the risk to swimmers and revise public health standards . Cost : $ 1.8 million * Developing an inspection system to catch illegal sewage connections into storm drains . Cost : $ 1 million * Adopting and enforcing local ordinances to address storm water and urban runoff , control of erosion and limit pollution from businesses . Cost : $ 8.9 million * Hiring more wildlife protection officers along the bay . Cost : $ 1.6 million * Restoring Ballona wetlands and providing long-term management . Cost : $ 5 million * Developing a restoration plan for Malibu Lagoon primarily to protect wildlife habitats from runoff . Cost : $ 2 million * Enhancing efforts to restore El Segundo Dunes and create a habitat preserve . Cost : $ 500 # 000 Source : Santa Monica Bay restoration plan</TEXT>
