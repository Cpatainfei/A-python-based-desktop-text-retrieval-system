   <TEXT> When the Scottish group One Dove closed its show at the Whisky on Wednesday with its most captivating song , &quot; White Love , &quot; it pulled a trick straight out of its dance-music background -- offering two alternative &quot; mixes , &quot; as it were . As a preliminary to the full-blown , synthesizer-powered version , singer Dot Allison was flanked by two guitarists , whose acoustic blend of chunky rhythm and bottleneck lead sounded like a bluesy outtake from the Stones ' &quot; Beggars ' Banquet. &quot; In the least-confining setting she was given all evening , Allison showed that she could sing with nuance and invention as well as the power she was called_on to deliver for most of the set . One Dove ' s debut album late last year announced the arrival of a potential standard-bearer for the long-anticipated federation of dance-music pulse and rock ' n ' roll emotion . Against those expectations , Wednesday ' s L.A. debut by the Glasgow-based group was a bit of a letdown -- a display of imaginative , often-stirring music that somehow never gathered the force to take_off . As it does on the &quot; Morning Dove White &quot; album , the group tried to reach beyond the limitations of a synthesizer-bound approach , supplementing its core of Allison , keyboardist Ian Carmichael and bassist-keyboardist Jim McKinven with hired hands : guitarist Colin McIlrow and percussionist Edward Higgins . This lineup staked out a territory where both the technological and the human impulses got their due . The synth side -- driving pulse , crunching beats , swirling textures -- was balanced by the live players , notably McIlrow , whose lively rhythm playing and feedback outbursts were central to the music ' s variety and impact . Still , the show didn ' t quite capture the enveloping moods of One Dove ' s record and didn ' t come_up with a compensating energy . As the onstage focal_point , Allison was up and down . In her jeans , fuzzy pink sweater and black-framed eyeglasses , she looked_like an actress dressed_down for a day of preliminary rehearsals . This created a suggestion of glamour deferred , which might have been a miscalculation . The show needed a strong focus , and while Allison ' s voice was unfailingly strong and evocative , her inexperience or inclination left her an uncharismatic figure . Annie Lennox , another Scot who started_out by singing soulfully in front of synthesizers , is an obvious but pertinent comparison . One Dove is creative and ambitious , unafraid to tailor its tempos and sounds in the service of mood and emotion , to invoke ghosts , pursue elusive love and float into ecstasy in cathedral-like sonic chambers . Music this dramatic demands a convincing embodiment on stage , and Allison needs to take things up another level .</TEXT>
