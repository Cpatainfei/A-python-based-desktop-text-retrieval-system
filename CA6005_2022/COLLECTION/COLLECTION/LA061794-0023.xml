   <HEADLINE> HOME ENTERTAINMENT ; EPIC TREATMENT OF ' BEN-HUR ' IN COMMEMORATIVE EDITION ; THE LASER DISC RELEASE MARKING ITS 35TH ANNIVERSARY INCLUDES A COMPELLING HOURLONG DOCUMENTARY WITH HISTORICAL FOOTAGE AND INTERVIEWS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Epic films seem to call_for epic laser-disc presentations , so the 35th anniversary of &quot; Ben-Hur &quot; brings with it a commemorative MGM / UA Home Video edition ( $ 100 ) almost as imposing as the 212-minute movie . The 1959 film , starring a dashing Charlton Heston as Judah Ben-Hur , the Judean locked_in combat against his childhood pal Messala -- played by Stephen Boyd -- a key Roman commander in biblical Jerusalem , swept the Academy Awards with 11 statuettes , more_than any other film before or since . Its Oscars include best picture , director ( William Wyler ) , actor ( Heston ) , supporting actor ( Hugh Griffith ) , color photography , editing , set_decoration and music ( Miklos Rozsa ) . The film , based on Gen . Lew Wallace ' s popular 19th-Century novel , is a mesmerizing view of Christ through the eyes of a contemporary , the ultimately converted Ben-Hur . Wyler says in footage from a 1981 interview , included in the compelling documentary made_for this commemorative edition ( and also available on video ) , that he staged all_the scenes with Christ &quot; so that you only show the back of his head . You saw the way people reacted to him . You think you saw him , you think you heard his voice , but you didn ' t really. &quot; It is an effective means of storytelling . The film ' s monumental 20-minute chariot_race pitting Heston against his enemy Boyd has never been more exciting on the home screen than in this full wide-screen laser presentation . The race itself took more_than a year to prepare , with legendary stunt_man Yakima Canutt overseeing it . He put the stunt_men who were to race the chariots through a rigorous daily regimen . Heston determinedly showed_up at every session . &quot; When the picture started he could drive a chariot just about as well as anyone in the business , &quot; the late Canutt says admiringly in an archival interview in the accompanying documentary , &quot; Ben-Hur : The Making of an Epic. &quot; Yet Heston was not the first choice for the lead . In fact , reports Gore Vidal , who was never credited with the script by the Writers Guild but was among those brought_in to help salvage it , &quot; Heston was never on the list. &quot; Paul Newman ( &quot; Silver Chalice &quot; ) was , but said he would never again &quot; act in a cocktail dress. &quot; Others considered included Kirk Douglas , Marlon Brando and just about every_other actor in and out of Hollywood , many who tried_out in an open casting call . Some of these screen_tests are included in the hour documentary as part of this lavish laser package . But Wyler , just coming_off &quot; The Big Country , &quot; remembered the actor who had played the intense ranch foreman for him . Wyler thought he would be perfect , his daughter Catherine recalls . The new five-disc laser set comes_in the CAV mode ( standard play ) , so that the full features of the format ( freeze frame , single frame , slow_motion ) can all be used as all three hours and 42 minutes unreel on eight sides . Presented in its big-screen aspect_ratio of 2.76:1 , the thin band of film is topped and bottomed with wide black bands . This makes_it possible to see director Wyler ' s original framing and vision , but it does reduce the image to roughly a third of the screen . The rich color digital video transfer loses none of the big-screen epic ' s detail or power , with the color as brilliant as though it had been shot yesterday . The powerful Miklos Rozsa score can be isolated and enjoyed simply as a musical sound track on a separate analog track , re-mastered to Dolby Surround sound from the MGM film ' s original magnetic masters . The ninth side , in CLV ( extended play ) , offers the 59-minute documentary , narrated by Christopher Plummer . It ' s not a bad idea to watch it first , especially if you ' re not familiar_with the film ' s background . Since the documentary is not letterboxed , it helps you appreciate how much is lost , especially in the chariot_race and the Roman galley scenes , when the action is reduced to the ratio of a TV screen without letterboxing . Almost as engrossing as the film itself , the documentary , produced by Scott Benson over nine months , includes wonderful archival footage tracing the history of the epic , from novel through stage and film incarnations . Like its 1926 predecessor , the 1959 &quot; Ben-Hur &quot; was also the most expensive movie of its day . A costly $ 18-million gamble ( when the average film ran $ 2 million- $ 3 million ) , it was in production for three years . In today ' s dollars that would translate to roughly $ 150 million , according to MGM / UA Home Video chief George Feltenstein . Was it worth it ? See for yourself .
