   <HEADLINE> PAKISTAN , INDIA NEGOTIATE -- BUT TENSIONS INCREASE ; SOUTH ASIA : THE TWO COUNTRIES TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF KASHMIR , THEN LAUNCH INTO A WAR OF WORDS . NEITHER SIDE TRULY WANTS A SOLUTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Their differences include a decade-old war atop a Himalayanglacier , accusations of cross-border terrorism and the specter of human-rights violations by the Indian army in what Pakistan has termed &quot; occupied Kashmir. &quot; Neither side is without obstinate views on these issues . Indeed , neither side has softened its stance since partition and the end of British colonialism in 1947 . Talks earlier this month between the two countries ' foreign secretaries resulted in little progress . But it was the first time in 14 months that India and Pakistan have agreed to sit_down and talk_about their differences -- and the first time Kashmir was_on the agenda . With each side adhering to its long-held stance on Kashmir , it became evident that neither has the political will or domestic strength required to end the low-intensity battle between India ' s armed forces and the Muslim Kashmiris , whose fight for independence intensified in 1990 . An estimated 8 # 300 people have died in the conflict in the past three years . &quot; They cannot pronounce that this ( territory ) is part of India and still say that we want to negotiate , &quot; said Shaharyar M . Khan , the Pakistani foreign_minister two days after the talks . In his office is a life-sized portrait of Pakistan ' s founding_father , Mohammad Ali Jinnah , who first proposed partition from India and the creation of a Muslim state . &quot; How can you begin to negotiate if the other party says this territory is non-negotiable. &quot; Indian officials contend that Kashmir -- the northwest mountainous region given to India by the Maharajah Hari Singh in 1947 -- is an integral part of India . The conflict , they say , represents a domestic law-and-order problem . They accuse Pakistan of aiding the militants . In response , Pakistani leaders claim that the people of Kashmir must decide in a plebiscite whether they want to remain with India or become a part of Pakistan , as envisioned by the 1949 U.N. resolutions on the settlement of Kashmir . With little new_to say , the talks seemed doomed from the start . Public statements issued from Islamabad before the meeting came_across as antagonistic . Senate resolutions virtually tied the hands of Pakistan ' s negotiators . &quot; An impression was created that the obituary of the talks was being written before they were even held , &quot; said India ' s High_Commissioner to Pakistan , S.K. Lambah . &quot; In spite of that we decided to go_ahead with the talks. &quot; At a joint news_conference , the foreign secretaries proclaimed the talks a small step_forward in Indo-Pak relations . Within a week , however , a war of words erupted across the border . Indian Prime_Minister Narasimha Rao said , in reference_to Pakistan , that India was ready to combat any external threat at any time . Pakistan ' s foreign_minister , Sardar Assef Ahmad Ali , warned that a nuclear war might engulf South Asia if Pakistan ' s territorial dispute with India weren ' t resolved . Negotiations seemed only to inflame tensions between the two countries . So why did India and Pakistan agree to talks on Kashmir ? Both sides apparently agreed to meet to appease growing international pressure . India wants a permanent seat on the U.N. Security_Council . Instigating talks with Pakistan would show the international_organization that it is serious about defusing the tension in Kashmir , where it is accused of violating human_rights . Pakistan wants to improve relations with the United States . Late last year , it agreed to withdraw a U.N. resolution criticizing India ' s human-rights violations in Kashmir , and to talk with India , at the behest of the United States . In October , 1990 , the United States froze relations , along with aid , to Pakistan when it became apparent that Pakistan was capable of building a nuclear bomb . The United States sees a solution to Kashmir as a first_step toward solving nuclear non-proliferation in the region . Pakistan agrees the two issues are related . &quot; We feel insecure , because we are the smaller of the two , and for 40 years we have gotten the short end of the stick . If Kashmir is settled , then this issue of non-proliferation is easy to solve , &quot; said Pakistan ' s High_Commissioner to India Riaz Khokar . &quot; Our insecurity results because of our fear of India . We have a major problem that is outstanding with them. &quot; But India does not want to see the nuclear issue linked to negotiations on Kashmir . It would not view a Pakistan offer to allow inspections of its nuclear plants as a concession , according to senior Pakistani officials . India needs to maintain its nuclear threat to balance power with China to its north . If Pakistan agrees to inspections , India also might be pressured to agree to inspections with no guarantee that China will do the same . The real reason for the hardening of positions after the recent talks was a concern for public_opinion back home . Prime_Minister Benazir Bhutto received heat from her opposition in Parliament for agreeing to withdraw the U.N. resolution against India and sit_down to talks . The Muslim League began a campaign to paint her fledgling government as having betrayed the people of Kashmir and sacrificing Pakistan ' s interests . The talks lack public support in Pakistan , where the issue of Kashmir is integrally linked to Pakistani national identity . The entire justification for partition rests_on the premise that Muslims need a separate homeland to escape Hindu domination . Pakistan ' s Senate passed a resolution , even before the foreign secretaries began talking , urging the government not to enter into any separate agreements on Siachen glacier , where thousands of Indian and Pakistani troops have been engaged in an expensive battle for more_than a decade . Each year , more soldiers die as a result of avalanches and frostbite than they do from enemy fire . Hopes were high that progress would be made on Siachen because both sides would benefit financially from ending this conflict , but now both sides are backtracking away from agreements . If Pakistan were serious about a breakthrough , it would be discussing independence as a third option for the Kashmiris , but Bhutto has made_it clear there are only two options : integration with India or integration with Pakistan . Public outcry also would erupt in India should its negotiators concede anything on Kashmir . If India were to agree to a plebiscite in Kashmir , other separatist movements might gain momentum . In both India and Pakistan the emotional attachment to Kashmir is too strong for any major progress_to take_place at the foreign-secretary level . At that level , the spotlight is_on both parties to take a hard line . If the two sides had really wanted a breakthrough , more behind-the-scenes negotiations would have taken_place at a lower level so that the foreign secretaries could simply finalize the agreements . Why should the international community be concerned that the talks failed and that tensions are once again high between India and Pakistan ? For one , the dispute remains a flash_point with the potential for confrontation . Both sides have nuclear capability and , on more_than one occasion , they have threatened nuclear war . At present , it seems unlikely that the two sides will return to the negotiating table . The tactics being used are designed to win support at_home and abroad , not to resolve the conflict . The Pakistani foreign_minister ' s statement that nuclear war could sweep Asia , should the conflict not be resolved , is designed to draw the United States and others into bilateral dispute and raise international concern about the plight of the Kashmiris . Later this month , Bhutto plans to be in Switzerland , where she may lead a delegation to Geneva to table a resolution against India at a meeting of the U.N. Human-Rights Commission . Such a move may score points at_home , but will speed resumption of talks between the two powers , which represent nearly one-fifth of the world ' s population . For this reason , we should be concerned .</TEXT>
