   <HEADLINE> REPORTER ' S NOTEBOOK ; CLINTON A GLASS ACT AS VODKA FLOWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A leader needs intestinal fortitude for the hard work of summits , and perhaps fortitude of the liver as well . President Clinton has the endurance of a draft_animal when it comes_to doing without sleep , but this jaunt to Eastern Europe is also testing his ability to absorb vodka in a region where real men are expected to down it by the glass . In the diplomatic equivalent of a drop-by in Kiev on Wednesday night , Clinton politely matched Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk belt-for-several-belts . On Thursday night , he moved_on to Moscow , where the schedule called_for a &quot; working dinner &quot; with Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin that threatened to turn_into a &quot; drinking dinner , &quot; one aide joked . Aides insisted Clinton could take it , but when he arrived in Moscow in the wee hours of Thursday after his session with Kravchuk , the President headed for a restorative session in the sauna . Hours later , in his first encounter with Yeltsin at the Kremlin , Clinton -- who had only about three hours ' sleep -- was &quot; a little bleary , &quot; the official conceded . * In their first day in Moscow , the Americans traveling with Clinton witnessed a bit of the casual attitude toward work that challenges Russian efforts to develop a free-market economy . A shuttle_bus had been set_up to relay White_House staff and press between the two hotels where they are quartered , but it was largely put_out of action by drivers whose labors seemed to be guided more by their whims than their instructions . Coffee and lunch breaks , not to mention the disco music playing in one hotel , seemed to consume most of their time . One driver had installed a portable television_set beside the steering_wheel and couldn ' t seem to tear his eyes from a soap_opera as he piloted his lumbering vehicle across the traffic-choked and ice-slick boulevards . Yet there were also signs of stirring capitalist initiative . Moscow ' s IPCC-M Bar and Grill joined a number of taverns in the formerly Communist and free_worlds that have tried the marketing gimmick of inviting Clinton to play his saxophone on their premises . It doesn ' t always work , of course , but it can be counted_on to generate attention . &quot; Isn ' t it time you blew_off a little steam ? &quot; the cafe asked Clinton , and music_lovers , in a flyer . * They have lost their savings , their incomes and some even their homes . But in this winter of hardship , Russians will have bananas . Or at least pieces of bananas . Chiquita Brands International Inc. is handing_out 10 million of its bananas in this depressed nation . that ' s only one for every 17 Russians , but the company plans to concentrate its effort by giving them to Muscovite children , hospital patients and the poor . At a promotional cocktail_party , State_Department officials and press ate bananas and mingled with young Russian women wearing Carmen Miranda-style , plastic-fruit headgear . The project taught the company a lesson about Russian power_structure that might be useful to Clinton as he tries to cultivate Yeltsin . Chiquita first approached officials of the national government to arrange the gift , but then switched the effort when city officials told them there was no point . &quot; Why mess with them ? &quot; a city official asked . &quot; They have no money , no power. &quot; * A Moscow supper_club owned by a New Yorker ran an ad in the English-language Moscow Times on the eve of Clinton ' s arrival listing the &quot; Top 10 Reasons Bill_Clinton Should Eat at Manhattan Express. &quot; Aside from reason No . 9 ( &quot; Neil Bush was here so we need a bigger Democrat to tip the scales the right way &quot; ) , there were many references_to the President ' s second priority on his Moscow trip : food . &quot; 10 . We are closer to the Kremlin than McDonald ' s. &quot; &quot; 8 . Pizza Hut only allows one trip to the salad bar. &quot; &quot; 5 . we ' ll send_out for jelly doughnuts. &quot; * There was also a lot of talk in the Russian papers about where Clinton would sleep and change clothes during his three nights in the Russian_capital . His decision to spend the first two nights in the American-run Radisson Slavjanskaya Hotel instead of at Spaso House prompted the Itar-Tass headline : &quot; Clinton Prefers Flashy Hotel to Ambassador ' s Residence. &quot; The Itar-Tass reporter was miffed when hotel authorities would not tell him what floor Clinton ' s $ 800-a-night suite was_on . Times staff writer Doyle McManus and Steven Gutterman of the Moscow Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
