   <HEADLINE> REALITY COOKING ; CONFESSIONS OF A FORMER FOODIE ; FROM FIVE-COURSE DINNERS AND AN EVER-SIMMERING STOCKPOT TO SALAD IN A BAG AND 20-MINUTE SOUPS , A FOODIE EMBRACES...</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Yes , I am the person who in a different life cooked 13-course dinners . ( I have witnesses , living today. ) I am the person who entertained more_than once a week in a wide variety of strange and wonderful cuisines . ( Duck feet , anyone ? ) I am the person whose 20-gallon stock pot was used so often the wallpaper in her apartment peeled_off like a bad sunburn . I am the person who catered her own wedding_reception , for heaven ' s sake . Now I am the person who schedules a dinner for friends at 5:30 and starts cooking at 3:30 , following an unexpected visit to my four-year-old ' s doctor ' s office . I am the person who invites the editor of a sophisticated food magazine to dinner and gives her laundry to fold while cans of this and that are -- artfully , of course -- tossed together . * I am the person who sometimes wears two different shoes to work and doesn ' t realize it until late in the afternoon . We ' re talking reality here , not a women ' s magazine version of dinner at the table served by a perky , smiling mother with a manicure . We ' re talking two working parents , play dates , swimming lessons , symphony-opera-shopping-thinking-reading-bicycle-riding days , nights and weekends that seem to dissolve into black_holes of time . I go_to_bed in January , and when I get_up , it ' s July . ( Am I the only one this is happening to ? ) Since the birth of my son and the disintegration of time as I previously knew it , I have learned a_few things about cooking , time management and perspective . Life , eating and entertainment now revolve_around three things : a little boy ' s play , good_health and happiness . This does not allow time for elaborate dinners or dinner_parties . Nor , strangely , do they seem necessary . Our friends have not abandoned us for better cooks ; we are still invited back for dinner , even if the dessert we serve is M &amp; Ms and ice_cream sandwiches ; we are not overeating from food boredom ( overeating , perhaps , but for sport ) ; nor are we seriously malnourished , despite the fact that this month my son seems to be eating only black_beans , rice and Popsicles . There are a_few things we have stubbornly refused to abandon , however . Good food is one . Having friends over for dinner or brunch a_couple_of times a month is another . ( Not only is this fun , it saves money on baby-sitters. ) * Eating out is reserved for social_occasions , rather than for evenings when we ' re too tired or too late at_work to cook . On those nights we probably crack open a can of low-fat , low-salt soup , which we then make less healthy with the addition of soy_sauce or cheese or something else with character and / or fat . For us , carryout seems too expensive and , more important , too_much like work , since it needs to be picked_up . Fast-food is something I ' m just not ready for . To avoid desperate mid-week straits , I plan a little , use convenience products when they work and try to do something useful every second of the day . Julia Child once said to me , &quot; Never apologize ! &quot; and that has become my mantra . Here is what I am not apologizing for : Convenience products such_as cake_mixes that I once thought overpriced are now tucked very nicely into our eating life . And they do more_than just save time . Bakery-bought cupcakes , for example , cost $ 3 to $ 5 for a dozen , as against $ 2 for a box of mix , plus a can of frosting ( on sale ) that comes packaged with attractive candy sprinkles for decoration . Of no small importance , there ' s the entertainment value of watching a 4-year-old spray the walls with chocolate from an electric_mixer . And the pride of someone who hasn ' t yet mastered shoe-tying when he frosts a finished cupcake and tops it off with colorful , unhealthy candy . Cake_mixes are not just for children , though . Adults can enjoy them if they are properly topped , say with low-fat ice_cream drizzled with caramel , sprinkled with chopped and partially melted Heath Bar candy . ( Those watching their weight can substitute non-fat brownies for the cake. ) * Then there ' s the microwave_oven , about which I vaguely ( in that other life ) remember saying , &quot; Why would anyone want one ? &quot; As an example of our family ' s new reality-based style , when ours broke on a quiet Sunday morning we dressed quickly , hopped in the car and dashed around town looking_for a replacement . Why ? Roast chicken needs to be rewarmed . Baked potatoes , which take_on the texture of Styrofoam when microwaved , can be baked in the real oven in the morning before work and then successfully reheated in a couple minutes in a microwave at dinner time . But the microwave ' s chief and most valuable talents are reheating cooked rice ( prepared in large batches in the rice cooker and kept_in the refrigerator for several days ) and steaming certain vegetables such_as broccoli and baby carrots . It can also be used for heating grilled chicken and cheese quesadillas . Black_beans and rice . Cooked pasta and tomato_sauce . Grilled fish . In short , the once disdained microwave now prepares most week-night dinners . But the key to week-day survival , I ' m convinced , is shopping only once a week . This forces planning , a modest amount of self-discipline and , despite the threatening nature of such a commitment , actually makes life easier . So on weekends -- usually Saturday mornings , early -- I pull_out recipes or recipe ideas I ' ve collected in a file . Whether we ' re entertaining that weekend or not , I plan two dishes to cook on the weekend , plus one surprise to keep things interesting . This fills four or five dinner slots . The others seem to take_care of themselves with pizza or dinner out or at a friend ' s house . And there ' s always the 10 gallons of something ( often Prego spaghetti_sauce ) bought_in a ravenously hungry moment at Costco . * On one recent weekend I made a wonderful , fall-apart roasted lemon chicken ; tabbouleh ( inspired by lemons given to me by a friend ) ; a salad made of tomato , onion and stale Italian_bread chunks tossed with salt , pepper and a little olive_oil ; and lastly , a too-garlicky hummus that we devoured with pita bread . This carried us through the better part of the week , when we added steamed rice , canned black_beans and packaged chopped and pre-washed salad . ( This is expensive , I know , but it seems like a good alternative to week-night salad spinning . . . just too_much exercise on an empty stomach. ) On another recent Sunday we grilled , but not just for one meal and not indoors -- where we have a perfectly fine stove-top grill . The reason : I ' m in_charge of the indoor grill , but my husband rules -- and cleans -- the grill outdoors . And so he grilled , at a single standing : Italian sausage , salmon , shrimp , chicken and a huge pile of vegetables , including sliced potatoes ( in their skins -- peeling is too_much work ) sprinkled with olive_oil , fresh rosemary and coarse salt . From that single barbecue we reaped grilled sausage for dinner that night ( and for freezing in small servings as a future treasure ) ; grilled swordfish , part of which was consumed the next night with grilled vegetables and two nights later in seafood-vegetable burritos ; grilled shrimp , which ended_up a couple days later in whole-wheat pasta with a spicy peanut sauce . . . Indonesian in spirit , if not literal translation . The only cooking we do during the week occurs in the morning before work -- say , around 5:30 , when sane people are sleeping and the day is_quiet and cool . That actually is a good time to toss together a soup , so that it can steep in the refrigerator all day and taste even better by evening . A simple tomato soup with white_beans and pasta ( 15 minutes ) is one . Stir-fried sirloin soup is another . Chicken gumbo is a third . Minestrone soup with fresh and frozen vegetables is another . ( Frozen corn and limas and canned tomatoes are just fine. ) Nothing I make in the morning takes longer than 30 minutes , provided the ingredients are handy . I make_sure they are . * Potatoes for dinner that night can be baked in the morning . Vegetables can be chopped for a quick evening stir-fry of hot-and-sour broccoli we eat with commercially made egg_rolls . Corn bread from a mix can be popped into the oven and baked to serve that evening with canned vegetarian chili and grated cheese . But if weeknight meals are survival of the hungriest , weekend entertaining is where the fun is . And , of utmost importance , where the good leftovers are . that ' s where we find easy meals of grilled tandoori chicken , served with jicama and carrot cole slaw ( 3 cups grated jicama tossed with 1 cup grated carrot and a_few tablespoons of bottled sesame dressing ) , apple rice , naan bread from a nearby Indian grocery_store ( substitute whole-wheat tortillas in a pinch ) , bottled chutney and plain yogurt spiked with a little cumin and salt . Another applauded company meal is Cuban in spirit : fried plantain chips ( greasy , salty , delicious , sold in bags in some supermarkets and Latino groceries ) and beer followed by Cuban picadillo ( a ground_beef dish with capers , raisins and olives ) , yellow rice ( plain rice tinted with turmeric ) , canned black_beans and salad from the bag . For dessert we share a platter of sliced Muenster cheese and chunks of guava paste ( from a Latino market ) , a traditional Puerto Rican-style dessert served with very strong coffee in espresso cups . ( Espresso is also too_much work. ) An al fresco -style meal we like combines any or all_of the following : cannellini ( white kidney ) beans tossed with tons of fresh , chopped oregano and black_pepper , tomato , canned tuna and a fruity green_olive oil ; pasta with pesto ( if there ' s any in the freezer -- garlic and olive_oil if there ' s not ) , or maybe wild mushrooms and lemon , if I ' m trying to impress ; a_few bowls of olives ( including Trader Joe ' s great garlic-stuffed green ones ) ; fresh mozzarella with tomatoes ; grilled peppers ( frozen from an earlier grill-out ) , marinated mushrooms or asparagus and a_few kinds of bread -- maybe homemade , maybe not . * One of our favorite entertaining meals is brunch , both because it is easy and because looking good on Sunday morning somehow seems rude -- thus , the food gets all_the preparation time . Among the popular brunch menus at our house : fresh orange_juice ( my husband ' s job ) and sparkling_wine , banana-buttermilk-wheat germ-pecan-honey pancakes with pourable raspberry yogurt and syrup , a fresh fruit platter ( another job for my husband ) and fried sausages ( usually &quot; lite &quot; ) . Of late I have served cornmeal pancakes made with corn-bread mix thinned to pouring consistency with milk and served with orange-honey butter and pureed berries ( they ' re simply overripe berries sieved just before they go_bad and tucked into the freezer for just such an occasion ) . Another easy brunch menu : packaged tostada salad shells used as a container for eggs of any kind ( probably fried for adults and scrambled for children ) and a dollop each of sour_cream , guacamole , tomato salsa and black_beans topped with grated cheese . Serve this with margaritas or limeade . Although I ' ve written two books on appetizers , I seldom make them any more except as entrees . Too time-consuming . One such former starter turned meal is chicken-and-cheese quesadillas with black_bean and corn salsa . This takes minutes when made with already shredded cheese and previously grilled chicken , plucked from the freezer . * In theory , at least , there are still special occasions for which nothing is too difficult , too complicated or too silly . . . just like in the old days . The weird thing is , I just never seem to find the time . Maybe this is where the priority shift is most apparent . For my son ' s first pre-school fund-raising event , I rose at 4:30 a.m. on a work_day to make a fancy dessert designed to bring huge profits to the organization and honor my son ' s good name . When I arrived with the treasure I noticed everyone else unloading bags of packaged cookies and bakery boxes . I took this as a sign . Now when the need arises , I ask myself this question : Does_it make more sense to play with him or spend hours messing_up the kitchen ? If the answer is play , I head for a bakery . Thus , when I was recently asked , mid-week , to bring_in a home-cooked dish for a school lunch two days later , I picked_up the phone and dialed Pizza Hut , later explaining to the school that pizza is a traditional end-of-the-week family treat . They smiled . ( Was that sympathy or disdain ? ) I did not apologize .
