   <HEADLINE> THE NATION ; THE SINKING FEELING THAT MAY COST US $ 100 MILLION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In May , 1992 , a security_guard at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Weeks Island , a coastal finger off South Louisiana , walked into sinking soil . He pulled himself out , but govern ment officials found themselves in a $ 100-million quagmire . that ' s the estimated cost , according to Department_of_Energy and reserve officials , of relocating 73 million barrels of oil stored in a converted salt_mine to other sites along the Louisiana-Texas coast . Engineers monitoring ground_water flow into the chamber , at a rate of 2 gallons a minute , consider closure inevitable . Short of that , there is a risk of environmental damage and oil loss . The department ' s $ 100-million mistake throws a spotlight on the sometimes sophistry of science and on how government myopically funds projects that nature resists . Begun after the 1973 Arab oil embargo , the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a $ 4.5-billion federal program that oversees storage of 750 million barrels of oil , a six-week emergency backup in the event of a national supply interruption . In 1975 , department planners concluded that underground caverns located in deep salt domes were the best storage sites . Of the six sites the Energy_Department bought , Weeks Island stood apart because it had once been a salt_mine . The soil sinkage is actually on land owned by the Morton Salt Company , which does commercial mining on most of the island . The Energy_Department bought the oil-storage site from Morton for $ 40 million in 1978 , building a complex worth $ 222 million today . Morton had an existing system of subterranean chambers and corridors that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve simply converted to hold oil . Oil is now pushing_up , causing a split in the upper ridge that is softened by water flowing down . Sinkholes aren ' t unusual in salt mining . Old mine roofs can gradually give_way , creating stresses in the crystalographic formation . But with petroleum stored in a cavity , geologists and engineers have no access to the interior to fix the problem . &quot; Any structures under ground could be impacted , &quot; says Wilma Subra , a chemist and environmental activist in New Iberia who has been critical of the the reserve . Marshes and wetlands on Weeks Island are &quot; a fragile environment , &quot; she adds . &quot; Even though all_the experts say the salt will maintain its integrity when you store ( oil ) in it , things start to happen. &quot; Concerns about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve began trickling out_in a 1984 report by Sandia , a government research laboratory in Albuquerque , N.M. : &quot; The geometry of the Weeks Island salt dome has been defined by Morton based on subsurface geophysics and shallow drilling . Dome contours and top-of-salt elevations from the shallow drilling were provided to the ( Department_of_Energy ) in 1977 during the acquisition of the mine , but no attempt has been made to verify the dome geometry . In addition , none of the geophysical or drilling data used in defining the dome geometry were obtained from Morton during any previous investigation. &quot; &quot; that ' s pretty risky -- going in and accepting those data . . . with that much storage of oil , &quot; says Dr. Louis Dellwig , retired professor of geology at University of Kansas and a salt-dome expert , when asked about the report . &quot; They saved a nickel but it ' s going_to cost them a lot of dimes . I would have thought they ' d have done their own geophysical work . You drill down and learn where the salt is. &quot; But drilling for subsurface samples to determine dimensions of the salt would have been expensive . Or the reserve could have injected water into a cavity , flushing out more space . The cheapest route -- conversion of the mine -- led to a $ 100-million hole . The reserve ' s site management at Weeks Island was subcontracted to Boeing Petroleum Services , which was criticized for shoddy environmental practices in a 1992 internal Department_of_Energy investigation . The report specifically mentioned subsidence rates at Weeks Island and &quot; concern regarding possible salt fractures in the vicinity of the shafts , which could , in turn , lead to water incursion into the mine. &quot; The sinkhole developed several months later . In 1993 , with government defense spending waning , Boeing scaled back its petroleum operations outside of Seattle and did not rebid for the Weeks Island contract . It suffered no penalties for the abundant failures cited by its government-check dispenser . At least two geologists on the reserve project believe it should continue operations . One of them says a Department_of_Energy pullout reflects &quot; an ultraconservative atmosphere . If they wanted to take chances down the road , they could continue with the project . . . . But if ( they ) make a wrong guess and there ' s a major collapse , you ' re looking_at millions of barrels of oil flowing to the surface . So they ' re taking the safest route. &quot; Engineers are pumping salt water into the sinkhole to reduce its rate of collapse , while mapping transfer plans -- by pipe , ship and rail -- of the oil to other sites . A phase-out decision by Secretary Hazel O ' Leary would make Weeks Island the second Strategic Petroleum Reserve site decommissioned by her department . In 1990 , the Sulphur_Mines site , also in Louisiana , with a 26-million barrel capacity , was shut_down and sold for $ 400 # 000 . The Energy_Department decided it was more cost-effective to store the oil at Big Hill , near Beaumont , Texas . Most of the oil at Weeks Island will probably go_to Big Hill as well , which has the largest storage capacity : 160 million barrels . &quot; I guess if there ' s any lesson here , it ' s that without good information , it ' s impossible to make decisions that are reliable , &quot; says William A . Fontenot , community liaison officer for environmental quality in the state_attorney general ' s office . &quot; The history of industrial development in Louisiana is that projects are justified after the decision is made to go_ahead with them rather than by determining upfront what the possible adverse impacts and costs are going_to be -- the real risks to human health , the environment and the economy. &quot; Similarly , the history of defense industries since the Vietnam_War is littered with boondoggles and cost-overruns . The Strategic Petroleum Reserve ' s sinkhole does not suggest corruption -- just incompetence .</TEXT>
