   <HEADLINE> HOSPITALS LAX ON QUAKE READINESS , BOARD SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Members of the California Seismic Safety Commission said Friday that hospitals in the state were not meeting their responsibility in maintaining earthquake safety standards . L . Thomas Tobin , executive_director of the commission , said that hospitals were trying to shed &quot; their responsibility &quot; for making older hospitals , built to outdated safety standards , safer for patients and health_care workers . &quot; Somebody has to stand_up and take responsibility , &quot; Tobin said after listening to a hospital spokesman say that California hospitals believed_in upgrading their safety standards but did not have enough money to accomplish it . The issue of hospitals ' preparedness for an earthquake surfaced during the second day of a two-day commission hearing in Van Nuys at which there was testimony about issues concerning the need to upgrade building_codes , building methods and the design and engineering process . Despite earthquake damage that forced the closure of several hospitals and the evacuation of nearly 1 # 000 patients , Roger Richter , senior_vice_president of the California Assn . of Hospitals and Health Systems , told the commission that hospital officials were &quot; satisfied &quot; with their performance . Richter told the commission : &quot; We are proud_of the way our hospitals functioned both during and after the earthquake. &quot; M . Neal Hardman , with the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development , backed him up , agreeing that hospitals held_up as well as could be expected . As a result of the earthquake , six hospitals and medical_buildings suffered such major structural damage that they were shut_down . In those hospitals , ceilings collapsed , walls buckled and floors gave_way . In addition , more_than a dozen hospitals faced serious problems when mechanical_systems failed . Gas_mains blew , oxygen systems failed , sewage backed_up , water_supplies were lost , and emergency generators failed . Bill Iwan , chairman of the Seismic Safety Commission , said that considering those results , &quot; I was disappointed in the response of the hospitals . I personally do not consider the performance of the hospitals in this earthquake to be acceptable . We just cannot have a large_number of hospitals become non-functional during an earthquake. &quot; Most problems developed in facilities built before 1973 , the year tougher earthquake standards were placed on hospitals . About 70 % of California ' s hospitals were built before 1973 . The hospital association , which represents about 500 hospitals , estimates that it would cost $ 20 billion to retrofit all those facilities so that they meet current regulations . Hospital officials said that hospitals are replaced every 30 to 40 years , and that ultimately all hospitals will be upgraded . But commission members said that time frame was not acceptable . Later in the day , Warren O ' Brien , general_manager of the Los Angeles Building and Safety Department , said he has urged the City_Council to require buildings similar to the Northridge Meadows apartments -- where 16 people died when it collapsed -- to be repaired_to 1989 standards if they are to be reoccupied . &quot; It is inconceivable to me to allow them to go_back and rebuild to a 1976 code , &quot; he said . The 1989 code would require all supporting walls to be reinforced with sheets of plywood , making them more resistant to lateral displacement .</TEXT>
