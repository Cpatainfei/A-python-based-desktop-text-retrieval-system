   <HEADLINE> THE NATION ; SONY ' S WOES IN HOLLYWOOD REFLECT ITS WEAKNESS IN ' KNOWLEDGE VALUE ' INDUSTRIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sony Corp. ' s shocking announcement that it will write-down its Hollywood investment in Columbia Pictures by $ 2.7 billion highlights a major reason why Japan ' s once unstoppable economic juggernaut is slowing . Having built their economic empire on an indigenous aptitude for craftsmanship and innovation , Japanese companies like Sony are colliding_with the limits imposed by an insular culture . Sony ' s foray_into Hollywood , like that of its competitor Matsushita Industrial Electrical Co. , which owns MCA / Universal , has been hampered by its misunderstanding of the creative forces that go_into a world-dominant entertainment product . Unlike the design , development and manufacture of a electronic gadget , the making of a successful film or record product demands an intuitive feel_for the sensibilities of a diverse , global public . &quot; The Japanese tend to think from their own internal logic , the point_of_view of the company or family , &quot; Sony Deputy President Ken Iwaki told me not long after his company bought Columbia in 1989 . &quot; This is historically derived training . We get strong economic power but our awareness is not so strong. &quot; To obviate their self-perceived cultural shortcomings , Sony and Matsushita purposely placed direct control of their studios into the hands of Americans . To a large extent , the relative success of Matsushita is a consequence of its decision to retain the strong management team already in place at MCA . Thus , the new Japanese owners did not alienate the studio ' s network of creative contacts . Sony , by contrast , bought a lackluster studio and proceeded to compound its problems by replacing one set of weak old-boy-network managers with another of_their_own choosing . Furthermore , it transferred the authority to make key entertainment decisions to a New York-based executive who lacked studio experience . He stood_by as his West Coast minions spent their yen on friends and family with an alacrity alarming even by Hollywood standards . Of course , even relatively talented Americans can prove quarrelsome , as Matsushita is finding_out in its struggle with Sidney Sheinberg and his creative allies over control of MCA . Moreover , with as_many as two or three new studios in the offing , &quot; hands-off &quot; Japanese owners now find themselves exposed and vulnerable to the migratory patterns of the entertainment complexes , both managerial and creative . Such behavior is utterly at_odds with the system of lifetime employment and corporate loyalty prevalent in Japan . Taichi Kiuchi , president of Mitsubishi Electric , another Japanese consumer electronics giant , traces much of the Japanese inability to &quot; learn &quot; entertainment management to the highly subjective nature of the business . &quot; Japanese companies have a whole_lot of problems when there ' s no blueprint or manual to learn from , &quot; he says . &quot; We don ' t have any advantage in this business , which is a human product , not a machine . We don ' t have the diversity of population to make the creative cultural decisions. &quot; Japan ' s home-grown entertainment , it should be noted , has been losing market share to mostly U.S.-made products for a decade . The Japanese setbacks in entertainment also augur trouble for its economy . As wealthier countries are forced to cede much of mass manufacturing to developing countries , companies and regions will have to increasingly concentrate_on what Japanese philosopher Taichi Sakaiya calls &quot; knowledge value &quot; industries , like fashion , entertainment and business services . By treating &quot; knowledge value &quot; industries as if they were strictly industrial , the Japanese have suffered a score of reversals not only in Hollywood but in computer software , financial services and real_estate . In contrast to making cars or CD_players , &quot; knowledge value &quot; industries are culturally intensive . Understanding the importance of taste , or subtleties in cultural norms , is often more important in these fields than pure efficiency . Perhaps nowhere is this misunderstanding more evident than in the idea of &quot; synergy &quot; between &quot; hardware &quot; and &quot; software. &quot; In the period leading_up to and during the Japanese acquisitions of Columbia and MCA , synergy was a buzzword . Stock analysts , studio chieftains and corporate strategists incessantly crowed about the natural feedback mechanism between software development -- a Hollywood strength -- and the electronics hardware manufactured by the_likes_of Sony and Matsushita . Five years later , it is virtually impossible to find any real evidence of Japanese core-electronics businesses having benefited from Hollywood acquisitions . Sony video cameras , for example , are sold to all studios and independent producers . No one goes_to a Sony Pictures movie expecting to find one iota of technical perfection greater than that of any other studio . As one Sony executive admitted to the New Yorker magazine , the company had learned little from its ownership of Columbia , except that &quot; We see there are up and downs in Hollywood. &quot; Certainly , Sony and Matsushita ' s move_into Hollywood has not enabled them to gain share_in any of the conceivable spinoffs -- from special_effects and animation to multimedia -- of conventional entertainment . Instead , the winners have mostly been smaller , California-based upstart firms and a handful of independent Japanese game-makers , notably Nintendo and Sega , though they , too , are experiencing slower growth in their historic core businesses . As the entertainment age unfolds , the siren song of synergy is likely to entrap many U.S. competitors as well . During the past year , as the hype surrounding the information superhighway has intensified , many U.S. telephone , technology and publishing giants have poured billions into entertainment-related ventures -- almost always justified by some vague synergy between the company ' s core business and Hollywood . Today , for example , corporate_executives -- including those at MCA -- are doling out cash and kudos to hyper-hyped Silicon_Valley electronics_companies , like 3DO , while eschewing any fundamental attempt to understand the intricacies of the highly fragmented entertainment complex . Lured by the mirage of synergy , the large companies continue to miss the basic point : that the real source of profits in the &quot; knowledge value &quot; economy are such talents as design and the ability to tell a story and develop characters . In the 1990s , those set_up for the biggest fall will be computer software mega-stars , like Microsoft ' s Bill Gates , whose minions are invading Hollywood with their own brand of technological determinism . Like the Japanese with their financial and industrial ascendancy in the 1980s , the techies think their computer-software domination makes them ideally positioned to absorb the markets traditionally enjoyed by the Hollywood fantasy factories . For the Japanese , their unfortunate foray_into Hollywood movie making should serve as a warning to keep their distance from industries in which they have no expertise . It also exposes , in a dramatic way , the fault_lines in the once highly touted Japanese management style .</TEXT>
