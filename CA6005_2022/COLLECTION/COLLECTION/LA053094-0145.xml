   <HEADLINE> ERICH HONECKER , MASTERMIND OF BERLIN WALL , DIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Erich Honecker , the former East_German Communist leader who built the Cold_War ' s most chilling monument , the infamous Berlin Wall , died of liver cancer Sunday at his home_in exile here . He was 81 . Honecker , who ruled for 18 years before the collapse of communism , had lived_in Chile with his wife and his daughter ' s family since January , 1993 , when Berlin judges ruled he was too ill to stand trial in connection with shootings at the Berlin Wall . He lived his final days in sickness and bitterness , according to Chilean friends , still a committed Communist who fretted about the &quot; social deterioration &quot; of a unified Germany . Although Honecker led the Communist East_German state between 1971 and 1989 , he will be remembered most for what he did long before -- building the Wall . In many ways , the structure served as a metaphor for the uncompromising , neo-Stalinist views Honecker held throughout his rule . His regime fostered the most pervasive secret_police organization in Communist Europe , penned in its people and shot those who tried to flee to the West . Honecker ' s successor as head of the East_German state , Egon Krenz , pleaded Sunday for &quot; a fair judgment &quot; of Honecker ' s life , saying , &quot; He wanted to realize the dream of humanism. &quot; But a spokesman for German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that Honecker had failed in his political goals . &quot; His policies brought harm to countless people , &quot; government spokesman Dieter Vogel said . &quot; Erich Honecker failed . Perhaps he didn ' t recognize it , but history gave proof of his failure. &quot; On Sunday , news of Honecker ' s death drew shrugs of indifference in his homeland . &quot; At this point , I couldn ' t care less about Honecker , and I ' m sure the same goes_for most east_Germans , &quot; said Klaus Sternberg , a teacher in Schwerin . &quot; He ' s in heaven now , and he can sit_down with Marx , Engels and Lenin and think_over what went_wrong , &quot; said Lutz Wagner , a salesman in eastern Berlin . In the early part of his years in power , Honecker enjoyed success . But later , poor health , advanced age and political isolation left him increasingly vulnerable to the winds of change sweeping the region . An unbending hard-liner , he disliked the Soviet_Union ' s reform-minded leader , Mikhail S . Gorbachev , and was deeply suspicious of the liberalization under way in other parts of Moscow ' s empire . In the end , Honecker was toppled by massive anti-government street demonstrations that marked the decisive phase of the 1989 East_German revolution . His control over the East_German state had been so complete , and his fall so sudden , that Politburo colleagues who witnessed his political demise said Honecker was incapable of grasping what had happened . Krenz has said that when he informed the ousted leader of his expulsion from the Communist_Party , Honecker &quot; had not understood at all &quot; the contents of the message . In his 1980 memoirs , &quot; About My Life , &quot; Honecker described proudly how , as the Politburo member responsible_for state security , he organized the operation that in a matter of a_few pre-dawn hours on Aug . 13 , 1961 , cut one of Europe ' s largest cities in two , closed the last remaining hole in the Iron_Curtain and stunned the West . &quot; At midnight the alarm was sounded and the action began , &quot; he wrote . &quot; With it began an operation that . . . would make the world take_notice . Later we determined with satisfaction that we had forgotten nothing essential ( in the preparations ) . &quot; The 100-mile-long , heavily fortified wall through and around West_Berlin endured for 28 years as the most compelling symbol of an ideologically divided world . It was almost 10 years after supervising the Wall ' s construction that Honecker succeeded Walter Ulbricht as Communist_Party boss and de_facto East_German leader . Honecker was driven from power three weeks before the Wall ' s collapse in November , 1989 , in a series of events that heralded the fall of Soviet Bloc communism itself . The concrete barrier that he and other members of the East_German hierarchy called the &quot; anti-fascist protection wall &quot; had effectively halted the westward flight of skilled manpower that threatened to bleed the Communist state to economic death . For all its horror , Western economic and political analysts subsequently admitted that the Wall enabled East_Germany to survive as a poorer neighbor of a highly successful West German state . Born Aug . 25 , 1912 , in the western town of Neunkirchen as the third of six children of a coal_miner , Honecker began his political career at age 10 by joining a Communist youth group . At 18 , he became a full party member , quickly taking_on responsibility in the Saarland region for stirring the party ' s youth into street actions during the tumultuous final days of Germany ' s Weimar Republic . Spotted by the party ' s leadership as a future talent , Honecker was sent to Moscow ' s Communist Youth International School for a year and returned to become youth propaganda chief for his home region at age 19 . After Adolf Hitler ' s Nazis seized power in 1933 , Honecker worked surreptitiously to stir resistance among factory_workers in several parts of Germany , including the industrial Ruhr_Valley . He was finally arrested in Berlin by the Nazi secret_police , the Gestapo , convicted in 1936 of treason and sentenced to 10 years in prison . He remained there until advancing Allied forces reached his prison , 30 miles west of Berlin , and freed him in the fading days of World_War_II . His comparatively light sentence and preferential treatment during his imprisonment led to persistent rumors that he had cooperated with his Nazi captors . Those rumors continued virtually to the end , with reports that at the crucial 1989 Politburo meeting where Honecker was toppled , East_German secret_police chief Erich Mielke finally forced a reluctant Honecker to give_up power by threatening to publicize apparently damning evidence relating to his actions in prison . After his release from prison in the Soviet-controlled occupation zone , Honecker , then 33 , joined the newly formed Communist hierarchy that would eventually lead the East_German state . Initially responsible_for the reconstituted Communist youth organization , the Free German Youth , he joined the Politburo as security chief in 1958 , later planning the Berlin Wall operation and emerging as Ulbricht ' s heir_apparent . During this period , he divorced his first wife and married Margot Feist , a youth group functionary , who eventually became his education minister . Also an unbending hard-liner , she was believed by many East_Germans to reinforce his allergy to reform . She remained with him to the end . In foreign affairs , Honecker concluded a treaty with West Germany in 1972 that formalized relations between the two states but avoided full mutual diplomatic recognition . The accord eased travel restrictions on westerners visiting East_Germany and permitted East_German pensioners to visit the West . It also paved the way for East_Germany ' s longed-for acceptance in the global community , giving it a U.N. seat and relations with key Western countries , including the United States , Britain and France . In 1984 , Honecker received Canadian Prime_Minister Pierre Trudeau , the first head of government from the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization to visit East Berlin , and three years later he crowned his achievements with an official trip to West Germany . Although Honecker signed the Helsinki Final Act_on security and human_rights along with other European leaders in 1975 , he kept East_Germany among the Soviet Bloc ' s most hard-line states . He also refined East_Germany ' s cynical policy of &quot; selling &quot; political_prisoners for badly needed Western goods and hard currency needed for economic development . Between the mid-1960s and the fall of the Berlin Wall , West Germany is believed to have paid about $ 2 billion for the freedom of a quarter-million East_Germans . Recent information has revealed that East_German judges were given quotas of people to sentence so that the supply of political_prisoners remained high enough to guarantee the needed hard-currency income . In his later years , the small , feisty Honecker became increasingly remote even from his own people , frequently delivering dry , uninspiring speeches in his strange , high-pitched lilt at such speed that he invariably swallowed his words . One party member invited to the inner sanctum of his government_offices for a reception in the mid-1980s was shocked that even in this safe , closed circle , Honecker remained distant and stiff . &quot; He marched in , sat_down , picked a paper from his pocket , read it and then left , &quot; the party member said . &quot; It was as if an invisible wall were between him and the rest of us. &quot; In a visit to East Berlin in early October , 1989 , Gorbachev urged Honecker to liberalize , warning him that &quot; history punishes those who delay. &quot; Within two weeks , Gorbachev ' s prediction became fact and Honecker was ousted by a panicky Politburo trying to save itself from being overwhelmed by the revolution . Mentally out of touch and suffering from liver cancer , Honecker was briefly arrested in January , 1990 , and charged with treason but was released 36 hours later for health reasons . Following German unification , the Bonn government_issued its own arrest_warrant for Honecker , this time on Wall-related manslaughter charges . But by then , Honecker had been moved to a Soviet military_hospital south of Berlin and the warrant could not be served . Apparently out of a sense of loyalty to a former fellow Communist leader , Gorbachev personally approved Honecker ' s secret flight to Moscow in March , 1991 , where he remained out_of_reach of German authorities . With the failure of the August , 1991 , coup in Moscow and the collapse of hard-line Soviet power , Honecker fled to the Chilean Embassy , where his friend , Clodomiro Almeyda , was ambassador . Honecker was eventually returned to Berlin in July , 1992 , to face_up to 75 criminal charges -- most of them linked to shooting deaths that occurred at the Berlin Wall during his rule . He was put_on trial a_few months later with Mielke and other members of the East_German regime in proceedings that some likened to the post-World War II trials of Nazi leaders at Nuremberg . But suffering from depression and advanced cancer , he was released for health reasons in January , 1993 , and allowed to fly to Chile . Long reported from Santiago , Chile , and Marshall reported from Berlin .</TEXT>
