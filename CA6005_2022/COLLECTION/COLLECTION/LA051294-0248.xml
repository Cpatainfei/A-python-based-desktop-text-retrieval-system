   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN , KOHL AGREE ON TROOPS ' PULLOUT CEREMONY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin on Wednesday dropped his objections to German plans for separate farewell ceremonies for the final withdrawal of Allied and Russian troops from Berlin this summer . In an apparent trade-off , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl gave Yeltsin his strong backing for an enlargement of the Group of Seven into a Group of Eight , including Russia . The G-7 is an organization made_up of the world ' s most powerful economies . The send-off of Russia ' s remaining 20 # 000 troops in Germany has been a prickly issue between the two governments for months . Aiming to assuage Russian feelings that their troops were getting shabby treatment , Kohl bent over backward to embrace his good friend Yeltsin at a news_conference on the first day of the Russian leader ' s three-day visit . Kohl stressed the close , historic ties between Germany and Russia and said a special telephone hot_line would be set_up between the Chancellery and Kremlin . The leaders said they would bid farewell to Russian troops together in Berlin on Aug . 31 -- a compromise , as Kohl had wanted to move half of the ceremony out of Berlin to nearby Weimar and Yeltsin had wanted to be included in a goodby parade with Allied forces to honor their joint defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 . &quot; It is my special concern that we see off Russian soldiers from Germany in a dignified and respectful manner and that this happens from a spirit of friendship , &quot; Kohl said . He said he wanted to have a Weimar meeting only to emphasize the countries ' cultural heritage over its belligerent history in a town that is &quot; the cradle of modern , parliamentary_democracy in Germany. &quot; Kohl said he and Yeltsin would meet there at a later date with Russian and German cultural figures . American , British and French troops are to mark their Berlin departure with June 18 celebrations organized by the city and a send-off by the federal_government Sept . 8 . The German government and Western allies agreed that Russia should not be included in the Berlin festivities , since the postwar roles of Russian and Allied troops were quite different . Western troops defended West_Berlin during the Cold_War , while Moscow ' s troops were effectively an occupying force behind the Communist government in East_Germany . Yeltsin had made clear in a speech Monday that Russia felt it was receiving second-class treatment and that its national pride had been offended . But on Wednesday , he accepted essentially separate but equal treatment . &quot; I am very satisfied that Helmut Kohl sensed the mood among the Russian people and the mood of the president and that we now came_to this result , &quot; Yeltsin said . &quot; One should avoid everything that could destabilize the political situation in Russia. &quot; Yeltsin wants to show nationalists back home that he is successfully integrating Moscow into the West , and , to that end , Kohl vowed to campaign for Russia ' s joining an expanded G-7 at the group ' s Naples summit this summer . The G-7 now is made_up of the United States , Canada , France , Germany , Britain , Italy and Japan . At Wednesday ' s news_conference , Yeltsin appeared to be edging back toward North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s Partnership for Peace , an American proposal for loose cooperation between NATO and former Warsaw Pact countries . Yeltsin said he would agree to sign the agreement if a special protocol for Russia were completed .</TEXT>
