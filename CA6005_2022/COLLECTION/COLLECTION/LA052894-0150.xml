   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CHINA KNEW U.S. POLITICAL BOTTOM_LINE : MONEY TALKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the end , China ' s success in overcoming human_rights opposition to win renewal of trade privileges from the United States boiled_down to one simple truth : The Chinese regime demonstrated a much better understanding of the American political_system than the Clinton_Administration did of the Chinese system . The key to Beijing ' s strategy was to divert attention from human_rights issues by using the blinding lights of China ' s booming economy and huge potential market . By doing this , Chinese officials said , they successfully broadened the terms of the debate inside the United States . As a result , the Clinton_Administration found itself fighting_back on many fronts , often against some of its own most powerful citizens . Time and again during the last year , the Chinese effectively called_on U.S. big business to do most of the heavy lifting in carrying their case to the American public and President Clinton himself . Major_league companies such_as Boeing , AT &amp; T , General Electric and United Technologies were more_than happy to go_to bat for the Chinese with their powerful public relations machines . &quot; My feeling is that a_few huge companies had more at stake than in the past , &quot; said Anne Stevenson-Yang , Beijing director of the U.S. China Business Council . American executives , for example , lobbied hard for a last-minute meeting between Clinton and Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua in early May that was one of the turning points in the dialogue . When confronted with allegations of human_rights abuses , the Chinese leadership coolly responded by changing the subject , citing the thousands of U.S. jobs that depend_on Chinese orders for commercial aircraft and telecommunications_equipment . This approach was used in November when Chinese President Jiang Zemin held his first summit with Clinton during a Seattle visit . Jiang ostentatiously made_a_point of visiting the family of a Boeing worker . His Chinese staff noted for all who would listen that China buys one out of every seven Boeing aircraft made . This effort continued right up until Clinton ' s news_conference Thursday announcing renewal of China ' s most-favored-nation trading status -- the same rights that the United States grants all but a_few pariah states . The same day , the Wall_Street Journal reported that China is &quot; within weeks &quot; of finalizing an agreement to buy 50 new aircraft from Boeing , an order worth $ 5 billion . On another front often very embarrassing to the Clinton_Administration , the Beijing regime romanced U.S. allies_with attractive business opportunities to accentuate the U.S. isolation on the human_rights question . For example , at_the_same_time Clinton was in Seattle presenting Jiang with a list of human_rights concerns , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl traveled_to Beijing with German business_leaders to sign $ 3.5 billion worth of contracts . This spring , French Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur arrived in Beijing with a similar entourage . The Chinese government made the point abundantly clear : Only the United States put human_rights conditions on trade . If the Clinton_Administration kept insisting , China could take its business elsewhere . Finally , during the year leading_up to the Clinton decision , China hosted and feted hundreds of American political and business_leaders . During all_of 1992 , for example , only 11 members of Congress -- eight representatives and three senators -- came_to China . But between June , 1993 , and May , 1994 , Beijing was swarmed by 47 U.S. representatives and 14 senators . The influx of American politicians was partly the result of the efforts of U.S. Ambassador J . Stapleton Roy , who encouraged Congress members to visit China and witness its development firsthand . But the Chinese were quick to welcome the visitors , spending thousands of dollars to feed them and show them the sights . As a result , they may have won a_few extra votes for their cause . Many Congress members indicated that the bleak land of torture and abuse described in news_reports appeared instead to be a land in the throes of rapid , healthy development . By consistently outmaneuvering Clinton ' s Asia policy-makers , China was finally able to win the &quot; de-linking &quot; of human_rights questions and trade relations , while making only a handful of mostly token concessions to the American side . This was the prize they wanted most but had been unable to win from a hostile Democratic Congress during the George_Bush Administration , despite President Bush ' s personal support for separating trade and human_rights issues . Several officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , architects of the Chinese strategy in the trade versus human_rights debate , rose early Friday , China time , to watch Clinton ' s news_conference live_on the satellite CNN network . When Clinton pronounced the magic word de-link , the Chinese knew that their efforts had paid_off . They listened contentedly as the American President used some of China ' s own arguments to justify his decision . In explaining why the Chinese had not fully responded to American demands on human_rights , for example , Clinton said that China was under great strain from tensions between its far-flung provinces and the central government . This is a common argument espoused by senior Communist_Party leaders when they explain the need for measures to ensure &quot; stability. &quot; Borrowing another common Chinese argument , Clinton noted that Asian societies such_as China have a more authoritarian tradition . He cited as an example the recent case of American teen-ager Michael Fay , sentenced to several strokes of a rattan_cane for a vandalism charge in Singapore . Even when the Chinese did make concessions to the Americans , such_as the release earlier this month of prominent dissidents Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming , they skillfully timed them to win maximum possible credit from the Clinton_Administration , which in the later stages of the game was desperate for any such sign from the Chinese . During the months leading_up to Clinton ' s MFN decision , business delegations from the United States were welcomed in Beijing like heads_of_state by Chinese leaders . In contrast , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , who came_to China in March ostensibly to tie_up the package on human_rights , was given one of the frostiest receptions an American diplomat ever received in the Chinese capital . The State_Department ' s special human_rights envoy , Assistant Secretary_of_State John Shattuck , who came_to China to prepare_for the Christopher visit , was accused by authorities of breaking Chinese law because he met with prominent dissident Wei Jingsheng during the visit . Adding insult to injury in the Shattuck episode , the Chinese authorities subsequently jailed Wei for allegedly telling Shattuck that China ' s most-favored-nation status should not be renewed unless improvements in the rights arena were made . Wei was still in jail when Clinton renewed the trading status Thursday . By ignoring the diplomats and concentrating_on the business lobby , the Chinese gambled successfully , if somewhat cynically , that money talks louder than morality in the American political_system . When cornered on some tough points -- such_as the thousands of political_prisoners in Chinese jails and labor reform camps -- Beijing turned the tables on the Americans . In response to U.S. objections to the export of goods made in Chinese prisons , for example , China commissioned a series of reports in respectable international publications documenting examples of American prison exports to other countries . Under a barrage of human_rights allegations from the West , China responded that its first obligation to human_rights is feeding and housing its people , something the United States so far has been unable to do with its enormous homeless population . Finally , the Chinese adopted a strategy of aiming their diplomatic efforts directly at Clinton , while shunting aside his most prominent emissaries , even Christopher . Although American policy on the human rights-trade question was denounced in the Chinese press , Clinton himself was never personally attacked . Moreover , when the Chinese authorities released dissident Wang in May , they made_it clear that it was because Clinton had requested the release on medical grounds . Wang suffers from hepatitis . Confident that it had already won the diplomatic matchup over human_rights through its other efforts , particularly by marshaling U.S. business interests in its cause , China viewed the releases of dissidents Wang and Chen as a way of &quot; giving face &quot; to the young American President , still a neophyte in international affairs . During his campaign for the presidency , Clinton repeatedly attacked Bush for &quot; coddling dictators &quot; in China . On Thursday , however , Clinton succeeded where Bush had failed -- removing human_rights conditions from trade matters between the two countries . RELATED STORY : B3</TEXT>
