   <HEADLINE> UCI IN LINE FOR COVETED CANCER CENTER DESIGNATION ; MEDICINE : RECOGNITION BY THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE WILL BRING PRESTIGE AND FUNDS TO UNIVERSITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The cancer research and treatment program at UC Irvine is_on the verge of winning a long-coveted National Cancer Institute designation that would make_it one of the top five centers in Southern California , officials say . Being named an NCI &quot; clinical cancer center &quot; could bring the university up_to $ 2.4 million over the next three years , while also attracting additional grants , top-flight researchers and patients wanting access to cutting-edge medicine . Moreover , it is a major step toward the university ' s ultimate goal of becoming a &quot; comprehensive cancer center , &quot; a still more prestigious NCI designation held by only 27 institutions in the nation , and only two in Southern California : research_centers at USC and UCLA . &quot; This is something the university has dreamed about having for at least 15 years , &quot; said Hung Fan , director of the UCI Cancer Research Institute , one component of the cancer center . &quot; It recognizes the academic excellence of the cancer efforts at UCI. &quot; Brian Kimes , an associate director at the National Cancer Institute in Maryland , said Monday that UCI has been informally advised that it probably will receive the first-step recognition by the end of the summer . He said the UCI cancer staff demonstrated that it meet rigorous standards for combining laboratory research with patient care . To achieve the NCI designation , Kimes said , UCI had to show that it developed cancer research programs that &quot; cross typical academic barriers and departmental barriers. &quot; He said that while many hospitals have created &quot; cancer centers &quot; as a marketing tool , NCI cancer centers must show they have moved research from the laboratory to clinical trials and provided community outreach . Kimes said UCI is the only medical_center in the nation that is expected to obtain the institute ' s first-stage recognition this year . UCI officials say the designation will allow the university to apply for special research grants that are available only to NCI-approved cancer centers . Kimes said he anticipates that as part of the expected designation , the institute will award UCI &quot; slightly less than $ 800 # 000 &quot; a year for three years . He said the money can be used to buttress and coordinate existing research , such_as helping to pay the salaries of the new center ' s director and senior staff , and for launching new research projects . In three years , Kimes said , he expects UCI will apply for the loftier designation as an NCI &quot; comprehensive cancer clinic. &quot; Before attaining that , he said , the center would have to meet additional NCI requirements for providing public health information services , community outreach programs and training for biomedical researchers and health_care professionals . In all , there are 53 cancer institutions in the country with some form of NCI recognition . Others in Southern California that have achieved the first-step designation as clinical cancer centers are the City of Hope and the UC San Diego . Dr. Frank L . Meyskens Jr. , who was recruited from the University of Arizona five years ago to spearhead UCI ' s drive for NCI recognition , recently received a phone_call from the institute to alert him that it was pending , university officials said . Dr. Walter Henry , former dean of the UCI College of Medicine , said on Sunday that he received a note last week in the mail from Meyskens informing him that UCI ' s application , submitted last June to the NCI , had been accepted . However , Meyskens is being highly cautious in his public statements . &quot; It is not official until the check comes , &quot; Meyskens said , adding that so far he has nothing in writing . Kimes acknowledged that NCI ' s formal notification must come from its grant management officials , which he expects by the end of September . But already there is plenty of excitement among the 104 researchers and physicians who are part of the cancer program . &quot; It is a very prestigious thing for the community as_a_whole . It is the only NCI-approved cancer center in Orange County , &quot; said Hoda Anton-Culver , UCI ' s director of cancer epidemiology intervention . &quot; This puts UCI in a great league , which is where we should have been before , but we didn ' t have a leader , &quot; said Dr. James Jakowatz , a surgical oncologist at UCI , who like others praised Meyskens ' role in shaping the cancer center . &quot; Meyskens has brought basic scientists and researchers together . He is a driven man with a vision , &quot; Jakowatz said . Meyskens is credited with enabling the UCI cancer program to achieve this milestone . His admirers said he hired physicians needed to fill gaps in clinical research programs , inspired basic researchers and clinicians to work in tandem on studies and helped clinicians compete successfully for a wide variety of research grants , especially in the area of cancer prevention and control . The push culminated last year with submission of an 800-page application to the NCI and a visit by a team of NCI evaluators . Dr. Philip DiSaia , deputy director of the clinical cancer center , said , &quot; We heard we got a very good score. &quot;</TEXT>
