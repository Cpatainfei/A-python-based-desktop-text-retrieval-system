   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP SOCCER ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; SPAIN BEATS REMNANTS OF BOLIVIA ; GROUP C : SOUTH_AMERICANS ARE THREE SCORERS SHY OF A FULL TEAM BECAUSE OF SUSPENSIONS BUT STILL GET FIRST WORLD CUP GOAL EVER IN LOSING , 3-1 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Playing three starters short and way too close to sea_level , a pesky Bolivian team managed to give Spain fits Monday by breaking_through to score its first goal in World Cup history . Later , though , Bolivians could only look ahead to the long_plane ride back_up to La Paz , the ( Two ) -Mile High City . Spain , chronic World Cup underachievers , took_advantage of a penalty kick and an injured goalkeeper in a 3-1 victory before 63 # 089 at Soldier Field . Spain advances to the round of 16 , where it will playSwitzerland in Washington on Saturday . The Spaniards did not lose a game in Group C -- finishing 1-0-2 -- yet no one is holding a breath regarding its title chances . Spain had Boliva surrounded with talent , but somehow managed to make the game closer than it deserved to be . Then , in what can only be described as an act of foolishness , Spain midfielder Jose Luis Perez Caminero picked_up a second yellow card in second-half extra_time after fouling defender Juan Manuel Pena about 50 yards away from the action . Caminero ? He scored two of Spain ' s three goals Monday but gets_to hand_out towels during his team ' s second-round match against the_Swiss . Spain Coach Javier Clemente didn ' t know whether to thank Caminero or punish him . &quot; He told me I should not have done that , &quot; Caminero said of his heart-to-heart with Clemente . &quot; It was a dumb play . Obviously , I should have been more professional , but I did_it and now I ' m suspended for the Switzerland game. &quot; It was the sort of undisciplined act that might prove Spain ' s undoing . The Spaniards out-fouled the Bolivians , 30-8 . How did Spain win ? In the first_half , it took_advantage of a questionable penalty call_in the Bolivian goal box . Bolivia ' s Carlos Borja was cited for fouling Spain ' s Felipe Minambres . Asked later about the call , Bolivian goalkeeper Carlos Leonel Trucco ' s answer was translated into English . In a family newspaper , however , it cannot be translated . In the 19th minute , Josef Guardiola rammed_home the penalty shot , shooting the ball straight into the spot vacated by Trucco . Guardiola acknowledged that he miss-hit the ball . So what ? Spain , 1-0 . Play dragged_on until midway through the second_half . Spain , attacking Bolivia almost always from the right , blew numerous chances , the best when Caminero hit the right post in the 58th minute . Three minutes later , midfielder Juan Antonio Goikoetxea stormed in from the right side . Trucco came_out to meet him and repelled the shot , then rolled_over in pain . A sliding Goikoetxea had left cleat marks below Trucco ' s left knee . Limping and in obvious pain , Trucco remained in the game . In the 66th minute , Caminero received a nice pass from Sergi Barjuan , left of goal , and shot it past a limping Trucco , who came_out to cut_off the angle . Trucco said later he wanted to come_out but that his coach , Xavier Azkargorta , wanted him to &quot; tough it out. &quot; As Spain celebrated its sure victory , forgetting it had blown a 2-0 lead against South_Korea , Bolivia launched an attack a minute later . Forward Erwin Sanchez , Bolivia ' s best player not suspended , let a shot fly from beyond the penalty arc , the ball deflecting off the leg of Spaniard Salvador Gonzalez and into the net . Bolivia has participated in two previous World Cups and two matches in this tournament . Until the 67th minute Monday , it had never scored . Sanchez said he had hoped to put Bolivia &quot; on the world soccer map. &quot; He settled for putting Bolivia on the board . Suddenly riled , a nervous Spain again turned its attention on Trucco -- still in the game and still limping . In the 71st minute , Caminero slipped behind the Bolivian defense , took a chip pass from Albert Ferrer and put another goal past Trucco . Caminero , grateful as he was , wondered about the Bolivian strategy : &quot; Yes , I do believe Trucco was hit in such a hard way that he lost some of his concentration and physical_ability . I do believe a goalkeeper in that condition should be replaced. &quot; Still , no lead is safe with Spain . Too_little , too late , Bolivia made some rushes in the closing minutes . In the 78th minute , forward Jaime Moreno was denied when Spain goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta charged from the box and made a brilliant save of Moreno ' s blast . But Bolivia was suffering a power shortage because its three top players -- Marco Antonio Etcheverry , Julio Baldivieso and Luis Cristaldo -- were serving out FIFA suspensions . Azkargorta had strong feelings on the subject . &quot; What do you think I should feel ? &quot; he asked , rhetorically . &quot; We only had a very few players for the World Cup , then you lose your best three players ? How would you feel in if you were in my shoes ? &quot; So , Spain wriggles off another hook and lives to play again . Most believe it will not be for long .</TEXT>
