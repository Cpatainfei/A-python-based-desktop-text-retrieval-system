   <TEXT> ENGLAND SWINGS : Brian Eno enlisted Bono , David Bowie , Paul McCartney and others for a recent project -- but as sculptors , not musicians . The creations of the stars were auctioned in London recently , raising $ 82 # 000 for a Bosnian children ' s charity.A small woodcarving by McCartney commanded the highest price , $ 18 # 750 , from a mystery buyer , while Bono ' s music_box , containing a pair of sunglasses and an American Express card , sold for nearly $ 3 # 000 . * &quot; Repetitive Beats , &quot; a single by Retribution -- a one-time collaboration of members of Killing Joke , hip-hop group Fun-Da-Mental and dance acts the Drum Club and System 7 -- is the latest effort by British rockers to protest their country ' s Criminal Justice Bill . The proposal would , among other things , effectively outlaw &quot; rave &quot; dance parties . Primal Scream and ex-Clash guitarist Mick Jones are among those doing remixed versions of the single , to be released in the U.K. on Oct . 24 . Primal Scream ' s Bobby Gillespie was among the estimated 100 # 000 people taking_part in a recent Hyde Park demonstration against the bill . The London rally ended in violent clashes between demonstrators and police , with 38 people ( including 11 police_officers ) injured.Dave Jennings from London</TEXT>
