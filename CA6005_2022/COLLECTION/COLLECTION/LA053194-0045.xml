   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEW ; PHOTOGRAPHER FINDS FREEDOM IN SEARCH FOR POLAR BEARS ; THE CAGE BY AUDREY SCHULMAN ; ALGONQUIN BOOKS ; $ 17.95 , 228 PAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rivaling love and war in durability , the theme of man against nature continues to tempt novelists . Recently , significant numbers of women have begun to turn_up in the wilderness , encroaching_upon a literary province once exclusively male . Even so , the heroine of Audrey Schulman ' s compelling adventure_story seems an unlikely contender -- a petite , shy photographer who has built a modest reputation with animal shots , mostly taken_in the Boston Zoo . Beryl Findham is an eco-worrier ; concerned about the population explosion , pollution , the ozone_layer and endangered species , as well as an assortment of more subtle threats to the future of the planet . Wary of entanglements , she ' s unattached and uncommitted , outwardly content with her quiet , intensely private life . We meet her in the closet of her apartment , where she ' s sitting in the dark holding an ice_cube in her hand , attempting to project herself into the Canadian tundra where the temperature hovers around 40 below zero . The closet is meant to simulate the metal cage_in which she ' ll be confined while she takes close-ups of polar_bears . Beryl has just been hired as the still photographer for Natural Photography , a prestigious magazine that prides itself upon avoiding tricks of the trade , such_as zoom_lenses and darkroom manipulations . A fine photographer , Beryl knows she ' s gotten the assignment primarily because -- at 5 feet , 1 inch -- she ' s the only applicant who can fit_in the cage , which turned_out to be somewhat smaller than planned . She will be the only woman on the expedition , and she ' s looking_forward to a fantastic adventure , a welcome change from her humdrum urban life . Boarding the plane from Winnipeg to Churchill , Manitoba , Beryl meets Dave Golding , the video cameraman who looks &quot; like an elf who shopped in SoHo. &quot; Dave is clever , witty and garrulous , in striking contrast to the other expedition member , a taciturn man who introduces himself merely as Butler , the naturalist who will write the accompanying story . On one of their preliminary explorations to the local dump , where the famished bears gather before setting_off for their seal hunting_grounds on Hudson_Bay , the group sees 13 foraging bears . &quot; The bears seemed to be willing to give anything a try as food , eating the foam_rubber out of couches , tugging the seats off snowmobiles , chewing on vinyl car roofs . Standing_up in the van , Beryl saw one bear sniffing a closed can of paint , putting his teeth to each edge , curling his lips back , then turning the can over to try again . Each time the bears found something they considered edible , they looked content , chewing hard , strings of drool rolling from their mouths. &quot; Beryl ' s expedition will follow the bears to their destination at Cape Churchill . Impatient and eager to learn more about what ' s in_store for her , she fills the down time before they leave by joining Deputy Maggie Johnson on her nightly rounds . Maggie is an emigre from Atlanta who not only patrols the streets alerting residents to the presence of bears , but puts some additional feminist spin on the novel . Once the party has arrived_at its destination 40 miles from town , the pace and tension dramatically accelerate . In comparison to the frozen tundra , Churchill is Paris . The vehicle proves no match for the bears , who munch through the space-age materials of the undercarriage and leave the party stranded without heat , fuel or power . From this point on , the story becomes almost unbearably suspenseful and horrific , calculated to freeze your blood even as you read it on a sunny California beach . You ' ll never hear &quot; bear &quot; and think_of Winnie-the-Pooh again . In hallowed person-against-nature tradition , the tale is weighted with symbolism ; the cage a metaphor for the limitations of Beryl ' s prior life and the characters representing various attitudes toward the powers of nature . The author ' s style , at once terse and lyrical , refreshes and enhances the proven formula . Her appealing heroine is a true original , transformed emotionally and physically by experiences marvelously imagined and unforgettably described .</TEXT>
