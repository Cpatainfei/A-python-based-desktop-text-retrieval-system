   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : LAKE FOREST ; PROPOSAL WILL TRIM PARKING SPACE WIDTH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hoping to draw more shoppers into the city , the City_Council agreed this week to shrink parking_spaces in commercial and retail centers . The ordinance reduces the minimum size for a standard parking_space by six inches , a move applauded by commercial property_owners in the city . &quot; My feeling is that it would enhance shopping in Lake Forest , &quot; said Ray Gelgur , owner of the Civic Center Plaza , a retail / commercial plaza where City_Hall is located . &quot; It would make more space available , which is particularly good when you have a crowded center. &quot; The width of a standard size lot could be reduced from nine feet to 8 1 / 2 feet under the proposed law . Only 30 % of a shopping_center ' s parking_spaces could be reduced to 8 1 / 2 feet . However , compact_car spaces would not be affected by the proposed ordinance . &quot; My concern is that the space would be sufficient for vans and large vehicles , that there would be enough room to open_doors without dinging other cars all_the time , &quot; said Councilwoman Ann Van Haun . &quot; It ' s certainly to the city ' s advantage for there to be as_many parking_spaces as possible , &quot; Van Haun said before the Tuesday meeting . &quot; Many citizens ( who ) grumble about not finding enough room to park . . . might shop some place other_than Lake Forest. &quot; Approval of the new law would mean about 20 extra vehicles could park in the 368-space Civic Center Plaza . Gelgur asked the council to allow that 50 % of all standard spaces be reduced in size . However , council_members followed the advice of the city_Planning Commission , which said the city should start with 30 % . &quot; The Planning_Commission felt it would be more prudent to recommend a small step rather than the full 50 % , &quot; said Kathy Graham , city community development director . In South County , only San Clemente and Laguna Beach allow standard space widths of less than nine feet , the county standard . About half of the 115 California cities surveyed by Lake Forest city staff allow smaller standard spaces . FRANK MESSINA</TEXT>
