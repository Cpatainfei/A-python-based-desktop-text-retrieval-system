   <HEADLINE> COMPUTER_FILE : GORE ' S LONG HIGHWAY TO SUCCESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Vice_President Al Gore wants to help build a high-speed information highway by the year 2000 . But so far he ' s having trouble accessing electronic_mail at the White_House . Gore ' s personal frustrations as the nation ' s highest-ranking computer_expert are indicative_of what he faces in his efforts to extend the benefits of modern technology to the country as_a_whole . Gore himself has a pretty good setup , including both a Macintosh PowerBook Duo 270-c and an AST IBM-compatible personal_computer . He uses the machines for electronic_mail , writing speeches and &quot; personal projects. &quot; But the White_House computer_system , in Gore ' s words , &quot; is a museum piece. &quot; &quot; The White_House that we inherited was way , way , way behind the curve , and we have spent the last year trying to get_it up_to speed , &quot; Gore said in an interview Tuesday , shortly after he delivered his &quot; superhighway summit &quot; address at UCLA . Gore has a lot of work to do . His struggle at the White_House , like his challenge to build the data superhighway , will require changes in technology , regulations and attitudes . Take vice presidential e-mail . &quot; There are some communications within the White_House that can only take_place electronically if you don ' t do certain things , and it ' s frustrating to me because I think we ought to be fully linked to the Internet , &quot; he said . * The Freedom of Information Act , which Gore supports , has provisions for storage and retrieval of government communications and correspondence . The White_House has long had procedures for paper mail , but issues regarding e-mail have not been fully resolved . And , as with the data highway , there are privacy issues . &quot; What people may think is a private message to us has to be kept_in public files. &quot; Millions of Americans are already using the Internet and commercial on-line services to exchange e-mail . But sending e-mail to the White_House can be a frustrating experience . Clinton and Gore do have e-mail addresses ( Gore ' s Internet address is vice.president .whitehouse.gov ) but messages are printed out and answered via U.S. mail , assuming the person remembered to include a postal address . Even then , a lot of people , including myself , have discovered that the White_House often fails to respond to its e-mail . Gore says that will change . Gore has often joked about the White_House ' s antiquated telephone_system , which , when he and Clinton took_office , had rotary-dial phones and an old-fashioned switchboard . If the technologically savvy White_House staff is having trouble modernizing its own facilities , one can ' t help but wonder how long it will take before we reach the Administration ' s goal , to &quot; connect all_of our classrooms , all_of our libraries and all_of our hospitals and clinics by the year 2000. &quot; * And even if we do reach that goal , will the technology help solve the many social problems facing our society ? If millions of Americans can ' t read , how can we expect them to log_on to the Internet and on-line services ? &quot; Nations like Cuba just put us to shame where adult literacy is concerned , &quot; Gore said . &quot; And it ' s time we realized the need for a national program to deal with this problem. &quot; Laudably , but perhaps over-optimistically , Gore contends that &quot; information technologies can themselves make a contribution to combatting illiteracy. &quot; I agree , but my local school district doesn ' t have enough money for pencils and paper , let alone Macs and PCs . A digital superhighway won ' t be of much use to schools that don ' t have enough computers . Our current interstate highway_system offers free access , but you can ' t get_on them if you don ' t have access to a car or bus_ticket . Vice_President Gore has a lot of work to do . I wish him well . Computer_File welcomes your comments . Write to Lawrence J .
