   <HEADLINE> A BEAR ' S BEST_FRIEND ; TIMOTHY TREADWELL SAYS A GRIZZLY SAVED HIS LIFE -- SO HE IS TRYING TO RETURN THE FAVOR . ARMED WITH PHOTOS AND LECTURES , HE HAS DEDICATED HIMSELF TO THEIR PRESERVATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Timothy Treadwell had a hangover . Again . So , as he ' d done countless times before , he drove to an isolated spot in the wilderness -- this time Wrangell-St . Elias National Preserve in Alaska -- and hiked into the woods to dry_out . &quot; Nothing could ever get me to stop drinking , &quot; he says now , seven years later , while downing his second Coca-Cola in as_many minutes . &quot; Some people find religion , some have a child and find a greater purpose in their lives. &quot; But Treadwell felt doomed to live a short life of drinking , dodging barroom brawls and drying_out from time to time in the woods . Then , while trudging alone through the wild beauty of the preserve , something unexpected happened . &quot; All of a sudden a big , gorgeous bear , four or five_hundred pounds , came crashing through the woods. &quot; It froze at the sight of Treadwell and then , before he had the chance to back_away , bounded majestically back into the woods . &quot; It was a fleeting moment that was just magic , &quot; he says , his expression turning dreamy . Since then , Treadwell , 32 , has become an expert on the world ' s largest terrestrial carnivore , the Alaskan grizzly , which can weigh 1 # 500 pounds and kill a person with a single swipe of its massive paw . Each year , just as the bears emerge from their dens , scruffy , hungry and a little grumpy after a long winter of isolation , Treadwell flies to a remote region of Alaska , sets_up a tent , pulls_out his camera and hunkers down for weeks . &quot; I get_on their level . You have to get as wild as them as quickly as possible . I chomp on the grass here and there and hope I ' m accepted. &quot; When he ' s not out pawing the earth and snapping photographs , Treadwell spends his winters in Malibu where , between waiting tables , he tirelessly promotes the preservation of the grizzlies by showing his slides to schoolchildren and adults . In April , he signed a deal with Audubon Productions and Turner Broadcasting to be featured in a film called &quot; The Man Who Loves Bears , &quot; slated to begin production this summer . &quot; The bears saved my life , &quot; he says , adding without irony : &quot; I ' d be willing to die for them. &quot; His one-room Malibu apartment is covered from wall to wall with close-range photographs of the bears -- candid pictures that reflect Treadwell ' s intimacy with his subjects . Like a proud parent , he points them out one by one . &quot; that ' s Booble . There ' s Snowy . Over there , that ' s Aqua Bear. &quot; His sentences run_into each other like a train wreck as he bounds happily through the room . * Environmental brochures and newspaper_articles on bear poaching take_up the space not used by his photographs . Once in awhile a horse from a nearby barn pops its head into the bathroom window and , without breaking stride , Treadwell feeds it an apple . Except for a_few modern amenities -- MTV , a small refrigerator , an answering machine -- the place has the dank , cavernous feel of a bear ' s lair . &quot; There ' s a spirituality to this . I don ' t deny a God , but I don ' t see the standard God , the Christian God and all_the Allahs . . . . When you are with a grizzly_bear , up close , and you hear them breathe and you feel them move and you hear the gurgles in their stomach , you feel as if you are in the presence of a God and you must turn your life over. &quot; Indeed , when it comes_to grizzlies , Treadwell speaks with a fiery evangelism no matter who is listening . This fervor goes_over particularly well with the second-graders at John L . Webster Elementary School in Malibu . While they watch his slides , Treadwell tells his rapt audience that once , a long_time ago , Malibu was filled with grizzlies . Despite some giggles and the animated &quot; oohs &quot; and &quot; ahs &quot; as the kids pass_around some bear fur , Treadwell hammers home the notion that bears are our friends , to be respected and revered . &quot; We never feed wild animals . No tricks_or_treats . Just try to be friendly . We don ' t want to take_away their natural habits. &quot; When one small girl with big O ' s for eyes asks Treadwell what he does if a bear gets mad at him , he happily replies : &quot; I sing to it. &quot; * In fact , singing is the only weapon Treadwell uses to placate a bear that exhibits any of the 21 basic warning signs of anger -- signs Treadwell has carefully memorized . In one close_call , Treadwell tells the class , a young male approached him with his fur raised_up in angry points on his back , snarling . But Treadwell managed to pacify the animal by singing a rhyme he made_up on the spot . Remarkably , during this encounter , Treadwell maintained a steady enough hand to snap his camera . The result is a series of amazing pictures_showing how the angry adversary was lullabied into passivity . In the final slide , the bear sleeps peacefully only a_few feet away . And Treadwell tells the class that he felt so secure he laid_down beside the bear to catch of few Zs of_his_own . &quot; Timothy is quite off the wall , &quot; says Doug Peacock , a founding member of Earth First ! &quot; He ' s an iconoclast and an outsider . His empirical observations are as_good_as anyone ' s. &quot; Sterling Miller , a bear biologist for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game , agrees that &quot; Timothy ' s talks are very valuable . He ' s an advocate for the bear . A vocal and I think very effective one. &quot; Treadwell plans to seek nonprofit status for his organization , the Great Bear Project . His goal , as the sole activist and head_honcho of the project , is threefold : to protect their habitat , to end illegal poaching and to stop the practice of legal grizzly_bear hunting . &quot; We need to raise the grizzly_bear to the kindred state of the whale and dolphin , &quot; he says . Although Treadwell ' s focus is_on developing a peaceful strategy , he sees legitimacy in radical environmental groups such_as Earth First ! that have been criticized for resorting_to violence . But , he adds , &quot; I think it ' s better working within the system . What ' s needed is education because to get results or legitimacy , you have to do_it without shooting people. &quot; * Nevertheless , Treadwell is often accused of being overly emotional , especially when it comes_to the issue of legal sport hunting . &quot; Grizzly populations have been reduced primarily through destruction of habitat , &quot; says Miller , the Alaska bear biologist . &quot; Bears are his personal friends . Timothy is picking on an emotional issue and not on other targets that affect bear populations. &quot; Treadwell concedes that he is emotional and that Miller , to whom he defers in all matters involving the science of bears , is right that &quot; habitat encroachment is the main killer of bears. &quot; Others express concern that Treadwell swaggers dangerously close to understating how unpredictable grizzlies can be . &quot; Everything I ' ve heard about him sounds terrific , &quot; says David Gaillard , project coordinator for Wild Forever -- the American Grizzly Bear Project , which -- in collaboration with the Sierra Club , the Audubon Society and the Greater Yellowstone Coalition -- seeks to protect the grizzly from extinction . &quot; But he needs to be careful about sending a message to the public that bears don ' t pose a serious threat to human safety . Bears are not cuddly. &quot; Treadwell doesn ' t believe he is giving the wrong message at all . He points_out that the safest bear is the habituated bear , the one familiar_with humans . He sees himself as a myth-breaker and wants to do_away_with the notion that bears are evil , terrifying creatures . &quot; Bears shouldn ' t be able to walk up 5th and Flower , but if people would stop hurting them , they would relax more around us . To coexist peacefully with the bear , you need compassion , reason , love , nurturing , a strong feminine side . &quot; The only thing you get_back is what you give . Which is the essence of life . When I ' m with Casper or Booble , they are cuddly. &quot; And if he ' s attacked ? &quot; You make your bed , you lie_in it , &quot; he says without much flourish . * Peacock , of Earth First ! , says he shares Treadwell ' s passion for the bear , but he is nonetheless quick to point_out that he doesn ' t recommend Treadwell ' s methods . &quot; The bears of the world don ' t need thousands of Timothy Treadwells out there because sooner or later someone ' s gonna get mauled and that could cause a bear to get shot. &quot; Just last month , a black_bear was shot to death in Azusa after wandering out of the mountains and into a residential_area . Treadwell , who was filming in Alaska at the time , expressed sorrow for the bear ' s death . Although he makes no bones about shooting a bear when it clearly threatens life or property , he expressed concern for what he perceived in Azusa as the possible mishandling of the situation . He sees only one positive aspect : &quot; Maybe they learned something from it , and next time they won ' t have to destroy a life. &quot; Last August , a 13-year-old was mauled by a black_bear at a campground in the San Bernardino National Forest . Although the boy survived , he required more_than 100 stitches . After another attack the next day , two bears were tracked and shot to death -- standard procedure . Treadwell is so fearful of this that he claims to have made a deal with his pilot to quietly dump his body in the ocean should he ever be found mauled to death in his secret refuge . Not that he expects to meet such a fate . &quot; They love me too_much , &quot; he says of the bears . So his agenda , for now at any rate , is to stay alive long enough to complete work_on his film . Due_to air early in 1995 on Turner Broadcasting , the film will follow Treadwell on his Alaskan adventures , focusing_on the lucrative poaching trade with its ties to China . Liam O ' Brien , the independent producer who brought Treadwell to the attention of Audubon , says that while he ' s very excited about the film , he ' s also a little nervous about getting so close to the bears . O ' Brien ' s first impression of Treadwell was a common one : &quot; I thought he was crazy , &quot; he says with a respectful laugh . But his interest was piqued and he soon realized that both Treadwell and his crusade were serious . &quot; The bears are being poached for their gall bladders and claws . A live bear is worth nothing . But a dead bear is worth up_to $ 40 # 000 . It ' s a Mercedes that they ' re shooting. &quot; * With the film in pre-production , Treadwell ' s life has altered considerably . For one thing , he gets_to quit waiting tables . But he also has to deal with the human world of collaboration , budgets and deal-making -- a world so alien to the solitude of his Alaskan refuge that when he talks_about it , he appears baffled , even dismayed . &quot; It ' s therapeutic that other people are finding value in my work . People are giving me attention , and that ' s kind of nice but that ' s all about ego , &quot; he carefully explains . To him , the only important issue is whether this unfamiliar dip_into the waters of Hollywood will help his bears . &quot; I didn ' t choose this calling , &quot; he says . &quot; But in the course of saving animals , you save humans . You stop being afraid of the dark . You live_in mutual respect and love. &quot; He pauses to look_at a picture of Booble digging for clams . &quot; And that , &quot; he says with a satisfied smile , &quot; is the crux of it. &quot;</TEXT>
