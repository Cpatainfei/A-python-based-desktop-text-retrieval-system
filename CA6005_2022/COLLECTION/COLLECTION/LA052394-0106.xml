   <HEADLINE> DISTRICT CONSIDERS MEDI-CAL TO ATTRACT FUNDS ; EDUCATION : IF APPROVED , THE STATE PROGRAM WOULD COMPENSATE HART SCHOOLS FOR SOME COSTS OF THE HEALTH_CARE THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When local students go_to the nurse ' s office next year , school officials hope the federal_government will mend some of the financial pain schools feel as well . The William S . Hart Union High_School District is considering a school-based Medi-Cal program to generate new money for the district . The program would compensate the schools for some costs for the physical and mental_health care required by law . Many details remain to be worked_out , but the district hopes to begin the program by the fall , said William Maddigan , director of the district ' s business and fiscal services . He said the district would be required to keep more extensive student medical_records , which could be critical in an emergency , but medical services provided by the school initially would not change . The district is facing at least a $ 2-million deficit for the 1994-95 school_year . Maddigan said he does not know how much money the Medi-Cal program would generate , but it would not make a substantial impact on the shortfall . &quot; At first , it didn ' t seem like it would be worth the work to set_up a big bureaucracy for what seems like a relatively small amount_of_money , &quot; he said . But the city , community organizations and the Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital have expressed support for the proposal , which could simplify planning and lead to a better system of health_care for youth , Maddigan said . In addition , schools would spend less money on existing health services , eventually allowing new services that would not otherwise exist . &quot; My own conclusion is there ' d be . . . a little expansion and a little substitution ( for current funding ) , &quot; he said . Medi-Cal is the state agency for the federal Medicaid program , providing health_care funds for low-income families . Legislation passed_by the state in 1992 and modified this year allows school districts to become Medi-Cal providers , receiving a refund of money spent treating eligible students . Officials estimate 10 to 15 states have passed legislation enabling schools to become Medicaid providers . The Hart district would become one of the first in the nation to implement the program , although school districts in Los Angeles and Fresno are also considering it . Judy Beck , nurse supervisor of the San Diego Unified School District , said a pilot_program begun in that district at the beginning of the 1993-94 school_year is living_up_to its promise . &quot; For the next fiscal_year , I think maybe we will be bringing_in some money with which we can enhance services , &quot; she said . Most of this year ' s reimbursements have gone_to pay_for the computer_system that tracks students ' records and for other operating_costs , Beck said . Medical services offered by the school district have not changed , she said . Hart district officials said the cost to design the program is estimated at $ 1 a student -- or about $ 11 # 000 . The costs of equipment and administration of the program are expected to be covered by Medi-Cal funds . The amount of reimbursement varies widely , said Craig Cook , a consultant for school-based Medicaid programs . He said a school employee in California who provides health_care to students and earns $ 50 # 000 a year could generate $ 2 # 500 a year in federal reimbursements if 20 % of the students at the school are eligible for Medi-Cal . &quot; that ' s for what they are already doing and all they have to do is fill_out a time-study form three or four times a quarter , &quot; he said . Eligible employees are not limited to school nurses , Cook said . Others can include psychological counselors , speech and physical_therapists , or even a teacher who arranges for a child to see a doctor . Maddigan said he estimates 10 % to 20 % of the students in the Hart district may be eligible for Medi-Cal . Hart trustees appear supportive of the plan , although a final proposal is far from complete . &quot; Even if we didn ' t get one cent back , I think we ought to do_it , &quot; said Bill Dinsenbacher , one of the board ' s five members . &quot; There are many potential benefits , but the greatest benefit is healthier pupils. &quot;</TEXT>
