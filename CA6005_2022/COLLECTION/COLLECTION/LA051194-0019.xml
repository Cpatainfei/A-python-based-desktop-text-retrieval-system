   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : BOILING MAD , CREW OF WORLD_WAR_II SHIP SEEKS TO RESUME D-DAY VOYAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Crew_members aboard a restored World_War_II cargo_ship bound for D-day celebrations in France are steamed . Their 9 # 000-mile voyage was called_off Saturday after the ship developed engines problems near Acapulco , Mexico . But the Lane Victory ' s captain said Tuesday he was never consulted , and maintains the crew is ready to go . &quot; I feel lousy . I think it was doable , &quot; Capt . Bill Tilghman said from Acapulco . The ship ' s crew faxed a petition signed by 34 of the 54 crew_members stating they want to continue the trip . The board of directors of the Merchant_Marine Veterans of World_War_II , which owns the 455-foot boat , voted 4 to 1 Saturday to scrap the trip . However , two board_members are aboard the ship and said they were excluded from the vote . &quot; We have engineers and we ' re ready to go now , &quot; said board_member William Skinner , 76 , from Acapulco . Chief engineer Pete Jacobelly flew home to San Pedro after a dispute with Tilghman over whether the ship could continue the trip . Jacobelly told the board that the ship needs boiler repairs and a custom-made part for the evaporator that turns salt water into fresh_water . President Joe Vernick said delays caused by mechanical problems make_it nearly impossible for the crew to arrive in time for the June 6 ceremonies in Normandy . But Tilghman said he believes that the ship can still get there for at least some ceremonies . All told , the ship ' s 54 volunteer crew_members -- former merchant_marines whose average age is 68 -- needed more_than $ 1 million in fuel , equipment , supplies and cash to make the Normandy trip . After numerous delays and a last-minute contribution of $ 250 # 000 , the ship steamed out of Los Angeles Harbor on April 29 . But the ship developed engine trouble and limped into port in Acapulco on May 4 . Officials said oil had leaked into one of the ship ' s two boilers . The Coast Goard required the ship to cross the Atlantic with another ship . The crew planned to steam through the Panama_Canal and rendezvous with the Jeremiah O ' Brien , a ship based in San Francisco that is going_to Normandy . The delay has made that meeting impossible . But the crew is now hoping for a last-minute reprieve from the Navy . Several members have asked officials if the Lane Victory could be escorted by one of 14 Navy ships expected to make the voyage , said Clint Johnson , a member of the Merchant_Marine veterans board . Tilghman said no decision has been made . JAMES BENNING</TEXT>
