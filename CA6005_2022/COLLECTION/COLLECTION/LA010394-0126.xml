   <HEADLINE> IN AFGHAN CAPITAL , FACTIONS BATTLE FOR STRATEGIC SITES ; WARFARE : MORE THAN 600 ARE WOUNDED IN THE FIRST TWO DAYS OF THE NEW YEAR . DOZENS ARE REPORTED KILLED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Feuding Islamic factions blasted each other with air strikes , rockets and automatic gunfire Sunday in a major battle for the presidential palace and other strategic sites in the shattered capital . More_than 600 people , both civilians and soldiers , have been treated at three Kabul hospitals since the latest blood bath began in the pre-dawn darkness on New Year ' s Day . In addition , dozens were killed , and many of the wounded have not been able to reach hospitals , according to witnesses . President Burhanuddin Rabbani ' s militia , which controls the largest chunk of Kabul , was trying to withstand an onslaught by the combined forces of Prime_Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Abdul Rashid Dostum , an ex-general in the former Communist army . At least six separate Islamic factions hold parts of the capital . Most or all were involved in the shooting , but none is considered capable of delivering a decisive blow in the 14-year-old war . The militias had formed a coalition government after ousting the Soviet-backed Communist regime in 1992 . But since then , they turned their guns on each other in a personal feud among their leaders , leaving an estimated 10 # 000 dead in Kabul and flattening entire neighborhoods . Rabbani ' s militia appeared to be clinging_to the city ' s most crucial sites , including the presidential palace in the heart of Kabul . But the palace and the sprawling grounds were hit repeatedly with rockets and artillery_fire in the heaviest fighting in six months . The extent of the damage was not immediately clear . Rabbani ' s supporters claimed that they killed 200 enemy soldiers , wounded 300 and captured 820 while suffering only 18 deaths among their fighters . However , the figures could not be confirmed and the parties regularly exaggerate their battlefield successes . The civilian casualty toll was heavy . Most of the fighting was waged with rockets and artillery shells that are notoriously inaccurate . Many missed military targets and slammed into private homes and shops that had been shuttered . The normally bustling streets of Kabul were empty except for the occasional tank and heavily armed soldiers making quick dashes from one side of the street to the other . Plumes of smoke rose into the winter sky . The city rumbled throughout the day as the rockets came crashing down . Electricity , sporadic even in periods of relative calm , was off . International phone_lines have been down for more_than a year . The airport was closed , and state-run Radio Afghanistan stopped broadcasting Saturday after the fighting began . Two shells hit the main military_hospital , a rocket hit the operating theater of the Jamhuriat hospital and several rockets landed in the grounds of a third hospital . There were no immediate details of casualties .</TEXT>
