   <HEADLINE> STUMBLING TOWARD A SHOWDOWN ? ; CLINTON NOTCHES UP PRESSURE ON HAITI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton moved a step closer to resolving the domestic political problems Haiti is causing him by tapping former Rep . William H . Gray III as his special envoy to that nation . Gray , head of the United Negro College Fund , will replace Lawrence A . Pezzullo , a U.S. Foreign Service officer whose efforts to help negotiate a settlement to the long and frustrating Haitian crisis were notably unsuccessful . With the ouster of a career diplomat in favor of a former congressman , there can be no clearer sign that , for now , the domestic ramifications of Haiti ' s turmoil have taken priority over foreign- policy ones . Of course , Haiti had become a political embarrassment for Clinton . Since taking_office the President has been in the acutely uncomfortable position of maintaining a Bush_Administration policy on Haitian refugees that candidate Bill_Clinton had condemned . The hard-hearted policy allows the U.S. Coast Guard to return refugees intercepted at_sea to their homeland . The policy has come under_fire from African Americans as well as refugee advocates . Contrasting it with the welcome_mat the United States still has out for refugees from the Castro regime in Cuba , some critics even labeled the Haitian refugee policy racist . That criticism took a dramatic turn when prominent African American activist Randall Robinson , head of the foreign-policy lobbying group TransAfrica , protested with a hunger_strike . Thus it was no coincidence that Clinton , in announcing Gray ' s appointment , also said he is ordering a policy_change . Henceforth , Haitian refugees will be accorded asylum hearings at_sea , rather than being automatically returned to authorities in Haiti for what could be a very cruel fate . Even if that results in asylum for only a_few more Haitian refugees than is currently the case , the symbolism of Clinton ' s action was enough to persuade Robinson to end his dramatic fast after 27 days . But while Clinton may have resolved his domestic problems with_regard_to Haiti , he and the United Nations must still find some way to leverage the military junta that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991 from power so that Aristide can return from exile . Last week ' s U.N. decision to impose tighter economic sanctions was necessary . But those sanctions must be given some time to work before a suggested next step is seriously considered : military_action against the Haitian junta by either a U.S. , U.N. or even an exile force . For while U.S. forces are fully capable of ousting the thugs who control Haiti -- and that would surely be satisfying to many -- military_action might only compound the challenge of nation-building for a post-junta government . Thus far the Clinton_Administration shows no signs of having cracked that part of the daunting Haitian dilemma .</TEXT>
