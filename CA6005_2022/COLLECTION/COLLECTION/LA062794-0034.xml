   <TEXT> Washington is a popular destination in the summer , but not for Switzerland ' s soccer team . If the_Swiss had beaten Colombia on Sunday at Palo Alto and won Group_A , they would have played their second-round game in Los Angeles . Instead , they will play either Spain or Bolivia in the capital next Saturday . &quot; Exactly what we did not want , &quot; said Guido Cornella , the_Swiss soccer federation ' s first vice_president , complaining that the team will have to adjust to the time change and the humidity in Washington . There is one other inconvenience . &quot; I ' m going_to Washington tomorrow ( Monday ) because our preliminary hotel reservations have fallen_through , &quot; Cornella said . ANDREA BUSHNELL</TEXT>
