   <HEADLINE> GUATEMALAN VOTERS OK ANTI-CORRUPTION AMENDMENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Guatemalans voted_out the Congress and Supreme Court in an anti-corruption referendum that drew fewer than one in five voters to the polls . Opponents of the referendum called by President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said the low turnout showed the public did not support the proposed constitutional amendments . De Leon called the turnout &quot; unfortunate &quot; but said the vote was nonetheless a defeat for the &quot; enemies of democracy. &quot; De Leon , a former human_rights lawyer , was named president by Congress last June after an attempt by former President Jorge Serrano to grab total power failed . Critics say the new president is sincere in wanting to purge corrupt officials but that the referendum is really a farce in that many members of Congress might simply be reelected . Less than 16 % of the country ' s 3.44 million eligible voters cast ballots in the referendum Sunday , according to an electoral official . Of those who voted , 370 # 044 , or 83 % , approved the 43 constitutional changes and the dismissal of Congress and the Supreme Court , the official said .</TEXT>
