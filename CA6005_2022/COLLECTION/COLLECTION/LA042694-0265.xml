   <HEADLINE> BITTER LEGACY THE LOSER AS VOTERS HEAD FOR POLLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Against all odds , South_Africans of all races will begin to go_to the polls today to liberate themselves from their own bitter history . After more_than three centuries of white rule , four decades of apartheid and four years of bloodshed , the overwhelming black majority will cast ballots for the first time , today through Thursday , to elect a government that has pledged to repudiate racism and seek social and economic justice through multi-party democracy . It is one of history ' s most unusual revolutions : An elite white minority is surrendering political power to the impoverished black majority it oppressed with Kafkaesque rules of racial classification , rigid segregation and brutal force . Those blacks now will be able to determine their own future and rule their own land . Today marks the end of the last white-ruled autocracy in Africa and the birth of the world ' s newest democracy . At exactly one minute before midnight tonight , South_Africa ' s 66-year-old flag , the tricolor standard of the old white-ruled regime , will be officially lowered for the last time . The old national_anthem , the Afrikaans-language &quot; Die Stem &quot; ( &quot; The Voice &quot; ) , will be played . Then , at one minute past the hour , South_Africa ' s new flag , the six-color hope of a new nation , will be hoisted at nine new provincial_capitals and at up_to 6 # 000 government buildings , courts , police_stations , embassies and ships in navy and merchant fleets . The black liberation anthem , &quot; Nikosi Sikelel iAfrika &quot; ( &quot; God Bless Africa &quot; ) will echo over the land as the new constitution and charter of rights come_into effect to officially guarantee basic rights and freedoms to all South_Africans for the first time since Europeans landed in Cape_Town in 1652 . Over the coming weeks and months , power and authority will pass inexorably from rich to poor , from leafy suburb to sprawling township , from 5 million whites to 30 million blacks . Expectations are high , but so are the fears . South_Africa has a climate of intolerance and a culture of violence that won ' t disappear when votes are counted . After generations in which nonwhites were denied decent housing , schools or jobs , the post-apartheid upheaval to a new form_of_government , a new legal_system , new schools and other institutions may be as difficult as the anti-apartheid struggle . The new government will inherit a heavy debt , a bloated civil_service and desperate demands for housing , education and health_care . &quot; One thing we ' ve learned is elections are the easiest part of a new democracy , &quot; Madeleine Albright , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , warned during a recent visit here . The task of holding this volatile new nation together almost certainly will fall on the patriarch of the liberation movement , a man who has never been allowed to vote_in his 75 years of trial and triumph -- Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela . Under the new constitution , which creates posts for the opposition , one of Mandela ' s top deputies is likely to be the last white president , Frederik W . de Klerk . A beaming Mandela told supporters last week that his goal was in_sight &quot; after 27 years in jail , 20 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. &quot; A wave of last-minute terror bombings , the death rattle of white_supremacy , marred the eve of the elections . It was the inevitable coda , perhaps , to a four-year transition from apartheid to democracy that saw almost 15 # 000 people , mostly black , killed by fighting for the spoils of white rule . But the bombs , blamed so far on ultra-right-wing whites , have added a pall of gloom to the elections . One bomb exploded outside a popular black restaurant Monday night in Pretoria , killing two people . Earlier , a huge car_bomb devastated a busy taxi stand_in Germiston , a Johannesburg suburb . Ten were killed and 40 injured . That followed a huge car_bomb Sunday in Johannesburg that killed nine and wounded 98 . Smaller bombs also exploded overnight at several empty polling_stations and election offices . Judge Johann Kriegler , head of the Independent Electoral Commission , said Monday that the bombings only &quot; reinforced the determination &quot; of the 22.7 million eligible voters -- including up_to 18 million first-time black voters -- to cast their ballots . &quot; The real message now is joy , &quot; Kriegler said . &quot; We ' ve come light_years in four years , and we ' ll not be deterred by minor incidents. &quot; Kriegler and his commission -- backed by more_than 200 # 000 election workers and monitors , plus about 5 # 000 international observers -- must certify whether the poll is free and fair . The commission has banned journalists from entering polling or counting stations , and Kriegler said Monday that it was &quot; arrogant &quot; for reporters to claim a right to do so . Today , the first day of voting , is expected to draw fewer than 1 million &quot; special voters. &quot; Polls will be set_up in hospitals , prisons and nursing and retirement homes . Pregnant women and blind and disabled voters will be able to cast ballots at special polling_stations . South_Africans around the world also can vote today . Polls have been set_up in 80 countries , from Argentina to Zambia . An estimated 100 # 000 South_Africans will cast ballots at 24 polling_places in 16 U.S. cities , including Los Angeles . Mandela is scheduled to cast his vote at 7:30 Wednesday morning in a battle-scarred Zulu township outside Durban in Natal province . The rest of the nation will vote all day Wednesday and Thursday , flocking to 9 # 000 schools , clinics , courthouses , post_offices and other makeshift polling_stations . Lawrence Schlemmer , a political_scientist and pollster with Johannesburg ' s Human Sciences Research Council , said reams of data from 22 # 000 interviews in the last year have proved &quot; one thing &quot; about the hopes and expectations of the newly enfranchised electorate : &quot; People expect to be treated with dignity ; their status as a human_being , as a South_African , is non-negotiable , &quot; he said . &quot; Quite frankly , I feel this election is more about honor and status than about houses and jobs. &quot; More_than 1 million spoiled ballots are expected from voters who mistakenly mark their X in the wrong place or otherwise invalidate their franchise . The official results won ' t be announced for at least 48 hours after polls close , although unofficial tallies will be available . For all_the euphoria of the moment , the election is likely to reaffirm past divisions . Polls show that only a tiny fraction of whites will vote for the ANC and that only a tiny fraction of blacks will vote for De Klerk ' s National Party . Instead , whites , Indians and mixed-race Colored voters -- all minorities now -- are likely to join a broad coalition against the black-led ANC . &quot; This is not an election about liberating minorities , &quot; Schlemmer said . &quot; It ' s an election about liberating the majority. &quot;</TEXT>
