   <HEADLINE> CHEMOTHERAPY , DIALYSIS , PACEMAKERS : ALL PART OF DOG ' S LIFE TODAY ; MEDICINE : PET OWNERS CAN CHOOSE AMONG SUCH SPECIALISTS AS DERMATOLOGISTS , ONCOLOGISTS AND CARDIOLOGISTS TO PERFORM HIGH-TECH VETERINARY SERVICES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After owning and loving her dog , Tascha , for 12 years , Dawn Schneider had to decide whether to try to save her life . Tascha , a black_English cocker_spaniel , wasn ' t expected to live for long unless she underwent a radical_mastectomy . Schneider said yes to the surgery . It was a decision Schneider repeated two more times last year after veterinarians found growths on the dog ' s other breasts and then its kidney . The operations did extend Tascha ' s life . They also relieved Schneider and her family , but left her wallet about $ 1 # 800 lighter . She dreads another pet health_care crisis . &quot; I view her as part of my family . I can ' t not do something . I couldn ' t live with the guilt if I didn ' t do everything I could , &quot; she said . As medical technology grows , pet owners face an array of sophisticated -- and expensive -- procedures : dialysis for dogs , cat chemotherapy and even pet pacemakers . Almost always , the procedures are performed without insurance . While ailing Old Yellers were taken behind the barn and shot , today ' s pet owners face tougher choices . &quot; It ' s not only an issue of how much you love your pet , but how much you can afford , &quot; Schneider said . No hard numbers for medical procedures exist ; however , the number of veterinarians in the United States grew by 49 % during the 1980s to 65 # 767 , according to the American Veterinary Medical Assn . Pet owners can choose among such specialists as dermatologists , oncologists and cardiologists to perform high-tech services . Dialysis is performed on dogs who damage their kidneys lapping_up anti-freeze , hip replacements are made_for old and fragile-boned purebreds and CAT scans are performed on cancerous cats . About 1 # 000 U.S. dog and cat owners , for instance , annually choose to fit their pets with pacemakers , and even more choose open-heart_surgery , according to Dr. Larry Tilly , a veterinarian cardiologist in Santa Fe , N.M. Ailing animals can have their lives extended up_to one or two years with pacemakers costing as little as $ 500 , compared to the $ 10 # 000 to $ 15 # 000 their owners must pay_for their own , Tilly said . Many of the pacemakers in pets are models previously used by humans . Tilly , in fact , supplies his fellow vets with used pacemakers he gets from other medical_institutions . Most other pet care procedures are a bargain when compared to the same procedures performed on humans , largely because pet insurance isn ' t widely available . People with brain_tumors might be charged $ 35 # 000 for treatment , but the same procedures could be done on a cat for $ 1 # 000 , said Steven Withrow , a veterinarian in_charge of clinical oncology at Colorado State University . Withrow ' s clinic attracts desperate pet owners from across the United States and other countries , but he said he must be able to offer relatively inexpensive treatments because of the lack of insurance . &quot; The market just won ' t bear the same prices that human physicians get_away with , &quot; Withrow said . &quot; Part of the job in veterinary_medicine is we have to be in the position to offer the Cadillac of care , but we also offer the used Volkswagen. &quot; Of course , veterinarians also offer the ultimate cost-cutting product their colleagues who work_on humans can ' t : euthanasia . The old ace-in-the-hole of veterinary care will always be around , but experts say even that choice has become more complex . Bernard Rollin , a professor of philosophy and physiology at Colorado State who studies attitudes toward animals , said people have become much more emotionally attached_to their pets . &quot; When I got started ( more_than 15 years ago ) , the idea that there was grief for a pet was ludicrous . You ' d get responses like , ' It ' s a dog , get another dog , ' &quot; Rollin said . Today , emotionally charged situations like Michelle Cobey ' s of Seattle are the norm . Cobey recalls how it took her days to decide to end the life of Mac , a scruffy black stray cat she took into her home . After a_few years , Mac ' s kidneys began failing . Eventually , Cobey decided not to pay_for dialysis . &quot; My choice was to spend $ 500 or $ 600 dollars to do some things that might help him , but might not , &quot; Cobey said . &quot; It was very , very difficult . I kept wanting somebody to tell me what to do. &quot; Every veterinarian has war stories about anguished families engaging in a grim calculus that evaluates the pet ' s quality_of_life , the owners ' emotions and the costs . Dr. Ronald Scharf , who practices outside Schenectady , said the problem is especially acute for poorer families , who might sometimes literally have to choose between shoes for the children or drugs for the dog . &quot; People of limited financial opportunities might be more of the mind to put the animal down , &quot; Scharf said . Highlighting their differences with doctors , many veterinarians consider euthanasia &quot; a gift &quot; that can put an animal out of its misery . A doctor who does that for one of his human patients can be charged with murder .</TEXT>
