   <HEADLINE> A TROUBLED CLINTON , HIS RATINGS , CURRENCY DOWN , LEAVES TODAY FOR 2ND G-7 SUMMIT ; ECONOMIES : PRESIDENT ' S IMAGE AMONG OTHER LEADERS IS NOW MIXED . MANY FACING STICKY PROBLEMS AT_HOME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just a year ago , an increasingly popular President Clinton was heading for his first economic summit in Tokyo , where he showed the world a flattering new side of a leader who had been focusing_on domestic issues . How things change . Today , Clinton departs for his second economic summit , this one in Naples , Italy , starting Friday , with his roller-coaster standing in opinion polls on the downward slope and his currency scraping a rocky bottom . Last year ' s new guy in the Group of Seven major industrial nations , to whom the other six looked_for leadership , is now just one of the gang , struggling with political problems at_home . With his six partners , Clinton ' s image is mixed . One senior Western diplomat whose country will be represented at Naples said Clinton ' s problem at_home and abroad is simple : &quot; He hasn ' t delivered. &quot; &quot; Admired ? Respected ? Yes . But there ' s an impotence &quot; about his presidency , the diplomat said . This view of Clinton is not universal . &quot; If you look_back at the economic agenda , he comes as someone who can deliver , &quot; said Henning Christophersen , the European Union ' s commissioner for financial affairs . &quot; The U.S. has non-inflationary growth ; the U.S. has a much better job-creation record than Europe. &quot; It is against such an uncertain backdrop that Clinton will meet with the leaders of Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy and Japan . During their final session Sunday they will be joined by Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin . None can claim an overwhelming mandate at_home , although Prime_Ministers Jean Chretien of Canada and Silvio Berlusconi of Italy , newly chosen , have not yet been subject_to the sniping with which many of the others must deal . &quot; The tragedy is , this is not a summit that has any leaders , &quot; said Stephan Richter , president of TransAtlantic Futures , an economic consulting_firm . The eight-day overseas trip -- the fifth of his presidency -- will also take Clinton to Poland and Latvia before the summit and to Germany after it . In each place he will try to offer reassurance that America will maintain its political and economic commitments amid a splintered world order . The image of the first visit by a U.S. President to Latvia , one of the three freedom-seeking Baltic countries that had been part of the Soviet_Union since World_War_II , may prove stirring . And Clinton ' s planned speech against the backdrop of Berlin ' s Brandenburg Gate is likely to be dramatic . But while the White_House is hoping the trip will rack_up political points at_home , the goal may prove more elusive than on the earlier trips . Foreign policy is now rated in most polls as Clinton ' s weak_point , trailing his overall approval rating by a large margin . Although Clinton ' s overseas appearances have brought him generally favorable publicity , they have done little to budge opinion . He got no more_than the slightest bounce in the polls from his well-received speech at the June 6 D-day commemoration . What sets this economic summit apart from the 19 previous annual meetings is the unusual economic situation in_the_leading industrialized democracies . In the past , such issues as economic_growth , unemployment , inflation and interest_rates have dominated the agenda . Such is not the case in 1994 . Washington is no longer beating_up on Germany to reduce interest_rates to propel faster economic_growth . While the Clinton_Administration would like Japan to do more to boost its growth_rate , the outlook there is for the current , rare recession to give_way to moderate economic_growth later this year . If U.S. interest_rates set by the Federal_Reserve are edging upward , they are not doing so at a pace that frightens political_leaders . Inflation remains largely in check . &quot; It ' s not a bad picture , &quot; said Robert D . Hormats , a vice_president of the investment_firm of Goldman , Sachs International and a former Treasury and State_Department official . Administration officials have portrayed the agenda as more of the same . &quot; The strategy we put_in place last year is working , &quot; Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said : The U.S. budget_deficit has been cut , European interest_rates are falling , and there are signs that the Japanese economy is beginning to grow . The four European_nations that will be represented at Naples recognize that they cannot criticize the U.S. economy at a time when the European unemployment_rate -- an astonishing 12 % -- is about double the U.S. rate . Nor can they complain about America ' s failure to take decisive action to solve the civil_war in Bosnia or rescue Russia ' s faltering economy -- issues on which Western Europe has fared no better . &quot; It isn ' t fair to criticize the United States , because the Europeans have been even less prepared to deliver than the U.S. , &quot; said Christophersen , the EU ' s financial affairs commissioner . There is , however , one U.S.-related problem on the informal agenda : the beleaguered dollar . Since the beginning of the year it has lost roughly 11 % of its value in_relation_to the Japanese yen and has fallen against most European currencies as well . This development makes U.S. goods cheaper overseas , to the benefit of U.S. manufacturers , and adds the equivalent of an 11 % tax on Japanese goods sold here . But it also makes foreign investment in the United States less attractive because , with the dollar falling , it takes an ever-greater return just to stay even when earnings are converted into other currencies . The dollar ' s troubles place the G-7 partners in a difficult position . The group is limited in the steps it can take_to shore_up the dollar , short of a significant increase in U.S. interest_rates that would make investments here more attractive but risk stifling growth . The Europeans , who regard the dollar as weak mostly against the yen and mostly as a result of the U.S. trade_deficit with Japan , are not particularly eager to do anything at Naples . But Hormats , the Goldman Sachs executive , said the G-7 leaders cannot duck the issue . If they do not deliver a program that looks able to stabilize the currency , he said , &quot; the markets will be disappointed and set_off a new round of volatility. &quot; The problems with the U.S. currency present a dilemma for Clinton . In the view of many experts , the U.S. economy is fundamentally sound ; there is no good economic reason for the dollar ' s decline . Rather , it is a general international uncertainty about Clinton ' s leadership , both in economic matters and in foreign_policy , that is contributing to the dollar ' s plight . &quot; The dollar is an embarrassment to the President , &quot; said Rudiger Dornbusch , an economist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . &quot; Clinton ' s total lack of leadership plays into it very strongly . It ' s not very often a President comes_to the summit with his currency in the emergency ward . It reflects very poorly on him . If he wanted to project a strong leadership image for the United States , who would believe it ? &quot; Investors see the U.S. economy slowing from its strong post-recession growth . While economic_conditions have strengthened overseas , there is &quot; a lack of confidence here , &quot; said Olin Wethington , a former assistant secretary_of_the_treasury for international affairs . &quot; Clinton ' s got_to be worried , thinking , ' Am I going_to be sitting there and see the dollar hit a new post-World War II low ? What does that say about the credibility of my leadership ? ' &quot; Wethington said . One chronic problem that just a_few weeks ago seemed solvable -- the stubborn trade_deficit with Japan -- has in recent days turned cloudy . Officials had hoped that a new round of negotiations with Japan would allow them to announce some progress . But Japanese Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata ' s governing coalition fell_apart . He was replaced by Tomiichi Murayama , a Socialist , and the new government is considered unlikely to make the reductions in government support for farmers , retailers and industry required to achieve significant progress in trade negotiations . On another front , Yeltsin ' s presence at the meeting will renew an old question for the Group of Seven : When will it become the Group of Eight ? Moscow has been pressing for such an expansion , but others point to Russia ' s serious economic woes and say it is far from earning the sort of status as an economic giant that would let it join the club . While the G-7 nations account_for roughly 11 % of the world ' s population , their economies are valued at 70 % of the world ' s gross_domestic_product . Russia is not in the same league . Prices continue to surge in Russia , government_revenue may be as much as 30 % below anticipated levels , unemployment is at least 8 % , and crime is interwoven throughout the economy &quot; like a ganglion , &quot; said Robert Legvold of Columbia University . So , there is little expectation that Yeltsin will come_away even with the promises of support that were given to Russia in 1993 , when the international community pledged roughly $ 44 billion in aid .
