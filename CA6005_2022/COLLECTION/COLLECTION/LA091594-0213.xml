   <HEADLINE> BASEBALL ' 94 : GOING , GOING . . . GONE ; IT ' S THE STRAW THAT BREAKS AUTRYS ' BACKS ; ANGELS : OWNERS WILL EVENTUALLY SELL TEAM FOR $ 130 MILLION AFTER AN AGREEMENT . DISNEY A POSSIBLE BUYER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Angel owner Jackie Autry , who has warned for years that major_league baseball was headed for calamity , no longer bears the burden_of_proof . Autry signed the document that formally ended the 1994 season Wednesday , then said that she and her husband , Gene Autry , have decided to sell the ballclub . She added , however , that there will be no sale until there has been resolution of baseball ' s labor dispute . The Autrys have told four prospective buyers that they are asking $ 130 million , although only 23 % of the club will be sold while Gene Autry , 87 , remains alive . &quot; I know I ' ve said repeatedly that the club is not for_sale , but it ' s come_to a point where enough is enough , &quot; Jackie Autry said . &quot; You can only take so_much money out of_your_own pocket . &quot; We just had to make that decision to do something to make more people responsible_for the bottom_line . &quot; I think it ' s about time fans and the media understand that here you have an owner who loves baseball , but the current situation makes_it impossible for him to carry the burden himself. &quot; Terms of the sale , according to sources familiar_with the negotiations , stipulate an immediate $ 30-million fee for 23 % of the club . The minority owner then will be required to pay Autry $ 3 million each year to maintain the option to purchase the rest of the club within six months of Gene Autry ' s death . The new owner will become managing partner immediately , according to Jackie Autry , responsible_for all operating_costs , and any possible debt . The Autrys , however , will receive 67 % of profits until 100 % completion of the sale . &quot; Gene loves baseball , but he ' s 87 , and it ' s time for him to relinquish total control of the club , &quot; Jackie Autry said . &quot; Nobody is a bottomless pit . Everybody keeps saying Gene Autry is so rich . . . . Well , it ' s nobody ' s business whether Gene is worth one penny or $ 300 million . How long do you want to keep borrowing just to pay the payroll ? &quot; This has been like a freight_train coming_down the track and no one has stopped it . I was the first to say this back in 1990 , and people said , ' Well , that ' s Jackie Autry . What does she know about baseball ? ' &quot; She would not identify the four prospective buyers , but it is believed she has had preliminary negotiations with Walt Disney Co . and billionaire Marvin Davis . Gene Autry paid $ 2 million for the expansion club in 1961 , but has been operating it the last five years without any minority partners . Jackie Autry said the team will lose $ 8 million this season . &quot; It ' s just so depressing , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s sad when it has to come_to this. &quot; Autry ' s problems are a microcosm of the financial difficulties major_league owners say they are enduring , and it is why major_league baseball officially shut_down the season Wednesday . &quot; I never thought I ' d be embarrassed to be a major_league ballplayer , but I am now , &quot; Angel infielder Rex Hudler said . &quot; I can ' t even look people in the face right now . &quot; It ' s a horrible thing , and everyone that was part of this will be scarred for the rest of their lives. &quot; Hudler , so angered at the news Wednesday , ripped his shirt while watching acting commissioner Bud Selig ' s press_conference , sending buttons flying . Angel players were told of the official decision in a conference_call conducted by Mark Langston , their player representative . Until there is a settlement , the Angels will be wondering about their futures . Will the new owner make front-office changes ? What will happen to their free_agents -- Bo Jackson , Harold Reynolds , Bob Patterson , Ken Patterson , Hudler and John Dopson ? When can the Angels resume negotiations with Chili Davis about a multiyear contract that will pay him about $ 4 million a year ? Angel President Richard Brown said , &quot; Right now , we can ' t do anything with any intelligence because we don ' t know what rules we ' re operating on . We ' re just going_to have to wait. &quot; The Angels have eight players under contract for the 1995 season , but no one knows what will happen to the rest . Several owners privately say they will open spring_training camps on_time next season , and if there still is no labor_agreement , will invite players to come_into camp , crossing the picket_lines . &quot; Brian ( Anderson ) said to me the other day , ' Mom , what would I do ? ' &quot; said Janet Anderson , mother of the Angel rookie pitcher . &quot; ' I don ' t have millions sitting around. ' &quot; Anderson , who has begun taking accounting classes at Wright State in Dayton , Ohio , said he would not cross picket_lines . &quot; There ' s going_to have to be a time when a decision has to be made , but I ' m not going_to be a trend setter and cross , &quot; he said . Said rookie outfielder Jim Edmonds : &quot; It ' s just amazing what this has done to all_of us . It ' s like I don ' t even care about the World_Series . I ' m not a fan anymore. &quot; The Angels now are left with the bitter taste of a 47-68 season , second-worst winning percentage in franchise history . Most painful , of course , is the idea that baseball will be left without a World_Series for the first time since 1904 . What once seemed incomprehensible has become reality . Said outfielder Tim Salmon , &quot; We made history , and it ' s sure a lousy feeling to know you ' re part of it. &quot;</TEXT>
