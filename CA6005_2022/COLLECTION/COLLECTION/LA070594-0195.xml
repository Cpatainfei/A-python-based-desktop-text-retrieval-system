   <HEADLINE> REBELS TAKE_OVER CAPITAL IN RWANDA ; AFRICA : FRANCE BROADENS ROLE , THREATENS FORCE IF INSURGENTS CROSS LINE . ACTIONS COULD MARK TURNING POINT IN 3-MONTH-OLD WAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rebel troops overran Rwanda ' s capital and consolidated their hold_on its second-largest city Monday , prompting French forces to declare the shrinking government-held pocket in the southwest a safe area under French protection . The advances by the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels and France ' s determination to protect the Hutu-led rump government in the southwest seemed to mark a turning point in the 3-month-old civil_war , which has torn this small Central African_nation apart and led to extensive tribal slaughter , leaving hundreds of thousands dead . France previously had insisted that its 12-day-old military intervention would be strictly humanitarian , steering clear of the civil_war that has raged since April 6 . But Col . Didier Thiebault , French commander in the south , announced at forward headquarters here Monday that he has ordered that if the rebel front &quot; comes here and threatens the population , we will open_fire against them without any hesitation. &quot; With the capital , Kigali , and the second-largest city , Butare , in their hands , the rebels control two-thirds of the country , mainly in the northeast and southeast . Recent rapid rebel advances have left France with a choice of risking direct involvement in the war or withdrawing its troops farther west toward the border with Zaire , 95 miles from here . To have done the latter , French officers argued , would have made a mockery of the humanitarian mission that France says is the reason for its involvement here . Still , drawing_a_line around a large stretch of southwestern Rwanda and declaring it an inviolable humanitarian protection zone leaves France open_to charges of once again propping_up the reeling Rwandan army and the Hutu extremists responsible_for much of the killing . In the early 1990s , French helicopters intervened decisively against the rebels to protect the regime of the late President Juvenal Habyarimana , whose death in a suspicious plane crash April 6 sparked the latest round of bloodletting . French officials insisted that their action in Rwanda is purely humanitarian . &quot; Despite the deteriorating situation and the intensified fighting , we are resolutely continuing our humanitarian operation , &quot; a French Foreign Ministry spokesman said . &quot; We have taken the initiative of setting_up a safe humanitarian zone in western Rwanda. &quot; Paris decided to go_ahead with the zone without waiting for a formal green_light from the U.N. Security_Council president , expected today . The rebels said they would ignore the_French ultimatum . In a letter to U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and to the U.N. Security_Council president , the rebels said French troops have no business in Rwanda and risked a confrontation . &quot; The so-called security zone which France proposes to establish is in_effect really only a safe haven for the authors and perpetrators of the genocide , &quot; wrote Gerald Gahima , the front ' s special envoy to the United States and the United Nations . The rebels urged the Security_Council to facilitate the deployment of a proposed force from the Organization of African Unity and the immediate withdrawal of French forces . The front is composed mostly of Tutsis , who make_up only 14 % of Rwanda ' s population . Almost everyone else in the country is Hutu , including the bulk of the army . White_House spokesman Jeff Eller said , &quot; The Administration continues to monitor French efforts in Rwanda &quot; but had not yet had a chance to ask the_French for details . It was unclear Monday whether the fall of Kigali marked a major rout of government forces by the rebels or whether the government troops simply decided to stage a tactical withdrawal . There were no reports of large_numbers of government troops being killed or taken prisoner , and it appeared that most of the troops defending the capital had fled well ahead of the rebels ' entry . There were only a_few thousand people left in Kigali , most of them seeking shelter . Almost the entire population was dependent_on relief food that comes_in intermittently on two daily Canadian flights from Nairobi , Kenya . The rebels ' arrival in Kigali freed more_than 8 # 000 Tutsis who had been living_in terror of government-trained Hutu militias . A spokesman for the small U.N. peacekeeping mission in Rwanda said the rebels had overrun the Defense Ministry , army headquarters and Radio Rwanda , which had incited massacres of Tutsis by civilian militiamen with its broadcasts of ethnic hate messages . &quot; They were jubilant , &quot; spokesman Maj . Jean-Guy Plante said of the Tutsi civilians freed from refuges in churches and a hotel . Trying to avoid a confrontation , the_French withdrew Sunday from Butare as rebels approached . But they vowed Monday to stand and fight if rebels attempt military_action beyond Gikongoro , 15 miles west of Butare . The French have jet fighter-bombers stationed 300 miles away in Kisangani in eastern Zaire to provide potential air support , but their decision still appeared fraught with pitfalls . There are fewer than 1 # 000 French soldiers inside Rwanda , armed with nothing heftier than heavy mortars , antitank missiles , helicopters and armored cars equipped with 90-millimeter cannon . Refugees fleeing into Burundi or Zaire could pose serious problems for those countries , and even before Monday ' s rebel advances , up_to 100 # 000 Rwandans were reported heading toward Burundi . Burundi , with the same ethnic mix as Rwanda , is undergoing an ethnic and political crisis as it prepares to choose a new president next Tuesday . Zaire is already politically shaky . Thousands of Rwandans were reportedly massacred in ethnic clashes last year in areas bordering Rwanda .</TEXT>
