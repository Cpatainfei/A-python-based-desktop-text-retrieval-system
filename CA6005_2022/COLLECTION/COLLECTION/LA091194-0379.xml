   <HEADLINE> O.C. VIETNAMESE BECOMING LINKS TO EMERGING DEALS ; TRADE : U.S. COMPANIES ARE TURNING TO BUSINESS PEOPLE HERE WITH FAMILY TIES AND CONNECTIONS TO THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN_NATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County ' s large Vietnamese American community , in helping to expand commerce with Vietnam , is becoming a brokerage center -- forging deals between their home country and American companies looking_to trade there . To locate scarce Vietnamese buyers , many U.S. companies are turning_to Vietnamese American business people with family ties and connections in Vietnam to serve as their representatives . Familiarity with Vietnam ' s language and customs are particularly important for forging lasting ties_in that nation , said Young Huynh , executive_director of Irvine-based CJY Trading Inc. Without reliable telephone and mail services , much business is conducted in face-to-face meetings , he said . Huynh , who recently became a distributor for Sunbeam-Oster Co. ' s household_appliances and for another company ' s hardware division , met with officials during a trip to Hanoi , Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang last spring . Though he had previously worked as a computer reseller in Irvine , Huynh said he didn ' t think that many in Vietnam -- where the annual household income is less than $ 300 -- would be able to afford the $ 1 # 000 machines . &quot; You have to pick the right products to sell , &quot; he said . &quot; Maybe in a year people will start looking_for computers. &quot; Officials with other Vietnamese American companies tell similar stories of how they have sold equipment , brokered sales , or became agents for large American corporations in the months since the Clinton_Administration in February lifted the trade_embargo with Vietnam . The rise of trade ties comes despite some opposition from community leaders in Orange County , who argue that a continued economic embargo would have pushed the Vietnamese government to respect human_rights . The more that trade helps the Vietnamese economy , the less incentive there is for the government to hold clean , multi-party elections , said Bui Binh Ban , president of the Vietnamese Community of Southern California , a social_services organization based in Westminster . &quot; Whoever helps them ( the government ) to survive is against our community , &quot; said Ban . He said he had hoped trade with Vietnam would not develop as has American trade with China , which has been criticized by some here as lacking respect for human_rights . From January through June , U.S. exports to Vietnam were $ 29.6 million , compared to $ 7 million for all_of 1993 ( when some humanitarian goods were allowed to be shipped ) , according to the U.S. Department_of_Commerce . Imports from Vietnam for the first six months of this year were $ 10.5 million , up from no imports in 1993 . Commerce_Department officials said they didn ' t know how much of that money flows through Orange County but that they receive a steady stream of inquires from the Little Saigon business_district along Bolsa Avenue , between Ward and Magnolia streets . The 1990 U.S. Census counted 70 # 500 Vietnamese in Orange County , making_it the largest concentration outside of Vietnam . The Little Saigon area of Westminster is the main shopping district , but the local Vietnamese American population and its businesses are spread throughout the county . Though many local Vietnamese had ties to the South Vietnamese government and are skeptical of doing business there now , their children -- some of whom don ' t remember much of the war -- are putting the most effort into establishing trade ties , said Xuan Nhi Ho , president of Vietnam Investment and Trade Opportunity Project Inc. in Stanton . Ho said he expects trade with Vietnam may come_to resemble the deals he already arranges elsewhere in Asia , such_as importing coffee and rice for American companies . While U.S. companies currently lack the distribution channels set_up by their Asian and European rivalS , which have been doing business in Vietnam for years , Ho said Vietnamese consumers tend to recognize American brand names . The recognition dates_from the years of U.S. military involvement and from the American products previously sold there -- despite the trade ban -- through third-country middlemen , he said . With many government-owned businesses lacking solid track records in financial management , however , Ho said he often has difficulty persuading U.S. banks to loan entrepreneurs the funds needed to make such trades . &quot; People want to see American ( products ) . . . but it ' s hard to find the financial_backing , &quot; Ho said . Bart Chapman , who is president and chief_executive of Health Trade International in Mission Viejo , said he hoped American banks and government_agencies would offer softer terms on loans to better compete with favorable financing arrangements made by Japanese and Korean competitors . &quot; It might be expensive , but it would be worth it , &quot; Chapman said . &quot; I talk to business people and I ask them , ' If you could have been in Japan in the 1950s , knowing what you know now , would you have done_it ? ' that ' s the comparison. &quot; With an estimated population of 71.8 million , many expect that development in Vietnam will increase demand for foreign products , such_as agricultural and manufacturing equipment , as well as for professional services . Gordon Pfeiffer , a Pasadena attorney and business consultant who has spent three months in Vietnam so far this year , said those interested in brokering deals will find that the Vietnamese government wants to discourage short-term arrangements . &quot; If you ' re just trying to put_together a_few deals and make some commissions , that ' s not the way to go . You ' re going to have trouble , &quot; he said . Not all_the interest in Vietnam is from brokers , however . EPG International in Anaheim recently sold $ 25 # 000 worth of the water-filtering equipment it manufactures to the city of Hanoi and expects to sell more soon . The company also exports more_than $ 500 # 000 in goods to Indonesia , Hong Kong and Thailand , said Philip Nguyen , an EPG vice_president . Nguyen , who visited Hanoi in April to attend a trade show organized by Orange County backers , said the sale began with government contacts he made through friends . ( Another mission , sponsored by the Vietnamese Chamber_of_Commerce and the Asian Business League of California , is planned for later this year. ) EPG has several competitors in the United States that don ' t have such good Vietnamese contacts , he said , and therefore aren ' t yet a presence . &quot; We think that we have the product and the price to beat them , &quot; he said . Kim-Yen Huynh , an assistant manager of Cathay Bank ' s Westminster office in Little Saigon , said that she has received a steady stream of inquiries from area residents since the embargo was lifted . &quot; The majority of them want to be brokers , the middle person , &quot; she said . &quot; They still want to go_to manufacturers here . . . but they ' ll be the ones who would go_back and forth &quot; to Vietnam to make the sales . Though many of Orange County ' s Vietnamese American business people are anxious to begin trade with Vietnam , Huynh said she respects the views of those who are anti-communist . She said she does not expect the issue will divide the community . &quot; The majority of people I do business with are in favor of going_back to Vietnam , of helping our country . But you can ' t forget the people who are against &quot; the opening of trade , she said . Times research librarian Kathy McLaughlin contributed to this report .</TEXT>
