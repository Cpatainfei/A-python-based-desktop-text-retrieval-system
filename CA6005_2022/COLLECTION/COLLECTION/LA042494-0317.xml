   <HEADLINE> AN EMERGING ASIAN TIGER : THE VIETNAMESE CONNECTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nearly two decades after the fall of Saigon , the Vietnamese are the world ' s newest major global tribe . Long the pawns of hegemonic pow ers , they have established a world wide economic and cultural net work well-suited to take_advantage of a potential economic boom in their native country . The Vietnamese diaspora grew out of their national tragedy . When the United States withdrew from Vietnam in 1975 , almost two million Vietnamese fled into exile in more_than 50 countries ; nearly half settled in North_America . The largest community is in Southern California . As a result , the overseas Vietnamese , or viet kieu , have become a de_facto cosmopolitan people , establishing strong business and communications links in such diverse economic centers as San Jose , Greater Los Angeles , Houston , Seattle , Paris , Sydney and Vancouver . &quot; It ' s the beginning of a diaspora phenomena , &quot; observes Michigan State University sociologist Ruben G . Rumbaut , a leading scholar on the community . &quot; The events of 1975 were like a fission_bomb : They splintered Vietnamese all_over the globe. &quot; Today , with the lifting of the U.S. embargo on commerce with Vietnam and that country ' s gradual re-integration into the world economy , this &quot; fission &quot; is turning_into a &quot; fusion &quot; linking the dispersed Vietnamese communities . The Vietnamese are gradually learning how to exploit their dispersion into an economic and cultural asset . For a traditionally agricultural people , this transformation has been unsettling and difficult . In the United States , Vietnamese communities have struggled with language problems , high rates of welfare dependency , predatory gang warfare and internecine political conflicts . In part , these problems stem from the suddenness of their departure from Vietnam . Three-fifths of all 1975 refugees , notes Whittier College sociologist Steven Gold , had less than 24 hours to prepare_for exile ; four-fifths had less than a week . Subsequent immigrant waves have largely consisted_of &quot; boat people. &quot; Yet , the Vietnamese in the United States have begun to make remarkable progress . Although as_many as 88 % of all new refugees start_out unemployed , within three years , that percentage falls below 30 % , according to a University of Michigan Study . More impressive , virtually destitute communities have created thriving immigrant economies , notably in Westminster ' s Little Saigon . Indeed , even amid a still shaky Southern California retail market , the area ' s landmark shopping_center , the Asian Garden Mall , is not only fully occupied but has a waiting list of 58 . Little Saigon ' s economic dynamism in an environment of relative poverty and still high unemployment highlights the presence of one segment of California ' s estimated $ 140 billion &quot; underground economy. &quot; Those familiar_with Vietnamese enterprises admit that many operate outside the formal legal economic structure . Sewing shops , even food-processing plants thrive in back yards , anterooms and garages , providing income that supplements welfare and other assistance . &quot; Vietnamese are always hiding something , &quot; says veteran Vietnamese journalist Thuy Le . &quot; The psychology from back home was that we are always being invaded by someone , so you never reveal what you are doing. &quot; Yet , the next generation of Vietnamese seems certain to find their place within the economic mainstream . This prediction is more_than simply a result of Vietnamese predominating among the ranks of valedictorians in many Southern California communities , particularly in northern Orange County . Among 77 nationalities studied in South Florida and San Diego , Vietnamese youngsters boasted , on average , higher grade-point averages and studied longer than native-born and other ethnic immigrants . To Rumbaut , co-author of this study , these cultural factors suggest that , over time , Vietnamese welfare dependency and impoverishment will dramatically fall . &quot; No group started_out more indigent in modern U.S. history than the Vietnamese , &quot; he says . &quot; But as far as the children are concerned , what is clearly happening is an economic shift toward becoming a well-educated and economically successful population. &quot; Already , Vietnamese are increasingly represented in the professional and technological life of their communities . The under-40 generation , in particular , composes much of the technical and engineering staff at many high-technology companies in Southern California . But perhaps the greatest opportunities lie_in the expansion of links between overseas Vietnamese and the emerging economy of their homeland . With nearly 70 million people and important natural_resources , Vietnam is widely expected to become the next Asian &quot; tiger. &quot; In the last two years , GDP growth has approached 7 % , with double-digit increases in trade . The expanding technical and entrepreneurial prowess of the overseas Vietnamese may accelerate economic development back home . Some , like Fountain Valley attorney Hoa Phu Truong , use their U.S.-honed skills and Vietnamese cultural backgrounds to steer U.S. multinational corporations through the ever-changing course of doing business with a reforming communist regime . These links to the home country could stimulate Vietnamese-oriented businesses throughout California . Some realtors report a growing flow of capital from Vietnam as entrepreneurs there seek safe havens for their excess cash . Others , such_as developer Frank Jao , who is most often associated with Little Saigon ' s development , envision more legitimate overseas trade-related activities supplanting strictly immigrant-oriented retail business . &quot; Little Saigon will be like Koreatown in Los Angeles , &quot; Jao predicts , &quot; but well beyond that . It will be like Hong Kong is to China. &quot; For many older Vietnamese , however , potentially profitable economic links pose dilemmas . Yen Do , editor of Westminster-based Nguoi Viet , the diaspora ' s leading Vietnamese language newspaper , foresees &quot; a period of confusion &quot; as the older generation , within Vietnam and overseas , learns to bury old resentments and work for common benefits . To smooth this process , Do and other leading Vietnamese business and cultural figures have set_up an organization called Project Twenty . Its main goal is to prepare the community for next April ' s 20-year observance of the fall of Saigon . Do has actively recruited younger Vietnamese because he fears they could lose interest in their native country if not participants in its reconciliation . Paradoxically , Vietnamese look largely to their traditional enemies , the Chinese , who occupied their country for nearly a millennia , as role_models for their tribe ' s development . Vietnamese officials have studied the Chinese experience in Singapore and Taiwan , as well as the course of the mainland market , to guide their economic development . Taiwan and Hong Kong are the dominant overseas investors in Vietnam , helping drive per-capita incomes in the area of former Saigon , the traditional focus of Chinese interest , to nearly twice those in Hanoi and other parts of the country . Even within the local Vietnamese diaspora community , it has been the ethnic Chinese , roughly one-third the total , who have been quickest to re-establish economic ties with the mother_country . Yet , if the Chinese provide the dominant force , Vietnamese suspicions of them may lead officials to seek ever-closer ties with their brethren in North_America , Australia and Europe . In particular , U.S. technology , capital and military might are seen as counterweights to the potential re-imposition of Chinese domination over Vietnam and Southeast_Asia . After 20 years , Vietnam ' s wayward children could end_up with front-row seats in the development of a new and powerful Asian economy . For the United States , and particularly Southern California , the potential blessings of such a tribal connection could be enormous. *</TEXT>
