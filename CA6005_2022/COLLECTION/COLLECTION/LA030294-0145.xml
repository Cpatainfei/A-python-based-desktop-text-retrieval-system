   <HEADLINE> ARAFAT , PEACE PLAN TARGETS OF FURY AMONG PALESTINIANS ; MIDEAST : CONSTITUENTS SAY PLO CHIEF LEFT DOOR OPEN FOR MASSACRE . AND PEACE PROCESS HAS LOST CREDIBILITY , HE SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan . But in the whitewashed villas that are the Palestine Liberation Organization ' s headquarters in exile , there is little fasting going_on . The chain-smoking starts at noon and carries_on until dawn . Coffee_cups stand_in wet rings amid scattered ashes on PLO executives ' desktops . Here and there , the furtive bottle of Scotch finds its way onto the table by midafternoon . These are hard_times , maybe too hard for religion . PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat is keeping the prescribed dawn-to-dusk fast and makes the regulation five prayers a day . But sitting in his office beneath a huge mural of the golden dome of Jerusalem ' s Al Aqsa mosque , he looks drawn and distant . With the Prophet Mohammed ' s path to heaven depicted in bright color behind him , and his aides in respectful reverence seated around him , he seems very much alone . After last week ' s massacre of 48 Palestinians at a Hebron mosque , the PLO leader -- who has banked his future on peace with Israel -- has found the door , once again , slammed shut . Trying_for years to run a revolution by fax and speaker phone from across the Mediterranean_Sea , Arafat finds himself at a new deadlock with Israel only weeks before he could have concluded a peace agreement and planned his triumphal return to Palestine . Now Palestinians throughout the occupied territories , Lebanon and Jordan are ripping down his photographs , burning effigies of his trademark fatigues and checkered scarf , blaming him for the peace plan they say left the door open_to a Jewish settler ' s murderous fury . The rest of the world will hold him accountable if he doesn ' t go_back to the peace talks with Israel . And Arafat , the blustery guerrilla leader who has been the single constant of the Palestinian revolution , grows quiet when he is asked if he can carry his people with him if he goes_back to the peace table now . &quot; No , &quot; he says softly . &quot; To speak frankly , no . And you know why . Because the peace process has lost its credibility . &quot; I have to understand their feeling . Furious , &quot; Arafat says , sitting at his desk at 2 a.m. after an emergency meeting of the PLO Executive Committee to find a way_out of the crisis . &quot; I promised them that there is peace , and what was the result ? Massacre . . . . These are my people , and I am responsible_for every one , every family , every victim , every injured person . And every person is asking now , ' If this is peace , is this the price of peace ? ' &quot; Throughout Tunis , the attack that killed 48 worshipers during a holy Friday of Ramadan has led to a sea change in attitudes toward the Declaration of Principles signed with Israel in September , a rising tide of doubt about whether the agreement will ever be carried_out -- or whether it ever should . Arafat and his top lieutenants are struggling to gain enough face-saving concessions from Israel on controlling Jewish settlements to allow them to resume negotiations . But even some PLO leaders who initially supported the agreement -- they were a bare majority -- are having second_thoughts now . Many are demanding sweeping new negotiations that would abandon the idea of Palestinian self-rule &quot; first &quot; in Jericho and the Gaza Strip and put issues like Palestinian statehood , an end to Jewish settlements and the status of Jerusalem immediately on the table . &quot; There will be no more two stages of a settlement . There will be one stage : dismantling settlements , ending occupation , normalizing relations , &quot; said Bassam abu Sharif , a longtime Arafat political adviser . &quot; Condemnation , apology , sorrow means nothing . It means nothing . What means something concrete is a serious step toward peace . . . and dismantling the settlements built illegally is an indispensable step. &quot; Jawid Hussein , a PLO Executive Committee_member who supported Arafat on peace with Israel , said it is time for the organization to abandon minor talks and start discussing a complete Israeli pullout from the occupied West_Bank . &quot; There is a two-year delay under the ( current plan ) for discussing the final status &quot; of the occupied territories , Hussein said . &quot; This massacre is another proof that as long as you have occupation , you are going_to have violence . There is practically a consensus among the Executive Committee of the PLO that we should really look toward a comprehensive and just peace and move as soon as possible toward it . Because of the delay in applying the withdrawal , we are giving_way to the extremists to have the upper hand. &quot; At stake is the PLO ' s fear that , locked_away in Tunis from the 1.2 million Palestinians in the occupied territories and the millions more in exile abroad , the organization has lost the momentum toward peace and faces the prospect of signing an agreement that lacks popular backing . &quot; The Palestinian people at the beginning of this , by an overwhelming majority , supported the peace process , &quot; said Yasser Abed-Rabbo , PLO information department chief . &quot; Now the overwhelming majority of the Palestinian people , the same majority , is taking a position refusing the resumption of talks and negotiations unless there are guarantees to protect the lives of Palestinians. &quot; Israel ' s offers to crack_down only on extremist settlers , a move regarded_as largely cosmetic here , have left the PLO unwilling to go_back to the revolution but unable to proceed with peace . &quot; We don ' t want to kill the peace process , &quot; Abed-Rabbo said . &quot; But we don ' t want the peace process to kill us. &quot; Throughout the PLO headquarters here , there is deep frustration in the delay in implementing the Declaration of Principles , under which the Israeli army was to begin withdrawing from Jericho and Gaza on Dec . 13 . Instead , negotiators got bogged down in details over how large the Jericho district would be , whether Palestinian guards would stand at the border crossings and whether Palestinian cars could lead joint security patrols . Ahmed Suleiman Khoury ( also known as Abu Alaa ) , who headed the secret talks in Norway that produced the September agreement , said the negotiations went astray when they fixated on details rather than a frank , faithful assumption that both sides would act in good_faith and that details would take_care of themselves . Now , he said , April 13 -- the day when the Israeli army is to have completed its withdrawal -- looms dangerously , and even he , one of the strongest proponents of the peace accord , worries about its future . &quot; If the 13th of April comes without a withdrawal , I have my doubts the agreement will fly , &quot; he said . The Hebron massacre came as a devastating blow to those closest to the negotiations , precisely because they were so close to concluding an accord . Two days before the incident , PLO sources said , negotiators had reached agreement that Arafat and Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin would sign a final accord in Cairo on March 10 , with the Israeli withdrawal to commence on March 13 and be complete by April 13 . A team of PLO officials was to have parachuted into Gaza and Jericho to start working_out details of the transition this past Monday . Now all_of that is_on hold . And for Arafat , this week ' s new standoff has been a battle of nerves that aides say the PLO chairman may be losing . Arafat , they say , is growing convinced that Rabin is trying to undo him personally . They say he believes that Rabin ' s delays in promised releases of Palestinian prisoners were a deliberate attempt to deprive Arafat of the popular response those releases would elicit . Rabin , he believes , may have gone_back_on his promise to sign an agreement 10 days after the initial Dec . 13 deadline ; this would be part of a strategy to finalize a peace accord but , in the process , to fatally undermine the PLO leader . He suspects that Rabin ' s primary fear is not of giving_up territory but that Arafat will go_in triumph to Jericho and use it as a base for building a Palestinian state . &quot; Arafat is starting to worry , somewhere in his subconscious , that the Israelis are out_to get him , &quot; an adviser said . &quot; And once he starts to believe they ' re out_to get him personally , the whole game will change. &quot; Yet Arafat is playing his own game of nerves . Far from admitting defeat or abandoning deadlines , the PLO leader is preparing to hold the Israelis to the June deadline envisioned in the agreement for withdrawal from population centers in the West_Bank and preparation for elections . Under these circumstances , he says , why argue any further over the size of the Jericho self-rule enclave ? Those closest to the PLO leader say he will hold_out for more concessions . But in the end , he will go_back to the peace talks because he has no choice . &quot; Arafat cut all his back roads both to the Palestinian people and to the Arab world , and he knows he will not be accepted if he tries to come_back to them now , &quot; said a senior PLO official who has opposed the Gaza-Jericho plan. &quot; PLO officials committed to negotiating the Gaza-Jericho agreement say two things must happen for the negotiations to resume . First , Israel must come_forward with a credible package of protections , which at minimum disarms Jewish settlers entering Palestinian population centers , releases more prisoners and provides_for a temporary international presence in the occupied territories . Then , they say , the Israelis must return to the bargaining table , not to haggle over details but to implement the spirit of the agreement . This means , they admit , a dangerous commitment on both sides to the idea that a former enemy can be trusted . * PRAISE FROM U.S. : Warren Christopher calls Arafat ' indispensable ' to peace .
