   <HEADLINE> CANADA LEADER VOWS TO DEFEAT SEPARATISTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In his first speech since the election of a separatist government in the province of Quebec , Canadian Prime_Minister Jean Chretien vowed Sunday to defeat the separatists in an upcoming referendum battle and &quot; put the issue ( of Quebec independence ) behind us. &quot; &quot; The first responsibility of a prime_minister of Canada is to ensure the unity of the country . Let there be absolutely no doubt : This I will do , &quot; Chretien said in a nationally televised address to the annual meeting of the Canadian Chamber_of_Commerce in Quebec_City . But Chretien also sought to reassure those who fear that the pressures of the Quebec situation will divert him from tough decisions on the economic front . &quot; I will make the case for Canada by concentrating_on providing good government , on providing jobs and economic_growth , on getting our fiscal house in_order and on modernizing the roles and responsibilities of the federal_government , &quot; he said . Specifically , he said his government this fall will encourage national debate on a &quot; discussion paper &quot; of proposed social_service program reforms aimed at cost-cutting , increased efficiency and removing disincentives to work . He also reiterated a pledge to reduce the federal_deficit from the 6 % of gross_domestic_product it was when he took_office last year to 3 % by the end of 1996 . Proposals to change social_services and reduce the deficit are certain to be controversial and may place greater financial burdens on the provinces . Thus , they could give Quebec separatists ammunition in their campaign to leave Canada . But Chretien must balance those concerns against protests elsewhere in the country that Quebec has dominated the national agenda for too long , forcing aside more important issues . The prime_minister ' s speech came six days after the Parti Quebecois , dedicated to Quebec independence , won 77 of 125 seats in the provincial Parliament . Parti Quebecois leader Jacques Parizeau , who will be the new Quebec premier , has promised a referendum to ask the province ' s voters if they want to establish their own country . Chretien said the vote was for a change of government , not for separatism . He also gently mocked Parizeau ' s oft-repeated statement that it is &quot; normal &quot; for Quebeckers to want a &quot; normal &quot; country of_their_own . He said Quebeckers should ask themselves if it is &quot; normal &quot; to break_up such a successful nation as Canada . And , drawing a standing_ovation , Chretien asserted that Canada is no &quot; normal country , &quot; but an exceptional one , the finest in the world . Except for that remark , and a spirited &quot; Vive le Canada &quot; at the end , Chretien ' s speech was lacking in emotion . Speaking alternately in English and French , as is typical of political speeches in Canada , Chretien said he will share leadership in opposing the referendum with Daniel Johnson , the outgoing Quebec premier . Johnson , head of the province ' s Liberal_Party , was defeated in the election but impressed many with a stronger-than-predicted showing . The Parti Quebecois and the Liberals split the popular vote almost evenly , but the PQ won more seats because of its popularity in the more numerous French-speaking districts . Chretien is a veteran of the 30-year struggle between federalists and separatists and played a key role in the campaign that defeated the previous referendum on Quebec sovereignty , in 1980 . His hometown is Shawinigan , a pulp- and aluminum-manufacturing center about 80 miles northeast of Montreal .</TEXT>
