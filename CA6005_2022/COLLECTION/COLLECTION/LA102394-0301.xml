   <HEADLINE> ELECTIONS / VENTURA ' S MEASURE E ; CLOSED STREET DIVIDES SCHOOL , RESIDENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the lunch bell rings , Aron Ruiz and dozens of his classmates pile out of the Ventura High_School weight room and head across Poli Street toward the cafeteria . Ignoring the painted crosswalk , the teen-agers cut a broad diagonal from curb to curb and even saunter down the middle of the avenue . They act_as if they own the street . In a way , they do . A normally busy thoroughfare , the four-block stretch of Poli Street that bisects the high_school campus has been closed to traffic during school hours since early 1993 . The City_Council acted swiftly to close Poli Street in the wake of community outrage over the after-school stabbing death of a Ventura High student . Parents and school officials say the closure has helped keep dangerous intruders off campus and cut_down on traffic noise , dramatically improving the campus environment . As 16-year-old Aron said : &quot; It ' s dumb to have a street running_through the middle of a school. &quot; But a feisty group of residents from the hillside above Ventura High is fighting to reverse the council decision , sponsoring a ballot initiative called Measure E that would reopen Poli Street immediately . The initiative ' s proponents say the closure of Poli Street clogs traffic on Main_Street , obstructs emergency vehicles entering the area , and forces hillside residents to drive far out of their way to get_around their own neighborhood . They are angry not only about the metal gates shutting_off Poli Street from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. every day , but also the chain-rope barricades that are put_up during the same hours on two nearby residential streets -- Sunset Drive and Palomar Avenue . Hillside residents requested the Sunset and Palomar barricades after the closure of Poli Street , when hundreds of motorists detoured onto the quiet and narrow streets . * But what they really want , Measure E proponents say , is to reopen Poli Street so they can get_rid_of the chain-ropes blocking residential streets . &quot; We are not against the school , &quot; said Hazel Imbrecht , a hillside resident whose children graduated from Ventura High . &quot; We ' ve supported the school all these years . But it seems that right now we live_in a gated community that we didn ' t ask for. &quot; Now , as the Measure E campaign moves_into its final weeks , the fight between the two groups is growing nastier . The camps tend to split_down generational lines , with parents and students working against the measure and many elderly neighbors hoping to reopen the street . The initiative ' s proponents accuse parents and school officials of ignoring possible alternatives to the street closure , such_as fencing in the entire campus , building an overpass for traffic along Poli Street or simply installing a new stoplight . &quot; No matter what the solution . . . there ' s always a reason why it won ' t work , &quot; said real_estate_broker David Gladstone , president of Concerned Citizens of Ventura , which is pushing Measure E . * Ventura High parents contend , meanwhile , that the initiative ' s backers are running a deceptive campaign . The Measure E supporters are using the school colors -- black and gold -- in what opponents consider a deliberate attempt to mislead voters . Besides driving a pickup_truck fitted with a huge black-and-gold placard proclaiming &quot; Open Poli -- Yes on E , &quot; members of Concerned Citizens of Ventura are also distributing flyers in the same colors . &quot; They are trying to have people think that if they vote what the yellow and black says it ' s for Ventura High_School , &quot; said Valerie Chrisman , whose son attends the school . &quot; I think they thought it was a good political technique to use the school colors and confuse the issue. &quot; But Gladstone responds , &quot; that ' s nonsense. &quot; His group picked the school colors , he said , because the issue is , after all , about Ventura High . Also , the group failed to put its name or address on the first batch of flyers , running_afoul of the state elections code . For parents and school officials , the issue is clear-cut : They have tried to close Poli Street for 30 years and now they want to keep it that way . * At first , the main problems were traffic safety and noise , school officials said . In the eight classrooms facing Poli Street , the rumble from passing cars is so loud that teachers have kept their doors and windows closed even in sweltering heat , officials said . But in recent years the concerns have grown more serious . In 1990 , the Western Assn . of Schools and Colleges , which decides on schools ' accreditation , recommended during its regular review of Ventura High that the school should seal_off Poli Street , officials said . Traffic on the street had increased over the years to about 10 # 000 cars per day , 4 # 000 of them during school hours . And as gang activity in the city has shot_up , so has the number of gang-related incidents along Poli Street . School officials said the street is a favorite thoroughfare for youths who want to flash gang signs or pick fights with Ventura High students . During one particularly violent nine-day period a_few years ago , officials said , intruders who had parked on Poli Street assaulted 12 students in addition to three staff_members trying to break_up the fights . * Teacher Bob Dixon recalls one Monday morning two years ago when he and his first-period physics class watched in horror as a group of boys ran onto the campus from Poli Street after spotting another youth they had apparently been trying to find . By the time Dixon ran_out to break_up the scuffle , the youths were beating the student with a tire_iron , he said . Although the Ventura Unified School District had been asking the city for years to close Poli Street , the council only agreed after the stabbing death of a Ventura High student in January , 1993 . Jesse Strobel was stabbed and killed on a Friday evening several blocks from the school . No one was ever charged in the attack . But school officials said they believe the killing stemmed from tensions between Jesse ' s friends and another group of students at the school . Since the closing , officials said , violence is less prevalent and the atmosphere at the school is markedly different . &quot; People are a little more relaxed , &quot; math_teacher Lloyd Vadnais said . &quot; You don ' t have the constant fear that something ' s going_to happen. &quot; But Measure E proponents argue that school officials have exaggerated the dangers posed by Poli Street . &quot; No one has ever been killed , &quot; Imbrecht said . And , the initiative ' s backers say , the school district and City_Council have minimized the problems caused by closing the street . * Main_Street , for instance , has become a traffic nightmare because of motorists detoured from using Poli Street . City Engineer Rick Raives confirmed that Main_Street now carries thousands more cars daily than before the street closure . &quot; It ' s certainly a lot busier , &quot; he said . And the intersection of Seaward and Main_streets is particularly congested , he said , with motorists sometimes having to sit through two or more lights during the busy noon hour . Hillside residents also complain that the road closures are dangerous : Fire_engines and other emergency vehicles , they said , will have trouble reaching hillside residences in the event of a big brush_fire . &quot; You could have a terrible loss of life and everything else all because of those darn barricades , &quot; Measure E proponent Jack C . Biller said . But this fear is contradicted by Ventura Fire_Chief Richard Achee . &quot; Our response_time isn ' t slowed , &quot; he said . As an alternative to closing Poli Street , Biller and other backers of the initiative have suggested that the city and school district put a stoplight at the crosswalk on Poli , fence the campus in or take other measures to protect students . School officials , however , say neither a stoplight nor a fence would ease the disturbances caused by having a street cut_through the middle of campus . And district officials said they lack the hundreds of thousands of dollars it would cost to build an overpass . * The district maintains , however , that it is continuing to search for a permanent solution to the Poli Street dilemma . Parents and officials said they just want voters to keep the street closed until they find another answer . At least some voters are having trouble making_up their mind . Mellie Morgan and her husband Paul live_on the hillside above Ventura High , but on the other side of Catalina Street . The 80-year-old Morgan , whose son is an assistant principal in the school district , said she sympathizes_with Measure E proponents . &quot; It ' s a real darn inconvenience for them , &quot; she said . &quot; But , on the other hand , Mr. Morgan and I are both ambivalent about this because the kids have to cross . &quot; It ' s just a real lousy situation overall. &quot;</TEXT>
