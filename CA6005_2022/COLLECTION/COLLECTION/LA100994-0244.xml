   <HEADLINE> TASTE OF TRAVEL : CALIFORNIA : LIFE IN THE FEAST LANE ; PIGGING_OUT ALONG HIGHWAY 99 MEANS SLICING THROUGH THE STATE ' S MANY CULTURES AND CUISINES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When I plan a trip_up north to Sacramento or the Bay Area , I try to allow an extra day for travel . That way I can abandon the gray infinity of Interstate 5 in favor of the more leisurely drive_up my favorite highway : California 99 . But my real reason for choosing 99 over I-5 is connected with my interest in food , for the historic road links a string of ethnic_groups , each steeped in the flavors of its country_of_origin . With a little advance preparation and a_few extra hours , the trip along the four-lane highway turns_into a wonderful eating experience . By the time my husband and I reached our final destination in Lodi , our gastronomic adventure included an authentic Basque lunch , a Swedish smorgasbord , a superb grilled lamb kebab sandwich , a towering ice_cream sundae , spicy Portuguese-style linguica sausage and a taste of fragrant olive_oils topped_off with French country-style sausages and pates . Thus it was that on a hazy morning last January we left the interstate behind and headed_off on California 99 north toward Bakersfield . To the right and left of us , fields of cotton extended as far as the eye could see , interrupted here and there by emerald fields of alfalfa . Dozens of oil_pumps bobbed_up and down hypnotically , permanent reminders of Bakersfield ' s economic origins in the discovery of oil . On several occasions , however , strategically placed signs facing the freeway announced : &quot; Farm plus water equals jobs &quot; or , &quot; 1 in 10 jobs in the state are derived from agriculture &quot; -- facts urban dwellers tend to forget . In addition to petroleum and agriculture , the Bakersfield area is also a leader in California ' s sheep industry . This is thanks to the first Basque sheepherders who saw in the rolling hills stretching toward the snow-covered Sierras a New World version of their native Pyrenees . To this day , Basques of French and Spanish extraction make_up a thriving community that perpetuates its culinary traditions by operating several family-run restaurants . Led by the recommendation of a local expert , we made our way to the somewhat seedy industrial area of town for an authentic Basque lunch at the Wool Growers Restaurant . The small neon sign bearing a sheep hanging over the front_door was the only way to distinguish the restaurant from its drab surroundings . Inside , however , an entirely different scene unfolded . When we arrived_at about 11:30 a.m. , hardly_a space was left in the restaurant ' s front section . We were invited to sit facing each other on either side of narrow tables set end-to-end across the room . From our central vantage_point , we could take_in the crowded booths and the quaint flowered wallpaper , as well as the front_door that opened and closed incessantly on groups of patrons , many of whom greeted the staff by name . By noon , it was standing_room only at the Wool Grower ' s impressive bar , and the huge banquet hall at the back was quickly filling_up . Our waitress , Jovita , immediately presented us with a basket of freshly baked bread and a steaming bowl of soup , all served family-style . When we asked if it was homemade , she assured us , in the softest of Castillan accents , that everything served was made in the restaurant . One spoonful of the hearty vegetable_soup was enough to win us over . She then placed before us a bowl of Basque-style beans with a side of picante fresh salsa . By the time the main_course arrived we had turned_into fans of Basque cuisine . While I savored two succulent , inch-thick lamb chops ( $ 9 ) slathered in fresh garlic and some of the tastiest French fries this side of the Atlantic , my husband relished every bite of his red wine-flavored oxtail stew ( $ 6.50 ) . A bowl of crisp iceberg_lettuce tossed_in vinaigrette rounded_off the meal . What better way to follow a Basque luncheon than with a visit to a Basque bakery ? That was our plan as we dropped_by the Pyrenees French Bakery -- open 50 years and still going strong . The small storefront , fragrant with the scent of baking bread , represents merely a fraction of the extensive on-site operation that supplies most area grocers and restaurants with plump loaves of French sourdough ( $ 1.89 ) . Munching on the crusty heel of a warm baguette , we looked in on the Noriega Hotel , a local landmark since 1893 . The long , dark bar at the front of the family-run restaurant seemed lifted straight out of Basque country , complete with small groups of Spanish-speaking men in black berets whiling away the time drinking picon , a local punch made of brandy , grenadine and a_few secret ingredients . The hotel also boasts its own private jai_alai court . In the early afternoon , the tables in its refectory-like dining_room were being covered with red and white checkered tablecloths in preparation for the evening meal . At Noriega ' s , meals are served family-style at a single seating at noon ( $ 8 ) and again at 7 p.m. ( $ 15 ) . Since on this occasion our schedule precluded another Basque feast , we hit the road in search of dessert . Our destination was Superior Dairy_Products in Hanford , a little more_than an hour to the north . San Joaquin ' s South Valley has long been known as California ' s dairy land and has overtaken Wisconsin as the nation ' s leader in the number of dairy_cattle . Superior Dairy_Products has been making bountiful use of local milk and cream products since 1929 . Located across from Hanford ' s lovely renovated Courthouse Square , the landmark ice_cream parlor / diner is still the gathering spot of choice for local ice_cream lovers . On the afternoon we dropped_by , a handful of retirees seated at the counter were chatting over mugs of steaming coffee , while the pink plastic booths provided a nostalgic haven for those savoring the dairy ' s creamy delights . We opted for a scoop of pecan crisp ( $ 1.60 ) and the S.O.S. ( Superior Oversize Sundae , $ 6.80 ) -- a mini-Mt . Everest fashioned from seven scoops of vanilla_ice_cream and sherbet , covered in an avalanche of fruit , nuts and whipped cream . In addition to dairy_farmers -- many of them Dutch -- Hanford once also sheltered our country ' s largest settlement of Chinese immigrants , who were brought_in from San Francisco to work_on railroads around the state . The renovated , half-block-long China Alley ( a former Chinese neighborhood ) remains a historic legacy to those people , as does the 19th-Century Taoist temple , which is_on the National Register of Historic Places . Occupying most of what is left of China Alley , the famous Imperial Dynasty is an elegant restaurant that is celebrated for its fine continental cuisine . From Hanford , we needed only to drive a little farther up 99 to sample the flavors of Sweden . Swedish immigrants from Michigan settled in the quaint town of Kingsburg in the early 1880s after the railroad came_through , and the town commemorates the event with a Swedish Festival each May . ( The town also celebrates its heritage with the Santa Lucia Day , this year Dec . 10. ) Draper Street , the town ' s main artery , is lined with quaint renovated shops , including Juen Olsson Hess ' Svensk Butik . The Olsson family is counted among the city ' s pioneers , and Hess presides in full Swedish regalia over a store filled floor to ceiling with Swedish souvenirs and foods . During the annual May festival , Hess and compatriots serve_up steaming bowls of traditional yellow_pea soup and Swedish pancakes , and host a smorgasbord ( a traditional Swedish buffet ) in the park next to the town ' s Coffee Pot water_tower . When they are not personally introducing visitors to the intricacies of Swedish cuisine , the residents of Kingsburg patronize the Swedish Mill Restaurant and Gift_Shop ( look_for the windmill at the Conejo off-ramp ) . Every day at lunch and dinner the restaurant unfolds a smorgasbord with salads , roasted meats and special dishes , such_as meatloaf baked in a golden pie_crust , and thin pancakes smothered in whipped cream and berries ( lunch $ 6.95 and dinner $ 8.85 per person ) . On the outskirts of Kingsburg , acres of vines surrounding the town are visual proof of the importance of the grape to the local economy . One place to sample the dried end_product is at the Sun-Maid Growers Store . The cheery establishment stands among warehouses and hangars that make_up the Sun-Maid compound . This is one of the best places along 99 to purchase raisins , prunes , almonds and walnuts in bulk or pre-packaged . Whenever I drop_in , I like to sample chocolate-covered raisins or newly developed ( and delicious ) lemon- or orange-flavored prunes , while pondering the purchase of an apron , a license_plate or a thermometer , all bearing the familiar Sun-Maid logo of the young_girl in her bonnet . Twenty minutes up the road , the town of Fresno is home to a large population of Armenians . Like their Basque neighbors to the south , they are especially conscious of their culinary heritage and offer it for all to sample in a number of eating places . At George ' s Shish Kebob Restaurant in the Galleria Shopping_Center , behind the Fresno Convention Center , Armenian , American and Middle Eastern foods are daily features on the menu . At lunchtime this busy Armenian bistro is packed with county workers and businessmen sinking their teeth into enormous sandwiches bulging with grilled meat or roast chicken . Owner George Koroyan often mans the stove , and those who sit at the counter facing the open kitchen can engage him in conversation . On my most recent visit , I feasted on what was possibly one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten : meltingly tender chunks of marinated and grilled lamb stuffed inside a freshly baked pita as airy as a cloud ( $ 6.50 ) . Enough was left of the sandwich , the accompanying rice pilaf and the green_salad to make lunch the next day . My husband , similarly , made two meals out of another of George ' s specialties , an oversized lamb shank , cooked to such moist tenderness that it made use of a knife quite unnecessary ( $ 7.75. ) Along with ethnic foods , stone_fruits and nuts are part of Fresno County ' s bounty . If I happen to travel up 99 in early spring , I like to follow the &quot; Fresno Blossom Trail &quot; map through the flowering almond_trees on the outskirts of Fresno . ( The map is distributed by the Fresno Visitors ' Bureau. ) That way I can view at close range acres of orchards awash in a sea of fluttering pink and white petals . In season , there is also ripe fruit -- peaches , plums , apples -- available in abundance at any number of fruit stands , or at stores such_as the pretty Valley Pistachio , a stone ' s throw_off 99 in Madera . It carries many of the locally grown nuts , as well as jellies and preserves . A sign for one of those country farm stands recently lured us off the freeway in Merced , right into the parking_lot of the Merced County Agricultural Museum , a_few miles east of Highway 99 on California 140 . The small museum , a reconverted warehouse , is the brainchild of private collector Charlie Parish who has gathered an eclectic collection of old farm machinery and hog oilers , among many other items . Continuing northward , it would be easy to blink past the hamlet of Livingston were it not for the stop light that halts traffic at the corner of Highway 99 and Livingston Cressey Road . The busy corner holds the Yamato Colony Farmers ' Market , a stand renowned throughout the valley for its local produce , and behind it , the Foster Farms Livingston Cafe , which is owned by Foster Farms , one of the state ' s largest poultry producers . If I feel_like a snack in Livingston , I stop at the cafe to purchase a box of tasty chicken nuggets , ( 5 for $ 2.19 , 10 for $ 3.89 ) to dunk in the restaurant ' s honey mustard or barbecue_sauce . When time permits , in Turlock I stop by Latif ' s , the town ' s landmark coffee_shop , for a linguica sausage sandwich and a mound of golden fries ( $ 4.95 ) . A large population of Portuguese immigrants from the Azores have long had a presence in Turlock , leaving their culinary imprint on the local scene . Latif ' s has been part of the Turlock landscape since 1947 , although it has been under the ownership of Shirley and Robert Stevens for the past 20 years . The restaurant enjoys such repute that George_Bush made a campaign stop here in 1988 -- a fact commemorated on the back of a stool at the horseshoe-shaped counter . Turlock melts into the suburbs of Modesto , its immediate neighbor to the north . To this area the Italians brought with them a tradition for making fine wines and olive_oil . For me , the locally produced product from Sciabica Olive_Oil holds special appeal . Sciabica ' s oil has been produced in Modesto since 1936 . The Sciabicas grow their own olives organically in their orchard near Sacramento and their Marsala Olive Fruit oil has won a number of culinary awards . Five miles north of downtown Modesto , a newly expanded warehouse and gift store are open_to the public during business hours . In Oakdale , a_few miles outside town , fall apple season provides ample excuse to drop_by the Bloomingcamp Ranch nestled among rolling acres of apple_trees . Joy Bloomingcamp and her husband , Bill , grow more_than two_dozen varieties and sell them from their apple-filled gift_shop . Their in-store bakery specializes in huge apple_dumplings , and what may well be the tallest apple_pies in the state . A French-owned operation , the Country Sausage Kitchen in Lodi is a mandatory stop on my Highway 99 gourmet itinerary . The small manufacturing_plant is the domain of sausage-maker Gus Foucher and his family who emigrated from France to Canada before settling in Lodi . Gus , his wife , Berthe , and several of their eight children all help in the running of the company . The Fouchers produce a line of sausages , pates and other exquisite deli items such_as linguica , a delicious and lean chicken apple sausage , tasty Cajun andouille and a personal favorite , curly links of merguez , a cumin-scented sausage from North Africa . The Country Sausage Kitchen and all its counterparts along the road epitomize the unique food purveyors scattered along Highway 99 -- all artisans who to me represent the true &quot; soul food &quot; of California .
