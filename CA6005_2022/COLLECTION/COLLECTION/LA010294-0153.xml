   <HEADLINE> IN DEFENSE OF : ; GETTING DRUNK ; A SPIRITED IMBIBER SPEAKS_UP FOR THE PLEASURE OF ALCOHOL , WHICH HE ARGUES IS TOO OFTEN THE SCAPEGOAT FOR SOCIETAL ILLS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I ' m drunk . My cheeks are flushed . My heart is beating fast . I ' m not sure what time it is . As I look_around the room , I find myself transfixed by insignificancies -- a beam_of_light etching a tiny rainbow onto one side of an Evian bottle protruding from an ice bucket ; a thin , translucent rim of molten wax ringing the flame of the milk-white taper on my table ; a scribble of blue thread on the back of a waiter ' s short black jacket . I also find myself , improbably , enjoying the syrupy pianist in the corner as he oozes_through his maudlin repertoire . I feel wonderful . I ' m sitting alone in the dining_room of the Hotel Beau Rivage Palace in Lausanne , Switzerland , and have just finished a simple but delicious dinner . I began my evening with a flute of champagne in the hotel bar . With my meal , I consumed a bottle of good Swiss pinot_blanc . Now , with a demitasse of strong , creamy coffee , I ' m starting on my second tiny glass of the aged dry white cherry brandy called vieux kirsch . Do I disgust you ? Do you disapprove ? And if so , why ? I ' m not behaving oddly or inappropriately to my surroundings . I ' m not singing loudly to myself or knocking things over . I may well lurch a little when I get_up to leave ; I ' ll probably snore like a foghorn tonight . But I ' m not going_to drive anywhere . I ' m not going_to abuse anyone on the way to my room . So what if I ' m drunk ? Maybe I ' ll die before you do . Maybe I won ' t . Maybe you ' re a better person than I am . I hope you are , in fact . Good_night . * I WROTE THOSE WORDS , OR AT LEAST SCRAWLED the notes on which they are closely based , not quite two years ago , on the third evening of a 17-day business trip to Europe -- a trip that was to include many_more good meals and many_more ascents , as I like to think_of them , to a state of pleasant inebriation . I was scrawling in the first place , instead of just sitting there sipping cherry hooch and listening to &quot; La Vie en Rose , &quot; because I had lately started thinking seriously about alcohol and ( for a start ) my own relation_to it . Since that time , I ' ve scrawled and thought a good_deal more , drunk and sober both , not just about why I drink , but about why other people do or don ' t , and about why alcohol is increasingly condemned these days , by the earnest and the honest as well as by the fatuous and the self-deluding , as evil straight up . I ' ve come_to several conclusions : I think , first of all , that a lot of people who drink , and genuinely enjoy drinking , sometimes drink too_much ( because they genuinely enjoy drinking ) , but that when they do , it ' s usually no big thing . They usually don ' t cause anybody any problems , and they probably do no more_than minor damage to themselves . ( A hangover is not a pretty beast , but it is a short-lived one ; and , up_to a point at least , the liver has astonishing self-regenerative abilities. ) I think that if alcohol is indeed , as we are often told , &quot; America ' s number-one drug problem , &quot; it is also probably America ' s number-one scapegoat for societal ills -- ills whose real causes don ' t come conveniently packaged in bottle form . And I think that , insofar as it is possible to measure such things , alcohol probably brings as much pleasure to the world as it brings pain . Plenty of people speak out against the pain . I think somebody ought to speak_up for the pleasure . I LIKE TO DRINK . THIS IS NO SECRET TO ANYONE who knows me . Let ' s define some terms here , though : I don ' t live_in a constant state of intoxication . I don ' t -- I can ' t -- work drunk . I don ' t get drunk every night . I don ' t get drunk on purpose . I mean , I know that alcohol will inebriate me if I consume a certain quantity of it and , in fact , appreciate that quality in it -- but I don ' t sit_down at the table , open a bottle of vodka and say , &quot; Boy , am I gonna get blotto tonight ! &quot; And when I talk_about getting drunk , incidentally , I don ' t mean falling-down / throwing-up / screaming-and-flailing-or-sniffling-and-sobbing / out-of-control drunk . I mean drinking to_the_point that the chemical_equilibrium of my body begins to be altered in various noticeable ways -- my capillaries dilated , my muscles relaxed , my neurons disordered -- with pleasurable effect . Drinking is not an obsession with me . It is far from the defining activity of my life . I don ' t wake_up in the morning imagining what alcoholic_beverages I will consume that day . Drinking is simply a thing I do , a part of the mix . I drink wine -- a bottle , more or less -- with dinner three or four times a week . ( I should mention that I ' m 6-foot-1 and weigh something over 250 pounds , so I might be said to have a somewhat larger capacity than usual. ) The nights I don ' t drink wine , I might have a small scotch when I come_home or a brandy before I go_to_bed , or I might have nothing at all . I almost never drink at lunchtime , unless I ' m off somewhere where lunchtime drinking is the norm . Occasionally , day or night , if I ' m in the mood and the circumstances permit , I exceed these limits . I don ' t drive drunk , but I ' d be a liar if I said that I ' ve never driven drunk -- and so would many of you . Sometimes when we drink more_than we ' ve intended to , judgment and coordination take_advantage of the situation and sneak_off hand-in-hand in the middle of the party , so discreetly that we don ' t even notice that they ' re gone . One of the drinker ' s most important responsibilities is to keep_an_eye_on them , even through the haze , and to shut the bash down ( and give_up the car keys ) if they disappear . ( And one of the drinker ' s most important assets is a friend to help mount the vigil. ) I ' m well aware of the physical dangers of alcohol -- the way it can wrack the body , scramble the brain . I ' m also aware of its beneficial effects ( wine ' s apparent value to the cardiovascular_system , for instance ) . But I neither drink nor moderate my drinking for medical reasons . I do moderate it -- I drink less now than I did 20 or even 10 years ago , and will probably drink less in 1995 than I do_in 1994 -- but only out of common_sense . My body is less resilient than it used to be , and since I drink for pleasure , I try to avoid drinking to_the_point of displeasure . Why do I drink , then ? I drink because I like the way alcohol smells and tastes , especially in the forms in which I most often encounter it , which are wine , scotch , various brandies , an occasional beer , an occasional silly cocktail . I drink because I like the trappings of imbibing , the company it keeps -- the restaurants and cafes and bars and ( usually ) the people who gather_in them . And , I drink , frankly , because I like the way alcohol makes me feel . I like the glow , the softening of hard edges , the faint anesthesia . I like the way my mind races , one zigzag step ahead of logic . I like the flash_flood of unexpected utter joy that sometimes courses quickly through me between this glass and that one . I like the feeling of being almost , but not quite , in control . ALCOHOL IS ANCIENT -- AS OLD AS FRUIT AND grain . Fermentation , the process by which alcohol is produced , occurs spontaneously in nature . It is ignited by airborne yeasts , settling by chance onto grapes or other sugar-laden fruits , vegetables , grains and such ( the catalogue of willing agents is immense ) . The yeast secretes an enzyme called zymase , which acts_upon certain of the sugars -- principally dextrose and levulose -- to form carbon_dioxide and a carbohydrate called ethanol or ethyl_alcohol ( C2H5OH ) , which is the kind of alcohol we drink . If alcohol is ancient , it is also ubiquitous . I don ' t mean just that most cultures , in most parts of the world , have discovered and enjoyed alcohol for themselves , but also that it is present in every one of us , whether we drink or not . In 1973 , the Nobel Prize-winning British biochemist Sir Hans A . Krebs discovered that dietary sugars are fermented daily in the human intestine , producing alcohol in an amount said to approximate that contained in a quart of 3.2 % beer . This alcohol doesn ' t have the effects of a quart of beer , at least in normally functioning human_bodies , because it is broken_down almost immediately , before it reaches the bloodstream . Still , this would seem to be further proof that alcohol is a natural substance , and that the body has the means for dealing with it , at least in modest quantity . This is accomplished initially through an enzyme known as alcohol dehydrogenase , whose function is to catalyze the first_step in ridding the body of alcohol -- and which , as Mark Keller of the Rutgers University Center of Alcohol Studies writes in his book &quot; Alcohol and Alcohol Problems , &quot; &quot; doesn ' t seem to have very much else to do. &quot; It was Louis Pasteur who discovered the nature of fermentation , in 1857 . Many thousands of years before that , though , human_beings began to take_note of both the process and its effects . According to one story , Noah drank fermented grape_juice after watching goats grow tipsy from the grapes , and liked the stuff so_much that he subsequently became the world ' s first drunkard ( and planted the world ' s first vineyard ) . Another tale credits a concubine in the court of the ( probably mythical ) King Jamshid of Persia , who sought oblivion by quaffing a noxious , foaming liquid she found at the bottom of a bowl of rotting grapes in the palace cellar -- and became the life of the party instead . Distillation , the process by which whiskey , vodka , rum and other such liquors are made , is another story . Unlike fermentation , it is not a naturally occurring process , but rather a technique apparently developed by Arab alchemists in the 10th Century , originally to make perfumes and medicines . It is based on the fact that alcohol evaporates faster than water ; by boiling wine , then , its alcohol can be drawn_off and collected . The spirit , as it were , is extracted from the vinum corpus . However fermentation was discovered , there is archeological evidence to suggest that , as long ago as 6 # 000 BC , the process had come under some measure of human control . The anthropologists Solomon H . Katz and Mary M . Voigt push the date_back even earlier , to about 8 # 000 BC . They also posit that the earliest fermented beverage , apparently a kind of beer , might have been considered so desirable by its consumers that they were willing to change their very mode of living to ensure its regular supply -- actually planting grains that had hitherto been gathered_in the wild . Out of cyclical , non-migratory agriculture grew the first permanent human settlements -- and the next thing anybody knew , you had rush-hour gridlock at Wilshire and Westwood . The desire to get drunk , in other words , might lie at the very roots of human civilization . MY NAME IS COLMAN , AND I ' M AN ALCOHOLIC . IT says so right here , at the bottom of this questionnaire from Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore . The form poses 20 yes-or-no questions . &quot; If you have answered YES to three or more , &quot; it reads in conclusion , &quot; you are definitely an alcoholic. &quot; They got me on four of them : ( 3. ) Do you drink because you are shy with other people ? Yes , sometimes , when I ' m feeling out of my element . It works great ; after a glass or two of something , I loosen_up , start a conversation and join the party . ( 10. ) Do you crave a drink at a definite time daily ? Yep . Dinnertime . ( 16. ) Do you drink alone ? All the time , especially when I travel . I like drinking_in company , but good wine tastes just as good at the solitary table . ( 17. ) Have you ever had a complete loss of memory as a result of drinking ? Yes , once . I was young ( in my early twenties ) , tired ( I was near the end of an arduous second-class train journey from Bucharest to Paris ) and unwise . Stopping between trains in Dijon , I stashed my luggage in a locker and went_off to the Foire Gastronomique , an immense food and wine exhibition , at which I attempted to taste about two_dozen varieties of calvados -- strictly for academic purposes , of course -- after already having had a bit too_much wine to drink . I vaguely remember leaving the exhibition_hall . The next thing I knew , my train was pulling into the Gare de Lyon some four or five hours later . Miraculously , I had all my luggage with me . This is not the place to question the validity of facile questionnaires , to discuss the philosophies and methods of Alcoholics Anonymous and other such groups ( which frequently use such questionnaires as screening devices ) or to lampoon the you ' re-either-in-denial-or-in-recovery school of pop psychology . But I think it might be worth noting , since it is not commonly understood by the general public , that there is no single , universally accepted medical or legal definition of &quot; alcoholism &quot; -- and that by no means every expert on the subject accepts the fact that alcoholism is a disease at all . In his controversial but extensively documented 1988 book &quot; Heavy Drinking ; The Myth of Alcoholism as a Disease , &quot; Herbert Fingarette , a former World_Health_Organization alcoholism and addiction consultant , goes so far as_to say that &quot; No leading research authorities accept the classic disease concept ( of alcoholism ) . &quot; Alcoholism is perhaps like obscenity in this respect : Almost everybody admits that it exists and most folks claim to know it when they see it . But when you try to get specific and say , This Is , This Isn ' t , it becomes a powerful elusive thing . Is an alcoholic , for instance , simply someone who ingests a certain predetermined quantity of alcohol ? ( The Greek Stoic philosopher Epictetus thought so 2 # 000 years ago . &quot; He is a drunkard , &quot; he proposed , &quot; who takes more_than three glasses , though he be not drunk. &quot; ) Or should we define alcoholism in terms of physical symptoms ( blackouts or the DTs , say ) or of tragic social consequences ( auto accidents , domestic violence , whatever ) ? My father was an alcoholic by nearly anybody ' s definition . For most of his life , he drank like a son-of-a-bitch . As a young dandy of a newspaper_editor in Chicago , just before Prohibition , he was famous for going_to_bed at 4 a.m. &quot; drunk as a skunk , &quot; then getting_to the office in the morning before anybody else and knocking_out stories while his colleagues were still squinting at the coffee . Later , as a Hollywood writer , he hung_out at Lucey ' s and other movie-business watering_holes , where water was rarely consumed , and downed martinis or ( his trademark drink ) Old Rarity and Perrier . My personal recollections of his drinking are somewhat less romantic . I recall , for example , that he used to hide bottles of whiskey in his suitcase when he went_on business trips -- and that when we went_out to dinner as a family , he would sometimes excuse himself for a trip to the men ' s room , then stop on the way back to bribe a waiter to surreptitiously bring him a water_glass filled with vodka . If he was an alcoholic , though , he was also a scrupulously moral man , a stranger to violence whether drunk or sober and an almost unbelievably hard_worker -- a writer who sat at his typewriter for unbroken four- and five-hour stints , not even getting_up to go_to the bathroom or the coffee-maker , or to stretch his legs . At the age of about 60 , on doctor ' s orders , he quit drinking . He did_it cold turkey , subsequently refusing even a celebratory glass of champagne when I graduated from high_school . After my mother died , I encouraged him to drink a bit again . This he did with great pleasure . &quot; I ' d forgotten how good that tasted , &quot; he said when he tried his first martini in a dozen years . When he died himself a year later -- from the effects not of his drinking but of his lifelong three-pack-a-day cigarette habit -- I found nothing to suggest that he had started drinking seriously again . There was not a single bottle stashed in his apartment , not even beer in the refrigerator . If my father was an alcoholic , then , I ' m tempted to say that he was not a typical one . But does a &quot; typical &quot; one exist ? Isn ' t it sometimes a question of social norms , or of context ? Is the Frenchman who consumes maybe a bottle or a bottle and a half of wine a day , every day of his life ( except when he ' s taking his annual government-subsidized , two-week &quot; water cure &quot; at some sulfurous-smelling spa in the mountains ) an alcoholic ? What about the Greek or Italian who cannot imagine sitting_down to lunch or dinner without at least a glass of wine or beer ? On the other hand , what about the kid who guzzles too_much Coors at a high_school beer bust and pukes all_the way home ( and who will probably repeat the process for a while until he grows out of it ) ? What about your aunt , who hadn ' t had a drink since George_Bush was elected but who sipped a bit too_much spiked eggnog a_couple_of nights ago and knocked_over a stop sign driving_back to Mission Viejo ? And if she ' s not an alcoholic , which I would argue she certainly isn ' t , then how dare our courts require , as they might well do , that she attend AA meetings as a portion of her sentence ? And , er , what about me ? Context , in fact , is the whole point . You know all about context if you ' ve ever gone sober to a party where the drinking is heavy . Everyone seems so , well , glassy-eyed and red-faced , so loud and unfunny . It is not a pretty picture . But that ' s just you . You ' re out_of_place -- just as you ' d be out_of_place if you walked , glassy-eyed and red-faced , into a room full of the stone-cold sober . Wine-tasting party , wedding_reception , Friday night at the tavern , table at Patina , bearskin rug by a ski lodge fire -- those are drinking places , or can be if you want them to be . Freeway , office , library , schoolhouse -- those are not , not even if you want them to be . But the notion that there is a proper context for drinking , and for getting drunk , is rapidly disappearing in America . Institutionalized carousing is a facet of many cultures : Just as certain days are often set_aside for abstinence , so certain days are set_aside for popping corks and tapping kegs . We ' ve just had such a day ourselves , and have another one coming_up , on March 17 . But , we are now told , it ' s not OK to get drunk on those days , or on any others . Drinking is bad , period . The consumption of alcohol is increasingly unacceptable anywhere , anytime , under any circumstances . The three-martini lunch is an artifact today , as rare as the eight-track tape . In certain industries once famous for being practically fueled by ethanol -- the movie business , journalism , advertising -- drinking has become so suspect that a beer after work practically ruins reputations . In trendy restaurants , pregnant women are refused drinks by self-righteous waiters ( never mind that some obstetricians permit their expectant patients an occasional glass or two of wine -- or that waiters probably ought to wield no particular moral authority in this regard ) . Schoolchildren come_home with their &quot; Just Say No &quot; brochures and beg their parents not to drink wine with dinner because alcohol is a drug . The line between use and abuse is blurred . If you look_up &quot; Intoxication &quot; in the on-line catalogue at the Santa Monica Public_Library , you will be asked to &quot; See Alcoholism &quot; -- as if they are one_and_the_same . It ' s about time alcohol fell_into disrepute , say anti-alcohol activists . According to some estimates , in this country it is involved in more_than half of all fatal traffic accidents , more_than half of all homicides , more_than half of all arrests of any kind -- and has a &quot; negative economic impact &quot; of more_than $ 100 billion a year . It leads to suicide , broken homes , addiction to other drugs , woes of almost every kind . It is possible , to some extent , to defend alcohol from these charges . Who says , for instance , that the tragic character flaws blamed on drinking are always caused by drinking , rather than the other way around ? How many people on Skid_Row drank themselves there , and how many drink because they are there ? And why , for that matter , do we lavish opprobrium on those people irresponsible enough to drive drunk and not on those who drive while under the influence of prescription tranquilizers or antihistamines ( which can cause dangerous drowsiness ) , or the ones who nod_off behind the wheel from sheer fatigue or sleep_disorder , or the ones temporarily short-circuited by anger or deep sorrow ? There ' s a more basic response to the litany of accusations leveled against alcohol today , though : Alcohol is innocent . It has no soul . It has no intentions . It is a morally neutral substance , a mere arrangement of molecules , no more inherently good or bad than water ( which both nourishes and drowns ) or sunlight ( progenitor of both chlorophyll and melanoma ) . Alcohol does not &quot; cause &quot; automobile accidents or child_neglect or rape or murder . We do , by misusing it . Alcohol doesn ' t even cause alcoholism . ( If it did , observed the National Institute on Alcohol_Abuse and Alcoholism in 1977 , &quot; everyone who drinks would become an alcohol abuser. &quot; ) If drinking , and getting drunk , should be done_in context , they should also be done with a sense of ( and I hope this doesn ' t seem too weak a word ) manners . There are , and have always been , codes of drinking . These vary according to geography and era , but they are always in place . &quot; Make not thyself helpless in drinking in the beer shop , &quot; reads an Egyptian papyrus from about 1500 BC , &quot; for . . . falling_down thy limbs will be broken , and no one will give thee a hand. &quot; It is the responsibility of the drinker to know how , as well as when , to drink . There are people who can ' t Drink . Something -- personality , hereditary chemistry , whatever -- robs them of control and of good_sense when they ingest alcohol . Their etiquette is simply phrased , if not easily observed : Don ' t drink . There are others who can drink , and who choose to do so . Their etiquette is , or ought to be : Know yourself , and know alcohol in yourself . I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS , ONE 9 MONTHS AND the other almost 4 years old , and though I ' ve never actually sat_down and thought deeply about the consequences of the messages I ' m sending them by drinking so frequently in front of them -- by incorporating alcohol into my life , into our family life -- I am certainly very much aware that I am sending them messages . &quot; What are you going_to do , &quot; my wife asked me recently , &quot; if Maddy comes_to you one day when she ' s a teen-ager and says , ' Dad , I ' d like a glass of wine before I do my homework ? ' &quot; I replied that I ' d say no , and that I ' d explain to her that there are some good things in life that you have to wait awhile for -- like coffee in the morning , a driver ' s license and that glass of wine . I realize , though , that that ' s far from enough . I realize that I have to imbue in my daughters a sense of respect for alcohol ' s heady powers and a sense_of_responsibility in its use . I hope , too , that I can inspire in them a deep affection for the concept of conviviality , and for the almost sacramental implications of breaking_bread and sharing wine with someone . But I also hope -- and this is the really tricky part -- that I can teach them this about getting drunk : That drinking , like life , is a matter of balance ; that balance isn ' t always the same as moderation , though it keeps moderation at its core -- and that you can ' t keep your balance if you can ' t see the edge .</TEXT>
