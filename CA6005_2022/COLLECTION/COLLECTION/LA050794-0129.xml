   <HEADLINE> CONSENSUAL SEX WITH GIRL , 13 , RULED RAPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A man who argued that a 13-year-old girl had consented to have_sex with him lost his bid Friday to have his statutory_rape conviction overturned . He and the girl are now married and have a child . The Kentucky Court of Appeals rejected Jason Lee Griffith ' s claim that the state ' s rape law is unconstitutional because it assumes those under age 16 and unmarried cannot consent to sex . It is legal to have_sex with somebody that young if those involved are married . Griffith was 22 and Chastity Lunsford was 13 when she got pregnant in 1992 . Their son was born that December . The couple got_married a month later , with the consent of the girl ' s mother , while Griffith ' s case was pending in Kenton Circuit Court . Griffith pleaded guilty to second-degree rape in March , 1993 , and was sentenced to five years in prison . In his appeal , Griffith claimed that it was unconstitutional to make sex between adults and minors legal if they are married but a criminal act if they are not married . He said that the state ' s &quot; only reason . . . for treating married and unmarried persons differently . . . is that , under Judeo-Christian theology , only persons married to one another are permitted to have sex. &quot; Writing for the court , Judge John Gardner said that the law had a &quot; purely secular purpose &quot; -- to protect minors from sexual exploitation . By requiring a parent ' s consent for marriage , &quot; the state has already taken steps to protect &quot; married minors , Gardner said . Griffith ' s attorney previously vowed to appeal_to the state Supreme Court if they lost at the appeals court level .</TEXT>
