   <HEADLINE> U.S. WEIGHS BOOST IN FORCES IN S . KOREA TO COUNTER ANY INVASION BY THE NORTH ; ASIA : OPTIONS RANGE FROM SENDING MORE SUPPORT TROOPS TO DEPLOYING DOZENS OF ADDITIONAL BOMBERS AND SHIPS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration must decide soon on how rapidly to strengthen U.S. armed forces in South_Korea to deter or , if necessary , repel an invasion by North_Korea . President Clinton and his senior national security advisers are considering a package prepared by Defense_Secretary William J . Perry that outlines options ranging from a modest increase in support troops to deployment of dozens of additional bombers and warships . The pressure for new military moves has been mounting . Although Congress has generally supported Clinton ' s response to North_Korea ' s refusal to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities , some key Democrats and Republicans have begun to complain publicly that Clinton is not doing enough to prepare_for possible war . But officials said any decision would probably be delayed as the Administration tries to untangle the confusion resulting from apparently erroneous statements on U.S. intentions made by former President Jimmy_Carter at the end of his visit to North_Korea . Carter , traveling as a private citizen , told North_Korean President Kim Il Sung that the Clinton_Administration was suspending its drive for U.N. sanctions while it assessed a new compromise proposed Thursday by North_Korea . Clinton , however , had already vowed to keep pressing for economic sanctions in response to North_Korea ' s defiance of international safeguards against nuclear_weapons proliferation . Clinton warned reporters Friday not to &quot; overreact &quot; to Carter ' s statement . &quot; I gave my position yesterday and it hasn ' t changed , &quot; the President told reporters on a trip to Chicago . A senior Administration official acknowledged Friday that the Administration is worried that Carter ' s assertion to Kim could give other countries at the United Nations an excuse to drag their feet in considering the sanctions proposal , easing pressure on North_Korea . &quot; that ' s one reason why we moved . . . so quickly yesterday with a statement to say we are proceeding with consultations on sanctions at the U.N. , &quot; the official said . Key Administration officials said they would hold_up any further action on the North_Korean offer until after today , when Carter leaves the North_Korean capital of Pyongyang and can talk with them on a secure telephone_line to provide more details of his conversations with Kim . Even then , Robert L . Gallucci , the Administration ' s point_man on Korean issues , said no major decisions are likely until early next week , &quot; assuming that we have good conversations , clear conversations with President Carter tomorrow or Sunday. &quot; Pentagon officials said the military package presented to Clinton included these options : * Sending more military support personnel to South_Korea to make_it easier for the services to deploy more combat and logistic troops to reinforce troops now in place , should North_Korea invade the South . * Deploying up_to 40 more warplanes to the region , including F-117 radar-evading Stealth bombers in South_Korea and B-52 long-range bombers on Guam . The Navy would send an extra aircraft_carrier to the area . And the Army and Marines would beef_up their forces . * Making preparations for rapid deployment of substantial numbers of ground troops to the area as reinforcements , if war should break_out . Gen . Gary E . Luck , U.S. commander in South_Korea , has said he would need 400 # 000 more troops , besides the 37 # 000 Americans in position now , if North_Korea were to invade . The Pentagon has also been taking steps to modernize existing forces and bolster supplies of spare_parts and ammunition to facilitate the arrival of reinforcements . Perry and Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , have sent Patriot air-defense missiles to South_Korea , along with artillery-locating radar and dozens of Apache helicopters , intended to replace aging Cobra gunships that U.S. forces had been using . Even so , except for the addition of the Patriots , the bulk of the U.S. effort has been modest and barely visible . And some steps that Perry had said earlier he would take -- such_as bolstering allied ammunition supplies -- have still not been carried_out . Senior Administration officials have argued that they have kept the effort low-key for two reasons : They want to avoid provoking the North_Koreans , who have warned that the mere imposition of sanctions might set_off a war . And they want to mollify South_Korea , which fears that a real mobilization would panic the country and hurt the economy . Despite North_Korea ' s strident rhetoric , U.S. intelligence_officers have reported that they have seen no unusual movements of troops or equipment in North_Korea that might suggest that the country is gearing_up for an invasion . &quot; Everything looks normal , &quot; one official said . But the Administration has been under mounting pressure from conservatives to beef_up U.S. forces in South_Korea , particularly in the face of North_Korea ' s increasing threats of war as the United States began to press for U.N. sanctions . In a sign of congressional unease over the U.S.-North Korean confrontation , the Senate voted , 93 to 3 , Thursday to urge Clinton to bolster U.S. forces in South_Korea to a_level where they could &quot; deter and if necessary repel an attack &quot; from North_Korea . What is propelling the Administration most , however , is timing . U.S. commanders in the field figure that it would take at least several months to prepare allied forces there for reinforcements and ultimately to deploy extra troops and equipment -- and the clock is ticking fast . Administration officials spent much of Friday trying to distance themselves from Carter . &quot; President Carter carried no message from us , no message from the President . . . neither concessions nor threats , &quot; Gallucci , a State_Department official , said . Times staff writers David Lauter in Chicago , Michael Ross and Stanley Meisler in Washington and Sam Jameson in Tokyo contributed to this report .</TEXT>
