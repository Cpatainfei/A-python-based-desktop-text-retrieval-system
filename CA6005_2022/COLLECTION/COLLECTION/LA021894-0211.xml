   <HEADLINE> U.S. TEAM WILL KEEP EYE ON WORLD CUP FOE ; SOCCER : AMERICANS WON ' T PLAY COLOMBIA IN WEEKEND TOURNAMENT , BUT THEY WILL WATCH THE UNPREDICTABLE TEAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. national soccer team will once again get a close look_at one of its World Cup opponents , Colombia , beginning today in the Joe Robbie Cup . And , although Coach Bora Milutinovic objects to use of the word spy for the intense attention his coaches will give the Colombian team , the U.S. staff will need every available tool to analyze one of soccer ' s most explosive and unpredictable teams . The U.S. team will play Bolivia today , after Colombia faces Sweden . The teams switch opponents Sunday . Both Bolivia and Sweden have qualified for the 24-team World Cup , to be held_in the United States June 17-July 17 . Assistant coach Steve Sampson , who speaks fluent Spanish , has been assigned to scout Colombia . After Sunday ' s match against Sweden , the U.S. team will have played against or been in the same tournament with its three World Cup Group_A opponents . The United States tied Switzerland , 1-1 , on Jan . 22 , and lost , 2-1 , to Romania , last week in Hong Kong . Despite the traditional soccer taboo of facing World Cup opponents before the tournament , neither Swiss nor Romanian officials objected to the matches , which had been scheduled well before the teams were drawn into the same group in December . The U.S. team might have played Colombia , too , had the Colombians , considered the strongest unit in Group_A , not asked_for a schedule change . &quot; I don ' t believe_in spy , &quot; Milutinovic said , offering observateur as the more appropriate word . &quot; Anyway , they will look different in the World Cup . There is so_much pressure ( during the World Cup ) . We don ' t know how they will resolve this problem. &quot; Milutinovic gave the same disclaimer when his team played Switzerland , which will play the United States in the first game . Partly because few national teams have all_of their best players at their disposal at this time_of_year , coaches tend to give these games little weight as indicators of how the teams will fare in the World Cup . Additionally , some coaches may be careful not to show more_than the most basic game_plans to opposing coaches . But assistant coach Timo Liekoski believes that games against World Cup opponents reveal much about strategy and style , even if key players are missing . Teams play the way they play , he said , regardless of their roster . &quot; I don ' t think any team we will see prior to the World Cup will play any different strategy in the World Cup , &quot; Liekoski said . &quot; I don ' t think there is time before a World Cup , nor would they want to . I don ' t think Switzerland is going_to look so different from what we saw. &quot; The U.S. team , which is 1-1-3 this year , lost to Romania on Feb . 13 after a controversial penalty kick was awarded to Ilie Dumitrescu . The tie with the_Swiss was hardly instructional , because neither team played well . Colombia , however , is better than either Switzerland or Romania . The team that beat Argentina , 5-0 , in Buenos Aires features strikers Faustino Asprilla and Adolfo Valencia . Neither will play in this tournament , but playmaker and team captain Carlos Valderrama will . &quot; Of course , we will watch , &quot; Milutinovic said . &quot; But the problem is , you watch one practice , beautiful . You watch the next , criminal . I prefer to watch in the game , in the World Cup. &quot;</TEXT>
