   <HEADLINE> MEDIA ; PUBLISHERS REACHING_OUT TO NOUVEAUX READERS ; A SMALL PARIS PAPER PACKED WITH GRAFICS AND SHORT ARTICLES IS A HIT WITH YUPPIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As with so many good ideas in France , this one was born over dinner . Four friends , all collectors of first-edition newspapers , asked each other : What type of newspaper would they most like to read ? Well , they concluded , it would have to be a paper with news . No commentary . No political slant . Only a little advertising . And lots of short articles and colorful graphics . In other words , a newspaper like no other in France . That dream paper , InfoMatin , is_on the streets now , its 24 pages more colorful , its size smaller and its price half that of nearly every_other daily on the crowded news racks . And , in just a matter of days , it has become one of the country ' s better-selling dailies , shaking some of the long-accepted conventions of French newspapering . &quot; We ' re trying to make ourselves very different from other papers , &quot; said Geraldine Sartin , 29 , one of InfoMatin ' s 30 reporters . &quot; We give the news , explain what it means and that ' s it . No commentary . &quot; Shorter sentences , shorter_stories , but not shorter ideas , &quot; she added . &quot; What ' s wrong with that ? &quot; Nothing at all , apparently . The paper , whose name means Morning News , debuted on Jan . 10 , with national sales of 345 # 000 and the biggest circulation of any daily in Paris . Since then , sales have leveled_off at about 195 # 000 -- nearly twice what it needs , the paper ' s officials say , to make a profit . * French newspapers have long been famous -- some say notorious -- for serving their news salted heavily with opinion , a repast that French readers have come_to accept . The leading national morning paper , Le Figaro , with daily sales of 380 # 000 , has an unabashed fondness for the conservative prime_minister . Balancing Le Figaro on the newsstands is the left-leaning tabloid Liberation , with about half the circulation . But the founders of InfoMatin , which is financially supported by the venerable intellectual French daily Le Monde , contend that the_French press has lost touch with its readers . And the figures suggest they may have a point . Newspaper circulation has been in decline for some time . More and more people get their news from radio and television . Only one in 10 people buys a newspaper today , according to recent studies . Readership has fallen even among the most highly educated people , less than a quarter of whom now read a newspaper . It was for those non-readers , most of them young urban professionals , that InfoMatin was created . &quot; Ten years ago , it would have been impossible to publish this kind of paper , &quot; said Marc Jezegabel , InfoMatin ' s 37-year-old editor in chief . &quot; But now we are meeting the expectations of the younger readers . They want something with no political color. &quot; Other newspaper_editors and publishers , facing falling circulation and advertising revenues , are watching InfoMatin ' s gamble warily . Of more_than a dozen daily newspapers in Paris today , the youngest is Liberation , which was founded 21 years ago . And the country ' s history is littered with newspaper failures . * One reason for competitors ' concern is InfoMatin ' s price . The paper is selling for 3 francs , about 50 U.S. cents , less than the price of un cafe . Liberation and Le Figaro each cost twice that much . Le Parisien , a popular , working-class tabloid , recently launched a 60-cent national version called Aujourd ' hui ( Today ) . &quot; InfoMatin is very professional , and it does what it does perfectly , &quot; said the head of another Paris daily , who asked not to be named . &quot; But I think their concept is completely mad. &quot; &quot; People buy a newspaper to get more_than they get_through TV or radio , &quot; the newspaperman added . &quot; In that paper , you don ' t get much more . It won ' t last. &quot; Alain Schott , 33 , one of the co-founders , said it ' s probably too early to claim that InfoMatin is a success . But the sales figures &quot; certainly are a big victory for the daily press , &quot; he said . &quot; We have shown there is still a curiosity out there for the press . The press is not dead. &quot; Indeed , total newspaper purchases in Paris have soared , by nearly 50 % , since InfoMatin ' s debut . And the other major newspapers appear to be holding their readers in the face of InfoMatin ' s challenge . &quot; We are filling a void that was created by the other papers , &quot; said Alain Carlier , another of the founders and now president of the company that publishes InfoMatin . &quot; Those papers are unattractive , their stories are too long , they don ' t have practical information and they ' re too expensive. &quot; &quot; We don ' t think we have any competition , &quot; Carlier added . &quot; We are creating a new market. &quot; One reason for the paper ' s success may be its marketing campaign , the largest ever undertaken to launch a new newspaper . Across France , InfoMatin occupies 117 # 000 billboards -- about twice the number used in the typical launch of a new car line . The paper ' s slogans , if not necessarily the newspaper , have been read by nearly every person in France . The most popular is &quot; Toute l ' Info , Rien que l ' Info. &quot; All the News , Nothing but the News . * Even on the newsstand , InfoMatin looks different from most of the other French dailies . It is smaller than a tabloid , only about an inch bigger than the size of a letter , and printed on whiter paper , similar to that used by USA Today . The front page features the paper ' s name , written in two shades of blue ; one or more large color photographs , and headlines and synopses of eight to 10 of the stories contained inside . The articles inside are short , ranging from brief paragraphs to a_couple_of hundred words , though a two-page section is devoted to one topic . Inside the paper , advertising is intentionally limited to just 12 % , compared to more_than 50 % in most American newspapers . The owners say they can make a profit with that amount of advertising and a circulation of 100 # 000 . That could protect the paper from one of the biggest threats to the industry . In the last two years , advertising revenues for French papers have fallen 25 % , and another 10 % drop is expected this year due_to the recession . * InfoMatin ' s newsroom is located in the southeast Paris suburb of Ivry-sur-Seine , occupying one floor in a building owned by Le Monde . InfoMatin ' s editors and reporters brush_off suggestions that the paper is a &quot; popular &quot; tabloid , such_as the crime sheets that appeal_to some readers in Paris . Rather , they see InfoMatin as a shorter , more colorful version of their patron , Le Monde , a gray , hugely respected afternoon daily given to lengthy analysis of domestic and international issues . &quot; This is not fast food , &quot; said Jezegabel , the editor . &quot; It is fast , but there is a lot to read . And we are based on serious news . There ' s not one important bit of news that is not in the newspaper every day. &quot; Carlier , InfoMatin ' s president and an administrative officer at Le Monde for 20 years , said that when Le Monde ' s editor read the InfoMatin prototype , he jokingly suggested that a line be added_to the bottom of each page . It would say : &quot; For further information , see Le Monde this afternoon. &quot; &quot; The editors at Le Monde are very proud_of us , &quot; Carlier said .</TEXT>
