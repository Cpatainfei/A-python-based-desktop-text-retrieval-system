   <TEXT> A 29-year-old , academic history of an obscure 19th-Century uprising might not spring_to_mind as the ideal traveling companion . But I have found that in a decade of annual visits to Mexico ' s Yucatan_peninsula , each accompanied by a different book about the Maya and their ancient civilization , nothing has affected me as indelibly as Nelson Reed ' s &quot; The Caste War of Yucatan &quot; ( Stanford_University Press ) . And , as with the best travel guides , I strongly suspect that an armchair traveler would be equally impressed , especially in light of the recent armed uprising of Maya peasants in neighboring Chiapas . Reed ' s account is admittedly a bloody Baedeker . &quot; There should be enough battles in this book for anyone ' s taste , &quot; Reed notes whimsically in the introduction , &quot; but readers must be warned that the shooting doesn ' t start until Chapter 3. &quot; In January of 1847 , the Maya rose against their European masters , called Creoles , in a six-day eruption of urban warfare and mob violence that rivaled in its savagery the worst of the_French revolution ' s Reign_of_Terror . The incident , in the city of Valladolid , sparked a revolt known as &quot; The War of Castes &quot; that lasted 65 years and cost more_than 200 # 000 lives . Barely mentioned in Yucatan ' s tourist literature or development brochures -- or even Mexican textbooks , which consider it a minor sideshow to the nation ' s history -- this story can easily escape even a regular visitor to the peninsula ' s ruins and resorts . With Reed ' s book in_hand , I saw many of the ruins and cities I thought I knew well in a profoundly different , sometimes disturbing , light . But the darker prism of &quot; The Caste War &quot; only deepens a traveler ' s appreciation , providing unexpected insight into the psyche of the enigmatic Maya and their modern descendants . Once you have consumed Reed ' s work -- and &quot; consume &quot; is the way most describe their reading experience -- it is impossible to view the modern Maya is precisely the same way . This is especially true for me on those not infrequent occasions when an Maya slips from a jungle trail on_the_road , machete slung on his belt , from some back-country , slash-and-burn rancho in the interior . For this history is more_than just a picturesque background : His grandfather might have fought in a rebel army . Yucatan ' s three preeminent cities -- Valladolid , Merida and Campeche -- had for years after Mexican independence from Spain in 1821 been jockeying for power . In internecine skirmishes , the cities ' Creole elites fought each other and , in various combinations , the central government in Mexico_City . Weary of doing the battling themselves , the Europeans raised militias from local Maya , over whom they claimed lordship , treating the Mayas as slaves , serfs and , finally , as cannon_fodder . After one skirmish between rival municipal militias , a company of Maya soldiers marched_on Valladolid , flushed with success . In the city , which banned both Mayas and mixed bloods from its center , the Maya began to celebrate with the local brew , aguardiente , and then ran amok , massacring the local Creoles and hacking to death their own light-skinned officers . The battle_cry of the warriors in breechclout , echoing Paris ' sans-culottes , was : &quot; Kill everyone in trousers ! &quot; Several months after the Valladolid rising , a full-fledged rebellion exploded in the nearby town of Tepich . It was an epic struggle -- at one point in the war the rebels had captured nearly the entire peninsula , to the gates of Merida and Campeche in the west . But with total victory in_sight , they decided it was time to go_home to plant maize . Even after several military and political disasters and numerous plots and betrayals led to their ultimate &quot; pacification &quot; around 1910 , the rebels managed to hang_on to Yucatan ' s Caribbean coastal jungle -- much of what became the unassimilated Mexican state of Quintana Roo . For modern travelers to the area , most of whom are drawn to ancient Maya ruins like those of Chichen Itza and Tulum , touring with &quot; The Caste War &quot; in_hand adds another dimension . Even a favorite tourist haunt like Isla Mujeres , the sleepy village off the coast of Cancun , was settled by descendants of frightened Creoles who fled their haciendas on the mainland during the uprising . The chill I have experienced on visits to Chichen Itza I long supposed was_due to all_the blood in the ground at the spiritual center , which I always took_to_be ritual , symbolic and ancient : Here , more_than a_thousand years ago , Maya priests ripped the still beating hearts from captives atop pyramids , and threw bejeweled young people into the sacred cenote . But these were not the only sacrifices . During the Caste War , hundreds of Mexican prisoners were massacred by rebels beneath the stone arch of the nearby hacienda . The Caste War rebels became masterful guerrillas , early practitioners of biological_warfare and superb tacticians . They poisoned wells in abandoned villages in the path of their advancing enemies by tossing_in clothes from dead cholera victims ; dipped thorn bush branches in the decaying bodies of foxes and left them for the barefoot Creole soldiers ; dug concealed pits above sharpened stakes ; and learned to advance before gunfire by lying on their backs and rolling large stones with their feet toward the enemy . On a larger scale , the rebels exploited differences among their white opponents -- including Yucatan ' s inter-city rivalries -- and took_advantage of geopolitical events that distracted the attention of the central government : the Mexican-American War ; Napoleon III ' s invasion of Mexico ; and Mexican designs on neighboring British_Honduras , now Belize . There was also American military involvement , almost all_of it opposed to the Maya rebels , in the persons of freebooting veterans of the Mexican and Civil War . When the Caste War capital of Chan Santa Cruz fell to the Mexican government in 1901 , Edward Thompson , the American consul to Yucatan , wrote to his superior , an assistant secretary_of_state : &quot; The reconquering of this territory is of importance to the United States for it means the opening of large tracts of land containing mahogany , cedar logwood and sapote . It has been a tantalizing proposition to many Americans , but until now the obstacles have been hard to surmount . Those obstacles will soon not exist. &quot; Sure enough , two years later J . Pierpont Morgan , Cyrus McCormick and the Deering brothers formed International Harvester , and before long the cordage of Yucatan ' s sisal crop was controlled by the &quot; Twine Trust. &quot; In light of this history , I wonder how that Mayan standing by the side of the jungle road , machete in his belt , sees me . Am I equally the heir of the American soldiers_of_fortune and economic imperialists , as he is the heir of heroic rebels ? Does he see me as just the latest in a long line of Yankee visitors to the neighborhood who have come_to loot archeological sites , exploit natural_resources , &quot; save &quot; souls , subvert the government or administer well-meaning but ineffectual aid programs ? It is tempting to distance myself from this legacy by simply romanticizing the Caste War , simplifying the struggle and elevating the rebels to Spartacus status . Walking the crumbling walls of Tulum , an ancient Maya city overlooking the Caribbean_Sea , lolling on its sheltered beach , climbing the temple that faces the sea -- from which two lights marked the passage through the reef to ocean-going canoes -- I think_of the beleaguered Mayan rebels in the final stages of their revolt , defending the last pockets of resistance . &quot; The Caste War &quot; was published in 1964 by Stanford_University Press , and has sold steadily since then . In the U.S. , it is used as the standard college text on the war . There have been eight Spanish language editions published in Mexico , where it is also still considered the definitive work , although one reviewer in Merida charged the book was &quot; anti-white , &quot; Reed told me in a telephone_interview from St . Louis . Reed , a twice-wounded veteran of Gen . George Patton ' s Third Army and winner of the Bronze_Star in World_War_II , wandered into Yucatan in 1948 while on summer vacation from Washington University . It was in the town of Bacalar , he wrote in the forward , that he was inspired to write what has become the classic work_on the subject . &quot; I was surprised to find the overgrown ruins of a Spanish colonial town , including a church and moated fortress picturesquely situated on a hill above a lake , &quot; he wrote . &quot; A few people lived there , and a missionary priest had partially repaired the church , but street after street of roofless buildings stood as evidence of its past . In answer to my questions , I was told that the place had been destroyed by Indians in something called the War of the Castes. &quot; At the time , Reed was at a crossroad in his life , studying painting before he was expected to join the family_business in St . Louis . Captivated by the history he stumbled across , he began 15 years of research into the Maya uprising . He taught himself Spanish , haunted archives in Mexico and Belize and traveled_by bus , mule and canoe to interview survivors of the rebellion and their descendants . After writing &quot; The Caste War , &quot; Reed spent the next 25 years with Reed Oil Rubber Co . He also worked_on a number of archeological digs_in the United States and , as a part-time research associate at Washington University , lectured to college classes . He retired from the family firm in 1991 , a year after publishing &quot; Family Papers , &quot; a study of his colonial Virginia forebears . Now , at 67 , he is at_work on a novel based on the life of Gonzalo Guerrero , a shipwrecked 16th-Century Spaniard who became a Mayan chief famed for battling invading Conquistadors on the Yucatan coast . About seven years ago , Reed made his last visit to Yucatan , invited by the governor of Quintana Roo State to a conference on the Caste War held_in the capital of Chetumal . During the conference , Reed said , incendiary pamphlets in the Maya language were slipped under hotel_room doors by local communists , who claimed kinship with the Caste War rebels , appropriating it as part of_their_own revolutionary legacy . Whether or not those communist guerrillas were the rightful standard-bearers of the Caste War rebels is debatable , but what is certain is that the old revolutionary spirit has not been extinguished in Yucatan . In the villages of the interior , the Maya have been left to govern their own day-to-days lives . Over the past decade , the Maya ' s insurgency has been most broadly manifested by electoral opposition to Mexico ' s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , known by its Spanish initials as the PRI . This is in marked contrast to the Maya peasants of Chiapas , about 1 # 000 of whom mounted an armed insurgency on New Year ' s Day , which cost more_than 100 lives , but not before seizing and occupying eight cities and town before it was crushed by the Mexican army . As recently as December , the Maya of Yucatan demonstrated in large_numbers in Merida , protesting what they said was the PRI ' s widespread fraud at the polls during recent state elections : The heirs of their Creole masters had triumphed again . The Caste War combined the worst aspects of race , class and communal struggles . With barbarism on both sides , quarter was rarely asked and rarely given . In its set-piece battles , with artillery used by both sides and village-by-village campaigns decided by machete , the war was reminiscent_of better-known , late 18th-Century peasant uprisings . In its brutality , the Caste War rivaled 20th-Century European civil_wars in Spain , Greece and the former Yugoslavia . &quot; It was a human tragedy , of course , for everyone involved , &quot; Reed said . &quot; There was no happy ending. &quot; Trust Me on This is an occasional feature in which writers make a case for that forgotten , obscure or unsung book that they put_in everyone ' s hands with the words : &quot; Read this . You ' ll love it . Trust me on this. &quot; &quot; The Caste War of Yucatan &quot; is available in paperback from Stanford_University Press .</TEXT>
