   <HEADLINE> ALPINE SKIING PREVIEW ; DON ' T LOOK FOR AMERICANS TO CRASH MEDAL PARTIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From Sun Valley to the Seine , Picabo to Piccard , the world ' s greatest Alpine racers gather_in the global village here to compete in an Olympic battle of wills . Will home-country hero , Kjetil Andre Aamodt , turn two weeks of Alpine into a Norwegian cruise ? Will Italy ' s Alberto Tomba make headlines and history ? If Marc Girardelli , Luxembourg ' s one-man band , wins his first gold medal , will he admit that he wanted it all along ? Will the recent death of Austria ' s Ulrike Maier shake skiers to the core at 70 m.p.h. ? Will the U.S. team dust off the cobwebs of controversy and rekindle those warm and fuzzy medal days of 1984 ? Or will they come_up with another Calgary goose_egg ? Two weeks of sharp turns and story lines begin Sunday with the men ' s downhill at Kvitfjell and end two Sundays later with the great Tomba and the men ' s slalom at Hafjell . America first ? Not in this space race . The U.S. ski team has its share of stars -- some rising , some fading -- but are Shawn Bradley-thin . Ten American men have found their way to Lillehammer , yet if you lined them up and asked the medal contenders to step_forward , only Tommy Moe and AJ Kitt would have the right to move . Kitt , accustomed to the spotlight , fielded most of the questions at a recent news_conference , when in fact Moe , seated to his left , has surpassed him this season as America ' s best downhill racer . Moe , from Palmer , Alaska , ranks ninth in current World Cup standings in both downhill and super giant slalom , and also figures to be a medal contender in combined , a run of downhill one day and two slalom runs the next . &quot; This kid is really good , and he doesn ' t really know yet what he can do , &quot; Bob Beattie , the veteran ski analyst and former U.S. Alpine coach , said of Moe . Kitt , the only American to have won a World Cup downhill since Bill Johnson in 1984 , began the season as a strong Olympic medal hope but has fallen_out of the podium picture , currently ranking 22nd in downhill . Theories ? Some think Kitt over-trained last summer , doubling his on-snow workouts . The tabloid angle is that he has fallen hard for Nancy Elder , the reigning Miss Canada , and love has cost him his edge . Kitt met Elder last summer while judging the Miss Universe contest . &quot; I haven ' t come_to the conclusion why I haven ' t had a good season so far , &quot; Kitt said . &quot; I ' m trying to put the struggle out of my mind and trying to ski fast. &quot; It is not as though Kitt has been crossing his tips . He finished 12th in the last downhill he raced , at Wengen , Switzerland . But Beattie thinks he has too_much ground to make_up . &quot; I ' m a great believer that if you don ' t start cracking the top 10 , you shouldn ' t think_about winning a medal , &quot; Beattie said . The men ' s technical team ? The Jamaican bobsled team has a better chance to win a medal . The U.S. women are , again , intriguing at best . Last weekend , as the U.S. ski team read about its failures in a magazine story that flogged the American Alpine program , Hilary Lindh won the downhill at Sierra_Nevada , Spain . that ' s one way to silence your critics . Lindh , the defending Olympic downhill silver medalist , is hot on the comeback trail , having missed most of 1992-93 while recuperating from knee surgery . More important , she has rounded into form in the critical days before the Olympic downhill , Feb . 19 . Sun Valley ' s Picabo Street , last year ' s silver medalist in combined at the World Championships , started slowly but recently started breaking_into the top 10 . Heidi Voelker and Eva Twardokens have medal shots in giant slalom . Voelker currently ranks sixth in the world in the event , Twardokens 11th . Then , there are the unsolved mysteries . Diann Roffe-Steinrotter , the 1992 Olympic GS silver medalist , has fallen to 30th place in her best event and appears to have run_out of gas at 26 . Julie Parisien , who missed the bronze in slalom at Albertville by five-hundredths of a second , is a skier in crisis , still torn emotionally by the death of her brother in December of 1992 . Once the world ' s top-ranked slalom skier , Parisien has fallen_out of the top 20 . Paul Major , the U.S. Alpine director , says she can still work some Olympic magic , but that is not the prevailing wisdom . Other skiers to watch : -- Girardelli . The five-time World Cup overall champion , arguably the best all-around skier ever , seeks his first Olympic gold . In what might be a ploy to relieve himself of the pressure , Girardelli has spent the pre-Olympic weeks bad-mouthing the importance of the games . He ' s 30 , though , and this could be his last chance not to give_a_hoot . -- Tomba . He will try to become the first skier to win gold in three consecutive Olympics . Tomba swept slalom and GS at Calgary in 1988 , then followed with gold in GS at Albertville . After winning only one World Cup race last year , he was castigated by the Italian press . Tomba has since returned to dominance and -- ominously for the competition -- won the last two slaloms leading to the Games and currently ranks second in the World Cup overall , quite a feat considering Tomba does not ski downhill or Super G . -- Aamodt . Simply , the best skier in the world , and the heir_apparent to Girardelli ' s throne as all-around champion . The 22-year-old Norwegian is the reigning Olympic champion in Super G , and defending world champion in slalom and GS . Putting his mind to downhill this year , he won that World Cup event at Chamonix , France , on Jan . 29 . As for being the home favorite , Aamodt responds , &quot; Everybody expects , and wants Norway to win . That can be an advantage or a disadvantage . If you think the people believe_in you , it could be an advantage . If you think_of the expectations people have of you , it might not be an advantage. &quot; A look_at the races : WOMEN ' S SLALOM Olympic champion : Petra Kronberger , Austria . World Cup champion : Vreni Schneider , Switzerland . Fab five : Schneider , Urska Hrovat , Slovenia ; Anita Wachter , Austria ; Pernilla Wiberg , Sweden ; Morena Gallizio , Italy . Comments : Kronberger , a three-time overall champion , retired last year at 23 . Schneider , 29 , shows no signs of slowing . She is the current World Cup leader in overall and slalom . Parisien remains America ' s best medal hope . WOMEN ' S GIANT SLALOM Olympic champion : Wiberg . World Cup champion : Carole Merle , France . Fab five : Wiberg , Wachter , Deborah Compagnoni , Italy ; Christine Meier and Martina Ertl , Germany . Comments : Wiberg , who has rebounded wonderfully from Achilles ' tendon surgery in 1992 , is stronger in slalom this season . This is the best event for Wachter , the defending World Cup overall champion . The Germans swept the GS on the Hafjell Olympic course during a World Cup stop last March , with Meier winning . America ' s Heidi Voelker could sneak_up and surprise . WOMEN ' S SUPER-G Olympic champion : Compagnoni . World Cup champion : Katra Seizinger , Germany . Fab five : Seizinger , Wiberg , Compagnoni , Bibiana Perez , Italy ; Katja Koren , Slovenia . Comments : The late Ulrike Maier would have been a medal contender here . Seizinger rules as the world ' s top woman in super-G and downhill . Megan Gerety , the top U.S. hope at the beginning of the season , ranks 33rd in the world . Hilary Lindh ranks 20th . WOMEN ' S DOWNHILL Olympic champion : Kerrin Lee-Gartner , Canada . World Cup champion : Seizinger . Fab five : Seizinger , Lee-Gartner , Kate Pace , Canada ; Veronika Stallmaier , Austria , and Lindh .

WOMEN ' S COMBINED Olympic champion : Kronberger . World Cup champion : Wachter . Fab five : Renate Goetschl , Austria ; Wachter , Wiberg , Street , Miriam Vogt , Germany . Comments : Street won silver at the World Championships last year , and she appears to be peaking . MEN ' S SLALOM Olympic champion : Finn Christian Jagge , Norway . World Cup champion : Tomas Fogdoe , Sweden . Fab five : Tomba , Thomas Stangassinger , Austria ; Jure Kosir , Slovenia ; Christian Jagge , Fogdoe . Comments : Can anyone deny Tomba his destiny ? He starts the Olympics having won consecutive World Cup slaloms at Garmisch-Partenkirchen , Germany , and Chamonix . American Matt Grosjean finished 10th in this event at the Albertville Games , but has not been heard from since . MEN ' S GIANT SLALOM Olympic champion : Tomba . World Cup champion : Aamodt . Fab five : Aamodt , Christian Mayer , Austria ; Franck Piccard and Guenther Mader , Austria , and Tomba . Comments : This hasn ' t been Tomba ' s best event this year , but it is hard to bet against the two-time defending Olympic champion . Aamodt will make his considerable Olympic presence known in this race . The U.S. doesn ' t have a prayer . MEN ' S SUPER-G Olympic and World Cup champion : Aamodt . Fab five : Aamodt , Girardelli , Mader , Markus Wasmeier , Germany ; Jan Einar Thorsen , Norway . Comments : Girardelli is closing fast in this event , having won at Wengen . But since he insists he doesn ' t care about the Olympics , give the nod to Aamodt , who does . MEN ' S DOWNHILL Olympic champion : Patrick Ortlieb , Austria . World Cup champion : Franz Heinzer , Switzerland . Fab five : Ortlieb , Girardelli , Aamodt , William Besse , Switzerland ; Hannes Trinkl , Austria . Comments : Heinzer was the best downhiller going until he suffered a concussion while training for Kitzbuehel race in January . Alarm_bells rang concerning his condition when he missed his own country ' s downhill at Wengen . Heinzer appeared fine in Thursday ' s training run here , however , finishing ninth . Ortlieb proved his Olympic victory was no fluke when he won his first two World Cup downhills this year , at Val Gardena , Italy , and the famed Kitzbuehel . Aamodt finished fifth on the Kvitfjell course last year . Moe is cocky and good , both at the right time . MEN ' S COMBINED Olympic champion : Josef Polig , Italy . World Cup champion : Girardelli . Fab five : Aamodt , Lasse Kjus , Norway ; Girardelli , Mader , Moe . Comments : Don ' t be surprised if Norway goes 1-2 here . Girardelli would be more of a favorite , but he is not skiing as well in slalom .</TEXT>
