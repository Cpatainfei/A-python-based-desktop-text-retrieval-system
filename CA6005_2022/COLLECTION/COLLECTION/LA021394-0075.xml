   <HEADLINE> ACTING DOES PAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In reference_to Dimitra Arlys ' letter of last Sunday , in which she accuses me of not paying the actors in &quot; The Tavern , &quot; hers is not an uncommon perception of the &quot; 99-seat theater plan. &quot; In 1988 , Actors Equity Assn. , in concert with local actor-producers , created an updated 99-seat theater plan that the Matrix Theatre Company and all venues of 99 seats or less that employ union actors adhere to . The actors in &quot; The Tavern &quot; have received 21 % of the gross box-office receipts to date . This is the highest acting payroll in any small theater in Los Angeles . This percentage is also higher than the national average that encompasses all Equity contracts across the country . I hope this clarifies a very important issue in this community -- an issue that many actors like Arlys use as an excuse to withhold their support for their fellow actors who work in small theater in Los Angeles .
