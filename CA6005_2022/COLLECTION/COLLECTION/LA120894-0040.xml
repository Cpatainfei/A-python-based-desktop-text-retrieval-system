   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON THE COURTS ; QUALIFIED JURISTS OR SAVVY POLITICOS ? ; TO PRESERVE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE , ALL JUDGES SHOULD BE APPOINTED ; NONE SHOULD HAVE TO RUN FOR ' REELECTION. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Simpson trial and other sensational Court TV crime cases have focused attention as never before on our state court judges . The intense spotlight creates an opportunity to raise anew a question : Should judges have to endure political-style campaigns to become judges ? Many legal and judicial experts think not . I share this view , and a recent professional experience confirms it . While most judges are appointed by the governor , a quirk in the law requires judicial vacancies in gubernatorial election years to be filled by_election . This finds them running_for office countywide , seeking support from millions of voters who know virtually nothing about them . In addition , judges who are initially appointed must stand_for election at the end of their terms . I was the election-law attorney for a successful Los Angeles Superior_Court candidate , a retiring legislator , in litigation with his opponent over the accuracy of their ballot statements and ballot titles . Since voters get nearly all_of their information about judicial candidates from ballot descriptions , their accuracy can become the principal battleground in any contested judicial campaign . My client will be an outstanding judge . But the fact that his election could have hinged_on the appeal of a three-word ballot title is precisely what is wrong with a system that elects judges by popular vote . Maintaining the dignity of our judges is vital to preserving their legitimacy and ability to command public respect . Campaigns in which judges must run_for office like ordinary politicians demean their stature and diminish the credibility of our judicial_system . As candidates , for example , judges must raise campaign funds . Most , being lawyers , obtain funds from other lawyers . Some of these campaign contributors will later appear in the judges ' courtrooms seeking relief for their clients . The possibility that elected judges could choose to hear contributors ' cases and rule_in favor of their clients without proper disclosure of the relationship places them in potentially compromising positions . Like ordinary politicians , judicial candidates will use litigation as a weapon to gain an advantage over their opponent . Such tactics inevitably draw the courts into partisan politics and require them to rule for and against competing judicial candidates , one of whom will soon become a colleague . This ability to affect the outcome of a judicial election places sitting judges in an uncomfortable position , yet it is one into which they are thrust by the current system . Such litigation also can produce court findings that one or both of the candidates have been &quot; guilty &quot; of misleading the public . Judges must be above suspicion . A victorious judicial candidate who was found to have misled the voters during the campaign -- even if the court ' s ruling was wrong or questionable -- would take the bench with a permanent stain on his record . Like ordinary politicians , judicial candidates and their campaign handlers also must work the media , exploiting and putting the best possible spin on campaign issues , including election-related court rulings . In short , judicial candidates must lower themselves and endure the indignities of an ordinary political_campaign to achieve a position in society that should be above politics . It is time to change the laws that require our state court judges to run_for office . All judges should be appointed by the governor on a bipartisan basis . The appointments would be recommended by a panel appointed by the governor , Assembly Speaker , Senate president and state Supreme Court chief_justice . Judges should not be required to run_for &quot; reelection. &quot; They should serve fixed terms of sufficiently long duration to ensure adequate independence and opportunity for professional growth and service . At the end of their terms , their qualifications for further service would be examined by the independent review panel . The governor then would have the option of reappointing a judge or naming another person from the independent candidate pool . Restoring public faith in government can only be helped by removing our judges from politics and placing them above the fray . Judge Lance Ito , who is presiding over the O.J. Simpson murder trial , was appointed . Let ' s guarantee that the judges who try the big cases of the future also will be picked for their qualifications , not for their popular three-word ballot titles .</TEXT>
