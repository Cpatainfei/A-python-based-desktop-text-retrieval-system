   <HEADLINE> EX-WIFE ' S FATHER RAISES DOUBT ON SIMPSON ALIBI ; COURT : HE SETS PHONE CALL EARLIER THAN CORONER DID . PROSECUTORS ALSO FACE HURDLE -- THEY LACK MURDER WEAPON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As prosecutors and defense_attorneys prepare_for the first public airing of evidence in the O.J. Simpson case , both have potential problems : Prosecutors have yet to discover the whereabouts of the murder weapon , while the father of one of the victims emerged Monday to challenge an element of Simpson ' s alibi . In an interview with The Times , Louis Brown said that on the day of her death , his daughter , Nicole Brown Simpson , had spoken with her mother about 10 p.m. , not 11 p.m. as a coroner ' s report on the murder scene indicated . The disclosure is important because Simpson ' s attorneys argue that he was home at 11 p.m. , waiting for a limousine to take him to the airport . If Nicole Simpson was alive at that time , it would support Simpson ' s alibi . That contention was bolstered when by a coroner ' s report stating that Nicole Simpson had spoken_to her mother by phone about 11 p.m. Simpson attorney F . Lee Bailey was quick Monday to cite the report as evidence of his client ' s innocence . &quot; We learned today from the coroner ' s report that Nicole ' s mother talked with her at 11 and he lives 10 minutes away , &quot; Bailey said . &quot; So , now you begin to have a problem saying that he was at the scene or could have been . . . . That is the defense : He was elsewhere. &quot; But Nicole Simpson ' s father disputed the coroner ' s reported findings Monday . &quot; Her mother called her to talk_about her reading glasses that had been left_behind there , &quot; Brown , 70 , said . He said he was certain that the call was made about 10 p.m. , not the later time specified in the coroner ' s report . Meanwhile , sources said Monday that prosecutors are headed for court with matching gloves found at the scene and at Simpson ' s home , with blood samples and potentially significant hair samples and with other evidence . But they have not found the weapon used in the June 12 killings , which could raise some problems for them , if not at this week ' s preliminary hearing , then possibly at trial . Law_enforcement sources say police believe that the assailant wielded a knife under 15 inches long , very sharp on at least one side , possibly with serrations . Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti has described it as a &quot; very substantial knife , &quot; big enough to have slit Nicole Simpson ' s throat and wielded by a person angry enough to have stabbed Ronald Lyle Goldman nearly two_dozen times in his neck , back , head , hands and thigh . But while they have been able to describe the knife from the wounds that it inflicted , investigators still do not know its whereabouts . They have searched a vacant_lot in Chicago , using metal detectors and dogs in a so-far futile hunt . Last week , they called it off , but Los Angeles Police Detective Bert Luper , who was supervising the search , said he is convinced that the weapon is in Chicago . &quot; Timing and corroborating evidence &quot; suggest that the weapon is there , Luper said , adding that police concentrated_on the lot near Simpson ' s Chicago hotel because &quot; it ' s one of only a_few places where he would have had time to dispose_of anything. &quot; Other sources say police have speculated that the weapon was stuffed into Simpson ' s golf_bag and checked onto the flight that he took from Los Angeles to Chicago shortly after the slayings . According to those sources , police suspected this because Simpson took his golf_clubs with him to Chicago and because they do not believe that he had time to dispose_of a weapon before being driven to Los Angeles International Airport on the night of the slayings . Police are now in possession of the golf_bag . Simpson also was carrying a duffel_bag . But sources say he carried it with him on the plane and therefore would have had to pass_through an airport metal detector or X-ray_machine with it . Police have interviewed airport workers who operate those machines . The search for the weapon in Chicago may have been compromised by an apparent lapse in ensuring that the area was sealed_off . Police began combing the lot near the hotel even before Simpson was arrested , but they suspended that search over the weekend of June 18 and then resumed it on the following Monday . They neglected to close the area in the interim , meaning that any evidence in the lot could have been taken without police knowledge . Police have other evidence , however , that may make the weapon less important than in some murder cases . According to sources , police have recovered bloodstained clothing , a matching pair of gloves -- one from the crime scene and another from outside Simpson ' s Brentwood mansion -- as well as a series of blood samples from the football Hall of Famer ' s Ford Bronco , from the crime scene and from his home . In a motion filed Monday , Simpson lawyer Robert L . Shapiro said that in the material provided to him by prosecutors , there are references_to blood samples , Simpson ' s car , a ski_cap and &quot; certain gloves found at the premises of the residences of Mr. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson. &quot; But Shapiro said his experts had not been provided with blood samples to conduct their own tests -- which he said were essential to prepare_for Thursday ' s preliminary hearing . In a sworn declaration , Shapiro ' s hired forensic pathologist , Michael Baden , said he was allowed to examine evidence but not to keep or photograph it . The evidence is needed so that Simpson ' s lawyers can mount an &quot; affirmative defense &quot; at the preliminary hearing , meaning that they could call witnesses and present evidence in defense of Simpson . That is rare for a preliminary hearing , in part because it can expose elements of the defense trial strategy . Prosecutors , meanwhile , asked a judge to order Simpson to provide a hair sample because black curly hairs &quot; of African American origin &quot; were found in the ski_cap at the crime scene , according to a motion filed by the lead prosecutor , Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark . A judge set the defense and prosecution motions for a hearing today . Earlier Monday , another judge ruled that the defense may have access to transcripts of testimony given to the grand_jury before that panel ' s work was abruptly cut_short last week . At the preliminary hearing Thursday , prosecutors may call witnesses to testify , though they may instead choose to rely heavily on the testimony of investigating police_officers . One possible witness , Jill Shively , told investigators that she saw a person resembling Simpson fleeing from the crime scene . But she accepted money for telling her story to the tabloid television_program &quot; Hard Copy , &quot; a move that would undermine her credibility if she is called to testify . In addition , small claims court records in Burbank reveal that she was ordered on June 28 , 1993 , to pay $ 2 # 000 in a court action after she was accused of peddling a script that she did not own . Brian Patrick Clarke , a television actor who was the plaintiff in the small claims court suit , said Shively had duped him in 1992 after posing as a budding screenwriter and asking him to read her latest script -- a heartwarming drama entitled &quot; Remember When , &quot; about a man with a pregnant wife and terminal cancer . Shively , he said , later told him that she had struck a deal to sell the script to a production company for $ 250 # 000 and to cast him as the star . But three weeks before the payment was_due , Clarke said , she told him she needed $ 6 # 000 , and he offered a loan against her script advance . Clarke said he later discovered that the script was not Shively ' s , but was for a film entitled &quot; My Life &quot; that was in pre-production starring Nicole Kidman and Michael Keaton . According to Clarke , she refused to repay his loan , prompting him to sue her . When Clarke saw her televised interview last week , he called authorities to let them know about his experience with Shively . His doubts about her credibility were shared by her own attorney . &quot; The minute I saw her on ' Hard Copy , ' I looked_up and said , ' If that ' s the best witness they ' ve got against O.J. Simpson , they ' re in_trouble , &quot; ' said Cheryl Korchak , a part-time lawyer who represented Shively in the small claims court case . With the preliminary hearing fast approaching , legal_experts said authorities ' inability to find the murder weapon is not likely to be fatal to the prosecution case but does provide Simpson ' s lawyers with a weakness to exploit . &quot; It ' s a hole in their case , &quot; said Donald Re , one of Los Angeles ' most respected criminal defense_attorneys and the lawyer for Simpson ' s close friend Al Cowlings . &quot; Obviously , what they would like to do is put the weapon in the defendant ' s hand before the time of the murder . Without the weapon , they can ' t do that. &quot; Laurie Levenson , a Loyola law_school professor and former federal prosecutor , said defense_attorneys could exploit the absence of a weapon to suggest that the case against Simpson is not airtight . &quot; The thing about not having the murder weapon is that it raises questions , &quot; she said . &quot; And in a criminal case , all you have to do is raise a reasonable doubt. &quot; Still , prosecutors have convicted criminal defendants in many cases where no weapon was found . The success of those cases generally depends_on producing other compelling evidence , such_as scientific samples or eyewitness accounts of a crime . &quot; The weapon by itself is not the key to this , &quot; Barry Tarlow , a prominent defense_attorney in Los Angeles , said of the Simpson case . &quot; I think it ' s a sideshow unless they find a weapon and definitively tie it to Simpson. &quot; In other developments Monday : * Defense_attorney Bailey laid the groundwork for challenging blood_tests from samples taken at the scene of the crime as well as from Simpson ' s car , residence and belongings . Police are conducting DNA tests , and sources say that preliminary findings continue to point to Simpson . But Bailey said DNA tests are not necessarily conclusive and could be contested in court . Said Bailey : &quot; Some experts would say it shows one thing , some experts could say no , it doesn ' t show that , and away we go. &quot; * Municipal Judge Ray L . Hart heard arguments on NBC ' s request to unseal records related to the 1989 spousal battery case against Simpson . The records include two letters from Simpson ' s court-appointed psychiatrist , reports attached_to the arrest_warrant and copies of photographs . NBC ' s lawyer asked_for release of the material , while attorneys for Simpson , the city and the district_attorney opposed the motion , arguing that the contents could taint potential jurors and prevent a fair trial . A court clerk said the judge would rule on the motion later this week . * Psychiatrist Saul Faerstein visited Simpson for two hours in jail and said afterward : &quot; O.J. wanted me to say to the people that he ' s very encouraged by the letters he ' s receiving . He feels a lot of love in his heart from all_of the people who support him and know him . He ' s getting stronger and he looks_forward to his day in court. &quot; * Time magazine , which published a controversial photographic &quot; illustration &quot; of Simpson ' s mug_shot on its cover last week , ran a long explanation for that decision . &quot; I have looked_at thousands of covers over the years and chosen hundreds , &quot; Managing Editor James R . Gaines wrote . &quot; I have never been so wrong about how one would be received. &quot; Times staff writers Andrea Ford , Shawn Hubler , Greg Krikorian and Nicholas Riccardi contributed to this report .</TEXT>
