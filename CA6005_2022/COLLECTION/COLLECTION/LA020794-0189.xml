   <TEXT> On the 15th anniversary of Iran ' s revolution , the austere Islamic republic has less to celebrate than at any time since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini forced the shah to abandon the legendary Peacock Throne , according to U.S. officials and Iran experts . For years , Khomeini ' s revolutionary regime faced its primary challenges from abroad : the war with Iraq , diplomatic isolation imposed by the United States , economic sanctions from the West , the disdain of the Arab world . Now Iran ' s problems are largely internal . With the economy a shambles , the government is squabbling over such distractions as foreign videos , pornography and proper women ' s clothing . &quot; There ' s no mortal , external threat to the revolution , &quot; said a Clinton_Administration official who asked not to be named . &quot; The greatest destruction is coming from within. &quot; The mounting internal tension erupted during commemorations at Khomeini ' s tomb last week when five shots were fired in what Tehran radio later called an assassination attempt against President Hashemi Rafsanjani . Yet Iran has spurned repeated opportunities over the last year to take steps -- including improving diplomatic and trade relations with the West , particularly the United States -- that might help ease its problems . Relations between Washington and Tehran have turned colder after what had looked_like a thaw at the end of the George_Bush Administration . Rafsanjani ' s regime is believed to be well-aware of its plight . But for all its initial interest in repairing international relations , it has hesitated for fear of backlash at_home . When Rafsanjani was elected president after Khomeini ' s death in 1989 , U.S. diplomats viewed him as a pragmatist who favored loosening Iran ' s strict Islamic rule politically , economically and socially . In 1989 , and again after the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War , when Iran remained neutral and then helped win release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon , Rafsanjani gave American officials grounds to hope for improved relations . They expected him to move toward political , economic , social and diplomatic reforms after purging Khomeini ' s die-hard followers from Parliament in 1992 . Many hard-liners were , indeed , driven from office . But they were replaced by social conservatives who had little use for reforms . Rafsanjani ' s maneuvering room was further circumscribed last year by the narrow margin of_his_own reelection . Analysts are now pessimistic that Rafsanjani ' s second term -- and his final one , under Iran ' s constitution -- will feature significant openings in either domestic or foreign_policy . &quot; The political base of the regime is now very narrow , &quot; said Shaul Bakhash , a professor at George Mason University in Virginia . &quot; To keep this base happy , the regime must appear radical on international issues and Islamically correct on social issues like women ' s dress and Coca-Cola. &quot; Part of the problem faced by Rafsanjani is known in Tehran as the &quot; Gorbachev syndrome &quot; -- the land_mines that await leaders who try to introduce a little reform into authoritarian countries . Soviet leader Mikhail S . Gorbachev &quot; made concessions that were intended to reform communism , not scrap it . But in the end he lost everything , &quot; said Geoffrey Kemp , a National Security_Council staffer in the Ronald Reagan_Administration . &quot; Even Iranian pragmatists are afraid that , if they make concessions , reforms will never be enough and will instead open_up a slippery slope . They ' re obsessed with fear that the whole idea of a modern Islamic republic will collapse. &quot; Iran ' s economy -- depleted by the prolonged war with Iraq , a birthrate that has nearly doubled the population in 15 years and rampant corruption and mismanagement -- is a mess . Inflation has reportedly reached almost 100 % a year , while unemployment and underemployment are soaring . Middle-class workers , forced in the last five years to work second jobs to make ends meet , are now taking_on third jobs . Up to two-thirds of Iranian factories run at limited capacity , with raw_materials in chronic shortage . Two years ago , Iran ' s Majlis , or Parliament , passed laws to make Iran once again inviting for foreign investment . Although some of the new laws are even more favorable to foreigners than those in_effect during the shah ' s Western-oriented regime , they have failed to lure significant outside interest . Meanwhile , the drop_in world oil prices has led to an estimated 20 % budget shortfall for the Islamic year ending in March , according to Iran ' s Oil Ministry . The resulting cash-flow problem has increased the difficulties of gaining access to the credit necessary to buy foreign consumer goods . Economic woes have , in turn , forced the government to propose reductions in subsidies for gasoline and other necessities -- moves criticized in both Parliament and the press and likely to hurt the regime ' s power base among the poor . While the economy has collapsed , the Majlis , once the engine of revolutionary action , has passed no major legislation . Instead , tangential issues have dominated the agenda . After years of a thriving black_market in videos , for example , the Majlis last year finally allowed foreign videos . The government went_into the business of dubbing movies in an attempt to control content , and it allowed the death_penalty for repeated convictions for distributing pornography . The Majlis came_down hard when state-controlled Iranian television , which is run_by the president ' s brother , tried to introduce more entertainment and foreign shows . Late last year , it condemned Iranian television for showing &quot; Billy Budd , &quot; a 1962 film based on a Herman Melville novella about an 18th-Century seaman who is court-martialed for killing a sadistic master-at-arms . The criticism was based on the characterization of Budd as highly moral , even though he was implicitly illegitimate . Despite all its problems , the regime still faces no internal opposition force capable of ousting it , American officials say . And the regime still likes to blame the United States for its woes . Just last month , Rafsanjani declared that Washington had &quot; lost the game &quot; of trying to topple the Islamic republic . &quot; We have been exposed to a very dangerous propaganda plot engineered by arrogant powers , particularly America , &quot; he said in a sermon at Tehran University . But Iran is now &quot; out_of_danger , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re in need of practically nothing with_regard_to defense . . . . Iran has reached a state of stability , and they can no longer do us harm. &quot; But American policy has grown less intent_on manipulating Iran , Administration officials contend . &quot; Since the hostage period , we have come_of_age in a difficult area . We no longer believe we can play games inside the country to strengthen one wing or weaken another , &quot; an Iran analyst said . The Administration is now pursuing a strategy of &quot; enhanced containment , &quot; focusing only on the actions and policies that concern Washington . Most notable are Iran ' s opposition to the Middle_East peace process and its support of extremist groups , both Islamic and secular . In accord with that strategy , the Administration has banned the sale to Iran of any goods that might have military uses . And Iranian goods may_not be sold in the United States . Yet the door is not completely shut . U.S. oil_companies are now the biggest buyers of Iranian oil . Since they can ' t bring it home , they sell it outside the United States . U.S. exports to Iran -- consumer goods , oil equipment and other non-military material -- climbed from $ 60 million in 1989 to $ 750 million in 1992 , according to the Commerce_Department . Kemp , the Reagan_Administration official , said the Clinton_Administration had adopted &quot; a realistic approach to Iran that calls_for a dialogue . Iran has rejected that call . And it ' s highly unlikely that Tehran will be able to change its policy on that count anytime soon . It ' s a unique situation where we ' re so used_to the United States not talking to people . Now it ' s the other way around. &quot;</TEXT>
