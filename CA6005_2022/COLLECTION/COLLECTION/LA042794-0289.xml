   <HEADLINE> RICHARD NIXON : 1913-1994 ; HOW ONE MAN CAN BE REMEMBERED IN SUCH DIVERSE WAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Richard Nixon lets us all play the historian . Given that his public life coincided with the emergence of the modern communications industry , we have no shortage of pictures and words on which to base our judgment . You ' d think our task would be easy . The Checkers speech . The kitchen debate with Khrushchev . The Kennedy-Nixon debates . The Watergate press_conferences . The resignation speech . The David Frost interviews . Unlike with other heroes and villains in America ' s past , we in the modern age feel less reliance on historians for judgments . We can ' t know for_sure what George_Washington was really like , or what Billy the Kid was really like . But when it comes_to the major figures of our time , we ' re under no such handicap : We saw what we saw , we heard what we heard . So how come we didn ' t all see and hear the same things when it comes_to Richard Nixon ? The instinctive reaction is to say that the reflecting pool of partisan politics refracts light and sound . Though certainly no extremist , Nixon played partisan politics for much of his life . That in itself would have been enough to engender mixed feelings about him . As much as anyone , he reveled in the knockdown , drag-out nature of the skirmishing and preferred bare knuckles to gloves . One is tempted to say this physically awkward , lifelong piano_player couldn ' t fight with his fists , so he forged his manhood by fighting with brains and guile . To anyone who understands that context , it ' s an easy leap to understand that being a man and playing hardball meant being not only able to dish it out , but also to take it . * How Nixon loved to dish it out . But he prided himself on taking it , as well . He thought the Kennedys may have cheated him in 1960 , but he took it and didn ' t challenge the election , although some historians think he may have had a case . He decided after the 1972 election that he was going_to let his enemies have it . Instead of rising above the fray and saying , &quot; No , we won ' t play the game that way , &quot; Nixon said , &quot; Oh , so that ' s the way they want to play it , huh . . . ? &quot; Had he chosen the former , no one would be debating his place in contemporary American history . And though he no doubt thought the media and other enemies stole the presidency from him in 1974 , he took it then , too -- in the sense that he decided almost immediately that he would n ' t let it destroy him . To have given_in would have proved others had gotten_the_best of him . Better to set sights on another battle ahead -- the battle to regain credibility . And from what we ' ve heard in recent days , much of the outpouring of affection toward Nixon stems from the fact that he &quot; took it. &quot; He absorbed the most public humiliation of any President in history , and he took it . And survived it . For large segments of the American population , that amounted to an honorable deed . In some quarters , it accords him hero status . Indeed , most of the talk since Nixon ' s death has centered not on politics but on personality . The words heard most frequently to describe him seem to be &quot; complicated , &quot; &quot; enigmatic &quot; and &quot; dark side / bright_side &quot; splits . Part of the reason we may find that fascinating today is that it ' s so unlike the vogue . With celebrities and public figures surrendering to a manic desire to tell us everything about themselves , from repressed memories to their inner child , Nixon appeared not to know or care about such things . Why should he worry about 15 minutes of fame when he ' d had nearly 50 years of it ? Just eschewing today ' s pop culture elevated Nixon ' s status in recent years . * The country ' s central ambivalence toward Nixon ' s life , of course , centers_on his presidential years of 1969 to 1974 . What came_before and what came_after only served to frame that critical 5 1 / 2 years in his and our lives . Nixon reflected much of American folklore in that he often spoke in homilies -- never give_up , forgive your enemies , do what you think is right . Those sentiments make_up part of our collective national storehouse of &quot; traditional values , &quot; and , as such , drew many people to Richard Nixon ' s side . The persistent question was whether you believed him or not . Some accepted what he said at face_value ; others saw it as someone who had memorized the catechism but couldn ' t live its teachings . Another crucial factor_in public feeling about Nixon is that his presidency occurred during the fermenting of intense generational and racial splits in the country . To the Silent Majority to which he catered , Nixon represented the sentry at the gate -- an Establishment bulwark against the longhairs and civil_rights activists who seemed intent_on turning everything upside down . To people worried about the future of the country , the politics of Watergate seemed trivial , indeed . As such , many people didn ' t pay_attention . Despite its place in modern political drama , we should remember that many people didn ' t bother to immerse themselves in the details at the time . If not blissful , ignorance can at least be soothing . While many look_back in disgust at a President talking in the White_House about perjury and paying hush_money to burglars , many others today talk_of a President who , at worst , &quot; made a_few mistakes. &quot; * If it ' s important that average Americans make their judgments about Nixon , we probably should note that average Americans are probably more forgiving than historians . The academics have to write books with their names on them ; average citizens only have to live with their feelings . Historians can ' t afford to overlook Watergate . The average citizen can if he or she wants to . In the latter regard , Nixon probably caught a break . As a lover of history , maybe he knew better than most that time passes . It gets easier all_the time to forget how wrenching and dispirited the American political scene was by the time Nixon resigned the presidency . Because this is a forgiving society , most people have put it behind them . Twenty years is a long_time for anyone to hold a grudge . Just as we do with relatives with whom we fought while they were alive , we tend to remember their better attributes after they ' re gone . Therein is the question that Richard Nixon makes us confront , and our response probably says something about us as a_people : How much should we forgive ? How much should we forget ?</TEXT>
