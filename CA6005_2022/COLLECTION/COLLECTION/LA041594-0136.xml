   <HEADLINE> A NEW DIRECTION ; * HARTMUT BITOMSKY , HIGHLY RESPECTED FOR DOCUMENTARY WORK IN GERMANY , BRINGS INTERNATIONAL FLAVOR TO CALARTS FILM PROGRAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first time Hartmut Bitomsky came_to America in 1980 , he went_to Atlantic_City , N . J. , paid $ 1 # 000 for a 1973 Chevy station_wagon and drove west to San Francisco . All along the way , Bitomsky , this distinguished documentary filmmaker from Germany , accompanied by a film crew of four , stopped and talked to Americans from different walks_of_life . After five months on_the_road during the year when Ronald Reagan was first elected President , he returned to his Berlin home to edit his curious encounters with Americans into the three-hour documentary , &quot; Highway 40 West. &quot; He had been commissioned to make the film for German television . Though he had never been to the United States before , Bitomsky had become familiar_with several aspects of its culture at an early age . &quot; In a way , belonging_to the generation after the war , in Europe , especially in Germany , you ' re in America all_the time , &quot; Bitomsky , 52 , said . &quot; After the war , American culture was present first with cinema , then the literature , then the music . So it grows on you , the curiosity , since you ' re always confronted with it . It ' s not your culture ; it ' s not your way of living ; but you experience it all_the time. &quot; When World_War_II ended , Bitomsky was a small boy living close to the airport in Bremen , which was occupied by the American military . &quot; Immediately after the war , they installed a cinema in one of these huge hangars , and every Sunday afternoon we kids were invited to see American films . And of course I went , &quot; he said . &quot; So right from the beginning I ' ve been exposed to American cinema. &quot; Now , he has an opportunity to influence it . Today , Hartmut Bitomsky is the dean of the School of Film / Video at California Institute of the Arts . Chosen for the job after CalArts conducted a two-year search , he arrived on the Valencia campus in October to run a department that encompasses experimental film and video , narrative and documentary video production , experimental animation and character animation . &quot; The first thing we look_for in a dean is the artistic quality of his or her own work , &quot; said CalArts President Steven Lavine . &quot; Hartmut as a filmmaker is as major an artist as has ever taught at CalArts . &quot; It ' s absolutely clear to me that he is a person of imagination and stubbornness . Stubbornness is a very important quality in a dean because you have to set your mind on what you want to accomplish and then just stick_with it , whatever the vicissitudes along the way . When you ' re with Hartmut , you ' re aware that he ' s in it for the long_haul . &quot; Beyond that , Hartmut has this broad range of experience . He brings an international perspective to the act of filmmaking . He is interested in both experimental work and in the best accomplishments of Hollywood and of commercial filmmaking . I think he ' ll bring a breadth of vision to our film school , which is very important because the film school itself is very diverse. &quot; In 1962 , after high_school , Bitomsky moved to Berlin to study theater and German literature at the Free University . The Berlin Wall had gone_up one year earlier . When the German Film and Television Academy opened in Berlin in 1966 , he enrolled . In 1968 , he was one of a group of students who occupied the school , renamed it for an old Soviet documentary filmmaker , and got expelled . In 1972 , he became co-editor of the magazine , Filmkritik , for which he wrote essays and reviews . About the same time , he established his own production company , Big Sky Films , making more_than 40 films including shorts , documentaries and dramatic features . Among the documentaries is a trilogy -- &quot; Images of German Pictures &quot; ( 1983 ) , &quot; Freeway &quot; ( 1986 ) and &quot; The VW Complex &quot; ( 1989 ) -- that incorporates clips from films shot during the Nazi era . The work investigates the history of labor in Germany since the 1930s and labor ' s connection to politics . Though his company_name sounds much like an homage to America ' s open spaces , the &quot; Sky &quot; actually represents the last syllable of his last_name . The &quot; Big &quot; is from his wife ' s name , Brigitte , who is known to friends as Biggie . &quot; And of course there ' s a film called ' Big Sky , ' which I love , &quot; he said . American movies are just one of many influences on his work . Other cinematic influences include filmmakers of the_French Nouvelle Vague ( New Wave ) such_as Jean-Luc Godard , and Italian neo-realist director Michelangelo Antonioni . Bitomsky was teaching and making films in Berlin when CalArts gave him a call . &quot; When they asked me for the first time if I would be a candidate for this position , I said no right away . I ' d been rather successful in what I was doing over there in Germany , and I could almost regularly make a film once a year , so I was doing pretty well . But doing pretty well is tricky , because you are satisfied , and I was in a way too secure . &quot; Suddenly something like this came_up , and almost like a thorn in your skin , I constantly thought_about it . After a while I said , ' Why , that ' s a big challenge which I guess won ' t be offered again in my lifetime , ' and I was pretty sure later I would n ' t be able to handle it anymore . In a way , it was the last chance to do something very different. &quot; At CalArts , he heads a department of almost 400 people , 320 of them students . &quot; that ' s a lot of administration , which I have to learn by doing_it , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m still learning . What I ' ve done so far is managing catastrophes. &quot; Since the Jan . 17 earthquake and subsequent aftershocks made_it impossible to conduct classes on CalArts ' Valencia campus , a makeshift film and video school has been set_up in a vacant Lockheed research_center in Rye Canyon . Bitomsky had been through one small jolt in Germany , &quot; but nothing of this scale , &quot; he said . &quot; This was a real initiation . What we didn ' t know in the beginning was the scenario of it . You see , we were expecting the end of the world after the very first shock . We thought , everything is standing , so this must be the beginning of it . It will get_worse and worse . &quot; My wife -- she was scared a lot in the beginning -- she said , ' Let ' s go_back to Germany . It ' s like California is a beautiful fruit from the outside , but in there , there ' s some evil . It ' s just the whole nature , which has some incredible evil depth which is calling_for you. ' &quot; For Bitomsky , it started &quot; to get adventurous , &quot; he said . &quot; In a way it intensifies your sensations . After a while this goes_back to the normal , and you start to miss it , this being excited all_the time . It ' s perhaps the same when you are making a film . You put so_much in it , and when it ' s finished , sometimes it seems there ' s no purpose anymore for your life because you can ' t start right away with a new project because you ' re much too exhausted . But you miss this kind of excitement and investing all your forces and imagination into one focused spot. &quot; Though no one seeks_out catastrophes , the earthquake gave Bitomsky &quot; a big chance to take a fast-forward look_into the mechanism of this place , &quot; he said , referring to the whole of CalArts . &quot; A lot of problems came from all directions at one time , and you had to be_on alert . So many things I would n ' t have discovered -- how things were linked to each other in the school . Nobody would tell me , since for everybody else , it was the normal way . So in a way I was benefiting from it. &quot; There are some benefits in the temporary campus as well . &quot; My school had been dispersed all_over the old campus . For the very first time , we are almost under one roof , &quot; he said . &quot; I think a_couple_of students have seen their dean for the very first time . So a very good atmosphere of belonging together has been created by that. &quot; And the earthquake has served as a catalyst for future improvements . &quot; We have had three different computer labs belonging_to different departments of the school , &quot; Bitomsky said . In the Lockheed facility , they had to put two of them together . &quot; To make_it short , I could convince all my program heads -- who had territorial considerations -- I could convince them for the future to form one big , very efficient computer lab making better use of our resources . This could happen only because we were here. &quot; Bitomsky likened his school to a &quot; huge tanker , and it takes time to give it just a slight new direction. &quot; &quot; You can ' t say , ' Here ' s the master_plan , now everybody has to fit into it. ' I ' ve seen a lot of people running film schools , coming there and trying to design everything . They failed because you deal with people , with structures . &quot; I rather see myself as somebody who ' s digging_out the talents which are there and giving them a certain direction . But that is more or less of a philosophical kind -- how to handle things , reflect on them -- than to set a completely different set of goals for the whole thing. &quot; This semester , he is teaching a documentary class . He plans to teach &quot; where I feel there is something missing , &quot; he said . &quot; I teach a documentary class since there is nobody else who is teaching this area . And I think although students might not be interested personally in this area , it ' s still a healthy experience . Knowing something about documentary_film could be something they will benefit from when they are making their own films . &quot; And I like teaching . I ' ll do_it not only to escape_from the administrative work , but because teaching is interesting . You always have to re-evaluate your position . Sometimes you meet some very old questions , which come_up all_the time , and every time there ' s something different to the question of students , and so it vivifies your own system of thinking. &quot; He also sees potential for development in other areas . &quot; A lot of filmmaking here is strictly experimental , and experimental and narrative filmmaking seem to be in opposition . I ' m astonished about that because there are a lot of highly advanced ways of telling stories , &quot; he said . &quot; The 20th Century is_full of writers who worked_on different ways of telling stories and tried to reveal all_the potential which is in narrative storytelling . &quot; But in cinema , it ' s still 19th Century concerning stories , always the same kind of structure . I think we can try to push narrative filmmaking in a different direction . &quot; What I would like to give_back is the knowledge that we could do much more with our tools , with our means of expression . The range of what our tools permit us to do is much wider than the actual use of them. &quot;</TEXT>
