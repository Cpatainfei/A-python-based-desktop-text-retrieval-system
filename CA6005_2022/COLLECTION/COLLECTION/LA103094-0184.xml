   <HEADLINE> CONVENIENCE OF EL TORO AIRPORT ASIDE , MANY QUESTIONS LINGER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The &quot; NIMBYites &quot; of Orange County would like to cast fear , confusion and negatives and have you believe having an international airport at El Toro is very non-beneficial . For me , the issue is clear and simple . Should I wish to take a nonstop_flight to the Orient or to Europe , would I rather travel_to LAX or El Toro ? Frankly , I ' ll choose El Toro . The runways are there . The business_community is ready to put_together the brains , energy and money to make_it a reality . Let ' s get_on_with it . Orange County needs a first-class international airport . Let ' s make_it happen . And incidentally , I own a property under the flight_path and have always been thrilled to see and hear a flight of Marine F-18 jets fly overhead . that ' s what this country is all about . Let ' s not fight progress . VICTOR H . JASHINSKI Newport Beach * The Times recently reported another &quot; easy decision &quot; by a North County city_council . This time the Placentia City_Council voted support for converting the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station to a commercial airport . It was not too long ago that the same council , in concert with the councils of Yorba Linda , Brea and Fullerton and others in North County , were in the fight against the same Orange County big-development interests -- now promoting the commercial airport at El Toro -- who were then trying to locate a major airport atop Chino Hills . The North County cities that now praise the economic benefits to themselves if El Toro becomes a commercial airport were rabid environmentalists then , crying about the deterioration of the quality of residential life in their cities . Their cries of anguish of &quot; not in my back yard &quot; were answered by pressure at the state level , and the Chino Hills airport location became the Chino Hills State Park . Now that the North County tears have dried and another back yard has been found for an airport far from their cities , the unthinkable airport is now a fine idea . In truth , the airport was a bad idea for the Chino Hills and the cities around it . A second county commercial airport is equally a bad idea fro El Toro and the surrounding cities . I hope the residents of North County cities have more sensitivity than their councils . SINCLAIR JONES Laguna Beach * Opinions vary on the need for El Toro to remain an airport , and the strongest views are held by those who are or might be affected by the air traffic . Since voters will be deciding the issue , they should realize that statements made by Irvine , Lake Forest , Mission Viejo , Laguna Hills and Newport Beach residents tend to be biased . Hopefully , we will have the advantage of deciding the issue on information put forth by unbiased experts who study the facts . ROBERT F . OLSON Anaheim * I would like to raise an issue which , to date , both the proponents and opponents of Measure A and the proposed El Toro airport have failed to address , and which constitutes what may be the greatest single expense to this county ' s taxpayers if a civilian airport ever arises on that site . For at least 20 years , California law has required that homeowners adversely affected by the noise of jet aircraft operations , particularly takeoffs and landings , be entitled to compensation from the airport owners and operators in the dollar amount of the diminution of their homes ' market_value caused by that noise . In light of the varied takeoff and landing patterns which would have to be used , there is probably not one community in Orange County south of and including Irvine that would not be adversely affected by the noise which a fully functioning civilian airport would generate . If nothing else , the issue certainly demonstrates why a complete study is needed before any irrevocable decisions on the airport are made , whether by the voters or by the governmental representatives charged with evaluating the issue . As for Measure A , as a resident of the Saddleback Valley and an attorney whose practice encompasses inverse condemnation issues , my own reactions are mixed . Although I view with alarm the prospect of the decimation of the values of my and my neighbors ' homes , and the degradation of the quality of our lives -- which a fully functioning airport would create -- I cannot but help be tempted by an initiative which , if passed , will amount to a lifetime full-employment act for me and a lot of my colleagues . ANDREW M . SUSSMAN Rancho Santa Margarita * Proponents of Measure A , the El Toro Airport Initiative , claimed that a commercial airport , preferably an international one , will be an economic panacea for Orange County . Yet , they have not been able to provide facts to substantiate their arguments on costs and revenues . More important , there is one major and crucial flaw in the arguments favoring a 4 # 700-acre airport facility as the only viable option for jobs and revenues . El Toro is surrounded by a 16 # 000-acre restricted area , designated as a safety and noise buffer zone , hailed by the proponents as minimizing environmental impacts to nearby residents . However , without an airport these 16 # 000 acres will be available for development ! Will even an additional development of 5 # 000 acres create more jobs and revenues ? You bet it will ! In fact , an El Toro airport may even have a detrimental impact on the economic development of Orange County . PAUL WILLEMS Laguna Niguel * Orange County voters have the opportunity to help revitalize the economy in our area . Allowing the El Toro base to be a commercial airport has the potential to create over 50 # 000 new jobs and generate billions in new economic activity . Unfortunately , too many businesses have left and others are leaving the county because we have over-regulated , over-taxed , and been insensitive to their needs . We must send a new message , and providing an additional airport that can meet their growing needs is a step_in the right direction . KATHY SMITH Costa Mesa</TEXT>
