   <HEADLINE> JURY ORDERS DEATH_PENALTY FOR SATTIEWHITE IN OXNARD KILLING ; COURTS : HE HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF SHOOTING A MOTHER OF FOUR . DEFENSE SOUGHT A LIFE TERM , CLAIMING THAT HE WAS ABUSED AND HAS THE MIND OF A CHILD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A jury Monday condemned a convicted Oxnard murderer to death for the fatal shooting of a 30-year-old mother of four . Christopher James Sattiewhite , 24 , becomes the eighth Ventura County defendant to face death in the gas_chamber since California reinstated capital_punishment in 1978 . Unlike previous court appearances in which he displayed little emotion , Sattiewhite seemed on the verge of crying after Superior_Court Judge Lawrence Storch announced the death verdict to the silence of a hushed courtroom . As tears welled in his eyes , he nervously tapped his fingers on the defense table and stroked his beard . Shaking his head in apparent disbelief , he rocked back and forth in his chair . After the proceeding , Sattiewhite remained glued to his chair as his attorneys tried to coax him to leave the courtroom . Lawyer Willard P . Wiksell later explained that his client , who was described in court as being childlike , was both astonished and frightened by the verdict . &quot; He doesn ' t want to die . He just doesn ' t want to go_to Death Row , &quot; Wiksell said . &quot; He ' s dejected and has lost hope. &quot; Sattiewhite eventually stood and walked to a holding cell , flashing a brief smile to a supporter in the courtroom ' s gallery before leaving . &quot; Justice was done , &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . Patricia M . Murphy declared . But Wiksell , visibly dejected himself , said he thought that the defense had provided the jury with adequate reason to spare Sattiewhite ' s life . &quot; I was very disappointed , &quot; Wiksell said later . &quot; I think there was a mitigating factor . There ' s no dispute that he has the mind of a 12-year-old. &quot; Sattiewhite shot Genoveva Gonzales in the head three times Jan . 26 , 1992 , and left her body in a drainage_ditch along Arnold Road in Oxnard . Investigators said the murder occurred after Sattiewhite inadvertently called_out the name of an accomplice who had kidnaped and raped Gonzales . The killing was necessary to prevent the woman from identifying her assailants , according to court testimony . Monday ' s verdict ended three days of deliberations for the jury , the same panel that convicted Sattiewhite of murder Feb . 24 . Just moments before voting to condemn the defendant , jurors heard a reading of the riveting testimony of a woman whom Sattiewhite had previously been convicted of raping . &quot; In our opinion , that was a key factor &quot; in the verdict , Murphy said , referring to Sattiewhite ' s being previously convicted of a violent crime . &quot; You ' re never happy when somebody is given the death_penalty , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Donald C . Glynn , co-prosecutor on the case . &quot; You are never happy when society has to impose its greatest penalty. &quot; But he said prosecutors are satisfied that they were able to avenge the Gonzales murder . Jurors refused to be interviewed and exited the courthouse through a back_door . Storch set sentencing April 25 . At that time , he will also rule on a defense motion to reduce the verdict to life in prison without the possibility of parole . Glynn said he expects Storch to uphold the verdict of death , noting that no Ventura County judge has ever reversed such a decision . Wiksell made the motion for the reduced verdict . &quot; Chris Sattiewhite will get a fair shake from Judge Storch , &quot; he said . The last Ventura County defendant to receive a verdict of death was former day-care aide Gregory Scott Smith . He was tried in October , 1991 , for killing 8-year-old Paul Bailly of Northridge and burning the boy ' s body . The county ' s next death_penalty trial is set Aug . 1 . Mark Scott Thornton will be tried_for last summer ' s slaying of Westlake nurse Kellie O ' Sullivan , who was killed after a carjacking , authorities said . Prosecutors have called the Gonzales murder one of the most senseless crimes to hit the area in a long_time . They told the jury that Sattiewhite is a &quot; vicious predator &quot; who acted_out a childhood fantasy when he killed the woman . Sattiewhite had told a psychologist that as a child , he often dreamed of killing for the thrill of seeing if he could get_away with it . Prosecutors also said Sattiewhite was a gang member who enjoyed carrying a gun and holding victims at_bay while they were raped by his friends . Defense_attorneys asked_for mercy , saying Sattiewhite is a former abused child who suffers from a lifelong brain defect and has problems distinguishing right from wrong . They argued that a sentence of life in prison was more_than adequate . They also said that due_to his mental defect , Sattiewhite was easily manipulated by accomplices in both the Gonzales rape-murder and the previous rape , which occurred at Oxnard Beach in September , 1991 . Defense_attorneys never minimized Gonzales ' death , saying their client committed a terrible crime . But they pointed_out that the victim had a drug conviction and claimed that she was a prostitute who was hoping to trade sex for drugs the day she died . On Monday , Wiksell wondered whether he should have used a less elaborate defense . &quot; If you only look_at the crime , it is a death_penalty case , &quot; he conceded . &quot; But if you look_at the crime and ( Sattiewhite ) , it ' s a life-in-prison case . Maybe I should have just told the jury that. &quot;</TEXT>
