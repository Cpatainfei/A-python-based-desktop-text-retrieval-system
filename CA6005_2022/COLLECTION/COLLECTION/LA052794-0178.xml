   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA LIFTS VEIL ON ELITE SHOCK TROOPS ; MILITARY : MEDIA GET TO SEE DREADED DZERZHINSKY DIVISION PUT ON A DEMONSTRATION AT ITS ONCE-SECRET BASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They were once the toughest , deadliest , scariest troops to police the Soviet Empire . Named after Felix Dzerzhinsky , founder of the Bolshevik secret_police , the Dzerzhinsky Division liquidated czarist sympathizers , worked_out the formula for the Molotov_cocktail and trained snipers to torment Hitler ' s armies . In the 1980s , the KGB unit did the Kremlin ' s bidding in such hot spots as Afghanistan , Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh . Last October , when hard-liners seized the Russian Parliament building , Boris N . Yeltsin called_in the Dzerzhinsky Division to storm the White_House and save his presidency . On Thursday , the gates of the elite division ' s base swung open_to journalists , and even foreign reporters were invited in_for what commanders said was the first-ever tour of this military holy site about 15 miles east of Moscow . In a bizarre marriage of Russian military propaganda and Western-style public relations , the once-terrifying special forces now seemed eager to show themselves to the media as a tough but politically correct unit of crime-fighters trained to battle terrorists , drug_traffickers , hijackers and organized criminals . With convincing displays of smoke_bombs and machine-gun fire , young commandos demonstrated their crime-busting prowess . First came a display of bulletproof_vests , helmets , rifles , pistols , grenade-launchers , stun bombs and tear_gas canisters . Then , as the television_cameras rolled , sharpshooters in camouflage burst into a firing_range . They pumped bullets straight into their target , a wooden terrorist who appeared to be commandeering a car , holding a gun to the driver ' s head . The shooters left holes in the terrorist , but the hostage escaped unscathed . Beefy recruits showed how to intercept and liberate a &quot; hijacked &quot; bus by posing as road repair workers . As if to demonstrate Russia ' s need for a squad of &quot; untouchables &quot; to deal with its skyrocketing crime , while the mock hijackings were being staged outside Moscow , a very real hijacking of schoolchildren had begun in southern Russia . Four gunmen seized a bus carrying about 30 people -- eight children , their parents and their schoolteachers -- near Mineralniye Vody , a resort city whose name means &quot; mineral waters. &quot; It was the second hijacking involving schoolchildren in five months . Last December , a dozen children from Rostov-on-Don were seized but released in exchange for $ 10 million and a helicopter . No one was hurt in that incident , and the hijackers were eventually caught , but not all_of the ransom_money was recovered . Authorities said Thursday that the new hijackers had also demanded $ 10 million , as well as 100 vials of morphine , assorted weaponry and a helicopter in which to flee . The terrorists threatened to toss one child ' s severed head out of the bus each hour until their demands were met , police said . By late Thursday , the terrorists had released all_the children and one adult in exchange for four submachine_guns , a grenade launcher , a night-vision device and some flak jackets , the Itar-Tass news_agency reported . About 13 adults were still being held . Two groups of elite Interior Ministry troops -- possibly from the ex-Dzerzhinsky Division -- were_on their way to the site , the news_agency said . As part of its transformation , the commando unit has dropped the name Dzerzhinsky and is now simply known as the Special Forces Division . But the nickname has stuck , and despite financial hardship it remains one of the most prestigious postings in the Russian military .</TEXT>
