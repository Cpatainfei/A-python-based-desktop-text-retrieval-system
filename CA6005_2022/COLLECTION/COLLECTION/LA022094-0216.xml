   <HEADLINE> POSTAL HEIST PROBE LEADS TO LATIN_AMERICA ; CRIME : THIEVES WOULD TAKE ENVELOPES FROM HOME MAIL BOXES AND LAUNDER ANY CHECKS THEY FOUND THROUGH FOREIGN BANKS . FIVE PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED IN JANUARY , BUT THAT DOES NOT SATISFY AT LEAST TWO ANGRY VICTIMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Carolyn Ditzian doesn ' t send mail from her house anymore -- she can ' t be sure who will cash her utility or tax payments . Her friend Ann Prochaska feels the same way . Both were victims of a scheme in which thousands of dollars worth of personal_checks were stolen from home mail boxes where they awaited pickup by mail_carriers , and then laundered through Latin_American banks . Though the women -- who live miles apart -- were eventually reimbursed by U.S. banks that processed the checks , they say the incident has convinced them the sanctity of the U.S. mail is a fallacy . &quot; I had to repay everybody until I was reimbursed , &quot; said Prochaska , of suburban Davie . Checks of hers worth $ 4 # 000 were stolen last February . &quot; I was just angry . I felt violated . I ' ve never had anybody rob the house , but it felt the same. &quot; Ditzian , who lost checks worth more_than $ 5 # 000 , including her property_tax payment , said that initially no one wanted to hear her story . &quot; The first time I called police , they didn ' t even take a report on it , &quot; said Ditzian , 62 , of Broward County . &quot; The post_office was absolutely no help at all. &quot; Not so , says Postal Inspector Henry Gutierrez , who infiltrated the scam . Federal_agents in January arrested five men , two from Argentina and three from Miami . All are charged with possession of stolen mail and could face 10 years in prison if convicted . Gutierrez said he identified the main check fence and said money-laundering charges are pending . &quot; There ' s still thieves down the line out there , &quot; Gutierrez said . &quot; But they have no way of laundering the money. &quot; Gutierrez said the men stole more_than 1 # 000 checks worth about $ 1 million -- ranging from a 25-cent highway toll fee to a $ 42 # 000 check , and including everything from utility payments to catalogue orders . The checks were then sold to middlemen who deposited them in bank_accounts opened under the names of fictitious businesses . The accounts were throughout Latin_America : Costa Rica , Brazil , Mexico , Guatemala , Bolivia , Peru , Argentina and Ecuador . &quot; We are talking_about a great number of banks as well as individuals , &quot; Gutierrez said . &quot; They ' d cash checks_in Costa Rica and then they moved_over to Mexico . Obviously , they were very active. &quot; In January , postal and Florida Department of Law_Enforcement agents intercepted a package , destined for Brazil , that contained more_than 100 stolen checks worth $ 400 # 000 . The scam took_advantage of lax banking laws in Latin_America that allowed accomplices to stamp the backs of the checks with official-looking endorsements for deposit , Gutierrez said . &quot; When you cash a check , you submit ID , but when you deposit a check you don ' t really look . . . . It ' s a big difference , &quot; he said . But he questions how these Latin_American banks could accept thousands of dollars of checks made_out to third_parties and not get suspicious . In the meantime , Ditzian and Prochaska both complain the Postal Service never returned their calls and they don ' t know if the five men arrested were the ones responsible_for lifting their mail . Ditzian said she had to pay about $ 500 in interest and penalties because her property_tax check never reached the county assessor . &quot; If you think these five are the end of it , it is not the end of it , &quot; she said . &quot; There are 25 more that have the same idea . . . and it ' s going_to continue. &quot;</TEXT>
