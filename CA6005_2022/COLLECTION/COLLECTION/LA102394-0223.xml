   <HEADLINE> BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN ; BIG NAMES TO TAKE THEIR CUTS IN ' 95</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Salary cap or not , major_league owners are squeezing the players financially . Call it checkbook diplomacy -- except that there is nothing very diplomatic about it . Clubs are trying to reduce their player payrolls by 20 % or more while flooding the free-agent market and avoiding arbitration . &quot; You can ' t sustain this type of financial impact and not have it result in a major impact on payroll , &quot; Dodger Executive_Vice_President Fred Claire said , echoing what owners ' negotiator Richard Ravitch has been saying throughout the sporadic bargaining negotiations . In other words : The system under which the players will or will not play in 1995 has yet to be determined , but the reaction to the economic impact of the strike and the anticipated impact on 1995 sales will go beyond a reduction of front-office and scouting staffs , reaching the dugout . The fact that clubs have already guaranteed $ 540 million to 168 players in 1995 as part of previously signed multiyear contracts plays into it , reducing financial flexibility . Only seven of the 28 clubs start the signing season with salary guarantees under $ 10 million . The San Francisco Giants , for example , have guaranteed more_than $ 20 million to Barry Bonds , Matt Williams , Mark Portugal and Robby Thompson . The Houston Astros have committed $ 21.95 million to five players ; the Texas_Rangers $ 15.85 million to three ; the Toronto Blue_Jays $ 32.3 million to seven . &quot; You ' re going to see more rookies and younger players in 1995 than ever before , &quot; Ravitch predicts , adding as part of his salary-cap sales pitch that he doesn ' t see how the union can continue to favor a system in which only 10 % of the players receive more_than 50 % of the compensation . The Dodgers , thanks to the rebirth of their farm system , had already resumed growing their own players and are continuing that process . &quot; It ' s not the driving force in our decision-making process , but you can ' t look_at this situation and not have the budget be a factor , &quot; Claire said . &quot; Our payroll will drop significantly. &quot; It was $ 37.1 million last year . The club could shed $ 10.55 million in 1994 salaries if none of seven free_agents are re-signed . Cory Snyder , Roger McDowell and Jim Gott definitely appear gone , taking $ 4.55 million in salary . Kevin Gross , who became a free_agent again when the Dodgers refused to offer arbitration as part of the repeater-rights process , may be re-signed , but not at his $ 2.7-million salary of 1994 . Center_fielder Brett Butler , $ 3.5 million , and third_baseman Tim Wallach , $ 3.3 million , are likely to return as insurance if Roger Cedeno and Ron Coomer are not ready -- &quot; We ' re going to be making important evaluations all winter , &quot; Claire said in reference_to the winter leagues -- but that will also depend_on the price of the Butler and Wallach premiums . There may be too_much emotion and , yes , loyalty , involved to let Orel Hershiser leave , but loyalty might not translate to his $ 3-million salary of ' 94 . &quot; We ' re fortunate to have so many young players arrive_at the same time , &quot; Claire said . &quot; We ' ve never had this much quality young talent. &quot; Not every club can make that boast , but most are pursuing that approach . There were 45 veteran players -- Gross being an example -- who lacked the five years necessary to repeat as free_agents but could do so if their clubs failed to offer arbitration by midnight Wednesday . Only two -- Chili Davis of the Angels and Darryl Strawberry of the San Francisco Giants -- were retained by the offer of arbitration . Some will be re-signed by their previous clubs , but at lower salaries than they were making and without the divisive and inflationary arbitration process . And many will not be re-signed . Among several illustrations is what could be a loyalty lesson for Hershiser . The Atlanta Braves uprooted third_baseman Terry Pendleton , their cornerstone of the ' 90s , and will replace him with Chipper Jones or Jose Oliva yielding a projected payroll cut of more_than $ 3 million . Similarly , there are very few options being exercised . The Oakland A ' s , for example , refused to pick_up the 1995 option on relief ace Dennis Eckersley at $ 4 million and will try to re-sign him as a free_agent for considerably less . The Philadelphia Phillies refused to pick_up options on reliever Doug Jones at $ 3.25 million or Pete Incaviglia at $ 1.2 million . There may be as_many as 200 free_agents diluting the market . A few , such_as Bill Swift , John Franco , Gregg Jefferies and Larry Walker , should do_well . So will Jack McDowell and Jim Abbott , providing the dispute over service time during the strike is resolved in their favor and they are ruled eligible for free_agency . Otherwise , many name players are likely to come_up empty . How ironic . As the owners continue to pursue a salary cap and new compensation system , they are now underscoring what the players have always tried to tell them : A free market will always react to economic_conditions and adjust itself . Particularly when sound financial policy and good management are used . AFFIRMATIVE_ACTION ? You may need a program to identify baseball ' s new managers and general_managers , but you won ' t need a color_chart . They ' re all white . Eight years after the Al Campanis incident generated a commitment to minority hiring , no minority holds the position of president or CEO and only one serves as a general_manager -- Bob Watson of Houston . There are four minority managers -- Montreal ' s Felipe Alou , San Francisco ' s Dusty Baker , Colorado ' s Don Baylor and Toronto ' s Cito Gaston -- but what there is of a commitment has largely been delivered at the administrative or non-decision-making level . Consider the last three months : -- The St . Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs hired new presidents -- Mark Lamping and Andy MacPhail , respectively . -- The Minnesota Twins promoted personnel director Terry Ryan to replace MacPhail as general_manager ; MacPhail hired New York Met vice_president Ed Lynch to replace Larry Himes as the Cubs ' general_manager ; Lamping hired Colorado assistant general_manager Walt Jocketty to replace the fired Dal Maxvill as Cardinal general_manager ; the Texas_Rangers fired Tom Grieve as general_manager and hired Baltimore ' s personnel director , Doug Melvin , and the Blue_Jays promoted assistant general_manager Gord Ash to replace retiring Pat Gillick . -- The Kansas City Royals fired manager Hal McRae ( who became the Cincinnati Reds ' hitting coach ) and hired Cincinnati coach Bob Boone ; the Orioles fired Johnny Oates and hired Cleveland pitching coach Phil Regan ; the Rangers fired Kevin Kennedy and hired Oates ; the Boston Red Sox fired Butch Hobson and hired Kennedy ; the Cubs fired Tom Trebelhorn and hired San Diego manager Jim Riggleman , leaving the Padres to hire third_base coach Bruce Bochy . that ' s a total of 13 key positions filled . And although there is no disputing the credentials of any of the new general_managers , or the loudly applauded appointment of the respected MacPhail to provide the Cubs with some long-absent stability and leadership , or the managerial potential of Regan and Boone at a time when the Red Sox and Rangers couldn ' t wait to recycle Kennedy and Oates , the absence of a minority in all_of it is glaringly conspicuous . &quot; It only illustrates again that we have to have more people in the pipeline so that there ' s a natural progression when the opportunities come_up , &quot; acting Commissioner Bud Selig said . Selig discussed the situation with league presidents Leonard Coleman and Gene Budig in Milwaukee on Monday . &quot; I ' m convinced that the clubs are sensitive to the issue and conscientious about it , &quot; he said . &quot; Our overall ( minority employment ) percentages have continued to go_up . Our last grade from Richard Lapchick ( a Northeastern University sociologist who rates various industries on their minority hiring ) was a B . &quot; At this point , we still have to do a better job of identifying people and getting them in the pipeline , as Bob Watson was . Do we have a ways to go ? Yes . Will we get there ? Yes. &quot; At the pace of the last three months ? Never .</TEXT>
