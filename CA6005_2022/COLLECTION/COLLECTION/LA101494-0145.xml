   <HEADLINE> LIFE AMONG THE NOBELITY ; FOR SOUTHLAND ' S LAUREATES , THE THRILL OF WINNING COMES IN SMALL WAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What becomes a Nobel laureate most ? A new Porsche ? A sailing yacht ? How about a trip around the world ? Not quite . A more modest and unusual legacy has awaited Southern California ' s Nobel Prize_winners -- a small fraternity that gained one member this week when USC chemistry professor George A . Olah claimed the world ' s top intellectual honor . For the handful of local men who have won the prize , the greatest thrills have come_in small ways -- such_as acquiring that new parking_space closer to the lab , buying a long-enduring wife a new watch or putting money away for the kids . They may be buffeted by demands for money , entreaties of friendship and speaking requests from around the world , but members of this rarefied company take greatest pride in how little their personal lives have changed . Their highest compliment for one another is that they are &quot; mature &quot; and that they have remained unsullied by the seductive allure of more wealth , power and acclaim . Not long after Caltech chemist Rudolph Marcus returned from Stockholm in 1992 with the Nobel Prize for chemistry , for instance , a colleague saw him parking his car in a newly painted space not far from his office . &quot; Rudy said to me , ' Well , the Nobel Prize has to be worth something , ' &quot; recalled Stephen Mayo , a Caltech assistant_professor of biology . Indeed , Marcus still walks to work most days from his home just off the Pasadena campus . He still drives a clunky 1978 Oldsmobile . And he reports proudly that when his wife , Laura , met King Carl Gustav XVI , she was wearing a homemade dress . Most of his $ 1.2 million in winnings is invested , or in the bank . He notes , in fact , that the prize had lost 20 % of its value by the time he received his check , because of a rapid devaluation of the Swedish_krona . Around the Caltech campus , Marcus remains so unchanged and so focused on his study of energy storage that one colleague quipped that he &quot; must have spent his million dollars on a new sweater. &quot; Said Marcus : &quot; It ' s best if one doesn ' t think too_much about prizes and things . That puts the focus in the wrong place , which should be_on your work . . . on a particular problem and how you should solve it. &quot; Nonetheless , he has been forced to hire a second secretary to handle the flood of speaking requests and other obligations . The oddest request he has encountered came from a murder mystery writer who wanted to use Marcus ' name for a book character . &quot; I didn ' t see the point , &quot; Marcus said . The demands are so intense , at times , that Marcus has resolved to get better at saying &quot; no. &quot; &quot; The big question you have to answer is whether you want to turn_into a traveling salesman , or whether to use your time to produce something valuable and something new , &quot; Marcus said . UCLA ' s Donald Cram has much the same philosophy , loathing the tendency of some Nobel Prize_winners to leave their scientific roots and wander off in other directions . He views the late Linus Pauling as something of a &quot; fallen angel &quot; for leaving the work that brought him a Nobel Prize in chemistry to promote , among other things , world peace and the curative values of vitamin_C . &quot; I have looked_on the Nobel Prize as an opportunity to do more of what I enjoy and what I am good at , and that is science , &quot; said Cram , who received the honor in 1987 for his work in chemistry . &quot; That is the central core of my life. &quot; The 75-year-old scientist -- whose colorful bow_ties and guitar concerts are legend at UCLA -- said that most of the time it is easy to remain true_to that central core . It didn ' t take him long , for instance , to reject a strange offer from a Korean newspaper association . The group wanted him to join a team of Nobel Prize_winners to rewrite the Ten Commandments . &quot; Something just didn ' t fit there , &quot; Cram said , laughing . Cram ' s $ 180 # 000 prize was not as large as those of others in the last few years , partly because he shared the chemistry award with two others . Prizes also have increased substantially as the bequest of Alfred Nobel has become more valuable . Not that Cram hasn ' t put the money to good use . The professor this year bought a home overlooking Orange County ' s Monarch Bay partly with his prize_money . From there , he can see as far as the San Onofre coastline where he has surfed for 40 years . But Cram insists that the prize ' s value goes_far beyond the money . He doesn ' t have to teach classes anymore , he can more easily attract grants for his research , and new colleagues are lured from all_over the world to join his research team . &quot; It has extended my scientific life , &quot; Cram said . And Cram said the award has brought long-overdue recognition to his wife and longtime collaborator , Jane . Cram also used the award money to act_on a long-delayed urge to buy his wife a gold watch , although he laughingly admits he sought_out the best buy he could . &quot; I was raised in Vermont , &quot; Cram said . &quot; Money doesn ' t circulate very frequently in New England. &quot; The area ' s third and senior surviving laureate is 1983 physics prize_winner William A . Fowler , who , like Marcus , lives within walking distance of the Caltech campus where he worked for many years . Now a professor emeritus , he gave two-thirds of his award to two daughters and invested the rest . By the time he was awarded the prize , he already had retired , and a bad back and other ailments have since caused him to give_up the lecture circuit . But Fowler still likes to stay in the game . His Nobel status allows him to keep an assistant on campus who comes_to his Pasadena home each afternoon to retrieve and type his letters and to deliver the latest research papers . The 83-year-old notes that a new field of nuclear study has opened_up recently and that he still has a_few ideas floating around . &quot; I ' m still hoping to get a second one , &quot; he said , chuckling . &quot; You never know. &quot;</TEXT>
