   <HEADLINE> COLOSIO ' S KILLER ACTED ALONE , REPORT FINDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The chief investigator in the assassination of Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio said Tuesday the evidence shows that the gunman planned the killing alone and there was no conspiracy . Deputy Atty . Gen . Miguel Montes Garcia said in a statement that the confessed gunman in custody , Mario Aburto Martinez , was &quot; the material and intellectual author of the homicide. &quot; He said Aburto had a political motivation . &quot; It is possible to offer substantial conclusions , given that it has been demonstrated that Mario Aburto is the material and intellectual author of the homicide . . . and that , in carrying_out the homicide , he acted alone , &quot; the statement said . The finding marks a full retreat from the conspiracy theory initially put_forward by the attorney_general ' s office . In addition to Aburto , three men who attended the March 23 rally in Tijuana where Colosio was gunned_down remain in custody . They were held_in connection with the murder but are expected to be released shortly . Montes ' office previously said that new witness testimony and expert analyses of the videotapes of the shooting had weakened the case for a conspiracy , but human_rights activists and others were skeptical of that claim . Montes ' office said Aburto ' s writings showed a political motivation for the crime . In a confession made immediately after the shooting , Aburto insinuated that he had co-conspirators . According to a Mexican official , the accused assassin told interrogators , &quot; If you knew who else was involved , you ' d be surprised. &quot; But Aburto said he was not helped by the three men now being held .</TEXT>
