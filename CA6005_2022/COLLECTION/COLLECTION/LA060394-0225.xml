   <TEXT> Ask sixth-graders here about Japanese comic_books , and their eyes light_up . Slam Dunk , a macho basketball_player , is hot , says one boy . So are Dragon Ball , a futuristic space warrior , and Dr. Slump , a mad scientist who designed the perfect robot girl . Japanese comics deliver the ultimate in thrills , chills and &quot; interesting stuff with girls , like nakedness , &quot; he said . &quot; We all like Japanese comics better , because Korean comics are too sissy. &quot; That is exactly what worries Kwag Young Jin , a Ministry of Culture bureaucrat , and other officials . Bootleg Japanese comics may be runaway hits , they say , but the violence and sex rampant in them are twisting young Korean minds . Likewise , they predict , if samurai movies were freely shown , violence would increase as people imitate the slashing warriors . To hear Korean officials tell it , all that stands between their refined Land of Morning Calm and a hellish descent into Japanese cultural vulgarity is an import ban on Japanese movies , music , videos and other forms of pop culture . The ban was adopted in 1945 , after South_Korea was freed from 35 years of Japan ' s repressive colonial rule . It remains the most prominent symbol of the lingering sense of han , or bitter resentment , that many Koreans still feel toward the Japanese . ( Korean officials acknowledge the ban also protects their media markets from well-financed Japanese competitors. ) But the long-entrenched prohibitions may soon be lifted . Earlier this year , President Kim Young Sam broke the taboo and pushed Korea closer to reconciliation with its erstwhile enemy by declaring in a goodwill gesture that the ban should be ended . Saying it conflicts with global trends toward open markets , Kim ordered the Ministry of Culture to review how and when this should be done . The review is expected to be finished this month . At issue , however , is far more_than whether Koreans will get_to see samurai slasher flicks or Dragon Ball videos . The ban reflects what Kwag called the Korean people ' s &quot; complex feelings of jealousy , contempt and hatred all mixed together &quot; toward Japan . It has become a lightning_rod for centuries of accumulated grievances : Claims that Japan robbed Korea of cultural treasures in raids of priceless art and decimated its national identity by forcing Koreans to adopt Japanese customs , language and names during the colonial period . To make matters worse , they say , Japan still refuses to acknowledge adequately its cultural debt to Korea . Scholars say that Koreans introduced everything from the tea ceremony and flower arranging to temple architecture and kabuki during waves of migration to Japan beginning in the 4th Century . Some even claim that Japan ' s indigenous religion , Shintoism , stemmed from Korea ' s shamanism and that the Imperial family originated from Korean aristocrats in Japan . ( Most Japanese authorities reject that view. ) Against this backdrop of bitterness , talk_of Slam Dunk and Dr. Slump provokes withering looks . &quot; The teacher was hurt by his student in a barbaric way , &quot; said Kwag . &quot; Our pride was hurt . This feeling will not go_away soon. &quot; Admitting it is flagrantly ignored , he added : &quot; We don ' t think this import ban means much . But we need something to remind the Japanese that they need to frankly admit their acts and do something to comfort Koreans. &quot; Such attitudes perplex many Japanese . Although they understand the emotion and feel a sense of guilt , many wonder what they can do about it today and why Koreans cling_to hatreds half a century after the colonial period . For their part , a growing number of Japanese scholars are starting to acknowledge Korean influence on Japan ' s culture . However , many view Korea largely as a bridge through which Chinese culture passed to Japan . The tea ceremony , for instance , originated_in China and was introduced by Korea to Japan . Some Japanese scholars still challenge claims that culture flowed to Japan . Korean archeologists recently unearthed ancient clay figures used in burial rites identical to those found in Japan , a find they say adds_to evidence that Japanese tombs are heavily influenced by Korean traditions . Yet Inokuma Kanekatsu , head of the National Institute for Nara Cultural Heritage , said the discovery showed that &quot; culture cultivated by the Japanese flowed back into the Korean peninsula. &quot; And Japanese authorities are impeding research into the roots of the imperial family by preventing the royal tombs from being opened_to scholars . Since many tombs predate Japan ' s written history , which began in the 7th Century , they could provide priceless clues about Japan ' s murky origins and the assertion that early emperors were from Korea . Japan , after defeating Russia and China in wars over control of Korea at the turn_of_the_century , colonized the nation from 1910 until its 1945 defeat in World_War_II . Officially , Japan and South_Korea resolved most issues when they re-established diplomatic ties_in 1965 . Japan compensated Korea for colonization and gave economic development aid , guaranteed certain rights for Korean residents in Japan and returned 1 # 326 cultural properties such_as pottery , temple paintings and statues . Since then , they have signed other agreements , ranging from technology transfers to greater rights for the estimated 700 # 000 Koreans in Japan , many of whom were conscripted as laborers in the 1930s and ' 40s . But each time an issue is settled , Japanese officials say , new ones surface , such_as Japan ' s use of Korean women as sex slaves during World_War_II . Or old issues fail to fade_away : Despite the 1965 treaty legally settling the_matter , some Koreans are pushing for further surveys to determine just how many priceless ceramics and temple artworks were expropriated to Japan . Beginning with 13th-Century pirate raids , stretching to warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi ' s 1592 invasion and later to colonial rule , tens of thousands of treasures were said to be taken , turning_up in such places as Tenri University near Kyoto and the Museum of Oriental Art in Osaka , said Shin Yong Ha , a social_sciences professor at Seoul National University . The recent record-shattering sale of a 15th-Century Korean porcelain dish for $ 3 million at Christie ' s in New York deepened resentment . Only two similar dishes are known to exist -- and both are in museums in Japan . Despite the passage of time , the Korean sense of han still comes_up at surprising times . Etsuo Miyoshi , a Shikoku island glove maker , decided to close his factory in Korea in 1989 because rising labor rates made_it unprofitable . Korean labor activists protested at his Shikoku headquarters , coming_by the busloads from nearby Osaka . &quot; They said : ' You occupied us for 35 years ! This is a historical problem ! ' I couldn ' t say anything , &quot; Miyoshi recalled . Japanese officials were likewise startled when then-Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visited South_Korea in 1992 . He was told by then-President Roh Tae Woo that Japan was obliged to provide economic assistance because it was better_off than Korea , which was having hard_times . The meeting eventually resulted in the establishment of a joint foundation for scientific and technical cooperation , and a package to promote Korean exports in Japan . Still , Roh ' s logic was lost on many Japanese . &quot; Probably a lot of Japanese couldn ' t understand this . Economic relations and private business are not like an older brother helping a younger brother , &quot; said a Japanese Foreign Ministry official . &quot; If it ' s profitable , they ' ll do_it . If it ' s not , they won ' t. &quot; Katsuhiro Kuroda , dean of Japanese correspondents in Seoul as the Sankei Shimbun ' s bureau chief , said the resentment toward Japan may be a form of &quot; self-confirmation &quot; for Koreans . &quot; Perhaps because Korea was constantly invaded from long ago , they can unite themselves &quot; by harboring collective grudges against an external enemy , Kuroda said . &quot; It is not necessary for we Japanese to get excited about it. &quot; Some Koreans agree . Lee Jan Soo , a popular producer with the Seoul Broadcasting Station , is airing a 16-part series , &quot; The Ghost Is Going , &quot; that examines what he argues is a basic lack of identity among Koreans . He asserts that a true national identity has not been allowed to bloom under the overwhelming influence of Chinese culture , which Korea absorbed as a vassal state until the late 19th Century , the Japanese colonization , and today ' s hybrid of Japanese and Western pop culture . The series aims its barbs not only at the Japanese , but also at Koreans who slavishly imitate their ads , TV_shows and fashions . &quot; It is not important to assert that Japanese culture is actually Korean culture , &quot; Lee said . &quot; What we need to do is rediscover Korean identity. &quot; He says Korean identity is so diluted that the first page of middle-school textbooks reads : &quot; Contribute to the common prosperity of humankind. &quot; In Germany , the textbooks say : &quot; Be a good German , &quot; he said . Asked what , exactly , represents Korean culture , Lee falters . Maybe arirang , the traditional folk_song , he muses . Or hanbok , the brightly colored traditional woman ' s dress . Yet Lee and others lament that such culture is not widely known outside Korea . &quot; We need to be assertive , &quot; he said . That is precisely Kim ' s aim as he nudges his nation to lift the ban and put old grudges behind . Thanks to a generational shift , increasing economic ties and new political overtures between Kim and Japan ' s coalition government , a growing number of Koreans seem ready to mend fences . In a February poll by the Federation of Korean Arts and Culture , 4 % said the culture ban should be retained , 48 % said it should be lifted eventually and 15 % said it should be abolished immediately . Ten years ago , officials say , the very mention of lifting the ban was taboo . Koreans also are showing new attitudes on another hot_issue : Whether to demolish the Japanese colonial headquarters in Seoul , as Kim has proposed , or preserve its historical and architectural legacy . Just three years ago , when a Korean architect protested the demolition on TV , he was bombarded with hate mail and phone_calls . But in February , four of Korea ' s leading architects said the building should be preserved , both to memorialize the colonial experience and to protect the ornate , Renaissance-style architecture -- the best remaining example of it in Asia . Many Koreans seemed to agree : About 56 % of those asked_in 1992 by Korea Survey Gallup said it should not be destroyed . When Masatoshi Muto , political counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul , was in Korea 20 years ago , he said people could not tell their relatives they were studying Japanese and camouflaged their textbooks . Today , Japanese is the second fastest-growing foreign language in colleges , after Chinese ; Japan ' s economic might is seen as the key reason . At a major bookstore in downtown Seoul , clerk Hwang Pan Keun said demand for Japanese-language books is growing about 15 % each year , especially on economics and Korea-Japan relations . One recent customer was Lee Kyong Hwa , a graduate_student in Japanese at Hanguk University . She said she took_up Japanese because it was closer in structure to Korean than other Asian languages and would probably be easier to master . &quot; It ' s absolutely accepted these days , &quot; she said , as she browsed through Japanese dictionaries . &quot; I teach Japanese part-time , and the students are sincere and very enthusiastic. &quot; The study of Korean is also growing in popularity in Japan . As the ethnic boom proceeds apace , sparking more interest in Asian culture , promoters recently held the first Korean film festival , and Korean singers are mainstays on televised Japanese music shows . Travel between the nations has boomed since the Roh administration liberalized foreign travel about five years ago . The number of Koreans going_to Japan has increased from 158 # 000 in 1987 to 800 # 000 in 1993 ; Japanese going to Korea from 708 # 000 in 1987 to 1.3 million in 1993 , the Japanese government says . The Korean government has also initiated more cultural exchanges through the Korea Foundation , offering fellowships and funding for Korean studies programs at Japanese universities . Last year , the Korea-Japan Forum brought_together opinion leaders in both countries for the first time , modeled after the Shimoda Conference for U.S.-Japan experts . Meanwhile , an estimated 1 million households pull_down Japanese TV broadcasts via the NHK Network satellite -- largely without paying the requisite fees and sometimes illegally copying the programs for_sale to local video stores . About 10 # 000 young Korean women buy the Japanese fashion magazine Nonno , which is legally distributed in South_Korea , according to SNU professor Shin . Just as Japan absorbed Chinese culture through Korea centuries ago , Koreans are absorbing Western culture through Japan today -- imitating everything from Japanized grunge fashions and torn jeans to henna-dyed hair . And then there are the ubiquitous comic_books . About 200 kinds command 70 % of the market , most of them pirated . But even as sixth-graders snap them up , they do not forget their lessons in political correctness . &quot; Japan is a bad country , &quot; said Song Ju Hwan , a sixth-grader at Kwan Ak Primary_School in Seoul . &quot; They attacked Korea and beat Koreans in older days . I ' m going_to strike them back ! &quot; she added , with a rambunctious punch_in the air . Indeed , Korea-Japan ties continue to have their bad moments . One of the hottest best-sellers is &quot; Japan Is Nothing , &quot; by Chon Yo Ok , a former Tokyo correspondent for the Korean Broadcasting System . The book castigates everything from Japan ' s cramped homes to its sexism and racism to its &quot; infantile &quot; culture . Judging from casual interviews , a fair number of Koreans have read it and shifted their image of Japan from bad to worse . &quot; Underneath the economic might , there is a_people whose history is dirty , whose culture infantile and who are discontented and twisted , &quot; Chon writes . &quot; Koreans and Japanese may look alike , but they are a world apart. &quot; But , in_general , Muto and others say the long and uneasy relationship between the two peoples is_on the mend . Lee Young Hee and Kim Duk Soo are two reasons why . Lee writes a widely read newspaper_column and has written several books , all devoted to interpreting the Japanese collection of classic poems known as the Manyoshu using ancient Korean . Through her work , she has solved the riddle of previously unclear passages and uncovered the common roots of both peoples . Her following is strong in Japan as well , where she enjoys a 2 # 000-member supporters group . She has received more_than 5 # 000 letters expressing both surprise and appreciation for revealing the ancient Korean link to Japan . Kim is a noted master of the traditional Korean drum . Founder of the Samulnori drum group , he was an early influence on Japan ' s world-famous taiko group , Kodo , and travels_to Japan each year to share and teach his music at a training camp in the mountains of Nagano prefecture . More_than government decrees or official forums , it is through the deep rhythms of a common musical heritage that Koreans and Japanese can heal the lingering han and , at long last , make_peace , he says . &quot; When we are singing our songs , no one knows whether the origin is Korean or Japanese , &quot; Kim said . &quot; What is certain is that the rhythms and feelings between us are exactly the same. &quot; Researcher Chi Jung Nam of the Times Seoul Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
