   <TEXT> An inadvertent kick_in the buns : Let ' s begin by apologizing to the Weinermobile . ( What a way to start the day. ) As you might recall , we reported that one of Oscar Mayer ' s motorized frankfurters had been spotted on the Harbor Freeway , receiving a ticket from a Highway Patrol officer . But Weinermobile pilot Denise Schroeck phoned to say the officer was only giving her a warning . &quot; We didn ' t have our front license_plate on , &quot; she explained . And was she relieved . &quot; We thought we were in a real . . . . &quot; No , Schroeck , don ' t say it . . . . &quot; A real pickle. &quot; We ' re getting indigestion . Up to no good : Former state Sen . Paul Carpenter ' s apparent flight from the country to avoid a jail sentence prompted Thomas Pleasure to recall the colorful story of a Venice city official who went_on the lam . Yes , Venice was once a city . The fugitive was City Treasurer James Peasgood , whose downfall began when an independent audit of the city ' s near-bankrupt government was ordered in 1923 . Peasgood was soon reported &quot; overdue on a fishing vacation to Oxnard , &quot; historian Jeffrey Stanton wrote . Suspicious authorities &quot; opened his safe deposit_box and found $ 28 # 500 in securities. &quot; Peasgood surrendered and confessed to embezzling &quot; to supplement his $ 135-per-month salary and pay his gambling losses , &quot; Stanton wrote . An audit found $ 19 # 000 missing and he was sent_away to San Quentin . Peasgood is memorialized in Pleasure ' s 1994 Venice of America historical calendar . And why not ? Dissatisfied with officials such_as him , Venetians voted_in 1925 to become a part of L.A. , skateboard paths and all . * Chimney heap : &quot; What better way to rebound from the quake than through humor ? &quot; writes Peggy Edwards of Valencia , who lost the front wall of her house , including the chimney . Edwards has been carrying around two cheery items in her briefcase . One was an Only in L.A. photo of a sign outside a flattened home that said , &quot; We Should Have Used Lego ! &quot; The other , which she sent to us , was a flyer left on her doorstep the day of the quake . It said : &quot; $ 39 Special for a Chimney Sweep . . . Joseph Perez ' s Top_Hat Chimney Service. &quot; Edwards phoned the company and found_out that it also performs chimney inspections . &quot; I told them if they inspected a little closer , &quot; she said , &quot; they ' d find there was no chimney. &quot; * Now just a second . . . June Lockhart of Santa Monica found what would have made the ideal Valentine ' s Day revenge gift for an ex-lover -- the Personal-Life Clock , which displays &quot; the time ( as well as ) the number of hours , minutes and seconds remaining in your statistical lifetime . . . . &quot; * Otherwise it ' s hard to operate a cash_register : Will Harriss noticed that the classified section of UCLA ' s Daily Bruin advertised an opening for a manager of an espresso bar . &quot; Responsible , punctual and quality , &quot; it said . &quot; Conscious ( sic ) a big plus. &quot; miscelLAny : Did the earthquake knock the post_office ' s vending_machines out of whack ? Stanley Blumenthal of Sherman Oaks noticed that he has been receiving strange coins in his change . It turns_out the new machines were designed to dispense the unpopular Susan B . Anthony dollars , which the government has been trying to circulate for two decades .</TEXT>
