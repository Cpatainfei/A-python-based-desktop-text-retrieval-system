   <HEADLINE> UNIONS SUPPORT LIFTING OF OIL EXPORT BAN ; ENERGY : BRITISH PETROLEUM AGREES TO USE U.S. TANKERS TO MOVE ALASKAN CRUDE . DEAL CONTINGENT ON CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Five key U.S. maritime unions formally agreed Friday to support lifting a federal ban on the export of Alaskan crude_oil in a deal worked_out with British Petroleum Co . Breaking its silence , BP confirmed that it has agreed to preserve union jobs by using U.S.-flag tankers to ship any BP oil &quot; that moves off the Alaskan North Slope , &quot; said Rob Rehg , a spokesman for the London-based oil_company . The agreement is contingent_on Congress adding the lifting of the ban to a pending bill that would extend the Export Administration Act . Though opposition remains among lawmakers , proponents were optimistic Friday . &quot; It doesn ' t make_it a done deal , but it certainly makes_it a viable deal , &quot; one congressional source said . &quot; If the maritime unions really get_behind this , they can sway a lot of Congress members . . . . And then if you get a good ( Energy_Department ) study that says it ' s not going_to affect national energy concerns , then there ' s no legitimate argument for the ban. &quot; A still-unreleased Energy_Department report on the costs and benefits of lifting the ban estimates that as_many as 494 maritime industry jobs could be lost in 1994-95 if the ban were ended without a provision requiring the crude to be transported on U.S.-flag ships . Otherwise , the study supports proponents ' estimates that thousands of new oil field jobs -- and a substantial increase in investment in California and Alaskan production -- would result from lifting the ban . Though many high-ranking members of the Clinton_Administration favor lifting the ban , the White_House is not likely to take a formal stand on the issue until after the release of the Energy_Department report , expected June 7 . In a statement made available to The Times on Friday , executives of the Seafarers International Union ; National Maritime Union ; American Maritime Officers ; International_Organization of Masters , Mates &amp; Pilots , Marine_Engineers Beneficial Assn . ended two decades of insistence on preserving the ban , declaring that lifting it will create jobs and ensure the existence of a U.S. tanker fleet -- &quot; vessels that are militarily useful in times of conflict. &quot; California ' s independent oil producers and other opponents of the ban have argued that it forces too_much crude into the California market , depressing the regional price .</TEXT>
