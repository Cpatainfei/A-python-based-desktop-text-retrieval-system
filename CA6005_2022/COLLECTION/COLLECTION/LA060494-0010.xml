   <HEADLINE> ELECTIONS ; PROTESTERS TAKE_AIM AT MEXICAN ROSTER ; RULING PARTY ' S CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES HAVE LITTLE POPULAR SUPPORT . SOME WORRY DISGRUNTLED ACTIVISTS WILL DEFECT IN THE AUGUST VOTE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bracing for a long throw , the young_man in the print shirt drew his arm back and let_fly an egg . The crowd behind him cheered as yolk splattered across the district offices of the Institutional Revolutionary Party that has ruled Mexico for 65 years . No party faithful rushed_out to stop the vandalism ; the egg-thrower and his cheering section are party faithful . They were sullying their own headquarters to protest the selection of labor boss Carlos Aceves as candidate for federal deputy in their district . They supported a different local leader . Across Mexico , grass-roots activists have blocked streets and roads , occupied party offices and resigned from the PRI , as the governing party is known , in protest over the congressional candidate roster for the Aug . 21 federal elections . Officially , party leaders pass_off the protests as signs of healthy competition . But privately , some PRI members worry that disappointed rank-and-file activists may stay_away_from the polls in protest or even vote for the opposition . &quot; Face it , &quot; one longtime party member said . &quot; They picked some really bad candidates this time. &quot; In too many districts , he said , candidates have influence inside the PRI because of their ties to labor_unions , farm groups and party leaders , but they have little popular recognition , much less support . Getting them elected will be tough . Beyond the quality of the candidates , the protests reflect conflicts over the selection process and the PRI ' s identity as a party . Traditionally , the PRI is made_up of three groups : labor_unions , peasant farmers and a nebulous &quot; popular sector. &quot; The party also has a parallel regional structure of municipal- and state-level activists . Candidate selection is a power struggle among those groups . The popular sector and regional groups press for a more openly democratic selection process that favors local leaders who will represent each district ' s interests . Unions and farmers press for their quotas of congressional seats to look_after their interests . Those seats are usually assigned by the party leadership , often ignoring the wishes of grass-roots activists . This month , dozens of those activists refused to be ignored . Breaking party discipline , those &quot; natural leaders , &quot; as they called themselves , registered their candidacies at party headquarters , even though they had not received the nod from higher-ups . That forced a vote at their local conventions instead of the usual selection by unanimous acclaim . Getting union and farm candidates approved by local convention delegates in the face of competition required fancy footwork in some cases . A lexicon of dirty tricks that has grown_up around election_fraud came_into play . There is &quot; the crazy mouse , &quot; changing the location of a convention at the last minute without advising delegates ; madruguete , changing the time ; and acarreo , bringing_in outsiders to vote as delegates . Mexican newspapers published accusations of -- and in some cases documented -- the use of each of those tricks during local party conventions this month . Some grass-roots activists tried preemptive strikes , such_as taking_over party offices . After the egg-throwing did not persuade party leaders that they were serious , members of the Independent Popular Organization invaded district headquarters to prevent the local convention . As pressure grew , some labor candidates stepped_down in favor of local candidates . Party leaders tried to calm protests by offering disappointed candidates congressional seats as party representatives -- offices that are distributed after the election based on the percentage of votes each party receives . But for many , consolation prizes were not enough . Emilio Serrano , president of the Neighbors Committee of Iztacalco , a Mexico_City borough , resigned from the PRI after losing the party nomination for city assemblyman . &quot; Other parties have offered me a candidacy , particularly the PRD , &quot; he explained , referring to the Democratic Revolutionary Party , whose leadership includes former PRI activists . Serrano may be disappointed with that party as well . &quot; None of us can be completely happy with the way our candidates were chosen , &quot; PRD Chairman Porfirio Munoz Ledo acknowledged at a swearing-in ceremony for those candidates . He proposed &quot; re-founding &quot; the party to better ensure respect for democratic ideals .</TEXT>
