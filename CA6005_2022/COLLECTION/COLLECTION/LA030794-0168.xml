   <HEADLINE> SPIELBERG ' S ' LIST ' A CALL TO ' DUTY ' ; MOVIES : HOLOCAUST FILM ' WAS A STORY THAT NEEDED TO BE TOLD , ' DGA AWARD WINNER SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; It ' s a surprise , &quot; said Clint Eastwood , joking with the crowd as he opened the envelope and read &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; It was exactly the title that almost everyone at the Directors Guild of America ' s dinner Saturday night expected would be announced , as the Steven Spielberg epic drama about the Holocaust continues to sweep this season ' s film prizes on an uninterrupted march to the Oscars , two weeks from tonight . In a voice filled with emotion , Spielberg said the film &quot; was my duty to make , as a filmmaker and a Jew . It was a story that needed to be told simply because the generations forget and every new generation needs to face their past all_over again. &quot; The film is the true story of Oskar Schindler , a member of the Nazi_Party and a World_War_II industrialist , who saved more_than 1 # 100 Polish Jews by convincing the Nazis it would be more cost-effective to employ them than to kill them . &quot; I didn ' t ever think that film could be powerful enough to reach beyond the popcorn barrel and get people to change the way they think_about the world , &quot; said Spielberg , the director of the two all-time top grossing movies , &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; and &quot; E.T. -- The Extraterrestrial. &quot; &quot; I always sort of left that to the novelists , the essay writers , the professors . I had no idea that a film could be made that would allow people into a subject which is profoundly horrific and they come_away saying , ' I just didn ' t know it was that bad. ' &quot; Spielberg ' s guild award was his second . The first was for 1985 ' s &quot; The Color Purple. &quot; He has been nominated five other times . &quot; This is the seventh one , &quot; Spielberg said . &quot; This is the best one. &quot; &quot; I keep hugging this ( gold plaque ) . I ' m going_to take it to bed with me tonight. &quot; And he quickly added : &quot; and my wife , Katie. &quot; Spielberg won the prize over Jane Campion , nominated for &quot; The Piano , &quot; Andrew Davis for &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; James Ivory for &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; and Martin Scorsese for &quot; The Age of Innocence. &quot; Although Spielberg is the world ' s most commercially successful filmmaker , his directing has never been recognized by the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences with its Oscar award . He was nominated for &quot; Close Encounters of the Third Kind , &quot; &quot; Raiders of the Lost Ark &quot; and &quot; E.T. &quot; But this year seems different . &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; has won Golden Globes and critics ' honors . It is nominated for 12 Academy Awards . And now that Spielberg has won the Directors Guild honor , history favors him to take_home Oscars . Only three times since the guild began giving awards in 1949 has the winner of the guild ' s prize failed to also win the Oscar for direction . More often than not , the Academy gives the Oscar for best picture to their best director winner . One of the exceptions , however , is sure to give &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; backers pause . In 1985 , Spielberg won the guild award for directing &quot; The Color Purple. &quot; He and the movie were nominated in 11 Oscar categories . But he and the movie went_home with no Oscars . The Directors Guild prizes were presented in a dinner ceremony at the Beverly Hilton Hotel and at the Russian Tea Room in New York . Winners for direction in the other categories : Dramatic TV special : Michael Ritchie for HBO ' s &quot; The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom. &quot; Dramatic TV series : Charles Haid , &quot; NYPD BLUE &quot; episode &quot; True Confessions. &quot; Comedy TV series : James Burrows , &quot; Frasier , &quot; &quot; The Good Son &quot; pilot . Daytime serials : Jill Mitwell , &quot; One Life to Live , &quot; episode 6356 . Musical variety_show : Jeff Margolis , &quot; The 65th Annual Academy Awards. &quot; Documentary : Barbara Kopple , &quot; Fallen Champ : The Untold Story of Mike Tyson. &quot; Commercials : James Gartner , &quot; Applause &quot; and &quot; Golden Package &quot; for Federal Express , and &quot; Baseball and Piroshki &quot; for AT &amp; T .
