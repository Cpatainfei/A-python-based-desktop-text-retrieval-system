   <HEADLINE> EXTRADITION HEARING SET IN KIDNAPING CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A man suspected of kidnaping and sexually assaulting a Val Verde real_estate_agent is likely to be transferred from Utah , where he was apprehended , to Los Angeles to face federal charges , authorities said Thursday . Timothy Daniel Shue , 38 , will appear in federal_court in Salt_Lake_City today where he will have the opportunity to challenge efforts to extradite him to California , said his court-appointed attorney , Reid Lambert . If Shue resists , prosecutors seeking extradition would have to convince a federal judge or grand_jury that there is probable_cause he committed the kidnaping . Lambert , who had not met with Shue as of Thursday afternoon , was not optimistic his client would prevail in an extradition hearing . &quot; I anticipate one way or another he ' ll be back in California , &quot; Lambert said . Shue , a resident of Cadillac , Mich. , faces life in prison without parole if convicted of kidnaping Paula Harrington , 26 , from Val Verde on June 29 by posing as a prospective home_buyer , said Assistant U.S. Atty . Debra Yang in Los Angeles . Harrington was found tied_up in a motel_room three days later in Gila Bend , Ariz. , a small_town 68 miles southwest of Phoenix . Shue is the suspect in several similar cases , including the kidnaping , rape and robbery of at least four women in the Midwest this year . He is also the suspect in an assault on a Medford , Ore. , woman on June 23 . Federal_officials want Shue brought_to Los Angeles for prosecution because the alleged abduction of Harrington &quot; is the most recent episode on his part as far as the witnesses and evidence , &quot; Yang said . &quot; For us it ' s all fresh. &quot; Prosecutors said that although extradition to California is likely , its not guaranteed because Shue faces federal charges for fraud and unlawful flight in Michigan . Several state and county law_enforcement agencies also intend to pursue charges against him . &quot; It ' s going_to be one of those situations where he may well go from jurisdiction to jurisdiction , &quot; said Assistant U.S. Atty . Paul Warner . If a federal judge orders the extradition and Shue does not challenge the ruling , he could be brought_to California by next week , Yang said . Shue was arrested about 2 a.m. Wednesday when he allegedly displayed a handgun to a dancer in a topless club in Ogden , Utah , said FBI spokesman Jack Callahan . He was paroled from a Michigan state_prison in July , 1993 , following a conviction for armed robbery .</TEXT>
