   <HEADLINE> O.C. DANCE / CHRIS PASLES ; PUTTING A STAMP ON FLAMENCO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Flamenco is like the blues in America , &quot; says Juan Talavera of the Flamenco Dance Theatre . &quot; There ' s a guy wailing , another guy playing the guitar , and someone says ' I can move to that kind of number. ' And he starts dancing. &quot; The wailing springs from the lives and passions of the Gypsies , the &quot; very proud people , &quot; in Talavera ' s words , who created flamenco . &quot; Unfortunately they are a very persecuted people , even today . They don ' t hold jobs . People don ' t hire them . They can ' t go_into restaurants . &quot; In Spain last year , &quot; Talavera continued , on the phone from his home_in Whittier , &quot; I saw a family of Gypsies thrown_out of a McDonald ' s . I went_up to the manager and asked why . He said : ' They ' re Gypsies. ' that ' s their reason . that ' s what the Gypsies have to deal with . All that comes_out in the singing and dancing. &quot; This weekend and next , Talavera will present four different programs of flamenco music and dance at the Curtis Theatre in Brea . He will include a variety of forms that he divides into &quot; light , medium and heavy &quot; -- because , he says , otherwise &quot; it gets too heavy . You want to shoot yourself after the last number . &quot; Cante chico means light , happy , no cares , we ' re having a fiesta-type of thing . We ' re eating and enjoying ourselves . Medium flamenco : The ( dining ) is over , you think_of lost loves , lost whatever . You have a couple more drinks and get_into the deep stuff -- persecution , isolation . You ' re by yourself -- solitude , loneliness . We ' re always singing about lost loves or lost things . We ' re always losing something. &quot; Discussing the style , Talavera noted that &quot; in American dancing , jazz or tap or any of that Broadway musical thing , everything moves at_the_same_time and at the same pace . In flamenco dancing -- not Hispanic dancing ; flamenco is different -- the upper body always moves a lot slower than the feet . The upper body is very statuesque , proud . The hands undulate slowly . The feet might be going crazy. &quot; Because the essence of the music is spontaneous emotional expression , &quot; the hard part is to get the singer to sing the same verse each time . &quot; They ' re not into rehearsal . They hate it . The first thing I get ( from them ) is , ' How many rehearsals ? How long are they ? ' &quot; In rehearsal that day , the singer might be feeling low . When the performance comes_along , maybe it ' s been a good_day , maybe he made $ 500 -- he ' s not going_to sing the same verse. &quot; Like the Gypsies , Talavera knows something about harassment . Born in Los Angeles and raised in East L.A. , he began studying dance when he was 6 . It was a risky thing for a boy there to do . &quot; You got beat_up ; you got called names . &quot; Even now , people call me names because they know I ' m a dancer . Talk to any male dancer here in the United States and tell me he hasn ' t gone_through some sort of backlash because he ' s a dancer. &quot; He persevered and began dancing professionally as a teen-ager . When he was 22 , he and two older associates founded the El Cid Flamenco Nightclub in Los Angeles , where he continued to dance until 1985 , long after its ownership had passed . In an interview that year , he said : &quot; I don ' t want to be dancing when I ' m 50 . You look real strange. &quot; Reminded of that quote recently , he laughed . &quot; I ' m 54 , and I ' m still dancing . Unfortunately , I think it ' s my life . I tried all sorts of different things . I ' ve tried acting . That hasn ' t worked . I ' ve done teaching . . . But when I hear a good flamenco guitarist and a good flamenco singer . . . You give me flamenco and man , I ' m there . I ' m alive. &quot; * Juan Talavera and Flamenco Dance Theatre present different programs -- Saturday at 8:30 p.m. , Sunday at 3:30 p.m. and May 20 and 21 at 8:30 p.m. -- at the Curtis Theatre in the Brea Civic Center , 1 Civic Center Drive , Brea . $ 19.50.
