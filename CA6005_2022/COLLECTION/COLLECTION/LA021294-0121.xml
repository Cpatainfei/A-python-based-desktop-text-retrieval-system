   <HEADLINE> QUAKE FUELS ONLY A BRIEF AFFAIR WITH MASS TRANSIT ; COMMUTING : TIME-CONSUMING PROBLEMS DASH HOPES THAT DAMAGE WOULD SEVER ANGELENOS ' ROMANCE WITH CARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After the earthquake snapped the freeways , Phyllis Solomon switched to public transportation . Door to door , her one-way train-and-bus commute from Palmdale to Century City sometimes took more_than four hours . Finally , she gave_up this week and drove -- cutting her commute time in half . &quot; Public transportation is just not worth it to me , &quot; said Solomon , 49 , a legal secretary . Transportation officials hoped that agonizingly long drives_around quake-damaged freeways would succeed where advertising_campaigns had failed and force thousands of Angelenos like Solomon to give_up their cars in favor of mass transit . In the days after the Jan . 17 earthquake , the number of passengers riding commuter_trains soared to an all-time high . But only two weeks later , ridership on the Metrolink line most affected -- the Santa Clarita route -- dropped more_than 50 % as_many passengers decided once again to drive . Raising this question : If a magnitude 6.8 quake will not permanently change solo driving habits , then what will ? The answer , experts say , has less to do with improving mass transit than making driving so odious that Southern Californians would find it easier to take trains and buses . That , they believe , would require a slew of politically unpopular moves , effectively stripping the automobile of many of the unnoticed government subsidies that it has enjoyed . It would mean eliminating free parking at places such_as shopping_malls and libraries . Or instituting an odd / even policy so people drive only every_other day . Or charging motorists a fee for using freeways during rush_hours just as the telephone_company charges higher rates for calls during business hours . Such measures could level the playing_field , making mass transit an acceptable alternative , experts say . &quot; People drive not because habits are hard to break but because it ' s more rational for them to do so -- it takes less time and money , &quot; said Martin Wachs , professor of urban_planning at UCLA . &quot; The auto goes any place you want at any hour. &quot; Technology exists that allows cars to be equipped with a device that monitors the time_of_day the car operates and whether it is_on a congested roadway . In such a scheme , which would most likely have to be government-sanctioned , motorists on empty country roads would not be charged , but those on Interstate 5 during rush_hour would receive monthly bills . &quot; Congestion pricing is very unpopular but we know it works from the airlines because people do stay over Saturday nights to get cheaper fares , &quot; said Wachs , who added that the method would be more effective than a gas tax in penalizing those using crowded roads during peak hours . In the United States , the relatively low price of operating automobiles encourages people to drive , said Don Shoup , professor of architecture and urban_planning at UCLA . Gasoline and vehicle registration fees are about three times more expensive in Europe , where about 20 % of people use mass transit . By contrast , about 3 % of Southern Californians use buses and trains . Forcing Angelenos off jammed roads would mean &quot; increasing the cost of using your car to unimaginable high levels , &quot; Shoup said . &quot; Maybe we would have to quadruple the cost of using the car to double transit use. &quot; Charging for parking at many public places would force people to plan excursions more carefully , driving less so they would pay fewer fees , Shoup said . According to a recent Metrolink survey , free workplace parking was a key factor_in whether drivers rode the train or drove , said Richard Stanger , executive_director of Metrolink . &quot; The biggest problem is that so many workers get free parking at their employment , &quot; he said . While setting_up a system to discourage drivers , transportation officials would have to simultaneously improve mass transit , experts said . This could mean offering more coordinated and frequent service on buses and trains as well as adding an option : vans that offered door-to-door shared-ride services . These vans would be cheaper but run less direct routes than taxis , and they would be more convenient than standard buses . &quot; We need things that are more appropriate to the way people travel . . . shuttles can serve the dispersed ( commuting ) patterns that we have , &quot; said Genevieve Giuliano , associate_professor of urban and regional planning at USC . If the shattered freeways are restored without taking steps to modify behavior , urban planners say , Angelenos will soon return to their cars , relishing the days when traffic delays are caused by a mere SigAlert . &quot; Fundamentally , people are not going_to change , &quot; said Jim Moore , associate_professor of urban and regional planning at USC . Secretary_of_Transportation Federico Pena and transit officials disagree , saying that at long last Angelenos are ready to welcome mass transit . Southern Californians , even more_than their San Francisco counterparts , will embrace public transportation because people commute longer distances here , Pena has said . After the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 , ridership on the Bay Area Rapid_Transit also reached record highs , increasing from 218 # 000 a day to a peak of 357 # 000 before the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge opened . But once roads were reopened , BART won only a 10 % increase in passengers , said Michael Bernick , vice_chairman of the BART board . In Los Angeles , the vast majority of all workers -- 79 % -- drive to work alone , according to a 1993 survey commissioned by state transit officials . Even if transportation officials tripled the number of people riding the rails , the impact on congested freeways would scarcely be noticeable , they say . &quot; If you are running a transit system , having even 15 % more passengers helps you pay the bills , &quot; said Charles Lave , professor of economics at UC Irvine . &quot; But if you are trying to solve the transportation problems of Los Angeles , and you add 15 % to a transit mode that doesn ' t carry a lot in the first place , it doesn ' t do a lot for you. &quot; For transportation officials , the Northridge earthquake posed a unique opportunity to introduce mass transit to people , such_as Solomon , who had never used it before . In the days after the quake , the 1-year-old Metrolink got more publicity than the commuter_train line could ever buy . There was footage of happy commuters boarding periwinkle blue and white trains slapped up against vistas of motorists snarled in traffic_jams for hours . Plenty of commuters , such_as Gary Arlt , sung Metrolink ' s praises . Arlt , 44 , took the 5:22 a.m. Santa Clarita train , leaving about two hours earlier than during pre-quake days when he drove to his Glendale office . &quot; It beats sitting in the car for three hours , &quot; Arlt said . The earthquake transformed Solomon ' s typical 90-minute drive into a four-hour odyssey on public transportation . After the earthquake , Solomon decided to try riding the train rather than driving on the crippled freeways . She left her Palmdale home each weekday morning at 4 a.m. , drove to Santa Clarita to catch a commuter_train Downtown , then hopped a bus to Century City . Finally , she walked four blocks to reach her office . In rain and cold , the walk was miserable . Sometimes the bus was late and Solomon would miss her evening train home . Because of the infrequency of trains running to Palmdale , Solomon frequently ended_up getting home at 11 p.m. Exhausted , she would skip dinner and only eat a piece of fruit . She would go_to_bed 30 minutes after getting home so she could get_up in time the next morning . Too fatigued to cope_with chores , she hired a housekeeper . &quot; I haven ' t seen my husband at all ; it ' s killed my home life , &quot; Solomon said . &quot; On weekends , I ' m tired all_the time. &quot; Meanwhile , Caltrans was opening improved detours , allowing more cars to travel faster around battered freeways . Solomon was experiencing a crucial flaw in the Southland ' s public transportation_system : having to rely_on buses to hook_up_with trains . &quot; The more time people have to spend standing at bus_stops , the less likely they are to ride , &quot; planning expert Giuliano said . &quot; Fare is not as critical as the service provided . For people who are not transit-dependent , for people who have a choice , the biggest issue is convenience. &quot; And so back to the car went Solomon , breathing a sigh of relief . &quot; Yesterday I left work_at 4:50 and got home at 6:20 . If I ' d taken the train the earliest I would have gotten home would have been 8 o ' clock , &quot; she said Friday . &quot; I think people aren ' t going_to give_up their cars . They like being able to go when they want. &quot;</TEXT>
