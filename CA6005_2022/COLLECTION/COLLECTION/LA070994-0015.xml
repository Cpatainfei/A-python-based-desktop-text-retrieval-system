   <HEADLINE> U.N. NAMES SOUTH_AFRICAN JUDGE AS BALKANS WAR_CRIMES PROSECUTOR ; SECURITY_COUNCIL : APPOINTMENT OF RESPECTED MAGISTRATE AFTER LONG DELAYS RAISES HOPES OF HUMAN_RIGHTS ACTIVISTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reviving hopes of human_rights activists , the U.N. Security_Council on Friday appointed Richard Goldstone -- the South_African judge who exposed the illegal , anti-black campaign of his country ' s military intelligence_officers -- as prosecutor for the Balkans War_Crimes Tribunal . The appointment , by a unanimous 15-0 vote , came_after more_than a year of wrangling over a prosecutor . The tribunal is charged with trying those accused of &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; and other war_crimes in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina . Delays in choosing a prosecutor slowed the work of the tribunal , headquartered in The Hague . But diplomats now believe that Goldstone , 55 , should be ready to announce the first indictments this fall . The council vote also ushered a prominent South_African into a prestigious international position . Until the election of Nelson Mandela as South_Africa ' s first black president in late April , it was unthinkable that the council would name a judge from a country that was the redoubt of apartheid and an international pariah . Madeleine Albright , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , who has made prosecution of war_criminals in the Balkans almost a personal crusade , was vacationing in Europe when the council voted . But in a statement issued on her behalf by the U.S. mission to the United Nations , she hailed Goldstone as &quot; a seasoned barrister and judge who , at great personal risk , insisted that the truth be known about cruel abuses committed under apartheid in South Africa. &quot; &quot; He already has made his mark on history on one continent , &quot; she said . &quot; By our decision today , Judge Goldstone will have an opportunity to shape the future on another continent. &quot; Albright also bemoaned the long delay in naming him . &quot; The search for a chief prosecutor . . . has consumed too_much time and encountered too many obstacles -- some unreasonable , others unpredictable , &quot; she said . &quot; The victims of atrocities in the former Yugoslavia have not been well-served by the resulting delay. &quot; The council had named a prosecutor once before , selecting Venezuelan Atty . Gen . Ramon Escovar Salom last October . But he first delayed coming_to The Hague so he could continue his prosecution of former President Carlos Andres Perez for corruption ; he then resigned in February to become Venezuelan interior minister . The selection process was hampered by an agreement among council_members that their choice be unanimous . This set_off a steady stream of vetoes over the months : Britain vetoed an Egyptian-born American ; several developing nations vetoed a Scot ; Pakistan vetoed an Indian ; Russia vetoed an American and a Canadian . Although council_members did name a deputy prosecutor , Graham T . Blewitt of Australia , in February , the paralysis over choosing a prosecutor made many human_rights activists wonder about the Security_Council ' s commitment to the tribunal . The ambassadors reportedly settled_on Goldstone at the suggestion of Judge Antonio Cassese of Italy , the presiding judge of the tribunal . In South_Africa , Goldstone ' s Commission of Inquiry Regarding the Prevention of Public_Violence and Intimidation attracted worldwide attention in 1992 when it accused military intelligence_officers of mounting a dirty-tricks campaign against the African National Congress , using prostitutes , drug dealers and murderers to lure ANC officials into criminal activities . His commission also bared the details of police massacres of black demonstrators and of violence between Zulus and Xhosas . Goldstone established a reputation as an evenhanded , reassuring magistrate and became one of the few members of the white Establishment of South_Africa to win the full respect of black political_leaders . Despite the appointment of a Balkans prosecutor , there is some fear among human_rights groups that the United States and its European allies might bargain away the tribunal to induce Serbia to accept a peace agreement . * Although all sides have been accused of war_crimes in Bosnia and Croatia , a U.N. commission recently concluded that most were committed by the Serbs . They , for example , have been accused of employing the practice of &quot; ethnic cleansing , &quot; in which murder , rape and other violence have been used to clear an area of enemies , both military and civilian . U.S. officials said the Clinton_Administration still regards the tribunal as a separate issue from any peace agreement and would oppose any lifting of sanctions on Serbia if it refused to cooperate with the tribunal by turning_over those indicted by the prosecutor .</TEXT>
