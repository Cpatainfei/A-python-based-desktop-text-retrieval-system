   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; SPRINT IN TALKS WITH 2 EUROPEAN FIRMS ; TELECOMMUNICATIONS : POSSIBILITY OF PACT WITH FRENCH AND GERMAN PHONE_COMPANIES FOLLOWS COLLAPSE OF EDS MERGER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One day after ending merger talks with Electronic Data Systems Corp. , Sprint Corp . said Tuesday that it is exploring a deal to sell a large portion of itself to two European telephone_companies . The possible partnership with Deutsche Telekom of Germany and France Telecom of France , both state-owned phone monopolies , would &quot; concentrate mainly on providing seamless , global telecommunications services to business customers , &quot; Sprint said in a statement . Details were not disclosed . But executives at Sprint , which operates the United States ' third-largest long-distance network and owns local telephone_systems , said the Europeans might purchase a special type of Sprint stock at above-market prices and gain seats on Sprint ' s board . Sprint ' s merger talks with Electronic Data Systems , a Dallas-based computer services company , collapsed in part because of disagreement over the value of each company ' s stock . Sprint ' s stock rose in response to the latest news , climbing $ 1.375 to $ 39.375 on the New York Stock_Exchange . Any deal reached with the Europeans would face the scrutiny of U.S. and European regulators . &quot; I ' m sure there will be lots of inquiries , &quot; said an official at the Federal Communications Commission . U.S. law bars a foreign investor from directly owning 20 % or more of any company licensed by the FCC . Indirect foreign ownership is limited to 25 % and must be approved by the FCC . The Justice_Department reportedly is negotiating changes to a similar foreign investment plan in which British Telecommunications proposes to buy a 20 % stake in MCI Communications Corp . of Washington , the No . 2 long-distance carrier in the United States . Though the European Community is pressing its member countries to open their telecommunications markets , neither France nor Germany allows competition in its local or long-distance telephone_services . Sprint ' s move is part of a trend among phone_companies worldwide to form alliances that can offer large companies one-stop shopping for international long-distance services . That market is estimated at $ 10 billion a year and is growing at a rate of 20 % annually , according to some estimates .</TEXT>
