   <HEADLINE> AQMD UNVEILS REVAMPED PLAN TO WIPE_OUT SMOG ; POLLUTION : FOCUS IS_ON CREDITS , INCENTIVES FOR INDUSTRY . THE 15-YEAR PROGRAM ALSO TARGETS TRAFFIC EMISSIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reflecting a clean-air strategy billed as more business-friendly and less far-fetched than previous efforts , the Southland ' s air-quality agency Monday unveiled its newest plan to return blue_skies to the nation ' s smoggiest region by 2010 . The South Coast Air Quality Management District ' s plan -- its third in five years -- contains 89 steps proposed for the next 15 years , consisting_of 41 that target pollution from industries , 17 aimed at cars and trucks , and 10 for vehicles such_as trains and airliners , and 21 measures to improve traffic_patterns . About one-third of the ideas are new , with an unprecedented focus_on credits and other market incentives to encourage industries to find their own ways to clean_up smog . The agency says the plan , if successfully implemented , would meet federal health standards for every major air pollutant in the region , despite a projected 40 % population increase . About 75 % of all smog-causing emissions would be eliminated -- 5 % each year . &quot; We think that Congress and the Legislature ( have ) every reason to be optimistic that we can meet the goals they have set for us , &quot; said Barry Wallerstein , AQMD deputy executive_officer . The agency believes that its new air quality management plan is more practical and flexible than the earlier versions . &quot; Most of the items in this plan most people would find to be very realistic . You can ' t please everyone , but I think most people will believe we have a lot more realism in it than perhaps we ' ve had in the past , &quot; said Henry Wedaa , a Yorba Linda councilman who is chairman of the AQMD board . For the next three months , businesses , environmentalists , civic_leaders and others in Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside and San Bernardino counties will comb through the three-foot-thick draft , with the debate likely to focus_on a key point : Where does most of the pain fall ? The AQMD is facing pressure to fairly balance the economic burden among big industries and motorists , small businesses and consumers . The AQMD ' s governing board is scheduled to vote on the program in July after a series of public hearings . Under federal law , the AQMD and the state must have an approved clean-air plan by November . Because this is the AQMD ' s third version of a 20-year clean-air plan , everyone involved is wondering about the chance of success this time . AQMD officials hope the latest plan will replace a sweeping series of rules that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed in February under a court_order to clean_up the air in the Los Angeles Basin . At the time , the EPA challenged the AQMD and the state to come_up with their own smog-control options . To improve the chances of success , some innovative transportation ideas were dropped from the plan at the last minute , including imposing pollution fees on motorists caught speeding and raising the legal driving age to 18 . Those ideas were proposed by the Southern California Assn . of Governments , but Wallerstein called them political lightning_rods that were far-fetched and would distract from more achievable measures . The basic framework of the plan is familiar . Several dozen rules to be adopted by the AQMD or state Air Resources Board would require companies to use the most advanced technology to cut emissions from factories , small businesses , cars and fuels . But the thrust of how to regulate industry shifts dramatically . Market incentives -- just a footnote in the 1991 plan -- now are a cornerstone of the AQMD ' s strategy . The plan contains a series of credits , rebates and fees to encourage cleaner practices in place of traditional regulations . The plan also sets aggressive goals for use of advanced technology in cars . By 2010 , 78 % of passenger_cars would be fueled by methanol or other low-emission fuels , while 22 % would run_on electricity or fuel_cells . Enforcing such mandates falls_under the jurisdiction of the state ARB , which is facing unprecedented pressure from the auto industry to scale back its existing rules . Also included are a trio of fees that are certain to raise howls of protest from motorists : car registration fees based on miles driven , new taxes on fuel and freeway tollbooths that would charge motorists fees during high-congestion hours . Los Angeles attorney Robert Wyman , who represents oil and aerospace companies , said industries will look especially closely at whether the proposals are tough enough in getting high-polluting vehicles and solo commuters off the roads . Wyman said he hopes to see some &quot; innovative transportation controls &quot; to help ease the impact on local industries . Much of the debate about sharing the smog burden focuses_on a new state finding that the volume of pollution emitted by cars has been dramatically underestimated . The Air Resources Board estimates cars emit 60 % more hydrocarbons and twice as much carbon_monoxide as previously thought . Andrew Hirsch , the Southern California Gas Co. ' s senior external affairs manager , said the AQMD is &quot; playing a shell_game &quot; by avoiding the new emissions numbers in its plan to underplay the role cars have in creating smog . He said more painful changes for commuters are needed than those contained in the plan . &quot; It will be hard to do . It will take some dramatic policies to reduce those emissions , &quot; Hirsch said . &quot; It may mean changes in the ways we commute to work . It may mean . . . no-drive days . It ' s more_than reducing tailpipe emissions . The idea is to stop the driving. &quot; Much of the plan pertaining to industry is modeled after RECLAIM , the AQMD ' s newly launched &quot; smog market , &quot; which sets pollution limits for industries and allows them to buy , sell and trade credits , a strategy popular_with big business . The plan calls_for expanding the pollution-trading program in 1998 to 1 # 200 companies that emit hydrocarbons -- petroleum-based fumes that are a main component of smog . Included would be major aerospace firms and other companies that use large amounts of paints and solvents . Under attack by the Legislature and business groups that want to dismantle the agency , the AQMD of 1994 is more focused on consensus-building than the agency that created its original clean-air plan in 1989 . Jack Broadbent , the AQMD ' s director of planning , said the new plan &quot; provides a lot more flexibility &quot; for local businesses . &quot; We learned we can provide industry the target and they will provide the ingenuity to get there , &quot; Broadbent said . &quot; This ( plan ) is more business-friendly , &quot; Wedaa said . &quot; We have been stressing that we should treat the businesses as our customers and we want to have -- as much as possible -- reasonably happy customers. &quot; One of the most critical components of the plan -- an analysis of the cost and social impact -- will not be released until late May . In the past , the AQMD estimated that achieving clean air in the Southland will cost $ 3 billion to $ 6 billion a year . Even though it has no jurisdiction over interstate sources of pollution such_as planes , trains and ships , the AQMD plan contains aggressive proposals to target them . Adopting and enforcing those measures , however , would be left in the hands of the EPA . The proposals to target planes , trains and ships -- sources of smog that have never been regulated before -- are extremely unpopular . Area businesses worry they will make the Los Angeles region less competitive than the rest of the country . &quot; We don ' t think it ' s fair to leave sources uncontrolled , &quot; Wallerstein said . &quot; If it ' s fair_game for passenger_cars , it ' s certainly fair_game for dirty diesel trains. &quot; Some of the other new proposed measures in the plan include : * Use of &quot; smart &quot; cars and highways that electronically ensure traffic flows smoothly by selecting the best route . * Tree plantings . * Credits or rebates for households and businesses that install energy-efficient , low-emitting equipment such_as water_heaters . * Control of dust from unpaved roads and parking_lots . * Emission reductions from construction activities . * Use of advanced technologies in shuttle transit . * Building of infrastructure -- such_as plugs_in garages and recharge stations -- to support electric_cars . A meeting Monday in Van Nuys to explain the plan to the public was lightly attended , but similar sessions continue throughout the four counties today through next Monday . The AQMD will hold its next public meeting today at 9:30 a.m. at the Mission Inn in Riverside and at 2 p.m. at the Red Lion in Ontario . The largest sessions are expected to be at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Davidson Conference_Center in Los Angeles and at 7 p.m Wednesday at the Newport Beach Marriott .</TEXT>
