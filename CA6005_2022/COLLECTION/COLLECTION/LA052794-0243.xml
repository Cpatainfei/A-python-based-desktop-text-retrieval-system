   <HEADLINE> BOOK WORLD BOOTING UP FOR A WHOLE NEW CHAPTER ; PUBLISHING : CD-ROM HAS THE INDUSTRY ABUZZ AS THE AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS ASSN . PREPARES TO GATHER HERE FOR ITS CONVENTION . THE PREDICTION ? GET READY TO CURL_UP WITH A GOOD COMPUTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like surfers waiting for the next wave , booksellers are an anxious bunch these days . They know a big one is coming , they just don ' t know where or when . From coast to coast , the book biz is abuzz with talk_of a brave new computerized world . In the future , some experts predict , a tsunami-force wave of CD-ROM technology and other innovations will wash through U.S. bookstores , dramatically transforming the way texts are written , packaged , sold and read . Within years , they suggest , books will be more_than hard-bound bestsellers or mass-market paperbacks . They ' ll be three-dimensional , sensory experiences on home computer_screens that usher_in a new era of literary information . You ' ll just pop_in a compact_disk , turn_on the laptop . . . and read . Few are predicting the demise of books as we know them , because it ' s hard to imagine your PowerBook at the beach , or bedtime stories with the kids in front of an impersonal computer . But in a nation where 32 % of all homes have PCs , the demand for electronic book products could become insatiable . &quot; There ' s a change coming and we have to stake our claim to this new market , &quot; says Doug Dutton , owner of Dutton ' s Books in Brentwood . &quot; Yet that ' s all we know . We booksellers have a lot of questions about where we ' re headed. &quot; They ' ll be seeking answers starting Saturday , when more_than 30 # 000 publishers , authors , booksellers , agents and other vendors gather_in Los Angeles for the annual American Booksellers Assn . convention . The four-day event is the largest book conference in the English-speaking world . As in previous meetings , there will be lavish signing parties , gala dinners and no shortage of literary hoopla . Some of the nation ' s foremost writers will be in_attendance : Tony Kushner , Tom Robbins , Maya Angelou , Dave Barry , Michael Crichton , Allen Ginsburg , Matt Groening , Dean Koontz , Amy Tan , Tom Peters , Anne Rivers Siddons , John Irving and Pat Conroy . There will be glitz and dish galore when lovebugs James Carville and Mary Matalin preview their joint account of what it was like to be_on opposing sides of the 1992 Clinton-Bush campaigns . On a local note , author panels will delve into the literature of the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the image of the City of Angels as reflected in novels , poetry , short_stories and memoirs . Much of the informal buzz , however , is expected to focus_on electronic publishing , a relatively new branch of the book business that ' s gathering more force each year . For the first time , the ABA will be devoting a sizable chunk of convention floor space to computer book products . The market has clearly grabbed sellers ' attention -- but will they be able to ride the new_wave ? &quot; that ' s the $ 64 # 000 question , &quot; says Elisa Zachary , publisher of Simon &amp; Schuster ' s interactive division , which is less than a year old . &quot; You have to train people to sell these products , and consumers have to become more aware . Maybe they ' ve heard about electronic books . But they don ' t know much more. &quot; * On the surface , it looks simple : CD-ROM technology records the text of a book on compact_disk to be read on a computer_screen . The experience is often enhanced with sound , graphics and material not found in the original book . The most dramatic feature of the new product , however , is interactive : It enables people to &quot; talk back &quot; to the text with the mere click of a computer switch . From a creative standpoint , the possibilities are endless . In a future CD-ROM book , for example , readers could step into a novel , invent characters and change plots . The technology already exists for kids to watch Velociraptors crossing a Mongolian plain , as they click their way through a book about dinosaurs . History has been enhanced for many college_students , who now can look_up Hitler , Lenin or Stalin in an on-line encyclopedia and see grainy films of them delivering speeches on home computer_screens . Publishers are calling it the ultimate marriage of reading and entertainment . But they caution that electronic books and their ilk are like many other futuristic products rolling_down the new information superhighway . &quot; Right now it ' s all talk and speculation , &quot; says a high-ranking executive of a major American booksellers chain . &quot; Everybody knows the potential here is going_to be vast and huge . . . but it ' s up_to consumers to make this fly. &quot; Currently , there are only a limited number of CD-ROM book products on the market , ranging from the complete Oxford_English Dictionary to a group of children ' s stories , including &quot; Just Grandma and Me , &quot; which has sold more_than 130 # 000 copies . Customers seeking them out_in bookstores may be disappointed because many stores don ' t yet carry a full product_line . Indeed , CD-ROM books are more typically found in computer_stores such_as Egghead Software and Comp USA . Booksellers hope to correct that so they don ' t lose the market . And publishers are also feeling the heat , because they don ' t want to merely provide the back list of material for others to re-create on CD-ROM . For them , the big bucks will be in marketing and distribution . &quot; We ' re rethinking what it means to be a publisher , and we ' re trying to move as_many products on paper into electronics , &quot; says Randi Benton , who runs the interactive computer division of Random House Inc. &quot; But everybody has to proceed cautiously , because there are some obvious business concerns. &quot; Such_as : How do you bet the farm on a new medium when fewer than 5 million American homes have CD-ROM technology in their computers ? Will enough customers buy electronic books that typically sell for $ 69.99 or more ? Most important , what happens if compact_disk technology becomes the eight-track tape of the 1990s -- an obsolete hardware that ' s overtaken by new gadgetry ? &quot; I don ' t think it really matters that much , &quot; says Bob Stein , a creative guru at the Voyager Co. , a New York-based firm that creates CD-ROM books . &quot; Did the Beatles suffer when eight-track tapes gave_way to cassettes ? They did just fine and so did their audience . The point is , change will happen. &quot; * Stein should know . Working with author Art Spiegelman , he recently unveiled a stunning example of what CD-ROM technology can do to an already superb product . Spiegelman ' s &quot; Maus , &quot; an award-winning cartoon that chronicled the horror of the Holocaust through the eyes of a mouse and other characters , has been transformed into a provocative new computer-book experience . Along with the original text and drawings , readers can tap into several hours of audiotapes featuring Spiegelman ' s father , on whose life the book was based . There ' s a running commentary by the author , describing his creative process , as well as thousands of additional sketches , maps and documents that helped create the world of &quot; Maus. &quot; It ' s a richer reading experience by far . &quot; You ' re entering a whole new_world , &quot; Stein says . &quot; Reading used to be something where you only used one of five senses , but now at least we ' ve added a second , which is hearing . We ' ve enlarged the band width , so to speak . &quot; And we ' re going to see a time when many writers no longer just rely_on the printed page to communicate . They ' ll be using the computer as a larger locus of expression . that ' s where you ' ll find our forward-looking writers. &quot; The new technology also permits a richer look_at the past . In the recently published diaries of Richard Nixon presidential aide H.R. Haldeman , for example , readers of the printed book can thumb through 684 pages of text . But the CD-ROM version just issued by Sony Electronics includes an expanded text as well as 45 minutes of rare home_movies of Nixon shot by Haldeman . Booksellers are watching and waiting to see how the new medium performs , but there are some preliminary indications it will be quite popular . Bernard Rath , ABA executive_director , notes that the introduction of on-line encyclopedias has caused a 10 % -12 % dip in sales of printed versions . &quot; It would be a shame if we don ' t seize the advantage and get_in the forefront of this , &quot; he says . &quot; Our goal is to make the bookstore perceived as the place to go_for information or entertainment in any format. &quot; And the place to start , many say , is with kids . It ' s no accident that Random House is emphasizing children ' s products in its initial CD-ROM ventures . Next year , Dr. Seuss ' works will be available on disk , through a joint_venture with Random House and Broderbund . This fall , Simon &amp; Schuster will market a Star Trek junkies ' dream -- the operating manual for the USS Enterprise in a bold new computer format , replete with interactive gizmos , color graphics and vivid sound_effects . &quot; Kids are sponges with computers , &quot; Random House ' s Benton says . &quot; They absorb this stuff completely , with no fear . They have no barriers . So they ' re a natural place for the first waves of this new medium to start appearing. &quot;</TEXT>
