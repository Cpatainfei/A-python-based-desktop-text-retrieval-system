   <TEXT> Thufferin ' thuccotash ! Animation giant Isadore &quot; Friz &quot; Freleng will receive the first lifetime achievement award given by the Santa Clarita Valley International Film Festival . The 88-year-old Freleng will be honored Saturday night for a body_of_work that includes Oscar-winning cartoons featuring Bugs Bunny , Yosemite Sam , Sylvester and Tweety , Speedy Gonzales and the Pink Panther . The prize will be known as the Friz . One of the geniuses who put the &quot; loon &quot; in Looney Tunes , Freleng worked his goofy magic at Warner Bros . for more_than 30 years . In 1963 , he joined with David De Patie to create De Patie-Freleng Enterprises . There he fathered the Pink Panther , whose debut in the title sequence of Blake Edwards ' film almost stole the show from star Peter Sellers . &quot; Time magazine wrote it up and said it was better than the picture , &quot; Freleng recalled recently . &quot; Blake didn ' t like that. &quot; Freleng , who lives_in Westwood with his wife of 61 years , taught himself animation from a book . As one of the shapers of Bugs , Daffy Duck and other animated zanies who zoom through the American subconscious , he gets stacks of mail from scholars and fans alike . He continues to produce original art in the style of animation cels , sold through Warner Bros . Studio stores for as much as $ 1 # 700 . He and his fellow animators never thought_of their six-minute movies as tomorrow ' s classics . &quot; We were just making a living , &quot; Freleng says . But the Warner Bros . artists always competed against each other , and they were ever ready to puncture the pretensions of their snooty rival , Disney . Today the Warner Bros . pantheon is nearly as famous as Mickey and his pals and even more fondly regarded by people who once got sent to their rooms without their supper . At this very moment , the Warner Bros . store in Topanga Plaza is selling shirts , address books and other merchandise featuring a scene from Freleng ' s 1957 Oscar winner , &quot; Birds Anonymous , &quot; in which Sylvester tries , and fails , to rise above being a puddy tat . Freleng , Tex Avery , Chuck Jones and the other great Warner Bros . animators hold no rights to the characters they breathed such raucous life into . &quot; The Pink Panther probably earns him more money than all his other work combined , &quot; says Norman M . Klein , a CalArts animation expert familiar_with Freleng and his work . Honored by the American Film Institute and other prestigious bodies , Freleng was the most musical of the Warner Bros . animators . &quot; His sense of rhythm and timing was remarkably adept , &quot; Klein says . In his view , Freleng ' s genius is sometimes underrated by historians of animation because &quot; it wasn ' t as flashy as some of the others. &quot; As evidence of Freleng ' s intuitive understanding of what makes a cartoon comedy work , Klein points to the creation of Granny , a seemingly sweet old_lady who manages to make Sylvester ' s life a living hell . &quot; The cuter the character the more sadistic it can be , &quot; Klein reminds . He also cites the complexity and depth of character that Freleng brought_to Tweety , who had been just another mean-spirited little canary in the hands of animator Bob Clampett . Freleng ' s best work , says Klein , praising him very highly indeed , &quot; is very elegant and silly. &quot; When Freleng talks_about his characters , he talks_about acting . &quot; We really became actors with a pencil , &quot; he says . &quot; that ' s the difference between them and the characters you see today . We made them act. &quot; As a result , no one thinks_of Bugs or Sylvester as drawings . &quot; Today , &quot; Freleng says , &quot; the dialogue does the acting , and the characters just move. &quot; Bugs Bunny was so real , according to Freleng , that people would ask him where the wascally wabbit lived . And Freleng himself sometimes talks_about his characters as if they were human actors with human attributes . &quot; Nobody liked working with Porky Pig much because he was sort of a square , &quot; Freleng says . And the animator once told Klein , &quot; I couldn ' t stand having Bugs up against Elmer because Elmer had the brains of a chicken. &quot; And now the answer to the question on everybody ' s lips : Is Freleng really the model for Yosemite Sam ? Yes , you varmints . &quot; I have the same temperament , &quot; Freleng admits . &quot; I ' m small , and I used to have a red mustache. &quot; WHERE AND WHEN What : Awards dinner , hosted by radio and TV personality Tom Hatten . Location : Magic Mountain Studios , Studio 1 , 26030 Avenue Hall , Santa Clarita . Hours : 5:30 p.m. Saturday . Guest speaker : Chuck Jones , another of the Warner Bros . animation geniuses . Price : $ 75 . Call : ( 805 ) 257-7977 or ( 805 ) 257-7778 .</TEXT>
