   <HEADLINE> THE DEATH-PENALTY DECISION : BLACKMUN ' S VERY PUBLIC SHIFT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Justice Harry A . Blackmun ' s recent announcement that he considered the death_penalty unconstitutional , and would &quot; no longer tinker with the machinery of death , &quot; was in many ways extraordinary . Yet , how and why he sought to draw public attention to his about-face on that red-hot political issue was singularly unprecedented as well . Supreme Court justices rarely change their minds so dramatically . They are certainly not given to striking out on_their_own against colleagues or the tide of public_opinion . Though barbed exchanges and personal attacks have become more common in opinions , Blackmun ' s expression of personal agony over executions was unusual . Justices rarely file dissenting_opinions from the court ' s denial review of cases . Those they do file usually go unnoticed . Yet , the national debate over capital_punishment began more_than 30 years ago with another dissent from a denial of review . In the 1963 case , Rudolph vs . Alabama , for the first time ever , Justice Arthur J . Goldberg suggested that capital_punishment might violate the Eighth Amendment ' s ban on &quot; cruel and unusual punishment. &quot; His dissenting_opinion signaled lawyers to challenge head-on the constitutionality of the death_penalty . It resulted in a decade-long moratorium on executions and , eventually , to the Supreme Court ' s striking down of capital- punishment laws in the 1972 decision , Furman vs . Georgia . Blackmun ' s shift is all_the more ironic because he was appointed in 1970 for his conservative &quot; law and order &quot; views by Republican President Richard M . Nixon . He dissented from the Furman ruling that existing death-penalty laws were unconstitutional because they resulted in arbitrary , capricious and discriminatory executions . In Justice Potter Stewart ' s words , they are &quot; cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and unusual. &quot; After more_than two decades , Blackmun has finally come_around to Stewart ' s view . On other matters of criminal justice , he remains basically conservative . But death is different . And Blackmun now stands alone on the court in opposing capital_punishment . Leaving aside the issue , Blackmun ' s switch appears unusual in other ways . We tend to think_of justices becoming more conservative as they grow older . Felix Frankfurter , for one , was appointed by Franklin D . Roosevelt as a well-known liberal Harvard Law professor . Over the course of his career , though , he emerged as a leading conservative . Many others justices followed this path . Other times , justices have not changed as much as circumstances overtook them . Another Roosevelt appointee , Justice Hugo L . Black , was considered the leading liberal defender of First_Amendment freedoms in the 1940s and ' 50s . By the late 1960s , however , he was fighting a rear-guard action against the prevailing forces on the progressive Warren Court . The court and the country had changed -- but not Black . To be sure , justices in the past have reconsidered their positions . The view from the bench occasionally changes their perspective . Democratic President Harry S . Truman was dumbfounded by the vote of his appointee , Justice Tom C . Clark , in the Steel Seizure case in 1952 . As his former attorney_general , Clark had assured Truman that he had the power to seize steel_mills to avert nationwide strikes that might threaten the war effort in Korea . On the bench , however , Justice Clark voted otherwise . Justice Robert H . Jackson similarly recanted on what he had told Roosevelt when he was his attorney_general , explaining , &quot; The matter does not appear to me now as it appears to have appeared to me then. &quot; Life in the marble temple affords opportunities for reflection and growth -- even though notions of precedent can be constraining . Deference to precedent and institutional norms incline justices to stand_firm once they take a position . Nonetheless , they do occasionally switch -- but usually without the drama and publicity that accompanied Blackmun ' s recent move . Indeed , Blackmun has changed his mind on other , less publicized , issues . In 1976 , for example , he cast the crucial vote_in a bare majority for enforcing the 10th Amendment -- which guarantees the states ' &quot; reserved powers &quot; as a limitation on Congress . Almost a decade later , he concluded there was no basis for applying the 10th Amendment . And he voted to overturn the earlier decision . Yet , he did not strike_out on_his_own then as he has now . For those serving on the Supreme Court , time also brings changes in perspective . That clearly figured in Blackmun ' s turnabout . Every year , he faced scores of death-penalty appeals . It wore_on him and he struggled over those about to be executed -- especially when they had had inadequate attorneys or , as he said , got &quot; a runaround &quot; in the lower courts . The &quot; staggering evidence of racial prejudice &quot; also took its toll on him . Remarkably , after more_than 20 years , Blackmun concluded , &quot; Whether a human_being should live or die is so inherently subjective -- rife_with all_of life ' s understandings , experiences , prejudices and passions -- that it inevitably defies the rationality and consistency required by the Constitution. &quot; Conscience stood_in the way of continuing to support what , he conceded , the Constitution permits and politicians in both parties increasingly demand . In so publicly highlighting his reversal on capital_punishment , Blackmun held himself up for criticism and ridicule . Hard-line conservatives jumped at the chance to denounce him . Justice Antonin Scalia dismissed his reasoning as &quot; false , untextual and unhistorical. &quot; That Blackmun sought publicity for his switch remains at the heart of the_matter . There are few comparable issues on which justices have said they erred and then sought public recognition of that . The closest was when Justice Lewis F . Powell Jr . publicly regretted casting the crucial fifth vote to uphold laws banning homosexual and heterosexual sodomy in Bowers vs . Hardwick in 1986 . Several years later , he confessed , &quot; I think I probably made a mistake in that one. &quot; Unlike Blackmun , however , Powell spoke out after he left the court . Blackmun ' s switch and public disavowal of capital_punishment appears singular in the court ' s history -- though not unexpected . He has been outspoken before in breaking_with the court ' s tradition of &quot; judicial lockjaw , &quot; as Frankfurter put it . His off-the-bench remarks are often frank expressions of emotion . He has repeatedly lamented over the years , for example , that he would probably take &quot; to his grave &quot; his authorship of the 1973 landmark abortion ruling in Roe vs . Wade . In December , in another dramatic break_with court tradition , Blackmun appeared on &quot; Nightline. &quot; It was about as close as a justice comes_to holding a press_conference . There , he talked candidly about his disillusionment with how the system of capital_punishment works . He went_out of his way to set the stage for attracting as much public attention as possible to his new stand against the death_penalty . By almost any measure , Blackmun ' s announcement was singular and orchestrated to renew debate . Notably , he did not come_out against capital_punishment on moral grounds -- as had former Justices William J . Brennan Jr . and Thurgood Marshall . Instead , he emphasized his years of experience with &quot; the machinery of death. &quot; Blackmun was moved by the inexorable racism that taints and the injustices that accompany the practice of capital_punishment in the United States . Ultimately , he could no longer abide_by the court ' s underlying philosophy that sustains a system of admittedly cruel punishment inflicted only in unusual cases to satisfy society ' s demand for retribution . In his remaining time on the bench , Blackmun apparently wants to clear his conscience , letting the chips fall where they may . In reversing himself on such a politically charged issue and in such a publicized way , he certainly broke_with tradition and made an unprecedented but calculated appeal_to future generations .</TEXT>
