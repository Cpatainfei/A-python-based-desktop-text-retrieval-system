   <TEXT> Here are some highlights from Dan Quayle ' s &quot; Standing_Firm &quot; : * Forget any questions about inhaling . Quayle was worried that a college arrest for underage drinking might prove his political undoing . * His father , a newspaper owner , refused to remove his jacket even in the most stifling of outdoor summer news_conferences in hot-and-humid Indiana . Quayle pe re was worried that the bulldog tattooed on his forearm might embarrass his son . * Marilyn Quayle , for her part , was worried that in the crush of the campaign , she might not get 1988 school shopping done for Tucker , Benjamin and Corinne . Ever efficient , she did all her buying before leaving for the GOP convention in New Orleans . * Sometimes the &quot; self-importance &quot; of the press was amazing , Quayle writes . Think_of the time former Washington Post reporter Sally Quinn said to him , &quot; Did you ever think you ' d be among so many important people ? &quot; Quayle concludes she meant herself and the rest of the media present . * There ' s such a thing as wearing objectivity on your sleeve -- but apparently not on your shirt . One New York Times reporter showed_up in the White_House press room wearing a T-shirt depicting Edvard Munch ' s creepy painting &quot; The Scream , &quot; with the caption &quot; President Quayle ? &quot; * How ' bout those White_House insiders ? Former Chief_of_Staff Jim Baker cared only about &quot; what was in it for Jim Baker , &quot; Quayle writes . Jack Kemp nattered on , wandering onto &quot; tangents &quot; that had &quot; no discernible point. &quot; And the handlers who surrounded George_Bush &quot; made the President look foolish. &quot; * Combat with the press was often downright intoxicating . &quot; I loved every minute of it , &quot; Quayle relates . * On a judicial level , racism had ended in this country by 1989 , writes Quayle : &quot; No one could seriously argue that in our country the races were still unequal before the law. &quot; * Quayle may have been portrayed as &quot; the $ 650-million man &quot; because of his family ' s wealth . But his own circumstances were far more modest , he insists . To pay_for her inaugural attire , Marilyn Quayle sold the family van . ELIZABETH MEHREN</TEXT>
