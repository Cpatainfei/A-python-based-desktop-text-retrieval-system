   <HEADLINE> US-JAPAN TRADE TENSIONS ; HIGH-STAKES GAME FOR STATE ' S WORKERS ; ECONOMY : A TRADE WAR COULD PROVE DEVASTATING TO CALIFORNIA ' S RECOVERY . BUT SOME COULD BENEFIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Auto designer Gerald P . Hirshberg has been_on both sides of the U.S.-Japan trade dispute . And , as a former designer for General Motors Corp . and now the San Diego-based chief designer for Japanese auto_maker Nissan , he still is . &quot; Anyone who ' s being honest who ' s working for a foreign company . . . ( admits ) you ' re torn between your allegiances to your country . . . and . . . putting food on the table , &quot; he said . So how is he viewing the rising trade tensions between the two economic superpowers ? &quot; With a wrenched stomach , &quot; he said . Hirshberg and tens of thousands of other Californians whose jobs depend_on ties with Japan are like the proverbial blades of grass that stand to get trampled if the elephants fight . In this case , the elephants are the governments of Japan and the United States , and Hirshberg and others are watching warily to see if a full-fledged trade war breaks_out between them . A trade war would be particularly disastrous for California , which has stronger trade ties to Japan than other states and whose fragile economy is only now starting to rebound after several years of recession . Trade with Japan supports about 340 # 400 state jobs , including those of 146 # 400 people employed by Japanese-owned companies . Japan accounts_for $ 27.3 billion in direct investments in California property , plants and equipment , a full third of the total foreign investment . Though many analysts doubt that a full-fledged commercial war will break_out , the tensions have been ratcheting up since trade talks between President Clinton and Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa broke_down last month . President Clinton is now paving the way for a potential hike in tariffs on Japanese goods sold in the United States . A senior Japanese trade official warned this week that Japan will retaliate if the United States invokes trade sanctions . Retaliatory sanctions from Japan could affect California exports , which amounted to $ 9.7 billion in 1992 . At the same time , U.S. sanctions against Japan could imperil crucial supply_lines or trading relationships for California firms , executives said . Of course , California -- which exports more to Japan than any other state -- stands to reap disproportionate benefits if the Clinton_Administration ' s policies succeed in opening_up Japanese markets . Meanwhile , state companies feel they are caught in the middle of a dispute not of their making . &quot; What the U.S. is demanding right now may_not be very fair to us , &quot; said Sadao ( Bill ) Kita , executive_director of the Japan Business Assn . in Los Angeles , which represents 640 regional companies that are owned at least in part by Japanese firms . &quot; We came here to manufacture . . . and we employ a lot of local people , &quot; Kita said . &quot; We are , in our opinion , contributing to the economic betterment of the U.S. Yet we are still considered a foreign element. &quot; A wide variety of products are now going_to Japan , including electronics , industrial machinery , medical devices and a host of agricultural products , from rice to raisins , said Akira Kitagawa , deputy director of the California trade office in Tokyo . At the same time , Japan has invested heavily in California industry . A firm that exemplifies that is the state ' s last remaining automobile plant , a 50-50 joint_venture between Toyota and General Motors Corp . in Fremont . Trade sanctions on imported auto parts would have a negative effect on costs at the plant , which employs 4 # 300 . &quot; Our most immediate concern is the impact on the cost of materials brought_in from Japan , such_as engines or drive trains &quot; that could not be sourced elsewhere , said Michael Damer , a company spokesman . It ' s unclear how such sanctions would ripple beyond the plant . One U.S. company , Ohio-based Dana Corp. , is already set to begin supplying truck frames to the plant from a factory still under construction in nearby Stockton , replacing frames now being brought_in from Japan . Sanctions only make that change more desirable . On the other hand , Dana owns two plants in Japan that supply auto parts to Japanese auto_makers . While sanctions would not directly affect those operations , the trade tensions do not help . Similarly , Apple Computer Inc. in Cupertino , which claims the No . 2 market position for personal_computers in Japan , doubts that any sanctions would affect its business there . Still , Apple does a lot of business both ways : It sells products to Japan and imports key components , including parts such_as flat-panel displays that cannot be sourced here . &quot; We have a big stake in making_sure that relations between Japan and the U.S. are smooth and professional and continue uninterrupted , &quot; an Apple spokesman said . At Nissan Design International , the 15-year-old San Diego design shop for the Japanese auto_maker , Hirshberg doubts that a trade war would jeopardize operations directly . But there could be fallout . For one thing , a strong yen would affect Nissan ' s product marketing decisions in the United States . &quot; Then there ' s the daily awkwardness of dealing with another culture intimately when you ' re standing on the soil of the ' enemy , ' &quot; he said . But there could also be benefits : Trade sanctions could force Japanese companies to move even more manufacturing , engineering or design work to the United States . The risk , however , is that a trade war could delay the recovery of Japan ' s recession-battered economy . &quot; There would be a danger of winning the battle and losing the war , &quot; Hirshberg said . For some firms -- such_as California Steel_Industries -- the Japanese ties are not obvious . Owned in part by Kawasaki Steel Corp . and by a Brazilian mining_company , California Steel does little trade with Japan and rarely imports components . Employing 920 people in part of the old Kaiser plant in Fontana , the maker of steel sheets and pipe deals mainly with California firms . But trade tensions still concern company President Takehiko Haga . &quot; Because I ' m Japanese , &quot; he said , &quot; I hope Japan and the United States keep a good relationship. &quot; In the short term , the heightened trade tensions might already be generating some regional economic benefits . As long as Japan does not impose retaliatory sanctions , the tensions may be helping California exports , because they have helped boost the value of the yen in_relation_to the dollar , said Kitagawa in the state ' s Tokyo trade office . &quot; The price of ( California ) products will be extremely cheap , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
