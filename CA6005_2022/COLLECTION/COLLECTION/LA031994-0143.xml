   <HEADLINE> BERGESON SEX-CRIME BILL GAINS MOMENTUM ; LEGISLATURE : NEWPORT BEACH SENATOR ' S ' ONE-STRIKE ' MEASURE WOULD JAIL RAPISTS , CHILD_MOLESTERS FOR LIFE . IT ' S RIDING THE GET-TOUGH WAVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the planned parole of two notorious serial rapists creating public outrage , an Orange County lawmaker has landed in the midst of the state ' s latest anti-crime crusade -- ensuring that sex offenders are jailed for life . Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) is pushing a &quot; one strike and you ' re out &quot; bill that would require first-time convicted rapists and child_molesters to spend life in prison without the possibility of parole . Although reviled by civil libertarians , the proposal seems to have election-year support . Bergeson ' s bill has gained steam with the outcry in recent days over the parole of repeat rapist Melvin A . Carter , who was released in a remote Northern California town after serving less than half his 25-year sentence . Residents of Claremont , meanwhile , protested this week after learning that Christopher Evans Hubbart -- believed to be responsible_for 50 rapes -- was to be paroled there . The two cases prompted Gov . Pete Wilson to complain that he is &quot; outraged and sickened &quot; that 250 rapists are released from prison each month under current state laws . He also began drumming_up support for Bergeson ' s &quot; one-strike &quot; bill , which is part of the governor ' s legislative package . &quot; I urge anyone concerned about brutal rapists . . . to support our ' one-strike ' legislation , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; Changing the law is the only way to give Californians the protections they need from these types of sexual predators. &quot; While the governor makes his pitch , the measure is attracting harsh criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups . &quot; It ' s absurd , &quot; said Francisco Lobaco , an ACLU legislative advocate in Sacramento . &quot; we ' ll have to oppose the bill . It just makes the sentences disproportionate for the underlying crime . The sentences are already severe. &quot; Lobaco said that felons convicted of sex crimes routinely serve consecutive prison sentences for each conviction , with additional counts adding_to their time behind bars . Rapists currently can be punished with a sentence of up_to eight years for a single count , with additional counts adding_to the sentence . Critics also suggest that the threat of life sentences for child_molesters could have a chilling effect among families that might otherwise report a problem within their midst . Moreover , some say that life sentences for crimes such_as date_rape would be too severe . But with the public in an uproar over crime , most lawmakers have been eager this year to prove they can pass tough anti-crime bills , a reality not lost on civil libertarians such_as Lobaco . &quot; All crime bills are political efforts , especially in an election year , &quot; he said . &quot; This is just one of many . It ' s unfortunate that it lacks rationality. &quot; Bergeson argues that the bill is necessary because most perpetrators of sex crimes are repeat offenders who rarely respond to rehabilitation . &quot; I don ' t want to allow them a chance at that second victim , &quot; Bergeson said . &quot; When you convict someone for rape or brutally molesting a child , that person should lose their right to freedom. &quot; She said the bill could tap into the same sort of public fury and political pressure that in recent weeks pushed the &quot; three strikes &quot; anti-crime bill through the Legislature at a break-neck pace . &quot; I think it ' s very much in keeping with the same momentum and the same sort of response , &quot; Bergeson said . &quot; People are outraged to see those convicted of violent sex crimes released back onto the streets . I ' m very optimistic it can get_through the Legislature. &quot; The bill could face its toughest test early next month , when it goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee headed by Sen . David A . Roberti ( D-Van Nuys ) , a strong civil libertarian . Roberti , however , faces a recall attempt on April 12 mounted by gun rights activists , and Capitol insiders suggest the longtime lawmaker would not be in any position to block or dramatically water_down Bergeson ' s bill . In past years , the Assembly Public Safety Committee has been the graveyard for such legislation . The committee has been reconstituted this year , however , and has shown a marked propensity for approving tougher anti-crime measures . &quot; Bills have not had the problem there that they ' ve had in the past , &quot; Bergeson said . &quot; I think that committee has become more responsive to the public outcry. &quot;</TEXT>
