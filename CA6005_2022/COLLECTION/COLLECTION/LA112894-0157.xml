   <HEADLINE> ISLAMIC MILITANTS TARGET ARAB INTELLECTUALS , ARTISTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rifaat Said used to be one of Cairo ' s best-loved men-about-town , a man who relished nothing better than a good argument . As head of Egypt ' s leftist Tegamu Party , he could always be counted_on to step_out prominently on behalf of Egypt ' s abundant ranks of the disinherited and to ridicule , with his sharp pen , the excesses of Muslim fundamentalism . But then Said started getting anonymous messages in the mail , like the one he received only a_few weeks ago : &quot; You dog , &quot; it said . &quot; I ' ll kill you , you atheist . But I will not shoot you . I ' ll cut you with my knife , and I ' ll throw your flesh to the dogs to eat , so you won ' t contaminate holy ground. &quot; Said ' s life changed dramatically after such vengeful missives from Islamic militants started pouring in . Now he travels nowhere without his six machine-gun-armed bodyguards . His daughter ducked out of his car at a traffic_light the last time she rode with him to school , overwhelmed by the gun_barrels bristling out the back window that every once in a while the guards would click , tic-tic-tic , into firing mode . Now when Said shyly lifts_up his jacket , there ' s a gun in a holster underneath it . He doesn ' t go_to parties anymore . He has nearly eliminated his lecture schedule at the American University of Cairo . He doesn ' t do weddings . Like an uneasily growing number of intellectuals and artists threatened by Islamic extremists around the Arab world , Said is_on the run , but he ' s not hiding . &quot; When they assassinated Farag Foda ( a prominent Egyptian secularist gunned_down after engaging in heated public_debates with fundamentalist leaders ) , many people stopped writing . I was the only one who continued attacking them , &quot; Said said with a little grin that seems startling under the circumstances . &quot; Of course , I feel sympathy for my wife and my children . But what shall I do ? &quot; While militant threats against writers , singers , actors and intellectuals have been a way_of_life in the Islamic world since the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ' s death decree against British author Salman Rushdie , the last few months have seen a dramatic increase , reflecting the growing schism between Arabs committed to Islamizing society and those equally bent_on maintaining free and open public discourse . The knife attack last month on the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Naguib Mahfouz pointed_up many of the debates that increasingly are polarizing Muslims at a time of traumatic political change in the Middle_East : Mahfouz was attacked as an apologist for Zionism , as a protege of America and the West , as a symbol of Egypt ' s controversial cooperation in the peace process with Israel . &quot; The target of the assailants was not the person of Mahfouz but rather the image of Egypt in the international community , &quot; commented Cairo ' s leading daily newspaper , Al Ahram . &quot; His international standing and persona are symbolic of the secular orientation of the Egyptian and Arab intelligentsia. &quot; On the other side , Cairo cleric Sheik Mohammed Ghazali , while deploring the violence against Mahfouz , lashed_out at the decision to publish for the first time this month -- against Mahfouz ' s own request -- the author ' s &quot; Children of Gebelawi , &quot; a 1959 allegorical novel about the prophets banned by Islamic decree for two decades in Egypt . The book was published in full in a special edition of the Tegamu Party ' s Al Ahali newspaper that sold like wildfire shortly after the attack on the 83-year-old writer . Al Ahram , the voice of the Egyptian government , waived the copyright that it has held dormant for 20 years and announced its own plans to serialize the book . &quot; We question ourselves about people who hate God dearly , detest Islam completely and quarrel with inspiration everywhere , &quot; Ghazali lamented of the publishers . &quot; I know of those who never had the privilege of kneeling before God , who on the contrary are happy when they hear about a new bar opening , feel sad if a new mosque is built and feel the Earth is getting narrow around them . The state destroys itself by leaving them to bark against Islam ' s caravan. &quot; Security analysts fear that the attack on Mahfouz , in which a man holding a bouquet of flowers approached the writer on the sidewalk as if to shake his hand and then stabbed him in the neck , reflects the new kind of savagery witnessed in militant fundamentalist attacks in Algeria against intellectuals , some of whom have had their throats slashed in front of their families . More_than two_dozen journalists have been assassinated in Algeria , which is locked_in an increasingly violent clash between Islamic fundamentalists and the old regime . In recent months , attacks like these have escalated . Among them : * Algerian Berber singer Lounes Matoub -- who has declared himself as &quot; neither an Arab nor a Muslim , &quot; openly professed his love of whiskey and dedicated a recent record to a fellow Berber activist assassinated by Islamic militants -- was kidnaped by militants Sept . 25 and held for two weeks . When he was released unharmed , he had a message from the Armed Islamic Group , Algeria ' s most violent Islamic faction : &quot; The villagers must understand that we are not against them but that we are fighting an illegitimate regime , &quot; it declared . &quot; We are asking them to help us and not to greet us with hunting rifles when we appear in their villages. &quot; * Four days after Matoub ' s kidnaping , Algerian pop singer Cheb Hasni was shot and killed in the western city of Oran after religious_leaders reportedly issued a fatwa , or religious ruling , ordering the death of any singers considered vulgar . * A knife-wielding man believed to be an Islamic militant stabbed popular Sudanese singer Khogali Osman to death and wounded two other artists at a union club in Khartoum on Nov . 11 , an unexpected attack in a country that already has an Islamic fundamentalist government . The Sudanese government condemned the killing and affirmed the state ' s respect for the status of artists . * Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin is under the protection of 1 # 200 police_officers assigned for her visit to France following her flight from Muslim fundamentalist death threats at_home earlier this year . Nasrin has been ordered to stand trial Dec . 10 for blaspheming Islam and has said she will eventually agree to serve a prison sentence if convicted on condition that the government can guarantee her safety in prison . The aim of such attacks by militants does not seem to be to target the individuals ' lifestyles , political analysts say , but rather to curb the ability of these intellectuals to move the body_politic in a more secular direction , either through their music , books , newspaper_columns or films . A common complaint of Muslim organizations is that access to the mass media in most Arab countries is limited to the government and government-approved organizations , most of which are essentially secular . ( Secularists in Egypt , however , complain that the government airwaves have grown too religious in an attempt to meet the demands of the militants. ) &quot; These people ( intellectuals ) do have an important secularizing influence , though in a very diffused manner , &quot; said Saad Eddin Ibrahim , a prominent Egyptian writer and professor who has written extensively on the Islamic movements . &quot; That has become very clear , I think , in the last seven or eight months , when the artistic community rose_up through its own creative work against the fanatic extremist Islamists , &quot; Ibrahim said . The writer cited a recent film by one of Egypt ' s most popular actors -- on a terrorist black list -- ridiculing Islamic militants and special anti-fundamentalist television programming during the holy month of Ramadan earlier this year . &quot; These programs have tremendous impact on public_opinion . It actually isolated the extremists , and if there was a lull or downward turn_in violence , it was mostly due_to these kinds of programs , not the government ' s security measures , &quot; Ibrahim said . Ibrahim himself has become a target of the extremists , most notably when he tried to organize a conference on Egyptian minorities in Cairo a_few months ago . The Muslim Brotherhood-dominated biweekly newspaper Al Shaab issued a call to &quot; use any means &quot; to block the conference , which was to raise the controversial issue of relations between Egypt ' s Muslims and Christian Copts . &quot; The words ' any means ' always translate to violence . That was a public invitation to any Islamist to take the law into his own hands , &quot; said Ibrahim , who at the government ' s request moved the conference to a neighboring country , Cyprus . No Islamic groups have claimed responsibility for the Mahfouz attack , and indeed , some have condemned it , although government officials say some of the perpetrators arrested or killed are linked to the outlawed Gamaa al Islamiya , or Islamic Group . Islamists have praised Mahfouz for refusing even from his hospital_bed to sanction the publishing of &quot; Children of Gebelawi. &quot; But Egypt ' s notorious Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman , the spiritual_leader of the Gamaa al Islamiya who is awaiting trial in New York in the World Trade Center bombing case , said in 1989 that Mahfouz and Rushdie were alike : &quot; Apostates , as are all_of those who speak_of Islam as evil . The judgment upon them is repentance , and for he who does not repent , death. &quot; Mahfouz apparently still takes the threat seriously . His associates say the author considers republication of the book an invitation to &quot; a second assassination attempt. &quot; Mainstream Islamic figures seem willing to give Mahfouz the benefit of the doubt . &quot; Naguib Mahfouz made a mistake 35 years ago with the novel , but he also had very respectable accomplishments since then , &quot; said Mohammed Abdel Quddous , a well-known Islamic writer in Cairo and son of the famed late novelist Hussein Abdel Quddous . Quddous said the roots of the violence against intellectuals can be traced to the violence that Arab regimes have directed at the Islamic trend . &quot; You should not ask people who are not getting their freedom to respect other people ' s freedom . The intellectuals in Algeria , for example , have an anti-Islam position , and they have welcomed the ( January , 1992 , ) cancellation of the elections &quot; in which fundamentalists would have scored a victory , Quddous said . &quot; The murder of Farag Foda was by a group that has always been chased by the government . They were not allowed freedom of expression , so it was not such a strange thing that they would react like that , &quot; he said . &quot; If there were freedom_of_speech , there would not be the need for guns . . . . But how do you expect stability to reign when there is no freedom ? &quot; In a cluttered apartment in the posh Cairo district of Zamalek , Said Ashmawi , a former chief security court judge and outspoken writer against Islamic fundamentalism , sits with his drapes drawn during the day and with an armed_guard sipping tea on a chair outside his door . Another guard , connected by walkie-talkie , sits in the apartment lobby downstairs . Ashmawi ' s name is enough to draw a snort from even the most moderate Islamist . How could they have hit Mahfouz and not touch Ashmawi , steamed one Islamic intellectual , who asked not to be identified by name . Ashmawi responds with writings on his computer , producing new treatises in which he turns fundamentalism on its head , usually by probing ideological and theological holes in the arguments of the fundamentalists . In a recent series of articles , he analyzed the traditional Koranic justification for Muslim women covering their heads with a veil and argued that it was unfounded . A Saudi magazine , Al Tawhid , responded angrily , calling him anti-Muslim . In 1980 , Egypt ' s highest religious authority branded Ashmawi an apostate , which he has regarded_as the equivalent of a death sentence . Although Ashmawi continues to publish , the strain is evident . He is nearly always angry and becomes vituperative when the issue of human_rights for the Islamic followers is raised . &quot; Have they human_rights and I haven ' t ? &quot; he fumed . &quot; After 14 years , these people ( at Al Tawhid ) are repeating all this again and saying there ' s a fatwa against me . This article is justification for any militant to execute me ! Should these people have the right to attack decent and liberal people like me , when they are unable to answer what I write ? &quot; Still , Ashmawi evidently relishes the role of attacker and says he has no plans to stop writing . &quot; I ' m living_in this dangerous situation since 1980 , and I believe I have a mission , and anyone who is looking_to fulfill his mission or to enlighten Islam and Muslims ' ideas will be subject_to something like that , &quot; he said . &quot; I believe I have to go_on . And if I am murdered , my death could be a part of my mission. &quot; Mahfouz himself has spoken only sparingly from his hospital_bed , calling_on the world not to confuse Islam with terrorism . But in his regular column for Al Ahram last month , he hinted that there is more_than enough blame to go_around . &quot; People seem to have grown intolerant_of discussion and unforgiving of difference . Each person who presents a view feels that he is an authority on the_matter and that his view is the only one and should be unanimously accepted by all . Those who object should not go unpunished , &quot; he wrote . He concluded : &quot; Long years of totalitarian rule have left their scar . We need a process of salvation that touches our very spirits. &quot;</TEXT>
