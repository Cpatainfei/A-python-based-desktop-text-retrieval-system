   <HEADLINE> DRUG COMBINATION FOUND EFFECTIVE ON PEPTIC ULCERS ; MEDICINE : A BACTERIUM LINKED TO THE MALADY CAN BE KILLED BY ANTIBIOTICS AND ACID-SUPPRESSING COMPOUNDS , A FEDERAL ADVISORY PANEL SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Peptic ulcers can be treated effectively with a recently discovered combination of antibiotics and traditional acid-suppressing drugs , a federal advisory panel concluded Wednesday , giving new hope to the estimated 25 million Americans afflicted by the disease . The combination drug treatment can eradicate the bacterium Helicobacter pylori , reducing the rate of recurrence of peptic_ulcers in up_to 90 % of patients , a panel of medical experts convened by the National Institutes of Health found . H . pylori was discovered in 1982 and researchers have since established a strong association between its presence and the development of one kind of peptic_ulcer . Peptic ulcer disease is a chronic inflammation of the stomach and duodenum , the place where the stomach joins the small_intestine . Typically , it is not life-threatening but can result in substantial suffering and economic burden . It affects as much as 10 % of the U.S. population at any given time . Historically , such ulcers were thought to be related to stress and diet . Treatment focused_on bland foods , bed rest and -- in severe cases -- hospitalization . Later , as scientific speculation about the cause of ulcers centered_on digestive secretions such_as gastric acid , the use of acid-reducing drugs known as H2 blockers became an important element in treatment . Twelve years ago , a 32-year-old resident in internal_medicine sought to turn those beliefs upside down with his discovery of a link between H . pylori and ulcers . But instead of hailing Australian doctor Barry J . Marshall ' s findings as a breakthrough , the medical Establishment challenged them at nearly every turn because they overturned deeply held medical beliefs about the cause of ulcers . The medical panel ' s conclusions Wednesday serve as a final validation of Marshall ' s discovery . Peptic ulcers are those that strike the gastrointestinal_tract . Not everyone infected with the organism develops ulcers , and individuals can develop peptic_ulcers without harboring the bacterium , scientists believe . The committee stressed that the therapy should be used only in those patients who test positive for the organism and who suffer from ulcer symptoms . Although traditional therapy has been effective in reducing or eliminating individual ulcers , the problem has tended to recur because , scientists long believed , ulcer-prone individuals were particularly vulnerable to the stress and other factors_in which the malady was thought to be rooted . Nevertheless , recent research has shown that dual and triple combinations of bismuth , an acid-reducing compound ; antibiotics , and antimicrobial drugs can successfully cure the H . pylori infection and reduce the rate of ulcer recurrence , the panel said . The most effective triple-drug therapies include bismuth and the antibiotics tetracycline and metronidazole , the group said . In some cases , resistance to metronidazole could require a substitution of amoxicillin , the panel said . The committee recommended that the drugs be administered for two weeks . &quot; While mild side_effects occur in each drug combination , they do not normally prevent patients from completing their therapy , &quot; said Dr. Tadataka Yamada , chairman of the panel . Tadataka heads the department of internal_medicine at the University of Michigan Medical_Center . The panel also found a strong link between the bacterium and other upper gastrointestinal diseases , including gastritis , an inflammation of the stomach lining that also can be cured by eliminating the organism . Finally , the panel said infection with the bacterium should be considered a risk factor for gastric cancer . But the committee found no evidence that treating the infection reduces the risk . Gastric cancer is rare in the United States but extremely common in many parts of the world . There are several tests for the bacterium , including blood_tests and a breath test that measures levels of the enzyme urease . Elevated levels usually indicate the presence of H . pylori .</TEXT>
