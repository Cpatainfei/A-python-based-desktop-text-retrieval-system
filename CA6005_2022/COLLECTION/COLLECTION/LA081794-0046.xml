   <HEADLINE> SMOG ALERTS IN ' 94 TOP PAST 2 YEARS ' TOTALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Authorities have already issued more health advisories for smoggy days so far this year in Ventura County than they have in the past two years combined , with the hot_weather spell bringing promise of more polluted days to come . The county has had six health advisories this year , in which children and athletes are cautioned to curtail outdoor exercise and the elderly and infirm are advised to stay indoors . During the previous two years , there were only four such advisories . And the hot , stagnant air in recent days is just one factor contributing to the problem , experts say . The county ' s atmospheric_conditions from this point in August through September typically bring the smoggiest period of the year in Ventura County . &quot; We ' re just now getting_into the season where we have the highest air_pollution , &quot; said Kent Field , meteorologist with the Ventura County Air_Pollution Control District . &quot; We ' ve already had more unhealthful days than we had to this point last year and we haven ' t even hit September yet. &quot; Smog levels , which peaked in Simi Valley on Friday with the highest ozone reading of the year at 155 on the Pollutant Standard Index , were not expected to exceed the unhealthful level of 100 for the rest of the week as temperatures continue to drop slightly . But the pollution levels in the inland valleys were expected to hover near the unhealthful level before climbing again in the early part of next week along with returning high_temperatures . Field could not say this far ahead whether more health advisories are expected . Along the coast , where temperatures have cooled several degrees since Sunday , smog levels were expected to remain moderate . The recent smoggy period has caused an increase in calls to area allergists , who say that people with already impaired lung capacity suffer more acutely during smoggy days . &quot; During the smog times , we see a substantial increase in hospital admissions , emergency_room admissions and outpatient visits , &quot; said Dr. Lewis Kanter , an allergist with practices in Camarillo and Thousand Oaks . &quot; Smog is a non-specific irritant , like little drops of acid that irritate the lungs , &quot; he said . &quot; So the lungs think there is something in there and they close_down the air tubes so whatever the irritant is can ' t get farther down into the lungs. &quot; For most people , Kanter said , that episode can last a_few minutes , but for asthmatics , the seizing of the lungs can be sustained much longer , developing_into a full asthmatic attack . The American Lung Assn . has made_clean air the focus of its campaign this year , said William Michael Reynolds , chairman_of_the_board for the Ventura County chapter . &quot; Since breathing is a necessity of life , all things that control the quality of air we breathe are important , &quot; he said . Field said he and others at the air_pollution district who analyze meteorological patterns had remarked in June that the conditions were right for a year of high ozone pollution concentrations . Ozone , the primary component of smog , is formed when chemicals produced by cars and industry mix_in sunlight . &quot; By the end of May and the first few days of June , we were seeing a weather pattern similar to what we have now , &quot; Field said . &quot; But the pattern is much stronger now. &quot; The smog and heat are the result of a thick high-pressure zone that has hovered over the county for the past week . The mass is a large pool of stagnant warm air that is without winds or clouds . That allows sunlight to penetrate and warm_up the ground below , but does not allow much mixing of the air , Field said . Those conditions were absent during much of the last two years , when air quality was exceptionally good . But Field said that without the stringent air_pollution controls that have dramatically reduced the production of the chemicals that cause ozone , the air quality would be much worse . &quot; It could be twice as bad right now without the controls , &quot; he said . &quot; Now , to get a first-stage alert here ( at a_level of 200 on the index ) we would have to have air brought_in from outside the county . We just don ' t produce enough of the components here to make the pollution levels that high. &quot; With each year , he said , the possibility that Ventura County will have a first-stage smog alert becomes more remote . &quot; Hopefully , we will get_to a point where we hardly ever see health advisories either , &quot; he said .
