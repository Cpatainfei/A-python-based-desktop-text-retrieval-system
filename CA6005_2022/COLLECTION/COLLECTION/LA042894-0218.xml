   <HEADLINE> A NEW BALLGAME IN NBA ; PRO BASKETBALL : AFTER THREE-YEAR BULLS_RUN , THE RACE FOR NEXT CHAMPION IS WIDE OPEN AS PLAYOFFS BEGIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Trying to find this season ' s favorite in the NBA playoffs ? Forget it . There isn ' t one . The Seattle SuperSonics ? Only in their minds . Seattle fans booed announcer Bill Walton in his last appearance and laid a 150-101 pounding on the Clippers , incensed he said the SuperSonics could lose to anyone , but that is true of every team . SuperSonic guard Gary Payton says it ' s &quot; our title to take , &quot; but opponents follow scouting reports in the playoffs and will pack the lane , daring Payton and Kendall Gill to make a jumper . The Houston Rockets ? Hakeem Olajuwon ' s effectiveness can be cut by a double-team , leaving Vernon Maxwell and his teammates open for three-point shots . And they will take them -- they set a record for three-point shots attempted and made in a season . The San Antonio Spurs ? Not unless David Robinson gets 71 every game . The East ? The Atlanta Hawks tried to fade but couldn ' t . The Chicago Bulls faltered against the weak Celtics with the best record in the conference theirs for the taking . The New York Knicks have been_on Pat Riley ' s couch so_long , they ' re cross-eyed . The Orlando Magic is young . It ' s a new , level day . With Michael Jordan , the Bulls went 15-2 , 15-7 and 15-4 in the last three postseasons , but he ' s gone and there ' s no other giant on the horizon . A look_at the matchups : WESTERN CONFERENCE No . 1 Seattle SuperSonics vs . No . 8 Denver Nuggets -- The SuperSonics had_the_best record , the best home and away records and their nine-points-a-game differential was 33 % better than the No . 2 Knicks . They would n ' t figure to have trouble with Denver ' s young players , most of whom have never played in the postseason , but they split the season series , 2-2 . Seattle Coach George Karl says 7-2 Dikembe Mutombo plays well against them and no wonder : The Sonics are cocky , take-it-to-the-hoop guys and Mutombo , though not yet a full peer to the greats as he imagines , can block shots . Look_for Karl to start complaining about Dikembe ' s elbows during warm-ups for Game 1 . No . 2 Houston Rockets vs . No . 7 Portland Trail Blazers -- The aging Trail Blazers made the Western finals three consecutive years , but were ousted in last spring ' s first round . Center Chris Dudley , who sat_out most the season with a broken ankle returns . The Rockets won the season series , 4-0 . No . 3 Phoenix Suns vs . No . 6 Golden State Warriors -- The Suns began a season-ending seven-game victory streak on April 12 . The Warriors went 8-2 and averaged 115 points with Don Nelson ' s &quot; Point Spree &quot; lineup , with no center and four players , including forwards Chris Webber and Billy Owens , sharing point guard with Latrell Sprewell . Nelson is most dangerous when no one expects anything from him , but the Suns have won 20 of the last 21 against the Warriors in Phoenix . No . 4 San Antonio Spurs vs . No . 5 Utah Jazz -- David Robinson carried the San Antonio offense as far as he could , but after a 40-16 start , they finished 15-11 . Robinson plays_on the wing , where centers can ' t match his quickness , but the Jazz used forward Karl Malone on him and won the season series , 5-0 . EASTERN CONFERENCE No . 1 Atlanta Hawks vs . No . 8 Miami Heat -- The Hawks leveled_off late in their surprising season but are a clear favorite over the Heat , which lost 12 of its last 16 . Rony Seikaly is unhappy at Coach Kevin Loughery for bringing him back slowly from an injury . Glen Rice wants more screens set for him . Managing partner Lew Schaffel says postseason is the &quot; perfect laboratory &quot; to see if Loughery should be re-hired . The Heat has been in the playoffs once before and lost all three games . No . 2 New York Knicks vs . No . 7 New Jersey Nets -- After the Nets won the season series , 4-1 , rarely noticed Jayson Williams &quot; guaranteed &quot; they would do_it again if they met in the playoffs . The Nets are younger , stronger and deeper , but the Knicks have the mystique , the brains and , thanks to Riley , the emotional scars . He suspended Anthony Mason for complaining to reporters about playing time . If the Knicks can make an occasional jumper , Riley will think_of something while the Nets are still telling people about the regular season . No . 3 Chicago Bulls vs . No . 6 Cleveland Cavaliers -- The Cavaliers without Brad Daugherty and Larry Nance amount to a first-round bye . Besides , they know the drill , having been eliminated by the Bulls in four postseasons : 1988 , 1989 , 1992 and 1993 . No . 4 Orlando Magic vs . No . 5 Indiana Pacers -- Shaquille O ' Neal , Anfernee Hardaway and Co . won 50 games and are eager in their playoff debut . But Larry Brown ' s faceless Pacers had_the_best finish in the East at 31-12 . View From the Top The Seattle SuperSonics compiled the best record in the NBA this season . A look_at how the team with the best regular-season record has fared in the last 10 years . 04 # 09 , 24 # 08 , 34 Year Team Record Result 1993-94 Seattle 63-19 1992-93 Phoenix Suns 62-20 Lost to Chicago , 4-2 , in finals 1991-92 Chicago Bulls 67-15 Defeated Portland , 4-2 , in finals . 1990-91 Portland Trail Blazers 63-19 Lost to Lakers , 4-2 , in conference finals . 1989-90 Lakers 63-19 Lost to Phoenix , 4-1 , in second round . 1988-89 Detroit Pistons 63-19 Defeated Lakers , 4-0 , in finals 1987-88 Lakers 62-20 Defeated Detroit , 4-3 , in finals 1986-87 Lakers 65-17 Defeated Boston , 4-2 , in finals 1985-86 Boston Celtics 67-15 Defeated Houston , 4-2 , in finals 1984-85 Boston Celtics 63-19 Lost to Lakers , 4-2 , in finals</TEXT>
