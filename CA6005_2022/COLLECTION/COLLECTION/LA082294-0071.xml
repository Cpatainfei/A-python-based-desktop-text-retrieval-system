   <TEXT> They rightly talk here about the talcum-soft sand of the endless beachfront and the creamy-colored buildings that line the boulevards like so many multitiered birthday_cakes . Hurricanes have come ashore dead-on , flattening huge neighborhoods in a single hour of bluster . But nothing -- not the landscape nor the architecture nor the natural disasters -- has shaped the character of this city more_than a bearded old buzzard who has not set foot here in 40 years . Miami is Fidel Castro ' s communist revolution turned inside out , the capital of a Cuban diaspora that has managed to turn a dowdy , one-season tourist town into a U.S. gateway for Latin_American profit-making . Miami and Havana stare at each other across the Florida Straits -- Cubans here , Cubans there -- one heart with two opposing brains . As if in some bizarre time warp , the Cold_War lives on in the moist , subtropical air . Rarely has this been more true than in the past two weeks . Castro has once again opened the exits for his disenchanted , allowing thousands to flee the island in makeshift vessels . Some of the tiny craft are no more_than a wooden plank atop two inner_tubes strung together with twine . The impromptu sailors aboard them have come_to be called balseros , or the rafters . Their haphazard crossing presents too chaotic an exodus for America ' s orderly immigration policy . This is very much as Castro wants it . For a generation , the United States has tried to choke his revolution with a trade_embargo . He owes Uncle_Sam no favors . In the resulting havoc , President Clinton has issued an extraordinary decree . Arriving Cubans will no longer enjoy the special status that long has given them automatic asylum . In fact , the U.S. Coast Guard now intercepts the balseros and delivers them to Guantanamo , the U.S. naval base in Cuba . Clinton ' s decision is a source of trauma and confusion for the 560 # 000 Cuban Americans in Miami , so ready to welcome their freedom-seeking brethren , so cautious about the tricks of a wily nemesis that many here mythologize . &quot; Wait and see , Castro will outsmart Clinton , &quot; said Rafael Penalver , a Miami attorney and Cuban activist . &quot; This has all been a Castro show designed to get Clinton to the negotiating table and toss Fidel a lifeline . &quot; Within a_few weeks , Castro will announce some meaningless elections . It will tempt Clinton with a chance to look tough and claim a victory , as if he stopped the exodus and led Cuba down the path to democracy. &quot; There ' s no evidence to support such a theory , but this grand theme of a sly , all-powerful Fidel recurs here always , constant as the palm fronds and the palmetto bugs . Castro , the evil genius . Castro , history ' s great survivor . It is presumed that U.S. presidents are no match for him . The inexperienced John F . Kennedy is still blamed for failing to support a refugee brigade with air_power during the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 . For a time , Ronald Reagan was singularly thought to be Fidel ' s equal . Cubans here called him El Machaso -- the great macho . But Reagan came and went and Castro remained . So what is crafty Fidel up_to this time , with the balseros ? Cubans here do not want a repeat of 1980 . Back then , Castro opened the Mariel harbor . Miami ' s exiles rushed over there in boats , ferrying some 125 # 000 new refugees away in a ragtag armada of skiffs , racing sloops , sailboats and shrimpers . In the simplicity of that exultant spring , the armada was called the &quot; freedom flotilla. &quot; In a flurry of affection , the refugees were dubbed the Marielitos . But , slowly , Castro ' s trick became apparent . Along with the poor , huddled masses he had sent a_few thousand criminals . The poor needed schools , shelter and medical_care . The criminals required guns , drugs and victims . Miami ' s earlier Cubans had come_to pride themselves on their up-by-the-bootstraps prosperity . They had been model citizens . Suddenly , with the Marielitos , Miami was the host city to an en masse Cuban prison break . &quot; The people from Mariel were also generally darker-skinned and not so well-dressed and not so well-educated , &quot; said Arturo Villar , who does market studies specializing in Cuba . &quot; There was a negative reaction. &quot; The endearing term Marielito was soon used as a slur . So , these past few weeks , with hundreds of Cubans arriving on rafts , local concerns were obvious . How many balseros were coming ? And just who was it that Fidel was sending ? As these latest refugees were plucked from the sea , it was hard to greet them with anything but admiration . They had cast their fates to the Gulf_Stream in perilous journeys that had taken one to 10 days . They emerged gaunt and sun-dried , their skin cracked with sores and burns . They looked_like human salt sticks , their bodies stiff from hanging_on as they bobbed . One 8-year-old boy , Daniel Bussot , was rescued alone , clinging_to a piece of wood . A squall had swamped his boat just after his mother gave him the only life_jacket aboard . His parents died in the cruel pitch of the waves . &quot; I hollered for my mom and dad , and they didn ' t turn_up , &quot; he said . Adis Sedeno , a 22-year-old mother , told a common story after seven days at_sea . &quot; Imagine what it is like now in Cuba , &quot; she said of the reasons for risking her life . &quot; Medical_care , clothing , food -- there is nothing there . There is nothing of everything. &quot; In her arms was her 1-year-old , Gustavo Antonio , his buttocks blistered with sunburn . &quot; There were 29 of us , seven of them children . We had to breathe the fumes from the motor . Everyone was vomiting all_the time. &quot; Jeremias Rangel , 24 , set_out with nine others . It was their seventh attempt to leave . On earlier tries , their rafts broke_apart in the surf . Eventually , they launched from a swampy , mosquito-infested spit of coastline . Rangel ' s wife was left_behind . He thought she should wait for a better boat . Now , under Clinton ' s new policy , it is unclear if she can ever come_to America . He phoned her from a friend ' s house , west of Miami . Her father answered . &quot; Forgive me for leaving her , &quot; pleaded Rangel , a tall , angular man with a sharp chin . His wife got_on . &quot; I ' ll do anything to get there , &quot; she said in sobs . &quot; No , don ' t jump_on just any boat ! &quot; &quot; I will ! &quot; &quot; No , if God wills it , we ' ll see each other soon. &quot; The connection was impossibly bad . The phone clicked silent after three minutes . With the telling of each remarkable , wrenching tale , the complicated feelings of Miami ' s Cubans grow ever more addled . One emotion leapfrogs another . Many of the more recent arrivals , such_as the Marielitos , demand outright acceptance of the balseros , the more the merrier . They are likelier to have relatives among the rafters . Some Cubans , on the other hand , suggest it is better for the balseros to stay_on the island . They say that if the end of Castro ' s 35-year-old regime is in_sight , the disaffected could speed his downfall as foot_soldiers in a counterrevolution . &quot; Of course , that is an immoral position , easy to propose by Cubans here who are comfortable and well-fed , &quot; said Maria Christina Herrera , an outspoken college professor in Miami . &quot; Let them live there and say it. &quot; By the nose-counting of pollsters , the majority of Miami residents agree with Clinton ' s new Cuban refugee policy . It has the support of city and state officials , as well as the benediction of the Cuban American National Foundation , a powerful lobbying group whose chairman , Jorge Mas Canosa , has commended himself as a fitting successor to Fidel . Nevertheless , nearly all Cubans blanch at the idea of fugitives from Castro being held behind barbed_wire in U.S. custody . Some balseros have already been taken_to the Krome Detention Center , at the edge of the Everglades . They were photographed in familiar orange jumpsuits as protesters rallied at the gate . Thousands of others will doubtlessly end_up at Guantanamo . This kind of treatment most commonly has been observed here with Haitian refugees , themselves desperate , impoverished boat people , nearly 15 # 000 of whom have been amassed at Guantanamo since July 5 . Last week , mobs of the frustrated detainees pelted their U.S. guards with rocks and bed frames . The Haitians ' dilemma has never been a great passion of Miami ' s Cubans . In fact , the idea of the two refugee groups detained together summons some deep prejudices . &quot; We don ' t want our people in Guantanamo with a bunch of Haitians who are_full of AIDS , &quot; said Juan Lopez , 23 , who came_on the Mariel boat lift . Oddly enough , the mingling of the two refugee groups also has provided Cuban Americans with a kind of middle ground , a way to agree with the President ' s new policy and to condemn it at_the_same_time . &quot; If Clinton wants to treat Cubans like Haitians , then let ' s equate the entire situation , &quot; said Julio Sanchez , a truck_driver . &quot; He should get the United Nations to blockade Cuba , just like with Haiti , and he should threaten to invade unless Castro steps down. &quot; That sentiment has been repeated time and again at small demonstrations around the city . A petition is being circulated along Calle Ocho , the main_street through the neighborhood known as Little Havana . Protesters gather near a memorial for those refugees killed at the Bay of Pigs . On some handmade signs , the ' C ' in Clinton is represented with a hammer_and_sickle . Hunger strikers have forsworn any sustenance but cigarettes and Cuban coffee . Children chant , &quot; Cuba si , Castro no ! &quot; A woman with a candle strays down the street and lights it before a statue of the Blessed Mother . Every so often , the crowd of 75 blocks traffic for five minutes or so . Drivers do not seem to mind . &quot; We are all balseros , &quot; one of them , Julio Cesar , said with considerable statesmanship , as if announcing : &quot; Ich bin ein Berliner . &quot; Once , late in the day , the crowd began to argue about which flag -- America ' s or Cuba ' s -- ought to be flown_higher . It was an interesting question . &quot; I ' ll tell you this , &quot; said Manuel Coll , at age 60 a pot-bellied , overheated man . &quot; If Clinton gets_rid_of Castro , I guarantee you that Miami will turn American again . We Cubans will all go back. &quot; Actually , surveys show that only 5 % to 10 % would return for good . Cuban roots have sunk deep in Miami . A generation has grown_up with memories of Super Bowls and Bruce Springsteen and suburban malls . In the old days , Havana had been like Miami ' s older half-brother , a place of rumbas and rum , gambling and sin , where a guy like Sky Masterson could bring a doll for a torrid weekend . Today , Havana is austere , hungry , wanting : a pitiable , woebegone relative . Miami is flush and glamorous , with foreign tourists poking their toes in the ocean and fashion_models posing under the street_lamps . Latinos are in the majority here , with the percentage going_up . Slightly more_than half of the nation ' s Cuban Americans live_in greater Miami , according to Thomas Boswell , a geographer at the University of Miami . Cuban Americans make_up 39 % of the city ' s population of 350 # 000 , according to the 1990 census . Other Latinos flock here as well . There are 74 # 000 Nicaraguans , 69 # 000 Puerto Ricans , 54 # 000 Colombians , 23 # 000 Dominicans , 23 # 000 Mexicans . Of late , these other groups have been arriving the fastest . In 1970 , 83 % of Dade County ' s Latino population was Cuban ; in 1990 , it was 59 % . But it is the Cuban Americans who wield the power , in business and culture and politics . They have three representatives in Congress . Well-established now , their community has had time to mature . A younger generation is not as scarred by exile , as torn between worlds . Extremism in the defense of libertad is now a vice . Moderation has begun to emerge . It is even possible to urge negotiations with Castro without fear of violent reprisal . &quot; There are so few communist countries left , and the U.S. has come_to terms with the others , why not Cuba ? &quot; said Herrera . Six years ago , her home was bombed after she made similar statements . Such intolerance was once the practice . In 1976 , a car_bomb blew_off the legs of popular radio newscaster Emilio Milian . He had dared to criticize anti-Castro terrorist bombings that had swept the city . In 1979 , and again in 1982 , bombs_blasted through the walls of a cigar factory owned by Orlando Padron , who had earlier visited Cuba to negotiate the release of political_prisoners . The cigar maker was photographed handing a stogie to Castro . Such memories seem somehow distant now , from some blurry time when communism was fully potent and red predators appeared to be nibbling at the globe . There are still limits , however . And there always will be as long as Castro stays in power . In April , Miami lawyer Magda Montiel Davis went_to Havana , attending a three-day conference_called Emigration and the Nation . On a widely circulated videotape , she is shown at a reception greeting Castro with a kiss on the cheek . Afterward , back here , her life was threatened . Crowds gathered outside her home_in protest . Six secretaries at her firm -- all Latinas -- quit in protest . Some things remain unforgivable , like kissing that demon Fidel , the face that launched a_thousand rafts .</TEXT>
