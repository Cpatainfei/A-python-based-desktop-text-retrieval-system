   <HEADLINE> DEADBEAT PARENTS PLAN EXPANDED ; CHILD_SUPPORT : STATE ' S SUCCESSFUL PILOT_PROGRAM THAT GARNISHES WAGES WILL BEGIN COLLECTIONS NATIONWIDE . AIM IS TO TAKE IN $ 103 MILLION FROM 11 # 600 TARGETED DELINQUENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California , a state that has long harbored one of the worst records for collecting child_support payments , this week will extend the reach of its highly successful pilot collection program and begin tapping into deadbeat parents ' wages nationwide . The expanded program , to be announced Monday by Controller Gray Davis , authorizes collection agencies to garnish wages to support children in six California counties even if the parent has moved_out of state . The California wage-garnishing pilot_program , launched five months ago , has collected $ 11.2 million and is being reviewed by the Clinton_Administration for possible inclusion in the President ' s new welfare program , according to Carol Thorp , spokeswoman for the controller ' s office . The expanded program ' s aim is to take_in $ 103 million from 11 # 600 targeted parents living outside the state -- a particularly intransigent group , according to the General Accounting Office , the investigative arm of Congress . Nearly a third of child_support cases involve out-of-state fathers , who turn_over only 10 % of the child_support money collected , the GAO said . California ' s pilot_program has district_attorneys forward the toughest collection cases to the state ' s Franchise_Tax Board , which then taps computer_databases also used to collect delinquent state taxes -- databases that can ferret_out virtually anyone with a Social_Security_number . Although district_attorneys must go_to the courts to garnish any wage or income , a process that often takes a year or longer , the tax board is able to tap wages immediately . So far , 12 # 000 families , most of them in Los Angeles County , have benefited from the program , and a majority of the cases referred to the tax board have resulted in payments , the controller spokeswoman said . &quot; California is still in the backwaters of child_support , &quot; Davis said , acknowledging the state ' s hefty $ 3 billion in unpaid court-ordered child_support payments . &quot; But our new program is a model for the nation , &quot; he said , adding that it is aimed at reducing the state ' s burgeoning welfare rolls . The pilot_program is operating in Los Angeles , Ventura , Santa Clara , Fresno , Solano and Nevada counties , but legislation introduced into the Assembly last week would expand it statewide . A White_House task_force on welfare reform has said that only $ 13 billion is collected in child_support in the United States each year , although the potential exceeds $ 47 billion . And census figures show that about a quarter of women eligible for child_support receive the full amount they are owed . California has long been a golden_state for parents who don ' t want to pay child_support . Although most states do little to force scofflaw parents to meet their obligations , California has one of the least effective child_support systems in the country , a 1992 report by Children Now , a California advocacy group , found . In 1990 , it said , only 39 % of child_support orders tracked by district_attorneys resulted in any payment , a figure that has improved somewhat since then . In Los Angeles County , only 37 % of the support ordered in 1987 was paid , a figure that dropped to 34 % by 1990 , the study said . A 1991 study by the House Ways and Means Committee gave the state an overall grade of D and ranked it 47th in the country in several key indicators of how effectively its child_support program was run . Fathers make_up 93 % of the child_support scofflaws in the state . &quot; If they use the greater resources of the tax_system to identify where people are , it becomes much easier to get a collection , &quot; said Joseph Liu , director for policy at Children Now , adding that district_attorneys offices that are overwhelmed dealing with violent crimes often do not aggressively push child_support prosecutions or they lack the tax board ' s tools and records to track_down parents . Prosecutions have been stepped_up , in part for fiscal reasons : California ' s welfare system through court actions recovered about $ 300 million in payments in fiscal 1993 . About half of the money collected by the pilot_program is returned to the government to reimburse it for past welfare payments . Los Angeles mother Valencia Robins said she was unable to get any child_support payments through the district_attorney and was reduced to living_in a Torrance homeless shelter for two months with her daughters , 4 and 1 , then went_on welfare . The daughters ' father , a professional rapper , would not pay child_support , she says . The state ' s tax board was able to find his bank_account and collect $ 105 # 000 in child_support payments , of which about $ 20 # 000 went_to reimburse the government for past welfare payments to Robins . &quot; They changed my life . I don ' t have to worry about where the kids ' next meal will come from , &quot; said Robins , 24 , who is now taking courses to prepare_for nursing_school . California has used other techniques to battle the problem . It has begun denying professional licenses to child_support delinquents and last year required that all hospitals offer fathers the option of signing birth_certificates , a measure that helps to establish paternity . Other states have tried other techniques : A Massachusetts initiative called the &quot; 10 Most Wanted &quot; project hangs posters with mug_shots and the names of 10 child_support delinquents on billboards and in subways in an effort to shame people into paying_up . But other states have balked at the increasingly assertive measures , raising concerns that tougher measures give the government too_much power and that some approaches only drag men who owe child_support into poverty . Idaho ' s lawmakers this year killed a bill that would have revoked driver ' s licenses of those who failed to make child_support payments .</TEXT>
