   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES ; COMMENTARY ON HEALTH_CARE ; BY DYING ON HIS OWN TERMS , NIXON LEAVES ANOTHER LEGACY ; THE FORMER PRESIDENT ' S REFUSAL OF ARTIFICIAL LIFE SUPPORT POINTS TO PRIMACY OF THE INDIVIDUAL DECISION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In death as in life , we can learn from former President Richard M . Nixon . His refusing artificial life support has fueled the debate over medical_care for the terminally ill . Nixon ' s advance directive was a deeply personal , appropriately selfish act , an acknowledgment that , at a time when critical medical decisions must be made , our loved ones may be emotionally overwhelmed and unable to provide appropriate guidance to the physician . Physicians , too , may have difficulty &quot; letting_go &quot; of a patient they have cared_for for many years . Modern medicine has created public expectations of positive outcomes -- only positive outcomes . Repeated polling shows broad public support for physician-assisted dying ( suicide raises other issues not covered here ) . Yet , despite a federal law requiring patients be informed of their right to refuse end-of-life treatments , few exercise this crucial basic right to make their own final_decisions by signing a simple document , the Durable Power_of_Attorney for Health_Care . The form was developed by the California Medical Assn . and can be filled_out by anyone . Making such determinations is the most private of decisions and underscores the essence of the physician-patient relationship . It becomes the bridge between life and death when the patient is unable to express his or her own desires . Patients and physicians must reach a consensus soon and define reasonable and flexible guidelines for the care of those who have not already expressed their wishes . If we do not , those riding the crest of the health_care cost-containment wave may make the decision for us . From my perspective , I was trained to cure , not retreat from attacking illnesses such_as cancer , AIDS , heart_disease , Alzheimer ' s and sudden violence . It can literally be a fight to the death and my reflex is to attack disease aggressively unless it is clear my patient wants otherwise . As a physician , it is very difficult to not do what I was trained to do . Also , many patients with a strong desire to live survive far beyond the medical norm . But in my training , I learned the foremost dictum of medicine -- primum non nocere -- first , do no harm . As a general internist with many older patients and as a hospice medical director , I have dealt extensively with these issues . Despite clear patient directives to their family and to me , I have revisited the entire process with aggrieved spouses or children still unwilling to let their loved one go , acting_as referee in a very emotional family debate . In cases where no directive was given , how far can a physician go_in advocating for the silent patient who previously confided their wishes to their physician ? In practice , most Americans support &quot; ending life &quot; when artificial life support will only delay death -- but not with their loved one . Physicians and families should ask &quot; are we providing these treatments for the patient or for ourselves ? &quot; Nixon ' s dying should compel us all to make our choices before the grief and trauma of our condition puts our families and physicians in doubt , or worse , in conflict . After all , choosing how we want to die is exercising the same responsibility we take_in daily living . There are other parts of this decision-making process , including psychological and spiritual care and unfortunately , fear of hindsight . Physicians and health-care facilities still fear lawsuits by family members opposing the patient ' s expressed wishes . Patients , physicians and other impacted providers must join this debate in_earnest . The advance directive is perhaps the most personal and individual of decisions . Family concerns matter , but the individual should make the call . Fortunately , the focus has already begun shifting toward palliative care , the relief of pain and suffering . The end-of-life debate also has raised government ' s consciousness , with the issuance of new federal pain management guidelines . The health_care marketplace is evolving , supporting more appropriate vehicles for end-of-life care . For example , hospice care gives the terminally ill their right of self-determination and is a cost-effective alternative for such care . Almost all patients prefer to spend their final days at_home , rather than in a hospital . The pejorative term &quot; futile care &quot; may suggest health_care rationing but what it really means is care that does not work . The development of scientifically valid , uniform standards and protocols would help us all . Patients and their families could , with the aid of their physicians , make rational decisions regarding care at the end of life . The serious ethical and moral issues that arise when advances in medical technology conflict with a patient ' s stated desire to refuse such care could be addressed in a more rational context . A bill to help address this issue is currently pending in our state Legislature . Until we come_to a consensus on end-of-life treatment and care , we should promote the primacy of the individual decision made by President Nixon and involve the public in this debate . If we address these issues now , the next generation of Americans and their physicians will be_better able to come_to terms with saying_farewell to our loved ones .</TEXT>
