   <HEADLINE> NO QUITTING ; DESPITE SETBACKS , BASKETBALL_PLAYER CINDY BROWN WON ' T GIVE_UP ON RECOVERING FROM AUTO ACCIDENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cindy Brown ' s head hit the windshield and snapped down into the steering_wheel . Her thoughts screamed inside her brain . &quot; Oh my God , there goes my contract ! &quot; Her contract . She had played basketball for five months in Japan and , with bonuses , earned $ 125 # 000 . Not_bad for a 25-year-old who was three years out of college . She had been warned . A coach at Long_Beach State told her to insure her body because it was her living . But she was in her best shape ever . She had already won a gold medal in the 1988 Olympic Games , but had skipped the University Games and missed the Goodwill Games with a bum knee . Still , there was no need to dial Lloyds of London . And then she was rear-ended by a drunk driver in the summer of 1991 . He had a prior arrest and fled , but was apprehended . He got two years of probation , four days in jail and a fine . He never paid restitution . Brown ' s career , for all practical purposes , ended that day in Garden Grove . She suffered severe whiplash , a chipped cervical disk and pinched nerve in her back that made her right arm numb , and she had no feeling in two fingers of her shooting hand . She missed the Pan Am Games . She forfeited $ 175 # 000 of a $ 200 # 000 contract_in Japan . She missed the 1992 Olympic Games . &quot; I felt very angry , very cheated by the system , &quot; she said this week from her Villa Park home . &quot; I felt justice hadn ' t been served . I felt he was totally irresponsible -- he not only endangered his life but mine and everyone else ' s , and he also ruined my career . I sustained a great loss because of him . &quot; Nothing has been the same since. &quot; It really hasn ' t . Brown did almost everything that can be done_in women ' s basketball . She set an NCAA Division I record with 60 points in a game and averaged 21.1 over a 128-game career at Long_Beach State . She twice was a first-team Naismith All-American selection and a first-team Kodak All-American . She was the most_valuable_player of the 1987 NCAA Western Regionals . She was inducted into the 49er Hall_of_Fame in 1992 . She was good . Really good . And nothing has been the same since . Instead of international competition against the best women on the planet , Brown now plays pickup games against the guys down at Mile Square Park . But that might change . Now 29 , mature , and at_ease , she ' s mounting her comeback . She has a workout station in her home and a hoop in her driveway and a goal to reach the Pan American Games and then , one more time , the Olympics . &quot; I ' ve kind of been out_of_sight , out of mind , &quot; Brown said . &quot; I hope to change that because I really have had the strong desire to play . I ' ve never lost that drive . I still have a lot of fight to be No . 1 . I just hope I have the opportunity to show that. &quot; It will be a great comeback story if it takes_place . After the accident , she missed her third international competition in a row , the Pan Am Games ; she had already missed the 1989 University Games when she took a year off to recover from physical burnout , and the ' 90 Goodwill Games with a bad knee . She returned to Japan in 1992 , but took a big financial hit -- management thought she was either washed_up or would n ' t recover from the accident . She later had foot surgery . Japan changed its policies regarding American players a year later and most headed to Europe , but Brown ' s big-money $ 225 # 000 contract made her an expendable prospect in the cheaper Italian leagues . She did join Faenza Errieti for the final eight games of the 1992 season , helping raise the team from 13th to ninth place in the standings , an increase that allowed it to maintain its sponsorship , which would have been lost had it finished lower than 12th . But the Eastern Bloc countries began allowing players to join the European leagues , Brown said , and 6-2 , 175-pound power forwards weren ' t a premium -- not when cheaper Czech and Russian athletes were available -- so she never got another chance in Italy . So Brown has waited in Orange County and trained to compete this summer . But she was dogged by fatigue . She thought it might be mononucleosis , but doctors eventually found a lump on her neck that turned_out to be a benign thyroid goiter . It was removed in June . There are four others she ' s keeping_an_eye_on . She says she ' s in shape . The knee and foot are healed . The accident is behind her . The Pan Am Games are in March , and Brown will seek a position on the team . She grew_up in Portland , Ore. , and will play for a Portland AAU team that will face NCAA competition this winter . She will take another shot in Europe and explain that , yeah , she ' s affordable . She will try to prove she can play again . She will try to prove she can be an Olympian again . &quot; The more I try , &quot; Brown said , &quot; the harder it is to get_ahead , but I ' m ready to face whatever ' s ahead. &quot; She is asked a question she has not heard before . It ' s about the defining moment of her life . &quot; I wonder if I ' ve even hit that point , &quot; she said . &quot; I still feel very young of mind and open and eager to learn . I don ' t know if I can honestly answer that . It ' s a darn good question , but I don ' t know if I ' m there yet . &quot; I think I ' ve overcome so_much and can still overcome a lot more. &quot;</TEXT>
