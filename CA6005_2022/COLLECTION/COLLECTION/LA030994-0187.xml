   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG : NEW ABC SHOW , OLD TV PLOY ; TELEVISION : ' TURNING POINT ' PREMIERES TONIGHT BY EVOKING THE SPECTER OF CHARLES MANSON . that ' s ONE WAY FOR THE NETWORK TO ENSURE NOTICE FOR ITS NEWSMAGAZINE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Travels with Charlie . . . . The grin , so twisted and sinister . The eyes , shiny black_currants under a tiny swastika branded into his forehead . The rambling rages , right on cue . The great thing about Charlie Manson is that he ' s always there for you . He ' s steady , he ' s reliable . Like a coat on a hook , he ' s accessible . He ' s been there for Geraldo Rivera . He ' s been there for &quot; Hard Copy. &quot; He ' s been there for &quot; A Current Affair. &quot; And if you ' ve a new series that you want to launch with a bankable sociopath who knows from years of experience how to put_on a good show for the camera , he ' ll be there for you , too . Take tonight , for example . Diane Sawyer to Charlie : &quot; Is Charlie Manson crazy ? &quot; Charlie to Diane : &quot; Sure he ' s crazy , mad as a hatter , what difference does_it make ? You know , a long_time ago , being crazy meant something . Nowadays everybody ' s crazy. &quot; * At last , sane words from the 59-year-old wild_man . Nowadays everybody is crazy . At least you can get that impression from watching television . Don ' t be too hard on the ABC News_program &quot; Turning Point &quot; for starting life as a weekly series tonight with an hour titled &quot; The Manson Women : Inside the Murders. &quot; The producers may have had no choice . Jeffrey Dahmer probably wasn ' t available . &quot; Dateline NBC &quot; had him Tuesday night . Actually , long-imprisoned , middle-aged &quot; Manson girls &quot; Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel get the bulk of camera time with Sawyer on &quot; Turning Point. &quot; But Manson haunts the entire hour , and the manacled life-termer is occasionally trotted in from the wings to provide just the right touch of deranged frenzy . The women are interesting studies , and you have to hand it to &quot; Turning Point &quot; for knowing how to suspensefully restage grisly homicide . But why a program that recounts the 1969 Tate-LaBianca murders for the umpteenth time without adding any real insight ? Why put this foot forward ? Why not open the series with a fresher topic instead of exhuming America ' s preeminent bogyman and his former disciples ? Because this is the age of screaming tabloid sensationalism . ABC apparently felt that its zillion-dollar co-anchor Sawyer alone could not be counted_on to hold the expected big audience from the preceding &quot; Home Improvement &quot; and &quot; Grace Under Fire. &quot; Not when the furor over the scheduled parole of an Oregon murderer is the theme of competing &quot; 48 Hours &quot; on CBS and five homicides are the grist of NBC ' s &quot; Law &amp; Order. &quot; No , evoking the specter of the creepy Manson was the only way for ABC to ensure that its new program gets noticed . And listen , if it works , and &quot; Turning Point &quot; survives , hand_out the party_favors and bring these kids back for the anniversary show . It ' s what happens when everybody is crazy . Quiet Thunder : In a curious way , TV is constantly in transition -- a succession of turning points , shifting from one familiarity to another . ABC ' s new comedy series &quot; Thunder Alley , &quot; for example , perpetuates the impression of prime_time being a sprawling day-care center . The premiere tonight introduces Ed Asner as Gil Jones , a former race_car driver whose routine is disrupted when his divorced daughter ( Diane Venora ) and her three children come_to live with him in the apartment above the garage he operates . The 65-year-old Gil ' s biggest fear is that the grandkids will damage his classic record collection , and he and his daughter clash over child rearing . For awhile , his general surliness and lack of affection make him refreshingly unlikable , but ultimately he sheds this disguise and reveals himself to be one of TV ' s stock characters , the grouch with a heart of cotton_candy . Asner is a very good actor whose track record is proof that all he needs to make audiences laugh is a funny script . But his opening is much less humorous than humdrum , and the comic lightning implicit_in the title fails to strike . * Deadly Games : What do &quot; Beavis and Butt-head &quot; and the Oscar-winning &quot; The Deer Hunter &quot; have in common ? Perhaps nothing , perhaps everything . When MTV ' s mentally challenged cartoon stars were accused of being an evil influence on the younger set , MTV yanked these primitives from their early-evening time_slot and redeployed them later in the evening . A reasonable move . Yet was KTLA-TV Channel 5 acting reasonably in airing &quot; The Deer Hunter &quot; as a two-parter in its 8-10 p.m. movie slot Monday and Tuesday ? Wasn ' t this the same &quot; The Deer Hunter &quot; whose extended , incredibly violent Russian roulette sequences were blamed for a string of Russian roulette fatalities that occurred after the Vietnam movie was widely shown on TV in the early 1980s ? You hate even to consider restricting work as memorable as &quot; The Deer Hunter. &quot; Despite charges when it was released that the Russian roulette sequences distorted reality , they were brilliantly executed and anything but gratuitous . Moreover , it ' s impossible for TV to guard against all negative influences , given that a deranged viewer conceivably could imagine getting a violent message from something as benign as ABC ' s &quot; Full House. &quot; Yet when a violent movie seems to have inspired gun-shooting copycats in the past -- when there appears to be a demonstrable record of it -- isn ' t it irresponsible to return it to TV ? For whatever reason , &quot; The Deer Hunter &quot; seems to have a destructive impact on a handful of viewers . Removing the Russian roulette sequences would be creative butchery and would render much of the movie incomprehensible . Yet showing them may result in real-life butchery .</TEXT>
