   <HEADLINE> CLINTON PLANS ULTIMATUM FOR TOP HAITI MILITARY ; CARIBBEAN : U.S. CONSIDERING WHEN , HOW TO ISSUE WARNING . MOVE WOULD BE IN HOPES OF AVOIDING INVASION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton plans to issue a public ultimatum to Haiti ' s military_leaders to step_down or face a U.S. invasion -- but not just yet , officials said Thursday . Clinton and his top aides reached &quot; a general consensus &quot; in favor of sending an ultimatum during a White_House meeting this week , but they are still considering when and how to do_it . Although the officials refused to say when the ultimatum might be sent , their comments indicated that any military_action in Haiti is several weeks away at least . &quot; These are all measures we might take at the end of the line , and we ' re probably not at that point yet , &quot; one senior official said . A probable course , one official said , would be to send the Haitians a private message first -- through U.S. diplomats in Haiti , intelligence_agents or indirect contacts -- followed by a public ultimatum with a short deadline , perhaps as short as 24 or 48 hours . &quot; ( We ) might give them a little time to think_about it -- a very little time , &quot; one official said . &quot; We ' ve been warning them for three years now , so they shouldn ' t need much. &quot; The private message , another official said , might include a concrete offer to the top Haitian military_officers of safe transportation into exile for themselves and their families . Officials gave two reasons for giving the Haitian leaders a final , formal warning : to increase the chance that they will give_up power peacefully and avoid a U.S. invasion , and to make clear to both the American public and other countries that the United States sought every possible non-military solution to the Haitian problem . But after debating the issue , Clinton and his aides agreed that issuing the ultimatum now -- or setting a deadline well in_advance -- was a bad idea . The Pentagon fears that setting a specific date for U.S. military_action might eliminate any element of surprise and limit its flexibility in conducting military operations , one official said . U.S. diplomats fear that giving a deadline would merely encourage the Haitians to ignore the threat for a_few weeks more . And Haitian opposition leaders say they have been warned that in the event of an ultimatum , the regime ' s forces will murder them in a final act of retribution or take them hostage in an effort to forestall an invasion . The Administration has already warned the military regime that any roundup of opposition leaders could touch_off a &quot; hair-trigger &quot; U.S. invasion . But Haitian democrats say they are increasingly concerned that the mounting rhetoric from Washington , coupled with the lack of action against the regime , is putting their lives in peril . * In a bit of saber-rattling , a senior official told reporters that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , met this week with Haiti ' s exiled president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide , to brief him on U.S. invasion plans . &quot; We are reviewing military planning , and it was appropriate to include the constitutional president of Haiti in the process , &quot; the official said , adding that Shalikashvili ' s briefing included maps and charts . And the Pentagon announced that it has activated seven large cargo_ships for transporting weapons and supplies to support a Haiti invasion force . A Pentagon spokesman , Air_Force Col . Doug Kennett , said the seven &quot; roll-on , roll-off &quot; ships from a fleet of ships kept_in mothballs for short-notice deployment would be ready for loading in four days . Activating the ships is &quot; part of preparations for potential operations in Haiti should they be needed , &quot; Kennett said . The ships , which are 600 feet to 700 feet long and carry a crew of about 30 , are capable of carrying tanks , artillery and other heavy military gear needed to support an invasion force . They are currently in ports in Baltimore ; Jacksonville , Fla. ; Wilmington , Del. , and Beaumont and Orange , Tex . Once they are ready to sail , they will be loaded at ports near the military_installations housing the troops that would lead the invasion . White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Clinton intends to consult with members of Congress about his intentions toward Haiti , but he does not plan to seek a vote formally authorizing the use of U.S. troops there . &quot; It is important to the President that he work with Congress , which is why he ' s done that throughout this policy , not just on Haiti but across the board on foreign_policy , &quot; she said . &quot; He believes that there ought to be outreach to both sides of the aisle , to Republicans as well as Democrats , and that ' s something that he ' ll continue to do. &quot; Former President George_Bush also contended that he did not need congressional approval for the much larger Persian_Gulf_War , but sought a formal endorsement from Capitol_Hill to demonstrate American resolve on the eve of the invasion of Iraq . Clinton has little congressional support for military_action in Haiti , except from the 38-member Black Caucus , which has long advocated intervention against the military junta that overthrew elected President Aristide nearly three years ago .</TEXT>
