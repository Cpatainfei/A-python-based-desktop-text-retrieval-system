   <HEADLINE> 2 FORMER CARD CLUB PROMOTERS PLEAD GUILTY ; COURTS : THE ONETIME OXNARD CASINO PRINCIPALS ADMIT TO MISDEMEANOR POLITICAL MONEY_LAUNDERING AND AGREE TO PAY FINES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two former promoters of an Oxnard card casino pleaded guilty Thursday to misdemeanor money_laundering , the first case by the Ventura County district_attorney ' s year-old political corruption unit to end in conviction . Michael E . Wooten , 45 , of Camarillo and Frank Marasco , 48 , of Ventura each pleaded guilty to a single count of political money_laundering and agreed to pay fines of $ 3 # 000 apiece . They admitted violating state law by making $ 998 in small contributions indirectly to two Oxnard councilmen , one former councilwoman and a state assemblyman . The pleas were entered after prosecutors agreed to drop six money-laundering charges that each carried a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $ 10 # 000 fine . The key allegations in the six counts were incorporated into a single remaining count . Trial was set to begin Thursday . Dist . Atty . Michael D . Bradbury , who discovered the illegal contributions while investigating Oxnard card club promoters last spring , declined comment . But Deputy Dist . Atty . Jeff G . Bennett said the pleas send &quot; a message to politicians and campaign contributors alike that if you ' re going to make or accept a contribution , you had better know the law. &quot; Neither Wooten nor Marasco could be reached for comment . Their attorneys said the case was resolved fairly . But both also said the case could have been resolved more quickly as a civil prosecution , since both defendants immediately acknowledged that they had unintentionally broken the law . &quot; The minute they knew it was illegal , they admitted to the facts , &quot; said Richard Loy , who represented Wooten . &quot; This case was much to do about very little. &quot; Louis Chuck Samonsky , the lawyer for Marasco , said the fact that the case was prosecuted criminally suggests that Bradbury was politically motivated . Cases involving much more money are handled civilly in other jurisdictions , he said . &quot; I think it is closely tied to the fact that Mr. Bradbury made a statement to the Oxnard City_Council that anybody involved in card clubs has got_to be crooked , &quot; Samonsky said . &quot; And he set_about to prove that even though the great majority of this money was donated well before the card club was even conceived. &quot; Bennett declined comment on Bradbury ' s motivation . But he said the case was prosecuted appropriately . &quot; Any time we come_across this type of activity , the person involved will be investigated and prosecuted , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s been a just resolution of the whole thing. &quot; In entering their pleas , Wooten and Marasco admitted that they illegally reimbursed three former employees for contributions to former Oxnard Councilwoman Dorothy Maron ' s 1990 council race , Assemblyman Nao Takasugi ' s 1992 Assembly race , Councilman Michael Plisky ' s 1992 mayoral race and Councilman Thomas Holden ' s 1993 council race . Contributions are illegal under state law if the true identities of contributors are not revealed to candidates . Prosecutors said the candidates did not know of the Marasco and Wooten reimbursements . The businessmen , who ran the now-defunct Darrik Marten Co . of Ventura , acknowledged nearly $ 1 # 000 in illegal contributions -- about $ 500 to Maron , $ 250 to Takasugi , $ 149 to Plisky and $ 99 to Holden . A separate grand theft case against the two men is pending . But a Superior_Court judge said last week that he had tentatively decided to throw_out the charge of stealing $ 10 # 000 in a construction deal unrelated to the card club . The Oxnard City_Council considered a card casino because of its tax and job benefits , but killed the project when faced with strong community opposition and Bradbury ' s condemnation of casinos at a hearing in June . Times staff writer Dwayne Bray contributed to this report .</TEXT>
