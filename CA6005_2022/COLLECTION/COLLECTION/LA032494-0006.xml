   <TEXT> Tonya Harding ' s sentence of probation is a failure . Harding ' s conduct was wrong , and her plea bargain allows her to avoid responsibility for her actions . On March 16 , Harding said , &quot; I am concerned that to skate at ( the World Championships ) now would detract from the attention the other athletes in that competition deserve and would not be good , generally , for the sport of figure skating. &quot; would n ' t this statement have been equally true for the Olympics ? An earlier guilty plea would have removed Harding from Olympic competition . Harding should have admitted her wrongdoing prior to then , rather than waiting until now . Instead , she chose to engage in a campaign of bad-faith actions and frivolous tactics that were solely intended to obstruct justice and keep her on the Olympic team . In light of her guilty plea , it is now clear that Harding ' s appearance at the Olympics was improper and undeserved . Her utter lack of ethics and denial of personal responsibility reflected poorly on the U.S. DOUGLAS B . INMAN Santa Ana In addition to the fine , probation and community service , Harding should also be sentenced to seven appearances on &quot; Geraldo , &quot; five on &quot; Hard Copy , &quot; three on &quot; Current Affair &quot; and a tabloid to be named later . TONY PEYSER Hollywood So it appears that Nancy Kerrigan never was the queen of hearts , as she was portrayed , but rather the queen of diamonds . At least we always knew that Tonya Harding was the queen of clubs . DOUG M . LITTLETON San Marino</TEXT>
