   <HEADLINE> NUTRITION , MEDICINE MERGE IN CHAPEL HILL ; HEALTH : NORTH CAROLINA IS FIRST MEDICAL_SCHOOL TO LINK THE PROGRAMS . FOUR OF THE SIX LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH -- DIABETES , HEART_DISEASE , CANCER , OBESITY -- ARE RELATED TO EATING HABITS , PROFESSOR SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Surely , Peter Bream thought , that short segment on diet in a biochemistry course was not all his medical_school planned to teach him about nutrition . But it was . And his school , the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , was not alone in neglecting the subject . In fact , a survey of medical_school graduates conducted by the American Medical Assn . in 1990 showed that 65 % did not believe they had adequate training in nutrition . &quot; It seemed strange to me that was all that was taught , &quot; said Bream , a third-year medical_student . &quot; It never really was touched upon again. &quot; The University of North Carolina ended its neglect last year when it became the first to make its nutrition program part of the medical_school and part of the school of public health . &quot; It shows that the clinical specialties realize that nutrition has a role to play in clinical medicine , &quot; said Dr. Bruce Bistrian , professor of medicine at Harvard Medical_School and an adviser for the medical nutrition curriculum . Dr. Stuart Bondurant , dean of the University of North Carolina ' s medical_school , said having the department in both schools means nutrition study &quot; goes from the individual through the public and it goes from prevention through treatment. &quot; The training is important because about 50 % of patients who visit primary care physicians have problems related to nutrition , according to Dr. Steve Zeisel , nutrition department chairman . Four of the six leading causes of death -- diabetes , heart_disease , cancer and obesity -- are related to nutrition , he said . Specific examples are demonstrated links between high fat intake and breast_cancer , and between insufficient fiber and colon_cancer . &quot; Many doctors don ' t ask questions about diet until the patient has a heart_attack , &quot; Zeisel said . Doctors should receive enough training in nutrition to identify patients who need advice on their diets before they have heart_attacks , he said . Pairing nutrition with medicine also may benefit research projects , Zeisel said . As doctors become more familiar_with the benefits of good nutrition , they may become more active in pushing the National Institutes of Health to fund nutrition research , he said . Focusing_on nutrition also may save money , Zeisel said . &quot; It ' s not very expensive to help people learn how to eat , &quot; he said . Chapel Hill ' s nutrition department also will conduct a lot of its own research , Bondurant said . This year , the department received a grant from the National Cancer Institute to find ways to increase the intake of anti-cancer fruits and vegetables among blacks in North Carolina . And the National Institutes of Health gave the department training funds for seven students who want to be nutrition scientists . Other schools also will be able to benefit from the North Carolina program . An interactive computer course that can be used at any school will debut in a class this fall , Zeisel said . The course allows students to work with a computer-generated patient . Bream , 26 , was one of the students who tested the computer curriculum . He said the patient interaction was especially useful . &quot; You actually worked_up a patient and went_through all_the steps of the interview , the lab work and diagnosis , and you worked along with a doctor in this virtual world , &quot; he said . The nutrition classes , which began last year for first-year students , will continue through medical_school , and nutrition will be emphasized as part of a medical_student ' s course_of_study .</TEXT>
