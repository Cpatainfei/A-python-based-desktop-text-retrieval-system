   <HEADLINE> AROUND TOWN : A GIFT OF BEAUTY AND EDUCATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Marcel Proust is not on the reading list for Michael Javier ' s students . Dead French novelists don ' t figure into ESL classes at Evans Community Adult School . But Proust could have been writing_about them : &quot; Only through art can we get outside of ourselves and know another ' s view of the universe. &quot; Javier knows that . His dream -- of an art_gallery at Evans -- has just come true . In a once-empty cafeteria foyer , student art hangs where students used to post notices for used cars and mattresses . Some are first-time artists . Others once were artists in their homelands , but now are janitors or dishwashers . This is people ' s art . Colorful papier-mache masks . Pastel T-shirts that bear legends of coming_to America &quot; with only the shirt on my back. &quot; With immigrant-bashing rampant , Javier says , &quot; People need to hear their stories , to learn what our students have gone through. &quot; Javier , 33 , an artist himself , is a can-do sort who in 1988 fled the relative complacency of Reseda High for Evans , on the fringe of Downtown . Here , at any given time , the 10 # 000 students may come from 60 countries . Although rich_in diversity , it is a poor school , with no money for art_classes . Javier kept thinking_about how important it is for these students to have beauty in their lives and how art spans cultural borders . From time to time he ' d have students do art in ESL classes and would tape their work_up in what is now the gallery . Always , it would fall to the floor to be trampled . On a campus where &quot; they can ' t even afford custodians , &quot; he knew there was no way he was going_to get start-up money for a proper gallery . He went_to work . Cleaning_out his closets , he found some old frames , which he sold to another teacher for $ 100 . That would buy canvases and paint . Other teachers brought_in items for_sale . A campus beautification fund yielded $ 100 for painting the gallery walls and student Cervantes Morales donated the labor . Students gave nickels and dimes . At Pier 1 , Javier bought 50 pairs of 98-cent earrings and sold them at a small profit . &quot; He ' s Mr. Creativity , &quot; says ESL teacher Al Atwood , whose heat transfer press turned_out Evans T-shirts to benefit the fund . He wanted this gallery . In his class of so-called slow learners , he has one &quot; who can draw like Michelangelo. &quot; &quot; We got_it open with probably less than $ 600 , &quot; Javier says . This month ' s unveiling was a celebration , complete with ice sculptures from the Evans kitchen . The enthusiasm appears contagious . When Javier ' s students are asked how they feel about their teacher , their gallery , the applause is spontaneous : &quot; Excelente ! &quot; They speak_of the camaraderie of learning about one another . In one class , everyone made a mask . &quot; I showed them some pictures , sort of Picassoesque , and just let them go , &quot; Javier says . Lupita Enciso , from Mexico , says her mask is &quot; kind of like a reflection of myself , two different personalities. &quot; In class , she is very serious . But &quot; I like to sing . I like to dance. &quot; Rhina Zepeda , a pretty young_woman from El_Salvador , giggles and says she painted her face : &quot; It was almost like I was making up. &quot; Another piece in the show is a big outline of the United States on which are superimposed students ' recollections of their first day in America . They tell of feeling as helpless as children , unable to speak . They describe their awe at the creature comforts , the freedom . Javier can relate to strangers in a strange land . He was born in Los Angeles , but he has Portuguese , Filipino , Spanish and Chinese blood . At UCLA , where he majored in English literature , he always felt in cultural &quot; limbo-land. &quot; Art in ESL classes makes perfect sense to him -- a way to teach new words . Brush , glue , paint . Art field trips have proved an eye-opener to him and his students . One told him : &quot; I didn ' t know I could go here . I thought this area was only for white people. &quot; They were at the Museum of Contemporary Art , a 10-minute walk from Evans . Scrounging money , Javier plans ongoing workshops where students will create art for the gallery . Exhibits will change monthly , sometimes tying_in to ethnic holidays . Guest artists will also be invited to exhibit . Evans Principal Francis Marsala -- the son of Sicilian immigrants -- is a booster . He knows that good English means better jobs , but &quot; the way to the soul is through the arts. &quot; At Evans , &quot; all_the cultures of the world are rubbing_up against each other and there ' s peace and harmony . There ' s hope , you know. &quot; To Mexican immigrant Felipe Malagon , one of the mask makers , art is one way in which &quot; we can communicate who we are to the wider community , so they will treat us as people instead of objects. &quot; Evans Adult School is at 717 N . Figueroa St . The gallery is open from 7:30 a.m. to 9:15 p.m. Monday-Thursday , and from 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Fridays . Triumph of the Spirit It is a Friday evening and , in a Beverly Hills home , about 50 of the faithful have come_to meet Olya . They are Bahais , disciples of a faith with its roots in mid-19th-Century Persia . Olya Roohizadegan , 51 , is one of their heroines -- sole survivor among 11 Bahai women imprisoned in revolutionary Iran for refusing to denounce their faith . She does not know why she was saved -- &quot; a miracle , &quot; she says -- but she understands her mission : to tell the world about the persecution and hangings of the women martyrs known as the Shiraz 10 . Her book , &quot; Olya ' s Story , &quot; is as much their story as hers . It is a tale of torture , mob violence , secret burials . She has told it before the United Nations and the European Court of Human_Rights . A movie is in the works . Now , in L.A. for the first time , she is telling it at this Bahai &quot; fireside. &quot; &quot; I forgive them , &quot; she says of the executioners . &quot; I don ' t feel any hate . I pray for them . . . but I cannot forget 10 innocent women. &quot; For two months starting in late 1982 , she was their friend and cellmate . She pulls_out fuzzy photos of the women and holds them up one by one . &quot; Who is Shirin ? &quot; &quot; Who is Roya ? &quot; Ten people step_forward , each taking a photo and holding it high . The room is very quiet . In introducing Roohizadegan , Muhtadia Rice of the local Bahai community had promised , &quot; You will leave here this evening with a great sense of joy. &quot; That joy is in the slain women ' s triumph of the spirit after lifelong persecution in a Muslim nation for their beliefs : equality for all , the oneness of God , their own prophets as well as Mohammed , the Muslims ' sacred messenger . The women &quot; are now free , &quot; Roohizadegan tells the audience , &quot; but I ' m not free &quot; so_long as there is anyone who does not know about religious persecution . Roohizadegan describes her ordeal , her interrogation by guards : &quot; They brought my 3-year-old son , put him in my lap and said , ' This is your last chance ( to recant ) . ' &quot; She could not . She asks , what if &quot; my baby grew_up and realized his mother is a liar ? &quot; The price of getting_out of prison was the family ' s worldly goods . Even then , she lived_in fear of being jailed again . Each moment was precious . She visited prisoners , smuggled news of Bahais to the outside world . Eventually , she escaped with her husband and son overland to Pakistan . They were later reunited with their two older sons in England , where they now live . She cannot return to Iran : &quot; I am still sentenced to death. &quot;</TEXT>
