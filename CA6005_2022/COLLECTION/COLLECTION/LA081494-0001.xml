   <HEADLINE> THE CAMERAS LOVED HER ; IN JOHN GREGORY DUNNE ' S DARK HOLLYWOOD NOVEL , ONE GIRL KNOWS HOW TO MAKE AN ENTRANCE -- THE OTHER MAKES QUITE AN EXIT ; PLAYLAND , BY JOHN GREGORY DUNNE , ( RANDOM HOUSE : $ 25 ; 494 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About a quarter of the way through John Gregory Dunne ' s &quot; Playland , &quot; we find ourselves at the Copacabana in its late 1940s heyday . Walter Winchell is sitting at his usual table , slyly eyeing the assembled semi-sophisticates and making copious notes . Helen O ' Connell has just finished a sultry rendition of &quot; I Like the Likes of You , &quot; singing directly at Jacob King , a good-looking gangster celebrating the fact that he has just beaten a murder_conviction . Then Blue Tyler makes her entrance . Poured into a black evening_gown , draped with a red_fox fur , the now teen-age former child star sashays into the club with a small army of bodyguards , publicists and boyfriend of the moment , Arthur French , in tow : &quot; She smiled and waved at the photographers , their cameras loving her and she loving their cameras in turn , the cameras wiping the teen-age sulkiness from her face , Blue always in motion , posing , vamping , cooing , ' I ' d walk a mile for a man who walked a mile for a Camel. ' Joe Romagnola , the maitre d ' , produced a cigarette , offering a light from his silver Tiffany lighter , a gift from Frank , who when he played the Paramount gave Tiffany lighters to all_the maitre d ' s at all_the gin_mills where he drank , and Arthur French just as quickly removed the cigarette from her mouth . ' J . F . says you ' re too young to smoke in public , ' he said , and Blue said , ' I ' m too young to do a lot of the things I do with you , Arthur , in public and especially in private , it ' s called statutory something , isn ' t it ? ' &quot; This is first-rate pop fiction writing : tart , evocative , nicely observed . Real people are crammed cheek by jowl alongside imaginary characters . Cameras , cigarettes and pocket_lighters are brought_to eerily animate life . And the words sprint lightly across the page thanks to a generous sprinkling of commas keeping each thought , feeling and texture tumbling along easily one after the other . You can find any number of well-written scenes throughout &quot; Playland ' s &quot; 494 pages . The question is : Are well-written scenes enough ? With &quot; Playland , &quot; Dunne has set_out to write the end-all Hollywood novel . It ' s his full-throttle , damn-the-torpedoes try at toppling &quot; The Last Tycoon , &quot; &quot; What Makes Sammy Run ? &quot; and &quot; The Day of the Locust &quot; from the literary pedestals that have held them for so_long . But for all_the verbal flash that makes_it such an enjoyable read , it ' s no match for the_likes_of Fitzgerald , Schulberg and West . You can only coast on the surface for so_long before a reader begins to hanker for some depth . &quot; Playland ' s &quot; principal setting is Hollywood in the 1940s ; a period Dunne rightly regards_as the most fascinating in movie history . The studio system was operating at top speed . The power and influence of the images it created were reaching millions worldwide . Yet at_the_same_time , that system was beginning to come_apart at the seams . Industrywide strikes had led to an unholy alliance between moguls and mobsters , so desperate were the studios to break the unions ' backs . The anti-Communist witch hunts of the blacklist era soon followed , bringing with it further demoralization and depletion of valuable human resources . In &quot; Playland ' s &quot; acknowledgments , Dunne pays lavish tribute to the late writer-director Philip Dunne for his memoir &quot; Take Two &quot; ( &quot; essential to any understanding of the period &quot; ) and Neal Gabler ' s classic study , &quot; An Empire of Their Own : How the Jews Invented Hollywood &quot; ( &quot; the best book about Hollywood I have ever read &quot; ) . But , being a novel , &quot; Playland &quot; is less interested in the dry facts of history than the ways that fiction can engage a reader ' s imagination to make those facts come_alive . And the means Dunne has chosen is pastiche : a real Hollywood with an imaginary star named Blue Tyler placed at its center . With her shockingly adult voice and manner ( much like child star Mitzi Green ) , Blue is a sensation in the 1930s . But by the mid- ' 40s her studio , Cosmopolitan Pictures ( the actual name of the studio William Randolph Hearst built for Marion Davies ) , is beginning to wonder whether she ' ll be able to make the transition to adult roles ( see Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland ) . Her uncontrollably foul mouth ( see Louise Brooks , Frances Farmer , Carole Lombard ) and her sensationally public affair with gangster Jacob King ( see Bugsy Siegel and Virginia Hill ) , make her a studio publicist ' s nightmare . On top of that , Blue gets_into hot water when she testifies before the House Un-American Activities Committee ( shades of Dorothy Comingore ) and comes_to the defense of her favorite director Chuckie O ' Hara ; a one-legged , gay ex-Marine who joined the Communist_party out of love for a screenwriter ( there ' s been loose talk that this is George Cukor , but Dunne more likely created the character from an admixture of Mitchell Leisen , Edmund Goulding and Irving Rapper ) . Blue makes the blacklist herself as a result . Still , a career nose dive seems to be in the cards for Blue regardless , for following a string of bad marriages ( Arlene Judge ) , worse Italian movies ( Carroll Baker ) and low-paying jobs ( Veronica Lake ) , she finds herself out of show_business and &quot; off the planet &quot; : an alcoholic wreck ( Lillian Roth ) living_in a trailer_park ( Evelyn Brent ) on the outskirts of Hamtramck , Mich . All this is par for the course for Hollywood novels : the seamy underside of the &quot; dream factory &quot; cocktailed up through a bittersweet mixture of glamour and sleaze . What Dunne adds_to the usual stew are &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; -like flights of fancy : &quot; ( Here ' s ) a photo of Blue at age 10 receiving from Clark Gable that special Oscar at the 1939 Academy Awards . Another of Blue giving Eleanor Roosevelt a contribution to the March of Dimes . . . . ( Blue ) with Harold Arlen and Irving Berlin both penning Tyler songfests . . . . Blue being comforted by Norma Shearer outside the Wilshire Boulevard Temple where she was ' the youngest mourner at the funeral of Beloved Industry Legend Irving Thalberg ' . . . weeping at the news that Carole Lombard ' s plane had crashed in Table Rock , Nevada , outside Las Vegas , killing everyone on board . ' Blue misses fatal flight , ' read the caption headline. &quot; This is very clever stuff ; catnip for lovers of movies lore . But while Dunne brings 1940s Hollywood to vivid life , his heroine remains more a conceit than a character . &quot; Playland &quot; is narrated by Jack Broderick , the central figure of Dunne ' s 1987 Kennedyesque family saga &quot; The Red White &amp; Blue. &quot; A down-on-his-luck screenwriter , he hopes to turn Blue ' s story into a novel that will be bought as the basis for a screenplay -- which he will also write . And so Broderick sets_out to interview not only the faded star , but everyone who ever knew her , directly or indirectly . As Blue ' s story spills_out &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; -style , the testimony of_aged studio heads , sleazy police informers , Hollywood has-beens and assorted mobsters slowly builds_up the notion that her life_history is of earth-shattering importance . But at the end of the day , it ' s hard to imagine how the petty travails of a small-minded , mean-spirited , foul-mouthed , self-obsessed nymphomaniac can be seen as typifying Hollywood as_a_whole . Dunne ' s mistake is letting his love of tough-guy prose and show_biz cynicism get the better of him . For the greatest of Hollywood stars weren ' t libertines like Blue , but hypocrites who believed -- and promoted -- every one of the pristine images the studio manufactured for them , even while living wildly contradictory lives behind closed doors . Or , to put it another way , Joan Crawford was a madwoman who thought she was Joan Crawford . Strangely , Dunne seems to be aware of the limitations of his premise , for in the novel ' s last_quarter , he abandons Blue ' s story and shifts to an investigation of the unsolved murder of her &quot; best pal , &quot; a &quot; non-pro &quot; named Meta Dierdorf . &quot; It was odd , even obscene , looking_at old forensic photographs of a naked dead nineteen-year-old who if she were still alive would be close to seventy , with all_the attendant miseries and complaints of old_age and failed expectation. &quot; There ' s nothing odd , however , about Dunne ' s fascination with an old forensic photo . We ' ve been here before -- in &quot; True Confession , &quot; Dunne ' s spin on the &quot; Black Dahlia &quot; case . But there ' s a harsher undertone this time : &quot; Meta Dierdorf was not a pretty sight in her bathtub . Her face was battered , her nose bloodied , her lips puffed and split , her breasts bare and bruised . On the side of the tub , there were smeared traces of excrement , indicating that as she was dying her sphincter had loosened and that she had evacuated her bowels . . . &quot; The reader doesn ' t arrive_at this passage unprepared . From Blue Tyler ' s sardonic recollections of almost dying in an emergency_room , to an underworld informer ' s grotesque descriptions of a series of gangland slayings , Dunne ' s novel is a virtual catalogue raisonnee of physical revulsion and misanthropic disgust . Sexual couplings are minutely described , but the pleasures of lovemaking are passed_over in silence . The four-letter_word for intercourse is used constantly -- but primarily as a weapon of verbal violence . And in one indelible scene we ' re served a description , in exhaustive detail , of Jacob King engaged in a fit of excessive vomiting . Attraction / repulsion to corporeal existence is nothing new_to serious literature . A bit more reserve , and Dunne ' s meditation on Meta Dierdorf ' s corpse would bear comparison with the clinical cool of J . G . Ballard ; a_few more kinks , and it could be right out of one of William Burroughs ' pornographic vaudevilles ; more passion could invoke parallels with the Nietzschean melancholia of Georges Bataille ; more excess , the Marquis_de_Sade . The problem is , unlike the authors of &quot; Crash , &quot; &quot; The Wild Boys , &quot; &quot; Blue of Noon &quot; and &quot; The 120 Days of Sodom , &quot; Dunne hasn ' t owned up_to his own morbidity . &quot; Playland &quot; is supposed to be a novel about Hollywood . But it doesn ' t take an expert in textual analysis to discover a very different piece of writing beneath its slick roman_a_clef surface . Not quite fiction , not quite cri de coeur confession , this &quot; other kind &quot; of book overflowing with inchoate gushes of bile , has absolutely nothing to do with the movies . In fact , the closer you look_at &quot; Playland , &quot; the more obvious it appears that Dunne is using Hollywood as a mechanism of denial . Plainly , for all his showbiz savvy , Dunne is far more comfortable at the morgue than at the movies . * TimesLink : 808-8463 To hear John Gregory Dunne reading from &quot; Playland , &quot; call TimesLink and press * 7817 Call TimesLink from area_codes 213 , 310 , 714 , 818 or 909 .
