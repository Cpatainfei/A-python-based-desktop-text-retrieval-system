   <HEADLINE> FLOODED WATERWAYS SWAMP DOZENS OF SOUTHERN TOWNS ; WEATHER : DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO 23 AS OTHER CITIES PREPARE FOR WORST . THOUSANDS FLEE RAPIDLY RISING RIVERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The death toll continued to climb Friday as rain-swollen rivers and creeks overran dozens of towns and hamlets throughout Georgia as well as in parts of Alabama and north Florida . In what is the worst flood to strike this region in 65 years , at least 23 people are dead , 300 # 000 were without safe drinking_water and portions of interstate highways were closed because of high_water . Damage estimates have reached $ 100 million . In this southwestern Georgia city , a van ran_off the road and into the Flint River late Thursday . Five people in the vehicle escaped , but two children , ages 2 and 4 , were swept_away . As of Friday afternoon , one child ' s body had been recovered . At the town cemetery , 200 air-tight caskets popped_out of the sodden ground and were floating , held_in only by a fence . Parks Department workers in boats tried to corral some of the coffins , tying them to trees . &quot; We ' re just trying to retrieve what we can until we can get the National_Guard in there. &quot; Southeast of downtown , at the Oakridge Shopping_Center , businesses were closed and filled with water . Water also rose halfway to the roof of the Southside Baptist_Church . Verna Hall , 70 , who lives three houses away , said : &quot; I was supposed to teach Sunday_school this week . I guess I won ' t have to worry about that now. &quot; From his back yard , Al Cortez , 45 , contemplated casting a fishing_line into a river he normally cannot see from his house . &quot; Too muddy , &quot; he concluded . &quot; And the smell ! &quot; After four days of heavy rain generated by a stalled tropical storm system , the worst was still ahead for thousands of people living downstream on waterways swollen way past capacity . &quot; We ' ve got a lot of concerned people here , &quot; said Police_Officer Doyle Welch in Bainbridge , Ga. , located about 40 miles south of Albany . The Flint River is expected to crest at 45 feet above flood stage next Wednesday at Bainbridge . Some 2 # 000 residents of low-lying areas west of town have been evacuated . &quot; But everyone is working together , and we ' re doing the best we can , &quot; Welch said . In Albany , which has been virtually isolated by rising water , the muddy Flint was expected to crest early today . Rescuers here used boats to pluck stranded residents from the roofs of their homes . &quot; We ' ve been pulling them from trees , power poles and all kinds of things , &quot; said Assistant Fire_Chief J.W. Arrowwood . Despite days of warning , some waited until it was almost too late . &quot; We were fools , just crazy , &quot; said Johnny Oliver , who was picked_up by a boat as he waded through shoulder-high water . Some 15 # 000 residents -- nearly a quarter of the city ' s population -- have been forced_out of their homes . A hospital was sandbagged and partially evacuated . All four bridges into town were closed . In Macon , Ga. , where floodwaters closed_down sections of Interstate 75 and Interstate 16 this week , Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G . Cisneros toured the stricken area Friday afternoon and said : &quot; This is a city of 106 # 000 that has no drinking or running water , and it ' s likely to be eight days until they get_it back . It ' s going_to be very difficult and frustrating. &quot; Cisneros said thousands of people had been forced from their homes_in a swath of Georgia that includes Macon , Americus and Albany . &quot; After the Midwest floods of last year , nothing surprises me , &quot; he said . &quot; But this is a body blow . And when a person is pushed_out of their home , it doesn ' t matter how vast the area of destruction is. &quot; While the sun was seen in Albany and Atlanta on Friday , anxiety rose downstream with the floodwaters . &quot; We just closed all our bridges , &quot; Police_Chief Sam Tripp of Hawkinsville , Ga. , said Friday afternoon as the Ocmulgee River hit 38 feet on its rise to an expected crest of 42 feet on Monday . Already , Tripp said , the river has claimed 20 to 25 homes_in low-lying areas of this town of 5 # 000 residents , and more were expected to be lost . &quot; We ' ve only had four or five inches of rain here ; this is all from upstream , &quot; Tripp said . &quot; In 1990 , the river got_to 31 feet , but that was nothing like this. &quot; The Choctawatchee River is expected to crest at a record 26 feet today in Caryville , Fla. , a town of 600 people located west of Tallahassee . &quot; The water ' s been rising for three days , and we ' ve got Marine Patrol , Florida Highway Patrol and the fire_marshal , even National_Guard troops , moving people , &quot; said Holmes County Sheriff ' s Deputy Ronnie Grant . &quot; They say this is going_to be the worst flood since 1929. &quot; In Macon , the Ocmulgee , fed by rainfall totals as high as 20 inches , had already done its damage . The water treatment plant was swamped Tuesday , and since then residents have lined_up at area shopping_centers for free drinking_water . On Thursday , the Ocmulgee crested at what officials guessed was about 35 feet ; they could not be certain because the depth gauge was swept_away . Flood stage is 18 feet . Left behind was a mess : piles of debris , brown mud , and a pungent stench . In Americus , where at least 10 people died , divers continued to search creeks and rivers for bodies Friday while some residents began to shovel mud from their homes . Rainfall in Americus this week has totaled more_than 24 inches . Along the Towaliga River , 150 miles north of Albany , police found the body of William Miller , who with his wife , Willa , had been missing since Tuesday . Willa Miller , who clung_to a tree for nine hours before being rescued , told police their car was swept into the raging floodwaters . Near Elbert , about 100 miles northeast of Albany , another man ' s body was found in a swollen creek . Authorities feared that more bodies would be found . The rains that have pounded the region for days began late Sunday , hours after Tropical Storm Alberto blew across the Florida Panhandle from the Gulf_of_Mexico and then stalled over Georgia and Alabama . Fed by moisture from both the Gulf and the Atlantic_Ocean , the low-pressure system was transformed into a round-the-clock rain machine , dumping record amounts of precipitation on central and southern Georgia and parts of Alabama . Georgia Gov . Zell Miller has declared 43 counties disaster_areas , and President Clinton authorized federal aid -- including emergency housing grants and low-cost loans -- for the hardest-hit areas . Some 400 # 000 acres of cropland has been flooded , and 31 earthen dams have given_way . &quot; My thoughts and prayers are with the people back home who are battling fires and floods , and especially with the families of those who have lost their lives in the disasters , &quot; Clinton said in a statement from Naples , Italy , where he is attending an economic summit . Stanley reported from Albany , Ga. , and Clary from Miami . Flooding Still Fierce Huge sections of central and southern Georgia remained submerged Friday in a sea of muddy flood waters . Dougherty Co. : People warned to evacuate Macon : 12.82 inches Americus : 24.5 inches Albany : 6.65 inches Rainfall totals listed are from the begining of the storm Sunday through 2 p.m. Thursday Sources : AP , The Atlanta Constitution , Times Atlanta Bureau</TEXT>
