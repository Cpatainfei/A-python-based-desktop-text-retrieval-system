   <HEADLINE> UNCERTAINTY , LAWSUITS WOULD GREET PROP . 187 ; ELECTION : MANY HOSPITALS , CLINICS HAVE YET TO PREPARE CONTINGENCY PLANS . DISOBEDIENCE AND CONFUSION PREDICTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Proposition 187 is approved by California voters , most of its get-tough provisions eliminating government services to illegal immigrants would be scheduled to take_effect immediately . However , with little more_than a week before Election_Day , many hospitals , clinics and government entities -- confused by the measure ' s broad wording or concerned about its harsh consequences and hopeful that it will be rejected either by state voters or by the courts afterward -- have yet to prepare contingency plans for implementing the sweeping initiative . State health officials say they don ' t plan to give guidance to local hospitals and clinics until after the election , and are not yet sure how they will provide such basic services as communicable_disease control because of the wording of Proposition 187 . Complicating matters further are petitions being circulated among health_care professionals pledging their refusal to implement the initiative , which would require personnel at most hospitals and clinics to refuse non-emergency treatment to illegal immigrants and to report the names of suspected illegal immigrants to federal authorities . &quot; The overlay of civil_disobedience , general confusion , lawsuits and uncertainty about how to apply the law will result in great chaos , &quot; predicted David Langness , a vice_president of the Hospital Council of Southern California . Indeed , at this point , one of the few certainties is that if Proposition 187 is approved Nov . 8 , a flurry of lawsuits will be filed_in federal and state courts across California beginning Nov . 9 . &quot; The celebration election night will be very short , &quot; acknowledged Ronald Prince , co-chair of the pro-187 campaign committee , &quot; because we ' ll have to be in court the next morning. &quot; Lawyers for the California Medical Assn. , the California Assn . of Hospitals , the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and the National Immigration Law Center , among other groups , are currently ensconced at their computer terminals , preparing lawsuits to thwart the measure . &quot; If you want to talk_about a lawyer ' s employment program , this is it , &quot; said one such attorney , Peter D . Roos of the Bay Area-based Multi Cultural Education Training and Advocacy Inc. &quot; The O.J. case is a whodunit -- it ' s simple compared to this. &quot; Anti-187 lawyers say the issues to be covered will range from the constitutionality of Proposition 187 ' s key educational provisions to whether California voters even have the right to consider wide-ranging immigration questions , since immigration is generally within the purview of the federal_government . &quot; Because of the fact the federal_government constitutionally has basically been given the responsibility of dealing with immigration -- and this proposal defines legal residency status differently than the way the federal_government does -- there is a clear conflict there , &quot; said Lilly Spitz , staff attorney for the California Assn . of Hospitals . The ACLU of Southern California is considering filing a comprehensive suit on behalf of several organizations to scuttle the measure ' s impact on about 15 health and social_services programs . However , ACLU legal director Mark Rosenbaum said that at this point , he prefers to focus_on Election_Day rather than the day after . &quot; The ballot_box is the only 100 % certain way to defeat the measure , &quot; he said , &quot; and litigation , if required , is going_to be time consuming , enormously divisive and expensive beyond belief. &quot; When pressed , Rosenbaum asserted that the initiative , co-authored by Harold Ezell , former INS Western regional commissioner and fast-food executive , is chock full of legal flaws . &quot; This measure is like target_practice against the Constitution , &quot; Rosenbaum said . &quot; It was written by a hot dog executive , with the same level of sophistication as stuffing a hot dog. &quot; Prince , the head of the pro-187 campaign , refuses to discuss legal issues . &quot; We can ' t help you there , &quot; he said . &quot; We don ' t have a lawyer who would n ' t charge to consult with you on that. &quot; Initiative co-author Alan Nelson , an attorney , says he expects the state_attorney general ' s office to deal with a barrage of lawsuits , but he is confident the measure will hold_up . The measure &quot; ought not to be so specific as_to cover every nitty-gritty thing , &quot; he said . &quot; It sets_forth the general principles and we ' d have the state follow up with regulations and implementing procedures. &quot; Ballot measures often spawn long and costly lawsuits -- the insurance reform measure , Proposition 103 , is a prime example . But Proposition 187 is different in one key regard : Its sponsors are actually inviting litigation . In the 1982 case of Plyler vs . Doe , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a Texas law eliminating a free public_school education for illegal immigrant children . By asking California voters to banish illegal immigrants from schools , Proposition 187 sponsors are essentially asking the electorate to authorize a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to request the court to take another look_at the same issue . &quot; The purpose of the initiative is to have the court revisit and reconsider the Plyler decision , &quot; Nelson said . &quot; Passage of the initiative will provide that vehicle. &quot; Among those planning challenges of the measure ' s schooling ban if it passes are attorney Roos , of Multi Cultural Education Training and Advocacy , and Peter A . Schey , who heads the Los Angeles-based Center for Human_Rights and Constitutional Law . Both attorneys appeared before the Supreme Court more_than a decade ago to successfully argue the Plyler vs . Doe case . Because the basic issue has already been adjudicated once , constitutional law experts say , the initiative is bound to speedily make its way back to the court . &quot; If it went first to either the state or federal_court system , all_the lower courts would have to declare it unconstitutional because only the Supreme Court could overrule Plyler vs . Doe , &quot; said USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky . Because the measure ' s public_school provisions would not take_effect until Jan . 1 , 1995 , school suits might not be filed immediately . Schey , for one , said he probably will hold_off until state_government agencies make clear &quot; how they intend to interpret the measure ' s very ambiguous provisions. &quot; The state_attorney general ' s office , as it routinely does , is preparing to defend the ballot measure . &quot; You can imagine how quickly legal_actions will be filed , &quot; said spokesman David Puglia . School officials , meanwhile , say they are fielding calls from parents worried about the repercussions of Proposition 187 . &quot; There ' s rumors , confusion and a lack of understanding of how initiatives work , &quot; said Los Angeles Board_of_Education President Mark Slavkin . &quot; We ' re trying to get_out the message that children should keep coming_to school . that ' s where they belong . If there is to be a change in our practices and procedures , we ' ll let people know. &quot; Even if the schooling ban were declared unconstitutional , other portions of the measure could still take_effect due_to a severability clause in the initiative . Since these portions , covering health_care , social_services and law_enforcement , do not include implementation dates , they are scheduled to go_into effect immediately upon passage , according to the secretary_of_state ' s office . &quot; Like any initiative , if regulations are needed to clarify it or have to be promulgated to implement it , they will , &quot; said Leslie Goodman , director of communications for Gov . Pete Wilson . Among the first expected to file lawsuits is the Los Angeles-based National Immigration Law Center , which plans to seek an immediate federal_court ruling on behalf of immigrants who claim they are entitled to full Medi-Cal benefits but do not have documents readily available to prove it . Center attorney Charles Wheeler said the suit would be designed to enforce a 1991 federal ruling ordering state officials to provide full benefits while giving immigrants &quot; a reasonable opportunity &quot; to obtain necessary documents . The injunction also covers undocumented immigrants the INS is aware of but is not considering deporting . Other potential lawsuits would attack the entire initiative on constitutional or statutory grounds . For example , the requirement for reporting people reasonably suspected of being illegal immigrants to federal authorities raises discrimination issues , said Spitz . &quot; By attempting to treat people differently because of their accent , dress and their ethnicity , the law on its face would be unconstitutional , &quot; she contended . With the measure continuing to receive slightly more_than 50 % support in pre-election polls , officials of health_care facilities and government_agencies that would be directly impacted say they have little direction on how to proceed if the measure wins . The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services , which cares_for children who have been abused or abandoned , generally has about 200 undocumented children under its wing at any given time . Because the measure ' s ban on social_services for illegal immigrants lists no exception for children , department Director Peter Digre says he is caught between a rock and a hard place . &quot; I can ' t believe the public in any way intends if we find a battered 2-year-old toddler that we not remove the toddler from the situation , &quot; said Digre . &quot; Our responsibilities are outlined in great detail in ( federal law ) . . . and we have a whole network of court_orders that tell us what to do. &quot; Co-author Nelson said last week he wasn ' t fully clear about the measure ' s intent_on abused and abandoned children , since he didn ' t draft that section . &quot; But if they are illegally in the country , they shouldn ' t be getting publicly funded benefits and that would include foster care , &quot; Nelson said . The Los Angeles Police Commission is awaiting word from the city attorney ' s office on whether to revise its policy of limited cooperation with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Commission . The ballot measure calls_for police to verify the legal_status of any person arrested if he or she is suspected of being an illegal immigrant . &quot; Right now we only notify the INS if we have someone arrested and charged with a felony and ( the person ) is found guilty in court , &quot; said Chief Willie L . Williams . &quot; Technically , when you stop someone for a traffic violation , that ' s an arrest. &quot; At this point , says Langness , Southern California hospitals and health clinics also have not yet formulated plans to implement Proposition 187 . &quot; We hope the measure will be defeated , and if it passes , we anticipate court action that will last a long_time , &quot; he said , &quot; We have also heard from many clinics and several hospitals that petitions are circulating among doctors and nurses . . . saying they will refuse to implement 187 if it passes. &quot; Nelson responded that &quot; promoting anarchy is a big P.R. gimmick . You have to believe most people will adhere to the law. &quot; The Los Angeles Free Clinic , for one , is considering a third option : setting_up a parallel clinic funded entirely by private donations . &quot; We could not as public health providers in good conscience turn people away who need health_care , &quot; said Executive_Director Mary Rainwater . &quot; It violates every principle that we hold . . . that health_care is a basic human right. &quot; In recent weeks , the state_Department of Health Services , seeking to meet the wishes of the Wilson Administration , has been working_on directives to be issued to hospitals and clinics shortly after Election_Day . Plans call_for the state to advise hospitals to continue treating anyone who bears a full-scale Medi-Cal card , said Deputy Director Elisabeth C . Brandt . &quot; That means they ' re not undocumented aliens and already have been found by our department to have an appropriate immigrant status , &quot; said Brandt , the agency ' s chief counsel . &quot; We want to be sure providers don ' t discriminate against anyone based on suspected alien status when we ' ve already gone_through that . That would be a real problem with federal laws and jeopardize federal medical funds. &quot; Such advice , however , appears at_odds with the aims of initiative sponsors , who have argued illegal immigrants now receive government funds for which they are ineligible because of the ease of obtaining fraudulent documents . Moreover , Gov . Pete Wilson , one of the leading proponents of Proposition 187 , has called_for the issuance of new tamper-proof ID cards to provide proof of legal residency . Brandt said the state_government is also considering becoming directly involved in administering immunizations because the measure forbids publicly funded hospitals and clinics from serving illegal immigrants . Such action would come_in large part , Brandt said , because Wilson has indicated to the agency that he doesn ' t want to place the larger population at risk of contagious_disease if Proposition 187 wins approval . &quot; The initiative doesn ' t say the government can ' t pay_for the service , &quot; asserted Brandt . &quot; It says the ( hospital or clinic ) facility may_not provide it. &quot; Such thinking , however , appears to fly in the face of the measure ' s intent . Its authors have made clear time and again their main goal is to prevent government funds from being spent on illegal immigrants . &quot; As far as giving free medical_aid to every_other person here illegally , you have to say no , &quot; Ezell said recently . &quot; If it ' s immunizations , let some of the private groups pay_for some of this stuff . Let MALDEF ( the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund ) open a clinic for it . Let the Ford Foundation pay_for that. &quot; Doris Meissner , INS commissioner , is cautious about discussing how her agency would go_about enforcing Proposition 187 if it becomes law . Under the measure , hospitals , schools and some others government entities are directed to report people suspected of being illegal immigrants to the INS . &quot; At this time we have not made any special preparations , &quot; she said recently , though she acknowledged the measure would strain the overburdened immigration service .</TEXT>
