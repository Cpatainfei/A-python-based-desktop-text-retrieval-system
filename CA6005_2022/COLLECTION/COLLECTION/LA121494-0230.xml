   <HEADLINE> FACEOFF BETWEEN U.S. SHIP , CHINESE SUB IS REVEALED ; MILITARY : OCTOBER INCIDENT IN YELLOW_SEA HIGHLIGHTS GROWING CHANCE OF NAVAL CONFLICT . BEIJING SOUNDS WARNING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The American aircraft_carrier Kitty Hawk and a Chinese nuclear submarine squared_off in international waters off China ' s coast this fall_in a maritime encounter that demonstrated the growing potential for naval conflict between the United States and China , The Times has learned . Shortly after the incident , which occurred in the Yellow_Sea on Oct . 27-29 , China served notice through a U.S. military official in Beijing that the next time such a situation arises , China ' s orders will be to shoot to kill , Pentagon officials confirmed this week . Although in the end no shots were fired in the high-seas confrontation , U.S. officials acknowledge that it was serious . The captain of the Kitty Hawk dispatched anti-submarine-warfare aircraft to drop sonic devices designed to track the nuclear sub , and Chinese jet fighters scrambled and flew within sight of the American_planes . Finally , after the Chinese submarine withdrew to its base at the port of Qingdao , the U.S. aircraft_carrier was pulled_out of the area . The Kitty Hawk , whose home port is San Diego , had been used earlier to project American power in the Persian_Gulf and off the coast of Somalia before it was transferred in July , at the height of the Korean crisis , to an American naval base in Japan . The encounter underscored the growing maritime tensions between the U.S. Pacific Fleet and China , which is rapidly developing a blue-water navy . U.S. officials say they found the nuclear submarine in open waters where they had rarely spotted Chinese vessels before . There had been one other instance , in early September , in which U.S. Navy ships encountered a Chinese submarine , but that episode ended much more quietly . The previously unreported incident also highlights some of the gunboat_diplomacy involving the United States , China and North_Korea that surrounded the U.S.-North Korean nuclear agreement reached Oct . 17 . In September , the Kitty Hawk was dispatched to waters off North_Korea in what a U.S. military official acknowledged was a show of force intended to influence nuclear negotiations in Geneva -- in roughly the same way that the dispatch of American troops had induced Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras and his military regime to give_up power in Haiti . &quot; I think the Haiti example is a good_example of how . . . some very strong military_forces can influence diplomacy , &quot; Adm . Ronald Zlatoper , commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet , told the newspaper Stars &amp; Stripes at the time . He also said the deployment of the aircraft_carrier near North_Korea was &quot; significant because , in the past , we haven ' t had a carrier battle_group presence in this region. &quot; The Navy ' s carrier battle_group included not only the Kitty Hawk but also three cruisers , one frigate , one submarine , two logistics ships and an estimated 10 # 000 American naval personnel . To the apparent consternation of Clinton_Administration officials , the Yellow_Sea incident took_place less than two weeks after Secretary_of_Defense William J . Perry traveled_to Beijing to try to improve military cooperation between the United States and China . Pentagon officials have been watching as China has rapidly increased its naval strength , with the aid of some purchases from what was once the Soviet_Union ' s navy . U.S. officials said this week that the Chinese navy recently ordered four conventional submarines from Russia and that one of those left St . Petersburg recently for refitting in another port . The nuclear submarine encountered by the Kitty Hawk is one of five operated by China ' s navy . It is 330 feet long , weighs 5 # 000 tons and carries torpedoes , U.S. officials say . U.S. intelligence officials say the nuclear submarines don ' t often operate in the open ocean but that their operations have picked_up lately . Harlan W . Jencks , a UC Berkeley expert on the Chinese People ' s Liberation Army , wrote in a recent article that leaders in Beijing now view the American military presence in the Pacific as being &quot; at least implicitly &quot; in opposition to China . &quot; Recent U.S. Navy exercises with Southeast Asian navies casting China as the potential troublemaker have reinforced this perception , &quot; he explained . In the Yellow_Sea incident , American anti-submarine aircraft detected the Chinese nuclear submarine off the Shandong peninsula , about 200 miles from the Kitty Hawk , Pentagon officials said . The Chinese vessel was found through electronic monitoring devices . At times during the three-day encounter , it operated at periscope depth , about 35 to 40 feet below the surface . For a time , the Chinese submarine eluded the carrier group , and American_planes began dropping devices known as sonobuoys in an attempt to relocate it . After they found the ship , the Kitty Hawk and the U.S. planes continued to track it . In response , the Chinese air_force at one point sent its jet fighters toward the aircraft dispatched by the Kitty Hawk . The Chinese submarine then moved_back to Qingdao , the main naval base on China ' s eastern coastline . In 1986 , at a time when relations between Washington and Beijing were warmer , U.S. Navy warships visited Qingdao for their first port call_on the Chinese mainland since the end of China ' s civil_war . According to U.S. officials , China ' s warning that it will use force next time was made to an American military_attache during a dinner in Beijing . Chinese officials apparently felt that the warplanes accompanying the Kitty Hawk may have come_close enough to the mainland to violate Chinese airspace . It is not clear whether U.S. and Chinese officials have had further discussions of the incident since the Chinese warning . Some U.S. officials believe that China ' s strong reaction reflected some embarrassment that the U.S. carrier battle_group operated in the vicinity of the Chinese coast . On Tuesday , a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said accounts of the incident involving the Kitty Hawk and the Chinese submarine were just &quot; rumors . . . . Nothing happened. &quot; U.S. officials insist that the Kitty Hawk and its planes did not violate Chinese airspace , a fact they say was confirmed by satellite tracking equipment aboard the aircraft . And Pentagon officials insist that the Kitty Hawk ' s captain did &quot; the appropriate thing &quot; by tracking the Chinese sub , because &quot; there always are concerns &quot; about other powers ' nuclear submarines . &quot; They ( Chinese officials ) have never defined what they consider to be their territorial limit , &quot; one Pentagon official said Tuesday . As a result , he said , from the U.S. Navy ' s point_of_view , the limit is the traditional 12 nautical_miles . According to Pentagon sources , Adm . Richard Macke , commander_in_chief of all U.S. forces in the Pacific , informally admonished Zlatoper for appearing to suggest in the published interview that the deployment of the Kitty Hawk near North_Korea was timed to influence the diplomatic talks between the Clinton_Administration and Pyongyang . Zlatoper said Stars &amp; Stripes linked too closely words he had spoken in separate parts of the interview . State_Department officials reportedly were unhappy with Zlatoper ' s comments , which gave North_Korean negotiators a reason to attack the United States at the Geneva talks . Soon afterward , the aircraft_carrier pulled into the South_Korean port of Pusan , and Rear Adm . Dennis C . Blair , the commander of the Kitty Hawk battle_group , said the deployment of the carrier group was &quot; not specifically tied to the rhythm of the negotiations in Geneva. &quot; The Kitty Hawk was then moved away from Korean waters to east of Japan . A Show of Force The events leading to the tense showdown between a U.S. aircraft_carrier and a Chinese nuclear submarine off the eastern coast of China : * July 16 : Kitty Hawk arrives in Japan from Persian_Gulf . United States , Japan announce plans for joint naval exercises in East_China_Sea , first in that area since 1988 , at time of Seoul Olympics . * Sept . 22 : Aircraft_carrier battle_group , including Kitty Hawk , three cruisers , one frigate , two logistics ships , one submarine and an estimated 10 # 000 naval personnel , is dispatched to waters off Korean coast . * Oct . 3 : Kitty Hawk reported to be in South_Korean port in Pusan ; commander says its visit is routine and not meant for military showdown . * Oct . 27-29 : In Yellow_Sea , Kitty Hawk encounters Chinese nuclear submarine . U.S. anti-submarine-warfare planes drop sound buoys to keep track of the sub ; China scrambles jet fighters toward Kitty Hawk . Chinese submarine proceeds to base at Qingdao .</TEXT>
