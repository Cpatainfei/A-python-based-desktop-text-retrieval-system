   <TEXT> Archeology has taken massively to the streets of Athens , combing through the splendid Greek past in search of a more livable future for a now-ramshackle capital literally gasping for breath . The harvest is bountiful -- and bittersweet . Construction of a $ 2.8-billion underground Metro for Athens is imposing a delicate and painful balance between the demands of modern urban life and the legacies of history . Metro excavations have opened archeological digs the size of 22 football_fields along major streets in the heart of the city . Artifacts in dazzling array , from toys to sarcophagi to sexy bedroom lamps , are being recovered as part of the largest effort ever undertaken to mine and rescue the underground treasures of a metropolis whose majesty beckons across 25 centuries . &quot; The scale is indescribable . In pieces , there are hundreds of thousands . In bulk , tons . We are talking large trucks and heavy cranes , &quot; said William G . Stead , the American engineer overseeing Metro construction . &quot; Scholars will be writing their theses on this material 25 years from now. &quot; The bad news is that large_numbers of newly seen landmarks from Athens ' past -- walls , foundations , wells , aqueducts -- will be bulldozed goodby in another few months to keep Metro construction on schedule . Not everybody is sure that there will be time to fully digest the trove . One recent morning , a worker digging a_few feet beneath street level near Syntagma , or Constitution Square , uncovered a broken pocketbook-sized terra-cotta brick bearing the image of two prancing panthers . Archeologist Costas Saris hustled over . &quot; A mold from a metal-working shop ; about the time of Christ , &quot; he told a visitor above the rasp of a No . 136 bus trapped in traffic a_few yards away on Amalias Avenue before the national Parliament . To the fury of motorists , the Metro digs have institutionalized gridlock since tunneling began in_earnest in November , 1992 . The panthers , duly documented , by now lie_in one of the fast-growing artifact warehouses of the Greek Culture Ministry . They will be studied -- eventually . There is no time for that sort of scholarly luxury right now . &quot; Usually we don ' t excavate all year round , so winter offers a chance to study and to reflect . Here , we don ' t have that chance , &quot; said Saris , one of a dozen archeologists overseeing workers at what will become the Metro ' s biggest station . &quot; A site this size would normally keep us busy for many years . But we have only six months . I wish we hadn ' t found so much. &quot; Stead , who ran San Francisco ' s Municipal Railway for five years and also worked for New York and Boston transit systems , is himself a trained archeologist . He sympathizes_with the yearning to linger_over the past . But time is money , in this case European money : about 1 million marks for every day of delay -- nearly $ 600 # 000 . &quot; Slow archeology is not necessarily good , and fast archeology is not necessarily bad , &quot; said Stead , chief of a Bechtel International team providing management and engineering services to the Greek company responsible_for the Metro . Originally planned for completion in 1997 , the project is already more_than one year behind schedule because of the archeology . Now , Stead said , Athens must avoid the mistakes of Rome , where standoffs between builders and conservers repeatedly delayed subway construction . &quot; Unfortunately , features like wells , walls and foundations will be destroyed . Once they are measured and recorded , we ' ll have to bulldoze them out of the way , &quot; Stead said . &quot; But the glass is also half full . Except for the Metro , these sites would never have been excavated to begin with. &quot; That there is any excavation at all is because 80 % of Metro financing comes from Greece ' s concerned partners in the European Union . It is the largest contribution that the EU ( formerly the EC ) and the European Investment Bank have made to any single project . To put it bluntly , their European partners -- like the Greeks themselves -- are alarmed at Athens ' decay . Classical Athens was the most wondrous city on Earth in the 5th Century BC . Modern Athens is the most polluted and choked capital in the EU , 12th of 12 in livability and efficiency , by most reckoning . Greeks believe that it is time the past moved_over to make room for regeneration . Uncounted false Metro starts across 30 years of explosive urbanization have left Athenians disbelieving that anything good could ever emerge from any new hole in the street . Still , most people tell pollsters that while they do not want archeology sacrificed for the Metro , neither do they want the Metro sidetracked by archeology . It is not hard to understand why . In 1961 , there were 39 # 000 cars in Athens , where a third of Greeks live . Today , there are 1.4 million cars in a metropolitan area with almost 3.5 million people . Despite Draconian traffic restrictions , little moves downtown in the historic , commercial , financial and governmental heart of Greece . A century ago , a wide-eyed Mark Twain could see the Acropolis from his ship docked at the port of Piraeus , five miles away . Today , just peering across the street can be an eye-searing event . A noxious smog damages people and monuments alike . Greece was mortified to have been bypassed as the site of the 1996 centennial Olympic Games , but anybody who has navigated the streets of Athens -- or tried to use the telephones -- understands why . Metro to the rescue : Planners say that by century ' s end it could be carrying 450 # 000 passengers a day , reducing daily auto trips by 250 # 000 and the city ' s exhaust pollution by 35 % . &quot; The Metro is an environment and quality-of-life issue , &quot; Stead said . The 11-mile , 21-station , two-line underground will link with the upgraded version of an existing surface line that runs from Piraeus to the northern suburb of Kifisia . Planners promise the result will improve not only capital life , but also the international image of a city that now leaves tourist hordes as transport-despairing as Athenians . A functioning Metro system , who knows , might even restore credibility in government -- customarily as hard to encounter here as a parking_space . &quot; There ' s a lot of skepticism . But even with fences two feet from buildings and businesses , I think we are gradually winning public acceptance for the idea of short-term pain for long-term gain , &quot; said William G . Margaritis , a Greek American spokesman for the project and one of 26 Bechtel employees representing the Greek client Attiko Metro before a construction consortium of 25 Greek , French and German companies . &quot; It ' s hard to imagine any other issue on which there could be a political consensus to allow major thoroughfares to be dug_up for long periods_of_time , &quot; Margaritis said . If the need for the Metro is persuasive , so is the case for preserving a legacy of history that belongs not just to Greece but to all_of humanity . The long-sought underground_railroad , one of the largest public works projects now under way in Europe , will include five stations within the walls of ancient Athens , some of them in the shadow of the Acropolis . It is some of the most fertile soil for archeology on Earth : One trench surrendered a neolithic obsidian blade at its bottom and a 1920s coin near its top -- the detritus of 7 # 000 years in 15 vertical feet . In all , about 767 # 000 square_feet of city streets are being systematically laid bare for archeological scrutiny . &quot; The digs are very important for understanding the history and topography of the city . But we didn ' t expect to find material in such good_condition right under the street pavement , &quot; said Olga Zachariadou , supervising archeologist for the Greek Ministry of Culture . One recent morning , 100 workers with shovels backed by a dozen archeologists with fine brushes pored over the site at Syntagma , where two Metro lines will cross . It is precisely the Syntagma archeology that is delaying construction . Despite detailed research with sources ranging from ancient travelers ' journals to old city maps , test trenches and ground-penetrating radar , archeologists are finding the unexpected . &quot; This site was a cemetery outside the walls of the classical city beginning around the 4th Century BC . Later , it was incorporated inside the much larger Roman city . We found ruins of two metalworking shops we had no idea existed , &quot; Zachariadou said . &quot; A big Roman bath was built here under the Emperor Hadrian ( AD 117-138 ) that lasted until the 5th or 6th Century . Above that are some ruins of Byzantine Greece. &quot; There was great slaughter amid much destruction when the Roman general Sulla conquered the city in 86 BC . And as the wellspring of Western civilization , Athens has been subsequently pawed by vandals and enthusiasts alike . As a result , much of what is being uncovered now was disturbed long ago . A lot of the artifact pieces are just that . But some of the finds have been fresh , surprising and of museum quality . One sealed tomb contained the 2 # 000-year-old remains of a young boy and the toys laid_to_rest with him . At the Pentagono station , a marble sarcophagus the size of a conference_table protected a 20-something woman and myriad vials left by her mourners . One round , stone room for which there was no obvious entrance held never-used marble tabletops and at least 100 terra-cotta oil_lamps in mint condition , each painted with erotic scenes , Stead said . At the Larissa station , archeologists discovered a Roman drain . Elsewhere , they are engrossed in newly visible city walls , workshops , aqueducts , cisterns , ancient roads and the bed of a dried-up river . Along with the artifacts being stockpiled for Culture Ministry safekeeping are many bulky architectural features : chunks of wall and aqueduct , a nine-foot-tall stone storage jar prized out of the digs by cranes . Some of the fragments will go_back underground as displays in new Metro stations . While the stations , de_facto , need access to the surface , the tunnels between them will be dug_in bedrock around 60 feet deep to avoid disturbing whatever lies above . Workers manipulating huge , jet-engine-shaped mechanical diggers will use boring techniques perfected in construction of the &quot; Chunnel &quot; that connects Britain and France under the_English Channel . To minimize damage to known archeological sites , several stations -- Olympion , Monastiraki and Akademia -- will be built by underground tunneling rather than surface excavation . Elsewhere , though , many features will be destroyed , particularly at Syntagma , the system ' s only two-level station . &quot; Every station hides its own secrets . . . baths , a market , the ruins of a Byzantine_church at Monastiraki . In some stations we can move things slightly to preserve archeological features , but here at Syntagma a lot will be lost , &quot; Zachariadou said . She ' s not one to vouchsafe Athens ' thirst for better transportation , or the need to keep Metro construction moving . Still , Zachariadou said , on the day this spring when the bulldozers come_to Syntagma , she intends to be far , far away .</TEXT>
