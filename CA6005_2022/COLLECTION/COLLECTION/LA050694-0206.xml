   <HEADLINE> WHITE_HOUSE TO GIVE FISKE ALL FILES ON FOSTER ; WHITEWATER : SPECIAL COUNSEL IS SAID TO BE FOCUSING_ON ACTIONS OF CLINTON AIDES IN AFTERMATH OF DEATH . SUBPOENA ALSO INCLUDES EX-AIDE NUSSBAUM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The White_House agreed Thursday to turn_over to Whitewater special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr . all_of its documents connected to Vincent Foster , the deputy White_House counsel whose death last July has been ruled a suicide . Deputy White_House Counsel Joel Klein said that he believes Fiske now is investigating the actions of White_House officials , including then-White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum , in the aftermath of Foster ' s death . Klein told reporters that he believes Fiske , who has a broad mandate to investigate the Whitewater scandal and related incidents , already has completed his investigation into Foster ' s death and has agreed with the U.S. Park Police that it was , in fact , a suicide . A comprehensive subpoena received by the White_House on Thursday covers all documents , memos , computer disks and any paging device or beeper used by Foster or related materials held by his assistant , Deborah Gorham . It also asks_for documents relating to Foster that may have been kept_in a safe in Nussbaum ' s office . Klein made_it clear that he believes Fiske wants the documents as part of a review that &quot; deals with the distribution of Mr. Foster ' s files by Nussbaum. &quot; Controversy has swirled around the actions of Nussbaum and other White_House officials since it was revealed that White_House officials had removed files from Foster ' s office shortly after his death . Investigators have raised questions about a search of Foster ' s office on the night of his death conducted by Nussbaum and White_House officials Margaret A . William , the First_Lady ' s chief_of_staff , and Patsy Thomasson , a longtime Clinton associate . Secret_Service officials secured Foster ' s office the next day . A 2 1 / 2-hour session that took_place two days after the death raised concerns as well . At that time , Nussbaum sorted through his deputy ' s papers in the presence of officials from the U.S. Park Police , the Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation and the Justice_Department . Nussbaum sorted the documents into three piles -- files related to official government business , Foster ' s private papers and the Clintons ' personal documents . The White_House later turned_over Foster ' s personal materials to his family attorney , Jim Hamilton , and the Clintons ' papers , including documents related to Whitewater , to the Clintons ' attorney , David Kendall . Kendall has since turned_over Whitewater-related documents to Fiske ' s office but has not yet received a broader order covering all_the Clinton personal papers given to him after Foster ' s death . Hamilton refused to comment Thursday when asked if he had received a new subpoena . Nussbaum ' s actions during the investigation of Foster ' s death brought allegations that the White_House was trying to hold_back relevant information from law_enforcement investigators , charges that the White_House denied . Nussbaum resigned under_fire in March . Klein said that all_of Nussbaum ' s files are still at the White_House and that relevant materials from them would be turned_over to Fiske . It is not known , however , if Nussbaum will receive a separate subpoena . Foster was a close friend of President Clinton and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . He handled some of their personal legal affairs , including the sale of their interest in Whitewater Development Corp. , the failed Ozarks real_estate venture that is at the heart of the Whitewater controversy . Klein said that &quot; there is nothing in the subpoena suggesting that ( Fiske ) is looking_at the question of Foster ' s suicide. &quot; He added that &quot; I believe the forensic evidence on Foster ' s suicide has been dealt with separately. &quot; The Park Police conducted the initial investigation after Foster ' s body was found in a park in Virginia outside Washington . The White_House has strenuously denied unsubstantiated , but widely circulated , rumors that Foster may have been murdered .</TEXT>
