   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; WHY JURORS ERR : THEY ' RE JUST HUMAN ; AS THE SIMPSON TRIAL OPENS , JURIES ' CREDIBILITY IS UNDER SCRUTINY . EXPERTS SAY ANY PANEL IS VULNERABLE TO BIASES AND MISSTEPS . BUT THE SYSTEM STILL MANAGES TO PRODUCE SOUND VERDICTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Listening to the car radio one morning last fall , Hazel Thornton heard callers to a talk_show belittle the jurors in the Reginald O . Denny beating trial , which had just ended . The &quot; stupid idiots , &quot; she heard them say . Thornton shuddered . She was a juror in the trial of Erik Menendez , who was accused with his brother of murdering their wealthy parents . As she drove to the courthouse , she worried that &quot; people might say the same thing against us. &quot; When she met her fellow jurors that day , she made_a_point of polling them to find_out how many had college degrees . It was a defensive gesture -- to prove they were smart . Nonetheless , when her jury deadlocked many weeks later , Thornton and fellow jurors became the butt of jokes across the country . Their failure to convict prompted people to ask : Is there something wrong with the jury_system ? Now O.J. Simpson will be tried in the murders of his former wife and her friend , providing the world with a forum for examining the flaws of juries in yet another Los Angeles case . Jurors do make lots of mistakes . They err most often in understanding and applying the letter of the law and may bend it when their sympathies or biases favor a particular outcome . In criminal cases , for instance , one survey showed they are more likely to acquit a guilty person than to convict someone who is innocent . But for all their faults , juries usually manage to produce verdicts that are defensible , if not perfect , according to social_scientists . &quot; It depends_on what your tolerance for error is , &quot; said forensic psychologist Elizabeth Loftus . &quot; We have a system that works well a lot of the time , but it also makes mistakes. &quot; The imperfections of jurors reflect the frailties of human nature : * They can be capricious , swayed by emotional appeals or prejudice , and will ignore the law if they believe its result would be unjust . * Juries sometimes just cannot agree and deadlock , a problem that appears to be more acute in parts of California than elsewhere . * Jurors have trouble understanding judges who give convoluted instructions and become overwhelmed by complex evidence . * In long trials , which often are the most highly publicized , jurors can be influenced by the unusual pressures , and the composition of the panels tends to be different . Even their most ardent defenders believe jurors should be given a more active role during trials to improve their comprehension . In the tradition-bound judicial_system , jurors usually are not allowed to ask questions or even take_notes . They are only instructed about the law at the end of a trial , after they may already have formed strong impressions . Some jurors complain that they had questions about key elements of the case and resent being forced to reach a verdict without obtaining the answers . &quot; There isn ' t anything fundamentally wrong with having ordinary people make important decisions , &quot; said Saul Kassin , a forensic psychologist at Williams College in Massachusetts . &quot; But there is a lot wrong with the way jury trials are managed. &quot; Sometimes the public unfairly blames jurors for unpopular verdicts that can be traced instead to key mistakes in rulings by judges or poor performances by the lawyers . The evidence jurors are allowed to consider also may be substantially different from what the public may know about a case . Many believe the prosecution was weak in the state trial in which the jury failed to convict four Los Angeles police_officers accused of beating motorist Rodney G . King in 1991 . The later federal trial , which produced convictions of two officers on civil_rights charges , was starkly different from the first , from the evidence presented by the prosecution to the judge ' s instructions to the jury . Jurors may have feared the possibility of unrest when they produced only one felony conviction against two men accused of beating truck_driver Denny at one of the flash_points of the riots that followed the initial King verdict . But most legal_experts believe the prosecution erred in bringing excessive charges against the defendants . Judges are more apt to convict than juries , surveys indicate , but nevertheless agree with most jury verdicts in their courtrooms . Even when jurors become muddled by complicated evidence , their verdicts are usually sound , research shows , because the most capable member of the panel guides the deliberations . &quot; The weakness is that there is always one bleeding heart in there who has to be convinced , &quot; said Long_Beach resident Edith Downey , 56 , who has sat on four Los Angeles County criminal juries . &quot; But generally they come_around because of logic. &quot; Blaming the jury for unpopular verdicts is nothing new : Until the late 17th Century , jurors in England could be fined or imprisoned for returning a verdict opposed by the court . And just a decade ago such prominent Americans as then-U.S. Supreme Court Chief_Justice Warren Burger were deriding the ability of juries to decide complicated civil cases . * When Jurors ' Emotions Rule Borrowed from the_British , the early American jury_system reflected the public distrust of judges from colonial times . When memories of the Revolution dimmed and competent judges became more plentiful , American courts began reining_in juries , allowing judges to reverse decisions and instruct jurors . What concerns many critics today is that jurors have not been reined_in enough . They can allow their emotions and personal experiences to color their perceptions of the evidence , a fault acknowledged even by the system ' s strongest defenders . &quot; Jurors will hang their hats on the most insane things , &quot; said John Tyre , a Los Angeles County criminal defense_attorney for 13 years . Even though verdicts are by and large correct , he said , &quot; they will look_up at the defendant and say , ' He has a tattoo . He must be a bad guy. ' It scares me sometimes to think_about the stuff that goes on. &quot; In a personal injury civil trial , Loftus said , a jury awarded little money to a woman who suffered horrible back pain because they noticed she had changed her toenail polish three times during the trial . The weather was hot , and the woman wore sandals to court . &quot; They figured her back couldn ' t have hurt that much if she could bend down to paint her toenails , &quot; said Loftus , a professor of psychology at the University of Washington . &quot; So it is those kinds of things you do have to worry about . . . . Jurors bring_in their personal stories and personal experiences all_the time. &quot; During Menendez trial deliberations , a man on Erik Menendez ' s panel told fellow jurors of wishing his parents had attended his football games when he was young . He argued that Jose Menendez could not have been as bad as his sons portrayed him because he had attended his sons ' tennis games . The juror was one of five who voted for first-degree murder . Some researchers believe caprice may be to blame for an Aug . 19 jury award of $ 2.9 million to a New Mexico woman who was scalded by coffee at a McDonald ' s restaurant . ( A state judge recently reduced the award by more_than 75 % . ) McDonald ' s serves unusually hot coffee , and the elderly woman who spilled it suffered third-degree_burns . The jury learned that other customers had also been burned , but the corporation had failed to post warnings . &quot; Usually the jury gets mad , &quot; said jury consultant Thomas Beisecker , who teaches about juries at the University of Kansas in Lawrence . &quot; Usually there is someone in the courtroom they don ' t like . It could be the behavior of . . . the corporate representatives. &quot; Sympathy , like anger , also may color a verdict . Skillful defense_lawyers often try to put someone other_than the defendant on_trial . Many years ago Texas defense_lawyer Percy Foreman did this when he defended a woman who confessed to shooting her husband to death . During the trial , described by jury experts Valerie Hans and Neil Vidmar in their book &quot; Judging the Jury , &quot; the flamboyant defense_lawyer presented evidence that the husband had poisoned dogs , stomped a puppy to death and wrung the neck of a parakeet . The jury acquitted the wife . &quot; The jury was ready to dig_up the deceased and shoot him all_over again , &quot; said Foreman , who also represented the convicted assassin of Martin_Luther_King Jr . Foreman died in 1988 . This tendency to blame victims is part of the American psyche , according to Hans . She said it is reflected in some tabloid reports that suggest Nicole Brown Simpson may have been promiscuous . Another consultant said such coverage may be sparking sympathy for the ex-athlete . &quot; If you have a defendant who is attractive in some form to the jurors , there will be some degree of sympathy and it will tend to overcome the evidence , &quot; Beisecker said . &quot; But if the evidence is clear , it probably will not. &quot; Prejudice also can creep into deliberations . Sharon Danley , a 45-year-old medical transcriber , was called to serve on a jury in Santa Monica several years ago and anticipated a quick verdict . Two men had been accused of committing a sex_act in a restroom . They denied the charge , and the defense challenged the integrity of a security_guard who claimed to have seen them . Most jurors wanted to acquit , but one woman refused to budge , making derogatory comments about gays . &quot; I have been in the theater , &quot; Danley quoted her as saying . &quot; I know what these people are like. &quot; The jury hung . * When Juries Get Stuck The deadlock , after a week of deliberations , was frustrating for Danley , but no match for what Jude Nelson went_through . Nelson was a juror in the Lyle Menendez trial . He reported for duty June 12 , 1993 , and was not released until Jan . 29 , 1994 , when his panel deadlocked after five weeks of deliberations . Half the jurors favored convicting Menendez of murder , the other half of voluntary manslaughter . &quot; I spent 25 days there just hollering and screaming and yelling to no avail , &quot; said Nelson , who voted for first-degree murder . Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti was so frustrated that he called_on Californians to consider dropping the unanimous verdict requirement for some kinds of criminal cases . Statistics on deadlocked juries compiled by The Times suggest the prosecutor may indeed have cause for concern . Many experts believe about 5 % of juries nationally deadlock , forcing retrials at considerable expense , compromises , or , in criminal cases , dismissal of charges . But deadlock rates reported by prosecutors in five large California counties range from 13 % in Los Angeles in 1993 for felony trials to 6 % in Alameda County , which includes Oakland and Berkeley . By comparison , 2.3 % of felony trials in New York ' s Manhattan borough deadlocked in 1993 , and 1.88 % in Florida ' s Dade County , which includes Miami . The national rate for criminal trials in federal_court was 2.65 % . Federal juries in California deadlocked at about twice that rate -- 4.59 % of the time . Some critics suspect juries in California may be more erratic because of the state ' s cultural climate . Harvard law_school professor Alan Dershowitz -- months before he joined Simpson ' s defense_team -- condemned California as &quot; the laughingstock &quot; of the nation because its juries fail to convict &quot; obviously guilty &quot; people . &quot; I don ' t think I want to be quoted on this , &quot; said one prominent jury researcher , &quot; but maybe you have more crazy people out there in California . One of the ways juries get hung -- it is not frequent , but it happens -- is that people think God tells them this is a guilty or innocent person , and they refuse to deliberate. &quot; Garcetti said the higher rates in California might be explained by Proposition 115 , the 1990 ballot measure that limited the ability of attorneys to screen prospective jurors . Many attorneys contend that judges , who can now do all_the questioning , fail to probe deeply enough for biases that could deadlock a jury . Researchers also cite a variety of other possible explanations for the disparity : different charging practices among counties , more diverse jury pools for some courts and differences in jury instructions . Juries usually deadlock when the evidence is evenly balanced . Those that vote before deliberating or by secret_ballot tend to deadlock more often than juries that vote openly after discussion . Nevertheless , most juries reach consensus because the pressure of the group is usually too strong . Unlike Henry Fonda in &quot; Twelve Angry Men , &quot; jurors whose views are in the minority usually cave_in . The smaller the jury , researchers believe , the less likely it will deadlock because there will be fewer minority jurors to support each other . Sometimes dissenting jurors give_up just so they can go_home . Jurors have even been known to toss a coin , according to Cal State Dominguez Hills law professor Franklin Strier , author of a new book on juries . San Francisco U.S. Atty . Michael Yamaguchi , explaining the fewer hung juries in federal_court , noted that California law requires jurors in state trials to find guilt &quot; beyond a moral certainty , &quot; whereas federal jurors are given a less precise -- and easier-to-meet -- definition of &quot; reasonable doubt. &quot; Federal judges are also allowed to exert more pressure than California judges to break deadlocks . By giving what is known as the &quot; dynamite &quot; instruction , federal judges urge the minority on the juries to re-examine the case and try to reach agreement . The strains of serving on notorious cases also may exacerbate divisions on the panel , although jurors usually feel even greater pressure to reach a verdict . For Nelson , the Menendez case meant sitting around day after day , confined in close quarters , always at the beck and call of the court . &quot; It was stressful in that we had these responsibilities put upon us , &quot; said Nelson , who said he lost his job as a rock_band manager because of the trial ' s length . &quot; I felt a lot of pressure to reach a verdict . I was incredibly frustrated and angry. &quot; * Who Serves on Long Trials It is not known whether juries in notorious cases like the Menendez killings actually deadlock more_than others . What is known is that their makeup is probably different because few people can afford to serve on long trials . Although spot surveys indicate that people who show_up for jury duty are more educated than the general population , jurors who serve in cases longer than 20 days may be an exception . Those panels tend to have fewer college graduates and more unemployed , retired , female and unmarried members , according to a 1987 study of federal civil trials by the Washington-based Federal Judicial Center . In jury questionnaires obtained by The Times , jurors in recent Los Angeles death_penalty trials lasting one to two months were overwhelmingly retirees or employees of the Post_Office or other government_agencies or aerospace firms that pay_for extended service . Attorneys complain that both lower-income and upper-income residents rarely serve in protracted cases . Certain occupations may be overrepresented on such juries . This may happen when a major employer in town has generous jury benefits . Engineers -- &quot; people who want to make the pieces fit &quot; -- sit frequently on juries in Seattle because Boeing pays well for jury duty , Loftus said . Such imbalances can be a factor_in the outcome of some cases . An engineer may be more likely to evaluate scientific evidence properly -- or to balk at a conviction if the evidence does not neatly fit together , consultants say . Jurors ' age can also play a role . For example , a majority of the King jurors in the state trial were 50 or older -- the kind more likely to be sympathetic to the police , experts said . The jury in the second trial had only three jurors over 50 , according to a jury consultant for the defense . * Trouble With the Law When jurors err , it is often because they do not follow directions . They have enormous trouble understanding the judges ' instructions , a problem social_scientists blame on legal mumbo_jumbo , not on jurors ' intelligence . &quot; The most serious problem that jurors encounter in their efforts to get things right appears to be an inability to apply instructions correctly , &quot; said Richard Lempert , a professor of law and sociology at the University of Michigan . Sometimes jurors are given too_little direction . In one major civil trial , jurors unknowingly denied the plaintiff money because they could not understand the verdict form . The judge had never bothered to explain it . The law also asks jurors to do what experts contend is nearly impossible -- to wipe from their minds facts they are not legally supposed to consider . When the men accused of beating truck_driver Denny went_on trial , the news media and community leaders expressed fears that harsh verdicts might spark renewed unrest . The judge told the jurors not to consider the ramifications of their verdicts , but some did . Jo-Ellan Dimitrius , the Pasadena trial consultant who was hired by the Denny defendants and now works for Simpson , said one juror went_to the blackboard during the last_day of deliberations and wrote the words &quot; Compassion , &quot; &quot; Unity &quot; and &quot; Future. &quot; The juror later explained that he wanted panelists to have compassion for each other and hoped the verdict would bring unity to Los Angeles ' future . The Denny jurors &quot; hated one another , &quot; Dimitrius said , threatening and swearing at one another during deliberations . Although the juror insisted he had not considered the verdict ' s ramifications , the possibility of unrest &quot; subconsciously &quot; affected him , said Dimitrius , who interviewed the jurors after the trial . The Denny jurors returned one felony conviction out of 15 counts filed . The felony , a mayhem conviction against 20-year-old Damian Monroe Williams , was the lesser of two options and carried a maximum prison_term of eight years instead of life . ( Even judges can ' t help but consider facts they should ignore . In one experiment , judges awarded a person injured in a burning accident more money when they knew that the corporation had tried to recall the responsible device -- despite being told to ignore that evidence. ) Sometimes the evidence is too complex for most jurors , or so dry and technical that they tune out , counting the light fixtures overhead to relieve their boredom . The kind of evidence that will be critical in the Simpson trial particularly stumps jurors , according to jury experts . Jurors tend either to overestimate or undervalue the importance of such scientific evidence as DNA because the error rates and statistical probabilities are confusing . Not surprisingly , research suggests that the more educated the jury , the more likely it is to interpret the evidence correctly and produce a sound verdict . But requiring a minimum level of education could deprive panels of people with an understanding of issues gained outside the classroom , some experts argue . &quot; The jury benefits from diverse perspectives , &quot; Lempert said . &quot; So you don ' t want all jurors to reach a certain magic standard because the janitor may know some things about how pipes work , or somebody else might know something about how the police work. &quot; Hazel Thornton ' s fellow jurors in Erik Menendez ' s trial included blue-collar workers and a Ph.D. Several had college degrees . After her panel deadlocked , she said she heard someone on talk radio declare that it looked as though &quot; they had just moved the stupid Denny jury over to the Menendez case. &quot; Despite her early angst , Thornton , who voted for manslaughter instead of murder , is bearing the ridicule well . &quot; They don ' t know what they are talking_about , &quot; said the 37-year-old telephone_company engineer . &quot; They weren ' t there. &quot; Next : Manipulating the jury . About This Series In this four-part series , The Times examines the strengths and flaws of the American jury_system and the need for reform . * Today : Deadlocks in recent high-profile cases have thrown the spotlight on the U.S. jury_system , raising questions about whether it deserves to survive . * Monday : High-priced consultants are helping defendants pick favorable juries , but how much of a difference can they really make ? * Tuesday : The Times Poll examines attitudes toward jury service and the jury_system in Los Angeles County . * Wednesday : Warning that the jury trial system could self-destruct without change , a small but growing number of legal_experts are calling_for sweeping reforms . Unable to Decide Hung juries have long infuriated the public because of the expense required to stage a new trial . Experts estimate that about 5 % of all trials end in a deadlock . Los Angeles is among several California counties that have high rates of hung juries in felony trials at the state court level . Riveting Juries America is fascinated by a good jury trial . Here are five that riveted the public and reverberated long after they ended . One case brought_about a change in the law . Two set_off riots . Some were characterized by bitter arguments among jurors that continued , in one instance , for months after the trial had concluded . Most raised questions about the impact of massive pretrial publicity on jurors ' attitudes towards the defendant . Rodney G . King * BACKGROUND : On March 3 , 1991 , motorist Rodney G . King was stopped by law_enforcement officers after a chase . Several officers were captured on videotape kicking King , an African American , and beating him with batons . Sgt . Stacey C . Koon and Officers Laurence M . Powell , Theodore J . Briseno and Timothy E . Wind , all_of the LAPD , were charged with 11 criminal counts including assault with a deadly weapon and assault under color of authority . * JURY SELECTION AND COMPOSITION : The trial was moved to Ventura County . The jury of six men and six women was seated after one month of questioning . There were 10 whites , one Latina and one Asian American but , notably , no African Americans . Jurors ' identities were kept confidential . They were evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans , ranged_in age from 38 to 65 and included retirees , professionals and blue-collar workers . * DELIBERATION TIME : The sequestered jurors deliberated for seven days . * JURY CONDUCT : The jury was bitterly divided over many of the charges . Some jurors who spoke_to reporters demanded anonymity . Some feared retaliation ; some reeived death threats . * RESULT : The jury found the officers not_guilty on 10 counts and was deadlocked 8 to 4 in favor of acquittal on one count against Powell . Reaction was swift , with many calling the verdicts racist . Hours after the verdicts , angry citizens torched buildings and looted stores in became three days of the worst urban rioting in U.S. history . Powell and Koon were convicted in a federal civil_rights trial and are now serving prison sentences . Erik &amp; Lyle Menendez * BACKGROUND : The brothers were charged with first-degree murder in the 1989 shotgun slayings of their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion . The prosecution portrayed them as coldblooded killers motivated by greed . The defense claimed they killed in self-defense after years of emotional , physical and sexual abuse . The charges carried the death_penalty . They were tried together , before separate juries . * JURY SELECTION AND COMPOSITION : Selection was complicated by intense pretrial publicity , which the defense contended jeopardized the brothers ' right to a fair trial . Jury selection took approximately three weeks for Lyle Menendez ' s jury and a week longer for his brother ' s . Prospective jurors filled_out a 34-page questionnaire which probed issues of sexual abuse , family violence and self-defense . Lyle ' s jury had five men and and seven women ; seven of the jurors were parents . Erik ' s jury had six men and six women ; nine were parents , seven were over 50 . * DELIBERATION TIME : The jury for Lyle Menendez deliberated 25 days before announcing that it was hopelessly deadlocked . The Erik Menendez jury deliberated for 19 days before deadlocking . * JURY CONDUCT : Jurors were not sequestered . In the Erik Menendez jury , votes were split largely along gender lines , with the votes for first-degree murder verdict in the killing of Jose Menendez all cast by men . One juror recently accused another in a lawsuit of slandering her on a TV talk_show . * RESULT : Both trials ended in hung juries . The case spawned book and movie deals . The brothers remain in custody without bail awaiting retrial . Bernhard Goetz * BACKGROUND : Goetz , who is white , shot four black teen-agers on a New York subway in 1984 . He claimed they were about to rob and beat him ; the young_men said they were only panhandling . Goetz was seen by some as a hero acting in self-defense and by others as a trigger-happy vigilante and racist . He was charged with 13 criminal counts , including four counts of attempted murder , and faced_up to 30 years . * JURY SELECTION AND COMPOSTION : After 10 days of jury selection , 12 jurors and four alternates were seated . Six of the 12 had been victims of crimes , three in the subway . There were eight men and four women , two blacks , nine whites and one Latino . * DELIBERATION TIME : The sequestered jurors deliberated 30 hours over four days . They voted 35 times before reaching a verdict . * JURY CONDUCT : At least one juror appeared on &quot; Larry King Live &quot; after the trial . None voted to convict Goetz of the more serious crimes , according to several jurors ' reports . Two jurors sold their stories to newspapers in New York and one wrote a book . * RESULT : After a seven-week trial , Goetz was found guilty only of illegal gun possession . He was sentenced to one year in jail and a $ 5 # 000 fine . He served 250 days . One shooting victim who was paralyzed from the waist down filed a $ 50-million lawsuit against Goetz , which is still pending . William Kennedy Smith * BACKGROUND : The nephew of Sen . Edward M . Kennedy was charged with raping a woman at his family ' s estate in Palm Beach , Fla . in 1991 . The Kennedy name , as well as the senator ' s testimony , drew hundreds of journalists . The extensive coverage ignited debates about pretrial publicity and the right to a fair trial . * JURY SELECTION AND COMPOSITION : Both sides attempted to use massive pretrial publicity to influence potential jurors . Jurors were questioned about their attitudes toward the Kennedy family and about pretrial coverage . One prospective juror , called a &quot; walking mistrial &quot; by the judge , was dismissed after she revealed that members of the media had contacted her . It took three weeks to seat the six-person jury of four women and two men . The jurors were sequestered ; their average age was 52 and none were college graduates . * DELIBERATION TIME : After 10 days of trial , jury deliberation took only 77 minutes . * JURY CONDUCT : Two female jurors wiped_away tears as the verdict was read . One appeared on the Phil Donahue TV_show with Smith ' s attorney after the trial . The attorney , Roy Black , and the juror began dating a year after the trial . * RESULT : Smith was found innocent on the rape charge and a misdemeanor count of simple battery . His accuser shed her anonymity and agreed to be interviewed . Most , but not all , news organizations had withheld her identity when she testified because of policies against publishing the identity of accusers in rape cases . Dan White * BACKGROUND : In November , 1978 , White , a former police_officer and a conservative law-and-order San Francisco supervisor , shot and killed liberal Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk , San Francisco ' s first openly gay public official . White , who had resigned his seat 17 days earlier , shot Moscone after the mayor refused to reappoint him . Milk had reportedly argued against his reinstatement . The murders changed the political landscape of the city . * JURY SELECTION AND COMPOSITION : The jury of seven women and five men , mainly white , middle-class and Catholic , like White , was selected from a panel of 250 people . Six of the 12 jurors wept openly when a tape of White ' s sobbing confession . * DELIBERATION TIME : The panel deliberated 36 hours over six days , reaching unanimous guilty verdicts , first on the Moscone slaying and three days later on Milk ' s slaying . * JURY CONDUCT : Jurors , who were sequestered , received death threats . Some changed jobs and some moved_out of the Bay Area . One said it was &quot; the worst thing that ever happened to me. &quot; * RESULT : White , who was facing the death_penalty , was found guilty of the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter . The defense had argued that White was suffering from a deep depression aggravated by eating sugary junk food and was acting with diminished capacity . This became known as the &quot; Twinkie defense. &quot; The verdict touched_off a night of rioting in San Francisco . In 1981 , the diminished-capacity defense was abolished . White served a little more_than five years in prison , was paroled in 1984 and committed suicide in 1985 .
