   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; TOP-SEEDED RUSSIANS STORM PAST NORWAY ; HOCKEY : DESPITE DMITRIEV ' S DISCLAIMERS , THE 5-1 VICTORY OVER THE 11TH-SEEDED HOSTS IS IMPRESSIVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Igor Dmitriev ' s mood was as dark as his sober wool suit , his face fixed in a frown that transcended the language_barrier . &quot; We were lucky , &quot; the assistant coach of Russia ' s Olympic hockey_team said through an interpreter after a 5-1 victory over Norway here Saturday . &quot; It was obvious with our defense , because they were not ready for such sharp and speedy moves of the forwards of the Norwegian team. &quot; Dmitriev ' s poor-mouthing didn ' t go_over well with Norwegian Coach Bengt Ohlson , who was sitting a_few feet away . &quot; This Russian team is very strong , &quot; Ohlson said . &quot; Even if they say something else , they know it ' s strong. &quot; Perhaps not as dominant as the Soviet and Unified teams that won seven of the last eight Olympic gold medals , the top-seeded Russian team was more_than capable of manhandling the willing but overmatched Norwegians . The 11th-seeded host team , backed by a crowd of 5 # 200 , kept the score close through two periods but was thrashed in the final 20 minutes . A short-handed goal by wing Valeri Karpov , the Mighty Ducks ' 56th pick in last June ' s draft , deflated the Norwegian players with 7:24 to play and gave Russia a 4-1 lead . Sergei Sorokin ' s wrist shot , set_up on a drop pass_by Ravil Gusmanov , sent the fans streaming to the exits with 5:21 to play . &quot; They don ' t seem to be as sharp as I ' ve seen them play before , &quot; Norwegian goaltender Robert Schistad said . &quot; They ' re certainly not the machine they were in the ' 70s. &quot; Schistad is a native of Wingham , Canada , northwest of Toronto . He moved to Norway seven years ago and was eligible for the Olympic team because his father was born in Norway . &quot; I really enjoy playing against the Russians , &quot; Schistad added . &quot; It ' s a challenge , and I usually play much better against them than against other teams , so today is a bit of a letdown. &quot; Schistad was in goal for Norway ' s surprising 2-2 tie with Russia at the Izvestia tournament last December in Moscow and for a 5-2 victory in the Telehockey tournament in Norway in November . The Russian team has changed significantly since then , however , blending players from the Russian teams that finished 1-2 in the Izvestia competition . The first_period provided Norway reason for optimism , even though the Russians took a 2-0 lead before the game was four minutes old . Capitalizing on a defensive breakdown , Gusmanov came_around from behind the net and was unchecked , allowing him to flick a shot inside the right post 23 seconds into the game . Sergei Berezine scored at 3:27 on a short-handed breakaway . The Norwegians made the score 2-1 at 18:19 , when Marius Rath took a cross-ice pass from Espen Knutsen and got_behind defenseman Oleg Chargorodski for an unchallenged shot at Andrei Zuev . &quot; The boys never gave_up , &quot; said Ohlson , a Swede . &quot; But then they scored the fourth goal , and it was over. &quot; Russia will play seventh-seeded Finland , which scored a 3-1 upset of the third-seeded Czech Republic , on Monday . This Russian team doesn ' t appear to be in danger of disgracing its great Olympic hockey tradition . &quot; We must be frank , &quot; Dmitriev said , smiling for the first time . &quot; There is no team here with the idea that it is here to lose . Every team will be disappointed if they are losing. &quot; In Saturday ' s other game , Germany beat Austria , 4-3 .</TEXT>
