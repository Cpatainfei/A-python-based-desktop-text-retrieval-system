   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; MOSCOW ' S STRATEGIC FOCUS SHIFTS AS TROOPS PULL_OUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There was little breast-beating . No moaning about strategic territory lost . Russia ' s equanimity on Wednesday as it watched what some here call &quot; The Great Retreat &quot; pointed_up just how deeply the Kremlin ' s foreign and military doctrine have changed since the Cold_War . With only a_few spasms of nostalgia , Moscow marched away from the German bases that for decades served as the beefed-up vanguard for a possible land war in Europe . President Boris N . Yeltsin called the Russian withdrawal &quot; natural. &quot; Only the final pullout from the Baltic_states of Latvia and Estonia raised hackles here , and that was not because of the land but because of the people left_behind . &quot; The geopolitical situation has changed radically and there is no more threat from the West , &quot; said Sergei Blagovolin , a top Russian national security analyst . &quot; But I am really worried about the uncertainty of the fate of the Russians left in the Baltics. &quot; The scenarios that most concern Moscow ' s strategic planners do not focus_on East-West war these days , but rather on potential threats to Russians in other former Soviet republics that could force Moscow , still a nuclear-armed colossus with nearly 2 million troops , to intervene . Russia , according to its 1994 military doctrine , has no enemies . But , as Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev put it , &quot; It has its vital interests . We are ready to defend them and we are capable of doing this , &quot; even if that involves stepping over the border . There is little of the black-and-white clarity of the Cold_War here , more of the murkiness of the era that follows . But as vital interests are being defined , they appear to boil_down to defending rights of Russians in the &quot; near-abroad &quot; -- former Soviet republics -- and maintaining powerful Russian clout while seeking stability throughout the former Soviet_Union . Latvia and Estonia , where sizable Russian minorities have been denied full citizenship rights , may be just the tinderbox Moscow fears . Imagine this scenario , said Dmitry Evstafiev , a military analyst at the prestigious USA-Canada Institute in Moscow . With the last Russian soldier gone , Baltic parliaments refuse to ratify agreements with Moscow to play fair with their Russian populations and instead appear to prepare_for &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; in heavily Russian areas . Yeltsin ' s political opponents &quot; call to sweep the Baltics into the sea , &quot; Evstafiev projected further . &quot; Yeltsin puts the troops of the Leningrad military district on alert , international pressure doesn ' t help . . . . &quot; And large-scale confrontation results . That , of course , is a far-fetched , worst-case scenario . But it seems far likelier now than a European land war . The 25 million Russians who ended_up in the &quot; near-abroad &quot; are the only foreign_policy issue that has real political resonance here . And many Russians are feeling decidedly hostile toward the Baltics , Evstafiev noted . But aside from the potential tensions there , Russia ' s strategic view has narrowed to_the_point that the other top concerns stemming from the Great Retreat are mainly domestic . First on the list is the shortage of housing for returning officers and of military infrastructure for troops , some of whom have reportedly found themselves newly deployed in empty fields . Estimates vary , but apparently 50 # 000 officers ' families have no apartments in Russia . &quot; It is very likely that the slowness in addressing the housing issue will eventually lead to open discontent among officers when the troops withdrawn from the Baltics and Germany arrive here , &quot; Col . Yuri Deryugin , a military sociologist , wrote last week in Nezivisimaya Gazeta . He predicted eventual &quot; social upheaval &quot; in the Russian armed forces . He noted that the Great Retreat would worsen tensions in the army , not only because of housing problems , but because of a special virus that the soldiers from Germany are carrying : virulent military corruption . As Russian and German sources describe them , soldiers returning from Germany have been corrupted to the toes of their boots -- if they haven ' t sold them yet . They reportedly engaged in rackets ranging from selling_off duty-free cigarettes to hawking arms to neo-Nazis . The corruption is believed to have penetrated even to the top brass of what was known as the Western Group of Forces . Now these bootleggers are returning home -- and Deryugin warned that a &quot; military commercial clan &quot; may now be unleashed on the army . If the withdrawal is sounding few alarms otherwise , that is because Russia , as it has defined its new interests , is looking largely south and east for new threats to itself . Russia retains bases or facilities in almost all_the former Soviet republics . Ukraine remains a particular source of anxiety , because of the restive Russian population of the Crimea and because of the chance of eventual civil_war between its Russian-leaning east and Ukrainian nationalists in the west . In the Caucasus and Central Asia , Russia is especially assertive about maintaining its troop presence , usually arguing that it must preserve order near its borders . Many Caucasus politicians , particularly in Georgia and Azerbaijan , believe that Russia purposely foments conflicts in areas where it wants an excuse to bring_in forces . In their view , Russia may be ending its half-century occupation of Eastern Europe and the Baltics , but its dominion in the south has lasted centuries and will not prove so transient .</TEXT>
