   <HEADLINE> BRAZIL INMATES FREE CAPTIVES , FLEE ON FOOT ; KIDNAPING : CARDINAL , 12 OTHER HOSTAGES ARE UNHARMED . CONVICTS ESCAPE AFTER SHOOTOUT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Inmates who fled a prison with a Roman_Catholic cardinal and 12 other hostages left their captives behind and fled on foot early Wednesday after crashing their armored van into a tree . Cardinal Aloisio Lorscheider , 69 , complained only of stiff legs after his release . He said he had &quot; prayed for and forgiven &quot; the prisoners who had seized him and other hostages at knifepoint Tuesday while they were visiting the jail as part of a human_rights commission . Thirteen inmates held sharpened spoons to the throats of the hostages at the maximum-security Paulo Sarasate Prison near Fortaleza , 1 # 750 miles north of Rio de Janeiro . A shootout left two inmates dead and two police_officers and a guard wounded . After 12 hours of negotiations , police agreed to permit the prisoners to leave , providing the armored van and weapons . In exchange , the inmates were to release most of their hostages . But instead , they dumped only the wounded guard out of the van as they sped past the prison gates . With police behind them , the fugitives drove throughout the night . At one point , they stopped at the home of 22-year-old Robertson Francisco ' s parents . Francisco -- one of the leaders of the rebellion , who was serving time for double homicide -- gave the hostages milk , his mother , Liduina de Aguiar Muniz , told reporters . &quot; One of the prisoners apologized to the hostages , saying it was the only way , &quot; she said . The fugitives and their hostages then took_off again . Another freed hostage , Father Aldo Padotto , said the prisoners grew desperate as the van had difficulty climbing steep hills . After the van crashed into the tree , they abandoned it and let the captives go . &quot; But it was hours of terrible tension , &quot; Padotto said . Police arrived shortly afterward , after the hostages were safe . The inmates , armed with rifles and revolvers they had obtained as part of their deal with prison authorities , fired on police , according to military_police Lt . Paulo Neto . Thinking the prisoners were still in the van , the police sprayed it with bullets , he said . In the confusion , the fugitives ran deep into the surrounding woods . The fleeing prisoners were believed to include members of a notorious Rio de Janeiro gang involved in drug trafficking . The hostages included two bishops , a priest , the prison director , a state legislator , a city councilman , the councilman ' s wife , two Brazilian journalists , a photographer and two others .</TEXT>
