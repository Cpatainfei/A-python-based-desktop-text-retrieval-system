   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' S PASSION , PRIDE FILL ROSE BOWL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Throngs of giddy soccer fans turned the Rose Bowl on Saturday into a sea of curly blond wigs , flapping flags and World Cup-mania as the world ' s most popular sporting contest arrived in Southern California . The game itself featured the Colombian and Romanian national teams -- but much of the action was in the stands and on the streets : wig-wearing people paying tribute to the flowing locks of Colombia midfielder Carlos Valderrama ; national colors painted on faces and flown_on flags ; drums pounding , horns blowing , celebrants hopping in pregame victory dances . The Colombian fans greatly outnumbered the Romanians , but New York taxi driver Vladimir Moraru , who emigrated from Romania , remarked : &quot; Don ' t forget that the ball is still round for both sides. &quot; Moraru was proven correct as the Romanians defeated the favored Colombian team , 3-1 . Throughout the hard-fought contest , fans tried to create an advantage with their cheers . &quot; Hagi ! Hagi ! Hagi ! &quot; the Romanians shouted , chanting the name of their star player , Gheorghe Hagi . &quot; Asprilla ! Asprilla ! Asprilla ! &quot; the Colombians shot back with the name of one of their stars , Faustino Asprilla . The name of Gov . Pete Wilson , however , prompted a chorus of boos when he marched to the center of the field during opening ceremonies . From the moment Wilson was introduced , all_the way through his three-minute speech , the mostly Latino audience jeered him for past comments blaming illegal immigrants for many of the state ' s problems . When Wilson left the field , he faced a sea of thumbs-down gestures . &quot; We booed Wilson because he is against all Latinos , not just the illegales , &quot; said Marta Ceron , a spectator who is originally from Colombia . &quot; He wants to take_away all_of our rights. &quot; The 35-minute opening ceremony featured an entrance by Southern Californians representing each of the 24 countries competing in the World Cup . Nell Carter sang the national_anthem while four jets flew overhead and about 100 Marines unfurled a huge American flag that covered about one-third of the field . As a grand finale , Mike Fox , a member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic soccer team , placed the World Cup trophy on a pedestal and it was lifted , like a rocket ship , about 20 feet in the air . Meanwhile , the field was filled with_children in multicolored soccer outfits and adults from across the world , waving the flags of their countries . Reflecting the international flair of the day , announcements outside the Rose Bowl came_in several languages . The message was the same : Welcome to the world ' s largest sporting event -- no weapons allowed inside . Police were bracing for the worst -- patting down fans as they entered and searching packages left and right -- but officials reported no major incidents . Attendance was a near-capacity 91 # 856 -- but tickets were readily available at face_value before the game . When the game began , tickets with $ 75 face_value were going_for $ 20 . More_than 145 teams have spent the last year and a half qualifying for the quadrennial gathering , regarded_as the largest single sporting event in the world . The two_dozen qualifying teams are playing 52 games in nine cities over the next four weeks . The Rose Bowl underwent a $ 3-million face_lift for the games . Today , Sweden will meet Cameroon at 4:30 p.m. in Pasadena . On Wednesday , the United States will take_on Colombia . Those who entered the stadium Saturday ran the gamut from soccer fanatics to those who just wanted to witness opening day . &quot; I ' m not a soccer fan , &quot; acknowledged George Zorapapel , a Romanian emigre who now lives_in Monrovia . &quot; I just came because this is such an important event and I wanted once in my life to see a game like this. &quot; Zorapapel was the exception . Most were fierce partisans and die-hard soccer enthusiasts -- like Francisco Rivera , 31 , of Bogota . Soccer -- and Colombia -- pulsed through his veins . A blond wig atop his head and the Colombian colors painted on his face , Rivera beat on a drum from the nosebleed seats and declared : &quot; I feel_like I ' m in my own country . All my Colombian brothers are here. &quot; There were Mexicans , Bolivians and a dozen other countrymen too , and they joined the revelry even though they did not have a team on the field . But the most vocal ones of all were from Colombia . Leading them on was the mascot for the Colombian team , a man dressed in a yellow , blue and red bird outfit . He had a soccer_ball shaved into the back of his head . &quot; Soccer gives us a sense of identity and solidarity , &quot; he said , flapping his wings as firecrackers exploded overhead during the opening ceremony . Romanian Danny Taut held one corner of a Gargantuan Romanian flag , trying to ignore the Colombians cutting a large hole in the heart of a nearby Romanian banner . But the Romanians got their revenge at the end . When Romania scored its final goal with two minutes left in the game , Ingrid Martinez , 25 , a Bogota native who lives_in Downey , put her head in her lap . &quot; I think I ' m going_to start crying any minute , &quot; she said . &quot; Oh my God , this is so depressing. &quot; Her brother , Steve , was already sobbing into his Colombian flag , his blond wig still atop his head . After the game , Romanians sang as they marched back to their vehicles triumphantly . &quot; I ' m very happy and I ' m proud to be a Romanian , &quot; said Petruza Florina , 18 , one of 250 honor students from Romania who attended the spectacle . As soon as time ran_out , sheriff ' s deputies in riot gear stood shoulder to shoulder around the field . But neither the victorious fans nor the dejected ones attempted to break_through . A sign hanging near the scoreboard indicated just how serious this game was : &quot; Colombia -- I Love You Like My Mother. &quot; That sort of intensity was tough for some to grasp . Maryanne Vecchione of La Habra Heights plays soccer at Cal Poly Pomona and shelled_out big bucks for her ticket . But she was a little more subdued than the rest . &quot; I ' m here today but I won ' t be here tomorrow , &quot; she said . &quot; Father ' s Day is more important than this. &quot; Nearby , in Old Town Pasadena , emotions were not quite as intense . Afternoon business was down slightly at the trendy shops and restaurants and the talk_of the day centered_on the drama involving an American sports hero . Around the soccer field , though , O.J. Simpson was already old news . Fernando Velez , a 39-year-old electrician who emigrated from Colombia 12 years ago , came_to Pasadena with 14 friends who play for an amateur soccer club in Flushing , N.Y. Standing_in the sweltering heat , Velez had yellow paint dripping from his eyebrows , mixing with the blue on his ears and the red on the throat . &quot; Americans have other games -- football , basketball , &quot; Velez said . &quot; These North_Americans , they like a lot of action . We have a different philosophy . With soccer , it ' s more tactics. &quot; For Velez , the game also means national pride . &quot; Our country isn ' t really powerful but with football , we have power , we can win , &quot; said Velez , his eyes lighting_up . &quot; Our ambassadors are these players . Americans think we are a country of vices . But soccer gives us a good name. &quot; Asked if the Colombians will reach the finals , Velez put his hands together in a prayerful pose and stared at the sky . &quot; Then I can die in peace , &quot; he said . Times Staff Writers Bill Dwyre , Ann O ' Neill , Bettina Boxall , John Hurst , Susan Moffat and Patrick J . McDonnell contributed to this story . U.S. Ties Switzerland in Its World Cup Opener U.S. forward Eric Wynalda scored on a free_kick near the end of the first_half , giving the American team a 1-1 tie with Switzerland in a World Cup soccer game at Pontiac , Mich . With the tie , the United States earned its first point in the World Cup_finals since 1950 . C1 More soccer coverage , A8-9 , C8-11</TEXT>
