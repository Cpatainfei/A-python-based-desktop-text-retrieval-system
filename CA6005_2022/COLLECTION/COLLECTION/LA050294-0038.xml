   <HEADLINE> AN ELECTRIFYING MARRIAGE OF INTERESTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is certainly in the interest of cities to save on utility bills , and in the current competitive environment it is increasingly in the interest of the utilities to help them . What a marriage : energy savings for municipalities and new opportunities for utility companies trying to keep good customers . The City of Irvine recently announced collaboration with Southern California Gas Co . and Southern California Edison Co . in a deal that was billed , in a recent conference at the Aspen Institute , as a model for city governments and energy-related businesses around the world . In effect the utilities will finance $ 300 # 000 worth of energy-saving equipment for the city . This sound idea already has struck a responsive chord in Santa Monica , which is negotiating a similar deal with Edison and The Gas Co . for energy improvements as the city regroups after the Jan . 17 earthquake . Irvine says it previously saved $ 66 # 000 annually on its light bill through retrofitting . The new program is the most ambitious of its kind ; it will finance extensive modifications of cooling , lighting , ventilation and energy-control systems . The city will pay its regular bill for five years , with savings going_to finance the equipment . Eventually , the city ' s bills will be reduced permanently . It ' s easy to envision broader implications from such a partnership . Indeed , Edison says it estimates that a $ 2-billion-to- $ 4-billion market for energy conservation exists in Southern California alone . Irvine ' s deal is a good start , and more should follow .</TEXT>
