   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; FIELD OF DREAMS ; ATHLETES COMPETING FOR SCHOLARSHIPS PLAY HIGH-STAKES GAME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Richard Estrada is standing on the sidelines at the St . John Bosco-St . Paul football game in Bellflower , watching intently as the players on the field run and pass and butt heads on the line . He holds a clipboard , making notations on a form after every play , but he ' s actually holding much more_than that in his hands . What Estrada is holding are the dreams and futures of young athletes . Estrada is a professional high_school football scout . For the last six years , Estrada has worked for an Orange County-based scouting company , attending 40 to 50 high_school football games throughout Los Angeles County to assess players ' abilities , attitudes and potential . His reports , and those from other company scouts in Southern California , will be assembled and sold to colleges and universities for $ 1 # 500 to $ 2 # 000 a copy , giving them an overview of what ' s available in the Southern California high_school football market . For anxious high_school football_players who will be waiting for those college football_coaches to call , a thumbs up or a thumbs down from Estrada could be a deciding factor . Each notation he makes on that clipboard can help advance -- or demolish -- a boy ' s dreams of getting a &quot; ride &quot; -- that is , a full college scholarship . It ' s big business , this quest to get a scholarship , not just in football but in other sports , for girls as well as boys . Full or partial scholarships are available in about two_dozen sports . Since implementation in the 1970s of Title IX , which seeks to balance expenditures on women ' s sports with men ' s , the growth of women ' s athletic scholarships has been explosive . In 1991 , the last year for which figures are available , the National Collegiate Athletic Assn . reported that 90 # 000 athletes were receiving about $ 468 million in full and partial scholarships -- almost one-third of them to women -- from more_than 500 NCAA Division I and II colleges and universities . * Although the numbers are large , the size of the athletic scholarship pie actually is small , given the huge demand for a slice of it . No one knows just how many high_school athletes -- and their parents -- entertain dreams of full scholarships . But insiders estimate that no more_than 10 % of high_school athletes qualify for athletic scholarships , either full or partial . Still , Long_Beach and the surrounding areas have a rich tradition of producing great athletes . Dozens have become baseball stars , including Wilson High_School teammates Bobby Grich and Jeff Burroughs . Grich was an all-star second_baseman with the Baltimore_Orioles and the California Angels . Burroughs was the American League ' s Most_Valuable_Player in 1974 with the Texas_Rangers . Shane Mack , who graduated from Gahr High in Cerritos , attended UCLA , made the 1984 U.S. Olympic baseball_team and played for the Minnesota Twins ' 1991 World_Series champions . If it can happen to them , some parents think , maybe it can happen to my kid . As a result , many adults go_to great lengths to help their children qualify for a college athletic scholarship , which not only would ease the burden of tuition costs but just might turn_out to be a ticket to the pros . Some parents move their children into certain school districts from miles away to get them in the best , most high-profile athletic programs for their sport . Some even take their kids across the country to &quot; showcase tournaments , &quot; where college coaches and recruiters can see them in action . Other parents pay hundreds of dollars to companies that circulate athletic resumes among college coaches . Legendary El Segundo High_School baseball_Coach John Stevenson thinks that parents ' aggressiveness has gotten_out of hand . &quot; It has become a frenzy , &quot; said Stevenson . &quot; There are kids playing solely because their parents are demanding that they earn a scholarship . Kids are trying to play for the wrong reasons. &quot; Almost everyone connected with high_school sports has a story about pushy parents screaming at their kids for supposedly blowing a scholarship by missing a layup or muffing a grounder . Yet , with the average_cost of a private four-year college hovering around $ 14 # 000 a year , including tuition , room and board , who can blame a parent for thinking that it certainly would be nice if Junior or Sissy could get all or even a portion of that tuition picked_up by the school ' s athletic department ? So the question becomes , how do you help the kid do_it ? How do you increase the chances that your young athlete will get financial_aid ? Based on interviews with coaches , student athletes , scouts , recruiters and parents , here are some suggestions : Make Sure the Kid Can Play That may sound obvious , but the ability to play a sport well -- very well -- is a factor some parents overlook when they start dreaming of an athletic scholarship . Simply put , they think their young athlete is better than he or she really is . &quot; There ' s a lot of wishful_thinking going_on out there , &quot; said football scout Estrada . &quot; But you have to be realistic . Sometimes parents will come_up and ask me about their kids . I can ' t lie to them . If they ask me , I tell them the truth . Most of the time they ' re nice about it , but sometimes they don ' t want to believe me. &quot; Roger Williams , basketball_coach at La Mirada High for 17 years , thinks that parents often look through rose-colored glasses . &quot; They sometimes think their kids are better than they really are , &quot; said Williams , who has seen a_couple_of players leave La Mirada for what they thought were greener pastures , only to fail to earn a scholarship . &quot; It ' s like , ' Hey , my kid was an all-star in Little League. ' Well this isn ' t Little_League any longer . You have to perform. &quot; Of course , some kids -- a very few -- are standouts , the so-called &quot; blue chippers. &quot; For them , it ' s not a question of whether they ' re good_enough to get an athletic scholarship , but which school they will grace with their presence . Consider , for example , Long_Beach Polytechnic High_School ' s standout football lineman Brandon Whiting . At 6-foot-3 , 260 pounds , Whiting had his pick of Pac-10 schools . He chose California over Stanford , and is starting at defensive tackle as a freshman this fall . Then there was Artesia basketball star Charles O ' Bannon , who was recognized as one of the finest college prospects in the nation while still in middle_school . In his senior year , the 6-foot , 7-inch high_school All-American received offers from more_than 100 schools . O ' Bannon finally chose UCLA , where he starts alongside brother Ed O ' Bannon , who also had been the object of an intense recruiting battle . The athletic talent possessed by the O ' Bannons and Whiting are undeniable . But the trio also did_well in the classroom , something that not all athletes accomplish . Which brings us to an equally important requirement for getting an athletic scholarship . Make Sure the Kid Has Good Grades Until the early 1980s , about the only academic_requirement for playing college ball was maintaining a 1.6 grade-point average in college courses -- not a skull-busting requirement . In 1983 , however , the NCAA started requiring high_school graduates to meet minimum grade-point and SAT standards to be eligible for college scholarships . There is now a sliding scale : if you have a 2.0 GPA , you need a 900 SAT score ; if your GPA is 2.5 , you need a 700 SAT . And the GPA must be in 13 &quot; core courses &quot; -- math , English , the sciences . The rules are strict . Poor grades mean no scholarship and no play . End of story , end of dreams . Denver Broncos running back Leonard Russell , the National Football_League offensive player of the year in 1991 , had his pick of colleges when he graduated from Long_Beach Poly in 1987 . He accepted a scholarship from Arizona State , but soon found that he had shortchanged himself in high_school by not studying . &quot; As far as the academics , I knew I wasn ' t as disciplined in the classroom as I was_on the football_field , &quot; Russell once said in an interview . that ' s true at many high_schools , it seems . Says Estrada : &quot; The city of L.A. probably has_the_best athletes overall in Southern California , but a lot of times nobody ' s pushing those kids to study and go_to school . So you get a kid with maybe a high-C average , but then you look_at his SAT , and sorry , it ' s 600 -- and you get 200 just for writing your name . So those kids can ' t get scholarships. &quot; Russell graduated from Poly with a 1.8 GPA , which made him ineligible to play for Arizona State his freshman year . He wound_up playing football at Mt . San Antonio College , a junior_college in Walnut . In two seasons he boosted his GPA , and graduated with an associate ' s degree . He earned back his scholarship at Arizona State . After one season with the Sun Devils , Russell was selected by the New England Patriots in the first round of the NFL draft . Some kids flip the equation , making athletics an adjunct to getting an academic scholarship . Peninsula High_School girls ' basketball_player Katharine Foster-Keddie , a 17-year-old 6-footer who has a 3.9 GPA , recently became a semifinalist for a National Merit Scholarship . Although she ' s been approached by several colleges that provide athletic scholarships , she wants to attend an Ivy League school , preferably Harvard or Yale . Those schools do not award athletic scholarships . But she knows that being a sports standout -- she also plays volleyball -- could tip the admissions scales in her favor . Foster-Keddie and her parents also recognized another important step_in increasing the chances for a scholarship . That is . . . : Make Sure the Kid Plays Where the Decision-Makers Will See Her Because of shrinking travel budgets , especially in the so-called &quot; non-revenue sports &quot; such_as volleyball and softball , recruiters gravitate to the best teams , the ones with the stars and blue chippers , bypassing lesser-known programs . But what if you don ' t happen to live_in a district that is tops in your child ' s sport ? You can do what a lot of parents do : Move_into the district so your child can go_to school there . The O ' Bannons ' parents , Ed and Madeline O ' Bannon , moved the family in the mid-1980s from South-Central Los Angeles to a home_in Cerritos within the Artesia High_School attendance area . Basketball , they say , didn ' t figure totally in their decision to move , but the move allowed their sons to play for coach Wayne Merino , one of the most successful basketball_coaches in the area . Then there are those youths who move_on their own . Enrico Bozman , a standout running back at Bellflower High in 1992 , moved_in with the parents of his girlfriend last year , was given a hardship transfer clearance by local athletic officials , and starred at Los Alamitos High , where coach John Barnes has built a football dynasty . Almost every top program has players with similar stories of moving from sometimes far-flung areas into the school district . Basketball_coach Patrick Roy at Inglewood High_School has had players move_into the district from Artesia , the San Fernando Valley , all_over . &quot; They feel they need to come here to be seen by the coaches , &quot; Roy said . Not everyone can pick_up and move , though . Some parents find a distant relative or friend and send their kid to live there during weekdays . Some simply list a relative ' s address so their kids can attend school . Paramount football_Coach Ken Sutch , a 20-year veteran , frowns_on moving a kid for the sake of sports . &quot; They need to be settled , have friends , &quot; he said . &quot; When kids jump around from place to place , all they have is that one focus , and that makes them a pretty narrow person . that ' s a real danger. &quot; In addition to concentrating_on high_school powerhouses , recruiters spend a lot of time scouting spring and summer leagues and privately funded club teams . In girls ' sports , such_as volleyball and soccer , the vast majority of college scholarships awarded are based on an athlete ' s performance with private club teams or in private tournaments , according to Brian Gimmillaro , coach of the Cal State Long_Beach women ' s volleyball team , the defending national champions . The 20th annual UC Davis summer volleyball tournament , for example , drew more_than 7 # 000 athletes and more_than 100 college coaches and scouts in June . But what if you can ' t quite uproot your entire family just to make_sure your son or daughter is in the best sports program ? What if you can ' t afford to fly all_over the country showing_off your child at showcase tournaments ? How can you get recruiters and coaches to notice you ? The solution may be . . . : Advertise , Advertise , Advertise &quot; Unless you ' re a true blue chipper in football or basketball , you need to market yourself , &quot; said Tracy Jackson , president of College Prospects of America , an Ohio-based firm that contracts with student athletes to distribute profiles of their athletic statistics and academic record to colleges across the country . &quot; It ' s a dating service concept . We introduce athletes to colleges , and vice versa . If they want to get_married , that ' s up_to them. &quot; The oldest and largest company of its type , 9-year-old College Prospects operates through about 175 independently owned franchises in 47 states . For $ 650 , student athletes can have a complete resume sent to every college athletic program in which they might legitimately be qualified to play . Jackson makes no guarantees that they ' ll get a scholarship , but he says there ' s a money-back guarantee that the athlete will get_at least one response from a college coach . Not everyone approves of the concept -- coach Stevenson of El Segundo calls such services &quot; parasites , &quot; and even Jackson acknowledges that some fly-by-night operations have damaged the concept ' s image . But the company literature is thick_with testimonials from college and high_school coaches and parents . And some student athletes say it ' s the only way to get their names out there . Sandra Clark of Carson , whose daughter , Leslie King , 17 , is a standout softball player at Carson High_School , said the girl was hoping somebody would notice her , but nobody did . &quot; Her coach told her about it ( College Prospects ) , and since she signed_up , she ' s gotten_about 25 responses. &quot; &quot; The coaches are sending me questionnaires , &quot; said King , a senior who ' s on the honor roll and has a 3.95 GPA . &quot; I haven ' t talked to any of them yet , but I ' m hoping something will work out. &quot; &quot; It wasn ' t easy to come_up with the money ( for the service ) , &quot; Clark said . &quot; But when you consider how much college costs , we thought it was worth it. &quot; But perhaps the most important piece of advice on college athletic scholarships , according to almost everyone , is not to attach too_much importance to them . For most kids , the odds are long , the payoff often is not that great -- especially from a partial scholarship -- and the athletic scholarship may_not jibe with the student ' s educational goals . &quot; Our mission ( in high_school athletics ) is not to build college players or professional players , &quot; said Stevenson . &quot; Our mission is to provide an education , and athletics is part of the educational process . If a kid gets a scholarship , that ' s nice , but I don ' t think kids should play just for that purpose . They should play because they love to play. &quot; Times Staff Writers Paul McLeod and Rob Fernas contributed to this story .</TEXT>
