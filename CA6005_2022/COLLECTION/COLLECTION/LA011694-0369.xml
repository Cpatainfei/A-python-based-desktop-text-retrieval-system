   <HEADLINE> RETHINKING NATO : GIVING EVERYONE A SEAT AT THE TABLE ; ALLIANCE : CLINTON SHOULD LOOK TO THE 1815 CONCERT OF EUROPE AS HIS MODEL . INCLUDING RUSSIA AS PART OF THE NEW SECURITY COMMUNITY IS THE KEY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The past week may convince Bill_Clinton that his most recent predecessors were right : Foreign policy is every President ' s strong suit . It offers political escape , personal prestige and policy dominance . Before his trip to Europe , the President was_on the defensive . The Whitewater affair was stalking him politically . Health-care reform was under_attack by some Democrats and all_the various interest_groups . His nominee for defense_secretary turned_out not to have paid Social_Security for his maid . And critics denounced as inadequate the Administration ' s &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; proposal , which denied the Eastern Europeans security guarantees against aggression while allowing Russia , as well as the Eastern European_countries , to establish closer ties with the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization . Eastern European leaders vied to heap scorn on the proposal before it had even been presented . The French were threatening to rain on the President ' s European parade by pressing Clinton at the NATO meeting for military commitments on Bosnia he did not want to make . Then came the Brussels trip . Suddenly , a man known as Bill_Clinton at_home was presented to the world as William J . Clinton . The man known at_home as the Democratic occupant of the White_House was transformed abroad into the President of all Americans . The headlines abruptly turned favorable . Foreign carping ceased . The Eastern Europeans signed_on to &quot; Partnership for Peace. &quot; The French compromised on Bosnia . The President announced an agreement among Russia , Ukraine and the United States that will lead to the destruction of nuclear-tipped missiles on Ukrainian soil now targeted against the United States . In short , it was a pretty good week . How did such a reversal of fortune occur ? One reason is that , in the final analysis , the East and West Europeans really had no choice but to follow the American lead . The Eastern Europeans may have wanted formal security guarantees and immediate entry into NATO . But if they could not get these , were they going_to turn_down closer military ties with the West ? The Western Europeans may have wanted to press the Americans to become more engaged militarily in the Bosnian imbroglio . Yet , if Clinton had said the United States was willing to take decisive measures militarily , would they have followed ? But the most important reason for the President ' s triumph last week is : He was more right than his critics about his &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; proposal . The critics contend that a historic opportunity may be lost . They worry that NATO must be &quot; out of area or out of business. &quot; They urge , in the words of Republican Sen . Richard Lugar of Indiana , that NATO &quot; project stability beyond NATO ' s current borders ; &quot; that it engage in crisis management and peacekeeping , and that it &quot; lay the foundation for the integration of the East through expanded membership. &quot; But it is highly questionable whether the expansion of NATO could accomplish any of this . Eastern Europe had common borders with the Soviet_Union but does not with Russia . Stability is threatened in that region not because of a threatened Russian attack but because of boiling ethnic and economic conflicts . Leaders of Slovakia have made_it clear that the reason they want to enter NATO is not because they fear an attack from Russia but from Hungary , which is troubled over the plight of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia . Hungary is also troubled by discrimination against Hungarians in Romania . Poland recently revived the fortunes of former communists because of the economic effects of shock_therapy . Farther east , there are legitimate concerns about relations with Russia , but no one is proposing to extend NATO to the Baltic_states , Belarus and Ukraine because that would clearly trigger an immediate Russian reaction . Nor would an expanded NATO be_better equipped to engage in crisis management or peacekeeping than the current NATO . It would still be ineffective in Bosnia for the same reasons : Because no major state wants to send large_numbers of troops into combat to end what is largely a civil_war . That reality will not change if Polish or Czech defense ministers sit at the table in Brussels . Could the inclusion of the Eastern European states into NATO &quot; lay the foundation for their integration into the West ? &quot; What the Eastern Europeans need is entry into the European Union . Postponing full membership , the EU has signed association agreements with several Eastern European states in the past two years . But EU members have delayed ratification for months . Portugal has claimed it was short of translators . Belgium has complained about &quot; internal procedural problems. &quot; France cites legal difficulty . And Germany has been held hostage by the doctor ' s lobby , which objects vehemently to a provision that permits Eastern European doctors to practice in Germany . The EU now enjoys a trade surplus with impoverished Eastern Europe . Entry into NATO could marginally increase the pressure on the EU to be more responsive to the Eastern Europeans . But the question for the United States is whether the purpose of NATO should be distorted to provide a minimal boost to the membership prospects of Eastern Europeans in the EU . Critics denounce the Clinton_Administration for being too Russocentric . They are concerned by the rise of Strobe Talbott to the position of deputy secretary_of_state because he is the driving force behind current policy toward Moscow . But the Clinton_Administration deserves credit for leaving open a critical choice facing the West in the way it approaches the security issue in Europe : Does_it want to preserve a security alliance or create a security community ? A security alliance requires an enemy and it is clear who the critics have_in_mind . The president of Poland says he wants Poland to join NATO to put Russia in a &quot; cage. &quot; Most of the advocates of NATO expansion in the United States adopt a similar view but with softer edges . They propose increased contacts with the Russians to reassure them , but in the end they want the Eastern Europeans in Europe and the Russians out . But is it possible to freeze_out a major state from the decision_table ? History offers some interesting lessons on this . In 1815 , and again in 1918 , Europe faced a fundamental choice in dealing with a powerful , defeated power . In 1815 , the victorious powers decided to create a security community -- and included France in the Concert of Europe . In 1918 , the victorious powers decided to put Germany in a cage and deny it a place at Europe ' s decision_table . The choice in 1815 allowed the Europeans to go nearly 100 years without a major war . The choice in 1918 lasted little more_than 20 years . No doubt , events in Russia could make the creation of a security community impossible . In that event , the Eastern Europeans will be eager to accept whatever guarantees the West will grant them . But the approach of the Clinton_Administration is sound . Its model should be Robert Stewart Castlereagh , the_British foreign secretary in 1815 , not Woodrow Wilson , who failed in 1918 . If there is a criticism that one can make of the Administration , it is that its vision has not been bold enough . It has not clearly stated that its desired outcome would be Russian participation in Western institutions . During the formulation of the Marshall Plan , the United States invited the Soviet_Union to participate . Josef Stalin refused because he did not want to open_up his system . That choice was fateful . But even at the beginning of the Cold_War , U.S. decision-makers made_it clear that they considered Russia part of Europe . We should learn from their example .</TEXT>
