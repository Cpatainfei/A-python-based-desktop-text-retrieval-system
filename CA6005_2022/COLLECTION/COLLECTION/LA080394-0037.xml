   <HEADLINE> OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS : FIRST MARLIN OF YEAR CAUGHT OFF CATALINA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rick Macklin knew he had hooked into something special the minute his line started screaming from his reel . Macklin was fishing last Saturday with two brother-in-laws aboard his boat Popeye off the east end of Santa Catalina Island when the fish struck his lure and high-tailed it to the high_seas . It was a large striped marlin that , if successfully landed , would be the first marlin caught in California this year . It ' s a distinction local marlin fishermen strive for . The only problem was , neither of Macklin ' s companions had fished for marlin or driven a boat with state-of-the-art electronics . When Macklin grabbed the rod , Kevin Klatt took the helm . But the boat was_on auto-pilot , and Klatt had no idea how to turn it off . When he finally found the switch and turned the boat toward the fleeing fish , the marlin had taken almost all_the 30-pound-test dacron line from Macklin ' s spool . &quot; He was_on top of the water , &quot; Macklin said of the jumping billfish , &quot; and he was not happy. &quot; Klatt managed to turn the boat and give chase , Macklin gaining line along the way . A little more_than an hour after the hookup , Macklin had the fish alongside the boat . Kim Klatt grabbed the leader , and Macklin stuck the striper with a gaff . Macklin , 47 , of Huntington Harbour , secured the fish on the swimstep and set a course for the pier in Avalon . After a victory lap inside the harbor , he registered his fish at Avalon Seafood . It weighed in at 189 1 / 2 pounds . &quot; I ' m a member of Avalon Tuna Club , the Southern California Tuna Club and Huntington Harbour Anglers , so I ' ve got a lot of hardware coming_to me , &quot; Macklin said of the trophies he will receive for his achievement . * Macklin might have landed the first marlin of the year , but on the same day he was struggling with his , another Orange County angler was involved in a deep-sea battle with a slightly larger but much stronger foe . Bill Von Henkle , 57 , of Newport Beach , hooked into a 204-pound broadbill swordfish while en route home from San Clemente Island . Von Henkle battled the fish for more_than two hours before bringing it alongside the boat . The crew managed to subdue the powerful fish , but not before it smashed some of the glass on the boat with a whack of its sturdy bill . &quot; It was like arm wrestling for two hours , &quot; Von Henkle said of the fight . Like Macklin , Von Henkle is an experienced angler . But often , experience is no match for a swordfish , considered by many the most powerful fish in the world . &quot; I ' ve hooked 44 and caught eight , &quot; Von Henkle said . &quot; One of them I fought for 22 hours and another I fought for 16 hours. &quot; He didn ' t win either fight . * Closing item in Monday ' s Wavefax , a Surfline / Wavetrak newsletter : &quot; A small_white shark was captured just off La Jolla last week and is now being watched_over at_Sea World . It makes you wonder if Mama is nearby . . . &quot; Mama may_not be , but one of Surfline ' s reporters was chased out of the water Monday morning while surfing off the Del Mar River mouth by a shark estimated at 6 feet-plus . &quot; He was still looking very pale this afternoon , &quot; Sean Collins at Surfline said in the fax . &quot; See ya out there. &quot; * Albert C . Taucher , a longtime member and three-time president of the California Fish and Game Commission , died last week after a lengthy illness . Taucher , appointed to the commission in 1983 by then-Gov . George Deukmejian , was an avid outdoorsman and very popular among his co-commissioners . &quot; His insight , concern for the rights of anglers and hunters , and good_humor were noteworthy at commission meetings for more_than a decade , &quot; said Robert Treanor , executive_director of the commission . &quot; He will be missed by commission members and staff. &quot; Private services for Taucher were held this week . Briefly SAN DIEGO LONG-RANGE -- The overnight fleet is still hurting for fish , while those aboard the three- and four-day boats are finding all they can handle . Small yellowfin_tuna are making_up most of the catches , but big bluefin are providing most of the bulk . An angler aboard the Spirit of Adventure landed a bluefin weighing 174.3 pounds . Brett Rubin of Malibu , fishing aboard the Vagabond , caught five bluefin weighing 100 pounds or more , the largest a 131-pounder . Most of the fish are still at least 200 miles southwest of the landings , well_out of range of the overnight fleet . CABO SAN LUCAS -- Blue_marlin are increasingly active , though few are of noteworthy size . Dockmaster Mario Bonaga spent a day on the Tracy Ann with relatives from Tijuana and they experienced a triple hookup with a blue_marlin , striped marlin and sailfish , all_of which were released . After that , they boated a 176-pound yellowfin_tuna . Yellowfin and dorado are extremely abundant , keeping action off Land ' s End at a maximum .
