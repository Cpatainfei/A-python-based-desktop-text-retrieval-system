   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; SOMEONE MAY BE WATCHING ; EVERYWHERE WE GO , WE ' RE INCREASINGLY UNDER SURVEILLANCE . EMPLOYERS , MARKETERS , EVEN PRIVATE_DETECTIVES USE HIGH-TECH TOOLS AND SCAN MOSTLY UNREGULATED DATABASES TO PRY INTO OUR DAILY LIVES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There was no revolution , no totalitarian takeover , no war bringing the collapse of worldwide democracy . But by an invention here and a new computer application there , American culture is nearing the point forewarned by those who feared technology could breed a new kind of oppression . Americans are potentially under surveillance -- watched , videotaped and digitally monitored -- for most of their waking hours . It isn ' t necessarily the government doing the watching . Often it is employers , doctors , insurers and merchants -- seeking security or gathering information in an invisible universe of mostly unregulated databases , the memory bank of the electronic culture . Direct marketers have &quot; master_files &quot; that include half the U.S. population categorized by intimate details . Anyone can subscribe_to databases such_as Sleuth , Asset Locator and People Finder . They sound like video_games , but they have a very serious purpose : Through them , you can learn of people ' s real_estate holdings , the value of their homes , their children ' s ages , even their neighbors ' phone_numbers . The technology offers people and institutions efficiency and security . But some worry that it could prove to be too_much of a good thing . The widening electronic culture is bringing new pressure to bear_on individualism and privacy . And as the nation accelerates onto the information superhighway , what is the effect of all_the rattling machinery on people ' s behavior , creativity and peace ? Imagine an absolutely ordinary day . You commute to work_on the freeway , stash the car in a parking garage and spend the morning at the office on the phone and computer . At lunch you get cash from an automated teller machine . After work you use a credit_card at a department_store , then stop at the supermarket . At home you call an 800 number and perhaps even order something from a catalogue . At each step , you may be under surveillance . A growing number of freeways have cameras to catch speeders , and soon many of the nation ' s tollbooths will electronically read which cars are driving by . Most parking garages also have video cameras for security . So do ATMs , supermarkets and department_stores . At work , employers can monitor every phone_call and computer keystroke you make -- the software to do this is available at any store -- and it is completely legal . ( Technology also allows employers to get detailed information from your insurers and your doctors. ) Store and credit_card receipts give companies detailed information on your buying habits . The discount club at the supermarket does more_than save you money . Through your computerized membership_card , your grocer can build a dossier on you , itemizing what you buy and how often . At home , digital technology records every phone_call you make , increasingly a source for investigators and lawyers fishing for data about the targets of their clients ' lawsuits . Shopping by phone gives merchants and manufacturers still more information . And the trend will only intensify . Soon , for example , cable carriers will know not only what programs you watch but also what you read on interactive television_sets . Once the TV cable becomes the conduit for most of our entertainment , shopping and financial transactions , it will also be an accessible storehouse of information about our lives . How much surveillance goes_on and how it is used is difficult to know precisely . But given the modest limitations imposed by law , scholars say the potential for abuse is enormous . And what some experts find most discomforting is that so_much highly personal data is being accumulated by private companies that have almost no restrictions on what they can do with it . &quot; The only rules which limit the use of the most personal information by direct marketers are the rules which the marketers voluntarily choose to follow , &quot; Mary J . Culnan , an associate_professor at the Georgetown University School of Business in Washington , testified earlier this year to a government task_force . University of Colorado sociologist Gary T . Marx worries about a less apparent problem : &quot; On a broad social scale , what does the presence of cameras and all these other things do to people ' s behavior ? &quot; One thing they are doing is helping to stop crime . A man was convicted of murder recently in Rochester , N.Y. , because the computer at the convenience_store where he claimed to be shopping during the crime obliterated his alibi . But technology also means that much of life is becoming less secure . A leading private_investigator tells the story of a prominent high-technology company that discovered that , during a company party , someone from outside had dialed into the firm ' s computers by modem , locked the company out of its own machines and downloaded the plans for the company ' s next generation of software . The e-mail manager at Epson computers in California was fired in 1990 because she wanted to let employees know the company was reading their private messages -- and she lost in court . &quot; You need to think_about . . . how many people you gave your credit_card number to by reading over your cellular_phone , &quot; said John B . Gage , director of the science office at Sun Microsystems Inc. in Mountain View . Cellular phones are so vulnerable that Gage estimated that perhaps 60 % of the cellular calls_in Silicon_Valley are being taped . Information technology is turning the business of private investigation topsy turvy . The job that was once the preserve of gumshoes like Philip Marlowe , whose assets were their charm , fists and gun , now falls_in the province of mouses and modems . Using Information America , a commonly available commercial database , anyone can plug into People Finder and find the phone_number , address , dwelling type , estimated age and average income of 70 million Americans and 10 million businesses , not to mention the average price of a house in every neighborhood . Its Skip Tracer can find people who are_on the move by combing change-of-address records from the post_office . A database called Assets has property records for people nearly everywhere in the country . The Lawsuit databank offers court records . Other databases hold records on bankruptcies , liens , births and deaths , high_school and college listings , wedding announcements and more . Any information is available within hours . In 1990 , the congressional General Accounting Office reported there were 910 federal databanks containing health , financial , Social_Security and other personal information around the country ; many of them were shared with corporations and commercial databanks . Kroll Associates , the nation ' s largest private investigation firm , has access to 700 on-line_databases . That makes Kroll the largest subscriber outside the U.S._government , according to managing partner Alan Brill . The agency used its computer skills to track_down Ferdinand E . Marcos ' worldwide financial holdings , plus those of Jean-Claude ( Baby Doc ) Duvalier of Haiti and Saddam Hussein ' s Iraq during the Persian_Gulf_War . A dizzying array of information is available to the direct marketing industry . The Direct Marketing List Source , a massive catalogue that marketers use to buy mailing_lists , offers 12 # 000 categories of lists for_sale -- everything from &quot; born-again doctors who donate &quot; to &quot; Bill Moyers ' Journal transcript buyers &quot; to the 750 # 000 people who called TV ' s &quot; The Jessica Hahn Show. &quot; Perhaps more important , direct marketing firms can compile these various sources into super lists , or &quot; master files. &quot; The P cle Financial Markets list -- sold by the &quot; target marketing &quot; subsidiary of TRW , the giant credit_bureau -- contains 87 million households segmented by the head_of_household ' s age , weight , height , ethnicity , net worth and financial behavior , among other things . The Behavior Bank divides 28 million U.S. households by 100 lifestyle categories such_as the types of investments people have , their hobbies and the kinds of vacations they take . &quot; Most consumers think_of catalogues , &quot; said Lorna Christi , a spokeswoman for the Direct Marketing Assn . &quot; But there are very few major corporations today that don ' t do direct marketing. &quot; Direct marketing accounts_for $ 350 billion in sales annually , and 54 % of adult Americans , or 111 million consumers , shop this way , Christi said . The association , which has 3 # 600 member firms , has an ethical_code and a &quot; guide to effective self-regulatory action. &quot; But the guidelines are necessarily vague : &quot; Direct marketers should be sensitive to the issue of consumer privacy and should limit the combination , collection , rental , sale , exchange and use of consumer data to only those data which are appropriate for direct-marketing purposes , &quot; the group ' s 13-page pamphlet on &quot; Ethical Business Practices &quot; reads . The association can recommend referring members found to be in violation of the code to its ethics group , or it can suspend their membership . In the last year , Christi said , the group has referred two members and suspended one . Some privacy advocates wonder whether self-regulation is enough . Jeff Smith , an assistant_professor at Georgetown University ' s Graduate_School of Business , has written what some experts call the most thorough analysis of corporate America ' s approach to privacy . &quot; Managing Privacy : Information Technology and Corporate America &quot; is a soon-to-be-published study of how banks , insurance_companies and credit_card firms process medical , financial and consumer data . &quot; Almost without exception , when it comes_to privacy , companies are reactive , &quot; Smith said . &quot; They drift along and make policy only when some crisis occurs . It could be a consumer backlash or a legal challenge , but at that point they react with task_forces and committees and they create policies. &quot; What most concerns the handful of privacy experts around the country is that legislative policy-making is just as haphazard and reactive . Companies can sell data about what products people buy , where they vacation and where they invest . But disclosing what videos people rent was made illegal after the rentals of Supreme Court nominee Robert H . Bork were made public during his unsuccessful 1987 confirmation_hearings . In roughly 20 states , drivers ' license records are public information . This is how direct marketers can know how tall people are , how much they weigh , whether they wear glasses and , in many states , what their Social_Security_numbers are . Political activists use these lists as well . In his book &quot; Closed : 99 Ways to Stop Abortion , &quot; anti-abortion advocate Joseph Scheidler urged fellow activists to write_down the license-plate numbers of cars_parked at abortion clinics , get the names_and_addresses of the owners from the state motor_vehicles department and then picket their homes and deluge them with mail . California stopped selling its motor_vehicle records after a stalker used them to find and murder actress Rebecca Schaeffer in 1989 . There are many legitimate uses for this information . If driving records were private , for instance , school_bus firms might not be able to check the driving records of job applicants . But policy toward what should be available and what should not is all but nonexistent , privacy advocates say . In Europe , by contrast , there are laws that precisely detail how the technology can be used . &quot; To some extent , we are first in technology and last in privacy , &quot; said Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center . A U.S. data protection board with advisory powers was proposed in Congress in 1991 , but has not materialized . And other legislation to deal with monitoring at the workplace has been stalled in Congress for years . A bill sponsored by Sen . Paul Simon ( D-Ill. ) , for example , would require employers to disclose in_advance that workers might be monitored , that the monitoring would be for business purposes only and that certain places , such_as restrooms , would be off-limits . Increasingly , the home is another area of concern . When the age of interactive television arrives in perhaps five years , what policy should there be governing how data on viewing or shopping habits can be used ? It ' s a question to which scholars , public policy-makers and businesses have given little thought . As Marx at the University of Colorado laments : &quot; There hasn ' t been a lot of careful research into the social implications of all this. &quot; Always Under Watch : A Day in the Life... Whether by video camera or computer , surveillance techniques may threaten your privacy . Here are some of the ways : 1 ) THE COMMUTE : Cameras on freeways catch a driver speeding to work . 2 ) AT_WORK : Parking garage video camera can note a worker ' s arrival_time , companions in auto . 3 ) WORKSTATION : Employers can monitor computer messages and other electronic work . 4 ) AT LUNCH : A diner ' s credit_card scan shows restaurant and bill . 5 ) AFTER-WORK ERRAND : ATM camera and computer records transaction . Credit_card used at store shows where consumer shopped , what you bought . 6 ) DRIVE_HOME : Toll booth scanner records when auto passed . 7 ) IN THE HOUSE : Shopping by phone gives companies information on tastes and lifestyle .</TEXT>
