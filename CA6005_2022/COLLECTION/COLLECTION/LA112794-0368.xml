   <TEXT> Home for the holidays is the romantic ideal . Chestnuts roasting on an open_fire . Presents under the tree . Visits from loved ones . Children nestled all snug in their beds . A sink full of greasy pots and pans . Bored relatives sniping at each other for entertainment . Harried last-minute shopping . Sugarplums stuck_to the drapes . Maybe away for the holidays isn ' t such a bad idea after all . All over the country , professional tourism elves have been festooning their hometowns with baubles , bows and twinkling lights , all to help visitors reach holiday nirvana . They ' ve provided pageantry and jollity and all_the shopping you could want to do ( as if you have a choice ) . Of course , these Christmas extravaganzas also help keep the elves in jobs , giving many places new life in the wintertime . Branson , Mo. , has more_than doubled its winter crowd since introducing Ozark Mountain Winter in 1988 , and winter employment has soared . The Opryland USA theme park in Nashville , Tenn. , inaugurated a winter season last year , following in the very successful footsteps of the Opryland Hotel , which introduced its Country Christmas in 1984 . In Arizona , Tempe will have its first Fantasy of Lights this year , patterned after a successful one in Niagara Falls , although the goal is more about community spirit than attracting additional winter visitors , says Aimee Fantazier of the convention and visitors bureau . But for you , it ' s all just a chance to indulge in a little Christmas you don ' t have to clean_up after . Take a jaunt now , just for the fun of it , or , if you happen to be going_to one of these places anyway , plan a little mid-holiday escape_from that houseful of bickering relatives .
