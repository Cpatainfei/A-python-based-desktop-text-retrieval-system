   <HEADLINE> MCNALL AGREES TO PLEAD TO FRAUD CHARGES ; KINGS : PROSECUTORS SAY HE DEFRAUDED BANKS FOR MORE THAN $ 236 MILLION . GRETZKY ALSO ALLEGEDLY WAS DECEIVED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> King President Bruce McNall was formally charged Monday with defrauding six banks of more_than $ 236 million over 10 years in a long-awaited plea agreement with federal prosecutors , the culmination of a dizzying collapse that is virtually unprecedented in the sports business . The four-count criminal information consists_of two counts of bank fraud , one count of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud . In December , McNall plans to formally plead guilty to all counts , according to his attorney . The charges , which stem from a nine-month investigation , also allege for the first time that McNall and his executives in one deal took_advantage of King superstar Wayne Gretzky , his longtime friend and investment partner . According to the charges , McNall improperly pledged their horse , Honor Grades , to Union Bank as collateral for an $ 850 # 000 loan without telling Gretzky , representing to the bank that the horse was 100 % owned by McNall ' s Summa Stables . Gretzky , who bought 25 % of the horse in 1991 , isn ' t mentioned by name in the papers and is referred to only as &quot; an investor. &quot; Sources confirmed , however , that it is Gretzky . McNall lawyer Tom Pollack contended that any such action &quot; was done_by lower-level employees &quot; without McNall ' s knowledge . Neither Gretzky nor his agent returned phone_calls . In April , The Times reported that McNall was the subject of a federal bank fraud investigation , and in August reported that he had struck a plea agreement with prosecutors . On Monday , Pollack publicly acknowledged that his client will plead guilty to the felony charges , most likely next month . &quot; Bruce is saying he did wrong , and he is taking responsibility , &quot; Pollack said . Pollack further said that the false loan_applications were part of a larger effort to keep McNall ' s business afloat while trying to put_together new ventures -- such_as a new sports arena -- that would generate money to pay_off McNall ' s debts . Asst . U.S. Atty . Peter S . Spivack called McNall &quot; the primary motivator and beneficiary of this scheme &quot; to defraud the banks . &quot; It wasn ' t called McNall Sports and Entertainment for nothing . The company was the man and vice-versa , &quot; said Spivack , who said that &quot; a 10-year period without discovery is pretty extraordinary. &quot; Technically , McNall faces a maximum of 45 years in prison . Realistically , under federal sentencing rules , McNall is said to currently face nine years in prison , with the possibility that the amount could be chipped_away for extensive cooperation with prosecutors and depending_on how a judge views the seriousness of the case . Sources close to McNall say he is hoping to whittle the term down to five years or less . Over the past three months , prosecutors and McNall lawyers have hammered_out the terms and wording of the charges made public Monday , which portray a systematic effort dating_back to 1984 by McNall and his associates to defraud bankers , many of whom were enamored with McNall ' s glitzy image and who eagerly lined_up to lend him money . The charges largely involve providing phony documents that overstated McNall ' s assets and understated or failed to list his debts . In one case , replicas of famous sports jerseys were bought and continually washed to appear authentic so bankers would believe that their loans were backed by valuable sports memorabilia . Prosecutors allege that McNall ' s loan schemes started with a $ 35-million request from European American Bank and the Dutch unit of the giant French bank Credit Lyonnais . The loan was made on behalf of Gladden Entertainment , a movie production firm McNall owned with longtime Hollywood figure David Begelman . McNall , the charges say , submitted phony financial_statements that overstated his net worth in personally guaranteeing the loan . The loan amount was later boosted to $ 50 million in 1985 , and to $ 60 million in 1988 . The fact that the charges show McNall falsified loan documents as early as 1984 , sources say , poses a problem for McNall ' s camp , which has been suggesting that the loan schemes were triggered in part out of desperation following a near financial collapse in 1987 caused by problems at Gladden . Sources familiar_with the case said that a 10-year pattern of conduct -- especially the overt way some documents were faked -- does not bode well for that argument , making_it difficult to argue that financial duress provoked the actions . Federal authorities are said to have been shocked at how blatant the fraud has been in some cases . The banks McNall is charged with defrauding are Bank of America , European American Bank , Credit Lyonnais , Bank of California , First Los Angeles Bank and Union Bank . In addition , he is charged with diverting about $ 13 million from a coin partnership he organized with Merrill Lynch and $ 7 million from King ticket sales when his bank funds dried_up . The charges accuse McNall and his executives of creating sham companies to obtain loans , such_as a $ 14-million loan from Credit Lyonnais secured by $ 15 million in coins that never existed . It also accused McNall and his executives of bribing bank officials to win their favor , including making a $ 50 # 000 loan to a Bank of America officer . One of the more elaborate schemes involved McNall and his associates arranging a $ 20-million personal_loan from Bank of America , using as collateral phony financial_statements listing $ 15 million in rare coins , which again did not exist . To keep the bank and other institutions from discovering that the coins did not exist , the charges say , McNall and his executives maintained that the coins had been traded for sports memorabilia . As it turns_out , McNall didn ' t own the memorabilia , but instead held it on consignment from memorabilia dealers . After he returned the memorabilia to the dealers , the charges say , McNall and his executives duped the banks by purchasing sports items and making them look old . McNall ' s sudden change of fortune would be staggering for any business_executive , much less one who only a year ago was considered one of the most progressive owners in sports . By luring such stars as Gretzky to his Kings , McNall did what skeptics once thought impossible : sell_out hockey_games in Southern California . But the road that led McNall from president of the Arcadia High_School coin club to the national spotlight took a detour when it became clear that much of his business empire was built_on sand . McNall filed for personal bankruptcy in May , shortly after selling 72 % of the team to Jeffrey Sudikoff and Joseph Cohen to rid himself of his Bank of America loans . McNall was expected as early as today to give_up his high-profile title of president of the Kings , although he will continue to work for the team and draw a six-figure salary through 2001 . Cohen said : &quot; McNall hasn ' t ( resigned ) but I know he intends to . I consider Bruce a friend . I want to be supportive . My first priority is to the L.A. Kings and our fans. &quot; Pollack said that McNall first became aware of the bank fraud investigation on April 20 , when subpoenas were served and then he began cooperating with prosecutors . While saying he does not want to downplay McNall ' s role in the schemes , Pollack said that the crimes were &quot; institutional &quot; in nature , involving a large_number of employees in McNall ' s organization . But prosecutor Spivack said : &quot; The fact that Mr. McNall entered into a plea agreement means he ' s recognized these other people did not conspire to make him rich . It was something he was part of. &quot; Pollack said the false loan_applications stemmed in part from the financial crisis in 1987 at Gladden , exacerbated by pressure from Credit Lyonnais to accept an unfavorable foreign distribution deal for its movies . Pollack further maintained that McNall was even advised to sue the bank for lender liability for its actions , but did not . A Credit Lyonnais spokesman , Fred Spar , called Pollack ' s assertions &quot; preposterous &quot; and a &quot; victimization &quot; ploy , noting that McNall continued to do business with the bank for years after he purportedly wanted to sue . He also noted that the charges date_back to 1984 , three years before the Gladden problems . SOME OF THE FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT ' S CHARGES AGAINST BRUCE McNALL : * Bank of America : Created false financial_statements that showed McNall owned a $ 15 million coin inventory that didn ' t exist . Stated the inventory was traded for a sports memorabilia collection he didn ' t own , and created counterfeit memorabilia he represented as collateral . * Union Bank : Listed $ 41 million in horses for his Summa Stables that he no longer owned , never fully owned or were dead . * Bank of California : Applied for a $ 5 million loan for Superior Stamp and Coin to acquire coins and created phony invoices .

Forged a promotional and marketing agreement to convince the bank that proceeds from coin sales were invested in a sunken treasure salvage operation . * Merrill Lynch and the Kings : Diverted more_than $ 13 million from a coin fund organized with the securities firm and $ 7 million from King ticket proceeds when bank funds dried_up .</TEXT>
