   <HEADLINE> SYMBOL OF MISUNDERSTANDING ; RELIGION : THE HWA YEN BUDDHIST COMMUNITY HAS BEEN VANDALIZED , LARGELY FOR ITS REVERSE-SWASTIKA EMBLEM , AND SOME OF ITS CUSTOMS HAVE LED TO FRICTION WITH NEIGHBORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Vietnamese Buddhist temple that was hit by vandalism early this year because of confusion over swastika-like symbols on its entrance gate -- emblems that signify goodness in that faith -- also had its mailbox blown apart by a bomb , it was learned this week . Although the Buddhist group covered with plywood six reverse-swastika emblems in its gate -- apparently mistaken for Nazi symbols -- the group says its problems have continued . Epitomizing the cultural clashes that occur as the San Fernando Valley grows more diverse , some neighbors complained last week that the temple ' s saffron-colored gates are garish and a bell used in prayers is too loud . The troubles began over the swastikas that decorated the gate to the Hwa Yen Buddhist Studies Assn . on De Soto Avenue . The swastika is an ancient symbol of auspiciousness and good_fortune in Hindu culture , in_use for centuries before it became associated with Hitler ' s Germany . It has similar meanings for Far Eastern Buddhist groups , who use a version with arms drawn_in the reverse direction of the one made infamous by the Nazis . Vandals sawed off two of the six symbols in the wrought-iron gate sometime last spring and complaints that they resembled Nazi swastikas were made to the B ' nai B ' rith Anti-Defamation League . Later , apparently in May , an explosive_device blew_up the temple ' s roadside mailbox , the monks and neighbors say . The monks said Thursday they could no longer remember the date . Although they said they had reported it to law-enforcement authorities , they could not identify the agency . Detectives at the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s Devonshire station nearby had no record of a complaint this year . But a neighbor of the temple , who declined to be identified , said she remembers that the explosion occurred sometime before June 4 . &quot; I thought it was someone ' s water_heater that had blown_up , &quot; she said . &quot; Then the next morning , I saw pieces of the mailbox all_over the street. &quot; The temple ' s 87-year-old head monk , who left two temples in Vietnam as he evacuated Saigon with American troops in 1975 , said through an interpreter that he has forgiven the unknown bomber . &quot; I ' ve forgotten already about the explosion , &quot; said the Venerable Sik Tai Fong in a brief interview before leaving on an extended visit to the Buddhist sect ' s New York headquarters . &quot; We are not scared or mad . People don ' t understand Buddhists , &quot; said a female monk who is second in leadership , the Venerable Wai Fong Tran . The two monks ' remarks were translated by a volunteer , realtor Mona Trouing . Wai Fong Tran also said that one night last week , two women and a man in the neighborhood came_by to complain that the large entrance gate and buildings painted bright yellow detract from the area ' s housing values and that a bell the monks ring occasionally is too loud . Another neighbor -- the one who heard the mailbox explode -- said she has no objections to the Buddhists ' presence . &quot; The bell was quite loud before , but I think they ' re toning it down now , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' ve heard it as early as 6 a.m. and in the evening about 6:30 p.m. , &quot; she said . The monks said that the group moved_into the property in October of last year and has applied for city permits to hold religious events . A garage containing four Buddha figures is being renovated to serve as a small temple , they said . Meanwhile , a handful of followers use rooms in the two-story house for meditation and study . The language problem and their leaders ' frequent absence has left the group lacking potential supporters , although in the spring , a Valley rabbi circulated a letter to synagogues explaining the Buddhist meaning of the swastika in an effort to defuse tension over the symbol . The Chatsworth-based San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council , which includes members of Eastern and Western religious groups , has not been contacted by the Vietnamese Buddhist group , said Executive_Director Barry Smedberg . Nor has a call_for help gone_to the ethnically diverse Buddhist Sangha Council of Southern California , based in Los Angeles . The Venerable Havanpola Ratanasara , executive_director of the council , said he hadn ' t heard of the Chatsworth group or its leaders . The initial troubles at the Hwa Yen property stemmed from a sad irony , Ratanasara said . &quot; The swastika symbol means a blessing , expecting something good to happen -- not the way the Nazis used it. &quot; Neither swastika form is used by Buddhists in his native Sri Lanka or other Theravadan Buddhist countries of south Asia , Ratanasara said . &quot; It is used in Mahayana Buddhism in China , Korea , Japan and Vietnam , &quot; he said . However , because a reverse swastika is often mistaken for the Nazi version , Japanese-heritage Jodo Shinshu temples in this country &quot; have purposely avoided the use of this emblem , &quot; said the Rev . Kakuyei Tada of the San Fernando Valley Hongwanji Buddhist Temple in Pacoima . &quot; This doesn ' t mean that we simply ignore and refuse to get involved in this controversy , &quot; Tada said . &quot; Buddhists are neither anti-Semites nor Nazis . We , as Buddhists , cannot tolerate the Holocaust carried_out by the Nazis. &quot;</TEXT>
