   <HEADLINE> IBM STOPS SHIPPING PENTIUM PCS ; TECHNOLOGY : COMPUTER MAKER SAYS CHIP ' S FLAW IS WORSE THAN INTEL HAS REPORTED . INTEL CALLS THE ACTION UNWARRANTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Intel Corp. ' s efforts to dispose_of the controversy over a flaw in its Pentium microprocessor were dealt a severe setback Monday when IBM Corp . said it was suspending shipments of Pentium-based personal_computers because it believes the bug is substantially worse than Intel has reported . IBM ' s announcement sent shudders through the PC industry , dragging technology stocks down in heavy trading on Wall_Street and raising fears that consumers could grow wary of PCs in the midst of the industry ' s best-ever holiday selling season . It also highlighted some of the difficulties computer companies face as they try to appeal_to non-technical consumers , whose expectations are different from those of traditional computer buyers . Intel denounced IBM ' s decision as unwarranted , saying its own extensive tests showed no evidence of any increased probability of encountering the bug . Since the flaw was publicized by a Virginia mathematics professor in October , Intel has steadfastly maintained that the flaw is of no concern to anyone except a_few mathematicians and scientists . &quot; You can always contrive situations that force this error , &quot; Andrew S . Grove , Intel ' s president and chief_executive , said in a statement Monday . &quot; In other words , if you know where a meteor will land , you can go there and get hit. &quot; IBM ' s action is its second Pentium-related salvo in less than two weeks : On Nov . 30 , the company offered to replace faulty Pentiums for customers who feared that their computations might go awry because of the bug , which can produce errors in some complex division problems . IBM ' s double- barreled barrage is viewed by many in the industry as an opportunistic attempt to disparage Intel and garner support for its own PowerPC , a Pentium rival that IBM developed with Apple Computer and Motorola . Pentium PCs account_for only a tiny portion of IBM ' s sales . No other PC manufacturers followed IBM ' s lead Monday . But IBM denied any ulterior motives . &quot; Our main concern was to respect the trust &quot; of our customers , said Bill Pulleyblank , director of mathematical sciences at IBM ' s research division in Yorktown Heights , N.Y. &quot; We ' re willing to take whatever are the consequences. &quot; IBM will sell Pentium systems on a case-by-case basis to customers who are aware of the flaw and feel comfortable that they will not be affected , spokeswoman Tara Sexton said . &quot; If they want to accept the risk now , fine , &quot; she said , noting that IBM would later replace the Pentium chips free_of charge . Computer makers such_as Dell and Compaq , meanwhile , said they will continue to ship Pentium systems while they await replacement microprocessors from Intel containing a &quot; patch &quot; that fixes the bug . Widespread distribution of repaired Pentiums will begin in the first three months of 1995 , Intel has said . After IBM ' s Monday morning announcement , the stocks of semiconductor and computer makers and computer retailers took a drubbing , though many edged back_up in the afternoon . Intel closed_down $ 2.375 at $ 60.375 , IBM dropped 87.5 cents to $ 70.625 , Dell slumped $ 1.25 to $ 39.625 , and Compaq was off 87.5 cents at $ 39 . Retailer CompUSA fell 50 cents to $ 13.375. Intel has said a typical computer user using a spreadsheet and doing 1 # 000 divisions per day would notice a problem from the Pentium bug just once in 27 # 000 years . In its tests , however , IBM found that common spreadsheet programs , recalculating for 15 minutes a day , could produce errors as often as every 24 days . Consumers have been buying PCs in record numbers for homes and small offices this holiday season , and many are particularly attracted to Pentium-based machines : The powerful chip makes them especially good for games and other multimedia programs . The popularity of on-line services and the global Internet has also boosted mainstream interest in computing . In fact , fanning the Pentium controversy has been a spate of fiery electronic_mail complaints on the Internet about Intel ' s handling of the problem . Two weekends ago , Intel ' s Grove took the unprecedented step of posting a statement on the Internet to defend his company ' s strategy . According to industry observers , this is the first time a high-tech flaw has received such a public airing on the Internet . The Internet ' s role in spreading the news fast has been &quot; quite astounding , &quot; said Jeff Contompasis , senior quality assurance engineer at Simulation Sciences , a software company based in Brea . Many Internet users were particularly incensed that Intel , based in Santa Clara , Calif. , knew of the problem as early as last June but did not disclose it publicly until after its discovery by mathematician Thomas R . Nicely , a college professor in Virginia . Intel has steadfastly declined to recall the 5 million or so Pentiums already on the market . It has said that any customer affected by the glitch will be sent a replacement at any time during the PC ' s life . In the meantime , it is racing to produce bug-free chips_in quantity . To some , the Pentium controversy raises anew the debate about whether the high-tech industry , especially given its push into the home market , should develop a better set of quality-control standards for its equipment to reassure potentially wary customers . ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Portrait of the Pentium Intel ' s Pentium processor , introduced in March , 1993 , represents the fifth generation in a line of microprocessors that dates_back to 1979 and the original IBM PC . While the fourth-generation chip , the 486 , is currently the chip of choice for personal_computers , the more powerful ( and more expensive ) Pentium is expected to overtake the 486 by the end of next year .
