   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; U.S. , FRANCE AGREE TO SEEK RESOLUTION OF FILM DISPUTE ; TRADE : KANTOR STRIKES AN UNEXPECTED THREE-PART AGREEMENT IN PARIS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States and France have agreed to take a new stab at resolving their bitter dispute over movies , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Tuesday . The two countries -- legendary sparring_partners in the trade arena -- also agreed to sit_down and address their common concerns over access to Japan , considered the main transgressor when it comes_to trade . &quot; We have agreed to begin to hold informal talks , &quot; Kantor said at the annual meeting of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . In a third development , groups from Paris and Washington plan to delve into the contentious new link between trade_policy and worker rights -- a high priority for both governments . Kantor said he struck the three-part agreement over dinner Monday night with his French counterpart , Gerard Longuet . Taking a new tack , the informal talks will group not just government officials but labor and industry representatives as well . The audiovisual sector has long divided the United States from the European Union , which fears that Hollywood will sound the death_knell for Continental filmmakers . Despite the fact that most Europeans are more keen on Rambo than Zola , Longuet has argued long and loud against Hollywood blockbusters , all_in the name of a higher European art . The United States had pushed hard to bring the multibillion-dollar industry under the auspices of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade when talks wrapped_up last December . But France balked and America backed_off , while vowing that the issue was far from dead . There is big money at stake . According to industry data , the U.S. film , TV and home video industry earns about $ 8 billion of its $ 18 billion in annual revenues overseas . Of that , some 55 % comes from Western Europe . At issue is a 1989 European broadcast directive that ensures at least half of all European Union television programming is home-grown . France has taken it one step further , mandating a 60 % domestic content . What has also galled the Clinton_Administration -- which relied_on strong backing from Hollywood to help it capture the White_House -- are rules that deny U.S. artists and producers full royalties when their work is shown at European theaters . The royalties are instead plowed back into EU industry . The new U.S.-Gallic alliance -- given their past wrangling over everything from oil seeds to fish to wine -- had not been foreseen . Kantor met last week with EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan , who said the movie dispute did not even come_up . Alongside the new attempt to make greater inroads in the film business , Longuet and Kantor also agreed that the two sides should team_up on two other highly contentious trade issues . The United States has been pushing an aggressive market-opening strategy in its talks with Japan . Some trading partners have expressed fears that Americans are negotiating for U.S. firms alone , despite U.S. claims to the contrary . All previous attempts by Brittan to step into the fray and &quot; trilateralize &quot; the negotiations have come_to naught . Now Longuet is stepping_in his wake . Longuet and Kantor also agreed to delve into the trade-labor debate , which many countries fear is a mask for higher wages overseas and amounts to First World protectionism .</TEXT>
