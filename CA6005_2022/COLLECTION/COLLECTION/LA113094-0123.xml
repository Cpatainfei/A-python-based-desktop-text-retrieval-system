   <HEADLINE> TRIAL IN WHITE_HOUSE SHOOTING DELAYED ; DEFENSE : JUDGE GIVES DURAN ' S ATTORNEY MORE TIME TO DECIDE ON POSSIBLE INSANITY_PLEA . COLORADAN IS CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal judge Tuesday set a March 16 trial date for Francisco Martin Duran -- who is accused of spraying the White_House with bullets Oct . 29 -- after Duran ' s attorney said she would need several more weeks to consider a possible insanity defense . U.S. District Judge Charles R . Richey gave Leigh Kenny until Jan . 6 to tell the court whether Duran , 26 , would plead insanity . He is accused of firing more_than 25 shots from a semiautomatic weapon while standing among tourists on the sidewalk in front of the White_House . Richey instructed Kenny to file other defense motions by that date , including any arguments to suppress items of evidence . Richey also postponed acting_on a request by news organizations to make public a two-page letter written by Duran that was found by federal officers after his arrest . The judge said that he first must consider any motions that Kenny might file . Kenny , an assistant U.S. public_defender , said that she needs to interview more people who have known Duran as well as read more_than 2 # 000 pages of material relating to the case and analyze videotapes of the shooting . &quot; I have quite a bit of investigation to do , &quot; she told the court . Following a jury verdict in 1982 that cleared John W . Hinckley Jr . of criminal conduct in wounding President Ronald Reagan , Congress tightened the federal statutes governing insanity defenses . At the time of Hinckley ' s trial , prosecutors had the burden_of_proof to show that Hinckley was sane , that he could determine right from wrong and that he could control his behavior . But under the new statutes , insanity defenses are more difficult to prove . Now the defense bears the burden of showing insanity &quot; by clear and convincing evidence. &quot; The defense also must show that the accused has a serious mental_disorder -- not just a personality defect -- that prevented him from knowing right from wrong . There no longer is any behavioral standard . Federal prosecutors have charged Duran with the attempted assassination of President Clinton , an offense carrying a maximum punishment of life imprisonment , even though officials repeatedly have said that the shots fired randomly at the White_House never endangered Clinton . Duran also faces charges of assaulting law_enforcement officers , weapon violations and destruction of federal property . He has pleaded not_guilty to all_the charges . Prosecutors apparently are basing the most serious charge on threats that acquaintances in Colorado said they heard Duran make against Clinton . Duran , an upholsterer for a hotel in Colorado Springs , abruptly left his job and family a month before his arrest . Richey said that the trial is &quot; not complicated &quot; and should take no more_than two weeks . Assistant U.S. Atty . Eric A . Dubelier said that the government ' s case will be based on testimony from about 25 witnesses . Duran , who appeared in court Tuesday wearing a blue prison jumpsuit , was not asked to speak during the 30-minute proceeding . In Brazil , meanwhile , a Brazilian whose videotape of the gunman firing at the White_House last month was shown on U.S. television has died of a blood_clot at age 70 , his doctor said Tuesday . Caetano Cariani died Nov . 16 , less than 24 hours after being hospitalized with sharp pains in his right leg , said Dr. Fabio Linardi in Sorocaba , about 70 miles west of Sao Paulo . Linardi said the clot was caused by a bacterial infection . Cariani was vacationing in Washington when he filmed the shooting .</TEXT>
