   <HEADLINE> PARENT OF CARL ' S JR . PLANS TO OPEN 300 BOSTON CHICKEN OUTLETS IN STATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hoping to cash_in_on growing consumer demand for healthier restaurant food , Carl Karcher Enterprises said Monday it plans to open as_many as 300 Boston Chicken Inc. restaurants in Southern California and Sacramento . The move , under which Anaheim-based Karcher Enterprises is buying Boston Chicken franchise rights for an undisclosed amount , is designed to augment flagging profits at the parent company of the Carl ' s Jr . hamburger chain by giving it a strong presence in what is arguably the nation ' s fastest-growing restaurant segment . And for Boston Chicken , a Naperville , Ill.-based rotisserie chicken chain that set records when it first offered stock to the public last November , the deal is a major piece in its ambitious plan to expand nationwide . Boston Chicken said it was attracted to the real_estate held by Karcher Enterprises . &quot; Carl ' s has some of the highest-quality real_estate in the Southern California market , and we needed a substantial player in the market to get our concept going strong. &quot; said Mark Stephens , Boston Chicken ' s chief financial_officer . Karcher Enterprises President Donald E . Doyle said the company will convert some Carl ' s Jr . stores to Boston Chicken locations . At the same time , the company will continue experimenting with new menu items at its Carl ' s Jr . restaurants in an attempt to regain market share from larger , better-capitalized competitors in the burger business . In planning to open separate chicken restaurants , Karcher Enterprises is joining several competitors -- including longtime king Kentucky Fried Chicken -- that are rushing to meet the demand for products that are perceived as healthy and relatively inexpensive . &quot; This is the food concept of the 1990s , &quot; said Janet Lowder , a restaurant consultant in Rancho Palos Verde . &quot; You ' ve already got an awful lot of competition in that non-fried chicken segment , and this deal suggests it ' s going_to heat_up even more. &quot; KFC Inc. , the Louisville , Ky.-based parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken , turned_up the heat last summer by spending more_than $ 100 million to roll_out its new Colonel ' s Rotisserie Gold chicken line . The company ' s rotisserie sales totaled $ 175 million for the second_half , leading KFC to project that they will equal those of fried chicken by the end of the decade . KFC controls about half of the nation ' s $ 7-billion market for fried chicken . But investors nonetheless embraced Boston Chicken when the company made its first public stock offering in November . Its shares more_than doubled in first-day trading to close at $ 48.50 , up from $ 20 . Restaurant industry_analysts were stunned because the chain had fewer than 200 locations nationwide and had recently reported a $ 5.9-million loss on annual revenue of $ 8.3 million . Monday ' s announcement pushed Boston Chicken ' s stock up $ 3.75 to close at $ 41 in Monday ' s Nasdaq trading , while Karcher Enterprises , also traded on the Nasdaq market , surged $ 2 to $ 13.625. Karcher Enterprises President Doyle described the Boston Chicken franchise purchase as a long-term investment that won ' t make a significant contribution to his company ' s bottom_line until 1995 at the earliest . &quot; We expect a modestly positive effect in the second year , with ( profits ) improving after that , &quot; Doyle said . Karcher Enterprises will create a separate division to run the chicken business , Doyle said . Currently , Karcher Enterprises has 649 Carl ' s Jr . fast-food restaurants in California , Nevada , Oregon , Arizona and Mexico . Boston Chicken is moving_into Southern California and Sacramento as part of a national strategy that calls_for more_than 400 locations to be open by year ' s end . The company recently agreed to pay $ 22.3 million for 87 Philadelphia-area Roy Rogers restaurants that will be converted to Boston Chicken eateries . Boston Chicken isn ' t the only chain eyeing California . Kenny Rogers Roasters , a Ft . Lauderdale , Fla. , chain with 100 units nationwide , plans to add &quot; several hundred locations in the next four or five years in the state , &quot; spokesman David Morrow said . Boston Chicken also faces stiff competition from El Pollo Loco , an Irvine-based chain with 210 locations in California , Nevada and Texas . &quot; No doubt about it , we ' re a direct competitor , &quot; said Ray Perry , El Pollo Loco ' s president . &quot; We ' ve been expecting their arrival , and we have some things planned to blunt their arrival . We ' ve got 200 restaurants out here , and they ' ve got none , so we think we have a good chance of performing well. &quot; Doyle said he doesn ' t expect Boston Chicken to be a direct competitor of the 649-unit Carl ' s Jr . chain because &quot; Boston Chicken is clearly positioned as takeout meal replacement . It ' s not part of the day-to-day fast-food environment . It almost has the feel of a take-out deli. &quot; Stephens agreed : &quot; The vast majority of our customers say they used to cook at_home . The next-largest group is consumers who used to order pizza . You have to go way down the survey to find fast food. &quot; Consumers are warming_up to chicken because of perceived and real health benefits , said Kenneth Berg , chairman of Koo Koo Roo Inc. , an eight-unit Los Angeles chain that serves broiled , skinless chicken . &quot; Rotisserie chicken is healthier than fried foods , obviously , and it ' s a little healthier than beef or pork , &quot; Berg said . &quot; But it ' s not really considered a healthy food unless you take the skin off before cooking it , which is what we do. &quot; Hamburgers Still Rule Nationally , fast-food chicken restaurants run a distant third to hamburgers and pizza . 1992 MARKET SHARE Hamburger : 42 % Pizza : 20 % Chicken : 7 % Mexican : 5 % Asian : 2 % Other : 24 % Note : Market share based on number of customers .
