   <HEADLINE> R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY ; SMITHSONIAN PAYS TRIBUTE TO AN ART INSTITUTION ; CERAMIST BEATRICE WOOD , 101 AND RECOVERING FROM A RECENT ILLNESS , ATTENDS VIA SATELLITE THE DINNER HONORING HER WORKS AND HER VIEW OF LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Beatrice Wood , the 101-year-old ceramist and &quot; mama &quot; of Dada -- the radical art_movement of the early 1900s -- offered wise and witty commentary on politics , art and sexuality Saturday when she was honored by the Smithsonian Institution ' s Archives of American Art . Because she was recovering from a recent illness , Wood could not accept the archives ' Esteemed American Artist Award in_person at the Surf and Sand in Laguna Beach . Instead , she communicated with the 130 guests via satellite from her home_in Ojai . The $ 500-per-person dinner was expected to net $ 40 # 000 for the archives , which collects the records of American artists for research . Of Men and Chocolate To actress Tippi Hedren , the evening ' s honorary chairwoman , Wood is much more_than a great artist : &quot; She ' s my wonderful friend and mentor . I ' m sorry I haven ' t known her all_of my life , &quot; Hedren said . &quot; Her whole philosophy of life is having fun and doing and saying outrageous things . &quot; At 101 , she still watches Ted Koppel every night . She has an opinion on everything . And , she ' s an incredible flirt. &quot; After Hedren introduced Wood &quot; live from Ojai , &quot; guests &quot; oohed &quot; when the image of the artist came_on a big screen . Wrapped in her trademark saris and sporting silver bangles , the white-haired Wood gleefully fielded questions from the audience , making numerous references_to her oft-quoted secret to longevity : chocolate and young_men . Remarking on her age , she said , &quot; Actually , I ' m only 32. &quot; Asked about the origin of her nickname &quot; Beato , &quot; she explained that a friend ' s baby -- now 60 -- could not pronounce &quot; Beatrice. &quot; &quot; Also , it ' s easier to sign pottery ' Beato. ' &quot; Summing_up her art , she described herself as an artist rather than a craftsman , not worrying whether her work was technically perfect . &quot; My interest was not in art . It was in being in_love . I think that ' s how it should be for women. &quot; Asked about her future plans , she said : &quot; I hope still to be able to work , and I like laughing_at young men. &quot; She then invited the entire group up_to her home , with one condition : &quot; Chocolate is my passport . Anyone who comes here must bring chocolate if they want a nice visit. &quot; Toast by Satellite Hedren was joined at the podium by archives board president Max Berry and archives director Richard Wattenmaker , who presented Wood with the award -- a cushion-shaped sterling_silver bowl from Tiffany &amp; Co . engraved with an irreverent stick figure created by Wood in the ' 20s for a ball in New York City . The broadcast ended with guests standing to toast the artist and sing a_few refrains of &quot; For she ' s a helluva potter. &quot; Many were impressed by the high-tech production . Gerald Buck , an archives board_member from Orange County , noted that Wood was born in 1893 when &quot; the light_bulb was just coming_on , &quot; and with the gains in technology made during her lifetime &quot; she ' s coming_to us via satellite. &quot; Unfortunately , Wood still missed out on one portion of the evening : an elegant dinner of roasted filet_mignon or halibut with tarragon sauce served at tables adorned with greenery and pots filled with ceramist ' s tools . In Wood ' s honor , dessert was a mousse torte of pure chocolate . Proceeds from the dinner benefit the archives ' West Coast center at the Huntington Library in San Marino . Buck was largely responsible_for bringing this year ' s awards dinner to Laguna : &quot; I think it ' s time Orange County had a national event to recognize one of California ' s great artists , &quot; said Buck , who attended with his wife , Bente . The archives is the largest collection of records on American art in existence . More_than 12 million objects , including letters , photographs , sketches and other documents from American artists , are available to researchers at centers across the United States . Wood is the oldest living artist to have given her papers to the archives . &quot; She ' s a living link to the past , &quot; said Paul Karlstrom , director of the archives on the West Coast . Faces in the crowd included Ram Pravesh Singh , Wood ' s manager ; Electa Anderson , event coordinator ; Kathryn Linehan , who produced a film on Wood shown to guests ; Darrel Anderson and Marsha Grinberg ; Robert and Mary Anne Emett ; Pat Hancock ; Mary Hendrickson ; Patricia House ; Gilbert and Victoria LeVasseur ; Carolyn Machado ; William and Irene Matthews ; John and Susie Meindi ; Jim and Pam Muzzy ; Jo Ellen Qualls ; Elaine Redfield ; Bud and Marilyn Schlain , and David and Susan Starry-Sheets .
