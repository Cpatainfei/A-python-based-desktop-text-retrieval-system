   <HEADLINE> EXTENT OF DAMAGE DAUNTS HEART OF HISTORIC FILLMORE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They have been the backbone of this town for decades . Passing their shops from father to son , they have kept their main_street alive . Together they have preserved a slice of small-town Americana so pleasant that movie crews flock there to recapture an era lost to tract homes and shopping_malls . But now , with their grit tested to the limit , some business owners on downtown Fillmore ' s Central Avenue say they don ' t know if they can ever recoup what they lost two weeks ago . No city in Ventura County was more devastated by the Jan . 17 earthquake than Fillmore , a town of 13 # 000 founded in 1888 on a railroad_line from Saugus to Ventura . The worst of the city ' s estimated $ 250 million in damage was_on Central Avenue , the heart of the downtown business_district . Officials of this small oil and farm town say the city -- destroyed by fire in 1903 , swamped by flood_in 1928 , rocked by at least three strong quakes this century -- has the pluck to bounce_back . But for now Fillmore is a town in mourning . &quot; It ' s like losing family , &quot; said gun shop owner Gary Creagle . &quot; People are already coming_up_to me and saying , ' We miss downtown . What are we going_to do without downtown ? ' &quot; Buffeted day to day by engineering reports that are ever gloomier , shopkeepers who spoke confidently of reconstruction a week ago are now wondering if they can afford $ 200 # 000 to $ 300 # 000 to rebuild . Because their buildings were made of unreinforced masonry , merchants were unable to get earthquake insurance . Owners of a half-dozen buildings with 14 shops -- nearly all built of brick and mortar between 1910 and 1925 -- say they ' ll tear_down their structures and not rebuild . They say they ' re too old to start over . Many of Central Avenue ' s 55 merchants say they don ' t know where they will end_up in the months to come . Nearly half of their shops are red-tagged as being too dangerous to enter . Most of the rest are marked as unsafe . A high wire-mesh fence keeps the public away . Visitors wear hard_hats when surveying the damage . &quot; People are finding_out it ' s too expensive to rebuild . So it ' s like , ' Mark us red . We ' re outta here , ' &quot; said Janet Foy , whose flower shop has little damage but whose neighbors are increasingly distraught . &quot; We ' ve heard a_few more negative things . Today has been a bad day. &quot; But even as merchants mourned their losses and pondered reconstructions that do not pencil out , they said they love their small_town and don ' t want to go anywhere else . They like the fact that they graduated from the same high_school as their grandfathers , that their moms jerked sodas at Clough ' s drug store and that the all-male Fillmore Club is reputed to have met for cards and meals at a second-story Central Avenue walk-up the second Monday of every month since World_War I . As crews entered cracked buildings to retrieve valuables last week , some merchants showed a resiliency that they say will bring Fillmore through its current trial . But the losses they face tear at the heart and soul of the town . Locals_call the 77-year-old Fillmore Theater , at the precise center of the town ' s business_district , &quot; The Show. &quot; Its bright new red-and-white marquee still announces &quot; Beethoven ' s 2nd , &quot; the last picture before the Jan . 17 quake . As the only movie_theater along the 50 miles between Ventura and Santa Clarita , it lured customers from miles around . But now a key wall has collapsed . Demolition is expected . And many residents say they regret the theater ' s passing . &quot; that ' s one of the things that hurts me more_than anything else , &quot; Fire_Chief Pat Askren said . &quot; A lot of little towns don ' t have their own theater . I ' m going_to miss it if it doesn ' t come back. &quot; The Show is important to a town like Fillmore because it had continued to draw not only teen-agers but old-timers who had once paid 20 cents to see its first talking pictures . &quot; I was there when the first sound movie came_to town , &quot; said Harvey Patterson , 74 . &quot; It was ' Hell ' s Angels , ' and in the very first scene there was a plane diving at us with its machine_gun going . Every kid hit the floor. &quot; The theater still brought the young to town after dark and customers to the street . &quot; People around here aren ' t real wealthy , and it ' s a nice source of fun . I don ' t know where we ' d go otherwise , &quot; said Gabe Asenas , proprietor of the Fillmore Billiard Parlor , a teen-age hangout a_few doors away . But the owner of the Fillmore Theater building , Dale Larson , is 76 and not in a position to think_about starting over . &quot; Right now I ' m just planning on demolishing the building and having the plot for_sale , &quot; he said . Late Friday , hope emerged that The Show might avoid demolition after all . City_Manager Roy Payne said state preservationists insist that the theater is not beyond repair and have presented calculations that suggest reconstruction might be feasible . What finally happens to the Fillmore Theater and other badly damaged Central Avenue businesses may depend_on disaster aid . U.S. Small Business Administration representatives are in town handing_out application_forms , but no loans so far . &quot; Everybody ' s getting more confused and frustrated as we go_along , &quot; said Ron Stewart , 44 , whose grandfather started Ballard Furniture 57 years ago . Stewart bought the building from his mother four years ago . His sister ' s manicure shop is one of his three tenants . Stewart figures it would cost him perhaps $ 250 # 000 to rebuild , &quot; so financially I would be better_off to just tear it down and start over , &quot; he said . Of course , he said , he couldn ' t afford the mortgage on the reconstruction loan . &quot; It just sounds like a lot of us are going_to be out a lot of money , or just out , period , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' d like to carry_on . What else am I going_to do ? My life ' s work has been in this business. &quot; Weighing heavily on Stewart , and on store owners close to the Fillmore Theater , however , is the question of what will happen to their businesses if the theater comes_down . Many of the Central Avenue stores have common walls , as was the practice 80 years ago . The strength of one store relies_on its next-door neighbor . When one building falls , the others are threatened in a domino effect , several merchants said . Darrell Garner ' s plumbing and hardware_stores share a wall with Stewart ' s building . And Garner shares a wall with The Show . &quot; The theater has dominoed me , &quot; Garner said . &quot; I ' m yellow-tagged now . They ' re letting me get all my stuff out of my store before they tag it red. &quot; The same fate could befall Ben Aparicio , 44 , whose building also abuts the movie_house . After building his tax preparation business to 3 # 000 clients , Aparicio said he and a relative bought his 1918 storefront four years ago for $ 250 # 000 . They invested another $ 50 # 000 in improvements last year . Then the earth shook furiously in Fillmore , wiping_out a lifetime of effort in seconds . Aparicio said he hopes to rebuild and save a building that has helped establish Fillmore ' s character . &quot; We all chose Fillmore because of the uniqueness of its architecture and its small-town feel , &quot; he said . &quot; But if any improvement through demolition or repair will bring this building_up to code , then I ' m for it . It needs to be done. &quot; Tenants along Central Avenue tend to agree . They realize what could have happened if the 6.6-magnitude , pre-dawn earthquake had occurred during business hours . But as Fillmore city officials moved quickly last week to demolish old , unsound buildings and rebuild from there , state and federal authorities intervened . Last week , the city announced that it would tear_down 14 buildings , including five Central Avenue structures that contain 13 different businesses . Included are the Central Market , the Fillmore Theater , the Fillmore health clinic , the landmark Masonic Building and a small structure next to it . On Friday , however , the state Office of Historic Preservation refused to allow any buildings to be razed , saying that its own inspections indicate that every Central Avenue structure can be saved . But building owners say they don ' t have the money for costly reconstruction . And state representatives acknowledge that ultimately they cannot stop demolitions . &quot; I think it ' s going_to be really changed when those buildings come_down , &quot; said Santa Paula architectural historian Judith Triem , who recommended against demolition . &quot; What was so good was that it was so cohesive . And when you take those buildings out , you have holes . And it ' s never really the same again. &quot; Part of Fillmore ' s distinctiveness will be lost , she said . &quot; This whole valley -- Fillmore , Piru and Santa Paula -- is like a step back in time , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s like a time warp , really . It reflects a sort of frozen-in-time place that doesn ' t go much past the 1930s. &quot; Several shops have reopened , and inspectors downgraded the danger of several others on Friday . Still , city officials say it could be 18 months before Central Avenue is fully recovered . And some merchants think that estimate is optimistic . &quot; I think it will be back to normal , but it will not be done for three or four years , &quot; Robert Harmonson said . &quot; Hopefully , in my lifetime I ' ll see it back the way it was a month ago. &quot; * RELATED STORIES : A14 , B1 , B3 , C1 , D1 , D4</TEXT>
