   <HEADLINE> CHARGES IN IRAQ ' FRIENDLY FIRE ' INCIDENT ARE DISMISSED ; MILITARY : TWENTY-SIX DIED IN TWO DOWNED HELICOPTERS . U.S. PILOT CLEARED . AIR_FORCE NOW FACES PR PROBLEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An Air_Force major general on Tuesday dismissed all charges of dereliction and negligent homicide against Lt . Col . Randy W . May , the F-15 fighter_pilot involved in the fatal downing of two U.S. Army helicopters over Iraq last spring in one of the worst &quot; friendly fire &quot; cases in U.S. military history . Maj . Gen . Eugene D . Santarelli , the 17th Air_Force commander who has final authority in the case , based his decision on a recommendation made last month by the lead investigating officer . The dismissal ends the possibility of criminal disciplinary actions against any of the Europe-based U.S. Air_Force personnel who were involved in the incident . May , 41 , a decorated pilot with almost 20 years of service with the Air_Force , had been charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide for his role in the shoot-down , in which 26 people -- everybody in the two helicopters -- were killed . He was also charged with two counts of dereliction of duty . A member of the Germany-based 53rd Fighter Squadron , May had been assigned to patrol the air space over northern Iraq in an effort to enforce a U.N.-ordered ban on Iraqi military flights there . On April 14 , he and his lead pilot , Capt . Eric A . Wickson , spotted two U.S. Blackhawk helicopters , mistook them for Iraqi Hinds and shot them down . In addition to the 15 Americans on board , five Kurds working for the United States and six military officials from Britain , France and Turkey were killed . Initial investigations suggested that May had failed to respond correctly when lead pilot Wickson asked him to confirm that the helicopters were Iraqi . But the Air_Force said Tuesday that Santarelli dismissed the charges because May had &quot; followed proper procedures in yielding control of the action to his lead pilot. &quot; Throughout the investigation , May has stated that Wickson had told him there were two enemy helicopters in the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone , and that he saw nothing to indicate that this was incorrect . The action Tuesday left one relatively low-ranking officer , a U.S.-based captain , as the only official to face a court-martial over the shoot-down , which authorities have conceded resulted from a series of blunders reaching far up into the chain of command . The captain , Jim Wang , had headed the Airborne Warning and Control_System plane crew that was supposed to have kept track of all aircraft in the region and to have warned the patrolling F-15s that the helicopters were American , not Iraqi . The Air_Force announced on Monday that Wang will face a court-martial on three counts of dereliction of duty but dismissed similar charges against two majors and two lieutenants who were also aboard the AWACS plane . All of these decisions were in_line with investigators ' recommendations . In addition , the Air_Force a_few weeks ago dropped similar charges against Wickson , who was also later given immunity in return for his testimony in the investigation involving May . The round of decisions , made in accordance with longstanding Air_Force procedures for such incidents , has left the service -- and its leaders -- in something of a public-relations quandary over the way it has handled the incident . While many insiders support the dismissals of charges as justified , on grounds that the deficiencies were in Air_Force procedures more_than in the conduct of one or two officers , they fear that the public may perceive the decisions as a whitewash . As a result , Pentagon officials said Tuesday that the Air_Force was considering the unusual step of making public the administrative punishment that several of the officers involved have received in place of a court-martial . The Pentagon already announced in June that Brig . Gen . Jeffrey S . Pilkington , who had been in_charge of the operation in northern Iraq at the time of the shoot-down , had been relieved of his command in the wake of the accident . Pointedly , the Air_Force also issued a news release Tuesday stating that the dismissal of the charges against May &quot; does not preclude administrative action &quot; against any of the individuals involved in the incident . &quot; Some kind of announcement is going_to be worked_out , &quot; one Air_Force_officer said . Walsh reported from Berlin , Pine from Washington .</TEXT>
