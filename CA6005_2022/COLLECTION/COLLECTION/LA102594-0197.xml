   <HEADLINE> ITO REJECTS BID TO OUST 80 PANELISTS ; COURT : SIMPSON CASE PROSECUTOR FAILS IN EFFORT TO REMOVE PROSPECTIVE JURORS . DEFENSE EFFORT TO DELAY TRIAL IS ALSO REFUSED AS NEW CONCERN OVER JURORS ' CANDOR ARISES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Smarting from the release of transcripts in which she questioned the honesty of prospective jurors , a prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson murder trial on Monday unsuccessfully tried to remove about 80 panelists -- the entire first wave being considered during a selection process marked by controversy and delays . Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito denied the motion by Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark , who at first sought to disband the entire 300-member jury pool . At the same time , Ito turned_down a renewed defense effort to have Simpson released on bail and to have trial in the case postponed for a year . Both motions were prompted by deep frustrations about the task of selecting a jury . During a closed-door hearing last week , prosecutors and defense_attorneys expressed misgivings about the candor of the prospective jurors they were questioning . Their remarks were first made public in a transcript unsealed by Ito on Friday . In it , Clark suggested that &quot; many , if not most &quot; prospective jurors in the case had been lying_in order to win a place on the jury . Although Ito rejected Clark ' s motion Monday , concerns about the jury pool rapidly resurfaced once the judge and lawyers returned to the business of questioning potential jurors . The first candidate called to the box said other members of the jury pool may be less than candid . &quot; I just don ' t believe them , &quot; said the woman , a 51-year-old Glendale resident who was later excused from service . &quot; I think they ' re saying one thing and they ' re meaning something else . . . . I think they ' re coming here with a menu or agenda I haven ' t even seen. &quot; Clark said those comments redoubled her fears about the possibility of jurors tainted by exposure to publicity , and emphasized the need to eventually sequester the jury that is chosen to hear the Simpson murder case . Simpson has pleaded not_guilty to killing his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend , Ronald Lyle Goldman . &quot; Sequestration is no longer simply an option , &quot; Clark said . &quot; It ' s a mandate. &quot; Trying to persuade Ito that the idea is feasible , Clark said prosecutors had found a possible site for the jury to be sequestered , an area near an unspecified college campus where jurors could walk , exercise and attend lectures . Transportation to and from court would be convenient , she added . But her pitch met with a scornful response from Simpson lawyer Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , who has vigorously opposed sequestering the jury despite the publicity surrounding the case . &quot; I have a place : It ' s called Neverland , &quot; Cochran told the judge , apparently referring to the estate of another celebrity client , entertainer Michael Jackson . &quot; It has all kinds of rides. &quot; Although he left open the option of eventually sequestering the jury , Ito declined to approve that idea Monday and said he would wait to see how further questioning goes before making a final_decision . &quot; I ' m not at the point of imploding yet , &quot; Ito said . The prosecution request for the first panel of prospective jurors to be sent home is the latest indicator of the government attorneys ' mounting frustration with the results of their jury questioning . Last week , Ito released the previously sealed transcript in which Simpson lawyer Robert L . Shapiro said he was concerned that prospective jurors would say anything to get_on the &quot; case of the century. &quot; In response to that , Clark was quoted as complaining that many of the prospective jurors appeared to be lying_in order to cover_up their fondness for Simpson . &quot; Many if not most ( of the prospective jurors ) are lying to the detriment of the People because they are sitting there as fans of this defendant saying : ' We want to get_on this jury because we want to turn_a_blind_eye to your evidence and a deaf ear to the testimony so we can acquit this man no matter what , ' &quot; Clark said during that hearing . Although she added that she wished she could subject prospective jurors to lie_detector tests , Clark said Monday that she meant that remark facetiously and that the context was lost on reporters forced to rely_on a transcript rather than hearing the statement directly . Outside court , however , Cochran said he did not take Clark ' s comments as a joke . And Shapiro , Clark ' s principal nemesis , agreed , calling his adversary ' s remarks &quot; one of the most idiotic statements ever made in a courtroom anywhere. &quot; When defense_attorneys first proposed that the transcript from the Oct . 19 hearing be made public , prosecutors objected . On Monday , Clark complained that its release resulted in news coverage unfavorable to the prosecution . &quot; Those remarks were made in closed hearings that the People were confident would remain closed , &quot; Clark said . Prosecutors had said they believed the transcript should remain sealed because it included a statement by Simpson to the judge that they characterized as self-serving . But defense_attorneys accused the government lawyers of fighting the transcript ' s release because it was embarrassing to them . Shapiro said Ito was right to release that transcript because prosecutors were not allowed to seal documents merely because they were interested in &quot; protecting themselves from their own stupidity. &quot; Whatever the motivation for prosecutors seeking to seal the transcript , its release would not matter if prospective jurors were obeying an admonition given to them by Ito . Last week , he instructed the 80 or so members of the jury panel then being questioned not to read newspapers or magazines and not to watch television , listen to the radio or enter bookstores . As long as they are abiding_by that admonition , the coverage should not affect their ability to be fair , defense_attorneys noted . Clark , however , told Ito that prospective jurors cannot avoid media coverage even if they want to , a point made last week by at least one potential juror who conceded that he had overheard news_reports despite his attempts to stay away . &quot; It ' s in the air , &quot; that man said before being dismissed . As questioning of prospective jurors continued Monday , the prosecution ' s fear that some jurors were being exposed to media reports appeared to be borne_out . One man said he read the sports section of USA Today and threw_away the rest of the paper , apparently not realizing that Ito wants panelists to avoid all media , not just coverage of the case . That man was dismissed , as was a prospective juror who admitted to listening to the radio and turning it off whenever news came_on . After one of those panelists was excused , Shapiro mumbled : &quot; Pretty soon , we won ' t have a panel. &quot; Meanwhile , the Glendale woman who voiced concerns about her fellow panelists emphasized how difficult it was to abide_by Ito ' s strict rules . Saying she had been forced to make many adjustments in her life to accommodate the judge ' s concerns , that woman noted that she had resorted_to walking her dog over and over to fill the time . &quot; I walk my dog almost constantly , &quot; she said . &quot; The dog cries when I walk in the door : ' No more , no more. ' &quot; Although legal_experts sympathized_with the difficulties both sides have in finding impartial jurors , some questioned the wisdom of Clark ' s criticisms of the panel and her attempt to have it dismissed . They noted that if there is a conviction and appeal in the Simpson case , prosecutors could be in the unusual position of having to defend verdicts reached by the very people whose credibility they have now publicly assailed . &quot; What the prosecution has done is laid the groundwork for the defense appeal , &quot; said Laurie Levenson , a Loyola law_school professor and former federal prosecutor . &quot; If this group becomes the jury , you have to work with the assumption that they ' re fair. &quot; Levenson and others said one irony of the prosecution seeking to excuse the first panel is that those are the only prospective jurors who have received Ito ' s stern admonition directing them to avoid all media , not just coverage of the Simpson case . Thus , the panel that prosecutors wanted to be excused may be the group of people most protected from publicity surrounding the case . &quot; It would be folly for us to start over and think we ' re going to be any better , &quot; said Cochran in opposing the prosecution motion . &quot; You ' ll never find a panel that knows less than the panel we have now . And they know everything. &quot; Harland W . Braun , a noted criminal defense_lawyer and former deputy district_attorney , agreed . &quot; Where are you going_to get any better jurors than these ? &quot; he asked . &quot; They are probably the most shielded people out there. &quot; In rejecting the prosecution motion , Ito sounded some of the same themes . &quot; I feel that this particular panel has had the benefit of the court ' s strongest admonition , &quot; Ito said . &quot; I ' m not willing to say this panel is lost at this point . This panel is our best hope. &quot;</TEXT>
