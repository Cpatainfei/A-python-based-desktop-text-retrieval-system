   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : BURBANK ; VAN GETS A TOUCH OF BRASS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You won ' t see Ernest Steingold ' s specialized van on the cover of Road &amp; Track . Or on a rotating platform at any auto show . But if you do see it on your street , it is 100 % guaranteed to turn your head . Steingold ' s labor_of_love , this most customized of vans , is a half-ton that GMC engineers would n ' t even recognize . It could be the 20-pound brass eagle with a 3-foot wingspan on the roof . Or the 100 brass unicorns and winged horses . Or the 30 life-size masks and 300 belt_buckles . Or the $ 14 # 000 worth of coins . But this brass-covered beauty is one of a kind . &quot; One woman who had been all_over the world told me my van was like the eighth wonder of the world and I should take it all_over the world so people could see it , &quot; said Steingold , a 66-year-old Burbank resident . &quot; That would be nice if someone would sponsor me. &quot; The project , on which Steingold often spends six hours at a stretch , began when he bought just your average used van in 1978 . Then he and his wife , Gretchen , bought three brass elephants for hood ornaments . &quot; Why not put more on it , &quot; Steingold said after gazing at the elephants . Now , all_the ornaments are solid brass -- except for the Susan B . Anthony and Eisenhower dollars and Kennedy half_dollars and quarters . Steingold , who owns Dreese Vacuum store in Burbank , uses the van for deliveries and pickups . He also tries to find time to stop at the farmer ' s market , Mann ' s Chinese theater and Disneyland , where local residents and tourists react with awe , praise and sometimes scorn . He ' s been asked_for his autograph . One man walked up_to him in a restaurant while he was eating and said : &quot; I love your van out there . It ' s great and it would be an honor to buy you dinner. &quot; When Steingold asked how the man knew it was his , the reply was , &quot; You look_like it would be yours. &quot; &quot; Maybe this van is paying me back indirectly for all_the work I ' ve done on it , &quot; Steingold said . The autograph requests and oohs and aahs also help ease the sting when he hears , &quot; It ' s a piece of junk. &quot; &quot; It makes me feel so good that people enjoy it , but a_few rotten apples will upset you , &quot; Steingold said . &quot; I ' ve learned never to let anybody see I ' m upset because you never lower yourself . You ' ve got_to be a nice guy , because they won ' t forget the van and I want them to remember a good_guy had the van. &quot; And , Steingold said , the van is still a work_in_progress . &quot; It keeps_on growing . It ' s a lifetime project , &quot; Steingold said . &quot; I ' m proud_of it . It gives me a feeling I ' ve done something in my life. &quot; SONDRA FARRELL BAZROD</TEXT>
