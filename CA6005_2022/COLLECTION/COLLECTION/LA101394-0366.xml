   <TEXT> In this tiny Swiss village , farmer Claude Torche personifies the national character . Sure , he said , he had seen some of the people who lived_in the farmhouse on the_hill . But he minded his own business . And he had no idea it was a cult until firefighters found 23 bullet-riddled bodies there . Cheiry , population 240 , &quot; is a quiet place , &quot; Torche explained the next day as he milked his cows . &quot; And something like this , well , it ' s especially strange for Switzerland. &quot; A few days later , though , Torche admitted that he had more_than a passing acquaintance with that farmhouse . His own sister-in-law and nephew had been living there , and were probably among the dead . As investigators continue their worldwide search for clues_in the deaths of 53 people aligned with Luc Jouret ' s Order of the Solar Temple , one thing has become clear : The white-collar sect found Switzerland a country tailor-made for secretive cult operations . This nation of 7 million people , a mountainous gem smaller than San Bernardino County , has a well-founded image of peace and prosperity . But growing furiously amid the bucolic green pastures , where cowbells echo off snowcapped peaks , are more_than 600 religious sects , experts say . And that number , the most of any European_country , represents a fourfold increase in the past 30 years . Those gnostic groups , many of which trace their ancestry to pagan and early Christian sects , &quot; find a safe place in Switzerland , &quot; said Massimo Introvigne , head of the Center for Studies on New Religions , an international_organization of scholars based just over the Alps in Turin , Italy . In fact , the two bases of Jouret ' s sect -- Geneva , Switzerland ' s third-largest city , and Montreal , Canada ' s second-largest -- &quot; have the richest variety of esoteric and gnostic groups in the world , &quot; Introvigne added . The organizations , which count about 200 # 000 members in Switzerland , find comfort in this nation ' s renowned banking privacy laws and its international flavor , as well as its three official languages -- French , German and Italian . But the country also is fertile ground because of its centuries-old tradition of religious tolerance and the very nature of its people . The Swiss are fiercely independent and intensely private ; it came as little surprise to many here that a cult could flourish in the smallest of villages without being noticed . Many Swiss also are wealthy and , as in other Western nations , spiritual searchers , increasingly dissatisfied with organized religion and preferring small groups to Europe ' s ornate churches . &quot; It ' s a worrying trend , &quot; said Joachim Muller , head of the_Swiss ( Catholic ) Bishops Conference study group on sects . &quot; Our people are looking_for a sense of life , but they are very individual . And there are quite a number creating their own religious movements. &quot; That was how the Order of the Solar Temple began , in the early 1980s , with Luc Jouret ' s homeopathic medical_practice in Geneva . It ended last week with what the group itself said was both suicide and murder -- suicide for the inner_circle of true believers and murder for those not yet &quot; fully evolved , &quot; for their own good . In Geneva , an international crossroads , Jouret came_in contact with the occult world and a range of foreigners , many of them well-heeled . He became a popular lecturer in alternative_medicine and ecology in Geneva , as well as Montreal , Martinique and , later , Australia . He used those lectures to recruit followers to an organization he called Club Amenta . Later , he formed a new group , Club Archedia , with initiation rites and a clear hierarchy , for those truly committed to his gospel of apocalypse . Then , the most devoted members of Club Archedia were invited into the secret inner_circle , which became known as the Solar Temple . Like many similar organizations , it traced its roots to the Knights_Templar , a 12th-Century Catholic religious and military order that became powerful during the Crusades but was persecuted by the king of France and then dissolved by Pope Clement V in the early 14th Century . Basically , Jouret ' s adherents believed that in 1981 a &quot; hidden hierarchy &quot; of the &quot; Universal Solar Temple &quot; had manifested itself to Jouret and a select few in Geneva . Seven &quot; entities &quot; from that hierarchy , which had been hidden in the Great Pyramids in Egypt , left Earth in 1993 . And the last three left Australia earlier this year , paving the way for the group ' s &quot; transit &quot; to &quot; the absolute dimension of truth. &quot; Jouret ' s role , according to the documents , was to lead the group . Police are investigating allegations that the group laundered money and engaged in international arms dealing . However , experts say those activities , even if proven , were probably simply part of the group ' s efforts to raise money and protect itself . &quot; These people believed_in their ideology , &quot; said Introvigne , who has written 24 books on religious sects . &quot; It wasn ' t just a front for making money . I doubt this esoteric mishmash of ideology was built just to cover a money-laundering operation. &quot; Seemingly supporting that thesis has been the discovery among the victims of the bodies of Joseph di Mambro , 70 , Jouret ' s chief aide , and Camille Pilet , the group ' s financial controller . Jouret ' s body has not yet been identified and , officially , an international warrant for his arrest remains in_effect . &quot; It would n ' t be the first time that a leader masterminded a suicide and then didn ' t kill himself , &quot; Introvigne said . &quot; He could easily find some theological justification for remaining behind. &quot; There was evidence of dissension in the group before the deaths , although whether it was over money or personalities or theology no one is sure . But it is clear , from the group ' s own writings , that murder as well as suicide was_on its agenda . Documents mailed to Lausanne around the time of the killings , to Swiss historian Jean-Francois Mayer , secretary of Introvigne ' s center and the leading expert on the Solar Temple , are &quot; materially genuine , &quot; say scholars who have studied them in recent days . In those writings , the Solar Temple said the true believers intended to voluntarily &quot; translate to another plane , &quot; apparently by mass suicide , and destroy their homes . But the documents acknowledged that some in the group had not yet understood that &quot; leaving this world is necessary &quot; and would need to be gently helped to die for their own benefit . Lastly , the group wrote that those who intended to betray the Temple leaders would &quot; not escape their just retribution. &quot; Of the 53 victims , at least 20 were shot to death and one of them , here in Cheiry , had eight bullet wounds . Three in Canada , including a 3-month-old boy , were stabbed to death . Two in Canada were burned alive . And the remainder had either been suffocated with plastic trash bags or killed by injections of drugs . Investigators believe that at least one person , and perhaps more , were present at all three locations -- near Montreal in Canada , at the Cheiry farmhouse and at three ski chalets in Granges-sur-Salvan , Switzerland -- just before fires broke_out at each site . In fact , the couple believed responsible_for the three stabbing deaths in Canada were found dead in Switzerland . It ' s hard for some here to imagine that Jouret and his fellow Temple members could look_at the splendor of the_Swiss countryside and conclude that the end of humanity was nigh . &quot; We have quite a special country , &quot; said Muller , of the_Swiss Bishop ' s Conference . &quot; But for some of these groups , even Switzerland is a rough sea . Their anxiety grows and all logical_thinking disappears . They figure that mass_murder or suicide is the only way to escape these rough seas. &quot; When John_Calvin formed his church in Geneva in 1541 , founded on his Christian Protestant doctrine , he was drawn there by the country ' s prosperity , but also its essential characteristics of &quot; conformity , tedium and banality , &quot; as one historian put it . Even in those days , though , Geneva was a hotbed of fanatical religious_leaders . It is especially difficult to apply national stereotypes in Europe , where television and other cultural forces have created a more cosmopolitan environment . But the_Swiss remain an independent , politically conservative people . They stayed steadfastly neutral during World_War_II and , even today , have resisted joining the European Union , defending their place as the world ' s Sonderfall , or special case . Unlike other countries in Europe , Switzerland does not have a single national identity . Rather , it is a collection of highly autonomous communities in 26 separate cantons , or states . In the canton that includes Geneva , for example , the law mandates a distinct separation between church and state . The states also respect each other ' s sovereignty and , perhaps more important , the_Swiss respect one another ' s privacy . The nation ' s unwritten_law is that people don ' t snoop and they don ' t ask questions . Beyond that , Switzerland has always been a great place to hide , for religious zealots but also for political exiles , artists and shady financiers . Jean-Luc Godard , the New Wave filmmaker , finds his apartment on Lake Geneva an ideal place for quiet creativity . When Charlie Chaplin was kicked_out of the United States , he found solace in Vevey , on the same lake , where he later died . &quot; Why Switzerland ? Because it is a very quiet place known for its cuckoo_clocks and chocolate , &quot; said Marie Geneve , of the IKOR Center , which follows religious sects in Europe from offices in Paris . &quot; Switzerland is a landmark because some of these sects are interested in money . And . . . because there is great religious tolerance. &quot; But scholars believe that such a massacre could have happened anywhere that such little-known sects operate , especially among groups that believe they are being persecuted by the authorities . J . Gordon Melton , of the Institute for the Study of American Religion in Santa Barbara , says the killings suggest that authorities everywhere should listen more to serious religious scholars and pay less attention to militant anti-cult movements , who focus their attention on law-abiding movements , such_as the Unification Church . &quot; This tragedy should tell governments to keep_in closer touch with international scholars , who knew quite a_few things about the Solar Temple , &quot; Melton wrote in a paper presented with Introvigne at the Communal Studies Conference in Oneida , N.Y. , last weekend . &quot; Pseudo-experts lead authorities astray , thus diverting resources from watching the small minority of apocalyptic-occult groups where real dangers may be involved , &quot; Melton added . The growth of small religious sects in Switzerland is reflected worldwide , where experts say more_than 800 new spiritual groups appear every year . &quot; Man doesn ' t live_by bread alone , &quot; said Jean Vernette , a priest in France and author of 30 books on religious sects . &quot; He needs a spiritual dimension , and that opens the door to all sorts of crazy religions. &quot;</TEXT>
