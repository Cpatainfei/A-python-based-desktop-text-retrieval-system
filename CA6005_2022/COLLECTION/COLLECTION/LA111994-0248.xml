   <TEXT> The nation ' s Ro man Catholic bishops ended their four-day annual conference Thursday with the adoption of a wide-ranging set of rules that will broaden local bishops ' influence over the medical and business practices of Catholic hospitals . The prelates , ending the annual fall meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops , also issued a statement sharply critical of the passage of California ' s Proposition 187 , calling it &quot; symptomatic_of deeply rooted fear and frustration among our citizens. &quot; The measure , which would deny education and most health services to illegal immigrants , was approved by 59 % of the state ' s voters last week , but enforcement was blocked Wednesday by a federal judge while the courts consider the constitutionality of its provisions . &quot; In seeking to cure social and economic ills , this proposition strikes at the most vulnerable among us -- children , the sick and the needy -- without addressing the larger social and political causes for the problems , especially at the federal level , &quot; the bishops ' statement said . At a news_conference , Cardinal-designate William Keeler , president of the bishops ' group , called that statement on immigration and one adopted earlier in the week on violence &quot; the two most important actions &quot; the bishops took . The meeting , which generated little controversy or debate , also found the bishops walking a tightrope between closer scrutiny of their actions by the Vatican and their efforts to broaden the participation of women in the church . * In a document aimed at_easing tensions prompted by Pope John Paul II ' s statement this year that the subject of female ordination in the Catholic_Church is no longer open_to debate , the bishops declared their belief in &quot; the fundamental equality of women and men &quot; and urged that more top jobs in the church be filled by women . But they refused to challenge the Pope ' s declaration . Although the bishops ruled_out discussion of ordination , their statement acknowledged that sexism is still present in the church and suggested alternative ways women can exercise power in the nation ' s largest Christian body . &quot; We can say with certainty that discrimination against women contradicts the will of Christ , &quot; the bishops said . &quot; We are painfully aware that sexism . . . is still present in some members of the church . &quot; We reject sexism and pledge renewed efforts to guard against it in church teaching and practice . We commit ourselves to make_sure that our words and actions express our belief in the equality of all women and men. &quot; The adoption of the statement , &quot; Strengthening the Bonds of Peace , &quot; came_after nearly two hours of debate , most of it directed at an amendment that liberal bishops feared would be used by opponents of feminism to undermine the drive for equality . Led by Archbishop John Roach of Minneapolis-St . Paul , those bishops prevailed in inserting substitute language , calling_on the amendment to reject any &quot; extreme position that impedes dialogue and divides the church. &quot; In seeking to enlarge the role of women , the statement calls_on the bishops to look_at ways women can fill more top jobs in the church at the parish and diocesan level and the national level . * Annette Kane , executive_director of the National Council of Catholic Women , called the statement &quot; a great affirmation &quot; of the role of women and praised the steps the bishops have taken_in putting women in top posts in the church ' s bureaucracy in Washington . The Vatican ' s oversight of the U.S. church was demonstrated in a small but important way during the brief discussion of the new rules for Catholic health_care facilities . Bishop Alfred Hughes of Baton_Rouge , La. , chairman of the conference ' s doctrine committee , acknowledged that the Vatican had told the bishops to make about 50 amendments to the directives . Many of those Vatican amendments were aimed at eliminating any suggestion of differences among theologians or bishops on the issue of what kinds of medical treatment are ethically allowable . The new rules update a similar set of regulations issued in 1971 by taking_into_account changes in medical technology , such_as in_vitro fertilization , and the economically driven trend among Catholic hospitals to form partnerships and alliances with non-Catholic facilities . * &quot; While we rejoice in the potential for good inherent in many of these ( new reproductive ) technologies , we cannot assume that what is technically possible is always morally right , &quot; the rules state . &quot; Reproductive technologies that substitute for the marriage act are not consistent with human dignity. &quot; The directives allow some forms of assisted conception but reject artificial_insemination , surrogate motherhood , fetal experimentation , sterilization and abortion . In a section on the care of the dying , the new rules reaffirm the church ' s longstanding opposition to suicide and euthanasia as &quot; never . . . morally acceptable options. &quot; But the rules do allow painkilling medicines to be given to a dying patient &quot; even if this therapy may indirectly shorten the person ' s life. &quot; The most profound result of the new rules is that local bishops will be given the authority to approve or disapprove of new forms of partnership between Catholic and non-Catholic facilities . Such partnerships &quot; can pose serious challenges &quot; in carrying_out Catholic moral_principles , the rules state . &quot; The risk of scandal cannot be underestimated when partnerships are not built_upon common values and moral principles. &quot; * The prelates also adopted a statement decrying what they called the growing culture of violence in America , and they heard an interim report by a committee on sexual abuse against children by priests . &quot; Violence -- in our homes , our schools and streets , our nation and world -- is destroying the lives , dignity and hopes of millions of our sisters and brothers , &quot; the bishops ' statement said . The bishops decried social trends that contribute to violence . They cited everything from aggressive driving and sensationalist talk_shows to pornography and the easy availability of guns . What is needed , they said , is a &quot; moral revolution &quot; that would repair the nation ' s frayed social fabric . The bishops ' statement , &quot; Confronting a Culture of Violence : A Catholic Framework for Action , &quot; joins a growing chorus of concern that has included statements and workshops by such groups as the Evangelical Lutheran_Church in America , the United Methodist_Church and the National Council of Churches . Auxiliary Bishop John Ricard of Baltimore , chairman of the committee that drafted the statement , said the bishops &quot; do not believe the traditional liberal and conservative answers are adequate responses to this crisis . * &quot; We ' ve lost a clear sense of right and wrong , &quot; he said . &quot; We value things more_than people . . . This is not about policies and politics , but life and death. &quot; In an oral report on the efforts of the church to deal with sexual misconduct by pastors and other church employees , Bishop John Kinney of Fargo , N.D. , told the bishops that &quot; in most dioceses , strong , pastoral and effective written local policies &quot; are in place . &quot; I know that I speak_for all_of us when I say that as bishops of this country , we are sorry_for the pain and scandal caused by the actions &quot; of pedophiles in the church community , &quot; especially when they are our own priests , &quot; he said . &quot; We are also sorry_for those times we have not handled these matters in the best possible way. &quot;</TEXT>
