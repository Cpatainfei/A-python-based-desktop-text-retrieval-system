   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; SPOTLIGHT ; FOR GERMAN TEAM , D-DAY IN REVERSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From Bonn , Germany ' s General Anzeiger newspaper , Friday : &quot; A D-Day of Football ? &quot; &quot; That the world championship went_to the United States is nothing but an attempt to eliminate that big white spot on the map of the FIFA . . . . It ' s a fact that there are 250 million potential customers for soccer shoes , T-shirts , balls , trinkets and more.A gigantic market to be developed . . . . &quot; The world championship beginning today offers the last chance to make King Soccer acceptable in the USA . If this goes_by , the industry might not be mobilized again . But so far the organizers still dream that their world championship will be the detonator . Should it be so , then Lothar Matthaeus , Andreas Moeller &amp; Co . will possibly return in 50 years as those who freed the country from the dictatorship of American_football and baseball . And maybe then they will sit in Soldier Field in Chicago , where today the opening match takes_place , and dream of June 17 , 1994 -- the D-Day of Soccer. &quot;</TEXT>
