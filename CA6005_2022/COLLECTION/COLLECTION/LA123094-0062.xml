   <HEADLINE> MASS RESIGNATION IN BANGLADESH IS BID TO FORCE PREMIER FROM OFFICE ; POLITICS : STRIKE SHUTS DOWN CAPITAL AFTER 147 OPPOSITION LAWMAKERS QUIT . STANDOFF HAS PARALYZED PARLIAMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This week , reborn parliamentary_democracy in Bangladesh , one of the world ' s poorest and most densely populated countries , has been plunged into crisis by the mass resignation of the opposition from Parliament . It was the latest , most desperate bid by hostile lawmakers to force Prime_Minister Khaleda Zia from office . For 10 months , opposition parties had been boycotting proceedings in the chamber , accusing Zia and her Bangladesh Nationalist Party of vote-rigging and corruption , and demanding that she quit . On Thursday , an anti-government strike virtually shut_down the major cities of the low-lying country on the Bay_of_Bengal . Militants marched by the thousands through the streets of the capital , Dhaka , to demand Zia ' s ouster . Shops and banks closed for eight hours , and cars , trucks and rickshaws stayed off the roads . It was a manifestation of an increasingly common style of political struggle that Bangladesh can ill afford . Each day of a general strike costs the country an estimated $ 50 million in lost production -- equivalent_to the annual wages of 250 # 000 Bangladeshis . Like most of the rest of the Indian subcontinent , Bangladesh , home to 122 million people , is in the throes of economic reforms that include the liberalization of government regulations and the energetic wooing of foreign capital . Zia , elected in 1991 , has voiced fears that the persistent political turmoil is torpedoing her government ' s plans . &quot; This is a classic no-win situation for the country , &quot; Mahfuz Anam , editor of the Dhaka-based Daily Star newspaper , said . &quot; Right now , the people are despondent. &quot; On Wednesday night , in an attempt to force the 50-year-old Zia ' s hand , 147 of the 154 opposition members resigned from the 330-seat Parliament . Their supporters plan three more nationwide strikes next week , further imperiling the economy and the legitimacy of Zia , the second leader in Bangladesh ' s brief but tumultuous history to have been elected freely and fairly . &quot; This is very unfortunate and shows the failure of both government and opposition , &quot; said Serajul Islam Choudhury , a professor at the University of Dhaka . &quot; The government has failed to govern the country . . . . But the opposition also has not behaved in a very responsible manner. &quot; * But opposition leader Hasina Wajed of the Awami League claims it is the prime_minister who constitutes the danger . &quot; Our struggle is a fundamental one , &quot; she said recently . &quot; We want to restore the people ' s right to choose a government by free exercise of franchise. &quot; Some observers think the struggle has become first and foremost a clash of the steel wills of Zia -- widow of a Bangladeshi military ruler and president -- and of the fiery-tongued Wajed -- daughter of the country ' s first president . Though the opposition began boycotting Parliament on March 1 , when a minister made a crack impugning their Muslim credentials , the breach became irreparable when the government apparently used vote-rigging to win a parliamentary by-election . Zia ' s enemies demanded that she step_down . The standoff has paralyzed the Parliament , leading to the delay of important laws . The economic impact has been calamitous , with the Metropolitan Chamber_of_Commerce and Industry estimating that political strife since Zia came_to office has cost the nation ' s business_community more_than $ 250 million . A 40-day mediation mission to the former British possession by a Commonwealth mediator , Sir Ninian Stephen , flopped last month . Stephen , an Australian , left Dhaka saying the suspicion and mistrust were too intense . * Since winning independence from Pakistan in a 1971 blood bath , overwhelmingly Muslim Bangladesh has experienced two military takeovers , 19 reported coup attempts and two assassinations of supreme leaders . Parliamentary democracy was restored in 1991 . In an eleventh-hour search for a compromise on Wednesday , the government and the loose opposition coalition of Wajed ' s Awami League , the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami and the Jatiya Party almost closed a deal . Zia drastically altered her stance to say she was ready to step_down 30 days before the next scheduled election in 1996 , sources in Dhaka said . Power would have been vested in the hands of a temporary caretaker government . However , Zia reportedly balked when her opponents refused to accept an additional demand that they promise not to organize strikes or other forms of political protest before people go_to the polls . The opposition lawmakers then tendered their resignations . Bangladesh ' s government now faces a tough choice upon which its survival may depend . Zia ' s party , which controls 54 % of the parliamentary seats , is entitled by law to remain in office until the lawmakers ' five-year terms expire in 1996 . So Zia is not obligated to call an early general_election , as the opposition now is demanding . But if she does not , she would have to hold 147 partial elections within the next three months to replace the legislators who resigned . If she does that , the opposition has made_it clear that it will try to disrupt them . Zia publicly repeated on Thursday the offer to leave_office a month early . In exchange , she asked opposition lawmakers to reconsider their resignations . But Wajed insisted that the president dissolve Parliament immediately to prepare_for elections .</TEXT>
