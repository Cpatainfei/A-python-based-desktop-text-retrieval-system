   <HEADLINE> ENVIRONMENT ; LONDON COMES CLEAN IN POLL OF EUROPE ' S TIDIEST CAPITALS ; HERE ' S THE DIRT : ROMANS SHOULD POOP-SCOOP MORE , AND AMSTERDAM NEEDS TO CRACK_DOWN ON GRAFFITI .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You could have fooled most Londoners when word got_out that a survey of major European capitals showed theirs was the cleanest . London residents have taken an almost perverse pride in describing their city as getting dirtier every year . But after years of being considered a capital of litter , particularly in the central tourist area , London was ranked above eight other European capitals in a cleanliness comparison of city_centers . The survey was conducted by the Tidy Britain Group , an anti-litter organization that sent pairs of observers to each city ' s main governmental , shopping , terminal and tourist areas . The cities ranked on a descending scale were London , Berne , Paris , Berlin , Amsterdam ( largest city in the_Netherlands , though The Hague is the capital ) , Rome , Brussels , Madrid and Athens , which the surveyors said came_in a solid last . The surveyors attempted to measure the amount of litter , graffiti , vandalism and dog mess in an area of one-kilometer radius ( about two-thirds of a mile ) from four central points : a major government building , a busy shopping street , a major rail station and a popular central tourist spot . The group ' s director , Elizabeth Allen , said : &quot; Our surveyors found very little litter in central London . That may sound strange , but people sometimes judge on preconceptions rather than the actuality. &quot; Environmental Secretary John Gummer was delighted with the results , declaring : &quot; It is time we took the view which other cities have . We should praise our successes and celebrate that which we do well. &quot; London was described in the survey as &quot; very clean , &quot; while Berne , Switzerland , which won the cleanliness award two years ago , was called &quot; generally very clean. &quot; The cleanest central shopping street was found to be Berne ' s Bahnhofplatz ; the dirtiest , Boulevard Haussmann in Paris . Of Rome , the Tidy Britain people reported : &quot; The Romans have not yet learned to poop-scoop . It would be a much cleaner city if its citizens stopped smoking. &quot; Amsterdam was said to have the most prolific graffiti artists . At the bottom of the table , the surveyors found that Madrid was the dog-fouling capital of Europe , with canines defecating &quot; anywhere and everywhere. &quot; But Madrid won the honors for the cleanest railroad_station area . And Athens ( Greece currently holds the presidency of the European Union ) was described as a grim , polluted city with a &quot; virtual plague of cigarette butts. &quot; The Greeks are listed as the world ' s heaviest smokers after Cubans . Curiously , despite its reputation for litter , Athens is one of the few capitals to have daily trash_collection . But dog-ownership in the Greek_capital has become fashionable , and the streets are increasingly fouled . As an Athens official admitted : &quot; Unlike Britain , we ' ve never had an anti-litter campaign . It ' s a sad fact that Greeks are simply not as environmentally aware or as litter-trained as their European counterparts. &quot; Asked whether the Tidy Britain Group was impartial , Allen insisted : &quot; Two years ago , our survey showed Berne in first place . I don ' t believe the study is biased . London , by comparison , is really clean. &quot;</TEXT>
