   <HEADLINE> RESTAURANT REVIEW ; SEARING THAI TREATS ; THE EXOTIC MAKES THE MOST OF CLASSICS -- FROM COCONUT MILK-BASED SOUPS TO SEAFOOD DISHES AND FRIED RICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thailand is nicknamed &quot; Land of Smiles , &quot; and smiles -- of various sorts -- come naturally at Exotic Thai Restau rant . When I was ordering pad se-eau , a terrific fried noodle dish that comes_with a choice of meats , I had the temerity to ask the waitress to bring mine with mu ( Thai for &quot; pork &quot; ) . Sensing my attempt at her language , she replied , with a jokey smirk , &quot; that ' s what cows say in English. &quot; ( Naturally , like the American smart guy I am , I countered , &quot; So what do Thai cows say ? Oink ? &quot; We got_it with pork. ) Although the waitresses in this personable Burbank restaurant smile and joke freely when you pose questions about dishes , they ' re not necessarily forthcoming with descriptions or recommendations , despite their generally fluent English . In the Land of Smiles tradition , service is diplomatic and noncommittal , so remember , you ' re going to be pretty much on_your_own . Exotic Thai Cuisine ' s menu employs words such_as &quot; veggie &quot; and &quot; exotic &quot; to describe classic Thai dishes , but whoever is working_at the range doesn ' t compromise a whole_lot in the way of taste . What I like best about this restaurant is the fact that the kitchen respects a request for hearty spicing , unlike the cooks at the typical suburban Thai restaurant , who are afraid to turn_up the heat . Larb , a ground chicken dish eaten with chiles , onions and lime_juice , is billed as Eastern Thai Treat , and it ' s not for beginners . It burns your tongue and sears your throat and is about as hot a version as you can find in Los Angeles . There ' s an equally hot dish called naem sod , which the menu refers to as Northern Thai Treat . This dish treats pork to a healthy dose of ginger , chiles and sliced onion . For those who don ' t feel up_to either of those , Thai egg_rolls ( poh pia ) are good mild starters . Exotic Thai Cuisine ' s version has a dense vegetable stuffing that gives them a satisfying heaviness , in place of the usual egg_roll stuffing of glass noodles and minced pork . Dip them in the sweet , sticky sauce and eat them with the cucumber relish . They ' re habit-forming . Exotic Thai Cuisine doesn ' t mess much with the traditional Thai soups . Tom kha kai is a wonderful creamy version of the coconut-milk based classic , with chicken , cabbage and a touch of galanga root . A warning , though : In Thai restaurants , soups are served in huge chafing_dishes , resulting in portions that seem excessive in the case of rich soups like this one . Tom yum goong makes more sense in the tureen , because it is essentially a clear broth , distinctively edged with the flavor of lemon grass and chock full of large shrimp . * From there , you ' ll want to move_on to warm salads , which Thai chefs were doing generations before California cuisine . ( But ask the waitresses to separate the courses , or chances are you will get your soups , salads and appetizers all at the same time. ) One of my favorite dishes here is spinach duck salad , thanks to the finely chopped topping of duck that has been lightly coated with honey and fried crisp . Thai beef salad , or yum nuea , is generous with the grilled beef ( the kitchen coats with hot_pepper upon request ) . Naked shrimp salad consists_of marinated grilled shrimp in a lime sauce with celery , onions , lemon grass and wilted romaine . I don ' t much care_for the restaurant ' s traditional Thai curries , which are rather oily and leave a strong aftertaste . The most popular one is probably the one they call Thai curry , consisting mostly of reduced coconut_milk , bamboo_shoots and chile paste . But I certainly fancy the restaurant ' s spice-coated golden barbecued chicken ( half a chicken to an order ) , and I positively crave the seafood dish called shrimp cake , which is four crisply fried disks you eat with a peanut-and-cucumber relish . If you have room , the restaurant proposes interesting alternatives to white_rice , many of which remind me of dishes I have stumbled on accidentally in Asia . Khao pad , called Exotic Fried Rice on this menu , includes shrimp , Chinese sausage , tomato , onion , eggs and a grainy curry_powder . It is very exotic . The familiar Thai staple pad woon sen are clear , gossamer thin threads fashioned out of mung_bean , which are then mixed_up with similar components and fried . Let us also not forget that delicious pad se-eau , flat rice noodles similar to Chinese chow fun . Exotic Thai Cuisine dry-sautes these tempting noodles with broccoli , garlic , egg and a choice of either shrimp , chicken , beef or pork -- the aforementioned mu .
