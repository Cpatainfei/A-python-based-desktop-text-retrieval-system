   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES ; COMMENTARY ON MULTICULTURALISM ; XENOPHOBIC FEARS ABOUT A ' NONWHITE MAJORITY ' ARE NONSENSE ; THE WEALTH OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY THAT IMMIGRATION BRINGS SHOULD BE CELEBRATED RATHER THAN DREADED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For some reason Gov . Wilson feels compelled to keep assuring us all ( in his election night victory speech and more recently at the Heritage Foundation in Washington ) that Proposition 187 had nothing to do with racism . I guess he missed Pat Buchanan ' s recent rhetoric : &quot; A nonwhite majority is envisioned if today ' s immigration continues. &quot; that ' s a very interesting statement . You might stop reading here and reflect a moment about how you feel about the comment . Really , stop reading now until you ' ve decided how you feel about &quot; . . . a nonwhite majority. &quot; If your reaction to Buchanan ' s prediction is , &quot; So what ? &quot; then you ' re a fair-minded person . If your reaction is joy , perhaps you ' re currently a so-called &quot; minority &quot; gloating over your anticipated new political power . Or , you might be happy in a good way , celebrating the wealth of the cultural diversity that Buchanan foretells . Unfortunately , some of you are reacting in the way Buchanan intended , with fear and dread . If these last are the feelings Buchanan ' s prediction evokes , you need to go_to the nearest mirror , look yourself in the eye , and say aloud , &quot; racist. &quot; These fears that Buchanan and some others appealed_to during the Proposition 187 debate hark_back to the Orange County , California , of 1919 . Back then , in rural Orange County , the Farm Bureau ( the equivalent of the Chamber_of_Commerce in urban America ) passed a resolution that in part said , &quot; WHEREAS , the Japanese population in California is increasing rapidly and WHEREAS , these people will always remain in our midst an alien element unassimilated and unassimilable , and WHEREAS , their presence here lays the foundation for a race_problem more serious than any that ever confronted us and may lead to armed conflict . . . RESOLVED , by the directors of the Orange County Farm Bureau , that our senators , Hiram W . Johnson and James D . Phelan , and our representative William Kittner . . . be asked to use their best and utmost endeavors in favor of the following propositions , to wit : . . . rigorous exclusion of Japanese as immigrants . . . that Japanese shall forever be barred from American citizenship. &quot; The Congress back in the 1920s did pass laws that severely restricted Japanese immigration . Yet consider how wrong the Farm Bureau directors were . The Orange County of today counts among its prominent citizens many people of Japanese ancestry . We even have street names like &quot; Sakioka Drive &quot; and &quot; Yamaha Way. &quot; A 10-year-old named Casey Okuma recently very well represented Irvine in the national Pitch , Hit and Run competition in Arlington , Tex . At UC Irvine , consider the most common surname among our students , &quot; Nguyen. &quot; Indeed , are the sons and daughters of the most recent wave of Asian immigration , the Vietnam_War refugees , &quot; unassimilable ? &quot; Apparently not , judging by their marks in the classes I teach . In fact , I do not find it a problem to be working_on a campus with a &quot; nonwhite majority &quot; of students . The diversity of cultures among our students enriches the campus experience for all_of us . Yes , it ' s not always easy . We do have conflicts among different groups . However , ideas are put_up on the table for discussion that might not otherwise be in a more homogeneous environment . And that ' s where the creativity comes_in American society . Indeed , one of Orange County ' s most prominent companies , AST Research , was founded only 15 years ago by three Asian immigrants . What is a &quot; nonwhite majority &quot; anyway ? Buchanan and the others simply lump together those of Asian , African and Latin_American heritage into a threatening majority . But just ask an Asian American or an African American if he or she feels_like part of some powerful majority in Los Angeles , where Anglo Americans are a minority now . Indeed , it really is kind of stupid to lump together Asians , for example . They don ' t do_it . The Japanese culture is quite different from the Korean or Chinese or Vietnamese . Certainly these folks of Asian heritage have had their own conflicts historically , although not so_much here in the states . Likewise , how about Hispanics ? How different are the views and lifestyles of immigrants from Mexico , Cuba , Argentina and Spain ? And how do you count someone who has emigrated from the Dominican_Republic , perhaps a fellow with African ancestry that speaks Spanish as his first_language . The concept of a nonwhite majority is really nonsense , a hateful nonsense created by bigots . How should I count myself ? My surname is Scottish . My dad hopped a ride_on a freight_car in 1935 to &quot; emigrate &quot; from Nebraska to San Francisco . There he met my mother , a fifth-generation Californian . Her ancestor , Pedro Amador , had arrived in the Bay Area with the Portola expedition in 1769 and stayed . My great aunt on my mother ' s side can remember her grandfather telling her how &quot; those damned Americans &quot; flooded into Alta California , then part of Mexico , and wrested away the land from his parents . Of course , Native_Americans have a similar disdain for my Spanish ancestors as did my Mexican ancestors for the &quot; invading &quot; Americans of the 1840s . I speak little Spanish , but because of my ancestry I can be officially classified as a Hispanic . What am I , Mr. Buchanan ? That brings us to the &quot; The Bell Curve , &quot; the highly controversial new book . Is it racism or just realistic statistics , the cold , ugly facts of life ? The authors say they see a clear relationship between IQ and race . The current debate often regards the reliability and validity of IQ testing , most agreeing that the tests are useful . Everyone seems to ignore the definitions of race and ethnicity . The statistical relationships Murray and Hernstein report have meaning only ( if then ) when we have a clear definition of race . And those definitions are blurring . Ultraconservatives like Mr. Buchanan often decry affirmative_action and argue that we should simply ignore race and ethnicity . Treat everyone the same . I couldn ' t agree more if they would just practice what they preach . But instead , he and his ilk worry about a &quot; nonwhite majority America. &quot; Affirmative_action exists only in response to such bigotry . Mr. Buchanan argues we need a &quot; timeout &quot; from immigration . I ' ve got a better idea . What would America look_like in 2050 if we took a timeout , a permanent one , from xenophobia and bigotry ? Instead of lamenting our differences in_color , language and culture , we instead celebrated our diversity , taking full advantage of the consequent creativity and cosmopolitanism within our own borders . Meat and potatoes makes_for a boring being . Once in a while I prefer some salsa , Szechwan , even some sushi .</TEXT>
