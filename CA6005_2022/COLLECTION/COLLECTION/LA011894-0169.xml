   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : DISASTER BEFORE DAWN ; CITY POWER SUFFERS A PRE-DAWN PUNCH ; UTILITIES : WATER , ELECTRICITY AND GAS_SERVICES ARE HIT HARD BY TEMBLOR . AFTERSHOCKS COULD CAUSE NEW PROBLEMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The lifelines of water , electricity and natural_gas that keep the sprawling Los Angeles metropolis working suffered some serious fractures Monday , most spectacularly shown in a fire at a cracked underground gas_line in the northern San Fernando Valley and breaks_in the two main aqueducts carrying water from Northern California . Hundreds of thousands of area households were still without gas , power or water by Monday evening and authorities said it could take several days for full service to be restored . Residents of the Valley and neighborhoods north of Sunset Boulevard and west of Western Avenue were being warned to boil water before drinking in case of contamination through pipe cracks . Officials were unable to estimate the damage in dollars to crucial infrastructure , but they expressed relief that the vast networks of pipes and transmission stations were not devastated even more . For the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , the most worrisome damage was at an electrical_converter station on Sepulveda Boulevard in Sylmar that receives power from hydroelectric plants in the Pacific Northwest and distributes it into local grids . &quot; that ' s a major , major loss , &quot; said DWP spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen . Also , several transmission towers bringing power into the San Fernando Valley from a generating facility at Castaic Lake were damaged , she added . Because of the interdependence of Western power_grids , brief power outages caused by the quake were reported as far north as Portland and Seattle . Much of the Los Angeles area lost electricity in the quake , and about 520 # 000 of the DWP ' s 1.4 million customers had not had their power restored by nightfall , officials said . In areas outside of the city of Los Angeles , Southern California Edison had restored power to all but 150 # 000 homes and businesses by late afternoon -- and hoped to whittle that number down to 50 # 000 by nightfall . The DWP had no count of how many households and businesses had lost water service , but the agency warned that wide swaths of the western San Fernando Valley might have low_pressure or no water at all for days . The water service problems are mainly caused by electrical outages that cripple pumping stations , said DWP official Jan Merlo . &quot; At this point , it ' s very difficult to say what the power situation is , so we are asking people to conserve water , &quot; she said . The older of the two aqueducts bringing water from the Owens Valley broke_in an area south of Soledad Canyon near Santa Clarita . Water flow was shifted to the second aqueduct , which was later shut_down after a crack was discovered in a section north of Sylmar . Repairs on both concrete tubes -- 90 inches and 72 inches in diameter -- were said to be under way . Authorities were not calling it an emergency because water_supplies were said to be plentiful in a dozen area reservoirs . There were no reports of major damage at area reservoirs or dams . But a major trunk_line out of the Los Angeles reservoir complex in the Sylmar area sprung a five-foot-long leak and a filtration plant in that area was damaged , causing service problems in Simi Valley , Ventura County and the city of Los Angeles , according to the Southern California Metropolitan Water District , the regional water wholesaler . The main gas problems involved breaks_in four high-pressure transmission pipelines in the San Fernando Valley , including one that erupted into flames on Balboa Boulevard in Northridge , destroying two nearby structures . Those four breaks were later controlled through shut-off valves and transmissions were rerouted , said Rich Nemec , a spokesman for the Southern California Gas Co . An estimated 150 gas distribution lines and individual service lines ruptured , contributing to fires in some cases . All those breaks were reportedly under_control by noon . By Monday night , Nemec said , about 18 # 000 of the 4.7 million customers of Southern California Gas remained without service , a situation that may continue for several days . &quot; We feel pretty good in the way our own facilities have held_up , &quot; he said . However , Thomas O ' Rourke , a Cornell University expert on the effects of quakes on pipelines , said many_more gas and water_lines may have fractured than originally known , with further fires possible over the next few days . He said that the rupture of a water_line under Balboa Boulevard may have caused underground erosion , undermining the nearby 22-inch gas_line that burst into flames Monday .</TEXT>
