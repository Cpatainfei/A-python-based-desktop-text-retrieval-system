   <HEADLINE> SOUTH BAY COVER STORY ; DANGEROUS GROUND ; AS EPA HUNTS FOR SOURCE OF MAJOR DDT CONTAMINATION , RESIDENTS WORRY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At first , federal_officials spoke cautiously about the white chunks unearthed in a South Bay back yard . This mysterious material , they said , could be something as harmless as construction debris . But just to make_sure , they shipped a_few clumps to a laboratory for testing . And on the May morning after the results came_back , the white chunks were suddenly a hot news_story . Television vans jammed the alley leading to the excavation site . Reporters took turns holding_up a vial of the material as cameras zoomed_in . It was a startling find : DDT in virtually solid form had been dug from the yard of an unsuspecting West 204th Street couple , and no one -- not the residents , not their neighbors , not even the experts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency -- could say where it came from . &quot; It ' s scary . Stuff like this should not be happening . This is the 20th Century , &quot; said Robin Hatch , 30 , a mother of two who lives only three doors from where the DDT was found . What makes this environmental tale so riveting is that it defies an easy explanation . Chunks of DDT as big as bowling_balls simply are not supposed to be buried in yards where one resident grew tomatoes and another held family barbecues . In a society that has grown ever more wary of pesticides -- even to_the_point of diligently scrubbing its organic vegetables -- the back-yard discovery on West 204th Street seems like an American nightmare . EPA officials say they have no evidence that the chunks came from a DDT factory once located nearby . Yet the drama is a disconcerting reminder that DDT ' s legacy looms large in the South Bay . For years , federal_officials and consultants have been quietly measuring the DDT content of neighborhood soil , attic dust , ground_water , storm drains , and even crabs and fish . Their mission : to analyze the effects of the DDT manufacturing_plant operated by Montrose Chemical Corp . from 1947 to 1982 on Normandie Avenue , just east of Torrance in the Harbor Gateway neighborhood of Los Angeles . The task resembles some long but engrossing detective novel , with numerous plot twists and many chapters still unwritten . It illustrates the Gargantuan job that government_agencies , companies and residents confront as they try to identify and clean_up industrial pollution . * Montrose became one of the world ' s leading DDT producers in an era when the white powder was hailed as a magic potion . But as Americans ' enthusiasm for the pesticide cooled , Montrose ' s fortunes faltered . Today , the former factory site is one of 1 # 200 on the federal Superfund list of the most hazardous toxic-waste sites in the United States . Its impact has been felt far beyond the 13-acre site , now a vacant_lot . Thousands of pounds of DDT are trapped in sediment inside a local sewer_line , and still more pollutes water underground . Health experts emphasize that although DDT is a suspected carcinogen and , in large doses , can affect the human nervous_system , most deposits detected around the Montrose site are too small to threaten human health . Besides , there are only a_few routes by which residents could be exposed to the DDT , health officials say . Contaminated soil could be eaten by children . Adults could consume home-grown produce sprinkled with tainted soil or eat DDT-laden eggs laid by back-yard chickens . People could ingest attic dust , which experts say is unlikely . Or they could eat DDT-contaminated fish , which is one reason the state recommends against eating white_croaker caught at places such_as White ' s Point and Los Angeles Harbor . Government experts say they have no evidence that such exposure has caused health_problems in the area . Still , some residents wonder if the pesticide could be the source of the rashes , nausea , dizziness and aching joints that they say are prevalent in the West 204th Street neighborhood . The outpouring of public concern in recent weeks has lent new urgency to the ongoing federal studies of how DDT affected the South Bay environment . Montrose ' s neighbors say they just want the government to hurry in its cleanup efforts . &quot; It ' s not just hurting human_beings . It ' s hurting our planet , &quot; said Hatch . &quot; I want them to have whoever is responsible to clean it up. &quot; The goal of the 14-year-old federal Superfund program is supposed to be exactly that : to pinpoint which companies polluted a site and require them to investigate and , as much as possible , finance the cleanup . At Montrose , the scope of that project is enormous . To date , Montrose and its insurance_companies have spent at least $ 17 million for studies and initial remediation , and that ' s only the beginning . A Montrose study estimates that cleanup costs for ground_water alone could range from $ 30 million to $ 359 million . And although the Montrose site was first proposed as a Superfund candidate in 1984 , an overall cleanup plan has yet to begin or even be announced . Montrose says it broke no laws and notes that industrial practices changed_over the past several decades . Throughout , the firm did its best to operate within industry norms and follow legal requirements , said attorney Karl S . Lytz of Latham &amp; Watkins , a law_firm representing Montrose . Meanwhile , despite years of costly studies and legal haggling , no one can say when the South Bay ' s DDT inheritance will be cleaned_up for good . * In the old days , some people talked_about DDT with the reverence usually reserved for penicillin . After all , DDT was the chemical that saved millions of lives by curbing insect-borne diseases such_as yellow_fever and malaria . It preserved farmers ' crops by killing foraging bugs . The Swiss scientist who discovered DDT ' s pesticide potential in 1939 would later win a Nobel Prize . People barely noticed when the Montrose factory opened soon after World_War_II . One man who worked there briefly in the late 1940s says that newly mixed DDT was poured into a large , shallow tub . Then he would climb atop the hardened DDT , chopping it with a hoe-like tool into transportable pieces . Unlike the respirator-wearing cleanup crew on West 204th Street , the man saw no reason to don a mask or protective clothing . &quot; In those days , DDT was the big thing . It killed bugs . It was great , &quot; recalled the man , who said he worked_at Montrose for only a_few months and does not think he incurred health_problems . He did not want to be identified . DDT ' s downfall was its tenacity -- it stays in the soil for decades -- and its tendency to travel through the food_chain , building_up in the fat of animals that eat DDT-contaminated food . Scientists discovered birds laying eggs with shells so fragile that they shattered before hatching , and they blamed DDT . Even after DDT was banned for most uses in the United States in 1972 , Montrose continued making_it for export to Africa , India and elsewhere . By the late 1970s , the South Bay plant was the only American DDT plant still operating . It finally shut_down in June , 1982 , and the building was torn_down soon after . Yet the environmental drama was just beginning . Investigators concluded that rainwater had carried some DDT from the plant into the storm drains . Montrose installed an asphalt cap over much of the property , and testing continued . The site officially attained Superfund status in 1989 . By then , monitoring wells had detected ground_water tainted with monochlorobenzene , a chemical used in DDT manufacturing that can cause liver and kidney damage . The testing went_on , unnoticed by many residents living nearby . Then the trouble started on West 204th Street , and DDT again became a household word in the South Bay . * It was almost by happenstance that DDT was spotted in the back-yard soil . The EPA was screening soil from 14 yards along West 204th Street to make_sure it was not tainted by chemicals from the proposed Del Amo Superfund site to the north , where a synthetic_rubber factory once operated . With Montrose in mind , an agency official decided to add a test for DDT . When the tests came_back last winter , Del Amo chemicals were barely detectable -- but DDT showed_up in samples from two back yards on the street ' s north_side . More tests , taken beneath the surface in the two yards , found the pesticide at 45 times the level considered safe . Frightened residents formed a committee and fought successfully to have 25 families temporarily moved to hotels while federal crews removed toxic soil and took it to a hazardous waste landfill in Nevada . Cleanup was supposed to take only two weeks , but a glitch developed May 6 when workers uncovered the first of the DDT chunks . In response , EPA officials agreed two weeks ago to keep residents in temporary housing for up_to six months during an investigation . The DDT deposits appear to be scattered in fill soil that goes as deep as seven feet in one back yard . Investigators now hope to trace where the fill came from -- and determine if it extends under homes to the east of the two excavated yards . That probe , which could last through the summer , will help decide how much cleanup is needed and if residents should be permanently relocated . That would be an unusual step -- taken only once in EPA ' s four-state Western region -- but one that the agency has promised to study . &quot; We don ' t necessarily think there ' s an acute health risk out there , &quot; said Nancy Lindsay , chief of the Superfund enforcement branch for the EPA regional office in San Francisco . Although residents can choose to return to West 204th Street during the investigation , gardening or even allowing children to play in their own back yards is not advised . Nearly four weeks after the discovery of the first DDT chunks , the EPA says it is still perplexed about how they got there . Montrose ' s attorney says he is not aware that the DDT came from Montrose . &quot; We have no idea of where the material came from , &quot; attorney Lytz said . Because of the uncertainty , the federal_government is not charging Montrose for the back-yard cleanup . The cost to date : more_than $ 500 # 000 . For one week in April , a team of investigators in jeans and coveralls followed a serpentine route of drains across the South Bay , taking samples . They clambered aboard a boat to traverse the Dominguez Channel , gathering water , sediment , crabs and fish to test them for pesticide . Their work marked the start of the first major EPA study of whether DDT remains in the storm drains . That project is just one part of an overall Superfund study . &quot; We ' re trying to track all_the possible avenues in which the contamination could be transported away , &quot; said Nancy Woo , EPA ' s Montrose project manager . The effort includes : * Neighborhood soil . Low levels of DDT were found in some yards and in dust in some attics in the 1980s . Because of the discovery on 204th Street and new , more stringent EPA standards , the agency has ordered more wide-ranging tests . Starting later this year , surface_soil samples will be taken from the yards of 100 to 300 homes_in two areas near Montrose : the north and south_sides of West 204th Street between Normandie and New Hampshire avenues , and in a neighborhood farther west between Western Avenue , Del Amo Boulevard , Denker Avenue and West 205th Street . Dust may be tested in the attics of some homes . * Sewer_lines . The EPA has studied the sanitary sewer_system because Montrose discharged waste water containing DDT into the system between 1953 and 1970 . Tons of DDT are believed to have flowed into the Pacific_Ocean through sewer outfalls off the Palos Verdes Peninsula . Today , as much as 20 square_miles of the sea floor are contaminated with DDT , which many scientists blame for damaging marine and bird life . Montrose ' s attorney disputes claims that most of the offshore DDT came from its factory , saying that DDT was widely used in the Los Angeles area . ( The federal_government initiated an ocean pollution lawsuit against Montrose and other companies in 1990 . A trial is not expected until the late 1990s . One facet of the complex case was settled in 1992 when a long list of cities and special districts -- said by companies to have released toxic substances themselves -- agreed to help pay to restore coastal waters. ) As much as 21 tons of DDT are believed to be lodged within a tar-like substance inside one sewer_line under Normandie Avenue . When a new sewer_line is completed later this year , cleanup crews are scheduled to remove the DDT-laden sediment . * Ground_water . The discovery of contaminated water underground is provoking deep concern among EPA experts . Montrose placed liquids such_as monochlorobenzene in a large unlined pit from 1947 to 1970 . Such pits were common practice , and Montrose is not known to have broken laws at the time , Woo said . Contamination has seeped into two subterranean layers that contain ground_water not used for drinking . A monitoring well has detected monochlorobenzene in a deeper ground-water layer that does supply drinking_water , but that spot is more_than two miles away from a drinking-water intake , Woo said . Complicating the cleanup plan is that DDT , which does not dissolve easily in water , does dissolve in the solvent monochlorobenzene . A mixture of DDT and the solvent is lodged_in the uppermost ground-water layers . The mixture moves extremely slowly through the porous layers , much as molasses might move through a sponge . The substance poses a dilemma because there is no technology capable of removing it , officials say . So scientists are studying whether to leave it in place , ringed by wells to prevent it from traveling underground . Meanwhile , a so-called pump-and-treat system may be used to remove monochlorobenzene from other tainted ground_water areas . The process is painstakingly slow . &quot; Think_about how long it would take you to clean_up ( an ) oil rag just by dipping it in water , &quot; Woo said . And , she added , suppose the rag cannot be cleaned with soap or wrung_out . The tainted ground_water is found so deep that cleanup crews cannot reach it with excavation equipment . Instead , the dirty water is extracted through a well , treated to remove contaminants and pumped back underground . Studies show the process could take 30 to 60 years . * For many neighbors , an underground soup of monochlorobenzene and talk_of 60-year timelines are simply too colossal to dwell upon . Much more immediate -- and more alarming -- are the white chunks of DDT . For many , that simple image has poisoned the sense of security that once characterized their neighborhood . Now they worry less about cleanup schemes than about how to avoid returning to West 204th Street . Dunia Ponce can vividly describe the small home she left_behind in April when she was relocated to a Torrance hotel . She bought the two-bedroom house three years ago for $ 155 # 000 , remodeled the bathroom and added a driveway . She ate home-grown vegetables and nectarines from her garden before she learned from a television_news crew this spring about DDT contamination across the street . Now she feels_like a fool for having ever bought the house . &quot; I worked very hard to buy my American_dream , &quot; said Ponce , 33 , a registered nurse . &quot; I know it ' s not a mansion , a palace . But it ' s everything to me. &quot; Like many of her neighbors , she thinks the EPA should seriously consider buying_up homes and moving the residents out for good . &quot; that ' s the only honorable thing for the government to do , &quot; she said . DDT Found High levels of DDT have been detected in the soil behind two homes on the north_side of West 204th Street , prompting a federal cleanup and the temporary relocation of about 90 residents from the street between Budlong Avenue and Catalina Street . The source of the DDt remains unknown , but its discovery has reawakened neighbors ' concerns about Montrose Chemical Corp. , a former DDT manufacturer once located nearby on Normandie Avenue .</TEXT>
