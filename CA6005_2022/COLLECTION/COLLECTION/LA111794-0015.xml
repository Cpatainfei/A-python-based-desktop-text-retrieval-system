   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION ; IRAN IS RIPE FOR A PEACEFUL OVERTURE ; RATHER THAN WAIT FOR A CRISIS , AS WITH KOREA , THE U.S. SHOULD TRY NOW TO INFLUENCE TEHRAN ' S SUSPICIOUS AMBITIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The standoff and subsequent agreement between the United States and North_Korea is a vivid reminder that procrastination is dangerous and expensive when dealing with would-be nuclear regimes . The world had suspected for a decade that the dictatorship of Kim IlSung was secretly developing the capacity to build a nuclear_weapon . But only after the evidence became overwhelming , and the possession of such weapons a real threat , did the United States and others begin to develop a serious response . The most prominent candidate for the next proliferation crisis is Iran . But , because Iran ' s nuclear program is still extremely small and U.S. leverage is at its peak , there is a good chance of averting a full-blown crisis -- if the U.S._government acts now , with the same determination that was shown in the talks with North_Korea . When Assistant Secretary_of_State Robert Gallucci sat_down with the North_Korean negotiator , he had only a_few cards to play . North_Korea probably already had the makings of one or more bombs , and its conventional military threat to South_Korea made coercion an excessively risky and probably unworkable option . In the end , Gallucci got_the_best deal he could . Rather than quibble about the terms , we should profit from the experience so we have a better hand to play the next time . Iran is actively seeking nuclear-related equipment from many sources . Iran has a small research reactor that it purchased from the United States more_than 20 years ago . Last year , Iran signed contracts with China and Russia for three nuclear_power stations . Iran also attempted to acquire more dangerous research reactors from Argentina and China , but the United States intervened to squelch both deals . Iran is a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , and a thorough inspection of its known nuclear facilities last April resulted in a clean bill_of_health by the International Atomic Energy Agency . Iran ' s government flatly denies the existence of any nuclear_weapons program , claiming that its interests are purely peaceful and oriented toward nuclear_power production . This does not ring true . Iran ' s reserves of natural_gas are sufficient to meet its domestic power needs for centuries . President Hashemi Rafsanjani , in his periodic reviews of Iran ' s energy policies , has never referred to plans for domestic nuclear_power generation . The world is right to treat Iran ' s behavior with suspicion . But Iran is not North_Korea . There is time to develop an effective strategy before Iran ' s nuclear program gets_to the crisis stage . Exactly how much time is hard to say . Although the CIA estimates that Iran could have a nuclear_weapon within eight to 10 years , the nuclear_power reactors that Iran is purchasing from Russia and China will take at least eight years to build , and they will not produce any irradiated nuclear fuel until after about 10 years ' operation , if ever . In fact , these light-water nuclear plants are roughly comparable_to those being offered cost-free to North_Korea in return for its agreement to give_up its current graphite reactor technology . Nevertheless , after the sobering experience with North_Korea and Iraq , Iranian intentions are in themselves grounds for concern by regional and external powers alike . Even if Iran is ultimately unsuccessful in building a nuclear_weapon , the mere act of trying could trigger fears and possible counteractions in the region . What can be done to deflect Iran from the nuclear path ? The real lesson of the North_Korean case is that isolation of potential offenders , even when combined with a strict international ban on the sale of nuclear technology , is not sufficient to solve the ultimate problem . Real progress was achieved only after contact was established with the leadership in Pyongyang and Korean security concerns began to be addressed directly . Contact with an estranged regime does not imply approval . It must be based on a cool assessment of U.S. interests and a calculation that those interests are_better served by engagement than by a comfortable , but ostrich-like , detachment . That judgment is particularly difficult in the case of Iran because of the bitter experience of the 1979-81 hostage crisis and the Iran-Contra affair , as well as Iran ' s hostility to the Arab-Israeli peace process and its suspected support of terrorist groups . However , the present U.S. policy of &quot; containment &quot; is not producing positive changes in Iran ' s behavior . Our policy is openly disregarded and privately mocked even by many of our friends in the region , as I learned in a meeting this summer with representatives of Persian_Gulf states . Contrary to prevailing pop analysis and wishful_thinking , our jawboning and obstruction of international development credits for Iran will neither transform nor bring_down the Islamic revolutionary regime . The United States is the dominant power in the Gulf . It need not -- and should not -- make any unilateral concessions to Iran . Present efforts to ban sales of nuclear_weapons technology to Iran should be stringently maintained . At the same time , the Clinton_Administration should name a senior representative , such_as Assistant Secretary_of_State Robert Pelletreau , to undertake discussions with Iran without preconditions . Pelletreau is a seasoned diplomat whose experience with the PLO while he was ambassador to Tunisia showed that he can be tough and discreet . This approach would add a new seriousness of purpose to U.S. expressions of willingness to talk to Iran . Iran complains that its security concerns go unheeded by the West . The naming of a high-level interlocutor would challenge Iran to put those concerns on the table in an authoritative dialogue . The experience with North_Korea demonstrates that direct engagement with a hostile and radical state can sometimes produce unexpected results .</TEXT>
