   <HEADLINE> PROFILE ; DELHI ' S NEW MASTER ; FOR ONLY $ 32 A MONTH , MADAN LAL KHURANA IS TAKING_ON THE CHAOS OF INDIA ' S CAPITAL . WHY IS THIS MAN SMILING ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s 8 p.m. , and a goodly part of the Indian_capital ' s nearly 2 million cars , trucks , scooters , rickshaws and buses are still lurching homeward from one bottleneck to another , horns tooting shrilly . Bony cows amble through dim side streets , pausing to browse in fetid garbage piles . The chilly evening air is heavy with smog that grows so dense that landings and takeoffs from Indira Gandhi International Airport may have to be postponed . Electricity blinks off as demand overwhelms supply . Shanties have sprung_up around the modern telecommunications facilities at Nehru Place , and executives coming_to work must pick their way through slum dwellers ' excrement . Delhi ' s public transportation is so dangerously dicey that more_than 100 people perished last year in bus accidents . The Yamuna river , a stream considered holy by Hindus , is a sewer by the time it flows past Delhi on its way to joining the equally sacred Ganges . The question that comes_to_mind after a survey of the problems of India ' s capital -- &quot; Is anybody in_charge here ? &quot; Meet Madan Lal Khurana , a former high-school economics teacher born in Pakistan and a garrulous lover of badminton and Hindi film romances , who swept last month into the new post of chief minister of this chaotic , troubled metropolis of more_than 10 million souls . It was long a truism of Indian life that &quot; he who rules Delhi , rules India. &quot; And ruling India one day is the dream of Khurana and his party , the Hindu nationalist group called the Bharatiya Janata ( Indian People ' s ) Party . But history also shows that Delhi has often served as the graveyard of the powerful , including the viceroys and sahibs of the now vanished British raj . It is a double-edged lesson for Khurana to ponder as he is ferried about in his Indian-built white Ambassador sedan with chase cars of policemen armed with automatics . For now , he ' s smilingly confident . For taking_on Delhi ' s headaches ( and grabbing a prominent spot on India ' s political scene ) Khurana , 57 , will be paid a base salary of 1 # 000 rupees -- about $ 32 -- a month . He makes no secret of his belief that he can so change things in Delhi that it will prove to Indians at_large that the BJP is fit to govern their dazzlingly diverse country ; that it is not simply a mouthpiece for disgruntled Hindus in the north who feel dispossessed in their own land . &quot; Delhi is a mini-India , &quot; Khurana , charming and raffishly elegant in a Nehru jacket of raw brown silk , declared over plates of sweets during an interview at his Delhi home . &quot; There are people of all religions : Hindus , Muslims , Parsis , Christians , from all states . The majority are from outside Delhi . In Delhi , there is no casteism -- because this is a mini-India , no caste is dominant here. &quot; But for now , Khurana is &quot; chief minister &quot; in name only . The government decision that revived an elective assembly in India ' s capital after a hiatus of 37 years and gave the city a semblance of democratic rule leaves him -- at least for now -- with minimal powers , even less than those enjoyed by the mayor of Washington , D.C. This remains the National_Capital Territory of Delhi , and it is far from having attained true home_rule . &quot; That means the federal_government still governs Delhi , &quot; said Sunderao Narendra , principal officer of the Indian government ' s press information bureau . Lt . Gov . Prasanabhai K . Dave , an appointee of India ' s president , still has full control over policy decisions , law and order , taxes , finance and the budget -- even over whether somebody ' s telephone is to be disconnected . But those who know Khurana and his abundant energy doubt things will remain so simple . A postgraduate student of economics at the University of Allahabad , he was general secretary of India ' s students_union for two years . Zeroing_in on Delhi as a springboard for his political ambitions , he served as a city executive counselor and won election from the capital to two terms in the Lok Sabha , the lower house of India ' s Parliament . Since his victory at the polls in November , Khurana has been to see Prime_Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao , India ' s home minister and top police officials . &quot; They have assured me that in practical purposes , they will obey my orders , &quot; Khurana said . For his part , Dave has publicly reassured Khurana and his six-member Cabinet that he intends to consult them even about matters that legally are under his purview . Nevertheless , the prospects for conflict seem boundless . Since Khurana and his party swept 49 of the 70 seats in Delhi ' s assembly in Nov . 6 elections ( he took_office Dec . 2 ) , he has been going_out of his way to show he isn ' t just another mantra-chanting BJP hothead . He has spoken_of the need to ensure equal respect for all religions and allied himself in particular with Sikh concerns . Within weeks of taking_office , Khurana set_up an advisory panel on how to bring_to justice the instigators of the November , 1984 , riots in Delhi in which more_than 2 # 000 Sikhs were killed . But observers of the Indian political scene say Khurana is hardly all sweetness_and_light . &quot; He ' s a bully , &quot; Hindustan Times columnist Khushwant Singh , a Sikh and one of his country ' s most famous newspapermen , said . In early 1993 , BJP gangs combed South Delhi , Singh recalls , going from house to house hunting for Bangladeshi refugees who are mostly Muslim . Indian Muslim residents were terrified . &quot; It was a sort of an ' ethnic cleansing ' of the area , &quot; Singh said . &quot; They were Khurana ' s gangs , and he went_to the localities with them. &quot; Pressed about his own relations with the more_than 1 million Muslims who dwell in Delhi , the normally effusive Khurana is vague . He won ' t even say whether he will follow a grand tradition of Indian politicos and hold a sumptuous reception at the end of the monthlong Muslim fast of Ramadan . The reason may lie_in his childhood : Like countless Hindu families who lived_in Punjab , the Khuranas fled to India after Punjab was vivisected and Pakistan was created as a separate Muslim state . No one really knows how many Muslims , Hindus and Sikhs died in the bloodshed that accompanied the Indo-Pakistani partition . Unlike many other official Indian offices , Khurana ' s vast chamber at the Old Secretariat in downtown Delhi does not have a portrait of the emaciated and kindly face of Mohandas K . ( Mahatma ) Gandhi , the &quot; Great Soul &quot; of nonviolence and tolerance . Khurana says that ' s simply the way the office was given to him . But Delhi ' s BJP-led assembly provoked a nationwide furor when its Speaker , Charti Lal Goel , said he did not consider Gandhi &quot; the father of the nation. &quot; Hindu militants have long felt that Gandhi , slain in 1948 by a Hindu , was too conciliatory to Muslims . Dubbed &quot; Dilli Ki Awaz &quot; -- the Voice of Delhi -- by admirers , Khurana vows that within a year his will be the most beautiful city in the world . He personally showed_up to whitewash a section of curbstones to kick_off a beautification drive . This month , Khurana says , all schools are to be furnished with drinking_water , clean toilets and a dependable supply of electricity . &quot; I can say that I will give the maximum results , although in some areas I have limited power , &quot; the chief minister promises . Delhi ' s government set_up a public complaint department on its first day of existence . Department_heads are supposed to open their doors to the citizenry each day from noon to 1 p.m. Starting this month , top municipal officials will drive to neighborhoods throughout Delhi ' s 572 square_miles , empowered to solve problems on the spot . Khurana has announced a new tax_system to give middle-class merchants a break and courted the votes of Delhi ' s most disadvantaged by announcing that existing shack cities built_in violation of local codes will be provided with utilities anyway . &quot; He ' s creating ' vote banks ' for himself , &quot; Singh objects . &quot; He ' s going_to be part and parcel of making things worse. &quot; &quot; I can say one thing to the people of Delhi : Next time when we face the people , we will ask them to vote on our performance , &quot; Khurana says . The chief minister ' s most immediate problem looks_like it will be finding enough water for his constituents to drink . He is already at war on this score with the neighboring state of Haryana , which lies upstream on the Yamuna . Haryana , Khurana claims , provided Delhi an extra 50 million gallons of water a day during the summer in an unsuccessful attempt to get Khurana ' s archrivals from the Congress Party elected . When the BJP won instead , Khurana says , Haryana ' s leaders simply turned the tap off .
