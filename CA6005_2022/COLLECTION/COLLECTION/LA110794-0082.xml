   <HEADLINE> REPUBLICANS POISED TO GAIN -- BUT HOW BIG ? ; ELECTION : GOP MAY HAVE BETTER SHOT AT SENATE MAJORITY THAN AT HOUSE CONTROL . DEMOCRATS BRACE FOR SOME LOSSES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the 1994 midterm election heads into its final hours , Republicans are poised to score gains sweeping enough to undermine -- and perhaps overturn -- Democratic command of Capitol_Hill and give the GOP a strong hand in charting the nation ' s political future . This is a campaign Democrats have always known they would lose . And despite apparent last-minute recoveries by some of their candidates , the only question that remains before Tuesday ' s balloting begins is how large the loss will be . Interviews with strategists in both parties indicate that Republicans have at least a 50-50 chance of seizing control of the Senate , where Democrats now enjoy a 56-44 advantage . The GOP is expected to pick_up no fewer than four seats and perhaps as_many as nine . On the House side , the odds are longer against the Republicans ousting the long-entrenched Democratic majority , but the possibility cannot be ruled_out . In any case , the Republicans are expected to add at least 25 seats to their current holding of 178 -- against 256 for the Democrats . This would put Republican House strength above the 200 figure for the first time since they briefly controlled that chamber in the first two years of Dwight D . Eisenhower ' s presidency . &quot; I think we ' re going to retain actual control of both the House and Senate , and lose effective control of both , &quot; was Democratic pollster Mark Mellman ' s gloomy assessment . Republican House and Senate gains on the scale predicted by analysts in both parties would have powerful long-range implications . They would leave the GOP better positioned than at any time in recent memory to take command of both houses of Congress -- as well as the presidency -- in 1996 . In the contests for governorships , late polling results suggest Republicans still have a plausible chance of winning in several major states now held by Democrats , although GOP chances of wresting New York away seemed to be slipping . And Republicans are confident of holding_on to the richest prize of all , California . Fueling the Republican surge is a flood of voter discontent verging on outrage -- along with the unsettling effect on incumbents of the decennial redistricting and a flock of Democratic retirements . The latest evidence was provided by a New York Times / CBS News poll released last week that showed only about 20 % of those surveyed approved of the job Congress is doing . And only that same small share of the sample said they believed that they could trust the government in Washington most of the time . &quot; Voters are frustrated with government , &quot; said the Democratic Party ' s senior campaign strategist , Tony Coelho , himself a former member of the House . &quot; They think they pay too_much and get too_little back. &quot; But Tuesday ' s anticipated results seem likely to produce even more frustration among the citizenry . The outlook is for heightened partisan warfare in Washington , where Republicans under Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and House Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia were feisty enough during the last congressional session to impede major initiatives by President Clinton . The President ' s worst nightmare has to be a Republican-controlled Senate , which would put Dole in_charge of the flow of business and would install other Republicans as chairmen of Senate committees . &quot; If I ' m in the Clinton White_House , my immediate worry is that ( New York Sen. ) Alfonse D ' Amato is head of the Senate Banking Committee , &quot; said Republican consultant Anthony Fabrizio . One of the Senate ' s most aggressive critics of the Whitewater affair , D ' Amato would be expected to push for a further probe into the events stemming from Clinton ' s Arkansas real_estate investment and its connection to a failed savings and loan . Even without a majority , Republicans in the 104th Congress will likely be well-positioned to challenge the President ' s ability to dominate the national political scene . &quot; I think we will be able to control the political debate , &quot; said Republican pollster William McInturff . He said he envisages the enlarged GOP cadre on Capitol_Hill teaming_up with conservative Democrats to form a &quot; center-right coalition. &quot; This alliance , McInturff theorizes , could force Clinton to choose between compromising with the conservatives -- thus weakening his hold_on his party ' s liberal base -- or vetoing legislation , which the Republicans could exploit to energize their 1996 drive for the White_House . &quot; Imagine the world where Republicans who voted for term limits , a balanced-budget amendment and cuts_in congressional staff could wrap themselves in that package and go_to the country in 1996 and say : ' We ' re the change , ' &quot; McInturff said . &quot; It will be very difficult for Clinton to get things done , &quot; said Ross Baker , a Rutgers University specialist in congressional affairs , because the election results are likely to sharpen the schism between the two parties . Baker points_out that the Democratic members of Congress most likely to survive Tuesday ' s Republican onslaught are those from the most liberal districts , thus pushing the Democratic House contingent to the left . But the Republicans , he says , will be at least as conservative as ever , &quot; and in no mood to bargain. &quot; But even in victory , the Republicans will face problems of_their_own . Expanded responsibility is likely to deepen fissures in their party -- exposed most notably when Republican New York Mayor Rudolph W . Giuliani backed the candidacy of Democratic Gov . Mario M . Cuomo , and Los Angeles Republican Mayor Richard Riordan endorsed Democratic Sen . Dianne Feinstein of California . &quot; If Bob Dole becomes majority_leader in the Senate and Newt ( Gingrich ) becomes de_facto leader of a conservative coalition in the House , then our party will have to lead , &quot; Fabrizio said . &quot; But Gingrich ' s goal will be to build a Republican majority in 1996 , and Dole ' s goal will probably be to get himself elected President. &quot; In the face of their grim prospects , Democrats have taken what comfort they can from the belief that an even worse disaster has been averted . They cite the apparent ability of one of the party ' s most revered liberal icons , Massachusetts Sen . Edward M . Kennedy , and a number of lesser known House incumbents to rise out of the political graves dug by their Republican challengers . Some Democrats attributed this modest comeback to the counter-thrust launched by the national party against the Republican &quot; contract with America , &quot; a 10-point Reaganesque agenda for cutting taxes , trimming social programs and beefing_up the military . In a $ 2-million ad_campaign , the Democrats charged that the contract boiled_down to huge tax cuts for the rich , massive new federal budget_deficits and deep cuts_in Medicare and other benefits . &quot; We blunted it and destroyed its credibility , &quot; Coelho said . But Republicans contend that all_the Democratic attention paid to the contract helped them carry_out their strategy of nationalizing the campaign . Some analysts suggest that Clinton deserves some credit for the improvement the Democrats have been able to make in their condition . He hit the campaign trail , hoping to use the prestige he gained from his recent foreign_policy successes to energize loyal Democrats -- whose apathy about this election , party strategists fear , may keep them from the polls . &quot; He revved_up the troops here just as he revved_up the troops in Kuwait , &quot; said Pat Ewing , campaign manager for Sen . Harris Wofford ( D-Pa. ) , who is battling an aggressive Republican challenger . But Republicans scoffed at the idea that Clinton , whom they have made a prime target of_their_own campaigns , could aid any of his party ' s beleaguered candidates . &quot; In Ohio and Pennsylvania , our polls showed he didn ' t move the races at all , &quot; said Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour . &quot; And when he says : ' We ' ve got_to keep going_in the direction we ' ve been going , ' he is telling people just what they don ' t want to hear. &quot; Other analysts attributed the Democratic comeback to the inherent advantages of incumbency , particularly money . A recent Common Cause analysis showed that through Sept . 30 , House members had raised five times as much money as their opponents . &quot; The sheer weight of money wears_down challengers , &quot; McInturff said . These and other factors will help determine the outcome of scores of close races around the country . Here is a brief look_at some of the major contests at the national and state level : The Senate The Democrats started off with huge numerical disadvantages . Of the 35 seats being contested , 22 are held by Democrats , compared with only 13 by Republicans . And six of the Democratic seats are open because of retirement , compared with only three Republican open seats . Republicans claim to be reasonably certain of winning all six of the Democratic open seats -- in Michigan , Oklahoma , Arizona , Tennessee , Maine and Ohio . That means they would need to gain only one more seat to obtain a majority . And they believe that they can do that by toppling at least one of three particularly vulnerable Democratic incumbents : Wofford in Pennsylvania , who faces Rep . Rick Santorum ; Jim Sasser in Tennessee , who is up against political newcomer Bill Frist , a surgeon , and Charles S . Robb in Virginia , who is competing against Iran-Contra figure Oliver L . North . Republicans consider three other Democratic Senate incumbents to be only a bit less vulnerable . New Jersey ' s Frank R . Lautenberg is being hammered because of a last-minute negative ad charging that his Republican foe , Chuck Haytaian , has &quot; racist &quot; support . And California ' s Feinstein has been fighting hard against her Republican challenger , Rep . Mike Huffington ( D-Santa Barbara ) . In New Mexico , Republicans cite late polls that indicate Jeff Bingaman is losing ground to GOP challenger Colin R . McMillan . To hold the Senate , the Democrats probably need to win at least one or two Republican seats . Their best chance may be in Minnesota , where Ann Wynia , a former legislator , is in a close contest with Republican Rod Grams . They also claim to have hopes of unseating Republican incumbents in Washington , where Seattle City Councilman Ron Sims is challenging Sen . Slade Gorton ; and in Vermont , where state Sen . Jan Backus has been gaining_ground on Republican Sen . James M . Jeffords . The House Once again , political arithmetic helps explain why the Democrats are in_trouble . Not only do they have more seats to lose , but of the 52 open seats resulting from retirements and members seeking other offices , 31 are held by Democrats , compared with only 21 for Republicans . What ' s more , a poll by the Times Mirror Center for the People &amp; the Press , based on interviews with nearly 1 # 500 registered voters last Thursday through Saturday , suggests that Republican House candidates would get 52 % of the popular vote to 48 % for Democrats , which would translate into a hefty Republican gain . Still , only one prominent Republican -- New York Rep . Bill Paxon , chairman of the House GOP campaign committee -- is publicly predicting that the party will win the 40 or more seats needed to gain control . His forecast is based on polls that show Republicans are leading or are within the poll ' s margin of error against 37 Democratic incumbents and in 20 open-seat races . Among the incumbents_on Paxon ' s endangered list , and nearly everyone else ' s , is House Speaker Thomas S . Foley of Washington state , struggling to fend_off the challenge of Republican George Nethercutt . Paxon claims no Republican incumbent is behind anywhere in the country . But Democrats dispute Paxon ' s claims and contend that they can score enough victories against Republican incumbents and in open-seat districts to hold the GOP gain to around 30 . One reason Democrats are having difficulty in defeating Republican incumbents at a time when the anti-incumbent feeling is supposedly high is that &quot; there are not many good Democratic challengers , &quot; said Mark Gersh , Washington director of the National Committee for an Effective Congress , a political_action_committee that supports Democratic candidates . And for this , some analysts say , the President is partly to blame . Governors The Democrats are also losing the numbers game here . Of the 36 governorships up for grabs , 21 are now held by Democrats , 14 by Republicans and one , Connecticut , by an independent . The Democratic outlook in the big states has been brightened by the recent gains of New York ' s Cuomo against GOP lawmaker George Pataki , Texas Gov . Ann Richards against former President George_Bush ' s son George W . Bush , and Florida Gov . Lawton Chiles against another Bush son , Jeb . But in all these races , the outcome remains in doubt . Another big state in which Democrats have reason for concern is Pennsylvania , where Lt . Gov . Mark Singel is neck and neck with his Republican challenger , Rep . Tom Ridge . Democrats say their best chances for taking governorships away from Republicans are in Iowa and Maine . Party Shifts The party controlling the White_House has lost ground in every midterm election since 1934 . In the last 40 years , losses in the House during elections falling_in the middle of a President ' s first term have ranged from a low of four seats in 1962 to a high of 26 in 1982 . In the Senate , the changes have ranged from a pickup of four seats in 1962 to a loss of 3 in 1978 .
