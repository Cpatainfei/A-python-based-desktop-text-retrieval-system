The Times Square celebrants watching a 200-pound , bulb-covered ball drop into 1994 -- an event in its 86th year -- were showered with 3 # 000 pounds of confetti from the tops of surrounding buildings as 22 colored spotlights streaked across the square . &quot; Great , I love it ! It ' s better than Paris ! &quot; exclaimed 14-year-old Bo Ehlers , of Copenhagen , Denmark , who accompanied his mother to the New York celebration .
