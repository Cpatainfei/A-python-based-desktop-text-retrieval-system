   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : BURBANK ; DISNEY CARTOON CELS TO BE SOLD AT AUCTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 300 animation cels from classic Walt Disney Studios cartoons as well as some_other rare art -- worth about $ 2 million -- will be put_up for auction Sunday by collector Howard Lowery . &quot; There are some first-rate pieces from a number of very important Disney films , &quot; Lowery said . &quot; But what ' s really unique is some of the works from the more obscure cartoons. &quot; Included in the auction -- which will likely draw many people who come_to watch instead of buy -- are four animated cels by Ub Iwerks , a cartoonist who was the co-creator of Mickey_Mouse with Walt Disney . The works_on auction are from cartoons he produced from an independent studio he ran_for 10 years after he left Disney in the 1930s . &quot; Balloon land , &quot; by Iwerks will be one of the works_on auction , as well as some rare originals from MGM ' s Tom_and_Jerry cartoons from the 1940s . &quot; It ' s wonderful to see the work from some of the smaller studios , &quot; said Lowery , who has been collecting and auctioning cartoon art -- some of it rescued from the trash_can -- for more_than 20 years . He has been holding regular auctions in Burbank since December , 1989 . The auction on Sunday will include animated cels from several Disney movies such_as &quot; Plane Crazy , &quot; from 1928 at a value of about $ 5 # 000 ; &quot; Pinocchio &quot; from 1940 , valued at $ 20 # 000 ; &quot; Fantasia &quot; from 1940 , valued at $ 10 # 000 , and &quot; Bambi &quot; from 1941 , valued at $ 12 # 000 . One of Lowery ' s favorites is a frame of the wicked queen in the 1937 Disney film &quot; Snow White , &quot; which will probably sell for about $ 10 # 000 . It was sold by the studio in the 1940s for about $ 100 , Lowery said . The studio had sold some of its cartoon art through a marketing program between 1939 and 1946 . But much of the art had been thrown_out after the movies were completed . The auction will be from 1 to 5 p.m. Sunday at Burbank Hilton Hotel on Hollywood Way . A preview of the work will be available at Lowery ' s gallery today from 9 a.m. to noon at 3818 W . Magnolia in Burbank . ED BOND</TEXT>
