   <HEADLINE> MIKE PENNER : ANOTHER YARD FOR GUARDIANS OF GRIDIRON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> T his week in the NFL . . . ANAHEIM -- Chris Miller , who cannot remember names , dates , passing plays or poker_hands since sustaining a concussion two weeks ago , will not start at quarterback for the Rams today against the Denver Broncos . Instead , Chuck Knox goes_with Chris Chandler , who can remember sitting on the bench in Indianapolis , Tampa and Phoenix . Rams , at_home , playing a 3-5 opponent that was once 0-4 , are 2 1 / 2-point underdogs . * KANSAS CITY , Mo . -- Big grudge match here as ex-Chief and current Raider tailback Harvey Williams asks himself , &quot; Who ' s laughing loudest now ? &quot; and the Chiefs ask themselves , &quot; Who is Harvey Williams again ? &quot; * ATLANTA -- The Falcons , 5-0 after bye weeks , are dumbfounded by the Chargers ' decision to start Gale Gilbert , whose entire NFL career has been a bye week . The last time Gilbert started and won a football game -- 1984 -- he was a senior at California and the Falcons were quarterbacked by Dave Archer , coached by Dan Henning and led by foreign_exchange field-goal kicker Mick Luckhurst . * PHILADELPHIA -- Buddy Ryan returns to Philadelphia , startled to learn Philadelphia is still standing . Buddy picks_up a tabloid newspaper and finds that the home football_team is 6-2 . The star quarterback , Randall Cunningham , is the same one he benched midway through a 1990 playoff_game , the last game Buddy coached for the Eagles . The star running back , Charlie Garner , is a rookie , a species Buddy usually confines to the practice squad . &quot; They don ' t know what the &amp; ! they ' re doing , &quot; Buddy scoffs as he watches his new quarterback , Steve Beuerlein , hand the ball to Larry Centers_on first , second and third down while the Cardinal punt team warms_up . * TAMPA -- Buccaneers Coach Sam Wyche is concerned about his team ' s emotional well-being as Tampa Bay hosts Chicago in a crucial NFL schedule-filler . Last week , the Baltimore Sun polled readers as_to whether they preferred the Buccaneers or the Rams coming_to town in 1995 -- and the Buccaneers finished last , receiving just 14.5 % of the vote . The Rams got 41.7 % . &quot; No Team , &quot; an inspired choice , topped the poll , drawing 43.8 % . * EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. -- The Jets host the Bills , who last week watched Steve Christie become the most accurate field-goal kicker in NFL history and were disappointed to learn they signed him two Super Bowls too late . * HOUSTON -- The Oilers continue to reel from their ill-fated off-season decision to appease the Bubba faction of their fan base by ridding themselves of effete-sounding , no-good Yankee quarterback Warren and replacing him with Cody , Bucky and Billy Joe . Oilers , who drop to 1-8 after hosting Pittsburgh today , have planned a quarterback tryout camp open_to anyone named Drew , Troy , Stan , Bart , Norm , Otto or Fran . * MILWAUKEE -- The Packers host the Lions in a matchup of bitter NFC Central rivals , since both are 4-4 and one ' s likely to be trailing Minnesota by three games in the standings by day ' s end . If not for the NFL ' s overtime system , the Lions would be 1-4-3 , although Barry Sanders told the Detroit media last week that &quot; We could win the Super Bowl with Wayne ( Fontes ) . &quot; Sanders also said he believes Fontes has the team headed in the right direction . The NFL office immediately fined the Lions for failing to disclose Sanders ' post-concussion syndrome in their Week 10 injury report . * MIAMI -- Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino is expected to move_into second place on the NFL career passing yardage list today , needing 150 yards to surpass Dan Fouts ' total of 43 # 040 , which would keep Marino on pace to break Fran Tarkenton ' s league record of 47 # 003 yards by the middle of the 1995 season . Indianapolis , meanwhile , starts Don Majkowski . * MINNEAPOLIS -- Fully recovered from running back kicks and punts for 347 yards against the Rams -- he had a bye last week -- Tyrone Hughes camps under the football once as the Saints take_on the Vikings at the Metrodome . Last season , after Hughes returned a kick 99 yards to beat the Vikings , 17-14 , Minnesota Coach Dennis Green fired his special teams coach and hired a new one . In Anaheim , Rams special teams coach Wayne Servier remains gainfully employed , with Chuck Knox assuring fans that all problems have been solved , now that David Lang has returned . * SEATTLE -- The Cincinnati Bengals , who start Jeff Blake at quarterback today and had to sign Todd Philcox and Eric Wilhelm earlier in the week because David Klingler and Donald Hollas are hurt , still have no one on their roster qualified to hold the clipboard for Rick Mirer . * WASHINGTON -- Steve Young . And Gus Frerotte . Good_day , from the nation ' s capital . * CLEVELAND -- And , in a related note , Mark Rypien , Redskin Super Bowl hero of January ' 92 , makes his first start of the ' 94 season . He makes_it for Cleveland . He had been backing_up Vinny Testaverde , but Testaverde , the 23rd-rated quarterback in the league , suffered a concussion last Sunday . In living rooms across the country , fathers sit their sons in front of the television , wag a scolding finger and begin to preach , &quot; See , let that be a lesson to you. &quot; * IRVING , Tex . -- It ' s Monday Night Football from Texas Stadium , Giants against the Cowboys , and Giant fans are asked to make a choice . Should it be ( a ) Dave Brown , ( b ) Kent Graham , or ( c ) &quot; The Nanny , &quot; followed by &quot; Dave ' s World &quot; and &quot; Murphy Brown &quot; ?</TEXT>
