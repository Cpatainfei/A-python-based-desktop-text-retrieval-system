   <HEADLINE> NTSB CRASH REPORT CITES INADEQUATE SPACE BETWEEN JETS ; AVIATION : BOARD SAYS SANTA ANA TRAGEDY COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF THE WESTWIND PILOT OR AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS KEPT AN ' ADEQUATE ' CUSHION BEHIND BOEING 757 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stopping short of casting blame , a federal report released in Washington on Thursday suggests that a Dec . 15 fatal plane crash in Santa Ana may have been prevented if the pilot or air-traffic controllers had kept an &quot; adequate &quot; safety cushion between the aircraft and a Boeing 757 jetliner landing ahead of it . The report by the National Transportation Safety Board focused_on the hazards posed by wake turbulence created by 757s and underscored a series of recommendations adopted by the NTSB last month . Although a separate report on the Santa Ana crash will be forthcoming , Thursday ' s document cited the accident a number of times as the NTSB continues to pressure the Federal Aviation Administration to enact changes designed to prevent accidents caused by 757 wake turbulence . The NTSB , which does not have regulatory power , has made 19 safety recommendations involving 757s to the FAA , among them , that the agency lengthen the minimum distances between aircraft_landing behind 757s . NTSB records show that there were 51 instances of aircraft caught in wake turbulence over the last decade , resulting in the deaths of 27 people and damage-destruction of 40 airplanes . The NTSB found that a disproportionate number of incidents -- five since December , 1992 , resulting in 13 deaths -- involved wake turbulence from 757s . The accident in Santa Ana occurred when a twin-engine Westwind corporate jet was_on approach to John Wayne Airport . The jet , which was 2.1 miles behind a 757 , went_out of control and slammed nose-first into the ground near the Santa Ana Auto Mall . All five aboard , including the top two executives of the In-N-Out Burger chain , were killed . In part because of the Santa Ana accident , the NTSB unanimously recommended Feb . 15 that similarly sized corporate jets be kept five miles behind 757s on final approach . The Santa Ana accident remains under investigation by the NTSB , but the report released Thursday provides the first clues as_to what aviation safety officials believe was the cause of the crash and how it might have been prevented . &quot; The only way the pilot of the Westwind could have maintained adequate separation was to execute significant maneuvers , &quot; the report says . Similarly , the report says that &quot; to prevent compromise of the separation requirement , the controller would have had to take positive action to change the Westwind ' s track. &quot; Although the NTSB does not consider the 757 to have any design flaws , researchers have speculated that its unique , sleek-wing design may be the cause of turbulence that is unusually powerful for an aircraft of its size .</TEXT>
