   <HEADLINE> OVERNIGHT CHILD_CARE OFFERS PARENTS MORE FLEXIBILITY ; SERVICES : AS THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES WORKING IRREGULAR HOURS GROWS , MANY ARE TURNING TO SPECIAL-HOURS BABY-SITTERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The day is turning_to evening as 5-year-old Zachary and 3-year-old Jonathan Witherspoon arrive_at Debi Magdaleno ' s West Los Angeles home , each boy toting a Ninja Turtle backpack containing a toothbrush , pajamas and a favorite toy . &quot; I ' m late , I ' m late . Give me a kiss goodby , &quot; Denise Witherspoon tells Jonathan , her son , and Zachary , her nephew . The boys clamber out of the car and Jonathan dutifully kisses his mother . Zachary runs to greet Magdaleno and her 7-year-old daughter , Marina , who are waiting to welcome the boys . Waving farewell , Witherspoon rushes_off to begin her 7 p.m.-to-7 a.m. shift as a bone_marrow transplant nurse at UCLA Medical_Center , while Magdaleno takes the children in the back yard to play for a_few minutes in the fading light . The scene is a typical slice of day_care life -- except , of course , that this day_care starts at dusk . The Magdaleno house , which has been a family child_care facility for two years , is soon full of activity : As Magdaleno prepares a dinner of pizza , fruit and milk , Zachary , Jonathan and Marina are busy coloring and playing with their Play-Doh . After eating every slice of pizza , the children change into their pajamas , brush their teeth , and snuggle in bed for story time . The pattern is familiar to the children ; the boys usually spend two nights a week with Magdaleno , a licensed child_care provider . When bedtime comes , they settle_down to sleep_with a minimum of fuss . As the number of employees working irregular hours grows , many parents -- particularly single parents -- are turning_to late-night and overnight child_care . For some , it ' s having to work late hours or meet with clients in the evenings . For others , the traditional hours of child_care must be extended because of graveyard and swing-shift work in the manufacturing or service_industries . &quot; I benefit from working_at night , because I get paid more_than I would during the day , &quot; said Witherspoon , a single parent who has been working late shifts since 1988 . &quot; And the boys have a stable place like Debi ' s to go . It ' s a home atmosphere , so they go from our home during the day to another home at night. &quot; Although few child_care centers provide late-night and overnight care , many family care providers in and near the Westside offer such services out of their homes and apartments . In the area bounded by Malibu in the north , Redondo Beach to the south and Silver Lake on the east , there are more_than 200 licensed family care providers that offer 24-hour service , according to child_care referral agencies . Parents are increasingly seeking after-hours child_care for a range of reasons , said Tracey Dickson of Connections for Children , a Santa Monica child_care referral agency that serves much of the Westside . Some parents use overnight care service regularly while they work or periodically while they attend evening meetings . Prominent among the customers are single parents , whose numbers are growing nationwide . Last year , 27 % of children under 18 lived with only one parent , up from 12 % in 1970 , according to the U.S. Census_Bureau . On the job front , 14 million full-time employees -- 18 % of the nation ' s full-time work_force -- worked something other_than a daytime shift in 1991 . This represents an addition of 2 million such workers over the previous six years , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor . The labor bureau also estimates that the top five growth occupations in the 1990s will be waiters and waitresses , registered nurses , janitors and cleaners , managers and cashiers -- all_of which will require long hours and some off-hour shift work . Some parents only need care that extends a_few hours past the traditional , end-of-the-workday pickup time . Anita Charles of West Los Angeles said she has taken_care of little Stefano Lazano for almost a year , six days a week . Lazano , who is almost 3 years old , stays with Charles and her three children from morning to almost 9 p.m. while his father works late as a store manager and his mother holds_down her job as a flight_attendant . &quot; Money-wise , there is no advantage to ( taking ) children at night , and it is more responsibility , &quot; Charles said . &quot; But I try and help those parents out there who need the help , because I ' m a parent , too. &quot; * Other parents seek all-night care . &quot; I see a lot of low-income mothers who truly care about their kids , but have no choice but to take a night job , &quot; said Pat Onuorah , who offers 24-hour family care at her Ladera Heights home . &quot; Every night , I have at least one child who stays over. &quot; Onuorah is licensed to care_for 12 children at any given time , a typical number for family care providers . And like most providers , Onuorah , who works_at the Watts Health Foundation during the day , hires assistants to help her watch children and prepare meals . On a recent evening , about a dozen children were sprawled on her living room floor , playing games , eating spaghetti and watching the video &quot; Aladdin. &quot; One baby in the room was scheduled to stay with Onuorah for four days . &quot; He ' s very adaptable and independent , &quot; Onuorah said of the 15-month-old boy , whose mother is a flight_attendant . &quot; He ' s been going_to baby-sitters ever since he was born. &quot; Family care providers sometimes charge by the hour , from $ 5 to $ 9 , or on a weekly basis from $ 50 to $ 125 -- prices that are comparable_to those for daytime care . Some licensed providers may charge extra for overnight or weekend care , however . To be licensed by the state_Department of Social_Services , family providers must meet certain requirements , which include attending a licensing seminar , being fingerprinted and having their homes deemed safe for children . While many family care providers are willing to offer late-night and overnight care , few , if any , child_care centers in Los Angeles provide 24-hour service . &quot; You ' re not going_to find many child_care centers willing to provide that type of care because it ' s not profitable at all , &quot; said Tammy Baker of Child and Family Services , a child_care referral agency that serves Beverly Hills , Hollywood , Mid-Wilshire and downtown areas . &quot; You need to pay your workers overtime and it ' s hard to maintain a steady clientele. &quot; And many parents with non-traditional work schedules prefer leaving their children in a home setting rather than an institutionalized child_care facility . &quot; If you have to drop your child off at night in their pajamas , would you want to take them to a place where the person who answers the door is wearing pajamas and your child can snuggle up in a bed in their home ? &quot; Baker asked . &quot; Or would you want to go_to a place with fluorescent lights , where they put your child on a cot ? &quot; Sharon Cannon , a single parent raising a 15-month-old daughter , Shanice , said she would have had to leave her swing-shift job at the U.S. Post_Office if she hadn ' t been referred to Agnes Lewis ' child_care facility . Every afternoon , when Cannon drops Shanice off at Lewis ' Inglewood home at about 3:15 p.m. , Lewis makes_it a point to tell the baby , &quot; Your mommy ' s going_to work now . She ' ll be back tonight to pick you up. &quot; Cannon then kisses her baby goodby , and waves to her as she walks to her car . &quot; It ' s really important for them to wave to each other , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; That way Shanice knows she ' s coming back. &quot; After watching her mother ' s car drive_away , Shanice goes inside to play with the seven other children under Lewis ' care . A few hours later , after most of the other children have gone_home , Lewis and Shanice have dinner . Shanice is then tucked into bed , only to be stirred out of sleep shorty after midnight . &quot; You ready to see Mama ? &quot; Lewis asks Shanice , as she lifts the sleepy but smiling child from her crib . &quot; It ' s time to go home. &quot; When Lewis first started watching Shanice early this year , Shanice would cry and hold_on tight to her mother . &quot; Her mother would sit in her car and hear her screaming inside , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; That made her feel so bad . She kept saying , ' Hopefully , one of these days , I won ' t have to work. ' &quot; For now , however , Cannon packs up Shanice , says good_night to Lewis , and drives to her home_in the Ladera Heights area . Despite the reluctance of some parents to leave their children in overnight care , many have no other options . Few companies , even those with employees working irregular hours , have considered round-the-clock child_care . &quot; The issue of 24-hour care has been brought_up from time to time , and the unions have asked about it , &quot; said Sylvia Woodside , a human services manager for the U.S. Postal Service in Los Angeles . &quot; But we ' ve held_off because of the lack of funding. &quot; * Childrens Hospital Los Angeles used to offer 24-hour child_care to its employees , but the program was discontinued because the hospital couldn ' t maintain a steady enrollment . &quot; I believe there ' s a hesitancy to put kids in a center at night , &quot; said Darcy Williams , who runs the hospital ' s child_care program . &quot; All the guilt that women feel about leaving their child at a center is compounded at night . We ' re considering bringing_back 24-hour care , but we would only do so with trained people and lots of planning . It ' s a very distant thought. &quot; UCLA is one of the rare Westside employers that responds to its employees ' off-hour child_care needs . Magdaleno ' s family child_care facility , Debicare , is run_through the university ' s child_care services , and was contracted to provide overnight home care specifically for UCLA Medical_Center employees who must work late shifts .</TEXT>
