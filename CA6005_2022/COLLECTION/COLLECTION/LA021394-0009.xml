   <HEADLINE> FIVE-RING COVERAGE ; CBS SHOWS MAJOR EVENTS DURING PRIME_TIME ; TNT ALSO HAS THE DAYTIME COVERED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If it seems like only two years ago that we were setting our schedules , or our VCRs , for Winter Olympic viewing , that ' s because it was in February , 1992 , that athletes from throughout the world gathered_in France ' s Savoy region for the XVI Winter Games . As a result of the International Olympic Committee ' s decision to move the Winter Games out of the same calendar_year as the Summer Games , we had to wait only two years instead of the usual four for the next sequel , the XVII Winter_Olympics in Lillehammer , Norway . The change was inspired by U.S. television network executives , who complained they did not have the financial wherewithal to bid for two Olympics in the same year . But , in this particular case , the winners are the athletes , who had to train for only an additional 48 months before competing in another Games . Many say they would have retired if their next opportunity had not come until 1996 . Also , rule revisions in figure_skating have allowed other well-known names from past Olympics to return . CBS , which paid $ 295 million for the broadcast rights , hopes that familiarity breeds ratings for its prime-time coverage . TNT will air daytime coverage of selected events . Following is a glance at the major stories CBS will be following in each sport ( for broadcast times , see schedule Page 7 ) : Figure_Skating Katarina Witt . Brian Boitano . Viktor Petrenko . Torvill and Dean . Gordeeva and Grinkov . The theme was going_to revolve_around former gold medalists who took_advantage of a new rule that allowed them to renounce their professional past and return to serious competition . That was before figure_skating hit the front pages with stories of bodyguards , hit_men , strange estranged husbands and jealous rivals as someone tried to ice America ' s ice princess , Nancy Kerrigan . All they got was her knee , which , while damaged enough to prevent her from defending her national championship last month , appeared at press time to have sufficiently recovered for her to skate in Norway . Less certain was whether Tonya Harding , who inherited the national championship , would be implicated in the assault and , if so , whether it would cost her the Olympic berth . In any case , the Kerrigan-Harding affair seems certain to overshadow the other women competitors , including Germany ' s Witt , a two-time gold medalist returning for one more chance for glory , Ukranian orphan Oksana Baiul , who won the world championship last year at age 15 , and France ' s back-flipping former gymnast , Surya Bonaly . In the men ' s competition , all_the drama will be_on the ice . The last two Olympic champions , the United States ' Boitano from 1988 and Ukraine ' s Petrenko from 1992 , take_on four-time world champion Kurt Browning of Canada and a_couple_of upstarts , Scott Davis of the United States and Elvis Stojko of Canada . The pairs competition seems a lock for the 1988 gold medalists , Russians Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov . But Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean of Great Britain , who won the dance gold medal in 1984 with their memorable &quot; Bolero , &quot; have not adjusted as well in their comeback and appear vulnerable to a_couple_of Russian teams , who had to move_into separate rinks on separate continents after a married partner from one team started waltzing off the ice with a member of the other team . Figure_skating action , it ' s fan-tastic ! Speedskating Can Bonnie Blair do_it again ? Can Dan Jansen do_it ? Blair , who has won three gold medals and a bronze in the last two Games , can become the most decorated U.S. woman Olympian with a medal in Norway . That does not figure to be much of a hurdle for her as she is entered in three events and figures to be favored in two . More compelling is the challenge awaiting her teammate , Kristen Talbot , who earned a berth on the Olympic team and , two days later , donated bone_marrow as a potential life-saving gift for her brother , who was diagnosed in December with aplastic_anemia . Talbot would consider her Games successful if she finishes in the top 15 . But she says her most inspirational battle_cry is reserved for her brother . &quot; Go white count ! &quot; The United States ' best hope on the short track again is Cathy Turner , who gave_up her singing career -- &quot; Sexy , Kinky Tomboy &quot; was her most successful single -- to win a gold medal and a silver in 1992 . She took a break from competition last year , becoming the first speedskater to tour with the Ice Capades . On the morning Jansen was to skate in the 500 meters in the 1988 Winter Games , he learned that his sister , Jane , had died after a long bout with leukemia . In one of the most heartbreaking chapters of U.S. Olympic history , he skated that afternoon and fell , then returned days later in another event and fell again . Back in the Olympics four years later in Albertville , again as a medal contender , he finished fourth in one race and 26th in another . Instead of giving_up , he persevered and since has established himself as the sport ' s fastest man , a prohibitive favorite to win the 500 and among the favorites in the 1 # 000 . He says he is more mature now , having gained a new perspective on life by the birth eight months ago of his first child , a daughter named Jane . Alpine Skiing After winning gold medals in the slalom and giant slalom in 1988 , Italy ' s Alberto Tomba , the self-proclaimed &quot; messiah of skiing , &quot; was so confident of duplicating the feat four years later that he renamed the site of the Games &quot; Alberto-ville. &quot; He did , however , make one concession to age . &quot; I used to have a wild time with three women until 5 a.m. , &quot; he said . &quot; In the Olympic village , I will live_it_up with five women until 3 a.m. &quot; Perhaps he had it right the first time because he repeated only in the giant slalom , settling for silver in the slalom . Or perhaps he has it right now that he is committed to one woman , a former Miss Italy . He , for a change , is making no predictions , but he is among the favorites in the giant slalom . U.S. skiers can match neither the talent nor the flamboyance of Tomba , although Picabo ( Peek-a-boo ) Street comes_close in the latter category . Her parents are former hippies who helped found the small village of Triumph , Idaho , where their daughter was known as &quot; Little_Girl &quot; until she was 3-years old . Her parents finally gave her the name of a nearby trout stream , which was named for a Native_American word meaning &quot; shiny waters. &quot; A silver medalist in the combined event in last year ' s World Championships , she likes her name except when she orders pizza . &quot; I just say my name is Jane , &quot; she says . Nordic Skiing For Norwegians , the glamour of alpine skiing ' s &quot; White Circus &quot; is for the dilettantes of Austria and Switzerland . Real skiing is cross-country , the longer and more demanding the course the better . In recent years , Norwegians have become intrigued by their new alpine stars , the Flying Vikings . But their hero is Vegard Ulvang , who won three gold medals and a silver in 1992 in cross-country_skiing but is even more admired as an explorer and adventurer whose goal is to climb the highest peaks and traverse the longest rivers on each continent . Tragedy touched Ulvang last year , when his brother disappeared in a snow storm while skiing . Ulvang joined in the official search , then conducted one of_his_own , in a futile attempt to find his brother before rejoining the ski team . &quot; There is nothing more I can do , &quot; he says . &quot; I have to confront the situation. &quot; Luge-Bobsled Confronting the situation . That is what Duncan Kennedy was doing_in a bar in Oberhof , Germany , earlier this winter , when neo-Nazi skinheads began chasing one of his black teammates on the U.S. luge team , Robert Pipkins . Kennedy stood_up to the thugs , allowing Pipkins to escape out a back_door . For his bravery , Kennedy suffered cuts and bruises but won admirers from throughout the world . If he wins a medal , it will be the first ever for the United States in luge . That would be a great achievement for someone who became interested in the sport while serving as a gofer for ABC during the 1980 Winter_Olympics in Lake Placid. , N.Y. A better bet for a medal , however , is Wendel Suckow , who last year became the United States ' first luge world champion . Last year also was a good one for Brian Shimer , a Floridian who was the world ' s leading bobsled driver . He has not had as much success this year , but believes he will be accustomed to the new sled designed by stock_car driver Geoff Bodine in time for the Games . Ice_Hockey The country split into numerous fragments , and most of their top players became professionals in North_America , but the Russians , who formed the nucleus of the former Soviet_Union ' s Olympic dynasty , continue winning . It will not take a &quot; Miracle on Ice &quot; for the United States to beat them , but it would be a significant upset . The young Americans are so rough and tumble that the U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . is considering signing them up .</TEXT>
