   <HEADLINE> AS WIRELESS AUCTION NEARS , IT ' S DECISION TIME FOR BIDDERS ; TELECOM : ASPIRING PROVIDERS OF ADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS MUST REGISTER BY TODAY TO TAKE_PART IN DEC . 5 SALE OF LICENSES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By the close of business today , federal regulators will learn who wants in on one of the biggest financial sweepstakes in U.S. history : a multibillion-dollar auction of licenses for advanced wireless services that could revolutionize the way Americans communicate . After weeks of frenetic deal making that has resulted in a series of landmark alliances among the nation ' s biggest telecommunications companies , aspiring auction participants will register with the Federal Communications Commission today and later place deposits of as much as $ 16 million for the right to participate -- with the eventual winners gaining the privilege of offering so-called broad-band personal communications services , or PCS . The Dec . 5 auction of 99 broad-band licenses will be by far the largest and most important in a series of controversial wireless license sales that began this summer and have so far wildly exceeded financial expectations . For the government , the December auction is expected to produce a windfall of more_than $ 10 billion . For industry powerhouses and daredevil entrepreneurs alike , it offers a rare opportunity to get_in on the ground_floor of what some predict will be a $ 40-billion-a-year industry early in the next century . For consumers , it holds the prospect of go-anywhere communications with which people can send and receive phone_calls , computer data and perhaps even video though devices as small and as portable as a wristwatch . &quot; These are licenses to run the telephone_companies of the future . . . and build the wireless lane of the information superhighway , &quot; said Reed E . Hundt , chairman of the FCC . Despite the high expectations of the FCC -- and of telephone_companies that have in some cases revamped their long-term strategies virtually overnight to position themselves for PCS -- developing the new services will be no cakewalk . There are more_than half_a_dozen competing broad-band PCS technologies , and several have yet to be fully tested , noted Pekka Soini , director of business development for Nokia , a Finnish electronics powerhouse . A few that have been tested aren ' t suitable for use in moving vehicles or have &quot; compromised voice quality , &quot; said Gary Brush , a product manager at Bellcore , the research arm of the regional Bell telephone_companies . In addition , the Justice_Department is investigating whether some of the recent alliances established to bid on PCS licenses could violate federal antitrust_laws . Many experts think the department ultimately won ' t take any action , but some say the auctions could still trigger a flood of lawsuits by disgruntled bidders , further delaying the deployment of PCS . &quot; This is a high-stakes game with a lot of money on the line , and I don ' t think you can expect people to just walk away and be good losers , &quot; said an official of one company that plans to bid in December . Still , PCS is undeniably creating enormous excitement and anticipation both inside and outside the telecommunications industry . Los Angeles lawyer Johnnie Cochran , for example , couldn ' t be busier these days with clients such_as O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson . But last month he flew to the nation ' s capital to hear a pitch on PCS , two Washington lawyers say . A spokesman for Cochran confirmed he flew to Washington in September but declined to discuss the nature of the visit . &quot; I think people who have looked_at this understand there is a great_deal of risk associated with an industry that is not yet built and proven , but there appears to be a consensus that wireless communications is one of the great growth areas of telecommunications over the near future , &quot; said a partner at Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher &amp; Flom , a major Wall_Street merger and acquisition law_firm . It has only recently become clear , however , just how much risk the would-be PCS providers will have to assume . The federal_government ' s first wireless auction in July , involving so-called narrow-band PCS licenses ( to be used for paging services ) and some specialized interactive TV licenses , was a far more expensive affair than anyone had anticipated , drawing more_than $ 800 million in bids . The rich prices prompted an 11th-hour scramble among potential bidders to fortify their financial war_chests for the December auction . Just last week , the regional Bell telephone_companies US West , Bell Atlantic and Nynex announced they would team with cellular provider AirTouch Communications in the PCS bidding . Earlier this week , long-distance carrier Sprint Corp . and three of the nation ' s largest cable TV companies said they would form a new company , in part to bid for PCS licenses . Those contestants are expected to be joined at today ' s filing deadline by AT &amp; T , GTE and many others . &quot; It makes_sense to form alliances , because you are going_to be competing against the_likes_of AT &amp; T and McCaw Cellular &quot; and other big telecommunications firms , said Arun Sarin , senior_vice_president for strategy and development at AirTouch . Sarin added that forming such deep-pocketed alliances &quot; absolutely gives us an advantage &quot; over companies without cellular holdings or the resources of the regional Bells . &quot; Because we already have 110 million ( customers ) , we can buy equipment cheaper and have better ( business ) agreements. &quot; But analysts say these alliances -- some of which have goals even more sweeping than winning a PCS license -- may prove to be unstable over the long term . Critics also worry that the combined firepower of telecommunications giants will work against federal efforts to encourage small businesses and those owned by women and minorities to gain a foothold in PCS . When Congress first gave the FCC authority to conduct the auctions , it directed the agency to find ways to encourage participation by so-called designated entities of small businesses , minorities and women . But despite bidding credits and other advantages , no minorities or women won licenses in July ' s auction . And many industry officials say there is great reluctance among some of the regional Bell companies and other wealthy bidders to collaborate with designated entities , out of fear they may later face legal challenges . &quot; You have two kinds of potential legal risks , &quot; said an official of one cellular_phone company . &quot; Someone may file ( a lawsuit ) against your designated-entity partnership and allege that it is a sham , and the second area is that people aren ' t certain the FCC can legally require you to give a preference to women and minorities for PCS spectrum. &quot; The absence of a diverse PCS ownership pool could thwart development of the kind of intense competition that drove down long-distance phone rates following the breakup of the AT &amp; T monopoly , some critics say . &quot; I think the small companies are getting shafted in this whole process , &quot; said Bruce Kushnick , president of New Networks Institute , a New York-based consulting firm and a longtime critic of the regional Bell companies . &quot; The bottom_line is that there is not going_to be real competition , &quot; he said , &quot; just a continuation of the current giant local telephone oligopoly , where there is some competition but no price_war &quot; that would make wireless services affordable to all .</TEXT>
