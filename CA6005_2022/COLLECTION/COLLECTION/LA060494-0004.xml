   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO STRESS EXPORTS TO JAPAN INSTEAD OF DEFICIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The White_House has concluded that it will be unable to reduce the growing trade_deficit with Japan during President Clinton ' s first term and no longer considers doing so a key political objective , the Administration ' s chief trade negotiator indicated Friday . Instead of aiming for a specific reduction in the U.S.-Japan trade_deficit , now about $ 60 billion a year , the Administration will emphasize Clinton ' s efforts to increase exports in select industries , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said . In an interview with Times reporters , Kantor downplayed any assertion that the Administration is retreating from attempts to get_tough with Japan on trade . He noted that talks are continuing on developing a new framework for trade relations between the two nations in a number of important industrial sectors . Still , it appears the Administration has changed its goal of attempting to set specific targets to reduce the overall U.S.-Japan trade_deficit . The deficit has become a highly visible reminder of the United States ' uncertain standing in the competitive global marketplace . Administration officials and many private economists agree that the level of U.S. exports is a more direct measure of the United States ' ability to eliminate the barriers that make_it difficult for U.S. firms to do business in foreign markets . That is because the trade_deficit also reflects purchases of foreign goods by Americans , and the gap can widen even if U.S. exports are rising and contributing to job growth in this country . The absolute size of the U.S.-Japan deficit &quot; is less important . . . than the content of the deficit , &quot; Kantor said . &quot; What has worried us most about the closed markets in Japan and what the framework talks are aimed at are those sectors where we have the highest potential growth : semiconductors , electronics , computers , supercomputers , auto and auto parts , services like insurance and financial services. &quot; In the 1992 election campaign , Clinton cited the growing deficit with Japan as evidence that the George_Bush Administration had not moved aggressively enough to open_up restricted markets . He promised to make vigorous trade_policy a central element of his strategy for economic renewal , estimating that every $ 1 billion in additional U.S. exports would create 20 # 000 to 30 # 000 new jobs in this country . Kantor , addressing another touchy competitiveness issue , said that the U.S. trade_gap with China ultimately could rival in size the troublesome deficit with Japan . Speaking just a week after Clinton announced renewal of Beijing ' s most-favored-nation trade status , he said that tough negotiations lie ahead to ensure that China complies with international trade laws as it grows_into a trading powerhouse . Most-favored-nation status gives China the same low tariffs as most other U.S. trading partners . &quot; If we don ' t continue to be aggressive and work with China on a day-to-day basis and , in fact , insist that they adhere to the same norms as the rest of the major nations . . . who have access to our market , then , yes , we ' re going to create a problem for ourselves , &quot; he said . Kantor said he met with China ' s ambassador to the United States on Thursday and engaged in a &quot; very candid discussion &quot; of trade issues . In Friday ' s breakfast session at The Times ' Washington Bureau , Kantor complained about China ' s refusal to abide_by international rules governing intellectual property_rights . He cited in particular the rampant production of bootleg versions of Western music . &quot; They don ' t protect intellectual property , &quot; Kantor said . &quot; They have 26 plants in southern China which last year produced 75 million compact_discs , only 2 million of which were consumed in China -- 73 million were exported. &quot; The piracy problem extends_to &quot; computer software , computer_hardware , pharmaceuticals , you name it , &quot; he said . Kantor ' s remarks contrast with those of Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown , who said last month that the renewal of most-favored-nation status would help shrink or even eliminate the United States ' growing trade_deficit with China . In 1993 , the United States logged a $ 23-billion deficit with China , second only to the gap with Japan . Meanwhile , Kantor said the Administration is beginning to rethink U.S. policy toward exports of U.S. cigarettes and other tobacco products . At a time when the tobacco_industry is facing mounting pressure at_home , it has seen international markets as an important source of future profits and growth . But Kantor said the Administration already has reversed a Bush_Administration policy by no longer opposing efforts by other nations to block sales of U.S. cigarettes because of local health and safety regulations . Before the policy shift , the United States objected to such obstacles on the grounds that they represented unfair trading rules . Kantor said the Administration would not attempt to reverse such policies as long as U.S. brands are treated no differently from local tobacco products .</TEXT>
