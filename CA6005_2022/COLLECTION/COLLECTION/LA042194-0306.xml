   <HEADLINE> ' HAM ' ON ROM ; DEAL WILL PUT DR . SEUSS BOOKS ON COMPUTER DISCS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Audrey Geisel had one requirement for the multitude of multimedia firms vying to license her late husband ' s work over the past year : &quot; That cat had to be that cat . Down to the last whisker. &quot; Wednesday , the 72-year-old widow of Theodore Geisel -- known to generations of children as Dr. Seuss -- said she had granted the rights to create interactive versions of such classics as &quot; The Cat in the Hat , &quot; &quot; Green Eggs and Ham &quot; and &quot; Horton Hatches the Egg &quot; to Living Books , a joint_venture between Geisel ' s longtime publisher , Random House , and Broderbund , the leading publisher of children ' s software . In the scramble among multimedia developers to gobble_up rights to intellectual property for translation to the new medium , the Dr. Seuss books were among the most hotly contested . The author ' s 48 children ' s books , which began in 1937 with &quot; And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street , &quot; are among the best-known literary properties ever licensed for multimedia and will probably help drive future deals . &quot; It was not an easy negotiation , &quot; said Random House Chairman Alberto Vitale , who had long yearned to turn the Seuss books into CD-ROMs . Terms were not disclosed , but a source familiar_with the deal said it was &quot; well into the seven figures. &quot; Orchestrated by the ICM talent agency , a parade of software firms including Microsoft , Paramount Interactive and Activision trekked out_to visit Geisel near her La Jolla home last year , armed with personal_computers , CD-ROM_drives and the best multimedia pitch they could muster . They found no pushover . Since the author died in 1991 , Audrey Geisel , who as chief_executive of Dr. Seuss Enterprises owns all_rights to his work , has been a fierce guardian of its artistic integrity . &quot; I worried that the quality would hold_up . . . and that it be absolutely line-proof to the books , &quot; she said . But Geisel said she was never uncertain about whether to enter the brave new_world of CD-ROM with her husband ' s much-beloved rhymes and illustrations . &quot; This is a new form of communication that never existed before . And that was what Ted was all about. &quot; After producing a prototype , Living Books nearly lost out , despite Geisel ' s desire to honor her husband ' s 50-year association with Random House . &quot; They had a bad hair day , a bad CD-ROM day , who knows , &quot; Geisel said . But she gave them a second chance and , Geisel said , they came_through . Living Books come_on CD-ROMs , which look_like music compact_discs except they hold text , video and animation in addition to sound . Played_on a device hooked_up to a computer , CD-ROMs hold 400 times the data of a typical computer floppy_disk . In the Living Book titles already on the market , such_as &quot; Just Grandma and Me , &quot; each page of the book is displayed on the computer_screen . Each character has a voice , and when children click on different objects , the objects respond . Living Books won ' t say which Dr. Seuss book it will do first , but the first is scheduled to go_on sale early next year . Will Dr. Seuss ' immortal rhymes be altered to suit the children of the Information Age ? &quot; I think the children would say , ' that ' s not the way it goes , ' &quot; Geisel said . &quot; ' I meant what I said and I said what I meant . . . ' &quot; When she couldn ' t remember the rest , a listener filled_in : &quot; An elephant ' s faithful 100 percent. &quot; &quot; See ? &quot; Geisel said . &quot; You don ' t mess_around with that. &quot;</TEXT>
