   <HEADLINE> LEARNING FROM QUAKES : LOTS DONE , MORE TO DO ; STARCH IN PARKING STRUCTURES ; VIGILANCE IN MAKING GRANTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Parking garages are as integral to Southern California ' s automobile culture as freeways themselves . Without them many shopping_malls couldn ' t survive ; driving to work , to a medical appointment , to a college might be all but impossible . In the Northridge earthquake at least eight parking structures were damaged significantly . If the temblor had come only a_few hours later , many lives surely would have been lost in these structures and many , many_more cars would have been destroyed . Take these eight cases as one more warning to be acted_on quickly , as a primary matter of public safety . Experts are still studying why some parking structures tipped , tilted or collapsed in the San Fernando Valley , other parts of Los Angeles and Glendale . As The Times reported Friday , two key indications already have emerged . Precast concrete structures , linked together at the site , seem less seismically stable than cast-in-place structures . And cutting costs -- one of the appeals of using precast construction -- often invites trouble , even when building_code standards are met . Structural engineers will have to first agree on what changes are needed and then recommend changes in the Uniform Building_Code . The problem is that the code isn ' t scheduled for review until 1997 . Ensuring parking structure safety , in terms of either new construction or retrofitting , must_not wait until then . The California Building Standards Commission could require local_governments to meet higher standards a lot sooner ; it should do just that , as soon as practical . Lives are at stake . Right now , the Federal Emergency Management Agency is helping many quake victims climb back from disaster . But , as Times staff writer Carla Rivera reported , FEMA has sent checks to some who may_not be eligible . To that , the agency ' s director vows that federal and state inspectors will verify every check , mistakes will be rectified and cheaters prosecuted . Taxpayers need that reassurance , especially while President Clinton ' s $ 8.6-billion earthquake aid bill works its way through the Congress . Any hint of fraud will cost votes . The debate in Congress is not limited to how much money Southern California should receive . Many politicians are using the temblor to posture on other issues , from illegal immigration to the federal_deficit . Certainly vigilance in all government programs is needed , as fraud in the post-quake emergency food_stamp program showed . But vigilance always must be tempered with common_sense and compassion . If fraud has occurred -- perhaps even substantial criminality -- then the violators must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law . But this does not eviscerate the essential value of the effort : to help the quake ' s victims . Indeed , FEMA has improved aid delivery . After the 1992 riots here , checks took too long to arrive and more_than half of those who filed applications failed the documentation requirements . In response to last year ' s Midwest floods , the Clinton_Administration revised the rules to provide more timely relief and this region has benefited from that new policy .</TEXT>
