   <HEADLINE> HAITIAN PRIEST ' S SLAYING PROVOKES ANGER OF U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The assassination in Port-au-Prince of a prominent supporter of deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide sharply increases the probability of a U.S.-led invasion of Haiti to restore democracy to the impoverished Caribbean nation , the Clinton_Administration said Monday . &quot; Make no mistake , outrages such_as these reinforce the determination of the international community to take all necessary means to bring_about the early restoration of democracy in Haiti , &quot; State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said , employing diplomatic language for the use of military_force . McCurry referred to the killing Sunday night of the Rev . Jean-Marie Vincent , a Roman_Catholic priest and a longtime supporter of Aristide , himself a populist priest who was deposed by the military after winning the only internationally recognized free and fair presidential election in Haiti ' s modern history . In a statement issued from his exile headquarters in Washington , Aristide said Vincent ' s death was only the latest of more_than 5 # 000 killings by the military since it seized power in September , 1991 . Deputy Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott and Deputy Defense_Secretary John Deutch headed for Jamaica and a meeting today of Caribbean nations to discuss ways of dealing with the Haitian military junta . U.S. officials said Talbott and Deutch hope to line_up governments willing to contribute at least token forces to a U.S.-led invasion army . McCurry dismissed as baseless speculation a spate of reports that the Administration , beset by a Cuban refugee crisis , had shifted to the back burner the planning for a Haiti invasion , postponing the earliest possible date_from mid-September to sometime in the late fall . &quot; The planning has continued , &quot; McCurry said . &quot; The diplomacy to build the force that would be capable of ( invading ) has continued . . . . We prefer to see a peaceful resolution to this crisis . But events such_as . . . the murder of an innocent cleric and the types of human_rights abuses that continue do lend urgency to the need to put_together those measures that are defined by the United Nations in Security_Council Resolution 940 , &quot; which authorizes the use of force . &quot; We do expect to see support within the region , &quot; he added , insisting that several Western_Hemisphere countries will join the potential invasion force , although none have announced such plans . &quot; Human_rights are being pervasively violated in Haiti , &quot; McCurry said . &quot; Our message to those who continue these inhuman and senseless assassinations is clear : You cannot intimidate the international community . Your crimes only increase our outrage and strengthen our resolve to rid Haiti of your abuses. &quot; Despite the Administration ' s strident rhetoric , the military regime of Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras has given no indication that it plans to step_down . Nevertheless , the Agency for International Development is working_on an economic recovery plan that would be triggered by the restoration of Aristide to the presidency . A senior AID official said Monday that the world ' s rich nations must contribute $ 550 million in the first 12 months after Aristide regains power to ensure that the restoration of democracy produces tangible benefits for the Haitian public . &quot; Haiti has been a non-functioning country for decades , &quot; the official said . &quot; It has never had a government that is worthy of the name. &quot; But , he said , all that must change dramatically if democracy is to have a chance to establish itself in the hostile Haitian environment . Of the $ 550 million that Washington thinks Haiti needs in the first year , about $ 450 million seems readily available , including $ 100 million from the United States , $ 151 million from the World_Bank and other international lending_institutions and $ 200 million from other donors , most of it from the European Union . As a result of a conference sponsored by the World_Bank last week in Paris , the official said , it appears likely that the $ 100-million shortfall will be made_up as soon as it becomes clear that Aristide will regain power . The official said that Washington will make &quot; a substantial contribution &quot; toward the shortfall but he declined to offer a precise figure . AID said that almost half of the $ 550 million for the first year will be required in the crucial first three months . That includes money to create 75 # 000 short-term public works jobs to combat the island ' s unemployment and to start restoring its devastated infrastructure .</TEXT>
