   <HEADLINE> FRUSTRATION LEADS QUAKE VICTIMS TO JOIN FORCES ; COALITION : THOUSANDS OF ANGRY VALLEY HOMEOWNERS FORM A NEW GROUP TO FACE OFF AGAINST INSURERS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They ' re mad as hell -- and not taking it anymore . Six months after the earthquake , their homes and lives still a shambles , thousands of San Fernando Valley homeowners are turning their frustration into political action , hoping to give insurers and elected officials a good jolt of_their_own . Banded_together in a grass-roots coalition that is part activist and part educational group called Community Assisting Recovery ( CARe ) , these quake victims are fighting_back against those they feel have abandoned them . &quot; God bless CARe_for what they ' re doing , &quot; said Gabriela Segal after the group ' s executive_director , George Kehrer , inspected the quake damage to her Northridge home last week . Kehrer , who is both a lawyer and a licensed general contractor , also went_over her insurance_policy with her . &quot; There ' s nobody else to tell me what to do , &quot; Segal said . &quot; Nobody else to help . I called the insurance commissioner ' s help line last week and said , ' I need somebody to help me read my policy and tell me what my rights are. ' He said , ' We don ' t do that. ' All they do is send_out forms . &quot; I understand they ' re ( help line_workers ) overwhelmed , &quot; she added . &quot; But there should be somewhere we can go_for advice. &quot; Young and old , first-time home_buyers and retirees with paid-off mortgages , many CARe volunteers don ' t fit the usual activist mold . But circumstances have made them reluctant warriors . They want their homes and lives back the way they were before that awful January morning . All of them say they are exhausted , stressed out , fed up with living_in motels with small children , and tired_of dealing with insurance adjusters , contractors and others whom they don ' t know if they can trust . &quot; I ' ve heard ' Trust me ' and then been sorry I did so many times in the past few months I can ' t stand it , &quot; said a Northridge woman . &quot; At this point , the only people I trust are my husband and two children. &quot; And so they are willing to learn the business of organizing protests , gathering signatures on petitions and writing complaint letters to their representatives in Sacramento and Washington . They are also learning to draft press_releases and make colorful protest signs that look good on television . And at_large public meetings , with fire in their eyes , these property_owners have excoriated State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi for caving_in -- as they see it -- to powerful industry interests , in part to further his own political career . &quot; I ' m one of those people who believed my insurance_agent when he told me I was covered , &quot; said an Encino grandmother . &quot; Now it looks_like $ 50 # 000 is going_to have to come_out of my pocket and I don ' t have it. &quot; * Garamendi &quot; isn ' t doing anything and I can ' t afford to hire an attorney , &quot; the silver-haired woman said , shaking her head . &quot; Who does somebody like me turn_to ? Thank God for this group. &quot; Elena Stern , a spokeswoman for the insurance commissioner , said , &quot; John Garamendi caving_in or siding with insurance_companies to further his career is absolutely ludicrous . For the last 3 1 / 2 years , John Garamendi has been the insurance industry ' s worst nightmare . The insurance department represents consumers ' interests , not insurance industry interests , under this commissioner. &quot; Yet , the Encino grandmother and other angry homeowners interviewed for this story who are still waiting for insurance checks did not want to give their names . Their fear ? That the insurers would somehow retaliate . &quot; that ' s the level of fear and distrust that ' s out there , &quot; said Kehrer . &quot; It ' s terrible. &quot; So far , CARe volunteers have blown the whistle on questionable insurance practices and vowed to boycott some companies , mostly those that now claim they can no longer afford to offer quake and homeowners coverage . These quake victims say insurance_companies are pressuring them to hurry up and settle their claims , perhaps for less than they might be entitled to . * &quot; They say , ' It ' s been six months and you have to act in good_faith too , ' &quot; said a woman who lives_in Chatsworth . &quot; You aren ' t acting in a fair and reasonable manner . But I ' m not ready and they aren ' t going_to push me around. &quot; Hundreds of disgruntled policyholders have turned_out for each of the more_than 30 major meetings CARe has conducted in the hard-hit San Fernando Valley since April . Most of them have also organized into smaller groups made_up of people who all have the same insurer . They meet every two weeks to share problems and air grievances against 20th Century , Allstate , Farmers , Republic , State Farm , United Services Automobile Assn . and Western Republic insurance_companies . Representatives of Woodland Hills-based 20th Century Insurance Co . said last week that they are sorry the company ' s policyholders are unhappy . Like several other companies , 20th Century has also said it has settled most quake-related claims . Based in Northridge , CARe set_up its headquarters in April in an office suite donated by the Porter Ranch Center , a mini-mall at Tampa Avenue and Rinaldi Street that was also damaged by the quake . Since then , the consumer group says it has attracted 2 # 000 volunteers and claims to represent at least another 2 # 000 victims of the January disaster . &quot; We know that for every name on our mailing_list , there ' s at least one person and probably more who has come_to one of our meetings or workshops , &quot; said Kehrer . &quot; But I know we ' re making a difference by the number of thank-you calls we ' re starting to get , &quot; Kehrer said . &quot; People call us and say , ' Thank_you , my insurance_company just conceded it will cost $ 50 # 000 more to fix my house than they thought , ' &quot; he said . &quot; Or , ' Thank_you , now they are going_to cover asbestos removal . Thank_you , the damage to my pool or fence or deck is covered. ' It ' s very satisfying. &quot; On average , the phone rings 25 or 30 times a day , said CARe office manager Marcy Contreras , the organization ' s only paid staffer . One recent week she and several volunteers answered more_than 100 calls after state Sen . Art Torres ( D-Los Angeles ) held a well-publicized meeting on quake-related insurance problems . Many called to sign_up for the free workshops Kehrer and other CARe volunteers conduct . Subjects have included how to fill_out a so-called &quot; scope of loss &quot; form for an insurer itemizing quake damage , how deductibles work , what personal-property coverage includes , and dealing with a contractor . The organization , which is applying for nonprofit status , depends entirely on donations . So far , it has received about $ 7 # 000 in cash , Kehrer said . Others have donated supplies or services . The group received its first corporate donation last week from Hughes Aircraft Corp . &quot; They asked us to make a list of things we needed , &quot; said Marcy , who told the company the organization needs tables , chairs , copiers and fax machines . One volunteer also offered to donate printing services , until now one of the organization ' s biggest expenses . Kehrer , who has become an advocate for disaster victims since he lost his home_in the 1991 Oakland Hills fire , understands what quake victims are going_through . And since moving to Northridge -- specifically to help quake victims -- he has seen much of the devastation first-hand . The Oakland Hills house he was sharing with a friend burned to the ground in 10 minutes . The pair is still battling with Allstate , their insurance carrier , two years later . Early on in that battle , Kehrer heard about an Oakland-based consumer group , United Policyholders , and decided to attend a meeting . &quot; It changed my life , &quot; he said . &quot; Suddenly , I discovered all these people who were dealing with the same problems , the same difficult recovery process I was. &quot; * Both a general contractor and a lawyer , Kehrer discovered it was the perfect combination of skills to make him an effective advocate for disaster victims . Since the Oakland fire , he has worked as an unpaid volunteer with victims of Hurricane Andrew , last fall ' s brush_fires in Laguna Beach and Malibu -- and , now , the Northridge quake . Kehrer and his Scottie dog , Spider , whom he saved from the fire , are staying with John and Kathy Trapani . The Northridge couple helped persuade Kehrer to move to the Valley from Oakland so he would be more accessible to quake victims . They also helped talk him into running CARe_for three years . &quot; George is just great , &quot; said Kathy Trapani , currently the group ' s president . &quot; We are very , very lucky to have him. &quot;</TEXT>
