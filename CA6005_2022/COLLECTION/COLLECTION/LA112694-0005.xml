   <HEADLINE> COLOMBIA REBELS WELCOME PLAN FOR PEACE TALKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cautious optimism swept Colombia on Friday as leaders of as_many as 12 # 000 Marxist rebels unexpectedly embraced a peace proposal unveiled by President Ernesto Samper ' s 3-month-old government . Authorities said a first round of talks could begin in February or March aimed at ending South_America ' s oldest war . &quot; This opportunity could well be the last in many years to put an end in a peaceful and honorable way to the fratricidal struggle that has done so_much harm to Colombia , &quot; Atty . Gen . Orlando Vasquez said as he offered to serve as a mediator in future talks . A spokesman in Mexico for the largest rebel group , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , said the organization welcomed the government ' s peace initiative . Colombian governments have been at war for 30 years with the FARC , the National Liberation Army , or ELN , and other smaller groups . Every government in the last decade has tried and failed to make_peace with the rebels . Officials said the reason for optimism now lies_in Samper ' s decision to take an approach that is radically different from previous administrations . In outlining his proposal , Samper said he will negotiate before a cease-fire is established . And , in a departure from the last government ' s austere free-market economic_policies , Samper is emphasizing land redistribution and a large spending program for housing , health and education . In addition , Samper vowed to rein_in human_rights violations by the military and right-wing paramilitary squads that have been blamed for hundreds of political killings in recent years . * &quot; The peace process that we will begin to prepare is directed at bringing a conclusive end to the war , &quot; Samper said in his peace proposal speech in Cauca , one of Colombia ' s most conflict-ridden states . &quot; Colombians should be warned that while the peace process lasts , acts of violence will continue to occur. &quot; The previous administration of President Cesar Gaviria signed agreements with three rebel organizations , encompassing more_than 3 # 000 guerrillas , and convoked a constitutional assembly to address political participation and other issues raised by the rebels . But Gaviria ' s attempts at reconciliation with the two largest groups broke_down over cease-fire violations . After a failed round of talks in Mexico in 1992 , warfare resumed . After Gaviria ' s neo-liberal policies , which critics said deepened poverty for millions of Colombians , the Samper government is emphasizing social investment that appeals_to the guerrilla groups . In addition to increased spending on social programs , the new government is committed to distributing more_than 1 million hectares of land to poor farmers . Given their growing sense of international isolation in an increasingly non-Communist world , the guerrillas may now be willing to settle for an expansion of these policies rather than an all-out socialist solution , analysts say . A tougher stand on human_rights abuses is also directed at gaining the guerrillas ' trust . FARC formed a legal political_party , the Union Patriotica , during a truce in the mid-1980s , only to watch hundreds of its members assassinated by death squads in subsequent years . Samper has said he is placing human_rights offices in all military garrisons and is pushing_through Congress approval of the Second Geneva Protocol on treatment of civilians , prisoners and wounded in time of war . He is considering asking the Red_Cross to verify whether human_rights are being respected in regions of conflict and has asked the guerrillas for a similar commitment to international conventions . &quot; The Samper government has accepted that there is a very real problem with human_rights and has made an important political decision to eradicate those violations , &quot; said Daniel Garcia Pena , a member of the government ' s peace commission . &quot; That and a unilateral commitment to crack_down on paramilitary groups as part of a larger policy on private security groups and gun_control are indications to the guerrillas that the government is speaking seriously to their concerns. &quot; There is no guarantee that the guerrillas will follow_through with the peace process in the long_run . FARC runs a profitable business in cocaine and heroin smuggling , and ELN is heavily involved in the businesses of kidnaping and extortion , especially against the oil_industry . That means that guerrillas legally re-entering society could not necessarily expect to live as well as they have illegally , analysts say . But with significant increases in terrorist acts , kidnaping and theft this year , the Samper government seems desperate for a global solution to its criminal problem . It is trying to work_out political arrangements for guerrillas and judicial ones for drug_traffickers . The country ' s largest business associations have also been receptive , offering to set_up a fund to help the guerrillas return to civilian life . Given that degree of flexibility from key elements of Colombian society , the guerrillas may now have a unique window of opportunity they cannot afford to pass_up , analysts said .</TEXT>
