   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN ULTRANATIONALIST GETS U.S. VISA ; POLITICS : VLADIMIR ZHIRINOVSKY IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE FRIDAY . SEVERAL GROUPS URGE HE BE KEPT OUT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration granted a visa Tuesday to Russian ultranationalist legislator Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky for a visit to the United States , rejecting arguments that doing so will indirectly help give him political respectability . Zhirinovsky is expected to visit the United States for 14 days beginning Friday . He is scheduled to speak in San Francisco on Monday and is also expected to stop in Los Angeles , New York and Washington . A White_House official said Zhirinovsky will not meet with any member of the Clinton_Administration during his trip . State_Department spokesman David Johnson emphasized that , in granting the visa , the United States &quot; neither endorses his views nor supports his ambitions. &quot; The U.S. Embassy in Moscow also said in a statement , &quot; The U.S._government finds many of Mr. Zhirinovsky ' s views anathema. &quot; Over the last few years , Zhirinovsky has aired some openly racist and extremist views of the United States . He has written that some time in the next century , America ' s white population will perish , swamped by blacks and Latinos , and that the United States will go the way of the Soviet_Union . &quot; We will not gloat when California joins Mexico , when a Negro republic is created in Miami and when the Russians take_back Alaska , or when America dissolves into a Commonwealth of New States , &quot; he wrote . &quot; The factories will close_down . There will be no medicine , no food , and you Americans will emigrate to Europe , to Japan and to Russia. &quot; Over the last year , a number of European_countries -- including France , Germany , Switzerland , Slovenia , Norway and Spain -- have denied Zhirinovsky visas because of his demagogic and inflammatory rhetoric . But Administration officials said they granted a visa because there are no solid legal grounds for turning him down . U.S. immigration law &quot; does not favor excluding persons on the basis of beliefs , statements or associations , &quot; Johnson said at a briefing . &quot; We have a long and respected tradition of allowing freedom_of_speech to all persons. &quot; U.S. officials also apparently decided that turning_down the visa might help Zhirinovsky portray himself as a martyr . He bragged recently that if the United States refused to let him on American soil , it would boost his personal popularity . &quot; The greater the resistance we meet , the more popularity we will have , &quot; said Zhirinovsky , who was elected in December to the Russian Duma , or lower house of Parliament . Russian polls have shown that Zhirinovsky has a core of support of between 5 % and 20 % of the Russian population -- not enough to win the presidency in the 1996 elections , but enough to give him a continuing political role . Several U.S. groups had urged the Clinton_Administration to keep Zhirinovsky out of the country . &quot; It is not his ideas we fear so_much as the respectability that Zhirinovsky would gain back home from a U.S.-sanctioned visit , &quot; the Simon Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles said in a recent letter to Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher . The center noted that in July , Zhirinovsky met in Moscow with Canada ' s leading neo-Nazi , Ernst Zundel . The National Conference on Soviet Jewry also criticized the Clinton_Administration ' s action . &quot; It should be noted that in addition to the pejorative and denigrating comments he has made concerning Jews , Mr. Zhirinovsky has disparaged other religious and ethnic minorities living_in Russia and other states of the former Soviet_Union , &quot; the conference said in a statement . Staff writer Richard Boudreaux of The Times ' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
