   <TEXT> Santa Ana winds can leave you plagued with dry , itchy skin . The condition is the result of dehydration ( lack of moisture ) or a lack of natural skin oils , according to Joey Marie , owner of Unique Impressions skin-care salon in Dana Point . Most people with extremely dry skin have a combination of the two conditions , and treating the problem on both fronts will bring_about rapid improvement . &quot; Men are particularly susceptible because some rarely use moisturizers , &quot; said Marie . According to a 1991 Simmons Market Research Bureau report , only 49.1 % of men use hand and body lotion . &quot; Some of the things people do to treat the problem can actually make_it worse , like taking a long , hot bubble_bath or scrubbing at flaky skin. &quot; Here are her suggestions on improving skin_condition in preparation for warm-weather months when you ' ll want to bare a little skin that doesn ' t look and feel_like sandpaper . Dehydration and Oil Depletion Adding Moisture * Drink_up : Keep a bottle of fresh_water with you at all times . Sipping throughout the day replenishes moisture lost from exposure to sun , wind and heated rooms . * Avoid cigarettes , coffee , tea and cola : These deplete your system of necessary fluids . * Protect from sun and wind : Most of us use sun block during hot summer months , but in Southern California , exposure to sun is a year-round concern . Use a moisturizer with sun block and reapply lipstick or lip protectant frequently on windy days . * Create humidity : Forced-air heating depletes moisture from the air in your home , office and automobile . Sleep_with a humidifier near your bed to make_up for this imbalance . Maintaining Natural Oils * Mealtime : Not enough fat in the diet affects the body ' s ability to produce enough sebum to lubricate skin surfaces . Skin lacking this natural protectant is overly sensitive and easily damaged . Its natural moisture evaporates quickly , undermining efforts to improve moisture balance . Supplements containing vitamins A , C and E also help build beautiful skin from the inside out . * Bath time : Contrary to popular belief , a long , hot session in the tub or shower will not help dry skin . Prolonged exposure to hot water can deplete oils . Stay_away_from bath salts and bubble_bath , because many contain harsh alcohol-based solutions that only add_to your skin_problem . Likewise for chlorinated pools and spas . Be sure to wash off thoroughly and apply lotion afterward . * Bedtime : Don ' t sleep_with your face buried in your pillow . Your skin replenishes itself while you sleep , and your pillow could be absorbing oils and moisture beneficial to your face . If Dryness Persists * Switch detergents : Harsh cleaners leave a residue in clothing that is irritating and drying for sensitive skin . Shop around for a mild formula or use a minimal amount . * Rinse out fabric finishes : Many people complain of itching and dryness after wearing new clothes that are treated with a protective finish . Always wash new clothes before wearing . * See a doctor : A dermatologist or internist can determine if your dry skin is caused by a medical problem , such_as allergies or a thyroid condition . Skin_Care Products An assessment of your skin_care routine at a specialty salon such_as Unique Impressions will also help you improve the condition of your skin . &quot; Products that work well for a friend might not work well for you , since each person needs to find the right combination for their skin , &quot; Marie said . &quot; It is also important to make adjustments based on your progress. &quot; Unique Impressions features the Dermologica line , developed by the International Dermal Institute . &quot; It ' s emphasis is_on natural ingredients and maintaining the skin ' s proper acid mantle , &quot; Marie said . &quot; There is no formaldehyde , artificial color or fragrances or alcohol in the products. &quot; A basic Dermologica skin_care kit for your face or body costs $ 37 . The products are also available separately . Each are packaged in contamination-proof bottles , which allow you to squeeze_out the amount needed , without sticking your fingers into a jar . * Soap is a four-letter_word : The pH level ( acid to alkaline ratio ) of soap is much too acidic for the face . &quot; That tight feeling you get after using soap is a result of your skin being stripped of oils and moisture , &quot; Marie said . * Alternative : Dermologica ' s cream- or gel-based cleanser , depending_on your skin type . ( $ 20 for 8 oz. ) * Avoid astringents : Especially those with specially denatured alcohol or witch_hazel . Dermologica offers a spray-on herbal toner ( $ 21 for 8 oz. ) for use after cleansing that will help your skin retain moisture . * Use a mild scrub : &quot; Dry skin lookslike a layer of dead skin , so many people will try to remove it by using a harsh almond or apricot scrub , &quot; Marie said . &quot; But this can worsen the problem. &quot; A skin prep scrub made of corn cob meal ( $ 21.50 for 2.5 oz . tube ) with soothing skin conditioners is recommended instead . * Moisturizers : &quot; It should be lightweight , so it won ' t clog pores . Moisturizer also protects against wind , sun and pollution . Men should use it too , &quot; Marie said . Dermologica offers moisturizers for three skin types ( $ 25- $ 30 ) . * Specialty products : The Dermologica line also includes masques , concentrated skin boosters and an intensive oil replacement product for occasional use . &quot; These go beyond the daily routine to help achieve and maintain the condition of your skin &quot; . * Salon treatments : Unique Impressions offers hydrating treatments to plump_up your parched skin_cells . Techniques include warm masks , gentle steaming and penetrating moisture creams . Facials range from $ 35- $ 55 . These may include a hydrating hot paraffin treatment for the hands or feet . The paraffin treatment is also available separately ( $ 10 for hands , $ 20 for feet and $ 25 for both ) . Source : Dermologica , Unique Impressions Skin_Care Salon JANICE L . JONES</TEXT>
