   <HEADLINE> CATERING TO A CULTURE ; UNITED HI-TECH TAILORS U.S. PRODUCTS TO JAPANESE BUYERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Most American companies have difficulty selling products in Japan . A small Van Nuys firm has proved an exception . It has been profitably exporting everything from oil tank cleaning systems to customized Chevrolet vans , souped-up motorcycles and studio lighting systems to Japan for more_than a decade . &quot; American products are so salable in Japan , if they just had a touch , &quot; said Tadabumi Takasu , 47 , a Japanese-born electrical_engineer who founded United Hi-Tech Inc. in 1983 . &quot; What we provide is the Japanese touch , &quot; Takasu said as he sat in an office cluttered with electronic parts , a model of a Porsche 911 and a gleaming motorcycle engine . He said his company ' s sales have ranged between $ 2 million and $ 8 million a year since its inception . Takasu ' s five-man team exports a variety of products , but he said , &quot; generally we get involved with high-tech items , electronics or mechanics -- items Japanese people will buy , if they just had a a slight modification. &quot; Customized Chevrolet vans , for example , have been a staple of Takasu ' s business since 1988 . A friend at a Nissan dealership in Tokyo told him Chevrolet Astro vans had become a hot seller . But , he told Takasu , more vans could be sold if the interiors were upgraded with luxury appointments . &quot; We bought vans for conversion , just the metal frames with bare interiors -- no seats , no dashboard , nothing inside , and we totally redid them . We cut_out the windows ourselves , put_in leather seats , deluxe burled wood dash , put_in a new , higher roof , improved the suspension . Then , you have a product the Japanese will buy , &quot; Takasu said . United Hi-Tech contracts_out the conversion work and exports between 30 to 40 vans per month to Japan , charging about $ 10 # 000 per van . Takasu emigrated to the United States in 1970 , and for a while pursued graduate studies in electrical_engineering at Caltech . In 1973 , in need of money to support himself , he contacted a friend in the Japanese used car business , asking him if he could use any American-made cars . &quot; He arranged for me to get a letter_of_credit with his company and asked me to send him some Camaros , &quot; Takasu said . &quot; that ' s how I got started . I sent him about 50 cars in the first year : Camaros , Mustangs and Firebirds. &quot; The next year , Takasu , who never finished at Caltech , sent his friend about 200 American-made cars . &quot; The price difference , the cost of these American cars in Japan was incredible , &quot; Takasu said . &quot; I didn ' t even have any capital . Just a letter_of_credit , some good contacts . . . . The personal part is very important. &quot; Other early ventures included importing computer boards for video_games and negotiating the rights to distribute some early Japanese videotape machines , with only playback , that were rented through local video stores . &quot; The video players were the biggest hit we had in the beginning . We didn ' t know , we guessed it would work . that ' s why we try a little bit of everything. &quot; After exporting to Japan for more_than 20 years , Takasu has learned that the Japanese like American-made goods . They like American houses , art , vehicles , clothes -- even some technology . But they prefer them to be tailored to meet Japanese tastes or specifications . For example , Takasu became interested in the concert and stage lighting export business about five years ago , after an Italian lighting company asked him if he ' d be interested in marketing their computerized stage lighting systems to Japan . &quot; We were interested , but their lighting systems were much too_large and heavy for stages and studios in Japan , &quot; Takasu said . &quot; The technicians in Japan handling the lighting systems are usually women . . . . They need something light , easy to handle . We helped the company design a more compact computerized lighting system and found some friends to help us market it in Japan. &quot; The product , Takasu said , cost up_to $ 1 # 000 per system in Japan . Besides customizing vans and lighting systems , Takasu , who once raced motorcycles as a hobby , does motorcycle customizing as well . &quot; Whatever the customer wants -- twin spark_plugs , more speed , more power , more endurance -- we will design it that way , &quot; Takasu said , showing a glossy Japanese motorcycle magazine with photos of a replica 1982 Kawasaki racing cycle custom-designed by his company . The motorcycle replicas sell for about $ 30 # 000 . Takasu makes only two or three replicas each year , and sells to a single distributor in Japan . Another new venture is exporting custom-made , American prefabricated housing parts to Japan . &quot; We take the American-made house parts because they are superior and cheaper than the prefab house parts available on the market in Japan . We export the floors , the cabinets , the windows , the doors . . . . The parts are American , the finishing is Japanese. &quot; The biggest moneymaker for United Hi-Tech Inc. over the past five years has been overseas distribution of low-volume petroleum tank steam-cleaning systems designed by an American environmental engineering firm . Called the Super Max Cleaning System , Takasu said the units sell for approximately $ 2 million . His company moves three or four units per year to Japanese and Argentine petroleum and oil-tank cleaning companies , he said . But Takasu has also made some mistakes . In 1983 , after exporting American-made cars for about 10 years , he got involved in a joint_venture importing a new , Japanese , three-wheel vehicle , the Zoe Zipper Personal Transportation Vehicle . The cars sold for less than $ 3 # 000 and got 112 miles per gallon . He imported about 300 of the cars . But the product liability insurance was so great because the car was so tiny , Takasu said , that he couldn ' t afford to import them . The cars eventually were sold as novelty vehicles to collectors . Charles Swanberg is one of Takasu ' s employees . &quot; He likes to know the people he does business with . I knew him for three years before he hired me. &quot; Takasu hired Swanberg , a half-Japanese , half-American native Californian , a year ago to pilot the development of the company ' s first product for the United States . Patrol Guard is a bullet-resistant , removable car_window that Swanberg said is the first such product available to the consumer . Takasu came_up with the idea after the 1992 riots . Initial plans were to market the protective windows -- which clamp to car_door frames with brackets and industrial strength Velcro -- to the Los Angeles Police_Department . But with a price_tag of $ 495 per window , department officials said they couldn ' t afford them . Swanberg said Toyota inquired about installing the custom-made windows in its vans they use to shuttle executives around Los Angeles , and a Czech exporter wants to market them to clients in East Asia . But so far , not one unit has sold . Car_dealers , like Auto Stiegler Inc. in Encino , a Mercedes-Benz dealership that briefly had a Patrol Guard window on display , said they ' re loath to push an accessory that stirs customers ' fears about owning an expensive car in a high-crime city . &quot; There ' s no corporate hierarchy . If something works , we keep it going . If not , we try something different , &quot; Swanberg said . One key in doing business with Japan today , Takasu said , is to recognize the Japanese have been money savers for decades -- and now are beginning to spend . The average Japanese citizen , he said , has &quot; $ 60 # 000 in the bank . They have been saving for years . Now , they can afford nice things . It is a good time for a business like mine. &quot;</TEXT>
