   <HEADLINE> SEASON OF WOES ; FEDERAL INVESTIGATION TOPS THE LIST OF SUMMER DISASTERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Craig Underwood has a tough time remembering why he once dared to hope . * His hope was always cautious , always tempered -- expressed in a half-sprung smile , as close to optimism as a farmer can come . But even that most tentative nudge toward hope now looks reckless . For this summer has been utterly woeful . Underwood and his partners -- grower Jim Roberts and sales manager Minos Athanassiadis -- are reeling . Their 60-acre investment , a rich field tucked just west of the Conejo Grade , has crumbled into calamity . After a hardscrabble fall , a break-even winter and a promising spring , it ' s been a disastrous summer . The corn crop lost money . The neighbors threatened lawsuits . And federal investigators cranked_up a probe that could cost the partners their farm . &quot; I think I ' m going_to crawl into a hole , &quot; Underwood said , his voice bleak on a bright summer day . &quot; I want to disappear. &quot; The sons and grandsons of farmers , all three partners recognized the risks when they mortgaged other landholdings in the spring of 1993 to buy the tumbledown plot of Ventura County land dubbed Conejo Ranch . Their venture seemed stubborn , even naive -- they were launching a farm while , all around them , growers sought to unload land to wealthy developers . Nationwide , about 2 million acres of farmland vanish each year . Ventura County , too , has succumbed to suburban sprawl : outlet malls , movie_theaters and plaintive &quot; For Sale &quot; signs have sprouted on the fertile Oxnard Plain . So the Conejo Ranch partners knew they were bucking a trend . They expected challenges . They expected setbacks . But they never expected a federal probe . * Investigators from the Environmental Protection Agency suspect the partners may have destroyed a wetland when they bulldozed a thicket of wild plants in the summer of 1993 as they prepared to transform Conejo Ranch from a scraggly swamp into a tidy farm . &quot; We think wetlands may have been involved on this site , which means the farmers would have required a permit ( to begin clear-cutting ) , &quot; EPA attorney Jessica Kao said . &quot; This particular site concerns us because it was a fairly good area for various kinds of wildlife. &quot; Indeed , when the partners bought the field outside Camarillo , taking_out loans to cover the $ 420 # 000 price_tag , they found several quails scurrying among the brush . They heard talk_of a mountain_lion skulking through the mesquite . And their mascot mutt , Lucy , emerged from an exploratory romp crawling with ticks . Scattered about the field , several low-lying pockets sagged into quicksand-like pools of silty muck . &quot; You could fish crawdads there , &quot; Jim Roberts recalled . Some of the moisture could be attributed to simple geography -- Conejo Ranch sits in a flood plain and collects runoff from surrounding hills . The field also boasts an unusually high_water table . But Underwood thought most of the puddles had dribbled onto Conejo Ranch by accident . In the late 1980s , he said , the culvert draining water from a nearby lemon grove had ruptured , diverting the flow toward Conejo Ranch . As the field had been abandoned nearly a decade earlier , no one bothered to repair the culvert or clear_away the sprouting vegetation . So Conejo Ranch , soggy and untended , evolved into a swamp . So what ? The land had been devoted to agriculture for more_than a century : first as a cattle pasture and , later , as a vegetable farm . Clearly , Conejo Ranch was meant to be cultivated , the partners reasoned -- even if they had to install an underground drainage_system to suck moisture from the gooey soil . No one ever imagined that the fertile 60-acre swath might be considered a wetland . Someone probably should have . * Whether fed by an underground spring or a leaky air conditioner , any moist patch of ground can be classified as a wetland -- as long as its plants , hydrology and soil meet certain scientific criteria . The Clean Water Act , which gives the government jurisdiction over wetlands , does not distinguish between natural and artificial swamps . &quot; Not to get too lyrical or mystical about it , &quot; local environmentalist Neil Moyer explained , &quot; but given half a chance , Mother Nature will reclaim ( agriculture land for ) wetlands. &quot; Because the partners razed the vegetation and churned the soil on Conejo Ranch last summer , EPA investigators have had trouble determining whether the field meets scientific standards that define wetlands . Conejo Ranch could have been a teeming riparian habitat before the farmers moved_in to tame it . On the other hand , it could have been simply a tumbledown , waterlogged lot . EPA biologist Aaron Setran will have to make the call . With all_the zeal of investigators collecting blood samples in the O.J. Simpson case , Setran rooted through Conejo Ranch in late July , digging_up spoonfuls of soil and shreds of roots . Preserved in plastic bags in his San Francisco office , the samples will provide Setran with the clues that could determine Conejo Ranch ' s fate . To reach a decision , Setran will scrutinize the dirt for classic signs of wetlands : clay particles , orange streaks of oxidized iron , root specks from riparian plants . He will also pore over aerial photos of the site before and after the partners began farming . And he will review , again , the site ' s long history . Setran plans to announce his conclusions by the end of September . The verdict should wrap_up the investigation . It could also launch the recrimination . * The harshest outcome : a criminal trial . The EPA could file a complaint accusing the partners of knowingly destroying a wetland , a violation of the federal Clean Water Act . If the partners resist the EPA , the agency could levy an &quot; administrative penalty &quot; of up_to $ 125 # 000 , plus criminal penalties of $ 50 # 000 a day and civil penalties of $ 25 # 000 a day . No investigator expects such severe punishment . But the next , lesser , level of penalties would hit the farmers nearly as hard : The government could force them to pull_out the Conejo Ranch crops and restore the field to its natural_state . The EPA would boot_out the existing crops only if scientists were certain the parcel could bloom into a thriving riparian ecosystem . A duck pond or two would n ' t do the trick . The land ' s long history as a cattle-trampled , tractor-tilled farm also works in the growers ' favor . Far from pristine , the soil &quot; may_not have had as high a value &quot; as an untouched swamp , even in its heyday , said biologist Cat Brown of the U . S . Fish &amp; Wildlife Service . &quot; So the penalty , if one is assessed , may_not be as steep , &quot; she added . Instead of directing the farmers to abandon their field , the EPA might order them to pay penance by enhancing a wetland elsewhere in Ventura County . &quot; We need to determine what ' s good for the environment and what ' s equitable under the circumstances , &quot; EPA attorney Kao said . &quot; There ' s no reason to require them to spend an obscene amount_of_money ( restoring the field ) if we ' re not going_to get an environment of the quality we ' re looking_for , &quot; Kao said . Such talk reassures the partners -- somewhat . &quot; I have to believe it will work_out , &quot; Jim Roberts said , with conviction born of desperation . But farmers who have tangled_with the EPA warn that wetlands problems rarely just work_out . &quot; A wetlands designation is like getting your property declared a national_park , as far as future use and property values go , &quot; Fresno County rancher Shawn Stevenson said . The government ' s jurisdiction over wetlands nettles the powerful national farm lobby -- primarily because growers complain that bone-dry earth is sometimes labeled a protected &quot; water of the United States , &quot; based on analysis of plant roots or soil composition . And once a government scientist declares a parcel wetlands , farmers say , the designation is hard to shake . &quot; We ' ve brought soil scientists , professors , anyone we could possibly tackle to come look_at our land ( and judge whether it ' s a wetland ) , &quot; said Rhode Island farmer Bill Stamp . &quot; The thing is , ( the government ) has the dollars -- your tax dollars -- and the time . They go_after who they want , when they want. &quot; Stamp , who ' s trying to clear his former cornfield of a decade-old wetland designation , added : &quot; I still salute the flag . But I ' ll tell you , I think twice. &quot; * While farmers ensnared in wetland disputes tend to paint the government ecologists as sinister , land-grabbing foes , environmentalists praise the EPA for guarding rare habitat . &quot; This area ' s wetland status . . . predated its use in agriculture by a millennium , &quot; said Greg Helms of the Environmental Defense Center in Santa Barbara . With up_to 360 # 000 acres of wetlands falling to plows or pavement each year , environmentalists seek to protect every remaining riparian chunk . &quot; When a wetland ' s destroyed , you lose not only the wetland , but an incredible accumulation of biological diversity . And you lose not just individual animals , but whole lineages , &quot; explained Mark Holmgren , a curator at UC Santa Barbara ' s vertebrate museum . Underwood can understand the argument . But he ' s still bewildered about its application on his ranch . &quot; We ' re losing so many wetlands , and once they ' re paved over , you can ' t get them back , so I suppose they have to investigate , &quot; he said . &quot; They have to protect our habitat . But in our case , there was really nothing to protect. &quot; The farmers ' battle with the EPA sags under the weight of an age-old conflict : agriculture versus the environment . Their second agony of the summer , a protracted fight over their compost heap , could be summed_up with equally stark polarity : agriculture versus the suburbs . * The problem flared in early August , when residents of eastern Camarillo caught a gut-churning whiff of the decaying compost heap stashed at the far end of Conejo Ranch . A cornucopia of half-rotted vegetables piled high along 300-foot rows , the compost heap resembled a macabre banquet , a feast for a giant with a taste for decaying fiber . More to_the_point , it stunk . Even from a mile away , residents of Camarillo ' s Leisure Village and Fairfield neighborhoods could smell the tangy , musky , caustic fumes . At times , the odor turned vaguely chemical , with a tinge of burned plastic . Some contended the stench could wake them from a dead slumber . Others blamed it for scratchy throats or stuffed-up noses . Still others spoke_of gripping nausea . They dreaded evenings , when the fumes would wrap around their houses , sneaking_in any window or door left ajar . Simply put , Camarillo resident Andrew Harman said , &quot; It ' s horrendous. &quot; The smell haunted Underwood too . With every complaint , he despaired anew . &quot; We don ' t want to be bad neighbors , &quot; he said , miserably . &quot; And we don ' t want to jeopardize composting in this county. &quot; In fact , few farmers in Ventura County compost on the same scale . Underwood Ranches hauls lemon_peels and avocado pits from local packinghouses to several fields across Ventura County . The partners then add their own processing plant ' s waste -- limp carrots , brittle corn husks , wilted radishes . Finally , they toss_in shredded paper , sprinkling purple , green and white shards on the weirdly vibrant piles . The system has proved both cost-effective and environment-friendly over the years . The packinghouses save big bucks , because Underwood Ranches charges only a tenth of the standard fee for dumping trash in a landfill . The farmers cut costs by reducing their dependence on commercial fertilizer . And taxpayers get the satisfaction of knowing that several hundred tons of waste are diverted from space-crunched landfills each day . * But that win-win-win equation can crumble abruptly if the compost heap ' s biochemical balance falters . that ' s what happened on Conejo Ranch this summer . Somehow , the oxygen pockets in the compost heap collapsed , leaving only anaerobic bacteria to gnaw away at the waste . Unable to fully break_down the material , anaerobic bacteria exhale vinegar , alcohol and hydrogen_sulfide after every meal . These are the same anaerobic bacteria that cause foul smells to accumulate in clogged-up sink drains and human bowels . So you can imagine the stench when billions of the stinky critters invade an enormous compost heap . &quot; You have to take a bath when you get home , that ' s for_sure , &quot; field worker Agustin Garcia said with a wry smile after working amid the stench for six hours straight . To cut the fumes , Underwood tried covering the compost piles with plastic tarp . That didn ' t work . An attempt to balance the biochemical stew by adding shredded paper also flopped . And even when Underwood delivered gifts of fresh produce , he failed to pacify the neighbors . &quot; We want it gone , &quot; Harman fumed , after rounding_up 80 anti-compost signatures and threatening a lawsuit . &quot; This has got_to stop. &quot; Underwood had hoped to leave the pile on Conejo Ranch through Thanksgiving , at least , until the waste decomposed enough to be spread as fertilizer . But he could not stomach the complaints . At a cost of $ 7 # 000 , he hauled the pile to another of his fields , this one a parcel off Pleasant Valley Road with no neighbors nearby . Gloomy , Underwood announced : &quot; We raised the white_flag and we ' re turning our tails in defeat. &quot; To make moods even worse , the corn crop was losing money all summer long . The farmers had gambled big on corn this year , increasing their plantings five-fold . Now the chance of a payoff was slim . &quot; This has been the worst year in 20 or more , &quot; Underwood said . &quot; Most people cannot remember such a depressed market lasting so_long . It started in November and it ' s still going. &quot; The dismal prices dragged_down business even though the partners have finally , after three years of research , perfected machines to harvest and process their Somis Creek brand corn . No longer do workers trudge through the humid fields , hands scuffed by rough husks , throats dry from swirling pollen . Technology , speedy and efficient , has taken_over the drudgery . Crashing through the field , attacking each row in turn , the harvester performs with violent precision . The mighty machine grabs each stalk , plucks out the corn and hurls the ears through a stocky conveyor_belt , spewing stray leaves like a frustrated gambler scattering a deck of cards . Miraculously unbruised , the corn bumps down a metal chute and drops into a plastic bin hauled by a second tractor . Partner Jim Roberts won ' t say publicly how much money he saves with the contraption . Trade_secret , he says with a grin . But the harvester demands only two workers at a time , and they charge through each row pretty quickly , driving their tractors side_by_side in clumsy choreography . * Once the ears are harvested , they ' re shuttled to Underwood Ranches ' cooler , where they chill in a refrigerated room . Next , they shoot through the corn processor . In a_few noisy seconds , corn ears are stripped , trimmed , packaged and wrapped as they jostle through a series of conveyor_belts . Backed by the harvester and processor -- $ 80 # 000 worth of innovation -- the farmers at Underwood Ranches had hoped to command a sizable share of the corn market . As hounds Roy and Lucy snuffled underfoot , the partners gathered_in an airless kitchenette last spring to discuss their prospects . Relaxing their characteristic caution just a smidgen , they spoke almost hopefully . They dreamed of a bumper year . Instead , they got the dreadful summer that ' s just now wrapping_up . The first inklings of trouble came_in mid-June , when the Conejo Ranch corn began to &quot; silk , &quot; sending_out sticky , slender yellow-brown hairs . From afar , the field seemed a flawless golden carpet , framed by a snaggletooth row of eucalyptus_trees , a shrub-blotted mountain and the distant glint of cars winding along the Conejo Grade . Up close , the rows of furry tassels beckoned alluringly , proud pennants of a ripening crop . Majestic . But misleading . Craig Underwood knew , just from looking , that the corn would n ' t ripen in time for the critical opening-season week leading_up to Fourth_of_July . Sure enough , the stubborn plants -- whose growth was retarded by a spell of cloudy weather -- matured after the holiday . By then , people had eaten their fill of corn . The market had gone bust . * With no buyers in_sight , the partners didn ' t even bother sending their harvester to Conejo Ranch . They left nearly three acres at the field ' s northwest corner for the birds , the white and yellow kernels swelling slowly inside snug green husks . &quot; It ' s tough on us , &quot; Athanassiadis said , &quot; to have to leave super-sweet corn for ducks. &quot; Disappointment turned_to downright dejection days later , when the produce buyer for a major supermarket decided not to stock the Underwood Ranches ' corn , although he had once discussed purchasing $ 3 # 000 worth of corn a day . Another deal also fell_through , costing the partners about $ 4 # 500 a day . &quot; Talk is cheap , &quot; Athanassiadis said grimly . Later , he added : &quot; We ' ve got what literally feels_like a noose around our necks to sell the product. &quot; An unexpected contract with the Trader Joe ' s chain of upscale groceries looked_like a potential savior in early August . But that deal soon soured , as Trader Joe buyers decided they would not stock any product with foam packaging -- including Somis Creek corn . Stuck with more corn than they could sell , the farmers donated bushels to a local food_bank . They tossed fat , juicy ears on their ill-fated compost heap . And they left another patch of bursting-ripe corn to wither in the field . All told , they wrote_off more_than $ 12 # 000 worth of harvested corn . They didn ' t even bother to tally the value of the stalks abandoned to the birds . As the summer ground on , Athanassiadis looked_at the ledger books with mounting dismay -- knowing that a run of red ink would crimp his plans to introduce two new products this fall . He had planned on pushing Rainbow Radishes , a six-ounce bag of salad-ready radishes in vibrant hues of purple , pink , red and white . He had also hoped to unveil creamy spring potatoes , small and round with flaky , tender skin . * But without seed money from the corn crop , he ' d have to put everything on hold . &quot; We basically have to see how much money we have in the bank at the end of the season -- it ' s frustrating , &quot; Athanassiadis said , poking_at the tan and purple potato label he had been tinkering with for months . &quot; You get going , then you have to stop , then you go again , then you stop . To the extent that we have good ideas , our business will succeed . But to the extent that we have limited money , we ' re held_back on our good ideas . It hurts. &quot; Because they grow sweet_corn through Christmas -- long after other farmers have switched to vegetables -- the partners do have a shot at recouping some of their summer losses with strong end-of-season sales . But with all that ' s gone_wrong this summer , they ' re hesitant to hope . History of the Field The Environmental Protection Agency is investigating whether Craig Underwood and his partners may have destroyed a wetland when they started farming Conejo Ranch in the summer of 1993 . The partners contend the 60-acre field , which is zoned for agricultural use , never harbored a wetland . Throughout the 19th Century , the land now called Conejo Ranch served as pasture for beef_cattle . Adolfo Camarillo owned the parcel during his lifetime , from 1888 to 1958 , and let his cows range through the tall grass . Several pools on the land attracted wildfowl . After Camarillo ' s death , the land was sold to a developer . A plan to build 250 homes there was rejected by the city of Camarillo . So the land was rented to local ranchers , who grew vegetables throughout the 1970s . A great flood_in 1979 wiped_out the row crops , and the land lay idle for a_few years . In the early 1980s , ranchers brought_back cattle to graze on the wild grasses . By the mid-1980s , the cattle had been removed , and the 60-acre parcel lay fallow . Willow_trees , mesquite brush and other scrubby plants soon covered the swamp like expanse . A family of mountain_lions prowled through the land , and quails nested among the brambles . The Underwood Ranches partners bought the land in the spring of 1993 . After checking with the state_Department of Fish and Game and the Ventura County Flood_Control District , they cleared the brush with bulldozers and installed an underground system to drain excess water . They then leveled the soil and planted mixed greens . Over the summer , they grew sweet_corn and built a compost heap . They plan a fall crop of carrots .</TEXT>
