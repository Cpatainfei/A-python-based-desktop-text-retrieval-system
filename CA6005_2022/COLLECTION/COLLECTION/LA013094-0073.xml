   <HEADLINE> BEHIND THE CHIAPAS REVOLT : AN ARMY ALLOWED TO OPERATE OUTSIDE THE LAW ; MEXICO : EXECUTIONS AND TORTURE ARE THE SOLDIERS ' TOOLS TO RESTORE ORDER . THE U.S. can ' t JUST SIT TIGHT AND COMPLAIN ABOUT RIGHTS VIOLATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reports of executions and torture of captives in Chiapas are but the latest examples of abuses carried_out by the Mexican armed forces . Compounding the problem is the imprisonment of a brigadier_general who dared suggest the military should respect human_rights . The army ' s abuses highlight the danger of allowing any institution to operate outside the law . The continuation of these abuses in Mexico , and elsewhere in Latin_America , requires the United States to reappraise its hemispheric human-rights policy as it prepares_for economic integration with the region . Armies are supposed to protect the peace -- not the Mexican army . It has instigated rebellion through two decades of repression in Chiapas . Significantly , one of the first acts of the Zapatista rebels was to kidnap Absalon Castellanos , a retired general . As commander of the 31st military zone in Chiapas in the early 1980s , Castellanos was notorious for repressing the Mayan population . Among their memories is the Golonchan massacre of June , 1980 . Tiring of interminable delays , Tzeltal Mayans , who had already been granted titles , took possession of their lands . The state ' s powerful land barons called_on the government to dislodge them . Through the mediation of a priest , the governor of Chiapas agreed to expedite the land transfers and meet with the Tzeltals . But it was not the governor who showed_up on June 15 ; it was Castellanos ' troops , who slaughtered the Tzeltals , including women and children . Two years later , Mexico ' s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) rewarded Castellanos with the governorship of Chiapas . Castellanos was succeeded , in 1988 , by Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido , who continued the repressive policies of his predecessor . Last January , President Carlos Salinas de Gortari named Gonzalez secretary of government , the second most powerful post in the Mexican hierarchy . The appointment was widely interpreted as heralding a harder line toward discontent in rural Mexico . As it turns_out , there has been a disturbing increase in the deployment of troops in the Mayan Highlands of Chiapas during the past year . In a report published last August , a team of investigators from Minnesota Advocates for Human_Rights described a pattern of abuses by the military in precisely the area that has become the focal_point of today ' s insurrection . Following the disappearance of two army_officers last spring , troops occupied several villages , detaining , beating and torturing civilians . The report also documented similar abuses against the populations of villages in the state of Chihuahua , on the U.S. border . Despite national and international exposure , none of the officers responsible have been disciplined . Instead , the army ' s high_command has imprisoned Brig . Gen . Francisco Gallardo for his human-rights advocacy . Citing mistreatment of civilians in rural Mexico , among other offenses , Gallardo proposed creation of a human-rights ombudsman for the armed forces . The proposal has gone nowhere . In the absence of reform , the Mexican army is responding to the uprising in Chiapas in the exact manner that helped provoke the insurrection there . Villages are being bombed , rebels executed after capture and suspected sympathizers tortured to extract confessions . What happened after the army seized the village of Oxchuc , in the Mayan Highlands , epitomizes the dangers of military involvement in civilian affairs . Accompanied by officers , the mayor toured the town , fingering supporters of opposition parties . The soldiers took the civilians away , accusing them of subversion . Such collusion between the army and the ruling party leaves dissidents few options but insurrection . The need for a re-evaluation of the role of the armed forces in Mexico , and , by extension , in other Latin_American societies , is clear . With the demise of the Soviet_Union , the United States no longer faces any credible military threat in the Americas . Nor does Mexico . That reduces the Mexican army to the role of a police_force engaged in combatting drug smuggling and maintaining domestic order . Therein lies a problem . Armies are trained to fight invading enemies . When used as domestic police_forces , they have an unfortunate tendency to treat their fellow citizens as &quot; the enemy. &quot; In 1968 , the Mexican army turned tanks and automatic weapons on a peaceful gathering of student protesters in Mexico_City , killing hundreds . During the following years , hundreds of suspected dissidents were kidnaped by the army ' s white brigades and executed at a military base on the outskirts of the capital . In rural Guerrero , the army made little distinction between civilians and combatants in suppressing a small insurgency . Such brutalization has political consequences . The urban repression has created an underground intelligentsia ; the repression in the countryside , widespread discontent . These two forces have come_together to form a guerrilla movement that is attracting support from Indians and peasants across southern Mexico . If reports of recent guerrilla mobilizations in Guerrero prove accurate , the challenge to the Mexican government could be far more serious than first suspected . Economic integration cannot succeed in an atmosphere of corruption , repression and conflict . If the nations of the hemisphere are to inaugurate a successful economic partnership , it will have to be_on the basis of a common foundation of democracy , public accountability and respect for human_rights . The Clinton_Administration thus needs to follow_through on its pledge to make democracy and human_rights the &quot; cornerstone &quot; of its foreign_policy . It can begin by asking the U.S. Senate to ratify the American Convention on Human_Rights , which has already been ratified by every Latin_American country , except Cuba . Ratification would enable Washington to insist on enforcement of the convention ' s provisions as a condition for aid and for access to the regime created by the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . For its part , the Mexican government should signal its seriousness in pursuing reform and reconciliation by withdrawing its troops from Chiapas and by disciplining its officers who violate human_rights .</TEXT>
