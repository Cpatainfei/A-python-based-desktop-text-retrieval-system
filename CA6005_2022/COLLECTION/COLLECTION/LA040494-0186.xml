   <HEADLINE> BEIJING TO GET LOOK_AT IMPORTED CARS ; CHINA : COUNTRY ' S FIRST SHOWROOM FOR FOREIGN MAKES IS SEEN AS KEY TO TURNING THE AUTO INTO A COMMON TOOL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Beijing ' s first public showroom for imported cars opens this week , an important step_in turning the car from a tool of privilege into an ordinary commodity . The showroom , run_by Beijing CIM Automall Co. , a subsidiary of the CIM Corp . of Hong Kong , will display cars by six foreign makers : Ferrari , Audi , Honda , Lancia , Volkswagen and Mitsubishi . Wednesday ' s opening will have the usual pizazz of motor marketing , elegant women draped over gleaming new cars , a lion dance , speeches by dignitaries and dozens of television and still cameras . &quot; We want the showroom to be a window for Chinese on the world auto market and for foreign makers on the Chinese market , &quot; said Philip Yang , general_manager of Beijing CIM . Like other companies , foreign car_makers are keenly watching the Chinese market but low incomes , a shortage of foreign_exchange and limited road space have made_it a limited market that till now has been strictly controlled . For the 45 years of communist rule , imported cars have been a perquisite zealously guarded by the authorities and rationed through quotas , permits and high taxes . A chauffeur-driven ride in an Audi or Nissan limousine or , even better , a Mercedes Benz or a BMW , has been a sign of high rank and privilege , not something bought with mere money . In many government jobs , car privileges have been part of the package , with low officials scrambling to put bookings in at the car pool while higher-ranking cadres secure exclusive use of_their_own state vehicles . But this is changing , and the showroom is part of this change . The government wants to make cars more like other commodities , so people can buy them if they have the money without elaborate approval procedures , which have been widely abused . The Materials Ministry announced earlier this year seven policies aimed at encouraging individuals to buy cars with their own money , and reducing illegal purchases by bureaucrats using public money . An official for the production section of the China National Auto Industry Corp . said it had become easier for individuals to buy locally made cars , with only money and an introduction letter from a company or work-unit needed . &quot; Buying an imported car remains more difficult and needs a license . But it is easier now than it was one or two years ago , &quot; she said . To normalize the market , the government on Jan . 1 lopped 70 percentage_points off car import tariffs , leaving large models taxable at 150 % and small and medium-sized models taxable at 110 % . While this still means that an imported Toyota can cost more_than $ 50 # 000 , it marked an important step toward making such cars more affordable . Beijing also dropped a concession that enabled Sino-foreign joint_ventures to bring_in imported cars tax-free , a privilege widely abused by businessmen who often set_up joint_ventures solely for the purpose of using their car quotas . An official of a Japanese car_maker said that , in_line with its application to rejoin the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , China is cutting the import tariffs and the paperwork needed to buy imported cars . &quot; But China is still short of foreign_exchange , which means that it cannot liberalize the market completely , &quot; he said . Official figures show ownership of passenger_cars in China at 1.2 million at the end of 1993 , 70 % of them imports , most used actually or nominally for business . China produced 1.31 million motor_vehicles in 1993 , up 22.8 % from 1992 , of which 234 # 000 were cars . Last year China officially imported 310 # 000 cars , up from 210 # 000 in 1992 , with an enormous number smuggled in . Beijing taxi drivers say that a smuggled car can be bought , complete with the necessary official forms , at a considerable discount from the price of a legal import and that officials are often involved in the racket . The reason car ownership in China is less than 1 / 10 of the world average is that prices are more_than double world levels while incomes are a fraction of the world average . The average urban resident in 1993 earned $ 270 , although incomes in major cities are several times higher , while a small number of people earn tens of thousands of yuan -- or thousands of U . S . dollars -- a year . The cheapest local car is the Charade , made under a joint_venture with Daihatsu of Japan and costing $ 10 # 574 , while a Santana , made under a joint_venture with Volkswagen of Germany , costs $ 18 # 700 . An imported Toyota Crown costs $ 46 # 000 to $ 56 # 500 .</TEXT>
