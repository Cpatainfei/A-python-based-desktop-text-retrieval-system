   <HEADLINE> RULING COULD BOOST CHINESE IMMIGRATION ; BIRTH_CONTROL : FEDERAL JUDGE SAYS BEIJING ' S STRICT POLICY VIOLATES A BASIC HUMAN_RIGHT . IF THAT INTERPRETATION HOLDS_UP , EXPERTS SAY , MORE CHINESE MAY WIN LEGAL REFUGE HERE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the Chinese government ordered the sterilization of Guo Chun Di and his wife as part of a population-control crackdown , the 29-year-old farmer decided to run_away . He hopped a freighter and fled to the United States -- &quot; a freedom country , &quot; he said . He had paid a smuggler $ 5 # 000 for a spot on the boat and spent four months at_sea . But as soon as he arrived in New York in June , on board the ill-fated Golden Venture , Guo was put behind bars , winding_up in a jail in Winchester , Va . He was about to be deported . Then along came a federal judge in Alexandria , Va. , who gave him another chance . In a decision that specialists say could encourage a new_wave of Chinese immigration and trigger more lawsuits for asylum , U.S. District Judge T . S . Ellis III ruled that China ' s population-control strategy is political persecution , a violation of a basic human_right . The policy has been criticized for using sterilization and abortion to enforce the country ' s one-child-per-family rule . Although Ellis ' ruling did not grant Guo political asylum , it ordered immigration officials to review his case and consider the family-planning issue when deciding whether to send him back to China . Meanwhile , Guo remains in jail , dreaming that one day his wife and daughter will be able to join him in the United States , according to his lawyer , Timothy S . Burgett . Guo , who has six years of schooling , &quot; knows we ' ve won a victory . But he doesn ' t understand , if he won , why he ' s still in jail , &quot; Burgett said . Although Ellis ' Jan . 14 opinion is not binding on dozens of similar cases pending in federal_courts across the nation , human-rights advocates described the decision as a breakthrough in recognizing China ' s family-planning policy as a legitimate basis for granting political asylum . Those who seek to limit immigration view it as a dangerous invitation to illegal aliens . &quot; This is an extremely important opinion , a trailblazing opinion , because this is the first federal judge to rule on this issue , &quot; said Craig Trebilcock , an immigration lawyer who is seeking asylum for 22 Chinese refugees jailed in York , Pa . &quot; There can tend to be a domino effect in these matters. &quot; But Dan Stein , executive_director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform , called the judge ' s decision &quot; a disaster &quot; and added , &quot; We ' re sending a message back to China : You ' re going to get in. &quot; The ruling raises moral and public-policy questions at a time when the Clinton_Administration ' s policy on Chinese refugees is under review . The issue has generated debate at the White_House , Justice_Department , Immigration and Naturalization Service and State_Department as well as in Congress . Among the key questions is how far this country should go_to grant relief to Chinese who want more_than one child . Guo Chun Di ' s story is similar to those of other Chinese refugees seeking asylum for family reasons . He told authorities that he came_to the United States in desperation . &quot; China has no freedom , &quot; Guo told an immigration judge last summer . &quot; I only have one child . I want to have two more children , but they won ' t let me . I ' m afraid that if they find me , they will take me to get sterilized. &quot; Two other Chinese men who sailed with Guo on the Golden Venture have cases pending at the Alexandria courthouse : Yang Cheng Huan , 26 , who said his wife was sterilized two years ago after giving_birth to their second child , and Chen Zhao Chai , 41 , who said he was fined and sterilized for fathering two children . His wife was forced to have an abortion in 1992 to prevent a third birth , he said . Guo , Yang and Chen declined to be interviewed after requests were made through their lawyers . China has come under international criticism for its population-control policy . The Chinese government says the policy , pursued since 1979 , is necessary so that population growth doesn ' t wreck the economy . The world ' s most populous nation , China has nearly 1.2 billion people . Compliance with the policy is encouraged by education , economic incentives and stronger measures such_as fines and demotions . Although abortions and sterilization are not officially mandated , they continue to occur , most often in remote rural_areas . The number of children a couple is allowed to have before being penalized varies by region .</TEXT>
