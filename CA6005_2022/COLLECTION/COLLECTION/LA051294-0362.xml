   <TEXT> A former employee of the Beverly Hills Unified School District has filed a lawsuit alleging racial discrimination and harassment by the district and sexual_harassment by a school_board member . The suit was filed May 2 in Los Angeles Superior_Court , by Janeese M . Bland , a former secretarial_assistant in the personnel_department . She seeks $ 375 # 000 in lost pay and damages and unspecified punitive damages . The district has denied the allegations . Board_member Phillip Harris &quot; categorically denied &quot; Bland ' s charges . &quot; I ' ve always acted in the best interest of the school district and I will continue to do so , &quot; he said . Harris declined to comment further . Bland , an African American , had worked for the district less than six months when she was dismissed April 23 , 1993 . The district said Bland was fired for poor job performance . Bland alleged her dismissal resulted from her complaints to Supt . Sol Levine that her supervisor , personnel director Ray Cutten , subjected her to &quot; racial harassment . . . in the form of racial slurs about blacks and Mexican Americans in_general , and racial comments about specific minority employees who worked for the district. &quot; Bland said Cutten gave her poor performance evaluations and criticized her work habits after her complaints to Levine . Cutten finally ordered her to resign or face dismissal , the complaint states . Levine is out of town and could not be reached for comment . Cutten and Eric Bathen , attorney for the school district , did not return telephone_calls . The district has denied the allegations since they were first raised last year in Bland ' s complaint with the state_Department of Fair Employment and Housing . The department investigated until January , when Bland asked that the investigation be closed because she was filing a lawsuit . &quot; I have never observed any conduct , nor has it ever been reported to me , that the named employees practiced racial discrimination or harassment of those kind expressed in the complaint , or of any kind , &quot; said board President Lillian Raffel . Concerning the sexual_harassment complaint against Harris , Raffel said he would &quot; have to speak_for himself. &quot; Bland said Harris made improper advances toward her last spring after she invited him to her apartment to discuss the racial complaints . She contends Harris made sexually offensive remarks , attempted to gain sexual favors and partially disrobed . Harris , a board_member since 1991 , said he visited Bland but denied sexually harassing her . Harris ' attorney , Mark Terman , said Harris plans to reiterate his request that the board pay_for his defense . In November , when the fair employment and housing complaint was pending , the board voted not to pay Harris ' legal expenses , despite his contention that he was acting in the role of board_member when he went_to speak_to Bland .
