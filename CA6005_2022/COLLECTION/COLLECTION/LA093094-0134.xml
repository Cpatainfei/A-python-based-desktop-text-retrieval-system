   <HEADLINE> DOWN TO EARTH ; JPL RADAR PROJECT ON SHUTTLE SETS ITS SIGHTS HOMEWARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Outer space is the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory ' s usual playground , where its planetary probes rendezvous with asteroids , piggyback on the solar_wind and zip to the fringes of the solar_system . But these days , the NASA agency ' s high-tech wizardry is rediscovering an old_world -- planet Earth . In an unlikely twist for a space agency , JPL ' s new Spaceborne Imaging Radar , or SIR-C , is turning its focus homeward as part of NASA ' s Mission to Planet Earth , a $ 1-billion project created to study the global environment on what scientists say is an unprecedented scale . Starting today , the $ 360-million radar system embarks aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on the second of three trips to send_back striking images from our own back yard : a tropical_rain_forest in Mexico , volcanoes in the western Galapagos Islands , and the habitat of endangered mountain_gorillas in war-torn Rwanda . &quot; We just cannot wait until most of the tropical forests are gone before we do something about it , &quot; said Charles Elachi , assistant lab director of JPL in Pasadena . &quot; We cannot wait until the ozone_layer is mostly destroyed before we do something about it . . . . If we are to be a good custodian of our planet for the next generation , or the generation after that , we must really understand what we ' re doing to our planet. &quot; * SIR-C is unique in its ability to work_on three frequencies , allowing scientists to probe an area with three different looks_at the same image . SIR-C is the world ' s most advanced civilian radar , capable of penetrating clouds , vegetation , ice , dry sand , soil and darkness . By comparison , other radars work only on a single frequency . The difference , experts say , is like looking_at an X-ray instead of a photograph . And for the first time , SIR-C will produce high-resolution images of the world as a single ecosystem , showing how land , water , carbon and heat interact . SIR-C ' s projects include a look_at the Sierra_Nevada snowpacks to determine how much water is inside . Eventually , researchers hope to be able to tell how much runoff water is available , how fast the snow melts and how quickly the soil absorbs the water . With that information , farmers could decide which crops are_best to plant and when . In another case , scientists play Indiana Jones , aiming the radar at the once-lost Arabian city of Ubar , probing under the shifting desert sands for clues on what life was like nearly 5 # 000 years ago . The fortress city , celebrated in the Koran and &quot; A Thousand and One Arabian Nights &quot; as a shipping center for frankincense , was discovered in December , 1991 . A Los Angeles-based team of amateur and professional archeologists made the find with the help of another JPL radar system -- a precursor to the one flying_on Endeavour . And from Rwanda , the radar will produce images of the endangered mountain_gorilla ' s mist-shrouded forest , where the shy animals rummage for berries , wild_celery and stinging thistles . Until now , researchers in the remote region have been armed only with outdated maps from the 1950s and handwritten notes from naturalist Dian Fossey , whose story was told in the movie &quot; Gorillas in the Mist. &quot; Fossey , who was murdered in 1985 , used enlarged copies of crude forest maps -- ones that lacked contours -- and marked the gorilla ' s movements with a pen . For the first time , the radar images , along with satellite data , will help researchers make a comprehensive analysis of the gorillas ' movements and habits . &quot; It ' s an incredible difference in terms of the kinds of research questions that can be asked . . . ( instead of ) an individual researcher sitting in the bamboo forest with a Xerox map and a felt-tip pen , &quot; said Scott Madry , a Rutgers University researcher who works with the executive_director of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund . In such cases , the radar casts JPL in an unexpected role as global eco-warrior -- a shift that some say is overdue . &quot; For many of us , even those of us who have a great interest in space , we ' ve been regularly astounded on the amount_of_time ( is spent ) looking beyond our own planet for planetary exploration when there ' s still a lot to learn about our own planet , &quot; said Cynthia Rust , a spokeswoman for Greenpeace in San Francisco . Other projects have focused only on parts of the ecosystem . In 1993 , NASA ' s Nimbus-7 satellite found that global ozone levels were 2 % to 3 % lower than any previous year . In another NASA project , satellite observations confirmed last year that Mt . Pinatubo ' s eruption in June , 1991 , resulted in a temporary cooling of the Earth by about 1 degree . JPL worked_on the radar project with the German and Italian space agencies , which together put_up half the cost ; NASA funded the other half , or $ 180 million . SIR-C ' s 23 # 100-pound antenna is the biggest piece of flight hardware ever built at JPL . * In most cases , SIR-C can peer deep into the Earth -- beneath thick vegetation canopies , through cloud_cover , under desert floors -- and reveal previously inaccessible regions . A 52-member international science team is still studying data from April ' s mission , which probed 5 % of the world ' s land surface , said JPL scientist Diane Evans , the U.S. project leader . In April , the radar flew aboard Endeavour ( results have not yet been released ) and was scheduled to fly again in August over most of the same 400 sites to measure seasonal differences . But a last-minute glitch forced NASA to abort the flight from Cape Canaveral , Fla. , and reschedule the 10-day mission . A third flight is proposed for January , 1996 . The radar ' s targets include last fall ' s Los Angeles burn areas , for a global study on how fires affect vegetation , and the Missouri_River flood areas from 1993 , for research on how the environment recovers from floods . Among the 19 &quot; super sites , &quot; or high-priority targets during the 10-day mission , are four U.S. locations , including Death_Valley ' s Andes Mountains for a study on climate changes . Space exploration is still a NASA priority , but at_the_same_time , NASA Administrator Daniel S . Goldin has named Mission to Planet Earth as one of the agency ' s top five projects . In fact , since the agency began work_on the project in 1991 , 25 % of JPL ' s work has been devoted to it . Besides the radar project , Mission to Planet Earth includes 27 projects through 2000 . Other projects include the use of shuttle-based lasers to study the atmosphere and a radar satellite that will study icebergs and oceanography in the Arctic_Ocean . Earth_science is the fastest growing part of NASA , said Charles Kennel , associate administrator for Mission to Planet Earth , on_leave as a UCLA physics professor . The mission started with a $ 668-million budget ; its 1995 budget is expected to be $ 1.2 billion . NASA is getting more involved in Earth projects as the planet ' s problems worsen , Kennel said . Still , Greenpeace ' s Rust said , NASA is only taking a first_step . &quot; Perhaps , &quot; she said , &quot; the money might be_better spent on cleaning_up some of the messes and developing some of the ecological alternatives to maintaining the ecosystem rather than documenting its decline. &quot;</TEXT>
