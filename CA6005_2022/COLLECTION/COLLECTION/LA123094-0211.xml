   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : BULL ' S-EYE VIEW OF ' 95 RESTS_ON POWER OF THE MEGATRENDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After such a wretched year as this one for stocks and bonds , the only consolation for most investors is to take a long-term view . After all , the market and economy &quot; megatrends &quot; that were so positive a year ago are still in place , aren ' t they ? Wall_Street has been mulling that question in recent weeks , as investment pros fashion their 1995 forecasts for stock prices and interest_rates . For the bullish camp , maintaining optimism is largely a function of belief in the power of certain megatrends to provide a mostly favorable environment for stocks and bonds in the ' 90s . To the bulls , 1994 will wind_up looking_like a hiccup if the megatrends are still valid . But are they ? Here ' s an update on some of the most important trends that Wall_Street touted so vociferously a year ago , before the markets went_into their slump : * Main_Street loves Wall_Street . Individual investors ' appetite for stock and bond mutual_funds was viewed_as almost insatiable a year ago , as short-term interest_rates hit 30-year lows and as &quot; long-term investing &quot; became the mantra of the masses . As long as the public pumped billions monthly into the funds , the bull_markets in_stocks and bonds always had a ready source of new fuel . But the public pump broke_down for bond funds last spring , as rising market interest_rates pummeled bond values and fund investors ' losses mounted . Result : Bond funds have been drained by net shareholder redemptions since last March . In November alone , bond funds ' net new cash flow was a negative $ 10.9 billion , according to figures reported Thursday by the Investment_Company Institute , the funds ' trade group . Now stock funds appear to be suffering a crisis of confidence . Stock funds ' net new cash inflow in November was $ 3 billion , the smallest monthly inflow since August , 1991 , the ICI says . And this month , many mutual_fund companies say stock fund purchases have continued to wane , as high short-term interest_rates lure investors back to bank CDs , Treasury_bills and money_market funds . Because mutual_funds have been such an important source of demand for stocks in particular , Wall_Street ' s fear is that a sustained drop-off in_stock fund purchases -- or worse , a surge in redemptions -- could spell another tumble for the market . January will be a key month to watch , because many investors will be making decisions about where to put 1995 retirement savings . If they shun stocks , this megatrend could be headed for an interruption . * Barton Biggs , investment strategist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. , is bullish on stocks for 1995 as_a_whole , with one caveat : He expects a selloff early on . And he warns , &quot; If the public aggressively redeems equity mutual_funds next year in the same way it redeemed bond funds this year , &quot; any market decline &quot; might last longer than I now think likely. &quot; * Capitalism is spreading worldwide . No doubt about it , this megatrend remains in place . But as investors learned in 1994 , that isn ' t necessarily immediately positive for financial markets . Surprising economic strength worldwide this year , as demand for goods and services boomed , helped send interest_rates rocketing . And as capitalists everywhere clamored for capital , some economists began to contend that long-term interest_rates were bound to stay higher than expected in the 1990s , reflecting a &quot; shortage &quot; of money . That could botch any hopes for a continuing bond rally . For Third_World capitalist_economies like Mexico , meanwhile , concern about a still-wide gap between rich and poor -- and the potential for social unrest -- detracted this year from an otherwise generally bullish long-term outlook for &quot; emerging &quot; stock_markets . Even so , Dean Witter investment strategist William Dodge argues that the capitalism wave &quot; can ' t be bad in the long_run &quot; for investors , especially considering the alternative . And he sees the major industrial companies of the world ' s developed economies , like the United States , as the real near-term winners . &quot; The developed nations will provide the tools ( machinery , technology , etc. ) to the developing nations &quot; to make their economies grow , Dodge says . * Inflation will stay low . It did_in the United States , Europe and Japan in 1994 . U.S. consumer inflation is expected to total a mere 2.7 % for the year , despite the economy ' s boom . Wall_Street credits the highly competitive U.S. economy and increasing competition worldwide , as falling trade_barriers favor low-cost producers . Yet low inflation didn ' t stop long-term bond yields from surging in the United States or Europe -- to the shock of most investment pros . Now most economists expect a slight pickup in inflation in 1995 , in part because a tight U.S. labor_market will help workers negotiate higher wages . The newsletter Blue_Chip Economic Indicators says economists ' consensus estimate for U.S. consumer price inflation in 1995 is 3.4 % . In theory , at least , financial markets are already prepared_for such an uptick . Then again , last February many pros figured that the markets were prepared_for the Federal_Reserve ' s initial credit-tightening move . In retrospect , they weren ' t . In the long_run , there ' s still every reason to bet_on low inflation , experts say . The question near-term is how low is low to Wall_Street . * Small stocks will outperform big stocks . As small-stock indexes beat blue_chip indexes for three straight years from 1991-93 , analysts credited smaller companies ' nimbleness and ability to cash_in_on profitable &quot; niche &quot; demand in the global economy . Many experts predicted that small stocks ' bull_run would last five to eight years -- a typical cycle for them . But the streak has ended . The Russell 2 # 000 index of smaller stocks is down 4.5 % for the year , while the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 index is off just 1.1 % . Prudential Securities analyst Claudia Mott says odds are small stocks ' suffering will last : In 68 years , she says , &quot; There hasn ' t been a cycle in which small stocks outperformed for three years , lagged for a year , and then resumed their leadership position for another year or two. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Losing Faith Net new cash flow into stock mutual_funds plunged in November a the outflow from bond funds ballooned .
