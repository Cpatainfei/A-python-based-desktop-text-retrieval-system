   <TEXT> Yukio Tatsumi wanders down Tuna Street , a deserted lane that dead-ends at a moldering harbor . &quot; This used to be the Takeuchi Pool Hall , &quot; he says . &quot; This was the Mio Restaurant. &quot; He points to an expanse of asphalt piled with steel cargo_containers . &quot; That was our school . This was the Shinto shrine . And this , &quot; he says , staring at a yard of high-voltage lines , &quot; was my house. &quot; To most people , Terminal Island means a slab of landfill in Los Angeles Harbor stinking of fish and diesel_oil , a forbidding landscape of towering cranes , warships , canneries and a federal penitentiary -- the last place anyone would want to call home . But to a group of Angelenos in their 60s to 80s , it ' s a paradise lost , the location of a vanished Japanese American fishing village with a bustling main_street and rows of tiny bungalows decorated with bonsai trees -- the air filled with the shouts of children running barefoot through sandy alleyways . Here , for 3 1 / 2 decades starting in 1906 , a village of about 2 # 500 people flourished and then disappeared , as ephemeral as the shifting sandbars of the bay . It was destroyed in just 48 hours in 1942 . On Feb . 25 of that year , all people of Japanese descent , including American citizens , were evicted from the island at gunpoint . Japan and the United States were at war , and the village known as Fish Harbor was rumored to be a spy colony . While the residents were imprisoned in internment_camps for the next four years , their homes were picked clean , then bulldozed . Their fishing_boats were repossessed or stolen . The nets rotted . The village was never rebuilt . Fish Harbor is not the only Los Angeles enclave of its day that has disappeared . If the Japanese immigrants had Terminal Island in the 1920s , Iowans had Long_Beach . European expatriates were creating a world of_their_own in a rural outpost called Hollywood . Black Los Angeles blossomed on Central Avenue . But those communities have faded_away , absorbed and largely forgotten by the sprawl . In recent years the Iowans , who once drew tens of thousands to their reunions , have barely been able to attract a handful of people . Not so the Terminal Islanders . Half a century after their village disappeared , there are still 778 paying members of the Terminal Islanders Club . This week , they are preparing_for their annual New Year ' s party , scheduled for Sunday , when several hundred people are expected to gather_in Lakewood . Then there are the golf and fishing tournaments , the trips to Las Vegas and the tours of Japan . There ' s even a championship basketball_team made_up of third-generation island descendants . Although they were born long after their parents ' community was destroyed , they call their team the Terminal Islanders . Many older Fish Harbor natives still live_in a village of sorts . They remain best_friends with the people they played with in kindergarten and they live around the corner from each other -- not on the island , itself , but in a neighborhood of Long_Beach marked by the neat bonsai bushes in their front_yards . And they still go_back to visit the island . &quot; Every now and then I go_over just to smell that smell , &quot; says Oihe Charlie Hamasaki , a retired auto mechanic and fisherman . &quot; I call Terminal Island my enchanted island. &quot; It started_out as a sand spit in San Pedro Bay called Rattlesnake Island . After the construction of a bridge and a rail_line , it was re-christened Terminal Island and a fashionable resort named Brighton Beach flourished there in the 1890s . By the 1910s , dredging and landfill projects ruined the beaches and scared_off the tourists . They were replaced by immigrants who became pioneers of America ' s new tuna-canning industry . Some , from Yugoslavia and Italy , settled in San Pedro . The Japanese gathered on Terminal Island . Tsui Murakami arrived in 1918 , when she was 10 . &quot; I thought , this is America ? &quot; she recalls of her first glimpse of her new country : primitive shacks on a sandy coast . By the 1930s , the sand spit was a busy industrial zone that included at least eight canneries , commercial and naval_shipyards , oil tanks , steamship berths and a tile-roofed rail station . There was regular ferry service to San Pedro . Many of the newcomers came from Wakayama prefecture , a poor , remote coastal region in western Japan . As relatives followed , Fish Harbor came_to resemble a Wakayama village transplanted to the California coast . Some of the fishermen summoned &quot; picture brides &quot; from Japan . The women , arriving to marry husbands they ' d never met , often found that the men didn ' t live_up_to the photos they had exchanged . &quot; They were old , and not so handsome , &quot; says Murakami . &quot; Some women ran_away to Los Angeles. &quot; The ones who stayed had to do without their men for weeks at a time as the fishing_boats followed the tuna from Puget Sound to Peru . They ' d chum the water until the sea boiled with fish , then heave 300-pound tuna onto the decks with bamboo poles , three men and three poles to one fish . When the boats came_in , the women rushed to work in the canneries , welcoming the fish home before their husbands . &quot; The whistle would blow at 2 or 3 in the morning , &quot; Murakami says . &quot; Each cannery had a different number of whistles , so you ' d lie_in bed listening for your own . We ' d take a bucket , a knife , apron and gloves , and go. &quot; When the fishermen came_home , they ' d drink and gamble . When they didn ' t come_home , the wives held a funeral with a photo in place of a body . With the fathers at_sea and the mothers at_work , the children practically raised themselves . For them , the island was a small haven where nobody locked their doors , every adult was an &quot; auntie &quot; or &quot; uncle &quot; and every child a co-conspirator in adventure among the sand_dunes and boatyards . They ' d swim across the channel to San Pedro . They ' d swipe wood crates from the canneries and attach them to roller_skates to make primitive skateboards . The Baptist_church sponsored kiddie sumo tournaments . The Buddhist temple sponsored the Boy_Scouts . They ' d play cowboys and Indians -- and samurai warriors , using sticks for swords to imitate the silent Japanese movies shown in the fishermen ' s hall with live narration . The children went_to public_school during the day and Japanese school afterward . The parents built a Japanese garden for the public_school , and so revered its first principal , Mildred O . Walizer , that they raised money to send her on a trip to Japan and asked that the school be named after her . Only at New Year ' s did the island routines come_to a halt . Nobody worked for three days , everyone feasted , and the children received toshidama -- New Year ' s money -- and went_to the Long_Beach Pike amusement_park . The fishing crews would visits their captains ' houses for toasts with sake . &quot; You ' d walk down the street , &quot; Murakami recalls , &quot; and hear their songs coming from the houses. &quot; So it was , in late 1941 , that the village was preparing_for the New Year , stocking up_on rice to pound into mochi cakes and starting the ritual year-end housecleaning . But there would be no celebration . On Dec . 7 , Japan bombed Pearl_Harbor . The islanders heard it on the radio . &quot; Was it around noontime ? &quot; Murakami muses . &quot; They said it was war. &quot; &quot; We were playing poker , &quot; says Tatsumi . &quot; We all said , ' Pearl_Harbor ? Where ' s Pearl_Harbor ? ' &quot; For months , rumors had been circulating on the mainland that the Japanese village on Terminal Island was a spy colony . The cottages , the reports said , had tall antennas to send information to Japan . The fishermen had detailed maps of the coast . Their muscular physiques showed they were being trained by the Japanese military . The boats had torpedoes . They were planning to sabotage the naval_shipyard . In reality , the antennas were poles for drying fish . The maps were navigational_charts they had bought_in marine supply stores . There were , it turned_out , no torpedoes . After the war , the U.S._government said no cases of sabotage or spying by the fishermen had ever been discovered . But by then the village was gone . From the afternoon of Dec . 7 to the early hours of Feb . 8 , the community ' s leaders were spirited from their homes by FBI_agents . On Feb . 9 , they took_away every Japanese native with a fishing_license . The village became a huddle of frightened women and children surrounded by soldiers with bayonets . Many believed their men had been executed . Families burned or tried to hide everything they thought might cause suspicion or be misinterpreted . Kanshi Stanley Yamashita set a match to his precious boyhood collection of magazines on Japanese and American warships . Under the asphalt of today ' s cargo_container yards an archeologist might find pictures of Emperor Hirohito , guns , kimonos , photos , record_albums , tea_sets , dolls and the other artifacts of Japanese life that the village literally buried . On Feb . 25 , the remaining population was given 48 hours to evacuate . Profiteers descended to buy stoves and radios for next to nothing . The islanders stored or sold what goods they could , but much of the village -- boats , nets , furniture , china -- was deserted where it was , as if the people might return in time for dinner . Within months , much of the village re-established itself behind barbed_wire in its own corner of the internment_camp at Manzanar , in the windy desert of Northern California . Most families were fatherless -- the older_men were detained in separate camps . For many Terminal Islanders , it was their first chance to spend much time around more assimilated Japanese Americans from all_over California . Those others made_fun of the islanders for their rough ways and peculiar language -- a crude and colorful mix of English , backcountry Japanese and fishermen ' s slang . Older brothers told their sisters to stay_away_from those Terminal Islanders . &quot; They called us yogores , &quot; says Tatsumi -- roughnecks , dirt bags , bums . The Terminal Islanders fought_back . They formed one of the toughest baseball_teams in the camp , wearing uniforms emblazoned , YOGORES . After the war , some Terminal Islanders scattered to places like Chicago and New Jersey to find jobs . But most eventually came_back to Los Angeles . When they stepped from the ferry onto Terminal Island , they saw their cannery-owned homes had been razed . The Murakami grocery_store had been demolished . The few shops left on Tuna Street had been taken_over by outsiders . Terminal Island had been transformed into a massive military base and a much-expanded industrial zone . It had been a force in America ' s victory over Japan and was now an engine of Los Angeles ' burgeoning commercial power . The village was no more . Few of the islanders took_up fishing again . No one had the money to buy a boat . Yamashita ' s father , the once-proud captain and owner of a 125-foot tuna clipper with a crew of 14 , became the live-in houseman for a wealthy Bel-Air family . His mother worked as their cook . Yamashita had volunteered in 1944 to serve in the Philippines , once the Army began accepting Japanese Americans again . Later , he was struck by the irony of his military career when he returned in uniform to see his parents during the Korean_War -- and was forced to use the servants ' door . Finding that few landlords would rent to Japanese Americans , many Terminal Islanders gravitated to a trailer_park in Long_Beach that had been built for black defense workers . One of the few lines_of_work available to people of Japanese descent was gardening , and the seafaring men of Terminal Island became famous for their skills with pruning shears . Throughout the 1950s and ' 60s , the Terminal Islanders helped each other find jobs and looked_after one another . The Baptist_church group met in Murakami ' s living room in Long_Beach . And the islanders would return time and again to the bulldozed spot where their homes once were . They often dragged along their new spouses and children . &quot; He wanted me to see where the canneries are , &quot; recalls one woman , a non-islander whose husband took her on a pilgrimage after they were married in the 1950s . &quot; To me , it was a bunch of broken down , fishy-smelling buildings . But you ' d think he was going_home to his Georgia plantation. &quot; Over the years , the islanders began to notice that Issei -- the original immigrants -- were dying_off . The Nisei , the second generation , began worrying that the memories would disappear when they did . In 1970 , Tatsumi and others formed the Terminal Islanders Club . They were shocked at the response . When the group scheduled a picnic , more_than 1 # 000 people showed_up . So they made_it an annual event . Twenty years later , it still draws hundreds , bringing the village back to life for a day . Throngs of toddlers and great-grandmothers roll_over the island ' s bridges onto its sole patch of green , a park owned by the same Navy that once helped evict them . Koi fish banners fly over children ' s footraces . Old-fashioned Japanese ballads drift over the breakwater and taiko drumming pounds through the air . The smell of grilled mackerel competes with the truck exhaust , and leather-skinned grandfathers swap tales in the pungent argot of their childhoods . Before they go , the people form a circle , stamping_out the bon odori , the lighthearted Dance of the Dead in honor of their ancestors . The islanders know there ' s a chance the dance may die with them . So they are determined to pass_on to their descendants something more concrete . Last month , the Terminal Islanders Club put_out a call_for artifacts -- old fishing equipment , photos , a kindergarten handbell -- and began raising money for an exhibition at the Japanese American National Museum . Of course , a Downtown museum can ' t store the evocative stench of fish that the islanders drink_in deeply whenever they wander back to Fish Harbor -- and its remaining tuna cannery . Recently , Tatsumi and some friends -- all_in their 70s -- retraced their boyhood steps , tooling around the island in a minivan , popping_out to sniff the air and conjure_up their old haunts . Their reminiscences were happy ones , as if the terrible end of the village had been forgotten , leaving only the good old days . &quot; This is where we ' d dig holes in the sand_dunes , &quot; says Masaharu Tanibata at a huge pile of chrome scrap , suddenly remembering one rascally old buddy . &quot; Remember ' Soup ' used to charge us a nickel to go_in his cave ? &quot; We ' d steal bananas from open freight_cars , &quot; says Tanibata , a retired Hughes Aircraft engineer . &quot; We were bad ! &quot; The men stand at the edge of Fish Harbor , where the remnants of Los Angeles ' once-great fishing fleet now share the water with sunken , rotting boats . &quot; This is where I learned to swim , &quot; Tatsumi says , &quot; with fishing corks tied around me. &quot; Outside a warehouse , they line_up for tacos at a catering van surrounded by truck_drivers oblivious to the history of this dusty spot . The old Japanese Americans pull aside the young Latinos , eager to pass_on their tales . &quot; We were born here . This used to be our home ! &quot; they say . The young_men smile briefly at the old_men , then push_forward to grab their meals . The ghosts of Terminal Island may be forgotten under the feet of the thousands who work there today . But they are still visible to those who entered the world on its sandy shores . Yamashita , the son of the tuna clipper captain , found himself somehow drawn_back to the island . For decades , an army career took him from Europe to Asia . But when it came time to retire , he got an apartment on the bluffs of San Pedro . Yamashita keeps a telescope set_up in his living room . It ' s trained on Terminal Island . After his retirement , he earned a Ph.D. with a dissertation titled : &quot; Terminal Island : Ethnography of an Ethnic Community : Its Dissolution and Reorganization to a Non-Spatial Community. &quot; In other words , Yamashita says : &quot; We all still stick together. &quot; Lost Village From 1906 to February , 1942 , a Japanese American fishing village flourished at Fish Harbor on Terminal Island . The villagers were incarcerated and their houses razed during World_War_II . But the old residents and their families gather on the island each year for a picnic .</TEXT>
