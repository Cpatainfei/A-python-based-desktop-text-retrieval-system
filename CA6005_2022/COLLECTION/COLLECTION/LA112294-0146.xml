   <HEADLINE> FASHIONING A FLEET OF FAST DREAMS ; CRAFT : ONE OF THE NATION ' S PREMIER MODEL MAKERS IS BUILDING A UNIQUE COLLECTION OF ALL THE AMERICA ' S CUP WINNERS AND CHALLENGERS SINCE THE RACE BEGAN IN 1851 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Several months ago , Ken Gardiner , a lanky craftsman with perennial sawdust in his hair , walked into a Connecticut maritime gallery in search of boat pictures . But not of just any boats . Regarded_as one of the top boat model makers in the United States , Gardiner , 46 , is in the midst of creating a collection ordered by Dennis Conner , America ' s best-known sailor , of every America ' s Cup challenger and defender since the trophy began in England in 1851 . When completed next June , the set , featuring 57 racing yachts built to a scale of 3 / 8 inch per foot , will be valued at about $ 1.2 million and placed for viewing at Conner ' s shop and gallery in San Diego . It will cap Gardiner ' s 25-year model making career . &quot; No model maker has ever done the full collection in all_the same scale , &quot; said Gardiner , who visited Connecticut ' s Mystic Maritime Gallery on a research foray for the Conner project . &quot; The New York Yacht_Club has a collection , but they were made_over the years by different model makers , &quot; he said . &quot; But that ' s a private club , and the public can ' t see it . Dennis is going_to have this on display in San Diego so the public can see it. &quot; To a sailing purist like Conner , the New York collection and another owned by Australian model maker Rollie Tasker are flawed because they lacked consistency of model makers and scale . &quot; With regard_to the scale , &quot; Conner said , &quot; you miss the relative size of the boat . So my inspiration was to use a premier model maker . My dream was to build a complete set of defender and challenger boats by the same model maker , who was the best in the market , to a standard scale and a high standard of excellence. &quot; Examples of Gardiner ' s work are usually found in abundance at Southern California marina offices , boat-building companies and restaurants . Steve Rock , 45 , the manager of Fiddler ' s Green Restaurant in San Diego , said : &quot; He ' s the only person in the whole world that boat designers trust with their designs . Ken learned how to make models from his dad , and Ken lives and breathes boats. &quot; Gardiner ' s boat models are carved from blocks of Michigan basswood , then sanded and coated with primer and paint at his Newport Beach factory , a workshop and warehouse filled with hundreds of wood and fiberglass hulls and materials wedged into a 1 # 000-square-foot area . This world of boats includes a wood-carving room , painting booth , drying room and enough cubbyholes filled with handmade model parts to supply a miniature U.S. Navy . * It is a labor-intensive job with Gardiner and four employees putting_in hundreds of painstaking hours to craft boats that are adorned with hand-laid teak decks , hand-machined screws , masts and winches . Gardiner boats can sell for as little as $ 125 for a half-model of a hull to more_than $ 17 # 000 for a full model . Half-models , preferred by most sailing traditionalists , offer a side profile of a boat ' s hull that is literally cut_in half lengthwise , and mounted flush to a fine wood base . Full models are complete replicas . For Gardiner , the trip to Connecticut yielded a treasure_trove of information . He had searched in sailing books , but none revealed enough details about the famous yachts he needed to build , including two , the Columbia and the Shamrock . At Mystic Seaport , he found rare photographs taken about 1899 , the year the race was held , showing the Columbia at sail and the Shamrock during deck construction . The photos gave him what he needed for an accurate model . &quot; Those two boats are over there , &quot; Gardiner said as he pointed during an interview inside his factory . On the deck of the Columbia , which was no wider than 10 inches , Gardiner had meticulously hand-laid 1 / 8-inch teak strips , and he readied the Shamrock for an authentic canvas-covered deck . It is that attention to detail that has model makers like Gardiner in high demand . When customers arrive , they bring photographs , original boat drawings and their wallets . He then lists every part , detailing , for example , whether a window is flush or recessed , cleats , literally every nut_and_bolt , even fishing_poles -- all on a computer spreadsheet that usually goes_to 12 pages . &quot; It ' s a bidding list , &quot; he said . &quot; From there we decide on the price and it usually takes from eight to 10 months to complete a full model . But right now I ' m swamped , and we have a two-year backlog. &quot; Prominent model makers are a rare breed who tend to specialize in Eastern Seaboard customers because there are more boats there than on the West Coast , said Scott Chambers , 45 , a Seattle model maker and one of Gardiner ' s competitors . By necessity , Chambers said , model makers are part engineer , part artist and part researcher . The ability to hunt for valuable information , &quot; especially while working_on full models , is part of the game. &quot; &quot; Ken and I go at it differently . I specialize in the half model and he does both , &quot; Chambers said . Said Conner : &quot; Ken is not only a model maker , but he is also a very competent sailor . I ' ve raced with Kenny and against him for years . He really is the premier model maker. &quot; * Though they have bid against each other , the two model craftsmen have never met . Gardiner does not advertise , in contrast to Chambers , who places ads in boating magazines . &quot; I don ' t advertise , and I don ' t like galleries , &quot; Gardiner said . &quot; Galleries pay $ 10 # 000 and try to sell it for $ 20 # 000 when it ' s not a $ 20 # 000 model. &quot; His client list includes prominent sailors like Conner and yacht designers , such_as German Frers , and captains of industry . For the most part , Gardiner ' s business is individual models bought by those who can afford a 120-foot boat and also order its miniature equivalent . &quot; It ' s an ego thing , &quot; Gardiner explained . &quot; They have their boat , and they can ' t put their boats in their offices or corporate headquarters . These are men and their water toys. &quot; Gardiner has molds for more_than 3 # 000 half-models and 160 full models . He has done so many of America ' s Cup boats that skippers and designers often buy dozens of the models to give to crew_members and sponsors . &quot; Sometimes we don ' t make the boats exactly , &quot; Gardiner admitted with a smile . &quot; We use what I call the ' Kenny feel , ' to complete the boat because in the America ' s Cup they don ' t want the ( design ) secret to come_out . They do want me to make the boat , but they don ' t want anything that gives_away the true design or any innovations. &quot; One boat , a 120-foot motor sailer , had so_much detail that it included fiber optic lights to illuminate the boat ' s interior . &quot; The customer was the head of an oil_company who I can ' t name . But he was in the middle of a bad divorce , &quot; Gardiner recalled . &quot; When he got_it and unwrapped it , the owner slowly broke_into a smile . His secretary later told me , ' You know , he hasn ' t smiled in the last year and a half . And , you made him smile. ' &quot; That kind of satisfaction motivates Gardiner . &quot; that ' s the biggest thrill , the customer ' s reaction , &quot; Gardiner said . &quot; I love it . It ' s like winning a sailboat race . When you can see them smile . . . then you know you ' ve won . And , I ' ve been there when they open the shipping box and they can only say , ' Wow !
