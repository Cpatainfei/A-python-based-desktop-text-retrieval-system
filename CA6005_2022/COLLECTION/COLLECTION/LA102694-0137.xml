   <HEADLINE> RATE OF TEEN-AGE PREGNANCY FALLS AFTER LONG RISE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The rate at which American teen-agers are having babies has dropped_by 2 % , marking a sudden turnaround from a skyrocketing increase that had totaled 27 % since 1986 , the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention said Tuesday . &quot; We feel it ' s a real change , &quot; said Stephanie Ventura , a statistician who wrote the report for the CDC ' s National Center for Health Statistics. &quot; It reverses a pattern where it had been going_up 5 , 6 , 7 % a year from 1986 on. &quot; The center calculated the nation ' s birth trends by analyzing the 4.07 million birth_certificates filed_in 1992 . For every 1 # 000 women ages 15 to 19 in 1992 , the center reported 60.7 births . The good news on teen-age births was somewhat shadowed by the 1992 birth report finding that many babies -- 7.1 % -- still are born too small . Babies that are born weighing less than 5 pounds , 8 ounces are at increased risk of death during early infancy and of developmental problems .</TEXT>
