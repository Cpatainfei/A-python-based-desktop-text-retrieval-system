   <TEXT> In 1997 , the Music Center ' s Dorothy Chandler Pavilion will get a flashy new neighbor : the $ 200-million Frank O . Gehry-designed Disney Concert_Hall . Disney Hall will become the new home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic -- as well as the spectacular new showpiece of Bunker_Hill ' s Los Angeles Music Center . And suddenly , the stately Chandler , current home of the Philharmonic and the annual Academy Awards , will become the symphony_orchestra ' s old house . &quot; Disney Hall , I predict , is going_to become not just a symbol for Los Angeles , but a point_of_entry to the Pacific Rim of the United States , &quot; said Music Center President Shelton g . Stanfill during a recent conversation . According to Stanfill , the bright white limestone-and-stainless-steel structure -- which has been compared to everything from a flower to furled sheets_of_paper to the Sydney ( Australia ) Opera_House -- will energize and humanize the Music Center . He said that Disney Hall -- along with a new , improved Ahmanson Theatre , which is undergoing a massive &quot; reconfiguring &quot; and is to reopen in 1995 -- will change the elitist aura of the Music Center to something more user-friendly . But what about the Pavilion ? The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion was named after Music Center founder Dorothy Buffum Chandler , now 93 , wife of former Los Angeles Times Publisher Norman Chandler . The building -- a chandeliered structure ringed by columns -- was the first Music Center theater to open , in 1964 . In 1967 , it was joined by the Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theatre ( where &quot; Phantom of the Opera &quot; ran_for four years before closing last August ) . There are those who hail Disney Hall -- initiated by a $ 50-million gift from Walt Disney ' s widow , Lillian , in 1987 -- as the savior of the Music Center . They see a bright future with new , expanded programming moving_into the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion , including increased opportunities for dance . But there are others , including skeptical members of the Music Center board of governors , who have worried in recent years that Disney Hall will become the Music Center , draining life from the existing theaters . Not only does the L.A. Philharmonic ' s move to Disney Hall create a vacuum at the Dorothy Chandler , but the Music Center ' s operating company must be responsible_for making use of Disney Hall during the 12 to 14 weeks a year the Philharmonic will not perform there because of its touring commitments and the Hollywood Bowl season . The immediate destiny of the Ahmanson -- after its $ 17-million face_lift is complete -- has already been determined : The Broadway hit &quot; Miss Saigon &quot; will open there in January for a nine-month run . The Mark Taper Forum will maintain its theater season of four or five plays a year . But the future of the Chandler Pavilion remains a more open question . Gordon Davidson , Center Theatre Group artistic director / producer , joked that when Disney Hall was first proposed , resident company directors ' primary worry wasn ' t that Disney Hall would drain artistic resources , &quot; just all_the money -- that ' s all. &quot; Indeed , some board_members have protested that building a $ 200-million concert_hall in the midst of a recession -- for a symphony that already has a place to perform -- represents a waste of funds . Further , because the Disney gift will cover only part of the cost of building Disney Hall , board_members worried that fund-raising for Disney Hall will exacerbate the already difficult task of raising funds to support the Music Center ' s four resident performing companies : the Philharmonic , the Los Angeles Music Center Opera , Center Theatre Group / Mark Taper Forum and the Master Chorale . ( Since 1987 , accrued interest and additional gifts from the Disney family have raised the Disney contribution to $ 92 million. ) Music Center officials acknowledge that initial plans for Disney Hall raised fears as well as hopes , but they say that most concerns have been resolved . &quot; You are not going_to see dark houses here because of Disney Hall , &quot; said Sandra Kimberling , president of the Music Center Operating Co. , which is responsible_for scheduling the various resident company performances and other attractions into Music Center theaters . &quot; With the growth of Disney Hall is going_to come growth in all_the buildings . It is going_to encourage growth . We aren ' t going_to hear people saying , ' But how are you going_to fill it ? ' &quot; Kimberling cited three main proposals that could keep the lights on at the Dorothy Chandler : an expanded opera season , more dance programs and more musicals . She added that there is no danger of the Academy Awards ' moving to Disney Hall because that hall will not have a proscenium stage . During the initial stages of Disney Hall planning , Kimberling said , the Music Center ' s four resident companies each sat_down and drew_up projections for its 1997-98 season . Early projections were needed , she said , to persuade both Los Angeles County ( which is financing the $ 81.5-million Disney Hall garage ) and skeptical board_members that the center needed a new hall . For the opera_company and the symphony , perpetually in pursuit of the best guest stars and conductors , such early planning is standard : &quot; The sort of people we need to be involved -- Placido Domingo , David Hockney -- they do plan four or five years in_advance , &quot; said Peter Hemmings , executive_director of the Los Angeles Music Center Opera . Kimberling also said she does not foresee any problems booking the empty weeks at Disney Hall , pointing_out that the operating company has agreed with the Philharmonic that the orchestra will make arrangements to book other orchestras , classical_music performers or possibly jazz_musicians into the hall . And , she said , the Philharmonic will need to have more concerts in its regular series to accommodate subscription ticket-holders because Disney Hall will be smaller than the Chandler -- 2 # 380 seats versus 3 # 300 . Kimberling added that more time available at the Pavilion will allow_for more maintenance and set-up time for special events such_as the Academy Awards , as well as offer more space for other special events and short-term bookings : &quot; We can ' t really compete with the summer fare at the Greek and all that -- people want to be outside and see their pop artists -- but getting something like the Bette Midler run that went_to Universal . . . it might be an interesting thing to get some kind of a pop series on our list. &quot; One special event Kimberling mentioned is the annual television Emmy Awards , currently held_in September at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium . James L . Loper , executive_director of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences , confirmed that the organization is perpetually looking_for a site with more seats than the Pasadena Civic but not as_many as , say , the ShrineAuditorium , and that it has several times opened discussions with the Music Center about using the Chandler . So far , he said , such talks have broken_down because the Emmys need a full 10 days of set-up time and must be held_in September because that ' s when the TV season begins . The opera season , Loper said , has always gotten_in the way . Without the need to schedule around the Philharmonic , Kimberling said , the Chandler could better accommodate its many December holiday programs . Among these are the obligatory annual &quot; Nutcracker , &quot; usually performed by a visiting ballet_company such_as the Joffrey , the Kirov or American Ballet Theatre . With the new hall , there will be time available for an early &quot; Nutcracker , &quot; which has not always been the case in recent years . &quot; ' Nutcracker ' notoriously doesn ' t sell well after the first of the year , &quot; Kimberling said . The center also has its eye on a jazz series patterned after Lincoln Center ' s . &quot; They have Wynton Marsalis ; they have a program every month , or every_other month , &quot; Kimberling said . &quot; We ' d really like to do an East Coast-West Coast , ' Lincoln Center Meets the Music Center ' tie-in . We ' ve got the other Marsalis ( Branford , of &quot; The Tonight Show &quot; band ) here , and we ' re going to work_on that too . We did a jazz attempt a_few years ago , but we just couldn ' t get the dates with any consistency. &quot; Kimberling said that the Music Center Opera will not necessarily produce more operas in a given season but that it would be able to present more performances of each opera -- more cost-effective than setting_up elaborate sets for productions that may play for only a_few days . She added that the opera_company would gain the ability to present opera throughout the year rather than during one crowded September-October season , and that it would also get a chance to produce musicals . &quot; Thinking philosophically , a huge city like this must have a concert_hall , separate from the opera_house , &quot; offered the opera ' s Hemmings . &quot; I think everybody agreed that the Chandler is a much better opera_house than it is a concert_hall . A concert_hall needs to be a house without a proscenium -- a proscenium is anathema to orchestra sound . Concert_halls should be completely open . &quot; Only in relatively small cities is the one building shared on a multipurpose basis . And so , at least , the building of Disney Hall indicates a distinct maturity . All great cities have an opera_house and a concert_hall . We are one of the last ones to be sharing -- and our time has come. &quot; He added : &quot; I am very pleased to know we will be the main tenants in the future . . . and I am therefore interested and concerned to know what it is going_to be used for during the rest of the year . Because the less the theater is used , the more the onus is_on us to cover ( maintenance ) costs. &quot; Hemmings said the opera_company currently presents eight or nine operas a year and that in 1997 it may be able to offer nine or 10 . &quot; But with standard operas , we ' ll be able to do 10 performances instead of seven , &quot; he said . &quot; We also think it is essential to spread our performances throughout the year , rather than doing them all_in the same period ; we think our subscribers prefer it . We aim toward doing an opera a month during the season , September through June , so the subscribers don ' t have to go too often. &quot; Hemmings said extra performances for paying audiences could help offsets costs for more community outreach performances for students , senior_citizens and others . Like Kimberling , Hemmings expressed some enthusiasm for musicals but noted that they would most likely be co-productions or the work of touring companies that would be presented by , rather than performed by , the opera . &quot; It depends_on what you mean by a ' musical , ' &quot; Hemmings said . &quot; Pieces like ' Phantom of the Opera , ' ' Sunset Boulevard , ' ' Evita , ' ' Cats ' -- they all use microphones , which means the casting can be very different &quot; from opera . &quot; I don ' t think those pieces will ever be the meat of opera_companies . &quot; But I think pieces like ' Oklahoma ! , ' ' My Fair Lady , ' ' South Pacific , ' ' Carousel ' and of course the Gilbert_and_Sullivan pieces and pieces like ' The Merry Widow ' and ' Die Fledermaus ' . . . are done_by opera_companies . And the other way to do musicals is to buy_into a circuit , as we did with ' Porgy and Bess. ' I think an opera_company is a perfectly logical organization to put_on musicals , but we can ' t take any risks , because an opera_company ' s duty is to put_on an operatic repertoire each year . What I am hoping is that some sort of fund can be created to take the potential sting out of presenting musicals. &quot; Whereas plans for the opera are largely in place , the prognosis for dance at the Music Center is less certain . The Joffrey Ballet , the center ' s former resident company , lost its residency because of financial difficulties in 1991 and has not been replaced with another company . Dance presentations since then have been sporadic , and plans to establish an active Music Center dance planning committee have been stalled time and again because of the economy . Kimberling is enthusiastic about dance possibilities at both the Chandler Pavilion and the reconfigured Ahmanson . At the Ahmanson , she said , &quot; we are removing the left_stage wall . Right now , there are some dance companies that would showcase very nicely at the Ahmanson , but they can ' t leap offstage without smashing into a wall. &quot; Kimberling and Disney Hall officials note that Disney Hall offers some opportunities for dance too . The concert stage could be used for modern_dance companies that do not require fly space or suspended scenery , and Disney Hall will contain a small chamber concert space seating 600 that might be used for small-scale dance concerts . Other officials , Hemmings among them , are less optimistic about dance at the Music Center -- particularly at the Ahmanson , which has already booked &quot; Miss Saigon &quot; for Jan . 25-Oct . 15 , 1995 , and will likely continue to play host to long-running shows in the future , leaving virtually no time available for dance . The Dorothy Chandler presents a problem for dance because it ' s big . Its cavernous stage is suited only to big ballet_companies -- and even they could only put_on large-scale , showy story ballets such_as &quot; Swan Lake &quot; or &quot; Romeo and Juliet , &quot; not repertory programs . And &quot; where are they going_to come from ? &quot; Hemmings asked . &quot; The problem is that all_the American national dance companies are in great financial trouble and touring has become so expensive . The only thing on which they can make ends meet appears to be ' Nutcracker. ' &quot; Kimberling said most of the responsibility for selecting and scheduling performers for Disney Hall will fall to the Philharmonic . Disney Hall &quot; is not the kind of place where you are going_to book trade shows ; it ' s designed for a real specialized audience , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s a concert_hall . . . . They ( the Philharmonic ) have more expertise in that -- it ' s something they know more about , the classical artists and everything . we ' ll pick_up the slack time , but the majority of ( engagements ) will come_through the Philharmonic. &quot; The Philharmonic ' s executive_vice_president and managing director , Ernest Fleischmann , declines to speculate on what those offerings might be . &quot; We are obviously concerned with what goes_on in Disney Hall , but I am not in any position to tell anyone what it is going_to be , &quot; he said . &quot; Mr. Salonen ( Music_Director Esa-Pekka Salonen ) and ( artistic consultant ) Peter Sellars and I are working_on it . It is a . . . profound matter which I would say will have impact on the cultural life of this city ; we take it extremely seriously . Fleischmann stressed that each of the Music Center ' s resident companies has its own board of directors separate from the Music Center and that the Music Center , which is the center ' s fund-raising arm , provides less than 7 % of the Philharmonic ' s operating_costs . Therefore , he said , he is not concerned about any fears Music Center board_members may have had about Disney Hall . &quot; I ' m glad they are worrying on our behalf , but we are the ones carrying the ball , &quot; he said . &quot; I wasn ' t afraid , nor was anyone connected with the Philharmonic . If they did not have confidence in us , it ( Disney Hall ) should never have been offered to us in the first place. &quot; Fleischmann called Disney Hall &quot; complementary to , not competitive with , the Music Center. &quot; And he sees the separate facility as a way to cut , not increase , costs for the Philharmonic and the opera . &quot; There is a tremendous reduction in stage costs &quot; to be realized , he said . &quot; At the moment . . . an opera set has to be taken_down , and the orchestra has to be put_up , all_in a_few hours , requiring legions of stage hands. &quot; Center President Stanfill -- who took_over in January after six years as president and chief_executive_officer of Virginia ' s Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts -- also sees more Chandler Pavilion open time as a boon . &quot; So many major things that have ended_up at the Orange County Performing Arts Center would have been naturals here had there been time available , &quot; he said . &quot; It is quite possible for something like the Bolshoi Ballet , or the Kirov , to be in both places , without feeding off each other ' s audience . Those things didn ' t come here before , because there was no space , no time . It will be complex in terms of time and schedule , but at least it will be possible . &quot; When I was at Wolf Trap , we were dealing with people like the Metropolitan Opera and the Spoleto Festival , and we were able to do_it because they had the available talent and we had the right kind of space . The Music Center did not. &quot;</TEXT>
