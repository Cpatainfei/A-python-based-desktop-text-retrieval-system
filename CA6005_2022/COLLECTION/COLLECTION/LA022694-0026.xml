   <HEADLINE> IMPACT OF MASSACRE FELT IN L.A. ; MIDEAST : JEWISH AND MUSLIM LEADERS CONDEMN KILLINGS IN HEBRON . THEY CALL FOR AN END TO EXTREMISM AND EXPRESS WORRY THAT THE PEACE PROCESS WILL BE THREATENED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Los Angeles awoke Friday , the awful news of the massacre came drifting over the airwaves : 48 people killed in a Hebron mosque as they prayed at dawn . Perhaps a dozen more in the riots that followed . So_much bloodshed . Yet another terrible chapter , another horror story , in the Middle_East . And in the hours that followed the news , Jewish and Muslim leaders in Los Angeles rose in unison to condemn the killings , to say that terrorism of any stripe could not be condoned . &quot; It is time to play the game fair and talk_about Jewish terrorists and Jewish fundamentalists as well , &quot; said Maher Hathout , spokesman for the Islamic Center of Southern California . &quot; We want to fight extremism , all extremism. &quot; The dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center , Rabbi Marvin Hier , joined in condemning the massacre and terrorism from any quarter : &quot; Those of us who have been in the forefront of condemning terrorism cannot condemn it only when it comes from the other side . We have to condemn it in unequivocal terms when it comes from our side as well . This was senseless , wanton murder that dishonors the principles of Judaism and there is no cause that is worthy of such action. &quot; It was close to noon Friday when Muslim worshipers began filing through the doors of the Islamic Center mosque on Vermont Avenue , answering the call to prayers just as the Palestinians of Hebron had only hours earlier . They came from a variety of Islamic sects and soon filled the mosque to overflowing . This is a special time in the Muslim world , the holy month of Ramadan , devoted to fasting and prayer and introspection . Devout Muslims neither eat nor drink from sunup to sundown . After the recitation of Koranic verses , Hathout stood before the worshipers . He said he had planned to talk_about generosity , about having unconditional love for everyone . But that theme no longer fit the occasion . &quot; Now I find myself forced to talk_about a certain kind of love , a love of the victim , &quot; he said . &quot; Now I find myself forced to talk_about a special kind of compassion for the murdered and aggrieved . We were awakened by the ugly , brutal , criminal act of terrorists when bullets were showered in the mosque in Hebron . The floor of the mosque that is always to be kept clean has been smothered with the blood of innocent people. &quot; As Hathout talked , his voice became even more emotional as he spoke about how the gunman and his compatriots had been allowed to build their settlements in the occupied territories , as well as live_in Hebron . He wondered aloud how so many people could have been killed without the Israeli army stopping the killer . And he bitterly denounced the Israeli government over the number of Palestinians killed in the riots after the massacre . At events throughout Los Angeles , other religious_leaders joined in adding their condemnation of the massacre , carried_out by an American-born doctor who lived_in a nearby Jewish settlement . Rabbi Joel Rembaum , president of the Southern California Board of Rabbis , took pains to note that Palestinians have been guilty of_their_own atrocities in the past . &quot; One ought not forget there have been more acts of this kind . . . from the other side over the years and as we condemned those , we have to condemn this , &quot; he said . &quot; Violence begets violence . The only way this can stop is if violence can cease and that ' s why there has to be peace. &quot; Robert Bleiweiss , editor and publisher of the Jewish Spectator , said the fundamentalist group the gunman belonged_to is a serious threat to the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians . &quot; I haven ' t a clue as_to how to solve it , &quot; he said . &quot; ( The problem ) is not a divided middle but the religious extremists on both sides . In a free country , you cannot stop a terrorist if he wants to kill somebody , even with strong security . &quot; The peace process represents the best chance in 100 years . Jews and Arabs have been killing each other since 1891 when the first waves of Zionists came_back to Palestine . If ( negotiators ) don ' t do_it this time , it could well mean another 100 years of war. &quot; The local chapter of the American Jewish Congress also condemned the radical Jewish organization and said it was a mistake on the part of the Israelis to allow &quot; fevered right-wing Jewish radicals to settle in the midst of &quot; a place like Hebron . &quot; One must expect that people who regularly and publicly preach hateful , racist doctrines , when allowed to run_around freely heavily armed with Uzis , will finally act_on their ugly convictions , &quot; said Rabbi Laura Geller , executive_director of the American Jewish Congress Pacific Southwest Region . Ahmed El-Gabalawy , spokesman for the Islamic Center of Northridge , the largest Muslim congregation in the San Fernando Valley , said the reaction there had been -- like everywhere else -- one of shock and outrage . &quot; Ironically , in evening_prayers at the mosque last night we recited the part of the Koran that talks_about how Jerusalem is sacred to both Muslims and Jews -- and last night this happened. &quot; Times staff writer John Dart contributed to this story .</TEXT>
