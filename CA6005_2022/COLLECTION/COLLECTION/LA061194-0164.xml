   <TEXT> As workers in Dresden , Germany , lay the first stones to rebuild a Baroque church destroyed in World_War_II , computer_scientists here are creating a 3-D version of what the finished project will look_like . Using a virtual_reality headset , viewers can see the blue doors of the church open_to a view of the ornate ivory and gold altar and the organ that Johann Sebastian Bach played in 1736 . Light coming_through the Protestant_church ' s clear windows illuminates paintings of the Apostles in the inner dome , which virtual tourists can observe more closely by pushing a button to &quot; fly &quot; up there . IBM Germany hired the scientists at Research Triangle Institute to help create the virtual_reality model in_order to generate money to rebuild the actual Frauenkirche , or Church of Our Lady , said Robert Haak , special projects manager for IBM Germany . The reconstruction is expected to cost about $ 150 million . Some critics have questioned the wisdom of spending such a large amount_of_money on the ruined church , which lies_in the economically strapped former East_Germany . But Haak says most Dresden residents support the project . All but 10 % of the money comes from private donations . &quot; One could think it ' s more important to build apartments , &quot; Haak said in a telephone_interview from his office in Stuttgart . &quot; But the people of Dresden want this. &quot; The Foundation to Rebuild the Frauenkirche , a private group made_up mainly of Dresden residents , has been working since the late 1980s to generate support for the reconstruction . IBM Germany offered its help in 1989 , providing money , equipment and consultants , and workers last year began clearing rubble from the site . They expect to complete the project by 2006 , the 800th anniversary of the city of Dresden , Haak said . The original church , on the Elbe_River , took about 16 years to build and was completed in 1742 . The church survived the Allied bombing that destroyed much of Dresden in February , 1945 , but toppled in the firestorm that immediately followed . &quot; It was a very elegant city , &quot; said Gerhard Weinberg , a professor specializing in World_War_II history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . Weinberg said rebuilding the Dresden church has political and social significance for eastern Germany . &quot; It ' s the general sense of rebuilding religious life in a society in which religious life was tolerated but discouraged by the Communist regime for decades , &quot; he said . * The virtual_reality model of the church received rave reviews in March , when it was unveiled at a computer trade show in Hanover . One person donned a special helmet and maneuvered a hand-held control to navigate the tour . For the demonstrations , the images were projected onto a small theater screen to be viewed by people wearing 3-D glasses . The scientists plan to set_up a similar demonstration pavilion in Dresden in September , Haak said . The church ' s interior is one of the most complex virtual worlds ever constructed , said Dale Rowe , director of RTI ' s Center for Digital Systems . Three RTI computer_scientists -- Jorge Montoya , Steve Duncan and Jim Chung -- developed the virtual_reality model of the church ' s interior from an animated model , similar to a computer-generated film , supplied by IBM . A French computer_graphics artist , Luc Genevriez , directed a team of artists who drew the church ' s interior , working from architectural_plans , historical descriptions and prewar black_and_white photographs . Haak said only one color photograph existed . In 1943 , Adolf Hitler ordered that color photographs be taken , and one was recently found in Munich . The photo shows the church ' s inner dome , and Genevriez used it when depicting the painted Apostles . IBM scientists in New York and the United Kingdom did the calculations for the animated computer model . * The RTI scientists ' task was to convert the animated model to a version that an individual could &quot; walk through &quot; in real time , Rowe said . The animated model took 2 1 / 2 hours to generate a single scene . To walk through the models in virtual_reality , the researchers needed to generate 30 frames per second . The complexity of the animated drawings complicated the project , Rowe said . The scientists developed a way to simplify the images by mimicking the focus of the human eye and narrowing the field_of_view . RTI also enlisted the help of a powerful graphics computer owned by Silicon Graphics of Mountain View , Calif. , which helped generate the dinosaurs in the film &quot; Jurassic Park. &quot; Haak said the RTI scientists are still working to increase the speed of the virtual_reality church before the September demonstration in Dresden .</TEXT>
