   <HEADLINE> THE LAW THAT BROUGHT THE CRIMINAL-JUSTICE SYSTEM TO ITS KNEES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito sits in Department 100 on the 13th floor of the Criminal_Courts Building . One suspects Ito knows full well that he doesn ' t have enough judges to call tomorrow ' s balls and strikes , much less the anticipated wave of &quot; three-strikers. &quot; As the Criminal Division ' s assistant supervising judge , Ito must find courtrooms for criminal jury trials . There are 33 in the Criminal_Courts Building downtown . If he comes_up empty there , he has to &quot; go shopping. &quot; First , he ' ll look_for any available criminal courtroom in Los Angeles County ; next , for any available civil trial_court , and , finally , for any courtroom that has a jury_box , regardless of the judge ' s assignment . Ito knows that any prosecution attempt to broadly impose &quot; three strikes you ' re out &quot; will bring an already infirm criminal-justice system to its knees . Even before &quot; three strikes &quot; became law , the Superior_Court was in the habit of desperately searching for courtrooms to move 40 # 000 felonies annually from one end of the criminal-justice system to the other , with just over 100 assigned judges . What makes this latest solution to the crime problem so irritating is that the politicians who passed &quot; three strikes &quot; knew it could never be meaningfully enforced . But , alas , we ' ve traveled this road before in California . * In 1975 , the presumed anti-crime panacea was a &quot; use a gun , go_to prison &quot; bill , authored by then-Sen . George Deukmejian . It required judges to impose prison_terms if a firearm was used in the commission of a felony . Now , nobody uses a gun to commit a crime , right ? * In 1978 , the &quot; Briggs Initiative &quot; restored the death_penalty . Since then , at a cost of a_billion dollars , two people have been executed , one voluntarily . * In 1982 , the Mothers Against Drunk Driving -- MADD -- gave California the harshest driving-under-the-influence laws in the country . After a one-year dip , in 1983 , drunk-driving arrests have continued to rise despite mandatory jail time for repeat offenders and draconian penalties for first-timers . * Also in 1982 , voters passed Proposition 8 , the &quot; Victim ' s Bill of Rights. &quot; It forbade plea_bargaining on serious felonies , added five years of jail time for each previous felony conviction and boosted prison sentences for repeat offenders . Result : California ' s prison population grew from 18 # 000 , in 1982 , to 126 # 000 today , with little or no decrease in the crime_rate . * 1990 brought us the &quot; Speedy Trial Initiative &quot; which , in its execution , has provided neither speedy trials nor initiative . In fact , the number of felony criminal-jury trials has dropped . Now comes &quot; three strikes. &quot; Think_of the criminal-justice system as plumbing . The court system is a series of small pipes under enormous and constant pressure as a result of the large volume of defendants shoved into it by police and prosecution . One court pipe , called &quot; plea_bargaining , &quot; shunts the accused through the system with just a cursory look and sends them off to prison , jail or probation . The other pipe has a series of extremely expensive filters called &quot; jury trials , &quot; and defendants moving through this pipe travel slowly , so that their guilt or innocence can be finely analyzed . The defendants , and only the defendants , control the flow by saying not_guilty at their arraignments . Under our current plumbing , 97 % of them must pass_through the plea-bargaining pipe . Only 3 % elect the fine analysis of a jury trial . The capacity of the jury-trial pipe is already full ; any added pressure will cause the system to rupture . Few defendants facing a 25-year-to-life &quot; top &quot; are going_to plead guilty . They will choose the already backed-up jury-trial pipe , and the criminal-justice plumbing will break_down . But not only criminal justice is affected . Last week , District_Attorney Gilbert L . Garcetti announced he is jettisoning long-established sections of his office -- environment , consumer affairs and major frauds , among others -- to &quot; free up &quot; enough experienced deputies to try &quot; three-strikes &quot; cases , for which there are no courtrooms . Each of these sections was paid_for by state or federal funding , so each deputy D.A. transferred back actually costs the D.A. money and reduces his operating budget . Garcetti is essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul . Even if Garcetti moves a_couple_of dozen more prosecutors into &quot; three strikes &quot; prosecutions , they will become little more_than legal Dutch boys with thumbs in the criminal dike , trying to hold_back a tidal_wave of new cases . Already , optional felony-misdemeanors , known as &quot; wobblers , &quot; are being sent wholesale to the City Attorney ' s offices for misdemeanor prosecution . Assault with a deadly weapon and commercial burglary , for example , are wobblers . A clue to just how rigorously &quot; three strikes &quot; will be enforced may be found in the experiences connected to Proposition 8 . After several months of trying to live with the proposition ' s &quot; no-plea-bargaining &quot; provision , the system ' s players decided that ignoring it was better than watching the system collapse . The clause is now enforced , if at all , in the months -- say , four -- leading_up to a contested district_attorney ' s election . Of course , everything negotiable is continued until the week after the election . As for the pyramiding of five-year enhancements for prior convictions , when Judge Ito and his colleagues have no trial_courts available on the statutory &quot; last_day &quot; for trial , the D.A. can either negotiate or watch his case be dismissed for lack of a courtroom . The &quot; priors &quot; have a way of becoming negotiable . All that has been accomplished by &quot; three strikes &quot; is to allow a frustrated citizenry vent its rage at government-directed targets , in this case , habitual_criminals . But as George Orwell made clear , under Big Brother things always got_worse , but the public felt better for having someone to blame. *</TEXT>
