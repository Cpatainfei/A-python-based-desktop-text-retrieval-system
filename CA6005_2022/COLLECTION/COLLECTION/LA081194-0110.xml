   <HEADLINE> TABLE_TALK ; POLICY_MAKER ; ELLEN HAAS : A BELTWAY OUTSIDER MOVES INSIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Summer is the most peaceful season here in the midst of Mendocino County ' s vineyards and orchards , as fruit matures to the verge of ripeness and little work needs to be done until harvest . The July heat slows life down as well , adding_to the stillness . Ellen Haas , however , doesn ' t have time for reveries or solitude . At the moment she is involved in debating the weighty issues of the food world : nutrition , affordability , sustainable agriculture . The occasion : a gathering of top chefs , environmentalists and consumer activists . The place : Fetzer Vineyards ' state-of-the-art organic garden and culinary center known as Valley_Oaks . But midway through a session on improving children ' s diets , Haas reluctantly bolts_out of the meeting room . An assistant has just reminded her that it is time for yet another appointment on this one-week visit to California . Ranking U.S. Department_of_Agriculture officials do not normally mix with chefs , organic farmers and winemakers on the latter ' s home_territory . Traditionally , these interests are in conflict as the USDA routinely promotes -- and favors -- conventional farming represented by the nation ' s massive grain interests and meat industries . But Haas , the USDA ' s Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services , is the kind of government official who has been willing to defy bureaucratic convention . ( Americans may remember the USDA ' s Food and Consumer Services as the agency that attempted to classify ketchup as a vegetable during the Reagan Administration. ) &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; She answers her own question . &quot; Well , we have a magnificent opportunity to dramatically change the health of children through our school lunch initiative . And central to the proposal is to improve the taste of food served to kids . Chefs can be partners with USDA in helping us make the change . . . because if cafeteria food doesn ' t look good , children won ' t eat it. &quot; Haas takes_exception to any suggestion that attending an organic farming conference complete with gourmet meals and vintage wines is elitist or inappropriate . &quot; These people are far from being fancy . They roll_up their sleeves . They get their hands dirty . And vineyards are a part of American agriculture , &quot; she says . &quot; We can ' t make the changes we have proposed with just the traditional interests who have dominated the policy arena in the past . We will meet with all interests . . . . And being here also helps to get_out of the bureaucratic vacuum ( in Washington ) . &quot; * Haas is one of the most powerful women executives in the Clinton_Administration , overseeing programs with an annual budget of $ 39 billion covering food_stamps , the National School Lunch Program and the Women , Infants and Children nutrition program ( WIC ) . Haas , in fact , is fond of saying that one in six Americans is touched by the USDA feeding programs under her control : 27 million Americans receive food_stamps , another 25 million children receive federally subsidized school lunches or breakfasts , and seven million women are enrolled in WIC . Only Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala ' s $ 286 billion budget eclipses Haas ' total among major federal agencies or departments currently run_by women . In the early stages of the Clinton_Administration , Shalala , Attorney_General Janet Reno , Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner were among the women who became recognizable Washington personalities . Not Haas -- agriculture and food issues normally take a back seat in the national news cycle . But she is raising her profile dramatically by changing the philosophy behind the cornerstones of America ' s anti-hunger programs with an emphasis on healthy eating rather than just feeding . And Haas ' path to the USDA is different from that traveled_by virtually all her colleagues in the executive_branch -- women or men . Sixteen months ago , Haas made the unlikely jump from shoestring consumer gadfly to top federal_official . At the time , she traded_in her dingy office at Public Voice for Food &amp; Health Policy , a Washington-based advocacy group , for a palatial corner suite at the USDA headquarters . The move from firebrand to administrator overseeing a multibillion-dollar budget is unusual even for the federal_government ' s revolving doors . Consumer groups are rarely , if ever , the proving ground for big-time Republican -- or Democratic -- appointees . More likely , the pinnacle for consumer advocates is a_few minutes on network television attacking the vested_interests . Even so , Haas seems perfectly suited to her post . She has worked in and around Washington her entire career . In a sense , she is a Beltway insider who has made a living as an outsider , a self-appointed advocate for a long list of consumer issues . And she has a ready explanation for those who say she was not qualified to jump from a $ 1-million-a-year consumer-advocacy operation to her current responsibilities and huge budget . &quot; The measure of a person who does public policy is getting results and making a difference for people , &quot; Haas says . &quot; At Public Voice I was able to expend small financial resources to help consumers on major issues such_as beef grading , seafood inspection , nutrition labeling . We did that by identifying the issues , documenting , researching , and then communicating about them . To have had to manage on small resources is beneficial ; there is an appreciation of frugality in a time of deficit reduction . And I am able to make_do with less. &quot; Haas has impeccable credentials as a consumer advocate . She was elected to five terms as president of the Consumer Federation of America and 10 terms as vice_president . At Public Voice , she was instrumental in changing the government ' s beef grading program so that lean meats received a more palatable classification . Changing the name to USDA Select Grade resulted in a 400 % increase in sales . Prior to founding Public Voice , she was consumer director for the Community Nutrition Institute in Washington . To suit her government tenure , Haas has modified the tactics she successfully employed as a consumerist . She is now more consensual than confrontational , a bridge builder instead of a barn burner -- cautious instead of a risk_taker . When necessary , however , she remains especially skilled at using the media to facilitate her agenda -- now the Clinton agenda . Slim , fit and the same weight as at Forest Hills High_School in New York City , Haas , 54 , is immaculately tailored , often in vividly colored business_suits . She wears her jet-black hair straight and down to the shoulders . She laughs when retelling how often people are surprised at her trim appearance , expecting , instead , that the person in_charge of the nation ' s school lunch program should be &quot; some 250-pound bureaucrat with a hair net. &quot; From 1982 to 1993 , Haas was founder and executive_director of Public Voice . The group ' s priorities included food safety -- such_as the need for a mandatory , comprehensive seafood inspection program -- and nutrition . Interestingly , Haas was a frequent critic of the food_stamp , school lunch and WIC programs that she now administers . School lunches , she said , were too high in fat and sodium , food_stamps were inaccessible to the rural poor , and not enough low-income women were enrolled in WIC to improve pre- and post-natal care . Upon her USDA appointment , food industry representatives openly feared she would immediately turn long-standing government nutrition policy upside-down . They were wrong . She still needs more time . On June 8 , Haas and USDA Secretary Mike Espy announced that the Clinton_Administration plans to reduce fat content in federally subsidized school lunches to 30 % of total calories . Saturated fat will be reduced to only 10 % of total calories . Sodium counts must also be modified . The changes may mean a dramatic reformulation of school cafeteria food . Fried chicken , hamburgers and pizza are likely to be supplanted in lunch rooms by more fresh produce , pasta , bread and seafood . The emphasis on reduced-fat diets for school children earned Haas the derisive name of &quot; National Nanny &quot; by one meat industry trade group . Even so , the proposal is the first significant revision of school lunch nutrition requirements in half a century . Haas , a one-time history teacher , researched the National School Lunch Program , which dates to the 1940s , before the proposal was issued . The idea for federally subsidized meals arose during the Truman Administration after an alarming number of young_men were rejected for World_War_II military_service because of nutritional deficiencies . In the decades since , undernutrition has lessened while overconsumption has become the major health_problem , she says . &quot; Diet is related to at least half of all_the major chronic diseases , and adults acquire their eating habits by age 12 , &quot; Haas said as a way of emphasizing the importance of school lunches . Yet , even in its current form , the proposed USDA changes did not satisfy some of Haas ' biggest supporters , including those at her former consumer group , Public Voice . Chief among the complaints are that the proposal , as announced , does not go_into effect until July , 1998 . Haas responds by saying there is still time to make changes -- including the starting date -- before a final regulation is issued and that the public-comment period on the Clinton school lunch plan does not close until September 8 . Despite an initially chilly reception from food industry groups , Haas has thrived at the USDA and may soon get a promotion and new title . Legislation is pending in Congress that , in addition to a major reorganization of the USDA , would elevate Haas ' current position to undersecretary . The change is not mere window_dressing but more accurately reflects the fact that Haas ' Food and Consumer Services represents about 60 % of the USDA ' s total annual budget . Furthermore , the programs she administers have either retained their present funding or were actually increased in the 1995 federal budget -- a significant accomplishment for any agency , but particularly so at athe USDA where major budget and staff reductions are expected in other areas . While 16 months as assistant secretary has not dampened Haas ' energy , it has softened her rhetoric . Sniping doesn ' t work when major speeches need to be cleared through Agriculture_Secretary Espy ' s office and , on some occasions , by the policy staff at the Clinton White_House . &quot; I ' m comfortable in my role , &quot; she says back in her Washington office during a recent interview . &quot; Everyone ( at this level ) has their speeches approved and I have been very comfortable with that from Day 1 and I am comfortable being part of the team . . . . I need to keep focused_on the purpose of this job , and that is to improve the health of children , not to criticize. &quot; Her scripted remarks parallel the Clinton_Administration ' s philosophy of reinventing government and reforming health_care . But when speaking extemporaneously , as she did at a press_conference earlier this year in San Diego , Haas may resort_to the language of consumer champion on food safety issues , her prime focus at Public Voice . &quot; We have an inadequate system of consumer protection for seafood . The bottom_line is that we ( the federal_government ) are not doing enough to protect consumers , &quot; Haas says . &quot; Whether we are serving fish , meat or diary foods to kids in school lunch , we must ensure that they are healthy foods . ( The USDA ) is a stake holder in ( food safety ) problems . . . . The USDA spends $ 700 million a year in food purchases ( that are then distributed ) for school lunch and that makes us a big and important consumer . Our views need to be heard. &quot; Yet , on other food safety controversies she equivocates . Although her view was different as a consumer advocate , Haas says that serving school children milk from cows treated with the recombinant Bovine Growth_Hormone drug , or BGH , is not an issue . &quot; BGH was approved by FDA and there is nothing indicating that it is unsafe , &quot; she now says . &quot; Milk is a major component of school lunch but it is not vital . There is no reason for us to get involved with the ( science ) in any additional way. &quot; The same goes_for irradiated foods . * She says that government_departments such_as hers must rely_on companion regulatory_agencies to investigate and approve new technologies . &quot; These are Food and Drug Administration issues and we have to assume that the FDA does an objective review. &quot; After 20 years as a consumer advocate , Haas has gained a feel_for politics and compromise . &quot; The first issue I was ever involved with as a grass-roots volunteer with the Maryland Citizens Council didn ' t get_to first_base , &quot; she says . &quot; But persistence paid_off . You need to put_in time in_order to achieve your goals . . . . After all this time , I have an understanding of history and politics and making government work for consumers. &quot; Ironically , the first issue of her activist career was campaigning for improvements in the nutritional content of school lunch after she saw what her two children were eating_in their elementary_school cafeteria . A former colleague , Rod Leonard of the Community Nutrition Institute , calls Haas an efficient administrator , both in and out of government . &quot; She has done a great job building her organization , &quot; he says . &quot; And she has demonstrated her true great qualities : She is a tremendous organizer and has an ego as wide as the Mississippi River. &quot; In response , Haas would only say : &quot; Rod ( Leonard ) is a fine person . . . . We have a cordial relationship. &quot; Haas was among the first consumer advocates to enlist many of the nation ' s top chefs in support of programs to promote food safety and children ' s nutrition . She also carefully courted the national media and the important players on Capitol_Hill . As a result , she moves freely within the circles of celebrity chefs , journalists and politicians , whether in Los Angeles , New York or Washington . By contrast , previous inhabitants of her office were more likely to be former presidential campaign workers or others heavily influenced by the Washington school of partisan politics . Though responsible_for the nation ' s largest feeding programs , prior assistant secretaries were more concerned with pleasing food industry constituents than discussing , say , the need to reduce pesticide residues in school lunches . &quot; In previous administrations , food and nutrition issues were made in a vacuum as if they had no relation at all to public health . . . . I am trying to build bridges from the farms to the schools and chefs , &quot; Haas says . &quot; Consumers did have a stake in agriculture policy ( in previous administrations ) but they were looked_at as intruders . Now , we make_sure that consumers participate in all policy matters. &quot; Haas says her work with chefs , which continues in the aggressive campaign to improve the nutritional content of school lunches , is not a gimmick . &quot; Using chefs was a very smart move , &quot; says Will Greenwood , executive chef at the Jefferson Hotel in Washington and one of three finalists for the Clinton White_House chef . &quot; Chefs are a viable and overlooked source of knowledge about foodstuffs and are always out trying to find the best quality. &quot; Greenwood , who enlisted in Haas ' Public Voice campaigns to improve seafood safety , adds : &quot; She is very forceful in all her issues and she strikes where it hurts . . . . I knew I was being used ( for publicity purposes ) but that was fine with me. &quot; Consumer advocates need to rely_on the media to present their cases , and Haas was a master of accumulating coverage without resorting_to the sensationalism of some of her consumerist colleagues . Her recognition of the media ' s growing interest in food is also reflected in ongoing negotiations with the Walt Disney Co . to produce television programming designed to improve children ' s eating habits and food choices . &quot; A lot of people are intimidated and afraid of the media but I ' ve always been comfortable with it , &quot; she says . &quot; The only way to reach the general public is through the media . And I have valued that ever since realizing that the media allows you to reach consumers in their homes without external distractions. &quot; * For example , in a series of four hearings across the country last year held to get public input on ways of improving school lunch , Haas was able to call_on her chef contacts , such_as California ' s Alice Waters , to testify . Indeed , Waters can speak eloquently to the importance of child nutrition but she is also guaranteed to generate media interest in an otherwise dreadfully dull session . &quot; The skills I learned in working with Congress and the media are invaluable in this job , &quot; Haas says . &quot; You need to communicate with , and respect , the media and Congress . There are major organizations ( in Washington ) that don ' t do either well. &quot; No group suffered the consequences of Haas ' media savvy more_than the National Fisheries Institute Inc. , a seafood industry trade association in Arlington , Va . For years , Clare Vanderbeek , an institute vice_president , was assigned to follow Haas around the country to act_as a one-person spin squad whenever Haas was to speak on seafood issues . The confrontations were often mismatches . In a terse comment , Vanderbeek recently stated : &quot; Ellen Haas is extremely skillful when it comes_to bringing media attention to nutrition and food safety issues . Her leadership at Public Voice was instrumental in getting a better seafood inspection program. &quot; On a personal level , Haas is knowledgeable_about fine food and California_wine . Family dinners , she says , were important when she was a child . &quot; I can remember when I was 8 years old and my mom always made_it a habit to have stalks of carrots and celery in a glass of cold water at the dinner_table . And we always started dinner with half a grapefruit in the winter and some melon in the summer . . . . Today , I don ' t cook that much but I try to make wonderful things when I do . Food is something to enjoy , something to share . It reflects family . And when you eat_in a way to promote health , then you are enhancing the personal health of the family. &quot; * Twice married , Haas is now divorced , with two grown children who will both be entering graduate_school this fall . Daughter Lisa will attend USC ' s masters ' degree_program in Physical_Therapy and son Jason will begin the University of Michigan ' s MBA program . And she has strong opinions on single motherhood . &quot; The view that society couldn ' t succeed unless there is a nuclear_family irritates me . It ' s chauvinistic . . . . The family is very important , obviously . Yet , the value of family and the value of nurturing doesn ' t mean that people without kids , or unmarried people , are not good . . . but I ' m not a militant about it , &quot; she says . &quot; I don ' t like to put anyone in boxes. &quot; As for life beyond the USDA , she says : &quot; I don ' t think_about my future ; I ' m not doing this job to build a career . Right now , I couldn ' t be more challenged , and I believe we have an opportunity to accomplish a great deal. &quot;</TEXT>
