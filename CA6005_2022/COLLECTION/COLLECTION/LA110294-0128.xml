   <HEADLINE> THE NBA : 1994-95 PREVIEW ; A REVIVAL WOULD BE HEALING , TIMELY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Another opening , another show , thankfully . Beset by problems as it left the stage last June to the yawns of a bored nation , so scorned that a preseason yearbook ran a cover asking &quot; Is the NBA Dead ? &quot; it returns on Friday to the gratitude of sports-starved Americans . Who would have thought all it had to do to reclaim its cachet as &quot; the league that works &quot; was play a game ? But with work_stoppages in baseball and hockey , fans have learned to appreciate a game whose players and administrators can work_out their problems on_their_own time . The NBA and its players are working without a contract but with a no-strike , no-lockout pledge that makes_it impossible for either side to pull the plug without making itself look_like &quot; The Grinch That Stole Christmas &quot; and a liar , to boot . Despite everything that went_wrong last season -- no Michael Jordan , bratty stars , a game that looked more like mud wrestling than ballet -- the NBA had solid fundamentals that allowed it to avoid the pitfalls that felled baseball and hockey . The NBA had undisputed and widespread prosperity , unlike baseball and hockey . NBA owners long ago accepted the legitimacy of the union , unlike baseball , whose owners took strike after strike , trying to break the players ' association . The NBA did not have a commissioner who got the job by promising the owners a salary cap , unlike the NHL . Instead , NBA Commissioner David Stern was bent_on avoiding the league ' s first work_stoppage . The NBA opened its books to the union , unlike the NHL , which offered to furnish only selected data . The NBA had players who had grown rich under a salary cap and weren ' t the least bit interested in a work_stoppage , unlike baseball and hockey . A hard negotiation lies ahead , however . Stern and the former union head , Larry Fleisher , would engage in marathon screaming matches but they were a_couple_of New York guys who understood each other , so for them , bellowing was an expression of endearment . The new union head , Wharton-trained Charles Grantham , is less trusting , more of the opinion that the league was playing him for a punk . Soon after he took_over , a court fight produced records showing the NBA had been hiding luxury-box revenue from the players . The league was obliged to make a huge cash settlement . Further , Grantham notes that players ' gains , although significant , are nothing compared to those of the owners . The Lakers ' Jerry Buss , for example , bought his team , the Kings and the Forum for $ 67.5 million in 1980 . When Magic Johnson bought_in last summer , he assumed a franchise value for the Lakers of more_than $ 200 million , an annual rate of appreciation of more_than 25 % . But NBA owners still have their system , the games will go_on , there are new rule changes designed to open play and everyone is happy , for the moment . * A comer on the American scene since it began its rise from YMCA dance-floor status , the NBA has taken its share of falls . Billed as &quot; the game of the ' 70s &quot; after Madison Avenue ' s beloved Knicks had won their first title , the NBA was instead beset by all manner of problems -- a rival league , drug rumors -- and limped into the ' 80s . The Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry turned the ' 80s into a golden_age with engaging superstars who had the pretensions of a ballboy , preparing the stage for the greatest star the game had ever known , Jordan . In the shrinking TV market of the late ' 80s and ' 90s , the NBA posted impressive gains . The Dream Team took_over the 1992 Olympics . The 1993 NBA finals , with Jordan ' s Chicago Bulls and Charles Barkley ' s Phoenix Suns , drew higher ratings than the World_Series for the first time . The idea arose that the NBA was &quot; bulletproof &quot; but the 1993-94 season put a hole the size of a . 357 magnum slug in that theory . Jordan retired . Two unspectacular defensive clubs , the Knicks and Houston Rockets , turned the finals into an entertainment debacle that had even basketball fans reeling from their TV_sets . Golden State Coach Don Nelson said he turned it off and went_to play golf . Ratings plummeted from the previous spring ' s record 17.9 to 12.3 , the league ' s worst since 1981 . Worse , NBA stars turned a new , immature face to the public . The league ' s accession had been personality-driven , Julius Erving &amp; Co . passing the torch to Johnson and Bird . By the ' 90s , no one wanted to keep a flame that suggested obligation more_than reward . Johnson said he ' d pass it to Jordan , who said he didn ' t want it . No one has seen it lately . Maybe it ' s in Jordan ' s baseball locker in the Arizona Instructional League . &quot; The flame , &quot; says Johnson , laughing , &quot; is out. &quot; Players now arrive in the NBA rich , famous and jaded , having become celebrities in the NCAA tournament , still basketball ' s highest-rated event . They sign million-dollar deals with sneaker companies eager for new spokesmen to replace Jordan , Johnson and Bird . They are given ridiculous salary deals , like Larry Johnson ' s $ 84-million extension , which prompted Derrick Coleman to sneer publicly at the Nets ' $ 69-million offer -- he handed_out T-shirts mocking the proposal -- and persuaded Glenn Robinson ' s agent , Charles Tucker , to seek $ 100 million before his client had scored his first professional basket . Young stars once had a_few years to grow_up before becoming spokesmen but a new generation has been thrust upon us , barely out of its teens . Last summer ' s World Championships was supposed to be a coming-out party for the NBA ' s young stars but they behaved more like Hell ' s Angels at an embassy tea . The so-called &quot; Dream Team II &quot; repeatedly tried to humiliate overmatched opponents , demonstrating only how much things had changed and offending everyone . &quot; You already know you ' re better and you ' re going to prove that playing but that ' s the new thing so we all have to get used to it , &quot; says Magic Johnson . &quot; This is the thing of , ' I want to dunk and I want to let you know I dunked in your face so I ' m going_to sit here and growl and throw my hands up and look_at you for 20 seconds. ' &quot; In our day , when a guy did something like that , they would let him drive to the hole the next time and put him on his butt . No question about it . It was the unwritten rule . You just didn ' t show anybody up . Now you could say ' I got you ! ' or something -- and keep going . Like Larry and Coop ( Michael Cooper ) had a little thing but they kept playing . You never saw Larry Bird make a jumper and point at Coop ' s face . Coop would have ate his finger off . . . . &quot; Larry backed_up his talk . They got guys now -- I ' m watching some playoff_game , some dude who doesn ' t even play that much , he ' s talking ! See , when I played , great ballplayers talked ' cause they could back it up . &quot; But it ' s changed and I don ' t like it . Now people around the world don ' t like it . I traveled around the world after this happened , on my tour , and everybody was saying the same thing . They say ( Dream Team II players ) didn ' t have the class we had . We were in Spain and the Spanish writers were all talking_about it . One of them said , ' We as writers , as fans , we cheered for you guys even when you played our team . But not this team. ' &quot; He said the players hated them , the fans hated them . It ' s too_bad . They ( U.S. players ) don ' t understand . It ' s this cool thing . It ' s just crazy now. &quot; Perhaps the NBA only needed time to make the transition . Shaquille O ' Neal , the young star of stars , seems to be settling into his role . He actually talked before an exhibition_game here , something he had avoided for his first two seasons . Chris Webber is a handsome , engaging young_man who can play . In his first exhibition_season , Grant Hill looked so talented and gracious , a Detroit writer wrote , &quot; Grant Hill is a god. &quot; A new day beckons , hopefully . * WESTERN CONFERENCE : Preview .
