   <HEADLINE> ASIA-PACIFIC PACT EXPECTED TO GIVE STATE ' S EXPORTERS A WELCOME BOOST ; TRADE : CALIFORNIA EXECUTIVES AND ECONOMISTS ALSO VIEW THE 18-NATION APEC ACCORD AS A BOON FOR CONSUMERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The beneficiaries range from Stac Electronics , a San Diego maker of data-compression software , to Harris Ranch Beef Co . in Selma . In fact , just about every California company that exports goods and services to the Pacific Rim stands to benefit from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade agreement signed Tuesday in Indonesia by the United States and 17 other Pacific Rim nations . Most of the signatory countries to APEC , as the agreement is called , have more restrictive trade_policies than the United States . Thus lower tariffs will help U.S. exports the most . Even more important , California executives and economists expect that by stimulating trade , the pact will ultimately raise Pacific Rim nations ' income levels and spending power , which in turn will create more demand for California exports . &quot; For Stac , it means computer infrastructure will grow in developing countries , and that will result in more investment and growth in software in_general , &quot; said John Witzel , vice_president of finance at Stac Electronics , a maker of software that enables personal_computer users to cram more data onto hard_disks . California consumers should also benefit . Asian-made textiles , apparel , sporting goods and machine_tools will be cheaper as the United States eases tariffs on those items to hold_up its end of the bargain . The APEC accord could set_up the world ' s single-largest trade zone . The agreement will also help open_up China ' s market , the world ' s largest in terms of sheer population and one that California producers , compared to those in other states , would have a leg up_on by virtue of geographic proximity . Until now , the Chinese have been much more receptive to foreign plants and capital than they have been to imported consumer goods . &quot; We have no presence in China right now . that ' s a huge market , &quot; Witzel said . But observers cautioned that it may take years for California companies and consumers to feel the positive effects : Tariffs are to be eliminated over 25 years . The major signatories include the United States , Japan , Australia , South_Korea , New Zealand , China and Canada . Harris Ranch Vice_President John Isadore said some Pacific Rim economies , even potential powerhouse China , still have some growing_up to do before markets will develop for some U.S. commodities . &quot; Mainland China ' s economy can ' t afford our ( beef ) products , &quot; he said . &quot; As of now , the only business we ' re doing there is to hotels and restaurants that cater to foreigners. &quot; Skeptics such_as UC San Diego economics professor Stephan Haggard also wondered whether the final agreement would effectively deal with non-tariff barriers and powerful political interests in countries such_as Japan . Despite the reservations , most economists and industry officials hailed the agreement as a positive step toward global free_trade and one sure to benefit California over the long_haul . The state already enjoys massive trade throughout the Pacific Rim , exporting about $ 56 billion in goods and services a year to the trade zone , including Canada and Mexico . That amounts to 80 % of the state ' s $ 69 billion in total exports . Even without the agreement , California companies have a disproportionate 25 % share of total U.S. exports to Pacific Rim countries , compared to 15 % of the nation ' s overall exports , according to the California Trade and Commerce Agency . California ' s largest exports are machinery and computers , electronic components , transportation products ( including aircraft ) , scientific_instruments and agriculture products . California ' s exports would rise even higher once all Pacific Rim countries even their playing_fields , said Haggard , an economist specializing in trade issues . &quot; Basically , every company that exports to the region is likely to gain from this , &quot; Haggard said . The elimination of tariffs will especially help California manufacturers and service providers involved in high_technology , software , medical equipment , telecommunications and auto parts , said Michael Liikala , regional director for international trade at the Commerce_Department ' s San Francisco office . &quot; The Pacific Rim is the fastest-growing market and population base in the world , &quot; said Bill Krist , a spokesman for the American Electronics Assn. , a high-technology trade group . &quot; The doing_away_with tariff barriers is going_to help our companies compete better. &quot; But the most significant trade opportunities may be for California agriculture interests . China , for example , in_effect bans imports of citrus , table grapes and cherries , all big California crops . And Taiwan now imposes very high tariffs , often 40 % or more , on fruits , vegetables and beef , according to Anne Chadwick , trade_policy adviser to the California Department of Food and Agriculture . &quot; My impression is that anything that will liberalize our access to Asian markets , particularly to Southeast_Asia and China , will help California growers , &quot; Chadwick said . Jay Goold , executive_vice_president of the Western United Dairymen , a Modesto-based trade organization of 1 # 400 California dairy producers , said his members currently export only about 2 % of their annual production totaling $ 2.5 billion , a percentage that is sure to grow if APEC is effective . The Pacific Rim &quot; market is not very good right now , but it ' s a potential sleeping giant for us , &quot; Goold said .</TEXT>
