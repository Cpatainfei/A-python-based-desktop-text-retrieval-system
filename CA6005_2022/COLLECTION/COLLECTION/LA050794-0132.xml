   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA PLANS ALTERNATIVE TO WEST ' S PEACE PARTNERSHIP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia will develop an alternative to the Partnership for Peace program and offer its proposal at a meeting of NATO and other European defense ministers in Brussels on May 24 , Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev said Friday . Grachev suggested a new Asian-Pacific collective_security agreement , with Russia acting_as a bridge between Europe and Asia , but he offered no details . The latest Russian initiative could create a diplomatic headache for the United States , which has sought to soothe wounded nationalist Russian pride , while discouraging Russia from free-lance diplomacy in the Middle_East , Bosnia-Herzegovina and other strategic hot spots . Despite these efforts , anti-Western and especially anti-American sentiment here is rising , fueled by indignation over the NATO bombing of Bosnian Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina and charges , repeated Friday by Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin , that the West is closed to Russian products . &quot; They smile at us broadly and nicely , but when it comes_to actions , thousands of reasons are found to bar us from Western markets , &quot; Chernomyrdin said in an interview with Rossiiskaya Gazeta , a government newspaper . Grachev ' s comments , which went beyond previous Russian official statements rejecting the Partnership for Peace plan , were equally acid . He said the &quot; infamous &quot; NATO-sponsored military-cooperation program -- which Russia promised to join , then rejected last month -- is unacceptable . NATO should not be permitted to throw its military weight around or usurp the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( CSCE ) in peacekeeping operations , he added . Grachev said he objects even to the name &quot; Partnership for Peace. &quot; &quot; We cannot possibly create a Partnership for War , can we ? &quot; he asked . Later , apparently referring to North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization actions in Bosnia , Grachev added : &quot; When they say one thing and do another , is it a real partnership ? &quot; NATO officials saw Grachev ' s statements as more Russian posturing intended to secure a status-enhancing &quot; special role &quot; for Russia in a program that 15 non-NATO countries -- including almost all_of the former Soviet satellites -- have already joined . One official who declined to be named said NATO had received assurances last week that Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev would sign the Partnership for Peace agreement &quot; in the near future. &quot; Kozyrev said publicly last month that Russia would not sign . But a key Russian lawmaker called that view &quot; wishful thinking. &quot; Most of the Russian public -- and the Parliament -- continues to hold a demonized view of NATO , a holdover from decades of Soviet slogans that depicted the alliance as the military arm of the Imperialist West , lawmaker Vyacheslav Nikonov said . &quot; I think it ' s a mistake not to sign , &quot; Nikonov said . The Partnership for Peace program is so cosmetic that Russia loses little by signing -- but would risk isolation if it refuses , he said . The Partnership for Peace consists_of two parts : a general_agreement to cooperate with NATO in principle , which NATO officials say cannot be altered for Russia , and a specific agreement that lays_out the ways in which each nation wants to cooperate . The latter could be broadly worded to give Russia a role commensurate with its status as the biggest military power in the region and include issues -- such_as curbing terrorism and nuclear proliferation -- on which Russia and the West are already cooperating , U.S. and NATO officials have said . But NATO will continue to spurn Russian hints about wanting to be present when NATO debates and votes on important issues . Efron reported from Moscow and Marshall from Brussels .</TEXT>
