   <HEADLINE> THE MICROSOFT AGREEMENT ; HARNESSING THE SOFTWARE GENIE ; REGULATION : MORE BATTLES ARE IN STORE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND SOFTWARE MAKERS AS THE INFORMATION REVOLUTION EVOLVES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Justice_Department may have trimmed Microsoft Corp. ' s sails in the personal_computer business , but as the information superhighway takes_shape , the software battle is already shifting to new fronts -- presenting the Clinton_Administration with tough new challenges . Microsoft , IBM , Novell , Oracle Systems and other rivals are pushing to supply and control the software that will set industry standards for networks of computers , the delivery of movies and interactive cable programming , wireless personal communicators and other futuristic electronic_communications devices . The battle to establish standards for these systems will test federal antitrust and communications law , as well as the Clinton_Administration ' s commitment to modernizing the information superhighway . that ' s because these emerging technologies will touch nearly every American -- not just home computer users -- and therefore prove to be more central to the nation ' s economic , social and political life than virtually any product that has been examined by federal regulators thus far . &quot; What Microsoft and other computer companies have_in_mind -- as well as cable companies and the regional Bell operating companies -- is a product for the mass market , &quot; said Michael Wirth , a communications professor at the University of Denver who has written widely about mass media and public policy . &quot; If in fact they achieve that market penetration then we are obviously talking_about a much more impactful system than the personal computer. &quot; Officials from U.S. Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown and Vice_President Al Gore to President Clinton himself have made development of the information superhighway a major priority . And they have said that the computer_industry is a critical part of the effort to modernize the nation ' s data networks so that U.S. industry can produce more jobs and remain globally competitive . But industry executives have countered that they must be allowed to make alliances and joint_ventures in_order to raise the huge amount of capital needed to create new computer software , lay higher capacity fiber-optic cable and make other upgrades . The quandary had placed some companies , such_as Microsoft , at loggerheads with federal regulators attempting to gauge the antitrust threat posed by rapidly developing technologies seeking to win markets that , in some cases , do not even exist . Microsoft dispatched numerous lawyers to Washington over the past two years to argue that its market dominance was no threat to others and that it was_due to technological prowess , marketing superiority , hard work and luck -- not anti-competitive behavior . Besides former Federal Trade Commissioner Patricia Baily , Microsoft has utilized attorneys from New York ' s Sullivan &amp; Cromwell as well as from Preston Thorgrimson Shidler Gates &amp; Ellis , the Seattle-based law_firm where Gate ' s father is a partner , in its battle against the government . But for all_the legal maneuvering between high-powered Wall_Street and government lawyers , the future of the information superhighway could hinge_on the test of wills between Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates , the nation ' s second-richest man , and the federal_government ' s chief antitrust cop -- Anne K . Bingaman . Before Clinton appointed her as assistant attorney_general in_charge of the antitrust division , Bingaman , 50 , brought several high-profile consumer class-action lawsuits against big companies , leading some to fear she might be tough on big business . As an antitrust regulator , Bingaman has withdrawn permissive guidelines on relations between manufacturers , wholesalers and retailers and has taken_aim at foreign consortiums with business interests in the United States . In recent months , however , a flurry of Justice_Department settlements with MCI Communications Corp. , AT &amp; T and other telecommunications giants suggested that Bingaman might not be as tough on the high-tech industry as with those other fields . Indeed , the Justice_Department settlement keeps Microsoft intact as a company and only alters software licensing arrangements in_order to promote competition . Still , Microsoft received more of a rebuke than many businesses did during 12 years of Republican administration antitrust enforcement that ended in 1992 . During the period , a wave of merger activity and industry consolidation erupted . The era was marked by a more_than 60 % decline in so-called private antitrust action as the Justice_Department and the courts embraced a laissez-faire approach to antitrust regulation . But although computer_hardware makers such_as Apple Computer Co . and IBM Corp . did not gain dominant shares of the field during the period , the computer operating software produced by Microsoft -- Windows and MS-DOS -- grew by leaps and bounds . In 1992 alone , Microsoft sold more_than 20 million copies of its MS-DOS software program for more_than $ 750 million , according to Dataquest Inc. of San Jose . The software has now been installed in more_than 75 % of the world ' s 150 million personal_computers . Despite the agreement , some experts believe Microsoft will continue to dominate the computer software field . &quot; Microsoft will use its clout to remain king of the_hill for some time , &quot; predicted Jim Warren , a Bay area computer writer for Microtimes and several other publications . &quot; The Department_of_Justice is going_to apparently permit them to continue to announce ( new software ) years in_advance of actually delivering anything . These . . . fantasies freeze everybody else out of the market as people sit there and wait for Bill to deliver. &quot;</TEXT>
