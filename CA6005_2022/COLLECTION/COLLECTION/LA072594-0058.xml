   <HEADLINE> ROLE OF TV NEWS IN SHAPING FOREIGN_POLICY UNDER INCREASING SCRUTINY ; MEDIA : INFLUENCE MAY BE OVERSTATED , BUT TECHNOLOGY IS REQUIRING NATION ' S LEADERS TO HAVE NEW KINDS OF COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND A CLEARER FOCUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the United States ponders invading the island nation of Haiti to oust its military junta , a troubling question arises : In the age of instant 24-hour news , is U.S. foreign_policy being whipsawed by the quick emotionalism of TV ? In Somalia , the George_Bush Administration sent_in troops after the public was barraged by wrenching TV images of starvation . Then the Clinton_Administration a year later began to pull those troops out -- the mission not accomplished -- after the public was barraged with wrenching images of a dead U.S. soldier being dragged through the streets . Some of the most thoughtful voices in the country on foreign_policy , such_as author George S . Kennan and Sen . Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) , have suggested that U.S. foreign_policy is too often based on the capricious and emotional pull of television images , which in Haiti have included desperate refugees being fished from the sea and scenes of unconscionable poverty ashore . A closer look reveals that television_news has not played as decisive a role in policy-making as the critics imagine , even in Somalia . But technology is requiring leaders to have new kinds of communication skills and a clearer focus to resist the hyper-velocity of round-the-clock media . And here the Clinton_Administration , even its own officials concede , is suffering . One reason observers of foreign_policy are so worried is that television coverage of foreign affairs in recent years has become less coherent and more oriented to stoking crises . Ten and 20 years ago , the networks had webs of overseas bureaus and covered trends and events abroad on a regular basis . Today , due_to network cutbacks in foreign bureaus and fears of audience boredom , television_news has become a kind of information mercenary . It tends to cover only wars and disasters -- usually with reporters who parachute in from elsewhere and may know little about the country . In particular , a detailed study of the records from the Vanderbilt University television archives reveals : * The three broadcast network news divisions today average only two foreign stories a night , averaging six minutes per show -- and these stories almost always involve violence . Regular coverage of foreign politics and trends has all but vanished . * Ten years ago , the three networks averaged more_than double that many stories , and nearly 50 % more time , and covered politics , foreign_policy and social trends regularly . * Twenty years ago , the networks did even more foreign stories each night , an average of close to six stories a night , though they were usually shorter than today . The cumulative message on TV today is that the rest of the world is a confusing and dangerous place filled with civil_war and ethnic and nationalist hatreds . Driving the change is a drastic cutback in the number of network overseas bureaus . CBS today has only four foreign bureaus , down from close to 20 in its heyday . NBC now has nine , and ABC 13 . In 1993 , CBS even stopped having a full-time State_Department correspondent . Network executives acknowledge that they no longer attempt to systematically cover trends , events and politics of the major capitals of the world . But they say they have no choice , given the realities of economics . Yes , perhaps CBS &quot; did better work &quot; overseas in many places of the world 20 years ago , said Lane Venardos , vice_president of hard news and special events for CBS News . &quot; But the issue is nobody can afford to do that in this day and age . So it doesn ' t do any good to talk_about what might have been . It is a new age. &quot; What ' s more , surveys consistently reveal that the public doesn ' t care as much about foreign news . So while the networks have good people abroad , executives limit foreign news on their broadcasts . &quot; There is a feeling that certainly exists at CBS that the State_Department and the process of diplomacy is not a good TV story , &quot; said CBS correspondent David Martin . This crisis mentality on television , said David Gergen , the Clinton_Administration adviser to the State_Department , &quot; makes_it harder to sustain a foreign_policy and explain why you are doing it. &quot; But there is little evidence that crisis pictures on television routinely pressure policy-makers into action . In 1993 , for instance , the Bosnian civil_war was the most reported story on network television , accounting_for 1 # 071 minutes of the three major network ' s evening newscasts , nearly twice as much as the second-most covered story , health_care , according to the Tyndall Report , a weekly monitor of the networks . Yet the Clinton_Administration , like George_Bush ' s before it , resisted the pressure , often amid torrid criticism from the press . During the final months of Bush ' s presidency , reporters say , his assistant secretary_of_state for public affairs , Margaret Tutwiler , even called news organizations to urge them to cover Bosnia , hoping that the pictures would pressure her Administration to intervene . But the policy didn ' t change . Consider China : Bush resisted the pressure of pictures from China ' s Tian An Men Square massacre in 1989 , said his press secretary , Marlin Fitzwater , because &quot; Bush knew China and knew there was nothing we could do that would be effective. &quot; Even consider Somalia : Yes , Bush acted in Somalia after seeing the TV pictures . But the pictures , officials explain now , were not the reason . &quot; It came at a time when he was trying to leave_office and didn ' t want to face the charges of being a lame_duck and dropping the ball for an incoming President , &quot; said one high-ranking Bush official involved in the discussions . Perhaps more important , the Bush_Administration thought it saw a way , however mistakenly , for the U.S. military to act without risk -- by providing humanitarian aid . The consideration of whether a particular action might work is more likely to drive policy than television , policy-makers say . Nevertheless , communications technology has compressed time throughout the process of diplomacy , formally one of the world ' s most deliberative environments , thereby putting a premium on decisiveness . In the Gulf War , the Bush_Administration faced a special pressure when the Iraqis released pictures of a bunker where 400 women and children were killed . &quot; The visual was horrendous , &quot; recalled Tutwiler . &quot; A response couldn ' t wait three days . How much stuff do we declassify instantly &quot; in_order to justify the bombing to the public , she asked rhetorically . Then there was the morning Saddam Hussein suddenly sent a communique saying he was willing to withdraw from Kuwait and the Bush_Administration felt it had to respond quickly . After a quick translation of the message , Secretary_of_State James A . Baker III and Bush decided the overture was laden with conditions and insincere . &quot; Only 30 minutes had elapsed when President Bush told me to go_on TV , to use CNN , essentially , to deliver a message to 26 governments simultaneously that we were rejecting the message , &quot; Fitzwater said . All this may make the chances of mistakes greater , said Fitzwater . But most who have been involved in these crises believe that even these moments need not dictate the decision-making . Hodding Carter III , assistant secretary_of_state during Jimmy_Carter ' s Administration , goes even further . &quot; I think it requires an official absence of policy and a loss of nerve for the pictures to drive policy. &quot; Rather than driving Administrations to act quickly , most research shows that the overwhelming pull on public_opinion is to keep the country out of foreign adventures . &quot; People are looking_for an exit , &quot; said Clinton pollster Stanley B . Greenberg . &quot; They turned the channel when the Berlin Wall came_down , and after all_the years of sacrifice from the Cold_War , they are largely turning the channel on Bosnia. &quot; Indeed , Greenberg says a close look_at the numbers suggests the public does not even care much if a politician hesitates all that much over foreign_policy . &quot; What is interesting is how little foreign_policy events seem to be linked to Clinton ' s overall job performance approval rating . After Somalia , Clinton ' s foreign_policy rating dropped 20 points , but his job performance rating only budged a couple points. &quot; In Haiti , as in Bosnia , public sentiment generally has been against intervention . A moment in Haiti that hurt the Clinton_Administration came last year when about 100 supporters of the military junta showed_up at the Port-au-Prince docks carrying sticks , prompting a U.S. Navy ship to abort a landing of U.S. and Canadian military trainers paving the way for a return to democracy there . But what hurt more , State_Department officials concede now , was the impression of American weakness , which could have been avoided if the ship had waited a day or two rather than seeming to be scared_away by the sight of men with sticks . The problem in the Clinton_Administration , even some of its own officials concede privately , is that many of its top people lack some of the more modern skills that television demands . Vice_President Al Gore ' s debate with businessman Ross Perot over the North_American Free_Trade Agreement vote &quot; was very creative , probably the single most creative use of television to advance foreign_policy , &quot; said State_Department spokesman Michael D . McCurry . But other_than that , &quot; we haven ' t had much. &quot; Others are even more blunt . On television , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher &quot; looks_like he just walked_out_of a bad opera , &quot; said one former high-ranking State_Department official . National Security Adviser Anthony Lake also suffers on the airwaves . Deputy Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott is reluctant to become too visible and trump his boss . That leaves only Clinton and Gore , who want to emphasize domestic policy . Inside the Bush State_Department , Baker and his aides planned three months ahead what they wanted to accomplish and what news coverage they hoped to initiate . &quot; Sometimes we were successful and could do the whole list , but rarely , &quot; said one Bush official . The Clinton team has had trouble doing that , officials acknowledge privately . A more difficult question may come if the U.S. decides to invade Haiti : How do officials handle live coverage from the battlefront ? For Haiti , journalists have agreed to be in a Defense_Department press pool , which travels with an early wave of troops . This group would submit to escorts and censorship . But the pool is supposed to dissolve after a day or two . Beyond that neither the military nor the press has done much planning . &quot; When things hit , &quot; said Barry Dunsmore , a 30-year veteran of ABC News , &quot; we send_out the ground station and think_about who is the prettiest person to send with it. &quot;</TEXT>
