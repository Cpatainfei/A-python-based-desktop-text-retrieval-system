   <TEXT> Back in 17th-Century Europe , collecting curiosities was fashionable . In 20th-Century San Fernando Valley , the collecting continues , but now the oddities can be found at fairs -- specifically , the 48th annual San Fernando Valley Fair , to be held Thursday through July 24 at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank . This year ' s crop of &quot; marvels and wonders &quot; as they were termed three centuries ago , includes exhibits that feature a giant Monopoly board , hand-carved carousel horses , a space craft , horses that appear to glide rather than trot , and a man who performs a daring routine perched on a 100-foot pole . There ' s even an earthquake exhibit , although most in the region would say such an event was neither marvelous or wondrous . More_than 700 exhibitors will show their wares at this year ' s fair , whose theme is &quot; We ' ve got your fun covered. &quot; &quot; All entry fees have been dropped for those who wanted to participate , &quot; said Georgia Cluver , spokeswoman for the event . &quot; We wanted to open it up_to more people in the Valley. &quot; Although the fair has held horse shows in the past , it hired a professional last year to expand the event . Bob Drennan annually presents about 20 horse shows . In 1992 , he presented the elite Volvo World Cup Jumping Finals in Del Mar . &quot; This year we ' re showcasing the spectacular , &quot; said Drennan , whose free show is from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sunday . &quot; Our biggest draw will be the Tennessee Plantation Walking horse , the smoothest-gaited horse , ever . They don ' t trot , but do a flat walk that ' s more of a glide. &quot; The horse show includes 50 other events in the air-cooled Equidome on the grounds . Members of the 4-H , Future Farmers of America and other groups will compete in the halter , English , Western and trail horse divisions . Other animal-related presentations include pig races , a junior livestock auction , at 9:30 a.m. Saturday , a petting zoo , a sheepherding show at 1 p.m. , 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. Thursday and the Bull-O-Rama bull-riding event at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday . Creations built by Valley youths also are a large part of this year ' s fair . Each year the Patrick Henry Middle_School in Granada Hills presents &quot; Math-O-Rama , &quot; an event designed to quicken children ' s interest in mathematics . The contest challenges students to build models twice to 10 times the normal size of everyday items . This year , large-scale replicas of a box of doughnuts , silverware , a calculator and a Monopoly board will be_on display . &quot; We have a Nestle ' s Crunch bar , and we did have a giant Hershey ' s bar , but it didn ' t make_it through the earthquake , &quot; said Sheila Berman , the school ' s math chair . &quot; One year we had a young_man replicate himself out of strips of sheet metal. &quot; The school ' s creations can be found in the Youth Education Pavilion , which also features a craftsman who restores and builds carousel horses . Jess Zavala , who has worked_on his craft for 10 years in Piru , will carve miniature and full-scale horses at the fair . The pavilion also contains the fair ' s earthquake exhibit , with a facade that incorporates a fault_line and an interior that harbors photos and a video of news coverage of the Jan . 17 catastrophe . Scaled-down models of Pasadena ' s Jet_Propulsion Lab projects will lend a futuristic tone to the pavilion , Cluver said . A model of the space_probe Galileo , which is in position to observe comet Shoemaker-Levy ' s crash into Jupiter soon , will be_on display . Models of imaging radar equipment used in shuttle missions and the wide-field planetary camera used to correct vision problems in the Hubble Space Telescope also can be studied . The fair ' s grandest aerial feature , however , will be Sway Pole Man , featuring aerialist Bruce Anderson , whose routine several times a day begins on a stationary trapeze welded to a 70-foot pole . Anderson then climbs to a higher pedestal , where he performs a Marine sword and drill act . For a finale , Anderson inches up_to the 100-foot mark to perform a headstand on his pole , which sways precariously . The fair ' s free entertainment kicks_off with The Tokens , who are known for their 1960s songs , &quot; The Lion Sleeps Tonight , &quot; and &quot; Tonight I Fell in Love. &quot; They ' ll perform at 8 p.m. Thursday . Other free entertainment includes the Richard Allen Swing Band and other bands , marionettes , magicians , juggling and comedy acts .
