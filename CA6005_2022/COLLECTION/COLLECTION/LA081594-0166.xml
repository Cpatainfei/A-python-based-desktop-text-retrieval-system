   <HEADLINE> ONLY MEXICAN VOTERS KNOW POLLS ' VALIDITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After six months on a high-tech roller-coaster ride unprecedented in Mexico ' s political history , the final results have poured in -- a blizzard of graphs , pie_charts and percentage_points from more_than half_a_dozen major polls , all designed to predict which of the three leading candidates will win Mexico ' s presidential election Sunday . And the winner is . . . Well , it all depends_on how you look_at it . And whether you should look_at it at all . Such , it seems , is the nature of the wild encuesta , Mexico ' s first attempt to enlist a_battery of experts to conduct independent , computerized , randomly sampled polls in_advance of what promises to be the freest and fairest election since the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) began 65 years of unbroken and sometimes authoritarian rule_in 1929 . Among the experts were some of the most prestigious pollsters in the world : Washington-based Belden &amp; Russonello , Louis Harris-Indemerc ( the Mexican affiliate of New York-based Louis Harris International ) and MORI of London . In total , they interviewed , analyzed and tried to predict the responses of thousands of Mexicans based on the techniques they have used throughout the world to produce what have long been a staple of presidential politics in the West . Perhaps not surprisingly , the results released Thursday and Friday -- the deadline for publication of opinion polls -- varied little in their findings : Ernesto Zedillo , the candidate of the ruling PRI , would win by a large margin over his two major challengers with as much as 55 % or as little as 38 % of the vote . But behind that prediction was an array of qualifications , controversies and uncertainties that say as much about the political climate in Mexico today as they do about the &quot; science &quot; of political polling in a virgin land . At the heart of what came_to be known here as &quot; the war of the polls &quot; is a basic question : Will potential voters even hint at the truth about their politics to a total stranger in a nation where a single party has had a stranglehold on power for more_than six decades ? The mere fact that there even were encuestas , or polls , appeared as a dramatic illustration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s reform policies , which permitted the importation of the high-tech hardware and software for independent experts to do their own polling for the first time . In the past , only the government was permitted to publish such polls . Salinas also has sanctioned the sweeping electoral reforms , among them credible computerized voter-registration lists and identity_cards , that have helped make this presidential race a real contest . The reforms have created one of the tightest electoral battles in Mexican history -- and a vast market for the pollsters ' predictions . As MORI President Robert Worcester put it at a news_conference here last week : &quot; What accounts_for the increased interest ( in the polls ) is that for the first time in 60 years you ' ve got a chance for an upset . . . . I think it ' s a long_shot , but you ' ve got an electorate that is ready for change. &quot; The race has been a three-way affair among Zedillo and opposition leaders Diego Fernandez de Cevallos and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas -- of the right and left , respectively -- and percentages of support have changed almost daily . Also almost daily , it seemed , there was a new poll . Their final predictions of a PRI victory notwithstanding , the pollsters were the first to congratulate the government for permitting the surveys in the first place . &quot; The contribution of polls to emerging and continuing democracies is absolutely essential , &quot; said Nancy Belden of Belden &amp; Russonello . But critics -- chiefly the opposition parties and political analysts who support them -- have asserted that the polls have been co-opted by the ruling party . Most of the institutions that contracted with the polling firms are , in fact , supporters of the ruling party . Among them are U.S. and European banks with investments in Mexico , which depend_on the stability of the status_quo . Others are newspapers and broadcast media that openly endorse the PRI . And the pollsters themselves represent companies with vested_interests in the outcome of the election ; most have had contracts with the government in the past . &quot; These are like turf battles in the Mafia , &quot; Federico Estevez , director of the social_sciences department at the Autonomous Technical Institute of Mexico , said of the competition among the pollsters . &quot; They ' re all fighting for future contracts. &quot; But Estevez , who has done his own &quot; poll of the polls &quot; since the campaign began , insisted that he finds their results credible , concluding last week that the presidential race is &quot; more over than ever. &quot; The pollsters themselves were careful to say that they aren ' t completely sure of the outcome . Most stressed that shifts still could occur before Election_Day . In releasing the poll that gave Zedillo and the PRI the largest margin of victory -- as much as 44 % , or even 55 % if the undecided vote is factored in , over Fernandez ' s 19 % -- Louis Harris President Humphrey Taylor said : &quot; Is it certain that PRI will win ? The answer , I think , is yes , unless something very dramatic happens. &quot; Belden , in releasing her poll giving Zedillo 46 % and Fernandez 19 % , noted : &quot; At times , big events in the closing days of an election have a profound impact . However , the lead at this point is commanding , and it would take a serious turn of events to catapult another candidate into the lead. &quot; And MORI ' s Worcester was even more guarded on his group ' s poll , which gave Zedillo 38 % to Fernandez ' s 22 % . He provided a list of statistical aberrations that could render his measurement -- indeed , all_the polls -- simply wrong . At the top of the list , Worcester said , is what he called &quot; the spiral of silence , &quot; a statistical &quot; skew &quot; that his Mexican partner , Miguel Basanez , says indicated that voters were more apt to tell the truth if interviewed in the anonymity of the streets than in their homes . Simply stated , Worcester said , the &quot; spiral &quot; is voter anxiety about stating any preference other_than a ruling party that has been known to intimidate voters in the past . MORI ' s predictions , he said , try to factor_in that skew through a process he called &quot; massaging. &quot; A competitor called it &quot; propaganda. &quot; &quot; It ' s not propaganda , &quot; Worcester said . &quot; It ' s psephology . . . the study of elections . And I think the failure to ( factor_in such skews ) is stupid. &quot; Worcester said the hardest element to factor_in is the large percentage of voters who either said they had not decided or refused to answer -- a group that strategists with Fernandez ' s National Action Party said almost certainly will vote for Fernandez or Cardenas and his Democratic Revolutionary Party . And polls that tried to ask &quot; attitude &quot; questions in an effort to determine whether respondents were lying out of fear did raise questions about their findings . In Belden ' s study , for example , 55 % of 1 # 526 likely voters said they believed an opposition party could win more votes than the PRI . In addition , 56 % said they believed people were afraid to speak freely about politics and government . And when asked to name the principal problem in Mexico today , the overwhelming majority listed unemployment , the economy , poverty , personal security and corruption -- traditional weaknesses for an incumbent party . In an effort to square such apparent contradictions with the overwhelming preference for the PRI recorded by pollsters , Belden said the ruling party ' s lead &quot; relies_on a lack of enthusiasm for the alternative candidates &quot; and indicates that , despite their dissatisfaction , voters &quot; are not yet willing to commit to change at the hands of another party. &quot; The Harris poll also reflected negative attitudes toward the government . In discussing that and the possibility that respondents lied to protect themselves , Taylor said : &quot; Is it possible this poll is very wrong ? Of course that is possible . There are many reasons why polls are wrong. &quot; Taylor said the poll tried to account_for lying and fear . But in addressing the question of whether opinions will change in the final week -- indeed , whether the polls will affect voter sentiment -- Taylor was not so certain . &quot; That always makes me very nervous and anxious , &quot; he said . Worcester , in particular , cited what is known as &quot; the boomerang effect &quot; in suggesting that the flood of polls giving Zedillo a huge lead could work against the ruling party by making its voters complacent and by pushing marginal opposition supporters into voting . Carlos Castillo is counting_on it . Castillo is the president of Fernandez ' s party , which he said has been conducting polls of its own but keeping the results confidential . &quot; With all_the polls saying the PRI is very strong , we think people will vote against the PRI , &quot; he said . But , Castillo added , there is another reason his party is not publishing its poll results . &quot; The polls show , for example , that there are a lot of people who know for which candidate they will vote but will not say publicly . If these people were going_to vote PRI , surely they would say PRI . &quot; But at this point , it is all just guessing . I believe the only good poll is the poll on Election Day. &quot;</TEXT>
