   <HEADLINE> BUT WILL THE FIGHTING STOP ? ; CAN CARTER ' S TAKEOVER OF LORD DAVID OWEN ' S ROLE MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Today begins a four-month Bosnian cease-fire brokered by former President Jimmy_Carter . Will the cease-fire be observed ? Perhaps : Some say the Bosnian winter imposes a natural cease-fire . But perhaps not : On Thursday Bosnian Serbs fired two shells into Sarajevo ' s Old Town , killing two and wounding seven . &quot; Large pools of blood could be seen in the fresh snow , &quot; the Associated Press reported . A cease-fire is , in any event , not a peace but at best only a prelude to peace . To what kind of peace is this prelude ? Official Bosnia , some say and many hint , must accept its defeat and move_on to formal surrender . If Carter can broker a peace without surrender , the Clinton_Administration seems to reason , good for him . If not , bad for him , perhaps , but better him than President Clinton . Concretely , surrender will occur if and when terms like those dictated Wednesday by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic replace the take-it-or-leave-it peace plan solemnly backed by the five-power &quot; Contact Group &quot; since last summer . Karadzic wants more and better territory . He also wants the right for a sovereign Bosnian Serb state to make whatever alliances it chooses : Greater Serbia , perhaps , but on its own terms . If you surrender on these terms , the fighting will stop , the Western powers tell Bosnia , with Carter now playing the role once played by Lord David Owen . But will the fighting stop ? What guarantee can Carter provide Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic that the terms of the surrender will be enforced ? Today Karadzic wants Sarajevo divided into Serb and non-Serb zones . What if , tomorrow , he decides to reunite the city ? Essentially , Carter and the Atlantic powers can offer Bosnia no guarantee but Serb good_faith . Surrender may_not even bring a lifting of the arms embargo . Post-surrender , the major_powers will not defend Bosnia , and yet they may continue to prevent Bosnia from defending itself . If they promise otherwise , who , at this point , will believe them ? Bosnia -- on the most realistic , cold-eyed of grounds , abandoning all hope of victory and seeking only a guaranteed end to the fighting -- has as much reason to reject the surrender terms as_to accept them . This is particularly the case , of course , since surrender does not mean merely submitting to Serb rule but facing death or exile by a Serb regime bent_on &quot; ethnic cleansing. &quot; Karadzic , with a veiled sneer , describes his peace plan as a way for the West to save face . It is exactly that , and for exactly that reason Izetbegovic will be under intense Western pressure to accept it . If and when he does so , however , the Serb-Croat war will quickly resume , and the Bosnian Croats may desert Bosnia for affiliation with Croatia . In short , the war will spread , for , tragically , peace in the Balkans can no longer be purchased even at the price of Bosnian surrender .</TEXT>
