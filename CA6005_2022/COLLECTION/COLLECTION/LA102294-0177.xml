   <TEXT> A foursome of senior administrators at Cal State Northridge met informally Friday and agreed to immediately begin assembling a series of athletic funding scenarios to present to President Blenda J . Wilson sometime over the next few weeks . Ron Kopita , Northridge dean of students , said athletic department officials will spend the next few days poring over possible revenue sources after a key athletics fee referendum was narrowly defeated by student vote this week . Because of projected shortfalls in the athletic budget_for next year and beyond , a handful of sports programs face possible elimination , which could jeopardize the school ' s Division I status . Kopita met Friday with Athletic Director Bob Hiegert and associate athletic directors Judy Brame and Debby DeAngelis . &quot; We need to begin coming_up with ideas about all_the ' what ifs ' involved , &quot; Kopita said . Wilson will be out of town next week , but Kopita hopes to schedule a meeting the following week . The referendum , which would have generated approximately $ 2.25 million annually for athletics , was defeated in the largest election turnout in school history . It marked the second referendum defeat for athletics in 1994 .</TEXT>
