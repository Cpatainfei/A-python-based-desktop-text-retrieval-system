   <HEADLINE> VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW : 2 LOCAL FIRMS TO INSTALL SOLAR-RUN PHONE SWITCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two Ventura County firms -- Siemens Solar Industries and GTE California -- have joined in installing North_America ' s first solar-powered telephone routing switch . The unit , called a digital loop carrier , will bring phone_service to a remote cluster of 20 homes_in San Bernardino County.The community has no commercial electrical service and no available telephone_lines . A solar , or photovoltaic , unit was chosen to power the switch because it would have been too costly to run electrical and telephone_lines to the area . Siemens Solar , based in Camarillo , provided the solar_cells used in a special switch produced by a sister company , Siemens Stromberg-Carlson . GTE California , based in Thousand Oaks , said it is considering solar-powered switches as &quot; an ideal solution &quot; for meeting rural customers ' needs .</TEXT>
