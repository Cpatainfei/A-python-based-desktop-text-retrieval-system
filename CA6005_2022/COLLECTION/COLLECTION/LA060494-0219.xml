   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 / 13 DAYS AND COUNTING ; MEXICO REJOINS THE WORLD ; AFTER BEING BANNED FROM 1990 EVENT , SOCCER-LOVING NATION IS EAGER FOR REVENGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Marcelino Garcia Paniagua shifts in his seat and squints slightly upon hearing the question , but he does not flinch . The president of the Mexican Football Federation -- although he was not in_charge at the time of the scandal -- is accustomed to answering it . The issue has been a source of shame to many Mexicans -- the soccer-loving country ' s humiliating two-year ban from international play in 1988 for falsifying documents and using four over-age players in qualifying for the world youth tournament . &quot; It was very , very embarrassing , &quot; Paniagua said . &quot; There was great suffering . The fans were sad . They wanted their team to represent them . The results were that FIFA decided to punish us . We were punished . The punishment reached our souls . Now , we are trying to do things the right way. &quot; After its brief but painful exile , Mexican soccer is back with a vengeance . With new leadership in the federation and a successful new coach , Mexico became the first_team other_than automatic qualifiers Germany and the United States to gain a place in this year ' s World Cup . Mexico plays its last tuneup game against the U.S. team today at the Rose Bowl at 4:30 p.m. In the exhilaration of Mexico ' s locker_room after that qualifier against Canada in Toronto last spring , in the midst of the champagne spray and the players ' dancing children , the afternoon ' s hero -- soft-spoken Francisco Cruz -- found the few words to express his joy . &quot; Today , Mexico is very happy , &quot; he said . &quot; Mexico has been waiting for this for so_long . It is beautiful. &quot; The way back for Mexico has been hard , and made harder by the passion the country feels_for its national team . But Mexican soccer is fueled by passion , and the team performs at its best when the odds are against it . Such was the situation in World Cup qualifying . It began with the anthem and typical soccer gamesmanship . Mexico played_at El_Salvador in a qualifying match in April 1993 , and the Salvadorans said they forgot to play the Mexican national_anthem . The Mexicans took it as a national slight . A month later in Toronto , before the decisive qualifier , the Mexican national_anthem was played , but in a condensed version . Mexican fans did not miss a beat , though . Even after the music ceased to play over the public_address_system , they continued to sing as their national team stood at attention . Only a week before , Mexico had been treated badly in Tegucigalpa , Honduras . Before that qualifying match , the Mexican team had been besieged at its hotel . Honduran fans camped outside the team hotel , honking horns , playing loud music and training high-powered lights on hotel windows . When the Honduran team fell_behind in its practice_session and Mexico had to take_the_field later than scheduled , the stadium crew told the Mexicans their allotted time was up . When the Mexican team refused to leave , the sprinkler_system was turned_on . &quot; Everything is always against Mexico , &quot; observed Hugo Sanchez , the team ' s enduring star . &quot; But we fight . We always fight. &quot; * The ties between neighbors bind , but sometimes they also chafe . The soccer fortunes of the United States and Mexico have been interestingly intertwined . Before the FIFA ban , the worst thing that had happened to Mexico in international soccer occurred during the 1987 Pan American Games at Indianapolis . During a foul-plagued game against Brazil , the Mexican team ' s masseur ran onto the field and tripped a Brazilian player who was dribbling the ball . The masseur was sent home . At the next Pan American Games in 1991 , the U.S. and Mexican teams met for the championship in Havana . The U.S. team won , 2-1 , and a melee erupted on the field afterward . The loss was shocking to Mexico , especially since it was the second at the hands of the United States in two months . The U.S. national team had earlier caused a sensation when it upset Mexico , 2-0 , and won the CONCACAF Gold Cup in Los Angeles . The Mexican coach , Manuel Lapuente , resigned in shame the next day . The incident of the Mexican masseur was of little consequence on the international scene . The same can ' t be said for the scandal in 1988 , though . That incident resulted in the resignations of both the president and vice_president of the Mexican Football Federation . The ban also kept the Mexican Olympic team out of the 1988 Games at Seoul -- the U.S. team went instead . Worse yet , a 3-0 loss to the U.S. team meant that Mexico would miss the 1992 Games at Barcelona . By far the most agonizing period for Mexican soccer was during the 1990 World Cup in Italy . The United States and Costa Rica -- the region ' s soccer gnats -- went , but Mexico , serving its FIFA penalty , was barred . It was the first time in 40 years that the U.S. team had qualified for the World Cup tournament . Mexico had been such a power in the CONCACAF region that qualifying in ' 90 probably would not have posed a challenge for a talented Mexican team . To be kept_out of the World Cup by on-field failure is acceptable to most athletes . But to be denied the opportunity to perform on sport ' s biggest stage because of the ill-advised actions of others never is . To be replaced by an unworthy stand-in was a kind of horror that has not yet faded . &quot; I was both angry and embarrassed , &quot; said Javier Aguirre , who was a national team player in 1990 and is now an assistant coach of the Mexican team . &quot; I was angry because , as players , we couldn ' t do anything about it . I wanted to go_to Italy . &quot; I was embarrassed because to many people , being a Mexican meant being a cheater . But the players were not responsible . It was very frustrating to see Costa Rica and the United States play when we could have done better. &quot; In that context , it is difficult to underestimate the satisfaction Mexico experienced when it wrested back the Gold Cup by trouncing the U.S. national team , 4-0 , here last July . There was nothing subtle about the prevailing sentiment or significance of that game . The headline in one of Mexico_City ' s daily newspapers , El Nacional , the day after the victory was , &quot; For Revenge. &quot; Mexicans need not have felt so strongly the need to win that game to re-establish their soccer superiority in the region . For all_the recent surprises , the U.S. team has won only seven times , at any level , against Mexico . Perhaps it was the timing . The game was played when Mexico was growing irritable with its pushy northern neighbor , which appeared to win everything . Not the least of what the United States has gained at the expense of Mexico is Bora Milutinovic , the coach who led Mexico to its best World Cup finish , in 1986 . * Mexico was awarded the ' 86 World Cup after the original host , Colombia , withdrew for financial reasons . FIFA entertained bids from Mexico , Canada and the United States and announced on May 20 , 1983 , that Mexico would have the tournament for the second time since 1970 . Mexicans were elated at the news , which in some quarters was celebrated as a victory over the United States . Some newspapers ran angry editorials , objecting to the 11th-hour intervention of former Secretary_of_State Henry Kissinger , who had lobbied FIFA on behalf of the American effort . Even with only three years to prepare , Mexico was in good_shape for the World Cup , the nation ' s $ 98-billion foreign debt notwithstanding . Having been host to the Olympic Games in 1968 and the World Cup in 1970 , Mexico had to build only one new stadium among the 12 to be used . The entire nation was looking_forward to the event and everyone cooperated . The academic_year was shortened and college entrance exams were moved_up to avoid conflict with the May 31 opening game . Everything appeared to be progressing on schedule until September 1985 , when twin earthquakes hit Mexico_City and , overnight , reduced parts of the city to twisted steel or rubble . More_than 40 # 000 residents were suddenly homeless . With overall inflation at 70 % , there could not have been a worse time for government World Cup expenditures . With the added cost of earthquake repairs , most Mexicans quickly grew angry . When Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid presided over the opening game of the World Cup , he was booed . But once Mexico ' s team took_the_field , the nation was enveloped by soccer fog , and de la Madrid and inflation were forgotten . As the team progressed with surprising ease through the tournament , the nation dared to hope that it would win the championship . It was a wish that went unfulfilled . Mexico lost in the quarterfinals to West Germany . Even though the team had succeeded beyond expectations , there was an audible sigh in Mexico . The fiesta was over and the joy that had filled the lives of Mexicans drained away . According to the newspaper , Uno Mas Uno : &quot; With the defeat , reality took_over . The euphoria of 23 days has ended and we will have to live with the consequences now that the football curtain has fallen. &quot; The curtain has remained_down for eight years , and Mexicans are ready for a new show . Cle Kooiman , a defender on the U.S. national team , is the captain of Cruz Azul , a first-division professional team in Mexico_City . He said the anticipation in the country is palpable . &quot; Definitely , they want to prove to the world that Mexican football is something to be reckoned with , &quot; Kooiman said . &quot; The team fully expects to make_it past the first round . I think if they don ' t , it will be tough for them to go_home and face their fans . During the World Cup , everything -- I mean the government -- will stop and all_the attention will focus_on the national team. &quot; If history is any guide , all_the country ' s woes will be forgotten as the World Cup curtain rises once again . After being denied entrance to the show the last time , Mexico will not miss a moment of this tournament . And it doesn ' t matter that , as usual , everything is against the Mexican team , which drew into the so-called &quot; group of death , &quot; with Italy , Ireland and Norway , and must play in the summer heat and humidity of Orlando , Fla. , and Washington . That helps , having something to fight against . It motivates . &quot; Revenge , &quot; assistant coach Aguirre said , not laughing . &quot; This is what we think_of when we finally return . I think , as a country , it is very good for us to be in the World Cup . It is true that Mexico is going_through a period of crisis in economic recovery . But we can help in keeping the people happy . This sounds romantic , but we can bring joy. &quot; U.S. vs . Mexico Game a Sellout Today ' s international soccer game between the United States and Mexico at the Rose Bowl is a sellout . Officials said Friday that all 80 # 000 available tickets had been sold for the 4:30 p.m. game , the last warm-up for both teams before the World Cup .</TEXT>
