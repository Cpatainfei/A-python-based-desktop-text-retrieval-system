   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON AFRICA ; A POLICY OF FINE WORDS , NO ACTION ; THE CONTINENT IS OFF OUR NATIONAL-INTERESTS MAP , BUT ISN ' T PUTTING OUR PRINCIPLES TO WORK ALSO IN OUR ' INTEREST ' ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ongoing , but not unpredictable , tragedy in Rwanda -- and America ' s hands-off policy on African conflicts generally -- points_up one of the most glaring contradictions in U.S. policy on Africa : Officially , the Clinton_Administration has pledged an &quot; activist approach to disasters in the making &quot; by supporting the democracy movement on the continent and helping Africans to deal with problems before they became crises ; unofficially , the Administration regards Africa as not important to our national interests , not even when it comes_to conflict resolution and preventing loss of life . Until a_few years ago , U.S. interest in Africa was largely confined to supporting friendly -- and frequently repressive -- regimes as bulwarks against Soviet adventurism . As the Cold_War ended , the United States took even a lesser role in African affairs . Somalia was a radical departure , and if the debacle there accomplished nothing else , it helped to crystallize the concept that U.S. policy in Africa would no longer be interventionist . In testimony before Congress in February , the assistant secretary_of_state for African affairs , George Moose , spelled_out the Administration ' s policy goals in Africa : &quot; fostering democracy and respect for human_rights ; promoting peace by preventing or resolving conflicts ; supporting economic_growth and sustainable development ; providing humanitarian assistance to alleviate suffering and hunger ; increasing American private-sector involvement in Africa , and integrating Africa into the global economy. &quot; When measured by its own yardstick , U.S. policy toward Africa has fallen abysmally short . In practice , it has been little more_than a series of adhoc equivocations , omissions and missed opportunities that accentuate America ' s global myopia and aversion to leadership , especially in the developing world . To give just one example : Last June 12 , the people of Nigeria elected their first civilian government in a decade . This achievement was promptly negated by a military takeover . Nothing about the duly elected government warrants Washington ' s rejection , yet the Administration continues its dalliance with the dictators . Nigeria ' s situation is remarkably similar to Haiti ' s , with one main difference : The United States has pursued a policy of engagement to restore democracy in Haiti , a policy of neglect in Nigeria . Inside-the-Beltway critics of Clinton ' s foreign_policy ascribe the failures to the Adminstration ' s trepidation , vacillation and inexperience on most matters foreign . Foreign-policy experts , however , cite a more callous reason : Matters pertaining to Africa are deemed of no importance to our national interests . Those who defend a posture of distance frequently cite a litany of African failures : misguided macroeconomic policies ; debilitating foreign debt and fiscal dependency ; incessant internecine strife ; corruption ; repression and human-rights abuses , and abysmal performances on developmental matters such_as population_control , literacy , health and the environment . Others would explain the lack of an engaged policy in purely pragmatic terms : Except for South_Africa , the United States has no significant economic , trade , commercial , military or strategic interests in any country in sub-Saharan Africa . Objectively , this is true -- at present . Most African states have been at the margins of world trade and commerce since achieving their independence 30 years ago . For the first 20 of those years , Africa ' s economic umbilical_cords remained connected to the former colonial powers . Since 1980 , however , Africa ' s role in the world economy has become marginalized as the economies of Western and newly industrialized countries bypass African participation . The continent ' s world market share for primary products other_than oil dropped from 7 % to 3 % between 1970 and 1990 . Given these post-Cold War economic and political realities , it is clear that traditional notions of the national interest will be insufficient to base a clarion call_for purposeful American participation in Africa ' s trouble spots . A new model must be developed , one that transcends facile contemporary analyses that , in their construction and suppositions , always lead to the conclusion that America should continue its de_facto policy of disengagement . Inherently , U.S. foreign_policy must be prospective . As it was impossible five years ago to envision the break-up of the Soviet_Union or the advent of majority_rule in South_Africa , it is not possible to predict where the next conflagration in Africa will occur . Even so , a_few projections based on fact are easy to make : Burundi is headed for the same level of ethnic turmoil as its Rwandan twin unless preventive measures are taken . Zaire ' s wily Mobutu Sese Seko will fall or be tumbled , pushing Zaire into even greater anarchy and perhaps ethnic bloodshed . Repressive regimes in Uganda , Malawi and Cameroon are destined for upheaval . The suppression of a democratically elected civilian government in Nigeria is headed for a turnabout . These and other potential trouble spots in Africa will cry_out_for enlightened American leadership , if not intervention , either bilaterally or in concert with a multilateral authority . Recognizing Frederick the Great ' s admonition , &quot; He who defends everything defends nothing , &quot; it is inane to suggest that the United States intervene in every sub-national or internecine conflict that flares_up in Africa or any place else in the world . But unstable political situations that portend dramatic loss of life -- as in Rwanda -- should vitiate any notion of American detachment or insularity , particularly when doing something would be more consistent with our principles than doing nothing .</TEXT>
