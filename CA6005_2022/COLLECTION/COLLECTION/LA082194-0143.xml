   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; HIGH_NOON IN MOSCOW : GRIDLOCK , SMOG AND A THIRST FOR QUICK RICHES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When a popular Russian singer , Alexander Vertinsky , returned from his Parisian exile in the late ' 40s , he was so taken_aback by the sight of the new Moscow that he exclaimed : &quot; Oh Russia , verily I cannot recognize thee ! &quot; Then he noticed that his suitcases were gone . &quot; Now , oh Russia , I verily recognize thee ! &quot; Even for someone who , like myself , grew_up in Moscow and has frequently returned during the last six years , the vision of the city is both deceptively familiar and unfamiliar . Since the last time I visited , a mere six months ago , Moscow has undergone a sea-change . What is this new Moscow like ? High_noon . Wall-to-wall traffic , throbbing , baking in an exhaust haze , gridlocked . Lasciate speranza -- until , all_of a sudden , a patched-up black BMW , Moscow ' s preferred muscle car , jumps halfway up the sidewalk and , like a startled black crab , scurries onto a side street . A cabby follows . After that , all is stillness , except for the deafening noise of a_hundred idling engines . With gasoline selling for approximately half of what it costs in the United States and the incomes lower by several factors , most of those caught in traffic must be_on their way to or from making a lucrative deal . The scene would otherwise make no economic sense , or even anthropological sense , since the vagaries of instability and inflation have transformed the average Russian from a hybrid of utopian and cynic into a primitive subspecies of homo economicus . It is this rough-hewn creature that wheels in his , or her , beat-up Zhiguli sedan or late-model Volvo -- and deals in anything from counterfeit caviar to shady real_estate , drugs , white slavery , children ' s encyclopedias or oil futures . But the real boom in Moscow is in the construction business . The outskirts of Moscow ' s South West has a new skyline marked by a post-modern office tower of black glass and steel , which looks_like a wedding_cake from hell . Outside Moscow proper , modern single-family homes and mansions with saunas , Jacuzzis and yes , bidets , are rising like mushrooms amid the stone-age collective-farm hovels . Standing_in food lines is as Russian as apple_pie is American . But now it takes a special effort to see the old Moscow behind all_the fruit-and-vegetable stalls surrounding every metro station and the rows of kiosks , with their liquor bottles and Mars bars . The counters of old cavernous shops , bare a year ago , groan under the weight of everything from farmer ' s cheese to imitation crab meat . Prices are high but Muscovites still spend little on rent . Food consumption has been rising steadily , and the monthly inflation is down to 4 % -5 % . If you ' re nostalgic for long lines , the best place to go is to one of Moscow ' s new financial_centers . There , customers queue_up for hours to obtain the astronomical dividends -- as much as 10 % a month in non-inflationary dollars -- that some pyramiding schemes , calling themselves banks , pay_out to their clients . The catch is that such a bank may have 15 such outlets to accept your investments , but only one to issue the &quot; dividends &quot; -- and only once a month . Chances that your principal will go_up in smoke between the payout days is great , but not as great as when inflation was 20 % to 30 % a month and before the government began a crackdown on misleading advertising . Whatever is left of the Big Politics in this world of nouveau riches and nouveau russes is now spelled with a small &quot; p. &quot; No single issue or personality defines the political scene in Russia today . What matters is &quot; the economy , stupid. &quot; Gone is the high drama of the indomitable Boris N . Yeltsin butting his head against Mikhail S . Gorbachev ' s skull , fighting communism from a tank turret or arm-wrestling with Ruslan I . Khasbulatov and Alexander V . Rutskoi . He has been upstaged by the neo-fascist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , who , in a stroke of a clown ' s genius , has been tailing Yeltsin ' s tour of the Volga region in his own steamer , setting_up his political carnival tent in the wake of the presidential train . The long-awaited founding congress of Yegor T . Gaidar ' s Russia ' s Choice party , now called the Party of Russia ' s Democratic Choice , turned_out to be summer ' s sleepiest affair . Its biggest coup was to fill two-thirds of the 1 # 000-seat convention hall with delegates and guests ; its biggest joke was Gaidar ' s ironic apology for proposing a rather cumbersome name for the party , since the preferred words liberal-democratic had already been hijacked by Zhirinovsky ' s bunch . The bankers and regional politicians , chief beneficiaries of Gaidar ' s economic reforms , who presided over the congress belong_to the generation of new Russians -- sober , calculating and deliberate . To them , politics is serious business , party-building a political franchise open_to all who are willing to hawk their socio-economic product to their local constituencies . In the presence of this political breed , the passionate speeches of the dissident old_guard were slightly embarrassing . That noble political generation has been swept aside , swallowing the indignity of the acquittal of Gen . Valentin I . Varennikov , one of the organizers of the aborted putsch . If there is one political issue that still evokes a lively response , it is crime -- whether organized or disorganized . The sound of small-arms fire in Moscow ' s residential neighborhoods has become the city ' s eine kleine Nacht Musik . Much of the violence involves gangs_fighting for their turf , but ample and graphic crime reporting , a_few assassinations of prominent bankers , a hand_grenade tossed through a window of a bank in central Moscow -- all have had a chilling effect on the city . According to government statistics , so far unchallenged , crime syndicates have penetrated 80 % of all enterprises in Russia ; half the private businesses are owned , in part or outright , by them . Yeltsin ' s June decree on fighting this scourge encountered heavy resistance from both his allies among the democrats and his foes on the right . The democrats protested that it violated habeas_corpus , guaranteed by the new constitution ; the communists and ultra-nationalists charged that it fell_short_of what was needed -- a one-stop police_state . In the end , the Duma couldn ' t trump Yeltsin . As a result , members of the Special Police_Force ( OMON ) , wearing flak jackets and armed to the teeth , stroll along the busy sidewalks and stop cars at intersections . Their increased presence alone should give Muscovites a better sense of security . And while this parade of government force goes_on , the wheeling and dealing of the new Russia will continue unabated . For the business of Russia today is -- and will continue to be -- strictly business. *</TEXT>
