   <TEXT> This is the life . Let other people go_home and sit in dark living_rooms or cramped patios , trying to escape the sounds of police sirens and the squabbling of the next-door neighbors . When Frank and Jean Bennett get home from work , they stretch_out in isolated comfort on the afterdeck of La Folie , a sleek 60-foot motor craft in one of the outer slips of Long_Beach ' s Downtown Marina , and ponder the city ' s jeweled skyline across a moonlit harbor , hearing only the haunting hourly call of the Queen Mary ' s foghorn . &quot; You leave all_the street_signs , the traffic_lights , the white_lines and the congestion behind , &quot; Frank Bennett says , settling deeper into his chair . &quot; You ' re out on the edge of society. &quot; He gestures expansively at the boat he has lived_in for the past 10 years . &quot; There is no down side , &quot; he says . The good life , eh ? Jean Bennett , who has just struggled up the gangplank with a_couple_of bags of groceries , gives her husband a flinty look . &quot; I ' ll tell you , 10 years is way too long to live here , &quot; she says , with rocklike conviction . &quot; You just get tired_of hauling things . I ' d rather do something else. &quot; Boating clearly isn ' t for everybody . It ' s cramped and inconvenient ; it ' s increasingly expensive ; and the plumbing is , in many cases , just a shade better than Tobacco Road . &quot; In the morning , you wet yourself down , turn_off the water , soap up , then turn the water on again . that ' s a shower , &quot; says Hal Lane , referring to the limited water_supplies on board . Lane , chairman of the city ' s Marine Advisory Commission , recently returned to terra_firma in search of more creature comforts after a Spartan five years on a boat . But sacrifices and all , the boating life offers a kind of freedom that landlubbers can ' t even conceive_of , boat owners often say . Loosen those moorings that tie your boat to the marina , they say , and you ' re in a vast , rolling world , out of the reach of bosses , bill collectors , traffic_cops and nagging relatives . Even if you never head for the open seas , just the gentle rocking of the boat , the calls of sea_birds and the creaking of the lines is enough to transport you magically from the workaday world . There are more_than 300 people in Long_Beach ' s two marinas , claiming an assortment of about 200 yachts , schooners , windjammers and power boats as home . Long_Beach live-aboards pay as much as $ 1 # 150 a month for the privilege of living in their tidy dockside forest of white masts and blue tarpaulins . Because of the economy , that forest is a little thinner now than it used to be . After the recent defense and aerospace layoffs , many once-flush boaters in the Long_Beach area are selling their beloved tubs . Two years ago , the city ' s two marinas , with more_than 3 # 800 slips for recreational and live-aboard boaters , were almost 100 % occupied . Now , there ' s a vacancy_rate of about 15 % for the recreational boaters . But the economy hasn ' t taken the gloss off the live-aboard life . &quot; It ' s an affordable solution for some people having economic problems , &quot; says Joni Anderson , administrative analyst with the city ' s Marine Bureau . &quot; If a couple already has a boat , sometimes it ' s less expensive to give_up the house and become a live-aboard. &quot; In fact , there is a growing waiting list of people who want to convert their boats into residences . A limit of 10 % live-aboards on most marina gangways -- imposed by the state Lands Commission to prevent floating dockside &quot; towns &quot; that lock_out casual boaters -- has meant that some applicants have been waiting a decade or more . &quot; You have to wait for somebody else to die or sell their boat or move away , &quot; says veteran live-aboard Russ Smith . Many of those who are waiting are middle-aged or elderly boat hobbyists who , with their children grown , suddenly find themselves able both to fulfill a dream and to save money . Richard and Carolyn Gardner waited 13 years to turn their 85-foot yacht Deerleap into their primary residence . &quot; Nobody wanted to die on me , &quot; says Richard , 53 , the owner of an Orange County auto parts warehouse . Finally , last October , with a live-aboard slot available , they were able to move from a four-acre ranch in Modjeska Canyon , near Lake Irvine , to their boat . The ranch , complete with pet possums , raccoons , cats and dogs , was turned_over to a daughter , and the Gardners began a leaner , more economical life without mortgage payments . &quot; Economical to a point , &quot; Gardner says . &quot; If you ' re buying a home , you ' re gaining equity with your monthly payments . You don ' t gain any equity by paying slip fees. &quot; Novices soon discover that life on a boat , with its constant round of painting , sanding , chipping and fixing , can be high on elbow_grease and low on luxury . Those tiny staterooms with little or no closet space can begin to close_in on you , Lane says . &quot; For a sit-down dinner , you seat four at the table and two others on the couch with TV tables , &quot; Lane says . &quot; It ' s not_bad , except the people on the couch are out_in left field. &quot; And the costs of maintaining a boat -- they just never seem to stop . &quot; Boats are horrible investments , &quot; says movie producer Michael Lesner , who lives_on a 92-foot yacht in the Alamitos Bay Marina . &quot; It ' s like taking a wheelbarrow full of money every month and dumping it overboard. &quot; Even the most committed boat owners respond with knowing laughs_at the famous remark of a jaundiced ex-yachtsman , who said that the day he bought his boat was the second happiest in his life . And the happiest ? &quot; The day I sold it. &quot; Aside from monthly slip rental , $ 9.63 per foot , or $ 481.50 for a 50-foot boat , and live-aboard fees , $ 115 a month , most boat owners find they spend well_over $ 200 a month for maintenance , insurance and property_taxes . The rental fees go_into a fund to run the marinas , including a Marine Bureau police_force of two_dozen officers who patrol around the clock and administer the rest of Long_Beach ' s waterfront . On top of those fees , there are often the kinds of surprise expenses -- engine parts , $ 200-a-gallon copper-based paint for the hull , new canvas -- that car owners never encounter . &quot; Things just keep going_up , &quot; says Russ Smith , 68 , a retired contractor who moved_into the Alamitos Bay Marina 33 years ago . &quot; When I first got here , it was 85 cents a foot. &quot; For some elderly slip renters , the boat can become a trap . With fixed incomes insufficient to cover the expenses and fees , they can find themselves living_on floating wrecks with insufficient funds to cover even basic maintenance . Karlice Cobb , 78 , lives in a cluttered 44-foot power boat that she and her late husband built more_than 20 years ago . Cobb , a cocker_spaniel and a cat survive on a small pension and a Social_Security check that is barely enough to cover her monthly slip fee of $ 547 . Cobb ' s Castle , as she calls her boat , has clearly seen better times , though a group of volunteers recently painted it for her . &quot; I haven ' t had it hauled out ( removed from the water so the hull can be repainted ) in almost three years , &quot; says Cobb , who tries to make ends meet by sewing and by handing_out food samples in a supermarket . Even just sitting in the marina , boats can molder into disrepair , boaters say . &quot; It ' s an extremely harsh environment out here , &quot; Lesner says . Wood-loving sea worms , corrosive salt water , dry_rot from puddling rainwater -- all_of these have to be fought the way a homeowner fights vermin . Neglect the haul-out every year or so , and you leave the hull vulnerable to worms and corrosion . &quot; When you least expect it , a plank will pop_out on you and you ' ve got a hole in your hull like this , &quot; Lesner says , holding his hands far enough apart to fit a large cantaloupe between them . Cobb , short and thin , with a mop of gray hair , has been living_on a boat for more_than 30 years , mostly , she says , because she gravitated instinctively to the sea . &quot; I don ' t think I could live_on the shore now , &quot; she says . &quot; If the boat sinks , I ' ll go_down with it. &quot; Boat owners are obligated to keep their vessels in a navigable condition , Anderson says . But live-aboards like Cobb represent a dilemma for the city , which has the power to evict owners who don ' t comply . &quot; The city obviously can ' t afford to repair boats , &quot; says Anderson , the Long_Beach Marine Bureau official . &quot; On the other hand , we don ' t want to add another homeless_person to the streets . It ' s a gray area. &quot; The sink-or-swim devotion to life on the water that Cobb speaks_to is widespread . Russ and Donna Smith think sometimes about moving onto land . &quot; But look_at the view we have , &quot; Smith says , indicating a broad sweep of open water on Alamitos Bay , where a flock of geese is coming_in_for a landing . &quot; For what I could sell the boat for , what would I get_on land ? A little tract house on some dingy street. &quot; The greatest challenge of living on a boat , Smith says , is fitting everything into the kinds of spaces where , if you stretch your arms too wide , you ' ll skin your knuckles . Most boats are like floating Swiss watches , with every little niche having a function . Smith shows you around his blocky-looking 51-foot power boat Tsunami . There are drawers under bunks , cabinets in walls , storage_spaces hidden under the cushions of a couch , a hatch leading to a footlocker-size hollow for tools and spare engine parts . Odd-size spaces are stuffed with canned goods and extra rolls of paper_towels . The galley is a square_yard of kitchen equipment , complete with microwave and oven , where Thanksgiving turkeys , carefully measured ahead of time , have been prepared . &quot; All the comforts of home -- except a washer and dryer , &quot; says Donna , who washes clothes at a local coin-operated laundry . On jaunts to Catalina or Dana Point , Russ presides over the little wheelhouse , which is equipped with radar , citizen ' s band and marine radios , depth sounder and electronic navigating equipment . For all his sailorly confidence , Russ , 68 , is an unlikely candidate for prime live-aboard booster . One of his earliest experiences of living aboard , as a 19-year-old Navy seaman , ended when he was dunked unceremoniously in the South Pacific after the aircraft_carrier Princeton was sunk by a Japanese dive bomber in October , 1944 , off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines . &quot; As far as I know , I ' m the only survivor who ' s living_on a boat , &quot; says Smith , who attends annual survivor reunions . Smith spent almost two hours in the ocean that day before a Navy destroyer picked him up . The Smiths had a close_call seven years ago , when a supertanker grazed the Tsunami in a fog just outside Long_Beach Harbor . &quot; It was going so fast , it sucked us in next to it , and we couldn ' t veer away , &quot; Donna says . That encounter resulted in $ 16 # 000 worth of damage to the Tsunami ' s port side , but it didn ' t dampen the Smiths ' enthusiasm for the boating life . They say the state-imposed limits on the number of live-aboards keep the marinas peaceful . &quot; It ' s like living_in a little , isolated town , &quot; Russ Smith says . The ideal live-aboard is a putterer with a knack for mechanics and an affinity for the Spartan life . Someone like Robert Pard , retired Air_Force pilot and firefighter . Pard and his wife , Norma , both 70 , have been living_on boats for 30 years . In 1964 , they sailed their first boat from Norway , across the Atlantic , through the Panama_Canal and up the Pacific coast of Central_America and Mexico to Long_Beach . The Pards ' current boat is the Posh , a trim , Finnish-made motorized sailboat with a teak-lined cabin . Pard ' s idea of a good time is tinkering with the boat ' s motor . &quot; I ' m a putterer , &quot; he says . &quot; There ' s always something to do . I can ' t sit in the rocking chair. &quot; When he ' s not fooling with the engine , he works_on the teak trim . Sanding and varnishing . &quot; There ' s more of that than anything , &quot; he says . Pard would like to see less clutter in its elegant salon and cozy stateroom . He ' s concerned about the accumulation of his wife ' s art supplies . She ' s into Japanese ink sketching at the moment , but there have been oil_painting binges , with bulky framed canvases piling_up in the staterooms . Life on a boat tests a married_couple ' s compatibility , Norma Pard says . &quot; Sure , there are little barbs now and then , &quot; she says . &quot; But the water is very soothing . You get_over it very quickly. &quot; Few boaters have gone as whole-hog into the boating life as movie producer Lesner , who has turned the Dorsal , a 70-year-old yacht once owned by a breakfast cereal heiress , into home , production office and haven from the stresses of The Industry . &quot; Being in Hollywood , you deal with people from time to time who want to pay you with cocaine , &quot; says Lesner , 45 , who expects to go_into production on his action feature &quot; Balloon &quot; later this year . &quot; You meet lawyers who try to bilk you . Then you come_out here where pretense does not exist. &quot; In the marina , Lesner says , he encounters mostly generous , unpretentious people . &quot; Some of them are millionaires , but not your classic millionaires , &quot; he says . &quot; They have holes in their jeans , and they ' ll come_over and crawl around in the bilges of your boat just to help with a problem. &quot; Lesner ' s &quot; office &quot; is the boat ' s fantail , where he sprawls across an upholstered banquette and does business over a telephone . Sometimes he slips into a Jacuzzi in the middle of the deck or studies the marina ' s wildlife . A pregnant sea_lion recently took_up residence on a dock near the boat , Lesner says , and herons and sandpipers often fly in . &quot; It ' s an amazing little ecological niche , &quot; he says . For live-aboards , the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake was nothing more_than another natural_phenomenon -- just a gentle jiggling of their boats from the back-and-forth movement of pilings pulling on moorings . &quot; You hear the slapping of the water on the bottom of the boat , &quot; says Russ Smith , &quot; and you can see the street_lamps whipping back and forth. &quot; The Bennetts , who run a metal processing plant in Downtown Los Angeles , slept through it . &quot; A guy who works with us called_at about 5:30 ( an hour after the quake ) and said , ' Did you realize we had a major earthquake ? ' &quot; recalled Jean Bennett . &quot; Frank said , ' Hold_on a minute , ' and he went and looked outside . He came_back and said , ' Well , I ' m in about 20 feet of water. ' &quot; As people from elsewhere in the region tried to piece their lives back together , sweeping away rubble and glass , nothing had changed for the Bennetts , the Smiths , the Pards and the rest . Nothing at all . The Cost of Living Aboard A boat used to be the cheaper way to live . Today , living aboard can be expensive . This is what it would cost per month to live_in a Long_Beach marina if your boat is 50 feet long and cost $ 100 # 000 : Boat payment : $ 806 * Slip rental ( $ 9.63 per foot ) : 482 Live-aboard fee ( including utilities and parking ) : 115 Maintenance , including annual hull cleaning : 84 Property_tax and other taxes : 75 Insurance : 117 Total : $ 1 # 679 * On a 20-year loan at 7 1 / 2 % Source : City of Long_Beach ; Dimen Marine Financial Services , Newport Beach</TEXT>
