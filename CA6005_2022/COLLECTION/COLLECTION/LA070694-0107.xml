   <HEADLINE> WEST VALLEY FOCUS : AGOURA ; SPOTLIGHT ON SILENT FILMS AT PARAMOUNT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s about to be very quiet at Paramount Ranch . The National_Park_Service and the Silent Society of Hollywood Heritage are teaming_up for the sixth year to present &quot; Silents Under the Stars , &quot; two nights of silent films in the rustic Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area . The program raises money for park service_programs and Hollywood Heritage , which promotes appreciation of historic Hollywood films and locations . Accompanied by live music , &quot; The Night Cry &quot; ( 1926 ) and &quot; Manhandled &quot; ( 1924 ) will be shown at the ranch ' s pavilion , an open-sided building built by Paramount Studios to house props in the late 1920s . The ranch was the setting of countless Paramount Westerns during the 1930s and 1940s , as well as films such_as &quot; The Adventures of Marco Polo &quot; and &quot; The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. &quot; After Paramount sold the property in the late 1940s , it changed hands several times , but in 1981 , 300 acres of the ranch were acquired by the park service . The site is used for concerts , festivals and picnics , but parts of it still serve as a Western set for television , film and music video productions . &quot; The Night Cry &quot; will be shown at 8 p.m. July 17 , and &quot; Manhandled &quot; will be shown at 7:30 p.m. Aug . 21 . Both will be accompanied by short_subjects . The cost of each is $ 5 for members of Hollywood Heritage and $ 6 for non-members . For information , call ( 818 ) 597-9192 . SUSAN BYRNES</TEXT>
