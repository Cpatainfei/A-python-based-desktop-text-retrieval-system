   <HEADLINE> COALITION PROPOSES PUBLIC QUAKE INSURER ; INSURANCE : CONSUMER GROUPS CALL ON THE LEGISLATURE TO CREATE A NONPROFIT VEHICLE TO SOLVE HOMEOWNERS CRISIS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A coalition of consumer groups , convinced that the California homeowners insurance crisis is being trumped_up by insurance_companies , called_on Gov . Pete Wilson and the Legislature Wednesday to create a public nonprofit corporation to be the sole seller of earthquake and homeowners insurance . The groups -- the Center for Public Interest Law , Consumer Action , the Economic Empowerment Foundation , the Utility Consumers Action Network and the Proposition 103 Enforcement Project -- also asked that in the interim , insurance_companies be prohibited from withdrawing from the homeowners and earthquake insurance market . Their proposal for a public insurance vehicle comes as state officials , business_organizations and other interest_groups are debating how to provide consumers with earthquake protection when the insurance industry considers the coverage too risky for conventional underwriting . Citing claims of $ 6 billion or more from the Northridge earthquake , many of the state ' s largest carriers have recently either halted or severely restricted their writings of both homeowners and earthquake insurance . Insurers say they would resume selling homeowners coverage if the state would drop its requirement that homeowners insurers also offer earthquake coverage . The consumer groups say the industry has seized_on the Jan . 17 quake as a way to obtain unjustified price increases on homeowners insurance while abandoning the riskier earthquake line . * They made the charge in a lengthy letter Wednesday to Wilson and other top state officials . A public insurance corporation , the groups wrote , &quot; would significantly reduce the cost of the coverage by eliminating the profit_margin private insurers now demand. &quot; But Marjorie M . Berte , Wilson ' s insurance adviser , said Wednesday that making insurance coverage public still doesn ' t solve the problem of how to build_up a fund big enough to cover another Northridge-size quake or a bigger one . &quot; California is in no position to pledge cash or borrowing to cover that kind of catastrophe , &quot; she said . Kenneth Cooley , a vice_president for State Farm Mutual Automobile_Insurance Co. , California ' s largest property insurer , said a California-only public corporation would also lack private carriers ' ability to call_in employees from around the country to handle claims after a major disaster . The consumer coalition ' s plan , plus proposals for an insurance industry-financed earthquake pool , are among the topics to be discussed Friday in a meeting at State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi ' s San Francisco offices . Real_estate industry officials and bond market experts have been added_to the list of business people invited to the second such problem-solving session . The first was held last week .</TEXT>
