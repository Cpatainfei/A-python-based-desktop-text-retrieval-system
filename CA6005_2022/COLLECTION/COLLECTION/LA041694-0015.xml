   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; ADOPTING A TOUGHER POLICY ; FOREIGN ADOPTIONS ARE BEING CURTAILED IN MANY LATIN_AMERICAN COUNTRIES . ALARM AT CORRUPTION AND RUMORS OF RUTHLESS AMERICANS ON THE PROWL FOR TINY ORGAN_DONORS ARE BEHIND THE CRACKDOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> According to lurid rumors that keep popping_up across Latin_America , sinister foreigners are buying or stealing babies through bogus adoptions and taking them abroad to use as donors for organ transplants . Though never proven , such stories sometimes appear in print , raising waves of public panic and occasionally triggering violence . Late last month , for example , Guatemalan villagers severely beat a woman from the United States who was rumored to have snatched a local child -- the youngster later turned_up . Naturally , these rumors give international adoption a bad name in this region , as do the bribery and fraud that sometimes accompany the adoption processes -- sticky strands in the complex web that has kept James Gagel captive here for more_than two years . Peruvian authorities arrested Gagel , a lawyer from New Jersey , in February , 1992 , and charged him with_child trafficking . He spent a year in jail and is now barred from leaving the country as he awaits judgment on accusations that he headed a group that allegedly bought or kidnaped babies for Americans to adopt . Gagel ' s Peruvian lawyer argues that there is &quot; absolutely no factual basis &quot; for the charges . Gagel says he is the victim of persecution by corrupt , ignorant and xenophobic Peruvians . His trial has been repeatedly postponed by glitches in the judicial_proceedings , which he likens to a fictional nightmare . &quot; I ' m in the middle , really , of a Kafka novel , &quot; he said over breakfast one day last month in a hotel cafe . For many years , North_Americans and Europeans have encountered controversy when they adopt babies in Latin_American countries . While bribes are often useful and sometimes necessary to cut red_tape , lawyers say , reports of falsification of documents and other fraud have triggered suspicions of baby buying . Suspicions have also been fed by the recurring rumors of children being adopted by foreigners who want to exploit them not only for &quot; spare_parts &quot; but as prostitutes or household servants . Gagel said a police commander who accused him of child trafficking claimed that adopted babies were sent to the United States for use in scientific experiments . Gagel ' s case is symptomatic_of a moral quandary faced today by many Latin_American countries : International adoptions could save thousands of Latin_American children from lives of misery or early death by neglect , but controversy and corruption raise troubling questions . Peruvian bureaucrats and judges , nervous about scandals , have sharply reduced the number of international adoptions in the last two years . According to the U.S. Consulate in Lima , U.S. visas issued for children adopted here dropped from 620 in the 1991 fiscal_year to 270 in 1992 and to 170 in 1993 . Since this fiscal_year began Oct . 1 , no Americans have been able to adopt Peruvian children . Meanwhile , according to statistics compiled by CARE International , an estimated 68 of every 1 # 000 babies born in Peru die before they are a year old , compared to about 10 per 1 # 000 in the United States . Some Latin_American countries have even higher infant_mortality_rates , such_as neighboring Bolivia , with 89 per 1 # 000 , according to CARE . Gagel , 37 , reflected on such numbers as he finished a plate of sliced papaya . &quot; Even though adoption represents a small percentage , it does have its value to give a_few of these children a good home , a good future , &quot; he said . But in Peru and an increasing number of other countries of the region , sentiment against international adoptions and stricter new regulations are hindering the placement of babies in foreign homes . As a result , Latin_America is no longer as abundant a source of adopted U.S. children as it once was . &quot; I think you can say that there are fewer possibilities in all_of these countries than before , &quot; said Heino Erichsen , executive_director of Los Ninos , an international adoption agency in The Woodlands , Tex . &quot; An adopting couple has the simple idea of coming_to the Third_World , finding a child , loving it , raising it , &quot; Gagel said . &quot; That idea meets with opposition here. &quot; The opposition , he said , includes nationalists who resent North_Americans taking_away children of the fatherland ; leftists who see adoptions by Americans as Yankee imperialism ; underpaid bureaucrats and judges with power over adoption paperwork who envy babies taken from the bottom of the social scale to foreign countries where they will live_in relative luxury ; some who envy adoption lawyers with new cars and cellular_telephones , and others who carry_on a long tradition of dislike for foreigners . &quot; There is a lot of pleasure here in getting a gringo in your jaws and venting some of your centuries-old resentment , &quot; he said . But not all Peruvians who worry about international adoptions have anti-U.S. sentiments . Many merely want to prevent crooked deals that can result from a combination of unscrupulous lawyers , corrupt officials and foreign couples with money and a burning desire to be parents . &quot; They combine to turn a child into an object of commerce , of deceit , &quot; a former juvenile judge said . In Peru , child-stealing rumors mesh nicely with a centuries-old folk myth about a diabolical being who drugs unwary people who venture out at night and extracts their body humors , or &quot; greases. &quot; Called Pishtako in the native Quechua language of the Andean highlands , this bogyman was increasingly depicted as a white foreigner . In 20th-Century versions , &quot; greases &quot; from the Pishtako ' s victims were exported to the United States to lubricate or fuel machinery . &quot; Thus , satellites supposedly were being fed by the ' grease ' of Peruvians , &quot; said Luis Millones , an anthropologist and historian . The evolving myth has fostered an antipathy toward adoption , Millones said . &quot; The people are thinking , ' Why do they want these children ? ' &quot; The recurrent rumor of adoptions for &quot; spare_parts &quot; was running strong in 1992 when Gagel ' s arrest exploded in scandal on the front pages of Lima tabloids . Here , it must have seemed to some , was a real-life Pishtako caught in the act . Many Latin_American countries -- including Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Honduras , Paraguay and Guatemala -- have witnessed equally blustery storms of &quot; baby-buying &quot; and &quot; baby-stealing &quot; scandals . &quot; The Guatemalan press right now is absolutely raving insane over this issue , in_relation_to using babies for body_parts and for carrying drugs , &quot; said Gerry Fuller , an official in the State_Department visa office . The woman from the United States who was beaten_in Guatemala last month was chased by villagers into a municipal building in the northern town of San Cristobal Verapaz and hit with machetes , clubs and metal pipes until she lost_consciousness . June Weinstock , a 51-year-old environmentalist from Fairbanks , Alaska , remains in a coma and was airlifted to the United States on Wednesday . Also last month , rumors of another U.S. woman ' s arrest for stealing a baby sparked disturbances in the Guatemalan village of Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa . Villagers burned_down the local police_station and destroyed several vehicles , the Reuters news_agency reported . It said at least 15 people were injured in clashes with police after rumors spread that the woman had paid several thousand dollars to be released . In Honduras at the beginning of March , the government promised an investigation of unconfirmed reports that Honduran children were being sold abroad for organ transplants . Honduran police have reported raiding &quot; fattening houses &quot; where babies allegedly stolen or bought from poor mothers are cared_for until they are adopted . It was in Honduras in January , 1987 , that rumors of trafficking in children ' s organs were first published in a daily newspaper , according to a U.S. Information Service report . In April , 1987 , the Soviet newspaper Pravda published the Honduran story -- without noting that it had been denied by authorities . The Soviet news_agency Tass sent the story around the world , and similar versions have been reappearing ever since . While such stories have raised public suspicions , clear evidence of corruption has been even more damaging . In Peru , hardly anyone will deny that bribes have been paid to mothers , judges and other court officials , government attorneys and police . &quot; There were a lot of people involved in this , in the child-trafficking Mafias , &quot; said Jaime Jesus , coordinator in Peru for the Stockholm-based Save the Children foundation . A Peruvian adoption lawyer who asked that his name be withheld admitted that he has routinely bribed officials as a necessary means of making paperwork move . He denied paying mothers for babies , but he acknowledged that he often gave women &quot; gifts &quot; after they gave_up their children . &quot; I would give them enough to live_on for two or three months , &quot; he said . Gagel , a 1982 Rutgers University law graduate with a record of public_service in New Jersey and New York , denies that he ever gave gifts or bribes in exchange for a baby . In fact , he said , it was his refusal to pay bribes that led to his troubles . He came_to Peru in 1989 on a Fulbright fellowship to help reform the criminal justice system and stayed_on to start an international adoption service with a Peruvian lawyer in 1990 . This was a tricky business in Peru , as in many Latin_American countries . Red_tape was massive . To get_through , it often required bribes . Gagel said the adoptions he handled were done_in Peruvian provinces to avoid red_tape and corruption in Lima . One of the papers required for an adoption was a police certificate to show that the baby was not a missing person . Gagel said Cmdr . Victor Prado , former head of the police missing persons bureau in Lima , charged $ 300 for each certificate , but Gagel refused to pay . It was the same Cmdr . Prado who first accused Gagel and 22 Peruvians of operating a child-trafficking ring . The 22 included employees of Gagel ' s office , his lawyer-partner , foster_mothers who took_care of babies to be adopted and people whose names were &quot; found in my card file , people I didn ' t even know , &quot; Gagel said . Prado ' s police raided Gagel ' s home and office , confiscating papers and a computer . Prado himself arrested Gagel at 7:30 a.m. in his apartment , beating him and screaming obscenities , according to Gagel . Gagel pressed charges against Prado for a series of violations , but those charges were dismissed . The charges against Gagel , however , resulted in indictments . The government attorney who brought the original charges said Gagel ' s &quot; ring &quot; had arranged thousands of irregular adoptions . Gagel said he arranged no more_than 40 , all by the book . He said a_few Peruvian lawyers have reaped big profits from international adoptions but that he earned only a modest income from them . The only biological mother who complained about one of his adoptions had been &quot; reading stories about organ parts for transplants , &quot; he said . She was worried because she hadn ' t received a letter for several months from the adoptive parents , a professional couple in the San Francisco area . Last year , The Hague Conference on international_law adopted a convention on adoptions that is intended to standardize legal processes from country to country , reducing red_tape and guarding against irregularities . Countries that ratify the convention must establish a central authority for overseeing adoptions and assuring that they comply with The Hague standards . Many Latin_American countries , including Peru , are preparing to ratify the convention . To comply , Peru has passed a new adoption law that empowers a Technical Secretariat for Adoption to determine the eligibility of children for adoption and to match them with eligible adopting parents . Since it began working in August , the new secretariat has awarded custody of children to 20 Peruvian couples and a single Canadian couple in the process of adopting . No longer may private lawyers seek_out mothers to give their babies up for adoption by clients . &quot; Now the mother has to give it up_to the government welfare agency , which they don ' t like to do , &quot; said Erichsen of Los Ninos , speaking by telephone from Texas . Jorge Valencia , a lawyer on the new Peruvian secretariat ' s board of directors , said some deceptive adoption lawyers used to induce foreign clients to spend up_to $ 30 # 000 in fees and expenses for an adoption , including payments to biological mothers . &quot; There are indications that there was a whole situation of corruption , &quot; Valencia said . &quot; What we want to avoid is child trafficking -- that a mother is paid $ 500 for her child , or $ 1 # 000. &quot; He admitted that adoption now is not &quot; a fast process . You have to investigate . You have to publish notices. &quot; One analyst observed that because officials no longer get bribes to speed things up , they naturally go slower . And because private lawyers no longer are permitted to shepherd paperwork through the bureaucracy and courts , the task falls to the secretariat ' s limited staff . Diplomatic observers say the secretariat has a tiny budget and that its few employees are underpaid and untrained . The secretariat operates only in Lima , so no adoptions can be done_in the provinces . &quot; The system now doesn ' t function , &quot; said Julio Lozano , Peruvian representative for the Spence Chapin adoption agency of New York . Lozano said the only children his agency has been offered for adoption are more_than 7 years old and have mental or physical handicaps . &quot; Who is going_to want to adopt a child with problems , especially at that age ? &quot; he asked , adding that the secretariat apparently does not want international adoptions . The secretariat said its priority is to give babies to Peruvian couples ahead of foreign couples . Officials have said that about 100 couples in Lima are looking_for babies and that only one adoption in 10 will be granted to foreigners until the Peruvian demand has been met . &quot; We aren ' t against international adoptions , &quot; Valencia said , &quot; but we want them to be done under the strictest controls , the strictest judicial rules. &quot;</TEXT>
