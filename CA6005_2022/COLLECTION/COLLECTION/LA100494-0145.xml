   <HEADLINE> GM GETS IT IN GEAR ; AUTOMOBILES : VALUE PRICING STRATEGY HELPS CAR_MAKER REV UP ITS MARKET SHARE , WHICH HAD PLUNGED IN CALIFORNIA OVER A DECADE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a decade of losing ground to foreign car_makers and domestic rivals in the all-important California car market , General Motors appears finally to have launched an effective counterattack . Thanks partly to an innovative -- though not universally acclaimed -- sales strategy called value pricing , GM has boosted its long-sagging California sales across its seven divisions by 20 % during the 1994 model year , GM said . In contrast , during the same September-through-August period , car and truck sales were up 4 % for the balance of the automotive industry , GM said , citing figures compiled by J.D. Power &amp; Associates . The sales surge lifted GM ' s share of the California market to 22.1 % through June , up 1.6 % since August , 1993 , according to the latest statistics available from R.L. Polk &amp; Co . That was the best showing by any auto_maker and a remarkably hefty gain for a company that watched in agony as GM ' s California market share slid 10 % in 10 years , finally crashing at 18 % in 1992 . As the 1995 model year gets under way , GM says it is in a virtual dead_heat with Ford for the top spot in the California car market , and GM ' s sales momentum won ' t be hurt now that last week ' s strike has been settled at its plant in Flint , Mich . A number of factors contributed to GM ' s California turnaround , including a 7 % decline in the dollar against the Japanese yen in the past year . Exchange_rate pressures have therefore pushed_up the price of Japanese cars sold in the United States , making many American models a better deal . As a result , GM said Japanese auto_makers lost 3.4 % of the California market from September through June . A gradually recovering California economy has also boosted GM sales . But if you ask GM officials why their company ' s gains outpaced the advances of Ford and Chrysler over the past year , the answer is clear . &quot; Value pricing is mostly responsible , &quot; said Ann Pattyn , who orchestrates the GM program from its regional headquarters in Thousand Oaks , the company ' s nerve_center for its Southern California dealer network and sales strategies . To GM , value pricing means limiting option packages to just one or two combinations for each vehicle , and selling at discounted sticker prices that , in theory , are not negotiable . Through value pricing , GM undercuts the competition on similarly equipped cars . For example , GM ' s Pontiac Grand Am SE comes_with an air_bag , a stereo , air conditioning and other options for a no-dicker price of $ 13 # 995 . A comparably equipped Toyota Camry DX , GM said , is listed at $ 20 # 822 . Similarly , a value-priced Chevrolet Lumina is $ 3 # 000 less than a comparably equipped Ford Taurus GL . The aim of_value pricing , Pattyn said , is to simplify car shopping and eliminate the haggling that makes car buying so unsavory . But some GM dealers say the introduction of popular new designs , such_as the Pontiac Firebird , and vastly improved quality ratings of GM cars have had much more to do with enhanced sales than value pricing . * At Livingston Motor Car Co. , a Buick and Pontiac dealership in Woodland Hills , sales have surged by 16 % over the past model year . But sales manager Terry Billingsley said to attribute that increase to value pricing &quot; is a real stretch. &quot; Indeed , many GM dealers say they have been hurt by value pricing because it boosts GM ' s profits at their expense . Gil Schneider , who operates GM dealerships in Van Nuys , said sales of Oldsmobiles and Buicks are up 9 % this model year , thanks largely to value pricing , but his profit per vehicle is $ 200 less . &quot; If I could triple my volume , I could make_it that way , &quot; Schneider said . &quot; But GM isn ' t in a position to triple my volume. &quot; Nevertheless , GM is clearly smitten with the program because it helps do_away_with rebates , financing incentives and other costly promotions . Also , offering just a_few option packages on most vehicles simplifies GM ' s production process and boosts GM ' s profits by forcing consumers to buy cars loaded with more features than they might otherwise choose . In the 12 months since the program was launched in August of 1993 , GM has sold 232 # 093 vehicles in California , 38 # 288 more_than a year earlier . And though less than half of GM ' s 1994 models were value priced , they accounted_for more_than 70 % of sales . GM considers the program such a huge success that the company is expanding it . In 1995 , the number of value-priced models will be increased to 70 from 46 , and Pattyn said she expects those vehicles to account_for up_to 85 % of sales . And though value pricing has until now been largely a California experiment , the company is slowly moving to expand it nationwide . Value pricing has boosted sales of certain GM models , Billingsley said , but not others . Sales at his Woodland Hills dealership of the Buick Regal have more_than tripled to 15 a month since the car was value priced , for example , but sales of the Buick LeSabre are unchanged at 12 per month . Both cars are luxury sedans , but unlike the Regal , the LeSabre lacked leather seats , a keyless entry system , a power antenna and a_few other features . Despite these shortcomings , the LeSabre ' s sticker price was $ 1 # 500 higher than the Regal ' s . GM has squeezed dealer margins by lowering suggested prices for consumers , while often raising the price dealers pay the factory . At Livingston , for example , a well-equipped 1994 LeSabre lists for $ 20 # 195 , about $ 300 below the 1993 sticker price before value pricing was instituted . Meanwhile , the wholesale price Livingston pays GM has gone_up by about $ 1 # 350 , Billingsley said . Dealers also complained that even though value pricing is supposed to mean no price dickering with customers , competition among GM dealers is so fierce that they often feel compelled to sell below the sticker price . Consumers rarely pay sticker prices anyway , said James Bragg , who operates the Fighting Chance consumer information service in Long_Beach , so GM &quot; reducing &quot; the sticker price doesn ' t necessarily mean consumers are paying less . Bragg also complained that GM is using value pricing to attract buyers to slow-selling models , while some of GM ' s most sought-after vehicles -- including the Chevrolet Camaro , the Oldsmobile Aurora and the newly designed Chevrolet Blazer -- are conspicuously missing from the value-priced list . &quot; If value pricing is good for everyone , then why doesn ' t GM put it on the cars that people really want to buy ? &quot; said Bragg , who offered another question : &quot; How come no one else is rushing to follow GM into value-pricing land ? &quot; The simple answer , analysts say , is they don ' t need to . Chrysler , which has enjoyed brisk sales in recent years , has all but sworn it won ' t engage in value pricing . And Ford employs the strategy on only a handful of its models . &quot; We only really do that where we see a situation where the segment has shrunk , or there is a value problem , &quot; said Keith Magee , general_manager of Ford ' s Lincoln-Mercury division . that ' s fine with GM , which would n ' t mind cornering the value-pricing market . &quot; This ( strategy ) was perceived as high risk in the beginning , &quot; Pattyn said . But now , for the first time in years , GM is talking_about its once-soaring market share not as a painful memory , but as a realistic long-term goal . &quot; It ' s possible , &quot; Pattyn said .</TEXT>
