   <HEADLINE> MARKET FOCUS ; CHINESE WORKERS FACE FRUSTRATIONS IN SOUTH_KOREA ; MOST ARE ETHNIC KOREANS , BUT THEY OFTEN DON ' T FEEL AT_HOME . LOW PAY , LONG HOURS AND CULTURE SHOCK ARE COMMON COMPLAINTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Choi Hyon Chul was born in northeast China , but he ' s an ethnic Korean and used to root for the Korean team whenever China and South_Korea faced_off in international sports competitions . He felt he was Korean . That was before Choi left his factory job in China ' s Jilin province , which abuts the Korean_peninsula , and came_to South_Korea to work illegally on construction sites . Here in Korea , despite his fluency in the language , Choi found his identity in crisis again . Working in the land of his Korean ancestors did not make him want to stay_on and try to assimilate . To the contrary , he was soon backing the Chinese side when athletic teams from the two countries met . &quot; This was our ancestral home , but we were born and grew_up in China , &quot; he said of himself and other ethnic Koreans from China . &quot; Although we speak the language , our habits aren ' t the same . There ' s no problem with daily life , ( but ) hunting for work , doing business -- these are the things we don ' t understand. &quot; Even though wages here vastly exceed what they could earn at_home , life for most is a constant struggle . Choi is one of more_than 31 # 000 Chinese citizens -- 80 % of them ethnic Koreans -- now in South_Korea . Nearly all have come_to work , some legally , with work_permits under euphemistically named &quot; training &quot; programs , but the majority illegally , coming_in on visitor visas and overstaying the time_limit . The flow of Korean Chinese to South_Korea reflects a slowly spreading diplomatic thaw in northeastern Asia that could eventually lead to Korean reunification . But frustrations in the exchange of workers like Choi provide a warning : Any sudden integration of North_Korean workers into South_Korea ' s far more prosperous system would be fraught with difficulties . Like North_Koreans , the Korean Chinese laborers grew_up under communism and can speak Korean . A key difference is that they also have experienced China ' s past 15 years of market-oriented reforms . Yet even with that experience , few fit_in here . Most yearn to save_up money and go_home . About 78 # 000 foreign laborers , including the Korean Chinese , are now working in South_Korea . Nearly all have tough or unpleasant jobs that most South_Koreans disdain . This increasingly prosperous country has even adopted into the Korean language the label &quot; 3-D &quot; jobs -- shorthand for the_English words &quot; dirty , difficult or dangerous &quot; -- to describe the work the foreigners do . Whether they have come as contract laborers or are working illegally , their pay is usually less than that of their South_Korean counterparts . Choi earns more_than $ 1 # 250 a month in Seoul , a princely sum compared to the $ 50 a month he earned in China , but several hundred dollars less than his Korean co-workers here . The money , however , does not completely make_up for painful attitudes . &quot; The treatment here isn ' t equal , so most ( Korean Chinese ) are unhappy , &quot; Choi said . &quot; The bosses think China is underdeveloped , and they treat people from China as lower-class . It creates bad feelings. &quot; Yoo Jung Ho , a scholar working with the South_Korean government ' s Economic Planning_Board , said that labor-intensive industries that are facing competition from low-wage nations are urging the government to let_in even more foreign workers . But this can be only a short-term solution , and it risks creating social problems at_home and diplomatic troubles abroad , he said . &quot; It helps some businesses temporarily , but it creates all sorts of other problems , &quot; Yoo said . Some Koreans treat the foreigners badly , he explained : &quot; They may try to give them as little money as possible and try to extract as much time as possible from them . that ' s already happening . &quot; Some of these people are from China , Korean descendants , and they not only get disappointed in the South_Korean government , sometimes they hate South_Korea for treating them like that . They go_back to China and they talk with North_Koreans . I don ' t think that ' s good for reunification . For South and North_Korea eventually to be able to successfully reunite , there should be no hatred or no misgivings about each other , but we are exactly creating that by maltreating Korean workers from China. &quot; South_Korean Minister of Labor Affairs Nam Jae Hee acknowledged in an interview that resentment is sometimes created because foreign trainees &quot; are paid far less &quot; than regular workers . &quot; Some policy_changes may be in_order to pay them equally as the normal workers , after the training period is over , &quot; he said . But the minister doubted that the situation could affect perceptions of the two Koreas . Ethnic Koreans in China still &quot; are very much envious of the economic development in South_Korea , &quot; he said , and Seoul does not consider it a serious security problem to have so many ethnic Koreans here from China , despite that country ' s Communist government and close ties to the north . &quot; Because North_Korea is such a failure , nobody fears the ideological connection , &quot; Nam said . But sometimes trouble arises from a complex clash of expectations rooted in differences between the two societies . Employers often think foreign workers should accept their position at the bottom rung of the employment ladder and be thankful for the opportunity to save_up far more money than they could at_home . Long hours of overtime are not unusual in South_Korea and may be welcomed by some workers seeking to boost their incomes . But factory_workers in China generally work an eight-hour day , and while pay may be low , demands usually are not too high . Many are shocked to discover how hard they are expected to work in South_Korea . Fairly typical is the experience of a 54-year-old Korean Chinese woman from a village in Heilongjiang province . She quit her first job , at a restaurant in Seoul , after just one month . &quot; It was too tiring , &quot; explained the woman , who wished to be identified only by her surname , Jin . &quot; You ' re standing_for 12 hours a day . Your legs hurt . It ' s very hard to find an eight-hour job if you ' re not a South_Korean citizen. &quot; Jin later found work as a live-in maid , earning almost $ 900 a month . But she recently quit that job too . &quot; There was too_much work : ' Do this ! Do that ! ' I wasn ' t willing to listen to them anymore , &quot; she said . Jin said she is looking_for other work , and meanwhile her husband is earning $ 1 # 900 a month as a construction worker . They expect to return to China after two years in South_Korea with enough money to buy homes for their two sons , she said . &quot; In China , you can ' t earn this much money in 10 years , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' m happy I came . It ' s just that the work is so hard I can barely endure it. &quot; * A 48-year-old Korean Chinese man from Harbin , who asked to be identified only by his surname , Li , said that , before coming here nearly three years ago , he thought_of Korea as his &quot; motherland. &quot; But now he looks_forward to going_home to China . &quot; Our blood is the same , but the background is different , &quot; he said . &quot; China is Communist and South_Korea is capitalist . Our thinking is different . There are lots of difficulties in living here . Materially it ' s fine . But in terms of people ' s attitudes , it ' s very difficult . They have a class system . Rich people can mistreat poor people . &quot; In China , although I am of Korean ancestry , I was never discriminated against this way . Then I came here , and although I ' m of the same blood , I ' ve been mistreated very badly. &quot; Li , who has bounced from one job to the next , complained bitterly about newspaper_advertisements that he said describe jobs that sound reasonable but actually entail much more severe demands . But some , like Jin Zhenghua , 25 , a Korean Chinese peasant woman who solders sensor parts , accept their situation philosophically . &quot; Of course we wish we had higher wages , but that ' s impossible , &quot; said Jin , 25 , who now earns about $ 300 a month at the Dong Kwang Sensor Industrial Co . in Seoul . &quot; The reason they want us here is so they can save money. &quot; Times researcher Chi Jung Nam in Seoul contributed to this report .</TEXT>
