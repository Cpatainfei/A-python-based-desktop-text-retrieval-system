   <HEADLINE> THE COMPANY SHE KEEPS ; DRUNK DRIVING : CANDY LIGHTNER SAYS SHE STILL WANTS REFORMS . BUT NOW THAT THE MADD FOUNDER WORKS FOR RESTAURANTS , SOME WONDER WHOSE SIDE SHE ' S REALLY ON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Candy Lightner went_to work_at a consulting_firm that represents restaurants that serve alcohol , she considered the job compatible with her past as the crusading founder of Mothers Against Drunk Driving . But that hasn ' t been the media perception . In a sudden wave of publicity this month , Lightner has found herself portrayed in news_stories and on talk_shows as having joined the enemy . &quot; MADD Founder Switches Sides &quot; was a typical headline , and &quot; lobbyist for the liquor industry &quot; the typical job description when the media discovered Lightner ' s new position . Lightner , who founded MADD in Fair Oaks , Calif. , in 1980 when her 13-year-old daughter Cari was killed by a drunk driver , says she has not changed sides . &quot; I am a government relations consultant on public policy issues , and it ' s something I have wanted to do for a long_time , &quot; she says . Lightner accepted the job in November with Rick Berman , whose Washington , D.C.-based Berman and Co. ' s clients include the American Beverage Institute , a 4 # 000-member trade organization representing restaurants and other establishments that serve alcohol . She will lobby state legislatures to reject laws that lower the legal standard for driving under the influence to . 08 % blood-alcohol level because she agrees with the restaurant industry ' s position that these are not the dangerous drivers and it is counterproductive to waste law_enforcement resources on them . Only a_few states , including California , have . 08 % laws . Most use . 10 % . &quot; Lowering the level accomplishes nothing . I think we should target the repeat offenders -- they are the real danger on our roads , &quot; says Lightner , recalling that the man who killed her daughter had a long record of DUI arrests and had just been bailed_out on a hit-and-run drunk-driving charge . * Berman says Lightner will lobby state legislatures for laws that distinguish among light , moderate and heavy drinkers , and adjust the penalties accordingly . &quot; We think that as a person ' s blood-alcohol level goes_up , the penalties should get stiffer , &quot; Berman says . &quot; The restaurant industry has never done this before. &quot; &quot; This escalated penalty plan is a new approach in our country and I ' m very excited about it , &quot; Lightner says . The American Beverage Institute maintains that the . 08 % standard makes criminals of social_drinkers and weakens law_enforcement by stretching it over a wider pool of drivers than is necessary . With this position , Lightner breaks ranks with MADD and other organizations in the anti-drunk driving movement . MADD ' s national president , Rebecca Brown of Tampa , Fla. , says she doesn ' t criticize Lightner , who to the public personifies MADD ' s success . The group has grown to 3 million members and is credited with toughening laws against drunk driving in every state and with reducing alcohol-related deaths on America ' s highways . &quot; Candy made a great difference in America and we can only be grateful , &quot; Brown says . &quot; The issue here is not Candy Lightner . It ' s . 08 and we are_on different sides of that issue . We have a great_deal of research and evidence that even experienced drivers are impaired at that blood-alcohol level. &quot; California MADD worked_on the campaign to lower the state ' s blood alcohol level to . 08 % . Michelle Payne at the Sacramento office says the group has received only a_few calls about Lightner and that all comments on policy come from the national office . MADD is lobbying for . 08 because its leaders think this is an achievable goal , Brown says . &quot; However , we believe that no one should drive after drinking , period. &quot; * Lightner says she is surprised at the negative reaction to her new post , since much of her progress with MADD was made in conjunction with the restaurant industry and she was praised for the results . &quot; We got them , in some cases , to eliminate happy_hours , and two-for-one drinks , and to initiate mandatory server training for bartenders and things like designated drivers and free taxi service , &quot; she says . After Lightner left MADD in 1985 , she wrote a book about grieving , &quot; Giving Sorrow Words , &quot; published in 1990 . Last year , she turned her attention to Americans Against Crime , a citizens ' group aimed at stemming violent crime . &quot; We couldn ' t raise the money to keep it going , &quot; she says . &quot; It was partly the economy. &quot; Lightner , who has two grown children , lives in Alexandria , Va . She says she joined Berman ' s firm because she wants to continue to make a difference . &quot; I ' ve only been doing this for 2 1 / 2 months and I ' m not discouraged . I believe strongly in what I ' m doing and I have no problem about the world knowing. &quot; Of her relationship with MADD , she says , the disagreement is with the blood-alcohol level and nothing more . &quot; I oppose . 08 and I advocate escalated penalties . I haven ' t switched to the ' other side. ' The ' other side ' is being a defense_attorney for drunk drivers. &quot;</TEXT>
