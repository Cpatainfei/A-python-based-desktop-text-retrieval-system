   <HEADLINE> SCIENTISTS THINK EACH BIG QUAKE SETS_UP ANOTHER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scientists investigating the cat ' s cradle of faults underlying Southern California believe the Northridge earthquake -- the costliest in U.S. history -- measurably increased the quake potential in areas of metropolitan Los Angeles in a pattern that seems to have shaped major temblors here since 1933 . A new analysis of nine serious earthquakes over the past 61 years suggests that each relayed enough subtle stress along the region ' s intricate fault_lines to trigger a subsequent serious earthquake years later , like a falling domino knocking_over the next block in_line . The stress generated by the 1971 Sylmar earthquake , for example , may have triggered the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake and advanced the onset of January ' s devastating Northridge temblor by several decades , a team of earthquake experts reported todayin the journal Science . In a sense , the precariously balanced faults underlying the region can feel one another tremble across space and time , even though the amount of force involved may be no more_than that generated by a person pressing his palms together . No one knows exactly what triggers any one earthquake or what dictates its timing . Scientists have been groping_for decades toward an understanding of the signals that precede a major seismic shock . The new insight into the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake arises from an analysis of the shifting tensions generated by local quakes of magnitude 6 or more , done_by scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park , the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts and the Institut de Physique du Globe in Strasbourg , France . The researchers emphasized that their work cannot be used to predict when the next major earthquake will occur in Southern California , but that it can serve as a reliable indicator of where the earthquake potential in the Los Angeles region has risen and where it has dropped . Other earthquake experts said Thursday they were intrigued by the work but remained skeptical . &quot; It is interesting , but it is not proven , &quot; said USGS seismologist Lucile M . Jones in Pasadena . &quot; The work is important , but it is as much for the questions that it raises as for what it answers . If the ( Sylmar ) quake really triggered Northridge , then what made_it wait for 23 years ? &quot; In its study , the team calculated that the cumulative effect of all_the major earthquakes in the region since 1933 has been to lessen the stress throughout a zone extending from the San Fernando Valley south to the coast and along the San Andreas Fault between the Tejon Pass and Palmdale . However , stresses have increased in a region encompassing the central Los Angeles Basin and areas west of Northridge . &quot; We all know that earthquakes drop stress , but they also increase the stress at other points . These stress changes are small and cannot produce an earthquake by themselves , &quot; said USGS earthquake expert Ross S . Stein , who led the team that calculated the stress changes . &quot; These stress changes can advance an earthquake by several decades or even trigger one , &quot; he said . &quot; We do sense that these earthquakes over very long distances feel each other . We think because they interact and feel each other , they slow each other down or speed each other up. &quot; The group calculated that , as a result of the Jan . 17 quake , the geologic vise collapsing the region by about half an acre every year is today squeezing harder on faults under a wide area of the Los Angeles Basin : the San Fernando Valley , Thousand Oaks and Agoura Hills , Simi Valley , Glendale , and parts of Downtown and the Westside . The team also calculated that , as a consequence of the Northridge quake , pressure has eased slightly in Malibu , Topanga Canyon , along the northern part of Santa Monica Bay and through portions of the Santa Clarita Valley . &quot; We need to look_at those areas now that have faults whose stress has increased as a result of past earthquakes , &quot; said Thomas L . Henyey , a USC earthquake expert and director of the Southern California Earthquake Center . &quot; Those may be areas we may want to key on , but you are dealing with large patches of ground and many , many faults . You cannot say which of these faults will be affected. &quot; The team calculated the distribution of small pressure changes radiating from the epicenter of each major earthquake , revealing a distinctive pattern of higher stress levels that resembles the outline of a butterfly . When the researchers calculated the pattern for the 1971 Sylmar quake , they found that subsequent major earthquakes seemed to cluster in lobes of the butterfly &quot; wings. &quot; The pattern of increased stress in the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake also reveals the characteristic butterfly shape , and now some seismologists believe that they are detecting increased numbers of barely perceptible micro-quakes in the lobes of the wings . While Stein ' s study has taken a regional approach , a second group of USGS experts has been analyzing the changing stress on individual faults . Since Jan . 17 , they have identified half_a_dozen quakes with a magnitude greater than 5 that were triggered in locations &quot; where they would have been encouraged by the Northridge shock , &quot; said USGS geophysicist Robert W . Simpson . &quot; When you are looking_at the potential interaction of faults , the stresses are pretty small , &quot; Simpson said . &quot; We are accumulating a pile of evidence that is suggesting these small , static stress changes do make a difference. &quot; Stress Patterns The earthquake potential in some areas of metropolitan Los Angeles rose slightly as a consequence of the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake , according to a new analysis of how earthquakes affect each other . Some scientists believe that stresses from the 1971 Sylmar earthquake , for example , helped trigger the 1987 Whittier Narrows quake and the temblor in Northridge earlier this year .
