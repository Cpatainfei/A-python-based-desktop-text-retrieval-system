   <TEXT> An unmanned spacecraft named Clementine 1 , equipped with sensors built for missile defense , roared_off a launch_pad Tuesday on a seven-month journey to explore the moon and an asteroid . Scientific data collected when Clementine points its instruments at the moon next month and the asteroid Geographos next summer will be a byproduct of a $ 75-million-plus mission primarily intended to test new defense technology . The key instruments are five advanced sensors designed for detecting and tracking missiles , according to the Defense_Department ' s Ballistic Missile Defense Organization , which jointly sponsored the mission with NASA . A two-stage Titan 2G booster , a converted ballistic_missile , lifted Clementine off at 8:34 a.m. and sent it southwest over the Pacific . Contact with the spacecraft was achieved several hours later as planned . The mission is designed to test the detection capabilities of the sensors at realistic closing velocities , using the Earth , moon and Geographos as targets . A small rocket motor known as the Interstage Adapter System , launched with Clementine , also will be targeted by the sensors . Clementine will stay in Earth orbit for about seven days , then begin a looping trajectory to enter orbit around the moon_on Feb . 20 . That will be the first lunar exploration since the Apollo moon missions ended 21 years ago . The last , Apollo 17 , landed in December , 1972 . Clementine will spend two months in two orbit paths around the moon , mapping the entire surface in visible and near-infrared spectra . Laser-ranging and auto-navigation experiments also are planned . The spacecraft will then leave lunar orbit on a four-month trip to Geographos , passing within 75 miles of the asteroid on Aug . 31 . The mission is expected to end after seven months .</TEXT>
