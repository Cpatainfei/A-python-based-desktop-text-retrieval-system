   <HEADLINE> BATTLE AGAINST SAME-SEX HARASSMENT COMES OUT OF THE CLOSET ; LITIGATION : EXPERTS FIGURE THAT SUCH CASES MAKE_UP 5 % OF WORKPLACE COMPLAINTS . BUT THE PERCENTAGE COULD GROW AS GAYS BECOME MORE VOCAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> His twist on Hollywood ' s fabled casting couch mixes the cliche with the extraordinary . Wayne Mogilefsky , a USC film school graduate with dreams of writing a box-office hit , landed a foot-in-the-door job at Silver Pictures . The studio ' s president , Michael Levy , encouraged the starry-eyed young_man to submit an outline for a script -- and he eagerly did so . But then , according to Mogilefsky , Levy ' s interest in him emerged as more_than strictly professional . On Valentine ' s Day , 1992 , Levy asked Mogilefsky to spend the night in his hotel suite -- implying that the screenplay ' s success hinged_on the rendezvous , Mogilefsky claimed in a lawsuit against the studio . Afraid that his hope of a movie contract was about to crumble , Mogilefsky showed_up at the hotel , he said . When he refused Levy ' s sexual advances , Mogilefsky alleged , his boss spouted profanities at him . For his part , Levy acknowledged that he asked Mogilefsky to his room , said his attorney , Howard Weitzman . But the meeting was solely for business purposes , and he never pressured Mogilefsky for sex , Weitzman said . Eventually , Mogilefsky and the studio settled the suit out of court . But Mogilefsky is still so traumatized by the experience that he will not discuss it publicly , his attorney , James De Simone , said : &quot; He just wants to put it behind him. &quot; Levy also could not be reached for an interview . Although both men might just as soon forget the whole_thing , Mogilefsky ' s accusations have been inked in law books for all to see . Earlier this year , Mogilefsky ' s lawsuit landed in the California Supreme Court , which upheld the state ' s first written opinion calling same-sex harassment illegal . * The term &quot; sexual_harassment &quot; conjures_up images of a power-happy lecher making_passes at his female subordinate . Indeed , the vast majority of sexual_harassment complaints are by women against men -- with suits filed by men against women ranking a distant second . But employment attorneys calculate that about 5 % of harassment cases fall_into the same-sex category . And , they say , that proportion could grow as gays become increasingly vocal about their rights as employees . &quot; There is a new political awareness in the gay community that makes gays less willing to allow themselves to be victimized , &quot; said attorney and gay activist Mickey Wheatley . &quot; And , as gays come_to see the law as protecting their rights in_general , they will use the legal_system more and more to stop discriminatory conduct. &quot; Sexual harassment complaints across the board have soared over the past decade . During 1983 , 629 sexual_harassment suits were filed with the California Department of Fair Housing and Employment -- where virtually all sexual discrimination claims originate before reaching the courts . The number of complaints has climbed steadily every year since , more_than quadrupling by 1993 to 2 # 703 . &quot; Victims of sexual_harassment have become more confident that they are , in fact , victims , &quot; said Amelia Craig , staff attorney for the Los Angeles chapter of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund , a gay-rights organization . The Department of Fair Housing and Employment does not break_down sexual_harassment suits by gender . &quot; As long as the behavior constitutes sexual_harassment , it doesn ' t matter if it involves a male and a female or two males or two females , &quot; said the agency ' s deputy director , Wanda Kirby . Hundreds of same-sex harassment claimants have won monetary rewards in California due_to that widely held attitude . Yet until Mogilefsky ' s case traveled through the courts , the state did not have any precedent prohibiting same-gender harassment . Silver Pictures maintained that sexual_harassment laws were not intended to cover same-gender situations . &quot; As a feminist , I object to men taking_advantage of a law meant to give women equal footing at the workplace , &quot; said Bonnie Eskenazi , a Los Angeles entertainment attorney who represented Silver Pictures . Eskenazi said that sexual_harassment laws become blurred when applied to same-gender situations . &quot; A man can make a sexual joke to a group of other men without offending anyone , although the same comment could be offensive to a woman , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s a freedom_of_speech issue . Women say things to women and men say things to men that they would not feel comfortable saying in mixed company. &quot; Mogilefsky ' s lawsuit initially was dismissed by a Los Angeles Superior_Court judge , but an appellate_court overruled that decision in December 1993 . Silver Pictures settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount_of_money . However , the debate raged on . A Sacramento law_firm representing a consortium of employers asked the Supreme Court to &quot; de-publish &quot; the appellate_court ' s opinion so that it could not be cited in future cases . The ACLU Foundation of California argued that the decision should remain on record , and the Supreme Court unanimously agreed . &quot; All people are entitled to come_to work and do their job without being subjected_to the humiliation of sexual_harassment , &quot; said Carol Sobel , senior staff counsel for the ACLU . Two years ago , the Advocate -- a Los Angeles-based magazine for gays and lesbians -- briefly attempted a similar defense when slapped with a same-gender harassment suit by a former warehouse employee . Attorneys for the journal filed court papers contending that same-sex harassment was not covered by California laws . &quot; For the Advocate to take this position , sending a message to gays and lesbians that they are not safe from sexual_harassment , was the ultimate hypocrisy , &quot; said Wheatley , the plaintiff ' s attorney . In response to a barrage of criticism , the Advocate withdrew that controversial line_of_defense and issued a statement saying it &quot; would never want to harm the gay and lesbian community. &quot; The magazine settled the suit out of court last year . Same-gender sexual_harassment encompasses a number of situations : a gay_man harassing another gay_man or , though rarer , a lesbian harassing another lesbian ; a heterosexual taunting a homosexual ; a homosexual supervisor making advances toward a heterosexual subordinate . Regardless of the perpetrator ' s sexual orientation , harassment usually is driven by anger and insecurity as much as by attraction , said Laguna Beach psychologist Richard Ammon . &quot; It derives from a need to control and dominate , &quot; Ammon said . &quot; The only way that the harasser can feel good about himself is by feeling that he has power over somebody else. &quot; Sometimes , what starts_out as an innocent crush deteriorates into a self-perpetuated downward spiral , he added : &quot; If you are a supervisor and you express interest in a subordinate , for a split_second you have reversed the roles . If his or her answer is no , and you start using your position of power to coerce and manipulate , that ' s when harassment begins. &quot; Sexual harassment frequently goes unreported . A recent poll conducted by Lou Harris &amp; Associates showed that 60 % of interviewees who believe they have been harassed took no action . &quot; A woman might balk at reporting sexual_harassment because she faces the presumption that she brought it on herself -- she ' s a flirt , she dresses provocatively , &quot; said Carla Barboza , a Los Angeles attorney who specializes in sexual_harassment cases . &quot; A man , on the other hand , has trouble reporting sexual_harassment because he could look_like a wimp. &quot; For gays and lesbians , those preconceptions cut both ways . &quot; Gays are viewed first and foremost as sexual beings , &quot; Barboza said . &quot; So it ' s hard for some people to understand that gays don ' t welcome any and all sexual advances. &quot; An even bigger deterrent , though , can be the fear of divulging one ' s homosexuality at the office . In heterosexual-dominated corporate America , gay people labor under the weight of homophobia -- subtle and overt . &quot; The closet is a very powerful force for some people , &quot; Wheatley said . &quot; Someone trying to protect his sexual orientation may be hesitant to report same-sex sexual_harassment at his workplace for fear that people then will suspect him of being gay. &quot; Robert , who requested that his last_name not be used , said that he tolerated his supervisor ' s harassment for more_than a year -- until he was fired after requesting a transfer . &quot; I worried that I would be discriminated against if people knew I ' m gay , &quot; said the 32-year-old Laguna Beach resident , a professional restaurant manager . He recently filed suit against his former employer , Sizzler International Inc. of Los Angeles . A lawyer for the restaurant_chain declined to comment on pending litigation . The harassment started , Robert claims , with an occasional inappropriate compliment from his boss , such_as , &quot; You have a nice body. &quot; Then the passes became physical and relentless . &quot; He fondled me , asked questions about my personal life and kept insisting we go_out , &quot; Robert said . &quot; I felt nervous , threatened , violated . But I didn ' t quit because I needed the job. &quot; Further inhibiting them from complaining , gays often resist &quot; tattling on one of_their_own , &quot; said Ammon , who specializes in counseling gays and lesbians . &quot; We are a subculture that has been persecuted and discriminated against , so we try to protect each other. &quot; James Brown said he found the idea of reporting his boss ' sexual misconduct -- and , in the process , inadvertently &quot; outing &quot; a fellow gay_man -- so repugnant that he instead quit his job . &quot; I didn ' t want to portray gay people in a negative way , &quot; said the 28-year-old Santa Cruz resident . &quot; I felt that complaining about him would not be politically correct , that I shouldn ' t damage the career of another gay person. &quot; Brown claims in a lawsuit that he was harassed by Robert Hoffman , the founder of an Oakland psychological counseling center , while working there as an office manager three years ago . &quot; I started getting offers of promotions in exchange for being his lover , &quot; Brown said . &quot; It undermined my self-confidence ; I couldn ' t come_up with a solution other_than to leave my job for a lower-paying position. &quot; Brown filed suit a year later , in December of 1992 . &quot; I realized I didn ' t want other people to go_through what I went_through , &quot; he said . The suit is scheduled for trial early next year . Pamela Sayad , a San Francisco attorney representing Hoffman -- a divorced man with_children and grandchildren -- said &quot; there is absolutely no truth to the allegations. &quot; Unless there are witnesses , charges of sexual_harassment can come_down to one person ' s word against another ' s . Sharon , who requested that her last_name not be used , said she knows the trauma -- and long-term effects -- of being accused falsely of behavior she would never commit . A &quot; line producer &quot; who manages movie production budgets , she saw her reputation and career disintegrate beneath a heap of unchecked gossip . Four years ago , the Los Angeles resident was working_on a prized project when the executive producer called her into his office and dropped a bomb . The film ' s star , he said , had told crew_members that Sharon sexually harassed her . He then persuaded her not to risk disrupting the actress ' s performance with a confrontation . &quot; I couldn ' t imagine where she got this idea , &quot; said Sharon , a lesbian who was not out of the closet . &quot; One time I asked her if she needed a ride ; I can only guess that she thought I was making a pass and then embellished on the encounter . Yet I couldn ' t even talk to her about it and clear my name. &quot; Although her ordeal did not involve a lawsuit , it continues to haunt her . &quot; I suspect it has affected my references , &quot; Sharon said . &quot; I notice people are wary of me , and I don ' t have as_many opportunities to work as I once did. &quot; * Gay_men in mostly male workplaces such_as police_departments are particularly vulnerable to same-sex harassment when a heterosexual scorns a homosexual , said Lambda attorney Craig . &quot; It is motivated by a hatred of gays because they do not fit the stereotype of what ' real men ' are supposed to be , &quot; she said . One such case involves a former California Highway Patrol officer , who filed a lawsuit against the agency last year . Thomas Figenshu , a 10-year veteran of the CHP and one of its youngest sergeants , went_out on disability leave in 1992 after allegedly suffering verbal and physical abuse by his colleagues . His horror story includes accusations that officers in the CHP ' s West Los Angeles office referred to him as &quot; Sergeant Fag-in-shoe , &quot; stuffed threatening notes in his mail_slot , made crank_calls to his house and urinated in his wardrobe locker . Figenshu declined to be interviewed . His lawyer described him as &quot; emotionally distressed and tremendously disappointed. &quot; &quot; Tom was an outstanding , conscientious officer , &quot; said Los Angeles attorney Scott Silverman . &quot; He worked very hard to achieve his success and -- for no rational reason at all -- he has lost his career with the Highway Patrol. &quot; A deputy attorney_general representing the CHP said the agency denies Figenshu ' s allegations . Lambda attorney Craig said that California courts can expect to see more same-gender sexual_harassment suits now that the state Supreme Court has affirmed their validity . She advised employers to educate workers about all variations of sexual_harassment . &quot; Companies make the mistake of assuming that everyone is heterosexual , &quot; Craig said . &quot; If you start with the assumption that some people are gay and lesbian , you will do a lot of things differently. &quot;</TEXT>
