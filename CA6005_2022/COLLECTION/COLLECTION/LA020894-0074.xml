   <HEADLINE> GAINING A PEAK SUCCESS ; SKIER STREET COOLS HER TEMPER , HAS A SHOT AT THE GOLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Baby Girl &quot; wasn ' t breathing_in the crucial moments after her birth on April 3 , 1971 . She was baby blue . Later , this would glibly be recounted as her first temper tantrum , but the_matter then was deadly serious . The nearest doctor from the family home_in Triumph , Ida. , was 12 miles away in Sun Valley . With no time to spare , Roland Wayne ( Stubby ) Street pressed his mouth against his daughter ' s and blew into her lungs . The baby ' s chest swelled and soon she turned a healthy pink . Street describes this as the moment she &quot; kicked_in and fired up. &quot; Stubby then flipped her over , held her feet with one hand and swatted her behind with the other . The girl didn ' t so_much as yelp . Instead , the story goes , she looked_up and smiled . &quot; I swear to God she was laughing_at me that day , &quot; her mother , Dee , recalls . No one could have imagined that nearly 23 years later , Picabo Street would be a contender for an Olympic medal in downhill skiing . But everyone knew the Street_girl was a spitfire right out of the gate . In her short but eventful life , she has bemused and bedeviled those closest to her -- family , friends and , to be sure , U.S. Ski Team coaches . In the summer of 1990 , Street was kicked_off the U.S team briefly for disciplinary reasons . But no one stays mad at Picabo for long . In between tantrums -- some of her best have been in ski-race finish areas -- Street is a mile-a-minute , straight-shooting talker and skier of some repute . After years of work_at U.S. Ski Team charm school , the pieces finally came_together last year as Street earned a silver medal in the combined at the World Alpine Ski Championships in Morioka , Japan . But nothing would come easy for the girl named Picabo . Some girls grew_up singing . Picabo -- pronounced &quot; Peek-a-boo &quot; -- grew_up swinging . Street ' s parents , hippies who ran_off to Idaho together in July of 1967 , decided to let their children name themselves . Two years before &quot; Baby Girl &quot; was born , &quot; Baby Boy &quot; entered the world . He would be known as &quot; Baby Boy &quot; or &quot; Baba &quot; for five years until another Big Brother -- the federal_government -- came calling . In 1974 , when the Streets applied for documents before a planned trip to Mexico , the government demanded that the parents give proper_names to the children . So , Baby Boy became Roland Wayne III . But no one has ever called him Roland ; it ' s Baba , Bubbers , Bubs or Bobs . Baby Girl ? She became Picabo . On the trailer trek to Triumph years before , the Streets had passed_through a dot on the map called Picabo , Ida. , and the name stuck_in their heads . Dee says picabo is the Nez Perce Indian word meaning &quot; shining waters. &quot; It is a strange name , but this is a different girl . There would be , as you might expect , the requisite playground fights at Hemingway Elementary School nearby Ketchum , named for the author who once lived there . Picabo heard it all . &quot; Peek-a-boo , I see you ! &quot; was standard fare , she recalls . Or , &quot; What ' s your brother ' s name ? Hide_and_Go_Seek ? &quot; But she never backed_down . Her parents told her she could change her name at any time , but she refused . &quot; I started coming_up with stuff like , ' Well , at least my name ' s not Jim , like everyone else in the world , ' &quot; she says . &quot; It started to sink_in that it was pretty cool my name isn ' t like that . I kind of enjoyed it . It made me stand away and out from the rest. &quot; Family and friends have always called her &quot; Peek &quot; for short . Those brave enough to pick a fight with her usually got their chance . In fifth grade , while she was chasing a girl around campus after an altercation , Picabo slipped_on a patch of ice and chipped her front_tooth on a curb . &quot; You could ' ve opened a beer_can with that tooth , &quot; her mother still says proudly . The Streets had a barter deal with the local dentist , though , and their daughter got the tooth capped . &quot; We built him a fireplace and he fixed our teeth , &quot; Dee Street says . Triumph had been a thriving mining community until the North_Star Mine closed_in 1953 . But by the time the Streets hit town , there wasn ' t much town at all . Of the eight kids who ruled Triumph , population 13 or so at the time , Picabo was the only female . Yet , in the neighborhood , she was always just one of the boys . &quot; Once , I got hit in the forehead and knocked_out with a baseball , &quot; Picabo recalls , &quot; and they just said , ' Ah , c ' mon , ' and kicked me around and got me back_up . So I just had to hack it and be tough . I think that ' s what made me as tough as I was , growing_up in that atmosphere and having the name that I did. &quot; At 4 , Picabo demanded a chance to ride her brother ' s bike , which had no training wheels , seat or brakes . Tired of her pestering , Baba put Picabo on board and pushed her down the street . She didn ' t stop until she bounced off a fence . At neighborhood birthday_parties , Picabo would sometimes pull_out the boxing gloves and &quot; whip the crap out of everybody , &quot; her mother remembers . Discipline was a problem . The prospect of a spanking usually drew a hearty laugh from Picabo , so her parents had to get creative . &quot; Unpredictable , &quot; is how her mother puts it . The one thing Picabo couldn ' t do was sit still . So , for punishment , Stubby would make Picabo place her nose on a designated spot on the wall barely high enough to make her crane her neck . She would be ordered not to move for minutes at a time . It was very effective . This sort of punishment pained the Streets , who had fled the establishment and its rules and regulations . INCENSE AND PEPPERMINTS Dee Meyer met Stubby Street in Reno in 1966 . Meyer was attending college , while Street was a gourmet chef and the son of a Nevada banker . Stubby ' s childhood was strictly regimented , one reason he later joined the Marines , but he apparently had no desire to live a white-collar life in the shadow of his family . So , on July 4 , 1967 , Street hitched a trailer to his Dodge van and took_off with Dee . For two months , they rented a trailer space and camped in Grass Valley , where the couple made extra money by painting fences . Stubby grew out his beard . Dee wanted a head with hair . Long , beautiful hair . Shining , gleaming , streaming , flaxen , waxen . Eight years later , Dee ' s mane extended below her knees . You could braid it and jump_rope . Dee played guitar and sang folk anthems . She still gives lessons . She once performed at a peace march in Reno and claims she can sing Joan Baez , &quot; backward , blindfolded and with my hands tied. &quot; The Streets were , well , far out . &quot; We weren ' t stoned out all_the time , &quot; Dee says . &quot; We weren ' t on acid all_the time . But we were kind of anti-establishment . We rebelled against the 8 to 5 , working for someone else. &quot; While in Grass Valley , Stubby heard that there were jobs available at the Sun Valley ski resort in Idaho . He was , by trade , a ski bum and gourmet cook . It took about 10 minutes to hitch the trailer . Idaho was everything they imagined . Where else could you rent a house for $ 50 a month from a landlord such_as theirs , Ernie Haar , whom Dee suspected had been chased out of South_Dakota because he said he had made contact with UFOs ? &quot; I learned to cook on a wood stove , &quot; Picabo recalls fondly . &quot; We ' d go_up to the high country to camp and fish . We had horses . We ate really good food , rice and beans , powdered_milk , just really healthy. &quot; The Streets ate every meal at_home . Picabo says she watched TV only about five times as a child . &quot; I spent all my time with my family , &quot; she says . &quot; I never had a baby-sitter . My parents never left us . . . The best thing about my parents , they were really open-minded and they let us do a lot of things we wanted to do . They let us go_out and experiment and were there to pick us up if we fell on our butt. &quot; THE AGE OF NEFARIOUS Picabo Street and the Sun Valley ski resort were an accident and a ski champion waiting to happen . Of course , there was no stopping her . She started skiing at 5 . She cried all_the way up the chairlift the first time , thinking she would fall , but once she exited , Picabo made a bee-line to the bottom . She called it survival of the fittest . &quot; I just started chasing my brother and my dad around the mountain , &quot; she says . &quot; I had to keep_up or get left_behind . It was like , ' If you can ' t keep_up , meet us at the car at 4. ' &quot; Picabo kept_up . It soon became clear she was something special . Picabo joined the Sun Valley ski team . &quot; The day she left the Sun Valley ski team was the day we drove_around the corner and she was lying on the snow at the finish_line , kicking and screaming because she wasn ' t beating everyone , &quot; Dee Street says . Picabo was 11 . It was Dee ' s mission to keep her daughter from becoming &quot; a brat and a prima donna. &quot; Unlike the majority of ski families , the Street ' s didn ' t have much money . Yet when Picabo was 13 , the family moved to Salt_Lake_City so she could enter the prestigious Rowmark Ski Academy . The experience was a disaster , and the Streets were back in Idaho within the year . For one , Picabo didn ' t care much for schoolwork . As she puts it , &quot; I didn ' t want to get honors and go_to Stanford . I wanted to learn what I could and get out. &quot; Picabo ' s ski career quickly took_off . In 1988 , she won the U.S. Junior downhill and super-G championships . Pure talent brought her only that far . After suffering a knee injury in 1989 , she came_to dry-land training camp at Park City , Utah , in the summer of ' 90 out of shape and out of sorts . Paul Major , then the U.S. women ' s coach , took one look_at Street and sent her home with the admonition to get her act together . Street : &quot; They flat-out said , ' Your attitude stinks and you need to go_home and figure_out whether you want to do this or not . So , I went_home and wrote_out the pros and cons of skiing or not skiing , and the pros outweighed the cons by a lot. &quot; Street returned , but it wasn ' t an open-and-shut case . &quot; It never just turned_around completely , &quot; Major says . &quot; I think it ' s turned_around now because she ' s had some success . She understands it ' s going_to take a lot of work to stay_up there. &quot; Major , who now has the dual role as women ' s coach and Alpine director , and Street have had their share of run-ins . &quot; There are 1 # 000 stories , &quot; Major says . &quot; Some of them you can ' t repeat. &quot; Street says she has worked hard to control her temper but still has a problem with authority figures . &quot; I think they realized they had to approach it a little bit differently with me , too , &quot; she says . &quot; They just couldn ' t wag their finger at me any more . that ' s not something I ' m partial to at all. &quot; Street and the coaches tried to find some common_ground . Her temper was still an issue . Last year , desperate to retrieve a duffel_bag buried beneath a mound of others in the team van , Street grabbed the straps of her bag , put both feet against the bumper and yanked the bag out while falling_flat on her backside . Major says she was lucky she didn ' t break her back . &quot; I don ' t have control over it , &quot; she says of her emotions . &quot; I used to let it fly a lot worse . I used to freak_out whenever I didn ' t ski as well as I wanted to . I didn ' t care who was around watching . I ' d just throw my stuff around , throw a little temper tantrum . I ' ve learned you can ' t do that . It ' s very distasteful . . . So I go_around the corner and do_it . It ' s not that I ' ve stopped doing_it , I just don ' t do_it in_the_public_eye anymore. &quot; At least not as often . &quot; There was a girl on the team , and we were playing broom hockey , and she kept hitting me with her stick , and it ( teed ) me off and I wound_up to punch her . I was about to punch her out , and I stopped myself and said , ' Wow , you can ' t do that. ' &quot; With Street , control is a 12-step program . &quot; I really like her because of her energy , &quot; Major says . &quot; I like her because she ' s a genuine person . She ' s extremely extroverted . She just loves to tell you what ' s on her mind . There ' s nothing contrived about her . She may_not have all_the social graces to go_with it , but that ' s fun . You ' re really seeing a person. &quot; Street hopes to have it all working for her in the Winter_Olympics starting Saturday . She wants to throw her best tantrum as she ' s screaming down the mountain . &quot; I ' ve got a lot of fire in me , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s good , but it ' s taken me four or five years to channel it in the right direction . I ' ve got_to get_it going , get_it working for me , not against me. &quot; Her parents will be course-side when Street descends the Olympic downhill course at Kvitfjell on Feb . 19 . Until she learned how to ski herself , Dee couldn ' t bare to watch Picabo race . The reality of that danger hit_home on Jan . 29 when Austria ' s Ulrike Maier was killed in a downhill race at Garmisch-Partenkirchen , Germany . Picabo had completed her run and was leading the race when the accident occurred . Street ended_up a respectable seventh . There was no celebration . Back in Idaho , a flower-child-turned-mother grew more anxious . &quot; I ' m somehow under the impression that it ' s never going_to get better , &quot; Dee Street says of the worrying . &quot; As a mother , I think I ' m always going_to go_through this. &quot;</TEXT>
