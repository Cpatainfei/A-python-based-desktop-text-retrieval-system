   <HEADLINE> EUROPEAN SUMMIT OF UNCERTAINTY ; NATO : AN ALLIANCE IN SEARCH OF A RELATIONSHIP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia has a historical fear of encirclement . Eastern Europe has a historical fear of absorption . Which of these fears , if either , should guide the United States as NATO debates whether to enlarge its membership ? In power-political terms , NATO , an alliance formed to deter Soviet aggression , would seem to be made only the stronger by the addition of new allies lying so near to Russia itself . The Eastern European_nations themselves are eager for NATO membership . Lithuania has already requested it . The opportunity to enlarge NATO , moreover , may be fading . Last August Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin said that he would not object to NATO membership for Poland or the Czech Republic . In October , having foiled a coup attempt in Moscow , he cautioned Western European leaders against expanding NATO . Wednesday , tilting toward the electorally resurgent Russian right_wing , he denounced Lithuania ' s NATO bid in the Cold_War language of veiled threat . Against the arguments of power_politics , however , stand those of psycho-politics . If expanding NATO to bring it to the Russian border would strengthen the psychological appeal of right-wing extremists like Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , then NATO should not be expanded . Russians like Zhirinovsky , yes , must be treated as the enemy , but Russia as_a_whole must_not be so treated lest the prophecy become self-fulfilling . Neither of these two courses is without risk , and it is unsettling that so basic a matter of U.S. foreign_policy seems to have been postponed to the very eve of next week ' s NATO summit . That said , the Clinton_Administration has wisely recognized that time is , to a point , on NATO ' s side . If the second policy is adopted and fails , there will still be time to shift to the first policy , for Russia is economically incapable of rapid rearmament . The Partnership for Peace that NATO will adopt is thus , by design , an ambiguous policy . It begins an association between NATO and Eastern Europe that can mature into either a collective_security policy including Russia or a defensive alliance against Russia . Events will determine which option prevails . Among NATO ' s achievements is that it has kept its members from going_to_war with one another . An expanded NATO may eventually have that effect in an enlarged sphere . Without Russian backing , NATO has defaulted in the Balkans . With Russia in the fold , a NATO changed from a conventional military alliance to a continental police_force may be able to do_better in comparable crises that surely lie ahead . The moment , in short , is one of confusion and danger -- as the resignation Thursday of yet other veteran U.S. State_Department official over President Clinton ' s Bosnia policy suggests -- but also one of considerable gravity and opportunity .</TEXT>
