   <HEADLINE> EVENING THE BALKANS ODDS ; LIFTING THE EMBARGO MIGHT WELL SAVE LIVES BY DETERRING SERBIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Balkans war is being waged by the Balkan peoples themselves . But as in centuries past , the conflict there is deeply affected by factors far outside the Balkans . The European Union ( formerly the European Community ) , the United States and Russia surely have , among them , the power to impose peace in this region . But their interests are just divergent enough to foil the necessary unanimity . Among these differences , none is greater than that regarding the blanket arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia . The United States believes that ending this embargo for Bosnia-Herzegovina would permit that embattled state to defend itself against Serb aggression . The European Union takes the view that Bosnian self-defense cannot defeat the Serbs but could spread the violence and prolong the conflict . The Europeans have been willing to countenance a Serbian conquest if peace can be had at no lower price . The Americans have been willing to countenance a dragging on of the conflict if the principle that borders may_not be revised by force can be defended at no lower price . But the argument against spreading the violence has been weakened lately by a shaky but continuing peace established between the Muslims and the Croats . The opinion is being voiced with new cogency -- in Europe as well as the United States -- that lifting the arms embargo on Croatia and Bosnia might deter rather than spread violence . Serbia is exhausted . Its venture in mini-imperialism has left it bogged down in a Vietnam-like quagmire . If Serbia can expect the peoples it has sought to conquer to be armed from abroad , it may discover a new willingness to negotiate , a new skepticism about whether any of its gains will be lasting . Whether changing the embargo will have this effect cannot be known with certainty . But what can be known with near-certainty is that in its present form the embargo has been a major incentive to violence by the better-armed Serbian side . Evening the odds may save more lives than it costs .</TEXT>
