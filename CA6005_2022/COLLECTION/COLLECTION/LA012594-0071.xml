   <TEXT> For some , last week ' s San Fernando Valley earthquake reminded them that they too are vulnerable . Others saw in the aftermath cause to feel superior . For still others , it was a chance to muse about humankind ' s relationship with nature . A look_at world press reaction to the quake : * &quot; In California , major earthquakes are assumed by a well-prepared population that makes planning for disaster both a public and a personal priority . Here , most of us live_in dreamland . We don ' t really believe that any of this will happen to us , although the geological record says it can and science suggests a high degree of probability for a shock up_to a_hundred times more powerful ( than the one which shook the San Fernando Valley ) . &quot; -- Stephen Hume in the Vancouver Sun , Vancouver * &quot; The nightmare seems to continue for this state that represented America ' s El Dorado . . . the dream , a magic blending of strass ( paste jewelry ) , sun and Pacific sea_spray , has turned_into a nightmare . . . . Social and economic costs come_on top of an emotional cost , generated by repeated catastrophes , that cannot be overlooked . Since 1993 , more_than three hundred_thousand people have left California , and the economic recession , linked to the severe blows dealt by fate , has generated a loss of eight hundred_thousand jobs in what used to be a Golden State. &quot; -- Le Soir , Brussels * &quot; Of course , we are far from comparing ourselves with the U.S. But . . . all critical moments have so far indicated that the Egyptian people are of a noble origin . No robberies , rape or murder occurred in the days following the ( devastating Oct . 12 , 1992 Egyptian ) earthquake . &quot; This was exactly the case also a_few years ago when darkness prevailed all_over the nation due_to a technological failure in the power supply . All Egyptians stood then as an epitome of magnanimity. &quot; -- Columnist Samir Ragab in Egyptian Gazette , Cairo * &quot; Now we ' re going to go_back to Israel for_sure . . . In Israel , in spite of all_the craziness , there ' s nothing like this . There are wars , but you ' re in control . After this earthquake everyone ' s waiting for the ' Big One. ' When the Scuds fell on Israel ( during the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War ) it wasn ' t fate -- someone gave an order and launched them . Here , it ' s the elements . It all just falls on you. &quot; -- Shahar Yehoshua , of Santa Monica , quoted in Yediot Aharonot , Tel Aviv * &quot; When they saw the waves of big fire in a dark sky and the wrecked highways in Los Angeles , many Japanese must have felt apprehensive about possible earthquakes that might happen in Japan . . . . &quot; Japan looks more prepared for earthquakes than the United States , but only in figures and estimates . Machines and systems always are subject_to accidents , troubles and defects . In reality , we have to be prepared to deal with harsh conditions . . . such_as troubles with telephones and electric lines that struck Los Angeles this time . . . . &quot; -- Asahi Shimbun , Tokyo * &quot; Independent of its legal condition or status , the Salvadoran population that suffered material damage caused by the earthquake in Los Angeles will have a right to U.S. federal aid . . . . The official information that has been obtained directly from U.S. authorities indicates that every Salvadoran resident of Los Angeles , be he a citizen , a legal resident or any other status , who has been a victim of the natural_phenomenon is eligible for humanitarian aid . Authorities of the Clinton_Administration have explained that the information used in the aid programs cannot be used by Immigration . . . . &quot; -- La Prensa Grafica , San Salvador * &quot; A once beautiful , blooming small city has grown_over the years into a nightmarish place owing to developing a region beyond its natural capacity . Although civil_engineers can bring_in water , gas and electricity from vast distances , there ' s a price to be paid which may be too high , both materially and in terms of human well-being . &quot; We hear a lot about underdeveloped areas ' problems , but are they worse than those of overdeveloped ones ? Take your pick , as it seems that no matter what we humans do , there are always unwanted side_effects . The question of how much development is enough is one that needs answering . Do we humans ever reach the point where we have enough of anything ? &quot; -- Egyptian Gazette , Cairo * &quot; The City of Angels is in a fatal location , as if willing its own destruction . So , for that matter , is Tokyo , the world ' s largest agglomeration . . . . &quot; The destruction of an ultra-modern city such_as Tokyo or Los Angeles may prompt a rethink of urban life in the 21st Century . . . . Devastation will raise the question of why humans set themselves so suicidally against nature ' s dictates . On 9 January 1857 , a large earthquake gave the village of Los Angeles an indication that it was poorly founded . Tokyo has been reminded of its faults roughly every 70 years . Yet still these cities have grown . Perhaps the human lifespan is simply too short and the Big One too infrequent to persuade people to live wisely rather than dangerously. &quot; -- The Independent , London</TEXT>
