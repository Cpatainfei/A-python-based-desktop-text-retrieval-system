   <TEXT> As of late Wednesday Israeli security_forces had been able to find and arrest only one of the five Jewish extremists Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin has ordered taken into preventive detention . Meanwhile , Rabin announced that the movements of 18 other extremist settlers would be restricted in the aftermath of last week ' s massacre of Palestinians at a mosque in Hebron by an Israeli fanatic . There ' s no doubt that the revulsion , shame and concern expressed by Rabin ' s government and most Israelis over that atrocity are genuine and deep . The fact remains that the government has yet to take measures appropriate to the basic threat raised by a militant Israeli minority , not just against the safety of Palestinians but against the government ' s own peace policy . A U.S. State_Department official told a congressional hearing this week that there are &quot; several thousand &quot; militant settlers Israel should be worrying about , not just the few dozen who have been targeted so far . The peace process probably will survive the horror of last week ' s killings , because in the final analysis responsible Israeli and Palestinian leaders know that to let it collapse would surely be to doom their two peoples to further years , even decades , of costly and futile conflict . Whether popular_opinion would allow leaders to pursue peace should there be anything like a repetition of the Hebron blood bath , directed against either side , is another matter . It ' s no secret that the most militant among Israel ' s 120 # 000 settlers -- like the most militant in the Palestinian camp -- are eager to wreck the peace process . The Rabin government is courting grief if it doesn ' t move quickly to neutralize this sedition . At the same time the Palestine Liberation Organization , if it ' s as serious about wanting peace as Chairman Yasser Arafat assured Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher it is , must stop using the Hebron tragedy as a basis for raising wholly unrealistic political demands . Rabin is not about to move the issue of the settlements to the forefront of negotiations -- that , under the agreed timetable , is still several years away -- nor is he going_to disarm all_the settlers , as the PLO insists . But Rabin can do a lot more to deal effectively with security on the West_Bank just as Arafat , by taking greater_care with his public comments , can do a lot more to assure the survival of the peace process .</TEXT>
