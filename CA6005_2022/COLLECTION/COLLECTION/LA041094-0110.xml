   <HEADLINE> THAT PAROCHIAL EASTERN TILT OF CLINTON ' S ' NATIONAL ' COUNCIL ON THE ARTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The National Council on the Arts , the presidentially appointed body that oversees the National Endowment for the Arts , has long been composed of a majority of members who reside along the Eastern seaboard , from New England through New York to Washington . On Mar . 25 , it was shifted even further in that parochial direction . Before President Bill_Clinton finally nominated eight prominent Americans to fill long-standing council vacancies -- nominations almost certain to be confirmed by the Senate -- 13 of the 25 available slots were held by citizens from the East . Now , it ' s 17 . The problem with the ratio is far more_than the lack of geographic diversity in a government body that claims national standing . Other criteria are also legitimate . Areas with a higher density of exceptional artists and outstanding arts organizations should have greater representation than others . Drawing heavily on a seat of abundant merit for talented nominees makes_sense , since the council shapes arts policy to foster excellence . What riles is that the East , especially New York , is not the only area of the country that qualifies . The emphasis in Clinton ' s current council picks is obsolete . I ' m talking_about the pitiful level of arts representation from California -- specifically Los Angeles . By far the biggest , most diverse city in the most populous state in the union , Los Angeles wasn ' t just pivotal to Clinton ' s election . In the 1980s , its expansive arts scene joined the rarefied ranks of internationally significant artistic milieus -- the only U.S. city other_than New York that can make that claim . National Council membership does not yet reflect that stunning development . A single Angeleno sits on the panel . that ' s the same number as from Boise , Ida . The term of University of California , Los Angeles ethnomusicologist Robert Garfias actually expired in 1992 . He ' s one of nine sitting members whose terms were extended , many of them when President George_Bush was keeping a low profile during the political brush_fire that engulfed the NEA late in his tenure . Two other distinguished Californians also sit on the panel : Peter deCourcy Hero , a foundation administrator from San Jose , and Catherine Yi-Yu Cho Woo , director of the China Studies Institute at San Diego University . This November , the terms of Garfias , Hero and Woo end . Three of Clinton ' s nominees are from New York City ; one each hails from Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , West_Virginia and Washington . Sole exception to the Right Coast tilt is Colleen Jennings-Roggensack , president of the Assn . of Performing Arts Presenters and head of public events at Arizona State University . Eyebrows rise skyward when you realize that , once confirmed , a total of eight council_members will hail from New York . that ' s one-third of a board that acts_on behalf of the nation -- a percentage unchanged from the Bush_Administration . In November , due_to staggered terms , seven seats on the National Council will open_up . The current gross imbalance of its membership could change dramatically by the end of the year -- for the better . A significant number of California artists , patrons , historians or administrators must be nominated . In fact , several from Los Angeles should get the nod . Culturally , Los Angeles is worlds apart from the traditions of older , more European-oriented American cities . The model for a suburban rather than urban social matrix ; the crossroads for Asia , Latin_America and the United States ; the global capital of pop-culture -- any number of defining distinctions are obvious . Los Angeles ' artistic coming of_age in the 1980s has made its cultural life a widely recognized touchstone for America today -- one that the National Council on the Arts ought to reflect and benefit from . NEA Chair Jane Alexander , a prominent actress and the first working artist to head the agency , has strong ties to the L.A. community . Still , the chairman reports to the council , and the council ' s composition says something about federal understanding of the state_of_the_arts today , and of their critical relationship to the diversity of American life . The current nominations , regardless of the qualifications of individual nominees , say that only New York and its equally Old_World vicinity matter -- as if important Eastern artists and arts institutions are singular standard-bearers that should be followed with conformity by a homogenized American culture . The nominees look less appropriate for a 1994 National Council on the Arts than for a 13 Original Colonies Plus-a-Few Council on the Arts . Clinton can be expected to have put his defining stamp on the National Council by the end of the year , since by then he will have named 15 of its 25 members . Here ' s one certainty : Because terms are staggered , at least six will reside in New York . A worst-case scenario , which is unlikely , is that none will be from Los Angeles . The next worse , entirely possible , is that Los Angeles will again claim only token representation . If so , the serious artistic life of the nation will be the poorer for it .</TEXT>
