   <HEADLINE> IN CELEBRATION OF RESTAURANTS PAST ; RESTAURAN HISTORY ; THE WAY WE ATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> My editor , who is 30-something , asked me to do a memory-lane piece on restaurants that were popular a long_time ago . . . 20 , 30 years . &quot; Hey , wait a minute , kid , &quot; I told her . &quot; I may be 60-something , but I ' m really 17 at heart . I go_to the Tail of the Pup , I watch MTV and listen to the Grateful Dead all_the time . I ' d really have to stretch my memory to remember places I haven ' t been to for the last 30 years. &quot; &quot; Try , &quot; she said and went_off , her short , short skirt flinging as she turned . But whom was I kidding ? A brief reminiscence turned_up more closed restaurants than I care to recall . Perino ' s , Scandia , the Windsor , the Brown Derby whooshed up first . The scrambled regression of places slipped further and further back , like a time_machine gone amok . * Then everything stopped . Oh , my God ! It ' s 1960 at Romanoff ' s . And there is Mike Romanoff serving strawberries Romanoff the way they should be , sprinkled with brown_sugar . And there ' s Au Petit Jean and La Rue . I almost forgot them . They were little French gems , precursors of Le Restaurant and Le St . Germain , that helped mold the cultural character of the city at a time when food -- French or otherwise -- was no big deal . Who knew from French in those days ? Escargots defined French cuisine in Los Angeles in the ' 50s . And Robaire ' s , longer-lived than any other French restaurant , served a cassoulet that we then thought was a half a minute from Paris . Maison Gerard , another ' 50s and ' 60s hangout of the stars , introduced us to our first onion soup -- which might have been authentic , but who could be sure ? It was the Coppertone look of Scandia I remember most . Day or night , a California squint was necessary to see past the deep , dark , coppery glow from all that expensive copper hammered on the bar where they kept the all-you-can-eat-but-didn ' t-dare Swedish_meatballs . The glow came from everywhere -- the burnished wood-paneled walls covered with copper utensils and even the rich burgundy leather chairs with oversized backs and wings as large as elephant_ears , where romance , serious business and monkey business were safe from stray eyes and ears . * I also remember the hostess sending my husband off to the cloak room , like a naughty boy used to be sent to the principal ' s office , to be fitted with an oversized blue blazer and a crumpled tie when his ' 70s Nehru jacket was deemed unsuitable for Scandia ' s respectable rooms . Fashion slights were accepted meekly in those days . Who would stand_for that stuff today ? The imperious hostess ( Judith Anderson in the movie &quot; Rebecca &quot; flashes to mind ) would lead us in a funereal procession to our plush , overstuffed banquettes and slap huge blue menus with dangling gold tassels on the table as if she were issuing court summonses . No hello . No goodby . &quot; Dinner for two this way , please. &quot; Never did host or hostess utter my name in 20 years of regular dining at Scandia . Still , I loved it . There were the three-ring_circus acts by waiters performing a service known as &quot; table-side &quot; cooking , an art lost and buried along with the great Continental restaurants of America ' s past . Flames from chafing dishes shot_up , sending wafts of smoking shish_kebab perfumed with Cognac into the air . Caesar_salads made with real eggs were tossed with the flair of a ballerina ' s Swan Lake arms . Slicing steak Diane was a sleight-of-hand magic act . First you see the steak in the pan , then find it ribboned on your plate . No beat . No restaurant since Scandia has served gravad lax with droplings of curled , crisply fried salmon skin and a sweet dill sauce . The chicken Kon-Tiki , a curried chicken_salad , not only was a lunch favorite ( eaten with salt sticks ) but ended_up in the hall_of_fame of most-requested recipes of The Times ' Culinary SOS readers . * Though I was no fan of fish , the pickled herring was so fresh I could almost smell the North_Sea . We often stopped at Scandia after the theater or movie for late supper , which started at 10 p.m. sharp and not a moment sooner . Danish open-faced sandwiches were miniature works_of_art , decorated with spirals of lemon_peel , sprigs of dill , swirls of sour_cream and a sprinkling of caviar . The steak saute with potatoes , prepared table-side , inspired me to duplicate the dish at_home , and it ' s something I serve to this day . Lingonberry pudding , served in huge stemware bowls with lingonberry sauce sinking deep into clouds of whipped cream , is now a fragment of a recurring dream . Perino ' s , tucked_away on the fringes of Hancock Park , was Los Angeles ' first and foremost icon of culinary excellence in the ' 50s and ' 60s . Where else would you get pumpernickel cheese toast served by a waiter wearing white gloves ? Or where today do you have to beg for the check , as we often had to at Perino ' s , before the captain deigned to present it ? The Windsor was a far more relaxed Continental copycat . Suave but not overbearing ; stuffy but friendly . And those crepes Suzette , performed at table-side , were divine . * I never knew the owners of those famed Continental restaurants , but their presence was always felt . My memory of Scandia ' s Kenneth Hansen is of a handsome , square-faced Dane with piercing blue eyes -- and a temper that supposedly terrorized the kitchen staff as he scrutinized each and every dish for a stray droplet of sauce , an ill-placed chive blade or whatever it was that would make him send the plate back . It was his strong presence , I would guess , that saved Scandia from extinction long after it was outclassed by the new_wave of Continental restaurants -- Le St . Germain , Le Restaurant , L ' Ermitage , L ' Orangerie , Bernard ' s , Ma Maison and others . It was these restaurants that brought_to Los Angeles French cooking that we thought was better than you would get_in France . By the late ' 70s , Los Angeles was finally serious about its food . Thankfully , L ' Orangerie is still around , for anyone old enough to remember the difference . But even these wonderful new French restaurants eventually became arbitrary victims of fashion in a fickle age when everything , including restaurants , became subject_to cancellation without notice . * A jumble of dishes of those golden days of Los Angeles ' culinary revolution in the ' 70s and ' 80s flashes before my eyes : Ma Maison ' s ravioli stuffed with duck ( when Wolfgang Puck was doing the cooking ) ; Bernard ' s chilled avocado soup in an avocado shell ; Roland Gibert ' s wonderful whole cabbage stuffed with a farcie of mushrooms and wrapped in caul fat , also at Bernard ' s . ( I remember Bernard Jacoupy , who now operates Lunaria in West Los Angeles , saying to Gibert , who is from Central France ' s cabbage-producing center : &quot; Cabbage , cabbage , cabbage . We are turning_into cabbages. &quot; ) And there was Michel Blanchet at L ' Ermitage masterfully creating a minimalist picture-perfect Jardin des Tuileries dead-center on the plate with Dover sole and a_few cut vegetables . Long before these new-wave restaurants arrived in Los Angeles , there was a group of American restaurants that identified the city ' s carefree spirit more_than any other kind of place , living or dead . They were a class of restaurant that I would love to see again , but , of course , never will . I had just arrived from New York City and was invited to the Brown Derby near the Ambassador Hotel . There , occupying a good portion of a city_block , was a brown derby hat about three stories high and 90 feet wide . I laughed hysterically . I was home at last -- Alice ' s Wonderland . * I ran home and got the kids . They ordered the Shirley Temples and the Cobb salad -- now household names in American cuisine , they were both invented by owner Bob Cobb . The Bantam Cock and Tail O ' the Cock , a_couple_of zany architectural twins , sporting sweeping overhangs and tall signs of roosters clucking over busy Los Angeles boulevards , were great places to unload the week ' s psychological aches and pains with a good gin_and_tonic , shrimp_cocktail and a terrific steak . As for steaks , Ollie Hammond ' s on La Cienega was matchless for its comforting choo-choo-train coziness , friendly waiters and steak done to your pleasure , with a wood marker indicating &quot; rare , &quot; &quot; medium &quot; or &quot; well done. &quot; Steak sandwiches , like the chewy ones once served at the recently deceased Nickodell ' s on Melrose , had the Los Angeles stamp of approval for how a steak should be served -- on a piece of toasted French_bread soaked with steak juice , over or under a fried onion . You can order the same type of sandwich today at Musso and Frank Grill on Hollywood Boulevard , the place that probably invented the sandwich and still is going strong as Los Angeles ' oldest family restaurant . * At Nickodell ' s the steak was not prime , but who cared , as long as it could be eaten_in the dim light of the smoky lounge where Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellman fought and made_up ? Or was it Carol and Bob , or Desi and Lucy ? Whatever . Then there were the South_Seas restaurants that vanished without a trace . What happened to Don the Beachcomber ? Or the Luau , known for its terrific tropical drinks and boula boula , the soup that is part pea_soup and part turtle_soup ? Which reminds me : Whatever happened to Frascati ? The scampi there was terrific . Ah , well . Nothing is forever . * The Luau , which looked_like a ship-wrecked sailing_ship in the center of Beverly Hills , served Boula Boula in small bowls . LUAU ' S BOULA BOULA 3 ( 10-ounce ) cans pea_soup or 2 cans pea_soup and 1 ( 10-ounce ) can green_turtle_soup Freshly ground pepper 6 tablespoons Sherry 6 tablespoons unsweetened whipped cream , lightly salted Grated Parmesan cheese Paprika Minced chervil , optional Combine pea_soup and turtle_soup , if using , in saucepan and bring_to boil .
