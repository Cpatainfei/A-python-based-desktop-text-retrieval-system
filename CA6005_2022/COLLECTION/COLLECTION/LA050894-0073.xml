   <HEADLINE> TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / JUDY ROSENER : CORPORATE SURVIVAL DEMANDS FULL USE OF A DIVERSE WORK_FORCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Across the country , organizations are restructuring , re-engineering and reinventing -- buzzwords that describe a desire to become more flexible and adaptable . These efforts are a response to technological advances and a global marketplace in which traditional organizational structures , power relationships , work arrangements and leadership styles are being tested . Traditionally , most corporations have had hierarchical_structures with vertical power relationships , 40-hour workweeks , face-to-face supervision and top-down decision_making . Efficiency was more highly valued than flexibility because efficiency implied productivity ; indeed , efficiency and flexibility were seen as incompatible . Today , flexibility is directly tied to corporate survival . Business alliances require structures that look more like spider_webs than pyramids . And computers , cellular_phones and fax machines make_it possible for employees to work in a wide variety of settings , shattering the notion of working in one place . As organizations become more horizontal , management is more likely to be collegial , consensual and consultative . And as power becomes more diffused , managers will need to find new ways to supervise and monitor employees . Although the buzzwords of organizational change have become part of the corporate lexicon , there remains widespread resistance to change . This is understandable . Sharing power , control and information is a new experience for many executives , which is why off-site or home-based work and self-directed teams are still the exception to the rule . The inability to observe employees directly means the empowerment of others and building trust -- skills not often taught in business_school -- have become important . Even as corporate leaders struggle with information , power and control issues , shifting demographics require that they also deal with cultural diversity . But while most corporations see &quot; reinventing &quot; as a corporate economic imperative , cultural diversity is seen as a social equity concern of lower priority . To recruit and retain the best and the brightest , organizations need to make all employees -- regardless of sex , skin_color , physical condition or sexual orientation -- feel valued and fully utilized . However , the financial costs of not doing so are poorly understood . The result : Re-engineering and diversity issues are not perceived as related . Making corporations more adaptable to rapid change is the responsibility of CEOs , while addressing the issue of cultural diversity is the responsibility of the company ' s human resources department . In fact , the two have a symbiotic relationship . Both have to do with the competitive advantage of using people effectively . Both require similar change strategies -- issue awareness , organizational audits , philosophical change , modified policies and practices , evaluation and monitoring . By definition , efforts to make organizations more flexible make them less tied to traditional rules and performance measures and more inclined to policies and practices that are inclusive rather than exclusive . In other words , as executives become more like spiders in the middle of a web than captains on a ship , they are confronted with the need to value diversity in work arrangements as well as management styles . No longer can they depend only on those who look and act like them . As performance increasingly is measured in terms of team rather than individual behavior , cooperative rather than adversarial relationships and output rather than &quot; fitting in , &quot; managers must think and act in new ways . The Charles Schwab brokerage_firm understands the link between addressing diversity issues and achieving organizational change . Hugo Quackenbush , senior_vice_president , says that as Schwab steps back to review its business processes , it configures the desired outcome to include the power of a diverse work_force . For example , Schwab has discovered that the most efficient way to handle its customer transactions is in large , central telephone centers . In setting_up the centers , the firm has incorporated on-site training of Latinos and African Americans -- people who don ' t usually regard the brokerage business as a career opportunity . that ' s because Schwab doesn ' t see diversity as an affirmative_action issue . It sees it as a way to take_advantage of an underutilized labor_pool and gain a competitive edge . As organizations such_as Schwab start measuring success in terms other_than assimilation , there is an unleashing of human potential . When employees are given freedom to work in the ways most comfortable for them , they become more innovative and productive . It is no surprise that firms that adopt flextime and flex-place policies are those where diversity is seen as a resource rather than a problem . They are also the firms with low absenteeism , low turnover , high productivity and high worker loyalty . Corporate leaders who understand and build_on the symbiosis between increasing corporate flexibility and addressing cultural diversity will have an economic advantage over those who do not . For the two issues are compatible -- they go hand in_hand . Treating them together in an overall corporate change strategy is not only socially desirable , it is efficient and fiscally responsible .</TEXT>
