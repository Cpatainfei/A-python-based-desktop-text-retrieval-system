   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; NOTEBOOK ; BLAIR ' S GOAL-SETTING IS THE ' USUAL ' SECRET TO GOLDEN SUCCESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the day after she became the most decorated U.S. woman Olympian , with five gold medals and six medals overall , speedskater Bonnie Blair was asked if there were unexplored secrets to her success . She laughed , shook her head and said , &quot; Just the usual. &quot; The usual , she said , included an easy grasp of technique , a willingness to pay the price in training and a consistent mental approach . &quot; No matter what the competition or what the training , I ' ve always tried to find a goal and better it , &quot; she said . &quot; Going_to the line ( in the 1 # 000 meters ) , I heard the announcer say I held the track record ( established in December ) and I was determined to beat it ( and did ) . You have to have a goal or you ' re not going anywhere. &quot; Blair will compete through the World Championships in Milwaukee next February . She will stay in Europe after the Olympics for World Cup races in Germany and Holland , but her next major goal is a subsequent meet in Calgary , where she will attempt to break her 500-meter world_record of 39.1 , set_in the 1988 Olympics . &quot; I ' ve been looking_to get_in the 38s , &quot; she said . &quot; The Calgary ice is very fast . I think I can do it. &quot; Blair said the realization that the 1 # 000 was her last Olympic race hit her hardest on the victory stand when it came_to her that she would never hear the national_anthem again in the same context . &quot; It was an emotional moment and very , very difficult , &quot; she said . Blair wore her two most recently earned gold medals for photographers Thursday . Two of her other Olympic medals are in a vault in Champaign , Ill. , and the two others are in a vault in Milwaukee . &quot; Some day I hope to be able to insure them and display them safely , &quot; she said . &quot; There is something to be said for looking_at them and holding them. &quot; ROSS NEWHAN</TEXT>
