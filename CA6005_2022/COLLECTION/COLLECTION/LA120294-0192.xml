   <HEADLINE> VOWING REFORM , ZEDILLO ASSUMES TOP MEXICO POST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To the applause of world leaders ranging from Vice_President Al Gore to Cuban President Fidel Castro , Ernesto Zedillo assumed the green , white and red sash of the Mexican presidency at precisely 11 a.m. Thursday and , in his first presidential address , declared a crusade against the violence , poverty , corruption and injustice that litter Mexico ' s path to the next century . Facing deep political uncertainty , public insecurity and pockets of crushing poverty , Zedillo told Mexico ' s newly elected legislature in a nationally aired speech that he will continue the free-market reforms that opened and saved Mexico ' s economy , although they widened the gap between its rich and poor . But he promised an aggressive jobs-creation program , plans to help small and medium-size businesses &quot; as never before , &quot; and an unprecedented effort to educate all Mexicans through high_school . There was lingering skepticism from opposition leaders and an angry protest at Mexico_City ' s Monument to the Revolution . The demonstration erupted in violence that left at least 40 injured , five seriously , when a small group that the government identified as provocateurs broke from an estimated 10 # 000 peasants who were calling_for civil insurrection and attacked police with stones . Riot squads withstood nearly an hour of the stone-throwing before responding with tear_gas and clubs . The protesters set fire to a truck bearing Zedillo ' s ruling party symbol in an incident the government classified as &quot; minor. &quot; Against the backdrop of that violence , Zedillo , a Mexicali shoeshine boy who rose to the highest post in the land , promised to reduce the power of the presidency and separate it for the first time from his Institutional Revolutionary Party , which has governed Mexico for 65 years . And he vowed to radically restructure a judicial_system that has made corruption synonymous with the police and the courts in a nation he cast as being_on the brink of historic change . As he outlined Mexico ' s new course after taking the presidential sash from outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in an emotional 15-second handshake , Zedillo also ordered immediate acceleration of official investigations into two major political assassinations that altered the course of Mexican history this year . Fueling the widespread sense of national insecurity , Zedillo said , are the yet-unsolved Sept . 28 killing in Mexico_City of the ruling party ' s secretary_general , Francisco Ruiz Massieu , and the murder in Tijuana in March of Luis Donaldo Colosio , Zedillo ' s predecessor as the party ' s handpicked presidential candidate . &quot; We will not rest until justice has been served , &quot; he declared , announcing that &quot; at this moment &quot; he was directing newly appointed Atty . Gen . Antonio Lozano -- for the first time , a Cabinet member from the opposition -- &quot; to significantly intensify the investigations and inform the public of their progress until the investigations come_to an end. &quot; About Chiapas , the southernmost Mexican state where an armed peasant guerrilla movement has threatened to rebel anew when the ruling party ' s elected governor attempts to take_office next Thursday , Zedillo said only that he is &quot; convinced it is possible to achieve new negotiations that will lead us to a just , honorable and definitive peace. &quot; The Mexican army , which crushed the rebellion in January , will maintain its unilateral cease-fire , Zedillo said , acknowledging that &quot; the conditions of extreme poverty and neglect &quot; in the state &quot; fueled that violence. &quot; Zedillo saved his most urgent comments for the escalating street crime , kidnapings , robberies and general insecurity he is inheriting from Salinas -- whom he otherwise praised and thanked as a president &quot; who governed with vision. &quot; &quot; In the last few years , particularly in recent months , we have lived_in a climate of growing anxiety and insecurity , &quot; Zedillo told his audience in the cavernous legislative hall . &quot; We have suffered major public crimes that have not been altogether clarified ; we have suffered from violence on a daily basis and from a deficient performance by the institutions in_charge of public safety and law_enforcement . &quot; Today , more_than ever , Mexico must be a country of laws . That is what everyone , everywhere , is calling_for . . . . In order to tackle the rampant crime , the frequent violations of civil and human_rights and the grave public insecurity , we will launch an in-depth and genuine reform of the institutions in_charge of the procurement of justice. &quot; Concluding that his would be a compassionate , open and progressive presidency &quot; to serve all Mexicans with dedication . . . with pride . . . with an unbreakable spirit and nationalist conviction , &quot; Zedillo then sped away from the downtown Chamber of Deputies in a motorcade to Mexico_City ' s National Palace . His parade route did not pass near the downtown monument commemorating Mexico ' s bloody 1910 revolution , where the anti-government protesters shouted &quot; Zedillo Out ! &quot; and praised the Zapatista National Liberation Army for its rebellion in Chiapas . Zedillo drove directly to the palace , where he continued to follow to the letter Mexico ' s longstanding traditions of power transition . In a blizzard of green , white and red confetti that filled the air with the colors of Mexico ' s flag -- which is also the tricolor of the ruling party -- Zedillo stepped onto the presidential balcony of the National Palace overlooking an expansive historic square . He led thousands of soldiers , sailors and police in the national_anthem , for the first time as their commander_in_chief . Inside the palace , Zedillo spent the next hour greeting Mexico ' s most powerful and wealthy elite -- bankers , business_leaders , politicians and priests -- with handshakes and hugs , before adjourning to a lunch at the National Anthropology Museum with present and former heads_of_state , among them former President George_Bush . Within minutes of his speech at the national legislature , opposition leaders gave Zedillo mixed reviews of his earliest performance in what all acknowledged is one of Mexico ' s most trying hours . But they made_it equally clear that the 12th consecutive PRI president will enjoy a honeymoon , however brief , with a loyal opposition -- something accorded few of his predecessors . Alejandro Gonzalez Alcocer , a National Action Party deputy , expressed confidence in Zedillo ' s political will to fulfill his cornucopia of promises . &quot; I think now , because of the special circumstances in Mexico and the situation we find ourselves in , he is obligated to keep his promises . Because if he doesn ' t , who knows what will become of us. &quot; Still , national legislators from the populist , opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party were less generous . The party ' s parliamentary leader , Senator Hector Sanchez Lopez , delivered the opening speech of Thursday ' s special inaugural session , and he used it to sharply condemn Salinas ' legacy and cast doubt on Zedillo ' s ability to alter it . Sanchez attacked Zedillo for appointing to his Cabinet Ignacio Pichardo , the ruling party chairman accused last week of obstructing justice by the chief investigator in the Ruiz Massieu murder .</TEXT>
