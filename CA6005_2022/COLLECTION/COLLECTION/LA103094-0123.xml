   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; WILL THE PEACE-MINDED ARABS PULL THE PLUG ON HAMAS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It might seem ironic to many Western observers that Israel ' s recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization , its implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles and its new peace_treaty with Jordan have emboldened and strengthened Hamas , the Islamic Resistance Movement . But recall that many in the West never understood the antipathy of most Egyptians , and much of the Arab world , toward Anwar Sadat ' s peace diplomacy or the rage and hostility , in_general , of Islamic militants toward the West . Still , with both hope and expectations of what peace can mean growing throughout the Middle_East , is it not possible that Hamas ' influence will diminish as Arab governments line_up to sign treaties with Israel ? Well aware of the rising influence of Hamas during the waning years of Israel ' s occupation , PLO Chairman Yassir Arafat tried to co-opt or neutralize Hamas by offering its leadership the opportunity to participate in his self-governing authority . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin discreetly attempted to strengthen Arafat ' s hand , but was handicapped by his own vulnerability to right-wing opposition to any dealings with the Palestinian leader . So far , Arafat has neither improved the daily lives of most Palestinians nor successfully tempered Hamas ' violent opposition to peaceful reconciliation with Israel . Hamas , ever conscious of Arafat ' s dilemma , continues to promote armed struggle against Israel but its strategy is not to fight the Declaration of Principles ; rather , it is to take maximum advantage of it . Arafat thus finds himself caught between the Israeli hammer and the Hamas anvil . Hamas members slay two Israelis while shooting_up a cafe district in Jerusalem ; kidnaps and murders an Israeli soldier , and orchestrates the terrorist bombing of a commuter bus in Tel Aviv , killing 23 . In response , Israel pushes Arafat to crack_down . Arrests are made to appease Israel ' s outrage , but Hamas activists are promptly released by the Palestinian Authority . The net result is the strengthening of Hamas at Arafat ' s expense . Against this background , Arafat lamely argues that he can persuade Hamas to cooperate with him and eventually come_to terms with Israel . Nevertheless , even Arafat ' s own political organization , Al-Fatah , acknowledges that Hamas claims the loyalty of at least 25 % of the population in the Gaza Strip . Of direct consequence to Israeli security and to Israeli confidence in Rabin ' s negotiating skills is the fact that Arafat has not acted to neutralize the armed wing of Hamas . By withdrawing from Gaza and turning security chores over to the Palestinian police , the Israelis have witnessed a rapid and dramatic increase in the amount and type of weaponry now being fielded by Hamas terrorists . With the ever more sophisticated arming of various Palestinian factions , an escalation to which Arafat has acquiesced , Gaza is beginning to resemble Beirut before the Lebanese civil_war , which began in 1975 . In addition to possessing automatic_rifles and rocket-propelled grenades , Hamas has reportedly acquired anti-tank guided missiles and other short-range high-performance weapon_systems . Non-Palestinian veterans of the war in Afghanistan are now turning_up in Gaza . For these zealots , the cause of Hamas may hold even greater importance than the liberation of Afghanistan . Since its inception during the intifada , Hamas has been affiliated with an organization known as Ikhwan al-Muslimin , or the Muslim Brotherhood . Founded in Egypt in the 1920s , the Muslim Brotherhood has consistently called_for the removal of secular regimes and the establishment of Islamic governments . Organized along national lines , its chapters have pursued this goal using various means and strategies , some peaceful , others violent . Following the liberation of Afghanistan by the mujahedeen , Hamas assumed the mantle of the vanguard of the Brotherhood . At international conferences , it repeatedly affirmed that &quot; the route to Islamic redemption is the liberation of Jerusalem and Palestine. &quot; The liberation of Jerusalem became the rallying cry of Muslim Brotherhood organizations . Thus , the agreement by Israel and Jordan to assign responsibility for the preservation of Muslim holy_places in Jerusalem to Jordan ' s King Hussein has further inflamed the passions of Islamic fundamentalists everywhere . Although most Muslim governments , with the exceptions of Iran and Sudan , have cut_back or eliminated their support for Hamas , the Muslim Brotherhood is increasing its backing . A virulent foe of Arab-Israeli peace , Tehran continues to be the boldest supporter of Hamas at the state level . Its budget last year included a line titled &quot; Aid to the Palestinian Revolution -- $ 20 million , &quot; an amount comparable_to 1 % of the gross_domestic_product of the occupied territories . With an embassy in Tehran and close ties to the Hezbollah in Lebanon , Hamas can count_on Iran and its numerous overseas revolutionary_groups to continue to provide financial , weapons and political support . Of even greater consequence , however , is the steady stream of money , materiel , human and moral support that Hamas is receiving from its affiliates around the world , including organizations in the United States . Muslim Brotherhood chapters can be found in nearly every Muslim country , as well as in Germany , France , England and other European states . Hamas representatives regularly meet with these groups to solicit financial_support and volunteers . It will not be easy to stop the flow of money and arms , even from the United States , where it is now a top U.S. priority . But the wide-ranging implementation of such difficult measures is vital if peace is to endure and expand . Important progress has been achieved in the Middle_East . But those who desire to see a comprehensive peace settlement must prepare_for terrorist attacks by Hamas and its supporters outside the Middle_East as well as inside Israel . People of goodwill everywhere -- including Arabs and Israelis -- must cooperate as they have never managed to before if the violent zealotry of these militants is to be overcome. *</TEXT>
