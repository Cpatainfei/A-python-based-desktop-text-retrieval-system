   <HEADLINE> BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT PRESSES OFFENSIVE ON SERB POST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Government forces pressed their offensive in northern Bosnia on Monday , apparently seeking control of a key Serbian communications post . Bosnian radio reported major Serbian losses elsewhere in the north . The radio said Muslim-led government troops had seized 12 square_miles of territory from Bosnian Serbs in several days of &quot; severe fighting &quot; around Kladanj , 25 miles northeast of Sarajevo . More_than 100 Serbian soldiers died , it said . The report could not be independently confirmed . If true , it would be one of the biggest land gains during a single government offensive against the Serbs , who hold 70 % of Bosnia ' s territory after two years of fighting . In Belgrade , meanwhile , Russia signaled it is standing_firm on a new peace plan worked_out with the United States and several European states , despite Bosnian Serb reluctance to give_up war gains . The plan would give the Serbs 49 % of Bosnia , and the new Croat-Muslim federation would get 51 % . &quot; The percentages of territorial delimitation are non-negotiable , and this goes_for all three parties in the conflict , &quot; Russian envoy Vitaly S . Churkin said in Belgrade . The European Union endorsed the peace plan Monday and said it will draft a new map of Bosnia to reflect the proposed division . In the Bosnian capital , the United Nations reported finding heavy_weapons in the 12-mile exclusion zone around Sarajevo . Spokesman Maj . Rob Annink said U.N. military observers found a 60-millimeter Serbian mortar and an 82-millimeter Serbian mortar in a neighborhood within the zone . U.N. officials were negotiating with the Serbs to remove the weapons or place them under U.N. supervision , he said .</TEXT>
