We pleaded for more time. &quot; But ABC informed Moffitt the network wasn ' t keen on asking audiences to invest four hours on one program , considering competition from cable and other channels . Still , Moffitt managed to cover everything but children ' s programming . Don ' t look_for a lot of clips from ABC ' s early years . Some of the material , Moffitt says , has been lost . And a lot of what they found wasn ' t very good . &quot; ABC ' s 40th Anniversary Special &quot; airs Saturday at 8 p.m. on ABC .</TEXT>
