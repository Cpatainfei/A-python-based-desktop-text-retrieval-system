   <HEADLINE> VICTIMS OF CORPORATE LAYOFFS LOSE MORE THAN THEIR INCOME ; PSYCHOLOGY : NEW COUNSELING TECHNIQUE ADDRESSES THE SENSE OF LOSS THAT EXECUTIVES MAY FEEL AFTER BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR WORK FAMILIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They work together , eat together , know each other ' s spouses and children , and share the daily peaks and valleys that make_up a lifetime . So when the layoff notice comes , more_than income is lost : A whole family is torn_apart and bereavement is common . That is the premise of a new counseling technique being used by Dr. Robert Deutsch , a Connecticut psychologist who has seen a big jump in the number of laid-off business_executives as the defense , aerospace and insurance industries have been rocked by economic hard_times . &quot; These executives spend an inordinate amount_of_time at_work and the work-family relationships are vital to them , &quot; he says . &quot; Many of these folks find themselves , at the drop of a nickel , losing their entire work family. &quot; Deutsch said that because of this , one of the first items on the agenda is bereavement counseling , as well as crisis_intervention . &quot; It is often the first time they have experienced failure , so they really do not have an adaptive template for coping_with rejection and loss , &quot; said Deutsch , an associate at Bank &amp; Hiebel Child and Family Associates . &quot; These men and women are devastated by the experience. &quot; The founder and president of Private Interventions for Public People Inc. , which specializes in counseling executives and celebrities with substance_abuse problems , Deutsch says business_executives who lose their jobs struggle with shame and are often reluctant to seek help . &quot; They ' re ashamed of a dramatic change in image . They ' re fearful of never achieving success again . They ' re fearful of the impact of this experience on family_relationships , peer relationships , &quot; he said . &quot; These are people who aren ' t accustomed to asking_for help . Many of these folks are former elite athletes who are not only extremely successful in the boardroom , but maybe played professional ball as well . They ' re accustomed to achieving all_the time. &quot; Deutsch said he has found the slogans and survival techniques used in recovery programs like Alcoholics Anonymous -- concepts such_as looking_at life one day or one hour at a time -- helpful in teaching these men and women to reduce the pressure on themselves . Such a notion is radical for people who by nature are long-range planners , he said . Families also are brought_in to deal with their own sense_of_shame and fears of economic insecurity and instability , he said . &quot; When an executive is laid_off you often see major disruptions in parent-child relationships and in marital relationships , &quot; said Deutsch . &quot; It is not unusual to see sexual dysfunction , or depressive reactions . Kids might develop fears , sleep_disorders . They have always had the notion that things were solid , and then suddenly there is a major crack in the lining. &quot; He said he urges his clients to give themselves time to recover from the blow of losing a job and to exercise restraint and caution instead of jumping back into the workplace to escape the discomfort of being unemployed . The recovery time varies from person to person , said Deutsch , and depends_on the executive ' s personal history , whether they were raised in healthy families and learned good coping skills . Women executives , he said , tend to be more resilient because they have had more experience with facing roadblocks in their lives and are_better able to adapt to change . &quot; Also , women typically are_better able to benefit from support_systems , &quot; Deutsch said . &quot; Men tend to isolate more when they have this experience. &quot;</TEXT>
