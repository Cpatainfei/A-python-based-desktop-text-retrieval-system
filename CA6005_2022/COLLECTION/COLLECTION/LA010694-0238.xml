   <HEADLINE> THE SPIN_DOCTORS ; FLYWHEELS SEEN AS KEY TO A PRACTICAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the basin where the word smog was invented , alternative-fuel vehicles -- particularly cars that store energy in flywheels -- will be a center_of_attention at this year ' s Los Angeles Auto Show , which opens Saturday . Chrysler Corp . will show_off its concept of a flywheel-assisted race_car , which the company unveiled Wednesday in Detroit . And American Flywheel System , a small company based in Bellevue , Wash. , will display a sedan that would run entirely on the energy-storage devices , called flywheel batteries . The international push by auto_makers to develop a practical electric_car has been slowed by researchers ' difficulties in coming_up with batteries able to replicate the driving features of gasoline-powered autos . Proponents say high-tech flywheels , which store energy through the same ancient principle used in a potter ' s wheel , could be used as a new battery to make electric_cars a reality . &quot; There ' s a lot going_on lately in flywheels , &quot; said Jim Birk , director of storage and renewables at the Electric_Power Research Institute , which conducts research and development work for the major U.S. electric utilities . One plus for flywheels in transportation uses : fast acceleration . &quot; Flywheels have the characteristic of very fast response_time , &quot; Birk said . Another , according to Edward W . Furia , American Flywheel Systems chairman and chief_executive , is their potential to greatly increase driving range . Furia estimates that between charges , his flywheel car will be able to go more_than three times the current 100-mile range of many of the best existing electric_cars . American Flywheel Systems &quot; has some very interesting concepts , &quot; said Philip C . Symons , manager of public transportation projects at EPRI , &quot; but it remains to be proved that the performance required for electric vehicles can be achieved. &quot; American Flywheel developed its storage_device with the manufacturer , Minneapolis-based Honeywell , which for three decades has built flywheels for the aerospace and defense industries . The Chrysler car , called the Patriot , has a 500-horsepower liquid-natural-gas-burning turbine , but it uses the flywheel to store excess energy . Both the turbine and flywheel feed an electric_motor that runs the race_car at speeds of up_to 200 m.p.h. The Chrysler carbon-fiber flywheel is similar to that used in satellites . In the race_car , it stores excess energy produced by the turbine and captures kinetic_energy produced when the brakes are applied . &quot; Where is it written that a car that is ' green ' cannot be red-hot with excitement , &quot; Francois Castaing , Chrysler ' s vice_president of vehicle engineering , said in unveiling the car at the North_American International Auto Show in Detroit . The American Flywheel car and other attempts to harness flywheels as the main energy-storage device for a vehicle are aimed at meeting California ' s zero-emission vehicle rules , which essentially require major auto_makers to offer electric_cars for_sale in California showrooms beginning in 1998 . The race_car project serves a dual purpose for Chrysler . It allows the company to re-enter big-time racing while placing a priority on research and development for the clean car of the future -- including cars known as hybrids , which run_on two fuels . Hybrid vehicles are seen as promising , particularly by auto_makers faced with the 1998 deadline , because the two sources of propulsion help extend vehicle range and performance . Auto_makers have called_for amending the California rules to achieve air_pollution reductions without requiring electric_cars . Though hybrids have low emissions , they would not meet California ' s looming zero-emission standard . Chrysler hopes to have a working model of its race_car within several months and to decide within the year whether to proceed further . It hopes to be sanctioned by international and U.S. motor sports groups to compete in endurance races in a special class for cutting-edge vehicles . Castaing said cars using such technology would probably not be ready for the market until well into the next century . Other alternative-fuel vehicles at the Los Angeles show will include a Mitsubishi electric hybrid that claims a range of 310 miles in its battery-only mode , a Ford natural-gas version of its big Crown Victoria , and a Chrysler natural_gas minivan that will be the first vehicle to be certified by the state Air Resources Board as an ultra-low-emissions vehicle . There will also be a stubby , high-efficiency Mercedes-Benz &quot; city car , &quot; the first of a new class of Mercedes designed for extremely high efficiency in versions that use gasoline , diesel or electric_batteries . How Flywheel Batteries Work Using the same ancient energy-storage principle that keeps a potter ' s wheel or yo-yo turning , high-tech flywheels can be used to store electricity , much like a standard battery . Charging the battery with electricity increases the speed of the flywheel , up_to 200 # 000 revolutions per minute . As electricity is drained from the battery to run an engine , the flywheel gradually slows_down . Proponents say that modern , highly efficient flywheels -- which spin in a vacuum on non-touching magnetic bearings -- could power electric_cars better than more traditional chemical batteries , giving_up to three times the driving range . The Wheel : Small , speedy wheels made of tough composite_materials store the energy . Vacuum casing : The wheel spins in a vacuum , to greatly lower resistance . Magnetic bearings : Because the same magnetic_poles repel each other , magnets are used to suspend the wheel as it spins , without the friction of traditional bearings which physically touch .
