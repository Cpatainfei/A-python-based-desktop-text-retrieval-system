   <TEXT> Selecting an All-American auto racing team can be a difficult task in some years , but in 1993 most of the choices for the American Auto Racing Writers &amp; Broadcasters Assn . team were easy picks . Dale Earnhardt , the Winston Cup champion for the sixth time driving a Chevrolet Lumina , and Rusty Wallace , whose 10 victories in a Pontiac Grand Prix brought him close to Earnhardt , were obvious selections in the stock_car category . It was Earnhardt ' s sixth time and Wallace ' s third as first-team choices . Nigel Mansell , the charismatic Englishman who won the PPG Cup Indy Car championship with a Lola-Ford Cosworth in his first try after having won the Formula One crown a year earlier ; and Paul Tracy , the young Canadian who matched Mansell with five victories in a Penske-Chevrolet , were obvious selections in the open-wheel division . Left out was Emerson Fittipaldi , Tracy ' s teammate and the Indianapolis 500 winner . It was Mansell ' s first time on the team , in his first venture into American racing . For Tracy , who had replaced Rick Mears on the Penske team and drove_in his first full Indy car season , it was his second selection . In 1990 , he had received an at-large berth . Eddie Hill and John Force were standouts for the drag-racing portion of the 12-driver team . Hill , 57 , became the oldest professional driver to win a national event , much less a championship , when he earned his first National Hot Rod Assn . top-fuel title with a record-tying six-victory season . Force won the funny-car class in an Olds Cutlass with a record 11 victories . Each so dominated his class that no other top-fuel or funny-car driver won more_than two races . Force also made the first_team in 1991 , but it was the first time for Hill . Juan Manuel Fangio II , winner of the Jerry Titus Award last year as the leading vote-getter in AARWBA balloting , again headed the road-racing category after driving a Toyota Eagle to the final International Motor Sports Assn . Camel GT series championship . Fangio won seven races , matching his 1992 total , in edging teammate P.J. Jones for the crown . He was joined by Scott Sharp , the Trans-Am champion , who won six races in his Camaro . It was the second selection for both road racers , Fangio getting the honor last year and Sharp in 1991 . Steve Kinser , with 13 World of Outlaw sprint-car championships in 15 years , was selected to one of the short-track berths for the 12th time . Kinser won 19 of the Outlaws ' 68 races . The other berth went_to Chevrolet driver Johnny Benson Jr. , champion of the American Speed Assn . stock_car circuit . Benson , a first-time selection , edged Mike Bliss , the United States Auto Club ' s Silver Crown champion , by a single vote . Ron Shuman , who was not on the AARWBA ballot , might have been a more deserving selection . Shuman had the USAC Silver Crown title apparently won at the end of the final race , but when one driver was penalized after the checkered flag , it moved Bliss up one position and he finished the season two points ahead of Shuman . The Arizona veteran also won his eighth Turkey Night Midget Grand Prix , one of USAC ' s most prestigious races , and three California Racing Assn . sprint car features . At-large selections were off-road racer Ivan Stewart and Indy Lights champion Bryan Herta . Stewart dominated off-road racing , winning the SCORE International series in his Toyota truck by sweeping both Baja races , the 500 and the 1000 . In the Baja 1000 , he drove solo and won the overall championship by beating all_the motorcycles as well as four-wheeled competition . It was the first time a truck had won overall since 1979 . Stewart also won stadium races in San Diego , Las Vegas and the Rose Bowl . Herta won seven of 12 Indy Lights races , but his at-large position on the All-America team is a bit suspect because even though the Lights series is promoted as a training ground for future Indy drivers , Herta was selected over established Indy drivers such_as Fittipaldi , Al Unser Jr. , Danny Sullivan and Mario Andretti , all_of whom won Indy car_races on the major_league circuit . The Titus Award winner , which will be chosen from among Earnhardt , Force and Mansell , will be announced Saturday night at the AARWBA banquet in Charlotte , N.C.
