   <HEADLINE> CHARLES BUKOWSKI , 1920-1994</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A large gravelly head , deep-set eyes often hidden in shadow . This is either the head of some creature that staggered from its cave to tear Sinbad and his sailors limb from limb , or a profound and formidable visage that would look fine on Mount_Rushmore alongside the other notables . A face like that must give a man a sense of destiny . Los Angeles poet and fiction writer Charles Bukowski , who died of leukemia on March 9 at the age of 73 , managed to create a life worthy of his face . And he produced a voluminous body_of_work that documented that life in the underbelly of Los Angeles , tales of ribald exploits laced with self-deprecating humor . Prostitutes broke his heart . Beefy men beat him up in fights he usually started . And there were old_men , too , in this urban landscape , generally &quot; in four dollar rooms / looking_for socks in dresser drawers / while standing in brown underwear . . . &quot; ( from &quot; lack of almost everything &quot; ) . Bukowski went_by the alias Henry Chinaski in his fiction and by his own name in his poetry , but the boorish , half-endearing underdog persona never changed . It won him a folk hero status in the international literary underground . Bukowski once wrote that style came from lack of pretension . Well , Bukowski had a little pretension , all that magnificent self-debasement , those public displays of excess . Yet he had a style anyway , a blunt , no-frills one , and it spawned a ton of imitators . Wordsworth , Whitman , William Carlos Williams and The Beats_in their respective generations moved poetry toward a more natural_language . Bukowski moved it a little farther . He was never a university poets ' poet but a populist voice , a Carl Sandburg for the down-and-out set . &quot; I like desperate men , men with broken teeth and broken minds and broken ways , &quot; he wrote in his story , &quot; Guts. &quot; &quot; I also like vile women , drunk cursing bitches with loose stockings and sloppy mascara faces. &quot; Unlike Sandburg , though , Bukowski never declared himself to be an ambassador of the people ; that would have been too corny . He never declared himself to be anything except a hard drinker , a womanizer , a racetrack aficionado and above all -- absolutely above all -- a poet . And one more thing : He declared himself to be Bukowski . His biographer Neeli Cherkovski recalls that Bukowski was fond of saying : &quot; When I met Neeli he was 16 and I was Bukowski. &quot; When word of Bukowski ' s death got_out , John Martin , Bukowski ' s editor at Black Sparrow Press in Santa Rosa , received calls from readers in Latin_America , France , the_Netherlands , all_over , many of them crying . The owner of a coffee_shop in Seattle called : &quot; Someone ' s put a sign outside my place that says Charles Bukowski ' s dead . People are crying . Is it true ? &quot; And here in Los Angeles , poets who liked him and those who didn ' t will remember for a long_time where they were and what they were doing when they got the news . On Saturday , March 26 , drivers passing the 8300 block of Beverly Boulevard must have wondered briefly at the rows of folding_chairs on the sidewalk and the standing-room-only crowd gazing through the window of Arundel Antiquarian Books . KCRW had set_up a microphone so that the overflow crowd could hear the Bukowski memorial addresses taking_place inside . Several speakers recounted a similar experience : &quot; I heard a poem on the radio and recognized it as Bukowski ' s , but it was an AM station . I thought , ' oh oh , this can ' t be good. &quot; ( Bill Mohr ) &quot; I was in Hawaii . I saw his name on the front page of the news with a photograph . I knew there was no Nobel Prize . I knew it was something dreadful. &quot; ( Neeli Cherkovski ) Those who ' d known him called him &quot; Hank &quot; or &quot; Buk , &quot; and those who hadn ' t nevertheless felt as if they had . Though he ' d been living rather reclusively in San Pedro with his wife and had not given a public reading for years , in literary L.A. his presence was keenly felt . He didn ' t hold_out for prestigious publications ; the most famous poet of the region published in everything , even homemade ventures , stapled , photocopied , lousy-looking things . As Charles Webb testified , one only had to ask and he ' d send a bunch of poems with a note -- &quot; Take what you need . . . Buk &quot; -- and always a little doodle next to his name . Of course he could afford to ; he turned_out poems like one possessed or driven , as if that dog from hell noted in one of his titles was nipping at his heels . There were anecdotes and laughter on this occasion , but Joan Jobe Smith altered the mood , suddenly putting_down her book . &quot; I don ' t want to read anything , &quot; she said quietly . &quot; Charles Bukowski has left the building . Charles Bukowski has left L.A. Hail Bukowski. &quot; &quot; Hail Bukowski , &quot; said the audience . But although he had been writing_about and imagining his death for 30 years , it seemed impossible that Charles could leave L.A. Bukowski was born in Germany on Aug . 16 , 1920 , and came_to Los Angeles at age 3 . He had the kind of childhood that qualifies people to weep on all_the afternoon talk_shows . Brutal father , indifferent mother . In adolescence he broke_out with terrible boils , which scarred his face and deepened his sense of isolation . ( Much of that period is revealed in the novel &quot; Ham On Rye. &quot; ) Until he began to make a living from his writing at around age 50 , he worked every odd job known to man or woman , in a dog_biscuit factory , a New York subway , women ' s dress factories and meat-packing plants , on a track gang laying train tracks across the country , two days as a janitor at the L.A. Times , and finally , a job that lasted for a while -- at the Central Post_Office . He commemorated that one in his first novel , &quot; Post_Office &quot; ( 1971 ) , a turning point for the writer who till then had only a tiny cult following as a poet . Later he would write_about those rough years honestly and sometimes humorously , but seldom with the raw vulnerability revealed in his more personal_letters of the time . In September , 1962 , Bukowski was bleeding from a drinking-related malady and suicidally depressed over the conditions of his life . Jane , the woman he is said never to have forgotten , had recently died of alcoholism . &quot; Blood again this morning . And do you know it ' s ugly ? Not the bright red that floats at the top . . . . They drained it out of my love when she died . She used to wear my torn yellow bathrobe and walk_about the room . Plop , plop , plop , she walked like a simple child . And I loved her . I loved her from Armenia to the top of the sun , and now the yellow robe hangs_in my closet and she ' s rotting in a grave . So I sit here in my triangle ; madness , death by hemorrhage , and suicide . . . . &quot; He had little reason to believe at the time that 30 years down the line his collected letters , &quot; Screams from the Balcony , &quot; would sell 10 # 000 copies in two days . ( The letter to Jon Webb quoted above appears not in that collection but in Webb ' s 1960s magazine , The Outsider. ) He didn ' t imagine that someday a famous actor named Mickey Rourke would give a comic , affectionate portrayal of him in a film called &quot; Barfly &quot; and that Faye Dunaway would play Jane . The unguarded emotion in the letter is stunning , coming from one who later would insist on being perceived as a crusty anti-romantic . And it seems to contradict the charge that he didn ' t like women . &quot; What are you going_to say about Bukowski and women ? &quot; a woman called to ask me when she heard this article was in the works . Some women have noted Bukowski ' s insensitive language -- he liked to talk dirty -- but this caller had a more serious complaint ; she ' d been shallowly characterized in one of his books . One must say this : He did not often draw his women characters with much depth or distinction . He did not often let his readers glimpse the Bukowski of Sept . 12 , 1962 . He was probably as leery of sentimentality as he was of self-pity . He did not always do much better by men . He seems to have felt something , though , for the women he kept crawling back to after they ' d struck him down and left him for dead . Henry Chinaski is beaten_up by more women than any man in Western literature . Of course , Charles Bukowski was politically incorrect before some thinly talented radio personality made_it the rage . He sported the grunge look before a Seattle band set the fashion . He predated the new appreciation of older_women ; he declared women are the most_desirable at the age when they ' re just starting to fall_apart , which is good news for some of us . He continued to drink hard_liquor straight from the bottle long after imported water had replaced martinis on the social scene , and only the influence of a woman he loved , then married , was able to slow him down . He was a writer who insisted on being out-of-step with his times . &quot; The most important thing to realize about him , &quot; said John Martin , &quot; is that he didn ' t want to go_with any trends or join groups . Charles Bukowski stood alone. &quot; Something else is important to know about him . He said of his typewriter , as Scott Wannberg recalled at the memorial : &quot; It all begins and ends here . In the moment. &quot; His &quot; typer &quot; he called it , and it was the love of his life . Bukowski said : &quot; The first thing writing must do is save your own ass. &quot; And so it did , for longer than he imagined it could . Writing , poetry : the mad dog nipping at his heels , and the wild_horse running_away over the_hills . The Secret , by CHARLES BUKOWSKI don ' t worry , nobody has the beautiful lady , not really , and nobody has the strange and hidden power , nobody is exceptional or wonderful or magic , they only seem to be it ' s all a trick , an in , a con , don ' t buy_it , don ' t believe it . the world is packed with billions of people whose lives and deaths are useless and when one of these jumps up and the light of history shines upon them , forget it , it ' s not what it seems , it ' s just another act to fool the fools again . there are no strong men , there are no beautiful women . at least , you can die knowing this and you will have the only possible victory .</TEXT>
