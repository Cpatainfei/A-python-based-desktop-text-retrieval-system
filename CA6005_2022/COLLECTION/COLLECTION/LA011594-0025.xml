   <HEADLINE> BALLOT INITIATIVES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * This is one citizen who was less than saddened to learn that it will be a bad year for ballot initiatives ( Jan . 5 ) . While noble in intention , this lawmaking process is a disaster . To expect the average voter to read , research and understand the volumes of information required to make intelligent decisions is unrealistic . Prop . 103 , for example , was an absurd , simplistic approach to rising insurance costs . The death of potentially harmful initiatives such_as pay-at-the-pump should be a cause for celebration .
