   <HEADLINE> HIJACKING ENDS WITHOUT INJURY IN NICARAGUA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Salvadoran claiming he had an explosive_device hijacked a commercial airliner carrying 78 passengers Sunday , but the crisis ended peacefully when he was arrested at the airport here , officials said . Nicaraguan Interior Minister Alfredo Mendieta told reporters that three military intelligence_agents posing as civilian negotiators captured the hijacker after determining that an alleged bomb he had wielded was a fake . Officials said he was seeking asylum outside his country , but his motives were not clear . The hijacker was carrying a passport that identified him as Angel Alberto Salguera Narvaez , 24 , but Mendieta said the passport may be fake . The hijacking began in Guatemala where Salguera boarded a Panamanian COPA airlines Boeing 737 en route to El_Salvador . While over his native country , Salguera unveiled a taped-up bundle he said was a bomb and ordered the pilot to fly to Mexico . According to a COPA press_release , the pilot , Capt . Jorge Llaurado , told Salguera the plane did not have enough fuel to reach Mexico and instead flew to Managua . The passengers were allowed to leave the plane as it sat on the runway , officials said . Mendieta said Nicaraguan and Salvadoran officials were conferring about how to proceed since the hijacking occurred in Salvadoran airspace . He said Salguera , who was carrying a Bible , was thought to be an opponent of El_Salvador ' s rightist government but it was not known if he had fought with leftist rebels in the 12-year civil_war that ended in 1992 . Carlos Charry , a Reuters news service technician on board the flight , said the crew handled the problem so quietly that passengers were unaware of any problem until the pilot announced before landing that an &quot; abnormal situation &quot; had come_up .</TEXT>
