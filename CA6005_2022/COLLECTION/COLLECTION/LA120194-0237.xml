   <HEADLINE> NEW TACTIC MAY EASE TRANSPLANTS OF BONE_MARROW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A novel technique for performing bone_marrow transplants could allow virtually any family member of a leukemia patient to serve as a donor , a prospect that could eliminate the need for the tearful televised pleas for donors that have become common in recent years , researchers said Wednesday . Using seven to 10 times the normal amount of donor marrow enables scientists to overwhelm the recipient ' s immune_system , allowing a much less precise immunological match than is required now , Italian and Israeli researchers report in the journal Blood . Bone_marrow transplants are a treatment of last_resort for victims of leukemia and breast_cancer and are slowly growing in importance as a therapy for as_many as 60 genetic_disorders , including thalassemia and sickle_cell disease . About 5 # 000 people receive bone_marrow transplants each year -- the vast majority for leukemia -- but 5 # 000 to 15 # 000 die after they are denied them because of a lack of matching donors , according to the National Institutes of Health . The team , led by biophysicist Yair Reisner of the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot , Israel , and Dr. Massimo F . Martelli of the Polyclinico Monteluce in Perugia , Italy , has treated 35 Italian patients and is continuing to accept at least one per week . At least three medical_centers in the United States are planning trials soon , including Childrens Hospital Los Angeles . &quot; This is a rather exciting and simple technological advance that , if it proves out_in other centers , will greatly increase the scope of successful bone_marrow transplants , &quot; said Dr. John Laszlo , vice_president for research at the American Cancer Society . &quot; We ' re cautiously excited , &quot; added Reisner . &quot; We still have to prove it with more patients , but it looks very good so far. &quot; The bone_marrow transplant is not itself therapeutic -- it does not kill cancer_cells . That is achieved with very high doses of radiation and chemotherapy , which are used in an attempt to wipe_out the last vestiges of cancer_cells in leukemia patients who have not improved with lower doses of chemotherapy . But these high doses also kill the healthy bone_marrow . Bone_marrow is the source of all blood_cells , both white and red . Without it , a patient normally dies within a_few days . A transplant gives the patient a new immune_system . But good results require an exact match at the eight histocompatibility sites on the cell , called loci , that are used by immunologists to determine tissue compatibility . About 30 % of leukemia patients have a brother or sister who is an exact match and 3 % to 5 % have another relative who is such a match . In such cases , about 90 % of the grafts are successful . If a relative is not available , a donor is sought among unrelated individuals . On average , about one person in every 20 # 000 will provide an immunological match for any patient at five or six of the loci . Since 1987 , there have been about 2 # 900 transplants using unrelated donors , according to the International Bone_Marrow Transplant Registry . The overall success rate for these patients ranges between 30 % and 40 % , depending_on the stage of their disease . Reisner has been working_on rodents for 10 years trying to find a way to circumvent the need for precisely matched donors . He concluded that the primary reason for rejection of an unmatched marrow graft is residual white_cells from the patient ' s immune_system , which prevent survival of the graft . Reisner ' s studies in mice showed that using &quot; megadoses &quot; of donor marrow could overcome this problem , allowing the graft to survive . These megadoses are much greater than the amount of marrow that can be obtained from the bone in an arm or leg , the usual site of a donation . To obtain the necessary quantities for use in humans , Martelli adapted a technique that is used to preserve bone_marrow in breast_cancer patients who receive high doses of chemotherapy or radiation . He injects a hormone into the donor to stimulate the production of stem cells , which are the precursors of all blood_cells , and to trigger their release into the bloodstream , then harvests them from the blood . This process produces as much as 10 times the amount of marrow otherwise obtained . Martelli ' s team began testing the technique early last year at the hospital in Perugia , and results with the first 17 patients are discussed in today ' s report . All of the patients had either acute_myelocytic_leukemia or acute_lymphocytic_leukemia and all were considered terminal . &quot; These patients were really , really sick , with a life_expectancy of weeks or even days , &quot; Martelli said . Each received a transplant from a parent or sibling that was mismatched at three of the eight loci . The graft survived in 16 of the 17 patients . Only two of the patients died from their leukemia , but six died of respiratory infections , one from a fungus infection and one from graft-versus-host disease . Six are still alive , the longest for 21 months . Although that survival rate seems small , Martelli said , it is about the same as was achieved 20 years ago in the first experimental bone_marrow transplants using precisely matched donors . As they did then , however , physicians are learning how to control the infections and other problems that developed in the first grafts , and the survival rate is increasing . Among 18 patients treated since Martelli ' s initial group , only about 30 % have died . American researchers are eager to try the technique , and oncologists at M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston and Children ' s Hospital in St . Petersburg , Fla. , as well as in Los Angeles , are getting ready to recruit their first patients . &quot; What was impressive and exciting was their ability to get this mismatched bone_marrow to work and grow in the recipients without the usual fatal complications that you would see in such a transplant , &quot; said Dr. Carl Lenarsky , director of the bone_marrow transplant program at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles . &quot; We are encouraged by it , and have decided that we will undertake this approach. &quot; Marrow ' Megadoses ' A new technique using large doses of bone_marrow for transplants promises to eliminate the need for precise immunological matching , making much larger_numbers of donors available for victims of leukemia and certain genetic_diseases . 1 ) A hormone is injected into a donor to stimulate production of stem cells , the crucial cells in bone_marrow . 2 ) Five days later , blood is drained from the arm and centrifuged to remove stem and other white_cells . Red cells and other blood components are reinfused into the donor . 3 ) The stem cells are treated to remove undesirable white_cells and injected into the patient . Source : Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
