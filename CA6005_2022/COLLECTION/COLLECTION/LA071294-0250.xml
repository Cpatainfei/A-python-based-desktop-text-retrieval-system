   <HEADLINE> HAITI ORDERS OUT RIGHTS MONITORS ; CARIBBEAN : U.N. AND OAS ARE EXPECTED TO COMPLY AND WITHDRAW OBSERVERS . U.S. AND ALLIES CALL MILITARY REGIME ' S ACTION ' A SERIOUS ESCALATION IN THE CONFLICT. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The military authorities of Haiti , defying the international community once again , Monday ordered the expulsion within 48 hours of all human_rights observers of the United Nations and the Organization of American_States . &quot; The reasons are quite obvious , &quot; Dante Caputo , the chief U.N. official for Haiti , said at U.N. headquarters in New York . &quot; They kill people . They torture people . They rape people . And they don ' t want any witnesses in their country. &quot; He denounced the decree as &quot; outrageous , &quot; &quot; a provocation &quot; and &quot; an insult to the international community. &quot; Later , U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright , reading a statement on behalf of the United States , France , Canada , Venezuela and Argentina , denounced the act_as &quot; a serious escalation of the conflict &quot; and warned that it underscored &quot; the need for quick and decisive action by the international community to end the Haitian crisis. &quot; But , when asked if this meant an invasion , she replied , &quot; There is no point in trying to figure_out whether we will call their bluff. &quot; The five countries , known at the United Nations as &quot; the Friends of Haiti , &quot; have been asked to take a special_interest in the problem . The joint international mission in Haiti is made_up of 64 OAS and 40 U.N. observers . Although subjected_to threats and harassment , the observers have managed in the last few months to send_out a stream of bulletins about the deterioration of human_rights under the military authorities blocking the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . Caputo , a former Argentine foreign_minister , declined to answer when asked if he believed the provocation was enough to justify American intervention to remove the military_leaders of the impoverished Caribbean country . State_Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly also declined to speculate on whether the expulsion has brought the Clinton_Administration closer to mounting a Haiti intervention . But , she said , &quot; we certainly condemn the illegal de_facto regime in Port-au-Prince for . . . its stated intention to expel the . . . human_rights observers from Haiti . . . . Their cynical action , I think , is a clear indication that the human_rights situation in Haiti is deteriorating even further. &quot; U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali met with acting OAS Secretary_General Christopher R . Thomas to work_out a response to the Haitian decree . It was widely assumed that they would decide to comply with the expulsion and remove the observers for their own safety as soon as possible . In October , after a gang of shouting roughnecks on the Port-au-Prince docks prompted President Clinton to order the tank landing ship Harlan County to abandon its attempt to land a contingent of American and Canadian peacekeepers , the United Nations and OAS removed the observers from Haiti as a precaution . But the observers returned early this year and have been monitoring human_rights violations since then . Caputo said Haitian military authorities handed the decree to U.N. officials in Port-au-Prince on Monday morning . The decree , he said , was &quot; signed by the dictator in Haiti , Mr. Jonassaint. &quot; The military installed Supreme Court Judge Emile Jonassaint as provisional president May 11 in an act condemned by the Security_Council and Boutros-Ghali . Caputo said the Jonassaint decree had three provisions : It declared the observers undesirable ; it ordered their expulsion within 48 hours , and it called_on the Haitian army to enforce the order . In Port-au-Prince , mission officials told reporters that the military government had informed them it regarded the mission as illegal and a threat to national security . The officials said they also were told that the Haitians wanted to avoid &quot; an incident or a provocation. &quot; On Friday , the General_Assembly had authorized an extension of U.N. participation in the mission for another year . While doing so , the Assembly condemned the Jonassaint presidency , demanded the departure of the military_leaders and called_for the return of Aristide . The mission in Haiti is the only one that the United Nations ever has mounted in partnership with the OAS , whose membership includes most governments in the Western_Hemisphere . According to reports from Reuters news_agency in Port-au-Prince , a senior government official said the observers would lose their diplomatic status in 48 hours , which would subject them to expulsion as ordinary citizens . Acknowledging that it might be difficult for them to leave because of the sanctions that have ended most flights , the official said , &quot; We can always put them at the airport and give them sleeping bags. &quot; Meanwhile , the Pentagon reported that the amphibious_assault ship Inchon , with 2 # 000 Marines aboard , had reached its destination off the coast of Haiti . U.S. officials insisted that they have ordered the Marines to these waters to prepare to rescue Americans should their lives be threatened . But the buildup has also fed rumors of a possible U.S. invasion . Shelly , of the State_Department , said the Coast Guard picked_up 1 # 740 Haitians over the weekend , down significantly from previous days . Since June 15 , when the Administration resumed interviews of Haitians fleeing by sea , 19 # 200 have been picked_up . Shelly said there still is a possibility that Panama might provide a haven . &quot; But in terms of the immediate time frame , I think . . . the situation is reflected by . . . the decision of President ( Guillermo ) Endara , &quot; she said . Endara , after first pledging to take_in 10 # 000 Haitians , changed his mind last week . President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares , who will succeed Endara Sept . 1 , has implied that he would accept some refugees . Times staff writer Norman Kempster contributed to this report .</TEXT>
