   <TEXT> * In response to &quot; Ames Gets Life ; Admits Betraying Double_Agents , &quot; April 29 : My entire life I have strongly opposed both the death_penalty and the use of physical torture by authorities against prisoners ( as in Singapore ) . I have always felt that the use of these methods could never be justified under color of government authority . However , I have been closely following the Aldrich Ames spying case : the betrayal of our country , the betrayal of our agents to torture and death , the millions of payoff dollars wasted on a yuppie lifestyle , and , most galling , the complete lack of remorse by the guilty couple . Now , I realize that I was wrong ; capital_punishment occasionally is the only reasonable recourse . JERRY SWOVELIN Rancho La Costa * Why should we be so surprised that our agents betrayed their agents when that ' s exactly what we were asking them to do ? Sounds like a classic case of NIMBY -- nyet in my back yard . ELYSE VERSE Los Angeles</TEXT>
