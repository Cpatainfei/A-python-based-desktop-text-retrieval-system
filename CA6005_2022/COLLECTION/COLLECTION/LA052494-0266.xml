   <HEADLINE> COLOSIO SLAYING SUSPECT ' S KIN FLEE TO U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Saying they fear for their lives in Mexico , six relatives of the man accused of assassinating Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio have sought political asylum here after crossing the border illegally and surrendering to U.S. authorities . The mother of Mario Aburto Martinez , the factory_worker who is charged with killing Colosio two months ago , and five other relatives took a taxi to the border Sunday afternoon from their working-class Tijuana neighborhood . They climbed the fence near the Tijuana River levee , a crossing often used by illegal immigrants , and turned themselves over to Border_Patrol agents a_few hundred yards from the international line . The six then requested asylum in the United States , a Border_Patrol spokeswoman said . All six were released on_their_own recognizance late Monday and were en route to San Pedro to unite with family members , said Peter Schey , a Los Angeles human_rights activist and their attorney . They are attempting to remain in the United States on humanitarian grounds . Aburto ' s relatives said they fled Tijuana after having been followed , threatened and otherwise menaced since the assassination two months ago . &quot; They stated they had been threatened and harassed , &quot; said Border_Patrol spokeswoman Ann Summers in San Diego , adding that the Aburtos said a black van was tailing them Sunday . &quot; They fear remaining in Mexico. &quot; The incident presents a delicate issue for the U.S. and Mexican governments . Despite longtime human_rights problems south of the border , Mexicans rarely seek or receive political asylum in the United States -- in contrast to refugees from Guatemala , China and other nations . The Aburtos ' dramatic flight from Mexico puts U.S. immigration officials in the awkward position of being forced to judge whether Mexico can protect the accused assassin ' s family , injecting the United States into the explosive case . The Colosio case remains mired in mystery and conspiracy theories implicating politicians and drug cartels . A human_rights lawyer in Los Angeles , where the accused assassin ' s father and brothers live , said Monday that the family has been alarmed by several attempted break-ins at their home during the past two weeks . The April slaying of Tijuana ' s police_chief -- which officials say could be connected to the chief ' s role in the assassination investigation -- also frightened the family , said Schey , who is associated with the Center for Human_Rights and Constitutional Law . The imprisoned Aburto has also expressed concern about his family ' s safety , Schey said . &quot; Mario has indicated that , for reasons that he has not made clear , he does not think the family is safe in Mexico , &quot; said Schey , who has been advising Aburto ' s relatives in Los Angeles . &quot; The facts surrounding the case are extremely murky . . . . I think their fear is of violence by armed individuals and groups seemingly outside of the control of the government . They have no confidence that the Mexican government is in a position to protect them. &quot; Mexican government officials at the consulates in San Diego and Los Angeles did not return phone_calls seeking comment . A representative of the San Diego consulate requested an interview with the Aburtos on Monday afternoon , but Schey said he asked Immigration and Naturalization Service officials to deny the request until he can meet with his clients . Those arrested Sunday were Aburto ' s mother , Maria Luisa Martinez , 45 ; Aburto ' s brother , Jose Luis , 20 , his 19-year-old wife , Adelia , and their 1-year-old son , Luis ; and the accused assassin ' s two sisters , 16-year-old Elisabeth and 10-year-old Carina . They were to be released into their lawyers ' custody while the asylum application makes its way through a backlogged system . Cases can linger for more_than a year without disposition , immigration officials said Monday . Describing the INS as very cooperative , Schey said he may also try to seek temporary residence on humanitarian grounds . Aburto is being held_in a high-security prison near Mexico_City along with three alleged accomplices -- guards in a crowd-control team provided by Colosio ' s political_party for the fateful rally . Aburto denies any connection to those suspects , however , and Mexican authorities have not answered many questions about the assassination , including those involving the motive and who masterminded the plot . Aburto first implied that he had confederates but then insisted that he had acted alone , raising speculation that he knows more_than he has disclosed . After the March 23 assassination , Aburto ' s mother took refuge for several days with Catholic nuns in Tijuana before returning to her small brick house in the impoverished Colonia Buenos Aires neighborhood . Neighbors in the area told reporters last month that she did not seem particularly worried or upset . Nonetheless , Martinez has grown increasingly fearful because of attempted break-ins that occurred at night while the family was sleeping , Schey said . &quot; There have been unidentified cars circling the house , &quot; Schey said . &quot; My understanding is that there have been threats. &quot; And the accused assassin ' s father and two brothers in San Pedro , who contend that the Mexican government has made Aburto a scapegoat , claim to have been harassed north of the border . Aburto ' s brother , Rafael , told The Times last week that he was nearly run_off the Harbor Freeway and that his brother-in-law ' s car was shot at while parked . &quot; I know something ' s going_to happen to me , &quot; Rafael Aburto told The Times . &quot; I ' m not scared for myself . I ' m scared for my family . . . . The real assassins are behind this . They don ' t want us speaking out. &quot;</TEXT>
