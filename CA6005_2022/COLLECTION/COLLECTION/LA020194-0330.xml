   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEW ; THE DIAMOND EXPOSE AS BIG AS THE RITZ</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Crucially scheduled to air two weeks before Valentine ' s Day -- and just in time for all those thinking_of buying their loved one a precious_stone -- &quot; Frontline ' s &quot; startling report , &quot; The Diamond Empire &quot; ( at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15 ; 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24 ) should be a red flag for the potential diamond consumer . And for those who ' ve already thrown down hard-earned cash for what may be the world ' s most overpriced commodity , prepare to get very angry . * Diamonds , according to the report and seconded by several investigative journalists such_as Edward Jay Epstein , are not only not rare , they are common minerals in regions of at least three continents . They have been marketed as rare , priced as such and controlled by one of history ' s most successful monopoly cartels : De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd . &quot; The Diamond Empire &quot; describes what is essentially the last of the robber-baron operations , buying_up competitors , swaying governments , even allegedly using terror tactics to ensure a lock on the diamond industry . The players here range from the Oppenheimer family of South_Africa , which controls De Beers , and Rhodesia founder Cecil Rhodes , to Hitler , Marilyn ( &quot; Diamonds Are a Girl ' s Best_Friend &quot; ) Monroe and , above all , a consuming public that has been duped for years to believe that diamonds are so precious that they are worth the cost . One dealer , for example , displays a $ 90 ring that contains a diamond actually worth $ 1 . * Epstein suggests that the long-held monopoly , which even extended during the Cold_War to the Soviet_Union ' s huge diamond supply , may be near an end if the U.S._government goes_after De Beers the way it went_after Panamanian Gen . Manuel Noriega . Like Noriega ' s illegal drug business , De Beers could be prosecuted here for violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act . Even more ominously for a company so powerful that it can dictate policy in some African regimes , Russia ' s need for hard currency could force it to flood the world market with its diamonds . It might kill the cartel , and the marketing myth . That is , if &quot; Frontline &quot; doesn ' t do_it first .</TEXT>
