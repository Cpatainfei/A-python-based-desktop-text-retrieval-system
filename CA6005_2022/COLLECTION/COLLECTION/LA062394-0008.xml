   <HEADLINE> EXOTIC FRUIT ; THE FRUITS OF HOME ; MEMORIES : AMERICANS MAY CRAVE THE STRAWBERRIES AND PEACHES OF SUMMER , BUT PEOPLE FROM TROPICAL COUNTRIES YEARN FOR CHERIMOYAS , TAMARINDOS AND THE SPIKY FRUIT CALLED DURIAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Sumptuous baskets of fruit : manga-espada , carlota , custard_apple , and itiuba , manga-rosa , sapotes , sapodillas , hog_plums , Malay apples , cashew fruit , Surinam_cherries , jambos , Chinese_gooseberries , 11 types of banana , and slices of pineapple and watermelon . &quot; -- Jorge Amado , &quot; The War of the Saints &quot; My friend Nancy Zubiri says that if she were asked to choose three foods before dying , one of them would be a mango . But it would n ' t be just any mango . Sweet Mexican mangoes are common in Los Angeles , but you cannot find the dozen or so varieties that abound_in tropical climates . There is no place in Southern California where you can walk down streets lined with mango_trees , where the fruit is so abundant that its smell permeates the air as it lies rotting on the ground because there ' s just too_much to go_around . And , says Zubiri , mangoes in Southern California just don ' t taste like the ones in her native Peru . Nor like the ones in Brazil , says Lea Beatriz Zaguri . &quot; We had so many types of mangoes , &quot; she says wistfully , reminiscing about a variety called the Carlotinha , the &quot; little Carlota , &quot; which is &quot; very , very small , very , very sweet and very , very juicy. &quot; In the Philippines , says Fay Cabanada , the mangoes grown in her family ' s mango plantation were also &quot; very , very juicy , but with little fiber , elongated and yellow , &quot; but try as she might , she just can ' t get them to grow the same way here . * We all yearn for the foods we grew_up with : Americans have a yen for freshly baked apple_pie , Fourth_of_July corn on the cob , hamburgers on the grill . For those who grew_up in other lands , the longing is often for those fruits that may have been taken_for granted because of their abundance , but maddeningly enough , are difficult to find -- if at all -- in this country where everything else seems to be available . &quot; Strawberries , raspberries , nectarines and cherries , those were exotic to me when I was growing_up , &quot; says Tuni Szpiro , a Colombian who has lived_in Los Angeles for eleven years . &quot; But now , do you know what I ' d like the most ? A jugo de lulo ( lulo shake ) , just blended , with all that green foam , like a green cappuccino . Ay , that would be heaven. &quot; But the tart lulo , greenish-yellow outside , pulpy green inside and used mostly for milk or water shakes , is impossible to find fresh in Los Angeles . It is also next to impossible to find the Javanese salak or snakeskin fruit , the Philippine lanzone , the Thai rambutan , or the Brazilian caju &quot; There were so many fruits over there , &quot; says Ivan Tekawy , a Java native who runs Bali Place , a restaurant in West L.A. &quot; Now I can ' t remember them all anymore. &quot; * In an effort not to forget , people from other countries flock to ethnic markets and farmers markets throughout the area , sometimes finding fruits they thought they would never see again , but which , seemingly by some miracle , have appeared on the stands_for one day . More and more , fruits from other lands are showing_up in regular markets -- cherimoya , passion_fruit , pepino and feijoa , for instance . And when people don ' t find the real_thing , there are always frozen and canned fruits , which are imported liberally because they are free from insect infestation . But alas , they never taste quite as good . The alternatives are better than none , but they are still a poor substitute for people like Steven Lam ; he cherishes memories of his grandmother giving him fresh fruit after his daily afternoon naps in the sweltering heat of Vietnam . Fruit , says 18-year-old Lam , a recent graduate of Santa Monica High_School , is one of the reasons he goes_back to Vietnam . &quot; The first thing I eat when I get home is fruit , &quot; he says . &quot; I love fruit . Every time I go_back , I get_off the plane and my grandparents have bought me a basket of litchi. &quot; Those are fresh litchi , of course , not the canned variety we ' re used to getting_at most Chinese restaurants . Real litchi has a pink thin shell that cracks easily to expose the whitish , grape-like fruit inside . It is sometimes available in Los Angeles in Asian markets , but its cousin , the smaller longan , almost never is . * &quot; We had a longan tree in our back yard ( in Vietnam ) , &quot; he says . &quot; Actually , it wasn ' t our tree , it was the neighbor ' s , but the branches went_over so we picked them , &quot; he adds , laughing . &quot; The skin is brown , and you don ' t have to peel it , you just press it , and the fruit pops_out and you suck it . My parents get_it frozen in Little Saigon , but it ' s nowhere compared to the fresh ones. &quot; Fortunately for Lam , his favorite fruit , the notorious durian , is found in Southern California . But one has to hurry to the Thai markets when a durian shipment comes_in ; they often sell_out in a day , despite the fact that the big , spiky fruit -- expensive in its native habitat -- is outrageous here , costing up_to $ 40 apiece . Considered a delicacy in most Southeast Asian_countries , durian is_best known for its extremely pungent smell , so strong and -- for many people -- so offensive that in many Asian_countries it is not allowed on trains and planes or in posh hotel_rooms . But the smell is not a deterrent to its advocates , who swear by its custardy texture and peculiar taste , a mixture of sweet vanilla and cooked onions . The heavy fruit , which is found throughout Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines , grows in a tree similar to the elm and falls to the ground when ripe . This could be a problem for potential passers-by , who could get knocked unconscious by the force of a six-pound durian falling on their heads . Fortunately , says Lam , &quot; My parents say durian falls only at night , so they don ' t hurt anyone when they fall. &quot; Lam , of course , is a staunch durian fan whose mother regularly makes durian shakes for dinner ( made with frozen durian pieces and milk ) and who is amused when his American friends complain about the durian smell ( &quot; What is that ? &quot; they ask disgustedly when the Lam family buys fresh durian and loads it in the car ) . * Paula Vaughn ' s husband wasn ' t so charitable . &quot; The first time I bought fresh durian here and took it home , my husband freaked_out , &quot; says the Thailand native who now works in Los Angeles ' Bangluck Market . &quot; He said it smelled like someone had died. &quot; Durian used to be Vaughn ' s favorite fruit , but now she finds it &quot; too strong. &quot; Instead , she longs for fresh rambutan , the litchi-tasting fruit that on the outside looks_like a hairy flower . &quot; Last time I went_to Thailand , I bought about four pounds and ate them in one day , &quot; recalls Vaughn with a smile . Here she settles for the canned rambutan , sold in virtually all Asian markets , and as far as fresh fruit goes , she indulges in her other passion : green mango . When I tell her that in Colombia green , tart mangoes are eaten with salt , she brightens up . In Thailand , she explains , green mango is eaten with different dips . One is a mixture of sugar , salt and red chile . The other , her favorite , is a mixture of fish sauce , chile , sugar , red_onion and dried shrimp . For a minute I think I ' ve misunderstood . Fish sauce and sugar ? It sounds pretty awful . &quot; No , no , &quot; she says . &quot; Let me bring you some. &quot; Vaughn requests the dips from the little kitchen alongside the market , where she works as head cashier , and in a_few minutes I have a plate full of sliced green mango and the two dips . I try it tentatively . They ' re hot . They ' re delicious . They ' re even better than with just salt -- and I tell her so . * She smiles modestly . &quot; We eat the green guava slices with the same dips , &quot; she explains . &quot; In Thailand , there are always little carts in the street that sell fruit and have the dips. &quot; Little fruit-vending carts , it seems , are the most common of sights in all tropical countries , regardless of the latitude . In Colombia , that ' s also where Tuni Szpiro would get her coconuts and green mangoes . &quot; Coconuts here , &quot; she states , &quot; don ' t taste like coconuts . The coconuts they sell in the streets back home , those are real coconuts ! &quot; But when she gets a craving for green mango , something that happened periodically during her pregnancy , she rushes to a local Thai market . Szpiro has , in fact , scouted all_the locations in the L.A. area where tropical fruits might be available , and she regularly finds one thing or another . &quot; When I first moved here , there were no fruits , but in the past three to five years , I ' ve found guavas , feijoas ( also known as pineapple_guavas ) , cherimoyas and even guanabanas . &quot; * The truth is , says Karen Caplan , president of Frieda ' s Inc. , a company that imports exotic fruit , many of those fruits that seem readily available only now have been around for more_than 20 years . Frieda ' s supplies major supermarkets with horned melon , feijoa , passion_fruit , Asian pears and cherimoyas , among a huge selection of fruits , most of them imported from New Zealand . One fruit she does not stock , however , is the guanabana , or soursop , a large cousin of the cherimoya , with similar texture and seeds , but with a much tarter flavor . This makes_it a candidate for water- or milk-based shakes , or vitaminas , as they are known in Brazil . They ' re jugos ( juices ) in Colombia , batidos in Cuba or simply licuados throughout most Latin_American countries . &quot; In Colombia , jugos are an obligation , &quot; says Szpiro . &quot; Every day , you have fresh jugos , at all hours . Jugo de lulo , maracuya ( passion_fruit ) , mora ( a cousin of the blackberry ) . All day long , that blender goes vroom , vroom ! &quot; Although Szpiro can readily find her favorite jugo fruits , passion_fruit and tamarillo , she never makes jugos with them . At $ 1 a pop for each tiny maracuya , a glass of juice is just too expensive . Instead , she eats them alone -- they ' re sweeter here than in Colombia , she says -- and she looks_for her juices in other places . &quot; What I ' ve noticed is that in many of those smoothie stands at the beach or in the malls , they make our same jugos , only the fruits are different . I always ask them not to put_in yogurt or ice_cream , just milk or water , and they ' re delicious. &quot; Lea Beatriz Zaguri , who grew_up in Brazil drinking vitaminas -- so called because they ' re rich_in vitamins -- also finds that smoothies are a good substitute . * &quot; Here every morning I make shakes with banana and milk , pineapple or papaya , &quot; she says . It ' s her way of eating fruit at least once a day . &quot; Of course , &quot; she adds , &quot; In Rio we eat fruit all_the time . On every corner there ' s a stand to make shakes , and all_the fruits are placed against the wall . You pick your fruit and they make your vitamina . &quot; Her favorite is an avocado ( abacate ) smoothie , made with milk and sugar . An unlikely combination for many palates . &quot; The first time I went_to Mexico I asked_for an abacate shake with sugar and they said ' Are you crazy ? ' &quot; Her request is less likely to get laughed_at in Los Angeles , where many Asian -- especially Indonesian -- restaurants serve avocado smoothies , mixed with coconut and sometimes jackfruit . In the Philippines , halfway across the globe from Zaguri ' s birthplace , Fay Cabanada also grew_up on jackfruit and many of the same fruits as Zaguri , sometimes even calling them by the same name : the little siriguelas , which grow in very hot areas and must be eaten straight from the tree almost the minute they ripen ; the anonas , which in Brazil is called fruta de conde , count ' s fruit , and is similar to a cherimoya but has spiky skin ; and the many types of mangoes and bananas . While most people are content looking in_stores for their favorite fruits , Cabanada has gone a step beyond : She grows fruit in her own back yard . &quot; I try to look_for fruits around here that are similar to the ones back home , &quot; she says . &quot; I have banana_trees at my house . . . lemon_trees , Santa Rosa plums , the big grapefruit we call pomelo and Japanese_persimmon , although that isn ' t from home. &quot; Her newly planted cherimoyas are not from home either , surprisingly enough . Cabanada discovered them in the States and eats them as a substitute for the similar-tasting apis , a cross between the sweetness of the cherimoya and the sourness of the sour-sop . * Some fruits , however , have no substitute . &quot; We have a fruit called lanzone , which grows in clusters . The skin is a bit thicker than a grape , and inside it ' s white and translucent , like a small plum , &quot; she explains . &quot; I haven ' t even seen them preserved here. &quot; There ' s really nothing much you can do when you ' re yearning for a fruit that can ' t be found , except yearn some more or forget about it . &quot; I just don ' t long for fruits here very much , &quot; says Zaguri . &quot; During the summer I do , but even then , not like back home . Maybe it ' s because life and fruits are more sensual there. &quot; In &quot; The War of the Saints , &quot; Brazilian novelist Jorge Amado writes_about the &quot; intoxicating aroma of fruit . . . the smell of ripe jackfruit. &quot; Zaguri ' s recollection of that same smell is similar : &quot; There ' s a big park in Rio near the city , with a lot of plants and water , and you find jaca , jackfruit , all along the way , &quot; she says . &quot; And when it falls to the ground , it releases this incredible smell , this strong , wonderful smell. &quot; It ' s the smell of home . * This isn ' t the sort of flan most of us are familiar_with -- more a mousse than a caramelized custard . But it is delicious . There are two ways to make the dessert : frozen so it takes_on the consistency of an Italian semifreddo and makes a wonderfully cool summer treat , especially with the creme Anglaise , or set_in the refrigerator where it becomes a light , mousse-like-dessert . Fresh or prepared mango pulp can be used . If you use fresh , peel the mango , puree it in a food_processor or blender , then strain the puree . If you find mango pulp in bottles ( at many supermarkets and Latino grocers ) , simply puree the pulp in a food_processor or blender ; you don ' t need to strain it . MANGO &quot; FLAN &quot; 1 / 2 cup boiling water 1 1 / 2 tablespoons unflavored gelatin 2 egg_whites 1 / 2 cup sugar 1 1 / 2 cups pureed mango pulp 1 / 2 cup heavy whipping_cream Creme Anglaise , optional Pour boiling water over gelatin in bowl and let dissolve . Set_aside . Place egg_whites in mixing bowl and beat until firm . Continue to beat , gradually adding sugar . Beat to soft peaks . Stir together pureed mango , cream and dissolved gelatin in bowl until well blended . Gently fold in sweetened egg_whites . If flan is to set_in refrigerator , place mixture in 1 ( 4-cup ) souffle mold . Refrigerate several hours . Serve with Creme Anglaise . If flan is to freeze in freezer , place mixture in 1 ( 9-inch ) loaf pan . Freeze several hours . Serve with Creme Anglaise . Makes 8 servings .

Creme Anglaise 1 1 / 2 cups milk 1 / 2 vanilla_bean 3 egg yolks 1 / 2 cup sugar Heat milk and vanilla_bean in heavy-bottomed saucepan just to boiling point . While milk heats , whisk egg_yolks and sugar in bowl until light and fluffy . Add small amount of hot milk mixture to yolk mixture and whisk thoroughly . Slowly pour egg mixture into hot milk , whisking constantly . Heat over low heat until mixture coats back of spoon . Do not allow mixture to boil . Strain and chill . Makes about 2 cups .

Note : Although many recipes call_for uncooked eggs , the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs . Commercial egg substitutes that have been pasturized may be used in place of raw eggs in certain circumstances . Check egg substitute package for applications . * This tasty and simple dish is a Caribbean staple that can be eaten as a dessert or as part of a main meal . The combination of salty cheese and sweet ripe plantain is delicious . ABORRAJADOS 4 ripe plantains Oil 1 / 4 pound cotija cheese or other white salty cheese 2 eggs , beaten 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 / 2 teaspoon salt 4 tablespoons flour Guava paste , optional Peel plantains and slice diagonally . Place oil , 1 / 4 inch up sides , in large saute pan and heat . Add plantain slices and fry until golden . Remove plantains and pound gently between pieces of wax_paper to flatten . Cut cheese into pieces small enough to fit on top of plantain slices . Set_aside . Mix eggs with baking soda , salt and 2 tablespoons flour in bowl to make batter . Set_aside . Heat oil for frying in large saute pan or deep-fryer . Make &quot; sandwich &quot; by placing slice of cheese on top of 1 plantain . Smear cheese with guava paste and top with second plantain . Press sandwich together to seal . Sprinkle with flour , dip in batter and fry in oil until golden . Repeat with remaining plantain slices and cheese . Makes about 20 sandwiches . Each sandwich contains about : 95 calories ; 130 mg sodium ; 26 mg cholesterol ; 5 grams fat ; 13 grams carbohydrates ; 2 grams protein ; 0.18 gram fiber . * If you can ' t find fresh passion_fruit , you can use bottled or frozen pulp . You can even substitute other fruits , such_as lulo , curuba or mango pulp . No matter what , you should get a beautifully colored , light and tasty dessert . To get the pulp out of fresh passion_fruits , simply open the hard shells and scoop_out the pulp . PASSION_FRUIT MOUSSE 3 / 4 cup passion_fruit pulp ( equivalent_to about 10 passion_fruits ) 1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin 2 tablespoons cold water 1 / 2 cup boiling water 6 egg_whites 1 cup sugar Creme Anglaise , optional Strain and discard seeds from passion_fruit pulp . Set_aside . Dissolve gelatin in cold water in bowl . Add boiling water and stir until gelatin is totally dissolved , with no lumps . Beat egg_whites in separate bowl to soft peaks . Continuing to beat , gradually add sugar , then fruit pulp . When ingredients are incorporated , gently fold in dissolved gelatin . Place mixture in 6 lightly greased 3 / 4-cup souffle molds . Let stand_in cool place until firm . Unmold and serve with Creme Anglaise . Makes 6 servings . Each serving , without Creme Anglaise , contains about : 178 calories ; 59 mg sodium ; trace cholesterol ; trace fat ; 41 grams carbohydrates ; 5 grams protein ; 3.28 grams fiber .

Commercial egg substitutes that have been pasturized may be used in place of raw eggs in certain circumstances . Check egg substitute package for applications . * Coconut rice is a wonderful alternative to plain rice and is commonly used in the Caribbean to accompany seafood dishes . It is also typical in Thailand and other Southeast Asian_countries . Sugar can be added according to taste and depending_on whether the rice will be eaten alone or with other foods . The raisins can be omitted . COCONUT RICE ( Arroz Con Coco ) 1 cup rice Water 1 1 / 4 cup coconut_milk 1 / 2 tablespoon sugar 1 / 2 teaspoon salt 1 / 4 cup raisins In bowl soak rice in water to cover 2 hours . Drain . Place rice , coconut_milk , sugar , salt and raisins in large saucepan . Stir to combine . Bring mixture to boil . Lower heat , cover and simmer 15 to 20 minutes . Stir rice halfway through cooking . Makes 6 servings . Each serving contains about : 252 calories ; 206 mg sodium ; trace cholesterol ; 12 grams fat ; 34 grams carbohydrates ; 3 grams protein ; 1.49 grams fiber . * In tropical countries , especially during the summer , shakes are everyday refreshments . Milk- or water-based , they ' re easy to make and can be done with virtually any fruit . You can use frozen tropical fruit pulp ( lulo , passion_fruit , guava , tamarillo , guanabana , tamarind ) or fresh fruit such_as pineapple , papaya , mango , cantaloupe or strawberries mashed into pulp . The amount of sugar you add will depend_on the natural sweetness of the fruit you use . Always taste before adding sugar .
