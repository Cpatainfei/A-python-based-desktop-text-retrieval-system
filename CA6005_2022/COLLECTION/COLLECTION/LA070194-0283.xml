   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; WASTE SHIPMENTS NEAR LANCASTER BEGIN TODAY ; ENVIRONMENT : UP TO 150 TONS PER DAY WILL BE TRUCKED IN FROM EL CAJON . BIDS TO HALT THE PROJECT HAVE FAILED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Trucks full of garbage from the city of El Cajon will begin arriving in the Lancaster area today , despite repeated efforts by local environmentalists and other residents to keep them from coming . Universal Refuse Removal , based in El Cajon , said it will initially haul as much as 150 tons of commercial waste a day to a privately owned landfill just outside the Lancaster city_limits . By mid-July , when residential waste is also transported , the daily amount could reach 300 tons . &quot; We ' re very encouraged , &quot; said Rex Buck , general_manager for Universal Refuse Removal . &quot; It ' s a good_deal for the citizens of El Cajon. &quot; On Thursday , San Diego Superior_Court Judge William J . Howatt took under submission a request for an immediate stay and court_order to prevent El Cajon from dumping its trash in Lancaster , but a decision could not come_in time to stop at least the start of the dumping . Lyle Talbot , an Antelope Valley environmental activist , said Thursday that he is not optimistic the judge will rule_in favor of the request . &quot; I feel we will not win , &quot; said Talbot . &quot; Our next administrative relief would be to go_to the state Regional Water Quality_Control Board. &quot; Talbot said the water agency would be asked to review the permit it issued to Waste Management , the owner of the Lancaster landfill and also the parent company of Universal Refuse Removal . Opponents of the dumping plan already failed in an attempt to persuade the El Cajon City_Council to derail it . Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich was also unsuccessful in his bid to get the board to prohibit the dumping of out-of-county garbage in the Antelope Valley . Meanwhile , Buck said El Cajon residents will benefit from the long-distance disposal of their waste . &quot; It ' s in the best interest of the citizens of El Cajon , &quot; he said . &quot; The disposal rate at the San Diego County-run landfill has gone_up every year for the past five years . This gives the citizens of El Cajon some relief. &quot; Despite the 320-mile round-trip trek the trash trucks will make six days a week to bring El Cajon ' s trash to Lancaster , residents of the San Diego area city will see their disposal rate drop $ 1 per month to $ 13.16. Universal Refuse trash trucks , measuring 59 feet in_length and with 18-ton capacities , will make as_many as 12 round_trips each day from El Cajon to Lancaster , said Buck . The round-trip distance is 320 miles . Buck said virtually all_of El Cajon ' s residential , commercial and industrial waste -- about 75 # 000 tons annually -- will be disposed_of in Lancaster .</TEXT>
