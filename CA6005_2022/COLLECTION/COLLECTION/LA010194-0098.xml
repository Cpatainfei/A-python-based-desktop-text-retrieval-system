   <HEADLINE> HUFFMAN-TITAN CASE ENTERS NEW ARENA ; JURISPRUDENCE : BOTH SIDES OFFERING NUMEROUS DEPOSITIONS TO SUPPORT ARGUMENTS IN FORMER COACH ' S WRONGFUL TERMINATION SUIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Jim Huffman ' s wrongful termination suit against Cal State Fullerton goes_to trial , the school will argue he was fired as Titan women ' s volleyball coach because he didn ' t do his job very well . But Huffman ' s attorneys will rely heavily on depositions that are seen as supporting their contention that he was terminated simply because some administrators considered him a pain_in_the_neck . The trial is scheduled to begin Monday in Orange County Superior_Court . The $ 1.2-million suit alleges Huffman was fired March 23 , 1992 , in retaliation &quot; because he spoke out about illegalities in the CSUF athletic department and initiated successful legal_proceedings , which resulted in negative publicity to the school and its administrators. &quot; The firing came one working_day after a judge signed a preliminary injunction blocking the school ' s attempt to drop volleyball Jan . 28 , 1992 . Huffman and his players had filed suit alleging the move violated state sex discrimination laws . Fullerton permanently reinstated volleyball as part of a settlement the following May , but Huffman , whose teams were 25-80 during his three years as coach , was not rehired . Kevin Gerry , state deputy attorney_general who is representing the school , said in an interview the decision to fire Huffman was made in December , 1991 , before Huffman and the team filed the suit . Gerry listed the team ' s poor performance , both on the court and in the classroom , minor NCAA violations during Huffman ' s tenure and Huffman ' s substandard fund-raising as primary reasons Huffman ' s contract was not renewed . Huffman ' s attorneys will contend evidence taken_in depositions shows otherwise . In one , former Fullerton Associate Athletic Director Steve DiTolla said that at a March 20 , 1992 , meeting , Jack Bedell , the university ' s associate vice_president for academic affairs , &quot; made a recommendation that we terminate Jim immediately . And the termination was based upon the months of trouble that were caused by Jim. &quot; Asked to recall the exact words Bedell used , DiTolla said : &quot; The gist was something along the lines of , ' We need to get_rid_of that so and so as quickly as possible. ' &quot; Bill Shumard , Titan athletic director , and Maryalyce Jeremiah , Titan associate athletic director , also were at that meeting but claim in depositions that they &quot; didn ' t remember &quot; Bedell making such a statement . &quot; Of the four people at that meeting , DiTolla is the only one who says anything at all like that took_place , &quot; Gerry said . &quot; Ironically , DiTolla is also a former Cal State Fullerton employee whose appointment was not renewed by Shumard. &quot; In his deposition , Bedell claimed that &quot; nobody ever in my presence , including myself , has ever expressed what I would consider anger about Mr. Huffman. &quot; But asked what he thought_of the decision to terminate Huffman at that time , Bedell said : &quot; It was stupid . . . I thought the timing sucked , and that it could make the university look bad. &quot; Shumard said in depositions that the volleyball team ' s poor cumulative grade-point average ( 1.99 ) contributed to Huffman ' s firing . Jared Huffman , Jim ' s brother and San Francisco-based attorney , said fall semester grades weren ' t calculated until late December or early January of that school_year , after the school says the decision was made . &quot; Isn ' t it true that you didn ' t know about this 1.99 team GPA until Jan . 29 , 1992 ? &quot; Huffman asked Shumard in his deposition . Replied Shumard : &quot; That could have been . That could have been. &quot; Shumard went_on to say that study hall reports and regular academic checks of volleyball_players during the fall of 1991 had showed unsatisfactory progress . &quot; The actual GPA was not available until after the decision regarding Huffman had been made , &quot; Gerry said , &quot; but there is a good amount of academic information available to both Shumard and Jeremiah during the course of that fall semester. &quot; The last of Huffman ' s three one-year contracts officially expired Dec . 31 , 1991 , but Huffman continued working_through January under the assumption that , like the two previous years , his contract would be renewed in the spring . Huffman ' s suit alleges that , shortly before the announcement the program was being dropped , Shumard helped Huffman secure a long-term lease through a CSUF program that obtains donated or leased cars for coaches and chose Huffman as the &quot; coaches representative &quot; for an athletic department fund-raiser in May , 1992 . &quot; Why send him to the NCAA ( volleyball ) Final Four in December to recruit and network , why let him recruit in January , schedule club and recreational volleyball activities for the rest of the year , why do all these things if you ' re going to fire him ? &quot; Jared Huffman said . &quot; The key point is not a word was mentioned to anyone about firing Jim Huffman until March 20 , the day the court granted the preliminary injunction . There ' s not a single thing in writing to support their claim that they made the decision to terminate in the fall of 1991. &quot; But Gerry says the school determined at that time it would not offer Huffman a new contract , then delayed any announcement after deciding in late December to drop volleyball . It took about a month for that move to be approved , and Gerry said the school retained Huffman in an effort to help preserve his reputation and make_it easier for him to find another coaching_job . &quot; As a courtesy to the coach , his non-renewal was explained that since the program was being terminated , we don ' t have a position for you , &quot; Gerry said . &quot; That would help the plaintiff move_on in his career , land another job without having to explain a ( firing ) . They wanted to handle it so the coach and university would come_out in a positive light. &quot; But Gerry said those intentions went awry when Huffman filed suit and won reinstatement of the volleyball team . The March 20 injunction did not require Fullerton to retain the coach . The following Monday , Huffman was fired . &quot; Then , when they realized they would have a wrongful termination suit , they came_up with all these reasons , &quot; Jared Huffman said . Jared Huffman also claims the California State University system tried to cover_up potentially damaging evidence . While representing the National Organization for Women in its recent gender equity suit against the CSU system , Huffman received a copy of a Feb . 12 , 1993 , memo from Anne Padilla , assistant director of governmental affairs for the CSU Board of Trustees , to Scott Plotkin , director of governmental affairs , regarding gender equity . But one paragraph of the memo was whited out . Huffman asked the court to order the defense to produce the original document , which Huffman received Dec . 24 . The restored paragraph referred to a discussion between Padilla and Catherine Wynne , a Fullerton campus attorney , concerning the Fullerton situation . The paragraph read , in part : &quot; Catherine also said that we were very vulnerable on this court case , mostly because of the way the coach was fired . Catherine sees the issues as separable ; the firing of the volleyball coach was justifiable because of the team ' s losing record . The abolishment of the volleyball team , however , left us open_to the gender equity complaint . The fact that the team was cut before the coach was fired tied the two cases together and muddled the issue . We reinstated the team , but did not rehire the coach. &quot; Said Jared Huffman : &quot; They blotted it out because they knew it was damaging. &quot; Said Gerry : &quot; I respect their opinion and their right to make ( this document ) an issue , but in no way was there retaliation on account of Huffman having expressed his opinion regarding gender equity . From Cal State Fullerton ' s perspective , this is a job-performance decision not to renew the appointment of a temporary , part-time employee. &quot; In addition to $ 1.2 million in_general and special damages , Huffman is seeking punitive damages and attorneys fees , which have risen above $ 100 # 000 . Bedell , Shumard , CSUF President Milton Gordon , CSU Chancellor Barry Munitz and the CSU Board of Trustees are listed as defendants . Jared Huffman said he made an offer this past fall to settle the case for &quot; less than $ 500 # 000. &quot; The defense , he said , countered with an offer &quot; that was frankly an insult. &quot;</TEXT>
