   <HEADLINE> SPONTANEOUS MEALS ; PANTRY RAID</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A pantry is a very personal thing . While daily marketing may provide the basics for most meals , it is the pantry that provides the style . The fishmonger sells you salmon , but your pantry is what makes the fish fit your taste . Dipped in Moroccan spices and broiled ? Steamed with black_beans and soy_sauce ? Surrounded by a spicy tomato_sauce ? To paraphrase Brillat-Savarin : Tell me what is in your pantry and I ' ll tell you who you are . In my pantry , for example , you won ' t find a lot of exotic spice blends ; if I want blends , I ' ve got plenty of spices on_hand to make my own . You won ' t find sun-dried tomatoes ; to me they taste like rancid oil . And while I like fish sauce in other people ' s cooking , it ' s not yet part of my culinary lexicon . The fact that I don ' t have those things in my pantry does not in any way mean that they aren ' t worth having . It ' s just that they don ' t fit my cooking . My pantry is where I keep the ingredients to cook the things that please me . It ' s also the place I turn_to when I ' m caught off_guard . Friends drop_by without warning ? I ' ve got this great little tuna spread I can put_together in five minutes using nothing but the basics I keep_on hand . Need a quick dinner ? A mouth-filling plate of spaghetti with anchovies and bread crumbs can be ready in the time it takes_to boil water . Snacks , appetizers , desserts . . . they ' re all_in there , just waiting for me to call . * When I moved_into an older house , one of the key selling points for me was that it had a real , honest-to-god pantry ( which gives you some idea of my real_estate acumen ) . But after years of trying to shoehorn things into an apartment kitchen , the prospect of what seemed like unlimited space was irresistible . Of course , within a year I was looking_for more shelves to put things on . Here ' s what ' s in my pantry . I ' m leaving_out the more neutral items -- flour , butter , vegetable_oil , eggs , etc . -- in favor of those things that are specific to my style of cooking . Your pantry may be similar or totally different , but this list may give you ideas for new items to keep_on hand . When it ' s hot , when you ' re exhausted , or when you ' re just hungry for a meal and can ' t wait two hours to eat , a well-stocked pantry can make quick meals easy . Following the list are recipes that show what you can do with a pantry and a_couple_of minutes . Every ingredient in these recipes is a staple -- at least at my house . REFRIGERATOR / FREEZER * Mozzarella : Though I love the fresh mozzarella you can find now , it ' s a pretty perishable item . The cheese I always have_on hand is the firmer , drier type that melts so well on top of pizzas , inside of quesadillas , over eggplant . . . I could go_on . * Parmigiano-Reggiano : I always have a good chunk -- or even two -- on_hand . Though I ' m normally a pretty stingy shopper , this is one time when I buy the best I can find , without thinking too_much about the price . That cheese is too fundamental to too many things to quibble over a buck or two . * Fresh goat_cheese : In my family , goat_cheese began not as an affectation but as a necessity . For many years , my daughter was allergic to cow ' s milk , so goat_cheese was the only alternative . Now , we ' ve developed a taste for it and we still use it more_than any other cheese . * Bread crumbs : Do you have a problem with those expensive rustic breads going stale before they ' re finished ? Cut_off the crusts , cut the loaves in cubes , toast them in the oven and then run them through the food_processor . You can use the crumbs over pasta , in soups , in a_zillion ways . * Black_olives : Another basic , either as part of an instant appetizer plate or as a flavoring in a prepared dish . Check Greek and Middle Eastern markets for the best buys . I never use those canned California_olives . * Roasted sweet red_peppers : When they ' re cheap , I buy fresh red_peppers by the carload , roast them on my barbecue , peel them and stick them into small plastic food bags with a little slivered garlic and some olive_oil . They ' ll last all year in the freezer and are much better than the pickled type , which is all you can buy_in the store . * Stock : I ' m not the kind of cook who makes fresh stock for every dish . But I am the kind of cook who makes a lot of stock once in a while and then freezes it in ice_cube trays . Just be sure to dump them into a plastic food bag before guests go looking_for ice_cubes for their drinks . * Walnuts : One of my dessert standbys , I always have walnuts in the freezer to go_into cookies or flour-less cakes . * Cheese-filled tortellini or ravioli : These are strictly for those instant meals at the end of long work_days . You can get them with all kinds of fillings , some of them wildly esoteric . The simpler the better in this case . Serve them with a little brown_butter and sage and you ' ve got an elegant weeknight dinner . DRY INGREDIENTS * Pastas : For short pastas , I like to use tubes ( rigatoni , penne , etc. ) because I find that other shapes ( farfalle , etc. ) cook unevenly . Also , orzo , rice-shaped pasta , is wonderful for soaking_up meat juices . For long pastas , in addition to the obvious candidates ( spaghetti , fettuccine ) , look_for perciatelli , which looks_like spaghetti with a hole through the middle . It ' s got a nice bite that makes even a simple tomato_sauce shine . Don ' t buy angel hair pasta -- it always clumps when it cooks and cools almost instantly into a rubbery , starchy ball . * Bittersweet_chocolate : This is always on_hand for making icings , mousses , cakes . . . well , you name it . In fact , break_off little chunks and you can make the best chocolate_chip_cookies ever . * Arborio rice : This stuff used to be ridiculously expensive , which was a shame , because risotto is a real boon when you need to have dinner on the table in a half-hour and all you ' ve got_in the fridge are some vegetables or a_few scraps of leftover meat . I buy arborio in vacuum-packed bags when it ' s on sale and it lasts forever . If it ' s still too pricey , look_for American short-grain rice . It ' s not as good , but for everyday meals it works just fine . * Cocoa : This is another one of those ingredients I tend to buy a lot of when it is_on sale . Not only is it good on winter mornings , but there are a good half-dozen cakes and cookies that I can put_together with it in almost no time . CANNED INGREDIENTS * Canned whole tomatoes : I ' ve got a side_yard full of shoulder-high tomato_plants , but none of the fruit is ripe yet , so all my tomatoes right now are from a can . This is probably the most common canned_food in good pantries . Here ' s a great quick tomato_sauce : Put one tablespoon olive_oil in the bottom of a pan . Mince a couple cloves of garlic and add them to the cold oil . Place over medium heat and cook until the garlic turns translucent . Run a can of tomatoes through the fine holes in a food mill into the pan . Cook 10 to 15 minutes over medium-high heat until thickened . Then add either capers or basil , depending_on the season . * Canned white_beans , black_beans and garbanzo beans : Certainly , dried beans that you cook yourself are better , but these are good weeknight substitutions -- especially for salads and to fill_out soups . While I would n ' t serve these beans to guests ( I have yet to find a brand of white_beans in which two-thirds of the beans are not broken ) , I have ( and will continue to ) serve them purees of canned beans as appetizers . * Tuna_fish in oil : This is getting difficult to find these days , with every dieter in America seeming to rely_on a small can of water-packed tuna for lunch . But if calories are not that much of a concern , try the oil-packed , preferably olive_oil . Anything else tastes like fish-flavored sawdust . * Salt-packed anchovies : If you think oil-packed tuna is hard to find , try scoring some salt-packed anchovies . For me , this began as an indulgence , but quickly crossed over to a necessity . Rinse them well and fillet them and the flavor is so_much fresher and more delicate than the normal anchovy that it ' ll make a believer of you . After my first attempts at feeding my family anchovy-based dishes were soundly rejected , I began sneaking them in as flavorings in sauces and vegetable sautes . It got so whenever I asked whether my daughter liked a dish , she would fix me a stare and ask &quot; Did you put anchovies in that ? &quot; She ' s coming_around , though . You can get them mail_order from Corti Brothers grocery in Sacramento , ( 916 ) 736-3800 . Getting the rest of the family to eat them is up_to you . * Capers : I think_of capers as my out-of-season basil . To me , they provide the same kind of bright accent to dishes , though they do_it in a much different way . * Olive_oil : This is absolutely fundamental . One of my indulgences is having several olive_oils to choose from . You don ' t need to go that far , though you should have a fruity one to cook with and an elegant one to use raw , with salads . You don ' t have to pay a fortune for good olive_oil ( though , as with Parmigiano-Reggiano , this is another case in which I would ) , and paying a fortune still won ' t guarantee you the best product . The only way to choose is to try several and decide which ones you like best . * Vinegars : This is another major space occupier in my kitchen . I have more vinegars than I know what to do with . Actually , I think I could probably do with just three : balsamic ( for cooking , where its sweetness is not so distracting ) ; red or white_wine ( for general uses , though I like lemon_juice best for salad_dressings ) , and Asian rice wine ( when I need just a hint of sweet acidity ) . I know , I know : The combination of tuna and butter sounds pretty disgusting , but it is absolutely delicious . This is my adaptation of a recipe by Marcella Hazan and I use it a lot . Though it is pureed , oil-packed tuna still makes a difference , since it gives a smoother , creamier result . TUNA SPREAD 1 clove garlic 1 ( 6 1 / 2-ounce ) can oil-packed tuna 1 / 4 cup butter 1 tablespoon olive_oil 2 teaspoons capers 1 tablespoon finely minced parsley Crackers or bread rounds , optional Finely mince garlic by dropping_in feed tube of running food_processor . Turn food_processor off and add tuna , butter and olive_oil . Process until smooth , scraping down sides as necessary . Add capers and parsley and pulse once or twice to stir . Serve on crackers or bread rounds . Makes 3 / 4 cup . Each tablespoon contains about : 75 calories ; 104 mg sodium ; 13 mg cholesterol ; 6 grams fat ; grams carbohydrates ; 5 grams protein ; 0.01 grams fiber . * This is one of those things that can be done_in 15 minutes and looks_like a_million bucks . The flavors are bright and complex , and it is just perfect for warm weather . Cut the balsamic vinegar in half , and you can even serve the tomato_sauce as a cold soup . TOMATO-GOAT CHEESE APPETIZER 2 cloves garlic 1 ( 28-ounce ) can whole , peeled tomatoes 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar 2 teaspoons capers , with liquid Salt , pepper 1 / 2 pound fresh goat_cheese 1 tablespoon finely sliced fresh basil Olive_oil Finely mince garlic by dropping_in feed tube of running food_processor . Add tomatoes and balsamic vinegar and puree just until slightly chunky . Add capers . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Combine goat_cheese and basil in small bowl . Beat until smooth . Mound in middle of sheet of plastic_wrap . Spread lightly to make rectangle , form in cylinder using plastic_wrap , then twist ends to pack tightly . Unmold and carefully cut_into slices . Divide tomato puree among 6 soup_plates . Place 1 goat_cheese slice in center of each . Drizzle over with 1 teaspoon olive_oil per serving . Makes 6 servings . Each serving contains about : 169 calories ; 424 mg sodium ; 17 mg cholesterol ; 13 grams fat ; 6 grams carbohydrates ; 8 grams protein ; 0.62 grams fiber . * This is one of those perennial summertime dishes that gets repeated over and over again in different Italian cookbooks . Each has a slightly different version . This one is mine . If the salad is a little looser than you like it , reduce the amount of oil . TUNA-WHITE BEAN SALAD 1 / 2 medium red_onion 2 ( 15-ounce ) cans white ( cannellini ) beans , drained and rinsed 3 tablespoons olive_oil 3 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon_juice 1 tablespoon finely minced garlic 2 tablespoons finely minced parsley 2 ( 6 1 / 2-ounce ) cans oil-packed tuna , drained Remove ends from onion . Thinly slice onion widthwise to make thin rings . Place rings in strainer and submerge in cold water while salad is being prepared . Combine beans , olive_oil , lemon_juice , garlic and parsley in large mixing_bowl . Stir well to combine . Add tuna and stir gently , being careful not to break chunks of fish up too_much . Spoon into serving bowl . Remove onion with strainer from cold water . Rinse briefly under running cold water . Gently squeeze dry in corner of tea_towel . Scatter onion across top of serving bowl . Makes 6 servings . Each serving contains about : 653 calories ; 241 mg sodium ; 11 mg cholesterol ; 13 grams fat ; 86 grams carbohydrates ; 51 grams protein ; 8.43 grams fiber . * This recipe , from &quot; Paula Wolfert ' s World of Food , &quot; comes_together in the time it takes_to bring the pasta water to a boil ; it is compulsively edible . The toasted bread crumbs are a distinctively Sicilian twist -- as cookbook writer Anna Tasca Lanza says : &quot; We Sicilians are greedy and like to have big mouthfuls of food. &quot; PASTA WITH ANCHOVIES AND TOASTED BREAD CRUMBS 1 / 3 cup fruity extra-virgin olive_oil 1 clove garlic , halved 2 to 3 dashes hot red-pepper flakes 10 salted anchovies , filleted , soaked in milk 10 minutes , drained and cut small 1 / 2 pound thin spaghetti 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf_parsley 1 / 2 cup toasted coarse bread crumbs Heat olive_oil in heavy skillet . Add garlic . Gently cook over medium heat 2 minutes , or until golden . Discard garlic and remove skillet from heat . Add red-pepper flakes and anchovies . Mash to puree with wooden spoon . Reheat gently , stirring 1 minute to blend flavors . Remove pan from heat before oil gets too hot . Cook spaghetti in boiling salted water until al dente . While pasta is cooking , transfer 3 tablespoons pasta cooking water to anchovy-oil mixture and reheat gently . Drain pasta , transfer to skillet and toss with hot_sauce . Divide evenly onto 4 heated dishes . Sprinkle with parsley . Serve at once . Pass bread crumbs for sprinkling on top of each serving . Makes 4 servings . Each serving contains about : 439 calories ; 461 mg sodium ; 9 mg cholesterol ; 20 grams fat ; 52 grams carbohydrates ; 12 grams protein ; 0.27 grams fiber .
