   <HEADLINE> REFINERY SAYS IT WILL CLEAN_UP OIL SPILL ; ENVIRONMENT : THE OXNARD FIRM SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH THE EPA THAT REQUIRES SAFETY MEASURES TO BE INSTALLED SO THAT THE LEAKAGE DOES NOT OCCUR AGAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An Oxnard refinery that for years leaked oil into ecologically sensitive wetlands agreed Monday to clean_up its mess and install safety measures to make_sure it never happens again . Tenby Inc. , doing business as Oxnard Refinery and Chase Production , signed an agreement with the U . S . Environmental Protection Agency that requires it to commit to long-term cleanup and submit an initial plan within 21 days . The company admitted spilling at least 10 # 000 gallons of oil into a ditch leading to Mugu Lagoon , an EPA spokesman said . Under the agreement , it has 90 days from the time EPA approves the plan to finish the work . Company officials , including Chief_Executive_Officer Morley Chase , refused to discuss the case Monday . Questions about the spill and the EPA agreement were referred to company lawyers , who said that the initial cleanup has been completed and that studies are under way to identify the source of the leaks -- reported a year ago -- and develop a long-term remedy . &quot; We ' re unaware of any ongoing release , &quot; said Michael Francis , a Los Angeles-based attorney for Tenby . &quot; We have no idea of any persistent release from production operations or the refinery operations , &quot; he said . &quot; It is hoped that these measures will prevent any future occurrence. &quot; Federal regulators said the agreement , hashed out since details of the leak were uncovered last year by state Fish and Game_wardens , would ensure that the company takes responsibility for the pollution and its cleanup costs . But even with the agreement announced Monday , federal_officials said they are still working to evaluate the full extent of the spill . &quot; We can safely say it ' s more_than 10 # 000 gallons , but how much more we don ' t know , &quot; said David Schmidt , a spokesman for the EPA ' s Western regional office in San Francisco . &quot; We ' re prepared to require the full cleanup -- no matter how big it is , &quot; he said . &quot; There are provisions in the agreement that call_for reopening the scope of the work if it turns_out to be more_than what they are promising to do within the first 90 days. &quot; * State Fish and Game_wardens first discovered the oil spill a year ago after someone reported seeing oil sheens leading to Mugu Lagoon , a sensitive saltwater habitat for a variety of species . Fish and Game Capt . Roger Reese said damage from the spill has been significant . &quot; What we found were skeletal remains from crayfish and mosquito fish , and a general absence of fish and wildlife , &quot; Reese said . &quot; It looked_like it had been a chronic problem. &quot; Like the EPA , however , Reese said his inspectors have yet to determine the extent of the ground-water and above-ground contamination . &quot; In this case , it became apparent that the problem was a lot more complex , &quot; he said . &quot; It will require long-term monitoring. &quot; The agreement announced Monday is separate from a civil suit filed against Tenby and its chief_executive_officer by the Ventura County district_attorney ' s office earlier this month . &quot; Those are some of the same remedies we ' re seeking , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Gregory W . Brose , who prosecutes environmental offenses . &quot; If it ' s been agreed to in the federal case , we are obviously glad , &quot; Brose said . &quot; But that doesn ' t mean the state ' s civil case has no further ( bearing ) . &quot; Brose alleges in the civil suit that Tenby and Chase illegally discharged an unspecified amount of petroleum products into state waters at least four years ago , and that the company engaged in improper business practices in doing so . &quot; Part of what we ' ve alleged is that there ' s been some negligence in allowing the releases to occur , &quot; Brose said . &quot; that ' s a problem. &quot; The Ventura County Superior_Court lawsuit specifically alleges that two separate oil tanks leaked into the ditch , as did oil from a flow line and pipe casings from a particular oil_well . The lawsuit asks a judge to grant a permanent injunction preventing the company from further polluting the lagoon . &quot; The unlawful conduct and acts of the defendants in violation of the law . . . demonstrate the necessity and legal basis for granting injunctive relief and imposition of civil penalties , &quot; the suit contends . Francis , the Tenby attorney , said his clients have already installed a series of measures to prevent further spills , including a set of dams and oil-water separators that will better control the product flow . * But the work plan being drafted will further identify particular problem spots , he said . &quot; The assessment is intended to ensure that there are no pipelines or tanks that are leaking , &quot; Francis said . Even EPA officials , who could impose strict fines and penalties if the agreement is not adhered to , acknowledge that they do not yet know what specifically caused the leaks . &quot; What we really need to do is go_out there and investigate the sources of the oil , &quot; said EPA attorney Lisa Castanon , who is handling the case . &quot; We know it ' s getting_into the ditch , but we don ' t know what the source is. &quot;</TEXT>
