   <HEADLINE> COSTA MESA GIRL FATALLY SHOT ; FATHER HELD AS MURDER_SUSPECT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 15-year-old girl died after being shot in the neck at her home , and police said Friday that even though the shooting might have been accidental , her father had been jailed on suspicion of murder . Police said the father , David Curtis Stinson , called them to the scene shortly after the shooting at their apartment Thursday night in the 3100 block of Coral Avenue . They said he apparently &quot; shot the girl while he was cleaning or checking ( a ) gun &quot; as the two talked in his room . &quot; There was no apparent motive for the shooting , &quot; said a Costa Mesa police spokesman , who added that the 39-year-old warehouse supervisor had been drinking before the incident . Stinson was booked on suspicion of murder and was being held Friday in lieu of posting $ 250 # 000 bail . Police would not identify the shooting victim by name , but two teen-agers who were present when the shooting occurred said the girl was Stinson ' s 15-year-old daughter , Callaster Natis Stinson . Erica Garcia , 17 , said she and Ray Kraskey , 18 , had been listening to &quot; hip-hop rap &quot; music with Natis , as she was called by her friends , when Stinson returned home shortly before 9 p.m. Thursday . She said he appeared to be unsteady on his feet and his speech was slurred as if he had been drinking . Kraskey said that shortly after his return home , the father went_into his bedroom and called_for his daughter . &quot; He called her in , and then BOOM , &quot; said Kraskey , who was tearful Friday as he recalled the events leading to his friend ' s death . Garcia said that after the shooting , the father repeatedly tried to dial 911 on his cordless phone but couldn ' t get_it to work . Garcia said she ran next door and called_for help on a neighbor ' s phone . The neighbor , who is a nurse , tried unsuccessfully to revive the girl before she was rushed to Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian , where she was pronounced dead . Garcia said she could not believe that the shooting was intentional . &quot; I don ' t think he would deliberately kill her . He never even yelled at her , &quot; Garcia said . Several of the father ' s friends described him as a hard-working man who , after divorcing his wife , had fought in court to win custody of his daughter , arguing that the girl was not being raised properly . In court documents , Stinson claimed that the girl , then 9 years old , was 20 pounds underweight and had been forced to scrape mold off of bread scraps to have something to eat . Tom Staples , 51 , who said he was the father ' s roommate in 1988 when he got custody of the girl , said Stinson &quot; rescued &quot; the child , who had been living_in an abandoned bus in Riverside County with her mother , Suzanne Patricia Stinson . But Suzanne Stinson questioned the father ' s parental fitness , accusing him in court documents of excessive drinking . &quot; He would spend time at the bar every day after work and would spend more money than we could afford there , &quot; she said . Julie Block , Erica Garcia ' s mother , said neighbors had taken Natis &quot; under their wing &quot; once she was awarded to the father , who was known as a good cook -- prized for the homemade chicken pot pies he served to neighbors he invited to his home . Mimi Birch , an assistant principal at Estancia High_School , where Natis was a sophomore , described her as &quot; a very bright girl who just couldn ' t make herself come_to school. &quot; Christine Cullen , Natis ' counselor , said the girl had showed_up for school no more_than a day or two last semester . In her neighborhood , Natis was mourned Friday as a good friend and a trusted baby-sitter loved by neighborhood children . &quot; I cared deeply for Natis . She was very nice , funny , good with_children . All the kids loved her , &quot; said Sarah Thomas , who on Friday was trying to figure_out how to break tell her 6-year-old son that Natis was dead . &quot; It is a tragedy , &quot; Thomas added . &quot; We know her dad did love her . It shows how dangerous it is to have firearms in your home. &quot; Neighbors said they will have a car wash today and Sunday at the Mesa Verde Shell station at 3131 Harbor Blvd . to try to raise money to pay_for the funeral .
