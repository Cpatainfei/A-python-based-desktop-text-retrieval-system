   <HEADLINE> FOREMAN THE MAN OF THE BIG MOMENT ; BOXING : AFTER ONE OF SPORTS ' GREATEST VICTORIES , WHAT CAN HE POSSIBLY DO FOR AN ENCORE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They sifted through history Sunday , with a clap of thunder still echoing in their ears . What has George Foreman wrought ? Nothing less than a moment the sports world will forever use as a historical flashpoint , according to many who witnessed his startling one-punch 10th-round knockout of Michael Moorer on Saturday night . Like Bobby Thomson ' s pennant-winning home_run or Willie Mays ' World_Series catch or the U.S. hockey_team ' s Olympic miracle in previous eras , when you remember the 1990s , they said , you will remember the landmark 10 seconds that made 45-year-old Foreman the oldest heavyweight champion ever . Twenty years ago , Foreman was the victim of Muhammad Ali making his own mark on history . Saturday night , donning the old velour red trunks he wore when Ali rope-a-doped him to shocking defeat , Foreman closed the circle . &quot; It was something that all_of you who follow the sport will never forget , &quot; said Bob Arum , Foreman ' s promoter . &quot; It ' ll go_down in history comparable_to when Ali knocked George down in Zaire 20 years ago. &quot; No matter what his future holds -- and at this point , who ' s going_to guess ? -- all that mattered Sunday was the short , twisting , concussive right_hand Foreman , trailing on all cards , fired into Moorer ' s chin . &quot; It was the most significant punch landed in heavyweight history , &quot; said veteran boxing observer and trainer Gil Clancy . &quot; that ' s my opinion. &quot; Said trainer Lou Duva , who is associated with Moorer ' s camp : &quot; The only thing I can compare it to in my 50 years of boxing was when Rocky Marciano was losing in the 13th round , and he needed to win and he knocked_out Jersey Joe Walcott ( on Sept . 23 , 1952 ) . &quot; That was the right_hand heard ' round the world . And this was all_of that . This was like Joe Namath ' s Super Bowl guarantee , like Bobby Thomson. &quot; Angelo Dundee , who was Ali ' s trainer 20 years ago and has worked Foreman ' s corner for three years , said he was never concerned that Foreman was in_trouble despite Moorer ' s repeated pounding on Foreman ' s face . Dundee , who had to keep pulling_up Foreman ' s old shorts between rounds because the elastic was_well worn_out , said he knew Foreman was setting_up Moorer by throwing hard left jabs to make Moorer overconcerned with the left . But he did warn Foreman before the 10th . &quot; I said you only have nine minutes left and you ' re losing on the scorecards , &quot; Dundee said . &quot; I said you better knock this kid out quick. &quot; In the Moorer corner , trainer Teddy Atlas was clearly concerned that his 26-year-old fighter was leaving himself open_to what Atlas called &quot; a sneaky right hand. &quot; Moorer , though he said he tried to circle harder to his right , never could make the adjustment . Soon , after absorbing a_couple_of rights early in the round , Moorer was raked with a glancing left , then the bomb that gave Foreman the 68th knockout of his career . Moorer ' s head flew back so quickly , his body seemed to pause for a moment , his legs and hips caught in the back-first crumple to the canvas . Moorer ' s head snapped against the floor , raised at the count of three , but he never made a real attempt to get_to his feet . When his corner removed his mouthpiece after the knockout , blood streamed out of Moorer ' s nose . &quot; The other guy did the unforgivable sin against George , &quot; Dundee said . &quot; He bent down . When you bend down against George , you ' re in big , big trouble . &quot; George used that chop right_hand , and he ' s putting 250 pounds behind it . What ' s in front of it has gotta go down. &quot; For Arum , who has been waging war with boxing ' s three major governing organizations for years and had to successfully sue to keep this fight alive after the World Boxing Assn . refused to sanction it , Foreman ' s victory and status as both the sport ' s most popular person and its most dramatic champion is a chance to cleanse boxing . On Sunday , Arum said that if Foreman wants to continue fighting -- no guarantee -- Tommy Morrison would be a natural to be the first challenger because Morrison defeated Foreman 17 months ago . And Arum said a Foreman-Mike Tyson bout would be &quot; the fight to end all fights. &quot; One man definitely not on any short_lists : Larry Holmes , 45 , who is challenging World Boxing Council champion Oliver McCall in January . Arum said that Holmes once kicked Foreman out of a post-fight media conference and that Foreman will never forgive him for that . Foreman , who won the International Boxing Federation and WBA titles Saturday , is_due to fight both organization ' s mandatory challenger , the past-his-prime Tony Tucker , sometime in 1995 . But Arum says Foreman might be able to move the sport past the strangling alphabet politics . &quot; When something cataclysmic like this happens , everybody rethinks their positions , &quot; Arum said . &quot; And people might be willing to take a risk and have fights the way we used to , contender vs . contender . &quot; This is a sport that can ' t get sponsors , a sport most people look_at with a jaundiced eye . This is a sport hardly on the pinnacle of popularity . &quot; Now you have an event like what happened last night . And for a reasonable amount_of_time , it will change the perception . Maybe it ' ll just be for a moment of time , but we have some breathing space . &quot; But if we go_back with that same old Tony Tucker . . . , it ' ll go right back into the dump. &quot; Left in the background were questions about Moorer ' s future . Moorer had said even before winning the title last April that he eagerly awaited his chance to retire and go_into law_enforcement , and was far from a popular champion . &quot; I think Michael will have to come_back , &quot; Duva said . &quot; I don ' t think he can quit that way . What , is he going_to become a cop ? &quot; Moorer , of course , could always take 10 years off , experience a religious rebirth and come_back into the ring to win_back the title . The man who just accomplished that feat flew back to his Houston home Sunday morning , and , though he held no more news_conferences , the thunder was still sounding .</TEXT>
