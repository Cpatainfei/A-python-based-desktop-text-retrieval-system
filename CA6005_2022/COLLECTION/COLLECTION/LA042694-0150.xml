   <HEADLINE> UNOCAL REPORT ON MYANMAR REJECTED ; ENERGY : SHAREHOLDERS DEFEAT PROXY RESOLUTION CALLING FOR STUDY ON ALLEGED HUMAN_RIGHTS VIOLATIONS RELATED TO PIPELINE PROJECT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shareholders of Unocal Corp . voted Monday to reject a proxy resolution calling_on the company to make a comprehensive report on conditions in Myanmar ( formerly Burma ) , where allegations of human_rights violations have stirred controversy over a Unocal gas pipeline project . &quot; I think our record on human_rights is as good or better than any other company , &quot; Richard J . Stegemeier , Unocal ' s chief_executive , said at a news_conference after the company ' s annual shareholders meeting . Investors filed into the meeting hall of the Los Angeles headquarters Monday morning past about 40 human_rights activists , who chanted , &quot; You don ' t care , Unocal. &quot; The demonstrators held vigil in the light rain , using huge helium balloons to float a 28-foot banner emblazoned with a blown-up photograph of a man in leg irons and a caption that read , &quot; Stop Unocal ' s Chainsaw Gang Debacle in Burma. &quot; Proponents of the shareholder resolution allege that forced labor is widespread in Myanmar and that such abuses have taken_place on infrastructure projects in the area of the planned pipeline . The company denies there is any evidence to link Unocal to human_rights violations . Despite the defeat of the Myanmar resolution , Unocal ' s public relations problems appear far from over . Unocal entered a no-contest plea last month to three criminal misdemeanor counts in connection with the leakage of diluent -- a diesel-like thinning agent -- at its Guadalupe oil field in San Luis Obispo County . The company agreed to pay a $ 1.5-million fine and to clean_up as_many as 200 # 000 barrels of diluent that had leaked into the sand over the past 40 years . Stegemeier , who steps_down as chief_executive at the end of April , said the company had set the &quot; highest ethical standards &quot; for itself but &quot; unfortunately we failed to meet these standards at the Guadalupe oil field. &quot; Unocal is charging $ 25 million to after-tax earnings in the first_quarter of 1994 in connection with the Guadalupe spill , but Stegemeier said the write-down will not have a &quot; material effect on the company ' s financial condition. &quot; ( Unocal on Monday announced that net earnings for the first_quarter were $ 54 million , or 19 cents a share , up from $ 11 million , or 1 cent a share , for the same period a year ago. ) Meanwhile , the sponsors of the Myanmar resolution said the results of the proxy ballot -- a 14.1 % yes vote -- was large enough to ensure that they would file the measure again next year . &quot; This is not going_to go_away , &quot; said a spokesman for the Interfaith Center_on Corporate Responsibility , the initiative ' s sponsor . Stegemeier said the company will decide later whether it will appeal_to the Securities and Exchange Commission to have future resolutions on Myanmar stricken from its proxy statements . At the shareholders meeting , several human_rights advocates denounced Unocal ' s willingness to work with the military junta that rules Myanmar with an iron fist . &quot; You are partners_in_crime , &quot; said Taw Myo Myint , a former student protester who sought political asylum in the United States after a bloody repression of dissidents in 1988 . She owns 10 shares of Unocal stock . Stegemeier said a team of Unocal officials visited the pipeline area last week and found no evidence of forced labor or destruction of villages , as critics have maintained . But one of Unocal ' s investigators , Joel P . Robinson , said the team was in the area only one day and that its access was restricted by local Myanmar military authorities , who determined where they could land their helicopter .</TEXT>
