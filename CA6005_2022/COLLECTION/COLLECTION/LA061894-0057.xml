   <HEADLINE> CITYSCAPES / PAUL FELDMAN AND PATRICK J . MCDONNELL : GERMANS , BOLIVIANS TAKE FIRST DRINK FROM WORLD CUP ; DURING THE . . . ROUGHLY PLAYED FIRST_HALF , FANS SHRIEKED AS BOTH SIDES MISSED SCORING OPPORTUNITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At a Torrance beer hall , more_than 200 German soccer fans quaffed pilsener and let their bratwurst grow cold Friday as they hooted and hollered at a pair of big-screen television_sets displaying the opening game of the World Cup . Meanwhile , in North Hollywood , at perhaps this nation ' s only Bolivian-Mexican restaurant , two_dozen Bolivian soccer fans ate meat_pies as they cheered on their underdog national team in front of a_couple_of small screens . By the time the tightly contested game in Chicago was over , with Germany the 1-0 victor , German fans were smiling in their steins and Bolivians were crying in their Pasena , as the Bolivian beer label is known . But regardless of the results , followers of both squads -- as well as the multitudes in polyglot Los Angeles supporting the 22 other participating national teams -- had their appetites whetted for the monthlong international soccer tournament , which makes its local debut at the Rose Bowl today . Four years ago , Elsa Mueller of Diamond Bar jumped into her swimming_pool with her clothes on when Germany won the World Cup_final . On Friday , she and her husband , Walter , remained garbed and confident as they viewed the first-round match at the Alpine Village Inn in Torrance . &quot; This is a cinch for Germany , 5-1 , &quot; said Elsa Mueller , a retired restaurant manager , shortly before the game began . The Muellers , who moved to America in the early 1950s , said they had driven an hour to watch the game for the camaraderie . &quot; I ' m so excited , &quot; Mrs . Mueller said as half-full plates of chicken and bratwurst sat tepid on their table , &quot; I can ' t even eat. &quot; At a bar stool nearby , computer_systems analyst Ronald Urbina sipped on a bottle of Spaten beer . Urbina , a Chilean native who has lived_in Germany , was so excited that he arrived in Torrance two hours before the Alpine Village Inn opened Friday morning . &quot; So I went_to McDonald ' s to buy some 99 cent World Cup pins , &quot; he said . They were displayed on his German World Cup hat and his German World Cup T-shirt . In front of another TV screen in the balcony sat 87-year-old Julius Kresinski of Downey , who said he played soccer in Germany before World_War_II . The seat next to Kresinski was empty , save for a life-size black , red and yellow German flag . At game time , most German fans expressed certainty of their team ' s superiority over the Bolivian squad -- and twice , on shots that went slightly astray , the boisterous foot-stomping reached quake-like levels . Use of hands and arms may_not be allowed_in soccer , but Mrs . Mueller more_than made_up for the players on the TV_set , punching the air whenever the German squad made a good play . By halftime , with the score still 0-0 , the crowd had grown somewhat subdued , and Urbina and others said their team ' s performance had been impaired by the Chicago heat . Not so , said Gustav Netal , an Austrian immigrant , who was also rooting for Germany . The favorites , the machine_tool rebuilder said , looked as if they were still asleep . His prescription ? &quot; They need a shot of Jagermeister at halftime. &quot; When the German team finally took the lead -- for good -- in the second_half , the entire crowd , except for Kresinski , stood on their feet . The octogenarian deliberately unfurled his flag and waved it in the air for a good 30 seconds -- to the delight of all but those at the table directly behind him , who complained that they couldn ' t see the instant replay . At the L.A. Salsa eatery in North Hollywood , special menus featured the unusual Bolivian-Mexican mix of dishes and hyped the day ' s matchup : &quot; Two Titans , face to face. &quot; Hugo Velasco , 32-year-old co-owner , donned a Bolivia World Cup T-shirt and a cap emblazoned with his homeland ' s national colors , red and yellow . Apprehensive , he nonetheless exuded confidence that the long-shot Bolivians could somehow upset the powerful German team . &quot; I had a feeling that we would win , &quot; said Velasco , serving Bolivian saltenas , or meat_pies , to a crowd of anxious compatriots arrayed in front of the two television screens . Others were not quite so sanguine , expressing the hope that the Bolivian squad , in its first Cup appearance in 44 years , would at least comport itself honorably against its formidable opponent . The sense of national pride that virtually shut_down soccer-mad Bolivia on Friday was clearly apparent among these aficionados . &quot; For once Bolivia is in the spotlight for something positive , &quot; said Mario Torrico , a 39-year-old Bolivian native who came_to the United States at age 2 , noting the nation ' s usual notoriety for drug trafficking and coups d ' etat . During the tightly contested and roughly played first_half , fans shrieked as both sides missed scoring opportunities . The Bolivian onlookers were proud_of their boys . And , in their eyes , the Teutonic strongmen were wilting in the 90-degree Chicago heat . A relieved Sylvia Antezana said , &quot; For us , a tie is a victory. &quot; A nervous fan added as the second_half began : &quot; We may need the paramedic. &quot; Alas , dreams of a tie -- or even a victory -- were largely dashed when superstar German forward Juergen Klinsmann broke free and blasted the ball into an empty net in the 61st minute . Disbelieving Bolivians called the play a fluke , and possibly an offsides violation , but the celebratory German players on the screen recognized that they had made the decisive breakthrough . Afterward , pride at the South_Americans ' surprisingly strong performance outweighed their supporters ' disappointment . &quot; The one goal was absurd , but everyone knows that we played well , &quot; said La Paz native Roxana Chalco . The Muellers headed for home with smiles on their faces but no plans to leap into their swimming_pool with or without bathing_suits . Instead , they planned to watch South_Korea play Spain in the second Cup match , and eat German baked_goods and sausages . For Velasco , the owner of the Bolivian-Mexican restaurant , the loss was more_than a case of national disappointment . He would have to work something out with his German brother-in-law , whom he had bet $ 2 # 000 that Bolivia would prevail . And Velasco would also have to enter into somewhat more delicate negotiations with his girlfriend , Ana Barrenechea , who had vowed to marry him if Bolivia won . &quot; Well , we ' re still novios , &quot; Barrenechea said afterward , using the Spanish term for girlfriends and boyfriends .</TEXT>
