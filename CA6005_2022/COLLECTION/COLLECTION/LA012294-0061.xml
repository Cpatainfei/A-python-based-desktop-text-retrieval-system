   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; FRUSTRATED FILLMORE PONDERS REBUILDING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> City leaders and merchants in Fillmore expressed growing frustration Friday as they searched for the best way to go_about rebuilding the devastated farm community . The job of rebuilding will take much longer than initially predicted , city officials said . It will be complicated by worries about possible lawsuits and fears that local businesses might not be able to afford to start over again . Trying to avoid future litigation by downtown merchants with buildings damaged in Monday ' s quake , the Fillmore City_Council on Thursday adopted a detailed appeal process for any building the council decides ultimately to condemn . The council spent more_than an hour in a closed executive_session with City Atty . Roger Meyers before adopting the complex appeal process -- discussing the legal pitfalls of condemning any buildings on the downtown strip . Meyers warned the council not to act hastily , citing mistakes made by the town of Coalinga after city officials there decided to raze most of their earthquake-damaged downtown in 1983 . Coalinga later was hit with a series of lawsuits from business people who said Coalinga officials acted prematurely and destroyed the character of the town by demolishing its downtown area . &quot; Our vision for Fillmore has always been to preserve the historic look of downtown , &quot; said City_Manager Roy Payne , who also urged a cautious approach to reconstruction . &quot; that ' s not going_to change. &quot; The city ' s policy of moving slowly , however , actually brought criticisms Friday from some business owners who complained that they are being blocked from demolishing their buildings as soon as possible . Members of the Masons Assn. , which owns the historic Masonic Temple on Central Avenue , were among the chief critics of any delays in demolition . &quot; It ' s got_to come_down , &quot; said Jack Starnes , a member of the association . But Ken Glenn , president of the Masons Assn. , said the group doesn ' t have the money needed for a new building even if the old one is demolished . &quot; It ' s going_to come_down and the lot will probably remain vacant , or we ' ll try to sell it , &quot; he said . Cost will be a big problem for many other small businesses in the city , officials agreed . That view was supported by a city consultant who told the council Thursday that the new codes could be prohibitively expensive . &quot; You don ' t want to adopt a code that is going_to be more expensive than anyone realizes , making_it impossible for these businesses to rebuild , &quot; said architect Steve Craig of The Planning Corp . in Santa Barbara . &quot; Based on my experience , not much is going_to happen for a while . Look_at Santa Cruz and Watsonville and you ' ll see it ' s going_to take a long_time to rebuild , &quot; Craig said . City_Manager Payne took_issue with Craig ' s predictions that reconstruction efforts might be too slow in Fillmore . &quot; How quickly we can recover has as much to do with the will and desire of the people here than anything else , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
