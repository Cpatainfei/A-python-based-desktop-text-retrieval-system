   <HEADLINE> U.S. OFFICIALS CAUTION MEXICO AGAINST ELECTION_FRAUD ; POLITICS : CHRISTOPHER PRAISES REFORMS BUT WARNS OF CONSEQUENCES IF THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE IS TAINTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the midst of this nation ' s tumultuous presidential campaign , top Clinton_Administration officials gently warned the Mexican government Monday that any hints of taint in the election this fall could be disastrous . Concluding a two-day mission here , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , Atty . Gen . Janet Reno and other top Administration officials also delivered the message that the United States supports democratic reform in Mexico . &quot; We applaud the far-reaching electoral reforms that Mexico has adopted over the last several years , &quot; Christopher said . &quot; We trust that these reforms , combined with your new election technology , will produce a free and fair election that will give all Mexicans confidence in its outcome. &quot; The U.S. Cabinet members ' visit was long planned as one of a series of regular meetings between the two governments . It came , however , at a delicate time -- as Mexicans are picking their next president and shortly after governing party candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated . Some U.S. officials worry that the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) -- which has ruled Mexico since 1929 , often through vote fraud -- may be tempted to tamper with the election if its successor candidate , Ernesto Zedillo , appears in danger of losing . Officially , the Administration says it is convinced that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s administration plans to carry_out a fair election . But Christopher repeatedly warned of the consequences if it does not . He did so subtly in a public speech at the Foreign Ministry and more bluntly in private , aides said . Besides supporting democratic reform , he warned against corruption and praised the economic and political reforms that have made Mexico one of Latin_America ' s economic leaders . &quot; The modernizing economic reforms of the Salinas administration have made Mexico a pacesetter for the region and for the world , &quot; Christopher said . They also have produced an era of unprecedented cooperation between Mexico and the United States , capped by last year ' s passage of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . While continuing those reforms in the political_arena , the United States wants Mexico to intensify efforts to root_out government corruption , especially the political power of wealthy drug_traffickers . &quot; To sustain trust in democracy , governments must attack the scourges of corruption and drug trafficking , &quot; Christopher said . &quot; Government cannot be held accountable if its power can be bought . Authority will not be respected if the rule_of_law can be defied with impunity. &quot; A Christopher aide said his warnings on free elections and corruption were deliberately understated and that State_Department officials were more direct in private . &quot; The Mexicans read these statements very carefully and are hypersensitive to any sign that we are interfering in their internal affairs . So we didn ' t want to come_on too strong in public , &quot; he said . In private , U.S. officials also protested the Mexican government ' s failure to keep Salinas ' commitment to extradite Serapio Zuniga Rios , a suspect in the rape of a 4-year-old Riverside County girl . The governments agreed to negotiate a written agreement on extradition procedures . Until it is completed , an agreement forbidding the abduction of alleged criminals and important to Mexico will not be signed . Christopher did not meet with any of the nine presidential candidates , aides said , to avoid any appearance of U.S. meddling . He acted appalled at the suggestion , made during a news_conference , that his presence could be construed as support for the government -- and , by extension , the PRI . Besides their worries about the fairness of this nation ' s political_system , analysts have expressed concern that Mexico ' s progress toward a more open society has been threatened by a rising tide of violence , reflected in the slayings of both candidate Colosio and Tijuana Police_Chief Federico Benitez Lopez , who was assassinated last month . U.S. officials said they are concerned that both assassinations may have been ordered by powerful drug_traffickers allied_with anti-reformist officials . Both U.S. and Mexican officials are becoming increasingly worried about the corrupting influence of narcotics traffic on the government here . The news weekly Proceso stated that Finance_Minister Pedro Aspe Armella has acknowledged that drug_traffickers have permeated practically all levels of law_enforcement in Mexico . Aspe ' s office could not immediately confirm that statement . A senior State_Department official said the Administration is concerned that Salinas ' drive against corruption appears to have stalled and that drug_traffickers appear to have increased their influence , especially in some local areas . &quot; The central government ' s control over these things has weakened , &quot; the official said . &quot; There has been a kind of institutional entropy. &quot;</TEXT>
