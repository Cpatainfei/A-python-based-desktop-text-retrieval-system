   <HEADLINE> THE DEFICIT : BRINGING FEDERAL SPENDING UNDER CONTROL ; UNDER CLINTON ' S LEADERSHIP , RED INK HAS BEEN REDUCED AND THE ECONOMY HAS MOUNTED A STRONG RECOVERY . BUT HEALTH_CARE INFLATION COULD SCUTTLE THE PROGRESS WE ' VE MADE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Times has invited the two leading candidates in the hotly contested race for Congress in the 24th District , which includes the southwest San Fernando Valley , to write_on several issues before the election . Incumbent Democrat Anthony Beilenson has been a congressman since 1977 . Republican Rich Sybert was state director of planning and research from 1991 to 1993 . For this article they were asked if the federal budget_deficit is a significant problem , and if so , what should be done to attack it . Congress and the President have been struggling for some time now to reduce the huge budget_deficits of the 1980s . We made a modest amount of progress during the last two years of George_Bush ' s presidency , but our greatest success came just last year when Congress passed President Clinton ' s five-year , $ 500-billion deficit-reduction act , the largest such measure in history . The 1993 Budget Act has resulted in several very significant accomplishments : * Budget_deficits have been slashed . The Budget Act , which cut $ 225 billion in spending , will result in a drop_in the federal_deficit from its record high of $ 290 billion in 1992 to $ 167 billion next year -- $ 136 billion lower than the deficit would have been if Congress had rejected the President ' s plan . By next year , for the first time in over 40 years , the federal_deficit will have declined for three years in a row . Measured in terms of the size of our economy , the news is even better : The 1992 deficit equaled 5 % of our nation ' s gross_domestic_product . Next year ' s deficit will be just 2.5 % of GDP . And by 1998 it will have dropped to 2.2 % . * Federal spending is under tighter control . Tough new budget rules require us to reduce discretionary spending ( spending for virtually all government functions except payments for benefits and interest on the debt ) by about $ 100 billion over the next five years . By 1998 , the percentage of our nation ' s GDP represented by all discretionary federal spending will drop from its 1992 level of 9 % to 6.7 % -- its lowest level in 46 years . Budget rules adopted in 1990 also prevent Congress from expanding government benefits or tax_breaks unless compensating cuts or revenue increases occur . Only in cases where the President and Congress agree that a true national emergency exists , such_as the Northridge earthquake , can Congress spend additional funds without making compensating cuts or raising revenues . When the House of Representatives considered annual spending bills this year , we cut 395 programs below their previous year ' s levels -- and we eliminated 36 programs entirely . * The number of federal workers is falling dramatically . The number of federal civilian employees is being cut by more_than 250 # 000 over the next six years . By 1998 , we will have fewer than 2 million federal workers for the first time since 1966 . Thirty billion dollars of the savings which will be realized from eliminating these jobs will be used to finance the new crime-fighting initiatives before Congress so that no new taxes will be needed to cover those costs . * Tax relief was provided_for working families of modest incomes and made 90 % of small businesses eligible for tax cuts . The income_tax increases in the deficit-reduction act will be paid only by the wealthiest 1.2 % of Americans , who earn more_than $ 180 # 000 a year -- the people who benefited the most from tax cuts throughout the 1980s . The other 98.8 % of Americans will either pay the same , or less , in income_taxes . * Economic growth is strong and steady -- job creation is_on the rise . Interest_rates dropped dramatically in early 1993 on the expectation that Congress would pass a major deficit-reduction bill . That drop fueled a national economic recovery which is now exceeding the predictions economists made only a year ago . Since January , 1993 , the economy has generated 4 million new private-sector jobs -- double the number created in the previous four years . Jobs in manufacturing , which had been_on the decline for several years , have been growing_over the last six months . Other signs of economic health -- industrial production , retail sales , business investment , housing starts , consumer confidence -- are all rising . Interest_rates , while up slightly , are still at their lowest level in 20 years . And inflation is being held_in check . Because Southern California experienced a deeper recession than other parts of the country , recovery was bound to take more time here . But even in our region , the unemployment_rate has been declining and other positive trends are finally emerging . Although we are making significant progress on reducing the deficit , much more needs to be done . While spending for most federal programs is now declining , spending for entitlement programs , particularly Medicare and Medicaid , is continuing to surge . Unless the underlying causes of health_care inflation are dealt with , federal_deficits will begin to rise again starting in 1997 . that ' s one critically important reason for ensuring that any health_care reform bill passed_by Congress has effective provisions for controlling health_care costs . The President has appointed a high-profile commission to recommend proposals for reducing the costs of federal entitlement programs . The panel ' s report , due in December , is expected to lead to congressional consideration of program changes that will further reduce federal spending . As we proceed with efforts to make further cuts_in the deficit , the most important ingredient we will need is support from the public . Americans need to make_it clear that they want their elected officials to place a higher priority on balancing the budget than on cutting taxes or increasing spending . If the political will to solve this problem exists , the solutions will be achieved .</TEXT>
