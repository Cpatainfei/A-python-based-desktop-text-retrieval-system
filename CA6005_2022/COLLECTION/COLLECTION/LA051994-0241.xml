   <HEADLINE> BERLUSCONI WINS CONFIDENCE VOTE FROM SENATE ; ITALY : DESPITE MISGIVINGS ABOUT NEO-FASCISTS IN HIS CABINET , THE UPPER CHAMBER HANDS HIM A KEY VICTORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi narrowly won parliamentary approval Wednesday to launch a novel , untried right-wing government , despite widespread misgivings about the inclusion of neo-fascist ministers in his Cabinet . After two days and 16 hours of often acerbic debate , the Senate gave the 57-year-old Milan media mogul a vote_of_confidence Wednesday night . Berlusconi triumphed 159-153 , picking_up crucial last-minute votes to forge a majority . It was a day of charged emotions , high tension and offstage thunder . As a violent_storm lashed the city , lightning struck Parliament not long before the Senate convened . Once mounting votes signaled his victory , Berlusconi sneaked_out of the Senate chamber for a_few minutes to join most other Italians in watching television as his soccer team , Milan , won a big_game , 4-0 , against Barcelona in Athens . The legislative victory means that , only a_few months after turning from business to politics , Berlusconi can now put into motion Italy ' s 53rd postwar government . It is the first to vigorously espouse private enterprise and free-market economics , and the first to include participation by heirs of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini . Addressing senators Wednesday , Berlusconi promised a vigorous legislative initiative to revitalize the Italian economy with tax relief , streamlined public administration and control of the public deficit . He reiterated his campaign promise to create 1 million jobs . Italy ' s relations with its West European partners and the United States loom large in the early stages of a Berlusconi administration that could last four years without a new election if he retains parliamentary support . On June 2 , President Clinton comes_to Rome for ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of World_War_II landings . In July , Clinton and leaders of the other Group of Seven industrialized nations return to Italy for a summit Berlusconi will host in Naples . Berlusconi told senators Wednesday that the coalition he had assembled was the only option for government . Failure to win parliamentary approval would mean new elections , he said . &quot; The majority of Italians have established with their vote that . . . this coalition has the honor and burden of government , &quot; he told a Senate in which most of the 315 members , like himself , are political rookies . A self-made billionaire , Berlusconi jumped into politics earlier this year to head_off what seemed at the time like certain victory in March elections by Italy ' s former Communists . Scandal had destroyed parties that dominated all 52 postwar governments , fueling a historic voter revolt . Campaigning on a strongly anti-Communist platform with the unabashed backing of his three national television channels , Berlusconi assembled an electoral alliance with the federalist Northern League under Umberto Bossi and the National Alliance , a neo-fascist movement headed by Gianfranco Fini . After the election , renegade Christian Democrats joined the coalition , which has a clear majority in the Chamber of Deputies , making a confidence vote there a formality . Debate in the lower house begins today and will parallel Senate discussion that underlined broad distrust with Berlusconi ' s neo-fascist allies . A demonstration by 200 young Nazis in the northern town of Vicenza on Sunday received big headlines . Italy ' s partners in the European Union are outspokenly concerned , although the United States has expressed no alarm . Berlusconi says he will have no truck with fascism . For his part , Fini is quick to distance himself from youthful extremists whose small but virulent demonstrations have brought controversy and dispute to a party he is seeking to pull_away from the extreme right . Senate debate Wednesday mirrored the alarm many Italians feel at any possible return of the kind of authoritarian regime that made the trains run_on time from 1922 to 1945 at great cost to personal and national freedom . &quot; We are facing not a renewal , but a return of fascists who are still heirs of a dictatorship that brought the country to war . . . . They are trying to show they are different but can ' t succeed however hard they try , &quot; Sen . Antonino Cuffaro charged Wednesday in announcing that Communist Refoundation , an assertively Marxist party , would join former Communists and centrists in voting against Berlusconi . Fini , 42 , a polished and well-spoken political veteran , says his movement is &quot; post-fascist &quot; and has proved its democratic credentials over the past four decades . Fini studiously avoids any contact with extreme right-wing movements elsewhere in Europe , and by comparison , his rhetoric and policies are moderate . But he has also said that he considers Mussolini the century ' s greatest statesman . &quot; It is impossible for me to vote for a government in which there are ministers who have not repudiated fascism , &quot; said Leo Valiani , an 85-year-old resistance hero who is one of Italy ' s nine life senators . He spent six years in a Mussolini jail . Five ministers of Berlusconi ' s Cabinet are members of the National Alliance that Fini forged to participate in the March election ; three of those five are also members of the Italian Social Movement . The MSI , as the party is known , was founded in 1946 as the lineal descendant of Mussolini ' s Fascist Party . After World_War_II , the constitution of the Italian republic banned the Fascist Party , forcing Mussolini ' s heirs to find a new name . In every legislature since 1972 , as a matter of principle , the MSI has automatically submitted an outsider ' s wish list of laws : One would rescind the constitutional prohibition against the formation of a Fascist Party by that name , another would lift a ban on the return to Italy of any member of the country ' s royal_family . With neo-fascists in government for the first time , the two proposals were supposed to have been held_back this year , but were mistakenly filed April 26 , MSI officials said . An embarrassed Fini ordered them withdrawn .</TEXT>
