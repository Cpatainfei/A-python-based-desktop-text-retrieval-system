   <HEADLINE> NO MORE ' RAH RAH RAH ' FOR THOMAS ; PRO BASKETBALL : PISTON GUARD RETIRES AT 33 , SAYING HE NO LONGER HAS THE ENERGY TO PLAY_AT HIS ACCUSTOMED LEVEL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Isiah Thomas , one of the best point guards in basketball history , made_it official Wednesday : It ' s time to let_go_of the game that has had such a powerful hold_on his life . Thomas , 33 , who led the Detroit Pistons to two NBA championships during 13 seasons in the league , announced his retirement at a news_conference packed with old teammates , friends and family . The announcement was a formality . Thomas had made_it clear he was finished when he tore his Achilles ' tendon April 19 . &quot; This is a special day , &quot; said Thomas , fingering a large NBA championship ring on his left_hand . &quot; The hardest thing for an athlete to do is to know when to quit . When do you let_go_of the thing that has shaped your entire life ? &quot; This basketball , it ' s so powerful . It ' s your whole life. &quot; It had been thought that Thomas would hold_off on his retirement until after July 1 to help the team ' s salary cap . But he and Bill Davidson , the Pistons ' managing partner , said that was wrong . The team would be limited to half of Thomas ' $ 2.52-million salary in either case , they said , because he is retiring . Only if Thomas were leaving to play for another team could the Pistons use his entire salary slot to sign other players . &quot; The Achilles ' injury wasn ' t the problem , &quot; Thomas said . &quot; I ' ll be walking next week . The thing that makes me good is the energy and intensity I can bring_to the game every night . &quot; I don ' t have that type of energy anymore . I don ' t have that rah , rah rah anymore . There ' s just no more energy left in my body. &quot; Thomas led the Pistons to NBA championships in 1989 and 1990 and scored more_than 18 # 000 points . NBA Commissioner David Stern called Thomas one of basketball ' s finest players . Thomas also was hailed by two recent retirees -- Magic Johnson and Larry Bird . &quot; He was a fierce competitor , leaving everything he had_on the court , &quot; Johnson said . Added Bird : &quot; To me , Isiah was one of the players who raised the level of competition in the NBA up another notch. &quot; It was thought the Pistons would offer Thomas a management position when he retired , but those plans are_on hold .
