   <HEADLINE> HOUSE , SENATE PANELS OK RIVAL HEALTH PLANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a major step_forward for the White_House , the House Ways and Means Committee Thursday became the third congressional panel to approve a bill designed to achieve President Clinton ' s goal of providing health_insurance for all Americans starting in 1998 . The Senate Finance_Committee , however , dealt a potentially devastating blow to Clinton ' s key proposal for universal coverage by rejecting any requirement that employers pay 80 % of workers ' insurance costs -- the so-called employer mandate . The conflicting votes foreshadowed a coming clash over the central issue in health reform -- the scope of coverage and how to pay_for it -- and the uphill struggle facing Clinton and his allies as they try to persuade a majority of the House and Senate to support the employer mandate . While even some ardent backers question whether the Ways and Means bill can pass the House in its present form , the hard-won , 20-18 endorsement by the influential panel provided some needed momentum for the President ' s drive for universal coverage . Clinton called the bill ' s approval &quot; a giant stride forward on_the_road to comprehensive health_care &quot; while White_House aides minimized the setback for the Administration by the Senate Finance panel . At the same time , the President strongly attacked a rival plan put_forward by Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) and 38 other Republican senators . The criticism came at a meeting with small business_leaders at the White_House . &quot; It does a little bit for the poor , it leaves all_the powerful vested_interest groups with everything they ' ve got and it walks away from the middle_class and small business , &quot; the President said of the GOP alternative , which would attempt to make health_insurance more accessible through incentives . &quot; It is politics as usual. &quot; Rep . Sam Gibbons ( D-Fla. ) , acting chairman of the Ways and Means panel , said the committee ' s bill , which would provide coverage of nearly all Americans by 1998 and pay_for it mostly by requiring employers and their employees to bear the cost , is an historic breakthrough . &quot; This bill will guarantee from birth to death . . . that all Americans will never lose their health_care , &quot; Gibbons said after the vote . House Democratic leaders are expected to combine Gibbons ' legislation with a similar measure approved by the House Education and Labor Committee and schedule a health_care showdown in the full_House for late July . In the Senate Finance_Committee , however , a strong majority balked at imposing an employer mandate -- even as a fallback -- if other measures do not succeed in achieving virtually universal coverage . All nine Republicans and five Democrats joined to strike that provision from a draft bill proposed by Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) on a 14-6 vote . Instead , the committee voted , 12 to 8 , for an approach put_forward by a group of moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats that would set_up a government commission to make recommendations for expanding coverage if 95 % of all Americans did not have health_insurance by the year 2002 . The employer mandate is the linchpin of the Clinton plan and its chief means of assuring universal coverage . However , many business groups have fought it strenuously , arguing that it would force smaller firms to lay off workers or shut_down completely . Whether the provision can be resurrected on the Senate floor is unclear but its rejection would limit the number of people who could be included in any health reform plan . &quot; It ' s an oxymoron to say you ' re for universal coverage and not ( for ) a mandate , &quot; said Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) , whose Labor and Human Resources Committee also passed a version of health_care reform this month . But Dole rejected any kind of mandate , saying : &quot; The bottom_line is that this is a tax. &quot; The President ' s allies , however , argued that &quot; shared responsibility &quot; -- their more palatable term for the employer mandate -- is at the heart of health reform . &quot; No one should be misled , &quot; said Sen . Thomas A . Daschle ( D-S.D. ) . &quot; The alternative to shared responsibility is more responsibility on the family itself. &quot; The finance panel also voted , 11 to 9 , to drop Moynihan ' s cost containment plan that would require the government to set annual goals for increases in private health premiums but leave it up_to Congress to decide what to do if prices were to rise faster . It substituted a proposal , bitterly fought by organized labor , that would impose stiff taxes on health plans that are more costly than the average for their localities . Meantime , another threat to House passage loomed as 35 House Democrats said that they would oppose any health_care legislation that paid_for elective abortions , according to the National Right_to_Life Committee Inc. Assuming that most if not all_of the 178 House Republicans would vote against a Clinton-backed health_care bill , this group of Democrats could be crucial to the bill ' s chances in the House . Despite potential obstacles , however , the Ways and Means Committee met its goal of approving comprehensive health_care legislation before Congress ' 4th of July recess . Here are key provisions of the bill approved Thursday : * All employers would be required to pay 80 % of the cost of health_insurance for employees , who would be required to pay the other 20 % . Tax_credits would lower costs for small firms with fewer than 50 workers , while businesses with more_than 250 employees could decide to self-insure their work_force . * A tax increase on cigarettes of 45 cents a pack would be gradually phased_in and a 2 % tax on health_insurance premiums would be imposed on insurance_companies to help pay_for the plan . In addition , the rate_of_growth in Medicare and Medicaid costs would be slowed in future years by limiting outlays . * For those who do not work , a new government program to be called Medicare Part C would be set_up to provide health benefits . Persons now receiving Medicaid also would be placed in this program . * Medicare beneficiaries would be only slightly affected , although they would receive coverage for out-patient prescription_drugs , colorectal screenings and additional mental_health benefits . A new co-payment of 20 % for home health services would be established to pay_for the added benefits . * Health plans would not be allowed to deny coverage to anyone , to cancel coverage , to exclude those with pre-existing conditions or to charge higher premiums to people because they are older or because of their medical_histories . * The standard benefit package would include coverage for hospital and out-patient services , including prescription_drugs , mental_health and substance_abuse treatments , although there would be some co-payments or deductibles . * Those covered would be able to select a plan that would include choice of doctors , including those covered by Medicare Part C . * An overall cap on out-of-pocket payments of $ 5 # 500 a year for individuals and $ 11 # 000 for families would start in the year 2003 . * Health_insurance would have to be provided in three categories -- for individuals , single parents and couples with_children . Ways and Means experts estimated that health_insurance would cost workers between $ 35 and $ 95 a month , depending_on family status . * Employers ' payments would range from $ 1.71 an hour for an individual to $ 4.53 an hour for a family . * Everyone below a certain income level -- approximately $ 16 # 800 for an individual and $ 24 # 000 for a family of three -- would receive federal help in paying premiums . Some low-income people receiving welfare benefits would not have to pay_for insurance_premiums . * Self-employed people would be able to take a tax_deduction for 80 % of the cost of their health_insurance , compared to 25 % allowed under current law .</TEXT>
