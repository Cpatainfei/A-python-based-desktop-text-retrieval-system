The endorsement of Herzog , 59 , comes almost exactly two months after Kohl ' s hand-picked candidate for the German presidency , the little-known eastern German politician Steffen Heitmann , succumbed to public criticism following a series of gaffs and withdrew from the race . The endorsement of both Kohl ' s Christian Democrats and the Bavaria-based Christian Socialist Union will give Herzog , a respected jurist , the inside_track to win the indirect presidential election next May 23 .</TEXT>
