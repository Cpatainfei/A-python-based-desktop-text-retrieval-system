   <HEADLINE> O.C. JET CRASH PROMPTS WAKE TURBULENCE PLAN ; AVIATION : FEDERAL SAFETY BOARD URGES LENGTHENED LANDING DISTANCES BETWEEN PLANES , NEW WEIGHT CLASSES FOR CRAFT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday approved a detailed set of recommendations designed to prevent airplane accidents caused by wake turbulence from Boeing 757 jetliners -- the presumed culprit in a Dec . 15 crash in Santa Ana that claimed five lives . The board ' s action sent a strong message to the Federal Aviation Administration that the minimum distances between landing airplanes should be lengthened and that its 20-year-old weight-classification system for larger aircraft be overhauled to reflect a new generation of commercial jetliners . The board also urged that air-traffic controllers provide more detailed information to pilots about wake turbulence and that training manuals be updated to emphasize the dangers of such airborne encounters -- particularly when the trailing plane is smaller and more vulnerable to the miniature cyclones produced by rapid air movement across the larger aircraft ' s wings . NTSB records show that 51 instances of wake turbulence have occurred over the last decade , killing 27 people and damaging or destroying 40 airplanes . Because it could potentially decrease the number of flights at an airport , the FAA has been reluctant to increase separation distances between 757s and trailing aircraft . But only a week after the crash of the corporate jet in Santa Ana two months ago , FAA Administrator David Hinson issued a directive requiring air-traffic controllers nationwide to warn pilots of the turbulence caused by 757s . The safety board ' s action on Tuesday , though not binding on the FAA , is expected to put more pressure on federal regulators to adopt the preventive procedures adopted unanimously by the board ' s five commissioners . FAA spokesman Paul Steucke said the agency would review the NTSB recommendations &quot; immediately. &quot; &quot; We ' re aware of the problem and we ' re taking measures to make_sure there is not another occurrence , &quot; Steucke said . The fatal_accident in Santa Ana occurred when a twin-engine corporate jet was_on a landing_approach to John Wayne Airport . The jet , which was about two miles behind a Boeing 757 , went_out of control and slammed nose first into the ground near the Santa Ana Auto Mall . All five aboard , including the top two executives of the In-N-Out Burger chain , were killed . Four other incidents attributed to 757 turbulence have occurred in the past 14 months , including a Dec . 18 , 1992 , crash in Billings , Mont. , that killed eight people . Despite the long list of safety recommendations , NTSB commissioners did not cite any particular flaw in the 757 ' s design . The heart of the problem , they said , was revising the FAA ' s plane-classification system to ensure the proper separation between airplanes . &quot; There may be some unique characteristics of the 757 , &quot; said Commissioner John . K . Lauber , &quot; . . . but it is clear that the fundamental problem goes_back to the outdated weight-categorization scheme that needs to be fixed. &quot; The board found that &quot; inadequacies in the current airplane weight classification scheme . . . air control procedures . . . and pilot knowledge . . . of wake vortices were more important factors_in the five recent accidents investigated by the Safety Board than any specific characteristic of the B-757 wake vortex. &quot; Under the present system , the 757 is considered a &quot; large &quot; aircraft , but industry experts have previously urged the FAA to reclassify it as a &quot; heavy &quot; aircraft and require most smaller planes to stay five miles back on final approach , as opposed to the three miles they are supposed to adhere to now . The safety board on Tuesday took action on both fronts . It recommended that the separation distances be lengthened for smaller planes trailing 757s -- even for jetliners such_as Boeing 737s , MD-80s and DC-9s . And it also urged that the three-tiered U.S. airplane weight-classification system be revised to narrow the weight ranges_in some categories . Under present U.S. rules , the 757 is the heaviest aircraft in the middle-weight class . Although it didn ' t specifically say so , the board seemed to be leaning toward a version of the_British system that divides aircraft into four weight categories . Peter Murray , a veteran airline pilot who regularly flies 757s , said he believes the FAA should adopt the NTSB guidelines -- at least until turbulence testing on the 757 is completed . &quot; If they can relax the separation standards later , fine , &quot; Murray said . &quot; But for now , safety should come first. &quot; The safety board also recommended that 757s and other large aircraft conduct landings on a more standard flight_path angle . The board ' s study of wake turbulence showed that trailing airplanes are in more danger of being thrown_out of control when they fall below the larger plane ' s descending flight_path . Because 757s and other newer jets can slow_down quicker than older jetliners , trailing aircraft can inadvertently close_in too quickly and wind_up in this danger_zone . NTSB staff_members made_it clear that maintaining a higher relative position to larger landing aircraft was the key preventive factor . &quot; The flight_path is ( the ) critical factor ) , but maintaining proper distance is the best solution , &quot; said John Clark , an aircraft performance specialist for the board . The commissioners also recommended : * Certain air-control procedures be amended to give pilots more information about the planes landing in front of them , especially if the leading plane is a 757 or &quot; heavy &quot; aircraft . * Wake-turbulence warnings be issued more frequently . * Training of pilots and air controllers include more detailed study of wake-turbulence dangers . * Manufacturers be required to determine the wake vortex characteristics during aircraft certification procedures . During discussion of the wake-turbulence issue , several new facts emerged about the Santa Ana crash . The 757 was at 5 # 000 feet , Clark said , and had to make a sharply banked turn_to the right in_order to make its approach to John Wayne Airport . The Westwind corporate jet was at 4 # 000 feet and was heading straight in . The Westwind jet was traveling faster than the 757 , but the smaller craft ' s pilot intended to stay safely above the larger craft , Clark said . &quot; The geometry of the flight_paths , rather than the speed difference &quot; was the critical factor , said Clark . Because landing clearances were issued to both planes in a short space of time , &quot; the primary effect was to lose separation , &quot; Clark said . Instead of staying far enough behind , the smaller jet was actually closing on the 757 , Clark said . Tests have indicated that the 757 ' s sleek wing design makes_it capable of producing wake turbulence more powerful than that caused by aircraft four times its size . The NTSB ' s recommendations &quot; all make_sense to me , &quot; said William Reynard , head of the nation ' s Aviation Safety Reporting System , which noted an increase in 757 turbulence-related incidents in January , 1993 , and , shortly thereafter , alerted the FAA . &quot; The process of looking_at incidents in_order to prevent accidents is very valuable , &quot; he said . &quot; You don ' t have to have an accident first. &quot; Leo Garodz , a former FAA manager who was one of the first to bring the 757 turbulence problem to the FAA ' s attention in 1991 , applauded the NTSB recommendations -- some of which were identical to ones he and co-researcher Kirk Clawson submitted to the FAA in a formal report three years ago . &quot; People at times don ' t listen unless you have a Ph.D , &quot; said Garodz , an ex-fighter pilot who worked in the FAA ' s wake turbulence department for 20 years . &quot; It ' s frustrating . &quot; But this is great . I agree with all_of them , &quot; he said . &quot; If the NTSB is right , &quot; said Christopher Fotos , editor of Avmark , a Washington-based airline industry newsletter , &quot; this is a very serious problem . The FAA may have a hard_time . . . dismissing it. &quot; The NTSB commissioners took nearly three hours to pore over the staff report and fine-tune its recommendations . One recommendation was eliminated altogether , and the board , at one point , was inclined to meld several technical points into a more general recommendation . But staff_members worried that the FAA would not respond as vigorously to the broader language . Commissioner Lauber agreed . &quot; We could receive the classic bureaucratic response : ' We already have the proper rules , if they were just followed we would n ' t have accidents. ' &quot; Aviation officials in Canada and the United Kingdom have already implemented similar recommendations on the 757 .</TEXT>
