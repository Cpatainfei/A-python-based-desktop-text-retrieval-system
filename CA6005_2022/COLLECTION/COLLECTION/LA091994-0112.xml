   <HEADLINE> DIRECTOR OF REAGAN LIBRARY HAS PASSION FOR THE PRESIDENCY ; SIMI VALLEY : RICHARD NORTON SMITH HAS DRAWN PRAISE AND CRITICISM FOR HIS POPULAR , SOMETIMES FLASHY EXHIBITS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Richard Norton Smith was 5 years old , he knew all_the words to &quot; Hail to the Chief , &quot; he knew that the President of the United States was Dwight D . Eisenhower , and he knew that both he and the President were Republicans . A self-described &quot; presidential freak , &quot; Smith , now 40 , is the director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library , director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation , and director of the Ronald Reagan Center for Public Affairs . Other presidential library directors have backgrounds rooted in academia , but Smith said his rise to the job as head of the nation ' s second-largest presidential library is an outgrowth of his near-obsession with the men who have occupied the Oval Office . &quot; I ' m not an academic or a professional archivist , and I don ' t have a Ph.D. , &quot; he said . &quot; But I do care passionately about the presidency . I don ' t know , maybe it was inevitable . . . that I would end_up here. &quot; Described by both admirers and detractors as the &quot; P.T. Barnum &quot; of presidential library directors , Smith has earned a reputation for enlivening the institutions he has worked for with popular , sometimes flashy exhibits and conferences . He was lured away from the Herbert Hoover Library in Iowa by the Reagans last year . The Reagans wanted to tap into the energy Smith had shown while revitalizing the Hoover Library , which many agreed had become staid before he arrived . By 1988 , only a year after taking the helm , Smith was able to double attendance there , according to Timothy Walch , who served as Smith ' s assistant director . &quot; While ( Smith ) was here he was always innovating -- he was the balloon and I was his tether , &quot; said Walch , who is acting director at the Hoover Library . &quot; The Reagans didn ' t want a mausoleum to Reagan ' s past . They wanted something exciting and dynamic . that ' s why they got Richard. &quot; But Smith ' s management style has turned_off some of the foundation ' s original board_members , who say they had hoped the library would become a place for serious debate on current public policy issues . Instead , they say Smith has encouraged events such_as a presidential look-alike contest , and an exhibit on First_Ladies , which one former board_member referred to as a fashion show . &quot; The opportunities that have been missed are just tragic , &quot; said Martin Anderson , a founding board_member of the Reagan Foundation who worked with Reagan as an adviser through several campaigns and in the Reagan White_House during the early 1980s . Smith and his assistants are &quot; just not a player &quot; in the intellectual arena , Anderson said . &quot; They aren ' t out there continuing what Reagan started . There are a whole range of issues -- foreign affairs , economic_policy , tax_policy , welfare reform , nuclear proliferation -- that were important during the Reagan revolution , and they ' re simply not dealing with them. &quot; Smith himself acknowledges that his style and the direction he has set for the Reagan Library have disappointed some people . But he defended the library ' s record for taking_on issues of substance under his tenure . He cited the prominent speakers who have visited over the last six months as part of the Reagan Forum series . And more such events are planned , he said . A two-day conference set for October , &quot; What ' s Wrong with American Politics ? , &quot; will feature panel_discussions with such famous politicians and pundits as David Gergen , John McLaughlin , George McGovern , Robert Novak , Margaret Tutweiler , James Carville and Mary Matalin . There are also plans to sponsor a fellowship program to help scholars studying the Reagan era , and to hold more conferences early next year on such topics as the demise of newspapers in the United States . &quot; The strength of the presidential library system is its diversity , &quot; Smith said . &quot; The libraries reflect the personalities of the individual Presidents they were built for . We ' re creating something distinctive here . Ronald Reagan did not become President by listening to elites . He succeeded by doing the unconventional . He and Nancy wanted something that was not a conventional think_tank or an ivory_tower . They wanted something that would attract people. &quot; Smith says the library has to compete for a limited pool of entertainment money with the_likes_of Six Flags Magic Mountain , museums in Los Angeles and the large multiplex cinemas across the region . So he challenges the notions some may have of what is acceptable at a presidential library in an attempt to bring more people into the institution . One of his regular refrains is , &quot; History is too important to leave to the historians. &quot; Smith said he aims to attract to the library the speakers and events that create news . He said the First_Ladies exhibit presented during the summer was a good_example of mixing the popular_with the historical . The exhibit featured hundreds of items , including Martha Washington ' s petticoat and Hillary Rodham Clinton ' s law_degree . Smith said it was a way of teaching history through individuals . &quot; There is an enormous number of people out there that want to experience the history of their country , &quot; he said . &quot; One of the ways to do that is to personalize it , to show the impact of an individual . As a biographer , that ' s what ' s always interested me. &quot; Some of the criticism of Smith ' s background give short_shrift to his scholarly accomplishments . After graduating from Harvard , where he studied government and American history , Smith spent several years in Washington working as a speech writer for politicians , including Gov . Pete Wilson , who was a U.S. senator at the time ; former Sen . Edward Brooke of Massachusetts ; Sen . Robert Dole ; Elizabeth Dole , the former secretary_of_transportation and labor ; and former Vice_President Dan Quayle and his wife , Marilyn . He has written several books , including the biography , &quot; Thomas E . Dewey and His Times , &quot; one of three finalists in its category for the 1983 Pulitzer Prize . His biography of Herbert Hoover , published in 1984 , led to a speech presented at the Hoover Library . The speech so impressed administrators there that they asked Smith to serve as director , said John Fawcett , assistant archivist for the National Archives in Washington , and the man who hired Smith for the job . &quot; I think that has to be the best hiring decision I ' ve ever made , &quot; Fawcett said . &quot; I don ' t think he could be described as anything but a resounding success. &quot; For about a year , Smith was director of both the Hoover Library and the Eisenhower Library in Abilene , Kan . He organized a celebration for the centennial of Eisenhower ' s birth there and , as Smith did at the Hoover Library , he emphasized the personal side of Eisenhower ' s life . The exhibit impressed the Reagans , Fawcett said . As long as he can remember , Smith said he has felt a personal connection to the office of the President , a connection he believes everyone has , in one way or another . He still remembers sitting in front of the television at age 5 , watching a children ' s program hosted by &quot; Big Brother &quot; Bob Emory on WBRZ-TV in Boston . At the start of each show Smith would join along with the host , holding_up a glass of milk and toasting a portrait of Eisenhower while singing &quot; Hail to the Chief. &quot; At 6 , he persuaded his parents to let him stay_up until midnight while the returns were counted in the 1960 presidential election . &quot; I remember my little world crumbling when it looked_like that mean man John F . Kennedy was going_to beat the good Richard Nixon , &quot; he said with a laugh . &quot; I have since moderated my opinion of JFK. &quot; Smith is at_a_loss to explain what possessed him at such an early age and continues to compel him to collect such memorabilia as autographs from every single President . &quot; The first ( signature ) I collected was Calvin_Coolidge as a freshman in college , &quot; he said . &quot; The first signature I got of a President-to-be was Richard Nixon . I wrote him as an 11-year-old when he was a lawyer in New York . He wrote back and signed the letter ' Best wishes in the years ahead. ' I still cherish that to this day. &quot; Ronald Reagan helped Smith complete his collection by asking President Clinton for his autograph last year . Smith has the autographed picture -- depicting Clinton and Reagan standing in the White_House -- framed on his office wall . Smith , who grew_up an only child in the Massachusetts hamlet of Townsend , about 45 miles from Boston , said he did not inherit his passion for politics from his parents . His mother worked as a nurse and his father labored in a factory , so Smith spent most of his time with his grandparents , who ingrained their deep-rooted patriotism in him . His favorite holiday has always been the Fourth_of_July . Smith describes himself as a liberal Republican , &quot; one of the last rock ' n ' roll Republicans. &quot; In 1968 , while a whole generation around him was protesting , Smith , just 14 at the time , went_to the Republican convention in Miami . A die-hard Nelson Rockefeller supporter , he remembers hitting a Nixon delegate from Iowa over the head with a sign during a heated demonstration on the convention floor . &quot; That was Rocky ' s last chance , &quot; he said . &quot; I guess I got carried away. &quot; Despite his politics , he lists many Democrats among his favorite Presidents . In the late 1960s , Smith said he admired Lyndon B . Johnson . When Johnson died while Smith was a student at Harvard , he remembers being terribly saddened . &quot; I think that was a great lesson for me about the unique place that Presidents have in our individual and collective conscience , &quot; he said . &quot; He was a mountain of a man , a truly tragic figure. &quot; Smith seems most content when talking_about the past , when recounting an obscure moment from the lives of historical figures , details he says might range from the compelling to the pathetic . &quot; I suppose it just makes them more human , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s like with an autograph . You see the movements of their hand and they suddenly seem human and real . that ' s what history is to me. &quot;</TEXT>
