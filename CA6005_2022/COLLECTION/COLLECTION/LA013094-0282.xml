   <HEADLINE> QUAKE-RELATED OIL SPILL ' S IMPACT WORSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More oil from an earthquake-ruptured pipeline oozed into the Santa Clara River than initially believed , causing a deadly impact on the area ' s wildlife . So far , the carcasses of 65 oiled birds , reptiles and mammals have been found in the ecologically sensitive area.But biologists say many small birds such_as finches , gnatcatchers , vireos and orioles that die from the oil by ingestion or hypothermia will fly away and not be found . Additionally , larger birds_of_prey that feed_on oiled fish or rodents or become sullied with oiled feathers often fly miles from the site before they are overcome with illness . &quot; This spill is having a greater effect on wildlife than the numbers of dead_animals indicate , &quot; Bob Schlichting , a spokesman for the Department of Fish and Game , said Friday . &quot; We may never get the numbers of all_the affected birds . The oil escaped_from an Atlantic Richfield Co . pipeline in Valencia that ruptured in the 6.6-magnitude earthquake on Jan . 17 and traveled down a 12-mile stretch of the Santa Clara River .</TEXT>
