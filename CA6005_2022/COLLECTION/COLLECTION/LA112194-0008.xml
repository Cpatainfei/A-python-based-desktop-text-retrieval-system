   <TEXT> ELLYN MAYBE Poet , Los Angeles This Thanksgiving I ' m thankful for a lot of things . Some of them have to do with the Jan . 17 earthquake . I was living_in Chatsworth with my mom when it hit . She was blocked inside her room and at first when I called her she couldn ' t hear me and didn ' t answer , so I freaked_out . Then she answered and I knew she was all_right . Our walls had tons of cracks and the carport collapsed on our car . Some neighbors helped us get_it out . For several days I was afraid they would n ' t let me go_back inside to get my poetry . I didn ' t have copies of a lot of it and I don ' t know what I would have done if I ' d lost_it . Finally after several days all_of us in my building were given permission to evacuate all our possessions immediately . Our building was condemned . I ' m grateful my mom and I lived through the earthquake , and I ' m especially thankful I was able to save my poetry , because if I couldn ' t it would have been like some sort of death . I ' m also thankful that I ' ve found kindred spirits in the artistic community here . Their love and concern is the major reason we decided to stay in Los Angeles while so many others who were hard-hit by the quake moved away . SIMA ROSS Real_estate sales , Encino As an immigrant American from Iran , I have much to be thankful for about the opportunities of this fantastic , young and prosperous land and the freedom it offers , not only for me but for my family , my friends and my people . Every year Thanksgiving reminds me there is hope . My first year in America as a student in 1974 , an older American lady took me to a Thanksgiving party . Since then every year I make a traditional American Thanksgiving dinner : a big turkey , corn , yams , and pumpkin_pie for dessert . Thanksgiving is the only holiday where my heart is in it . I have very strong sentiments for Iran , my mother is Russian , and I am Jewish . But if there is any land I would fight for , it is America . CHHENG HEAT LEAO Health coordinator , Cambodian Family Agency , Santa Ana I feel very thankful to the American people for letting my family be in this country , and thankful to everyone who welcomed us . I came here in 1981 . Although I am a Buddhist , I used to go_up to a church nearby and help them fix things , because it is my attitude to help people . My first year here the pastor invited my family to his home for Thanksgiving . I am also happy I can help other Cambodians coming here . And I have contributed to help homeless Americans at Thanksgiving . I bring my family together for dinner . I have six children and three grandchildren . We have a turkey prepared in the Cambodian way , with spicy curry and coconut and a stuffing of soybean noodles , mushrooms and peanuts . I tell the children about the Pilgrims and Indians and compare this to Cambodia . Because it is the Cambodian way to always welcome people from far away and to offer them food , like the Indians did for the Pilgrims . LUCIA ALEXANDER Operatic singer , singing teacher , Los Angeles I ' m thankful for having the joy of music and the joy of sharing it with others through teaching and singing . I began singing when I was five , standing on a corner in front of the Los Angeles gas_station owned by my parents . People would come_by and say &quot; Isn ' t she cute ? &quot; and give me a penny or a nickel . I studied music in high_school and later with private teachers . My Italian singing teacher once said to me : &quot; An angel has breathed on your throat ! &quot; But then I got_married , had four children and worked in accounting and real_estate . I missed music . After I got divorced , I eventually got_back to singing . Music is such a joy ; it ' s like medicine to me . I love to watch people ' s faces light_up when I begin to sing . It ' s as if waves of love are coming_back from the energy that ' s sent_out by performing . I feel my voice is a gift from God so I ' m thankful for being able to share my music . PAUL CHODAS Astronomer , Jet_Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena I ' m thankful that I and my colleague Don Yeomans were involved in the once-in-a-lifetime event when the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet hit the planet Jupiter in July . I ' m thankful it was discovered a year before it hit , so we had time to prepare . Don and I were at the center of predicting for the rest of the scientific community when and where each of its 21 fragments would hit . About a dozen astronomers around the world measured the comet ' s position and gave us its coordinates so we could tell how fast the pieces were going . Our predictions weren ' t perfect : We were off an average of seven minutes for all 21 . There were arguments about the size of the fragments ; many astronomers thought the whole_thing would be a big fizzle . But Don and I predicted the impacts would be much bigger , and it turned_out we were right . Of course , we ' re thankful for that . If the fragments had hit the Earth it would have been a global catastrophe , causing the death of much of the population of the world . So all_of us can be thankful they didn ' t .
