   <HEADLINE> HOME ENTERTAINMENT ; JOHN WAYNE AMBLES IN FROM THE DESERT AS ' HONDO '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The well of John Wayne movies not available on video is just about dry . * Wayne is one of the biggest attractions in the home video market . Of his 152 movies -- from the late-1920s to the mid-1970s -- 114 are_on tape . But after &quot; Hondo , &quot; the 1953 Western that just came_out on MPI at $ 20 , there ' s not much left -- mainly some of his pre-1940 B-movies . And it seemed like &quot; Hondo , &quot; rumored to be_on the verge of release for years , would never come_out . Michael Wayne , son of the late star and president of Batjac Productions Inc. -- which has the rights to &quot; Hondo &quot; -- explained why it took so_long to release the movie . &quot; We were waiting for the right time -- and the time never seemed right , &quot; he said . &quot; I was waiting for a time when Westerns were more popular , which has happened after ' Dances With Wolves ' and ' Unforgiven , ' and for a time when none of his other movies were being released by other companies like Fox or Warner or Republic . But last February I said , ' It ' s coming_out this fall , no matter what. ' &quot; Research showed that fans were eager for &quot; Hondo. &quot; But that demand had been somewhat orchestrated . One of Batjac ' s tactics was to keep it off TV , so fans would n ' t take it for granted -- or tape it . &quot; I never put it into syndication , &quot; Wayne said . &quot; It ' s only been shown four or five times on TV . I wanted interest and demand to build up. &quot; To make the film more attractive to finicky contemporary audiences , Wayne put &quot; Hondo &quot; through a meticulous restoration process , so it ' s one of the best-looking classic movies on the market . And what about another aspect of &quot; Hondo &quot; that might disturb many of today ' s fans -- the fact that this Western , like nearly all from those days , was not politically correct with_respect_to Native_Americans ? &quot; It ' s much more sympathetic toward Indians than most movies of that era , &quot; Wayne insisted . &quot; The Hondo character was half-Indian and was married to an Indian . He had great respect and admiration for the good Apache chief . But then another chief takes_over , and that ' s where the problems of the political correctness sort start. &quot; Though &quot; Hondo &quot; isn ' t exactly PC , retailers don ' t expect that to hamper sales . Wayne said that MPI has shipped 750 # 000 copies to stores , a whopping amount for a 41-year-old movie . The next John Wayne movie to come_out , &quot; The High and the Mighty , &quot; will probably do even better . This exciting 1954 drama , featuring Wayne as the pilot of an airplane in jeopardy , has wider appeal than &quot; Hondo , &quot; which will attract mostly male action fans . Michael Wayne said that this one , which has been_on TV even less frequently than &quot; Hondo , &quot; will be out sometime next year . After &quot; The High and the Mighty , &quot; the most prominent Wayne movie not on video will be a routine drama from 1953 , &quot; Island in the Sky , &quot; one of his least interesting ' 50s movies . Michael Wayne is working_on another project -- transferring &quot; Hondo , &quot; which was originally in the old 3-D format , into what he says will be the first full-length color 3-D laser disc . The disc , due in March and priced somewhere between $ 75 and $ 100 , will be made through a new digital process and will feature trailers , outtakes and a commentary track . The package will also include 3-D glasses as well as a second laser disc , the standard &quot; flat &quot; version for those who don ' t want to bother with 3-D . Foreign Films There has been a flurry of fine high-profile foreign-language movies released in the past month , which is unusual since sometimes there may be only one or two such movies every few months . It started about a month ago with &quot; Like Water for Chocolate , &quot; one of the most popular foreign films ever released in this country . Just out this week is FoxVideo ' s engaging , clever farce &quot; The Wedding Banquet , &quot; about a gay male couple -- one is American , the other Taiwanese -- living_in Manhattan . When the parents of the Taiwanese , who don ' t know their son is gay , come_to visit , he stages a fake wedding with a female artist . Chinese director Chen Kaige ' s &quot; Farewell My Concubine &quot; ( Miramax ) is an entertaining epic , covering a period from the 1920s to the ' 70s , that recounts the volatile relationship between two male performers in the Peking Opera . Though the characterizations aren ' t as vivid as they might be , it ' s still a fascinating tale . What ' s New On Video : &quot; Bad Girls &quot; ( FoxVideo ) . In this feminist Western , none of the bad girls seem very bad . Four prostitutes ( Madeleine Stowe , Andie MacDowell , Mary Stuart Masterson and Drew Barrymore ) want to open a respectable business in Oregon but have to shoot their way past a gang of vicious outlaws . &quot; Surviving the Game &quot; ( New Line ) . A homeless man ( Ice-T ) is the prey at a swank retreat were hunters pay big money to track and kill humans . This is a good , grisly action film , co-starring Rutger Hauer and Gary Busey , who proves once again that he plays coldblooded villains as well as any actor in the business . Same plot as the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie &quot; Hard Target. &quot; &quot; Bitter Moon &quot; ( New Line ) . On a long ocean cruise , a wheelchair-bound writer ( Peter Coyote ) captivates a couple ( Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott-Thomas ) with lurid tales of his kinky past . The film , directed by Roman Polanski , may work for those with a taste for the totally offbeat .</TEXT>
