   <HEADLINE> ROBIN ABCARIAN : CIGARETTES NOT ADDICTIVE ? OR CANCER-CAUSING ? UH-HUH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Broccoli and tobacco , two of our most controversial plants , were in the news again last week . I don ' t know which is more disgusting . On the veggie front , medical researchers at Johns Hopkins University announced that a compound in broccoli blocks the growth of tumors in rats exposed to a carcinogen . Too_bad for our broccoli-hating former President , I thought . Or maybe not , since all your cruciferous veggies do the job -- your cauliflower , your Brussels_sprouts , your cabbage . But good news for people at high-risk of developing cancer . On the tobacco front , the chief_executives of seven American tobacco companies were hauled before a testy , virulently anti-smoking Rep . Henry Waxman and his House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment in Washington , D.C. They came_to answer questions about whether nicotine is added_to cigarettes to ensure the continuing patronage of smokers through addiction . ( Of course not ! said the Marlboro Men , who said they sometimes blend higher-nicotine with lower-nicotine tobacco , but only for flavor . ) My world_view has always been this : Broccoli is good_for_you . Tobacco is bad . I have felt confident in this , certain that no new scientific evidence would turn_up any time soon contradicting the broccoli-tobacco dichotomy . And none has , despite the slick , all-out efforts of the Cigarette Seven . * Waxman was hellbent -- as only a politician on the popular side of a public-policy debate can be -- on getting the tobacco men to admit that the business in which they are engaged is nefarious , dangerous , sneaky . . . and may even result in bad breath . ( OK , I made_up that last part. ) The tobacco men were not about to go_down without a fight . For entertainment value , the hearing didn ' t have the feel-good potential of , say , &quot; Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , &quot; but it was a whole_lot funnier in a darkly comic way . More John Waters than Walt Disney . When Waxman asked the CEOs one by one whether they believe cigarettes to be addictive , the answers were predictable : Seven little ix - nays all_in a row . Now , many of us have some experience with cigarettes and addiction . Even more of us are familiar_with the dynamics of the coping phenomenon known as denial . Denial is when your kid tells you that the birth_control_pills / crack pipe / marijuana you found in her drawer belong_to her best_friend . . . and you believe her . Denial is when your husband comes_home stinking drunk , sporting lipstick on his collar , and tells you that he must have brushed_up against someone in an elevator . . . and you believe him . Denial is when seven grown men sit in front of a congressional panel and tell the American people that they do not believe cigarettes cause lung_cancer or emphysema , although they would all prefer that their children not smoke . Denial is when the president of U.S. Tobacco , Joseph Taddeo , is told that people who use snuff are 50 times more likely to develop oral cancer than people who do not , and moments later , with a straight_face , states : &quot; Oral tobacco has not been established as a cause of mouth cancer. &quot; And the moon , as studies funded by the tobacco_industry have shown , is made of green cheese . * Other unsavory bits of information floated out of last week ' s hearings like someone else ' s ashes drifting onto your plate . The head of R.J. Reynolds , James Johnston , said he was very sorry_for the Joe Camel ad that proposed a way for young_men to meet potential love interests : Drag women swimmers from the water , pretending to think the women are drowning . &quot; It was offensive , &quot; Johnston said . &quot; It was stupid . We do make mistakes. &quot; How many mistakes ? Oh , lots . . . . The head of Philip Morris U.S.A. , maker of Marlboro , testified that he had blocked publication of a company study supporting the contention that nicotine is addictive . An executive from Lorillard Tobacco Co. , maker of True , Kent and Newport , disclosed that he recently gave Congress bafflingly incorrect data . In March , he told the very same subcommittee that the nicotine levels in cigarettes had dropped 10 % since 1982 . Last week , he admitted that he had erred , and that nicotine levels had actually risen by more_than 10 % since 1982 . How did the error occur ? &quot; I don ' t know , &quot; he replied , scientifically . But for the fact that denial is such a potent survival tool -- and they are fighting for survival -- one is sorely tempted to call the tobacco executives , oh , disingenuous . &quot; Every time a kid lights_up , we get blamed , &quot; sniffed Donald Johnson , head of American Tobacco Co. , which makes Lucky Strike , Pall Mall and Tareyton . Tobacco_industry officials , who said last week that cigarette additives include ammonia and insecticide -- but , incredibly , not broccoli -- want to protect children , not harm them . Johnston of R.J. Reynolds pointed_out that if cigarettes are banned on the grounds they are too dangerous to be sold , &quot; People will be selling cigarettes out of the trunks of cars , cigarettes made by who knows who , made of who knows what. &quot; Back-alley cigarettes . For someone else ' s kids .</TEXT>
