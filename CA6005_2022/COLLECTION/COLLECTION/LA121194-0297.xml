   <HEADLINE> JUST WHAT WENT_WRONG IN BOSNIA ? ALMOST EVERYTHING ; BALKANS : THE WORLD ' S NOBLE INTENTIONS PROVED NO MATCH FOR THE HARD REALITIES OF AN UNFORGIVING REGION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was the first day of summer , 1991 , when Secretary_of_State James A . Baker III flew to Belgrade for a look_at Yugoslavia on the brink . Frustrated European Community diplomats had already failed to find a formula for keeping the country together . But here was a superpower ' s emissary , the man who had just helped manage the end of the Cold_War , shape German unification and assemble the international army that had crushed Saddam Hussein ' s finest in the Iraqi desert . But this time , Baker kept his distance . He met with the presidents of each of the Yugoslav federation ' s six constituent republics for an hour . He warned them that &quot; history could repeat itself &quot; -- a reference_to the animosities that triggered World_War I . To his critics ' dismay , he did little else . Then he left . Four days later , the Yugoslav federation began to disintegrate . First Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence . Nine months later came the secession of Bosnia-Herzegovina , a move that triggered a dirty , stubborn war in the heart of the Balkans and gave the world a new synonym for barbarity : Bosnia . The messy confusion of the war itself -- a conflict that pits the country ' s majority Muslims and minority Croats against an ill-disciplined but brazen rogue army of Bosnian Serbs -- has been matched only by the equally messy attempts by the international community to end it . What went_wrong can be summed_up in just two words -- almost everything . How these efforts failed is not a tale of evil people and evil deeds but of bright , well-intentioned men and women , some of them overly idealistic , some of them arrogant , running_afoul of the hard realities at critical moments in a part of the world that does not forgive those who err . The price of their failure at these turning points has been high . In Bosnia itself , more_than 200 # 000 people have died and 10 times that number have been displaced . The war has scorned the world ' s mightiest military alliance , discredited the United Nations , frustrated the United States , complicated U.S. ties with Russia and strained its links with Europe , and ended the illusion among Europeans that they had somehow managed to progress beyond such brutality . It has also thrown America ' s leadership and that of its President into question . Before his inauguration , Bill_Clinton defined the war in Bosnia as a modern-day Holocaust , a moral challenge that the United States could not duck . &quot; The legitimacy of ' ethnic cleansing ' cannot stand , &quot; he declared , referring to the Bosnian Serbs ' systematic murder and expulsion of Bosnian Muslims from nearly three-quarters of the country . Nearly two years later , Clinton has spent more time on Bosnia than on any other foreign crisis but has painfully little to show for his efforts beyond a steady erosion of U.S. credibility . Today , after a dizzying series of policy zigzags , the President endorses a peace plan that would allow the Bosnian Serbs to keep most of their conquests , and he seems to be ready to give_in to other demands . &quot; It ' s a disaster , &quot; one Clinton adviser acknowledged . Another U.S. official added , &quot; We took a bad situation and arguably made_it worse. &quot; The President and his team were not alone . The late NATO Secretary_General Manfred Woerner , a German who in his youth bitterly accused his parents of doing too_little to oppose Nazi atrocities , took_on the challenge of bringing Western military might to bear in Bosnia as a personal mission . Dying of cancer , he twice left his hospital_bed earlier this year to chair crucial North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization meetings that delivered tough-sounding &quot; retreat-or-else &quot; ultimatums to Bosnian Serbs . His efforts delivered the alliance into the swamp of Bosnia ' s political contradictions . The Bosnian Serbs retreated only partially , and the &quot; or else &quot; never happened . Soon enough , the Bosnian Serbs , with help from the United Nations , were effectively ordering around an impotent NATO . &quot; He was convinced NATO could make the difference , &quot; said a colleague who knew Woerner well . &quot; In the end , he was bitterly disillusioned. &quot; He had reason to be . Even within the confines of the alliance headquarters here , it is hard to argue against the hard assessment made recently by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas : &quot; If you want a classic failure , this is a classic failure , where NATO has been tied_in knots -- they ' ve almost become irrelevant. &quot; Leading figures within the European Union who saw the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the resulting war in Bosnia as their first great military challenge of the post-Cold War era have worked tirelessly on diplomatic solutions , backed a U.N. peacekeeping force and then provided many of its troops . But Europe ' s diplomacy has run_into the sand , and the 24 # 000-strong U.N. force in Bosnia is a thinly veiled fiasco . Over the course of their deployment , the peacekeepers have been reduced to objects of scorn and pity who have become de_facto hostages of the Serbs . The 1 # 200 Bangladeshi U.N. peacekeepers meant to deter a blood bath as Bosnian Serb forces began pressing into the northwestern enclave of Bihac last month were deployed to the area with no heating , no winter clothing , insufficient fuel and food , and one weapon for every four soldiers . Last week , they suffered the ultimate indignity when their attempt to withdraw from Bihac was blocked -- by the Serbs . &quot; What is happening there is a disgrace for civilized Europe , &quot; German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said of the Bosnian war in_general . Even Moscow ' s attempts to nudge its Orthodox Christian Serb cousins ran_aground , as Russia ' s special emissary in Bosnia , Vitaly I . Churkin , found to his dismay earlier this year . Usually composed and cool , Churkin seemed visibly shaken in the spring after discovering that Bosnian Serb leaders had consistently lied to him on crucial details regarding their agreed pullback from the town of Gorazde . &quot; They are dealing with a great_power and not a banana republic , &quot; Churkin raged . &quot; One cannot play with Russia , and one cannot play with the world community. &quot; But the Bosnian Serbs did just that . They continue to do so . As international efforts to resolve the Bosnian conflict collapse into a series of accusations , recriminations and laments , one of the key factors keeping the U.N. force in the country at all is the complexity of getting them out . &quot; We ' re talking_about a major rescue operation with thousands of lightly armed troops maybe having to fight their way_out , &quot; said John Chipman , director of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies . &quot; The prospect of withdrawal is almost as chilling as the prospect of staying. &quot; While there is little argument that the disintegration of the Yugoslav federation and the resulting Bosnian war represent a major European crisis , it has been the relentless pictures and other accounts of the atrocities there that have kept the conflict a major public issue throughout the West . But while those accounts generate enormous moral pressure &quot; to do something &quot; to end the carnage , other , more powerful , factors have worked to preclude action that might be effective . In the end , three key factors neutralized the West : * Public_opinion . The schizophrenic nature of public_opinion has demanded action but at minimal cost . At no time during the war has public sympathy in America or in Western Europe been strong enough to support the view that Bosnia is a cause worth sacrificing its own sons and daughters for . The very nature of the conflict , a confusing affair with few ideological principles , no clearly defined &quot; good_guys &quot; and the absence of compelling strategic interests , undercut the position of those pressing to do more . In crucial discussions during the Clinton_Administration ' s first months , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher privately passed_around polls demonstrating the depth of public resistance to involvement in Bosnia , to discourage those counseling action . * Military advice . There has been a near-universal rejection of the option of armed intervention among military_leaders on both sides of the Atlantic . The idea of trying to separate and pacify three different but intertwined warring communities in forbidding , mountainous terrain far from any well-established bases was a recipe for disaster , the generals concluded . * Political caution . Clinton and other Western leaders concluded that , however compelling the suffering in Bosnia and however disturbing the challenge to human values there , sending troops in a final attempt to end the war was not worth the risks . &quot; Nobody had the stomach to put_in troops , so there was no sense in saying we were going_to fix the problem . All we could do was manage it and reduce the suffering , &quot; a Clinton adviser said . Facing these realities , many turned_to the United Nations as a convenient out . Since September , 1991 , the U.N. Security_Council has adopted more_than 100 resolutions and statements dealing with the crisis in the former Yugoslav federation , almost all focusing_on Bosnia . There is little doubt that most were passed in_order to quiet public_opinion rather than out of any realistic hope that they would change the situation on the ground in Bosnia . Jose Maria Mendiluce , the Basque who headed the U.N. relief program in Bosnia until about a year ago , once called the U.N. Bosnian mission an &quot; alibi. &quot; Governments could always point to the U.N. peacekeepers and humanitarian workers as proof they were doing something . But if the word peacekeeper is an unfortunate misnomer , the official name -- the U.N. Protection Force -- is equally misleading . Its job is not to protect civilians from murder , rape or other violence . In fact , it is not allowed to protect people -- as became dramatically clear on Jan . 8 , 1993 , when French peacekeepers stood_by and watched Serbian gunmen assassinate Bosnian Vice Premier Hakija Turajlic in the Bosnian capital , Sarajevo . Instead , the force ' s job is to escort humanitarian aid when and where the warring parties agree , patrol six U.N.-designated &quot; safe areas &quot; and monitor heavy-weapons exclusion zones around Sarajevo and Gorazde . Accepting these realities seemed to come more easily to Europeans than to Americans . Britain , France and Russia all had sympathies for the Serbs , who had fought with them in both world_wars . A strong moral streak in Clinton ' s foreign_policy also made_it far more difficult for America to reject the idea of punishing the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes and lifting the arms embargo that hampered the outgunned Bosnian government ' s ability to fight_back . These transatlantic differences bedeviled the search for peace . While Europe doggedly pressed for a negotiated settlement , even if it meant rewarding Serbian aggression , the new Administration came_to office troubled and deeply split on the idea . Clinton and some of his senior advisers , including Vice_President Al Gore and U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright , felt they had taken a moral position on &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; -- one that they did not want to abandon . After all , in the election campaign , Clinton had denounced then-President George_Bush for doing too_little in Bosnia and had called_for possible air strikes against the Serbs . But Christopher and then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin pressed_home the realities of public_opinion and the dead_end of the military option . According to Bosnian and U.S. officials , the divisions within the Administration ran so deep that in the spring of 1993 , when State_Department special envoy Reginald Bartholomew was urging Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to sign a peace plan giving considerable territory to the Bosnian Serbs , White_House aides were urging him to hold_out for better terms . These differences -- within the Administration and across the Atlantic -- proved disastrous in the search for peace . They sent conflicting signals at crucial moments . They gave the Bosnian government false hopes of a possible better deal and prepared the ground for damaging rifts between the Western allies that would extend deep into NATO and the United Nations . In January , 1993 , the European Community , as the EU then was known , threw its weight behind a plan drawn_up by former Secretary_of_State Cyrus R . Vance and Lord Owen , a former British foreign secretary , that proposed giving the Serbs 43 % of Bosnia . Vance and Owen had a strategy for winning acceptance of their plan : They would swiftly sign_up the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims and then generate enough international pressure to force the Bosnian Serbs to sign . The Bosnian Croats signed , but the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government hesitated . U.N. officials are sure the Bosnian Muslims balked because they expected the Clinton_Administration to denounce the plan and offer them something better . Certainly Clinton ' s election had boosted Bosnian government spirits . &quot; I have a little hope in the Clinton_Administration , &quot; Haris Silajdzic , then Bosnia ' s foreign_minister and now its prime_minister , said after the inauguration . &quot; He strikes me as a humanist , while the Europeans are hopeless. &quot; But Clinton ' s more cautious advisers , including Aspin and Christopher , were already warning him that his goals were going_to be difficult to achieve . In the end , the President listened to these advisers ; Bartholomew , his special emissary , persuaded the Muslims to sign . But three crucial months were lost . &quot; Those three months let the Serbs off_the_hook , &quot; said one official close to the talks . Some are convinced that Clinton ' s idealistic rhetoric and his initial refusal to back the Vance-Owen plan scuttled the last , best chance for a just settlement . To be sure , even with the Muslim delay , Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic nearly buckled under Western pressure . Bartholomew managed to persuade Russia for the first time to press the Bosnian Serbs ; sanctions against Serbia itself were tightened , and the threat of air strikes to enforce recently established U.N.-designated safe areas seemed real . Seeing no way_out , Karadzic signed the Vance-Owen plan . But sensing divisions and doubt within the West on its willingness to follow_through on its threats , the Bosnian Serb leader quickly subjected the accord to ratification by a self-styled Serbian parliament and the Bosnian Serb electorate , both of which rejected it . The Vance-Owen plan was dead . Western credibility would soon share a similar fate . The U.S.-led hard talk and threat of air_power against the Bosnian Serbs if they rejected Vance-Owen suddenly melted in the warmth of the war ' s second spring . Christopher , dispatched by Clinton to Europe to drum_up support for a U.S. plan to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian government and punish the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes , was universally snubbed . It was a humiliating rejection for the new President , who quickly changed_course . He joined with Russia , Spain , France and Britain to present a new peace plan , revised to the dominant rebel Serbs ' liking . That plan too would eventually be rejected . But the exposure of the West ' s divisions and the U.S. failure to gain European support for its tough stance against the Bosnian Serbs in the spring of 1993 proved to be a turning point . For Karadzic , the message was suddenly clear : The Western allies were unwilling to confront his undisciplined army militarily . They would not follow_through with other threats . The ability to sway the Bosnian Serbs had diminished sharply . The Clinton about-face also left the Bosnian government devastated . Instead of the President bending Europeans to his will , the opposite had occurred . &quot; He promised things and he promised in such a way that he had no excuse for not fulfilling those promises , &quot; Bosnian Vice_President Ejup Ganic noted bitterly in a June , 1993 , interview . &quot; It is American foreign_policy and the American ideal of democracy that is losing here. &quot; About this time , the United Nations turned_to NATO for help in protecting its peacekeepers from increasing Bosnian Serb attacks . The United Nations also wanted alliance help to protect the six U.N.-designated safe areas established as havens for Muslim refugees . Enthusiastically supported by the United States , NATO agreed . But at an important Aug . 9 , 1993 , meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels , those nations with peacekeepers on the ground -- led by Britain , France , Norway and Canada -- argued that any NATO attack must also be approved by the U.N. commander on the ground . That decision would turn the use of Western air_power into a tragicomic farce , chill ties between the United Nations and NATO and drive a wedge into alliance unity . &quot; It seemed logical at the time , &quot; said one of those present at the meeting . &quot; We all thought we were_on the same side. &quot; They weren ' t . Inside and outside NATO , the United States again found itself at_odds with its European allies . The U.S. desire to punish Bosnian Serb violations was countered by European concern that NATO air strikes could lead to reprisals against peacekeepers on the ground . The obvious soon became clear : The United Nations and NATO had conflicting agendas . The immediate concern of U.N. commanders and senior civilian officials was not punishing aggression but keeping the peacekeepers safe . When NATO last February wanted to strike at Bosnian Serb artillery pieces still inside a weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo after an alliance ultimatum to remove them expired , the U.N. commander in Bosnia , British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , refused , declaring the Serbs &quot; in effective compliance. &quot; Karadzic again understood that the world ' s mightiest air_force posed little threat to his forces . In the months since , NATO requests for air strikes have frequently been denied . When the United Nations has agreed , its conditions have made the job of alliance pilots difficult and dangerous . One final transatlantic clash occurred within the alliance on Thanksgiving_Day , when France vetoed a U.S. plan for greater use of NATO air_power . The intensity of that confrontation left diplomats so shaken that they agreed to back_away from the issue . Now , NATO ' s primary task is no longer pressing for air strikes against Bosnian Serbs but planning how to rescue the United Nations ' peacekeepers from a country they never saw at_peace . As NATO ' s drama with the United Nations played_out , the major_powers launched one final diplomatic initiative . The so-called Contact Group -- made_up of Russia , Britain , Germany , France and the United States -- presented the warring parties with a map that , this time , gave the Bosnian Serbs 49 % of Bosnia-Herzegovina . They attached a July 20 deadline for acceptance , again threatening dire consequences unless all signed . The Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats , who had since reconciled , reluctantly said yes . The Bosnian Serbs , as expected , said no . Increasingly confident and having taken 70 % of Bosnian territory , they had little reason to do otherwise . Earlier this month , the five Contact Group foreign_ministers met again in Brussels amid reports they were ready to sweeten the settlement for the Bosnian Serbs , even allowing them to annex their territory to Serbia . Instead , the five could agree only to press the Bosnian Serbs to accept the existing plan . &quot; We don ' t see any other road to take , &quot; Christopher said at a late-night news_conference . Five of the world ' s most powerful nations had run_out of ideas . The Clinton_Administration had also apparently come full circle . From Clinton ' s initial soaring statements , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry now drew a more modest assessment of U.S. involvement in the crisis , saying the Administration had defended the nation ' s interests . &quot; Our national interests are to stop the spread of war and to limit the violence , &quot; he said .
