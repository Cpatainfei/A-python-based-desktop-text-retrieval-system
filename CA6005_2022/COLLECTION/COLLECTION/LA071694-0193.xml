   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : COUNTYWIDE ; RED_CROSS WORRIED OVER BLOOD SHORTAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Red_Cross officials are urging healthy people to donate blood to offset an unusually early summer blood shortage . The nationwide shortage is especially worrisome in Southern California because blood has to be imported here from throughout the country during normal times . Unless donors step_forward , the blood supply may fall below emergency levels , forcing patients to delay elective surgeries , said spokeswoman Judy Iannaccone . Normally , blood shortages are rare before Labor_Day . This year blood supplies have been chronically low in part because severe weather in the midwest and eastern portions of the country during the winter hampered blood collection efforts , she said . Furthermore , about half of the people who schedule appointments to donate blood fail to show_up . If all_the people who scheduled appointments followed_through , the crisis would be over , she said . Potential donors should call ( 800 ) 974-2113 to make an appointment . JON NALICK</TEXT>
