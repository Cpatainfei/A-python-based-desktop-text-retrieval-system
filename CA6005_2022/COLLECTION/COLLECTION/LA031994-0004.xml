   <HEADLINE> SUPERFUND WELL CLEANUP DRAINS MONEY , CONFIDENCE ; POLLUTION : SAN GABRIEL VALLEY BUSINESSES FACE A HUGE BILL . SLOW PROGRESS RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT FEDERAL PROGRAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It has been 15 years since the first evidence of chemical contamination showed_up in a San Gabriel Valley water well . It has been 10 years since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated the valley ' s huge aquifer a national Superfund site . Since then , one quarter of the valley ' s public water wells have been shut_down and at least $ 50 million has been spent investigating the problem . Hundreds of private firms have been tapped by the EPA to cleanse the aquifer , which supplies drinking_water to more_than 1 million people . But except for a treatment plant providing water for a_few hundred people , the cleanup effort has yet to begin . After a decade of federal intervention , the aquifer remains one of the most heavily contaminated potable ground_water basins in the nation . Now , the EPA is talking_about a final cleanup bill between $ 200 million and $ 800 million that will be handed directly to local businesses . The potential impact on the valley ' s economy , along with nagging doubts about the effectiveness of the proposed cleanup technology , is sapping what ' s left of public confidence in the EPA and the Superfund program . &quot; After 10 years of confusion , power struggles and bureaucratic inaction , the community in the San Gabriel Valley is no longer convinced that Superfund , under the direction of the EPA , is going_to solve their problem , &quot; Rep . Esteban Torres ( D-La Puente ) , wrote in a recent analysis . In some ways , the San Gabriel Valley quagmire epitomizes the entire Superfund program . Nationwide , it has consumed $ 30 billion since its inception in 1980 while managing to clean_up fewer than 10 % of the country ' s 2 # 000 toxic_waste_sites . The mounting frustration of business and environmental groups has sparked demands for overhauling the Superfund law and led to a recent set of restructuring proposals by the White_House . But in many ways , the San Gabriel Valley situation is in a class by itself . Although the Superfund law is designed to make polluters foot the bill for the nation ' s most lethal accumulations of waste , it is not easy to say who created the toxic soup under the San Gabriel Valley . The ingredients have been percolating for nearly half a century , fed by fertilizer when the valley was a farming community , by household septic_tanks and by chemical waste from many of the 48 # 000 firms that set_up shop after World_War_II . A variety of chemicals have turned_up in the water ; the most potent are volatile organic_compounds , or VOCs , which can break_down into human carcinogens . The task of identifying the polluters is further complicated by the nature of the pollution , which is hidden from view and moving_around beneath the 170-square-mile valley . Contaminated water under a piece of property may have come from that site or may have drifted &quot; downstream &quot; from some_other source . Superfund critics argue that society caused the contamination and ought to pay_for eliminating it through taxes or an increase in water rates . Under the law , however , the EPA must try to track the contamination back to its above-ground sources and bill the property_owners . So far , the EPA has compiled a list of about 400 businesses that may be asked to pay the final cleanup bill . Targeted_companies could be looking_at costs ranging from a_few hundred_thousand dollars to more_than a_million . That does not include the $ 135 million that officials estimate must be spent to detect and remove chemical contaminants from the soil above the water_table . The EPA ' s dealings with local firms have been widely assailed . &quot; It may be futile , excessively expensive and unfair &quot; to try to tie the contamination to specific businesses , Torres wrote in his report on the issue last year . &quot; There ' s been a tendency to see the businesses as criminals , &quot; said Jim Goodrich , the director of the San Gabriel Valley Water Quality Authority , a public agency created four years ago to look_for new solutions . &quot; Some of the regulators seemed to forget that for a very long_time there were no regulations on how to dispose_of this stuff . It wasn ' t all that long ago you could buy one of the most notorious solvents around to clean your carburetor , and if you happened to spill some of it on the ground , you weren ' t breaking any laws. &quot; Defending the government ' s work , Wayne Praskins , the EPA ' s project manager for the San Gabriel Valley Superfund , argues that the agency is doing a good job of pinpointing responsible companies , although he concedes that not all_of them will be found . Praskins said the EPA is_on the verge of releasing its first detailed ground_water treatment plan . It will focus , he said , on two_dozen to three dozen firms in the Baldwin Park area , which will be asked to pay as much as $ 90 million in cleanup costs . &quot; We feel reasonably confident we have singled_out the significant sources of contamination , &quot; he said . Admitting that the project has been a long , often exasperating experience , Praskins said , &quot; In hindsight , you probably could identify ways we could have done things faster , &quot; but he also blamed the delays on the recalcitrance of some businesses . He is not alone in that opinion . &quot; The immediate reaction of businessmen was to say , ' To hell with ' em ' , sue ' em , ' &quot; said Richard Nichols , executive_director of the Baldwin Hills Chamber_of_Commerce . &quot; That didn ' t work . The EPA isn ' t fearful of that kind of thing , but it took a while for that realization to sink in. &quot; The EPA ' s list of 400 companies represents only about 20 % of all those scrutinized by government inspectors . But if the past is any guide , the Superfund ' s economic impact is likely to extend well beyond the 400 , because any one of them can attempt to recover costs by implicating others . As more people are dragged into the Superfund morass and as more lawyers and consultants are hired , costs will go_up and the cleanup will take longer . Many of the businesses targeted by the EPA are large corporations , such_as Aerojet General , a world leader in rocket propulsion_systems . It was in an Aerojet well in Azusa where the first ground_water contamination was detected 15 years ago . And it is in that neighborhood where wells continue to yield some of the highest levels of contamination . But the EPA list also includes small enterprises struggling to survive the recession , according to the San Gabriel Valley Economic Council . One government survey recently found that 142 firms have already paid a total of $ 15 million to conduct soil tests or install monitoring wells required by the EPA or its local affiliate , the California Regional Water Quality Board . Many of these firms worry that their initial investment is just the beginning of a never-ending process of compliance . They fear that the specter of liability will hang over their property indefinitely once they have been put_on the EPA ' s list of potentially responsible parties . Those fears are not entirely groundless . In 1988 , Leon Wilton , the owner of a small machine_shop in South El Monte , was visited by a state water quality inspector looking_for sources of contamination . The visit , on the EPA ' s behalf , marked the beginning of a costly , six-year compliance process that has yet to end . Wilton , a high_school dropout from Indiana , landed in Los Angeles in the mid-1950s after a tour_of_duty with the U.S. Army in Korea . After a dozen years on aerospace assembly_lines , Wilton bought a dozen used machine drills and went_into business for himself in 1970 . In 1987 , he filled_out a routine questionnaire indicating that he stored certain chemicals on his property used to lubricate his machines . The questionnaire triggered the inspection . The inspector , noting oily stains on Wilton ' s concrete loading_area , recommended soil tests to determine if leaks contributed to contamination of the aquifer . The tests detected chemical residue , but well below the levels at which soil cleanup is required by state and county laws . The tests revealed 0.02 parts per billion of tetrachloroethane , a minuscule amount of one of the volatile organic_compounds contaminating the aquifer . Elsewhere in the valley ' s soil , the same contaminants have exceeded 1 # 000 p.p.b. The safe level for drinking_water in California is 5 p.p.b. The tests on Wilton ' s property also detected 193 p.p.b. of toluene , a petroleum derivative that also has turned_up in the aquifer . Under Los Angeles County regulations , Wilton does not have to clean_up the toluene in the ground unless it reaches 300 p.p.b. Toluene has been found in other parts of the valley at levels of 20 # 000 p.p.b. Nevertheless , Wilton was asked to perform another round of soil analyses in 1992 . Those tests showed no increase in contaminant levels . By then , Wilton ' s business , which depends heavily on aerospace customers , was caught in the industry ' s downward spiral . He said he had to cut his work_force in half and cash_in an insurance_policy to make ends meet . His lawyer told the EPA he was_on the verge of bankruptcy . Saying that the government ' s demands had already cost him $ 70 # 000 , Wilton asked the agency to release him from any further Superfund responsibility . Wilton , who is in his 60s , says he wants to sell his business or borrow against it to pay his debts . But he shares the fears of other businessmen in the valley that the threat of Superfund liability will turn_away prospective buyers or lenders . The EPA , however , refused to take Wilton off its list of potentially liable firms . Instead , the agency asked him to perform yet another soil analysis . Officials said Wilton had not proved that the contamination showing_up in nearby wells did not come from his property . &quot; The problem , &quot; said Wilton ' s lawyer , Melissa McKeith , &quot; is there is no point at which the EPA is required to say , ' OK , your property is clean , you don ' t have to do any more work. ' There are no standards . Nothing to shoot_for . It ' s totally discretionary . You ' re clean when some EPA official says your clean. &quot; Torres has also criticized the EPA for its unwillingness to go easy on minor players such_as Wilton . &quot; The EPA has the authority to take the small guys out of the deal and protect them from future liability , &quot; said Fran McPoland , Torres ' staff expert on the San Gabriel Valley Superfund . &quot; I ' ve been working_on this issue for six years , and EPA keeps saying they are just a_few steps away from making what we refer to as de minimus settlements with these companies . But the fact is they haven ' t done it. &quot; Praskins said the EPA has yet to set its own &quot; clean site &quot; criteria , but added that the agency is &quot; evaluating whether we can come_up with numbers that people can use &quot; to gauge how much cleanup work they need to do . As for Wilton ' s situation , Praskins acknowledged that test results from his property &quot; did not indicate a problem. &quot; Asked why the agency refused to grant Wilton the sort of liability waiver he could take_to the bank , EPA lawyer Mark Klaiman said it was because Wilton ' s request for indemnity was part of a collective appeal by a group of South El Monte businesses . Some of the others , Klaiman said , had significant amounts of contamination on their property . Records of the regional board indicate , however , that Wilton was pursuing indemnity on_his_own behalf . Wilton ' s experience underscores the uncertainty continuing to plague the San Gabriel Valley Superfund program . &quot; The EPA hasn ' t been able to tell business how much work it will take and how much it will cost because they don ' t know . No one really knows , &quot; said one public official close to the project who asked not to be identified . Even now , with the EPA on the verge of releasing its first comprehensive plan for treating the aquifer , agency officials concede that the process will not get all_of the contaminants out of the ground_water . Known as pump and treat , the process draws water from the ground , aerates the pollutants and recycles the purified water_back to the aquifer . But some of the contaminants tend to get left in the ground . &quot; It can be hard to get_out the last part of the contamination . Getting_down to 5 p.p.b. can be difficult , &quot; Praskins said , referring to the state ' s safe drinking_water limit for the volatile organic_compounds . It ' s not as if the drinking_water can ' t be made safe . Dozens of San Gabriel Valley water_companies have been doing_it successfully for years , cleaning the water as it flows through the wellhead and passing_on the costs to consumers . But that process does not attack the problem at its source -- in the aquifer . And as long as the contaminants are down there , they can spread and mutate , ultimately threatening neighboring aquifers , EPA officials say . As the EPA moves toward the first of seven planned cleanup phases_in the San Gabriel Valley , officials elsewhere are scrambling to come_up with a way of easing the cost burden on local firms . Torres has proposed legislation to require the federal_government to pick_up 20 % of the cleanup costs . But his bill has not gained much momentum in Congress and business representatives maintain that their costs could still be astronomical . Another approach , this one more appealing_to businesses , would allow companies to recapture a significant portion of their costs through credits received from the sale of treated water . The complex arrangement would involve the cooperation of the numerous companies and agencies that market water in the San Gabriel Valley . Although businesses are making the biggest push for reform , they have gained allies as the recession has cut deeper into the local economy , Six years ago , the East Valley Organization , a federation of neighborhood groups with a populist edge , put the aquifer cleanup at the top of its agenda . The group even offered rewards to people who turned_in polluters . Today , East Valley Organization officials say they are equally concerned about the state of the economy . &quot; The EPA can come_in and say to a small business , ' We think you might be responsible . Drill here . Drill over there , at your expense , ' &quot; said organization representative John Korey . &quot; A lot of our folks work for those businesses . A lot of those businesses are being driven batty . Some have moved_out . &quot; We don ' t want to lose any more of them. &quot; The Poison Below In the San Gabriel Valley , fertilizer from old farms , chemicals used to unclog septic_tanks and industrial solvents from many of the 48 # 000 firms that moved_in after World_War_II are the for decades . VOC Ranges Volatile organic_compounds , or VOC ' s are a common byproduct of industry that can break ingredients of a toxic broth that has been contaminating the underground drinking_water supply down into human carcinogens . Here is a look_at the concentration of VOCs under surrounding areas . Detectable level to the maximum contamination level ( MCL ) allowed by the state MCL to 10 times MCL 10 to 100 times MCL 100 to 1 # 000 times MCL Exceeding 1 # 000 times MCL Sources of Contamination Fertilizer : Left_over from when the San Gabriel Valley was a farming community , nitrates from fertilizer have leached into the ground_water . Industry : Chemical products used by an array of firms have shown_up in high concentrations throughout most of the valley ' s aquifer . Septic tanks : Toxic chemicals commonly used to open clogged septic_tanks before the valley had a sewer_system are found in the ground_water . Extraction well : More_than 1 million people rely_on the highly polluted San Gabriel aquifer for drinking_water . Superfund legislation : The Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 set_up a revolving_fund to clean_up several hundred of the worst abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites . Some sites have been treated , but implementation by the EPA has been criticized and available funds are not sufficient .
