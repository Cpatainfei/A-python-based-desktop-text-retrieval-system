   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVES ON PROPOSITION 187 ; TEACHERS AS INS COPS : AN UGLY LIE ; CHILDREN INELIGIBLE FOR PUBLIC_SCHOOL WON ' T BE ' THROWN INTO THE STREETS. ' AND WE ALREADY HAVE ENROLLMENT CHECKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I taught in the Los Angeles school district for seven years , and I want voters to know that the image of children being thrown_out onto the streets under Proposition 187 is one of the uglier scare tactics being promulgated by opponents of the initiative . It is a lie to say that the measure will make teachers &quot; cops &quot; or informants or agents of the INS . Teachers nurture and instruct all children assigned to them , without reservation ; Proposition 187 doesn ' t change this in any way . Teachers do not determine eligibility for enrollment , so they would not be expected or required to identify children who are ineligible because they are in this country illegally . The admissions office of each school handles enrollment decisions . Children brought_to the wrong school have routinely been refused admission and unceremoniously redirected elsewhere for years . Did anyone not know this ? Parents already have to prove that their children have the right to attend a given school by showing that they reside within certain geographical boundaries . What would be new under Proposition 187 is also having to show that they have the legal_right to be in the country in_order to enjoy &quot; free &quot; schooling ( paid by the beleaguered taxpayer ) . Since 187 applies only to publicly supported schools , children who are ineligible could enroll in private or parochial_schools . What about ineligible children already enrolled ? The measure would not take_effect until January , and schools would have until the following January to complete the eligibility verification of students already enrolled . Additionally , parents would have 90 days after notification to arrange transfer to a school in their country_of_origin ; the children would remain in school during this time . that ' s hardly &quot; throwing children into the street. &quot; That children would suddenly become homeless under this law is the vilest innuendo from opponents of Proposition 187 . If children had a home before Proposition 187 and enjoyed parental control , they still would afterward . As to the &quot; police-state mentality &quot; slogan , only someone who is trying to apply for certain public benefits or who has been arrested for probable_cause on a non-immigration offense can &quot; come under suspicion , &quot; and only if that person is not_able to produce the necessary documents or presents fraudulent documents . Analogously , anyone trying to shop in a membership retail_store or enter an HMO hospital is asked to show the appropriate membership_card . In the case of the hospital , of course , people seeking treatment for an emergency will be seen even if they are not normally eligible ; the same would be true for illegal aliens under Proposition 187 . Voters should note that opponents of 187 always cite the value of immigrants without noting the difference between legal and illegal immigration . The strength of this country derives from legal immigrants who came and still come expecting to respect a common body of law and to avoid being a burden on their adopted society . I find naturalized citizens and other legal immigrants far more indignant than natural citizens when they see illegal aliens profiting from breaking the very laws they themselves had honorably obeyed . The massive onslaught on public_services and taking of entry-level jobs has hurt our legal immigrants , minority citizens and our young people the most . It is a strange sort of compassion , indeed , that chooses to shower largess on lawbreakers at the very expense of the perpetrators ' victims . The natural result is not gratitude , but contempt toward this country and its people and institutions . Since behavior rewarded is behavior encouraged , all benefits to illegal entrants must come_to an end , and soon . If you think a reinforced Border_Patrol is all we need , I must remind you that under NAFTA , trucks now can roll_over our borders uninspected , unopened and with no change in driver . Guess what is the most profitable cargo with the least criminal penalty for breaking applicable laws ? It ' s foreign nationals entering the United States illegally . Without some provision like Proposition 187 , what defense do we have that is any more humane ? Finally , critics seem to forget that people tend to respond to changing conditions . In the early 1950s , when the government announced a program to send_back to the country_of_origin all foreign nationals who were here illegally , about one-quarter of a_million people left the United States voluntarily , simply in anticipation of being caught . A similar result can be expected with passage of this initiative , much to the consternation of those who wish to derive political and economic power from a massive alien presence here . All things considered , Proposition 187 is about as humane a remedy to an intolerable situation as a bankrupt state can manage . The betrayal of the citizens by their elected officials at every level has left us no other peaceful choice .</TEXT>
