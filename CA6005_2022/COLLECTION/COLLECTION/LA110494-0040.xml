   <HEADLINE> ON THE ISSUE : INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY ' S TOPICS ; PROP . 187 ' S IMPACT UPON RACE RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The fervor surrounding the Tuesday ' s election has stirred_up a wide range of emotions on both sides of the more closely contested races this year . In particular , the arguments for Proposition 187 , which would deny many public benefits to illegal immigrants , have engendered a degree of resentment that has been regarded by some as racially motivated . Those opposed to the measure have charged proponents with using illegal immigrants as scapegoats for larger economic problems . Opponents also point to the potential that people_of_color could be unduly discriminated against . Meanwhile , some Proposition 187 supporters claim that American values are being overrun by an uncontrolled influx of Third_World citizens , while others insist that frustrations over an overloaded economic and social_system are the true meat of their cause . How has Proposition 187 affected race relations in California ? Guy Weddington McCreary , member of The Voice of Citizens Together , an immigration-reform group headquartered in Sherman Oaks : &quot; People are using the stigma of racism to destroy the opposition . What we see here is that if you tell a lie big and long enough , people will believe it . If there is racial tension , it ' s being caused by those who are here illegally at the expense of the tax-paying citizen . It ' s not a racial issue ; it ' s an economic issue and an enforcement of our laws . It will control illegal immigration . Our society has to face this problem. &quot; Juana Mora , chairman of the Chicano Studies Department , Cal State Northridge : &quot; The most dangerous and racist implications of Proposition 187 are that all Latinos will be targets and considered suspects just because of how they look . It doesn ' t outline carefully how a person will be identified . Many of us , even if we have lived_in this country for years , will be targeted by the school_system or the community . The initiative is supposed to reduce illegal immigration . But the racism underlying the measure targets Latinos. &quot; Leticia Quezada , member , Los Angeles Board_of_Education : &quot; The proposition states that those ' suspected ' of not being legally documented will be questioned . That means anyone who looks foreign , speaks with an accent or doesn ' t fit into the stereotype of a blond , blue-eyed , red-blooded American . This would create conflict , paranoia and controversy in a city still trying to recuperate from the 1992 riots . If this measure passes , the aftermath will be horrendous . We are already racially divided . It ' s our responsibility to come_together and help our young people deal with that fear and anxiety. &quot; Kian Kwan , professor of sociology , Cal State Northridge : ' It ' s a much larger issue than just a proposition . What ' s happening here is a form of displaced aggression . In the last five to 10 years , people have not been doing_well . Many are experiencing a loss in income , while others are experiencing a social and moral crisis . This includes the breaking_up of the family structure and , because we live_in a pluralistic society , the lack of sharing values and mores with others . These developments breed a great_deal of distress and frustration , which leads to a kind of mass discontent . With that , resentment and anger build_up and you see such things as scapegoating and hate crimes come_to surface . The resentment displayed by people discussing the proposition has , thus far , been mostly artful and not so overt. &quot;</TEXT>
