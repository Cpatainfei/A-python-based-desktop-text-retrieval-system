   <HEADLINE> SHUTTLE ATLANTIS CREW RETRIEVES SATELLITE MEASURING OZONE_LAYER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Racing high over the South_Seas , the space shuttle Atlantis ' astronauts on Saturday captured a German satellite carrying vital measurements of Earth ' s shrinking ozone_layer . Appropriately , the satellite was retrieved just north of Antarctica and its infamous ozone_hole , south of New Zealand . &quot; Super ! Super ! &quot; German scientists shouted in the satellite-control room at Kennedy Space Center as astronaut Ellen Ochoa grabbed the spacecraft with Atlantis ' robot arm . They celebrated with coffee and gummy bears . &quot; It ' s not what you usually do when something important happens . You usually have a glass of champagne . We will do this on Monday , &quot; when Atlantis returns to Earth with the satellite , German physicist Klaus Grossmann said . The astronauts had released the $ 35-million satellite eight days earlier so it could observe ozone and other atmospheric gases without interference from Atlantis . Shuttle commander Donald McMonagle flew over and around the 7 # 500-pound , triangular satellite , then hovered directly below at an altitude of 186 miles . &quot; It looks_like a diamond in the sky , &quot; he said . McMonagle closed_in on the satellite from below , testing a new approach to be used during Atlantis ' next flight -- the first of seven to 10 dockings with Russia ' s Mir space_station . Shuttles typically approach orbiting spacecraft from the front . By approaching from below , McMonagle used Earth ' s gravity as a natural brake and thereby minimized the need for jet firings . NASA wants to avoid jet firings when Atlantis links with Mir in June to protect the station ' s delicate solar_panels from exhaust . &quot; That was a superb rendezvous , &quot; Mission Control told the crew . &quot; You ' ve given us some important data and a lot of confidence . Well done. &quot; It was the high point for the six astronauts . They kept a rather low profile last week , watching_over atmospheric monitors flying_on the shuttle , testing experimental heat pipes and checking on 10 pregnant rats . &quot; It was very exciting , especially the view of the satellite , &quot; Ochoa said before anchoring the satellite in the cargo bay . Grossmann and other scientists are eager to get the satellite back . Hardly any measurements were beamed to the ground ; virtually everything was stored on tapes on board . Infrared telescopes on the satellite collected 15 million images of the atmosphere , measuring_up to 14 atmospheric gases per second . Researchers want to know how these gases interact . The thin , invisible layer of ozone in the stratosphere protects humans , animals and plants from dangerous ultraviolet_radiation . It ' s especially thin over the Antarctic , where a hole the size of North_America forms every September because of man-made chemicals . An ultraviolet instrument on the satellite measured gases responsible_for ozone destruction . Six instruments aboard Atlantis also surveyed the ozone_layer as well as solar_energy ; the seventh broke early in the 11-day mission .</TEXT>
