   <HEADLINE> THE SECOND TIME AROUND ; IN 1988 , BRIAN BOITANO WON OLYMPIC GOLD . IN JANUARY , HE WON THE CHANCE TO TRY AGAIN . NOW , HIS HAIR RECEDING AND HIS FRONTRUNNER STATUS A MEMORY , THE BEST ATHLETE IN A GENERATION OF SKATERS JUMPS BACK INTO THE OLYMPIC SPOTLIGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There is an old Hollywood adage , which may or may_not be true , that says an actress is more_than just a woman ; an actor is less than just a man . A similar adage may or may_not be true of figure skaters : a female figure skater is more_than just an athlete ; a male figure skater is less than just an athlete . Male figure skaters tend to have more in common with Fred Astaire than Carl Lewis . They don ' t look_like athletes . They are willowy and thin , like Astaire , or compact and slight , like Joel Grey . They flit around the ice like sprites , spinning and leaping with grace , lightness and , especially , style , which is more important than athletic strength . In fact , figure_skating may be the only sport where a competitor ' s &quot; technical merit &quot; -- the ability to skate fast , say , or leap high -- counts less with judges than &quot; artistic impression. &quot; Officially , both standards are scored and carry equal weight , but it is not uncommon for judges , who are subjective , like dance critics , rather than objective , like a track-meet stopwatch , to subtract points from a competitor ' s score because they don ' t like his hairstyle , or the music he ' s skating to , or maybe even the spangled costume he ' s wearing . And male figure skaters don ' t have a typical athlete ' s attitude toward their sport . Most athletes train to win for years . Figure skaters train for years to win once . All of their training , and all_of their competitions , are essentially one long warm-up for a single contest : the Olympic Games . The prize is so important that U.S. women ' s front-runner Nancy Kerrigan was brutally mugged to enhance her rival ' s chances ( see sidebar ) . The pressure is so unbearable that it has been said no figure skater ever won a gold medal with his or her best performance . Instead , the gold goes_to whoever succumbs to pressure the least and skates less badly than the rest . After a figure skater wins a gold medal , he becomes rich and famous and is expected never to compete seriously again . After all , he can hardly surpass his gold medal . At best , he can only duplicate it . And if he doesn ' t , if he loses his next Olympic competition , his gold medal will be devalued . Figure skaters may be the only athletes who are so terrified of loss ( which propels most athletes to their next competition ) that they stop seriously competing after their biggest victory . But they can ' t actually retire at , say , 24 ; they still have to skate ; they just don ' t have to compete . So they become , instead , skating performers , entertainers , in one of those circus-like ice_shows that feature Olympic champions alongside Snoopy and Mickey_Mouse . They have only to glide onto the ice , perform a_few of their famous moves and then exit to applause and adulation . It is expected of gold medalists that they will trade on their Olympic fame for wealth . It is expected that they will become self-parodies , that their talent will rust from disuse until , finally , they have to be replaced , at 30 , say , by a newer , younger gold medalist . Brian Boitano might have been such a skater . He won a gold medal at the Olympic Games in Calgary in 1988 , at the age of 24 , with a performance so good it may have defied the conventional wisdom . &quot; I had heard that everyone had won the Olympic gold and not skated their best , &quot; he said then . &quot; I did_it . that ' s my best. &quot; He has been called the preeminent male figure skater of his generation , maybe of all time . And he has been described , again and again , with words usually reserved for athletes : &quot; powerful , &quot; &quot; strong , &quot; &quot; ultimate competitor. &quot; Which may be why , after his Olympic medal , he refused to do the expected . He retired from amateur competition and became a pro ( in endorsements , touring fees and pro prize_money , he began taking_in more_than $ 1 million a year ) . But he refused to join an ice_show . &quot; Hey , &quot; Boitano has said , &quot; you might be Huckleberry Hound . I know some guys who were champions , and they were in these , like , loincloths . Can you imagine coming_out in a loincloth every night ? I ' d be out_of_place . There ' d be fluff ahead and fluff behind. &quot; So , instead , Boitano created his own ice_shows , some with female counterpart Katarina Witt ( who had defied custom and returned for a risky shot at a second gold medal -- and won ) . At the time , Witt was appearing in a show called &quot; Holiday on Ice. &quot; It required that she float above the rink in a hot-air_balloon . &quot; Please , &quot; she cried to Boitano on the phone . &quot; Get me out of this ! &quot; Together , they created performances that Boitano considered &quot; athletic entertainment. &quot; Time magazine deemed one of them , &quot; Skating II , &quot; &quot; an ice_show for thinking adults. &quot; Another , &quot; Carmen &quot; on ice , won them both Emmys . Still , that wasn ' t enough for Boitano . &quot; He had a hard_time leaving the world of competition , &quot; says his coach , Linda Leaver . So Boitano continued to compete in professional figure-skating events . He won 10 professional championships after his Olympic gold medal . In lots of sports , that would be considered a heightened achievement compared to his amateur Olympic victory . Professional competitions in other sports ( the Super Bowl , the World_Series ) are deemed vastly superior to their amateur counterparts ( the Rose Bowl , the College World_Series ) . Professional figure-skating competitions , however , are often a mix of true athleticism and the kind of kitschy , crowd-pleasing antics professionals pick_up , like ticks , from their ice-show experiences . His &quot; retirement &quot; frustrated Boitano almost from the moment it began . He knew that he was skating better than ever . &quot; His jumps were higher ; he was skating faster ; there was nothing in his skating that wasn ' t better , &quot; says Leaver . To prove it to the world , and himself , Boitano petitioned the International Skating Union in 1990 to open the sport to professionals and amateurs alike . When eligibility was relaxed for the 1992 Games -- but not enough to include Boitano -- he kept pushing , hoping for another chance . &quot; If you ' re a real skater , you ' ll always wonder if you still have it , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' d like to be known for skating when I die , and I can ' t unless I put it on the line. &quot; Boitano , it seemed , didn ' t fear losing , nor did he fear that his gold medal would be tarnished if he proved unsuccessful in future Olympic Games . &quot; I may have the worst night of my life , &quot; he said , &quot; but even if I were to lose , I think there ' s a message ( in ) that . . . about wanting to do what you want to do and not being scared of the consequences. &quot; Such bravado had already meant six years outside amateur competition and a public tussle with the skating hierarchy . It would also mean 18 months of grueling training and , finally , an ego-bruising fight for a spot on the 1994 U.S Olympic Team . But in the end , he did what he wanted to do . Four days from now , Boitano , 30 years old , injury prone and competing against the best_men ' s field in recent memory , will once again &quot; put it on the line &quot; at the Olympic Games . BOITANO HAS WHITE SKIN STRETCHED tightly over a prominent forehead and an angular , bony face . He looks_like an ascetic , a 13th-Century monk out of &quot; The Name of the Rose. &quot; His black hair is receding , which is why he now cuts it short . Judges and skaters , who remember his long , fluffy ' do from ' 88 , are quick to comment on it -- &quot; Brian , what happened to your hair ! &quot; -- as if his hair , like Samson ' s , would somehow affect his skating . He has also gained weight , which is why some judges have told him he looks fat . He is big , for a figure skater : 5-11 , 165 pounds . He has the flaring , muscular thighs of a sprinter or a split_end in football . At competitions , when the skaters practice in groups together on the ice , he looks_like a big , predatory bird surrounded by hummingbirds . Their skates seem barely to touch the ice , but Boitano plows forward , digging in his skates as he makes huge figure eights the length of the rink . He moves with his head down , shoulders slightly hunched . The other skaters stay stiffly upright , their eyes looking_up toward the top row of seats , like actors playing to the back of the house . As Boitano builds_up more and more speed in his figure_eights , he begins to smile , luxuriating in the sheer physicality of skating fast . Each of the skaters gets his own practice time on center ice , while the competition works_out around him . One at a time , they run_through their routines , beginning to end . When they miss a jump , hands touching the ice for balance , they glance into the stands , seeking_out trainers , parents and agents : the entourage . Then they glide toward their coaches , seated at a long table with other coaches , close to the ice , for long words_of_advice and encouragement : &quot; Excellent ! Excellent ! &quot; says a coach , handing_over an Evian and a Kleenex . &quot; Just remember to keep your body straight. &quot; But even when center ice is his , Boitano only skates small parts of his routine , 30 seconds here , 20 seconds there , one leap , and then he circles slowly around the rink , his head always down , contemplating what he has just done . There is no entourage , and on those rare occasions when he stops by his coach , they barely speak . Maybe a word or a nod , and Boitano is off again , skating in his own private world . For years , Boitano was considered &quot; the most powerful and technically exact &quot; skater of his generation , according to choreographer Sandra Bezic , who helped create Boitano ' s winning routines in 1988 . He was a perfectionist when it came_to technique -- tight spins , deep edges , straight body -- and the best jumper of all time . Sports Illustrated claimed he spent &quot; more time in the air than on the ice. &quot; Leaver says that sometimes he ' d lose points with judges because &quot; he jumps so easily. &quot; At the World Championships in ' 83 , Boitano became the first male figure skater ever to successfully complete six different triple jumps in competition . He finished seventh . The problem was , Boitano skated like a robot . Which means that , however graceful his deep edges , he wasn ' t an artist . He was &quot; stiff , &quot; says Bezic . &quot; He didn ' t give his heart. &quot; Instead , Boitano preferred to win on purely athletic grounds . And he did win . He was four-time U.S. champion and defending gold medalist going_into the World Championships in 1987 , the prelude to the ' 88 Olympics , when he lost in a crushingly close battle with Canadian champ Brian Orser . &quot; The judges want what they want , &quot; Boitano said then . &quot; I want what I can give. &quot; For 1988 , Boitano hired Bezic , who designed a routine for him that , according to her , allowed him to &quot; hide behind a character &quot; as a town bully and a Napoleonic soldier . ( &quot; Sandra had a hard_time making me arrogant , &quot; he says. ) For the first time in his career , the skating world was talking_about Boitano ' s powers of interpretation , his emotion . In Calgary , against Orser , the Napoleonic soldier struck gold . After his Olympic victory , Boitano was more resigned to making his peace with the judges . &quot; I learned to ask their opinion , &quot; he says . &quot; that ' s the way life works. &quot; But Brian was not so acquiescent when it came_to the skating establishment ' s refusal to allow him back into amateur competition . In 1990 , the International Skating Union ruled on the pro question , making some , but not all , professionals eligible again . Any skater , like Boitano , who had participated in non-sanctioned competition was still barred . Boitano made no secret of his frustration and his sense of betrayal . &quot; I didn ' t pound on tables , &quot; he says now , &quot; but I constantly began to talk to the press about this. &quot; In a column in Newsweek in 1991 , he explained why he didn ' t just stay an amateur in_order to compete : &quot; My family had generously supported me for 16 years . It was time to stop relying_on them. &quot; But he also made_it clear that he had expected to be able to skate in the next Olympics anyway . &quot; ISU officials assured me , &quot; he wrote , &quot; that my career path would not bar me from entering the Olympics when eligibility requirements were relaxed. &quot; At the 1992 Olympics in Albertville , most observers thought that the sidelined Boitano could have won another gold medal and added some much-needed luster to a ho-hum American team . &quot; The talk from everyone was that I was skating so well , I would have won the ' 92 Olympics , &quot; he says . A few months later , the ISU revised its regulations again , allowing all professionals to regain their amateur eligibility . The press quickly termed it &quot; the Boitano Rule. &quot; Not everyone in the skating world celebrated . American Mark Mitchell , silver medalist in the ' 93 U.S. Nationals , and Canadian champion Kurt Browning , who had placed a dismal sixth in Albertville , complained publicly that Boitano had already had his shot at Olympic glory ( and the wealth and fame it brought ) , so now it was their turn . Boitano ' s desire to return to Olympic skating &quot; rubs a_few people the wrong way , &quot; said Scott Hamilton , a U.S. gold medalist in ' 84 . &quot; He might take a spot away from somebody else. &quot; Boitano responded , &quot; This is not a dance recital , it ' s a competition . If they want to win the spot , then defeat me. &quot; In June of ' 93 , Boitano ' s application for reinstatement was officially accepted . In order to make the U.S. Olympic team , he would need to come_in first or second at the U.S. Championships in January . Bezic again would be his choreographer . By then , Leaver , Bezic and Boitano had already tried_out the short program that he would take_to the nationals and , they hoped , to Norway . ( Skaters perform two routines in competition , a &quot; technical &quot; or &quot; short &quot; program that must include prescribed moves , and a 4 1 / 2-minute &quot; long &quot; or &quot; free &quot; program , worth two-thirds of the final score , that is almost entirely of_their_own devising. ) They were also at_work on a new long program , and , once again , they settled_on a character for him to play , but this time it wasn ' t much of a stretch . To Aaron Copland ' s &quot; Appalachian Spring &quot; and &quot; Lincoln Portrait , &quot; Boitano portrays an American pioneer -- &quot; It ' s the story of going west , &quot; he says . And the story of a pioneering skater ? &quot; I ' m playing myself , &quot; he says . &quot; In the slow middle part , I fold my arms in front of my chest , surveying all my hard work . I ' m proud_of what I see . As far as my skating , this routine allows me to hit a lot of triple jump combinations . The bottom_line with all athletes is , they have to hit the triples. &quot; Boitano always comes_back to the jumps . Skate America in Dallas in October was Boitano ' s first warm-up for the Nationals , and his first amateur competition since March , 1988 . He came_in second to Viktor Petrenko , the 1992 Olympic gold medalist , but he was definitely back . ( The Nationals &quot; seem like little more_than a formality , &quot; said the press. ) Then at the U.S. Pro-Am Figure_Skating Challenge in Philadelphia in December , his final warm-up before the Nationals , Boitano blew away the admittedly spotty competition , amassing the most points of anyone in the event and landing six triple jumps . Amid the showmanship that might be expected at a pro-am event , Boitano ' s muscular and more serious style stood_out clearly . No spangles for him ; he took_to the ice in tights and a billowing silk shirt , both in basic black for the crucial long program . And while his competition mugged for the crowd ( Scott Hamilton hit his signature back flip and greeted his coach with a high five ) , Boitano held onto a game face , breaking it only when he took his bows , as the applause -- a little grudging after the antics of the others -- turned_into a standing_ovation . Hamilton , who took second place in the competition , answered as_many questions about Boitano ' s comeback as his own performance . &quot; He seemed nervous , &quot; Hamilton told reporters . &quot; He has nothing to be nervous about . Jumps are the do or die , and he ' s the best jumper I ' ve ever seen. &quot; But a Russian coach sniffed : &quot; All Brian does is jump . Today , all_the other skaters can jump . It isn ' t so special anymore . ( In Norway ) , the others will beat him on artistic expression. &quot; When Boitano stood_in front of the press microphones , the reporters went_into attack mode . At Skate America , midway through his long program , he had included a spread-eagle that took him from one end of the rink to the other . In Philadelphia , that gliding move was interrupted with yet another jump . One reporter asked why he made the change . Boitano began to answer , then stopped . &quot; I want to get_it right , &quot; he said in his soft , slightly spacey voice . &quot; The judges suggested I put another jump in the slow middle of my performance . I ' m willing to play by their rules . I mean , am I going_to make a statement , or win ? &quot; They asked him about his nagging injuries -- groin , hip , knee , back . &quot; It ' s just about pain , not loss of strength , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t worry about them , or the competition . I just concentrate_on doing my own thing , on staying in my bubble of concentration. &quot; And then , without prompting , he went_on . &quot; I have control over that voice inside me that makes me nervous , &quot; he offered . &quot; Oh my God , yes , I ' m nervous . I ' m nervous ! The competition at the Nationals is going_to be great ! They ' re all great ! But I won ' t chicken_out . I won ' t not take the risk. &quot; LINDA LEAVER IS LATE . SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO arrive_at the Iceland skating rink , east of San Francisco in Dublin , Calif. , 45 minutes ago to answer questions about Boitano . Instead , the rink is deserted , except for a lone hockey_player , a teen-age boy skating past a sign_on the wall that reads &quot; Home of Brian Boitano , 1988 Olympic Gold Medalist. &quot; When Leaver finally shows_up with Boitano , she offers this apology : &quot; I had to wait in_line for Brian ' s Christmas present. &quot; She is smiling , as if all_the world revolved_around her protege . Boitano , who has been doing calisthenics in the lobby , looks over , annoyed , and begins lacing_up his skates . &quot; Linda , you talk while I practice on my own , &quot; he says . Boitano was 8 years old when his mother took him to an Ice Follies show in San Francisco , north of their hometown of Sunnyvale . Soon after , Boitano abandoned his roller_skates and went_to the Sunnyvale Ice Palace , where he met Leaver . After their first lesson , Leaver went_home and told her husband , &quot; One day Brian will be a champion. &quot; The relationship between Leaver and Boitano is an odd one in the figure-skating world . She is less his Svengali than his junior partner . When they first met , Leaver did not have the background of most other high-powered coaches , many of whom were once champions . She had given_up skating in college to devote herself to her family and coaching at the ice_rink . &quot; I don ' t think I had any reputation as a coach when I met Brian , &quot; she says today . &quot; But Brian was so coachable . He told you honestly what his fears were . He builds his own set of standards and tries to equal or succeed them . And he has a love for skating. &quot; Boitano calls Leaver the most technically expert figure-skating coach in the world , and more . &quot; She ' s the best , &quot; he says . &quot; She doesn ' t tell me what to do , she tries to make me be independent. &quot; It started when he was a youngster . &quot; I ' d say , ' Tell me , Linda . I ' m scared to death. ' And she ' d say , ' You ' ll know what to do when you ' re out there. ' &quot; It wasn ' t long before he internalized her confidence . Their relationship has its sore spots , however . Off the ice , she insists on doing everything , from coaching to making airplane reservations to organizing his fan club . Sometimes she overextends herself , as she did this day . &quot; When she messes_up , &quot; Boitano says , &quot; I tell her to get an assistant , but she won ' t . She just promises it won ' t happen again. &quot; While Boitano skates his routine , Leaver keeps glancing at him . &quot; Maybe some skaters have caught_up to Brian ' s jumping , &quot; she says . &quot; But people take his jumping for granted now . He ' s constantly being compared to himself . They expect him to do things he hasn ' t done before . Oh ! Look_at that ! A triple axel . Awesome ! &quot; At 14 , &quot; she resumes , &quot; all Brian wanted to do was go fast and jump . I told people he had creativity and it would come_out in time . Now , he ' s just right . Look ! See the way his hands float up instead of just coming_up . He feels the music now . I can feel what he feels on the ice . He ' s gone that next step from just jumping . He still sends chills down my spine , &quot; she says . When Boitano finishes , after an hour and a half , his face is flushed . &quot; Oh , I had a great time , &quot; he says . &quot; I felt strong. &quot; He has changed into his usual off-ice uniform : sneakers , a baseball_cap pulled low over his eyes and baggy sweats . He heads for his car , a white Volkswagen , and the 40-minute drive to San Francisco , where he lives . This afternoon , he has appointments with an acupuncturist and a physical_therapist . On the drive , he talks_about his childhood . &quot; I lived_in this perfect suburban town , &quot; he says of Sunnyvale . &quot; All these tract homes. &quot; Boitano is the youngest of four children . His father , Lew , is a dapper , gray-haired retired banker . His mother , Donna , worked briefly as a bridal consultant . &quot; It was so typical , &quot; Boitano laughs . &quot; But I had a great childhood . I was very independent and had a great imagination. &quot; Some articles claim Boitano spent most of his childhood in his room , spinning_out fantasies , as if to presage his life as a figure skater . The lonely , misunderstood artist . But Boitano says those stories are not true . &quot; I was a typical boy , &quot; he says . &quot; I played Little_League baseball . My father was the coach . He wanted me to be a baseball_player , too . He never showed it , but I always felt he was disappointed when I became a skater. &quot; It is not hard to envision the dreams Lew Boitano had for his son . In his youth , Boitano Sr . had played professional ball for the minor-league San Jose Bees . So he and his son played catch -- a Norman Rockwell painting , dad tossing the ball , his son catching_it and firing it back . Only Brian Boitano , one can imagine , did not fire it back the way his father hoped , and his father realized his dreams for his son would go unfulfilled . &quot; I wanted to do something different , &quot; says Boitano . &quot; On my own , where I couldn ' t bank on teammates to help me through . I wanted something that relied_on speed and power . You know , jumping_on the ice is like flying at 35 m.p.h. , except that you ' re in control. &quot; Whatever his father ' s disappointments , Boitano has always claimed he had the perfect skating parents , supportive but unobtrusive . They couldn ' t wait for him to drive so he could chauffeur himself to the rink . They treated his skating with the benign neglect of people who did not understand it . To this day , they rarely attend competitions ( although they will travel_to Lillehammer ) , and they decline to be interviewed about their son ' s career . Boitano began to make a name for himself as a teen-age skater ( his first victory was when he was 8 , in a &quot; pixie derby boys &quot; competition ) . As he progressed , Boitano began to resent all_the criticisms that he was just a technical , proficient , powerful skater , without artistry . &quot; If I was a robot on the ice , &quot; he says , &quot; it was because I let them make me into one . I was naturally passionate , but I could see passionate people weren ' t making_it in skating . They don ' t let you have any joy. &quot; He pauses , then adds , &quot; No , that ' s wrong . You don ' t let yourself have any joy . I had to be a robot because what I was trying to do needed to be so technical . I wish I was more passionate in life , but I let skating take that away from me . The judges were hard on me . They were hard on everybody . When I was 14 , a judge told me I ' d never make_it . This invades your psyche . You re-evaluate yourself . Why am I doing this ? Money ? Fame ? I searched my soul . Finally , I realized I was doing_it because I was good at it and I loved it. &quot; Boitano loves to talk . Since his Olympic training began , Leaver has been warning the press away from her charge , so as not to impair his concentration or compromise his training . When she shooed him past a writer at the hotel during the Philadelphia competition , Boitano sent her back a_few minutes later to invite the writer to join him and his parents for breakfast . Lew Boitano talked golf ( &quot; Oh puh -leeze , &quot; Boitano said , &quot; you play 36 holes for what ? &quot; ) . While his mother sat unsmiling , Boitano leaned over the table and whispered to the writer , &quot; So , you interviewed Traci Lords . When my parents aren ' t around , you ' ve got_to tell me all about her. &quot; He grinned , rubbed the palms of his hand together , shoved them between his knees : a typical Boitano gesture . When he gets excited , like a child , he can ' t contain himself . &quot; I want people to say , ' Oh my God ! He ' s the best ! ' &quot; he says without guile . &quot; But I don ' t want to be treated like a star . Ugh . I hate that . Glitz and all that celebrity . You know , people in the Green Room vying for attention . ' I ' m a really simple person , even though I make a lot of money , blah blah blah. ' &quot; For virtually all_of his life , he has focused totally on skating . Walking along a street in San Francisco ' s North Beach one night , searching for an after-dinner espresso , Boitano mentions that someday he would like to open a restaurant . But when ? He ' s too busy -- skating . Finding a seat at a crowded sidewalk coffeehouse , Boitano goes unrecognized . Once the espresso is served , he begins to talk_about his insecurities , his dreams . He ' s afraid he ' s devoted so_much of his life to sport that he ' s missed out on a formal education . &quot; But I know a lot of guys with a college education , and they ' re still clueless. &quot; And he spins dreams much wilder than owning a restaurant . &quot; I ' d like to buy a ranch in the Napa Valley and raise animals . Like a zoo . I ' d even milk cows. &quot; He laughs_at the thought of himself milking a cow . Then it ' s right back to skating . &quot; I ' d have my own ice_rink , &quot; he says , &quot; and after I chased the cows off the ice , I ' d skate for my friends . I could do_it on my own terms . As an athlete , not an artist . I don ' t consider myself an artist , but an athlete . I could have been a sprinter . It ' s all_in the heart . Most other figure skaters couldn ' t be anything but skaters . I ' m an athlete who happened to skate . The judges say I ' m not artistically the best . But when I hit a triple jump and they say it ' s beautiful , I go , ' Ha ! There ! ' I please myself . God , sometimes I wish I was a little guy . They ' re so light and quick . I ' m too big . I hit the ice like a ton of bricks. &quot; He laughs , then says seriously , &quot; What I ' m trying to do with my skating is show the more masculine side of figure_skating . that ' s why I never wear costumes . It ' s not athletic to wear beads. &quot; He raises an eyebrow , and adds , &quot; Do you know , Scott Hamilton once dropped his pants on the ice ? The fans loved it. &quot; He shakes his head . &quot; My fans are mostly women between 16 and 69 . I want to change that image of my sport . I want guys to appreciate me for being an athlete. &quot; AT THE U.S. CHAMPIONSHIPS IN Detroit , Boitano is the first of the truly competitive skaters to take the ice , at 9 p.m. , live_on national television . The night before , he won the technical program , barely beating 21-year-old Scott Davis , from Great Falls , Mont. , the defending U.S. champion . In the eyes of the press , hooked on a comeback story , Davis has already been relegated to second place . The headlines in the sports section of the Detroit Free Press , giving the game to Boitano , read : &quot; Who ' s No . 2 ? &quot; Some skating experts , however , thought that Davis actually had skated better than Boitano in the short program . Davis is handsome , with sandy-colored hair and freckles , and could pass for Tom_Sawyer . In fact , he was often seen around the lobby of his hotel in Detroit with a girl who could pass for Becky Thatcher . The two , scrubbed-looking and fresh-faced , held hands wherever they went . Davis ' dad , a football_coach , is yet another father who was reportedly not happy when his son became a figure skater , but Davis has come a long way in a short time . Once , he idolized Boitano . In Detroit , however , Davis does not seem awed by his hero . He has the easy arrogance of youth , no matter what the press is saying . Boitano , in black again , skates onto the ice to &quot; Appalachian Spring &quot; and immediately hits the first of seven planned jumps . The audience cheers , and then , as Boitano hits jumps Nos . 2 and 3 , the excitement and tension build . He hits the fourth jump so powerfully , it seems he could easily rotate four , not three times , before landing . On No . 5 , he makes a barely noticeable slip . The audience is holding its collective breath now . Boitano leaps for his sixth jump and , in midair , realizes he can ' t pull it off and performs just 1 1 / 2 turns before he lands . He hits the seventh triple without a hitch . He finishes at center ice , spinning to a blur and a thunderous standing_ovation . At the &quot; Kiss and Cry Corner , &quot; where the skaters and their coaches wait for the scores in_full_view of the TV cameras , he talks to Leaver about his performance as the scores come_up , mostly 5.7s and one 5.6 ( out of a possible 6.0 ) for technical merit , and mostly 5.8s for artistic impression . They are good scores , but there is room at the top . When Davis skates , he looks looser than Boitano , more emotional in the face of Boitano ' s natural austerity . After each jump , he smiles , while Boitano ' s face gave_away little except intense concentration . Davis ' jumps are not as powerful or as high as Boitano ' s , but he hits them all , one after another , and draws the audience to him . Davis looks hungry for a victory tonight , and the audience can sense it . His routine is choreographed to &quot; West_Side Story , &quot; and he is right in character -- a finger-snapping gangster from a more innocent time . When he hits his final jump , the audience rises like a huge beast and roars its appreciation . Davis pumps his fist like an athlete who has scored a touchdown and skates_over to the Kiss and Cry Corner . When his scores are announced , 5.8s and 5.9s , it is apparent that he will defeat his onetime idol . Late that night , in the bowels of the arena , Boitano is waiting to go_into the interview room to face the media . Dick Button , the former figure-skating champion , now a TV analyst , goes_over to Boitano . &quot; I thought you skated well , &quot; Button says . &quot; I did too , &quot; says Boitano . &quot; I was real nervous . There was so_much pressure on me. &quot; Boitano has been telling the world all through his comeback that he wanted to take the risk of competition , that it was the opportunity to take that risk that he had really been fighting for , win or lose . But now , it ' s clear just how fiercely he wanted the chance and the win . His smile is at half wattage , his ascetic face looks drawn . He had said before the finals , &quot; I really want to win . If I do , I ' ll be so happy I ' ll practice the day after. &quot; Now that he hasn ' t won , he says he has no plans to practice tomorrow . When Boitano enters the interview room , he takes a seat beside Davis , who is already explaining to the media that he skated conservatively tonight after he saw Boitano ' s missed triple axel . Then he says , &quot; It seemed like a dream to receive such an ovation &quot; when competing against Boitano . His coach , Kathy Casey , is not so magnanimous . She says she was angry at the headlines that had already given Boitano a victory before he skated . When questions are directed toward Boitano , as always , he doesn ' t dissemble . His disappointment is clear . &quot; I ' m not happy someone else came_in first , &quot; he says . &quot; That stupid triple axel ! &quot; The following morning , a number of TV news crews set_up their cameras in the lobby of the Westin Hotel . They are not there to record Boitano ' s entrance , or even Scott Davis ' -- their successes and failures have paled next to what will become The Biggest Story Ever in Ice_Skating , the attack on Nancy Kerrigan . When Boitano appears in the lobby , in baseball_cap and sweats , he is unnoticed . He goes_over to a couch and , staring at the TV cameras , says , &quot; Wasn ' t that terrible about Nancy ? There are really bad people in this world. &quot; He turns his back on the cameras , once again intently focused_on his own skating . He escaped one of his fears -- &quot; cake all_over my face &quot; -- by making the team . &quot; I proved my comeback was serious , &quot; he points_out . Then : &quot; Maybe I ' ll do better as an underdog. &quot; Boitano knows the competition in Norway will be tougher than last night ' s . Besides Davis , the field will include current world champion Kurt Browning , reigning Olympic champion Viktor Petrenko of Ukraine , and Elvis Stojko , silver medalist at the 1993 world competition and , like Browning , a Canadian . &quot; I ' ve never been my best when I ' m in_the_lead , &quot; Boitano muses . &quot; I ' m good , but I ' m not great when I ' m ahead . It ' s just that I ' m always better when I ' m striving for things . Now maybe this will build a fire under me. &quot; AFTER CALGARY , ON AN EXHIBITION tour in Milan when Brian was skating ' s king , he met another golden_boy , Alberto Tomba , the Italian slalom skier . &quot; He snubbed me and turned his back , &quot; Boitano says . It ' s not difficult to figure_out why . Tomba is a big , muscular , handsome man who reeks of jock . When Tomba met Boitano , he saw just another male figure skater , a man in a sport he did not respect . An amiable man , with childlike gestures , breathy enthusiasms and a soft , lilting voice . And Tomba misread all_of it as a sign of weakness as an athlete and a man . Nothing could be further from the truth . Boitano gives the lie to the belief that manhood and true athleticism lie_in a host of superficial , macho mannerisms rather than in the true character beneath them . Boitano may giggle , he may_not slap a friend on the shoulder very forcefully , but beneath those gestures lies a man with the character to compete purely in his sport and excel , for the sheer joy of it , under the most intense , immediate pressure any athlete could ever face . At the last Winter_Olympics , in Albertville , Boitano was forced to sit in the stands and watch . It does not take much of a stretch of imagination to see him there , rubbing his palms together , jamming them between his knees , not in excitement , but rather in frustration . Which was why , later that night , after the Albertville rink was dark and deserted , Boitano and Katarina Witt glided onto the ice -- two former champions skating their own private program . In Lillehammer , the spotlight will once again be his . &quot; It ' s only 4 1 / 2 minutes , &quot; says Boitano , &quot; and you just have to turn it on under pressure when the light hits you . You can ' t make a mistake . You can ' t say I ' m not ready . And if you slip and fall and want to get_off the ice , you have to argue with yourself to go_on . You have to say , ' Shut up , for Chrissakes , and concentrate. &quot;</TEXT>
