   <HEADLINE> HIGH_COURT TURNS_BACK TRIBES ' BID ; GAMBLING : CASINO OPERATORS SOUGHT TO OVERTURN RULINGS THAT A POPULAR VIDEO_GAMING MACHINE CAN BE USED ONLY WITH STATE PERMISSION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned_back a bid by Indian tribes to use a popular type of video gambling machine in their casinos without permission from their home states . The justices refused to consider an appeal filed by eight tribes -- three of them from California -- to lower court rulings that they must have gambling compacts with their states to legally use so-called video pull-tab machines . The action was quickly applauded by California officials who have sought for several years to limit the scope of tribal gambling , saying that much of it -- particularly gambling machines -- is illegal here . More_than a dozen California tribes have installed a variety of such machines anyway , some offering as_many as 1 # 000 in their expanding gambling halls . &quot; It ' s a big victory , &quot; said Deputy Atty . Gen . Cathy Christian , who has represented the state in negotiations with the tribes . &quot; It clarifies any ambiguity about those machines. &quot; The tribes , however , still have a suit pending before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that seeks to force the state to accept wide-ranging casino gambling , including the profitable video devices . The tribes argue that technology employed in the California Lottery ' s own Keno game has , in_effect , &quot; opened the door &quot; for them to offer electronic gambling . A federal judge in Sacramento previously ruled that the state was not negotiating the issue in good_faith . The case that reached the U.S. Supreme Court did not involve all electronic gambling , but one class of machines designed largely for Indian gambling halls . Tribal attorneys argued that these did not need state approval because they are little more_than dispensers of pull-tab tickets , which are legal -- and commonly sold -- in bingo halls . Among the plaintiffs were three California tribes active in gambling -- the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians , the Rumsey Rancheria and the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians -- along with others from North Carolina , Alabama , New Mexico , Washington and Oklahoma . Their suit was prompted by a 1992 ruling from the National Indian Gaming Commission that while the tribes could offer bingo or poker parlors without state approval , the pull-tab machines required compacts -- much like off-track betting , blackjack and other casino gambling . A federal judge upheld the commission ' s decision , as did the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District_of_Columbia . The Supreme Court offered no comment in leaving those rulings intact . The tribes complained that they could lose hundreds of millions of dollars if forced to stop using the machines . Although Monday ' s decision could empower federal prosecutors to seize scores of pull-tab machines being used without state sanction , authorities in recent years have avoided such confrontational tactics when it comes_to tribal gambling , preferring to let the courts first settle the considerable litigation swirling over the multibillion-dollar industry .</TEXT>
