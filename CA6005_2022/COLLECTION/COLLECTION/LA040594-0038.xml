   <HEADLINE> CULTURE ; FAMILY LAW ; PALESTINIANS IN ISRAELI-OCCUPIED LANDS TURN TO TRIBAL TRADITIONS FOR JUSTICE , LEAVING THE PLO AND MILITARY OFFICIALS ON THE SIDELINES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Suppose you ' re a Palestinian cruising through this historic city , chosen to be the capital of a new Palestinian enclave . Then some menacing-looking guy with a black-and-white head scarf and an attitude plows into your car . Who are you going_to call ? The answer to that question says much about justice these days in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories . If you answered the Israeli military_police , try again . Ditto for the Palestine Liberation Organization ' s local office . Or the sheik at the local mosque . Or even a lawyer . These days , when there ' s trouble afoot in Jericho , Abu Ghazi ' s the man to see . Patriarch of the powerful Kaabneh tribe , he holds court in the reception_room off his garden , where he dispenses advice on resolving everything from fender-benders to home burglaries . In Jericho , his word has the force of law in a way the Israeli military authorities never had . And as the chaos and confusion of the transition to Palestinian self-rule evolve , the time-honored prescriptions of Abu Ghazi ' s tribal traditions are questioned by almost no one . Somebody stole your VCR ? Get him and his father in front of Abu Ghazi and get them to give it back to you , plus an apology . Trying to subdivide your land as the pre-autonomy real_estate boom hits Jericho ? Get Abu Ghazi to sort it out with your neighbors . Husband not paying his alimony ? The tribe , backed by the PLO popular committees , will talk him into making payments . &quot; We put our face into the fight , and immediately the fighting stops , &quot; Abu Ghazi explained in a recent interview . &quot; As Palestinians living under occupation , there has been an increase in the number of cases handled under tribal law , because we don ' t want an Israeli who is our enemy to be our arbitrator. &quot; As Israeli authorities ' ability -- and willingness -- to intervene in local disputes wanes on the approach to Palestinian autonomy in Jericho and the Gaza Strip , PLO officials admit that in the time before a Palestinian police_force arrives , they have been unable to take_on the job completely themselves . And as Jericho itself wavers on the edge of the frustration that comes_with continuing delays in the autonomy plan , PLO leaders say they have been more_than willing , in the interim , to hand_over most civil enforcement to tribal traditions . In a society centered on the family from birth until death , the extension of families into tribes has long formed a foundation of Arab society . Political power and business success are often more a function of a person ' s last_name than his skills in entrepreneurship or speechmaking . In Arab societies from Palestine to the Gulf undergoing modernization at a dizzying pace , the old tribal leaders and traditions remain constant reservoirs of respect . &quot; Tribal law has always existed . It was inactive during the intifada ( the Palestinian uprising ) , but now it has been reactivated because Israeli authorities are refusing to investigate crimes , &quot; said Abu Maxim , spokesman for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Jericho . &quot; We are resorting_to tribal law because we don ' t have any other mechanisms to handle these crimes. &quot; Adnan Hamad -- who leads the Palestinian Democratic Union in Jericho , a pro-peace-plan PLO faction -- said PLO officials fear Jericho could descend into the turbulence seen in the Gaza Strip if local political_leaders are not_able to deal with the widening dissatisfaction . That fear has grown in the wake of the February massacre by a Jewish settler of dozens of Palestinians at a Hebron mosque , which has sent violent shock_waves throughout the occupied West_Bank . &quot; Things aren ' t as difficult here as they are in Gaza , but there is a change , &quot; Hamad said , noting that an initial sense of euphoria in Jericho has given_way to impatience . &quot; On Sept . 13 when the agreement was signed , when there was a quarrel between two people , they just smiled and it ' s finished , &quot; he noted . &quot; Now , any single problem becomes a big one , and there is a crowd in the street , shouting and fighting . . . . What we want is to prevent people from hurting each other , and to make people quiet and do their business in the little time that we have &quot; before a final agreement on Palestinian autonomy begins to take_effect . Once the autonomy agreement is signed -- possibly within the next few weeks -- Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho will be subject_to a new national authority appointed by the PLO , with an elected ruling council to succeed it within a matter of months . Gradually , civil rule_in Palestinian population centers throughout the West_Bank will come under the new authority ' s purview . &quot; Here , the people for years have felt there is no authority , and the new authority we ' re going to have is not yet here , &quot; said Hamad . &quot; A lot of disputes that were suspended during the intifada , especially land disputes , have come_to the front of the picture now . With all this traffic , we had 20 car accidents last month , with two killed . What do we do ? We are using what we call traditional law , a law that has always worked for the Arabs throughout history. &quot; Indeed , Palestinians point to an example last month in neighboring Jordan , where King Hussein , in tribal tradition , sat_down the quarreling parties of North Yemen and South Yemen to seek a truce . Tribal laws have even found their way into cosmopolitan East Jerusalem , where the frenetic activity to win a piece of the action as peace dawns has put many_an Arab businessman ' s nerves on edge . Hanna Ghazzawi , whose Petra Rental Cars leases most automobiles in the occupied territories , had sold a car to another businessman , who didn ' t like it and brought it back . Insinuations about the transaction flew_on both sides . In October , Ghazzawi ' s sons were attacked one night outside a restaurant . The attackers , the boys said , were from the Abu Aysha family -- one of Palestine ' s largest and the one that had been involved in the sour car deal . The two sons roared over to the Abu Aysha family_businesses and smashed_up more_than 30 cars there . Israeli police in Jerusalem sent three vehicles to sort_out the mess . Officers took reports and left at 11:30 p.m. Then the real work started . Abu Yacoub , patriarch of the Sharabati tribe , was called_in for a full rundown on the case and left at 2 a.m. for the Abu Aysha house , where he negotiated a three-day truce . Abu Yacoub later went_to the diwaniyya , the traditional Arab reception and meeting_place , of Abu Aysha . The Abu Ayshas said they weren ' t prepared to start talking until Ghazzawi put_up 200 # 000 Israeli shekels , almost $ 70 # 000 . &quot; We paid the 200 # 000 shekels , and they gave us a three-month truce period , &quot; Ghazzawi recalled in a recent interview . &quot; In Arab tribal law , the three months are important to defuse the high emotions . And within this three-month period , no one of us is to attack them . And no one from them is to attack us . Because to do otherwise would be to insult the tribal leaders. &quot; On Jan . 21 , one of the biggest events on a Palestinian social calendar then took_place : Ghazzawi invited 200 business_leaders , politicians , dignitaries and family friends from as far away as Bethlehem , Gaza , Hebron and Nazareth for lunch , then paraded with them in a caravan to Ramallah for the sulha -- the official process of mending under tribal law -- with the Abu Aysha clan , which had 200 of their closest friends and neighbors on_hand as well . Tribal leaders consulted alone first . Abu Aysha agreed to give_back 135 # 000 shekels of Ghazzawi ' s 200 # 000-shekel down_payment on justice ; he kept 65 # 000 shekels for his damaged cars . &quot; We were received inside . We shook hands , we hugged , we kissed and we made_up , &quot; Ghazzawi said . &quot; Somebody stood_up for me from the tribe and thanked them for demonstrating goodwill . Hearts became clean and white . And that was the end of it. &quot; In Jericho , Abu Ghazi conducts similar sulhas for any imaginable sort of offense , including murder . Recently , when a young_woman was kidnaped from her home_in Jericho and found dead nearby , the police were powerless to investigate , as were local PLO officials . that ' s when the elders started asking questions , and it began to look as if the woman ' s father-in-law was the culprit . Tribal leaders from Bethlehem , Hebron , Ramallah and surrounding villages were called_in . &quot; We knew that there was going_to be a huge amount_of_money that was going_to have to be paid in this case , &quot; Abu Ghazi said . By agreeing to pay 15 # 000 Jordanian_dinars , about $ 21 # 000 , as truce money -- thus possibly avoiding a murder by the woman ' s family -- the man essentially admitted his guilt , in Abu Ghazi ' s view . &quot; The minute he paid the initial money , he was guilty , and I would say he will end_up paying 50 # 000 or 60 # 000 dinars more , &quot; he said . &quot; There are different degrees of punishment , and the punishment depends_on the intensity and the intention of the crime , &quot; he said . &quot; There are many times when something happens by accident , where tolerance and forgiveness seem to be the appropriate response . And of course we can ' t send people to prison , so we have to increase the fines they must pay. &quot; Palestinians who are busily drafting new legal_codes for self-rule scoff at the prospect that the tribal ways will play any role in the Palestine of the future . They say it is decades of Israeli occupation that have created the present situation . &quot; In the Gaza Strip , this traditional way of dealing with things through sulha , it was almost vanishing before the occupation , because the Palestinian civilian judicial_system had created a means of dealing with civil disputes , &quot; said Raji Sourani , director of the Gaza Center for Rights and Law . After Israel ' s occupation in 1967 , he said , the Israelis transferred much of the authority to military_courts in cases ranging from traffic offenses and drugs to taxation and theft , and ordinary decisions of the civil magistrate often went unenforced . &quot; The credibility of the system is gone , and for the people , what to do ? What ' s the alternative ? The alternative was in a way of having this sort of tribunal law , and unfortunately , people have begun to be more and more dependent_on it. &quot;</TEXT>
