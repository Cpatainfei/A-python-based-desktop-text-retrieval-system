   <HEADLINE> NME HOSPITAL PROBED FOR ALLEGED KICKBACKS ; HEALTH_CARE : FBI INVESTIGATING WHETHER CENTURY CITY FACILITY GAVE DOCTORS INCENTIVES TO INFLUENCE REFERRALS . HOSPITAL SAYS ALL WAS LEGAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Back in 1989 , Century City Hospital created what it hoped would be a premier center for the treatment of back and spinal injuries . It recruited top-notch orthopedists and neurosurgeons to form the West Coast Spine Institute . To attract such talent , the hospital -- one of Santa Monica-based National Medical Enterprises ' most prominent general hospitals -- devised a complicated agreement under which it would help manage the doctors ' practices and also arrange for medical office space near Century City Hospital so the doctors could practice together at one location . The arrangement never lived_up_to Century City ' s expectations , and now the FBI is investigating allegations that the hospital may have violated federal anti-kickback laws . The investigation focuses_on whether assistance offered by Century City was in_effect a kind of payment to doctors at West Coast Spine to influence them to refer patients to the hospital , knowledgeable sources told The Times . Deals similar to the Century City arrangement are common among the nation ' s 5 # 300 general hospitals . But federal regulators have long suspected that many of the deals may be illegal . Now the Clinton_Administration , as part of an effort to crack_down on abuses that contribute to the spiraling cost of health_care , has stepped_up investigations of specific deals considered questionable and has signaled that it will test the legality of more cases in court . Critics charge that doctors involved in such arrangements may make patient referrals based on_their_own financial interest , and that patients may end_up paying more for health_care and may_not get high-quality care . Officials of NME asserted that Century City Hospital did not violate any laws in its arrangement with West Coast Spine . &quot; It was a very innovative , cutting-edge concept that turned_out to be a very complicated , ill-fated idea , &quot; said Christi Sulzbach , a National Medical senior_vice_president . &quot; It did not bind these physicians in an exclusive fashion to Century City , and it was not a payment-for-patients relationship. &quot; The probe of Century City is part of a sweeping federal fraud investigation of National Medical . Century City is the first of National Medical ' s general hospitals to be identified as a target of the overall investigation , which focuses mostly on National Medical ' s psychiatric_hospitals , most of which it has sold . The company has said that acute care , general hospitals will form the core of its business , and charges of wrongdoings in that segment could further tarnish the company ' s image . Federal law generally prohibits health_care_providers from giving or receiving financial inducements for referrals of Medicare or Medicaid patients . The law is intended to limit the corruptive influence of money on a doctor ' s patient referral decisions so doctors will be more likely to base their referrals on the issues of price and quality . The FBI is investigating whether Century City Hospital paid kickbacks to some West Coast Spine Institute doctors , in the form of below-market office rentals or remuneration for office overhead expenses , to influence doctors to perform more surgeries at the hospital , sources said . To recruit doctors , many hospitals pay a portion of the rent on physicians ' medical offices , pay their medical malpractice premiums or guarantee that doctors will receive a minimum annual income , lawyers said . Such practices became widespread in the 1980s as competition in the health_care field intensified and hospitals struggled with declining occupancy_rates . There has been confusion within the medical field about which types of hospital-doctor deals fall within the bounds of the law . Health_care lawyers say the federal_government ' s increased enforcement activity -- and legislation pending in Congress -- should establish clearer standards . Patric Hooper , a Los Angeles health_care lawyer , said the anti-kickback laws have &quot; been a very gray area for some time and have not gotten much clearer. &quot; * Said one hospital industry official : &quot; The line between what ' s legal and what ' s illegal is a fuzzy one , but some hospital chains definitely write contracts that , if tested in court , would likely prove to be_on the illegal side. &quot; Health_care kickback cases pose a challenge for federal prosecutors because it is usually difficult to demonstrate that financial incentives offered to doctors were intended to influence their referrals . &quot; These contracts almost never say you ' ll be paid_for a referral , &quot; one law_enforcement source said . &quot; Often there is no evidence of quid pro quo. &quot; But hospital industry officials and health_care lawyers said National Medical gained a reputation during the 1980s for some of the most aggressive physician recruiting practices in the industry . &quot; National Medical set the standard for how far out on the limb you were going_to go , &quot; one San Francisco health_care lawyer said . &quot; It became sort of a reverse arms race , where the most aggressive people set the standard. &quot; But Sulzbach said National Medical began reviewing its hospital-doctor business_deals in 1991 , following widely publicized reports of problems in its psychiatric_hospital business . &quot; I think for the last three years we ' ve been the most conservative in the industry , &quot; she said , &quot; to_the_point where people who run our operation say we ' ve been competitively disadvantaged. &quot; Dr. Elliott Blinderman , president of West Coast Spine Institute , declined to comment . Sulzbach described the Century City Hospital-West Coast Spine deal as a well-intentioned plan &quot; to enhance our services &quot; for the hospital ' s patients . &quot; There was no commitment from these physicians that they would shift their practices away from UCLA or Cedars or that they would exclusively use Century City Hospital . . . &quot; Sulzbach said . &quot; Certainly we hoped that if we helped bring_together this group of world-class physicians that some of their practice would be at Century City , and our patients would benefit from that . You hope they will be able to use some of the hospital ' s services . But that ' s part of doing business. &quot; In the past year , she noted , the doctors finally began practicing together at an office in Century City . National Medical said in April that it expected to settle all federal and state fraud investigations for about $ 375 million , which would be the largest fraud settlement ever in the health_care industry . Such an agreement would include any possible fraud charges against Century City Hospital .</TEXT>
