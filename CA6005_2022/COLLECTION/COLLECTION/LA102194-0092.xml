   <HEADLINE> OZONE RANKING AMONG WORST ; ENVIRONMENT : POOR COUNTY SHOWING OCCURS DESPITE SIGNIFICANT SMOG REDUCTIONS IN PAST TWO DECADES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Only 12 areas in the nation registered worse ozone pollution than Ventura County last year , according to new Environmental Protection Agency statistics released this week . The county also ranked sixth worst in the nation for the number of days that air quality failed to meet federal health standards for ozone pollution . The poor showing for 1993 comes despite some of the most stringent regulations in the world and significant reductions in smog over the last 20 years , area pollution control officials said . The county ' s air quality failed to meet federal health standards on 122 days in 1974 , compared to 13 days in 1993 and 15 days so far this year , said Bill Mount , deputy director of the Ventura County Air_Pollution Control District . The EPA shows that the county ' s air did not meet standards on 18 days in 1993 . But EPA figures include a state-operated station that is not included in county figures . Peak concentrations of ozone , a primary component of smog , also dropped substantially from 0.260 parts per million in 1974 to 0.150 parts per million or less this year and last year . &quot; We don ' t necessarily pollute more per capita than other areas , but we have the perfect conditions for smog , &quot; Mount said . &quot; We have the right topography and meteorology with the onshore winds that blow everything into the inland valleys , and we have a lot of people. &quot; The EPA report still classifies the county as having a &quot; severe &quot; air quality problem , a category exceeded only by the Los Angeles area ' s &quot; extreme &quot; rating . Those designations have not changed since 1990 . The latest annual statistics , released Wednesday , come less than three weeks before the Ventura County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider the county ' s new plan to guide clean air programs over the next 10 years . The county , along with other areas of the nation , is required by amendments to the federal Clean Air Act to write a plan showing that the county ' s air will no longer fail the health standards by 2005 . But the county ' s new plan , which is to be considered Nov . 8 , does not contain enough measures to meet the standards . The standards require that the ozone concentration in the air must_not exceed 0.120 parts per million on more_than three days during a three-year period . * The county has already tightly regulated most of the pollution sources within its control , including emissions from businesses and industries such_as manufacturing operations , power_plants , dry_cleaners , roofers , auto body shops and others , Mount said . Only the state and federal_governments have jurisdiction over major polluters such_as cars , ships , trains and interstate trucks , which account_for more_than 50 % of the pollutants that cause smog . Agricultural sources such_as pesticides also cannot be regulated by the local air_pollution district . However , with state and federal measures that will become available after a federal clean air plan is adopted in February , the county will be able to show it can meet clean air goals by 2005 , said Scott Johnson , manager of planning for the district . The state and federal_governments both are working_on regulations to control emissions from pesticides , he said . The state has a new mobile source plan to require use and manufacture of cleaner cars for use in the state . * And a federal plan , which is_due to be adopted on Feb . 14 , will include provisions to curb pollution from ships , trains and interstate trucks . That document , called the Federal Implementation Plan , was drafted by the EPA on court_order after districts in Ventura , Sacramento and the Los Angeles area failed to show in their 1982 air quality plans that air quality would meet federal standards by 1987 . The federal plan , which contained some provisions in its draft form that many business and government leaders feared would devastate the local economy , will be imposed on the three areas after it is adopted . But the county can then take appropriate measures from that plan and from a similar state plan and incorporate them into a revised 1994 Air Quality Management Plan , Johnson said . &quot; We ' re recommending that we do a 1995 revision to our plan almost before the ink is dry , &quot; he said . &quot; But the important thing is that we ' re showing we won ' t need the ( federal ) measures that are generating the most controversy. &quot; Johnson referred to one provision in the draft EPA plan that called_for industry to reduce emissions 25 % every year , regardless of whether they had already cut emissions by installing state-of-the-art equipment . The only way to achieve those goals would have been to cut production , business and air_pollution officials said . A second provision in the draft plan would have allowed large trucks coming from out of state to make only one stop in the county . That provision would have caused trouble for the agriculture industry , which depends_on the same vehicle picking_up loads from several packinghouses and fields . The EPA determines the severity of air quality problems based on the number of days that federal health standards are not met .
