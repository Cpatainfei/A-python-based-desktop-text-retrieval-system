   <HEADLINE> VALLEY INTERVIEW ; LAWYER SEES THE POOR STRUGGLE AGAINST POVERTY ' S VICIOUS CYCLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lew Hollman is a senior attorney at San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services Inc. The nonprofit center in Pacoima provides legal assistance to low-income residents and advocates on their behalf in court . The center has been involved in civil suits against government_agencies and private parties on matters that adversely affect the poor . During the 17 years that he has worked_at the organization , Hollman has assisted many welfare recipients . He notes that the views expressed here are his own and not necessarily those of the center . He was interviewed by Times staff writer Jocelyn Y . Stewart . * Question : What has been the trend over the last few years in terms of welfare assistance ? Answer : In real value , welfare assistance has declined since the early 1970s . There was actually a period in the late 1970s when benefits were going_up somewhat because California had an automatic cost_of_living increase . But assistance has dropped very dramatically , particularly in the last 10 to 15 years . The actual benefit levels today in real terms are lower than they were 20 years ago . When you adjust the real purchasing power of benefits , they haven ' t kept_up with the cost_of_living . that ' s particularly heightened in California , especially in Los Angeles , because the housing costs here are higher than almost any other place in the country . Q . In his proposed budget , Gov . Pete Wilson has included more cuts . How do families cope_with less assistance ? A . It ' s hard work to be poor . You have to be constantly looking_for every piece of assistance you can get . You have to find_out which churches you can go_to to get a coat for your children when theirs are stolen or worn_out . You have to know where you can get sandwiches toward the end of the month when you don ' t have enough food left . Many people are reduced to begging , which is something one saw rarely 15 or 20 years ago . Routinely I see mothers with_children at the Hughes Market in Mission Hills on Sepulveda . I see them at Alpha Beta where I shop in Sylmar . I see them in the parking_lot at Pace . These are people who can ' t meet their very basic needs with the government benefits that they receive . Q . What is the relationship between welfare benefits and homelessness ? A . That is why there is an incredible problem of homelessness in California . The benefit levels are simply not at a high enough level to enable people to get affordable housing , and you have a phenomenon that we ' ve seen in the last 10 or 15 years where housing becomes an optional expense for families . Sometimes families give_up housing because they can ' t pay_for housing and meet their other needs . They will periodically move_in with relatives . Periodically they will sleep_in the car . And periodically they will find themselves in shelters . What I see as perhaps one of the hardest things about being poor is living_in constant uncertainty and stress . You can never build a stable household when you don ' t know if you can pay your rent the next month , when you run_out of food toward the end of every month and don ' t know how you ' re going to feed your children . This is the kind of tension people live with trying to make ends meet . It ' s incredible . Q . Some have argued that because benefit levels are actually too low to solely support recipient families , many welfare recipients end_up working or find other ways of getting money . Have you seen this in your clients ? A . There ' s a perception sometimes that a lot of people on welfare are working_on the side . It ' s impossible to know exactly , but my own opinion is there are not a lot of people who are able to -- simply because there aren ' t jobs for most of the people who are_on welfare . Any jobs that provide decent wages are legal and are reported and people know that the state cross-checks unemployment insurance tax and Franchise_Tax Board information with the Welfare Department . If people work and don ' t report it , they get caught . People on welfare are required to report all earnings . Q . What about those people who might want to work but need some assistance ? A . There are disincentives toward people working their way off welfare because their costs go_up and their income can go_down . In other words , the costs of employment can negate any gains they get . What ' s really remarkable , though , is that people struggle very hard to get_off welfare . Most people hate being dependent_on welfare and would prefer employment . The problem is the employment isn ' t there . Q . What is your opinion of President Clinton ' s proposed welfare reform that would require welfare recipients to work after two years of training ? A . I don ' t know anyone who works in the field of welfare that doesn ' t want to end welfare as we know it . The part that most of us like about the proposal is that after the end of those two years , if people can ' t find jobs , jobs will be found for them . What is distressing about the plan is that , at_the_same_time , the Clinton_Administration says the overall costs of the plan won ' t go_up . There ' s a contradiction between those two things . It costs money to create jobs , and that has been the major reason why programs that succeed in transitioning people off welfare have not been pursued . They cost more . In the long_run they would cost less . You could break the cycle of poverty if you gave them training and were supportive of their employment until they had the skills and the experience to continue or find a job in the private sector . The kind of reform that is reform in name only is what Gov . Wilson has proposed . After six months on welfare , you cut the grants across the board if the people haven ' t found jobs . that ' s called welfare reform , but really that ' s just deficit reduction on the backs of poor people . Everyone knows the jobs aren ' t there for these people . Q . If we ' re looking_at a situation now where even people with college degrees and many years of experience are unemployed and unable to find jobs , how then can a program expect to , in two years , train a person to go_out into that same job market and find a job ? A . That is indeed the challenge . I don ' t think there ' s a simple answer to it . I think that you are going_to have to create economic opportunity . You ' re going to have to train people to do_work that is necessary in the economy , and I think that can be done . Most economists believe that what ended the Depression in the ' 30s was production gearing_up for World_War_II . It seems to me that if production can be geared_up for a totally socially destructive enterprise like war and generate jobs and stimulate the economy , we ought to be able to do_it for more positive things . We ought to be able to do_it to build houses , to build roads , to build schools , to build hospitals . Q . What ' s fueling the current climate of welfare reform and reduction ? A . It ' s the economy that has generated both the increases in welfare costs and the frustration of people about the existing welfare system . In the 20th Century , we have to recognize that in a modern , industrial society being unemployed and without funds doesn ' t mean you ' re immoral . But when people see budget_deficits , when they see services declining , when they ' re worried about their own jobs , they get very frustrated about welfare payments , and it ' s very easy to translate that frustration into anger at the people who are_on welfare . Some politicians are willing to feed into that frustration and anger . Q . There ' s also been some discussion about generational welfare . For example a woman who might have been_on welfare with a child and that child , now a teen-ager or young adult , is now on welfare , creating a continuous cycle of poverty . A . First of all I think a lot of that discussion , about the so-called underclass , is exaggerated . There are people who are skeptical of any sociological concept that sort of defines itself only in terms of a negative behavior . In other words , you look_at the small percentage of people on welfare who have been there for two or three generations , and you try to define them as a uniform group of some sort . There ' s a story : Ernest Hemingway once was talking to F . Scott Fitzgerald . Fitzgerald said , &quot; Ernest , you know rich people are different than we are. &quot; And Hemingway said , &quot; that ' s right . They have more money. &quot; My own view is that poor people are different from us -- they have a lot less money . But the similarities are a lot greater than the differences . When people interview people on welfare , including families that have been_on for a_couple_of generations , their aspirations and their goals for their children are just the same as most middle-class families . They would like their kids to get a job . They would like a home of_their_own . Q . What will it take_to help families that have been_on welfare for a long_time and others find jobs and become self-sufficient ? A . What it will take_to get families that have been_on welfare a long_time off is education and economic opportunity . that ' s very simple it seems to me , and people want to make_it more complicated like they have some character defect , and it ' s just not true .</TEXT>
