   <HEADLINE> PULITZER DREAM CAN TURN INTO NIGHTMARE ONCE IT COMES TRUE ; AUTHORS : SIX-FIGURE ADVANCES , BEST-SELLER LISTS , HOLLYWOOD DEALS ARE AMONG TRAPPINGS . DOWN SIDE IS OFTEN MORE STARTLING AND LESS TANGIBLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two days , six bouquets and an entire roll of fax paper after winning the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for &quot; The Shipping News , &quot; novelist E . Annie Proulx realized something startling . &quot; I ' ve become a thing , &quot; she said . She sounded both delighted and relieved . Delighted , because the Pulitzer is &quot; a very , very , very major thing , a big heavy-duty. &quot; Relieved , because she was finally beginning to make_sense of the bedlam that surrounded her . Proulx ' s Pulitzer capped a year that had already brought her three major prizes : the PEN-Faulkner Award for &quot; Postcards , &quot; her first novel ; and the_Irish Times International Fiction Prize and the National Book Award for &quot; The Shipping News , &quot; her second . &quot; I thought I was hardened , &quot; said Proulx , a no-nonsense woman whose manner over the course of an hourlong interview shifted from friendly to flinty and back . &quot; But this is different. &quot; So it is . Unlike most book awards , the Pulitzer Prize arrives without warning . No short_list of finalists is made public in_advance by Columbia University in New York , which administers the awards . Winners generally hear the news from the first enterprising reporter able to get them on the phone . The year ' s most publicized literary trophy may also be the most lucrative . Winners of the fiction prize routinely show_up on best-seller lists , command six-figure advances and get courted by Hollywood . They also get horrifying amounts of mail that will never be answered , backbiting reviews by lesser writers in the throes of Pulitzer envy , and endless demands that have little or nothing to do with writing . It ' s a great time to be pregnant , says 1992 winner Jane Smiley , who was , and a terrible time to have call-waiting , says 1993 winner Robert Olen Butler , who did . &quot; In the eight to 10 days after my winning , the phone only rang eight or 10 times , &quot; he said . &quot; In fact , another 250 to 300 calls daisy-chained their way through my life in that week and a half. &quot; Not so for Proulx . Her phone rang . And rang . And rang . The fax machine never stopped faxing . The flowers kept coming . So did the reporters . Eventually , she said , &quot; I got frightened. &quot; So she picked_up the phone and called Butler , last year ' s winner for &quot; A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain , &quot; a collection of short_stories about the legacy of the Vietnam_War . &quot; How long does_it last ? &quot; Proulx asked Butler . &quot; For the rest of your life , &quot; he replied . &quot; The first eight words of your obituary have been written . Pulitzer Prize-winners become icons of literature . You represent something . You can either play with it and have fun or not. &quot; He then passed along some advice given to him by Pulitzer Prize-winner Oscar Hijuelos , whose novel , &quot; The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love , &quot; won the 1990 prize : &quot; Get ready to take a warm bath in your own life. &quot; For Proulx , who lives_in splendid isolation in a tall , weathered house tucked beside an anonymous dirt road in a town of a_few hundred people , it felt more like an icy shower . Her calendar was already crammed with literary commitments that would take her away from the things she likes best : fishing , canoeing and partridge hunting . How could she possibly squeeze in more ? There was also the house she ' d just bought_in Newfoundland , where whales play in the front_yard and icebergs float past . When would she ever get time to spend there ? Rugged and wild , Newfoundland is Proulx ' s idea of heaven . It ' s also the setting for &quot; The Shipping News , &quot; the story of a widowed , third-rate newspaperman who builds a new life for himself and his children in the abandoned home of his ancestors . Like most of Proulx ' s stories , its central themes are loss of community and the end of a way_of_life . She wrote it during long , leisurely mornings by the wood stove . Now , because of the prize , &quot; I have to learn to write in short spans of attention , to carry my work around on the road. &quot; That may be easier said than done for Proulx , a tireless researcher whose giant jigsaw_puzzle of a novel is pieced together with intricate detail about arcane topics -- how to tie ancient sailor ' s knots , how to prepare seal flipper pie . For Butler , who produced his first four published novels on the Long_Island Rail Road while commuting to work as a business journalist in New York , writing_on the run is old hat . He now does much of his writing on airplane tray tables . In other ways , though , his leap to Pulitzer status was far more dramatic than Proulx ' s . Prior to winning , he had had six novels published during the 1980s &quot; to great but very narrowly pocketed acclaim and absolutely no sales. &quot; &quot; I always say ' relative , ' or ' considerable , ' but in truth , it was absolute obscurity . Mine was the classic overnight reversal , &quot; Butler said . &quot; Your first impulse is to be a slut , to say yes to everything . It ' s hard to say no to opportunities that two weeks before you would have been desperately grateful to have. &quot; An aspiring actor who majored in theater at Northwestern University in the mid- ' 60s , Butler seems ideally suited for literary stardom . &quot; The ham has been sizzling hotly this past year , &quot; said the author , who invited a reporter to feel free to call him back anytime , day or night . This , despite having just returned home to Lake Charles , La. , from &quot; the mother of all book tours , &quot; 40 cities in three months . He likens his Year of the Pulitzer to Miss America ' s reign , except that the Pulitzer never ends . &quot; You ' re no longer Miss America once the age lines start showing around your eyes . But you never stop being the Pulitzer Prize-winner . It affects the pace of your life , the clamor of the quotidian upon you. &quot; His most memorable moment : being recognized by a woman at passport control in Kuala Lumpur . A counterbalancing moment : a reader calling_up his publisher to request a copy of &quot; A Good Scent From a Strange Woman. &quot; Peter Taylor , who won his Pulitzer in 1987 for &quot; A Summons to Memphis , &quot; still chuckles when he recalls his most humbling moment . Having heard about Taylor ' s Pulitzer , a friend asked if he ' d be flying to Sweden to get_it . When he stopped laughing , Taylor explained that he ' d won a Pulitzer , not a Nobel . &quot; A Summons to Memphis &quot; is the story of a man called home by his sisters to stop their widowed father from remarrying . It was the first novel in nearly 40 years for Taylor , 77 , primarily a highly regarded short-story writer whose previous books never sold more_than a_few thousand copies . He ' s since finished two other novels and started a third . &quot; As you get older , &quot; he said , &quot; you get more long-winded. &quot; His late-in-life Pulitzer &quot; didn ' t change things that much . I had my pattern of life all worked out. &quot; He never considered giving_up his teaching posts at Harvard_University and the University of Virginia , but acknowledges he no longer needed to teach for financial reasons . He has since retired . Butler says he will continue to teach creative writing at McNeese State University in Lake Charles , even though he , too , could get_by without his salary . Paperback rights for &quot; They Whisper , &quot; his first novel post-Pulitzer , recently sold for well into six figures . Factoring in foreign sales , screen rights and opportunities on the lecture circuit , &quot; all these add_up to quite a bit of money , &quot; he said . But the greatest reward has been far less tangible . Though reviews of &quot; They Whisper &quot; have been mixed , the Pulitzer has provided &quot; a kind of insulation . I used to be really sensitive to bad reviews . Now they don ' t bother me at all . &quot; It has not or will not change my vision of the world or what I say . But I don ' t have to win anything anymore . The monkey is off my back , and it ' s wonderfully liberating. &quot; Not all winners share Butler ' s love of the limelight . Jane Smiley has chosen to keep a low profile , as evidenced by the message on her answering machine at Iowa State University , where she teaches : No books signed , no talks given , no manuscripts read , no assignments accepted . Thank_you for calling . Smiley won for &quot; A Thousand Acres , &quot; a modern-day reworking of Shakespeare ' s &quot; King Lear &quot; set_on an Iowa farm . Like &quot; A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain , &quot; it appears headed for the big screen . The baby she was expecting when she toasted her Pulitzer with fruit_juice is 18 months old now . She also has two older children , a husband , two dogs , and her teaching job , along with her writing life . &quot; You can ' t get caught_up ; you have to start resisting right away , &quot; she said of the heightened demands that accompany the Pulitzer . &quot; Maybe there ' s a price you pay somewhere down the road , but I ' m willing to pay the cost. &quot; Unlike Butler , Smiley was already fairly well known when she won . &quot; One thing about writing eight books , being around for a long_time before getting famous , you have a long_time to contemplate the potential effects of fame on you . It doesn ' t come as a surprise . I always thought I would just go_on being as I was. &quot; There ' s an added bonus to doing so , she said . &quot; Once you ' ve won the Pulitzer , if you act like a normal person , everybody thinks how great you are . It gains some sort of weird dimension in other people ' s eyes. &quot;</TEXT>
