   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE ROAD TO RECOVERY ; COMMUNITY FEARS LOSING ITS TORN HEART ; SCHOOLS : VAN GOGH STREET ELEMENTARY WAS THE PRIDE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD . NOW IT MAY BE CLOSED PERMANENTLY BECAUSE OF EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It wasn ' t the hilly , tree-lined streets , the handsome two-story homes , or even the proximity to vast parkland that attracted William and Laura Adler to their quiet Granada Hills neighborhood five years ago . They moved to the area so their children could attend Van Gogh Street Elementary School , a quiet , resource-rich campus that some people consider the best-kept secret in the San Fernando Valley . Then the Northridge quake tore open hundreds of crisscrossing cracks across the playground and through the main hallway of the campus , putting the future of the school and the tightknit community in jeopardy . Fearing that the ground under the school has become unstable after the Jan . 17 quake , the Los Angeles Unified School District is moving the students to nearby Frost Middle_School until geological studies are completed that will determine whether Van Gogh will ever be reopened . &quot; I ' d rather lose our house than the school , &quot; William Adler said . &quot; If we ' d lost our house , we could have rebuilt it . This is out of our control. &quot; Like many parents with young children , the Adlers moved to the secluded neighborhood -- nestled in Bee Canyon near 714-acre O ' Melveny Park at the northern edge of the Valley -- so their two daughters could attend Van Gogh . &quot; We heard about it through friends and neighbors , &quot; William Adler said . &quot; We picked that school and moved across the street from it. &quot; With its active parent involvement and strong teacher commitment , the 370-student school is the pride of the neighborhood . Parents boast when they talk_about it , likening it to a private_school in the public_school system -- the shining star of the district . Principal Maureen Diekmann said the school consistently ranks in the top five in the Valley on the state Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills . What makes the recent quake damage at Van Gogh more significant is that similar cracks in the ground opened_up after the 1971 Sylmar quake . A report by the California Division of Mines and Geology suggested that the ground displacement then might have been caused by liquefaction . Liquefaction occurs in areas of loosely packed , fine-grain soil that become saturated by ground_water in an earthquake . Lubricated by the water and hit with shock_waves , the soil loses its cohesion , and turns_into a fluid mass . After the Northridge quake , the Los Angeles Unified School District contracted with two private geotechnical engineering consulting_firms to determine what caused the damage at Van Gogh . Law / Crandall Inc. of Los Angeles , after a preliminary_examination of the ground cracking and a review of reports from the 1971 quake , said that liquefaction did not occur . But Jerry Kovacs and Associates Inc. of Studio City concluded that the school &quot; may_not be safe during an earthquake. &quot; The experts are just beginning fuller investigations of the site , which will include mapping the cracks and boring for soil samples and water_levels -- all_important indicators of the soil ' s propensity to liquefy . Doug Brown , director of facilities for the district , said that if the new studies produce the same results as the preliminary investigations , he will hire another firm for a third opinion . &quot; If there is no common_ground , I have to get another study , &quot; Brown said . &quot; My same standard applies , I won ' t open it if I would n ' t put my children and grandchildren there. &quot; Experts disagree about the dangers of liquefaction , and whether it is wise_to occupy buildings on property where it has occurred in past earthquakes . Some say not enough is known about the seismic hazard to predict its precise effect . In the 1971 Sylmar quake , liquefaction damaged the Lower San Fernando Dam , and in 1989 , the Marina District of San Francisco was devastated in the Loma Prieta earthquake when its solid foundations became fluid . The seismic hazard was first documented in Niagata , Japan , in 1964 , where it caused buildings to sink several feet into the ground . But Ronald Scott , professor of engineering at Caltech , said finding evidence that liquefaction occurred at a site during an earthquake is not necessarily cause for alarm . &quot; I ' ve looked_at a lot of buildings in sites that liquefied very thoroughly , &quot; Scott said . &quot; What happens to buildings is extensive damage that is not necessarily life-threatening. &quot; Scott said homes located on soil that liquefied in a previous earthquake are at risk of damage in another one , but &quot; not likely to be sucked into the soil. &quot; But Edward F . Hill , a geotechnical engineer for Jerry Kovacs and Associates , said liquefaction can be very hazardous . &quot; A house is a different animal than a school building , &quot; Hill said . &quot; Houses will flex , but school buildings can crack and break. &quot; Hill said the final study will take six to eight weeks . &quot; We don ' t know what we ' ve got_up there yet , &quot; said Hill . &quot; We ' re just getting started. &quot; Meanwhile , as neighborhood residents wait for the final analysis , they agonize about what impact that closing the school would have_on their neighborhood , their children and their homes . Jim and Sherri Ramirez , who moved to the community from North Hills so their second-grade daughter could attend Van Gogh , said the prospect of the school closing its doors is frightening . &quot; We moved here specifically because of the school , &quot; Jim Ramirez said . &quot; I don ' t know what I ' d do if it closed . I ' d be extremely upset. &quot; Ramirez added that a decision to close the school might also have long-term , negative repercussions in the neighborhood . &quot; If you take the school out of our area , you lessen the value of where we live , &quot; Ramirez said . &quot; And having the stigma of a school abandoned for geological problems . Who ' s going_to want to move_into that area ? &quot; Julia Jones , a real_estate_broker who has been selling properties in the area for 23 years , said the school is a powerful magnet for parents with young children . &quot; I don ' t think ( closure ) would destroy the community , &quot; Jones said . &quot; But it would hurt because that school is a very important part of the neighborhood. &quot; Other parents worry about the potential impact on their children . &quot; It would be traumatizing , &quot; said Debi Chesler , whose daughter attends fourth grade at Van Gogh . Chesler said she felt secure knowing that her daughter , who is diabetic , attended a small school where teachers and administrators knew of her condition . &quot; Having her transferred to a larger school would be traumatic for all_of us , &quot; she said . For many residents , the possibility that liquefaction -- something most people know little about -- may have occurred in their neighborhood is equally unsettling . &quot; If they are saying the ground at the school is unstable , what does that say for our homes ? &quot; said Peggie Needleman , who has an 8-year-old daughter at the school . &quot; If you went_to buy a house , are you really gonna buy a house across from the school ? I don ' t think so. &quot; Because so many factors -- including proximity to the epicenter , soil compaction , ground-water levels and underlying fault_lines -- determine the damage caused by an earthquake , some experts say predicting whether one area will fare better than another is a shaky science at best . &quot; As far as the Southern California region is concerned , the hazards are the same everywhere , &quot; said Prof . Scott of Caltech . &quot; Of course , you ' d be better_off in Wisconsin. &quot;</TEXT>
