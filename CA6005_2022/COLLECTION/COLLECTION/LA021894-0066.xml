   <HEADLINE> STORM CAUSES ACCIDENTS , SMALL SLIDES ; WEATHER : MORE THAN AN INCH FALLS ON THE VALLEY . ONE MAN DIES IN A COLLISION , AND QUAKE- WRACKED CSUN IS TURNED INTO A MUDDY BOG .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A powerful Pacific storm dumped more_than an inch of rain on the San Fernando Valley on Thursday , triggering dozens of traffic accidents and minor landslides and transforming the quake-crippled Cal State Northridge campus into a muddy bog . A 23-year-old Woodland Hills man died as a result of the rains when he lost_control of his speeding car and collided head-on with an oncoming vehicle on Topanga Canyon Boulevard about 9 a.m. , said Los Angeles Police_Officer Theresa Gordon . Police had no estimate of the number of rain-related traffic accidents , except that there were many of them . &quot; Today is no different than any other day when it rains , &quot; said Sgt . Paul Modrell of the LAPD ' s Valley traffic division . &quot; On rainy_days , it seems we can ' t put enough officers on the streets for all_the fender-benders. &quot; In another accident on Malibu Canyon Road , 21-year-old Michelle Faircloth of Calabasas narrowly escaped serious injury when a boulder the size of a kitchen_stove fell onto the roof of her compact_car about 7:40 a.m. Her boyfriend , Paul Barton , who was driving about 100 feet in front of her because the road conditions were so poor , pulled her from the wreckage . &quot; I was looking in my rear-view mirror and I saw her lights shut_off and I knew something was terribly wrong , &quot; Barton said . &quot; I sprinted to her car , and when I got there I thought she was dead. &quot; She was &quot; very lucky . . . to be alive , &quot; California Highway Patrol Officer Dave King said . Faircloth , a senior at Pepperdine University , was treated at Westlake Medical_Center for a broken collarbone and released but sought another medical opinion and underwent surgery at West Valley Hospital and Health Center later in the day . On the Antelope Valley Freeway near San Fernando Road , a semi-trailer truck slid out of control and its trailer overturned about 10:30 a.m. , blocking southbound traffic for nearly 90 minutes , CHP Officer Bill Granados said . Rain-drenched earth churned from reconstruction efforts at CSUN , which was devastated one month earlier by the magnitude-6.8 Northridge earthquake , reduced the 353-acre campus to a muddy mess . Yet most students and teachers seemed to take another day of difficulty in stride . &quot; It was leaking this morning , but the students did all_right , &quot; said Carlos Guerrero , a part-time Chicano studies instructor who taught a morning class in one of the hundreds of portable modular classrooms that have been set_up throughout the campus to temporarily replace damaged buildings . Guerrero said he saw a woman slip and fall_in the mud while walking across the campus but added , &quot; She got_up laughing. &quot; But for some , the rain was the final straw . &quot; How am I supposed to get_to class ? &quot; asked senior Delores Evans , as she looked_out onto the muck between her and the modular unit that serves as her engineering classroom . &quot; I ' m not walking in that . . . not with my new rain boots on anyway . It ' s time for me to go_home , &quot; she said . The downpour delayed by one day the assembly of several hundred more portable classrooms , but university officials expect the work to be completed by Monday . Workers were able to protect rare books and other materials at the Oviatt Library by covering the roof with tarps , said Elliot Mininberg , CSUN ' s vice_president for administration . More_than an inch of wind-driven rain hammered the fragile slopes above Malibu early Thursday morning , but most of the runoff was manageable . By late morning , the rain had begun to slacken , the sun was beginning to peek through and residents who had fled their homes were returning . In Malibu , where the Pacific Coast Highway was blocked and 25 homes below the charred hillsides were invaded by mud last week , residents were_better prepared on Thursday , their houses protected with sturdy makeshift barriers that diverted the flow into runoff channels . Caltrans crews used skip-loaders to scoop water and mud from a pond that grew but never overflowed above Pacific Coast Highway at the base of Big Rock Drive . Some of the homeowners stood_guard against the torrent that never came . Barry McManus , wearing a plastic trash bag for a raincoat , waited in front of his four-unit apartment_building that was damaged by mud Feb 7 . &quot; we ' ll stop it this time , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re doing more sandbagging and we ' re going to keep the flow moving with a fire hose. &quot; A_couple_of houses away , Randy Brant , 42 , explained that he left his garage doors open this time so that any mud seeping in one end could flow_out the other . &quot; If I ' d done that last time , everything would have been OK , &quot; said Brant , who lost a car , a washing machine and golf_clubs during last week ' s storm . Last week , Brant drove a golf_ball down PCH with a salvaged club while waiting for Caltrans to reopen the road . &quot; The best thing then was that my friends back East saw me tee_off on TV and hit a car with a golf_ball , &quot; he said . Other residents decided to play it safe on Thursday , leaving their homes as soon as the storm struck . &quot; After the fire , the earthquake , then this , I finally considered leaving for a while , &quot; said Linda Derussy , as she loaded her dog , Sam , into a friend ' s Land Rover . She said she planned to return as soon as the skies cleared . Kent Knudsen , armed with a broom , watched and waited in front of the house on Pacific Coast Highway that he had barricaded with a wall of sandbags 3 feet high . &quot; We got hit pretty hard last time , &quot; he said before ducking out_of_sight to avoid a television cameraman . &quot; Everyone thinks I ' m a victim -- I hate it , &quot; said Knudsen , who was shown being carried to safety on a skip-loader during last week ' s floods . &quot; I have relatives in Colorado sending me photos of myself being saved. &quot; ' As they did last week , the fire-ravaged hillsides of Laguna Beach escaped severe mudslides , despite . 87 of an inch of rain that briefly flooded Laguna Canyon Road and caused a short flash_flood on Canyon Acres Drive at midday . In Costa Mesa , a sudden burst of wind about 10:30 a.m. peeled the roof off a four-bedroom bluff-top home . The Newport Beach Fire_Department arrived five minutes later and nailed plastic over the home to protect the interior from the rain . The main body of the storm moved east into Arizona and southern Nevada by nightfall Thursday , and forecasters expected today ' s weather to be partly cloudy with a chance of showers through tonight . The National Weather Service said skies should remain partly cloudy on Saturday with a renewed chance of showers late Sunday and early Monday . By 5 p.m. Thursday , . 77 of an inch of rain had fallen at the Los Angeles Civic Center , raising the season ' s total there to 4.14 inches , less than half the normal count of 9.71 inches for the date . The rainfall season is measured from July 1 to June 30 .
