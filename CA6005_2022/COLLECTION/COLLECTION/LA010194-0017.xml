   <HEADLINE> VIEWPOINT / LETTERS ; SUBJECT OF SLAUGHTER TOUCHES A NERVE FOR MANY READERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Your article , &quot; They ' re Dying at the Finish &quot; ( Dec . 23 ) by Jody Berger , was a finely written piece which addressed a subject that deserves recognition . There is no excuse for the inhumane conditions referred to in the article . However , to place this as part of a series entitled , &quot; The Business of Horse_Racing , &quot; is misleading and deceptive . The clear implication is that thoroughbred owners and trainers are callous , uncaring individuals with no compassion whatsoever for the animals that perform in their sport . I was the managing partner of Ten Star Stable who claimed Proud Duke on June 18 , 1983 , and proudly raced him for approximately one year . Unfortunately , he suffered a crippling injury and we sent him to a local farm for recuperation , even though we knew he would never race again . He was still hobbling , so I had him shipped to a lady who owned a ranch in Malibu who felt she could better care_for him . He responded magnificently to her care . I ran_into the lady 1 1 / 2 years ago and she informed me that Proud Duke was doing wonderfully . I was totally sickened to find his name at the forefront of your article . What the article fails to mention , however , is the fact that there was over seven years of good care from the time that Proud Duke ' s racing career ended until he met his demise . RICHARD M . HOFFMAN Manhattan Beach * I am a thoroughbred owner and breeder in addition to being a horseman with several riding_horses . I read in complete disgust the so-called &quot; Second in a Series &quot; on The Business of Horse_Racing ( Dec . 23 ) . I guess I just don ' t understand the point . What does the slaughter of livestock through the USDA have to do with the business of horse_racing ? Moreover , what does the actual subject_matter have to do with sports ? I have never met anyone in the sport of thoroughbred racing that does not truly love the animal above anything else . I assure you a very strong bonding with the animal is achieved . At the end of its career , the absolute effort is made to find the animal a permanent home to enjoy the rest of its life . STEVE SHAPIRO Hacienda Heights * The article , &quot; They ' re Dying at the Finish , &quot; made me sick . It ' s a sad excuse when people justify destruction of animals with the bottom_line of a balance_sheet . The description of how these beautiful horses are herded into trucks and brought_to the slaughterhouse should have a familiar ring to anyone who has any knowledge of the Holocaust of World_War_II . Is it any wonder that our society is seemingly inured to the violence that is inflicted upon others all_over the world ? It seems the perpetration of cruelty will always be tolerated as long as too many people don ' t make too_much noise about it . Whether it ' s unspeakable acts against animals or humans , it ' s just another form of &quot; the final solution , &quot; isn ' t it ? BETTINA MOSS Los Angeles * I found your Dec . 23 article entitled , &quot; They ' re Dying at the Finish , &quot; appalling and heartbreaking . Why doesn ' t the state intervene and stop such cruelties ? After all , it receives a double bonanza in revenues , first from the racing industry and later from the subsequent slaughter of these animals . It ' s ironic to see how these majestic creatures are exploited both in life and death by the state and the racing industry . Why is the state looking the other way pretending like nothing is happening ? MARIA DIESTMANN Pasadena * The article about the slaughtering of horses disgusted me . Why are humans so inhumane to all species ? They are cruel to themselves as well as all animals . All that race_horses , which are so ignominiously carted to meat-packing plants , have ever done is serve at the whim of their masters . WALLACE R . DANIELSON San Diego * Contrary to the impression given by the article , &quot; They ' re Dying at the Finish , &quot; there are many people involved in thoroughbred racing doing whatever they can to keep thoroughbreds from slaughter . The author erred in stating that California Thoroughbred Sales ( CTS ) has a baseline price of $ 500 -- the fact is that CTS ' parent company , the California Thoroughbred Breeders Assn . ( CTBA ) , in an attempt to keep race_horses from being sold for slaughter , early in 1993 raised its baseline price to $ 1 # 000 . NATHANIEL B . WESS Executive_Vice_President and General_Manager , CTBA</TEXT>
