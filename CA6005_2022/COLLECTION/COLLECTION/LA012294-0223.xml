   <HEADLINE> NETWORKS AGREE TO MONITOR FOR VIOLENCE ON TV_SHOWS ; MEDIA : ACCORD PRECEDES CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE AND FOLLOWS SIMILAR CABLE PLAN . BUT BROADCASTERS ESCHEW CALLS FOR RATING_SYSTEM AND PROGRAM BLOCKING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The four broadcast networks Friday reached an agreement in principle to use an independent monitor to review their programming for violent content . The agreement comes just days before Congress returns with the regulation of television violence high on its agenda and just as the major cable networks have agreed to use such a system . The cable agreement was contained in an 11-point plan that also calls_for the development of a violence rating_system and endorses technology that would allow viewers to block programs rated as violent from their television_sets . The networks have been unwilling to support the latter two initiatives because they believe_in part that such moves would cause advertiser defections . The network accord , which was finalized in a conference_call Friday by executives of NBC , CBS , ABC and Fox , still must be approved by the heads of the networks . That approval is expected in the next few days , and a formal announcement is likely early next week . Decisions as_to who will run the system , how that person ( or organization ) will be chosen and to whom he will report are still to be worked_out . It is unlikely , however , that the networks will employ the same monitor as the cable industry . In addition , sources say the monitoring system will be a &quot; qualitative rather than quantitative &quot; assessment of network_programming . In a quantitative assessment , actions that are deemed violent are simply tabulated without regard_to context , which means that cartoons and cop shows are given equal weight . The effectiveness of the monitoring system is believed to rest_on the fact that annual reports will be made public and that the threat of negative reactions from advertisers and the public is expected to keep the networks in_line . Network executives are likely to present the plan early next week to Sen . Paul Simon ( D-Ill. ) , who has been pushing for such a monitor system . Simon , reacting earlier Friday to both the cable initiative and the likelihood of the broadcasters ' agreement , said he believed such action would alleviate the pressure for legislation to regulate TV violence . He said , however , that he would prefer that cable and the broadcasters use the same monitor to ensure a consistent approach . Rep . Edward J . Markey ( D-Mass. ) , who introduced legislation on the so-called V-chip , the technology that would enable viewers to block certain programming , said Friday that he believed legislation would be inevitable if the broadcast networks did not join the cable industry in approving the technology and a rating_system . &quot; It ' s all about advertising , &quot; Markey said . &quot; that ' s what this whole debate boils_down to . . . Violence sells. &quot; He said of the V-chip : &quot; Even if a small percentage of parents used the technology , the networks will see declining ratings for violent programs . The result will be less violence on television. &quot; Still , the acceptance of a monitoring system is a major step for the four networks , which have resisted it for months , saying their own standards and practices operations are doing the job . Broadcasters have debated fiercely among themselves over whether a monitoring system would decrease the likelihood of legislation . ABC and CBS have been more receptive to the idea , with NBC and Fox more resistant . Since summer the networks have been taking any steps they thought would help ward_off congressional action . They believed then that they had satisfied lawmakers ' push for action when they agreed to air parental advisories before shows with violent content . It was their understanding , spokesmen say , that Simon would then give them two years to let the advisories work and see what other action they took before pursuing further congressional inquiry . But Susan Kaplan , an attorney on Simon ' s staff overseeing television violence issues , said : &quot; I never heard him say that , and I know that wasn ' t his view. &quot; Simon on Friday termed this week ' s initiatives &quot; a significant shift. &quot; He said he believed the monitoring system would ensure that network programmers continue to show less violence on the air . He said the V-chip was &quot; not something that in my opinion is essential , &quot; adding that the V-chip is &quot; not a substitute for reducing violence on television. &quot; The tensions between the four networks and the cable industry were reflected to some degree in network reaction Friday to the cable plan for regulating violence . For example , Julie Hoover , ABC ' s vice_president of corporate communications , said : &quot; We are delighted that the cable industry has adopted some of the things we have been doing , &quot; referring to ABC ' s Department of Broadcast Standards and Practices , as well as_to the network ' s scheduling of programs . &quot; Virtually all our programs are rated G. &quot;</TEXT>
