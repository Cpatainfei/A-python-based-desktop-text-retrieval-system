   <HEADLINE> FORECAST : CLOUDY JOB HORIZON ; STUDY SAYS VENTURA COUNTY CAN EXPECT FAINT RECOVERY BY END OF DECADE , BUT LARGELY IN SERVICES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The statewide economic recovery is sputtering in Ventura County , where high-paying manufacturing jobs continue to dwindle , and the forecast for job growth this decade is modest at best , according to a recent study by the UC Santa Barbara Economic Forecast Project . There has been a net loss of 6 # 600 jobs in Ventura County since 1990 , according to the report , assembled by a team of researchers and graduate_students at the university . The study ' s most optimistic forecast predicts the number of jobs in the county may return to pre-recession levels by 1997 , with new jobs emerging in the business services and health_care industries . But more restrained projections indicate employment growth will be meager , with the total number of jobs in Ventura County at the end of the decade approaching 256 # 000 , about 9 # 000 more_than in 1990 . That pace would represent a significant departure from the booming job growth of the last decade , when 40 # 000 jobs were created in the county between 1986 and 1990 . &quot; Most of the ( economic ) decline is probably behind us , &quot; said Mark Schniepp , director of the Forecast Project . But the recovery through the remainder of the decade in Ventura County is bound to be faint , &quot; almost to_the_point that you don ' t even notice it ' s occurring , &quot; Schniepp said . The failure of the recovery to gain traction in the county is largely due_to the collapse of the durable manufacturing sector , which traditionally has accounted_for more_than one-fifth of the county ' s high-income jobs , Schniepp said . Durable-goods manufacturers in Ventura County include computer and software makers , as well as aerospace sub-contractors . About 3 # 000 durable-goods manufacturing jobs have vanished in the county since 1990 , when employment in the industry peaked at almost 25 # 000 , the report said . The trend may continue , Schniepp wrote , &quot; as firms defect to other states where less regulation exists and more tax , housing and infrastructure benefits are frequently offered. &quot; Meanwhile , the county must nurse painful economic wounds inflicted by the departure of firms such_as Abex Aerospace , which employed about 1 # 000 workers at its Oxnard plant in the late 1980s . Workers there manufactured hydraulic_pumps used to power airplane flight controls and landing_gear . But the contraction of the aerospace industry caught_up_with the company , based in Kalamazoo , Mich. , and the 33-year-old Oxnard plant was closed_in December . About 50 employees were retained at other sites , a company official said , and all that remains in Ventura County is a 14-person sales office in Camarillo . Because of such layoffs , many formerly highly paid residents have departed for economically healthier climates in states such_as Colorado and Nevada . For the first time since 1948 , more people moved_out of Ventura County in 1993 than into the county , the report said . Such demographic shifts have contributed to the decline of per capita income in Ventura County , which adjusted for inflation , fell from $ 22 # 830 in 1990 to $ 21 # 119 in 1993 , the report said . Retail sales have also suffered , and the deposit base among local banks and S &amp; Ls has contracted 8 % in the two-year period ending June 30 , 1993 , the report said . Property damage in Ventura County from the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake totaled $ 850 million , the report said . Repair work , funded in part by insurance coverage or various federal and state aid packages , is expected to provide a short-term economic stimulus , but rebuilding with borrowed monies will reduce future spending . &quot; The net long-term effect of the earthquake is very likely to be negative , &quot; Schniepp wrote . * Despite the gloomy prospects , Schniepp identified several signs of life in the county . The housing market is experiencing &quot; boom-like conditions , &quot; with home sales in the first_quarter up 54 % compared to the first three months of 1993 , as home shoppers who formerly put_off purchases have rushed to beat rising interest_rates , Schniepp wrote . In May , home sales also rose 33 % over the same month last year , according to Dataquick Information_Systems . But the trend is not expected to continue unless job growth quickens , Schniepp said . The report forecasts long-term job growth in the health_care industry . &quot; As the massive boomer generation ages and transitions toward retirement , the demand for health_care services will rise , and probably dramatically , &quot; Schniepp wrote . A shining example of the potential Schniepp describes is Ventura-based Meditech Health Services . The company was started in 1987 as a temporary nursing service , providing trained employees to understaffed area hospitals , said owner and president Sharon Bick . The company has since expanded to provide home health_care service , and its roster of temporary employees swelled from 200 at the end of 1987 to 400 this year . Bick said she expects 20 % business growth in 1994 and total revenues of about $ 4 million . But not all medical firms are growing . About 100 positions were eliminated when Oxnard-based St . John ' s Regional Medical_Center merged with Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo in February , 1993 , spokeswoman Rita Schumacher said . &quot; We have no plans for further cutbacks , &quot; Schumacher said . &quot; But there won ' t be a move toward hiring a lot of employees over the next couple of years. &quot; Business services , ranging from office security to data processing , are also likely to lead any job expansion in the county , the report said , as larger companies continue to replace permanent employees , and sometimes whole departments , by contracting with outside firms . The UC Santa Barbara study is based on a model and assumptions used by the widely watched UCLA Business Forecasting Project .</TEXT>
