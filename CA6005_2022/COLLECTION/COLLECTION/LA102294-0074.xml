   <HEADLINE> OSCAR WINNER BURT LANCASTER DIES AT 80</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Burt Lancaster , the performer , producer , gymnast and iconoclast -- who from his earliest beginnings was always a star -- has died , his wife announced Friday . The 80-year-old Academy Award winner and onetime top athlete had been in failing health since suffering a stroke nearly four years ago . He died overnight Thursday of a heart_attack in their Century City condominium , Susan Lancaster said , adding that there will be no funeral and that burial will be private . Lancaster had been in relative seclusion since he was hospitalized in Los Alamitos in November , 1990 . He suffered the stroke while visiting a friend in Orange County and lately had refused visitors , even such old friends as Kirk Douglas . The stroke proved the last in a series of physical maladies that had befallen the virile and versatile star of more_than 70 films . In 1983 he underwent multiple coronary_artery bypass surgery , and he continued to suffer from a heart_condition . Even though he filmed &quot; Little Treasure &quot; six months after the surgery and continued working steadily in film and television , Lancaster was denied the title_role in &quot; Old Gringo &quot; in 1988 because of his health . Columbia Pictures decided that insurance on him would be too expensive , and cast Gregory Peck instead . But Lancaster bounced_back from that setback to give a heralded performance in &quot; Field of Dreams &quot; in 1989 , portraying Moonlight Graham , a onetime ballplayer who had a brief brush with athletic glory before becoming a physician . With that role , as with dozens of others throughout his lengthy acting career , it was as though Lancaster had been born for his chosen work . Some actors struggle upward through minor_roles to second leads to star status ; others cite an academic preparation , beginning with collegiate drama courses and progressing through Actors Studio and summer stock to professional acclaim . Lancaster took no courses and played no second leads , but was a bona_fide star from his first screen appearance in 1946 until a_few years before his death . Sometimes his career accomplishments seemed almost too numerous to be real , much less recalled . The Academy Award he won for &quot; Elmer Gantry &quot; in 1960 and the Venice Film Festival award he received two years later for &quot; The Birdman of Alcatraz &quot; were remembered . But many forgot the earlier Oscar he had shared with Harold Hecht as co-producer of &quot; Marty , &quot; which was voted best picture of 1955 . Lancaster ' s work in such major dramatic_productions as &quot; Come Back Little Sheba , &quot; &quot; From Here to Eternity , &quot; &quot; Judgment at Nuremberg , &quot; &quot; The Rainmaker , &quot; &quot; Seven Days in May &quot; and &quot; Atlantic_City &quot; tended to overshadow his work in such films as &quot; Trapeze , &quot; &quot; The Flame and the Arrow &quot; and &quot; The Crimson Pirate , &quot; which displayed the lighter side of his nature . Notified of Lancaster ' s death , Kirk Douglas said their 50-year relationship had been precious . Douglas said that after he survived a helicopter crash a_few years ago , he came_to realize &quot; just how important life and friends really were. &quot; &quot; Burt was not just an actor , &quot; Douglas added . &quot; He was a curious intellectual with an abiding love of opera who was constantly in search of unique characters to portray . . . . Elmer Gantry . . . the Birdman of Alcatraz. &quot; Recalling the films he and Lancaster had made together and the dozens of other pictures that featured the outspoken onetime floorwalker and salesman , Douglas said : &quot; You know , Burt isn ' t really dead . . . . People years from now will still be seeing us shooting at each other . . . still watching him in his many other great films . At least he ' s at_peace now. &quot; Burton Stephen Lancaster was born Nov . 2 , 1913 , in the East Harlem section of New York City , attended Public_School 83 and DeWitt Clinton High_School , and often said he might have &quot; grown_up to be either a cop or a criminal ( his brother became a policeman ; several of his childhood playmates would end_up in Sing Sing ) if it had not been for athletics and the public library. &quot; He was 6 feet , 2 inches tall by the time he was 14 , with a husky physique and quick reflexes that won him an athletic scholarship to New York University . An alert and retentive mind gave him a lifelong fondness for books . But formal education began to bore him by the middle of his sophomore year and he quit college to join the circus . He teamed_up with boyhood friend and gymnastic partner Nick Cravat -- who later joined him for on-camera stunts in &quot; The Crimson Pirate &quot; and &quot; The Flame and the Arrow &quot; -- and formed the acrobatic team of Lang and Cravat , getting a job with the Kay Bros . show at a salary of $ 3 per week and three meals a day . &quot; I knew , &quot; he said in later years , &quot; that I ' d found the kind of thing I wanted to do for the rest of my life -- the only question was what part of the business would be best. &quot; From 1932 to 1937 , the team of Lang and Cravat worked steadily : the Kay Bros . engagement gave_way to a similar ( but better-paid ) one with Gorman Bros . Circus . This was followed by a switch to the Barnett Bros . traveling show , and finally to a tour with Ringling Bros . and Barnum &amp; Bailey -- then , as now , the very top of the circus world in North_America . &quot; But it didn ' t feel quite right , &quot; he said . &quot; I felt something was lacking . Hell , I wanted to talk . . . . &quot; So he quit the act for a while to appear with the Depression-era Works Progress Administration Theater Project . &quot; But it didn ' t really work_out for me , &quot; he told interviewers over the years . &quot; I had formed the habit of eating three meals a day , and that was hard to do on what the Theater Project could afford . So back I went_to Lang and Cravat. &quot; But not for long . A few weeks after his return to the circus , one of his fingers became infected and a doctor gave him a choice : give_up professional acrobatics , or face amputation . &quot; I decided to keep my finger , &quot; he said , &quot; and went looking_for a different kind of job -- outside the circus , even outside the field of entertainment. &quot; Over the next three years he was , by turns , a floorwalker in the lingerie department of the Marshall Field store in Chicago , a salesman in the same store ' s haberdashery department , a firefighter , a truck_driver and an engineer for a meatpacking plant . Returning to New York , he found a job with the Columbia Concerts Bureau ( a CBS network subsidiary supplying music to small_towns across the nation ) . But before he was able to assume his new duties as a booking_agent , he received his draft notice . &quot; I had a wonderful time , &quot; he said , &quot; touring North Africa , Italy and Austria as page-turner for a soldier pianist ! &quot; The World_War_II years did lead to one important contact , however . That was with a USO entertainer named Norma Anderson . They kept_in touch throughout the rest of the war , and as soon as it was over , he used his 45-day discharge furlough and travel voucher to look her up in New York , where she was working for a radio producer . He was in the elevator , on the way to her office , when he became aware of a fellow passenger staring at him . &quot; When I got_off at Norma ' s floor , &quot; he said , &quot; the guy followed , and I have to admit he was really beginning to worry me when he pulled_out a business card. &quot; The man identified himself as an associate of stage producer Irving Jacobs and he invited Lancaster to read for the part of a tough sergeant in a new play called &quot; A Sound of Hunting. &quot; Lancaster got the part and although the play only survived for five weeks , reviewers were unanimous in their praise . They brought film scouts to the play and seven screen contract offers resulted . But he accepted none of them . Instead , he signed with Hecht , who came backstage to make an offer no one else had , telling Lancaster , &quot; In five years we ' ll be making our own pictures. &quot; They shook hands on that , and began a business association that yielded an almost unbroken supply of movies , millions and Oscars for the next quarter-century . Hecht ' s first move was to sign Lancaster to a contract with Hal Wallis calling_for two pictures a year ; the fledgling actor boarded a train for Hollywood , ready to begin work_at once on a film titled &quot; Desert Fury. &quot; But on arrival he discovered that the script was not ready . Producer Mark Hellinger , however , had seen a Lancaster screen_test , and wanted him for the doomed hero role of Swede in &quot; The Killers , &quot; based on Ernest Hemingway ' s short_story . The picture was released in 1946 , and Lancaster became an instant star . He followed with the &quot; Desert Fury &quot; role , and then returned to the Hellinger fold for &quot; Brute Force , &quot; a prison epic that firmly established his stellar qualities and gave him , in the words of Daily Variety , &quot; added marquee stature. &quot; His next role , a true departure from the hard-guy characters he had played in the past , was as the upright son of a war profiteer in &quot; All My Sons , &quot; adapted from the Arthur Miller play . The year 1948 was a watershed ; in its final months , future Variety editor Thomas Pryor observed that Lancaster was &quot; at the top of the Hollywood heap . His name on a theater marquee is said to be worth at least $ 1 million. &quot; Hecht had promised that they would make their own films , and both men still wanted to do so , but their path seemed to be blocked by the studio system that still ruled the film world . So they decided to buck the system . Norma Productions ( named for the former Norma Anderson , who became Lancaster ' s wife in 1946 ) began production with a moody melodrama , &quot; Kiss the Blood Off My Hands. &quot; That was followed by a return to studio work with &quot; Sorry , Wrong Number , &quot; a screen version of the classic radio monologue . &quot; Rope of Sand &quot; and &quot; Criss Cross &quot; followed , and the next year the production company made a deal with Warner Bros . that allowed it to make three independent films for Warner release , while Lancaster made three others for the studio . That same year , Lancaster returned briefly to his original profession , joining Cole Bros . Circus for four weeks as an acrobat ( with what one magazine called a &quot; careful salary adjustment &quot; from the $ 3 plus meals he had been paid_for his first big-top job. ) The acrobatics set the tone for Lancaster ' s first independent production at Warner : &quot; The Flame and the Arrow &quot; paired him once again with his old partner Cravat for slightly tongue-in-cheek medieval derring-do . The critics were ecstatic . &quot; Not since Douglas Fairbanks ( Sr. ) was leaping from castle walls and vaulting over rooftops of ancient storybook towns , &quot; wrote New York Times critic Bosley Crowther , &quot; has the screen had such a reckless and acrobatic young_man to display these same inclinations. &quot; Exploitation of his athletic prowess opened a whole new facet of Lancaster ' s career ; he pursued it through &quot; Jim Thorpe -- All American , &quot; &quot; Ten Tall Men &quot; and &quot; The Crimson Pirate. &quot; Then it was back to the studio and to deep drama with a strong portrayal of the alcoholic Doc opposite Shirley Booth in &quot; Come Back Little Sheba , &quot; followed by &quot; His Majesty O ' Keefe &quot; for his own company . Outdoor epics such_as &quot; Apache , &quot; &quot; Vera Cruz &quot; and &quot; The Kentuckian &quot; ( Lancaster ' s first directing effort ) were balanced by dramatic_performances in &quot; The Rose Tattoo &quot; and &quot; Separate Tables &quot; and the co-production role in &quot; Marty. &quot; &quot; Trapeze , &quot; a foreign circus romp with Tony Curtis and Gina Lollobrigida , was followed by &quot; The Sweet Smell of Success , &quot; again opposite Curtis , in which Lancaster played an evil , power-mad , syndicated columnist -- thereby gaining the enduring enmity of Walter Winchell , who complained that it was a biting satire of him . Lancaster and his partners ( Norma Productions had been renamed Hecht-Hill-Lancaster when James Hill joined the company ) found themselves at the center of a storm of abuse from members of the news media responding to Winchell ' s invocation of the mid-1950s mood of anti-liberalism . Lancaster ' s reaction was a sharp increase in the amount of free_time he devoted to liberal causes of all kinds . Gradually the attacks ended . The 1969 breakup of his marriage ( after 23 years and five children ) left him depressed for a time , but work was an anodyne , as always . &quot; The Midnight Man &quot; ( which he co-wrote , co-produced and co-directed ) gave him a chance to stretch his professional muscles . &quot; The Cassandra Crossing , &quot; &quot; Twilight ' s Last Gleaming &quot; and &quot; The Island of Dr. Moreau &quot; were more standard offerings . But &quot; Go Tell the Spartans , &quot; with its anti-Vietnam War message , was Lancaster at his full-throttle best . He also made two excursions back to the stage . One ( the 1972 role as one-legged Peter Stuyvesant in the musical &quot; Knickerbocker Holiday &quot; ) was a success ; the other ( as an aging Huck Finn opposite Kirk Douglas ' Tom_Sawyer for &quot; The Boys in Autumn &quot; in 1981 ) was less so . The 1983 film &quot; Local Hero &quot; saw him reinterpreting the role of unprincipled tycoon that he had played in various forms before -- and playing it well . &quot; I have to play character roles now , &quot; he said in a 1977 interview . &quot; In fact , I mustn ' t play romantic ones unless it logically suits my real age. &quot; Yet it was a romantic role -- as the elderly chronic loser dreaming of a happy life with Susan Sarandon in &quot; Atlantic_City &quot; -- that won him the Los Angeles and New York film critics ' awards in 1981 and nearly brought his second performance Oscar . In recent years , Lancaster was lauded for work_on behalf of social causes . In 1984 , he received the Mental Health Award from the UC Irvine Department of Psychiatry for his work_on a series of videotapes about the problems of the long-term mentally_ill . In 1987 , he was honored as Man of the Year by Aid for AIDS after he posed for a poster captioned &quot; Think before you act . . . don ' t get AIDS. &quot; The poster was used as an educational tool in Los Angeles Unified School District classrooms . And he continued to work as often as possible . In 1988 he had lent his own life experience to &quot; Rocket Gibraltar &quot; as a grandfather who insists that his grandchildren give him a Viking funeral on a burning boat drifting to sea . The same year he traveled_to Italy and Yugoslavia to portray a cardinal in an Italian miniseries based on Alessandro Manzoni ' s novel &quot; I Promessi Sposi &quot; ( &quot; The Promised Bride. &quot; ) In September , 1990 , he married television production coordinator Susan Scherer , who was 48 . But the good roles by then were fewer and further between . &quot; Meanwhile , you ' re marking time , &quot; he told The Times ' Charles Champlin . &quot; You ' re like a fighter . No fights but you keep_in great shape . It was three years before ' Atlantic_City ' came_along , and ' Rocket Gibraltar ' was the best part since . Just so they keep coming along. &quot; Times staff writer Burt A . Folkart contributed to this story . * AN APPRECIATION : A fine actor , a fine man , and a link to a vanished era .
