   <HEADLINE> A DISSENTING VIEW ON CHINA , DISSIDENTS AND TRADE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I ' m a business person , and I resent &quot; Question of Conscience &quot; ( May 15 ) , which again tries to sell us the perception that on June 3 , 1989 , Chinese troops mounted a &quot; brutal assault on peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators in Tian An Men Square. &quot; If you check the videos made before June 3 , you can see students pulling unarmed soldiers off their trucks , beating them up and setting fire to their trucks as well as Chinese leaders trying to negotiate peacefully with student leaders , to no avail . It is also patently manipulative to imply that a letter sent by a California business group to Clinton that supports continued most-favored-nation status for China reflects a position whose outlook &quot; not all U.S. companies share , &quot; as if all companies are obliged to always share the same outlook on everything . Any time someone tries to sell me a &quot; nobody-never-always &quot; bill of goods , I know they ' re just trying to fiddle_with my brain , because in the real_world nothing involves everything or everybody , always . What our amateur social engineers in the media seem to overlook are three facts : * That the current Chinese leaders -- like it or not -- were the ones accountable for keeping the peace among the 1.2 billion people who did not behave in a socially irresponsible Chinese manner and , had 1 % social chaos spread throughout China , it could have caused 12 million Chinese to perish . * That when honorable folks want to meddle in other peoples ' lives , they have the guts to send along a blank_check for any damages that their meddling may cause others . * That we brought the Cold_War to an end , and in so doing put an end to the inconsequential political word_games of the last 40 years . China ' s leaders seem to have caught_on that the new game involves the practical_application of money , bottom_lines and access to markets . To the extent this is so , it is stupid to continue to interpret Chinese decisions as any more_than simply knowing how to play the new game well by leveraging China ' s massive market , no differently than any major market .
