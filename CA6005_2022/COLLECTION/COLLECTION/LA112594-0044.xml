   <HEADLINE> BIRDS OF A FEATHER ; RESTORING HISTORIC AIRCRAFT IS A LABOR OF LOVE FOR VOLUNTEERS AT GILLESPIE FIELD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> John Klein is &quot; the baby. &quot; He ' s 67 . The other members of the 11-man crew are a little older -- most of them veterans of military_service during World_War_II . What binds them together is a love_affair with airplanes , especially old airplanes . Klein , Joe Gwizdak , 70 , Art Dickman , 82 , and their companions gather regularly at an old hangar in a quiet corner of Gillespie Field to help patch donated aircraft back together for the San Diego Aerospace Museum , headquartered 12 miles away in San Diego ' s Balboa Park . &quot; It ' s a lot of fun , &quot; said Gwizdak , who served as a gunnery instructor on B-17 and B-25 bombers during World_War_II . &quot; Working on planes you ' ve heard about all your life , it ' s just great. &quot; The aircraft they ' re currently restoring are a mixed lot , ranging from an F-14 Tomcat jet fighter retired by the Navy earlier this year to a P-51 pursuit plane from World_War_II to a 1929 Kinner Bird biplane . Different members of the team have different specialties . Ira Corpening , once a B-17 pilot stationed in Italy , studied upholstering on the GI Bill after the war and now does much of the fabric work . Dickman is a skilled mechanic and woodworker . Dick Weixeldorfer , who formerly ran an auto repair_shop , does most of the painting . Gwizdak said the restoration team reports to the hangar Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays , often starting at 7 a.m. and working until supper time . &quot; I ' m always kind of chomping at the bit until I get_down here , &quot; he admitted with a grin . &quot; But if we came every day , the chores would n ' t get done and the wives would complain . Three days a week is just right . My wife can do her thing and I can do mine. &quot; The men , all retired , volunteer their time . &quot; A younger fellow -- he was about 35 -- came_down here awhile back , was interested in what we do , indicated that he ' d like to work with us , &quot; Gwizdak said . &quot; Then he asked how much he ' d be paid . I told him , ' Nothing. ' He said , ' You come_down here and do all this work for nothing ? You must be crazy. ' &quot; Gwizdak and Klein took some visitors on a tour of the Gillespie Field hangar earlier this month . They pointed_out some of the museum ' s jet-age aircraft -- the F-14 , an A-6E and an A-7 from the Navy , and a nose section salvaged from an Air_Force B-52 bomber -- but they devoted most of their time to the planes built before World_War_II . &quot; This one is a French-built Morane Saulier from the 1930s that was used in the movie ' The Blue Max , ' &quot; Gwizdak said , pointing to a small , fragile-looking silver plane with open cockpits . &quot; George Peppard , who starred in the film , owned it and flew it . It ' s one of the best aerobatic planes you can find. &quot; Klein showed the visitors a stripped metal frame that looked sort of like an elongated bird cage . &quot; This one here is an American_Eagle biplane , built_in 1929 , &quot; he said . &quot; It looked_like hell when we started . We ' re rebuilding the whole_thing . We don ' t have any plans for it , so as we took it apart , we took a lot of photographs . that ' s what we ' re working from. &quot; Klein said the American_Eagle should be flyable when the restoration work is completed , although he doubts that anyone will attempt it . &quot; It has a Curtis OX-5 engine in it , and they tend to quit on you , &quot; he said . &quot; That might be OK if you were out over the plains of Iowa , where you can land anywhere , but not around here. &quot; As Dickman checked the clamps holding some reglued wing ribs on the wood and fabric Kinner , Klein shot a disdainful glance at the P-51 -- a sleekly glamorous hot_rod from World_War_II that has become the darling of collectors and airplane racers . &quot; It ' s a toy now , not a war bird , &quot; he said with a snort . &quot; Before we got_it , somebody took the armor and fuselage fuel tank out , removed the gun ports on the wings and put a second seat in it . It ' s real pretty , but it ' s not the real_thing anymore. &quot; He told the visitors about one he worked_on a_few years back that was &quot; the real_thing &quot; -- a Spad 7 from World_War I . &quot; When we took it apart , we found a message that someone had written_on one of the wing ribs when they built it , &quot; he said . &quot; It said , ' Screw the Kaiser.
