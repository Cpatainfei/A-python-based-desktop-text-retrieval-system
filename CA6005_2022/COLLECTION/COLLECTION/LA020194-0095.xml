   <HEADLINE> MARKET SCENE ; CHILEANS SAVOR SWEET ADVANTAGE IN FRUIT INDUSTRY ; THE SOUTH_AMERICAN_NATION IS THE WORLD ' S LEADING EXPORTER OF WINTER FRUIT . MORE THAN 40 % GOES TO THE U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a busy summer day in a sun-splashed orchard , workers hurry to harvest a bumper crop of plump and blushing nectarines , spilling them from baskets into a trailer_parked between rows of trees . A tractor will take the nectarines to a nearby packing_plant , where they will cool_off in a huge refrigeration chamber . In a_few days , after sorting and packing , the fruit will be trucked to Valparaiso and loaded on refrigerated ships going_to the United States and other countries . &quot; Right now we ' re starting to send a lot of fruit to the United States , East Coast and West Coast , &quot; said Ricardo Vial , export manager for a group of farms here . As he strolled through an orchard , Vial listed some of the fruit he will be sending to California in the coming weeks : &quot; nectarines , peaches , plums , grapes -- a lot of them -- and pears. &quot; Chile is the world ' s leading exporter of &quot; winter fruit &quot; ( not counting citrus , bananas and other tropical fruit ) , harvested when trees are bare in most of the Northern_Hemisphere . Chilean fruit exports have grown_into almost a billion-dollar industry , helping to nourish this South_American_country ' s remarkable economic development in the past decade . Depressed prices for apples in Europe made 1993 a disappointing year for many Chilean fruit growers . But as this season ' s harvest goes_into high_gear , they are expecting a happier 1994 . Thirty years ago , Coltauco agriculture was mostly annual crops such_as corn and wheat , wine vineyards , and dairy herds and other livestock . Only a_few farmers were beginning to grow fruit for export . &quot; My grandfather Miguel started with nectarines around 1965 , &quot; Vial said . &quot; He exported to the United States. &quot; Now , like many rural_areas of central Chile , the township of Coltauco , 70 miles south of Santiago , relies_on fruit exports as a major source of livelihood . This is a patchwork_quilt of orchards and vineyards , dotted with refrigeration and packing_plants where workers process fruit with modern conveyor equipment , and where office personnel keep track of business with computers . According to the Chilean Exporters Assn. , the export of fruits and vegetables directly employs 4.4 % of the Chilean labor_force , or more_than 200 # 000 workers . While many of the jobs are low-skill , the export industry has increased opportunities for better-paid equipment operators , technicians and clerical workers . Chile accounts_for about 45 % of the Southern Hemisphere ' s exports of apples , pears , peaches and table grapes , up from 4 % in the early 1960s . From 1986 to 1991 alone , Chile ' s fresh fruit exports increased by 69 % , from 665 # 000 to 1.1 million metric_tons . More_than 40 % goes_to the United States . In 1981 , Chilean fruit exports brought_in less than $ 200 million . This year ' s revenues are expected to surpass the 1991 record of $ 991 million . Last year ' s revenues dropped to $ 862 million , mainly because of low apple prices in Europe . The problem started with a bumper crop of European apples , which can be stored into the winter season . Amid fears that the oversupply might prompt the European Community to impose a system of licensing apple imports , Chilean exporters rushed shipments to get their apples in before any quotas were set . The glut brought prices down rapidly . The European Community -- now called the European Union -- levied heavy compensatory import taxes on imported apples . With the added taxes , Chilean producers could not cover their costs . Uncounted acres of apples were left unpicked , and big growers lost millions of dollars . An additional problem that made things worse for Chile was its lack of quality_control . With no industrywide grading system to separate high- and low-quality fruit , mediocre Chilean apples pulled_down prices for the good ones . Legislation has been proposed to impose an industrywide system of grading for export fruit , but passage appears uncertain . Meanwhile , many growers and exporters have agreed to start a voluntary system of quality certification . &quot; As long as it isn ' t obligatory , it ' s going_to be hard to make quality_control effective , &quot; predicted Ramon Achurra , a Coltauco grower and exporter . Many Chilean growers worry that Chile ' s quality_control problem eventually could seriously erode this country ' s share of the winter fruit market as other Southern Hemisphere countries push to increase their shares . In South_America , Argentina is a major fruit exporter and Brazil has big potential for exporting winter fruits . South_Africa and New Zealand are also important Southern Hemisphere producers . Argentina already exports more pears than Chile and almost as_many apples . But Chile ' s overall fruit exports are more_than double Argentina ' s . South_Africa and New Zealand have been successful at developing new varieties of fruit that capture consumer perference . Smart Chilean growers have been able to follow_suit , planting the new varieties as their popularity increases . For example , new red apple varieties that are spreading in Chile include the Royal Gala , the Braeburn and the Fuji . Chileans also have ventured successfully into new species after spotting potential markets that they can supply . They planted some 27 # 000 acres of kiwi , winning a big share of the 1980s boom in that fruit , and more recently they have been investing heavily in berries for export . A new entry in the Chilean export cornucopia is the cherimoya , a delicious custard fruit of Andean origin that recently has been approved for marketing in the United States . Chile holds its biggest advantage in table grapes , nectarines and peaches , with more_than 80 % of the Southern Hemisphere ' s total exports . Table grapes are Chile ' s biggest export crop by far , and most go_to the United States . Of the 58.3 million boxes of Chilean fruit and vegetables sent to the United States during the season that ended last August , 16.3 million boxes went_to the West Coast , and all but 300 # 000 of those were unloaded at the Port of Los Angeles . The United States and Europe buy three-fourths of Chile ' s fruit exports . Exporters are trying to diversify the market , with notable success . Last year , sales to Latin_America doubled , accounting_for 14 % of total fruit exports . &quot; That has been a very pleasant surprise for us , &quot; said Ronald Bown Fernandez , president of the Chilean Exporters Assn . Growth in fruit exports to many countries has been slowed in recent years by international recession . But Bown predicted in an interview that economic recovery in the United States and other northern countries will stimulate the world ' s appetite for fruit . &quot; It ' s going_to be an excellent business for Chile , &quot; he said . Central Chile ' s Mediterranean climate , with rainy winters and sunny summers , give it natural advantages for fruit production . Low labor costs , relatively inexpensive land and a stable business climate favoring free_enterprise and international trade have encouraged investment in fruit since the 1970s , Bown said . Chile ' s fruit-growing area has expanded to nearly 400 # 000 acres from 116 # 000 acres in 1965 . Bown said he is not worried that the Northern_Hemisphere ' s winter fruit market could become saturated by increased exports from Chile and other Southern Hemisphere countries . He cited a trend of increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables in developed countries . The exporters association is contributing $ 30 # 000 this year to a U.S. publicity campaign encouraging consumers to eat_at least five portions of fruits and vegetables a day for a healthy diet . The &quot; five-a-day &quot; campaign , started in California in 1988 , is sponsored by the Produce for Better Health Foundation in cooperation with the National Cancer Institute . Bown said emphasis on healthier eating is expected to double per-capita fruit consumption in the United States within 10 years . And he said the movement is likely to spread to Europe . Chilean exporters are also interested in joining U.S. produce organizations in promotional projects aimed at increasing demand for different kinds of fruit . The Chilean Exporters Assn . recently signed a preliminary agreement with the California Kiwi_Fruit Commission for a campaign to promote &quot; kiwi_fruit of the Americas. &quot;</TEXT>
