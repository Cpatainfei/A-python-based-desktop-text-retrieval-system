   <HEADLINE> NEW TECHNOLOGY BRINGING GOVERNMENT , PEOPLE CLOSER ; INFORMATION : SOME OF THE PROJECTS ARE AIMED AT RESTORING FAITH IN THE AGENCIES -- AND THEY ' VE TURNED_OUT WELL . BUT OTHERS ARE COSTLY FAILURES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was shaping_up to be a typical summer afternoon for Tom Tate , sitting at his computer at the Department_of_Agriculture , until the message showed_up in his electronic mailbox . &quot; Help . I live_in Des Moines , Iowa , &quot; Tate recalls it said . &quot; The water from the floods is starting to spill_over and pollute our water_supply . What can we do ? &quot; Tate remembered that the government had produced flyers on water purification a year before for victims of Hurricane Andrew . He retrieved the text from the department ' s computer memory and transmitted it across the Internet network . A week later , another message arrived : &quot; You made me a local hero. &quot; Tate ' s correspondent , it turns_out , was no local bureaucrat in need of federal assistance . He was a teen-ager with a paper route and a home computer . With the aid of other carriers , he had taken Tate ' s flyers , printed up copies , slipped them into that day ' s newspapers and helped thousands of Iowans purify their tap_water . Tate never even learned the boy ' s name . The episode is only one of many examples that hint at another promising new application of technology : making the ocean of information generated by local , state and federal_governments more accessible to citizens . Against a backdrop of dissatisfaction with public institutions perceived as gridlocked and disconnected , technology is emerging as a focal_point in efforts to restore the public ' s damaged faith in government . After all_the rhetoric is stripped away , technology is at the center of the Clinton_Administration ' s &quot; reinventing government &quot; campaign and is the cornerstone of many current state and local reform projects . * In Louisiana , the government is experimenting with video telephones that let residents of rural communities be seen by doctors in the city . Patients in one place can stick their tongue out and say &quot; ahh &quot; while a physician peers down their throat from miles away . * In South Carolina , among other states , officials are developing electronic &quot; parent locater &quot; databases to help authorities track_down parents who fail to pay child_support . The networks integrate an array of personal records compiled from different states . * In Hawaii , citizens can use their home computers to obtain information about state jobs and college scholarships , to access university and public_libraries , and to retrieve texts of pending state legislation . * The federal_government has launched a computer service_called FedWorld that enables citizens to access information from more_than 130 government databases by dialing a single phone_number . The Government Printing Office generates 15 # 000 new titles a year ; after only 18 months , FedWorld has an inventory of 2.5 million documents and logs some 3 # 000 calls a day . Government ' s rush to embrace high_technology is not without peril . Some projects may prove ill-conceived or prohibitively expensive . California ' s effort to digitize its Department of Motor_Vehicles records , for example , has expanded from a five-year , $ 27-million project to a $ 44-million mess with no clear end in_sight . In addition , opening_up government databases to any citizen with a home computer and a modem raises difficult questions about potential violations of privacy . And even the most avid proponents of unfettered access acknowledge that offering_up gigabytes of government data accomplishes little if it is presented in a way that most people find unintelligible . &quot; People have this idea that if everybody had all_the information , then we would be a democratic society , &quot; said Prof . Amitai Etzioni of George_Washington University . &quot; But the really intriguing question is , what do people do with that information ? &quot; What is missing , Etzioni says , is some kind of &quot; democratic finger , &quot; a digital device that points_the_way to important information . Otherwise , he said , on-line government may produce little more_than widespread confusion and wasted expense . Nonetheless , much of the creative energy in government today is being directed at finding ways to use computers to streamline , modernize and humanize the government institutions many citizens seem to resent . The convergence of government and technology has received a big boost from Vice_President Al Gore , a dedicated Internet user who headed the Administration ' s &quot; reinventing government &quot; task_force . Many of that group ' s recommendations for making the federal_government more efficient involve new applications of technology . The movement has also benefited from the arrival of a generation of younger , technology-friendly policy activists who accompanied Clinton and Gore to Washington . When the National Governors ' Assn . recently surveyed state-level experiments with technology , it discovered a_few favored strategies : KIOSKS : Resembling automated teller machines used by bank customers , government kiosks are popping_up in shopping_malls and grocery_stores in several states . Before long , experts predict , citizens will conduct much of their routine business with government at these kiosks , renewing auto registrations , obtaining benefits and acquiring information about state services without ever confronting a bureaucrat . The objective is to bring government to the places where people generally congregate , rather than making them stand_in line at a handful of government_office buildings . California is among the first_states to experiment with kiosks . At more_than a dozen sites around the state , people can get copies of their birth_certificate , register their car and review job openings listed by the Employment Development Department . An even bigger trial , involving roughly 50 kiosks , is under way in Texas . In Vermont , citizens use kiosk terminals to learn about 2 # 400 health , education and social_services , and to obtain information about state colleges and training_schools . In New Jersey , kiosks dispense information about day-care providers . Colorado ' s kiosks answer queries about child_care , legal issues , business data and recreational_facilities . CARDS : Government-issued cards resembling credit_cards enable citizens to obtain state services more efficiently and to cut_down on fraud and abuse . Some cards store information about the holder in a magnetic stripe , while others are &quot; smart cards &quot; equipped with tiny computer chips . In Arkansas , Medicaid recipients present doctors and pharmacists with cards that contain information about their medical status and eligibility for benefits . By June , the state expects to have saved $ 7.6 million on an initial investment of $ 5 million . Wyoming is developing a system in which people eligible for the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women , Infants and Children will receive cards containing a silicon_chip that contains the bearer ' s full benefit record . Each time the card is used to obtain food or health products from designated retailers , the information stored in the chip is automatically adjusted to reflect the purchase . Other states , including Alabama , Idaho , Maryland , New Jersey and South Carolina , are developing their own magnetic and smart cards to deliver services . OTHER EFFORTS : California is developing a statewide environmental resource inventory to be used in planning roads and developments . It is trying to exploit technology to reduce redundant tax reporting requirements and is developing a statewide parent locater to improve collection of child-support payments . Some projects are tailored to particular regional needs . North_Dakota and the U.S. Agriculture_Department have linked 37 weather monitoring stations into a central computer_system available to any computer user with a modem . The system allows farmers and ranchers to obtain detailed local weather_forecasts as quickly as they are issued . About a quarter of the states , including California , are developing computer_systems to help people pay their taxes . Some simply dispense tax_forms electronically , while others allow taxpayers to file their returns and transfer funds by computer . A similar full-service system is being launched this year by the federal_government . In the past , taxpayers were required to make electronic filings through an intermediary , such_as a tax preparer , but now they can handle the chore themselves . The new FedWorld database , which was inaugurated during the George_Bush Administration , allows anyone with a computer to access the combined files of all federal libraries . Available records include all presidential speeches , pronouncements and press_releases . But so far , most users confine themselves to the Office of Personnel Management ' s job opportunities bulletin_board . With government_agencies going on-line at an increasing rate , politicians are not far behind . In California , gubernatorial candidates Pete Wilson and Kathleen Brown have made all_of their speeches and press_releases available to computer users so , as Brown puts it , &quot; people don ' t have to use snail mail. &quot; Congress is also experimenting with making itself more accessible . This month , it began posting the text of all House bills on the Internet , along with the official schedule of House action . A year ago , seven House members obtained individual electronic mailboxes on the Internet so constituents could contact them instantaneously . Only 14 months later , 36 House members are_on line , and the number increases by two or three lawmakers each week . So far , the more tradition-bound Senate has not created its own electronic gateway . But the digital stampede has not been trouble-free . Internet-connected House members , for instance , are not willing to answer citizen queries electronically . Responses are sent by conventional mail , as they were 200 years ago . The problem , is that anyone could &quot; spoof &quot; an e-mail messager by impersonating a member of Congress . That glitch won ' t be solved until &quot; digital signatures &quot; are created to authenticate the true author of a computer message . Another danger posed by government ' s initial forays_into technology involve the potential waste of taxpayer dollars . That is one reason that New York set_up a Center for Technology in Government at the State University at Albany . Its mandate is to build prototype systems to be tested in university settings . Once perfected , they will be used to create a full-blown statewide system . California already has made a_few costly mistakes . Its plan to computerize the state ' s 38 DMV databases went awry , according to Government Technology magazine , because the state was trying to develop new technology and lacked a clear business plan . The state ' s kiosk program , Info / California , was supposed to have 104 machines in_operation by now , so far only 15 are up and running . ( The only one in Los Angeles is at the Baldwin Hills / Crenshaw Plaza Business Revitalization Offices , 3650 Martin_Luther_King Blvd . Suite 246 ) . Texas , which copied California ' s kiosk plan , jumped ahead by renting rather than buying its machines . Some users find the anonymity of technology appealing , as Info / California project manager Harold Ferber learned when he approached a tattooed biker dressed in leather and chains who was looking_for a job at a kiosk in San Diego . Ferber said the biker told him he preferred using the machine because when he showed_up at state employment offices , the staff discriminated against him because of his looks . Some of the most interesting experiments have been ad_hoc . In the White_House Office of Media Affairs , aide Jock Gill has been assigned to think_about new technology . While attending a conference , he met Tate , the Agriculture_Department official , and the two began discussing the possibility of creating an on-line network composed of representatives of any branch of government interested in pooling information . Their first organizational meeting included representatives of three agencies : Agriculture , Commerce and Education , so they called their embryonic network ACE . Later , they gave the acronym an official name , Americans Communicating Electronically . &quot; There is a lot of government information laying around in people ' s brown folders or in file_cabinets that would be of great interest to citizen taxpayers , &quot; Tate said . &quot; But there are lots of barriers and constraints to getting_it out. &quot; The ACE group now has 350 affiliate locations across the country . Monthly meetings are open_to bureaucrats and citizens . In fact , the Iowa paper carrier who messaged Tate about the rising floodwaters located him through the ACE computer group . &quot; It ' s sort of a guerrilla effort , &quot; Tate said . &quot; Not really much like government at all. &quot; An Internet Phone_Book With a computer and a modem , you can message the White_House -- and many other government entities -- in a matter of seconds . The Internet , a giant web of computer_networks that makes this all possible , can be accessed through commerical on-line services . Some of the officials and agencies that can be reached : THE WHITE_HOUSE The options : Citizens can send President Clinton and Vice_President Al Gore electronic messages over the Internet , as well as retrieve White_House documents such_as speeches , executive orders and press_releases . ( So far , First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has not gone on-line. ) Clinton ' s Internet address : President.WhiteHouse.Gov Gore ' s Internet address : VicePresident.WhiteHouse.Gov To obtain White_House publications : Publications.WhiteHouse.Gov For information about available documents : FAQ.WhiteHouse.Gov Replies : Because it is easy to impersonate other people on-line , Clinton and Gore answer their e-mail by conventional mail , and the delay can be considerable . All electronic messages to the leaders are downloaded onto magnetic_disks by the Secret_Service and screened . Federal authorities have made at least one arrest based on a digital threat to the President . MEMBERS OF CONGRESS The options : A growing number of House members ( but no senators ) can be messaged over the Internet . Menu of individual addresses : Congress.HR.House.Gov. ( It takes about 10 minutes to get a menu. ) Replies : Sent by conventional mail . Only about 40 lawmakers are on-line so far , but more are joining each week . THE FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT The options : Computer users can access more_than 130 federal databases , including most government libraries in Washington , through a service_called FedWorld . The network can be entered through the Internet or with a direct telephone connection using a modem and telecommunications software . FedWorld ' s Internet address : FedWorld.Gov The direct line : ( 703 ) 321-8020 For assistance , call the FedWorld help line : ( 703 ) 487-4608 AMERICANS COMMUNICATING ELECTRONICALLY ( ACE ) The options : ACE is a group of federal bureaucrats who are trying to use technology to make the government more accessible . The ACE bulletin_board is open_to anyone . ACE ' s Internet address : ACE-MG.ESUSDA.Gov</TEXT>
