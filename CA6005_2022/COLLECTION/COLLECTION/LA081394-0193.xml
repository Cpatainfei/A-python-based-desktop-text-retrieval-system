   <HEADLINE> U.S. , NORTH_KOREA REACH NUCLEAR PACT ; FOREIGN_POLICY : PYONGYANG PLEDGES NOT TO PURSUE ARMS PROGRAM ; WASHINGTON AGREES TO HELP UPDATE REACTORS . BOTH MOVE TO FORM DIPLOMATIC TIES , BUT MORE TALKS ARE NEEDED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> North_Korea pledged early today to stop trying to obtain nuclear_weapons , an agreement that apparently defuses the most dangerous foreign_policy crisis facing the Clinton_Administration and its allies in Asia . In exchange , the United States agreed to help North_Korea modernize its nuclear_power facilities , the parties said in a joint statement issued in Geneva . The two nations also agreed in principle to establish diplomatic_missions in each other ' s capitals for the first time since the internationally isolated , Communist-ruled state was established after World_War_II . The agreement , announced at the end of talks that lasted well past midnight , provided a welcome victory for President Clinton one day after he suffered stunning defeats in Congress on crime and health_care legislation . Some details of the accord , however , were left to later negotiations , scheduled to begin Sept . 23 in Geneva . &quot; This is extremely important because it ' s one of those foreign_policy achievements that takes a lot of work and effort and , in the context of this kind of changing world , is very significant , particularly when you are dealing with a country like North_Korea , &quot; White_House Chief_of_Staff Leon E . Panetta said in a telephone_interview . &quot; I think this is a real breakthrough. &quot; The protracted dispute with North_Korea had been cited by critics of the White_House as further evidence of disarray in the Administration ' s foreign_policy . &quot; I don ' t think the crisis is over . But it ( the agreement ) certainly represents a significant step_in trying to improve relations , &quot; Panetta said . South_Korea ' s Foreign Ministry today hailed the Geneva statement as a move toward &quot; final resolution of the North_Korean nuclear problem. &quot; &quot; It is definitely progress , &quot; said William Clark , a State_Department expert on Asia during the George_Bush Administration and now a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . &quot; It was never going_to be a quick_fix with the North . . . . What they have done here is put the U.S. offer on the table. &quot; According to news_agency reports from Geneva , North_Korea pledged to implement the joint declaration with South_Korea on making the Korean_peninsula free_of nuclear_weapons . The Pyongyang government also promised to remain a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , an international accord designed to stem the spread of nuclear arms . Clark said that , if North_Korea keeps its word , those steps would end its nuclear_weapons program . The North-South pact bans both nuclear arms and the fuel-reprocessing facilities that produce weapons-grade plutonium . Under the non-proliferation treaty , North_Korea ' s nuclear_power plants would be subject_to international inspection . But North_Korea did not agree to unlimited inspections . In return , Washington said it will give Pyongyang &quot; assurances against the threat or use of nuclear_weapons by the United States. &quot; America also agreed to help North_Korea modernize its electricity-generating facilities with light-water nuclear_reactors . Such reactors are far more efficient than the graphite-moderated equipment that North_Korea now uses . Light-water reactors also produce far less plutonium . Assistant Secretary_of_State Robert L . Gallucci , chief delegate to the Geneva talks that began Aug . 5 , said he is confident the United States can get_together an international consortium to provide the necessary technology and funding for the new technology . The reactor modernization program , however , will take at least a decade to complete , so North_Korea will continue to use its existing facilities well into the next century . The joint statement said that more negotiations will be required to determine the disposition of about 8 # 000 spent nuclear fuel rods now corroding in a cooling pond north of Pyongyang . The latest crisis was touched_off in May when North_Korea removed the rods from its Yongbyon nuclear plant in defiance of International Atomic Energy Agency regulations . The rods contain enough plutonium for several nuclear_weapons . The United States wants to ship them to a third country , but North_Korea has not agreed to that step . North_Korea said it will take measures to stabilize the rods to delay the risk of them giving_off radiation and agreed to permit international inspectors to supervise the work . Pyongyang previously had argued that it must begin reprocessing the rods by the end of August or they would start to give_off harmful radiation . The two countries agreed in principle to establish liaison offices in Pyongyang and Washington to provide representation , a step that stops short of full diplomatic relations . But their statement said that further negotiations will be required to work_out the details . Presumably , the liaison office agreement was included as a gesture to Kim Jong Il , North_Korea ' s new leader . It gives Kim -- who took_over after the death last month of his father , Kim Il Sung -- a measure of international legitimacy that the elder Kim never achieved during almost half a century of power . The statement also said the two nations will &quot; reduce barriers to trade and investment as a move toward full normalization of political and economic relations &quot; -- measures that would ease North_Korea ' s isolation .
