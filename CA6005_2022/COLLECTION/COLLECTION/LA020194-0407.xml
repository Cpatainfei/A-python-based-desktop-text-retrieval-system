   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; THOSE WHO WAIT FOR FOOD_STAMPS FIND LONG LINES BUT LESS CHAOS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Because of the food_stamp cheats , Barbara Brown could not replace the baby food she lost during the earthquake , could not pay her rent and had to wait all morning Monday in a half-mile-long line -- for the third time in a week . Last week , thousands of people who suffered losses in the quake were granted emergency food vouchers the day they applied . But because of suspicions that many of the applications were fraudulent , a 72-hour waiting period was instituted to give county workers time to verify claims . &quot; Now , because of the rip-off artists , people like me have to suffer , &quot; said Brown , a mother of two , as she waited in_line at a Dodger Stadium parking_lot . &quot; If they had checked people out right from the beginning , instead of waiting , we would have had our food by now. &quot; County officials say they are now vigorously pursuing food_stamp cheats , and one suspect was arraigned Monday in federal_court . Four others are scheduled to be arraigned today . More_than 3 # 000 people waited in_line Monday at Dodger Stadium , one of four large processing centers county officials opened in the hopes of avoiding the mass confusion of last week . There were extremely long lines last week at the 29 county welfare offices , and numerous tales of abuse surfaced as about 50 # 000 people applied for the emergency food vouchers . This week , county officials tried to rectify the situation by establishing centralized application centers and steering applicants away from some of the overburdened county welfare offices . And by verifying claims , officials hoped to keep the cheats away . Although people still waited in long lines Monday at Dodger Stadium and other sites , the processing program had fewer hitches than last week . The lines at the large centers moved quicker , there were more employees to handle the paperwork , and there was a large police presence to keep order . But there are still glitches that need to be addressed , said Lew Hollman , an attorney for San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services . The elderly and disabled are forced to wait in long lines in the hot sun , and the county has made no special provisions for them . And , he said , none of those who filled_out the food_stamp forms were given any paperwork to verify that they had applied . &quot; This could lead to major problems , &quot; Hollman said . &quot; If 1 # 000 applications are lost , what happens to those people ? Does that mean they ' ve lost the chance to obtain any food_stamps ? &quot; Many people in_line Monday were frustrated because they had waited in_line last week , they were waiting again this week and , after filling_out their applications , must wait three more days for their vouchers . Within 72 hours of making a claim , applicants will be notified by mail that they can pick_up their vouchers , which are provided through a U.S. Department_of_Agriculture program that is being managed by Los Angeles County . Outside a Panorama City welfare office , more_than 1 # 500 earthquake victims -- many without food or a place to sleep -- applied for food_stamps . County employees used bullhorns to notify the crowd in Spanish , English and Armenian that there is now a waiting period . Most of the people in_line thought the waiting period would only hurt those who were in need . The scammers , they said , had gotten their food_stamps last week . &quot; Everyone who was doing wrong got what they wanted , and now the ones who are honest and really need it have to wait for three days , &quot; said Lydia Sanchez of North Hollywood . Sanchez waited in_line last Tuesday with her four children without obtaining any vouchers . She and her children are living_on food donated by local churches . Maurice Carter , who applied for food_stamps for the first time on Monday , is living_in a friend ' s motor_home . His Van Nuys apartment was condemned after the earthquake and he lost his job as a customer service worker when his work site was heavily damaged . He blamed government officials for failing to prevent the fraud last week . &quot; Isn ' t that what computers are for ? &quot; Carter said . &quot; It seems to me that the government ought to be able to check people pretty quickly. &quot; * Officials are now taking a number of precautions to prevent fraud . Every application will be cross-checked by the county ' s central computer_system , said Mike Collins , a division chief for the county Department of Public Social_Services . If people try to apply for the emergency food vouchers a second time or if they claim more dependents than the last time they applied for county benefits , their cases will be referred to fraud investigators . Barbara Brown waited four hours last week outside a Los Angeles welfare office until she finally gave_up because the line was moving so slowly . She returned the next day at 5:30 a.m. and waited another few hours . When Brown finally met with a county worker , she was given an appointment to return Monday . But when she arrived_at the welfare office , she was told to line_up at Dodger Stadium . &quot; I ' ve had to spend all my money replacing food I lost during the earthquake and feeding my kids , &quot; Brown said . &quot; I know some_other people in that line last week didn ' t lose a damn thing . They just heard there was free money at the welfare office , so they just lined_up with their hands_out . Now the rest of us have to pay the price. &quot;</TEXT>
