   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY_COLLEGE REGIONAL BASEBALL PLAYOFFS ; CYPRESS ' FRANCE SHUTS OUT SOUTHWESTERN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pitching has been the story of the playoffs for Cypress . Aaron France pitched a three-hit shutout Saturday as host Cypress beat Southwestern , 9-0 , in a Southern California playoff baseball_game . France ' s shutout was the second in a row for Cypress , which has not allowed a run in 22 innings . Josh Belovsky pitched a two-hitter Friday in a 4-0 victory over Chaffey in the first round . &quot; I don ' t know if the pitching is better or the hitting is worse ( this season ) , &quot; Cypress Coach Scott Pickler said . &quot; I just know that our pitching has never been this good. &quot; Cypress ( 38-10 ) plays Cuesta at 11 a.m. today at Cypress for a berth in next weekend ' s State tournament at Cerritos . Cuesta defeated Southwestern , 12-5 , Saturday . The Chargers would have to lose twice not to advance . Matt Hendren ( 9-2 ) will start today for Cypress , which has won 12 consecutive games . France ( 12-3 ) tied Cypress ' single-season mark for victories . He won the 17th of his career , also tying a school record . France , a sophomore right-hander , didn ' t give_up a hit for six innings but lost his no-hit bid when David Sanchez lined a single to left-center to start the seventh . France finished with nine strikeouts , including the side in the ninth . &quot; His curveball was outstanding today , &quot; catcher David Trentine said . &quot; He had everything working. &quot; Because the Chargers didn ' t blow the game open until they scored eight runs in the seventh inning , it was key that France dominated batters early . &quot; I was aware of the no-hitter , &quot; France said . &quot; It made me sharper . I knew I had to go_after the hitters. &quot; Trentine had an RBI single in the first inning to give Cypress a 1-0 lead . That held_up until Jason Hodges walked with the bases loaded to drive_in the first run of the seventh . The next run scored on a balk , and three more came_home when Trentine doubled into the right-field corner . &quot; He threw me a curveball that kind of hung , &quot; Trentine said . Eric Stevens had an RBI single , and Dominick Ruggiero had an RBI groundout , and the final run scored on an error .</TEXT>
