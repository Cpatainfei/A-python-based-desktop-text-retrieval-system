   <HEADLINE> PLOT ALLEGED IN RUSSIAN CORRUPTION SCANDAL ; LAWSUIT : DEFENSE MINISTER SUES NEWSPAPER AFTER ARTICLES CALL HIM A THIEF . CONTROVERSY ALSO INVOLVES REPORTER ' S MURDER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With his officer ' s honor besmirched in a ferocious scandal involving murder and Mercedes sedans , Russia ' s defense minister warned Friday of a &quot; monstrous political provocation &quot; meant to force him to resign and sow confusion in the Kremlin . &quot; The backstage conductors of this persecution are trying to cause a crisis of power , &quot; Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev declared in an official statement . &quot; Playing the ' army card ' time after time , they are pushing society to the dangerous edge of complete chaos and disorder. &quot; Grachev , a normally mild-mannered former paratroop leader who has kept the Russian army relatively calm as it suffered through massive post-Cold War cuts , was trying to fend_off a rash of accusations that he and some of his top brass are corrupt . He brought suit Friday against the Moskovsky Komsomolets daily , which had published a full-page story the day before using Grachev ' s nickname , &quot; Pasha Mercedes , &quot; a reference_to the Mercedes-Benz sedans that he allegedly obtained through the retreating Russian forces in Germany . &quot; A thief should be in prison and not be defense minister , &quot; the headline read . Moskovsky Komsomolets , always sensational , abandoned all caution in the wake of the murder Wednesday of its investigative reporter , Dmitri Kholodov . Kholodov , who specialized in uncovering corruption in the military , was killed in his office when a briefcase that was supposed to have contained incriminating documents on the Russian contingent in Germany blew_up as he opened it . The daily newspaper published documents on two $ 100 # 000 Mercedes-Benz automobiles that it alleged had been bought for Grachev ' s personal use out of funds meant for the resettlement of Russian officers returning from Germany . It also referred to the plentiful supplies of Russian guns , uniforms and ammunition available in Germany that could only have become available for_sale through corrupt officers . Kholodov had been working_on proving that Russian weaponry had been sold under the table . The next day , Moskovsky Komsomolets went even further , accusing the head of the Western Group of Forces , Gen . Matvei Burlakov , of &quot; knowing arithmetic -- how to extract money from the budget , fold it in his pocket , share it with his bosses and multiply stars &quot; on his uniform . Grachev said he had asked Russia ' s chief prosecutor to bring criminal charges against &quot; the slanderers &quot; and accused the newspaper of waging an anti-military campaign . &quot; I have said it before and repeat it again : We , the military , want only one thing -- stability and civic consensus in society , &quot; his statement said . Libel and slander suits have become ever more popular weapons in Russia ' s political battles . Last month , ultranationalist lawmaker Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky won a libel suit against Yegor T . Gaidar , the architect of Yeltsin ' s free-market economic reforms . And a leader of the Old_Guard Parliament won a libel case against President Boris N . Yeltsin , who described him as a fascist in a recent book . The Mercedes-Benz scandal dealt a heavy blow to the prestige of the army , which remains one of the most trusted institutions in Russian society , despite its decline since its Soviet heyday . Adding_to concern about the scandal ' s repercussions was a poll in Friday ' s Izvestia newspaper depicting a longstanding volatile mood among Russian officers . The joint Russian-German survey of 615 of the army ' s elite officers found that 50 % of generals believed a shift to &quot; some kind of dictatorship &quot; was inevitable . Sporadic scares about an impending military coup have largely ceased here , but the level of military discontent remains high . More_than 50 % of the officers interviewed said they had no confidence in Grachev , Izvestia said . Calls_for Grachev ' s resignation also came from Russian liberals . One of Yeltsin ' s main backers , the party known as Russia ' s Democratic Choice , issued a statement saying the military leadership had compromised itself and proven incapable of reform . Grachev left Moscow on Thursday on a trip to the Russian Far East , but he is expected to face the political firing_line next week : He has been summoned to the Duma , the lower house of Parliament , to discuss the state of the army . In other Russian political news Friday , Yeltsin announced that a summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States had failed to bring agreement on creating a body that would bind the former Soviet republics more closely together . Kazakhstan ' s President Nursultan Nazarbayev had proposed the creation of a Eurasian Union -- along the lines of the European Union -- but seven decades of forced Soviet togetherness apparently left the former republics too skittish to accept such a grouping .</TEXT>
