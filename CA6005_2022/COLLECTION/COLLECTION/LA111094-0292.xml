   <TEXT> WHO KNEW ? -- The magnitude of the Republican sweep Tuesday took a lot of people by surprise . Were pre-election polls wrong ? Actually , no . But media reporting about the results did pull punches . Most polls found that Republicans were poised to take a majority of the congressional vote for the first time since the Dwight D . Eisenhower Administration -- and stories on those polls generally noted that such a finding could well_point to a GOP majority in Congress . The final Los Angeles Times Poll , for example , indicated that the GOP was ahead on the total congressional vote by a 5-point margin -- about a point higher than the actual vote Tuesday . But journalists , haunted by memories of the famous Chicago Tribune headline , &quot; Dewey Defeats Truman , &quot; hedged their predictions . &quot; You ' re always reluctant to predict something you ' ve never seen happen , &quot; said Andrew Kohut , director of the Times Mirror Center for People and the Press . &quot; And none of us have ever seen this happen. &quot; * BAILING_OUT -- While Washington reeled from the Republican sweep , at least one ousted Democrat was seeing fairly clearly Wednesday . Oklahoma Rep . Mike Synar , who has had seven weeks to adjust his thinking since losing in a Democratic primary , says he believes a lot of Democratic lions in the House will retire rather than be members of that congressional lesser class -- the minority party . That will open still more seats to possible Republican gains . Synar also suggested that a number of old-line Republicans will be less than blissful under what is expected to be a tightly disciplined operation run_by new House leaders Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Dick Armey of Texas . Stay tuned . * CONVENTION DILEMMA -- With their midterm election victory under their belts , Republicans are looking_forward to nominating their next presidential standard-bearer in two years -- and San Diego appears to have strong support as the convention site . But insiders said that it ' s not a done deal . Party officials think San Diego would be an aesthetically stunning setting and they are high on the symbolism of meeting in the state with the most electoral votes . But some worry that the Convention Center is not large enough for all_the delegates and press and question whether the city has enough hotel_rooms nearby . If these problems prove insurmountable , the GOP probably will stage the August , 1996 , convention in New Orleans , with its spacious Superdome , abundant hotels and memories of the 1988 convention that anointed the winning ticket of George_Bush and Dan Quayle . * INDEPENDENT DECLARATION ? -- Growing public alienation from the Democratic and Republican_parties , combined with the showing by Texas billionaire Ross Perot in the 1992 presidential race , may give_rise to third-party candidacies in 1996 . Among the possible candidates is Lowell P . Weicker Jr. , a former Republican senator who was elected Connecticut governor four years ago as the head of a third_party . Weicker is beginning to put_together an independent bid , according to a Connecticut politico who has spoken_to Weicker . Although Weicker has said that he looks_forward to life as a private citizen , he predicted recently that a building momentum will lead to &quot; a true centrist third party. &quot; * GERONIMO ! -- The first thing one dispirited White_House aide did Wednesday morning after surveying the Democratic electoral rubble was to change the screen_saver on the personal_computer on her desk . Where Opus the cartoon penguin once romped , a man bungee-jumped through the bottom of the screen .</TEXT>
