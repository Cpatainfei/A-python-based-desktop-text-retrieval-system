   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; SINGAPORE : WHAT PRICE JUSTICE ? ; A CONVICTED VANDAL ' S FLOGGING SENTENCE HAS BEEN LAUDED BY SOME CRIME-WEARY AMERICANS . OTHERS SAY THE NATION ' S IMPRESSIVE SAFETY RECORD IS NOT WORTH THE LOSS IN CIVIL RIGHTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Singapore is one of the safest countries in the world , &quot; wrote Keith Kimball of Vallejo , Calif. , in a letter to Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher . &quot; We should have those tough kinds of punishment in America. &quot; A Singapore court ' s decision to sentence an American teen-ager to a flogging for spray-painting cars has produced a predictable nod of approval from many Singaporeans , long accustomed to their government ' s firm hand . Perhaps more surprising is the wave of support that has emerged for its harsh legal_system from Americans -- reinforcing opinion polls in the United States that show worry about crime now equals concern about the economy . In Singapore and the United States , newspapers have been inundated by letters supporting the sentence handed_down last month against Michael Fay , an 18-year-old student . Americans weary of crime increasingly favor stiffer penalties for criminals , such_as the &quot; three strikes &quot; rule recently adopted to punish repeat offenders in California . According to one survey , 68 % favor treating juvenile cases as severely as those involving adults . In elevating Singapore ' s administration of justice to overnight celebrity , the Fay case seems to have prompted many Americans to ponder two fundamental questions : Could the tough approach in Singapore , which places order before law , serve as a model elsewhere ? And what is the cost of its impressive crime statistics in terms of individual freedom ? Fay was sentenced to six strokes of the cane administered by a jailer trained in martial_arts , four months in prison and a $ 2 # 230 fine after pleading guilty to two counts of vandalism , two counts of criminal mischief and one count of possessing stolen property . His appeal of the caning sentence was thrown_out by the country ' s chief_justice Thursday , and he was taken into custody . Starting in the 1960s , when Singapore gained independence from Britain , the government imposed increasingly harsh penalties for a range of crimes , culminating in the last five years in laws against such offenses as armed robbery and drug trafficking , which carry a mandatory death_penalty . Singapore has also jettisoned some traditional safeguards , such_as jury trials , on grounds that guilty criminals were manipulating the system to walk free . Visitors are invariably impressed by the country ' s lack of graffiti and general feeling of safety . Women confidently stroll the streets late at night , the subway is clean , and muggings are rare . Gang warfare , a significant scourge in the 1950s , has been stamped_out . An opinion poll conducted for the government last year found that 82 % of respondents believe that their country is &quot; safe and secure. &quot; Statistics comparing the small city-state of Singapore and Los Angeles , with its roughly equal population , provide a dramatic contrast . In 1993 , 58 murders , 80 rapes , 1 # 008 robberies and 3 # 162 car thefts were reported in Singapore . Los Angeles Police_Department statistics for the same period show 1 # 100 homicides , 1 # 855 rapes , 39 # 227 robberies and 65 # 541 car thefts . Last year , Singapore had three robberies that involved guns . It has had no kidnapings for the last three years . The crime statistics have barely changed in five years . &quot; I have two kids , and I don ' t have to worry about their safety , &quot; said Davinder Singh , a lawyer and member_of_Parliament from the ruling People ' s Action Party . &quot; I don ' t have to worry about them being exposed to drugs or alcohol . For me this is very important. &quot; There are fewer than 3 # 757 full-time police_officers in the country , and they are rarely visible on the street despite the nation ' s reputation as an authoritarian society . All guns are outlawed , except those belonging_to the police and armed forces . Gun possession carries a stiff prison_term , and those who fire a gun during a crime face a mandatory death sentence . Another difference with the United States is the makeup of the society itself : 77 % ethnic Chinese and 14 % conservative Muslim Malays living_in relative isolation on a small island . There is virtually no poverty -- 80 % of the people own their homes -- and the family remains the backbone of society , with few divorces and children living at_home until marriage . As in many Asian societies , public shame , for the criminal and for his family , is a potent deterrent . A more telling comparison might be drawn between Singapore and Hong Kong , whose residents are also Chinese but which imposes neither the death_penalty nor caning . With a population nearly double that of Singapore , Hong Kong last year recorded 86 homicides , 103 rapes and 22 armed_robberies involving firearms . Nonviolent crimes such_as burglary were much more common than in Singapore , however . The philosophical underpinnings of Singapore ' s tough approach were laid_out by former Prime_Minister Lee Kuan Yew , who was trained in the law at Britain ' s prestigious Cambridge_University . Lee remarked 30 years ago that &quot; hard realities &quot; meant that the phrase &quot; law and order &quot; had to be turned_around so that order took precedence over the law . &quot; When a state of increasing disorder and defiance of authority cannot be checked by the rules then existing , &quot; Lee said , &quot; new and sometimes drastic rules have to be forged to maintain order : so that the law can continue to govern human relations . The alternative is to surrender order to chaos and anarchy. &quot; When Lee complained that justice was being thwarted on &quot; pure technicalities , &quot; the government in 1969 abolished the jury_system . All defendants now have their fate determined by a single judge . Singapore imposes the death_penalty for 20 offenses . It is mandatory in murder_convictions , firearms offenses and drug trafficking . Anyone found in possession of at least half an ounce of heroin or an ounce of cocaine is presumed under the law to be a trafficker and faces execution upon conviction . According to the Ministry of Home Affairs , between 1989 and 1993 the government hanged 47 convicts , of whom 22 were drug_traffickers ; 103 others are awaiting execution . Singapore has long had a variant of the &quot; three strikes &quot; rule . When a criminal with three convictions is found guilty of a new offense , the judge must impose &quot; preventive detention &quot; of seven to 20 years . Caning , the term for flogging done with a moistened , four-foot rattan_cane , is imposed for rape , robbery and extortion , and for such nonviolent crimes as vandalism and employing illegal immigrants . People who are caned frequently go_into shock and lose copious amounts of blood . Responding to charges that Fay was singled_out because he is American , the government said that 14 youthful vandals have been caned in the last five years and that foreigners receive equal treatment under the law . But a police spokesman revealed that there were 1 # 416 acts of vandalism reported in 1992 alone . Only 45 people were punished . According to Singapore officials , sentences are intended not just as punishment but as a deterrent . A woman with a history of petty crime who was convicted in 1993 of shoplifting a $ 4 box of sanitary pads was sentenced to five months in jail and a $ 2 # 666 fine . She was so overcome by the severity of the sentence that she beat her head to a bloody pulp on the courtroom furniture . When an 18-year-old man who is &quot; educationally subnormal &quot; repeatedly kissed a woman in an elevator , he was charged with molestation . A court sentenced him to six months in prison . When the man ' s lawyer appealed , Chief_Justice Yong Pung How , saying &quot; sentences have been too light ; they are not having a deterrent effect , &quot; increased the punishment to include three whacks of the rattan_cane . According to judicial records , judges increased sentences in 19 of 170 appeals filed_in the first_half of last year . This practice , not permitted in the United States , has prompted criminal lawyers here to joke that they threaten their clients with an appeal if they do not pay legal_fees promptly . Khoo Boon Hui , a senior assistant commissioner of Singapore ' s police_department , said in an interview that the country ' s death_penalty has been an undisputed success in reducing violent crime . Armed robberies , which he said had proliferated to more_than 150 a year in the 1970s , have been reduced to almost zero since the death_penalty was adopted . Kidnapings have also been eliminated by the threat of execution , he said . &quot; The death_penalty as a deterrent works when ( the crime ) involves planning , &quot; Khoo said . &quot; We want a person to not even contemplate a crime like kidnaping. &quot; But David Marshall , an attorney who was Singapore ' s first elected chief minister under British rule , disagreed . &quot; I see every year an increase in the number of death sentences imposed , which suggests that it is not acting_as a deterrent , &quot; he said . Marshall said there is almost universal approval in Singapore for the way justice is administered , even among opponents of the government . Indeed , there are few people willing to publicly criticize the government ' s approach . Walter Woon , a law professor at Singapore ' s National University , said he objects to the imposition of mandatory death sentences -- though not to the penalty itself , especially after being mugged by a gunman while visiting Disney World in Florida . &quot; I ' m in favor of giving discretion to judges to tailor sentences to fit the crime , &quot; Woon said . He also expressed concern that as mandatory death sentences were used in an increasing number of crimes , criminals might be more likely to kill their victims . Questions about the deterrent value of harsh sentences arise most often in narcotics . Not only are drug_traffickers hanged , but the police can search for drugs without a warrant and can compel anyone suspected of drug use to take a urine test . If the test is positive , the user is forced to undergo &quot; cold turkey &quot; withdrawal and spend three months to three years in a drug rehabilitation center . As a result , there is no place in Singapore where young people can be seen loitering on the street waiting to sell drugs , as happens in many U.S. cities . But despite such stringent rules , Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng admitted in Parliament last month that the number of hard-core addicts had risen from 2 # 228 in 1990 to 2 # 992 in 1993 . He said the government is considering imposing jail terms and caning to deter drug_users . One area where Singapore has been remarkably successful is with gangs . Singapore is the only Chinese community in the world where underworld societies commonly known as triads do not exist . Arguing that gangs intimidate witnesses against testifying in open court , Singapore wields Draconian detention laws against secret_societies . Police can detain people suspected of gang or serious drug crimes without trial or formal charges . The detention decision must be approved by an independent panel , though the accused is not allowed to present a defense . According to the Home Affairs Ministry , 277 members of secret_societies are under detention without trial , as well as 409 drug_traffickers and 39 people accused of other serious crimes . The detentions are for a renewable one-year period ; one man has spent 13 years and 9 months in detention for gang activity . &quot; The bottom_line , &quot; said Lim Soo Ping , a deputy secretary in the Home Affairs Ministry , &quot; is : Do you want these people on the streets or in the slammer ? I want them in the slammer. &quot; As the detention law illustrates , Singapore ' s attitude toward constitutional protection against abuse of state power is different from the West ' s . As former minister Marshall noted in an interview : &quot; There isn ' t the same respect for the individual in Chinese philosophy as there is in the Judeo-Christian philosophy of the West. &quot; In addition to abolishing jury trials , courts have ruled that accused people have no right to silence when being questioned by police , and a suspect who does not testify in his own defense at trial is warned by the judge that he will draw &quot; inferences &quot; from the failure to speak . The courts have ruled that the right to legal counsel begins only after the police complete their investigation , which can take days . The right to counsel is also limited to those who can afford a lawyer , as the state does not provide lawyers to the poor . &quot; The whole emphasis has changed , &quot; said J.B. Jeyeratnem , a defense_lawyer who is one of the few critics of the government in Singapore who is willing to be quoted by name . &quot; There is a gradual erosion of the great principle that no one is to be presumed guilty until he is found guilty. &quot; A group representing the Assn . of the Bar of the City of New York published a study of Singapore ' s justice system in 1991 , saying that despite the trappings of the_British justice system left from colonial days , &quot; the rule_of_law in Singapore today has given_way to empty legalism. &quot; &quot; In the_British tradition , the Singapore government scrupulously applies the law on the books , &quot; the report said . &quot; But that law no longer restrains government actions or protects individual rights. &quot; Beatrice Frank , a law professor at New York University who was one of the authors of the report , said that because of restrictions on the legal_profession and the judiciary , it is doubtful that an accused person can get a fair hearing . Another controversial aspect of Singapore ' s justice system is the extent to which coercion is used to extract confessions . Trials are relatively rare , with most accused people entering a guilty plea in hopes of winning a reduced sentence . The government vehemently denies that coercion exists . Fay and two others accused in the vandalism case said they were slapped and threatened into making confessions , but police officials insisted that an independent investigation had found no abuse . A civil case now being heard for malicious prosecution alleges that a police inspector held three men in prison for three years on a murder_charge after one defendant was denied food , water and sleep for 24 hours and forced to stand on a chair and hold three telephone_books at arm ' s length until he confessed . The police later admitted that they were holding the wrong men . A 1993 U.S._government report on human_rights in Singapore said &quot; there have been credible reports of police mistreatment. &quot; The government said such cases are rare , and errant officers are dealt with harshly . &quot; For the system to work , &quot; Khoo said , &quot; the public must have confidence in the police. &quot;</TEXT>
