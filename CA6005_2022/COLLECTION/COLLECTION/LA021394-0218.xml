   <TEXT> 1 . MURDER ? -- When the New Mexico State Police finally found Leroy Jackson , his 5-foot , 8-inch frame was scrunched onto the narrow , 3 1 / 2-foot-long jump_seat in the back of his white Dodge utility van . A blanket covered his entire body , even his face . Blood that had seeped from his nose stained the pillow under his head and the seat beneath it . But for his shoes , he was fully dressed , wearing gray pants and a gray sweat shirt from a 10-K race he had recently run . His body was disfigured from days of decomposition . Jackson , a Navajo environmental activist who made his living trading in Indian rugs and jewelry , was last seen alive in Taos on Friday , Oct . 1 , at dusk . The next day he was supposed to meet his wife , Adella Begaye , at a fair in Shiprock , about three hours away , but he never arrived . Jackson often spent days on_the_road , so Begaye tried not to panic . But on Tuesday , Oct . 5 , Jackson missed a long-scheduled flight to Washington , D.C , where he was to protest a recent attempt by local Bureau of Indian Affairs officials to exempt the Navajo reservation from an impending federal decision to list the Mexican spotted owl as an endangered species . The owl was going_to be Jackson ' s trump . With it he would save the reservation ' s shrinking yellow_pine forest . Begaye knew that there was no way Jackson would have willingly missed the trip . She called the police . On Oct . 9 , a civilian air patrol spotted the van on Highway 64 , a remote mountain road . The state police dispatched Officer Ted Ulibarri , who found the white van parked at a rest stop about 50 miles due_west of Taos . It was locked and its windows , all_of which were intact , were covered by curtains , drawn from the inside . A quick check of the license_plates told him whom he had found . In Albuquerque , Patricia McFeeley , an 18-year veteran of the state ' s Office of the Medical Investigator , found no signs of trauma , no marks indicating blows of any kind , no stab wounds , gunshots or needle pricks on Jackson ' s body . She did find traces of marijuana , a small dose of Valium and , finally , the apparent cause of death : an overdose of the synthetic narcotic methadone . Their theory : Jackson suffered from migraine headaches . A friend or acquaintance had given him some methadone to take as an experimental remedy . About 25 minutes out of Taos on the night of Oct . 1 , he felt the blinding pains . He took the drug . After about 20 minutes , as it entered his bloodstream , he became irresistibly sleepy . He fought the drowsiness long enough to find a rest stop , pull over , close the curtains , move to the back of the van , pull_off his shoes and cover himself with the blanket . He never woke_up . Jackson ' s friends and family are skeptical . Since 1990 , Jackson had waged a concerted and successful campaign to protect the sacred forests of the Chuska Mountains against intense logging . He had raised uncomfortable questions about his people ' s financial dependence on the exploitation of their dwindling natural_resources . Where , he had asked , were the sizable profits really going ? Although he urged Navajos to &quot; Walk in Beauty , &quot; the ancient way of living in_harmony with the land , he did not hesitate to employ the white_man ' s methods -- environmental impact statements , press_conferences , demonstrations -- to get his way . Eighty-two sawmill workers had been laid_off as a result of his efforts . More jobs were at stake . There had been death threats . And , just as worrisome to the religious Navajos around Jackson , there had been signs of witchcraft directed against him , perhaps a punishment for employing the owl , an evil augury among his people . Controversy followed him , intensifying as he became a national figure in the environmental community . He appeared to be_on the verge of a decisive victory . Then , suddenly and mysteriously , he was dead . 2 . STUMPS AND SLASH -- Jackson was a handsome man , with the sharp features of his fierce Athabascan ancestors . Although a full-blooded Navajo , he lived much of his life off the reservation . Born in Shiprock , he moved to Flagstaff when he was 7 , then to Albuquerque and completed high_school in California while living with his uncle in Downey . He spoke English better than his native tongue and had taken college-level mechanical_engineering courses , although he never got his degree . He met Adella Begaye while she was an undergraduate at the University of Utah and he was working construction . She liked him because , unlike many Navajos who had only lived_on the reservation , &quot; he was smart , in a street-wise sense. &quot; He liked her , she remembers , &quot; because I still knew the traditional ways. &quot; They married in 1976 and during their first years together , they pursued their careers while living_in Tucson and Salt_Lake_City . But after Begaye gave_birth to their third child , the couple grew disillusioned with city life and decided that it was time to return to the reservation . Eventually she got a job with an Indian health center in Tsaile , Ariz. , a village of 1 # 000 nestled in the Chuska Mountains , which span the upper Arizona-New Mexico border . &quot; It was an untouched area , &quot; Begaye recalls . &quot; We still had pure water and pure air . Space . Solitude . We would go_for long walks in the woods . Or he would run in the mountains . That was his contentment. &quot; Perhaps most important , Tsaile is near the Begaye family ' s ancestral hogan , as the traditional Navajo dwelling is called . The Begaye property is a five-minute drive_off the main_road , at the end of a rough dirt_track . The forest opens there into an immense clearing at the base of Tsaile Butte -- a dramatic outcropping of red rock reminiscent_of the mountain that obsessed Richard Dreyfuss in &quot; Close Encounters of the Third Kind. &quot; Dusty blue-green sagebrush covers the ground . For four decades , Begaye ' s mother has brought her sheep here in the summer . Jackson and his wife loved to sleep_out under the stars in the quiet seclusion . The human contribution to the landscape is modest : two pens , for sheep and cows , made of rough posts , an outdoor cooking area , and the hogan , constructed in the traditional manner -- a hexagon about 15 feet in diameter , made from stacked logs , chinked with mud . The hogan is a place of meditation and family gathering . When Begaye and Jackson ' s oldest child , Shelley , turned 14 , the family held her coming-of-age ceremony , the Beauty Way , here . Here they chanted the Blessing Way , the most sacred Navajo ceremony , to help Begaye achieve spiritual equilibrium . Blue paint marks appeared on the trees around the hogan in the fall of 1989 . Begaye knew what that foretold : The trees had been selected by the tribe for cutting . She was unprepared , however , for the aftermath . When she returned to the hogan in the spring , &quot; it looked_like pictures of a war zone , &quot; she says . As far as the eye could see , the loggers had left_behind huge mounds of &quot; slash , &quot; the debris of bark , branches and limbs that results from cutting . The slash prevented sheep from grazing , created a fire hazard and blocked foot paths , a special problem for Begaye ' s elderly mother , who tripped and broke her rib while trying to navigate the piles . Only stumps were left where there had been majestic yellow_pines at least 200 years old -- the trees the Navajo call &quot; grandfather. &quot; Begaye could hear the damage , too . &quot; When you are up in the mountains that is the first thing you notice when you get_up early -- all these birds singing . And that disappeared. &quot; &quot; This isn ' t the way it is supposed to be , &quot; Jackson told her . However untraditional a Navajo Jackson may have been in some respects , he valued the harmony with nature that defines so many of his people ' s distinctive ways . Many Navajos still offer prayers to the trees when they feel upset , out of balance . Jackson understood this relationship , though he did not fully share it . He decided to speak_for these traditions , even if it meant relying_on outsiders , even if it meant using the profane to protect the holy . &quot; Trees are sacred offering places , &quot; Jackson said in one of his last interviews . &quot; This fight against the cutting is in defense of our beliefs and the beliefs of the elders. &quot; 3 . TIMBER -- The Navajo reservation covers almost 17 million acres -- an area roughly the size of West_Virginia -- in western New Mexico , eastern Arizona and a small part of southern Utah . It is a vast , semiarid tract , punctuated by deep canyons , monumental buttes and what experts consider a most improbable pine forest , something of a freak of nature for a region that gets so little rain . The ground below is rich_in oil , uranium and coal . Administered as a beneficial trust by the U.S._government , the land provides what little there is of a Navajo economy . Like many_another Third_World country , the Navajo Nation ' s chief local source of income is the sale of its natural_resources . This year the tribe ' s budget is $ 250 million . Payments mandated under treaties with the federal_government account_for $ 158 million , but of the $ 92.4 million that the Navajos generate themselves , $ 80 million comes from natural_resources revenues . The Navajo Nation is poor by U.S. standards . Average per capita income is $ 4 # 106 . Half the Navajos have no running water and one-third have no electricity . Almost 75 % have no phone . By the most conservative estimates , the unemployment_rate of the 200 # 000-person Navajo Nation is 35 % . And yet the Navajo birth_rate is almost three times that of the rest of the United States . The reservation ' s boundaries are fixed , so with each new baby the pressure grows to extract yet more wealth from the land . The Navajo forests have been logged since 1880 , at an average annual yield of about 13 million board-feet ( one mature ponderosa_pine is about 400 board-feet ) . In 1958 , the BIA and the tribe created Navajo Forest Products Industries , a sawmill that would use the reservation forest to employ Indians and to turn a profit . When the sawmill went_into operation , demand for logs skyrocketed . Until last year , the company logged , on average , just under 40 million board-feet a year . Though run as an independent business , it is owned by the tribe , which also dictates how much wood will be cut and selects the trees . It hires loggers and processes the felled trees into industrial grade lumber , mostly for door and window_frames , and into pulp for paper_mills . Often described as a model Indian development project , the company had 640 employees at its peak in 1978 , its most profitable year , and was the single largest private employer on the reservation . That year , it provided $ 4 # 248 , 000 in payments to the tribe . General_manager Ed Richards argues that the forest is healthier from this pruning . With his smooth brown skin , silver hair and powder-blue Polo windbreaker , Richards looks somehow out_of_place at the mill . He is half Navajo , but the other Indians refer to him as belanga , which is Navajo for white . &quot; There are more trees now than before NFPI started cutting , &quot; he insists . &quot; that ' s because the big_trees formed an upper canopy and blocked_out a lot of the light . We take_out those big_trees , and at first it looks horrible , but you come_back in three years and all these little guys are sprouting up. &quot; Richards isn ' t the only who argues that cutting_down old trees is good for the forest and the Navajo . Peter MacDonald , then the chairman of the tribe , sued the BIA in 1983 for mismanagement of tribal resources , arguing that the BIA had let perfectly salable timber grow old and rot . In 1986 , the U.S. Claims Court agreed , awarding the tribe $ 925 # 000 in compensation . The forest , it would seem , was being under-harvested . Jackson never bought the official line . He believed that the forestry company was sacrificing the health of the forest for profit . Alarmed by estimates that only about 5 % of the old-growth ponderosa_pines , the grandfather trees , were left , Jackson asked Lane Krahl , an independent forestry consultant , to inspect the land . Krahl was then under contract with the Forest Trust , a Santa Fe-based group that provides technical support to environmental activists . He calls what he saw in the Chuskas &quot; the most intensive logging in the Southwest. &quot; &quot; The company ' s goal was timber maximization , profit , &quot; says Krahl . &quot; They were actually doing their job well . It was just that there were no forests in their minds , only trees . And not trees , timber. &quot; Sam Hitt , a close ally of Jackson who works with Forest Guardians , another Santa Fe environmental advocacy group , says , &quot; Old-growth trees are an integral part of the forest ' s regeneration system . They stand_for several years after they die and are home to owls and birds . Then after they fall to the ground , they are home to another set of creatures , seed and fungus carriers , that are integral to the forest perpetuating itself . . . . If the tribe keeps logging like this , they will kill the forest . In the years ahead , there will be nothing left but biological desert &quot; 4 . STAKES -- After NFPI logged the Begaye property in 1990 , Jackson joined Dine ( Navajo for &quot; the people &quot; ) Citizens Against Ruining our Environment , a nascent , loosely organized environmental umbrella group . Under their banner , he almost single-handedly led a successful anti-logging campaign . He worked 60- to 80-hour weeks , operating from his cluttered kitchen , his fax / telephone sharing scarce counter space with ceramic canisters shaped like chili_peppers . He spoke -- in terse , staccato sentences interrupted by long pauses -- at countless conferences and local meetings . He built a network of hundreds of allies . He organized a run_for Earth Day . He educated himself in the jargon of forestry : basal area , commercial forest base , stumpage , slash . Until 1992 , Dine CARE made only a slight impact . The Tribal Council met with its members rarely , paying only lip_service to their urgent appeals . But in May of that year , Dine CARE filed an administrative appeal with the BIA to prevent the tribe from making its next timber sale , compartment 34 of Ugly Valley / Whiskey Creek , without an environmental impact statement . Eventually , the BIA rejected the appeal . But for nearly three months , a BIA administrative stay kept the loggers at_bay . Suddenly , appreciating the vulnerability of its logging operation , the tribe moved to address these new legal and environmental concerns . President Peterson Zah met with Dine CARE . He appointed a task_force with members of the Navajo Forestry Department , NFPI and Dine CARE . The tribe scaled back by half the amount of logging to be done_in Whiskey Creek , from 36 million to 18 million board-feet . Further , when the tribe prepared its next timber sale at Tohnitsa , it anticipated Dine CARE ' s reaction and announced that it would not log_in the most sensitive areas of the ecosystem . &quot; They had made so many changes in ( the conditions of ) that sale , &quot; says Krahl , &quot; that I said we could no longer go_to court and argue this wasn ' t sustainable forestry. &quot; Most importantly , the tribe delayed publication of a long-overdue 10-year forestry plan , possibly out of fear that it would n ' t hold_up to a challenge in federal_court . The tribe is still waiting to see whether the BIA will pay_for the environmental impact statement , which can cost as much as $ 500 # 000 . Jackson soon drew the wrath of NFPI , which &quot; had led the loggers to believe that they could keep cutting like this forever , &quot; Begaye says . &quot; When we showed that they couldn ' t , they made Leroy a scapegoat. &quot; During the summer of 1992 , while Dine CARE was holding_up the Whiskey Creek timber sale , the company warned that layoffs were imminent . The loggers held angry protests outside the mill . One sign read : &quot; Leroy Jackson Keep Your Hands Off Our Jobs . . . Or Else. &quot; At another rally , an Associated Press reporter said , the loggers hanged Jackson in effigy . Jackson was far from indifferent to the loggers ' plight . &quot; Leroy was personally affected by this issue , &quot; Hitt says . &quot; The jobs weighed heavily on his conscience. &quot; Friends say he was always thinking_up alternative businesses , such_as a furniture factory , to create new jobs for displaced workers . He urged the task_force to use timber profits for retraining . And he tried to explain his cause to the loggers . Just weeks after Richards announced that the mill would have to lay off 82 workers , Jackson invited 25 loggers to his hogan in Tsaile . Some began to understand , even sympathize . Although logger anger still ran high , local wisdom holds that the perpetrator of so sophisticated a murder must have had more at stake than a low-wage job . In investigating the tribe ' s logging practices , Jackson had discovered that NFPI was in debt , by perhaps as much as $ 8 million . Richards acknowledges that the company is in debt , but for only $ 2.8 million . He says the debt developed when the logging operations were interrupted by the environmentalists . James Carter , the BIA forester who must approve the company ' s logging plans , suggests that the real cause of the debt , whatever its size , is merely mismanagement . But Jackson suspected more -- and pressed for an audit of the company . He had no proof of corruption , but that would be a natural assumption in light of the high-profile crimes that had recently marred Navajo affairs . In 1989 , then tribal Chairman Peter MacDonald was convicted of taking_tens of thousands of dollars in bribes from contractors in return for rights to mine and drill on the reservation . After MacDonald was deposed , Leonard Haskie was appointed interim president . This past July , Haskie was indicted by a federal grand_jury in Phoenix for accepting bribes worth almost $ 40 # 000 from two lumber companies . At Jackson ' s prodding , the tribe agreed to investigate NFPI . A month after Jackson ' s death , the tribal comptroller issued a preliminary report on the financial operations of the mill . The tribe decided that a full audit was warranted . The audit is now under way , but it is uncertain when it will be completed . But the implications of Jackson ' s work extended well beyond NFPI . Informed observers believed that oil and coal interests would be Jackson ' s next target . His continued success would certainly have come at the expense of natural_resources extraction . Alex Thal , director of the Southwestern Center for Resource Analysis at Western New Mexico University and a resource consultant to the Navajo , explains : &quot; What is happening on the reservation in terms of issues like timber , grazing and water_rights is a microcosm of the Southwest . But the struggle is fiercer here because the land use is so intense . The Navajo use every inch of their land . But the precious areas have increasingly become of concern to the urban Navajos . This burgeoning environmental movement is really going_to change how resources are managed. &quot; 5 . MISSING PIECES -- The case for Jackson ' s having been murdered hinges_on a_few pieces of inexplicable evidence . The testimony of Dr. David Lang , for example . Lang lived across the street from Jackson and Begaye in Tsaile and was part of the search_party formed to look_for Jackson . He was assigned the stretch of Highway 64 between Tierra Amarilla and Taos . At 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday , Oct . 6 , a brilliantly clear day , he passed the rest stop where Jackson ' s van was found four days later . To Lang , coming from the west on this nearly deserted road , a white van among the copper autumn leaves and evergreens should have stood_out like a neon sign -- not least of all because he was looking_for it . But Lang , who remembers the rest stop and can describe it down to the A-frames and the dirt road , didn ' t see the van . If the van wasn ' t there Wednesday , where was it ? And if Jackson had died on the previous Saturday , as the police believe , how did his van get_to mile marker 94 eight days later ? &quot; It is a puzzle that keeps me awake at night , &quot; Lang says . Police have a witness , an ophthalmologist , who says he saw a white van at the rest stop on that Saturday . Police gave credence to the ophthalmologist because he could recall the precise location of the van . There are other troubling details . The police found only one set of car keys on Jackson , although Begaye insists that her husband carried a second set with him . What ' s more , she says , the position in which he was found was very much out of character . He didn ' t like to sleep scrunched_up , and when he napped on_the_road , he always did_it in the front seat . She also maintains that he never would have pulled the blanket over his own face . Finally , there is the problem of the methadone . Sal Damiani is the chief administrator for the 23 clinics of Beth Israel Medical_Center ' s methadone program in New York City . Methadone , he explains , is used primarily to treat heroin_addicts and federal regulations require clinics to dispense the liquid medication in carefully labeled single-dosage vials . The methadone that presumably killed Jackson was found not in a vial , but in a prescription pill_bottle in a dashboard compartment of his van . There were no fingerprints on the bottle , not even Jackson ' s . The only thing the torn prescription label revealed was that the bottle had originally contained an antihistamine for allergies . There was no information about patient , doctor or pharmacy . Had the methadone been in its original vial , the police would have been able to trace it to the clinic that supplied it and , thus , to its intended recipient . In short , there remains no physical evidence that would have provided leads to the source of the methadone . The police theorize that an acquaintance gave Jackson the methadone . But according to Damiani , patients are given a thorough orientation before undergoing treatment with methadone because the drug can be toxic . It is unlikely , therefore , that a methadone user would have given Jackson more_than a single dose without realizing the danger involved . A friend offering it as an experimental remedy for his migraines would certainly have warned him of the risks . Would Jackson , traveling on a lonely road at night , have gambled with his life by gulping a dangerous , unknown_quantity ? On this question of character , his friends and family say absolutely not ; Jackson , they contend , didn ' t even smoke pot . The marijuana found in his body might contradict them , but McFeeley , the medical_examiner , confirms that Jackson was no drug abuser : The trace amount of pot in his body , she says , suggests non-habitual use . Moreover , Jackson had comfortably used the same combination of drugs , Valium and Tylenol 3 , to relieve his migraines for years . Could someone else have put methadone in Jackson ' s food or drink , unknown to him , while he was in Taos , as friends speculate ? Perhaps . Methadone ' s taste , while slightly bitter , is easily disguised in a strong_drink . Clinics use Tang , but in coffee or beer it would be undetectable . The investigation is now focusing_on who gave Jackson the methadone . A final puzzle about the methadone points to another hypothesis for Jackson ' s death , one embraced by the more religious Navajo among his followers . Damiani says that if a person with no tolerance for the drug were to ingest a lethal amount , the reaction could be violent . &quot; He probably would have been nauseous and thrown_up , &quot; he says . But the police saw no signs of a violent reaction . Medical_examiner McFeeley admits that the methadone levels in Jackson ' s body were barely above the threshold of toxicity . She explains that it is the only potentially lethal drug she turned_up . Some Navajo suspect a cause that no belanga doctor could discover . 6 . WITCHES -- After her husband ' s death , Begaye had a vision in which she saw Navajos and white_men conspiring to kill him . The white_men were paying the Navajos for their magic . She maintains that this is how she learned that antizi , witchcraft , was responsible_for his death . There had been other signs . Begaye ' s mother saw a coyote -- an omen , like the owl that became the emblem of Jackson ' s movement -- before his disappearance . Lightning had appeared over the house . And Jackson ' s migraines had been coming more frequently in recent months . A medicine_man , sensing some sort of sorcery , had prescribed a prayer . But Jackson had not found the time for the traditional remedy . Witchcraft may seem an improbable MO for a murder . But it is an integral part of Navajo lore , and is still thought to have followers within the tribe . They are thought to cast spells by giving their victims a poison powder made from choice parts of corpses like whorls of fingertips or by shooting them with tiny beads made of human bone . By taking a victim ' s saliva or feces or hair to a burial_site and praying over it , witches are said to be able to induce long , painful illnesses . Some are skinwalkers , who can change themselves into were-animals , taking the form of giant wolves or coyotes and running at blazing speed across the moonlit desert plains . Skinwalkers can also be mere humans who dress themselves with animal heads and skins and perform ceremonial rituals . Capt . John Schaaf , of the Gallup City Police_Department , has encountered these spectral beings on his frequent visits to the reservation . &quot; I ' ve seen ' em at night , naked , wearing nothing but turquoise beads and an animal_skin , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' ll make the hair on the back of your head stand up. &quot; If that skeptic of the supernatural , Lt . Joe Leaphorn , the protagonist of Tony Hiller-man ' s detective novels , were real , his boss would be Edison Begay , chief of the Navajo Department of Law_Enforcement . Begay has no time for the baffling homicides that plague Leaphorn , though . He worries more about problems imported from the inner_cities , like gang warfare and drugs . Nevertheless , he offers me this story . Last summer , his mother brought her sheep to their grazing ground about 50 miles northeast of the Navajo capital of Window Rock , Ariz . She woke_up one morning to find 10 of them dead . Their necks were broken , their entrails were spread upon the ground and their anuses and testes had been cut_out and carried_off . Around the pen , she found the tracks of a giant wolf . End of story . &quot; So was it a were-animal or a skinwalker ? &quot; I ask finally . &quot; I dunno . Maybe , &quot; the chief of police says . More traditional Navajos do not readily talk_about witchcraft . It is hard to know if Begaye is being completely forthright about her suspicions . Believers have been taught that if they speak knowledgeably of witchcraft , others will suspect them of practicing it or , worse , that the malevolent beings might take revenge on them . Begaye turns_off my tape_recorder when she speaks_of it , and her words are cryptic . I interpret her roughly to mean : There are evil forces in the world and people who know how to manipulate them to perform wicked deeds . 7 . TRADITIONS -- There are 30 miles of rutted , dirt road on the way to the south rim of Canyon de Chelly , a vast gorge in the center of the reservation . Here , hidden amid the scrub_brush and the ramshackle dwellings of his patients , medicine_man Alfred Yazzie is performing a nine-day healing ceremony called the Night Way . The ceremonial hogan is in a dusty clearing surrounded by old , run-down pickup_trucks . Fragrant cedar logs burn slowly outside . Inside , Yazzie makes sacred sand-paintings . No belanga allowed . When the medicine_man finally emerges , his appearance is something of a surprise : pressed jeans , a crisp plaid shirt and close-cropped hair . Yazzie , a former police_chief who graduated from the FBI Academy , didn ' t know Jackson personally , but he had heard of the activist and approved of his protests . He describes Jackson as a champion of &quot; the old people , whose rights were being trampled and who thought they could do nothing about it . He stood_up for them. &quot; Yazzie explains that the Chuska Mountains are the male deity of the Navajo . For many ceremonies , herbs must be gathered from these mountains and mixed with herbs from the female deity , Black Mesa . Herbs from the Chuskas are also used to make special medicines for men . &quot; Sometimes , NFPI comes_through and bulldozes everything and the people who gather herbs are angry , but they have no voice with the Tribal Council , &quot; Yazzie says . Jackson &quot; tried to be their voice. &quot; &quot; Navajos need to go_back to more traditional ways , to Walk in Beauty , &quot; he tells me sadly . &quot; To live_in harmony with the surroundings , you don ' t bulldoze a mountain or kill a tree for nothing. &quot; Behind us , three women dressed in traditional garb bring trays of food and six-packs of Mountain Dew into the hogan . It is time for lunch . I am invited to a communal kitchen and offered thick Navajo fry_bread and a bowl of oily mutton broth filled with crunchy wild corn . The floor is dirt , and I eat with plastic utensils , a radio playing in the background . The young_woman serving me wears a Chicago Bulls &quot; Threepeat &quot; T-shirt . Even here , in the most remote corner of the reservation , the outside world is omnipresent . It is Yazzie ' s nemesis , the taunting , successful rival of a lost way_of_life . Leroy Jackson ' s spirit hovers here , too , regretting the poverty , fearing the change . It seems now that there will probably never be a conclusive explanation for Jackson ' s death . In three short years of activism he accomplished much -- reducing by half the amount of timber taken from the forests and raising questions of sustainability that will not soon go_away . His death has brought national attention to his life ' s cause and solidified his supporters , who have pledged to pursue his work . If nothing else , environmental groups like Hitt ' s Forest Guardians are continuing the legal battles precipitated by the activist , pressing to force the tribe to treat the spotted owl as an endangered species . But Jackson ' s death can only be described as a tragedy . And not just because he died in his prime , leaving_behind three children , or because the future of the Chuska forest is far from assured . The sad truth is that he was winning the battle , but losing the war . In a half century , it is possible that no one on the Navajo Reservation will Walk in Beauty . Living_in harmony with the land means giving_up too_much . And , then , when the Navajo no longer offer prayers to the trees , what purpose will the forest serve ? As Jackson had warned other Navajos , &quot; I have seen the stores in Oakland where they buy tapes of rain in the forest . Do we want to be like that ? &quot;</TEXT>
