   <HEADLINE> RECLAIMING AFRICA ; S . AFRICANS AGREE ON GOAL NOW , HOW TO ATTAIN IT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Out of Africa , &quot; said the ancient Romans , &quot; there is always something new. &quot; Recently , the news from Africa has been almost all bad . Famines in Ethiopia , genocide in Rwanda ; chaos in Somalia and AIDS spread ing everywhere . At times , it seems that all_of Africa south of the Sahara is headed toward a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions . The only exception to the dismal trend has been South_Africa , where the transition to non-racial democracy in the richest sub-Saharan country has given new hope for the whole region . Though last week ' s resignation of South_Africa ' s respected finance_minister , Derek Keys , shows the new government will not escape severe tests . The conservative , pragmatic Keys was a major figure in South_African politics . As a member of the formerly pro-apartheid Nationalist Party , he served as finance_minister in South_Africa ' s last whites-only government as well as in its first multiracial one . In the tough , behind-the-scenes negotiations over the budget , he is credited with putting_together a tight budget that nonetheless increased social spending for South_Africa ' s poor . His continuity in office reassured local and foreign investors that President Nelson Mandela ' s government would pursue sensible , pro-business policies -- that although South_Africa was under new management , it was still open for business . His sudden resignation -- for unexplained &quot; personal &quot; reasons -- left Mandela with a problem . The president quickly appointed leading banker Christo Liebenberg to Keys ' post . But even naming the former CEO of South_Africa ' s fourth-largest financial-services company couldn ' t quite calm investor jitters . Yet , this shouldn ' t overshadow the main story in South_Africa : After decades and , in some cases , centuries of conflict , the many ethnic and racial groups in the country have reached the conclusion that their common interests are more important than grievances and ancient hatreds . Only a_few years ago , South_Africa was at war with itself . Whites , in_general , hated and feared blacks , and vice versa . But each camp was divided within itself as well . Afrikaans-speaking whites and English-speaking whites didn ' t trust one another . Indians and people of mixed racial backgrounds were not fully accepted by either whites or blacks . Among blacks , tribal rivalries and political infighting divided the liberation movement and created opportunities for the government to pursue a policy of divide and rule . As recently as last spring , many South_Africans feared their country was headed down the road of Bosnia and Rwanda . But then came the miracle of a peaceful election and the transition to majority_rule . South_Africa is still no paradise , and its divisions remain , but out of the chaos and confusion a consensus for democracy and peace has somehow emerged . The consensus starts with patriotism . White South_Africans used to be ashamed of their country ' s isolation ; the flag and the national_anthem were symbols of oppression for blacks . Now all that has changed . White South_Africans are delighted to find they are no longer international pariahs ; and blacks , many for the first time , are learning what it means to be free citizens in a free country . In squatter camps around the cities , black South_Africans talk_about their new-found pride in a flag and the new national_anthem -- a song banned under white rule . The second point of consensus is Mandela . Die-hard segregationists praise his political maturity ; poor blacks believe him when he says he will do everything possible to help them . Along with this trust comes another asset : patience . Nobody expects change overnight ; and , at least for now , virtually everybody trusts Mandela to make the right choices . The third consensus point is that something must be done to alleviate the suffering of South_Africa ' s poor . Conservative business_leaders agree with radical activists : South_Africa faces a social explosion unless conditions in the squatter camps and in the rural poverty zones improve . While nobody likes taxes , wealthy South_Africans seem to accept the necessity of reasonable sacrifices to make the future more secure . At the same time , a broad consensus exists that the new South_Africa must avoid the economic and political errors so many black_African countries have made . South_Africans of all races and political stripes agree , by and large , that the state socialist policies of many African governments would lead to disaster in South_Africa . The other error of so many African_nations -- substituting a one-party system for democracy -- is also condemned by South_African society . Recent attempts by , among others , Winnie Mandela to control the free press have met with wide condemnation in the African National Congress , as well as outside it . The final point of South_Africa ' s political consensus concerns South_Africa ' s relationship to the rest of the continent . Once again , black_and_white South_Africans agree : South_Africa can and ultimately must turn its attention to the problems of its neighbors -- but not yet . South_Africa must solve its own problems first ; only then will it have the resources to help its neighbors . In refusing to send combat troops to Rwanda , and in defusing the expectations of neighboring African states for foreign_aid , Mandela was expressing the views of the overwhelming majority . South_African business sees vast opportunities for trade and investment in such neighboring countries as Mozambique and Zambia , and South_Africa ' s political_leaders are grateful for the help they received from the &quot; front-line &quot; anti-apartheid states in the long war of liberation , but South_Africa ' s people do not want to be dragged into military , economic or political adventures until their own situation is more secure . For it is not all rosy . The political consensus in South_Africa has limits . Blacks_and_whites , farmers and city dwellers , rich and poor remain divided about how best to achieve the goals they all agree on . South_Africa also faces daunting economic problems . About 40 % of the work_force is officially unemployed . Living standards for both whites and blacks have either stagnated or declined during the last decade . Worse still , the scourge of AIDS is making rapid inroads into the population . Up to 1 million South_Africans are believed to be HIV positive today and , despite education and prevention campaigns , the disease is spreading . But even with these caveats , the situation is clear : South_Africa is the last best hope of the African continent for peace and prosperity . If the United States is to have any African policy at all , it must begin here : with the continent ' s most promising economy and society . This does not mean the United States should shower South_Africa with loans and foreign_aid . South_Africa needs two kinds of help from the United States . One involves support for South_Africa ' s point_of_view in such international trade forums as the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . Long excluded from world markets , South_African industry developed in isolation . The transition to the global marketplace will be difficult . South_Africa will need friends who understand its special problems as it struggles to bring its economy into the global mainstream . Beyond this , the United States can help South_Africa by working toward a free-trade agreement . Agreements like the North_American Free_Trade Agreement do more_than open markets ; they encourage investment among the partners . South_Africa needs U.S. investment and markets . A U.S.-South Africa free-trade agreement would do more to secure South_African democracy than any amount of foreign_aid . The tension over Keys resignation underlines the need for formal economic agreements that will bolster confidence in the Mandela government . There can also be a security dimension to the new U.S.-South African arrangement . Inviting South_Africa to participate in joint maneuvers and joint training and planning programs would deepen the ties between the United States and South_Africa , extend the capacity of the Western world to act beyond the limits of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization area and help consolidate South_African democracy . Just as participation in NATO helped Spain ' s armed forces to accept the end of the Franco dictatorship , so an involvement with the U.S. military will help South_Africa ' s armed forces adapt to the new conditions in their country . The miracle of South_African democracy offers the Clinton_Administration a much needed opportunity for a foreign-policy success . Opportunities this good don ' t come knocking often ; let ' s hope the Administration makes the best of it. *</TEXT>
