   <HEADLINE> CONFRONTING THE STAIN OF CHIAPAS ; WITH ARMY ' S BRUTALITY NEWLY DOCUMENTED , SALINAS VOWS TO AID INDIANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mexico ' s capable young President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is struggling mightily to refurbish his country ' s image , so badly damaged by an Indian uprising Jan . 1 in the state of Chiapas and the army ' s heavy-handedness in putting it down . Salinas took a big step_in the right direction Tuesday when he visited that impoverished southern state and promised to act to solve the deep social and economic problems there . But the impact of his gesture was undermined by a report issued the same day by a respected human_rights group that documents just how harsh the army ' s repression of the rebels was . Salinas genuinely wants an end to the crisis in Chiapas , where at least 100 have died in the violence . He reorganized his Cabinet , fired the state ' s governor , ordered an army cease-fire and offered the rebels amnesty . Last weekend , in a show of how widespread sympathy for the rebels is among even pro-government Mexicans , that nation ' s Congress unanimously approved the president ' s amnesty plan . Salinas carried the amnesty declaration with him Tuesday , telling an audience of indigenous and peasant leaders , &quot; We want peace , but not a return to the situation before. &quot; He also promised economic aid for war victims and to help bring Chiapas ' largely rural population closer to the rest of Mexico in terms of the nation ' s rising level of development . But before he delivers long-term economic aid to the people of Chiapas , Salinas must respond to their more immediate human_rights concerns . For despite repeated promises by government officials to withdraw troops from Chiapas villages , many places remain occupied and subject_to often arbitrary repression . Tuesday ' s report on the uprising -- in which 15 # 000 heavily armed troops put_down a rebel force of 2 # 000 Indians -- was issued by Amnesty International . Its investigators were told of nine executions of suspected rebels and of dozens of men being detained and sometimes tortured simply because they were suspected of being rebel sympathizers . The whereabouts of many detainees are still unknown . Until Salinas addresses these concerns of the indigenous people of Chiapas , the crisis there will not be over .</TEXT>
