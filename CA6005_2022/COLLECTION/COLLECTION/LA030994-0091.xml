   <HEADLINE> BOX_OFFICE STUDY PRODUCES A ROSIER PICTURE ; ENTERTAINMENT : A SURVEY OF THEATER OWNERS SHOWS THAT TICKET SALES ARE HIGHER AND ADMISSION_PRICES LOWER THAN REPORTED FOR PAST FIVE YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More movie tickets have been sold over the last five years than was previously thought -- and the average price paid_for a ticket has been lower , according to a new study by the National Assn . of Theater Owners and the Motion_Picture Assn . of America . The survey -- based on a poll of theater owners representing more_than half the screens in the United States -- found that the average ticket price last year was $ 4.14 , a dollar less than the average previously reported in federal census samplings . Recalculating the numbers on that basis shows that 1.24 billion movie tickets were sold last year , the most since 1989 , the report said . ( Admissions are counted by dividing total box_office receipts by the average ticket price. ) The box_office gross for 1993 was a record-breaking $ 5.2 billion , thanks in significant measure to Steven Spielberg ' s &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; which grossed $ 344 million in the United States . The cost of making movies is also rising , and producers and distributors are finding it harder to make a profit , MPAA President Jack Valenti said at the annual ShoWest convention here . The new study is significant in two ways , according to Valenti and William Kartozian , president of the theater owners group . On one hand , it counters the public perception that the price of a movie ticket has been spiraling , they said . On the other , it can serve to reassure Wall_Street skeptics that movie_theaters are drawing bigger crowds than previously believed . After some members of the theater owners group challenged the census figures on average ticket prices , the two organizations hired Ernst &amp; Young to analyze five years of price data from the operators of about 57 % of the 25 # 214 movie screens nationwide . * The findings : Admission_prices were lower than previously believed . For 1993 , the average ticket price was $ 4.14 ( down from $ 5.15 ) ; for 1989 , the average was $ 3.99 ( down from $ 4.45 ) . With that information , the MPAA concluded that more tickets had been sold each year from 1989 through 1993 than previously reported . &quot; This shows movies are a better value than a lot of people realize , &quot; said Paul Rogers , who heads a 31-screen theater circuit in Wisconsin . Rogers said he was not surprised that the average ticket price turned_out to be lower than believed , because many of his customers take_advantage of bargain matinees and discount nights . Valenti , in his annual state-of-the-industry speech , told about 6 # 500 ShoWest delegates that the average_cost of making a movie in 1993 jumped 3.7 % for MPAA-member companies , to $ 29.9 million . Add the average $ 14-million cost of advertising , promotion , distribution and prints , and a studio would have to recoup about $ 44 million from a picture just to break_even , he said . In other bad news , the MPAA reported that only 28 of the 156 movies produced and released by its members last year collected $ 20 million or more in film rentals -- that is , what the producer garners from box_office revenues . That was the smallest number of films to break the $ 20-million threshold since 1988 . In 1992 , 36 films logged rentals of $ 20 million or more . * On a brighter note , Valenti said foreign attendance is_on the rise . Attendance at British theaters has doubled in the last decade to 112 million admissions , from 50 million in 1993 , he said . Admissions were up 7 % in France , 16 % in Germany , 25 % in Denmark , 12 % in Finland , 3 % in Sweden and 14 % in Norway . More and More Silver on Screen The average_cost of producing and marketing a major motion_picture -- one made by a Hollywood studio -- has risen faster than the rate_of_inflation , hitting $ 44 million in 1993 . Percent changes in average production and marketing_costs compared to the consumer_price_index : 03 # 06 , 17 # 13 Cost of Consumer Motion_Pictures Price_Index 1989 + 22.9 % + 4.8 % 1990 + 18.7 + 5.4 1991 -1.6 + 4.2 1992 + 11.0 + 3.0 1993 + 3.8 + 3.0 Source : Motion_Picture Assn . of America ; Labor_Department Researched by ADAM S .
