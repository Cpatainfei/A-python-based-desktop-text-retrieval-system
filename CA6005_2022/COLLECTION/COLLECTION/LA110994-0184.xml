   <HEADLINE> WAR_CRIMES TRIBUNAL SEEKS BOSNIAN SERB INDICTED IN GERMANY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first international war_crimes tribunal since World_War_II asked Germany on Tuesday to surrender a Bosnian Serb accused of murder and torture . In a courtroom rented at an insurance_company headquarters , three judges ruled that Dusan Tadic should be tried by the Yugoslav War_Crimes Tribunal , established a year ago by the United Nations . Tadic , 38 , has been held_in Germany since a Bosnian Muslim identified him in February at a German refugee camp . German authorities indicted him Monday on genocide and murder_charges , but have expressed willingness to turn his case over to the tribunal . Tadic is suspected of murder , torture , forced deportations and gang rape . The Tadic trial would probably begin next spring , officials said , adding that the maximum sentence would be life imprisonment . Unlike the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals after World_War_II , the Yugoslav war_crimes court cannot hand_down the death_penalty or try defendants in absentia .</TEXT>
