   <HEADLINE> COLOMBIAN CHIEF VOWS TO PRESS DRUG WAR ; INAUGURATION : NEW PRESIDENT REJECTS U.S. CRITICISM , DENIES CHARGES HIS CAMPAIGN ACCEPTED MONEY FROM CARTEL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Promising firm action against drug_traffickers and renewed efforts to bring an end to the oldest guerrilla war in South_America , Ernesto Samper was sworn_in as Colombia ' s president Sunday . Samper , an economist and veteran political insider , took power amid suspicions that his presidential campaign accepted money from the world ' s biggest cocaine barons . Samper admitted that the offer was made but denied accepting it . Nevertheless , the allegations strained relations with Washington and raised doubts about Colombia ' s resolve to press the drug war . In an effort to dispel the suspicions , Samper vowed to make ending the drug trade a priority for his government . But he also complained that &quot; nobody in the world has the moral right to give our country lessons on how to fight the narco-traffickers. &quot; &quot; We have combatted -- and we will continue to combat -- drug trafficking because of our conviction , because of the serious damage that it has done to Colombian society , &quot; he said . Samper , 44 , spoke during an inaugural ceremony at Bogota ' s 16th-Century Plaza Bolivar with an audience of 4 # 000 , including Cuban President Fidel Castro and six other Latin heads_of_state . Security was tight ; sharpshooters guarded rooftops and armored personnel_carriers patrolled streets . With emotion , the former economic development minister recalled the 1989 assassination attempt against him , allegedly by drug_traffickers . Samper has been the object of international scrutiny since a cassette recording revealed attempts by the heads of the Cali cocaine cartel to contribute approximately $ 4 million to his presidential campaign . The revelations , coming just days after his narrow June 19 victory and compounded by past allegations of drug connections , sent U.S.-Colombian relations plummeting to one of their lowest levels in decades . Insisting on his innocence , Samper has promised to increase penalties for drug_traffickers , although he said he would continue the policy of offering leniency to traffickers who surrender . U.S. officials have blasted that policy , fearing that it will be used to give a break to the leaders of the Cali cartel , believed to be the world ' s most powerful drug organization , with annual profits of between $ 5 billion and $ 30 billion . The cartel is said to control 80 % of the world ' s cocaine trade . Samper said Sunday that countries where cocaine is consumed , principally the United States , must do their share_in the drug war . &quot; My government will be as bold and resolute in the eradication of illicit crops and the persecution of drug_traffickers as it will be categorical in_demanding effective action by ( drug-consuming ) nations in reducing demand and controlling money_laundering , &quot; he said . Speaking_to a somber and largely impassive audience , the new president also expressed his willingness to find a political solution to a decades-old guerrilla war between leftist rebels and the government . The guerrillas launched a major nationwide offensive last month , attacking military bases , blowing_up bridges and briefly occupying small_towns on the outskirts of Bogota in an effort to pressure the new government to the peace table . More_than 50 government troops were killed , including a senior army_officer , Maj . Gen . Carlos Julio Gil . Samper reiterated his desire for peace Sunday . But he warned that would happen only when the rebels offer clear signs of a change of heart , and then only in direct negotiations with the government . Responding to concerns of both guerrillas and human_rights groups , the new president promised to curb rampant abuses by the police and military . Colombia ' s security_forces have been widely accused of assassinating members of leftist groups and of &quot; social-cleansing &quot; operations against street children , beggars , prostitutes and gays . Curbing the killing in this violent nation , with about 28 # 000 homicides per year in a population of 35 million , will be crucial in attracting foreign investment to help finance badly needed social programs . Violence has been a key factor_in perpetuating chronic poverty among an estimated 46 % of Colombia ' s population , especially in the badly underdeveloped countryside , despite generally healthy economic_growth spurred by the outgoing government ' s free-market policies . Samper took_over from President Cesar Gaviria . Both are of the Liberal_Party , one of two political_parties that have dominated Colombian politics for decades .</TEXT>
