   <HEADLINE> IT ' S A NEW WAVE : SURFER GIRLS GET THEIR FEET WET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Another hot morning in Palm Springs , and Dana Simrin ' s father is in the garage again listening to Jan and Dean on a scratchy transistor radio , standing perpendicular to the neat stripes of his Hang Ten T-shirt . A pharmacist stuck_in the desert with a surfer ' s mentality , he can dream . Dana turned_out to be the surfer in the family . &quot; My dad never actually went surfing , &quot; says the 21-year-old graphics student . &quot; When I was a little_girl , he was into the surfing culture -- he dressed like a surfer and listened to all_the music , but surfing seemed unreachable to him. &quot; A tiny wave slaps the sand in front of Simrin , who has walked down to this spot at 9th Street from her apartment adjacent to the Huntington Beach pier . She says her father visits occasionally , and watches her surf from the beach through binoculars . More and more women are taking_up surfing , in spite of strong gender biases that would have them beached forever in thong bikinis . They represent a swell of young female athletes claiming a place for themselves in a competitive lineup already loaded with male egos in the form of radical body surfers , body-boarders , long-boarders and teen-age boys on short boards . Raul Duarte , who has taught the surfing class at Golden West College in Huntington Beach since 1971 , says there were no women in the class when he started , but since the mid- ' 70s , their numbers have been steadily increasing . Now , &quot; if there are 20 beginners in my class , 15 of them will be girls , &quot; he says . Duarte , who also coaches the surfing team , says of eight spots on the team , one is reserved for a woman , and &quot; a lot of girls want that spot. &quot; Mary Lou Drummy of the Women ' s International Surfing Assn . says the increase of females in the water is because their parents are less inclined to discourage their daughters from taking_up the sport . &quot; They don ' t seem to think it ' s just a guy ' s sport anymore , &quot; she says . &quot; In the last few years we ' ve seen more women in the water than ever before , &quot; says Drummy , who founded the Endless Summer Surf Camp in La Jolla three years ago . &quot; There are more and more girls learning to surf -- maybe one in five. &quot; Jodi Holmes of the Assn . of Surfing Professionals , the Huntington Beach-based organization that conducts professional surfing contests worldwide , agrees in part_with Drummy ' s estimate . &quot; As far as the new surfing population -- those who are learning to surf -- such a ratio is pretty realistic , especially for recreational surfing in Southern California , &quot; she says . An increase in the number of female recreational surfers , however , isn ' t yet translating into more female competitors . Holmes says in the ASP , there are 582 men to 57 women , or about 1 in 10 . Of the 1 # 200 amateur surfers competing this year in the National Scholastic Surfing Assn. , only 25 to 30 are women , according to Janice Aragon , executive_director of the Huntington Beach-based group . There ' s a push by the ASP board to increase the number of competitions including women , which would bring a lot more of them into professional surfing . But &quot; sometimes ( male surfers ) still look_at you as if you ' re from outer space , &quot; Holmes says . &quot; And , in that regard , women are still a novelty . But the education process has improved our acceptance in the lineup . The guys seem to rate your surfing abilities , &quot; rather than just automatically moving_in_on your wave . * In Hawaii , they call a surfer girl &quot; wahine &quot; ( usually pronounced wa-HEE-nee ) -- a special word that connotes beauty , strength , stamina , fluidity and balance . Yet surfing has always been dominated by territorial young_men , perhaps because there are too few waves on God ' s blue Earth , and too many kooks ( surfer ' s lingo for unskilled surfer ) in the water . &quot; In surfing , you get_to be perfect for like one second , &quot; says Simrin , dreamily . &quot; Surfing allows women to explore their strength , their natural affinity with the ocean , and their beauty , &quot; says Debbie Beacham , 1982 world champion surfer who lives_in La Jolla . Lisa LeMasurier began surfing a_few years ago and says it ' s one of the most difficult activities she ' s ever pursued . &quot; It ' s a lifestyle , not really just a sport . It goes_deeper than that , &quot; says LeMasurier , 18 , of Huntington Beach . &quot; You practice and practice and then one day it just clicks , and you have this realization that you can surf . . . . A lot of people beginning are either before that point or just at that point where they decide if they ' re gonna go_for it or not. &quot; LeMasurier was a body-boarder when she entered Huntington Beach High_School . She wanted to be a part of the surf team because of her affection for the ocean , and surfing coach Andy Verdone encouraged her to give_it_a_try . A lot of girls wanted to join the team , but many were intimidated by the huge learning curve the sport presented . LeMasurier pushed herself , joining the &quot; dawn patrol &quot; every morning on a $ 30 board she bought a garage sale . By her senior year , she was voted female most_valuable_player . * Many young people find their favorite athletic pastimes supplanted by the growing demands of adulthood : the pursuit of higher education ; dating and marriage ; geographic changes ; credit_cards , taxes . Their track shoes and tennis_rackets are inevitably kicked to the back of the closet . LeMasurier says that won ' t happen here . &quot; No matter what I ' m doing , I ' m always thinking_about surfing -- the feeling of the water , of riding_on the waves , of getting_out there and doing_it , &quot; says LeMasurier , now a nursing student at Golden West College , where she plans to go_out for the surf team again . &quot; I ' m always gonna make time for surfing. &quot; Kim Hamrock of Huntington Beach began surfing when she was 16 . Three years later she got_married , but that didn ' t curtail her time in the water . Neither did the birth of her son Chris , now 12 , followed by Nina , 9 and Margeaux , 6 . Nina already shreds on waves . She should ; she ' s been surfing since before she was born . Her mother surfed through most of her pregnancies . Today , at 33 , Hamrock , at just under 5-foot-2 and 117 solid pounds , is the top-ranked amateur in her age division nationally , riding a long and short board with equal prowess . She believes her greatest contribution to surfing is as a teacher and mentor to young_women serious about competing . &quot; Surfing is right up there with family and God , &quot; she says . &quot; You design your life around it. &quot; Because she hopes to find a place for herself in the athletic world of surfing competition , Connie Clark , 23 , recently read a pile of books on the subject . &quot; I wanted to know what society thinks_about that . It ' s hard for them to accept women as athletes , &quot; she says , noting pro beach volleyball has made the biggest strides in gaining acceptance because , though the women are brilliant athletes , their bikinis tend to draw the crowds . Clark has done_well on the amateur circuit , and hopes to turn pro eventually . &quot; One of the major ways to get better is by having role_models , &quot; says Clark , who started a surf league for women in Huntington Beach . The league meets once a week for lessons and support . Clark says the goal is to compete up and down the coast with other leagues , which she says are slowly forming . * At Huntington Surf and Sport on Main_Street , women crowd around a rear counter buying smoothies -- pineapple / guava / mango or date and yogurt with banana . They flip through racks of clothes hung with the grunge look appropriated by the surfwear industry -- oversize flannel shirts and baggy jeans , hooded sweat shirts they could drown in -- looking_for something that might fit . Surfing is still mostly a man ' s world , or so the industry thinks . Yet women entered both the OP Pro and U.S. Open in record numbers this year , while Joyce Hoffman was an inductee into a women ' s category at the new Huntington Beach Surfing Hall_of_Fame . Even so , surfing is still plagued by sexism . Surfer Allen Lambert , 28 , says he doesn ' t mind an increase of girls and women in the water , but admits most guys would rather they &quot; decorate the beach. &quot; Lambert , who sells surfboards for Robert August of &quot; Endless Summer &quot; fame , says , &quot; I ' ve seen more girls in the water in the last month than I ' ve seen in my whole life , &quot; adding , &quot; People in the way are people in the way -- it doesn ' t matter if you ' re a girl or a guy. &quot; Verdone , who has about a half-dozen girls on his Huntington Beach High_School surf team vying for three spots while guys have 12 spots , says , &quot; There ' s nothing more cocky than a male surfer -- it ' s the most arrogant human being you can run into. &quot; He compares the female surfer to guys in their 30s , 40s and 50s who are learning or relearning the sport . &quot; They get harassed . It ' s frightening , &quot; says Verdone . &quot; And you put_in the elements of the ocean , which is a pretty scary environment . You have to have self-confidence when you surf. &quot; * There is a peak forming at 9th Street -- two- to three-foot glassy waves with nice shape and no wind . Slightly high_tide . Mostly rights . Linda Laszlo of Seal Beach thinks the water is still pretty warm , though the air feels_like it does at the end of summer . She stands on the beach wrapped in a wet towel , still wearing her short john . In other parts of the world , surfers can surf in the skin , but this is California . Laszlo has a dolphin tattooed on her right ankle , and a palm_tree , discreetly marking the inside of the same ankle . On the other foot is a weathered booty -- only one . She has worn it in Fiji , Tahiti , Australia , New Zealand , the Cook Islands , France , Spain , Portugal , England , Costa Rica . Once in Bali she paddled out three-quarters of a mile to waves that from the beach looked as if they were only three or four feet . When she got there , she was battered by a 12-foot wall of water and dashed against the infamous reef , which accounts_for the booty . As a 6-year-old , Laszlo says she was forced into ballet lessons , like most little_girls , and later coerced her parents into letting her take_up gymnastics instead . She learned grace , stamina , balance , agility and courage -- qualities she exploited when she took_up surfing at the age of 10 . One more thing , adds Laszlo : &quot; Surfers need faith to learn not to be afraid. &quot; Behind her , three young_women in short johns and sun-bleached hair approach the water ' s edge . Laying their boards down on the wet sand , they stretch languidly , like gymnasts , for several minutes as the tide keeps time . They have caught the attention of some guys climbing out of the water after a long morning session , but they don ' t seem to notice . They bounce onto their surfboards and plane perfectly into the white_water . One of them pauses to cup her hand in the salty water , then crosses herself before hopping_on and paddling out_to the lineup .</TEXT>
