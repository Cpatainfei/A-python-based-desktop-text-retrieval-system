   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / QUARTERFINALS ; FOR ITALY , IT ' S IN THE BAGGIO ; STAR FORWARD SAVED THE DAY AGAINST NIGERIA , AND TOURNAMENT MIGHT NOT BE THE SAME AGAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Clemens Westerhof , the affable Dutchman who coaches Nigeria ' s national soccer team , will catch the rest of the World Cup in Florida on vacation with his family . The proximate cause of Westerhof ' s overnight transformation from coach to tourist was plain when he left Foxboro Stadium the other day . &quot; We allowed Baggio free for five meters , and that was the problem , &quot; Westerhof said . Yes indeed . After a lackluster three , almost four , World Cup games in which he seemed more burden than burner , Italy ' s Roberto Baggio suddenly ignited at Foxboro . He zapped a bold , ambitious , but fatally inexperienced Nigeria with an 89th-minute equalizer , and added a penalty shot in overtime . The goals ended a prolonged national team drought by the slender Juventus striker who was Europe ' s 1993 player of the year . Baggio had played more_than 800 punchless minutes for Italy since scoring against Estonia last Sept . 22 . By virtue of two narrow victories in which it scored three goals with only 10 players on the field , a skilled but can ' t-finish Italian team has staggered into the quarterfinals . If , at this belated juncture , Baggio is truly back , the Cup tide could flow Azzurri blue . Saturday ' s game against Spain in Foxboro should tell . &quot; Baggio is like ( Brazilian forward ) Romario , &quot; said Raffaele Ranucci of the Italian Soccer Federation . &quot; He might even sleep for the whole game , when suddenly he finds a happy spark which lights_up the whole team . You ' ll see , now that he ' s unblocked . He can carry us toward a goal which , until the equalizer against Nigeria , seemed closed forever. &quot; As all_of Italy ' s 57 million soccer experts know , Coach Arrigo Sacchi built the Italian team around the introspective , pony-tailed convert to Buddhism whom everybody calls &quot; Roby. &quot; Il Manifesto , which speaks_for the extreme political left in Italy , hailed victory over Nigeria with a wry banner headline : &quot; Forza Buddha ! &quot; &quot; No doubt he ' s our best_man , who can solve every match , &quot; Sacchi said in Italy as he assembled Baggio and a supporting cast of 21 after having tried more_than 70 high-caliber aspirants . What is manifest after four inglorious Cup matches is that when Baggio slumbers , Italy struggles . There have been flashes from Daniele Massaro , but little to cheer about from fellow strikers Pierluigi Casiraghi and Giuseppe Signori . Like the rest of the team , they seem contaminated by Baggio ' s dour play . &quot; Now that I have scored I feel much better , &quot; said Baggio , who , at 27 , has many notches on his shoes . He has scored 109 times in 219 Italian League games with Fiorentina and Juventus and now has 21 goals for the national team . Riots broke_out in Florence in 1990 when Fiorentina sold the 5-foot-6 , 155-pound Baggio to Juventus for a record $ 26 million . From the outset , this was supposed to be Baggio ' s Cup . But -- like the Italy he rescued -- he showed little until last-minute heroics against Nigeria that must rank among the most dramatic moments of World Cup ' 94 . A reporter asked Baggio if Italy , down 1-0 against Nigeria with time ebbing , was mentally already on the plane going_home . &quot; Let ' s say that I was_on the runway and that I pulled them off , &quot; he replied softly . Seeking stronger defense and to rest his star ' s aching Achilles ' tendon , Sacchi pulled Baggio out of the game against Norway when Italy ' s goalie was ejected and the team was forced to play a man short . Baggio said later he understood why he had been taken_out , but he left the field in fury apparent to all . &quot; That would n ' t have happened to Maradona , &quot; he told Italian reporters later . Italy lurched to its sole goal against Norway with Baggio on the bench . Commentators said Sacchi had been right to pull him , that he was physically and mentally exhausted from the rigors of Italian League and postseason play . It might be better to bench him once and for all , some analysts suggested . There was worse to come . Another poor showing in a dispiriting tie with Mexico left Italy a by-the-fingernails third-place qualifier in a group it had been favored to win . Fiat ' s Gianni Agnelli , owner of Juventus , was quoted by Italian newspapers as saying that when Baggio came_off the field after the Mexico game , &quot; He looked_like a wet rabbit. &quot; &quot; Mexico was great suffering , &quot; Baggio said later . &quot; I ' ve never been able to express what I have inside me , and it ' s terrible , &quot; Against Nigeria , Baggio seemed disoriented . His passes went awry . Combinations never developed . Zealous , run-all-day defenders stripped him of the ball . Baggio was limping , running as little as possible . In the press_box , reporters for the Rome newspaper Il Tempo , grading players on a nominal scale of 10 , had given Baggio a humiliating 4.5 and were ready to go_home . Then lightning struck . &quot; Sacchi had the courage to leave him in the game and he was repaid , &quot; said Il Tempo . Baggio ' s final , rewritten grade : a not-bad 6.5. Said Antonio Matarrese , president of the Italian Soccer Federation : &quot; We finally found Roberto Baggio when we wanted him . He is a force who will come_forward as we advance. &quot; After the goal , a fresh , loose Baggio blossomed . He forced the penalty in overtime with a pinpoint pass , and he took the the penalty shot with the calm of a master tailor taking a stitch . &quot; Despite cramps , I was quite calm and sure of my shot , &quot; Baggio said . He might have been the only one , as it bounced in off the post . Nigerian goalie Peter Rufai didn ' t try to outguess the shooter . &quot; I respect Baggio a lot , &quot; Rufai said . &quot; You don ' t give him any kind of chance . I waited until he made his move . He ' s a very crafty guy. &quot; And a very different kind of hero -- shy , thoughtful , more whisperer than shouter . He was more consumed by the arrival in the United States of his wife , his 4-year-old daughter and his mother than he was by the disparagement heaped on him and his team by Italian nonbelievers . &quot; Life is more important than any game , &quot; Baggio said before the Nigeria game . &quot; I want to win and advance in the Cup . But I haven ' t lost the dimension of what is around me. &quot; Afterward , he dedicated his goals to Juventus teammate Andrea Fortunato , a 22-year-old defender who has leukemia . Baggio heads into Saturday ' s game with newfound confidence that could spell finis for Spain . &quot; Despite all_the problems , we are still going_ahead , &quot; he said . &quot; We are beginning to believe that we can do well. &quot;</TEXT>
