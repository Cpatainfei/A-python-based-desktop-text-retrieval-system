   <HEADLINE> CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN ; U.N. VOTES TO LIFT CURBS ONCE ARISTIDE RETURNS ; HAITI : BRAZIL , RUSSIA ABSTAIN . SECURITY_COUNCIL DECISION WILL PROMOTE COUP LEADERS ' EARLY DEPARTURE , U.S. SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After hearing Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher report that Haitians now &quot; enjoy their first respite from terror in three years , &quot; the Security_Council voted Thursday to lift all sanctions against Haiti on the day after President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returns to power . But there were two glaring abstentions -- Brazil and Russia . Brazil abstained as a protest against foreign troops occupying a Latin_American country . Russia abstained because it said the Clinton_Administration was too hasty in pushing a resolution through the council before Haiti ' s military_leaders had been removed and Aristide restored . The Russian abstention was a surprise . But Russian Ambassador Sergei V . Lavrov expressed his displeasure that the council had not even received an assurance from the United States that the Haitian military_leaders will leave Haiti . And he noted sharply that , even in the case of South_Africa , the council had not lifted sanctions until that country had complied with all U.N. anti-apartheid resolutions . This prompted U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright to insist : &quot; Let me be clear . My government believes that voting today is the right choice . By voting today , we promote the early departure of the coup leaders , the early return of President Aristide , and thus the early restoration of democracy to Haiti. &quot; The simply worded , relatively short resolution would disband an array of strictures imposed on Haiti to punish its military rulers for refusing to step_down in favor of Aristide . The sanctions , which have crippled Haiti ' s economy , include a ban on all trade -- which also affects oil shipments -- and a halt to all financial transactions . By a 13-0 vote , with the two abstentions , the council decided that the sanctions will end a minute after midnight EDT &quot; on the day after the return &quot; of Aristide . Council_members acted in the evening even after news reached the United Nations of the bloody grenade attack on Haitians in Port-au-Prince . Christopher ' s optimistic assessment of the situation had been delivered at an extraordinary session of the council in the morning . Christopher , sitting in the seat usually occupied by Albright , had warned the council that &quot; our courageous troops will face difficult , and sometimes dangerous , situations . There will be setbacks and risks , and we must be ready for them. &quot; Later , when told of the bloodshed in Haiti , he said to reporters : &quot; We will do everything we can to minimize incidents like that , but we can ' t reduce it to zero. &quot; Five of the seats in the 15-member council were filled by foreign_ministers , such_as Christopher , during the morning session . The general debate of the General_Assembly opened this week , an event that annually attracts scores of presidents , prime_ministers and foreign_ministers . The council usually takes_advantage of this period to schedule one session with as_many foreign_ministers as possible . Christopher ' s report on the U.S.-led intervention in Haiti was_well received by most members of the council . But Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim offered a negative assessment that signaled his nation ' s later abstention . &quot; Brazil has taken_note that a traumatic military operation was avoided , &quot; he said . &quot; Nevertheless , I should express the concern of my government over the very fact that foreign military_forces are deployed in the territory of a Latin_American country . This is a disturbing precedent. &quot; In his report to the council , Christopher referred to the troops in Haiti -- now totaling about 19 # 000 and almost all American -- as part of the &quot; multinational coalition &quot; led by the United States . He reported that the coalition had moved almost 42 # 000 tons of supplies into Haiti and that &quot; hundreds of coalition personnel are in training in Puerto Rico , on their way to oversee and monitor the police in Haiti. &quot; He also repeated President Clinton ' s promise that the United States &quot; will lift all unilateral sanctions on Haiti , except those targeted on the coup leaders and their named supporters. &quot; The Clinton_Administration had frozen the bank_accounts of Haitians in the United States and had stopped all U.S. commercial flights into Haiti . Christopher said &quot; hundreds of Haitians &quot; have left their detention camps on the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo , Cuba , and returned to Haiti because they are &quot; reassured that they can walk their streets , speak their minds and sleep_in their homes without fear. &quot; He predicted that &quot; with President Aristide ' s restoration , many_more will want to go_back to their homeland. &quot; Noting that the United States had committed $ 100 million to a Haitian economic recovery program and is &quot; ready to provide additional aid , &quot; Christopher called_on &quot; other nations and the international financial_institutions to respond rapidly and generously. &quot;</TEXT>
