   <TEXT> The calendar says it ' s near the end of winter , but the thermometer reads like summer Sunday as record temperatures 20 degrees above normal sent 400 # 000 people flocking to Los Angeles County beaches . Pushed by gusty Santa Ana winds early in the day , the mercury rose to 89 degrees at the Los Angeles Civic Center by midafternoon , breaking by one degree the record for the date set_in 1926 . The high_temperature in Santa Monica was only two degrees cooler than in Downtown . Along the sand from the Palos Verdes Peninsula to Malibu , lifeguards reported huge crowds . &quot; We think it ' s summer down here , &quot; said Los Angeles County lifeguard Lt . Conrad Liberty . From his vantage_point on the Santa Monica Pier , Liberty figured 250 # 000 people were enjoying the warm , clear beach weather from Marina del Rey to Malibu . At a lifeguard tower in Hermosa Beach , Lt . Bob Schroeder estimated that 150 # 000 people were cavorting on the sand in the South Bay . With water temperatures only in the upper 50s and strong riptides near shore , lifeguards were kept busy , rescuing dozens of swimmers from the chilly water . Meanwhile , skiers clad in T-shirts , shorts and an occasional bikini top hit the slopes at the Mountain High Ski Area in the San Gabriel Mountains , said lift supervisor Linda Catrone . The warm weather was caused by typical Santa Ana conditions , said Bruce Thoren , a meteorologist with WeatherData , Inc. , which supplies forecasts to The Times . A strong high-pressure system over Nevada generated gusty winds of up_to 40 m.p.h. at Ontario International Airport and 35 m.p.h. at Van Nuys Airport . Humidity levels dropped to the low teens . San Francisco also broke its 1926 record with a Sunday high of 81 degrees , and Oakland ' s 77 degrees cracked the 75-degree high-temperature mark set_in 1947 .
