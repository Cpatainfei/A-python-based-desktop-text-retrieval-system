   <HEADLINE> PANEL RULES CANADA WHEAT IMPORTS HARM U.S. FARMERS ; TRADE : THE FINDING HEIGHTENS TENSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES . OTTAWA WARNS OF RETALIATORY MEASURES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal panel stepped_up U.S.-Canada trade tensions Friday by ruling that Canadian wheat imports have harmed U.S. farmers and taxpayers and asking President Clinton to curb the shipments . The Canadian government expressed disappointment at the ruling and warned that punitive trade sanctions would draw retaliation . But trade experts said any sanctions are probably months away . After a six-month investigation ordered by the Clinton_Administration , the International Trade Commission found that imports of durum_wheat , used in pasta products , have &quot; materially interfered &quot; with the Agriculture_Department ' s aid to farmers , costing taxpayers roughly $ 170 million in the last two years . The investigation followed a surge in imports of durum_wheat from Canada in recent years . The U.S. grain lobby contends that Canada ' s rail subsidies enable that country to undercut U.S. farmers on price . The White_House intervention came_after lawmakers from leading wheat-growing states extracted promises in return for their support last year of the then-pending North_American Free_Trade Agreement . &quot; Imports have resulted in lower prices in the domestic market . These lower prices interfere with the wheat programs by increasing the amount the U.S. taxpayer must pay to farmers , &quot; Commissioner David Rohr said . By offering their products at unfairly low prices , Canadian farmers have &quot; compromised &quot; the spirit of free_trade between the United States and its largest export market and forced U.S. farmers to rely_on the Agriculture_Department at a time when the Administration is seeking less government intervention in the marketplace , Rohr said . Commission members recommended that Clinton impose a tariff rate quota , which would penalize Canadian farmers if they export a certain metric tonnage of wheat , or other penalties on Canada . Three of the six panel members qualified their decision , however , saying U.S. action should be temporary . Holding Canadian farmers to 40 % of the average tonnage of wheat exported between 1989 and 1992 would save U.S. taxpayers $ 25 million a year , one commissioner said . Canadian officials , who contend that the biggest surge in grain exports to this country simply filled a shortfall created by last year ' s floods_in the upper Midwest , reiterated that they will return any trade volley . &quot; Make no mistake , &quot; embassy spokesman Terry Colli said . &quot; If there is punitive action taken here , Canada will react. &quot; But there are obstacles to any quick U.S. action , including opposition by a key committee in Congress that must authorize the increase in tariffs needed to give teeth to any quotas . The threatened quotas will more likely be a sideshow to ongoing negotiations with Canada over its grain subsidy policies under the pending General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , said Robert Kohlmeyer , executive_vice_president of World Perspectives Inc. , a Washington-based farm trade consulting firm . &quot; Under the new GATT , the U.S. and Europeans agreed to ( reduce their grain subsidies ) , but the Canadian system has been left intact , which gives them freedom to operate very freely and price grain as they see fit , &quot; Kohlmeyer said . &quot; That is a much bigger issue. &quot; The Canadians have singled_out wine and pasta as prime targets for retaliation . Canada is the top export market for U.S. wines , and more_than 90 % of the 8.9 million gallons that entered Canada from the United States last year came from California . &quot; We ' re watching this very intently . We don ' t take it lightly , &quot; said John DeLuca , head of the Wine Institute in San Francisco . Leeds reported from Washington and Woutat from Sacramento . TRADE</TEXT>
