   <HEADLINE> FASHION ; KIDS WHO MODEL FACE LONG RUNWAY TO SUCCESS ; THERE ' S LOTS OF ENTHUSIASM , BUT THE ROUGH ROAD REQUIRES PERSEVERANCE . AND ONLY A_FEW WILL MAKE IT TO THE TOP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the black-and-white lobby of the John Robert Powers school of modeling and acting in Thousand Oaks , a circle of girls sits very straight on canvas directors ' chairs . They range from elementary through high_school age , with some too small to reach the floor . Sandwiched in the crowd here and there -- with a scrubbed look and a fresh haircut -- is a boy . At intervals , the youngsters lean over to speak in hushed tones ; not to each other , but to accompanying adults . Their names are called_in turn by a woman who shows each candidate into the makeup room . As their chairs empty , another parent and child move from the sidewalk to fill the space . The kids are here to be photographed for a modeling portfolio . Some are already enrolled in classes ; others are considering the step . They will spend $ 15 for the photo session , which could be the entry into a modeling career . &quot; I ' ve thought_about modeling all my life , &quot; said Kristin Combe , 13 , of Thousand Oaks , &quot; ever since I saw Miss America when I was about 6 . &quot; I ' ve always liked the glamour , having everything done for you , and being famous , &quot; she added candidly . Kristin , who has long , curly hair and braces , has emerged from the makeup and hairstyling stations , and is in the photography room , watching a boy of about 8 being coached to lean_on one elbow and adjust his chin angle for the camera . Kristin has much in common with the other candidates . Each one we meet has wanted to model either since age 6 , or &quot; . . . as long as I can remember. &quot; In front of the makeup mirror , Melissa Ulmer , 16 , of Oxnard is getting concealer on her minimal facial shadows . Melissa says her modeling ambitions stem from a lifetime of reading fashion magazines . &quot; I like Cosmo and Glamour , &quot; she said , and names print photography as her ideal career choice . For backup , she will study graphic design or architecture . Heather Porbansky , 17 , of Oxnard has finished her shoot and is off to her job as a hostess at Marie Callender ' s . She has already had nine weeks of modeling classes and , like Melissa , hopes to get_into fashion photography . &quot; Runway is second choice , but I ' m too short , &quot; she said . What are the real chances of their breaking into modeling ? Well , better than they used to be , according to Suzanne Henry , director of the school . &quot; Agents are looking_for so many different kinds of people , &quot; she said . &quot; In New York , you have to be 5-foot-9 to do runway fashion shows ; in California , it ' s not as sophisticated -- it ' s the California sunshine look. &quot; Not only does a model no longer need to look anorexic , she might work in the petite field , or the plus-size field , both of which have become more important in the industry . Also , Henry said , &quot; The ethnic look is very much in now . There ' s room for everybody. &quot; The majority of students are enrolled in the school to gain poise and confidence , Henry says . Of those who are serious about getting jobs , the majority do get_at least some paid work . This means finding an agent . To give students experience at auditioning , the school brings_in agents to meet them on the premises ; a_few have found their first jobs before graduation . But making_it to the top -- where the pay scale peaks between $ 5 # 000 to $ 10 # 000 an hour , is -- well , not as bad as lottery odds , but rare . More models earn second incomes in the trade than have primary careers . A few find work in Ventura County . At least one agency , Progressive Models in Camarillo , places men and women in local jobs in photographic work , fashion shows , cosmetic demonstrations and as movie extras . Kathleen Lucas , co-director of the agency , says that if models are willing to start small , &quot; it ' s interesting how one job can lead to another ; it spills over. &quot; To make a solid career in the industry , though , &quot; you really need to go_to L . A . on a regular basis , &quot; she said . that ' s where more dues come_in . &quot; A lot of kids come here , starry-eyed , not realizing how much work it is , &quot; she said . &quot; They don ' t realize it ' s audition after audition . It almost takes a non-working parent to take ( a youngster ) to auditions . It ' s a tough business. &quot; Still , her advice is : &quot; If you really want it , just persevere , keep working_at it . Do fashion shows ; it ' s good experience . . . the odds are better than they used to be. &quot; So , add endurance to the list of poise , attitude , makeup and movement to be mastered . Likely it won ' t discourage Kristin Combe . So far , Kristin is not yet enrolled in modeling school ; but she feels that it ' s in her destiny , and plans to persuade her parents of that . This , too , will take a measure of perseverance . &quot; I ' ll get my mom , &quot; she said of the enrollment prospect . &quot; My dad will be sort of iffy on it. &quot;</TEXT>
