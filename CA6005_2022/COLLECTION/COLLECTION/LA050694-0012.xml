   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; ALMODOVAR ' S ' KIKA ' : FREEWHEELING PARABLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the title_role of &quot; Kika , &quot; Pedro Almodovar ' s latest darkly outrageous attack on propriety , Veronica Forque emerges as an adorable innocent , as giddy as Geena Davis in &quot; Thelma &amp; Louise &quot; but as buoyant as a rubber duck in a bathtub . She ' s sweet , sex-loving and kind , but it ' s her naivete that protects her like a suit_of_armor . Had not Almodovar seriously overplayed his hand by stretching_out a clever and ironic finish interminably , &quot; Kika , &quot; which needs to lose at least 10 minutes , might well have been his most substantial picture since &quot; Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. &quot; As it is , &quot; Kika &quot; most likely will please primarily only die-hard Almodovar fans . Kika can use all_the protection she can get . A Madrid makeup artist , she ' s involved with Ramon ( Alex Casanovas ) , a commercial photographer and collage artist who feels compelled to photograph himself making_love to Kika ; this is surely the sequence that originally pulled_down an NC-17 rating ( it ' s now unrated ) . Since Ramon , who worships the memory of his mother , an apparent suicide , is so kinky , Kika is also involved with his stepfather , Nicholas ( Peter Coyote ) , an American writer and ardent womanizer ( who ' s much like the character Coyote plays in Roman Polanski ' s &quot; Bitter Moon &quot; ) . One of Nicholas ' discarded lovers calls herself Andrea Scarface ( Victoria Abril ) -- she had scarred her face in a crazed attempt to hold_on to Nicholas -- and stars in a tabloid TV_show , dressed in Jean Paul Gaultier futuristic garb , that makes Geraldo Rivera seem like Mary Worth . Kika , in turn , has a lesbian housekeeper , Juana ( Rossy de Palma , an Almodovar regular , a comedian with a regal hatchet nose ) who ' s mad for her and whose brother Pablo ( Santiago Lajusticia ) is an escaped convict , a rapist and ex-porn star ( who also makes_love to his sister ) . As Almodovar catches_up all these individuals -- and others -- in a freewheeling farce plot , he creates a contemporary parable on violence that ' s become so random and sex so bizarre that both have lost meaning ; he perceives the relationship between sex and violence as constantly evolving and treacherously complex . Although Almodovar can actually get a laugh from a rape scene , he ' s seriously concerned with an increasingly perilous and arid world in which people tend to connect destructively if they connect at all . Almodovar ' s exuberant style remains intact ; he ' s one director who ' s intensely verbal yet always keeps his films moving , always inspiring trust in his actors to cast_away virtually all their inhibitions . They in turn reward him with terrific comic portrayals . &quot; Kika , &quot; which has Almodovar ' s characteristic high gloss , may_not be a vintage film but it ' s nevertheless indelibly idiosyncratic . Nobody but Pedro Almodovar could have made_it . * MPAA rating : Unrated .
