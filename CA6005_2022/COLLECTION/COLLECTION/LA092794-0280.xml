   <TEXT> U.S. banker James R . Callahan has lived_in Chile for 14 years and feels at_ease in both business and social settings . It helps that he speaks Spanish fluently . &quot; I think it ' s extremely important , because unless you ' re able to speak the language you miss some of the nuances -- it tends to be a little bit more stilted , &quot; Callahan said . &quot; You limit yourself if you don ' t speak the language. &quot; As U.S. business with Latin_America expands and the Latino population in the United States also grows , Americans are paying closer attention to signs that say Se Habla Espanol . &quot; Spanish Spoken Here. &quot; U.S. commercial ties with Mexico are burgeoning under the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , and similar pacts with other Latin_American countries are expected in the future . The United States will be linking its livelihood more closely to a community of 19 countries and 300 million people , from the Rio Grande to Cape Horn , who share the common bond of the Spanish language . And the 155 million Brazilians speak Portuguese , a close linguistic cousin of Spanish . In the United States , there are an estimated 24 million Latinos , 7.7 million of them in California . If Americans who learned Spanish as a second language are added , the total number of U.S. Spanish-speakers is estimated at 30 million or more . Those who learn Spanish -- at_home , in the classroom or on the street -- are acquiring one of the world ' s four most-spoken tongues , one of vivid expressiveness and rich cultural tradition . Worldwide , about 370 million people speak Spanish , most of them in this hemisphere . Only Mandarin , Hindi and English are spoken more widely . Writers of Spanish have won 10 Nobel Prizes for literature . &quot; Don Quixote de la Mancha , &quot; written by Spain ' s Miguel de Cervantes in the early 17th Century , is recognized as one of the greatest novels ever written in any language . For Callahan , the First National_Bank of Boston ' s vice_president and general_manager in Chile , Spanish is a cultural and social attribute and also a major business asset . He took private language classes in the United States and was able to speak and understand Spanish when he came_to Chile with his family in 1980 as a junior lending officer . &quot; When I first came_down here , there was another American who was here before I was , the commercial manager , &quot; Callahan recalled in an interview . &quot; Within a year and three months I had replaced him , because he was learning how to speak Spanish but he didn ' t feel comfortable enough in Spanish to invite clients in_for lunches and things like that . As soon as I arrived I started inviting people in_for lunches , and he would attend but he couldn ' t really keep_up . It was a real big factor , I think. &quot; Other Americans obviously agree . Inmaculada de Habsburgo , director of the Spanish Institute in New York City , said demand is high for the institute ' s private language classes . &quot; We have a lot of professional people who want to speak Spanish , because they need it professionally , you know , so we have lawyers , we have bankers , &quot; Habsburgo said in a telephone_interview . &quot; I would think the NAFTA treaty has woken_up a lot of people , &quot; she said . &quot; They see now that they are going_to be doing more commerce , not only with Mexico but with the whole of Latin America. &quot; David Gies , a professor of Spanish at the University of Virginia , observed that Spanish is increasingly important , not only for international commerce in the hemisphere but also for working in the United States . &quot; The U.S. Census Office predicts that by the year 2010 , Hispanics will surpass any other group as this country ' s largest minority , &quot; Gies said . &quot; They are also predicting that by the year 2020 there will be 51 million Spanish speakers in the United States. &quot; Gies , who heads the university ' s department of Spanish , Italian and Portuguese , said that a generation or two ago , French and German were the most popular foreign languages in U.S. classrooms . &quot; Those were the languages that one was told to study in high_school and college because those were the useful languages , the languages of international intellectual discourse , &quot; he said . &quot; Well , that has just changed radically . French across the country is way , way down , and Spanish is way up . &quot; And that isn ' t because we ' re sitting in high_schools and colleges demanding that people take Spanish . The people are coming_to us and saying , ' Hey , look , this is the language we need to learn , this is the language we want to learn. ' &quot; The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages reported that 2.6 million middle and high_school students in the country were taking Spanish classes in 1990 . A survey by the Modern Language Assn . the same year found that 534 # 000 U.S. university_students were studying Spanish -- up 40 % from 1983 -- accounting_for nearly half of all college_students registered for foreign language courses . Lynn Samdstedt , president of the American Assn . of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese , predicted more growth in future surveys . &quot; You ' ll see a marked increase in the number of students in both the high_school and university studying Spanish because the demand is becoming much greater , &quot; said Samdstedt , who teaches at the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley . As Spanish-language studies have burgeoned in the United States , so has English instruction in Latin_America . In many grade_schools and high_schools around the region , English_classes are obligatory . And private academies dedicated solely to teaching English have proliferated . There are an estimated 100 such schools in the Mexican city of Monterrey , a business hub 140 miles south of the Texas border , but there are also dozens in cities as far away as Santiago and Buenos Aires . Most Americans already have a start on Spanish . Buenos dias . Tacos , por favor . Muy bueno . Gracias . Adios . Who doesn ' t know those words ? And cognates are easy : rapido , familia , terrorista , metal , sexo . Such words mean the same as their English look-alikes , and the list is long . But to learn a language well requires a great_deal of study and practice , and that includes Spanish . Many Americans mistakenly consider Spanish to be a simple , inelegant language , according to Samdstedt . &quot; It ' s because we suffer from an ignorance of the Spanish culture , &quot; he said . &quot; Very few people in this country know of the great literary_works that came_out of Spain and have come_out of Mexico and South_America over the past years , literary_works that compete favorably , certainly , with the other great literature of the other countries of the world. &quot; But more and more Americans are aware that Spanish is a practical language , he said . &quot; The practicality of the language , when they can see that it ' s going_to help them earn a living in the future , is one of the things drawing students to this , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s happening in communications , it ' s happening in business , it ' s happening in medicine and nursing . The need for bilingual doctors and nurses in this country is increasing daily. &quot; Samdstedt and Gies both said that increased knowledge of Spanish in the United States will translate into greater understanding of Latin_America and stronger hemispherical ties . &quot; Of course we ' re going to get closer , &quot; Gies said . &quot; Because we are , you know , in a smaller world now , aren ' t we ? We all talk_about global economy , we all talk_about diversity , we all talk_about multiculturalism . And I think in fact that there ' s a fusion going_on , a linguistic fusion across the northern-southern divide . And I think it ' s a healthy thing. &quot; Meanwhile , many native speakers of Spanish in the United States are more interested than ever in preserving their cultural heritage , according to Odon Betanzos , director of the Academy of the Spanish Language in North_America . &quot; Fifteen or 20 years ago there wasn ' t this concern for maintaining Spanish , &quot; Betanzos said by telephone from New York . &quot; This concern started to become decisive in the last four or five years. &quot; His theory is that a growing Latino middle_class is behind the movement to preserve Spanish in the United States . &quot; It is an incipient middle_class , and it knows the value of bilingualism : A bilingual person is worth two , &quot; said Betanzos , a Spanish literature professor at City_University of New York . The United States now has more_than 100 Spanish-language newspapers , 240 Spanish-language radio_stations and three Spanish-language television networks . These media are growing not only in quantity but also in quality , Betanzos said . &quot; They serve as a nexus of union for the diverse Spanish-language communities -- this together with a very interesting phenomenon of an enormous number of Spanish-language cultural or political or social organizations. &quot; Betanzos has a dream : &quot; In about 20 or 30 years , Spanish could be the language for communication alongside English in the United States . Look where we are heading . This might be an immoderate ambition , but it is an ambition. &quot;</TEXT>
