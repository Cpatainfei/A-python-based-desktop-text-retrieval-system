   <HEADLINE> AVIATION OFFICIALS VOW FAST ACTION TO ENSURE SAFETY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Facing criticism for their handling of the Boeing 757 wake turbulence problem , federal aviation officials Thursday vowed to move more swiftly to alert those in the airline industry to potential safety hazards and announced new measures intended to prevent accidents . The announcement marked the second time that the Federal Aviation Administration has taken safety-related steps following disclosures that agency officials had been warned about the potential danger of wake turbulence created by 757s years before two fatal_accidents claimed 13 lives . Testifying before the House Subcommittee on Technology , Environment and Aviation , FAA Administrator David R . Hinson pledged that within 60 days his agency would review the role of its Office of Aviation Safety and create an efficient method to identify and act_upon safety issues . &quot; I have asked specifically that they define management responsibility and accountability more clearly , so that we may be confident that safety issues are raised and receive appropriate priorities , &quot; Hinson said . Hinson said the agency has hired an official of Rand Corp. , a well-known think_tank , whose top priorities will include ensuring that safety concerns raised by scientists and researchers within the FAA get a proper hearing inside and outside the agency . And starting this weekend -- at a convention of general aviation pilots in Oshkosh , Wis . -- the FAA ' s Flight Standards and Aviation Safety office will disseminate information to pilots on the wake turbulence issue , Hinson said . He said the agency will quickly establish a process that makes certain that &quot; emerging safety issues are addressed promptly and effectively. &quot; Hinson ' s announcements came two days after an internal report concluded that the FAA may have mishandled the 757 wake turbulence issue because bureaucracy and poor communication sometimes compromised the agency ' s ability to pinpoint and respond to potential safety problems in a timely fashion . Both the internal report and Thursday ' s hearing were prompted by a June 5 story in The Times , revealing that internal documents showed that the FAA had been warned about the 757 wake turbulence hazard by its own chief scientist , Robert E . Machol , starting in 1989 . Eleven days before the first of two fatal_accidents related to 757 turbulence , Machol had predicted to FAA managers that a &quot; major crash &quot; would occur if the agency failed to take actions to protect planes , especially smaller ones , landing behind 757s . Subcommittee members Thursday repeatedly expressed concerns that the FAA could -- and should -- have acted sooner on the 757 turbulence issue . At a minimum , most appeared to believe that the agency should have publicly drawn attention to the problem sometime between the first fatal_accident in Billings , Mont. , in December , 1992 , and the second , in Santa Ana , in December , 1993 . The Billings crash took eight lives ; the Santa Ana crash killed five people , including the top two officials of the In-N-Out Burgers chain . Both accidents happened after private aircraft encountered wake turbulence from 757s landing in front of them -- the very scenario Machol had laid_out in 1989 . In his testimony at Thursday ' s hearing , Machol , who retired from the FAA April 30 , said there was &quot; nothing brilliant about any of these predictions . There ( were ) very good , solid reasons &quot; for them , he said . But the blunt-spoken , former college professor portrayed the FAA as being the victim of a &quot; bureaucratic stasis that sometimes gets_in the way of anything useful &quot; being achieved . &quot; We have a situation where someone who seems to know what he ' s talking_about made a prediction that a cataclysmic accident could happen , &quot; said subcommittee member Rep . Dana Rohrabacher , ( R-Huntington Beach ) . While the FAA often does its job well , Rohrabacher said , &quot; the way they did_it in this particular case . . . perhaps cost the lives of some innocent people. &quot; Subcommittee members seized_on the point that while the FAA has said nothing it could have done would have prevented the two fatal_accidents , the fact that the agency in May announced new policies on controllers ' handling of 757s , as well as Hinson ' s announcements during the hearing , suggests otherwise . &quot; Some things should have been done that probably could have ( prevented ) these accidents -- at least one of them , &quot; said Rep . Thomas Lewis ( R-Florida ) , a pilot and veteran congressman who requested the hearing . The subcommittee chairman , Rep . Timothy Valentine ( D-North Carolina ) , said , &quot; I believe the majority of the criticisms leveled at the FAA in this case are_on target. &quot; Asked at one point by Rohrabacher if some of the recently instituted operational procedures regarding 757s may have &quot; averted these two tragedies , &quot; Hinson paused and said , &quot; Yes , perhaps. &quot; In what congressional sources described as an unusual measure , Valentine agreed that the subcommittee would soon meet in an executive_session and draft a letter to Hinson . The action is intended to put more pressure on Hinson to follow_through with the numerous safety-related measures he has promised to take . &quot; We want to follow up and make_sure they get their act together , &quot; one congressional source said . During the five-hour hearing , subcommittee members also expressed concerns about why aviation officials in Canada and the United Kingdom took action on the 757 turbulence issue before the FAA did ; whether the FAA can balance its two missions of ensuring safety and promoting the airline industry ; and when the agency will hire a new chief scientist to replace Machol . Besides Machol and Hinson , the subcommittee heard testimony from officials representing the National Transportation Safety Board , the Boeing Co. , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ' s aviation safety reporting system , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Business Aircraft Assn . Thursday ' s actions by the FAA come two months after the agency in May adopted a policy requiring smaller planes in most instances to stay four miles behind 757s during landings to avoid their potentially deadly wake turbulence . While there is not a consensus on the level of danger , the 757 ' s &quot; clean &quot; wing and body design appear to make_it capable of producing higher-intensity levels of wake turbulence , funnels of air emanating from each wingtip containing hurricane-force winds . Responding to recommendations made by the NTSB last February , the FAA also announced in May that air traffic controllers would be required to exercise caution when dealing with aircraft_landing and taking_off behind 757s , and to encourage 757 pilots to use established approach_paths so that other pilots would not unwittingly fly into their wakes . For years , the FAA has resisted increasing the separation distance for planes landing behind 757s because it could cut the number of flights at the nation ' s busiest airports . That could result in delays and revenue losses for the aviation industry . Hinson told subcommittee members that the agency does not factor_in how the industry will be affected by the FAA ' s decision-making process . But internal documents obtained this week through the Freedom of Information Act showed that FAA officials , while deliberating on what to do about the 757 wake turbulence problem , raised the issue of how Boeing might be affected by any decision they might make .</TEXT>
