   <HEADLINE> U.S. HAS AUTHORITY TO LAUNCH HAITI INVASION , PANETTA SAYS ; CARIBBEAN : INCOMING CHIEF OF STAFF INSISTS PRESIDENT HAS MADE NO DECISION . SEN . DOLE QUESTIONS NEED FOR ACTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S._government has ample authority under U.S. and international_law to invade Haiti if President Clinton chooses to take that step , incoming White_House Chief_of_Staff Leon E . Panetta said Sunday . Although Panetta said the Administration would consult closely with Congress before ordering U.S. troops into action , he said the President does not have to seek advance authorization from Capitol_Hill . And he said additional action by the U.N. Security_Council probably is not necessary either . &quot; If we have to exercise the military option , the authority is there , &quot; he said on the NBC-TV program &quot; Meet the Press. &quot; Panetta insisted , as have other Administration officials in recent days , that the President has not decided if he will authorize military_action . But he said the Administration is determined to restore democracy to Haiti by whatever means necessary . The bleak conditions in the impoverished island nation , which have prompted thousands of refugees to flee in recent weeks , cannot be allowed to continue , Panetta said . &quot; I don ' t think we can sit_back and allow that kind of turmoil to continue , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' ve got_to act . We cannot sit_back and allow the status_quo to eat us alive. &quot; While Panetta , who takes_over as chief_of_staff today , and other Administration officials continue to maintain that Washington hopes economic and political pressure will be enough to cause the military government of Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras to step aside and allow exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return , congressional critics of the Administration policy say that the likelihood of an invasion is growing by the day . Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said it would be a mistake to risk U.S. lives in Haiti , &quot; but I think they are right on the edge &quot; of sending_in troops . Dole made_it clear he is unconvinced by the President ' s rationale for his Haiti policy . He rejected the Administration ' s assertion that the brutal Cedras dictatorship is responsible_for the large_number of refugees , arguing instead that U.S.-backed economic sanctions are causing the hardships forcing Haitians to flee . And he said the United States should not use military_force only to restore democracy . Interviewed on the CBS-TV program &quot; Face the Nation , &quot; Dole said it would be a mistake for the U.S._government to &quot; run_around invading countries because of democratic principles . If there ( are ) American interests threatened or American lives threatened , that ' s another thing . But that hasn ' t happened. &quot; Approaching the issue from the opposite end of the political spectrum , Rep . Kweisi Mfume ( D-Md. ) , chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , also said the Administration is moving steadily toward an invasion . &quot; The options are quickly running_out , &quot; Mfume said . &quot; And , unfortunately , we ' re getting closer and closer to military action. &quot; Mfume shares the Administration ' s stated objective of restoring Aristide , Haiti ' s only freely elected president , to the office he lost in a September , 1991 , coup . But the lawmaker complained that the Administration ' s inconsistency on tactics has undercut its policy . Mfume urged the Administration to increase the pressure on Cedras and his associates by tightening the embargo and possibly using air_power instead of invading . The use of force to topple the regime has been conditionally endorsed by the general secretary of the National Council of Churches and the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church . In separate statements issued in New York on Friday , the Rev . Joan B . Campbell of the National Council of Churches and the Most Rev . Edmond L . Browning of the Episcopal Church said bloodshed and suffering on the island must end quickly . While both church leaders said they had hoped military intervention would not be necessary , they said it may be the only course left in_view of what Browning called the continuing specter of terror against the Haitian people and the refusal of the Haitian military_leaders to step_down . Times religion writer Larry B . Stammer contributed to this report .</TEXT>
