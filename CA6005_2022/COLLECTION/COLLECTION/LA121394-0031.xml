   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL AGENDA ; MULLAHS LOSING GRIP IN IRAN ; PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI ' S FAILURE TO CREATE A UTOPIA THREATENS HIS POLITICAL FUTURE AS WELL AS THE POWER OF THE CLERGY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ever since he emerged in the mid-1980s as the real power behind the Islamic Republic , Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani has been known among diplomats in Tehran as the &quot; Teflon mullah. &quot; Iran ' s shrewdest politician , he secretly swapped arms for hostages with the United States , confessed -- and survived . He overhauled the economy , even reviving Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi ' s banned stock_market -- and then got other mullahs to invest . And when he wanted to run_for president , the constitution was conveniently rewritten to abolish the premiership and create an executive presidency . But today the Iranian president -- not unlike Bill_Clinton -- is captain of a storm-tossed boat , facing an upstart , conservative Parliament and fighting for his political life . And as Rafsanjani goes , so go the direction and pace of change in the Islamic Republic . &quot; The Rafsanjani era has not ushered_in the dawn of progress , as_many anticipated , &quot; said a Western diplomat in Tehran . &quot; In the past , he has brilliantly manipulated the system to achieve his ends . But now it appears to be manipulating him. &quot; Part of Rafsanjani ' s problem is timing . Plummeting oil prices have created havoc with the regime ' s budget and its five-year plan to rebuild the economy after the crippling 1980-88 war with Iraq . &quot; Rafsanjani promised too_much , &quot; Hadi Semati , an analyst at Tehran ' s Center for Scientific Research and Middle_East Strategic Studies , said in his downtown office . &quot; People were ready to accept troubles after eight years of war with Iraq , but he made a lot of promises and undertook grandiose projects . Then he couldn ' t deliver . And things have instead gotten worse. &quot; Rafsanjani ' s plight represents , on a wider scale , the declining status of Iran ' s clergy . Once widely visible on Tehran ' s streets , the mullahs are now in retreat as public_opinion turns hostile . The Iranian Revolution is turning_on its priests . At a recent Tehran wedding , the master of ceremonies did a 20-minute routine ridiculing the clergy -- in the presence of a table full of mullahs . Taxis in the Iranian_capital often pass them by , cabbies sometimes even running their fingers across their throats to signal their anger . The world ' s only theocracy may have given vast new powers to the clergy , but their failure to create a utopia has made them vulnerable . &quot; The clergy were once just interpreters of God ' s word , &quot; said the Western diplomat . &quot; Now they have to account_for the state ' s acts -- which has turned_out to be tougher . Politics has tainted them. &quot; The most damning and daring public criticism of the clergy was issued in September by a former general , Azizollah Amir Rahimi , in a letter published in Europe and circulated privately in Tehran . Suggesting that Iran was_on the verge of imploding , he noted : &quot; The clerics who have ruled the country for years are responsible_for this misery . . . . The only way to save the country is through deep changes in the way the country is run . And if Rafsanjani is not capable of doing this , he should concede to a national salvation government. &quot; The former general called_on the government to release political_prisoners , allow free elections with no examination of candidates by clerical bodies , reinstate military_officers purged since the 1979 revolution and end the &quot; regime of censorship , denunciation and the rule of the mullahs. &quot; Rahimi , who headed the military_police after the revolution , is known in Tehran as a bit of a gadfly who has written letters to the government since the shah ' s era . But this letter resonated throughout the country . The regime was quick to move . Rahimi , who is in his mid-70s , and his son were both detained . The government charged that the general was an opium_addict and incompetent to stand trial for slander . But his was not a lone voice . This fall , 134 prominent Iranian writers , publishers and translators issued an open_letter appealing for an end to censorship and intimidation . &quot; It is our basic natural , social and civil_right that our written work . . . reaches our audiences without any interference and impediment , &quot; it said . The letter evoked sharp criticism from Tehran ' s press , even though the contents were never published inside Iran . Several of the signers told The Times that they had received threatening calls or pressure to withdraw their names . Ten did . In an ominous signal of official displeasure , Ali Akbar Saidi Sirjani , a leading dissident , died in detention in November , eight months after he was charged with espionage and drug_abuse . Officials said Sirjani died of a heart_attack , although family members said he had no history of heart or drug problems . Sirjani was a best-selling writer of Iranian history and folklore and was a guest lecturer at Columbia University in the 1980s . An outspoken activist against censorship who also wrote letters to officials , Sirjani saw his books banned in 1991 after he wrote_about Iran ' s pre-Islamic history and that era ' s respect for human_rights -- an indirect rebuke of the practices of Iran ' s theocracy . Rafsanjani supporters contend that the president , whose Cheshire Cat smile has made him seem more accessible than many stern-faced mullahs , is largely a victim of the open discourse that his rule introduced and tolerated . Critics claim that the regime should be held accountable . Either way , Rafsanjani appears to have lost his veneer of invincibility . In a concession to conservatives , many of his reforms this year have been scrapped or put_on hold indefinitely , while key loyalists , including a UC Berkeley-educated brother , have lost their jobs or been replaced . Scrutiny by Tehran ' s often feisty press also has turned nasty . After a Rafsanjani sermon at Friday prayers last month , Jahan Islam , a Tehran publication , reported that the speech &quot; provided a pretext for misleading and rabble-rousing propaganda &quot; and was_full of &quot; polemic. &quot; Although Jahan Islam did not name Rafsanjani , there was no doubt about the target of its subsequent criticism . &quot; All we know , &quot; it said , &quot; is that those who have parted company with the people and who are giving , in appearance , slogans in support of the deprived and downtrodden actually live_in very expensive houses , ride the latest makes of cars , have villas , orchards and palaces around Tehran , are involved in almost every economic activity and have import-export companies at_home and abroad. &quot; A former student of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , Rafsanjani has impeccable revolutionary credentials , including multiple stints in the jails of the late shah . But since coming_to power , the son of a pistachio merchant has moved , as have his grown children , to wealthy north Tehran . His sons , at least one educated in Europe , are thriving businessmen . A daughter chairs the women ' s Olympic Committee . The family pistachio business , run_by another brother , is now heavily into exports . And the Tehran grapevine contends that one son is the largest importer of lucrative satellite dishes , although he officially denies it to friends . Rafsanjani was first elected with 95 % of the vote just a month after Khomeini ' s death in 1989 and , facing only token opposition , was reelected last year in a lackluster turnout for his second and , according to Iran ' s constitution , final term . Since his reelection , Rafsanjani ' s main political challenge has come from the man he replaced : Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who was chosen by the Council of Experts to succeed Khomeini as Iran ' s spiritual guide , a lifetime post , in 1989 . In the 1980s , the two men worked together at critical junctures , Rafsanjani as parliamentary speaker and Khamenei as titular president . Khamenei was often seen as riding_on the more charismatic Rafsanjani ' s coattails . But their current jobs often put them at_odds . The rivalry has played_out most visibly over economic_policy . Rafsanjani , a free-market mullah , pushed private ownership of business , subsidy cutbacks and debt repayment to get the economy back on track . He placed Western-educated technocrats in top jobs . But Khamenei pressed for &quot; social justice &quot; and stronger state intervention in the face of hardships . To build his own power base -- in part because his religious credentials are widely viewed_as insufficient for the job -- Khamenei has allied himself with religious conservatives and hard-liners . &quot; As president , Khamenei was more open-minded , &quot; said a leading political_scientist in Tehran . &quot; But his role and constituency changed , and he is now more conservative . Old allies have increasingly become new rivals. &quot; The victim of a tape_recorder bomb that cost him the use of one arm , Khamenei is also now jockeying for position to lead the entire Shiite Muslim world after the death last month of Grand Ayatollah Ali Araki , who was more_than 100 years old . Just Wednesday , the Islamic preempted the normal procedure by declaring Khamenei to be the marja ala , or supreme head , of the world 100 million Shiite Muslims , a move that could be rejected by Shiites elsewhere . The dispute could lead to a split within the Shiite world . In contrast , Rafsanjani -- once nicknamed &quot; Akbar Shah , &quot; an allusion to his king-like powers -- is now a lame_duck with an uncertain future . Tehran ' s ever-churning rumor mill contends that he has even tried to resign three times over the past year , a report that he denied at a news_conference this summer when he pledged to &quot; serve the system &quot; for the rest of his life . But a recent proposal to allow him a third presidential_term , which would require a constitutional amendment , has been sharply and widely attacked . &quot; The spirit of such an action -- moving_in the direction of establishing a permanent presidency -- is disagreeable and reproachable , for it lays the foundations for an authoritarian and autocratic government , &quot; warned Gozaresh Hafteh , a Tehran paper . &quot; Our country is not North_Korea , Syria or Libya to have a lifelong president. &quot; Without Rafsanjani , however , many diplomats in Tehran think that the chances of significant change in the regime are limited . And without change , Iran faces a hard future . &quot; He ' s the only one who has the power and the personality , &quot; said an Asian diplomat in Tehran . &quot; If he can ' t pull_off economic and political change , no one can. &quot; The prospect of Iran without Rafsanjani , who was the major influence in the day-to-day running of government even during Khomeini ' s life , already has led to speculation about who is next . The majority of possible successors are more conservative than the current Iranian leader . The elections are not scheduled until 1997 . But the scuttlebutt in Tehran currently favors the man who inherited Rafsanjani ' s last job : Speaker of Parliament Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri , a cleric and former Interior minister . Nateq-Nuri has been stumping the country as if on a campaign . Pressed by Kayhan , a Tehran newspaper , last month , he barely concealed his intentions . &quot; These trips are just part of my responsibility . If one day I am to serve at another post , I will take it on , just as I have never failed so far to take_on any responsibility , &quot; he told Kayhan . &quot; I believe I am capable of handling that job too. &quot; While on the same tour , he also effectively nixed a third term for Rafsanjani . &quot; If the constitution is to be altered so easily , then it will lose its legal credibility , &quot; he said . Compared with Rafsanjani , who prefers an open foreign_policy , free markets and a middle-of-the-road political course , Nateq-Nuri is widely viewed_as a social conservative and a religious ideologue with strong anti-Western views . Among the other possible candidates are long-serving Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati , who has weathered several policy storms in an attempt to keep Tehran ' s door open_to both East and West , and Deputy Speaker of Parliament Hasan Rouhani , chairman of the foreign affairs committee and a member of the National Security_Council . Yet diplomats caution against writing Rafsanjani off as long as the clerics retain power . Still believed to have the widest following of any mullah , he is unlikely to cede his influence . Even as criticism of constitutional change was coming_in , the English-language Iran News -- which first floated the idea of a third term in an interview with one of Rafsanjani ' s vice_presidents -- planted the idea of his return after an interval : &quot; The constitution clearly states that , after two terms of presidency , one must step_down and stand aside , that is , for only one intervening term , and after that , one could be nominated again . The good thing about his interval is that one will have a refreshing opportunity to study . . . the working of government in the past and the present. &quot; In fact , experts on Iran contend that even that option would require a constitutional change .
