   <HEADLINE> JAPAN FACES OBSTACLES ON INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY ; TELECOMMUNICATIONS : TOKYO PLANS SUPERIOR SYSTEM THAT LINKS NATION . BUT CULTURE , TRADE , MONEY ARE PROBLEMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Management at Kiyoshi Iida ' s workplace has urged workers to make the most of the office ' s new computer_network , including using their personal_computers to communicate with each other . There are a_few problems , however . &quot; My boss has been saying that , with the introduction of a local_area_network in the office , we should all use the system , &quot; Iida said . &quot; But I tried to send a message to him through the electronic_mail , and I found_out he was not connected. &quot; Iida ' s experience is significant because of who he is : director of the Technology Development Division of Japan ' s Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications ( MPT ) . This puts him at the very heart of a Japanese effort to catch_up_with the United States in building and using an advanced telecommunications infrastructure . Yet Iida is surrounded by evidence of Japan ' s lagging position in such key areas as computer networking and cable_television . In recent months , MPT officials have publicly acknowledged that Japan has fallen far behind the United States in areas of information technology destined to be of vital economic importance in the 21st Century . Prodded into action partly by enthusiastic U.S. talk_of building an &quot; information superhighway , &quot; the ministry has begun pushing a plan to build an advanced new telecommunications network that would be capable of virtually unlimited transmissions of video , audio and text throughout the country . Many details of the MPT proposal remain to be worked_out . But the goal is clear : to leapfrog past the United States , in_effect building a full-fledged information superhighway -- not just a narrow access ramp -- right up_to the door of every home and office in Japan . The past half-century proves that Japan can play catch-up very well . Time after time , government and industry have , acting in concert , performed brilliantly in carrying_out a strategy to dominate certain industrial sectors . For example , Japan came from behind to overtake the United States in_color televisions , automobiles and semiconductors . Success in this case , however , will not be easy . Huge costs are one factor . Regulatory and cultural obstacles are others . The plan also has become entangled in tough trade negotiations between Japan and the United States . U.S. officials say they are determined that American companies will have fair opportunities to bid for contracts . But Tokyo has not yet given the guarantees that Washington is seeking . The sums_of_money at stake are enormous . Under the MPT-backed plan , the Japanese government would provide interest-free loans to help finance construction , by 2010 , of a nationwide telecommunications network that would use highly sophisticated optical_fibers not only for the main trunk_lines , but also to provide the final connections to users . It is this use of optical_fibers for direct links to individual homes that would make the completed system the most advanced in the world . &quot; The preoccupation with fiber in the home is to make_sure the whole country is pulling_together , &quot; explained G . Russell Pipe , an American telecommunications specialist with Virginia-based TDRS Inc. , who was recently in Tokyo for a Japan-U.S. information infrastructure symposium . &quot; The Japanese are kind of perfectionist . They want a common base . They want to be ahead , as a country . . . . If Japan could get its whole act together , they would be ahead of everybody else . that ' s seemingly what they ' re talking about. &quot; Optical fiber cables are in many ways an ideal technology for telecommunications . A single strand of optical_fiber , thinner than a human hair , can carry as much information as 16 # 000 copper wires . The main drawback is the expense of manufacture and installation . MPT estimates the cost of the 15-year construction project at $ 320 billion to $ 515 billion , depending_on the network ' s level of sophistication , with an additional $ 408 billion required if the cable is to be laid underground rather than strung from poles . The fiber optics plan was officially recommended in late May by the Telecommunications Council , an influential advisory_board reporting to the ministry . Under the proposal , which has the active support of MPT officials , much of the cost would be covered by interest-free government loans , but private companies would also invest in the project . A combination of private firms and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp . ( NTT ) , the primarily government-owned company that currently provides many core telecommunications services , would handle the construction . NTT is already using its own funds to expand its optical-fiber trunk_lines . It remains uncertain , however , whether the powerful bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance will support such massive government expenditures . If the money is made available , Japan ' s top-down approach to creating a new telecommunications infrastructure could offer some important advantages over the United States ' patchwork approach . The American vision is less costly , at least in the short run . Americans foresee a system of high-capacity trunk connections with such means as optical-fiber cable as the &quot; superhighway. &quot; Less expensive technology , such_as existing telephone and cable_television lines , would provide &quot; on-ramp &quot; access for homes and offices . While America ' s effort to encourage competition among cable and phone_companies will spur innovation , it will also lead to a plethora of incompatible systems that must later be knit together at substantial cost . The emphasis on open competition among a variety of providers should help hold_down charges to consumers , but it also means America could end_up with two high-capacity broad-band wires to some homes and none to others , widening the gap between haves and have-nots . Quality could also vary from region to region as it does today with cable . There will be a tendency to save money in some areas by making_do with low-capacity copper wires that are already in place . By contrast , Japan ' s system will be designed with a single standard to work together as well in video as it does today for telephone_service . As a government-backed project , the system will reach every corner of the country , providing a basic utility much like electricity . Since high-capacity fiber would go right up_to each home , all regular network television_programs could be offered over the system , freeing up broadcast bands for other uses . By linking every home_in the country with high-capacity lines , this kind of network could also provide an almost ideal environment for the growth of multimedia services , in which data , video and audio materials can be provided to users on demand . This is important to international trade , in part because unless Japanese electronics and computer firms can engage in domestic multimedia business at the technological cutting_edge , they are likely always to be a step or two behind international competitors . The United States is currently considered far ahead of Japan in its information infrastructure because Americans enjoy much greater access to cable_television , wider use of personal_computers and much more linkage of personal_computers in networks . In the United States , 52 % of personal_computers are connected to local networks such_as office E-mail systems and databases , while the comparable figure in Japan is only 8.6 % , Iida said . The Ministry of International Trade and Industry reported last year that only 270 computer_databases existed in Japan , compared with 6 # 300 in the United States . The Japanese had 28 # 000 passwords , a rough measure of the total number of database users , compared to 2.3 million passwords in_use by Americans . Japanese citizens are far behind Americans in obtaining access to the Internet , the world ' s most important computer_network , which links smaller networks to provide tremendous access to databases and E-mail service . Language is a significant barrier because use of the Internet requires advanced knowledge of English . The typical Japanese college graduate has studied English for 10 years but hasn ' t really mastered it . The Internet simply poses too great a challenge for most Japanese , said Yoshio Utsumi , director general of MPT ' s international affairs department . &quot; You have to go_through the manual very carefully , &quot; he said . &quot; If you push one wrong key , you ' re not connected . Then when you reach the Internet , the first word you see is ' Log_in ' in English. &quot; In trying to find access to Internet databases , he added , many Japanese are figuratively &quot; blinded &quot; by English instructions . There also are serious language-related problems even when Japanese is used for computer-network communications within Japan . The language uses thousands of ideographic characters adopted from Chinese that simply cannot be typed on a keyboard as easily as Roman letters . Software has been developed to make this process easier , but mastering this skill is still far more of a challenge than learning to type English . Partly as a result , typing is still seen here as a clerical task , rather than an essential skill for all managers . In most Japanese offices , it is only the less powerful people who might have computers or word_processors on their desks . Handwritten memos continue to play a much greater role in Japanese business than they do_in the United States . With facsimile_machines now ubiquitous , many Japanese managers see little incentive for use of computer messages . Sending a handwritten fax seems much quicker and easier . Japan ' s rigid workplace social hierarchy is another factor inhibiting use of computer_networks for in-company communication . A boss might feel socially comfortable sending computer messages to subordinates , Utsumi said , but there would be much greater hesitation by a subordinate about sending ideas or requests to a boss by computer . In Japanese society , such matters call_for a face-to-face conversation . The layout of crowded Japanese offices also facilitates direct contact . Most employees work in large rooms , with dozens , or even hundreds of desks squeezed into all available space . Middle-level managers usually work elbow to elbow with their subordinates , rather than in offices of_their_own . Left on its own , Japan would not necessarily develop sophisticated networks of computer communications , Utsumi said . But globalization of the world ' s economy is leaving it no choice . Japan must_not only build a better network at_home , but also make greater use of international networks , he said . &quot; I personally tend to believe we should create our own Japanese system with the Japanese language , &quot; Utsumi explained . &quot; But after all , Japanese is a minority language . English is spoken by a lot more people . So we have to use that system , however inefficient it might be . We are destined -- doomed -- to be part of that system. &quot; The Telecommunications Council , in recommending massive investment in optical_fiber , predicted that doing so would open the door to growth of a huge new sector of Japan ' s economy . Building the network would provide the environment for growth of a $ 1.2-trillion annual multimedia market and employment of 2.4 million workers , it predicted . The goal may border_on the grandiose , the time frame may prove overly ambitious and the obstacles are considerable . But Washington is treating Japan ' s optical-fiber network project as an extremely important business opportunity for U.S. firms . &quot; We ' re studying this plan in detail , &quot; a U.S. trade official said , speaking on condition of anonymity . &quot; We would expect procurements under the plan that ' s been announced by MPT , a good size of those procurements , to be covered under the agreement that we ' re negotiating now. &quot; Times staff writer Leslie Helm in Seattle contributed to this report .</TEXT>
