   <TEXT> Ending what had become a minor drama , U.S. Coach Tim Taylor designated Mike Dunham to start in goal today against France . Taylor also indicated Dunham will start Tuesday ' s game against Slovakia and Garth Snow will face Canada on Thursday . Dunham was projected to be the team ' s top goaltender since training camp began last August , but his struggles in December and January , coupled with Snow ' s strong play , had jeopardized his starting job . Dunham , a 1990 fourth-round draft pick by the New Jersey Devils , was 22-9-2 in pre-Olympic play with a 3.78 goals-against average and an . 873 save percentage . Snow , who was 3-2 in five games with the Quebec Nordiques this season , was 13-5-3 in pre-Olympic play with a 3.22 GAA and . 884 save percentage . Taylor informed the players of his choice late Saturday . &quot; We ' re fortunate because we have two strong goaltenders who are capable of playing_at this level , &quot; Taylor said . &quot; It wasn ' t an easy decision to make , but Mike has a bit more international experience than Garth . That doesn ' t mean Garth won ' t have an opportunity to play . I anticipate giving both goaltenders a chance to play here. &quot; * Six players on the_French hockey_team have ties to the Canadian_province of Quebec -- five more_than the number of Quebecers on the Canadian squad . The 10th-seeded French team , which faces the United States today , has several Quebec natives and several others who played junior hockey there . Defenseman Steven Woodburn was born in Montreal and played in Shawinigan , Verdun and Laval . Defenseman Serge Poudrier and forward Benoit Laporte were both born in the Quebec town of Trois Rivieres . Right_wing Arnaud Briand played for St . Jean of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey_League and was chosen 240th by Edmonton in the 1983 NHL draft and right_wing Franck Pajonkowski played junior hockey in Shawinigan and Chicoutimi . Center Pierrick Maia has ties to both Quebec and the United States , having played for Bowling_Green and for Victoriaville , Quebec . The Canadian team has only one Quebec native , forward Jean Yves Roy . * Sweden has long produced world-class hockey_players , and so has Finland . They ' re seeded second and seventh , respectively , in the Olympic tournament . But Norway , the host country , has never contributed many players to the NHL and is seeded 11th here . That lowly status could change soon , George Kingston said . He coached the Norwegian national team from 1989-91 , having been recruited to help Norway create facilities and plans to stage these Games . Kingston , who went_on to coach the San Jose Sharks in their expansion season , is now director of operations for Hockey Canada , the sport ' s governing body . &quot; Norway has improved over the past few years , no question about it , &quot; he said . &quot; They ' re improving because they ' re gaining experience playing against solid , A-pool ( top-notch ) nations . The only way you can improve is through playing against the best . Goaltender Robert Schistad , who grew_up in Canada and moved to Norway seven years ago , is optimistic the Olympics will help hockey in his adopted country . &quot; The crowds are good , but they ' re not crazy like the fans back home , &quot; he said . &quot; In a_few places here , hockey is big , but it hasn ' t developed that kind of support everywhere . It ' s going_to take a while because we don ' t have that many rinks . But we ' re definitely improving and I hope it keeps going that way. &quot; HELENE ELLIOTT</TEXT>
