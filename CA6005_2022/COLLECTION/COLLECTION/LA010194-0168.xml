   <HEADLINE> RELIGION / JOHN DART ; THE JEWISH SPECTATOR A VITAL VOICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Magazines : The quarterly , which is edited in Calabasas , is small in circulation but prominent figures are among its contributors and readers . Jewish Spectator , an intellectual magazine with a religious focus , has a small circulation of about 6 # 000 and is edited in Calabasas , hardly the center of Jewish life . Yet , the quarterly ' s regular contributors include prominent U.S. rabbis and educators , among them prolific author Jacob Neusner , a former Brown University professor now at the University of South Florida . The influence of the 66-page periodical goes well beyond its limited circulation because as_many as two-thirds of its recipients are libraries and rabbis . From its 1936 founding in New York City until its sale in 1989 , Jewish Spectator reflected the independent and thoughtful , sometimes feisty , stances of founder-editor Trudie Weiss-Rosmarin . The man who bought_it , Robert Bleiweiss of Calabasas , has kept_up the tradition , observers have said . &quot; It ' s a highly credible publication , &quot; said Gene Lichtenstein , editor of the Jewish Journal newspaper in Los Angeles . &quot; There aren ' t many magazines that have a religious focus and attempt an intellectual dialogue. &quot; Commentary and Tikkun , for instance , are larger Jewish-oriented magazines with strong political interests to the right and left respectively . A third Jewish periodical , Moment , has a more popular format , according to Bleiweiss . Jewish Spectator ' s successful transition to a West Coast suburban setting and a new editor is a testament to the determination of Weiss-Rosmarin , who earned a doctorate in her native Germany shortly before arriving in America in 1931 . Through the magazine , she asserted that secular Jewish culture , politics and community work in America still needed an intelligent , vibrant Judaism in_order for Jews to survive as a_people . &quot; Weiss-Rosmarin had enormous confidence in Judaism , its attractiveness and ability to compete with contemporary cultures in the modern_world , &quot; wrote Deborah Dash Moore of Vassar College in a recent biographical essay . By the 1980s , the septuagenarian editor had moved to Santa Monica and was looking_for someone to help with the journal . Given an honorary doctorate by Los Angeles ' Hebrew Union College in 1984 and frequently requested as a speaker in the Los Angeles Jewish community , Weiss-Rosmarin also lectured at the Brandeis-Bardin Institute in Simi Valley . It was through that Jewish educational institute that she found her successor . Writer-editor Bleiweiss , a former director of the institute , was being consulted by Weiss-Rosmarin for publishing advice , but she also began suggesting that he become a partner with her in the magazine . &quot; We consistently said no because my wife Vida and I were busy building our commercial business , primarily publishing labor_union newspapers , &quot; Bleiweiss said in an interview . &quot; Then when she was reaching the end of her life in 1989 , she called us one day and said that we absolutely had to take it or it would be_on our heads that the magazine would fail , &quot; Bleiweiss said . She had declined offers from three institutions to buy the magazine , asserting that the publication would lose its personality and independent thrust , Bleiweiss said . &quot; I went_over to see her and to turn her down , but I spent 2 1 / 2 hours with her and walked away buying the magazine , &quot; he said . That was May , 1989 . Weiss-Rosmarin died on June 26 , shortly after her 81st birthday . In her final , combined spring-summer issue , Weiss-Rosmarin wrote_of Bleiweiss : &quot; He is a remarkably knowledgeable trans-sectarian Jew totally committed to the sustenance of Jewish values for this and subsequent generations. &quot; Bleiweiss , now 59 , said he and Weiss-Rosmarin were_on the same ideological wavelength . The difference between Weiss-Rosmarin and himself was that she was a Talmudic scholar . &quot; I ' m a darn good editor and a devoted , scholarly Jew but not a scholar , &quot; he said . Her description of her successor as &quot; trans-sectarian &quot; referred to Bleiweiss ' contacts with all three of Judaism ' s major branches . His son , Mark , an adviser and frequent contributor to the magazine , is in New York studying to be an Orthodox rabbi . But Robert and Vida Bleiweiss said they feel very close to Reform_Judaism . He has taught a Bible class for nine years at Rabbi Steven Jacobs ' congregation , which merged last year to form Kol Tikvah in Woodland Hills . Nevertheless , his three senior contributing editors are prominent in Conservative_Judaism : Rabbi Daniel Gordis , dean of administration at the University of Judaism ; Rabbi Bradley Shavit Artson of Mission Viejo and Deborah E . Lipstadt , associate_professor of modern Jewish studies at Emory University in Atlanta . Lipstadt , a former director at the Brandeis-Bardin Institute who also taught at Occidental College , is the author of the critically acclaimed &quot; Denying the Holocaust : The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory &quot; published in 1993 . Told late last year that she didn ' t have to write her usual column for Jewish Spectator in light of her busy book-publicizing schedule , Bleiweiss said that Lipstadt responded , &quot; Don ' t you dare . Save those pages. &quot; Lipstadt ' s essays and commentaries have appeared in every issue that Bleiweiss has edited . When Bleiweiss took_over the magazine , its overall circulation was down to about 1 # 500 and its paid circulation stood about 800 . Today , he said , the paid circulation is at 1 # 307 . But were it not for their income from publishing a dozen labor newspapers , the Bleiweisses said , they would be unable to keep it going . He said Jewish Spectator lost some subscribers when he wrote an editorial three or four years ago praising the social_work of the ultra-Orthodox Chabad Lubavitch movement . &quot; Lubavitch is not mainstream Judaism and has a lot of things wrong with it ideologically and functionally , but I certainly can ' t argue with people who put millions and millions of dollars each year into reclaiming drug-lost youth and feeding hungry people , &quot; Bleiweiss said in an interview . Bleiweiss also received heat for criticizing the many Jewish federation organizations across the country , which he characterized as &quot; still mainly run_by assimilated , ignorant , self-serving people. &quot; But in the winter issue , published this week , he wrote that he was encouraged by what he saw as hopeful signs at the November convention of the Council of Jewish Federations in Montreal . An editorial he wrote in the fall issue scored supporters of Jerusalem ' s Hebrew University for selecting singer Michael Jackson for the 1994 Scopus Award to be presented in Beverly Hills in January . &quot; This will mark the umpteenth time a major Jewish charity will have reached_out cynically and opportunistically to tie the name of a distinguished Jewish institution to a member of the American glitterati , motivated entirely by the fame and box-office appeal of the person to be honored , &quot; Bleiweiss wrote . Previous winners of the Scopus Award , cited for excellence in their chosen field and philanthropic generosity , have included Frank Sinatra and Nancy Reagan , as Bleiweiss noted . But the awardees have also included author Eli Wiesel , pianist Arthur Rubenstein , the late Rabbi Max Nussbaum , conductor Zubin Mehta and film director Steven Spielberg . After Jackson ' s selection was announced in July , he became the subject of a lawsuit and investigations involving possible child molestation . Bleiweiss made no comment on those stories , but did conclude his editorial by betting that the singer would still get the award and &quot; the joint will be sold out. &quot; Representatives of American Friends of Hebrew University , however , announced recently that Jackson had asked to have his name withdrawn at the time he canceled his world tour , saying he needed help to overcome an addiction to pain relievers . The organization said Cable News Network talk_show host Larry King would receive the award instead . &quot; I ' m happy to say I lost the bet , &quot; Bleiweiss said this week . &quot; It should not be given to a superficial figure in pop culture. &quot;</TEXT>
