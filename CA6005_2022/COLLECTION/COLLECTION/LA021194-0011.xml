   <HEADLINE> ALBUM REVIEW ; HOT CHOPS , SMUG HUMOR ; * * ; Z ; &quot; SHAMPOOHORN &quot; ; BARKING PUMPKIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Little doubt about the lineage : The pyrotechnic licks , the smug humor -- Ahmet and Dweezil are Zappas through and through . But beyond free-thinker rhetoric and hot chops , the young brothers don ' t really have much to say , and even then it ' s not much new.Couldn ' t they think_of any more original attacks than &quot; Jesus Clone &quot; or the macho-rocker mocker &quot; Did I Mention It Was Huge &quot; ? Despite wry wit and Dweezil ' s encyclopedia of guitar tricks , this is more like Rush with a sense_of_humor than late papa Frank ' s &quot; Hot Rats. &quot; And that ' s often perilously close to the kind of slick , sterile rock that Frank delighted in chewing_up and spitting_out as ruthless parody . New albums are rated on a scale of one star ( poor ) , two stars ( fair ) , three stars ( good ) and four stars ( excellent ) . STEVE HOCHMAN</TEXT>
