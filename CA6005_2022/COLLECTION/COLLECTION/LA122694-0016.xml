   <HEADLINE> IT ' S ALREADY 1997 FOR MUCH OF HONG KONG ; CHINA TAKEOVER : WESTERNERS POUR IN , THE ECONOMY BOOMS AND A COMMUNIST SCION BECOMES AN ACCIDENTAL PHILANTHROPIST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Brits are losing Hong Kong in 1 # 000 days , but Westerners are not fleeing the prospect of imminent Chinese rule , they are pouring in . The U.S. contingent has doubled in size since 1984 , to 30 # 000 , and includes a large squadron of investment_bankers whose presence puts upward pressure on the already high apartment prices . The Japanese are flocking here as well , hoping that the Chinese don ' t carry grudges , and even the Brits have multiplied , from 17 # 700 to 24 # 700 , at the very time you ' d expect them to be leaving . The biggest influx by far is Filipina maids , 116 # 000 by official tally . The Chinese don ' t do housekeeping work anymore . They ' ve got better prospects , thanks to the capitalists who operate freely on both sides of the Hong Kong-Chinese border . I surveyed that border_on an hour-long helicopter ride sponsored by Government Information Services , my hosts on a recent junket . We flew into Chinese territory where the water_buffalo once roamed but now the bulldozers and front-end loaders play as south China is transformed into a great eyesore of prosperity -- factories , low-rises , high-rises and smokestacks -- built with Hong Kong money . Whereas Cuban exiles in Miami have refused to do business with Cuba as long as Fidel Castro is in power , Chinese exiles in Hong Kong have been merrily making deals on the mainland since 1979 , when Deng Xiaoping said the magic words : &quot; To be rich is glorious. &quot; &quot; 1997 happened a long_time ago , &quot; says Iain Donnachie , an Australian who runs money for an outfit called Asia Equity . He ' s telling me this over lunch at the China Club atop the old China Bank_building , the former headquarters of the communists , which now attracts the downtown finance crowd . Tables are set with silver chopsticks and the waiters are dressed in Mao suits . We ' re surrounded by money managers and Hong Kong millionaires with dual passions : investing and playing the horses . Hong Kong is a tout ' s paradise -- betting_on the races accounts_for 8 % of the gross_domestic_product . There are too many bettors and not enough horses , a problem that was solved with the building of a ghost track , where people cram in by the thousands to watch giant overhead screens . The cheering from the ghost track is just as loud as the cheering from the primary track , where the live horses can be seen . It was at the primary track where Larry Yung made his fabulous ghost bet , the most interesting story I heard in Hong Kong . Yung is not your average plunger . He ' s one of the new breed of billionaires from the communist side . His father is a vice_president in the current Beijing government , but Yung left China in 1979 to seek his fortune in Hong Kong . He got_into semiconductors , and one thing led to another , until a year ago when Yung became the first mainlander to be named steward of the Royal Jockey_Club -- safari hats , English roses , the most elegant of Maughamian enclaves . He owns and bets_on horses in the efficient Hong Kong way , with a hand-held_computer that makes the wager and debits his bank_account ; if he wins , the proceeds are credited to his bank_account , with no fuss and bother about cash and tickets . He was checking his balance one day when he noticed $ 37 million in Hong Kong dollars ( about $ 5 million U.S. ) he didn ' t know he had . This was the payoff from a 100-1 shot that he ' d bet by mistake . that ' s Hong Kong in a nutshell : A son of a communist official arrives , prospers , wins $ 37 million by accident and doesn ' t realize it until he consults his hand-held_computer . He donated the windfall to Stanford_University , where his daughter is enrolled . From what I can gather , Hong Kong is more relaxed about the Chinese takeover than it was in 1989 , the year of Tian An Men Square , but that ' s because of all_the commerce . What the financial types are saying is that capitalism has gone too far to be stopped and that Hong Kong is China ' s cash_cow -- a cow that Beijing would never be dumb enough to butcher . The Chinese and the_British already have agreed to the basic_principle of the changeover : that China will not meddle in Hong Kong affairs and will leave the legal_system intact for at least another 50 years . But both sides have been bickering over the details . The British keep referring to the rule book and the Chinese keep saying that they will make their own rules when they get here . It doesn ' t help that Hong Kong ' s current governor , Chris Patten , is a former government official from Bath , England , whose only prior experience with the Orient was in his neighborhood Chinese restaurant . The Hong Kong media are practicing what is locally referred to as &quot; self-censorship &quot; in preparation for 1997 . Already , the TV_stations are being careful not to broadcast anything that might miff officials in Beijing . The Chinese are miffed about a lot of things , such_as the contract for a new container port that was awarded to Jardine . Jardine is a British company that got its start smuggling opium into China in the 19th Century . It was_on Jardine ' s behalf that Britain fought the Opium War to defend the drug_traffic and won Hong Kong in the process . The British governors , meanwhile , have developed a sudden interest in domestic reforms -- power to the people , elections for local legislators -- none of which they bothered about until quite recently , when they started packing their bags . As the Brits prepare to pull_down the Union_Jack , the Hong Kongers have surpassed them in GDP per person . It ' s an amazing achievement when a colony becomes more productive and wealthier than the colonizers . In spite of its very low taxes and a high level of social_services ( good schools , 47 % of the population in government housing ) , Hong Kong manages to run a budget surplus and keep itself out of hock . This poses a problem for the newly arrived investment_bankers : With no government debt , how can you start a decent bond market ?</TEXT>
