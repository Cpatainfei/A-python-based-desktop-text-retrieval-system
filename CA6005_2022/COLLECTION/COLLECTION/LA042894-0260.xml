   <HEADLINE> RICHARD NIXON : 1913-1994 ; 400 VIEW BIG EVENT ON CATHEDRAL ' S BIG SCREEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They solemnly filed into Orange County ' s most famous church on Wednesday wearing business_suits and T-shirts , high-heeled shoes and sneakers to watch the funeral of former President Richard Nixon on large-screen television . About 400 people turned_out at the Crystal Cathedral , including Howard and Janet Richards , of Sierra Vista , Ariz . They were vacationing in the area in their recreational_vehicle when they heard that the church would air the funeral live_on its massive Sony Jumbotron screen . The Richardses , who are 62 and both voted for Nixon , said they decided to stay over in Orange County another day and watch the services at the Garden Grove church , instead of viewing it in their RV . &quot; I thought it was a sad day in U.S. history for the President to allow himself to be entangled in that type of affair , &quot; Howard Richards said of the Watergate scandal . &quot; I think most people would have withdrawn from society , but he didn ' t do that , &quot; he said , adding that Nixon may have contributed even more to the world after he left_office . &quot; He ' ll be remembered more for his contribution to foreign affairs &quot; than Watergate , he said . Leo Schmock , 47 , of Garden Grove chose to come_to the Crystal Cathedral rather than view the funeral at_work . &quot; The screen ' s bigger , &quot; Schmock said , &quot; and I wanted to be able to come here by myself so I can reminisce . And I think a religious setting is appropriate. &quot; Schmock , who as a Long_Beach police_officer 20 years ago met Nixon when the President was hospitalized for phlebitis , also had viewed the casket on public display at the Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda on Tuesday night . &quot; It took about seven hours , but it was worth it , &quot; he said . Laura Summers , 30 , of Anaheim was about the age her daughter is now when Nixon resigned . Summers grew_up in Yorba Linda and her daughter , Nicole , now 10 , attended a preschool on the site where the Nixon library now stands . She said she brought Nicole to the church to see the funeral on television because it was a historic event . &quot; I like to see anybody down that far fight their way back and die with dignity , &quot; Laura Summers said of Nixon . &quot; I ' m a nurse and I just have a lot of respect for life. &quot; Nine-year-old Amber Sterbling of Garden Grove was one of about 30 youngsters from the Crystal Cathedral ' s after-school day-care program watching the services . Amber knew Nixon had died &quot; of a stroke &quot; and had been the 37th President ; that he was 81 years old and &quot; had two kids. &quot; Did she know anything about Watergate ? &quot; No , &quot; Amber said with a shake of the head .</TEXT>
