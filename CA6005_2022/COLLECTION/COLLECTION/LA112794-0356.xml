   <HEADLINE> TRW , LOCKHEED : HIGH-TECH HELP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> TRW Inc. and Lockheed Corp. , which built some of the nation ' s most capable spy_satellites during the Cold_War , are trying to apply that same technology to help clean_up radioactive waste left from the nuclear arms race . The work is part of a broad effort by the Energy_Department to use advanced technology to cut the staggering cost of cleaning thousands of contaminated sites across the nation . A Lockheed computer chip crucial to radar-imaging satellites may allow a breakthrough in increasing the rate at which contaminated soil can be processed , company officials say . The Lockheed work is under way at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory , a huge nuclear_weapons facility where the Energy_Department buried 6 million cubic_feet of plutonium from the 1950s until the 1980s . The plutonium and other radioactive elements were packaged in steel barrels and placed in shallow pits , where the drums quickly corroded and released large amounts of radioactivity into the soil . Cleaning the mess is costly , complex and slow . The bottleneck , ironically , is not the pace at which the soil can be cleaned through acid leaching or other processes , but the time it takes_to measure the radioactivity in the dirt before and after the cleanup , said Lockheed vice_president Steve Winston . Until now , germanium sensors -- much like Geiger_counters -- were used to monitor the radioactivity , but the time needed to take a reading limited the processing of soil to about one ton per hour . The satellite chip , however , allows arrays of up_to 10 germanium sensors to operate as much as 100 times more quickly . Winston is hoping that Lockheed will allow soil to be cleaned at a rate of 100 tons per hour . Meanwhile , TRW ' s unit in San Bernardino is using some of its software developed for interpreting spy_satellite photos in the Energy_Department ' s massive cleanup job . The software allows a series of overhead photographs to be manipulated so that an intelligence_analyst can see a ground-level view of a scene , a big help in interpreting the purpose of secret facilities . The process involves sending camera-carrying robots into buildings that are so highly contaminated that workers -- even in protective gear -- would exceed their allowable lifetime limits of radiation in minutes . In many cases , the blueprints for former bomb plants have been lost and nobody is even sure what is inside these contaminated structures , said Daniel G . Culver , TRW ' s managing director for operations and projects . &quot; The beauty of this ( system ) is that you can use a joystick and get virtual imaging , &quot; Culver said . &quot; You can scan down through the ceiling , see all_the piping , wiring and things you would n ' t even get from an engineering drawing. &quot; TRW is hoping diversification into the environmental , medical information and commercial space industries will preserve about 300 jobs in San Bernardino that otherwise would be lost by next year , Culver said .</TEXT>
