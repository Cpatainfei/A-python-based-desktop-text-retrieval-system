   <HEADLINE> THE ERA OF FRAGMENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pop culture is dead . At least pop culture as we had come_to know and love / hate it in the recent past , when it dressed , entertained and molded America en masse . When culture popped_in the 1960s , the entire country would tune_in to &quot; The Ed Sullivan Show &quot; every Sunday night , forging a vocabulary for the next day ' s national dialogue around the water cooler . Three decades later , such solidarity is unthinkable in the face of a 500-channel future . &quot; The most interesting part of the story could be the disappearance of pop culture , &quot; said New York trend analyst Edith Weiner . &quot; It has to have a history communicated through some generational mechanism . What we have now are flashes coming and going everywhere . That is not culture . Those are fads . . . . We have become a potpourri of cultures , and we have lost much of what was our culture. &quot; So if you ' re scouting out pop culture , don ' t look_for , say , a uniform that could brand an entire generation , the way love beads once made a silent hippie declaration . Now culture pops with flashbulb swiftness . Now you see belly button rings and blue bar drinks , now you don ' t . &quot; You take the picture , it ' s here and it ' s gone , as opposed to a motion_picture , &quot; Weiner said . &quot; Then you can say there are a lot of photographs there , and if you put an album together , yours would look different from someone who lives three blocks from you. &quot; * If you wanted to costume someone in youth drag , you could make her a preppy . Or a biker . Or a grunge girl . &quot; If you look_at teen-age culture , there ' s a phenomenon of teen-agers with a Chinese-menu approach for their lifestyle , &quot; said Robert Avila , chief economist for the Futures Group of Glastonbury , Conn . &quot; My niece said she used to be a punker , and now she ' s a new romantic and she dresses like something out of ' Gone With the Wind. ' Pick and choose your lifestyle to suit your current mood and fashion. &quot; In trendspeak , this is the era of fragmentation when it comes_to pop culture -- or pop cultures . Trend watchers call this a nation of subcultures . With technology getting higher and higher , commerce can cater to smaller and smaller audiences . Fragmentation is linking arms with another late-20th-Century phenomenon -- a sharply stepped-up rate of change -- to create an explosion of culture pops . &quot; Imagine a kid today 10 years old never understanding you ' d only have a choice of five networks to watch , which is something a child 3 to 5 years older can remember , &quot; Weiner said . &quot; Instead of having a generation defined at the 20-year break , it ' s more being defined in two-year breaks_in time . We ' re experiencing generations of pop culture in one life span. &quot; And as we peer into the jaws of the millennium , technology is helping to resculpt the bedrock of culture -- the economy -- moving us out of the Industrial Age and into the Information Age . As we interact with the world via our newly interactive TVs and computers -- 27 million U.S. households have computers -- another cultural phenomenon is unfolding : the trend toward isolation . &quot; This brings more people back to their home , &quot; said Gerald Celente , director of the Trends Research Institute in Rhinebeck , N.Y. &quot; A reverse process is taking_place . The Industrial Age took people away from homes to work locations . At the end of the Industrial Age , people are moving away from a centralized location to decentralized locations. &quot; At work , 7.6 million people telecommute and 40 million hold full- or part-time jobs based in the home , trend analysts say . At school , more work-at-home parents will respond to a declining education system by teaching their children at_home , Celente said . He projects that by 2005 , the number of home-schooling families will grow to more_than half a_million from the current 200 # 000 . At leisure , Americans can shop electronically and socialize in cyberspace without leaving home . The new importance of home base is drawing sharply different responses . &quot; The streets are so dangerous or perceived to be so dangerous that you would rather be at_home where it ' s comfortable , &quot; said Neil Feineman , a Los Angeles journalist who develops magazines about youth culture . &quot; I think that ' s a terrible thing . &quot; Live music at a concert is not the same thing as seeing it on pay per view in your house . You are one more step removed and , from a moralistic standpoint , I wonder about the distancing . What happens when you do things in cyberspace as opposed to face to face ? If cybersex is so satisfying , why have real sex , which raises so many emotional and health questions these days ? &quot; But some society watchers view the trend toward an empowered home base equipped with modem as a good thing . Celente calls it Techno Tribalism : &quot; People will be drawn_back to their communities , and they ' ll take more of an activist role to see that their neighborhood develops in_accord with their belief systems. &quot; In trend analyst Weiner ' s view , computerized discourse , far from being alienating , can sow meaning in human affairs . If love is blind , then computers are the ultimate blindfold . &quot; Pop culture in previous eras was interaction , one-on-one and in_person , &quot; she said . &quot; The emerging pop culture ' s interaction will be just as meaningful when it ' s one-on-one but not in_person . &quot; In the sub-pop culture of being_on the ( computer ) network , very often people don ' t know what a person they ' re having an intimate relationship with looks_like . You don ' t know that it ' s a female or male or their race or height . It ' s just to talk . To the people engaged in it , it ' s extremely meaningful. &quot; Herewith , some upcoming culture pops_in the pan . Changing Success Ethic Yuppie materialism as it defined the ' 80s will be consigned further into history . More and more , success in life for people of all ages will be defined by their ability to find a deeper purpose . &quot; Being a yuppie was about having a killer job that provided a sense of accomplishment at_work , &quot; said Watts Wacker , a futurist for Yankelovich Partners Inc. of Westport , Conn . &quot; The need for achievement isn ' t manifesting itself at the workplace . It ' s manifesting itself at_home . Status has gone from being external -- what impresses you ? -- to internal -- what works for me ? &quot; Celente said that search will involve examining the past . &quot; This may be the basis of the so-called paradigm shift , &quot; he said . &quot; The paradigm we ' re living under now is the Industrial Age , where success is measured in professionalism , accumulation of wealth and status . The ancient philosophies were based on the axiom that human life had a reason for being , much beyond what our culture of professionalism says it is . &quot; With a new paradigm , we ' ll go_back to believing that life has a reason for being and we ' re not accidental glitches in an unfeeling universe . People are going_to look_at success as living a better quality of life. &quot; Baby_boomers who are also aging hippies will lead the charge , in Celente ' s view . &quot; During the ' 80s and ' 90s they blended into the mainstream , &quot; he said . &quot; They got their jobs and made money . They don ' t want to do that anymore . They will try to work less and buy less . It ' s the essence of less is more. &quot; Celente calls that stripped-down existence a move toward Voluntary Simplicity , a trend abetted by the proliferation of such penny-pinching newsletters as the Tightwad Gazette . &quot; ( Boomers ) are previewing their mortality in the death and illness of their parents , &quot; he said . &quot; They ' re saying , ' I cannot afford to be in my parents ' condition when I get_to be their age . If I ' m going_to be stressed out , if I ' m exhausting myself , I ' m going_to end_up as an inmate in a nursing_home . So I ' m going_to move_back to the land. ' &quot; At Play As if the world weren ' t Barbied-out , Mattel celebrates Barbie ' s 35th birthday with the new -- Glitter Barbie -- and the old -- a reintroduction of the original 1959 doll . Elsewhere , the main pleasure_principle is , if it can be watched , then it can be turned_into a toy , as toys continue to take their cues from cartoons and movies . &quot; It helps perpetuate the toy in the market and allows toy makers to minimize research and development on a new virgin idea , &quot; said Jill Krutick , a leisure analyst for Salomon Bros . in New York . That means kids will still clamor for action figures inspired by the TV_show &quot; Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , &quot; which Bandai of America produced in limited supply for Christmas ' 93 , ensuring vociferous demand this year . Other action figures that will receive a big push include spinoffs from TV ' s &quot; Biker Mice From Mars &quot; and the animated film &quot; Batman : Mask of the Phantasm. &quot; Hasbro ' s Elvis collector ' s dolls will take_a_bow , and computer_games will become more sophisticated . Cars and planes will appear more realistic , Hollywood actors will find a new outlet for their talents in sharper game images and sound , and there will be more games available in 3-D and on CD-ROM . &quot; I see the trend of ( CD-ROM ) sales increasing at such a rapid pace that I can see the handwriting on the wall for floppy disc units by 1995 , &quot; said Johnny Wilson , editor in chief of Computer_Gaming World magazine in Anaheim . &quot; I may be too cautious , because it may be by Christmas time . . . that that ' s true. &quot; Hot computer_games will include Lucas Arts ' &quot; Tie Fighter &quot; game , a sequel to last year ' s popular Star Wars-inspired &quot; X-Wing Fighter &quot; game ; the sequel will enable gamers to fight on Darth Vader ' s side for the first time . Also eagerly anticipated is &quot; Gabriel Knight : Sins of the Fathers , &quot; a CD-ROM game by Sierra On-Line that will employ Tim Curry ' s voice . Neo-Punk Disco is passe . Again . But as you pack away your bell-bottoms , fear not that the fashion world is running_out of past to plunder . Yesterday ' s punk is today ' s neo-punk . &quot; After the ' 70s there was punk , and that ' s why punk is back , &quot; says Los Angeles clothing designer Maggie Barry , whose label is VanBuren . &quot; Everyone is trying to figure_out what to do . It ' s another scene to follow . It makes_sense because these are confused times. &quot; Unlike the angry rebels of the ' 70s , the new punks are only into wearing safety_pins , not wielding them . Neo-punk is fashion and nostalgia , not class_warfare . &quot; Fashion is always a statement of the times , and what better statement to make than punk , when everyone is running_out of funds , &quot; says Luis Baraja , fashion director of Detour magazine . Of course , that doesn ' t stop such pricey designers as Gianni Versace and Chanel from leaping into the neo-punk fray with slitted and slashed pink leather from Italy and a harness bra from Paris . Late at night , neo-punks are turning_up at a new club called the Sham Lounge , named after the late ' 70s English punk_rock group Sham 69 . The club happens Thursday nights at the C ' n ' C Club on Sunset Boulevard , spins hard-core to pop punk and early ' 80s hip-hop -- &quot; from Circle Jerks to Blondie &quot; and beyond -- in the words of club promoter Ben Yang . He said the club attracts nostalgic neo-punkers under 30 . &quot; We ' re in a marked transition period , &quot; said journalist Feineman , &quot; and looking_backward for pop culture is a more reassuring way of staying viable in the marketplace until newer trends become more understandable. &quot; Cybersocializing More people will be hanging_out with friends in cyberspace . Twenty million people around the world are hooked_up to electronic_bulletin_boards , and their ranks are growing by an estimated 10 % a month . &quot; This rate_of_growth won ' t continue for long , &quot; said Howard Rheingold , editor of the Whole Earth Review and author of &quot; The Virtual Community : Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier. &quot; &quot; we ' ll run_out of people on Earth. &quot; Rheingold sees computers as a healing tool in our increasingly fragmented society . Computers are bridges to a &quot; virtual community &quot; of computer users next door or across the country -- &quot; ordinary people helping each other in concrete Middle American real community ways , when your kid is_sick , getting advice or raising the money to have an operation. &quot; Cybersocializing on a more intimate plane is also expected to grow . People with specialized tastes are finding each other in adult bulletin_boards , such_as Maryland ' s Throbnet , where the computer version of phone sex thrives . And on-line dating is expected to leap from the fringe to a mainstream meeting ground . &quot; A lot of people out there would never dare go_into a bar , &quot; Rheingold said . &quot; What a weird way to meet people , and ( yet ) nobody thinks that ' s weird . Here , at least you get_to know people . It ' s a real opportunity. &quot; High-tech dating will also take a turn_in the next few years with the introduction of interactive video-dating TV channels . The lovelorn will punch_in their requirements , view clips of appropriate candidates and flag desirable parties , who would then run their videos . Eventually , phone_numbers would be exchanged . Says Steven Dworman , publisher of the Los Angeles-based Infomercial Marketing Report : &quot; The love of your life could be_on your TV tonight. &quot; Woodstock Trend-tracker Celente , writing in the Trends Journal , predicts that the 25th anniversary hullabaloo this year around Woodstock will be &quot; the top entertainment trend of the year . . . the biggest cross-promotional / marketing tie-in extravaganza of the year and possibly the decade. &quot; The ' 90s incarnation of 1969 ' s Woodstock Music and Arts Fair will be big business . Two of Woodstock ' s original backers have linked up with Time Warner to mount a massive reprise of the defining megaconcert of the ' 60s . Their plan is to produce an Aug . 13 and 14 concert at the original Woodstock site with some of Woodstock I ' s rock ' n ' rollers . The scope could be massive . Promoters expect as_many as 250 # 000 people to spend $ 100 each to attend -- and the rest of the world could tune_in via global satellite links and virtual_reality technology . Organizers hope for a total audience of 1 billion . Somehow through all those zeros , Celente sees a spiritual spinoff from the Woodstock refrain . &quot; It has the probability of setting a tone for the nation , if it recaptures even a part of what the original Woodstock was about , &quot; he said in an interview , &quot; and that ' s the peace and love message , the symbol of the bird on the guitar. &quot; Home Shopping It ' s only going_to get easier to spend money without crossing a store ' s threshold as more media and retail companies leap into the lucrative home shopping fray . Time Warner Entertainment has linked up with Spiegel Inc. to launch two shopping channels next year : The 24-hour Catalog Channel will hawk goods from Spiegel ' s catalogues , as well as its Eddie Bauer merchandise . The other channel will be interactive -- subscribers to Time Warner Cable ' s Full Service Network in Orlando , Fla. , will be able to shop in catalogue &quot; stores. &quot; Office workers far from their living-room TVs will be able to let their fingers do the shopping at catalogue kiosks tested in Chicago office_buildings last year . A mere touch of the MicroMall Inc. screen enables passers-by to peruse catalogues and order by credit_card . Even the television networks are gearing_up for an interactive shopping future . NBC plans to coordinate some of its programming with the Interactive Network system , a digital broadcast network based in Mountain View , Calif. , that will be unveiled this year . Viewers will be able to shop_at home and participate in game_shows . And the mainstays of home shopping -- the $ 3-billion cable and infomercial industries -- will get glitzier . &quot; Can We Shop ? &quot; a talk-and-spend show hosted by Joan Rivers , will make its debut this month on QVC . The network is also launching Q2 , an upscale channel that will hawk trendy labels -- &quot; an attitude , not a demographic , &quot; as its new chief , ex-Fox executive Stephen Chao , told New York magazine . &quot; The one thing that has been proven in the infomercial industry is it takes a specialized creative talent to create programming capable of selling , but also entertaining and worth watching , &quot; said Dworman of the Infomercial Marketing Report . &quot; Very few people have accomplished that . that ' s why literally only one out of 15 infomercials are successful . As the channels proliferate , you ' ll run_into the same problem. &quot; Snowboarding The unruly adolescent of winter sports is experiencing sharp growth spurts -- and pains -- as it schusses its way toward the front of the line at ski resorts . The fledgling in-your-face pastime of Generation Xers and their younger siblings is growing by 30 % a year . One in 10 of those on ski slopes are shredders , slang for fans of the snowboard , essentially a skateboard for snow . &quot; It ' s a new sport with lots of money and lifestyle identification , &quot; says L.A. journalist Feineman . That lifestyle is a blend of skateboarding , hip-hop fashion and raucous youth , a combination that can be nerve-racking for typically older skiers , who often reluctantly share the slopes with snowboarders . Indeed , ski resort owner Alpine Meadows Inc. found that 87 % of the Lake Tahoe-area and Utah skiers surveyed didn ' t want the daredevil shredders on their mountain . &quot; It ' s the most important test of rebellion versus the status_quo in the youth culture that I know of because it ' s set_up so diametrically opposed to skiing , &quot; Feineman said . Some resorts , mindful of the coming snowboarding boom , are catering to the shredders . Big Air Green Valley in the San Bernardino Mountains turned its slopes entirely over to snowboards this season . And Squaw Valley near Lake Tahoe is luring them with a six-foot-high volcano for fancy footwork . The Wild_West The Wild_West will continue to rope_in a broad spectrum of American dogies . Country_music is Tush Pushing its way into our leisure_time . In the ' 90s , it has more_than doubled its share of the album market to 16.5 % , said trend-tracker Celente . More_than 500 full-time country_music dance clubs operate nationwide , with a dozen opening every month . And a dozen Western films -- TV and feature -- are in the works . Country is even cutting a swath in that previously un-country-like country -- the book industry . In a reprise of Barbara Mandrell ' s great success with her 1990 &quot; Get_to the Heart : My Story , &quot; Naomi Judd ' s &quot; Love Can Build a Bridge &quot; is a literary hit , having quickly climbed the bestseller lists after its November debut . More autobiographies are_due from a line-dance of country stars : Dolly Parton and Reba McEntire have signed seven-figure contracts , and this year ' s autobiographers will include Charley Pride , Roy Clark , Glen Campbell and Travis Tritt . One of L.A. ' s hottest restaurants , Jackson ' s on Beverly Boulevard , serves roasted chicken under wagon-wheel chandeliers . And Celente noted that America ' s romance with the Wild_West is reflected in the popularity of such utility vehicles as Ford Broncos and Jeep Cherokees .</TEXT>
