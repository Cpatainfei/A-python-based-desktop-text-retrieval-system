   <HEADLINE> U.N. PUSHES DRUG INTERDICTION IN FORMER SOVIET CENTRAL ASIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United Nations ' top drug control official watched 14 metric_tons of captured hashish go_up in smoke here Saturday and rewarded this Central Asian_nation with more money to fight narcotics bound for the streets of North_America and Europe . The hash , with an estimated street value of $ 650 million , was seized by the authorities as it entered Uzbekistan last year from neighboring Afghanistan . Thirteen tons came from one shipment destined for Belgium and Canada in trucks with cargo listed as nuts and raisins . Inside the trucks , the drug was packaged in solid black slabs weighing a kilogram each , wrapped in plastic and labeled as French salad_dressing . Cardboard boxes full of the captured hashish were mechanically shoveled into a blazing furnace Saturday at an aluminum plant on the outskirts of Tashkent , the Uzbek capital . Giorgio Giacomelli , executive_director of the U.N. Drug Control Program , watched with satisfaction . He is touring Central Asian republics of the former Soviet_Union on a mission to improve drug interdiction measures . &quot; In the short space of two years , we have noticed tremendous progress in the competence and disposition of the Uzbek authorities to deal with this growing problem , &quot; he said . Giacomelli signed an agreement to give Uzbekistan $ 500 # 000 over the next two years to help officials train narcotics officers , set_up testing laboratories and prepare anti-drug legislation . The five Central Asian republics -- Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan and Kazakhstan -- occupy a vast region bordering Afghanistan , Iran and China . The Afghan civil_war and the collapse of border controls when the Soviet_Union fell_apart in 1991 has opened_up the area as a route for smugglers from Afghanistan , one of the world ' s largest producers of hashish , opium and heroin . Seizures as large as the 13-ton hashish shipment show the potential size of traffic through the region . Besides the hashish burned here Saturday , Uzbek authorities say they have seized two tons of marijuana , heroin , opium and synthetic drugs since 1992 . But Giacomelli estimates that no more_than 10 % of the drug_traffic through Central Asia is intercepted . Bernard Frahi , head of the U.N. drug agency ' s Europe and Middle_East operation , said crime is getting more organized in the former Soviet_Union , and Central Asia has the potential to produce its own narcotics . Another danger is that drug_abuse in Central Asia could grow . &quot; They must keep_an_eye_on what is happening in nearby Pakistan and other such countries , &quot; Giacomelli said . &quot; Wherever there is heavy traffic , very soon there will be heavy abuse. &quot;</TEXT>
