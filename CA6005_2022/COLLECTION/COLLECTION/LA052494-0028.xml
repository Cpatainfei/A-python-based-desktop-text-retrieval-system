   <HEADLINE> HANDGUN CRIME STATISTICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * I was especially intrigued by the last paragraph of &quot; Handgun Crime Soaring in U.S. , Report Says , &quot; May 17 . I quote , &quot; The survey also found that 38 % of the victims who were armed attacked the individuals seeking to harm them . One-fifth of those attempting to protect themselves with a firearm were injured , compared to almost half who used other weapons or had no weapon at all. &quot; I guess it comes as no surprise that the notoriously anti-gun Times would bury this intriguing bit of news at the very end . SAM BRUNSTEIN Glendale * By now everyone knows the position of the National Rifle Assn . regarding the Second Amendment , but does anyone know the NRA strategy for keeping guns out of the hands of those using them to commit crimes ? J . S . KLEINSASSER Bakersfield * Are all you gun advocates who want assault weapons part of &quot; A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free_State &quot; as specified in the Second Amendment ? that ' s the prelude to the part you guys always quote , but you completely disregard it . Do you want an assault weapon in every home for self-defense ? Or would you have equipped the law office in San Francisco , where eight people were killed , with assault weapons ? Your emphasis is always on &quot; criminals &quot; committing these crimes , whereas these mass_murders are committed by deranged men who can go_out and buy these weapons of war to commit these atrocities . And then they often commit suicide , which precludes prosecution . &quot; Law-abiding responsible citizens &quot; are not &quot; being stripped of their self-defense &quot; ( letters , May 14 ) . We -- and the police -- are being outgunned by wackos with weapons of war that will fire 100 bullets at one loading . HERBERT HERR Altadena * In response to &quot; Hold Handgun Makers and Sellers Liable , &quot; by Erwin Chemerinsky and Richard Mosk , Commentary , May 19 : Isn ' t it interesting that lawyers would state that &quot; it should not matter if there is an intervening criminal act. &quot; Haven ' t they missed the point ? Criminals are the problem , as well as a justice system that no longer cares about victims , only sound-bites . How much money do lawyers expect to earn from these fraudulent lawsuits ? Why aren ' t they now suing Ford and General Motors because drunk drivers kill innocent people ? Maybe brick makers should be sued because chimneys fell during the earthquake ! Second , according to recent information , of the 38 # 000 firearms deaths , only 13 # 000 are murders . I ' m sure someone committing suicide would never think_of taking sleeping pills or jumping_off a cliff in the absence of firearms . JOHN THOMAS APA Canoga Park * Let ' s see . The threat of criminal proceedings for handgun crime is not enough . As such , only the introduction of endless tort litigation would stop the criminal use of handguns . Right . And why not just call the new federal statue , &quot; The Attorney Full Employment Act of 1994 &quot; ? STEPHEN R . ASHLA Torrance</TEXT>
