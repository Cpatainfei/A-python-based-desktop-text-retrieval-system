   <HEADLINE> MILITARY CHIEFS OPEN DRIVE TO FORCE ARMED SERVICES TO COOPERATE MORE ; PENTAGON : INCREASED POOLING OF WEAPONS AND OTHER RESOURCES IS THE GOAL . FIERCE TURF BATTLES AMONG ARMY , NAVY AND AIR_FORCE ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nation ' s top military leadership has begun a major new push to force the individual armed_services to pool their equipment and resources more thoroughly , setting the stage for what could become one of the Pentagon ' s fiercest turf battles in years . Officials said that the effort , spearheaded by Adm . William A . Owens , vice_chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , could have important implications for the Pentagon budget , the structure and weapons of each of the services and even the way the military fights future wars . The project already has spawned strong objections from the individual services . Insiders said that the Air_Force , Army and Navy are strongly opposed to the effort , on grounds that it would deprive them of their traditional power to decide such issues on_their_own . Senior military_officers said that Owens , who assumed the vice_chairman ' s job in March after having earned a reputation as one of the Navy ' s most reform-minded long-range planners , is likely to face an uphill battle . &quot; Anytime you get_into this , you get_into each service ' s crown_jewels , &quot; a senior military_officer involved in the effort declared . Nevertheless , officials said , the project has the backing of Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs , who is convinced that the services must go_further than they have so far to combine their resources in the face of declining defense budgets . The new effort would force the Army , Navy , Air_Force and Marines to take_account of what other branches of the armed forces can do_in carrying_out various missions , from intelligence gathering to gaining air superiority during the early phases of a campaign . It also would require for the first time that the services plan their budgets cooperatively , ceding turf or eliminating weapons where top military_leaders decide that another service can do a job better . Today , each service plans its own budget . Owens already has gotten the project under way using a little-known committee known as the Joint Requirements and Oversight Council -- a high-level panel comprising the vice chiefs_of_staff of each of the individual services , all_of them four-star generals or admirals . The group has begun a series of reviews aimed at identifying weaknesses , duplication and overlap in the various services ' modernization and procurement programs , with the aim of eliminating redundancies and filling vacuums . In considering those issues , however , the group also is expected to thrash_out potential changes in the roles and missions of each of the services and potential changes in military doctrine that may be necessary to carry_out any reshuffling that it proposes . Among the questions that the panel is pondering , for example , is whether the Air_Force should take_over Army programs for high-altitude air-defense and whether the Army ' s multiple-launch rocket system should be adapted for use by Navy warships . The panel also is expected to recommend adapting current precision-guided weapons , sensor systems and computer software so all four services can take_advantage of common high-technology systems , such_as satellite links and target-acquisition devices . That , in turn , could require the services to give_up some of the pet weapons projects that they now have_on the books which were launched a decade or so ago when the services operated more as individual forces . Officials said that Owens hopes to have an initial set of proposals this autumn , in time for the fiscal 1996 budget . But critics cautioned that the effort is so radical it is unlikely to yield many major changes for at least a year or more . Robert W . Gaskin , a former Pentagon strategist now with Business_Executives for National Security , a defense-monitoring group , said that Owens ' effort is long overdue . The Owens project , outlined in a document labeled &quot; Assessing Joint Warfighting Capabilities , &quot; seeks to review military requirements for today ' s post-Cold War missions , evaluate the readiness of existing forces and decide what new weapons_systems will be needed . It calls_for high-level reviews in 10 separate areas , including intelligence , surveillance , command-and-control , strike capability , air superiority , strategic mobility , overseas presence , joint readiness , information warfare and counterproliferation . To some outside observers , the effort appears to be intended partly to enable the military to preempt -- if not usurp -- a separate , civilian-run Commission on Roles and Missions set_up by former Defense_Secretary Les Aspin . It also would provide the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff -- and the vice chiefs of the individual services -- with substantially more power than it has assumed in recent years . Until this year , for example , the Joint Requirements and Oversight Council was a low-profile advisory_board that mainly rubber-stamped the services ' proposals . The military has begun moving toward more and more joint operations in recent years , under which units from all four services are assigned to a single commander , who is empowered to order them into combat without going_through each services ' chief_of_staff . But the services still act independently in planning their weapons purchases , budgets and individual doctrine .</TEXT>
