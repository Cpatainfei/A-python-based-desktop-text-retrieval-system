   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON RUSSIA ; ' AID ' THAT LINES THE GIVERS ' COFFERS ; WE ' RE SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING RUSSIANS HELP THEMSELVES , NOT PAYING BIG FEES TO U.S. FIRMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Boris Yeltsin arrives in Washington this week after considerable behind-the-scenes debate in the Clinton_Administration about U.S. aid policy to Russia and the other states of the former Soviet_Union . The State_Department has decided to shift the focus of U.S. aid from technical assistance aimed at improving the investment climate in Russia to , in_essence , subsidization of U.S. trade and investment . Such a shift is a serious mistake . The State_Department ' s coordinator for assistance to the newly independent states , Ambassador Thomas Simons , strongly pushed for an expanded role for our Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private Investment Corp . Another major beneficiary from the change in policy is the U.S. Trade and Development Agency , an independent government_agency that provides funding through non-reimbursable grants to American firms for feasibility studies overseas . Not surprisingly , the Trade and Development Agency is popular in the House and Senate as a means to funnel assistance to corporations in members ' districts . At a time when legislative pork-barreling is under_attack , this agency merits serious scrutiny . Since late 1991 , the trade agency has also been in the business of doling out aid money intended to help reform in Russia and the other states of the former Soviet_Union . But instead of helping to promote economic development in Russia , the agency is subsidizing feasibility studies for companies interested in exploring business opportunities there . This is not the way to help the Russians help themselves . In July , the agency awarded 19 economic assistance grants that &quot; will strengthen the commercial ties between the United States and Russia , &quot; according to an agency press_release . A look_at the awards , however , reveals that the only &quot; strengthening &quot; being done is in American corporate coffers -- at U.S. taxpayer expense and at the expense of effective aid to the newly independent states . The 19 grants provide $ 6 million in &quot; feasibility study funding &quot; for a wide range of projects . A number of the companies involved have already established a presence in Russia . Moreover , one would think that General Electric , with revenues of $ 62.2 billion last year , Owens Corning ( $ 2.9 billion ) or Marriott International ( $ 8.7 billion ) could afford feasibility studies in Russia on_their_own without U.S._government support . Marriott International , for example , will receive $ 435 # 000 from the trade agency for a study on construction of a Marriott hotel to replace an Intourist hotel in downtown Moscow . Spending U.S. taxpayer dollars on such a study is truly difficult to justify . The trade agency says that it must play a &quot; facilitative role &quot; in selecting grantees , or the &quot; project would not move forward. &quot; It is hard to imagine that a General Electric study on co-production of large gas_turbines in St . Petersburg would have collapsed without $ 600 # 000 in trade-agency support . Since reform in Russia was launched in 1992 , Western governments and international lending agencies have been urging the Yeltsin administration to reduce state subsidies to enterprises . Successful transformation from a centrally planned system to a market_economy , after all , requires an end to the reliance of plants and factories on government funding . Yet contrary to the advice it is giving Russia , the U.S._government is bolstering its role in American firms ' trade and investment efforts . &quot; Russian authorities are used to dealing with foreign partners on a government-to-government basis , &quot; said Daniel Stein , the trade agency ' s regional director for the newly independent states , in Senate testimony last year . U.S. competitors , he said , &quot; often have the direct or indirect support of their governments . . . . Not only does this give our competitors a clear financial advantage , it also raises their profile in the eyes of their ( newly independent state ) partners because of the active support and participation of their respective governments . ( The trade agency ) is in a unique position to help American companies overcome some of these barriers. &quot; Instead of downplaying the state ' s role , the Clinton_Administration has decided to get the U.S._government more involved to try to &quot; even the playing field. &quot; Such involvement perpetuates , even increases , both the Russian and American governments ' roles in what should be private-sector activity . Shifting even more resources to the trade agency , as advocated by the State_Department , clearly sends the wrong signal to Moscow . Doing business in Russia and the other states of the former Soviet_Union is not for the faint of heart , and foreign business_activity will not pick_up unless the investment climate there improves . For the Russians , this means creating a simpler , less burdensome tax structure for foreign ventures and clearer investment legislation . &quot; ( The Trade and Development Agency ) provides an incentive for U.S. companies that are interested in developing business in Russia , but are unwilling to assume all_of the inherent political and economic risks , &quot; Stein testified last year . &quot; Despite the opportunities in the ( newly independent states ) , many U.S. companies remain hesitant to commit their own resources to developing the market . . . . There are many less risky places to do business. &quot; Yet the trade agency puts U.S. tax dollars at risk to fund feasibility studies -- through non-reimbursable grants , no less -- because corporations are reluctant to do risk their own money . The U.S._government , Stein testified , &quot; has a broader strategic interest in promoting U.S. private-sector involvement &quot; in these countries . The trade agency is surely a poor way to accomplish that goal .</TEXT>
