   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; MASTER OF FIDONET ' S BBS LINKUP SYSTEM CHAMPIONS FREEDOM OF ELECTRONIC MAIL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you think Fido is just an unimaginative name for a dog , you haven ' t been spending enough time in cyberspace . FidoNet is a clever way of linking local computer bulletin_boards , the increasingly popular services that allow people with common interests to exchange electronic messages and access other information via their personal_computers . With FidoNet , electronic messages can hop from one small bulletin_board service ( BBS ) to another . The system spans the country , allowing a message to pass coast-to-coast for the cost of a local telephone_call . FidoNet has thus harnessed the communal leanings of many BBS operators , establishing a kind of poor_man ' s Internet . Today there are approximately 34 # 000 FidoNet &quot; nodes &quot; -- bulletin_boards that use Fido protocols and agree to relay information -- with coverage around the globe . To keep_up with developments , there is a FidoNet newsletter and even an electronic discussion group on the Internet comp.org.fidonet. This year is the 10th anniversary of Fido , which started_out as a software program for operating one of the original computer bulletin_boards . Its creator , Tom Jennings , basically gave_away the program as part of his philosophy of &quot; radical communications. &quot; We spoke with Jennings in his office in San Francisco . * Q : Tell me about the beginnings of Fido . * A : I went_through 12 major revisions ( of the software ) and hundreds of minor ones . At that time , my friend Randy Bush up in Portland , Ore. , documented the FidoNet protocols . We wanted to make them more public . A couple of people started to write clones . It ' s sort of amusing to note that two of the first three authors were gay troublemaker types . Sort of set a lot of the tone for FidoNet stuff . * Q : How would you say that affected FidoNet ? * A : I am not going_to trust my neighbors for my ability to communicate . If your neighbors don ' t like you , they can shun you and you disappear . That is how gay people and other people who are deemed to be undesirable are basically shunned out of existence . In FidoNet , the ability to communicate is a physical_ability to communicate . You can ' t shut someone up . that ' s the beauty of it . It was designed that way . I can set_up a bulletin_board at my house for instance , and you cannot stop me from sending mail -- short of knocking my door down . * Q : You call yourself a &quot; radical troublemaker. &quot; What kind of trouble do you make ? * A : Just making_sure that everyone can communicate . I had the honor , as I call it , of defending this quite rabid , quite idiotic fundamentalist Christian nut case . He was writing these really poorly written articles in the FidoNet newsletter . They just weren ' t coherent and legible -- it didn ' t have anything to do with content . He was so hate-filled and so troublemaking that he was being kicked_out of the networks and they were trying to refuse to run his stuff . As editor , we had these rules : If it fits various physical and legal criteria , it will run . Regardless of content . Regardless of how infuriating it is . * Q : How did_it feel being in that position ? * A : I thought it was hilariously funny . I mean , the guy infuriated me to no end . But at some point he became so extreme that it was kind of hard to take him very seriously . Censorship is never good . I don ' t think any speech or any information should ever be suppressed for any reason whatsoever . * Q : Does FidoNet then provide something that the other networks don ' t ? * A : First of all , it ' s providing connectivity . Most of the planet simply can ' t afford direct connections to the Internet ( the massive &quot; network of networks &quot; originally funded by the federal_government to connect universities and government research laboratories ) . It ' s exceedingly complex . It ' s really nice but it ain ' t cheap . It takes a whole_lot of infrastructure . If you do stuff that ' s unpopular , you ' ll find that your hosts don ' t really want to carry you . * Q : Do you think FidoNet has engendered more open communication ? * A : There ' s still a great hump to get_over : the ability to spend $ 1 # 000 or whatever on a computer and a modem and a phone_line and to be able to buy your own time to use it . Just 1 % of the planet has ( such resources ) . * Q : So you ' re saying that access to technology is the issue ? * A : The only thing that always bothers me about media coverage ( of technology and communications ) in_general is that it says , &quot; One day we ' ll all have this , and it ' s all great , &quot; and it is great to various degrees . But the access issue is really a big deal . It ' s a big party spoiler . You drag it out and people go , &quot; Oh , well that ' s no fun to talk about. &quot; Because it ' s not any fun to talk_about . It ' s expensive . It ' s also wrapped around this really normal white culture thing that ' s oppressive in its very nature to a lot of people . * Q : How do you mean it ' s wrapped around that ? * A : I mean right down to every paradigm in e-mail ever done : Messages look_like interoffice memos , files_in file_cabinets on desktops . What level do you want to start at ? * Q : Do you view technology as neutral ? * A : No . I would n ' t call it neutral -- neutral is not the right word . Neutral implies it ' s benign . It ' s like a knife : It has two edges . Its position changes where you ' re looking , how you ' re looking , who you are , what side of the knife you ' re on . It ' s got good aspects . Some things , like telephones , you could say are a good thing . Hopefully networking will end_up being so . Whatever form it actually takes , it certainly won ' t be e-mail in front of a screen and a keyboard . * Q : What ' s the best thing about networking for you ? * A : It ' s a big intellectual thrill of this giant bunch of machinery doing basically indeterminate things . It ' s cool that Cambridge , England , is 15 milliseconds away . It has become a giant machine that covers the planet . * Q : What ' s the future of FidoNet ? * A : I have no idea . Things come and go ; I doubt it ' ll have a cataclysmic ending . It ' ll probably just mutate into something else . Biobox * Name : Tom Jennings * Position : Founder , FidoNet * Age : 38 * Self-description : &quot; Radical troublemaker &quot; * Company : The Little Garden ( provides electronic_mail connections between local bulletin_board services ; company was named after the restaurant where the business was conceived ) * Education : Franklin High_School , Franklin , Mass . * When not computing : Travels in his 30-year-old propane-powered Rambler .</TEXT>
