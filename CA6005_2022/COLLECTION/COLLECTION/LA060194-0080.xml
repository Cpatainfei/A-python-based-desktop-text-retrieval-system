   <HEADLINE> 2 DISTRICTS SIGN_UP FOR FREE MEALS FOR YOUTHS ; SCHOOLS : VENTURA AND OCEAN VIEW HAVE APPLIED TO THE FEDERAL PROJECT , WHICH SERVES NEEDY STUDENTS OVER THE SUMMER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Concerned that needy children are going hungry during the summer , the Ventura and Ocean View school districts have signed_up for a federal program to serve free lunches to students while they are out of school . But federal_officials say many Ventura County students still go hungry because not enough local agencies have stepped_up to run summer food programs . The Santa Paula and Fillmore school districts , the Ventura County superintendent of schools ' migrant education program and California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks already serve federally funded free lunches to 1 # 800 needy children each summer . School officials in Ventura and the Ocean View district in Oxnard said they expect to provide meals to an additional 1 # 100 children , bringing the total in the county to about 2 # 900 . But federal_officials say there are 36 # 674 school-age children who qualify during the school_year for free or reduced-price lunches , which is the criteria for students to receive the summer meals . That means that Ventura County is providing the free summer meals to only 7.9 % of the children who are eligible , slightly trailing the statewide average of 8 % . &quot; We need more school districts , we need more public and private agencies &quot; willing to sponsor the food program , said Cleophus Davis , western regional director of the summer feeding program for the U . S . Department_of_Agriculture . &quot; The same children who are eligible for free and reduced meals during the year are no less hungry when school is out. &quot; The Department_of_Agriculture launched the summer food program in the late 1960s as an extension of the federal free-and-reduced lunch program . Although the federal_government reimburses agencies $ 2.28 for each meal served , the program sponsors must operate efficiently enough not to spend more_than they receive . &quot; With prudent management , you can break_even , &quot; Davis said . Despite the promise of reimbursement , some county school districts with high numbers of needy children have never applied for the federal program . In the Oxnard Elementary School District , for example , all but 1 # 500 of the 7 # 500 students who eat cafeteria lunches would qualify for free lunches in the summer . Oxnard school officials said they have considered the program but are looking_for local clubs or community sites where the meals could be served . In the Ventura Unified School District , the meals will be prepared at school cafeterias but served at community_centers and Boys &amp; Girls Clubs in areas with high numbers of needy families . &quot; Those areas that we ' re serving , they ' re all considered a high-need area , &quot; said Edward Diaz , the district ' s food services director . &quot; If we don ' t feed those kids a lunch , many of them will not get a lunch. &quot; The lunches will consist_of the usual school fare . On June 20 , the first day of Ventura ' s summer lunch program , the menu calls_for pizza , fresh fruit , tossed salad and milk . Although such nutritionally balanced meals may generate less excitement in children than , say , a trip to McDonald ' s , Ventura school officials said they expect up_to 1 # 000 children to take_advantage of the free meals each day . In Santa Paula , where the elementary_school district launched the program just last summer , organizers said they served an average of 581 lunches per day . The county ' s program for children of migrant workers feeds about 500 students daily during the summer . The Fillmore Unified School District provides the free summer lunches to about 542 children each day . The Cal Lutheran Upward Bound program serves the meals to 40 students daily , and the Ocean View district estimates that it will provide lunches to about 90 students . Even though the federal program is intended only for children from low-income families , students are not asked to present identification or proof that they qualify , organizers said . Only people who are clearly over 18 years of_age are turned_away . Organizers of the Santa Paula summer lunch program said they refused meals to some homeless adults last summer . But school officials said they still served far more lunches each day than they had anticipated : On some days , nearly 800 children showed_up for the free meals . Many of the children come from homes where both parents work long hours to support their families , leaving the youngsters to fend_for themselves during the day . &quot; We were really surprised at the turnout , &quot; said Sandy Cortinas , assistant food services director for the Santa Paula Elementary School District . &quot; A lot of these kids really needed a lunch. &quot; FYI The Ventura Unified School District will begin providing free lunches June 20 at the following locations : Westpark Recreation Center , 450 W . Harrison St. ; Cabrillo Village Community_Center , in Cabrillo Village off of Saticoy Avenue ; the Boys &amp; Girls Club , 1440 N . Olive St. , and the Boys &amp; Girls Club , 1929 Johnson Drive .
