   <HEADLINE> BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS : COMMITTED TO HELPING YOUNG STUDENTS REWRITE FUTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Laguna Niguel author Nancy Taylor Rosenberg began sponsoring a writing contest at Willard Intermediate School last year , she couldn ' t believe the caliber of one student ' s writing . &quot; It was so sophisticated , I just couldn ' t imagine a 12-year-old from this middle_school in Santa Ana came_up with this , &quot; said Rosenberg , the best-selling author of the legal thrillers &quot; Mitigating Circumstances &quot; and &quot; Interest of Justice. &quot; Rosenberg was so surprised by the sophistication of Andrew Albers ' entry , she is now embarrassed to say , that she indicated in a letter accompanying the boy ' s honorable_mention certificate that she thought he may have copied his story about Japanese samurai from another source . So this year , the seventh-grader took no chances in having his writing called into question : His 30-page , single-spaced entry included a cover letter with not only his teacher ' s signature but those of fellow students verifying that the story is indeed all his . And this time Rosenberg was even more floored by the quality of Andrew ' s entry , a fact-based story about a Russian man who -- a la &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; -- saved the lives of Jews during World_War_II . &quot; He ' s brilliant , &quot; raves Rosenberg , praising the boy ' s polished prose , vocabulary and grasp of his story , which was written like a novel . &quot; It ' s obvious that what we have is a 12-year-old novelist who one day may be a major novelist. &quot; Andrew , now 13 , took the top honor at the contest awards ceremony last week . When Rosenberg announced his name -- and those of second- and third-place winners Billy Rowley and Nga Ta -- the throng of students seated on the floor of the school assembly room burst into loud choruses of cheers and applause . It was the sort of recognition usually reserved for victorious athletes , and that ' s the point of the contest : to offer writers as enviable role_models and to encourage students to write . &quot; I think it ' s good that we ' re trying to say that potential scholars or potential artists are just as important to society as super athletes are , &quot; said Rosenberg , 47 . In a city where the allure -- and threat -- of gangs is all too real , Rosenberg , a former police_officer and probation_officer , says writing is a way for young people to vent their feelings and frustrations without resorting_to violence . &quot; Some of the kids that are involved in gangs are real talented , &quot; she said , adding that &quot; writing is a wonderful thing because they can use their imagination and release their hostilities. &quot; Middle_school students are being targeted , she said , &quot; because we think they ' re at the age where we think we can reach them . It ' s not too late , so to speak. &quot; The goal of the contest is to help teach them communication skills first , Rosenberg said , but she has a larger goal in mind . &quot; When I was growing_up I was a little bit different , I think , because I had a creative personality . I was a loner and felt I didn ' t fit_in , and I used my writing to deal with the frustrations in life even when I was very young , &quot; Rosenberg said . &quot; I ' m trying to teach these kids who grow_up with tremendous frustrations and fears that they don ' t have to resort_to violence . I tell them , ' Let ' s deal with those things on paper , and if you don ' t like your world you can create your own world ' &quot; on paper . The writing contest grew out of an adopt-a-school program at Shir Ha-Ma ' alot Harbor Reform Temple in Newport Beach . Rabbi Bernard King said he proposed the program to his congregation as a way to make a &quot; bridge &quot; between Orange County communities such_as Newport Beach and Santa Ana . As he told the youngsters at the ceremony : &quot; I thought schools are a great way for us to get_to know each other. &quot; Rosenberg is one of dozens of temple members who have since gone_to the school to discuss their professions with the students and to serve as mentors . From the start , Rosenberg had one goal : &quot; to reach the children and provide some sort of emotional connection so that they can feel that I ' m their friend -- to be a role_model and show that you can succeed if you really work hard. &quot; As she did last year , Rosenberg kicked_off the contest by speaking at an assembly in which she told her rags-to-riches story ( she recently received a multimillion-dollar , multiple book contract ) and how , as a child , she she used writing to help deal with the emotional trauma of being sexually abused . &quot; It ' s extremely inspiring , &quot; said King ' s wife , Barbara , who teaches at Willard . &quot; They get very excited when they know she ' s coming . Nancy is very real , so when she talks to the kids she just puts everything out_to them. &quot; Rosenberg has only one requirement for the contest : that the students write at least 1 # 000 words , enough so &quot; they get the feeling of writing . I tell them they can use any kind of language . If I see a bad word I ' m not going_to faint . I tell them I want them to use their own voices. &quot; The more_than 50 youngsters who entered the contest this year ranged from those in the gifted student program to those with limited English proficiency . Entries ranged from Nga Ta ' s story of girl who is beaten and raped by her boyfriend to Billy Rowley ' s fictionalized account of a Civil War battle . Other entries dealt with abusive family situations , anorexia and gangs . &quot; They tap into what they see going_around them , &quot; Rosenberg said . In addition to three top winners , who received cash prizes of $ 100 , $ 50 and $ 25 , 12 students received honorable_mentions . But even those who didn ' t win were presented with a certificate of participation , a long-stemmed carnation and a copy of a six-page letter from Rosenberg urging them to be relentless in pursuing their goals and reminding them that they are responsible_for their futures regardless of their environment . Rosenberg also encouraged the students at the assembly &quot; to keep ( the contest ) in mind and over the summer do more reading , do more writing , expand the stories you submitted this year. &quot; And there ' s an added incentive for shooting_for the top . Rosenberg said she has made a commitment to be their mentor for life . &quot; As long as they write , I ' m going_to help them , advise them , read their work and help them get_into print and guide their career. &quot; In Andrew ' s case , Rosenberg has already shown her editor at Dutton a copy of his entry . &quot; She was very impressed by what she saw , &quot; said Rosenberg , who plans to help nurture Andrews ' writing and believes that if he works hard at it that by the time he ' s 20 &quot; he could be a respected novelist . &quot; What I ' m trying to say is I have all these resources to help these kids -- agents , publishers -- people that will listen . If I bring them along and get them working toward it , I can get them into print . So it ' s not like they ' re just writing blind , working and working and nothing will ever come of it. &quot; Barbara King said Rosenberg has given many students hope . &quot; Some of the students ( already ) thought that they were writers , &quot; she said , &quot; but they just weren ' t sure they were good_enough , and she just really inspired them . She said , ' You can do_it ; anybody can write. ' She tells them it doesn ' t matter if you have grammatical mistakes ; it ' s strictly , ' Go_out there and express yourself. ' &quot; Rosenberg proved to be an inspiration for third-place winner Nga Ta , who hadn ' t done any writing except for classroom assignments before entering the contest and winning a second-place award last year . &quot; Before , I used to think I had nothing going_for me and nothing to look_forward to , &quot; she said , &quot; but now ( the contest ) really makes me feel_like I ' m good at something. &quot; Even Andrew , who says he has been writing since he learned to read and thinks becoming a novelist &quot; would be a great idea , &quot; was inspired by the contest : &quot; I really love it , &quot; he said . &quot; I mean , wow , I make some money , get_to write : two of my favorite things. &quot; Rosenberg , who often travels around the country promoting her books , said she usually finds herself talking more about the writing contest than the books she ' s there to promote . In July , she ' ll be discussing the writing contest at a regional law_enforcement conference in Tennessee . &quot; This is where my heart is , &quot; she said . &quot; If we can get these mentoring programs off the ground , we can make a difference. &quot;</TEXT>
