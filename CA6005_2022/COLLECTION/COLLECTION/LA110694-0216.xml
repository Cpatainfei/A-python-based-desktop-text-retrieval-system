   <HEADLINE> LONG-TERM SURVIVORS OFFER CLUES TO CANCER THERAPIES ; MEDICINE : AT LEAST 50 % OF PATIENTS WITH THE DISEASE WILL BE CURED . SCIENTISTS ARE ASKING WHY SOME BEAT THE ODDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Make the next six months the best of your life , &quot; the doctor told Jerilyn Ross . It was August , 1979 . Ross , 33 , had just learned the grim news : Cancer_cells from a malignant_melanoma surgically removed seven months earlier had migrated to a lymph_node under her arm . Her doctors were pessimistic . Melanoma , a skin_cancer that often starts as a black mole , does not respond to drugs or radiation , and can be deadly once it spreads . More_than 15 years later -- and about to celebrate her 48th birthday -- Ross is cancer-free . In 1974 , Natalie Spingarn , 52 , was diagnosed with breast_cancer . By 1977 , it had metastasized , or spread , to her spine . By 1979 , it was in her bones . In 1982 , she developed cancer in the other breast . &quot; You have one year , maybe two , &quot; her doctor told her in 1982 . Twelve years later -- and 20 years after her initial diagnosis -- she is still going strong . An estimated 8 million Americans have survived cancer , and at least 50 % of those who develop the disease will be cured . To be sure , most of these are people in whom the cancer is detected early . Stories of spontaneous remission are extremely rare , and cases of long-term survival after metastasis also are much less common . Nevertheless , they exist . The question is , why ? Why do some people beat the odds while others with similar medical profiles succumb ? In recent years , scientists have begun paying greater attention to the question , believing the answers could provide valuable insights into the body ' s response to cancer -- and to cancer therapies -- and help lead to new approaches to fighting the disease . &quot; There are some very interesting clues that come_out of chance observations in medicine , particularly from these long-term survivors who have beaten the odds , &quot; said Dr. Harmon Eyre , an oncologist who is chief medical_officer for the American Cancer Society . &quot; They should never be overlooked. &quot; Scientists now are examining all_of these questions in trying to design strategies against a disease that is the second-leading cause of death among Americans -- after heart_disease -- but probably the one dreaded the most . The field &quot; is exploding , &quot; said Dr. Steven A . Rosenberg , a National Cancer Institute researcher who has devoted virtually his entire career to seeking ways to use and strengthen the body ' s own defenses against cancer . &quot; I think it ' s become one of the most exciting areas in cancer research. &quot; In some of these success stories , the reason for a good outcome could be as basic as the skill of the medical team -- the surgeon who operates , the chemotherapist who calculates the doses of drugs and administers them or the radiologist who delivers the radiation . It could also depend_on the destination sites of metastasized cells -- if they spread to the bones , for example , an individual can live for many years with cancer ; if they end_up in vital_organs , death can be swift . But some of the answers also may be found in the complexities of the body ' s genetic makeup or its immune_system -- that is , how the body ' s defenses respond to the presence of alien cells . Or answers may come from how the body tolerates chemotherapy ; doses can be made strong enough to kill tumors if the patient can withstand the onslaught of a drug ' s often-toxic side_effects . &quot; There is a subset of people who have an unusually good response under usually unfavorable circumstances , &quot; said Dr. Sam Broder , NCI director . As to why this happens , &quot; it ' s a complicated question , &quot; Broder said . &quot; Experts have postulated that some have better immune_systems that can synergize with the chemotherapy or hormones that are used . Or that they are resistant to ( drug ) side_effects . Or , by the luck of the draw , the tumor is just unusually sensitive to the ( drug ) agents . . . . Every person ' s response is variable. &quot; But , he adds in a note of caution , &quot; the biologies of different cancers are different . A diagnosis of lung or pancreatic_cancer is a very bad diagnosis . It is important to have no illusions about this . Basically there are certain cancers that are very difficult -- or impossible -- to treat. &quot; Lately , a growing emphasis has been placed on trying to home_in on the various ways in which the body naturally responds to cancer and in seeking ways to strengthen those responses . Most researchers believe that the body almost always tries to mount some kind of a response , but the battle often typically favors the cancer . In recent years , scientific and medical journals periodically have reported research that reveals intriguing clues about the body ' s relationship to the onset and spread of cancer . Late last month , for example , Dr. Michael O ' Reilly and Dr. Judah Volkman , researchers at Children ' s Hospital in Boston , announced they had identified a hormone-like factor_in animals that appears to check the growth of secondary tumors formed by metastasizing cells , often the tumors that ultimately cause death . They have also found preliminary evidence that this chemical exists in humans . The substance , called angiostatin , apparently is a natural drug that circulates in the bloodstream after being produced by large primary growing tumors , such_as those in the breast and colon . The hormone is apparently one of the body ' s defenses against a tumor spreading , and it appears to slow the growth of blood_vessels to secondary tumors . Cancer experts say they hope the newly discovered substance -- if it can be produced through biotechnology -- can be used to help the body ' s chances in this battle . &quot; If cancers don ' t grow beyond a millimeter in size , they won ' t kill you -- and to grow , they need blood_vessels , &quot; Eyre said . &quot; Find a way to block the vessels , and people could live with cancer for many years. &quot; Rosenberg has also searched for years for evidence of the body ' s natural_ability to fight cancer . He became hooked on the approach in 1968 after encountering a patient whose stomach cancer apparently had disappeared spontaneously a dozen years earlier . In 1956 , the Massachusetts man had received a hopeless prognosis : He would die within several months from an untreatable gastric tumor . When Rosenberg found him alive years later , he at first was convinced there had been some mistake , a misdiagnosis perhaps . But a scrutiny of the patient ' s records proved there had been no mistake . The man ' s cancer had simply vanished on its own . The man ' s body had cured its cancer . But how ? Transfusing the man ' s blood into another dying cancer patient failed , but it set Rosenberg on a quest to determine ways in which the body ' s immune_system could be harnessed in the cancer battle . He and his colleagues at the NCI have spent most of the last decade studying the body ' s immune_response to melanoma and kidney cancer , two malignancies long recognized as highly responsive to immunogenic factors . Rosenberg has treated more_than 1 # 200 patients with several different kinds of experimental immune-based therapies , with a mixed success rate . About one-third of the melanoma patients showed tumor shrinkage . And about 10 % of all_the patients treated -- most of them individuals who likely would have died within several months -- have experienced long-term remissions . &quot; When you get a long-term response like that , the chances are very high it ( cancer ) will never recur , &quot; he said . Because there have been some spectacular successes amid many failures , Rosenberg is also focusing_on trying to discover why some patients do not respond . If the answers are determined , he says , they could be used to alter or fine-tune the therapies . His early experiments involved doses of Interleukin-2 , a chemical produced by the immune_system that now can be mass-produced , and the use of lymphokine-activated killer ( LAK ) cells , another type of immune_system cell , in conjunction with IL-2 . Last spring , he and his NCI colleagues reported that they had identified a gene in normal cells that produces a protein capable of stimulating the body to defend against melanoma . This immune_response -- also discovered by Rosenberg in 1988 -- involves certain immune cells found in tumors , known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes , or TIL , that can attack and destroy tumor cells . He said he believes that the gene , known as MART-1 , or the protein itself could serve as the basis of a melanoma vaccine . Such a vaccine could be given to people who already have the disease , or , eventually , even to those identified to be at risk . The beauty of such an approach , he says , is that therapy directed against melanoma could cause minimal side_effects because skin pigment cells are not necessary for any life function . In yet another approach , researchers are studying genes in cancer_cells to try to pinpoint how and where a cancer will spread . How a cancer spreads is considered critical to a patient ' s prognosis . &quot; We know that cancers vary greatly in their metastatic potential and growth_rate , and we know this is under_control of the genes in the cancer_cells themselves , &quot; he said . &quot; We know that it takes a whole series of mutations in the genes in_order for a full-fledged cancer to develop . Some of these mutations will determine how aggressively it spreads , and where it goes. &quot; For some types of cancer -- breast_cancer , for example -- there are several generally recognized patterns of spread , he says . &quot; The first is a local recurrence in the same breast , &quot; he said . &quot; A second is spread to the bones and not much elsewhere . A third involves visceral organs like the liver and the lungs , in which case , it tends to be rapidly fatal. &quot; Determining the mechanism possibly could yield a way to predict the route of the cancer or even to manipulate the spread to make_it less deadly . With cancer , &quot; the fact that there are long-term survivors , particularly in circumstances where the outcome would not typically be considered favorable , should be stimulus for further research -- and should provide some measure of optimism , &quot; Broder said .</TEXT>
