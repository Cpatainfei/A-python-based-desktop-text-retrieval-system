   <HEADLINE> STATE BALLOT DRIVE TARGETS LOCAL NO-SMOKING LAWS ; INITIATIVE : MEASURE SUPPORTED BY PHILIP MORRIS AND SOME RESTAURANT OWNERS WOULD INVALIDATE BANS IN ORANGE COUNTY , CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND OTHER PLACES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Philip Morris U.S.A. , the nation ' s largest cigarette manufacturer , and some Los Angeles area restaurants plan to sponsor a November ballot initiative that would abolish local anti-smoking ordinances in California , The Times learned Monday . The initiative , called the California Uniform Tobacco Control Act , would place the responsibility for regulating smoking in the hands of the Legislature , and invalidate smoking bans in Los Angeles , Orange County and more_than 100 other cities and counties . The tobacco_industry long has sought a statewide smoking standard , ending the authority of cities and counties to regulate smoking . Lee Stitzenberger of the Dolphin Group , a Los Angeles political consulting firm , said his firm had been hired to qualify the measure for the ballot and he expects to have a $ 1-million budget . &quot; I have every indication that Philip Morris will be a player , &quot; Stitzenberger said . The proposed initiative is similar to legislation supported by the tobacco_industry and carried last year by Assemblyman Curtis Tucker ( D-Inglewood ) . That bill , which stalled in the state Senate , also sought to preempt local_government from regulating smoking and impose statewide regulations looser than those adopted by many localities . Opponents of the tobacco measure met Monday in an attempt to come_up with a strategy for battling it . Chances are slim that they would have time to raise the money necessary to place a countermeasure on the November ballot . &quot; It ' s outrageous , &quot; Tony Najera of the American Lung Assn . of California said after reading the proposed initiative . &quot; I have all_the confidence that the voters will not be fooled by the desperate tactics of the tobacco industry. &quot; In documents filed last week with the state_attorney general , the proponent of the Uniform Tobacco Control Act is listed as Donna Maret-Fahrenholtz , a restaurant owner in Playa del Rey . Maret-Fahrenholtz , who could not be reached , has been involved in fights against local smoking bans . Stitzenberger said he expects to receive donations from Los Angeles restaurant owners opposed to Los Angeles ' smoking ban , and from a group of small restaurant and bar owners known as the California Business and Restaurant Assn . The California Restaurant Assn. , the state ' s largest restaurant association , has called_for a statewide smoking ban and is likely to oppose the initiative . A veteran consultant involved in the initiative industry said other tobacco companies and the industry-funded Tobacco Institute are not involved . &quot; There is no other company involved with this &quot; other_than Philip Morris , said the consultant , who asked to remain anonymous . Representatives of Philip Morris U.S.A. , the tobacco arm of the food and tobacco conglomerate , did not return phone_calls . Under the initiative , the Legislature would need a two-thirds vote to make any changes in smoking laws . Tobacco_industry lobbyists are influential in Sacramento and cigarette manufacturers are heavy contributors to legislative races . More_than 100 cities and counties in California have banned smoking in restaurants and at least 70 have prohibited smoking in all enclosed workplaces . Recently , the Orange County Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance that will prohibit smoking in restaurants , retail_stores and businesses in unincorporated areas by 1995 . And many of the county ' s cities , including Anaheim , Santa Ana , San Juan Capistrano , Seal Beach , Laguna Hills and Huntington Beach , have passed ordinances restricting smoking . The proposed initiative would permit smoking in 25 % of the dining_area of restaurants so_long as they provide ventilation set_forth in the initiative . The ventilation standards listed in the initiative are not designed to protect against the ill effects of second-hand smoke . The measure also would permit smoking in bars , private offices , ventilated conference_rooms , 25 % of the seating_areas in employee cafeterias , designated smoking lounges in workplaces , portions of bowling allies , hotel lobbies and conference_rooms , card clubs and racetracks . The measure would permit business and restaurant owners to ban smoking in their establishments . The attorney_general has 45 days to analyze the initiative , write a summary and give the measure a title . Once the measure has a title and summary , the proponents can begin gathering signatures . The Dolphin Group will have to rush to get the measure on the ballot because the secretary_of_state suggests that signatures for a measure headed for the November ballot be submitted by April 22 . The measure needs 385 # 000 valid signatures of registered voters , and Stitzenberger said he is negotiating with the two major California firms that gather petition signatures . &quot; We ' d have to be very lucky to make the ' 94 ballot , &quot; Stitzenberger said . If the initiative does not qualify this year , he said , his company will attempt to place the measure on a 1996 ballot . He said the politically influential Sacramento law_firm of Nielsen &amp; Merksamer , which represents Gov . Pete Wilson , wrote the measure . Wilson ' s campaign staff was unaware of the planned initiative . Stitzenberger said the initiative would clarify the situation in which individual cities and counties have created a complicated &quot; patchwork quilt. &quot; &quot; There is no level playing_field &quot; for businesses , he said . Once the measure is_on the ballot , Stitzenberger said he believes he will obtain campaign money from the organizations that supported Tucker ' s bill , including the California Hotel and Motel Assn. , California Manufacturers Assn. , and perhaps the state Chamber_of_Commerce . &quot; This is a brutal assault on local control , &quot; said Assemblyman Terry Friedman ( D-Brentwood ) , who carried a bill last year to ban smoking in virtually all indoor workplaces but was stalled in the Senate . &quot; This would be a huge retreat just at a time when the evidence is overwhelming that secondhand smoke kills. &quot; Times staff writer Matt Lait contributed to this story .</TEXT>
