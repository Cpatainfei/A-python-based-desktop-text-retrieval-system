   <HEADLINE> BROAD U.S. PLAN TO CLEAN_UP AIR IN L.A. AREA UNVEILED ; POLLUTION : ADMINISTRATION BLUEPRINT WOULD TARGET SHIPS AND ALL COMMERCIAL AIRLINES FOR THE FIRST TIME . THE EPA WILL HOLD PUBLIC_DEBATE ON THE PROPOSED RULES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a sweeping strategy that moves further to clean_up California ' s smoggiest cities than ever before , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday revealed almost 100 clean-air measures it plans to mandate for the Los Angeles Basin , Sacramento and Ventura County over the next decade . The long-awaited plan -- prompted by a court_order -- is the Clinton_Administration ' s version of what bold and sometimes painful steps must be taken_to bring healthful air to the four-county Los Angeles region by 2010 and to Ventura County and the Sacramento area by 2005 . In a 2 # 700-page array of highly detailed federal proposals , virtually every source of pollution is targeted : cars , trains , airlines , ships and trucks . Lawn_mowers , tractors , recreational_vehicles and motorcycles . Large factories and small businesses . Paints and pesticides . In all , the proposed rules encompass 15 million people -- half of California ' s population -- who are exposed to the nation ' s dirtiest air . &quot; We ' re going to have a complicated web of strategies that affect truly every aspect of life here in California . You put all that together and it ' s a pretty enormous impact on the region , &quot; said Robert Wyman , a Los Angeles attorney who represents a variety of oil_companies , utilities , aerospace firms , chemical plants and engine manufacturers on air quality issues . It is the first time the EPA has stepped squarely into the quagmire of identifying ways to clean_up California ' s air . The EPA , however , is proposing the rules only under duress , after losing in a 10-year legal odyssey . The lawsuit was initiated by Los Angeles-area environmentalists to force the EPA to step_in when local air quality regulators failed to comply with the 1977 federal Clean Air Act . While a majority of the EPA ' s blueprint is fundamentally the same as measures already under development by local and state officials , some are new and highly controversial . Most notably , sources of pollution that have never before been targeted would be regulated , including all commercial airlines , ships that dock at the Los Angeles and Long_Beach ports , recreational boats and passenger and freight_trains . Since the federal_government has sole control over many pollution sources , the clean-air plan is the most comprehensive one to emerge during the two decades that the Los Angeles Basin has struggled to comply with the nation ' s clean-air laws . EPA Administrator Carol Browner signed the proposed rules Monday night , and the agency has kicked_off six months of public_debate , including a long series of forums in California this spring and hearings scheduled for July . Under the terms of a court_order , the EPA must adopt final regulations within one year , and the agency must enforce the provisions or be vulnerable to more lawsuits . &quot; This is the end of the line , &quot; Felicia Marcus , the EPA ' s western regional administrator , said Tuesday . &quot; We are under obligation to not just come_up with a plan , but all_the regulations , the whole program , as opposed to being theoretical . What you have here for the first time is an overall comprehensive picture of what it will take_to give California clean air. &quot; Officials at the South Coast Air Quality Management District and state Air Resources Board -- who are under increasing pressure from the business_community to scale back anti-smog rules -- said they welcome the federal help . For years , they have urged aggressive action from the EPA in regulating sources such_as airliners that only the federal_government can control . &quot; I hope , &quot; said James Lents , the AQMD ' s executive_officer , &quot; that it at least sends a signal that what we ' re trying to do here in cleaning the air is driven by federal law. &quot; In its plan , the federal agency avoided measures considered Draconian that it once had threatened to impose on the Los Angeles region , such_as gasoline rationing , no-driving days for motorists and taxes_based on miles driven . The plan also does not attempt to regulate California development , land use or population issues , and mostly avoids targeting consumers or motorists directly , saying such steps , if needed , should be undertaken by local and state officials . Instead , the Administration plan is a series of pollution fees and emissions standards for manufacturers and other businesses , including some novel approaches designed to give them an economic incentive to cut smog . &quot; Our ultimate goal is public health , and to try to minimize as much as we could the negative impact on the economy and the social fabric of all three areas , &quot; said David Howekamp , chief of air management at the EPA ' s regional office . &quot; These are very difficult measures . We ' ve stayed_away_from gasoline rationing and other measures that are not politically acceptable , but they will still be painful. &quot; In general , the EPA plan would cut smog-forming gases equally in all three metropolitan regions , at a price roughly estimated by the agency at $ 3 billion to $ 6 billion a year . Most of the economic burden would fall on the Los Angeles Basin -- Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside and San Bernardino counties , Howekamp said . Environmentalists were pleased Tuesday , mainly because they believe the proposed rules will gradually mean much cleaner cars , buses , trucks and planes in California . &quot; There ' s a lot of talk_about reinventing L.A. and if we are going_to reinvent L.A. -- and we should -- then one place we should start is a plan to clean_up our air , &quot; said Denny Zane of the Coalition for Clean Air , the Santa Monica-based environmental group whose lawsuit forced the EPA to develop the plan . Tom Soto , president of the Coalition for Clean Air , called the plan &quot; the most significant proposal on air quality since the adoption of the national Clean Air Act &quot; in 1990 . &quot; On the face of it , it looks very practical and even sort of soothing because it looks_like they are seeking integration with local policy . It seems consistent with the goals California already has_on the books , &quot; Soto said . Many business_leaders , however , say it would have a tremendous impact on all aspects of California ' s economy . They especially fear that proposed regulations on airlines , trucking and commercial ships would restrict interstate commerce and make California less competitive with other states . &quot; No one can mistake this as a halfhearted proposal , &quot; Wyman said , predicting a lively debate between regulated businesses and the EPA over the next six months . The airline industry in particular worries about the impact . Some airlines fear they can achieve the proposed pollution limits only by eliminating some flights in the three metropolitan areas -- especially in the Southland , where many airlines plan to expand . Under the proposal , each commercial airline would be allocated an annual pollution limit based on emissions from its planes and ground operations in 1990 . Starting in 2001 , each airline ' s pollution would have to drop 4 % to 9 % per year . Airlines could choose their own techniques , such_as converting baggage loaders and other ground service equipment to alternative fuels . &quot; We think in terms of transporting people and goods into and out of the Los Angeles area , we are already the most fuel efficient and cleanest form of transportation , &quot; said Chris Chiames of the Air Transport Assn . of America . &quot; There is a limit technologically speaking how much we can achieve , and then you run_into that wall of what is a safe operation of an airline. &quot; Another potentially controversial proposal is a fee on commercial ships that dock in Los Angeles and Long_Beach and another fee imposed on those passing within 20 miles of Ventura County ' s shoreline , which is the traditional route to Los Angeles . The size of the fee would be based on the amount of pollution each ship emits . Under a worst-case scenario , the fees could total about $ 16 # 000 each time a ship docks , the EPA says . In a defeat for the auto industry , the EPA endorsed the state ' s automobile standards , including one requiring 2 % of all cars sold in California beginning in 1998 to be powered by electric_batteries or an equally exhaust-free source . In a state proud_of an air quality program often hailed as innovative and aggressive , the prospect of the federal_government stepping_in has been fearsome . But the EPA was apologetic on Tuesday about imposing the plan on California , and Marcus made_it clear that local and state officials would remain in control of most anti-smog efforts . The EPA had long preferred to leave air quality issues to California when environmentalists first sued the agency in 1984 . The Coalition for Clean Air and the Sierra Club filed another lawsuit over the clean-air issues in 1988 . The EPA lost in federal_court and the U.S. Supreme Court rejected its bid for an appeal in 1992 . &quot; We went all_the way to the Supreme Court and lost , so this thing is real , &quot; Howekamp said . &quot; We have to implement it. &quot; To the relief of local leaders , federal_officials issued a challenge Tuesday to California ' s political and business_leaders to come_up with their own plans that satisfy federal law . The three metropolitan areas are working_on new clean-air plans due Nov . 15 . &quot; We ' ve been clear we are not wedded to this , &quot; Marcus said . &quot; It ' s our best shot , but if people come_up with a better idea , we will take that and incorporate it . When people say don ' t do X , we ' ll say , OK , what should we do instead ? &quot; Wyman called the offer &quot; quite a wake-up call to Southern California. &quot; &quot; This is an invitation to chart our own course or do what EPA says . They are inviting the region to take_control of its own destiny and propose a better way to do_it , &quot; he said . * BARBS OVER ELECTRIC_CARS : Two federal lawmakers say California Gov .
