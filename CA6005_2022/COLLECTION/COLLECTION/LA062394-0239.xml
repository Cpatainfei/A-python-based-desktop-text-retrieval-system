   <HEADLINE> IMPACT OF THE WEAK DOLLAR / THE CONSUMERS ' VIEW ; IMPORT IMPACT : ZILCH ; RETAILERS , ANALYSTS EXPECT STABLE PRICES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Afraid a falling dollar will mean higher prices for imported consumer goods such_as televisions , clothing and cars ? Not necessarily . Retailers and economists say the day-to-day fluctuation in foreign_exchange rates -- the price in dollars for the foreign currency needed to buy goods from abroad -- has virtually no effect on prices in the short term and is only a minor factor_in the long_run . Among the reasons are increased manufacturing of products in the country in which they are sold , competitive pressures against price hikes and the long lead time between orders and sales . Also , possible currency changes are among the factors retailers consider before they set prices . &quot; We don ' t go_around the store marking_up the prices all_the time &quot; when the dollar falls , said Robert August , a sales associate at the Pier 1 Imports store in Hollywood . Merchandising and pricing decisions are made months before products appear on store shelves , August said . Besides , the store ' s most popular items include furniture and clothing from China , India , Indonesia and the Philippines -- countries whose currencies are closely linked to the U.S. dollar . &quot; The dollar has fallen_in value very sharply against the Japanese yen , but as far as consumers are concerned , that ' s not particularly bad news , &quot; said Robert Brusca , chief economist at Nikko Securities Co . in New York . On Tuesday , the dollar hit a post-World War II low against the Japanese yen , falling below 100 before closing at 100.35. The greenback climbed slightly on Wednesday , closing at 100.95 yen . When the dollar falls against foreign currencies , it takes more dollars to buy goods from other countries . that ' s supposed to make imports more expensive . But , said Brusca , &quot; it ' s not written in stone that this will affect prices. &quot; Despite the heavy attention paid to America ' s trade_deficit with Japan , Japanese products account_for only about 12 % of American imports , Brusca said . Historically , Japanese manufacturers have not raised prices when the yen rose , he said . &quot; When the dollar dropped from 220 yen to 150 yen , it didn ' t do anything in terms of raising prices , so why should dropping from 120 yen to 100 do anything ? &quot; Japanese producers are loath to raise prices , even if it means cutting_into their profits . Some prices of Japanese imported cars have risen , but not in_proportion_to the rise in the yen . &quot; Manufacturers don ' t want to pass_on that cost to us . They ' d rather keep their market share , &quot; said Chris Herr , general_manager of Adray ' s Discount Department_Store in Los Angeles , which specializes in electronics equipment such_as televisions , VCRs and computers . Although Japanese brands such_as Sony , RCA and Hitachi are market leaders , Herr said more and more electronics products are coming from Mexico , Korea and Taiwan , countries where the dollar is stronger . Japanese manufacturers can shift production to sites in America when costs at_home become too expensive for Americans to afford . &quot; Toyota has been manufacturing more and more cars in the U.S. specifically to hedge against changes in the exchange_rate , &quot; said Toyota dealer Kent Hagen . &quot; The action that took_place Tuesday or within the last week or two has no impact on our day-to-day business. &quot; Factors such_as the U.S. regulatory environment and the cost of meeting new automobile standards have a much greater impact on the ultimate price of a car than the exchange_rate , Hagen said . Prices for clothing in department_stores have exchange_rate fluctuations built_in , so prices don ' t rise once they are_on store racks , said Nordstrom spokeswoman Kelly Tormey . &quot; The vast majority of the goods that we carry are purchased from U.S. vendors , &quot; Tormey said . &quot; If there was some sort of price impact , it would have been absorbed by the vendor by the time the goods get_to us. &quot; Not a Total Loser Thanks to gains against the Canadian_dollar over the past year , the U.S. dollar is up overall on a trade-weighted basis against currencies of the nation ' s five major trading partners . 03 # 17 , 12 # 09 Percent change vs . dollar Percent from share Currency June , ' 93 imports Yen -6.7 % 12.4 % Mark -3.9 4.8 Pound - 2.3 6.0 Canadian_dollar + 8.5 21.1 French_franc - 2.2 4.8 Total + 1.1 * 49.1 * Currency changes weighted based on share of_imports Source : Nikko Securities Co .</TEXT>
