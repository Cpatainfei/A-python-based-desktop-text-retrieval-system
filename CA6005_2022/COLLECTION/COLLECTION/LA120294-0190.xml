   <HEADLINE> CROATIA MAY WIDEN BOSNIA WAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Defense Minister Gojko Susak vowed Thursday that Croatia will send troops to seize back Serbian-occupied territory if the government calculates that the teetering Bihac pocket in northwest Bosnia-Herzegovina is about to fall . His warning was the most ominous indication since a Serbian assault on Bihac intensified three weeks ago that the international community ' s failure to protect the purported U.N. &quot; safe area &quot; could be the catalyst for a wider Balkan war . Croatian territory that has been under Serbian nationalist occupation for the last three years has been used by the rebel forces as a staging ground for attacks on neighboring Bihac , as well as for provocations against troops of the U.N. Protection Force . Susak ' s warning of an imminent rekindling of the unfinished war with Serbian rebels in the Krajina region came as U.N. officials reported that heavy machine-gun and small-arms battles have erupted along hundreds of miles of long-dormant front_line in Croatia . Fighting around Bihac continued to rage . The Bihac offensive waged by Bosnian Serbs with collaborating Krajina rebels has spurred fears that the nearly one-third of Croatia seized by Serbs in a 1991 rebellion will be lost forever with the fall of Bihac . &quot; Croatia will not wait for Bihac to fall , &quot; Susak told reporters at a news_conference . &quot; We are_well informed about the situation there , and if Croatia estimates that Bihac will fall , Croatia will intervene before that. &quot; &quot; We are not far from the time when Croatia not only will be able to but will take action , &quot; added Croatian army Chief_of_Staff Gen . Janko Bobetko , who noted that the U.N. mission has failed to provide the protection promised Bihac by a U.N. Security_Council designation of the enclave as a safe zone . Serbian nationalists from both Bosnia and the Krajina region have continued to bombard Bihac with heavy artillery , and hand-to-hand combat has reached within half a mile of the enclave ' s sole hospital , U.N. spokesman Alex Ivanko said . Bosnian Serb rebels also stepped_up the intensity of an apparent campaign to drive U.N. troops out of the region with an unprecedented cross-border kidnaping incident . Gunmen loyal to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic infiltrated a U.N.-patrolled area of Krajina adjacent to the Bihac pocket and forced seven Ukrainian soldiers at gunpoint back into Serb-held Bosnia . Serbs also fired two wire-guided missiles into the Interior Ministry building in Sarajevo , wounding four people , and denied passage to dozens of U.N.-escorted aid convoys . And Sarajevo airport remains closed to humanitarian relief flights by the surrounding Serbian forces , which recently positioned surface-to-air_missile_systems near the runway . U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali warned during a failed peace mission to Sarajevo on Wednesday , when Karadzic refused even to talk to him , that the U.N. mission might have to be withdrawn unless the fighting and harassment stop . But Karadzic loyalists have lately shown their eagerness for a pullout of the U.N. forces , who were deployed to protect vulnerable civilians from the rebels ' assaults . Boutros-Ghali attempted to pressure the Muslim-led Bosnian government to capitulate to the Serbian terms for peace , but Sarajevo officials have refused , fearing a surrender will lead to further &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; and brutality at the hands of the emboldened Serbs . Despite the peacekeepers ' rapidly deteriorating influence , U.N. mission officials refuse to call_in NATO air strikes to rein_in the rampaging Serbs for fear the heavily armed rebels will exact revenge against the nearly 500 U.N. hostages they are holding as human shields . Thousands of other troops of the 24 # 000-strong Bosnian deployment are also within easy reach of the rebels . The international community ' s inaction in Bosnia has heightened fears in Croatia that its own future is in peril if it continues to put faith in U.N. promises to facilitate a peaceful reintegration of the Serb-occupied region . Gen . Anton Tus , chief military adviser to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman , argued that the Bosnian and Croatian Serb forces are clearly working in concert to create a united Western Serbia from their occupied territories . Tus insisted the Serbs should be stopped . &quot; We cannot let Bihac fall . We must act before this can happen , &quot; Tus said . &quot; If the Bihac pocket falls , it would have strategic significance for both the political and military options &quot; open_to Croatia for recovering the Krajina , Tus said . He noted that with Bihac ' s important rail , highway and river connections , the rebels would gain an iron grip on the land they have conquered in both countries . &quot; The international community , especially the United States , is wrong in its refusal to prevent the occupation of the Bihac area and aggression launched from the U.N.-protected areas , &quot; Tus said . Susak and other military officials have said they were prepared to send troops into Krajina two weeks ago when the Croatian Serb rebels were preoccupied with the assault on Bihac , but held_back at the urging of U.S. diplomats who feared that would reignite the Serb-Croat war and possibly spread throughout the Balkans . &quot; Another war in Croatia would have all_the incivility of Bosnia but many times more firepower , &quot; one Western diplomat warned . Tus said he believed that the Croatian leadership was &quot; relying too_much &quot; on the advice to take no military_action against the Krajina rebels and to put its faith in the U.N. peacekeeping mission that has been deployed here for 32 months . If the combined Bosnian and Croatian Serb attack force succeeds in overrunning the Bihac region , its 200 # 000 predominantly Muslim residents would likely be driven en masse into Croatia or central Bosnia . In either case , such a huge influx of refugees would provoke a humanitarian catastrophe for and political crises in Zagreb and Sarajevo . Tus said the Zagreb leadership needs to seriously re-evaluate the advice it is getting from the West , especially from Washington . The general said he opposed direct military intervention into the Krajina region , but supported urgent action to &quot; tie_down &quot; the Serbian rebels so they cannot wreak havoc around Bihac . Just such distractions along the 400-mile front_line between Krajina Serbs and government forces were reported by the U.N. Protection Force on Thursday . In one five-hour period Wednesday , a U.N. observation_post recorded 33 mortar rounds fired by Croatian troops across the U.N.-patrolled separation zone that runs the length of the front_line , Ivanko said . Altogether , 129 &quot; cease-fire violations &quot; were reported that day in what U.N. officials characterize as the most serious escalation of fighting in the Krajina in months .</TEXT>
