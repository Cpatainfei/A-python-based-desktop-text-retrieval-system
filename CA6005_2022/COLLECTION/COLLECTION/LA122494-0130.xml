   <HEADLINE> IRELAND FREES NINE IRA MEMBERS , CITING SUPPORT FOR PEACE PROCESS ; EUROPE : PROTESTANT UNIONISTS ACCUSE DUBLIN OF BOWING TO TERRORISTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Irish government , declaring that it wishes to maintain the peace process in Northern_Ireland , released nine Irish_Republican_Army members from its prisons Friday . Justice Minister Nora Owen , a member of the new coalition government , also announced a seven-day holiday parole for 30 more IRA members in Ireland ' s jails . She said the government , which took_office last week , is &quot; anxious to consolidate the Northern_Ireland peace process and move it forward. &quot; The news provoked anger among Northern_Ireland Protestants loyal to British rule . They criticized Dublin for knuckling_under to terrorists . David Trimble , a loyalist member_of_Parliament from Northern_Ireland , declared : &quot; This is political interference in the legal_system to achieve short-term political gain . It is something that happens in a banana republic , not in a civilized society. &quot; In London , a spokesman at the prime_minister ' s office said of the release : &quot; It ' s a matter for the_Irish government. &quot; But one Conservative MP , Andrew Hunter , chairman of the Northern_Ireland committee , declared : &quot; Dublin has been gravely mistaken in going_ahead with these early releases . It is handing_out the wrong signals , ( which ) could well threaten the process of the peace movement. &quot; The move was welcomed by Sinn Fein , the political arm of the IRA , whose vice_president , Pat Doherty , commented : &quot; We are very happy that these prisoners and others being granted parole will be spending Christmas with their families. &quot; The prisoner releases were originally due_to begin last month in response to the republican and unionist cease-fires . The move was delayed while Irish Justice_Department officials decided that a post_office robbery and a bombing last week were not the official work of the IRA . Among those freed Friday were Aaron O ' Connell , 35 , and Eamon Nolan , 41 , who have spent 14 years in jail for the murder of a civil_servant during a bank robbery . One of the prisoners allowed parole was Thomas McMahon , serving a life sentence for the 1979 killing of Britain ' s Lord Mountbatten and three others . Patrick Mayhew , Britain ' s Northern_Ireland secretary , maintained that there will be no early release for terrorist prisoners in Northern_Ireland . &quot; I can guarantee that those who have been sentenced by the courts will serve their sentences according to the law , &quot; he said . Both IRA and unionist paramilitaries claim that there are political_prisoners in jail in both Ireland and Northern_Ireland . But Mayhew said Friday , &quot; There are no political_prisoners anywhere in this country . Anyone who is in prison here in Northern_Ireland is in prison because they have been convicted of criminal offenses by the independent courts. &quot;</TEXT>
