   <HEADLINE> PUSH FOR PARTIAL EUROPE UNION RAISES IRE ; DIPLOMACY : GERMANS SUGGEST THOSE THAT ARE READY PROCEED WITH JOINT POLICY . OTHER NATIONS PROTEST AFFRONT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It has been weeks since the latest salvos were fired in the debate about how best to move forward with the job of uniting Europe , but echoes continue to reverberate through the corridors of Continental power . The noise is likely to grow only louder in the months ahead . A group of German members_of_Parliament headed by two of Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s closest confidants caused the biggest stir by detailing publicly what even the most ardent advocates of closer European integration have been saying in private -- that a core of economically strong , politically committed European Union countries should move toward full monetary and political union , leaving the door open for others to join when they are ready and willing . The intensity of the reaction to the Germans ' proposal is based in part on the lawmakers involved -- they are respected , influential and close to Kohl ' s thinking ; they include his possible successor , Wolfgang Schaeuble . But the Germans also caused a stir because they named the countries they believe should belong_to the core : Germany , France , the_Netherlands , Belgium and Luxembourg . Those left_out , especially larger countries such_as Italy , Spain and Britain , reacted to what they considered a major affront . Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi telephoned Kohl to complain , and British Prime_Minister John Major said in a speech that he &quot; recoiled from ideas of a union in which some would be more equal than others. &quot; Because the German idea was floated only days after French Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur advocated in more diplomatic language a similar plan , some worry that Bonn and Paris may be trying to hijack the integration process for their own ends . &quot; There ' s always some mistrust of larger countries , and this hasn ' t helped , but how else can one manage a union of 20 nations ? &quot; asked Bernard van Praag , director of Amsterdam University ' s Institute for Economic Research . The debate is important because it unfolds as the 12-nation European Union prepares_for a major review of the Maastricht Treaty , which commits the members to monetary and political union by the decade ' s end . While the review is not scheduled to occur until 1996 , the issues are so basic to the Continent ' s future that they have been discussed virtually since the treaty took force last year . Now the discussion is growing more intense . &quot; This debate is forcing people to come_to grips with the fundamental issue of what kind of Europe we are going_to have , &quot; said Susie Symes , who heads the European program at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London . &quot; Is there going_to be a two-speed Europe ? Is there going_to be a core_group ? There is a great_deal of realistic thinking going_on now. &quot; Talk_of a &quot; two-speed Europe , &quot; an idea viewed_as heresy among advocates of integration only a_few years ago , has been pushed to the fore by compelling realities , including : * The EU is rapidly enlarging , with membership coming_to at least 14 and possibly 16 states by January and potentially to 20 by the decade ' s end , when Poland , Hungary , Slovakia and the Czech Republic hope to join . * The large differences in social , political and economic development between nations such_as Germany and Greece or Slovakia pose significant risks to the creation of a viable monetary and political union . The impact of Germany ' s 1990 currency union on the weaker eastern region has heightened the awareness of these dangers . * It is increasingly clear that only a handful of countries are expected to meet the tough fiscal criteria needed to qualify for monetary union ; only Luxembourg and Ireland qualify , although some others , including Germany and France , are expected to meet the standards . &quot; The creation of a core_group is not an end in itself , &quot; the German lawmakers stressed in a collective statement , &quot; but a way to counter centrifugal_forces and keep to the undisputed goals of expansion and deeper integration. &quot; Critics of a &quot; multiple-speed Europe &quot; claim that it flies in the face of the underlying political principle of equality , a principle that drove the fathers of European unity .</TEXT>
