   <TEXT> Regarding &quot; ' Caesar ' Played the Game Before ' Quiz , ' &quot; by Patt Morrison ( Film_Clips , Oct . 16 ) : What a delight to read an article about one of my all-time favorite films , &quot; Champagne for Caesar. &quot; I thought I may be one of a handful of people who not only remember this film but think it is top-notch fare . I watched it numerous times when it was first on TV many moons ago and finally taped it to have it in my collection . It ' s always an enjoyable experience . I had the good_fortune to meet Vincent Price a_few years ago . Although our encounter was brief , I did tell him that the role I liked the most was his portrayal of Burnbridge Waters . He seemed pleased , especially since I suppose so many people told him they found his horror roles more satisfying . Not me , and I guess not Patt Morrison either . I agree that the most delicious moment in the film is when Price gets that call from Prof . Einstein . A classic ! DAN MORIN Los Angeles * Where do I sign_up for your campaign for a revival , not a remake , of &quot; Champagne for Caesar &quot; ? I have such fond memories of this movie of the ' 50s , which was one of the first few I saw as a then-new immigrant to the United States . It surely prompted me to memorize my Social_Security_number forever more . Please , do seriously use your influence to bring it back for all_of us to relish once more . H . K . HSIEH Pacific Palisades * It ' s hardly surprising that Vincent Price delivered a &quot; splendid comic turn &quot; in &quot; Champagne for Caesar. &quot; Despite the popularity of his horror films , the actor had one of the best senses_of_humor in Hollywood and excelled in farce . Interestingly , Price himself was a quiz-show celebrity contestant . Twice in 1956 he appeared in the capacity of art expert on &quot; The $ 64 # 000 Challenge , &quot; both times tying for the championship . Aline Saarinen wrote in the New York Times : &quot; At once urbane and appealing , ( Price ) communicated to millions an infectious enthusiasm and an adventuresomeness into modern art . . . . When he said , ' You don ' t need $ 64 # 000 to be a collector or enjoy art -- it doesn ' t even cost sixty-four cents to go_to a museum , ' he took art off its pedestal and showed it to be alive and pertinent. &quot; ( Price was never implicated in the ensuing coaching scandal. ) &quot; Champagne for Caesar &quot; is not &quot; virtually forgotten &quot; -- in researching my book for Citadel Press_on Vincent ' s film career , I ' ve found fans aplenty . Tuesday marked the one-year anniversary of his death . How nice to see a classic Hollywood comedy that contains one of his most memorable performances basking in the spotlight . LUCY CHASE WILLIAMS West Hollywood * The obscurity and apparent unavailability of &quot; Champagne for Caesar &quot; is the unfortunate fate of a number of independent films . It was originally released by United Artists , though all_rights were retained by producer Harry M . Popkin . Unlike such sources of UA product as Goldwyn , Hughes , Korda and Selznick , whose protection of their libraries was_well documented , many other UA releases ( and those from companies like Screen Guild and Film Classics ) were early bargain titles in the 16mm non-theatrical market and the earliest American films to be released to TV . There , they were run to death in the early ' 50s , then shunted aside and forgotten as the major studio releases became available , and their copyrights were often allowed to lapse into the public_domain . With ownership in_question and storage fees not being paid , not only have the 35mm negatives on so many of these films been lost or junked , but so have even the dupe negatives used to make the 16mm prints . What copies do exist are usually from either 35mm prints saved by collectors or cobbled_together from what is left of those beat-up 16mm library or TV prints . If a good copy of &quot; Champagne for Caesar &quot; is not in an archive , perhaps Patt Morrison ' s article will inspire someone who has a good copy to make_it available for preservation .
