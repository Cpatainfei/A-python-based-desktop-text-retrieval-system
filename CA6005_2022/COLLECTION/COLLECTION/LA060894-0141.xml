   <HEADLINE> DEREGULATION PLAN ATTACKED FROM ALL SIDES ; ENERGY : PUC PROPOSAL FOR ELECTRICITY COMPETITION DRAWS COMPLAINTS . OFFICIALS SAY THE ISSUE COULD REACH THE SUPREME COURT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The state ' s bright vision for lower power bills through electric utility deregulation is likely to be tied_up in years of legal and technical wrangling , federal and industry officials said Tuesday . In their first round of written comments on the ambitious deregulation proposal sketched by the state Public_Utilities Commission in April , virtually all interested parties are leveling major complaints . Utility companies want to postpone competition , while consumer groups want to speed the advent of lower rates . And the U.S. Department_of_Energy is warning that the PUC ' s legal strategy could keep any deregulation plan tied_up in the courts for years . &quot; It sure looks_to us as though they ' re getting_into murky water , &quot; Susan F . Tierney , assistant secretary for policy at the department , said on the eve of today ' s deadline for comments . &quot; Our legal analysis is that at best it ' s a very high-risk legal position for California to take -- that it can . . . order retail ( competition ) and set rates that look and behave as though they ' re transmission rates , &quot; a component of utility rate making that falls_under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , Tierney said . She predicted that lawsuits will be filed over the PUC plan and that they will eventually be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court . A series of public hearings on the proposal begins next Tuesday and Wednesday in Los Angeles . The commission has proposed allowing the largest industrial users of electricity to start shopping among competing power suppliers in 1996 . Small industrial customers would follow in 1998 , commercial users the next year and residential consumers by 2002 . The commission is attempting to create a competitive marketplace in hopes of bringing_down California ' s electricity rates , which run 50 % above the national average . But even the significance of that statistic has come under_fire . Ralph Cavanagh , energy policy director for the Natural_Resources Defense Council , an environmental group , faults the commission for &quot; the false notion that somehow California has buried its economy under a mountain of electricity costs . That is just not true. &quot; While rates are high , Cavanagh and others point_out , Californians use much less electricity than consumers in other states . In large part , that is because of energy conservation efforts , which drop consumers ' monthly bills to among the lowest in the country . Indeed , the council argues in its comments , electricity represents just 2.5 % of California ' s gross state product , compared to 3.1 % of the gross_national_product . The council contends that the PUC plan could , in_effect , dismantle the programs that are bringing energy savings and give California the world ' s most diverse mix of electricity-generating fuels . The group also calls_for the commission to strengthen the existing wholesale market for electricity -- in which utilities can buy power from other utilities or independent producers -- before moving_on to the more complex task of establishing retail competition . Southern California Edison Co . takes the same position , proposing a three-stage plan that would establish a wholesale power pool in the western states but indefinitely delay retail competition . &quot; Think_of it as the brains and the control &quot; of the regional transmission system , said John E . Bryson , chairman and chief_executive of Edison . The pool would be an independent company owned by investors with no interests in either independent power generators or utilities . It would channel the lowest-cost electricity to utilities , without favoring any producer or group . &quot; One analogy would be the air traffic_control system , &quot; Bryson said . Such a structure could be modified to handle retail competition somewhere down the line , he said . San Francisco-based Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co . also wants to put_off residential retail choice , in its case until 2008 -- six years later than the commission proposes . In exchange for a delay , PG &amp; E will offer to forgo the &quot; transition &quot; fees envisioned in the PUC plan that would let it charge ratepayers for the costs of existing assets -- not least its Diablo Canyon nuclear plant -- that could become uneconomical in a competitive environment . In a move that mirrors recent PUC approval of an Edison proposal , PG &amp; E wants to accelerate by $ 200 million a year the depreciation on its nuclear investment instead . &quot; We want to use time instead of larger transition costs to manage a period of transition into the future competitive market , &quot; said Robert D . Glynn Jr. , PG &amp; E senior_vice_president and general_manager of customer energy services . Meanwhile , consumer groups -- from industrial to agricultural to residential users -- plan to file comments raising the drumbeat for lower power rates and faster implementation of the PUC plan . San Francisco-based Toward Utility Rate Normalization , for instance , will call_for introducing retail choice to residential users first , or at least at_the_same_time it is granted to big industrial consumers .</TEXT>
