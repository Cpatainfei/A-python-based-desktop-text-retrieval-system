   <HEADLINE> BERLUSCONI TRIES TO PULL A FAST ONE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By a crushing 418-33 vote , the Italian Parliament has nullified a decree by Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi that sought to shield corrupt politicians from prosecution . Americans should applaud this vote even if , as we shall explain , American applause is constitutionally awkward . The good news is that over the past three years Italy has undergone a political cleansing the_likes_of which no one believed possible and indeed scarcely any other democratic country has ever seen . As a result of a protracted legal war on bribery , the corrupt Christian Democratic_party , which had dominated Italian politics since the end of World_War_II , is in ruins ; Bettino Craxi , a former prime_minister , is a fugitive_from_justice in North Africa , and Berlusconi , a conservative media magnate billing himself as an untainted outsider , is his country ' s unlikely chief_executive . The recent bad news was that Berlusconi seemed more old politics than new politics after all . Italy permits the pretrial detention of those charged with crime , and the judges most admired for cleaning Italy ' s political house have used this tactic freely . It seems that the experience of detention among common criminals induces many_a political fat cat to sing like a canary . Berlusconi ' s edict sought to eliminate pretrial detention for a long list of white-collar offenses , including , to Italy ' s dismay , bribery and corruption charges . The decree freed some 1 # 100 detainees overnight . To become law permanently , however , Berlusconi ' s decree required confirmation by a Parliament in which his own party does not command a majority . When his coalition partners turned against him , he had no alternative but to announce the withdrawal of the decree later this week . But Parliament , in a stunning rebuke , refused to wait that long . Italy ' s is a parliamentary form_of_government , and the revolt in Berlusconi ' s ranks may yet jeopardize his very continuation in office . The freed detainees may_not go immediately back into detention , but Italians are clearly relieved that the basic law is back on the books . What makes the moment slightly awkward for Americans is that what Berlusconi extended as a privilege to some Italians is , for all Americans , a constitutional right . Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution guarantees every detained American the right to petition for an early hearing at which the government may be compelled to show cause for the detention . This &quot; Great Writ &quot; of habeas_corpus has been called &quot; the most important human_right in the Constitution. &quot; How then can Americans criticize Berlusconi ? They can do so on the ground that whatever protections a democratic system offers against unlawful detention must be offered to all equally . By extending an &quot; American &quot; right selectively , Berlusconi bade fair to wreck Italy ' s system of justice without going nearly far enough to create an Italian version of America ' s . The Italians had every reason to stop him , and we are glad they did .</TEXT>
