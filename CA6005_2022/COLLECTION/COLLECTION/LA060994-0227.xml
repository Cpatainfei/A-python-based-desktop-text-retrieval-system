   <HEADLINE> WARRING BOSNIA FACTIONS AGREE TO 1-MONTH TRUCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rebel Bosnian Serbs and the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina grudgingly agreed Wednesday to a monthlong cease-fire , breathing some life into expiring hopes for an end to the most vicious conflict to rack Europe since World_War_II . Croatian officials and Serbian insurgents also achieved a symbolic breakthrough in their standoff over the disputed Krajina region by agreeing to launch another effort to mend the ethnic rift dividing this country . But on the shifting sands of Balkans diplomacy , few among the mediators and militants appeared to be building expectations of a lasting solution to the wars that have convulsed the former Yugoslav federation for three years and left 200 # 000 dead . The truce agreement for Bosnia was accompanied by warnings from Bosnian Serb nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic that many previous pacts had called_for a halt in fighting but &quot; none of them worked. &quot; Bosnian Serbs , who hold 70 % of Bosnia , had pressed for an indefinite truce , apparently with the aim of cementing their hold_on occupied territory while partition talks bogged down . Peter Galbraith , U.S. ambassador to Croatia , called the Bosnian agreement , reached in Geneva , &quot; modest. &quot; Citing the Bosnian cease-fire and the planned resumption of talks between the Croatian government and Serbian insurgents next Thursday , Galbraith -- chief U.S. envoy for the Krajina dispute -- said new opportunities have presented themselves for easing hostilities in the Balkans . &quot; It ' s a modest step , but hopefully one that represents a change in the psychology of the conflict , &quot; he said of the Bosnian cease-fire , which he described as an encouraging influence on the Krajina talks . Even Yasushi Akashi , the usually optimistic U.N. special envoy , conceded that the fate of the Bosnian accord would depend_on both warring factions displaying a rare degree of &quot; good faith. &quot; Karadzic and the head of the Bosnian delegation , Vice_President Ejup Ganic , had refused to meet face to face , forcing Akashi to shuttle from one to the other to wring the cease-fire deal_out of the two sides . The Geneva talks were delayed for four days while U.N. officials sought to enforce a 6-week-old ultimatum for Bosnian Serb withdrawal from the protected enclave of Gorazde . The peace process was further hampered by escalating clashes along the more_than 700 miles of front_line traversing Bosnia . Akashi had appealed_to both the Bosnian government and the Bosnian Serb nationalists for a cease-fire that would run_for four months -- a duration that mediators considered long enough to allow the warring factions to reapportion Bosnian territory between them . But Muslims and Croats -- who have reconciled and proclaimed a new Bosnian federation after a bloody , yearlong falling_out -- warned that the Bosnian Serbs were probably stalling to stave_off fighting during the summer months when the poorly armed but more numerous government troops gain some advantage . Ganic , on a stop in Zagreb en route to Sarajevo , said the government stood_firm in its insistence on a shorter truce , fearing the Serbs were trying to freeze the territorial status_quo and push the Bosnian conflict out of the forefront of international attention . Even President Clinton , who had earlier kept his distance from U.N. and European Union attempts to pressure the Bosnian government to accept defeat and partition , has now endorsed the allies ' strategy for bringing peace to the vanquished republic by carving it into ethnic pieces along borders drawn by force . His speech before the_French Parliament on Tuesday signaled a shift in U.S. policy , closing a gap between the international powers involved in Balkans peacemaking . But his words effectively removed the Bosnian government ' s last cause to count_on Western support for a more equitable peace . &quot; If you were a Muslim , you might now conclude that the best option is to stall and look_for a military solution , &quot; one Western diplomat observed , noting that U.N. calls_for more peacekeeping troops to police the cease-fire are likely to fall on deaf ears in an international community already exhausted by the Balkan conflict . The United States now expects an agreement on a proposal -- namely a map outlining the division of Bosnia -- in four to six weeks , said a senior U.S. official traveling_to Istanbul , Turkey , with Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher . The goal is a territorial formula that will protect Bosnian interests and take natural boundaries into consideration , he said . At the same time , he noted , &quot; it won ' t be a negotiable solution if it looks totally unreasonable to the Serbs. &quot; But that U.S. endeavor to appease the victimized Muslims and simultaneously compel the Bosnian Serbs to endorse a fair solution has proved elusive throughout the 26-month-old Bosnian conflict . Akashi has appealed for 5 # 000 more troops to bolster the 15 # 000 already deployed in Bosnia . But a plea he made in March for 12 # 000 soldiers produced offers of fewer than 5 # 000 , many of whom have yet to arrive . And without the foreign peacekeepers needed to patrol cease-fire lines , violations can be expected , causing the accord to eventually , if not immediately , unravel . In the unlikely event the Muslim-Croatian alliance and the Bosnian Serb rebels work_out a land split in the month following Friday ' s start of the cease-fire , the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization has promised up_to 50 # 000 troops to oversee implementation of the settlement . But in_view of the reluctance displayed by troop-contributing nations to continue exposing soldiers in the risky Balkans mission , mediators fear NATO likewise would be slow in deploying . Times staff writer Robin Wright in Istanbul contributed to this report .</TEXT>
