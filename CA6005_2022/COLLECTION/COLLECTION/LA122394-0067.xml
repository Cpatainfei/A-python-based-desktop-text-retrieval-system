   <TEXT> Alberto Tomba longed for this one , and it was a long_time coming . Tomba , a three-time Olympic champion from Italy , won his first World Cup giant slalom in nearly three years Thursday at Alta Badia , Italy , giving him three victories in three days and five this season . Tomba , 28 , had the fastest times in both runs to beat Urs Kaelin of Switzerland by 0.45 seconds down the steep Gran Risa track in the Italian Dolomite Mountains . Christian Mayer of Austria was third , 0.61 seconds behind Tomba . It was the 38th victory of Tomba ' s career , and he is off to his best start since the 1987-88 season , when he won nine races and two gold medals at the Calgary Olympics . &quot; I really wanted to win this giant slalom , in this place , &quot; Tomba said . &quot; The latest victory is always the most exciting , but I can ' t say today ' s was better than yesterday ' s . I love them all. &quot; Counting consecutive slalom victories to end last season , Tomba now has won a record six slaloms in a row , beating the men ' s World Cup record of five done three times by Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark and matched once by Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg . The triumph also widened Tomba ' s overall lead in the World Cup standings . He has 550 points , 248 more_than defending World Cup champion Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway . College Football USC offensive coordinator Mike Riley will be interviewed Monday for the coaching vacancy at Vanderbilt . Riley , 41 , is in his second year at USC . Vanderbilt seeks a successor to Gerry DiNardo , who recently left Vanderbilt after four years to become coach at Louisiana State . Vanderbilt was 5-6 last season . &quot; I told them I ' d talk to them , but that I ' m really happy at USC and it ' d take a great offer to get me to leave , &quot; Riley said . Riley will be interviewed by Vanderbilt Athletic Director Paul Hoolahan in Dallas , where USC will play Texas Tech in the Cotton Bowl on Jan . 2 . A Miami sports official said bargain housing deals given to football_players who rented from boosters made_it tough for him to maintain NCAA compliance and was partially responsible_for his resignation last year . Players from Miami ' s 1989 and 1991 championship teams got the sweet deals on housing , the Miami Herald reported . &quot; I questioned whether they had institutional control and that ' s one of the reasons I left , &quot; said Doug Johnson , former associate director for compliance . &quot; I didn ' t think I could work to maintain institutional control. &quot; Five players also drove rental cars at discounted_rates , but the NCAA found the violations were not serious enough to punish the school , the newspaper reported . As for the housing , Johnson said he approved leases for Heisman Trophy winner Gino Torretta and two others to pay only a combined $ 1 # 000 a month to live_in a $ 200 # 000 luxury Coconut Grove condominium owned by a booster in 1991 . But he said he warned school officials about the dangers of similar living_arrangements in which players rented rooms from boosters . &quot; When people live together things happen -- the borrowing of a car , the loaning of money -- the kind of thing that is a definite violation , &quot; Johnson said . Baseball The Texas_Rangers acquired right-handed_pitcher John Burkett from the San Francisco Giants in exchange for infielder Rich Aurilia and outfielder Desi Wilson . &quot; I was a little surprised to be going , &quot; Burkett said . &quot; But I can tell you that I ' m really excited about it . I want to be_on a winning team . The Rangers seem to be making that commitment . that ' s all you can ask for. &quot; Burkett won 67 games for the Giants in the last five seasons . He tied for the fourth most victories in the National League during the same period . He was tied for second in the National League last season with 25 starts , issuing only two walks every nine innings . In 1993 , Burkett tied for first place with 22 victories . Aurilia and Wilson will be assigned to the Giants ' Pacific Coast League team in Phoenix . Veteran catcher Kirt Manwaring signed a new two-year , $ 3.675-million contract with the Giants , the team announced . Manwaring , who has been with the Giants for five years , batted . 250 with 29 runs batted in during the strike-shortened season . All-Star first_baseman Frank Thomas said the Chicago White Sox are in serious trouble now that they ' ve lost Julio Franco to a Japanese team and traded pitcher Jack McDowell to the New York Yankees . Franco agreed to a two-year , $ 7-million contract with the Chiba Lotte Marines , the richest contract_in Japanese baseball history . &quot; After a breakthrough year for the White Sox this past season , I see this as a very serious setback to our goal of becoming the next World_Series champion , &quot; Thomas said in a statement . The Cincinnati Reds , still trying to sort_out their starting rotation for next season , signed Jack Morris , 39 , to a $ 600 # 000 , one-year contract that gives him the chance to earn $ 1.4 million more in bonuses . Morris , a right-hander who has spent his 18-year career in the American League , was released by Cleveland in August . Miscellany The Royal and Ancient Golf_Club announced that a change in the rules will allow Arnold Palmer to make a farewell appearance at the_British Open , which returns to the Old Course at St . Andrews , Scotland , in 1995 .
