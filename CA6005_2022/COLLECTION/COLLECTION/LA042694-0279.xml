   <HEADLINE> ALLIES TAKE NEW TACK TO END BOSNIA WAR ; DIPLOMACY : U.S. , EUROPEAN UNION , U.N. , RUSSIA WILL MEET FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY IN SEARCH OF A PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After high-level talks , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd announced Monday that the United States , Russia , the United Nations and the European Union will launch a joint diplomatic initiative to move the Bosnian crisis toward a permanent cease-fire and a political settlement . They hope to coordinate the oft-confused array of international peace efforts and give their coalition greater clout in dealing with the warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina . Their new &quot; contact group &quot; is scheduled to meet for the first time here today . It is intended to follow_up_on the ultimatum that took_effect last weekend ordering Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from the besieged Bosnian city of Gorazde -- and to prevent the confrontations that have followed other Balkan cease-fires . This group &quot; is a way . . . to try to regain the momentum that existed prior to the situation in Gorazde and to try to carry_forward , to build_on some tentative agreements that were reached ( at earlier peace talks ) in Geneva , &quot; Christopher said at a news_conference after talks with British Prime_Minister John Major . In the next two weeks , group members are expected to engage in talks with the largely Muslim government and Serbian and Croatian forces about outlines of a Bosnian peace plan . The result is likely to be a loose confederation or union of two or more Muslim , Serbian and Croatian areas . &quot; The assumption continues to be that the integrity of Bosnia will be preserved and that the political solution that will result would take that into account , &quot; said a senior U.S. official on the trip . Hurd said any peace must involve a &quot; substantial withdrawal &quot; by Bosnian Serbs . But Christopher indicated that the Muslim government will not get_back significant areas lost militarily in the two-year war , which has led to more_than 200 # 000 dead or missing . &quot; I don ' t believe anybody has recently thought that the_matter could go_back to where it was at the very beginning , &quot; Christopher said . Pressed_on why the Bosnian Serbs should be any more cooperative this time after repeatedly breaking previous cease-fires and violating U.N.-declared &quot; safe havens , &quot; Hurd tried to strike an optimistic note about the latest developments . &quot; If they want to have a settled future , if they want to reconstruct towns and villages , if they want to see some decent standard_of_living for themselves and their children , if they want a place in Europe and the world , then they ' ll need to settle , &quot; he said . &quot; Because they ' re not going_to achieve any of those things by hanging_on to land which they now occupy by force. &quot; In Washington , President Clinton also tried to sound upbeat . &quot; It appears that the pressure brought_to_bear by NATO and the United Nations has worked , that the cease-fire is working , that the withdrawal is continuing . It ' s now clearly time to get the diplomatic initiatives going again while we maintain our vigilance , &quot; he said . European officials hope this initiative will lead to an international conference on Bosnia . Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin and French President Francois Mitterrand have both favored a summit of world_powers and Bosnian factions . But U.S. officials stressed Monday that weeks of preparatory work must be done before a decision on a conference can even be made . Meantime , the Clinton_Administration is issuing warnings about potential cease-fire violations or delays . Christopher , who conducted his meetings on the eve of a Tuesday night deadline for Serbian forces to withdraw their heavy_weapons at least 12 miles from Gorazde , pointedly noted that his discussions had convinced him of the &quot; clear resolve on all_of our parts to enforce the NATO deadline. &quot;</TEXT>
