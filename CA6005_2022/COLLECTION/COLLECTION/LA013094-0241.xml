   <HEADLINE> AUSTRIAN SKIER ULRIKE MAIER DIES AFTER FALL IN DOWNHILL ; SKIING : THE ONLY MOTHER ON THE WORLD CUP CIRCUIT , TWO-TIME WORLD CHAMPION SUFFERS A BROKEN NECK AFTER APPARENTLY LOSING BALANCE IN A DOWNHILL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tragedy again struck the powerful Austrian ski team Saturday when the World Cup ' s only skiing mother , Ulrike Maier , was killed in a downhill race after crashing two-thirds down the course at Garmisch-Partenkirchen , Germany . Austrian and German officials said Maier -- a two time world champion in super-giant slalom and one of Austria ' s top medal hopes at the upcoming Lillehammer Olympics -- suffered a broken neck when her right ski apparently hit a patch of soft snow , causing her to lose balance . Maier ' s head struck a timing post , at which time she lost her helmet , tumbled over several times and appeared to have been hit by one of her skis that snapped free . Officials tried to revive her with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and heart_massage , said Karl Flock , a German team doctor who was_on the scene . Christoph Kruis , another doctor who was_on the scene , said Maier also was placed on a respirator . Maier , 26 , was flown_by helicopter to an emergency accident hospital at Murnau , 15 miles east of the Bavarian resort , but a team of surgeons was unable to save her . &quot; She had no chance , &quot; said Guenter Hofmann , a co-director of the hospital . He said Maier was virtually dead upon arrival at the hospital . &quot; It is a black day for all_of us , &quot; said Hubert Ostler , chief of the race organizing committee . Austria has dominated the World Cup circuit in recent years , running_away with the Nation ' s Cup last year while placing 23 skiers on the podium . But the country has also known tragedy . Maier is the fifth member of the Austrian ski team to die in the last three years . Gernot Reinstadler was killed in practice for a downhill at Wengen , Switzerland , in 1991 . Rudolf Nierlich died in a car crash in 1991 , and Peter Wirnsberger died in a skiing accident in 1992 . Nierlich won the slalom and giant slalom at the World Championships at Vail , Colo. , in 1989 , when Maier won her first world title . Alois Kahr , an Austrian coach , also died in a car crash during that time . Maier ' s crash was televised live_in Austria , where Alpine skiing is as popular as the NFL is in the United States . After news of Maier ' s death , reporters who chronicled her career stood_in silence in the press room . Some hugged each other to find comfort . Maier , a 10-year veteran known as &quot; Ulli , &quot; had been a sentimental favorite since 1989 , when she won the first of two world titles while she was three months pregnant with a daughter , Melanie . Maier took a year and a half off after the birth , then returned to Saalbach , Austria , in 1991 to win her second world title in super-G . Neither Maier ' s daughter , now 4 , nor her long-term companion Hubert Schweighofer , a police_officer , witnessed the crash at Garmisch . Maier and Schweighofer had planned to wed next fall . Maier earned her fifth World Cup victory last week , a giant slalom at Maribor , Slovenia . At the 1992 Albertville Games , she was fourth in giant slalom and fifth in super-G , and currently ranked fourth in the World Cup overall standings . Although Maier was traveling at speeds estimated at 60 m.p.h. , officials said the course was safe . &quot; It was one of the safest parts of the course , &quot; chief referee Kurt Hoch said . An overnight storm had dumped a layer of fresh snow on the track and the race was delayed an hour while officials prepared the Kandahar course . American Picabo Street was leading the downhill before the long delay after the crash , which changed_course conditions and allowed Isolde Kostner , an 18-year-old Italian in her first World Cup , to win in 1 minute 44.04 seconds . Street finished seventh . &quot; I ' m kind of glad I didn ' t win today , &quot; Street said . &quot; I don ' t think I ' d want to look_back at some point to a day I ' d won but someone had died , much less someone as great as Uli . &quot; It just reminds you how it could just as easily happen to you. &quot; A downhill scheduled today at Garmisch-Partenkirchen was canceled . An Austrian television_station , in a tribute , aired an excerpt from a recent interview with Maier , who discussed risks of the sport . &quot; You can ' t escape your fate , &quot; she said . &quot; But I hope I am able to judge the risks of the downhill. &quot;</TEXT>
