   <HEADLINE> CENTERPIECE : TAKING THE PLUNGE ; THE DELTA , A JULES VERNE-STYLE SUB-FOR-HIRE , PLUMBS OCEAN DEPTHS DOING SCIENTIFIC TASKS AND SEARCHING FOR SUNKEN TREASURE FROM ITS BASE AT VENTURA HARBOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An on-board crane gently lifts the little yellow submarine off the mother ship and plops it into Ventura Harbor . Climbing_down to the sub , a burly silver-haired man squeezes into the conning tower , closes the hatch and circumnavigates the harbor . Tourists on the docks stop to gawk at the strange metal craft , no bigger than a compact_car . Somebody asks , &quot; Can you rent one of those ? &quot; The answer is yes . But your harbor cruise will cost $ 3 # 500 a day , with another $ 3 # 000 for the mother ship , plus expenses . The sub-for-hire is the pocket-size Delta , which , despite its Disneyesque appearance , is a serious research vessel . Certified to dive to 1 # 200 feet , it is used primarily for scientific endeavors -- mapping underwater earthquake faults , tracking crab populations . But the two-man sub is also rented for more exotic missions , such_as searching for sunken Spanish galleons or exploring fabled wrecks such_as the Lusitania and the Edmund Fitzgerald . &quot; I talk to guys every year wanting us to find Amelia Earhart , &quot; says Rich Slater , the man inside the sub . Slater , a 57-old marine geologist , is not looking_for the missing aviator in Ventura Harbor . He is taking the Delta on a short test run before its midnight departure aboard the mother ship Cavalier , a 110-foot utility vessel leased from Buccaneer Marine Ltd . of Ventura . Slater ' s company , Delta Oceanographics of Oxnard , has been contracted by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography to find lost current-reading instruments in the Santa Barbara Channel . &quot; There ain ' t a lot of work_out there &quot; for subs , says Slater ' s partner , Doug Privitt , a taciturn , self-taught sub-builder . &quot; But there ' s enough to keep us busy. &quot; The Delta is one of only a handful of private research subs in_use today and probably the most active , Slater says . Stubby , ungainly but remarkably safe , the Delta has logged 85 dive-days and 318 dives this year and close to 3 # 500 dives in 12 years . The 15 1 / 2-foot , 5 # 000-pound steel cylinder looks_like the brainchild of Jules Verne ' s Capt . Nemo in &quot; 20 # 000 Leagues Under the Sea &quot; but was actually designed and built by the 63-year-old Privitt . It has 19 bug-eyed ports and several protuberances , including mechanical and hydraulic arms . Eight 12-volt batteries power the screw , producing a cruising speed of only 1 1 / 2 knots , a slow walk . British sports_cars are roomier than the Delta . Instruments such_as sonar , a computerized navigation system , gyroscope and Fathometer line the sub ' s interior . The pilot sits on a bench amidships , his head poking up into the conning ( observation ) tower . Wedged in , the passenger has to curl_up in the padded nose section . When the hatch is sealed shut and the Delta drops into the black ocean on a quarter-mile descent , the pilot and passenger look through 1 1 / 2-inch-thick Plexiglas , their field of vision illuminated for 20 or 30 feet by two side-mounted lights . The pilot controls his depth by either filling storage compartments with water or using compressed air to empty them . Regardless of the depth , the pressure inside the Delta remains at one atmosphere , the same as on land . &quot; The sub ' s a simple design , &quot; Slater says . &quot; Everything ' s mechanical. &quot; THE TREASURE SEEKERS Slater figures that 95 % of Delta ' s work is scientific -- it does a lot of diving for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration -- and the rest of its time is devoted to &quot; the wild-goose people. &quot; It seems everybody with a treasure map and a snorkel knows Delta ' s Oxnard phone_number . Slater and Privitt are continually approached by speculators who want them to lower their rates in exchange for a percentage of the alleged booty . Occasionally , they agree . &quot; Gold always sounds good to us , &quot; Slater says . But they haven ' t got rich . Once , they were lured to Florida by a treasure hunter ' s secret map , but &quot; all we found were a lot of fish holes , &quot; Privitt says sardonically . A year ago , the Delta went looking_for the Brother Jonathan , a paddle-wheel steamer that sank_in 1865 off the Northern California coast , supposedly with $ 2 million in gold and $ 250 # 000 in U.S. Army payroll on board . With Chris Ijames and Slater ' s son Dave taking turns piloting the Delta , and Privitt along as observer , they found the wreck &quot; not where it was supposed to be , &quot; Privitt says . &quot; Everybody else had looked in the wrong place. &quot; Is there treasure aboard ? Nobody knows , says Slater , because the state is holding_up exploration of the wreck pending a court battle over salvage rights . Slater has been tempted to go_after the San Jose , &quot; the richest Spanish galleon of all time , &quot; he says . The ship rests somewhere at the bottom of the sea near Cartagena , Colombia . But treasure hunters are deterred by the Colombian government , which would insist on keeping the San Jose ' s contents and putting them in a museum , Slater says . &quot; Some people approached us about sneaking into Colombia , &quot; Tackett says . &quot; No way we ' re going_down there illegally. &quot; Slater says they could pull it off . Privitt gasps . &quot; No way I wanna spend time in a Colombian prison. &quot; The Delta ' s crew faces hazards and potential disaster on every mission , but the sub has never had an accident . &quot; I don ' t have any worries about the integrity of the sub , &quot; says Ijames , a 35-year-old Santa Barbara resident who regularly pilots the Delta . &quot; It ' s a real workhorse -- you can even bang around rocks . My only worry is getting tangled. &quot; In the summer of 1993 , Ijames got tangled . The Delta was diving off the_Irish coast , doing_work for marine biologist Robert Ballard who was filming a National Geographic TV special about the Lusitania , the_British luxury_liner that was sunk by a German U-boat in 1915 . On the Delta ' s second dive of the day , an old line snagged the sub ' s tail at 300 feet . But Ijames didn ' t panic . Privitt had designed a safety feature for this very predicament . Ijames simply unscrewed the tail from inside the sub and the tail dropped_off , freeing the sub , which bobbed to the surface . About an hour later , the crew guided the Delta -- now fitted with a backup tail -- to the wreck and retrieved the missing piece . If the Delta becomes disabled , a 180-pound lead weight can be jettisoned , allowing the vessel to rise to the surface . If some alien force drags the Delta down , it is capable of withstanding pressure at 1 # 800 feet . Leaks do occur . &quot; Minor leaks once a while , &quot; Privitt says . &quot; No big deal . I just hitch_up my drawers. &quot; Enough oxygen is_on board to keep the crew alive for 72 hours and give rescue workers the necessary time to reach the sub , Slater says . But despite precautions and safety measures , tragedy can strike without warning . In 1970 , he and Privitt were each piloting a Nekton sub , a forerunner of the Delta , on an assignment to recover a racing boat off Catalina . After the boat was hauled_up to a surface_ship , it broke_loose , plummeted at an angle and collided_with the submerged Nekton . &quot; There was a one-in-a-million chance of it hitting us , &quot; Slater says . The collision cracked a port by Slater ' s head , and the glass imploded . It gouged the right side of his face and a rush of water flooded the sub , which plunged to the bottom , 225 feet below the surface . Dazed , Slater was able to open the hatch . He and his crewman scrambled out . &quot; All I could think was , ' I ' ve got four kids -- I have to get_back to the surface , ' &quot; Slater said . The crewman didn ' t make_it , but Slater , an experienced diver , ascended for 2 1 / 2 or 3 minutes before reaching daylight , he estimates . He was found floating face down , unconscious and not breathing . He was treated at a Catalina hospital . Slater , whose face still bears the scars of the accident , is listed in the Guinness Book of World_Records under the category &quot; Underwater Escape . . . the greatest depth of an actual escape without any equipment has been from 225 feet by ( Slater ) from the rammed submarine Nekton Beta off Catalina Island , Sept . 28 , 1970. &quot; Slater believes he also has the unofficial world_record for making 2 # 500 dives in submersibles . &quot; Except for the guy running the Disneyland ( sub ride ) , nobody has ever made that many , &quot; Slater says . Slater and Privitt first met in 1969 . Privitt was designing and building Nekton subs for General Oceanographics in Newport Beach when Slater came aboard as chief scientist and sub pilot . Slater , an affable fifth-generation Californian who grew_up in Santa Paula , has a Ph.D. in marine geology from the University of Sydney . The grizzled Privitt has built a dozen subs despite a formal education that doesn ' t go beyond junior_college . Raised on a farm in rural Missouri , Privitt grew_up without electricity and built toy graders to amuse himself . A mechanical wizard who pilots planes and has competed in motocross , he got involved with minisubs in the early ' 50s when he moved to Southern California . He &quot; met a guy with a sub in his garage , &quot; he said . &quot; I had always thought_about making one. &quot; Privitt ' s first sub was launched in 1959 . Privitt , who is married and has three grown children , has made more_than 800 dives in his subs , but his main role takes_place on land , &quot; fixing things and keeping everything going. &quot; Working in his computerized machine_shop in Torrance , Privitt overhauls the Delta once a year . He is currently &quot; doing some thinking &quot; about building a new sub , possibly from titanium , which would extend the sub ' s range to 3 # 000 feet . THE BODY IN THE LAKE In the mid- ' 80s , he and Slater formed Delta . It was a risky_venture : Both had either worked for or owned similar enterprises that had failed , including General Oceanographics . But Slater had spent a lot of time all_over the world and &quot; knew there was a need &quot; for a research sub . Delta received national publicity last summer while navigating near the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald , the iron-ore ship made famous in a 1976 song by Gordon Lightfoot . Filming a TV documentary , Delta ' s crew descended into Lake_Superior to try to determine why the 729-foot vessel sank during a 1975 storm , with all 29 on board perishing . While the dive yielded no definitive answers , the Delta did find a body , which had been preserved under 525 feet of icy water . &quot; We were kind of lost in sediment and were trying to get our bearings when my passenger looked_out and saw ( the body ) right next to us , &quot; Ijames says . &quot; It was like looking_at a mummy. &quot; Ijames also was the pilot on the search for the missing Scripps current-reading instruments last month . He and Paul Harvey , a development engineer at Scripps ' Center for Coastal Studies , looked_for the devices for three days , combing the ocean_floor off San Miguel Island . They found only one of three lost instruments , but Harvey calls the search a success . &quot; We got much more back than the cost of the mission , &quot; he says . Now that their assignment with Scripps is finished , Slater is working_on Delta ' s 1995 schedule , which may include a trip to the Galapagos Islands in the spring . Also in the works is a hush-hush project for a foreign government to find and recover a military jet that crashed in the Pacific . Missing from the ' 95 schedule are rides around Ventura Harbor . &quot; Back in the late ' 60s and early ' 70s we ' d take people on rides all_the time , &quot; Slater says . &quot; It ' s fun , and I ' d love to do_it now , but then we ' d be like a ferry boat and need different registration from the Coast Guard . Because of that and liability , we just don ' t do it. &quot; A harbor cruise would n ' t be that much fun anyway . &quot; It ' s too murky to see anything , &quot; Slater says .</TEXT>
