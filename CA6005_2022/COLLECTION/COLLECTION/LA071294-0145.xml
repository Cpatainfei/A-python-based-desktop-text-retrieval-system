   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : BURBANK ; COUNCIL TO VOTE ON PROPOSED OIL_PIPELINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Burbank City_Council will vote tonight on whether to adopt a resolution opposing the proposed Pacific Pipeline , a project that would transport crude_oil from Santa Barbara and Ventura counties to Los Angeles-area refineries . The pipeline , proposed by Pacific Pipelines Inc. , would follow a route along the Southern Pacific Railroad through Burbank . The resolution opposing the project was proposed by the Burbank city staff and stems from the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake , which caused two breaks along a 35-mile span of the Four Corners Pipeline . One break spilled oil into the Santa Clara River in Santa Clarita , killing vegetation and wildlife . The other , in a residential neighborhood in Mission Hills , resulted in a fire that injured one man , destroyed one home , damaged three others and burned 17 vehicles and numerous trees . Burbank city officials said they are concerned about the likelihood of another break_with the proposed pipeline . The city also has other concerns about the pipeline . Fire_Chief Mike Davis , who prepared the resolution for the city , said that once crude_oil begins to spill , it is very difficult to stop . He said he would prefer that the company find other ways to transport the oil , such_as by ship . &quot; We are going_to have environmental catastrophes , &quot; said Davis , &quot; but we need to figure_out ways to make them small ones . If the crude_oil was transported by ship or ground tanker , the danger would not be so high. &quot; Another problem , according to Davis , is that pipelines designed to transport crude_oil sometimes transport other materials . On Dec . 1 , 1980 , he said , a pipeline in Long_Beach exploded . The cause was found to be naphtha , a flammable liquid the pipeline was carrying . Davis said he fears something similar might occur in Burbank should the pipeline be built . The city of Los Angeles already has passed a resolution opposing the project and the city of Glendale is considering a similar action . The final_decision on the project will be made by the state Public_Utilities Commission . JAMES ELMENDORF</TEXT>
