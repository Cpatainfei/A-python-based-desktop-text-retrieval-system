   <HEADLINE> PERCEPTIONS ASIDE , STATISTICS SHOW A DROP IN CRIME ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : VIOLENT INCIDENTS SUCH AS MURDER , AGGRAVATED ASSAULT AND RAPE HAVE FALLEN DRASTICALLY THIS YEAR , POLICE FIGURES REVEAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Belying the public ' s rising fear of crime , the number of violent crimes on the Westside has dropped substantially in the first 10 months of the year , reflecting a citywide trend . From January to Oct . 21 , the most recent figures available , the number of murders , rapes , robberies and aggravated assaults declined 12.9 % throughout Los Angeles , according to Los Angeles Police_Department statistics . Of the LAPD ' s 18 divisions , only the Harbor Division reported an increase in violent crime , with a 6 % jump -- following a 12.6 % decline during the same period in 1993 . Violent crimes fell a total of 25.6 % in the West Los Angeles Division , with incidents of robberies plummeting 36 % within the division ' s boundaries . There was a 24 % decrease in robberies in the Wilshire Division during the 10-month period . In the Hollywood Division , the number of homicides fell to 24 for the first 10 months of the year from 38 during the same period in 1993 . The Pacific Division reported significantly fewer rapes , down from 90 last year to 57 this year -- a 37 % decline . All violent crimes in the division dropped 10.5 % from last year . Citywide , robberies were down almost 20 % and homicides dropped 24 % , from 866 to 661 . Although LAPD officials say they are pleased with the drop_in crime , law_enforcement officials and crime analysts agree that the reasons behind the decrease are varied . &quot; Crime is an immensely complex , multifaceted problem . I just have to speculate on why this has happened , &quot; said LAPD Deputy Chief Ron Frankle , commander of the four Westside divisions of the West Bureau . The LAPD ' s emphasis on crime prevention through Neighborhood Watch and other volunteer programs is probably helping to lower the rate of violent crimes , Frankle said . &quot; I think people are getting impatient about crime , so they ' re looking_out for each other more . They ' re checking_up_on each others ' homes , cars and businesses , &quot; he said . Mike Markulis , director of the Delinquency Control Institute at the USC Center for Administration of Justice , said the statistics are a positive sign , but it is too soon to call the drop a trend . Markulis , a retired LAPD commander , gave high marks to the police , attributing the improved statistics to the department ' s emphasis on community-oriented policing . &quot; As a department , LAPD has always been very dedicated to getting the community involved , with Neighborhood Watch and beat-policing programs , &quot; Markulis said . Frankle added that upgrading the department ' s computer_system has helped police officials better track where crimes are occurring , allowing commanders to more efficiently deploy officers to crime-ridden zones rather than trying to patrol vast distances . &quot; We ' re trying to work smarter , not just harder , &quot; he said . Part I offenses , which include violent crimes and repressible crimes such_as burglary and auto theft , have been decreasing statewide , said Detective Bob Stresak , supervisor of the LAPD ' s crime analysis unit . The department has seen one of the biggest drops_in recent years in most categories , with homicides going_down by almost a quarter this year , he said . &quot; I guess the base question is why and that is what we just don ' t know , &quot; Stresak said . At one time , Stresak said , he would have tried to determine a single reason for the decline , but now he is less willing to pin it on any one variable . Perhaps more people are obeying the law , he suggested , or maybe improvements in private security_systems are making life more difficult for criminals . Another possibility is that career criminals are getting older and are committing fewer crimes than they did when they were between the high-crime ages of 13 and 26 years old , Stresak said . The seasons also impact crime , Stresak noted . For example , crime at the beach drops_in January or when it ' s cold ; not surprisingly , criminal incidents go_up in July . The Northridge earthquake may have played a role in keeping crime down . If natural disasters don ' t keep criminals off the streets , they keep potential victims at_home , he said . &quot; I wish managing crime was like managing an assembly_line , &quot; Stresak said . &quot; Instead , when we ' re managing the intangible concept of crime . It ' s much more difficult with many_more variables. &quot; But why , if crime is going_down , is the public ' s fear factor increasing ? The problem may lay more in people ' s perception of crime , the officers said . If a radio is stolen from a BMW in Cheviot Hills , the car owner is likely to perceive the theft as a serious problem . But if the same incident occurred in a geographical_area that has more crime , a stolen radio does not generate the same level of fear , Stresak said . &quot; Maybe L.A. is not the crime mecca people think it is . But their perception of crime still creates significant fear , &quot; said Frankle . With that fear in mind , the LAPD needs to continue to look_at many aspects of policing , and not merely remain content with the lower rates , he said . &quot; We need to see that our cases and emergency calls are quickly and properly handled , &quot; Frankle said . &quot; And we need to look_to improve the quality_of_life that is not necessarily attached_to those statistics . &quot; We think we ' re headed in the right direction , but when I see a downward trend for several years , then I ' ll be really happy. &quot; Downward Trend Violent crime dropped significantly for the Jan . 1 to Oct . 21 period this year compared with 1993 .
