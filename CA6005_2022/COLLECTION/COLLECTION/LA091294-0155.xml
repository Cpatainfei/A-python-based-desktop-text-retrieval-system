   <HEADLINE> JAPANESE COALITION LOSES BY-ELECTION BY BIG MARGIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama ' s ruling coalition suffered an unexpectedly severe defeat in the first Parliament-level test of its support Sunday as an opposition candidate won by a landslide in a by-election for a seat in the upper house . Yuzuru Tsuzuki , 43 , a former Labor Ministry section chief who was backed by six opposition parties , won 43 % of the ballots cast for seven candidates in Aichi prefecture . Ruling coalition candidate Jiro Mizuno , 48 , a former U.N. staff_member , polled a paltry 25 % . A female radio disc_jockey who condemned Tokyo politicians for transforming the contest into a national power struggle came_in a close third with 22 % . &quot; The result creates the image that the new coalition is a weak government , &quot; said Minoru Morita , a respected political commentator . The defeat underscored the difficulty Murayama ' s Socialists and the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) had in_lining up their diverse supporters behind a single candidate , Morita said . The two parties -- rivals for four decades -- joined with the splinter New Party Harbinger to take power June 29 . Murayama ' s Socialists face bleak prospects in local elections in April and an upper house election in July , Morita said . He predicted that the tripartite coalition would collapse after the July election . The parties of the opposition , including those run_by former Prime_Ministers Morihiro Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata , will gain a &quot; spiritual boost &quot; in their efforts to amalgamate into a single party , or at least into a single negotiating bloc within Parliament , Morita added . Although pre-election polls showed that Tsuzuki was likely to win , his landslide came as a surprise . Tsuzuki campaigned on a platform of reform : He urged deregulation of the economy and told voters he would improve living standards to bring &quot; wealth that you can feel in your daily lives. &quot; The coalition ' s Mizuno insisted that stability is needed to make progress . The by-election was called after courts stripped a Democratic Socialist incumbent of his seat for lying_about his educational background in information officially submitted to election authorities in 1992 .</TEXT>
