   <HEADLINE> THE NBA / MARK HEISLER ; EXPANSION IS NICE , BUT ALL IS NOT SUGAR AND SPICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The hits just keep happening . Toronto and Vancouver are joining the league in 1995 . Mexico_City is penciled in_for 2000 ( honest ) . Diluting the talent ? Sure , but the Canadians are paying $ 125 million each , up a mere 385 % from the $ 32.5 million for the last expansion class . For $ 125 million , David Stern would put a team in Vladivostok or your back yard , provided you had a new arena . Look_at the bright_side : There should be someone worse than the Clippers at the end of the century . Whatever happened to this delightful league where everyone liked everyone except Red Auerbach and Darrell Garretson ? Item : After years of peaceful labor relations , the players are upset at the owners ' idea of a partnership . They caught the owners hiding luxury suite money , obliging the owners to settle out of court . They signed_away the licensing money for $ 500 # 000 a year and saw the league take_home $ 100 million . Now the players claim they want to scrap the whole deal : the salary cap , the draft , the graduated free_agency system . Stern , gulping in anticipation of his first difficult labor negotiation , actually asked reporters -- &quot; plead &quot; was the word he used -- not to play_up rifts between labor and management . This is getting_to be standard procedure with Stern , a plea to soft-pedal whatever issue is at_hand , perhaps dating to his difficulty last spring when he tried to interpose himself between Michael Jordan and a press corps asking questions about his gambling . However softly you say it , the league has its own demands . It wants the current salary cap loophole closed . If the players fight them on it , the NBA will surely take a strike . Item : The NBA keeps suing and losing . For a league run_by lawyers , these guys are_on a cold roll . They sued Chicago Bull owner Jerry Reinsdorf to bar him from putting games on the WGN superstation . Reinsdorf won and increased his schedule . The NBA sued again . The case is ongoing . They sued the Portland Trail Blazers to prevent them from offering Chris Dudley that one-year termination clause that effectively blew_up the salary cap . The NBA lost before an arbitrator , a special master and a federal judge . Item : The owners won ' t do what Stern wants , either . Reinsdorf defied him in the TV case . The Trail Blazers defied him in the Dudley case . Charlotte ' s George Shinn blew his wage_scale out of the water on a lark , signing Larry Johnson , who had three years left on his $ 20-million contract , to an $ 84-million extension . Then there are the local beauties , Minnesota Timberwolves owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner , who have been celebrating their All-Star season by threatening to move their five-year-old franchise to Nashville or San Diego if the city doesn ' t take_over their arena . Told a new building was a condition of entry , Harv and Marv built the Target Center with their own money but had a little cost_overrun -- from $ 50 million to $ 100 million . When their financing collapsed , they got a loan from a Japanese bank that now runs the building $ 7 million in the red annually . The Timberwolves , of course , are still playing to 95 % of capacity despite stunted growth and remain wildly profitable . &quot; I ' m aware of the irony , but it ' s accurate , &quot; Stern said . &quot; Yes , the team is doing very well . Yes , we ' re proud to have it here , being well-treated . Yes , we really would like to keep it here . But yes , there is a terrible economic issue for the ownership that put it here. &quot; This isn ' t exactly the backdrop Stern wanted for his midwinter night ' s classic , a snowflake logo over the words : &quot; The NBA , See It While It ' s Here. &quot; Stern has taken_over this case , personally . He told Harv and Marv to stop teeing the locals off with threats . He reminded the locals they have already lost the North_Stars , and the Twins are up for_sale . Can you Minnesotans spell g-h-o-s-t t-o-w-n ? And , of course , he entreated the press to act responsibly . Stern is doing OK on this front -- the story hasn ' t yet made &quot; Hard Copy. &quot; This is what happens when you hit the big_time . You make money , you lose paradise . Tell those Mexico_City Caballeros to keep_an_eye_on their contractor and start saving_up that $ 500-million franchise fee . ELLIOTT FOR HORRY : THE DEAL FROM HELL There are trades that hurt both teams but few that messed everyone up like the aborted deal of Detroit ' s Sean Elliott for Houston ' s Robert Horry and Matt Bullard . Horry and Bullard , accepting their fall from the league ' s No . 2 record to No . 26 , reported to Detroit , where they learned that Houston doctors had discovered Elliott had a kidney ailment and the Rockets were holding the deal up . Rocket officials would n ' t talk on the record , so , inevitably , people gossiped . Elliott , at_home in Tucson , had to call a news_conference to dispel rumors that he had AIDS . Elliott ' s ailment is treatable and curable , but the Rockets were in no mood to take_a_chance . They told the Pistons they ' d go_ahead if Detroit put_up $ 10 million and its 1997 No . 1 draft choice , should Elliott go_down this season or next . The Rockets , it should be noted , are known for exacting standards in physical examinations . Last season , they nixed a deal for Greg Kite , who returned to Orlando and kept playing for the Magic . Said Piston Coach Don Chaney , a former Rocket : &quot; It looks_like somebody got cold feet. &quot; The new Rocket owner , Les Alexander , had a news_conference to refute the &quot; cheap shots &quot; he said were coming_out of Detroit . Horry and Bullard reported back to Houston . Horry , asked if he thought he was there to stay , said : &quot; Get_back to me on Feb . 24. &quot; that ' s the trading deadline . The Rockets , who started 22-1 and once led San Antonio by eight games , are a half-game up at the All-Star break . &quot; When San Antonio passes us , &quot; Hakeem Olajuwon said , &quot; maybe that ' s going_to get us to play the way we were. &quot; He said when , not if . FACES AND FIGURES Shut Up , Grasshopper : New York ' s Patrick Ewing , upset at Shaquille O ' Neal for bellowing , &quot; Who ' s the man ? &quot; in a Magic victory over the Knicks at Orlando , outscored him , 32-22 , in a Knick victory at New York last week . Said Ewing : &quot; He ' s not the man , yet. &quot; . . . O ' Neal said he had been yelling to teammate Donald Royal , not Ewing , but stopped short of an apology . &quot; Patrick knows the deal , &quot; Shaq said . &quot; If he plays me one-on-one the whole game , we ' d see. &quot; . . . Just saying no : Danny Manning ran_out his short_list of prospective employers : Orlando ( thought to be the favorite ) , Charlotte , Miami , Phoenix , Lakers , Boston . The rebuilding Lakers are a longshot , but Manning respects the organization and he still loves L.A. &quot; You look_at teams like the Lakers , the Celtics and you know they ' re going to do something to get_back on top . Because that ' s just the Lakers and that ' s just the Celtics. &quot; Men of Teal , where are you ? The Charlotte Hornets lost eight games in a row , finishing the first_half of the season without Alonzo Mourning , Larry Johnson , LeRon Ellis , Scott Burrell and Kenny Gattison , all injured , leaving them with Mike Gminski and free-agent pickup Marty Conlon at center . Said assistant coach ( for the moment ) Bill Hanzlik : &quot; We never thought we ' d see the day when we worried about Gminski getting_in foul trouble. &quot; . . . The Hornets are No . 9 in the East , out of the playoffs , at the moment . A ninth-place finish would not send them back to the lottery , however . They flopped draft choices with Seattle in the trade that sent Kendall Gill to the SuperSonics . . . . Correction : A recent item in this column , stating that the Clippers do not have their top pick this spring , was wrong . In fact , they do -- and it looks as though it will come_in_handy . Randy Pfund , on the suggestion that his Lakers lack pride : &quot; It ' s funny how all_of a sudden a_couple_of Pistons who were championship players seem to have lost a_level of pride . Since Phoenix has lost Kevin Johnson and Charles Barkley , their pride seems to have gone_down considerably. &quot; . . . Utah ' s Karl Malone , upset at being overlooked by fans , wasn ' t going_to the All-Star game until Barkley scratched and he was made a starter . The Mailman was also upset at the home loss to the Lakers -- &quot; embarrassing &quot; -- and the general state of the Jazz . &quot; With what ' s happening now , &quot; he said , &quot; I can see us ( playing . 500 ) the rest of my career . For nine years , it ' s like we fooled everybody and we fooled ourselves. &quot; . . . The Nuggets ' Rodney Rogers hit three three-pointers in 8.8 seconds during a loss to the Jazz . That projects , over 48 minutes , to 2 # 880 points . Said Denver ' s Issel to Rogers : &quot; that ' s how many I ' m expecting you to have tomorrow in San Antonio. &quot; He missed by 2 # 880 , going_for 5 against the Spurs . Coach Phil Jackson , with the Bulls trailing by two at Phoenix , ran the same play_on which John Paxson hit a three-pointer to win last season ' s title . Sun Coach Paul Westphal told his team beforehand : &quot; If they get a three , nobody gets_to come_back into the locker room. &quot; Johnson grabbed Paxson to keep him out of the play , but Steve Kerr wound_up shooting a three-pointer , whereupon KJ almost beheaded him and got a flagrant foul . &quot; He ' s not the cleanest player , &quot; said Kerr , a former Sun teammate . &quot; He ' s got that face and that reputation as a good_guy , but he ' s a dirty player. &quot; Said Westphal : &quot; In Kevin ' s defense , Kerr did not get a clean three-pointer. &quot; . . . The Indiana Pacers won eight games in a row to reach . 500 for the first time under Coach Larry Brown . &quot; They ' re going to be good , &quot; former Pacer Chuck Person said . &quot; They ' ve got a lot of athletes , guys that play hard every night . Their team is 13 strong . They ' re playing harder than all_of the Pacer teams I was associated with . They ' re trying to defend , which is the sign of a team that ' s coming. &quot; . . . Jayson Williams , on the rally that carried the Nets to 22-24 : &quot; I ' m seeing Coach ( Chuck ) Daly smiling . Hell , I didn ' t even know he had teeth. &quot;</TEXT>
