   <HEADLINE> CHINA DETAINS DISSIDENT DURING FRENCH PREMIER ' S VISIT ; HUMAN_RIGHTS : PRIME_MINISTER BALLADUR , ON FENCE-MENDING MISSION , DECLINES TO COMMENT ON INCIDENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chinese police detained a veteran pro-democracy activist Friday as visiting French Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur called_for improved economic ties with China but refrained_from commenting on Beijing ' s human_rights situation . Police detained Xu Wenli at his Beijing home early Thursday , interrogated him overnight and took him into custody again Friday five minutes after he was released , his wife told reporters . The detention of Xu , 50 , comes one week after authorities rearrested the country ' s most prominent political_dissident , Wei Jingsheng . The two men edited underground journals promoting democratic reform during the Democracy Wall Movement of 1978-1979 . Wei served nearly 15 years in jail before his release last September . Xu , considered one of China ' s more moderate dissidents , was released last May after 12 years in solitary confinement . The United States has repeatedly criticized China for its human_rights record . Under an executive order issued by President Clinton last year , China must show &quot; overall , significant progress &quot; in seven human_rights areas for its preferential trading status to be renewed this June . Wei was one of several dissidents picked_up by authorities last month during a visit here by Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher . Chinese officials were defiant in the face of Christopher ' s calls_for human_rights improvements , and Beijing has yet to make_good on the few promises it made toward that end . At a news_conference Friday , Balladur , who had come_to mend fences with Beijing , was asked four times to comment on the detentions of the two dissidents . He declined each time . &quot; I do not wish to add anything on the subject , having said in private what I wished to say , &quot; he told reporters . &quot; You can accomplish more by being discreet. &quot; When Western journalists tried to find_out from Xu ' s wife , Kang Tong , why he had been detained , one of the police_officers around Xu ' s home dragged her away with his hand clasped over her mouth , according to David Schlesinger , a reporter for the_British news service Reuters who was present . The journalists were accused of breaking the law and questioned for about 45 minutes before they were allowed to leave . Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told reporters after Balladur ' s meetings with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng that there had been no discussion of either Xu or Wei . Wu also attacked the United States as the only country in the world that continues to link China ' s trade privileges to human_rights . Such links do not exist between China and European_countries or between China and Japan , he said . He added that he was not aware of Friday ' s detention . Balladur said France ' s goal was to raise its profile in Asia , and increased trade with China is a central element of that plan . Relations between Paris and Beijing have been chilly since France sold Mirage jet fighters to Taiwan , China ' s archenemy , nearly 18 months ago . After the fighter plane sale , China closed the_French Consulate in the southern city of Guangzhou in late 1992 and shut many French businesses out of the Chinese market . Estimates of the resulting lost sales are as high as $ 1 billion . The ban on French deals was lifted in January when France agreed to curb its arms sales to Taiwan .</TEXT>
