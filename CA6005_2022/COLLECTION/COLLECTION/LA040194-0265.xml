   <HEADLINE> U.S. TRADE REPORT WARNS JAPAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States released its annual hit list of world trade_barriers Thursday , and singled_out Japan for special criticism . The trade office was quick to point_out that the report had taken_on &quot; added significance &quot; this year since President Clinton has revived a dormant sanctions tool . Since the March 3 revival of the Super 301 measure -- which has been widely condemned overseas -- any of the litany of accusations leveled against Japan in the report could now be the basis for punitive tariffs some months down the road . &quot; The longest section of the report relates to Japan , &quot; the trade office said in a terse statement . &quot; The section contains examples of progress , but also documents the fact that the barriers in Japan to imports of manufactured goods and services far exceed the barriers of other G7 ( Group of Seven ) nations and place an unacceptable burden on the global trading system , &quot; it said . Indeed , it dedicated 43 pages to Japan -- up from 27 pages last year -- and noted that the U.S. deficit with Tokyo last year totaled $ 60.4 billion , up $ 10 billion from 1992 . The report said the imbalance and a host of alleged trade_barriers have &quot; created enormous strains on Japan ' s trade relations with the United States and other countries. &quot; The National Trade Estimate -- a detailed indictment of 39 countries and regions -- is an annual report_card to Congress on problems around the world . Japan is problem No . 1 and , for the first time since Clinton took_office , this year ' s study sets a clock ticking on possible Super 301 action .</TEXT>
