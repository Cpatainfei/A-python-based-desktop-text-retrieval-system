   <HEADLINE> HER MORTGAGE CHECK WON ' T BE IN THE MAIL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the last business day of 1989 , I did a very stupid thing . Not realizing ( who did ? ) that real_estate was at its delirious peak , I signed the mortgage papers for my first house , a vintage two-bedroom bungalow in North Long_Beach , one of the &quot; affordable &quot; areas of the city I ' d lived_in for several years . I put 10 % down on the $ 165 # 000 purchase_price and was delighted to snag a 30-year mortgage at 9.75 % . I ' ve since come_to the conclusion that living far from friends , night life and good bookstores is a drag , that maintaining a big back yard I never use is a nuisance and that my homeowner ' s tax_benefits essentially are eaten_up by my high monthly payments ( $ 300- $ 400 or more_than I ' d be paying in rent ) and property_taxes . I can ' t rent_out my house because my mortgage payment is twice as much as monthly rents in my neighborhood . So I decided to sell . After having been turned_down for refinancing last year because I had no equity in the house , I thought I had few illusions about the market . But I had no idea how bad things were . Although I still owe about $ 144 # 000 , similar houses in my area are selling for between $ 125 # 000 and $ 130 # 000 . Add selling costs and the agent ' s 6 % commission , and I ' d have to pony_up something like $ 27 # 000 simply to get_rid_of my house . Well , I don ' t have that kind of money -- most of my savings went_into the down_payment and some early fix-up projects -- and even if I did , I ' d be loathe just to throw it away . I ' d heard that many people actually were walking away from &quot; upside-down &quot; loans like mine . But letting the bank foreclose on my property sounded frightening -- a black mark on my good credit rating that might have awful repercussions in the future . Wasn ' t foreclosure just for deadbeats or for people who have lost their jobs ? After talking to several experts , I ' ve concluded that most of the options for homeowners in this situation have major drawbacks in the current market , while foreclosure may_not be the dread animal it appears to be . The most frequent recommendation from experts is a &quot; short_sale , &quot; which permits the homeowner to work_out an arrangement with the lender to sell the property at less than the remaining loan balance . Some lenders say they are unlikely even to discuss this possibility with you until you stop paying your mortgage . At Home Savings , however , homeowners facing financial problems are encouraged to let the bank know &quot; as soon as possible , &quot; according to public relations chief Mary Trigg , rather than waiting until they are no longer able to make their monthly payment . ( In some hardship cases , Home Savings has allowed mortgage holders to skip several payments , which were then tacked onto the loan balance. ) The bottom_line , however , is that bankers will negotiate for a short_sale only in situations of unavoidable hardship , such_as loss of your job , unexpected business reverses or heavy medical_bills . If you just want out , banks likely will foreclose . &quot; If there ' s a good offer and a good possibility that the property will end in foreclosure two months from now , &quot; said Petra Vazquez , foreclosure administrator at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles , &quot; most investors will consider the offer . . . . ( But ) hardship and the loan type play a big role . We had one instance where the homeowner couldn ' t stay in her ( crime-infested ) neighborhood , but financially she had no problem. &quot; Her request for a short_sale was denied . &quot; Each case is different , so there are no set rules , &quot; Trigg emphasizes . But , she adds , &quot; if there is any rule_of_thumb , it is that you have to have a documented economic hardship. &quot; If you have private mortgage insurance ( PMI ) , as do most homeowners who put less than 20 % down , it will protect 15 % -25 % of the loan , says Rick Alkire , owner of Mountain View Financial in Hemet , but the PMI agency has to agree to the short_sale as well as the primary lender . Some desperate homeowners may be tempted to sell their title to a company that promises to urge the lender to accept a short_sale . The company pockets 1 % of your note as a processing fee , and the property becomes a company investment rather than a personal residence . You are told that any losses would be claimed by the company . Sound too good to be true ? Richard Pittman at Consumer_Credit Counseling in Los Angeles , a HUD-certified agency , warns that these companies don ' t tell consumers about their potential for tax_liabilities . Say the bank is owed $ 150 # 000 but the value of the home has slid to $ 100 # 000 . The bank can let it be sold at $ 100 # 000 and take the $ 50 # 000 loss , but according to IRS laws , that $ 50 # 000 is income earned by the seller -- income that should be taxed . &quot; Right now , the IRS says they ' re not sure ( how they will rule on such cases ) , &quot; Pittman said . &quot; This is the first year we ' re seeing these things pounce on the marketplace . It ' s an unknown element . If this client bails_out of their house , they could have a tax lien looming down the road . Whether they ( subsequently ) rent or manage to buy another house , ( the consumer who negotiates a short_sale ) is in grave jeopardy while the IRS is considering their position. &quot; Two other commonly cited strategies -- a deed in lieu of foreclosure and a wraparound mortgage -- are not viable homeowner options in today ' s market . A deed in lieu of foreclosure involves signing your deed back to the bank , thus eliminating the foreclosure process . This tactic is much more common in commercial properties , when more money is at stake . &quot; In a normal tract home , you ' re not going_to have any luck &quot; pursuing this strategy , said Jay W . Deverich , a real_estate attorney with Call , Clayton &amp; Jensen of Newport Beach . In any case , Alkire adds , since the deed is a county-recorded document , your credit can still be damaged . A wraparound mortgage marries a seller with a low-interest mortgage to a buyer unable to find a mortgage at a comparable rate . Common in the ' 70s and early ' 80s , when interest_rates suddenly shot_up , this scheme has been thwarted by non-assumable loans . Most deeds_of_trust issued during the past decade have &quot; due on sale &quot; clauses , meaning that any time you wish to sell , the lender can demand payment of the balance in full . And then there is foreclosure , an initially daunting procedure that seems to be the best way_out of my own dilemma . After researching this article and weighing the pros and cons , I decided to stop paying my mortgage in December . Conservatively estimated , that will give me until late spring to hang_on to my house and bank the monthly payments before the property is repossessed . To be sure , friends have reacted with astonishment and even indignation ( &quot; Isn ' t that fraud ? &quot; someone asked me sternly ) . And , yes , I do worry about the inevitable blot on my credit rating . But I figure that the quality of my life has to be more important than the temporary status of my credit file . Life ' s too short to feel so frustrated , too short to hang_on to a piece of property in the feeble hope it will substantially appreciate a_few years from now . As Deverich explained , if you have defaulted only on the original &quot; purchase money &quot; loan with which you bought a house with one to four units and it is your personal residence , then your loan is considered &quot; non-recourse &quot; under California state law . That means your lender cannot pursue your personal assets if the bank forecloses on your home . There are some exceptions , Deverich says , relating to fraud ( you told a lie to get the loan ) and a murky area called &quot; bad faith waste. &quot; For example , as a final angry gesture , you maliciously damaged your house . But if you refinanced your house , as hundreds of thousands of homeowners did the past three years , Deverich said , &quot; all_of a sudden the magic purchase money protection goes away. &quot; Still , there is hope . If the loan is secured by a deed_of_trust on the property -- as is usually the case -- the lender has two options : a judicial foreclosure ( a lawsuit to foreclose the deed_of_trust ) or a non-judicial foreclosure ( also called a trustee ' s sale ) . Happily , non-judicial foreclosures are by far the most common . They take about four months and involve publishing notices of default and sale in a newspaper . You lose your property , of course , but under California law your lender can ' t sue you personally ( unless you have committed fraud or bad faith waste ) . So you don ' t lose your credit_cards , your wages , your car , your savings or other assets . As the name implies , a judicial foreclosure involves a lawsuit . For the most part , lenders are loath to get involved in this time-consuming and expensive process . They prefer simply to resell the property . At First Interstate , Vazquez said to her knowledge the institution has never initiated a judicial foreclosure . Normally , Deverich said , the only reason the bank would pursue a borrower through judicial foreclosure would be &quot; if they ' re owed a whole bunch of money and the property isn ' t ( worth ) even close to what they ' re owed. &quot; To justify the time and expense involved , the lender also would have to be fairly certain the borrower had sufficient assets to execute against . If you have an FHA mortgage , Consumer_Credit ' s Pittman said , &quot; by their regulations , they have ( the ) right to go_after deficiencies for all loans . But their theory is , if a person didn ' t have enough to work with and had to get a FHA mortgage , what ' s the chance there ' ll be anything to recover ? &quot; Still , Pittman pointed_out that a judgment is good for 10 years , and it can be extended for another 10-year period . So if your career takes an upswing a decade later or you inherit money , you may still be liable for that loan . &quot; It ' ll be interesting to see , as more lenders are facing more foreclosures and short_sales , whether they ' ll consider judicial foreclosure , &quot; Pittman said . Deverich echoes these sentiments . Not only has the court system in California speeded_up in recent years , but property values have dropped significantly , &quot; so the potential deficiency that lenders are looking_at having to swallow is growing compared to past years , &quot; he said . &quot; The incentive is increasing for them to consider chasing the borrower who has assets . They ' re not so adverse to doing that anymore. &quot; If you have a second or third deed_of_trust on your home , the situation is more complicated . The rule is that if the first deed_of_trust forecloses , it will wipe_out the second ( and any additional deeds_of_trust ) . In legalese , the second lender becomes a &quot; sold-out junior , &quot; meaning they no longer hold the junior deed_of_trust . The bad news is that the borrower who signed the &quot; sold-out junior &quot; second is not protected against a lawsuit . &quot; Unless there ' s just a tiny amount_of_money at stake or the lender knows the borrower has no assets , there ' s no reason why they would n ' t bring that lawsuit , &quot; Deverich said . In such a case , the borrower might need to file bankruptcy . Deverich advises homeowners contemplating foreclosure to consult a knowledgeable mortgage broker . Still , he says he believes &quot; 99.9 % of homeowners probably would n ' t have to worry &quot; about being sued in connection with a foreclosure . &quot; My personal opinion is that banks would probably not do that for your normal type of home loan just because there ' s not enough money at stake . Your normal tract house loan is not going_to generate enough of a deficiency. &quot; In calendar terms , you have about six months of breathing room from the day you stop paying your mortgage until the day the bank sells your house . At First Interstate , Vazquez said there is an average of three months before a delinquent loan is referred to the foreclosure department . &quot; If there are some_other considerations ( such_as unemployment or illness ) , we work with people , &quot; she said . &quot; Sometimes , while waiting for their proposals , we will ( hold_off ) for maybe another two or three months. &quot; After that three-month period , a notice of default -- the first legal_action -- is recorded and mailed to the homeowner , who then has 90 days to reinstate the account or sell the property . If it ' s still in default , the bank will advertise the sale of the property , which happens four weeks after the 90-day period ends . So the entire process takes about 120 days . But &quot; there are always exceptions to the rules , &quot; Vazquez said . &quot; We would rather have the property sold through escrow than foreclosure. &quot; Again , however , bear_in_mind that the &quot; exceptions &quot; are created by hardship cases . What about that rule you always hear -- that you have to wait seven years to buy another house after going_through a foreclosure ? It turns_out the waiting period , if any , is &quot; strictly up_to the lender , &quot; according to Pittman . But you don ' t get a free ride . &quot; You won ' t get the low-cost mortgage , &quot; he cautioned . &quot; You ' ll be paying premium rates . You better have a larger down_payment . And you better not have any other credit problems. &quot; What about renting ? That depends_on the landlady or management company . &quot; Some areas are begging for anybody who can come_up with a half-month ' s rent , &quot; Pittman said . &quot; ( But ) if you want be_on top of the knoll looking over the ocean , forget it . . . . You have to be realistic. &quot; If you do opt to rent , try to bank the difference between your old mortgage and your current rent , Pittman advised . Then , when you want to get a car loan three years from now , you can explain to your banker , &quot; Yes , I walked away from my house because it was a losing proposition . But I started saving $ 500 a month and now I ' d like to put $ 15 # 000 down on that $ 20 # 000 car. &quot;</TEXT>
