   <HEADLINE> GARDEN FRESH ; THE SQUASH TRIBE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If any provender from the garden symbolizes joyous abundance and abandon , it ' s winter_squashes . Growing , their vines clamber cross_country , rollicking over ( and up and over ) everything in their path . Ripening , their voluptuous fruits gleam green , gold , yellow , orange , ivory , blue and red amid thickets of bold dark leaves . The colors can take the shapes of rounds , drums , teardrops , schmoos ( from &quot; Li ' l Abner , &quot; remember ? ) acorns and blimpy bananas and pears -- their figures fluted or smooth . Sizes of winter ' s squashes can range from peaches to Cinderella ' s coach . And what ' s the difference between summer and winter_squash ? Just time . Summer_squashes are immature fruits , ready to eat within six or seven weeks of sowing . Winter_squashes have ripened , usually taking three to four months to do_it , and aren ' t ready to eat until late autumn or winter . Over the years , some strains of squashes have proven to be tastier at one stage or another . But that ' s not to say you can ' t eat your squashes any time you please . Cucurbita , the squash tribe , consists_of several families . Four of them produce winter_squashes . It ' s important to know the pluses and minuses of each clan when ordering seeds . And it ' s rewarding to know what you ' re seeing at the market -- you no longer have to settle for tried and true banana squash . * * C . maxima : Generally the sweetest , least fibrous , best-keeping and largest winter_squash . Some will store a year or more , and their quality will hold . Enormous rumpled hubbards ( some gauzy blue ) , flavorful buttercups with belly buttons , big zucchini-shaped bananas , exotic turbans and matte-shelled kabochas that look_like Japanese rice wine pots are C . maximas . I ' m partial to the scarlet-orange , teardrop-shaped Red Kuri and thick , dark orange , ultra-smooth Chestnut . The coach-sized pumpkins are also maximas ( yes , pumpkins are winter_squashes ) . Big Max regularly weighs in at 100 pounds , and its golden flesh makes_good pies . There are pumpkins I heard about that weigh 600 pounds or more -- suitable for Reubenesque Cinderellas . * * C . pepo : Here are the rest of the glorious pumpkins . Large , rosy-red Rouge Vif D ' Etampes , generously round , flattish and deeply gathered , a pumpkin out of a French fairy-tale -- and magical in the garden . A small sugar pumpkin , on the other hand , is Yankee plainsong , perhaps the finest for pies . Trick_or_Treat has lots of &quot; naked &quot; seeds -- with no hulls , for carefree nibbling . The deeply lobed acorn_squashes with their buttery orange flesh , the zany spaghettis , the diminutive green-and-ivory striped Delicatas ( long ) and Sweet Dumplings ( round ) are also C . pepos . Usually C . pepo squashes must be eaten within a month or two of harvest . After that , their quality declines . But pepos are the fastest-maturing squashes -- best choices for areas with short seasons . ( Incidentally , all_the summer_squashes are pepos. ) * * C . moschata : Here are the long , pear-shaped , buff-colored butternuts . They ' re not the handsomest of the tribe on the outside , but inside they have a small seed cavity and lightly sweet flesh that cooks to lustrous orange . Butternuts are among the longest-keeping winter_squashes and they grow easily . Waltham Butternut is tops . * * C . mixta : Little grown except for Green-Striped Cushaw , shaped like a crooknecked butternut , pale-green mottled with dark-green . The flesh is coarser and less sweet than other winter_squashes , but good for baking . Popular in the South because Cushaw ' s vines are vigorous and among the most drought-tolerant . Having set their winter_squashes in a cool , dark , dry , airy place in autumn , prudent gardeners everywhere are now bringing them into the kitchen . A splendid feeling . I once kept an enormous blue Hopi winter_squash in our entry hall for a year , rather than in the cellar . I felt rich every time I looked_at it . * Like so many plants , squashes are easy to grow if they have what they need : Full sun and moist , well-drained soil , stuffed with organic matter -- the happiest squashes I ' ve seen were volunteers on the compost pile . Wait to sow seeds until the soil is warm . I set squashes three feet apart at the edge of the border so they can amble over the grass or along the railroad_ties or down the slope and nobody ' s bothered . Each is beautiful in its own luxuriant way . When the days turn warm , mulch deeply with compost . Spray once a month with mild kelp solution . No room for gallivanting vines in your garden ? Grow a squash in lightweight potting mix_in a five- to six-gallon container two feet deep . Burpee offers shorter-vined varieties : bushkin pumpkin , butterbush butternut and bush acorn . Keep the soil mix moist but not wet , and feed every two weeks at half-strength . Patrol for bugs and eggs_on and under the leaves ( protect with insect-weight floating row covers from the beginning if your area has problems ) . Harvest winter_squashes before danger of frost , when the stalks begin to shrivel , the shell is no longer shiny but dull and can ' t be pierced with a thumbnail . The best squashes are those that seem heavy for their size . * Beyond mere beauty to the eye , winter_squashes give exceptional sustenance . They ' re full of beta carotene ( which , curiously , increases in storage ) , Vitamin_A , Vitamin_C and potassium . And this good eating comes_with remarkably few calories . All winter_squashes are superb baked au_naturel . Even when the flesh isn ' t exposed to oven heat , roasting intensifies the sweetness and best preserves beta carotene . To me , the most pleasing way to eat winter_squash is to pierce a whole acorn or Delicata or Sweet Dumpling or Baby Bear pumpkin with a long , sharp fork , slip the squash on a pie dish into the oven , bake at around 400 degrees until tender , about 45 minutes , take it out , slice in half , scoop_out the seeds and strings , sprinkle over nutmeg and brown_sugar to taste , then sit_down and dive in with a spoon . Bigger squashes must be sliced in pieces before baking . Use a strong , sharp knife or cleaver and concentrate . A rubber mallet helps . Bake the pieces face_up , occasionally brushing with butter or a nut oil . The temperature is the same , but the time depends_on thickness -- anywhere from 15 minutes to 40 minutes . Incidentally , when a recipe calls_for peeled winter_squash , choose a variety with a smooth skin . Peeling a fluted acorn_squash , no matter what technique you use , is maddening . It ' s a shame that using cooked halves of winter_squashes as serving bowls has been done to death . Squash seeds will never go_out of style , though . Toast seeds in an oiled pie dish at 325 degrees , stirring occasionally , until crisp , 20 minutes to 30 minutes . Tonight , we ' ve just finished a supper of my mother ' s delightful winter_squash curry . It ' s snowing outside , but the bright orange sauce mantling white_rice -- with bits of apples , radishes , green_onions , tomatoes , coconut , raisins , peanuts , peppers , cucumbers and cilantro tumbling down the slope -- makes_it seem as though the sun is shining on our plates . Winter_squashes , now that I think_of it , should be called summer_squashes . Their glow is a slice of summer .

Detailed growing information in the last two catalogues . * My mother is not a purist but an artist , and hers is an inventive curry . So in preparing it , I ' m not a purist either . Usually I don ' t consider using out-of-season vegetables , but the more colors_in this composition , the merrier . So if you see an appealing this and that at the market that would n ' t flatten your purse , add them to the heap . The sauce may be prepared a day in_advance , and the condiments ( except for the apples ) a_couple_of hours before serving . We like beer or jasmine tea with curry . Serve with lots of steamed white_rice and the condiments surrounding so people may add what they ' d like . For dessert , why not pick_up some baklava at a Mediterranean deli ?
