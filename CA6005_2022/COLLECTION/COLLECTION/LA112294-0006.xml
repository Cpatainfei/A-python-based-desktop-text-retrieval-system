   <HEADLINE> DE LA TORRE , NAVARRETTE ON 187</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Re &quot; Many a Slip ' Twixt Passage and Enforcement , &quot; Commentary , Nov . 16 : The intellectually dishonest attempt by Adela de la Torre to propagandize the issue of Prop . 187 was shown by her choice of the word &quot; immigrant &quot; instead of the correct term &quot; illegal immigrant. &quot; Citing actions of the Nazis to stigmatize Prop . 187 proponents is extremely offensive and morally bankrupt . De la Torre characterizes Prop . 187 as &quot; immigration reform &quot; ; it has nothing to do with immigration reform , but is an attempt to prevent illegal activities and limit the damage caused by those illegal activities . However , the most destructive part of the commentary is her attempt to racialize the issue . We are told that when &quot; Anglo voters . . . cross ethnic lines to vote for Latinos &quot; this is a phenomenon that reflects &quot; the real political revolution , &quot; but that &quot; the white electorate &quot; ( presumably simply by voting for Anglo candidates ) &quot; still determines the political fate of many Latinos , African Americans , and others disenfranchised from our political system. &quot; It is sadly obvious who is trying to play the race card and divide the state . CHARLES M . MESSALL II Newport Beach * * The piece from Ruben Navarrette Jr. , &quot; At the Birth of a New -- and Younger -- Latino Activism &quot; ( Nov . 13 ) , was unfortunately nothing new from activists of his stripe . Instead of attempting to understand the meaning of the Nov . 8 election ( specifically the Prop . 187 vote ) , Navarrette chooses to ignore possible shortcomings in current Latino positions on the issues affecting this segment of the population . For Navarrette , the fault of 187 ' s passage lies_in not having enough soldiers to vote the &quot; right &quot; way . I beg to differ . While I applaud the prospect of increased Latino political participation , continued alliance and reliance on more government programs to create opportunity may prevent this movement from generating the credibility it so eagerly craves . Government ' s attempts to remedy the plight of urban , ethnic constituencies have failed over the last 40 years . The thought_of securing political clout in_order to re-travel this path seems nonsensical . But liberal leaders and scholars , like Navarrette , never get the message . Instead , I suggest Latino leaders promote private-sector solutions , individual empowerment and less reliance on the government ( from all levels ) , to pursue the real meaning of the American_Dream . The path of separatism , long the chosen route for many Latinos , has not gotten our people anywhere . True economic and cultural respect can only be gained by working within the societal framework , not by the incessant drumbeats of how we are different . JOHN C . HERNANDEZ Claremont</TEXT>
