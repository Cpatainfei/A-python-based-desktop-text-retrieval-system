Now easy-to-use computers_store all_of a library ' s holdings as part of a more efficient way to search for library materials . Two examples of how the library can work : Great Mousse Hunt John Smith hasn ' t visited his neighborhood library in a while , but he is confident he can find a recipe for the perfect salmon mousse . All he needs to know is his Dewey Decimal_System , right ? Wrong ! Here ' s John ' s search : 1 . John uses on-line computer to search by subject ; follows instructions leading him to cookbook section . 2 . Looks_at fish recipes in cookbooks , remembers recipe was in newspaper 10 years ago . 3 . Info-Trac computer contains back newspaper issues ; he finds recipe . 4 . John prints article with recipe . He ' s ready to whip_up a beautiful salmon mousse .
