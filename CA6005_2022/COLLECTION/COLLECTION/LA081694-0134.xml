   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; BOY , 4 , WHO WAS PULLED FROM BOTTOM OF HOT TUB DIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 4-year-old boy who fell_into an elevated hot tub and was under water for several minutes before he was noticed by his siblings who were swimming in a nearby pool has died , authorities said Monday . Jason Nyerges died between 6 and 7 p.m. Saturday at Kaiser Foundation Hospital , where he had been in a coma since the accident Aug . 4 , said hospital spokeswoman Linda Quon . The boy was being taught to swim by his five older brothers and sisters when the accident occurred at the family ' s Placerita Canyon home , authorities said . Jason apparently fell_into the four-feet-deep water when he reached for a toy gun at the bottom of the spa . Because the hot tub was above the pool , Jason ' s siblings couldn ' t see that he had fallen_into the water even though they were only a_few feet away . The toddler was in the hot tub between five and 15 minutes before he was discovered , authorities said . Funeral services will be held sometime later this week at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church in Newhall , said Gil Nyerges , Jason ' s father . As_many as 50 Southland children die each year in accidental drownings , according to Dr. Stephen Johnson , director of Kaiser ' s pediatric intensive care units . Most of the deaths result from stepping into back-yard pools and hot tubs , he said . &quot; that ' s the problem in Southern California , &quot; said Johnson . &quot; It ' s the No . 1 preventable cause of death for children under 5 years of age. &quot; Accidents usually occur when parents are distracted or away from a pool area , sometimes for only the few seconds it takes_to answer a phone_call , Johnson said . Although locked gates and pool covers are helpful , they can sometimes give parents a false sense of security . Swim lessons for small children are also of minimal help , because a youngster won ' t usually remember them , Johnson said . &quot; The only way to prevent drownings is constant adult supervision , &quot; Johnson said .</TEXT>
