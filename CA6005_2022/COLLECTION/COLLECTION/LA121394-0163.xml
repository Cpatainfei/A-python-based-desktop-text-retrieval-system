   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; A DAY OF RECKONING IN ETHIOPIA ; THE MEN OF ' THE RED TERROR ' WILL GO_ON TRIAL FOR AN ERA OF MURDER AND TORTURE THAT THEY RECORDED IN CHILLING DETAIL . THEY ALSO FACE CHARGES THAT THEY USED FAMINE AS A WEAPON AGAINST THEIR OWN PEOPLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They killed , tortured , despoiled and terrorized an ancient country -- and wrote it all down . In ghastly detail . They affixed their signatures and stamped the official seal to their 17 years of tyranny and filed it away . Then they lost a civil_war . Now , their deeds are counted_on 309 # 215 pages , which become court evidence as the new government of Ethiopia today commences prosecution of 3 # 400 officials of yesterday ' s Communist regime on charges of &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; and a roll_call of other malefactions . With the help of the American Bar Assn . and governments on three continents , Ethiopia believes it is undertaking the largest , most richly documented trial of systematic government genocide since World_War_II . The number of victims could exceed 100 # 000 . The number of ready witnesses could reach 10 # 000 . The charges against the first string of defendants consume 296 leather-bound pages and require a full day to read aloud . About 1 # 300 men are in custody ; 1 # 100 are_on bail . The remainder have fled and are being sought . The process could last years . Unique among the accusations is that the government of exiled President Mengistu Haile Mariam withheld and manipulated food aid in one of Ethiopia ' s periodic droughts , employing the cruelty of famine as a weapon to suppress dissent . The trials are probably the ending chapter of the last hard-line government to rise under sponsorship of the former Soviet_Union . All across the exhausted , impoverished and struggling nation , Ethiopians are transfixed and wishing for catharsis . They hope , too , that in this improbable place , the world will find a precedent for trials of human_rights atrocities in Rwanda and Bosnia-Herzegovina . &quot; I never thought this day would come true , &quot; said Tsadle Wodajo , 58 , a mother who lost a 20-year-old son to the former rulers they call the Dergue , or &quot; the shadow. &quot; In her mud-and-straw home_in a village in central Ethiopia , she recalled a police_lieutenant warning her not to cry or mourn her boy ' s 1978 execution , because that itself would be a counterrevolutionary crime and she would be imprisoned . So she held a wake quietly in the dark of night and fed the leftover ceremonial bread to her dogs to hide the evidence of her grief . Terefe Atomsa , 73 , also lost a son . In his cracked , yellowed block house outside Addis Ababa , among flowering jacarandas and fragrant eucalyptus , he recalls seeing a pile of corpses left on a bridge for all_the living to witness . It was the government ' s way of warning political opponents . Terefe said he was afraid to claim the body of his 19-year-old son , recalling , &quot; They would have made me pay_for the bullets used to kill him. &quot; Meanwhile in the heart of the city , at the prison named Alem Bekayne -- &quot; the end of the line &quot; -- the gates were opened last week for two American reporters to enter a two-story octagon blockhouse . Here , 420 defendants , including top officials of the accused Mengistu government , lounge in the warm sun , play Ping-Pong , study auto mechanics and wait for their turn_in the dock and their chance to answer_for an epoch that Ethiopians call &quot; The Red Terror. &quot; The rooms offer courtyard balconies , a shaded square , running water and plenty of books , games and clean clothing . Many Ethiopians might find it strange to know that the prisoners live better than millions of ordinary citizens in this , the second-poorest nation in Africa , a country where 40 % of its 55 million people have no work and where every street_corner teems with beggars . The first defendants to go_on trial and those facing the most serious genocide charges are 66 men -- 45 in custody , the others , including the exiled Mengistu , being prosecuted in absentia . All face death by hanging , if convicted . Among those in custody is former Prime_Minister Fikire Selassie -- seen last week sunning himself on a prison balcony , wearing sharply pressed slacks and a clean sweater . His face was impassive and his steel-gray hair carefully trimmed . &quot; Myself , I hope no good comes_to them , &quot; says prison administrator Theodore Makonen . &quot; They have destroyed a country . They destroyed the lives of millions of people . And they do not feel sadness . They feel as if they were right. &quot; How detailed is the evidence against the accused ? &quot; We have minutes of meetings in which it is stated , ' We hereby agree that revolutionary measures be taken against A , B and C. ' In this context you should know , revolutionary measure was a synonym for execution , &quot; said Abraham Tsegaye , of the Ethiopia Special Prosecutor ' s Office . &quot; These documents , &quot; he added , &quot; specify where the executions should occur , whether in a marketplace before the public or in prison or at the victim ' s home . . . . And we have documents in which it is reported back things like , ' I hereby confirm that your order for the execution of A , B and C was carried_out in the presence of comrade so-and-so and comrade so-and-so. ' &quot; Prosecutors also assert that the meticulous bureaucrats of the Mengistu government left_behind taped_recordings of torture sessions . There are known to be repositories of skeletons . Reports circulate widely that prosecutors have gory photographs and even videotapes of tortures and executions . &quot; This was a campaign of annihilation against all political groups and individuals suspected of being counterrevolutionaries , &quot; Tsegaye said . These trials and these prisoners are the legacy of a brutal civil_war rooted in the Cold_War politics of the 1970s . After 50 years under Emperor Haile Selassie , a dissipated Ethiopia fell to a military coup in 1974 . The proud country is one of the oldest independent nations in the world , and its new rulers were befriended by the West . For a moment , Ethiopia thought it saw a spark of economic revival . But the new rulers , searching for a way to control their people , soon moved_into the Soviet orbit with its ideology of class_struggle . They fashioned perhaps the most rigidly Marxist society in Africa . According to the special prosecutor , the government systematically executed hundreds of students on a single day to forestall a street demonstration . And 600 # 000 Ethiopians were forcibly relocated . Billions of dollars in aid were spent enlarging the army from 50 # 000 troops to 500 # 000 . Friends spied on friends , neighbors feared neighbors . Everyone was apt to be an informer . Deeply rooted Coptic Christianity was suppressed . Tens of thousands fled the country -- the hope of a whole generation disappeared from the Horn of Africa . And the outside world paid hardly any attention . But ethnic dissent in several rural regions could not be crushed , despite the iron_boot of terror , and the situation disintegrated into civil_war in the 1980s . A united opposition army took Addis Ababa and the country in 1991 , and Mengistu fled to Zimbabwe . A new government , part socialist and part free-market , emerged under interim President Meles Zenawi . It sought to piece back together a country where regional and ethnic passions had been fanned to a fever pitch and where the very institution of government lacked credibility . This new administration itself has an imperfect human_rights record but has won renewed respect and contacts with the West . A luxury hotel is under construction in Addis Ababa . It is spring here , and the year is 1987 by the Ethiopian calendar . The sky is pure blue , the breezes gentle . Just this week , an elected Assembly finished work_on a new constitution that promises democratic elections within a_few months . On the streets , where there is heartbreaking poverty and there are an estimated 20 # 000 or more wandering children , beggars ask_for the smallest of coins but will settle for a smile and the respect shown by a short conversation . The better restaurants serve lobster and Italian wine . A restaurant called Burger Queen has a fresh coat of white paint . The genocide trials , says Addis Ababa Police_Commissioner Hassen Shiffa , &quot; are the first happiness the people have had . . . . Maybe they can re-create some confidence in government . The lesson is this : Rulers may be arrogant and kill , but one day they will have to come_to court and answer. &quot; The epic storehouse of evidence and the legal case were compiled with help from several nations . Argentina provided forensics investigators at mass grave sites . The Americans and Swedes provided computer equipment and assistance for cross-referencing of documents . The British and Dutch provided money . But the tribunal is wholly Ethiopian . There are fewer than 1 # 000 lawyers in Addis Ababa , a city of uncounted millions of people ; defense_attorneys say they are swamped . Abebe Worke thumbed through the book of charges and began reading random pages : &quot; Genocide , homicide , homicide , first-degree homicide , homicide . . . &quot; Even on the eve of trial , Abebe said he was unsure how many men the government would ask him to represent . It is unpopular work . His friends argue that the Dergue was so awful it deserves no defense , and he noted , &quot; You can imagine what the aggrieved people feel here. &quot; In some quarters of Addis Ababa , the trials are quietly criticized as just another coldblooded attempt by one clique of African rulers to eliminate its predecessors . In fact , among the charges against the Mengistu Dergue is that it executed its predecessor government , including the top 60 officers of Emperor Haile Selassie ' s administration . And while most accounts say the emperor himself died of old_age while under house_arrest , today ' s defendants now are accused of his killing too . In a comfortable downtown Addis Ababa home , behind gates and a rutted road , Elizabet Mengesha sits in the dim light cast by bare bulbs and weeps for her husband , Debeta Dinsa , one of several men to serve as vice_president under the former regime . Twice each day , she takes him food at the prison courtyard . She protests his innocence . &quot; I was a young_woman then , but I did hear that people were dying in the streets . Yet I know my husband was a loving and caring human_being , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' ve been waiting so_long for these trials . . . . If the government can convince the people that these men are criminals , then they have to go_to jail . But true justice is the judgment of the people. &quot; Ethiopians now are taking_to the streets to condemn the Dergue . More_than 2 # 000 victims marched here last weekend , hundreds carrying yellowing photographs of lost children , husbands , wives , fathers and mothers . It was as if the living and dead were marching together . Others in the crowd bore the scars of bullets , ropes , whips and scalding irons -- and deeper wounds still to their dignity . Melaku Tefera , 33 , hobbled along using a crutch . His leg and sex_organs were mutilated in prison . His father was executed . &quot; These cruel people , these Dergue , &quot; he said , &quot; they shouldn ' t be killed . They should be put_in a museum behind bars . People from all_over the world should have to come see them and know what they did. &quot;</TEXT>
