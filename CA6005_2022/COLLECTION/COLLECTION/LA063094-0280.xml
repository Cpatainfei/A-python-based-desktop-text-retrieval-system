   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : COUNTYWIDE ; HOT-WEATHER PERILS TO PETS POINTED_OUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Veterinarians are warning pet owners that even simple activities such_as afternoon walks can harm an animal during the current heat_wave . Dogs and cats not only are saddled with fur all year , but they lack the sweat_glands that regulate the body_temperatures of humans . Heat stroke is a common result without shade , water and the common_sense of their owners , according to animal shelters . &quot; A lot of people just don ' t realize that when they leave for work and tie their dogs up in the shade that in the mid-day that shade is gone , &quot; said Lt . Marie Hulett-Curtner of the Orange County Animal Shelter in Orange . &quot; Then they come_home in the evening and the shade is back again . So they just don ' t know. &quot; Dogs and cats both require at least double the water that they drink_in winter , Hulett-Curtner said . Since dogs have been known to knock their bowls_over , she advised putting a second bowl , or even a bucket , in another spot . The best protection for dogs is access to a cool garage . And do not tie the dog up unless that is absolutely necessary , she added . That afternoon walk , unpleasant for humans in the heat , can be overwhelming for dogs , said Eileen Pinder of the Orange County Humane Society in Costa Mesa . &quot; Not only that , but the heat of the pavement is so hot on their little paw pads that it can actually burn the skin off , &quot; she added . It is best to avoid any activity with the dog during the heat of mid-day . One of the worst things an owner can do is lock a pet in the car , even for a short time . &quot; A car becomes like an oven when it ' s parked , &quot; Hulett-Curtner said . &quot; Dogs can suffer brain damage within minutes. &quot; Shelter workers will come_to a car as soon as called and will break the windows if necessary to rescue a pet . Owners can then face prosecution for cruelty to animals , she said . Once heat stroke occurs , the dog or cat will pant excessively , collapse and may vomit or have diarrhea from the shock , dehydration and brain swelling , said veterinarian Thomas W . Beighlie with Norwalk ' s Animal Emergency and Referral Center . Owners should treat this as an emergency , he and others said . Cool the dog down by putting wet towels on the legs , head and tail , but do not immerse the entire body , Beighlie said . That can send the body_temperature below normal , which brings_on a whole new set of complications . The animal should then be taken_to a veterinarian . LESLEY WRIGHT</TEXT>
