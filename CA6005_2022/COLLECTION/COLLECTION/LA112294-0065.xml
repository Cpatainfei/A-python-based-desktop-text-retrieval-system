   <TEXT> For nearly three centuries , the region that today is marked on the political map as the German state of Brandenburg has stood_in constant readiness for war . In the 18th Century , these pine-covered flatlands were the parade_ground of Prussian military might ; during the Nazi rearmament of the 1930s , they became the command and control_center for Hitler ' s Wehrmacht . During the Cold_War , when 350 # 000 Soviet troops , advisers and their dependents occupied East_Germany , a full 200 # 000 of them were stationed in present-day Brandenburg , setting_up the state as a sure-fire nuclear ground zero if war broke_out between the superpowers . Today , the last Russian garrison troops are gone from eastern Germany , and Brandenburg has set_about the immense task of undoing its war economy . &quot; It ' s really a break_with the past , &quot; says Roland Vogt , the Brandenburg official in_charge of defense conversion . He calls the state ' s vast , newly vacated military real_estate &quot; a sea of sadness &quot; -- an expanse of decrepit barracks , ammunition-strewn training fields , tumbledown Soviet officers ' quarters , and empty tank ranges , all surrounded by tall barbed-wire-topped fences marked &quot; mortal danger. &quot; Vogt ' s job , as he puts it , is &quot; to create some islands &quot; in this sea . One such island-in-the-making is Pinnow , population 900 , a farming village near the German-Polish border . It was here , during the Cold_War , that 1 # 600 specialists built the Konkurs , an advanced anti-tank missile , and maintained the radar guidance systems used in various other Warsaw Pact missiles and rockets . Today , thanks to western German investment and the prodding of socially conscious bureaucrats , Pinnow ' s rocket workers are engaged in the useful task of dismantling all those same rockets , extracting the propellant and safely burning it off in a 2 # 200-degree incinerator . Pinnow ' s transformation from warmonger to peacemaker isn ' t complete yet , but when it is , the village may prove one of Brandenburg ' s defense-conversion success stories . &quot; They ' re doing a job which is really necessary , &quot; says Joern Broemmelhoerster , an economist with the Bonn International Center for Conversion . &quot; We never had the facilities to destroy these weapons before. &quot; What happened to Pinnow ' s elite rocket works is much like what happened to , say , Southern California ' s Lockheed Corp . or Hughes Aircraft Co. , only more so . When the Cold_War ended , not only did the factory ' s orders dry_up , but the government that had nurtured the plant vanished . To make matters worse , East_Germany ' s central planners had sited the rocket works smack in the middle of nowhere . &quot; Pinnow is in one of the poorest regions in Germany , &quot; Broemmelhoerster notes . &quot; Without the factory , there is nothing to do there except farm . When the Cold_War ended , there were all_of these highly trained people there , and nothing for them to do. &quot; Meanwhile , far to the south , near Germany ' s border with Austria , a private company called Buck Inpar was having difficulties of its own with the end of the Cold_War . Buck , a pyrotechnics concern , had busied itself throughout the Iron_Curtain years making smoke_grenades , flares and other battlefield incendiary devices . Now it too suddenly found its engineers standing around with their hands in their pockets . &quot; Buck was looking_for opportunities , &quot; manager Werner Scherer says . &quot; The only opportunity we could see was in the weapons-disposal business. &quot; At first glance , Pinnow seemed a perfect acquisition target for Buck , for the treaty governing the Red Army pullout from Germany called_for the government-financed dismantling of 300 # 000-odd tons of East_German munitions . Pinnow had the site and the people to do the job ; Buck had the private capital and know-how to refit the rocket plant , and the government , of course , would provide the raw_materials -- the rockets . But in the end , it wasn ' t quite so simple . While Germany has nothing compared to President Clinton ' s Technology Reinvestment Program -- the plan for shepherding America ' s defense_contractors into peaceful manufacturing markets -- it does have a powerful federal agency charged with privatizing East_Germany ' s old industrial stock . This organization , the Treuhandanstalt , tries to see_to_it that the investors preserve as_many jobs and components of the eastern industrial stock as possible . And the Treuhandanstalt was not willing to let Buck take_over the Pinnow rocket works unless it would put the whole , sprawling factory grounds to use , to guarantee at least 750 jobs through the end of 1995 , and to invest at least 50 million marks , or about $ 35 million . In the end , Buck decided that rocket-dismantling in Pinnow looked_like a good_enough business proposition to justify taking_on a number of experimental , non-pyrotechnic sidelines . So today , in addition to dismantling the rockets , Buck is churning_out prefabricated buildings , storm_windows and hospital_beds , as well as developing clean-up systems for polluted soil and water , and operating a nascent hazardous-waste transport concern . It has also become a partner in a hairdressing school . Today , Buck employs not just the 750 villagers that it promised , but 1 # 400 . The same technicians who used to put_together rockets and radar systems have been retrained to build molds , pour concrete and operate state-of-the-art computer design equipment . And the weapons-dismantling division , having just finished its share of the Warsaw Pact rockets , now receives orders from NATO to incinerate small-caliber ammunition . The only problem in_sight is that the profitable segments of the factory are still connected , in one way or another , to the military -- the weapons dismantling project and the house-construction business . Buck ' s prefabricated houses have a ready-made market at the German Defense Ministry because Germany is obliged by treaty to provide housing for the returning Russian troops and officers who until last August occupied eastern Germany . Can such a state of affairs be considered an authentic &quot; defense conversion ? &quot; Yes , over time , says Vogt , the Brandenburg defense-conversion official . He argues that , far from perpetuating dependency on bureaucratic largess , Pinnow ' s current diet of military contracts will simply tide it through to the day when it can find markets for its other products .
