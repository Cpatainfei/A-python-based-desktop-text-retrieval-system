   <HEADLINE> A ' CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT ? ' ; INSISTING THE CRIME PROBLEM IS UNIQUE , PEOPLE ARE EVER MORE WILLING TO ABANDON THE BILL OF RIGHTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> These days , Americans seem to be driven mad by the fear of crime . Whether the public is influencing the politicians or vice versa , a perverse consensus is developing between voters and their elected leaders that we have reached such a catastrophic crisis that we must summon the courage to take extraordinary measures . Some call_for decisions that would cross legal boundaries even the most conservative judges see as clear , bright lines of constitutional protection -- as in the call to legalize &quot; sweeps &quot; of inner-city public-housing apartments to search for weapons . Congress contemplates the death_penalty for drug crimes that do not result in death -- in the face of even a Burger Court precedent that would seem to make such a law flatly unconstitutional . The &quot; three strikes &quot; laws passed in California and other states and now before Congress push the cruel mathematics of habitual-offender status at least up_to the line of &quot; cruel and unusual &quot; punishment . And in recent polls , half of Americans responding approve a sentence of physical torture by caning for a young American accused of vandalism in Singapore . Among politicians , much that we hear is demagogic blather -- not to be taken seriously except as a sign of the pathology of media politics . But to the extent that politicians and public are sincere in their calls_for the new measures , this reflects something subtler , if perhaps more dangerous , in our political life . It is a kind of historical egotism or arrogance -- a sense that our time is unique , so different from &quot; ordinary &quot; times that fundamental changes in our constitutional principles must be made . It is as if we take a conceited pride in our fear as having exceptional historical significance . Though we face serious crime problems in the United States today , we are not in a &quot; constitutional moment. &quot; For one thing , though serious crime is certainly far higher than during the relatively peaceful ' 50s , the greatest increase occurred during and just after the Vietnam_War . For most Americans , the risk of violent crime has been_on a slight , if erratic , decline in the last decade . Politicians and voters will say crime is worse than ever and getting_worse every day . This is false , but many Americans , projecting a variety of social insecurities onto the crime issue , seem captivated by the belief that they live during an unprecedented criminal epidemic . Surely , many are legitimately fearful -- especially of the apparent randomness of some types of violence . But many Americans now seem in_love with the thought of being justified in their state of outrage . Research has shown that a frightening portion of Americans , when asked_in the abstract , are ignorant of or even hostile to provisions of the Bill of Rights dealing with criminal justice . Others say these provisions are , at best , abstract principles that must give_way to the unique exigencies of the time . Some years ago , Yale Law Prof . Bruce A . Ackerman coined the term &quot; constitutional moment &quot; to describe those phases_in U.S. history where social and political forces converged to require fundamental changes in our governmental system and principles . One such &quot; moment &quot; was the Civil War and its aftermath . The end of legal slavery called_for major constitutional amendments and federal civil-rights legislation that sharply altered the demands that the national government could make on the states to ensure legal equality . A second &quot; moment &quot; occurred 70 years later , when the traditional relationship between Congress and the states seemed impotent to deal with the social consequences of a complex national economy never contemplated by the Framers . Under the New Deal , a political consensus developed for federal legislation drastically expanding Congress ' power under the commerce clause , and for a new Supreme Court jurisprudence fitting these laws into a coherent constitutional frame . One reason for these constitutional restraints is that , even if they seem like pedantic inconveniences in particular situations , our judicial_system cannot easily limit breaches of the constitutional rules to specific cases . For example , if the Supreme Court were to permit re-imposing the death_penalty on the most vicious class of drug kingpins , that decision , however limited at the time , could become the precedential rationale for approving the death_penalty for a host of non-homicide crimes that we long ago realized were devices for the most flagrantly arbitrary and racist penalties . Fourth Amendment law has a complex and tortuous history , and many liberals believe the Burger and Rehnquist courts have dangerously weakened Fourth Amendment protections . But if one basic judicial construction of the Fourth Amendment has survived all_the political buffeting , it is the rule that unless police have a warrant , or specially defined exigencies are proved , they cannot enter a person ' s home even if they have probable_cause to believe there is evidence of a crime at this particular time and place . ( The proposed public-housing sweeps do not even meet the probable-cause criterion. ) Breach that wall and it will be hard to resist legal arguments for military-style sweeps of homes on all sorts of government-contrived pretexts , or for highly selective sweeps that seem aimed at minorities . Nor is this concern for unintended consequences limited to judicial precedent . However crazy , the &quot; three strikes &quot; laws are probably not unconstitutional under current Supreme Court doctrine . But in our complex system of separated and partly overlapping governmental powers , legislatures have a bad habit of creating messes that someone else has to clean_up . As they demonstrate their toughness , they bamboozle the public into believing these measures can be had without tax increases or without bankruptcy-threatening costs on cities and counties that have to foot most of the bill for overlogged criminal-justice calendars . Ironically , if one area of American life might justify a sense of unique exigency , it is the inner_city -- where the risk of residents becoming victims of criminal violence is wildly disproportionate to the risk that the middle_classes face everywhere else . But if that urban condition constitutes a &quot; constitutional moment , &quot; the remedy can hardly be to solve the problem by re-empowering the states to impose martial_law at the voters ' discretion . That would not be a constitutional innovation designed to meet changing times as much as a terrifying reversion to a world that constitutional government was designed to prevent. *</TEXT>
