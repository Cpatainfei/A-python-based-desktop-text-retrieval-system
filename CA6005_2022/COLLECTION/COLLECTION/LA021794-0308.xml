   <HEADLINE> BOMBING SUSPECT WAS DUPED , LAWYER SAYS ; TERRORISM : DEFENSE CONTENDS IN CLOSING ARGUMENTS THAT KEY DEFENDANT IN TRADE CENTER BLAST WAS MANIPULATED BY A FUGITIVE IRAQI .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A defense_lawyer Wednesday described Mohammed A . Salameh , the principal defendant in the World Trade Center bombing case , as &quot; a struggling immigrant &quot; who was involved only because he was duped by a professional terrorist who fled the country hours after the blast . Attorney Robert E . Precht , making the first closing argument for the defense , told jurors that the architect of the bombing was Ramzi Ahmed Yousef , an Iraqi who has been charged as a fugitive but cannot be found by the FBI . Precht claimed that Salameh &quot; was terribly manipulated by Yousef , an evil , devious genius who had an Iraqi passport and the wherewithal to conduct a terrorist operation on U.S. soil. &quot; The explosion in a parking garage below street level last Feb . 26 killed six people and injured more_than 1 # 000 . It closed the trade center for weeks . Attorneys for the other three defendants , who like Salameh are Muslim fundamentalists , will make closing statements before U.S. District Judge Kevin T . Duffy gives the case to the jury . Federal prosecutors have insisted that Salameh and another defendant , Nidal Ayyad , a chemical engineer , paid_for the purchase of explosives from a joint bank_account in New Jersey and that Salameh rented and drove a yellow van that carried their homemade bomb into the trade center . But Precht painted a far different picture , saying that Salameh had very little money . Yousef , on the other hand , flew in from Pakistan on a first-class ticket and had his own access &quot; to sources of money in this country and abroad , &quot; Precht said . Without giving specifics on the funding , the defense_lawyer told jurors : &quot; Had Ramzi Yousef ' s activities been traced back to Iraq , not only Yousef but Iraq would be the suspect. &quot; Federal authorities said last year that they had been unable to determine the source of financing from abroad . They said that at least $ 8 # 500 -- and perhaps 10 times that much -- had been wired to Salameh and Ayyad from Germany , which has a large Arab population , but could not trace the funds further . During 18 weeks of trial testimony , the government did not attempt to pinpoint how the funds came_to Salameh and Ayyad , and the two men did not call any witnesses . Defense_attorneys said only that the pair had tried to start a small business together . Precht said that Salameh had come_to the United States from the Middle_East in 1988 and worked in a variety of part-time jobs &quot; to stay here by hook or by crook . He would not have taken_part in a conspiracy to blow_up buildings. &quot; But Yousef , after arriving in September , 1992 , on the same flight as Ahmad Ajaj , another of the four defendants on_trial , &quot; latched onto Salameh , &quot; the lawyer said . &quot; Salameh was doing dirty work for another individual ( Yousef ) , who did not tell him the full story , &quot; Precht said . &quot; He did not know his acts were intended to further a conspiracy to destroy buildings in the United States. &quot; Precht acknowledged that Salameh rented the van used in the blast . But he insisted that Salameh did not drive the vehicle the day of the explosion . &quot; He rented it in his own name , &quot; the lawyer said . &quot; He had nothing to hide . He was innocent_of any knowledge of how it was going_to be used. &quot;</TEXT>
