   <TEXT> Divers searched for bodies in murky floodwaters and rescuers plucked people hanging from a tree Thursday as rain fell_for the fourth straight day in southwestern Georgia . The death toll reached 16 . More_than 300 # 000 people were without safe drinking_water for a second day after floodwaters from remnants of Tropical Storm Alberto knocked_out water treatment plants . Tens of thousands of acres of prime farmland were under water , while cities along the Flint River braced for a record flood . Four people were reported missing , although Sumter County Coroner Lynwood McClung held_out hope . &quot; These creeks went way back in the woods . It ' s possible we could find these people hanging_in trees , still alive , &quot; he said . In Macon , about 80 miles northeast of Americus , firefighters on a hook-and-ladder truck rescued three men from a tree in the raging Ocmulgee River . Residents of Albany prepared_for the worst as the Flint River flowed over its banks and sent water rushing into streets in a low-lying area . At least 14 # 000 residents were ordered to evacuate . &quot; We ' re just trying to reinforce the levees with sandbags , &quot; Albany State College spokeswoman Jackie Ryan said . The Flint is expected to reach 44 feet -- 24 feet above flood stage -- by Saturday . Most Albany businesses sent employees home , and a dusk-to-dawn curfew was ordered . The Ocmulgee was believed to have crested at 35 feet Thursday at Macon , where flood stage is 18 feet . But officials could not say for_sure because the river gauge was swept_away . About 150 # 000 people in Macon and surrounding areas have been without water since the treatment plant flooded Wednesday . Statewide , more_than 300 # 000 people were without water . The Clayton County water_system , one of the biggest of those knocked_out earlier in the week , was back_up Thursday . Water was brought_to some areas by tanker trucks . At one water distribution site , 750 people stood_in line . People were asked to restrict themselves to one gallon per house , but some walked away with five gallons . &quot; I ' ll check with some of my homebound friends to see if they could use a jug or two , &quot; said Mary Eva DuBose , who was carrying five empty jugs . Twenty-five inmates on work-release , wearing white uniforms with blue stripes , helped people carry jugs . Residents in the hard-hit areas were advised to boil tap_water before using it . Some people in Americus bathed in water from their swimming_pools . Water covered almost 60 # 000 acres of peanuts , 19 # 000 acres of cotton and 10 # 000 acres of corn . Crops could be saved if there is a break_in the rain . Peanut and cotton farmer James Short said his land &quot; is rolling enough so that not a lot of it is going_to stay under for more_than a_few days. &quot; Many of the victims will face even more misery after the water recedes because most homeowner insurance_policies do not cover flood damage . Damage to government-owned structures alone was put at $ 58 million . Steve Henry , assistant maintenance engineer for the state Transportation Department , said engineers and divers were inspecting hundreds of bridges and roads , most of them around Macon , Americus and Albany . &quot; There ' s hundreds of people working . We don ' t know how long this will take or how many bridges are closed , &quot; Henry said . Rising waters also have swamped towns in Florida , where officials asked President Clinton to declare a state of emergency in 13 counties in the northern part of the state . Some areas within those counties have been doused by more_than a foot of rain since the tropical storm hit Saturday .</TEXT>
