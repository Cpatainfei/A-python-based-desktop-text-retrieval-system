   <TEXT> The school_board has approved the use of a videotape that encourages students to abstain_from sex . The video , entitled &quot; Sex , Lies and the Truth &quot; , will be shown to high_school students enrolled in health classes . State laws require that school districts include abstinence as part of their sex-education curriculum , said Sally Snyder , the Irvine Unified School District ' s health services coordinator . The 20-minute video features TV actor Kirk Cameron , as well as other celebrities and professional athletes . In the video , they advocate abstinence with the slogan : &quot; Waiting is not a sign of weakness , it ' s a sign of self-control. &quot; &quot; These are people that teen-agers might consider role_models , &quot; Snyder said . The video also mentions that condoms are not always effective in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases . The district purchased one videotape , which health teachers can use in the classroom . The tape , purchased for $ 85 , was produced by Focus_on the Family , Snyder said . Teaching abstinence is just one part of the district ' s sex-education curriculum . Students also learn about sexually transmitted diseases , AIDS prevention and human reproduction , Snyder said . Although the district does not advocate condom use , students do learn about the effectiveness rate of condoms and other forms of contraception , she said . SHELBY GRAD</TEXT>
