   <HEADLINE> ROBIN ABCARIAN : IF SHE CRIED ' WOLF , ' ROSEANNE ABUSED US ALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lydia Bodin has followed the recent travails of Roseanne Arnold with great interest . On April 18 , Roseanne filed for divorce from her husband , Tom Arnold , accusing him , in her request for a restraining order , of violent behaviors and concluding that she has become &quot; a classic battered wife. &quot; On April 21 , Roseanne dropped divorce proceedings , recanted her charges and asked_for forgiveness . Bodin , as it happens , is a deputy L.A. County district_attorney . Technically , the division she heads is called the Domestic Violence Unit . But she calls it Desperation Central . She prosecutes people -- men , mostly -- who rape and batter their loved ones , who tie them up and force them to watch as the children are molested , who lock them in closets and force-feed them drugs , who stalk them , terrorize them , kill them . It ' s ugly work , and it has taken years for people such_as Bodin , people who toil in the depressing fields of domestic violence , to reap the respect and support they deserve . So Bodin was none too happy to hear the news that Roseanne Arnold had recanted her claims of being a battered wife . Not because she wants Roseanne to be battered -- no decent person would -- but because she knew in her gut that no matter what happened between Tom and Roseanne , this was bad news for women who are victimized by the men they love . &quot; I said , ' Now we are going_to hear this argument -- the one people believe because they don ' t want to believe women are getting beat_up in their homes -- that women just lie to leverage themselves in divorce situations . That they don ' t tell the truth. &quot; An overreaction ? Hardly . &quot; The day after I said that , &quot; said Bodin , &quot; it happened in one of our trials . Basically , ( a defense_attorney ) brought_up Tom and Roseanne and said , ' This happens all_the time . This is just family stuff . They make these things up . They say one thing one day and say another thing the next day. ' &quot; The defendant in the case , said Bodin , a man with a history of violence , was accused of stalking his wife , breaking_into her house with a crowbar and a knife and terrorizing her . When we spoke , the jury was still out . &quot; Where I work , we are talking felony domestic violence : serious assault , homicide , permanent maiming , women forcibly losing babies , really ugly crimes , morally repugnant . And we are almost always looking_at a long line of misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence , and these women aren ' t lying_about it . Many of these women have gone_to the courts and gotten restraining orders and they rely_on that system to protect them. &quot; * Ah yes , the system . The system Roseanne turned_to when she wanted help and protection from the man she claimed abused her . But the system can be abused , too . And what , if anything , should happen to someone who abuses it , who swears on penalty of perjury that her statements are true , then recants ? Maybe , in the case of domestic violence , nothing should be done . After all , as Bodin points_out , in 80 % of the cases that come her way , the victim is reluctant to press charges , or recants , or minimizes the experience . Perhaps this is what is happening to Roseanne . Perhaps not . Patricia Giggans , executive_director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women , says punishing people who are already emotionally confused is probably not the best course . This is why police in Los Angeles -- and many other jurisdictions -- are instructed to make arrests in domestic violence calls if they see evidence of abuse or believe it to have taken_place . The burden of having to decide whether to press charges is no longer on the victim . But the idea that Roseanne should somehow be held_up as a symbol to victims of domestic violence is unappealing to Giggans and other advocates for battered women . Who -- besides the Arnolds after all -- knows what really happened ? &quot; And frankly , &quot; said Giggans , &quot; I have outgrown my need for celebrities to validate what is happening in people ' s lives . I hope they get some help. &quot; * Who can know what demons and angels inhabit the imaginations of people such_as Roseanne and Tom Arnold ? In order to work the Arnolds into a coherent world_view , you have to decide if you want to take them as real folks -- an image upon which they have built an extraordinary entertainment dynasty -- or cartoon figures who blow themselves up , drop anvils on each other ' s heads and bounce right back for next week ' s episode . Either way , they have made a grotesque public spectacle of their marriage and , it appears , a mockery of a problem that plagues millions of American women . Too_bad for them . Too_bad for us .</TEXT>
