   <HEADLINE> 34 FIRMS CITED FOR SAFETY VIOLATIONS IN HANDLING ASBESTOS ; ENVIRONMENT : TWO VAN NUYS FIRMS AND ONE IN SANTA CLARITA ARE AMONG THEM . OFFICIALS SAY IMPROPER TRANSPORT AND STORAGE MAY BE WIDESPREAD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a statewide crackdown on the asbestos transport industry , state health officials announced Tuesday that they have cited 34 California companies for violating laws that mandate safe handling of the cancer-causing substance . The state_Department of Toxic Substances Control is seeking fines totaling $ 400 # 000 from the companies , which handled 70 % , or over 333 # 000 tons , of the asbestos that traveled in or through California between June , 1991 , and July , 1993 . Among the firms cited were two in Van Nuys and one in Santa Clarita . State health officials say none of the violations posed an immediate danger to the public because they did not involve release of asbestos fibers . But they said findings of their investigation were alarming because improper transport and storage was widespread within the industry , which handles asbestos removed from houses and other buildings . &quot; Inhaling asbestos fibers is a clear danger to public health , and it ' s imperative that companies engaged in the transport and treatment of asbestos waste do so properly and safely , &quot; said William F . Soo Hoo , director of the state ' s toxics department . The violations were found during a computerized check of hazardous waste shipping records over the 25 months . The investigation was prompted in part by complaints by some asbestos companies that many of their competitors were violating state laws , said Ron Baker , a spokesman for the department . Most of the alleged violations involve expired permits , inadequate records tracking the asbestos or improper storage . In many cases , the companies were storing asbestos for longer periods than allowed . The state is seeking the largest fines , just over $ 25 # 000 apiece , from Certified Environmental Transport of Fontana and CST Environmental in Anaheim . The companies can contest the violations and seek lower fines . Two Van Nuys firms -- Controlled Environmental Solutions Inc. , and Long &amp; Co . Ltd . -- face proposed penalties of $ 16 # 900 and $ 12 # 950 , respectively . Both firms are asbestos removal contractors that also transport asbestos waste to disposal sites . All three of the local firms were accused of storing asbestos waste beyond a state maximum of six days . Long &amp; Co . was also cited for transporting asbestos waste without a required registration . In addition , all three companies were cited for having manifests -- or shipping records -- that were improperly filled_out or were missing information . Martin was cited for two faulty manifests , and Controlled Environmental and Long &amp; Co . for 203 and 47 , respectively .</TEXT>
