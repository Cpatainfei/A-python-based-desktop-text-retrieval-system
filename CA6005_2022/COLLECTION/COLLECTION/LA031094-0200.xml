   <HEADLINE> CLINTON LAUDS U.S. ROLE IN SOMALIA , URGES LEADERS TO KEEP ORDER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the last U.S. troops packing up_to leave Somalia in the next few days , President Clinton on Wednesday said that the United States did more_than could be expected there , even if competing warlords soon plunge the country back into starvation and chaos . Talking to reporters at the White_House , Clinton said Somalia is now the responsibility of factional leaders whose disputes produced a man-made famine two years ago . He urged them to be more responsible . &quot; The responsibility is shifting back to the leaders there on the ground , and they ought to work it out , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; They ought to prefer the life their people have had the last . . . 15 months to what they had before. &quot; Although the Pentagon has made the U.S. withdrawal as gradual as possible , Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , said the departure of the Americans could have an adverse impact . He said there has already been a surge of banditry . Nevertheless , both Clinton and Shalikashvili said Americans should be proud_of the results of the humanitarian operation to alleviate starvation . &quot; Think_of what it would be if we , the United States and the U.N. , had not gotten involved , &quot; Shalikashvili said . &quot; Thousands upon thousands are alive today &quot; because of the outside intervention . The President observed : &quot; The American people have been very generous with their money and with their support . We have lost some of our most precious resources -- ( the lives of ) our young people -- in Somalia because of the nature of the conflict . And I think we have done our job there and then some. &quot; Emphasizing his policy of avoiding most U.S. military involvement abroad , Clinton said the United States cannot be expected to intervene indefinitely in what is essentially a civil_war . &quot; There are civil_wars in a lot of countries in this world ( where ) we have not made anything like the effort we ' ve made in Somalia , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s a civil_war in Sudan . There ' s a civil_war in Angola . There were lots of people killed in Burundi. &quot; Clinton acknowledged that Somalia ' s humanitarian crisis cannot be overcome if the country ' s political situation is not addressed . He suggested that former President George_Bush , who initiated U.S. involvement , may_not have realized that . &quot; If you go_back to 1992 , this whole mission was billed as a humanitarian mission , and the first time President Bush spoke with me about it , he said he thought maybe they would be out before I was inaugurated or by the end of January . And what we learned from that , of course , is that -- at least in the case of Somalia and many other cases -- you can ' t have a humanitarian mission divorced from the political problems of the time . &quot; The people in Somalia were starving not because there was no food that could be given to them . They were starving because of the political and military conflicts consuming the country , &quot; he said . Times staff writer Art Pine contributed to this report .</TEXT>
