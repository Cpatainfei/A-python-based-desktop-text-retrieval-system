   <HEADLINE> NORTHRIDGE HURTING ITS OWN CAUSE ; COLLEGE FOOTBALL : BOYCOTT PLACES EMBATTLED PROGRAM IN FURTHER DANGER OF BEING ELIMINATED TO EASE SCHOOL ' S BUDGET CRISIS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the court of opinion , the Cal State Northridge football_team isn ' t making any points in its quest to survive the budgetary knife , Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said Friday . The off-field problems that have plagued the team this fall might ultimately be a factor when the school ' s looming athletic budget_deficit is addressed with senior school administrators before the end of the year . The football_team could face elimination under at least one budget scenario for 1995-96 , and the negative publicity hasn ' t exactly engendered support in the community or on campus , Hiegert said . &quot; The actions of the team and some of its members aren ' t helping people look favorably upon the program ' s future , &quot; Hiegert said . In a season marked by controversy , the team suffered another black_eye when 16 players boycotted practice Tuesday . The players returned the following day and none were suspended . Coach Bob Burt declined to reveal the reasons for the boycott or the resulting disciplinary action . Players also staged a boycott of practice last season . &quot; They are understandably not helping their own cause , &quot; Hiegert said . &quot; You hope that a decision on football won ' t be made based on those people ' s actions. &quot; The walkout is merely the latest hurdle for Burt , whose team is 3-5 and has lost three in a row heading into today ' s game against Northern Arizona . Earlier this season , Northridge came under scrutiny when starting offensive lineman Jonathan Beauregard was charged with two counts of attempted murder . In a decision that caused considerable backlash , Northridge declined to suspend Beauregard , who is out on bail and continues to play . When a controversial athletics fee referendum was defeated by student vote last month , players removed the Matador logos from their helmets and announced they were playing for themselves . The action took_place before a homecoming crowd that included President Blenda J . Wilson . With respect_to the latest setback , Burt said he would decide shortly before the game whether the 16 who boycotted would be allowed to play . Hiegert said he would not intervene . &quot; I ' m watching the whole_thing and I have my own opinion on how it should be handled , but the course of action he ' s taking is_well within his jurisdiction as coach , &quot; he said . Burt , in his ninth season at Northridge , said he has grown weary of the negative publicity -- and his actions support his words . Burt exploded angrily Wednesday , accusing reporters of &quot; invading the privacy of my family. &quot; &quot; It ' s been a frustrating deal for a lot of folks , &quot; Hiegert said . &quot; Athletics are not for the weak of heart. &quot;</TEXT>
