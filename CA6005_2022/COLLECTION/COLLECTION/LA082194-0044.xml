   <HEADLINE> A FATHER ' S CRUSADE ; EIGHT YEARS AFTER A CHP OFFICER MURDERED HIS DAUGHTER , SAM KNOTT IS STILL TRYING TO CHILDPROOF THE WORLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At about 9:45 p.m. on a Saturday , two nights past the Christmas of 1986 , Sam and Joyce Knott were seized by a living nightmare without pity or precedent . Their 20-year-old daughter , Cara , was guiding her white VW Bug along Interstate 15 , San Diego ' s interior freeway , back to her home_in El Cajon . She had just spent two days in Escondido playing nursemaid to her boyfriend , Wayne Bautista , who was ill with the flu . Her trip should have taken 40 minutes . The San Diego State honor student was eager to get home -- newlywed older sister Cindy and husband Bill were temporarily living with Cara and her parents . A second older sister , Cheryl , was also at_home , and brother John , the &quot; baby , &quot; was spending his first holiday season home after heading_off to college . Cara and Cheryl had commiserated over the fact that this might well be &quot; the last of the Great Knott Family Christmases , &quot; shindigs locally famous for their elaborate staging and panache . Cara had phoned Sam and Joyce a little after 8 let them know she was leaving . Cara always phoned ; it was a lesson Sam had drummed into his daughter since her earliest days behind the wheel . Thus when she failed to show_up by 9:45 , an alarm_bell went_off inside him . He had Cheryl alert police agencies , then organized a search_party , employing the meticulous attention to detail that had made him successful as both a hospital administrator and , more recently , investment counselor . Through the wee hours and into the frigid dawn , the family members drove , crisscrossing the two freeways Cara always took_on her trip . They checked each exit , peering through the webby fog that had strung itself like a series of tennis nets between the rocky hills framing the roads . When that proved fruitless , they expanded their search to adjacent parks and mini-malls . Nothing . Sam Knott came_home briefly to make more calls to the police and was stunned by the dispatchers ' lack of interest . The responses he got varied from the glib ( &quot; girls will be girls &quot; ) to the insolent ( &quot; If I had a dollar for every call I got_about a missing person , I could retire &quot; ) . At sunup , Cindy and Bill made their second pass at an exit just north of Mira Mesa , the approximate midpoint of Cara ' s journey . They had given it short_shrift the first time around because the off-ramp led only to roads then under construction . But there , in a small dirt cul-de-sac far from the reassuring bustle of the freeway , Cindy Knott and Bill Weick found Cara ' s abandoned VW . Looking_up , they noted the sign above the exit : Mercy Road . The couple promptly phoned the San Diego Police_Department ; the cops took 40 minutes to show_up , with Sam in hot pursuit . Leaning_on his Olds Cutlass , Sam Knott watched one of the officers walk to the middle of the bridge that traversed a 65-foot canyon . He saw the young policeman glance down and hurriedly motion to a comrade . For a moment , the two officers conferred . Then they returned to their patrol_car , opened the trunk and pulled on surgical gloves . It was an image that required no explaining , an image Sam knew , in that moment , he would never be able to purge from his mind . At the base of the craggy canyon lay Cara Knott . It was later determined that she had been incapacitated with a terrible blow to her forehead , then strangled with a rope and dumped over the steep side of the freeway access_road . &quot; She looked , &quot; as one officer put it , &quot; like a frozen Milky Way that ' s been slammed against a table. &quot; The murder of the All-American girl was the lead item in Sunday ' s newscasts . The next evening , in an effort to calm female motorists , the California Highway Patrol agreed to provide viewers with a primer in highway safety . To do the ride-along segment , they tabbed an oft-commended 13-year-veteran , Craig Alan Peyer , who had served as the department ' s de_facto media rep on previous occasions . It was only fitting that Peyer do the piece anyway , as the crime had occurred on his beat . In his solemn , resonant voice , Peyer warned female motorists to &quot; stay in your vehicle and lock all doors . Even if you have to wait all night , it ' s better to be in the safety of your vehicle than to try to walk and get assistance . Anything can happen . Being a female , you can be raped , robbed , all_the way to where you could be killed. &quot; At this point , the case twisted into the realm of soap_opera . By the dozens , young_women across San Diego began picking_up their phones to report odd nighttime encounters with a CHP officer at Mercy Road ; a_couple_of the calls came_to Sam Knott . The women told of being detained by this officer , in the foreboding stillness beneath I-15 , for up_to 90 minutes . During these interludes he engaged them in &quot; general chit-chat &quot; ( as one detainee phrased it ) that bore scant relevance to minor equipment infractions for which they supposedly were stopped . Many of the women resembled Cara . Almost all_of them drove small cars . A few of them owned Cara Knott ' s exact model VW . An after-hours search of the officer ' s patrol_car yielded a damning length of rope . A check of his duty log revealed a stark absence of activity during the period when Cara had been killed . On Jan . 15 , Officer Craig Peyer , the Border Division ' s star officer and sometime safety spokesman , was arrested and charged with the murder of Cara Knott . After two trials ( the first ended in a hung jury ) , Peyer was found guilty in June , 1988 , making him the only CHP officer ever convicted of committing a first-degree homicide while on_duty . Sam Knott had been having trouble enough forgiving law_enforcement agencies for their inaction on the night of Cara ' s disappearance . The arrest of a police_officer was a horror that tore at the faith of a man brought_up to believe that life worked in an orderly , righteous manner . In the end , the men and women who promised to protect and serve had done neither . Drifting between anguish and rage , Sam began making inquiries of_his_own . The deeper he got_into official procedures and protocols , the more clearly he saw the flaws that culminated in his daughter ' s brutal death . He gathered his family around him and told them , &quot; We are going_to change the system , so maybe this will never happen again. &quot; As he had done on the night of Cara ' s disappearance , Sam took_charge : He and his family would become the agents of change in an indifferent society . He would put himself before anyone who would listen , write letters to police_chiefs and the president . He would let nothing stop him , not the searing pain of two tense criminal trials , not the ignominy of having to put a dollar value to his daughter ' s life in his civil suit against the state . More_than seven years later , Sam remains faithful to the oath he swore on Cara ' s behalf . Though his actions have caused laws to be changed and policies revised , there are other laws and other policies that still need changing if Sam is to realize his vision of safer freeways and more accountable police . And if the circumstances of his daughter ' s death showed him anything , it was that he could trust no one else to do what needed to be done . &quot; At the criminal trial , the jury ' s responsibility was to determine whether The Monster was the perpetrator . . . . It is possible , for example , that the jury concluded that regardless how Cara arrived_at the bottom of the Mercy Road off-ramp , The Monster was the one who killed her , based on physical evidence linking The Monster to Cara and based on The Monster ' s conduct after the killing. &quot; The name Peyer does not pass Sam Knott ' s lips . Ever . In talking , in testifying -- even this day at a San Diego Denny ' s , Sam substitutes &quot; The Monster &quot; each time he comes_across the offending word . He does_it matter-of-factly , without special emphasis , exactly as if The Monster were Craig Peyer ' s given name . &quot; It ' s part of my therapy , &quot; he explains , but it ' s more_than that : It ' s an expression of Sam ' s allegorical world_view . There are monsters out there . And one must be ever vigilant , take every precaution and then some or the monsters will overcome the forces of good . Surely among the latter group was Cara Knott . By all accounts , she was the kind of kid who , in the course of a week , might finish first at a track_meet , then visit a neighborhood kid who wasn ' t feeling well , then stop by the local senior_citizens center , then attend a rally on behalf of an endangered species . &quot; Her name means precious , and she was , &quot; says Jaime Bautista , the man who might have become her father-in-law . Sam took great pains to indoctrinate his youngest daughter in the ground_rules of a precarious world . &quot; that ' s the overriding tragedy in this tragedy , &quot; notes Paul Pfingst , the prosecutor who secured Peyer ' s conviction . &quot; Here ' s a girl who did everything right . And she ends_up getting killed by a cop. &quot; Such is the central irony in Sam ' s liability suit against the state . Filed initially in August , 1987 , the suit seeks to hold the CHP and the state liable for his daughter ' s death . Having made the usual rounds of the judicial_system , it is now pending in California Supreme Court ; oral arguments should be under way by fall . If the court rules_in Knott ' s favor , it could have a seismic impact on the question of municipal liability for misdeeds by public employees and on the state ' s right to offer testimony during civil proceedings that contradicts testimony in earlier criminal proceedings . The civil suit is one of Sam ' s two most high-profile crusades . The other -- installation of an automated tracking system to keep tabs on police_officers -- is fraught with controversy . Together , the two pursuits command as much as three days out of each Sam Knott week . Because of such absorption , the years have changed him . The gray hair is thinner , the face fleshier ; the shoulders seem less chiseled than the set that carried the Knott family through two grueling criminal trials of 1988 . Hip replacement surgery has left the 56-year-old with a noticeable hobble that , in another man , might serve as metaphor for what he ' s been through . But the handshake is unyielding , the familiar azure eyes are no less so . That much has not changed : When Sam Knott looks_at you , you do not look_away . And there is that gravelly voice , adding a distinct macho bite to the nonstop philosophizing for which he is known . The effect of the eyes and voice working in concert can be downright chilling . As the waitress hands him his iced_tea , Sam smiles warmly and thanks her ; then the smile abruptly wilts as he puts_down the glass , fixes his interviewer with that stare , pulls his lips tight against his teeth and snarls : &quot; It ' s more functional , if you want to take the moral high ground , to get your hands on the system than on The Monster ' even though you have all these human elements that want to get their hands on The Monster. &quot; In the earliest days after the murder , an understandably shaky Sam had yet to find his true agenda , so he ran_on instinct , mounting a scattershot counterattack against the seemingly gratuitous pain victims were forced to suffer in the aftermath of such a tragedy . Fuming over the perfunctory handling given the Knotts ' pleas for help on the night of Cara ' s disappearance , Sam paid a visit to San Diego Police_Chief Bill Kolender shortly after the murder . &quot; Nobody will take a report , &quot; Sam told him . &quot; They just turn you away . And they ' re not even polite about it. &quot; Wryly , he added , &quot; If someone takes your car or your purse , the police jump in immediately . But if your daughter turns_up missing . . . . &quot; Kolender agreed to prevail upon his missing-persons unit to be more sensitive in the future . A CalTrans official remembers Sam storming into his office &quot; a week or so &quot; after the murder , saying , &quot; We have to close that exit . It ' s a hot spot for druggies and rapists . It ' s unlit . It ' s unsafe . It leads nowhere. ' &quot; Throughout the meeting , Sam maintained his trademark eye_contact and spoke with a conviction that left the functionary thinking , I guess this is just how things are gonna be . The exit got shut_down within weeks . Sam had little time to savor such victories . Everywhere he turned , he saw opportunities for his &quot; revictimization. &quot; On Feb . 5 , 1987 , he picked_up his morning copy of the San Diego Union to find a grim Page One account of Cara ' s autopsy . Most of this information had been kept_from Sam , and as he pored through the account detailing the crushed bones and ruptured organs , he was overcome . Not just with grief , but fury . How could the coroner ' s office put this sort of information on 250 # 000 San Diego doorsteps without first giving at least a courtesy notification to the immediate family ? He drafted a letter to Brian Bilbray , chairman of the County Board of Supervisors , asking his cooperation in bringing_about a &quot; more dignified and civilized &quot; procedure &quot; so that other victims ' families will not have to endure this outrage. &quot; The policy was promptly changed . &quot; You can ' t delegate any of this , &quot; Sam is saying while his sandwich and fries grow cold . &quot; You think you can but you can ' t . Oh , there ' s plenty of people who ' ll ostensibly get_behind you and say ' great idea. ' It ' s like the first guy through the barricade : Everybody ' s yelling ' Yeah , go_ahead , go get ' em ! ' But they ' re yelling this from behind the barricade. &quot; &quot; Sam is relentless . Sam is thorough . Sam is unstoppable , &quot; says San Diego Mayor Susan Golding , who has found herself across a table from him on various occasions since 1987 , when she was a county supervisor . Relentless . Hearing of a plan to plea-bargain the case down to second-degree murder , Sam began making regular visits to the court building . Prosecutor Joseph Van Orshoven and District_Attorney Ed Miller would look_out into the corridor and there was Sam , a subtle , often silent reminder of their duty , writing poems to his fallen daughter . &quot; If you ' re physically there , &quot; Sam explains , &quot; it becomes ' What do we do with this guy ? ' &quot; What Miller and Van Orshoven did was go_to trial . Thorough . The hung jury left Sam so frustrated that he had seven jurors come_over the house for his own private debriefing on their deliberations . &quot; You ' d think the D.A. ' s office would have done this , &quot; he says , &quot; but they never did. &quot; Armed with that information and his own list of the prosecutor ' s evidentiary oversights and tactical foul-ups , Sam persuaded new prosecutor Paul Pfingst to open a pipeline between the Knotts and the D.A. ' s office , and the two men shared ideas on everything down to the placement of court exhibits . &quot; Sam was probably the most involved victim I ' ve ever encountered , &quot; recalls Richard D . Huffman , the judge who presided over both trials . Unstoppable . In 1987 , Dr. Carole Jenny , then affiliated with the Sexual Assault Center at Seattle ' s Harborview Medical_Center , told Sam that she ' d been trying_for almost two years to get the government to fund her research on DNA typing . So Sam Knott spearheaded the nation ' s first federal grant for a university forensics lab specializing in DNA analysis . He methodically worked the Washington bureaucracy until he found the individual responsible_for shepherding such grants through the system . Sam told the man , &quot; I need this technology for the blood evidence against The Monster that murdered my daughter . Let me bring my family to Washington to plead my case. &quot; He didn ' t have to leave El Cajon . The grant to the Sexual Assault Center was approved Oct . 1 , 1987 . Family observers add another word : retentive . Of an incident that took_place six years ago , he will say , &quot; I went_up there on a Friday , it was about 2:15. , &quot; As his sister , Jean Thompson , once remarked , &quot; Whatever you do , don ' t lie to him , because he ' ll remember what you told him the first time , and he ' ll catch you up. &quot; Sam ' s remarkable memory gives his words an immediacy that belies the fact that Cara ' s death took_place two presidential Administrations ago . When he leans_back in his seat at Denny ' s to describe the climax of his all-night search for Cara , his gaze moves off to some distant point , his voice slows from its customary staccato to a hypnotic monotone , and one senses that he is actually back there , reliving it all for the thousandth time : &quot; After eight , nine hours on_the_road , I ' m on the west_side of I-15 , on Penasquitos Boulevard . So here ' s Penasquitos , and I ' m coming_along the side_road and it ' s just before 6 o ' clock and I see this black-and-white come racing down the road . So I chase_after it , I ' m right on his bumper flashing my lights and he gets right on the freeway then gets right off here at Mercy Road. &quot; In the months after the murder , detectives noted that Sam would talk to Cara as if she were standing beside him . For Sam Knott , the hands of time remain forever frozen at 8:30 a.m. Dec . 28 , 1986 . During the 18 months it took_to convict Craig Peyer , the Knotts had put their lives on hold . Sam worked sporadically if at all . Joyce went_on leave from her post as a hospital nutritionist . Cindy and John took_time_off from school . Cheryl , the family firebrand , stayed close to San Diego , a major concession for someone who on any given day was likely as not to turn_up at some archeological dig_in Borneo . For Joyce and the rest of the family , Peyer ' s conviction and 25-year-to-life prison sentence ended -- or at least resolved -- a horrific chapter in their lives . For Sam , the end of the criminal trial merely freed up his calendar for the burgeoning slate of initiatives that has begun making increasing demands on his time in recent months . Enter Larry Stirling . The La Mesa Assemblyman had been deeply moved by his constituent ' s plight , and as an architect of the city ' s police dispatch system , he was shocked at the way it let the Knotts down . &quot; The police had always had this policy of waiting 48 hours before getting involved in a missing-persons case , &quot; says Stirling , now a judge . &quot; The theory was that 70 % of the kids are found within 48 hours . But what about the other 30 % ? &quot; In March , 1987 , Stirling invited Sam to come_to Sacramento . The Knott family looked_on stoically as Stirling recounted their story to the Assembly , then led his colleagues through a brief ceremony in Cara ' s honor . The session produced two landmark laws . One effected a major tactical shift , elevating missing-persons reports to a priority status above crimes against property . It also mandated training to improve the handling and routing of such calls . The second bill required the Highway Patrol to respond to calls , like the Knotts ' , that clearly fall within its jurisdiction . Gathering steam , the Knott-Stirling juggernaut rolled on to another of Sam ' s pet peeves : bail . Sam had been horrified when Peyer was set_free on $ 1-million bail . He and Stirling brainstormed the first_state law compelling judges to consider public safety in setting bail . &quot; Crazy as it sounds , &quot; says Stirling , &quot; in the past , defendants even in murder cases could get low bail simply because they ' d kept all their previous court appointments. &quot; Sam was no less dismayed when Peyer was declared a legal indigent , entitling him to no-cost legal_representation . Craig Peyer ' s quarter-million-dollar house was not counted in reckoning his assets for purposes of declaring him indigent . Sam wanted real_property to be taken_into_account when determining eligibility for free representation . It took a year before such a measure was passed , by which time the question had become moot for the Knotts -- Peyer was already on_trial , his high-gloss , court-appointed legal team at his side -- but Sam got his wish . Sam eventually wrote poems lionizing Stirling for his role in the flurry of new legislation , but looking_back , the ex-lawmaker gives Sam all_the credit : &quot; His leadership , his strength so galvanized everybody in Sacramento that it was like a bright shining light . It became undeniable that these things had to be done. &quot; Although there could be no dismissing the fruits of his &quot; Sacramento phase , &quot; Sam remained troubled . Missing-persons laws were unlikely to abort a tragic episode in real time . He returned to an idea that had began to take_shape in Sam ' s mind within days of Cara ' s murder , when he heard from a young_woman who ' d been stopped by Peyer at Mercy Road . Sam got_to thinking : What sort of system was in place to make_sure officers were where they were supposed to be , doing what they were supposed to be doing ? He found that although officers were obliged to report in at regular intervals , and had to maintain a log -- &quot; 8:10-8:22 , removing boxes from the freeway &quot; -- there was no objective means of tracking them . &quot; UPS knows where your package is , &quot; quips Sam , &quot; but the police , they don ' t know where their police_officer is. &quot; Sam raised the issue with anyone who would listen . He told Mayor Maureen O ' Connor and her successor , Golding . He told San Diego Sheriff Jim Roache . He told then-Sen . Pete Wilson . He told the County Board of Supervisors , long and often . More recently , he told Bill_Clinton . &quot; What people don ' t realize is , basically the system is already in place , &quot; he says , referring to the $ 8-billion global positioning satellites launched by the Pentagon to coordinate troop movements and now in perpetual orbit about the globe . Sam envisions a system in which a device mounted in law-enforcement vehicles would bounce a signal off a satellite to a central tracking station , pinpointing the location of every car at every moment . &quot; They ' re up there , they ' re paid_for , they ' re waiting to be used . It ' s a no-brainer. &quot; He says he has even offered to install a pilot_program at his own expense . No takers thus far . But evidence from the scattered tracking applications that do exist suggests that they might not be the panacea Sam envisions . &quot; He gets a little over-enthusiastic sometimes , &quot; says commander Gene Norden of the Irvine Police_Department , whose tracking system was on-line almost a year before the murder . &quot; He ' ll have people call me so we can tell them what our program is about . He ' s extremely high on it -- maybe too high , thinking it does things it doesn ' t do. &quot; Norton doubts that the Irvine system would have made a difference in Cara ' s case . Former CHP Border Division Chief Ben Killingsworth claims he actually began investigating tracking before Cara was killed , and concluded that the less-sophisticated tracking systems then available would not work very well in hilly San Diego . But &quot; you couldn ' t tell that to Sam , &quot; he adds . But when the CHP experimented with satellite tracking in 1993 , deputy commissioner Dwight Hemick admitted that the system was being field-tested in San Diego &quot; in deference to Sam ' s concerns. &quot; And in June , Sam ' s seven-year pitch to the Board of Supervisors paid its first dividends . The board voted to explore funding for an omnibus $ 80-million radio-communications package linking all local law_enforcement and fire agencies -- a package that includes a vehicle tracking system . Activism among so-called &quot; homicide survivors &quot; -- the oxymoronic phrase used to refer to the families of murder victims -- is nothing new . After the savage murder of her daughter Sharon , the late Doris Tate founded an an influential crime-victims advocacy group . Candy Lightner ' s rage over her daughter ' s death at the hands of a habitual drunk driver evolved into Mothers Against Drunk Driving , whose effect on the national attitude toward drunk driving has been incalculable . The harrowing abduction-murder of John Walsh ' s young son , Adam , catapulted Walsh to media celebrity , which he used as a platform for critiquing society ' s haphazard approach to locating missing children . But few people acting without the the backing of an organized group have attacked the system with the blunderbuss vigor of Sam Knott . In large part , Sam has created his causes and brought them to critical mass on_his_own . Opinion is divided on the health of Sam ' s crusade . Stirling believes that if Sam is overbearing at times , he ' s entitled . &quot; The scope of ( the Knotts ' tragedy ) was a tremendous underlining of the incompetence of the system . They had to find the body themselves . Then they had to show the prosecutor how to prosecute . There ' s no reason for a stockbroker to have to interview a jury and write a cookbook to show the D.A. what to do. &quot; &quot; The general public would like to believe that when somebody is murdered , we read about it in the newspaper , then it ' s over , &quot; says Mike Mantell , chief psychologist with the San Diego police during the Peyer trial , and now in private practice working with trauma victims . &quot; It ' s wishful_thinking on our parts that when the lights and the cameras and reporters go_away the victims put things back together . Well , that ' s just not the case . For many people the loss is a tear in the heart that just never ever mends. &quot; Which is not to say that Sam ' s crusades have been universally well received . Law_enforcement insiders say the new missing-persons laws impose demands on the 911 system that dilute manpower and force officers to respond to calls that seldom merit a dispatcher ' s time . The tracking issue , too , has been denounced as fundamentally misguided . Critics argue that notwithstanding the grimness of the Knotts ' experience , police as a class are the last people parents need to worry about . It is clear that almost from that fateful Sunday morning , Sam Knott has been attempting to create a legislative and electronic cradle : Missing persons laws that deliver your errant children safely back to your arms within hours . Cosmic surveillance that keeps deviant cops away from them . Lights and sensors everywhere so that nothing sinister can happen in shadows . &quot; If you can ' t keep your children warm and safe in their beds forever , you do the next-best thing : child - proof the world . &quot; By whatever means necessary . CAUTIOUSLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE LONG-RANGE PROSPECTS FOR TRACKING , Sam has turned his thinking to the civil suit . Early in 1991 , a jury found for the Knotts , awarding $ 7.5 million in damages , but it became a hollow victory as Superior_Court Judge James R . Milliken effectively dismissed the Highway Patrol from the suit , ruling that the state could be found liable only if Peyer killed Cara in the course of his regular duties . That ruling theoretically leaves Peyer , now broke and in prison , liable for the whole multimillion-dollar award . Then , that fall , came the ground-breaking resolution of a nine-year court battle in the case of Mary M . v the City of Los Angeles . Raped by an on-duty LAPD officer in 1981 , she sought to get the city to pay damages . The case went_to the California Supreme Court , which found for the plaintiff . Justice Joyce L . Kennard wrote , &quot; When law_enforcement officers abuse their authority by committing crimes against members of the community , they violate public_trust . The public employer must be held accountable for their actions. &quot; Knott attorney Forrest A . Hainline III went_to the Supreme Court hoping to have the Mary M . ruling applied to the Peyer suit . The state counterattacked vigorously by seeking the right to amend or even repudiate certain testimony of CHP officials and others during the two criminal trials . The testimony in_question concerns the state ' s prior knowledge of Peyer ' s habits , the danger posed by the Mercy Road exit and the issue of whether Peyer was still acting under the auspices of the CHP when he killed Cara . As Hainline puts it , &quot; The state argued that the rope Peyer killed her with wasn ' t a CHP-issue rope , so maybe the state should not be liable . &quot; The court may order the state to honor the civil jury ' s $ 7.5 million verdict . Or it may send the case back for retrial . Or -- Hainline ' s greatest fear -- it may even overturn its own prior ruling on Mary M . &quot; I ' m cautiously optimistic , &quot; says Sam , &quot; but then I ' ve been optimistic all my life , and , well , we ' ve seen what happened. &quot; Hainline finds it astonishing that Sam has held_up as well as he has through the ups and downs of litigation , of hearing the facts of his daughter ' s death recited again and again . and reaffirmed again . &quot; I don ' t know how he bears it -- and with grace , no less . You have to think all this would have killed any other man. &quot; Sam admits that his crusade has taken a toll on the family finances . He also concedes that Joyce is worried about him , that though she once supported him in his victims ' work and even took_on a_few projects herself , she has come_to feel that it ' s time for him to move_on . &quot; She ' s felt that way for a long_time now . A long_time . Most of what I do is very difficult for her , because she came from a situation where you don ' t rock the boat . Meanwhile , I ' m inside the boat , throwing furniture off ! &quot; Sometimes Sam thinks maybe she is right , certainly his battle against the forces of evil has exacted its toll on their finances . But there is just so_much left to do . His list of causes is almost endless . He hopes to make society stop romanticizing murderers and to heighten public awareness of those left_behind . Toward that end , he distributes $ 1 # 000 scholarships in his daughter ' s name through the Cara Knott Foundation . &quot; Everybody can name five monsters , but they can ' t name five victims , &quot; says Sam . &quot; Meanwhile , all this time , money and energy goes_into the appeal process and protecting the killer ' s constitutional rights. &quot; It galls Sam that Cara ' s assassin is accorded conjugal visits with wife Karen . &quot; The Monster gets three days and two nights , &quot; he says in a sing-song parody of a travel brochure . &quot; Isn ' t that nice ? A little vacation from the drudgery of prison. &quot; His eyes harden and his voice , suddenly , is ice-cold . &quot; And we pay_for all this. &quot; He wants to retrofit freeway call_boxes with beacon_lights , fog sensors that alert the CHP to dangerous conditions and other high-tech bells and whistles to improve highway safety . He has been acting as an aide-de-camp to other victims , notably Marc Klaas , father of Polly , whose abduction-murder in October , 1993 , sparked nationwide outrage . &quot; The system broke_down again , &quot; says Sam , shaking his head . What time he has left , he devotes to the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau , which pushes for legislative change and helps survivors cope and marshal resources for the killers ' parole hearings . Sam is already composing a mental agenda for the year 2005 , when Peyer becomes eligible for parole . &quot; You have to get the prosecutor there , prepare evidence -- relive the heartache all_over again . It ' s an enormous undertaking in time , money and emotion . &quot; People say , The Monster got a life sentence . They don ' t realize it ' s a life sentence for us , too. &quot;</TEXT>
