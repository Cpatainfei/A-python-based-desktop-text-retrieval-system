   <HEADLINE> TEEN-AGERS GATHER TO LEARN ABOUT AIDS ; HEALTH : MORE THAN 200 TAKE_PART IN CONFERENCE AT MOORPARK COLLEGE . THEY CITE NEED FOR MORE EDUCATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During the two weeks she was waiting for the results of her HIV test , 17-year-old Sarah Dixon thought_about the AIDS virus and the destruction it can cause -- something many of her peers seem reluctant to do . &quot; Even though I wasn ' t at high risk , I was still anxious to go_back and be sure , &quot; the Westlake High_School junior said . Thankfully , her results were negative . But hundreds of teen-agers across the nation haven ' t been as fortunate . With the number of human_immunodeficiency_virus cases rising among youth nationwide , Sarah and other Ventura County teen-agers have committed themselves to educating young people about the risks of unprotected sex in the hopes that it might prevent some from contracting the deadly disease . On Saturday , more_than 200 Ventura County teen-agers , from one end of the county to the other , gathered at Moorpark College for a daylong conference aimed at educating youth about issues relating to acquired immune deficiency syndrome and HIV . &quot; This whole conference was put_together by kids for kids , it ' s real unique in that respect , &quot; said Dale Hoffman , county coordinator of Friday Night Live , an alcohol and drug prevention program that co-sponsored the conference . &quot; We ' re really trying to break_down some barriers in a safe and comfortable environment. &quot; Hoffman said the idea for the conference , which featured a series of provocative and humor-filled workshops , was sparked by an AIDS awareness seminar directed at youth in Los Angeles . Ventura County health educators and students were so impressed with the program that they organized a conference here . The first was held last year in Ventura . The teen-agers who participated in the day said they aren ' t given enough AIDS education in their schools . &quot; There ' s just this overwhelming need for AIDS education , &quot; said Shannon Gulden , youth coordinator of the conference and a senior at Nordhoff High_School in Ojai . &quot; All we get_at Nordhoff is what we ' re taught in our GSR ( general state requirement ) class. &quot; Lauren Scotto , a sophomore at Thousand Oaks High_School , agreed . &quot; The only thing I learned in health about AIDS was what it stood_for , &quot; she said . Trevor Althof , a senior at Ventura High_School , said AIDS education needs to be provided outside school classrooms . &quot; People have to know the right ways to prevent it , &quot; he said . &quot; Sex is the most misunderstood topic . A lot of people are interested , but the education is limited to our campuses. &quot; Trevor , 17 , attended last year ' s conference and said he has become involved in teaching his peers about the dangers of unprotected sex . &quot; I have a strong commitment , &quot; he said . &quot; I not only learn to help others but learn how to protect myself. &quot; Ventura County Health Services has reported only three AIDS cases among young people ages 13 to 19 , which represents 1 % of all Ventura County AIDS cases , said Martina Rippey , county coordinator of AIDS surveillance . But national statistics indicate a growing number of teen-age AIDS cases , and experts warn that AIDS is spreading rapidly among adolescents . As of September , 1991 , there were a reported 751 AIDS cases among 13- to 19-year-olds in the United States , Rippey said . By September , 1993 , that number had nearly doubled , with a reported 1 # 412 cases , Rippey said . * In its report on AIDS in adolescents last year , the National Commission on AIDS warned that the number of cases among 13- to 19-year-olds was deceptive because AIDS can take 10 or more years to develop . AIDS experts maintain that education is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the disease . &quot; I think ( parents and school officials ) are alerted , but they are reluctant to talk_about it , &quot; Rippey said . &quot; Maybe the word is not out strong enough for this generation. &quot; The teen-agers at Moorpark College on Saturday were willing to face facts . &quot; I think ( teen-agers ) know about it , but they don ' t think it will happen to them , &quot; said Christine Delgado , 16 , a junior at Rio Mesa High_School in Oxnard . &quot; Everybody thinks it will happen to someone else , or they ' re just misinformed . that ' s why I wanted to come here. &quot; Veronica Daube , a 14-year-old freshman at Camarillo High_School , agreed . &quot; I wanted to know more about the AIDS virus because I am in a community where kids are having_sex , &quot; she said . Westlake ' s Sarah Dixon , who works_at AIDS Care in Ventura , said kids educating each other is one of the most effective ways to disseminate information about the disease . &quot; There ' s a closed-mindedness among teen-agers and I think that ' s holding them back from learning about AIDS , &quot; she said . &quot; I think it ' s incredibly beneficial when you ' re involved with other peers , because not everything you learn from adults you ' re going to accept. &quot; But there were three adults speaking at one of the 10 workshops Saturday who captivated the teen-agers with their words . Doug Halter , Cam Keep and Jim Vellequette all have AIDS . Their message to Ventura County ' s youth was personal and passionate . &quot; We want to save your lives , you guys are our futures , &quot; Keep said . &quot; I don ' t want anyone else to wake_up with this virus. &quot;</TEXT>
