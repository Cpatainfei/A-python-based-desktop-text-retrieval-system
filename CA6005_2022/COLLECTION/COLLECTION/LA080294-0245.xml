   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; TIES BETWEEN ISRAEL , JORDAN LEAVE ARAFAT ODD MAN OUT ; MIDEAST : UNITED FRONT CUTS INTO PLO CHIEF ' S ABILITY TO PLAY POLITICS . HE VOWS TO FIGHT ANY DEALS ON JERUSALEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel ' s rapidly improving relations with Jordan are adding_to Yasser Arafat ' s woes as he struggles to create a functioning Palestinian government in Gaza and the West_Bank town of Jericho . For decades , Arafat has survived as leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization by deftly picking his way through the sometimes deadly maze of inter-Arab politics . Even when he made missteps , he was always able to recover by playing one Arab state off another . But now , the onetime guerrilla leader faces Jordan ' s King Hussein and Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , two men who share the common goal of ensuring that the Palestinian entity will pose neither an economic nor a security threat to either of their nations . Arafat , who suspects that the two also are determined to prevent the birth of a Palestinian state , is finding it difficult either to drive a wedge between the two leaders or to find an Arab partner capable of counterbalancing them . Last week was nightmarish for Arafat . First came the spectacle of a beaming Hussein enjoying a hearty handshake on the White_House lawn with Rabin before the two signed a declaration ending the state_of_war between Israel and Jordan . Arafat publicly praised the move but then expressed alarm over Israel ' s recognition in the declaration of a special role for Jordan in maintaining the Muslim holy sites of Arab East Jerusalem . The PLO leader was so infuriated by the declaration that he subsequently allowed his security_forces to ban the distribution in Gaza , Jericho and East Jerusalem of two pro-Jordanian newspapers , a move that in turn raised a storm of protest from Palestinian intellectuals who complained that Arafat and his new government are anti-democratic . But the PLO leader made_it clear Monday that he will not step aside to allow Jordan and Israel to cut a deal on Jerusalem . &quot; For us , Jerusalem is one issue , one cause . It is not only a political issue , it is a sovereignty issue , it is an issue of holy sacred places for Christians and Muslims , &quot; Arafat said in Gaza . Arafat called_on Israel to open talks immediately with the PLO on the future status of Jerusalem , although Israel and the PLO decided in September ' s joint declaration to put_off those negotiations to no later than May , 1996 . &quot; If they have decided to start now , then we are insisting to start now , &quot; Arafat said . Israel immediately rebuffed the notion of opening talks soon with the PLO on Jerusalem ' s fate . &quot; There is agreement that the issue is not discussed at this stage , &quot; said Police Minister Moshe Shahal , who met Monday in Tel Aviv with Nabil Shaath , minister of planning and international cooperation for the Palestinian Authority , to discuss the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails . &quot; Jerusalem is under Israeli sovereignty and united . It has been so for 27 years and will remain so in the future , &quot; Shahal said . But the Israelis did meet Monday with PLO officials in Jerusalem for the first time . Negotiators for the two sides held talks on economic issues at a building owned by the Roman_Catholic_Church that lies on the dividing line between West and East Jerusalem . Palestinians saw this as a small victory , but Israeli officials dismissed the significance of the site . Israel says that Jerusalem is its capital and will remain undivided . The PLO says it wants to make mostly Arab East Jerusalem , which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and later annexed , the capital of a future Palestinian state . King Hussein , who traces his lineage back to the prophet Mohammed , claims a role in maintaining the Muslim holy sites nestled inside the walls of East Jerusalem ' s ancient Old City . Jordan controls the trust that runs the Temple Mount , site of Al Aqsa , Islam ' s third-holiest mosque . Hussein recently spent $ 6 million of his private funds to refurbish the mosque . This week , Arafat is confronted with further evidence of the warming in relations between Israel and Jordan . Peace talks resumed between the two nations on their southern border Monday . And next Monday , Hussein and Rabin are hoping to meet again , to inaugurate a new border crossing between their nations just north of the twin ports of Aqaba and Eilat . U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher is expected to join them for a ceremony opening a crossing for tourists carrying passports from nations other_than Israel or Jordan . Israeli and Jordanian sources say they are making quick headway on issues ranging from sharing scarce water resources to offering joint tourist packages . Some West_Bank Palestinians already have been granted licenses by Jordan to export to Israel . Israel and the Palestinians also are immersed in talks , which began Monday in Cairo , on extending Palestinian self-government to include the entire West_Bank . But those negotiations are moving slowly as the two sides haggle over taxation , education , health_care and other bureaucratic matters . And , ominously for Arafat , Gazans are beginning to grumble openly that the PLO has yet to make real improvements in their lives . PLO Labor Minister Samir Ghoshe said in an interview that unemployment remains at around 45 % and acknowledged that he has no immediate solution to the problem . Gazans from opposition factions and even within the mainstream PLO also openly complain about Arafat ' s recent decision to appoint a municipal council for Gaza City that is heavy on Arafat supporters , light on opposition seats and conspicuously lacking independent-minded Palestinians . The opposition has boycotted the council and called instead for early elections . The PLO says elections , tentatively scheduled for October , will be put_off at least until the end of December .</TEXT>
