   <HEADLINE> MICHIGAN SUPREME COURT AGREES TO HEAR APPEALS IN KEVORKIAN CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The state Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear appeals in several cases involving Michigan ' s law banning assisted suicide and attempts to prosecute Dr. Jack Kevorkian for murder . The court said it would decide whether the assisted suicide law violated the state or federal constitutions and whether Kevorkian can be tried_for murder in the assisted suicides of two women who died before the state ban was in place.Arguments were scheduled for Oct . 4 . The Michigan Court of Appeal ruled May 10 that the assisted suicide ban was unconstitutional because of a flaw in the way it was adopted . The law , passed specifically to stop Kevorkian , was added_to a bill setting_up a commission to study assisted suicide . The Michigan constitution requires that bills cover only one subject . The appeals court also ruled May 10 that the state constitution guarantees no right to suicide or assisted suicide . And it said Kevorkian could be tried_for murder in connection with two assisted suicides that took_place in 1991 before the law was passed .</TEXT>
