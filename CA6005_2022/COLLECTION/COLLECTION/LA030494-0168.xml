   <HEADLINE> JAPANESE LAWMAKERS FINALIZE ENACTMENT OF POLITICAL REFORMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the support of Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ' s coalition and opposition Liberal Democrats , Parliament ' s upper house today made final the enactment of Japan ' s most drastic political reforms since the post-World War II occupation era . The laws enacted today fill_in enforcement dates omitted from an eleventh-hour , stop-gap passage of the bills Jan . 29 . Designed to favor larger parties , the new system is expected to force an amalgamation of the hodgepodge of 10 political_parties that now exist into two or three groups and facilitate changes of government . Until rebels bolted the Liberal Democratic Party last summer , the former ruling party had held power for 38 years . One more step remains before a general_election can be conducted under the new system , which provides_for voters in each district to elect a single representative , instead of an average of four , to the lower house . Parliament must approve a bill establishing boundaries for 300 single-seat districts , to be drawn_up in six months . In all , the new lower house will have 500 seats , with voters casting a second ballot for political_parties to choose 200 seats through proportional_representation . In exchange for limiting annual corporate donations to individual politicians to $ 4 # 800 , the government , for the first time , will donate $ 297 million each year to political_parties in_proportion_to the seats they hold_in the lower house . The new system should be ready to go_by early next year . Should Hosokawa dissolve the lower house before then -- an action that is not expected -- balloting would be conducted under the old system of multi-seat districts .</TEXT>
