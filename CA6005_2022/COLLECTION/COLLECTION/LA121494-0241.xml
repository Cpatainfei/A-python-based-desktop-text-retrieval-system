   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; TIMING OF YELTSIN NOSE_JOB BAFFLES RUSSIA ; LEADERSHIP : AIDES SEE NOTHING ' SENSATIONAL ' IN HIS UNDERGOING SURGERY AFTER ORDERING DRIVE ON CHECHNYA . CRITICS ACCUSE PRESIDENT OF HIDING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What a time for a nose_job . Why would the president of a major_power decide to enter the hospital for optional surgery to repair a deviated septum in his nose -- surgery that aides said would require a recovery period of up_to eight days -- immediately after approving a controversial invasion of a rebellious province ? Yet that is exactly what Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin has done , prompting his fellow citizens once again to ponder the erratic performance of their leader , the state of his health and the degree of control he wields over his powerful Kremlin aides . On Friday , the fiery 63-year-old Siberian , whose popularity is at an all-time low , authorized the Russian government to &quot; use all means at the state ' s disposal &quot; to subdue the breakaway Muslim republic of Chechnya . Then he entered the hospital for what aides described as a two-hour procedure on his nose . At dawn Sunday , Russian troops and tanks began rolling toward the Chechen capital of Grozny , a military intervention that many fear could spill much Russian blood . Vladimir Ilyushin , one of Yeltsin ' s closest aides , said the president , who has a history of back problems , heart trouble and unexplained absences during crises , had recently had trouble breathing through his nose , particularly at night . &quot; I don ' t see anything sensational about this , although these are complicated times , &quot; Ilyushin said . &quot; You only have one health. &quot; On Monday , Kremlin aides said Yeltsin was in complete control and would be back in his office in a_few days . They said the president would soon be able to receive foreign diplomats but would not be able to speak_to journalists for a time because his speech is not clear enough . On Tuesday , as reports reached Moscow that nine Russian soldiers had been killed fighting in Chechnya , Yeltsin gave a brief interview from his hospital_bed . &quot; No big war will start . The conflict so far is not even spreading_out of Chechnya , &quot; he assured the newspaper Argumenti i Fakti . &quot; The doctors say the operation was successful , &quot; Yeltsin added . &quot; I feel not bad. &quot; &quot; Boris Yeltsin is a coward , &quot; said entrepreneur Konstantin N . Borovoi , head of the Economic Freedom Party , at an anti-war demonstration in Moscow . &quot; The fact that he decided to undergo a nose operation shows that he really no longer controls the situation in the country . He has let matters get_out of hand and decided to ' take a break ' in a quiet clinic. &quot; Some Russians suggested a different explanation for the sudden hospitalization of a head_of_state who recently stood_up the prime_minister of Ireland and then blamed his bodyguards for not allowing aides to wake him up in time . &quot; Maybe he took too_much of his favorite medicine , &quot; suggested Caucasus scholar Sergei A . Arutiunov , referring to Yeltsin ' s rumored vodka habit . Others viewed his reported illness with deeper concern . &quot; I ' m very worried about what happened to him , &quot; said Alexei G . Arbatov , who heads a Moscow think_tank . &quot; I have very many suspicions that it ' s not the nose. &quot; Yeltsin has been hospitalized for heart trouble twice , in 1987 and in 1990 . He dropped_out of sight for short periods during the political upheavals of 1991 and 1993 , and has admitted to bouts of depression . Whatever the truth about the presidential proboscis , Yeltsin is once again in a deep political crisis . Three and a half years into his six-year term , Yeltsin ' s popularity rating has dropped to a new low . A poll of Muscovites by the firm Mnenie last month found that only 40 % want him to continue as president and 33 % would like him to resign . In May , the same poll found 53 % supported Yeltsin and 24 % wanted him to quit . His political foes -- who now include democrats as well as nationalists and Communists -- are calling_for presidential and parliamentary elections next year . If Yeltsin is forced to acquiesce , the outlook is not promising . In a by-election in the city of Bryansk last weekend , Communists and nationalists won seven local legislative seats , and independent candidates took the other two . The democrats failed to field a candidate . If Yeltsin was following the election news from his hospital_bed , the only consolation was that the candidate actively supported by ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky was beaten soundly . Worse , some of the stalwart liberals who were Yeltsin ' s last allies have turned against him . Sergei N . Yushenkov , chairman of the Parliament ' s Defense Committee , on Monday said Yeltsin ' s policy on Chechnya was aimed at justifying a crackdown in Russia and at &quot; introducing dictatorship. &quot; He said Yeltsin no longer consults with his former democratic allies and has no respect for their advice , while his entourage has lost all ties with reality . Then , on a holiday celebrating the Russian constitution , the prominent democrat called_on his colleagues to use the year-old document to impeach Yeltsin . Economist Yegor T . Gaidar , head of the Democratic Choice of Russia party , quickly disavowed Yushenkov ' s remarks . But Gaidar has broken_with Yeltsin over Chechnya , as have human_rights leader Sergei A . Kovalyev and other leading lights of Russia ' s democratic transformation . Gaidar , a former acting prime_minister and the first architect of Yeltsin ' s free-market economic reform , told the &quot; Itogi &quot; television_program , &quot; I tried to reach Boris Nikolayevich but I did not succeed , for the first time in many years. &quot; Yushenkov ' s telephone was cut_off altogether -- a tactic Yeltsin has used against friends-turned-critics . Two years ago , Yeltsin sacrificed Gaidar to appease the right-wing critics who opposed &quot; shock_therapy &quot; reforms as too painful and who then turned_to a more potent brand of nationalism . Reforms have continued , though with more fits and flaws than many had hoped . Inflation running at 14 % per month in November has yet to be tamed . Critics sought to portray the Russian president as an isolated captive of his power-hungry men . Borovoi charged that Kremlin &quot; riffraff &quot; are running the crackdown on Chechnya under the direction of Gen . Alexander V . Korzhakov , the head of Yeltsin ' s bodyguard service , who is now considered one of the most powerful men in the Kremlin . Yeltsin once described himself and Korzhakov as &quot; inseparable. &quot; But Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev , who supports the Chechnya intervention , warned that if democratic forces are linked in the public mind to &quot; disintegration , anarchy and muddle , &quot; Zhirinovsky and the Communists will be seen as the alternative . Critics say Yeltsin has already adopted many of Zhirinovsky ' s policies . Democrats charge that Yeltsin has developed a case of the same political disease that proved fatal to former Soviet leader Mikhail S . Gorbachev : compromising real reform to appease political conservatives , and in the process alienating the liberals and reformers who were his only true allies .</TEXT>
