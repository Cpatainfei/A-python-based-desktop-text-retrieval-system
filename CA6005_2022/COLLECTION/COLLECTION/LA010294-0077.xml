   <HEADLINE> LETTERS IN VIEW ; PRINCIPLES COLLIDE OVER NATURAL PRODUCTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Re &quot; Faking It &quot; ( Dec . 17 ) : So the vegans get free press in_View promoting their lifestyle sans animal_products . Thankfully , in America we have the freedom to choose what to wear , eat and benefit from ( medical advances , for example ) . I choose to wear natural products -- fur , leather , wool and silk . This way my conscience is clear . I ' m not polluting the planet with rubber and vinyl manufacturing_plants . I ' m not supporting those huge tankers that carry gasoline from which synthetics are made , and that in one accident at_sea have wiped_out entire ecosystems . DANIEL WACHTENHEIM Los Angeles * I am willing to bet that vegans , typically , are conscientious about the environment . The refining of oil and the production of vinyl is extremely harmful to the biosphere , so who are they helping ? Let them wear jute . HILARY HARTMAN KIP Van Nuys * Have these self-righteous fonts of compassion considered the fact that by replacing all animal_products with synthetics such_as polyesters and acrylics , they are rapidly helping to destroy the ozone_layer protecting our atmosphere , thereby threatening all life on this planet ? One wishes that the morally high-minded would consider the big picture and not simply their immediate emotional responses . JOANNE G . MURPHY Los Angeles * Thank you very much for the balanced article on vegans . Usually we ' re regarded_as being strange or weird . The point of being a vegan is to express compassion and pity through an active nonviolent lifestyle . As a vegan , you strive to do the least amount of violence the society will allow , thereby moving society forward toward living_in peace , not only with other humans , but also with the creatures of the air , land and sea .
