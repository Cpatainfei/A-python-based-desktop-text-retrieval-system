   <HEADLINE> ART ; AND WHEN THEY WERE BAD . . . ; WITH HUMOR , SARCASM AND BRAZEN SEXUALITY , THE BICOASTAL ' BAD GIRLS ' CELEBRATES THE WOMEN WHO OPERATE OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS OF OLD NOTIONS OF PROPRIETY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Between two evils , I always pick the one I never tried before . &quot; -- Mae West * The Hollywood steam queen who noted that good girls go_to heaven but bad girls go everywhere seems to be the figurative godmother of a new art_movement . After two decades of serious thinking and writing_on the subjects of feminism and post-modernism , hundreds of artists have decided that being a bad girl is a good thing . that ' s the premise of a bicoastal art_exhibition organized by New York ' s New Museum director Marcia Tucker and San Francisco-based independent curator Marcia Tanner . The two women noticed a widespread movement toward funny , sarcastic and brazenly sexual work being produced by an increasing number of artists -- women as well as men . The results of their collaboration are displayed in the two-part show titled &quot; Bad Girls , &quot; whose first part is currently at the New Museum , and &quot; Bad Girls West , &quot; opening Jan . 25 at UCLA ' s Wight Art_Gallery . Tanner explains &quot; bad girl &quot; art : &quot; What really distinguishes it from previous feminist work is the use of humor as a strategy of subversion . And it operates outside the bounds of feminine propriety . It is not ideological , though it is operating from a position of power and liberation. &quot; As with so many projects in the women ' s art world , the exhibition evolved out of friendship and phone_calls , in this case more_than a year ago . Tucker plunged ahead to visit studios and commission work in New York , but Tanner found herself stymied . Although California is rife_with bad girls ( and boys ) making_good art , Tanner could not convince any venue in San Francisco to support such an exhibition . Finally , she wrote to her colleague Henry Hopkins , former director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and now Director of the Wight Art_Gallery at UCLA . He agreed to underwrite the controversial show with help from the California Arts Council and the UCLA Art Council . Tanner now thinks it was the optimum solution , since many works in the show explicitly confront stereotypes of women reinforced by the media . &quot; The fact that so_much of the show deals with perceptions of femininity makes its proximity to Hollywood with all_the film and TV industries a wonderful place to be , &quot; she says . Presenting the show in L.A. influenced Tanner ' s decision to choose many works dealing with pop culture and celebrity , such_as Kathe Burkhart ' s frightening paintings of Elizabeth Taylor undergoing plastic_surgery , Deborah Kass ' Warholesque paintings of Barbra Streisand and Nancy Dwyer ' s sculpture of giant balloons spelling_out an inflated &quot; EGO. &quot; What began as a relatively small show snowballed as the curators found more bad girls making art than they had initially suspected . &quot; Once the word got_out , we were inundated , &quot; says Tanner . &quot; There was a tremendous amount of work , especially in Southern California . You could have filled the Cow Palace . This is a major social phenomenon. &quot; Tanner selected work by 40 artists , including Judie Bamber , Kim Dingle , Lauren Lesko , Theresa Pendlebury , Megan Williams and Millie Wilson from L.A. , and fairly established artists from New York , such_as Marlene McCarty , Lorna Simpson and Rona Pondick . Pondick has roped together a pair of 13-foot-long double matresses and attached dozens of baby bottles filled with milky white or suspicious black liquids . Tanner refers to this sculpture as a &quot; grotesque body , &quot; referring to messy physical and psychological concepts that confront the rationality of late modernism . Among the men are Jerome Caja from San Francisco and Ken Aptekar from New York . Aptekar parodies traditional interpretations of old_master pictures by combining them with text etched on glass panels . Raphael ' s 16th-Century &quot; St . George Fighting the Dragon &quot; -- a knight in armor defending a damsel in distress -- is labelled &quot; Job Security. &quot; This mixture of known and lesser-known artist is purposeful . &quot; I didn ' t want this to be a provincial show , &quot; explains Tanner . &quot; I wanted it to be representative of the best work I could find . I thought it was important to present the West Coast artists in a larger context. &quot; Tucker decided to provide exposure to the largest possible number of lesser-known artists -- more_than 90 are in her two-part show -- including many from the West Coast . Among the men featured are L.A.-based Dani Tull and Keith Boadwee . Tucker defends the joint decision to include men in the feminist exhibition : &quot; Not only do I not think that people addressing the issues are not divided by age or race , they are not divided by gender either . Cary Leibowitz said that the men who are doing_work in this area are trying to be good boys rather than bad girls ! &quot; Tucker says the show came from her &quot; lifetime commitment to feminism and of seeing a lot of work that was really good but that struck me as addressing the issues in a different way . The work had to be humorous and transgressive . Humor alone won ' t create the changes in perception that I ' m interested in . And transgression alone might not . The combination is a double whammy in terms of feminist and gender issues . You can say very difficult things if you can make people laugh. &quot; She goes_on to explain the shift in attitude : &quot; When the women ' s movement emerged in New York in 1968 , rage was attendant to it . There was a real fury over what had happened , at the agents of its happening and at ourselves for letting it happen . Now we ' re past the rage and into more of a refined tool for dismantling the master ' s house . Younger women have benefited . They can see the issues , but it ' s not the same as 25 years ago. &quot; Tanner adds that the title comes from the notion that women are redefining their own images and reclaiming language . During the 1970s , as the women ' s movement gained momentum , the term &quot; girl &quot; came_to be considered pejorative in describing women over the age of 12 . Picking_up on the slang used by African American women , especially in music , the words bad and girl now mean good and friendly -- as in &quot; Girl , you are bad ! &quot; From a curatorial stance , Tanner says , &quot; Bad Girls &quot; is defined as the opposite of good girls , which is a patriarchally imposed definition . In the &quot; Bad Girls &quot; catalogue , she writes : &quot; Good girls . . . act feminine , i.e. modestly , quietly , in ways unthreatening to men . They put others ' needs and wants first . They may wield power or be aggressive but covertly , through passive manipulation . &quot; Good girls don ' t talk openly about their own sexual proclivities and erotic fantasies , which are assumed to be heterosexual ( male-centered ) . They don ' t forge their own persuasive , contradictarian language . . . &quot; Since many men are alarmed by women with a sense_of_humor -- a live giveaway for a mind and passions of one ' s own -- good girls confine theirs . . . Good girls don ' t laugh in public , never loudly , and certainly not at anything dirty . . . . The ' bad girls ' in these exhibitions flout all these precepts . . . . Not only are these artists disobeying explicit commandments enjoined by the fathers and handed_down through the mothers ' complicity , they ' re ignoring the entire myth of male hegemony , of paternal lawgivers in art and everywhere else. &quot; In the catalogue , both curators have written clearly about the ideas behind &quot; Bad Girls , &quot; yet the artists have thoughts of_their_own . L.A. artist Judie Bamber was censored last spring when her vibrating vagina sculpture was covered after it offended a member of the Hollywood Arts Council in an ad_hoc group show held at the defunct Newberry School of Beauty . This exhibition includes other sex-toy sculptures , as well as her paintings of beautiful B-movie vampires . The title of the series -- &quot; How Do You Trust Someone Who Bleeds for Seven Days and Doesn ' t Die ? &quot; -- is an example of an offensive sexist joke that is reclaimed and invested with humor in its unexpected context . Bamber says , &quot; When I think_of bad girls , I think it means you take pleasure in your sexuality . I don ' t think that ' s a negative , but I think society thinks that it ' s bad . I guess I struggle with that connection , the whole assumption that because you make work about sex that you ' re available sexually . I can ' t wholeheartedly embrace it , but I accept the idea of turning it around. &quot; New York artist Elizabeth Berdann is making her L.A. debut in this exhibition and having a concurrent solo show at the Ruth Bloom Gallery in Santa Monica . At the Wight Art_Gallery , she has installed &quot; Freak Show &quot; -- 48 miniature paintings of female posteriors selected from pornographic advertisements and surrounded by leering slogans like &quot; You won ' t believe your eyes. &quot; The companion installation at the New Museum is &quot; The Topless Hall_of_Fame , &quot; tiny portraits of breasts and the names of the strippers who own them : &quot; Dixie Dynamite &quot; or &quot; Montana Mounds. &quot; &quot; These represent the ' bad girls ' of our culture , &quot; says Berdann . &quot; I was struck by the similarity of the ads for pornography with 19th-Century circus advertising . A lot of the language was duplicated as though women were freaks men would come_to see. &quot; Nancy Dwyer designed the New York &quot; Bad Girls &quot; logo , a Cheshire cat smile . She is known for comical word_play in her paintings and sculptures and , for the New Museum , she fabricated a series of chairs and hassocks shaped like the letters in &quot; ha-ha-ha. &quot; &quot; Some of the elements in my work that are usually overlooked , or merely tolerated , in this show are celebrated , &quot; says Dwyer , &quot; the rudeness , the humor , the literalness and the pleasure . I ' ve spent a lot of time developing my work formally so I ' m a good girl in the art world , but I ' ve always had to satisfy the other side with humor. &quot; And why humor ? &quot; Because it ' s transgressive and anti-authoritarian , &quot; continues Dwyer . &quot; It ' s hard to take a lot of the doctrines of art-making seriously after a while if it ' s clear that you and your ( style of ) work have been excluded . Also , humor is a way to ingratiate yourself in a world you don ' t feel comfortable in. &quot; Or , as comic Kate Clinton quips , &quot; She who laughs , lasts. &quot; * &quot; Bad Girls West &quot; opens Jan . 25 at UCLA Wight Art_Gallery . In conjunction with the exhibition will be a video program organized by New York video artist and filmmaker Cheryl Dunye , as well as a performance art series related to the exhibition .
