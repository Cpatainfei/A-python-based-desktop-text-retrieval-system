   <HEADLINE> CHURCH SURVEYS CANDIDATES FOR VOTERS GUIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County ' s largest church is surveying candidates for local posts this election season , asking them pointed questions about controversial issues such_as homosexuality , euthanasia and abortion . Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa ' s unprecedented foray_into local politics will include distribution of the responses to more_than 50 # 000 people before the Nov . 8 election , to highlight which candidates agree with the church ' s values and views . &quot; It is just tough for the average person to get accurate information . . . ( on the ) moral and family values that we are concerned about , &quot; said David Hocking , a pastor at Calvary Chapel . Political observers and candidates said they have never before heard of a church issuing such a questionnaire , though various advocacy groups -- including Christian political organizations -- have conducted similar surveys . Some said they find the questions in the survey troubling . &quot; I ' m just real concerned about the marriage of church and state that this voters guide appears to be considering , &quot; said Harvey Englander , a Huntington Beach-based consultant who has worked for Democrats and Republicans . But Jo Ellen Allen , vice-chairwoman of the Orange County Republican_Party and president of the Eagle Forum of California , said that as long as the church does not endorse candidates , she sees no problem with the voters guide . Churches have &quot; the responsibility to speak out on moral issues and . . . how they ' re reflected in public policy , &quot; she said . Though the church is breaking no law by publishing a &quot; voters guide , &quot; experts said , it appears to take_advantage of a loophole in the laws governing political activism by tax-exempt organizations . Churches are not allowed to endorse candidates , but can circulate educational information during campaigns . Unlike advocacy groups that endorse candidates , churches are not required to file disclosure forms about money collected or spent on politics . Mark Petracca , an associate_professor of political_science at UC Irvine who specializes in local_government , said he is concerned about accountability when tax-exempt groups participate in the political process . &quot; This is a circumvention mechanism , &quot; Petracca said of the surveys . &quot; Their intention is not to give voters a guide , but to give support to candidates who answer in the way they prefer. &quot; Hocking denied that the guide is a method of disguising endorsements . &quot; We ' re just going_to publish the results , &quot; he said . Founded in 1965 , Calvary Chapel is among the largest churches in the United States , drawing as_many as 50 # 000 people to services in locations across Orange County each Sunday . Headquartered in Santa Ana , the church has spawned 570 branches around the country . The church distributed 600 surveys to candidates in the county Sept . 20 , asking that they be returned within a week . As of Wednesday , 166 candidates had responded , Hocking said . Those running for county offices or city_council seats were asked 10 questions ; school_board candidates were asked seven . Candidates for some special districts also received questionnaires , though there was no questionnaire specifically designed for them . City_council candidates were asked if they would oppose &quot; special legal_status for homosexuals , &quot; &quot; insurance coverage for . . . homosexual partners of government employees , &quot; &quot; businesses which sell or rent pornographic materials , &quot; and &quot; removal of ( religious ) artifacts . . . from public property. &quot; The school_board questionnaire asks candidates if they would oppose distribution of condoms on school campuses . It asks if they would support abstinence-only sex education , parental consent for abortion and equal access for anti-abortion speakers on school campuses . &quot; The voters have the right to know where people stand , &quot; said Costa Mesa City_Council candidate Chris Steel , who returned his survey with mostly ' yes ' answers . Hocking said a booklet containing the results of the survey will be distributed at churches throughout the county about two weeks before the election .</TEXT>
