   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEW ; ' PASSIN &quot; : A ROMANTIC LOOK_AT THE PANTHERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Black Panther Party , whose presence has been felt far longer than the organization ' s actual active life , tends to stir_up deep , almost irrational passions in America ' s far political wings . While both sides have railed for and against the Panthers , a reasoned , objective history of the group ' s rise and fall has yet to be written . And we ' re no closer to the unvarnished truth with Peter Miller ' s and John Valadez ' s &quot; Passin ' It On , &quot; on PBS ' &quot; P.O.V. &quot; series tonight . Indeed , &quot; Passin ' It On &quot; appears to be the left ' s latest media effort to rile up the right . Miller ' s and Valadez ' s film is a model of agit-prop , and the right-wing Center for the Study of Popular Culture has fired back , labeling the film a &quot; promotional &quot; piece for the film ' s subject and New York Panther organizer , Dhoruba Bin Wahad . It is indeed that , and Miller and Valadez indeed show ( sometimes laboriously ) that Wahad was the likely object of a rushed police attempt to nail the leading Panther spokespersons on less-than-solid evidence of conspiracy to murder . * That a New York jury acquitted the so-called &quot; Panther 21 &quot; in a 1971 conspiracy trial , and that the courts eventually overturned Wahad ' s conviction ( for the murder of two New York City police_officers ) bolsters this film ' s claims that the Panthers were unjustly targeted for prosecution . But &quot; Passin ' It On &quot; not only obviously turns Wahad into a martyr figure , it also romanticizes the Panthers . Panther veteran Jamal Joseph explains that the group provided free meals and health_care along with political education for ghetto youth . In fact , the Panthers , as the angry children of a civil_rights movement devastated by the Martin_Luther_King Jr . assassination , adapted Mao Zedong ' s tactics of community organizing and recruitment for the eventual armed struggle -- but you won ' t hear that here . &quot; Passin ' It On &quot; also fails to explore the group ' s ethic of &quot; self-defense , &quot; which justified armed struggle against what was perceived to be the occupying force of the police in the ghetto . In 1994 , the ethic echoes the pleas of a National Rifle Assn . supporter or neo-Nazi militias who also claim they are victims of government spies and counterintelligence . * &quot; Passin ' It On &quot; airs at 10 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 .</TEXT>
