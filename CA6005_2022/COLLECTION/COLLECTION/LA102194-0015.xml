   <HEADLINE> DON ' T LET HAMAS WIN ; ARAFAT INVITES HIS OWN POLITICAL DESTRUCTION IF HE DOESN ' T STOP EQUIVOCATING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Middle_East peace process will survive the terrorist atrocity carried_out in Tel Aviv by Palestinian Muslim fundamentalists . It will survive because the leaders of Israel and Yasser Arafat , who heads the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho , know that to let the process fail is to concede victory to the Hamas extremists , who dream only of Israel ' s replacement with a rigidly theocratic Palestine on the Iranian model . So Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will continue to talk . But the extremist horrors will continue . Israel ' s Cabinet has approved various measures , some unannounced , in response to Wednesday ' s bus bombing that killed more_than 20 in downtown Tel Aviv . Palestinians who commute to Israel for work will , once again , be denied entry and so their livelihood . The police will be bolstered . Beyond that it ' s a near-certainty that Israeli security_forces have been ordered to move more aggressively to capture or kill members of Hamas . How effective will all this be ? Two years ago Israel exiled to Lebanon 400 men it identified as top Hamas members . That action , however , neither weakened nor demoralized the group . Tougher measures against Hamas may help ease Israeli pain over the Tel Aviv outrage . But will Hamas really be harmed ? For the most part Hamas is now simply beyond Israel ' s reach . What Israel couldn ' t do when it still had military_control over Hamas ' breeding ground in Gaza it can hardly hope to achieve now . Only Arafat and his regime are capable of neutralizing Hamas and shielding the peace process from its most committed enemies . Arafat ' s timidity so far has only emboldened the zealots , allowing them both to expand their terrorism and increase their appeal_to young hotheads . The plain fact now is that Arafat invites his own political destruction if he doesn ' t stop equivocating . He has run_out of options : Hamas must be disarmed and broken_up by the Palestinian Authority . Hamas can ' t bring Israel down . But in time it assuredly can destroy the hopes of Palestinians for self-rule , dooming a_people that has never known real independence to a continued political limbo .</TEXT>
