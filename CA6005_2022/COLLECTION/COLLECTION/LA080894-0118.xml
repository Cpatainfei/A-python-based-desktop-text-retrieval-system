   <HEADLINE> CUBANS RALLY AS U.S. PLAYS_DOWN UNREST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hundreds of thousands of Cubans gathered at Havana ' s Revolution Square on Sunday to show support for the government , two days after clashes in the capital that injured 35 people . The sea of people waved Cuban flags , chanted revolutionary slogans and stood through a rain_shower to hear Deputy Defense Minister Ulises Rosales del Toro reiterate Cuba ' s angry charge that the United States was behind the unprecedented clashes , the worst in the capital in decades . In the United States , officials sought to play_down the unrest and the possibility of an exodus of refugees from the island . The clashes were triggered by at least three hijackings of ferries in 10 days by Cubans seeking to leave illegally by sea for the United States . In a speech Friday , Cuban President Fidel Castro blamed the United States for encouraging the exodus and threatened to allow free emigration , raising the specter of the 1980 Mariel boat lift , in which about 120 # 000 Cubans came_to South Florida . Without saying how it would do so , the Clinton_Administration quickly promised to prevent another such influx . An Administration official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said Sunday that one option is a blockade by U.S. warships of the passage between Key West , Fla. , and Cuba . Sunday ' s gathering in Havana was in honor of 19-year-old police_officer Gabriel Lamoth Caballero , killed by hijackers who commandeered a ferry Thursday . The body of a second officer killed in the same incident has not yet been recovered . That ferry hijacking ended with authorities bringing the hijackers and passengers back to Havana after the vessel ran_out of fuel . The Sunday newspaper Juventud Rebelde -- the youth Communist weekly -- said 35 people , including 10 police_officers , were injured in Friday ' s clashes between police and stone-throwers along a stretch of the Malecon seafront drive . The paper said &quot; important groups &quot; had been arrested but did not give a number . Juventud Rebelde said 300 to 400 people gathered near the port early in the morning and were dispersed . Following that , 21 people tried to commandeer a tugboat , even though it had no motor , and were detained , the newspaper said . Later , about 700 people congregated near the port , and clashes erupted around the Hotel Deauville , along the Malecon , the newspaper added . Granma , the Communist_Party daily , published a graphic account of the clashes , quoting members of civilian law_enforcement brigades . &quot; They hit the eye out of one colleague , broke the skull of another and split another ' s head , &quot; Granma quoted one man as saying . Said another : &quot; Stones were flying all_over the place . . . . It was a body-to-body clash , and we pushed them back. &quot; Cuba says U.S. policy stimulates illegal exits because Washington limits the visas it grants but allows Cubans who have left the island illegally to stay in the United States .</TEXT>
