   <HEADLINE> GERMAN COURT OKS GLOBAL ROLE FOR TROOPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Opening the door for Germany to play a global role for the first time since World_War_II , this country ' s highest_court ruled Tuesday that federal troops may participate in international military_missions . The decision by the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe was a victory for Chancellor Helmut Kohl , who has argued in the face of national reluctance that the reunified Germany must take_on international responsibilities commensurate with its new size and its economic power . In effect , the decision allows Kohl to relax restraints imposed on the armed forces after Nazi-era militarism to ensure that Germany would never again threaten its neighbors . But the court required the government to secure parliamentary approval before deploying troops on U.N. or other multinational missions , and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel hastened to assure the world that Germany would be a team player , not an aggressor . &quot; Germany will never pursue an interventionist policy , &quot; Kinkel told reporters at the court . &quot; Our foreign and security policy will not be militarized , you can be sure of that. &quot; Kohl and President Clinton welcomed the decision in Berlin , where they met at the historic German Reichstag ( Parliament ) building and later walked solemnly together through the Brandenburg Gate that once divided East and West_Berlin . &quot; I am very happy with this , &quot; Kohl said . &quot; I have always held the view that deployments like this are allowed by the constitution. &quot; The United States and the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization have been pressing Germany to abandon its military caution and make a sizable troop contribution to new , rapid-reaction units designed to intervene in regions in crisis . In Bonn on Monday , Clinton made_it clear that he views Germany as America ' s primary ally in Europe now and said , &quot; I do hope that we will have the benefit of the full range of Germany ' s capacities to lead. &quot; * Clinton said Germany has demonstrated its leadership with aid to former Soviet Bloc countries and efforts to integrate them into the European Union . When Germany took_over the union ' s presidency July 1 , Kohl vowed to fight for the integration into that group of countries such_as Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic . Western Europe supports broadening the union but also fears it will concentrate too_much power in centrally located Germany . The ability to send troops on international missions is likely to boost Kohl ' s bid for a seat for Germany on the U.N. Security_Council . But the issue remains highly_sensitive among Germans still grappling with the country ' s Nazi past . There is a deep pacifist undercurrent in the country ; political observers say it will continue to limit government involvement in foreign military operations . &quot; This will not be freewheeling intervention , by no means , &quot; said Michael Stuermer , director of the independent Research Institute for International Affairs near Munich . &quot; The decision of the court will force us to think much more clearly , without using false pretexts , about what to do_in what kinds of contingencies . But Germany will more often than not say ' No , this is not for us. ' &quot; Stuermer said Germany is further restricted because it is not a nuclear_power and not a former colonial power -- like Britain and France -- with links in other parts of the world . History also would keep Germany from sending troops to the former Yugoslav federation , for example , where Hitler ' s army intervened in support of a repressive Croatian regime that killed thousands of Serbs . Germany ' s constitution was written with the founding of the Federal Republic in 1949 and includes a provision that , &quot; except for self-defense , &quot; the armed forces can be deployed only where it is explicitly allowed . Every government before Kohl ' s has interpreted the clause to mean the German military could be used only to defend the country or to help NATO against an attack from the former Soviet_Union and its allies . But after the fall of communism , Bonn began to view this interpretation as obsolete . And when the constitution kept Germany from fighting in the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War against Iraq , Kohl argued that such missions were permissible with allies and under a multinational mandate . The court ' s long-awaited decision -- one of the most important since German reunification in 1990 -- was a rejection of actions brought by the opposition Social Democratic Party over deployment of German ships in the Adriatic_Sea to support an embargo against Serbia , and of the assignment of German soldiers on radar surveillance flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and on the ground in Somalia . &quot; Peace forces and their task of securing peace are part of the United Nations ' system of collective_security as it has developed through the practical_application of the U.N. charter , which the Federal_Republic_of_Germany joined in 1973 , &quot; the eight-judge panel ruled . &quot; For that reason , German soldiers also may be deployed in the framework of United Nations peace troops even when these have a mandate to use force. &quot; But the court said Kohl had infringed on the rights of Parliament when he failed to consult lawmakers before deploying troops over Bosnia and in Somalia . It said approval by a simple majority in Parliament was required for further deployments . Kohl ' s Christian Democratic Union hailed the decision as a victory over the opposition Social Democratic Party , saying the court had ratified the country ' s &quot; moral_obligation &quot; to participate in multilateral military_missions . Social Democratic leader Rudolf Scharping , meanwhile , issued a face-saving statement saying the verdict had &quot; clearly removed the legal twilight zone &quot; around deployment of German troops and ensured parliamentary oversight . &quot; The court plainly and clearly dismissed the view of the CDU , according to which the government could single-handedly order international missions , &quot; said Scharping , Kohl ' s opponent in the Oct . 16 federal election . * Kohl ' s coalition partner in the government , the liberal Free Democratic Party , had joined the SPD in its April , 1993 , challenge of the use of German staff on NATO surveillance flights over Bosnia . But they too lauded the court ' s insistence on parliamentary approval . In Berlin , Clinton was ebullient over the court decision and said Germany has set standards in humanity , democracy and respect for diversity .</TEXT>
