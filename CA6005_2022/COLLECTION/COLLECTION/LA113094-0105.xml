   <HEADLINE> HOUSE APPROVES WORLD TRADE PACT ; COMMERCE : THE BIPARTISAN 288-146 VOTE TO LOWER TARIFFS AND BOOST EXPORTS IS A MAJOR VICTORY FOR CLINTON . BUT THE BIG TEST COMES THURSDAY IN THE SENATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Casting its curtain-closing vote_in the 103rd Congress , the House set_aside months of bitter partisanship Tuesday and approved a multinational trade agreement that would slash tariffs and spur commerce around the globe . The House vote , 288 to 146 , gives the White_House a significant legislative victory three weeks after nationwide elections brought President Clinton a devastating rebuff at the polls and sends the trade accord to a less certain fate in the Senate . It also gives lawmakers hope that , on some issues , the new Congress that takes_office in January will be able to put aside confrontation and pass legislation . The vote came_after Clinton_Administration officials had applied steady pressure on Democrats throughout the day and incoming Republican leaders had rallied their forces . Just 56 of the 177 Republicans voted against the pact , while 89 of 256 House Democrats bucked the White_House and opposed passage . Independent Rep . Bernard Sanders of Vermont also voted no . Among House Republicans , who chafed for one final work_day as the minority party , there was evident discomfort at delivering such a victory to Clinton . But Rep . David Dreier ( R-San Dimas ) said that GOP leaders were prepared to go_along with the White_House this time &quot; because the President is right on this issue. &quot; An unlikely alliance -- including conservative Republican commentator Patrick J . Buchanan and independent Texas billionaire Ross Perot -- has opposed the agreement , which would create a new_World Trade Organization to replace the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as the regime that governs global commerce . They have argued that the pact will promote the export of U.S. jobs , erode American laws protecting workers and the environment and hold the United States hostage to the whims of an international trade body unaccountable to U.S. voters . But Democratic and Republican supporters have countered that the accord , by boosting exports , will create as_many as 700 # 000 new U.S. jobs and increase gross_national_product by as much as $ 200 billion a year . California stands to gain $ 15 billion to $ 30 billion in new export business and at least 200 # 000 additional jobs within 10 years , according to the California Council for International Trade . While citing those figures , Rep . Anthony C . Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills ) said Tuesday ' s vote had a broader significance . It was , he said , &quot; about how the United States will relate to the rest of the world in the years ahead -- as an optimistic , confident , competitive leader and trading partner , or a frightened , defeatist and unreliable nation which is unwilling to act in its own best interest and in the interest , as well , of the rest of the world. &quot; Rep . Bill Richardson ( D-N.M. ) joined the chorus of those urging approval . &quot; This vote is about America ' s standing in the world , &quot; he said . &quot; Whether we are going_to lead internationally or whether we are going_to put our heads in the sand and retrench. &quot; The holdouts in Tuesday ' s House vote included some of the Republicans ' most ardent conservatives , who charged that the trade accord will erode U.S. sovereignty , as well as_many in the House ' s liberal camp who said they fear that American jobs will be lost to countries that have few standards protecting their workers from abuse . The House vote cleared the way for a Senate showdown on the issue Thursday . There , the defections on Tuesday of two key Democrats -- Sens . Max Baucus of Montana and Howell Heflin of Alabama -- raised new questions about its prospects , although Administration officials continued to predict a narrow victory . Tuesday ' s House vote gave the trade agreement an even wider margin of support than the Administration anticipated and some officials said the victory would buoy supporters in the Senate . At a morning rally of agriculture groups supporting the pact , Vice_President Al Gore predicted that the landmark steps to lower tariffs and cut trade_barriers would pass Congress , but he asked supporters to redouble efforts to lobby wavering lawmakers . &quot; I ' m . . . optimistic because the vote counts are coming_in in a way that tells us we ' re close to victory but we ' re not there yet , &quot; Gore said . &quot; We ' ve really got_to turn it on now. &quot; Administration officials said they were leaving nothing to chance in either Tuesday ' s vote or the more uncertain Senate vote . U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor lobbied lawmakers throughout the day , as did other Cabinet-level officials . Tuesday ' s vote was the first test of cooperation between Democrats and the Republicans who swept the Nov . 8 elections and will take_control of Congress next year . Incoming Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) has been working to pass the 124-nation trade agreement . &quot; To some degree , the more conservative and liberal members came_together ( in opposition ) and the philosophical middle of both parties conjoined , &quot; said Rep . Jim Leach ( R-Iowa ) . &quot; that ' s very significant. &quot; But other lawmakers cautioned that the bipartisan consensus achieved Tuesday will be difficult to reach in other , more politically charged initiatives that Republicans have vowed to pursue . &quot; The message here is that Congress has decided that free_trade makes us all more prosperous , &quot; said Rep . John R . Kasich ( R-Ohio ) . &quot; On this , Democrats and Republicans agree . But we ( Republicans ) have a game_plan and bipartisan cooperation is going_to depend_on ( Democrats ' ) understanding that we want less government. &quot; Republicans observed repeatedly that the trade agreement has a Republican pedigree -- it was largely negotiated under the Ronald Reagan and George_Bush administrations -- that made them more comfortable voting for it . &quot; To the people who have asked me how I can support anything that is supported by President Clinton , I remind them that even a broken clock is right twice a day , &quot; said Rep . Joe Knollenberg ( R-Mich. ) . &quot; And we must also remember that , while the Clinton_Administration may have put the final touches ( on the agreement ) , GATT was the brainchild of President Reagan. &quot; More on Trade : A special package of articles on the new_world trade accord has been adapted for the TimesLink on-line service by the editors of the National Journal .
