   <HEADLINE> ROBB WINS SENATE RENOMINATION IN VIRGINIA PRIMARY ; POLITICS : THE DEMOCRAT NOW FACES REPUBLICAN OLIVER L . NORTH AND TWO INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES , INCLUDING FORMER GOV . WILDER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sen . Charles S . Robb won renomination in the Virginia Democratic primary Tuesday , and plunged into a four-way contest for his seat that is already sending tremors across the national political landscape . With 100 % of the precincts reporting , Robb had 154 # 524 votes , or 58 % ; state Sen . Virgil H . Goode Jr . had 90 # 531 , or 34 % ; Richmond lawyer Sylvia Clute had 17 # 096 , or 6 % , and Lyndon H . LaRouche Jr . follower Nancy Spannaus had 4 # 505 , or 2 % . Goode conceded about 90 minutes after the polls closed and said he would support Robb in the Nov . 8 general_election . Robb faces challenges from an all-star cast : Iran-Contra figure Oliver L . North who is the Republican nominee and two independent candidates , former Republican state Atty . Gen . J . Marshall Coleman , and former Democratic Gov . L . Douglas Wilder . Both independents filed petitions this week claiming a place on the ballot , although they put_off formal announcements of their candidacies until later . Irony and frustration abound for both parties in this competition . &quot; Any untainted Democratic candidate could beat Ollie North , &quot; said Mary Washington College political analyst Mark Rozell . &quot; And any credible Republican candidate could beat Chuck Robb. &quot; Now most analysts seem to believe that any of the four could win . A poll released last week by Mason Dixon Opinion Research showed all_the candidates closely bracketed . Robb led in the survey with 28 % , followed by Coleman with 25 % , Wilder with 22 % and North with 21 % . &quot; I would n ' t bet a nickel on who the winner might be , &quot; said University of Virginia political analyst Larry J . Sabato . The Virginia Senate contest is one of a handful around the country whose outcome will determine whether the Democrats can continue to maintain their 56-44 control of the Senate , which is imperiled in November because of retirements , anti-incumbent feeling and President Clinton ' s unpopularity in some sections of the country . Moreover the campaign in the Old_Dominion exposes and underlines troublesome schisms within both national parties at a time when they are still trying to deal with the citizen discontent demonstrated by Ross Perot ' s nearly one-fifth of the vote_in the 1992 presidential election . Indeed some Perot supporters in Virginia are planning to organize a new party to back Coleman ' s candidacy . * &quot; The parties are finding it difficult to nominate candidates that are not leaving them vulnerable to attacks on their flanks , &quot; said Robert D . Holsworth , Virginia Commonwealth University political_scientist . &quot; This campaign in Virginia really shows the fracturing of the political_party system and I don ' t think this is the only time we ' re going to see this. &quot; On the Democratic side , state party chairman Mark Warner argued that the division in his party is not so damaging because it is based on the bitter personal differences between Robb and Wilder , rather than on ideological grounds . But as the nation ' s first elected black governor , Wilder is expected to draw the lion ' s share of the African American vote and thus could polarize the party along racial lines . &quot; Black leaders around the country have been trying to send a message to the Democratic Party that they better look seriously at their numbers , &quot; said Keith Haller , head of Potomac Research , a regional polling firm . &quot; Doug Wilder can certainly help them send that message if he takes 70 % of the black vote away from Robb. &quot; Recent polls show Wilder doing just that and some believe the figure will climb to close to 90 % in November . Among the Republicans , Coleman ' s campaign seems bound to pit party moderates against conservative Christians who provided much of the strength that helped North gain the nomination at the GOP state convention earlier this month . &quot; There is a major battle taking_place around the country for the heart and soul of the Republican_Party and that battle has become fully engaged here in Virginia , &quot; Rozell said . &quot; The far right here has taken_over the party and moderates feel alienated. &quot; The tension between these two forces was demonstrated last week immediately after North ' s nomination when Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) delayed endorsing North until after he had met with Coleman . Dole ultimately gave North his blessing . But Virginia ' s highest elected official , Sen . John W . Warner , is leading the charge against North , whom he considers unfit to serve in the Senate because of his Iran-Contra involvement , by rallying support for Coleman . Compounding this divisiveness are allegations of philandering and dabbling_in drugs against Robb and of lying to Congress against North . These charges , bound to be aired during the campaign , will call attention to issues of character , a potential liability for any number of politicians , including Clinton . &quot; This is definitely going_to raise the character issue more_than any other campaign in the country , &quot; said Democratic consultant Joe Trippi , an adviser to the campaign of state Sen . Goode , Robb ' s chief opponent in the primary . &quot; And if you have Paula Jones chasing you around it ' s not going_to help you , &quot; he added , referring to the former Arkansas employee whose civil_rights law suit against the President is based on charges of sexual impropriety . Analysts attributed much of the upheaval in Virginia to North ' s presence in the campaign . &quot; As an American folk hero for defying the Congress he epitomizes protest against the political_system , particularly the disenchantment among the religious right , &quot; said Tom Morris , president of Emery and Henry College . Morris believes that for all their problems , the two regular party nominees have the opportunity to define the campaign . &quot; A lot depends_on the extent to which Robb and North can hold_on to their respective party ' s base , &quot; he said . &quot; Robb and North are both damaged goods &quot; said the University of Virginia ' s Sabato . &quot; There is a reasonable chance that voters are going_to package them both as scandal-scarred and look_at the two independent candidates , Wilder and Coleman , who don ' t have the negatives the others have. &quot; That would mean the Senate_campaign could boil_down to a replay of the 1989 gubernatorial election , when Wilder barely edged out Coleman . * Back then , Democrats were riding high , particularly Robb . He had won election to the Senate the year before with more_than 70 % of the vote and was considered a contender for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination . One set of troubles started as a result of his differences with Wilder . Two Robb aides were accused of wiretapping Wilder ' s phone_calls and Robb was investigated by a grand_jury . He was not indicted but then long-simmering stories about personal indiscretions surfaced and Robb was criticized for his lack of candor in responding to them . In 1989 North was convicted by a federal jury of obstructing a congressional inquiry , although the conviction was ultimately set_aside on technical grounds . * Times staff writer Jeff Leeds contributed to this story .</TEXT>
