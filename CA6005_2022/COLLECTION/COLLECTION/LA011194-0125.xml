   <HEADLINE> MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ : PAST SUPER BOWL ADVERTISERS BECOME NO-SHOWS IN ' 94</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Super Bowl is a marketer ' s haven -- or so goes the super hype . But Subaru is still smarting -- if not shaken -- from its super flop during last year ' s big_game . The Japanese car_maker -- which aired five new TV spots during the 1993 Super Bowl -- woke_up the following day to discover that its commercials were chastised by an independent panel of consumers in USA Today , which rated the ads as the very worst aired the entire Super Bowl . Consumers won ' t hear a peep from Subaru this year as it joins a growing list of advertisers who believe that a no-show on Super Bowl Sunday can be a wise move . &quot; We ' ve since concluded that is a game we ' re not well-suited for , &quot; said Richard Marshall , a Subaru spokesman . Besides saving the company $ 2 million in broadcast time -- it might also save it some humiliation . Yet the ugly possibility of national ridicule is hardly stopping some of the nation ' s biggest marketers from spending $ 900 # 000 for every 30 seconds of TV commercial time they buy . NBC will rake_in more_than $ 50 million in ad revenues from the big_game on Jan . 30 at Atlanta ' s Georgia Dome . Only three ad slots are still available , said an NBC spokesman . But marketing experts warn that placing a TV spot on the Super Bowl guarantees just one thing : a super bill . * &quot; Nobody gets their money ' s worth in ad value -- only in ego satisfaction , &quot; said Walter A . Woods , a Carrollton , Ga.-based marketing consultant . &quot; The advertisers aren ' t even reaching people who are listening to them , &quot; said Katharine D . Paine , president of the Portsmith , N.H.-based Delahaye Group Inc. During commercials most viewers are typically &quot; going_to the bathroom , opening beer or replenishing the chip dish. &quot; And if , by some miracle , all 1.3 billion Super Bowl TV viewers worldwide watch the same 30-second TV spot , that doesn ' t mean they ' re going to rush_out and buy the product , said Tom_Collins , a New York-based author and marketing consultant . Collins suggests that the money might be_better spent on advertising that actually cultivates purchases by new customers -- like direct mail ads or TV infomercials . Indeed , unless an advertiser ' s Super Bowl commercial is a real humdinger , &quot; they might as well be giving their money to the Red_Cross , &quot; said Scott Purvis , president of Gallup &amp; Robinson Inc. , a Princeton , N.J. marketing research firm . * that ' s one reason why several other companies are joining Subaru in not returning for the 1994 Super Bowl , including Ford , Lee Apparel , Gillette , Miller Brewing Co. , Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Servistar . &quot; It ' s not worth all that money if you ' re not introducing a new product , &quot; said Gerry Donnelly , advertising manager for Ford ' s Lincoln / Mercury division , which advertised a new model on last year ' s telecast . &quot; There are other ways to spend that kind of money. &quot; Coca-Cola , which has snubbed the Super Bowl as an ad forum for several years , is passing again this year . &quot; It doesn ' t fit into our marketing strategy , &quot; company spokesman Ben Deutsch said . But such skepticism doesn ' t bother most major advertisers -- especially those that plan to introduce new products . Chrysler -- which hasn ' t advertised in a Super Bowl for eight years -- is betting big_time on this Super Bowl as the best place to introduce the Neon , its new , highly touted compact_car . Chrysler will air four 30-second ads -- created especially for the Super Bowl . * But auto_makers in particular have received very poor consumer reaction to Super Bowl advertising . Over the past three Super Bowls , not a single automotive advertiser registered more_than 10 % recall among consumers the day after the game , said Gallup ' s Purvis . That doesn ' t bother Chrysler . &quot; We want to make as much noise as we can -- as quickly as we can -- across America , &quot; said Jim Julow , director of marketing operations at Chrysler Corp . &quot; You can ' t find a better place to do_it than the Super Bowl. &quot; One advertiser , Frito-Lay , will introduce two new products . &quot; Even if we were panned for our ads -- which we won ' t be -- we ' re still going_to accomplish what we want in terms of awareness of our new products , &quot; said Brock Leach , vice_president of brand marketing at Frito-Lay , which will air ads for new Wavy Lay ' s potato_chips and for recently introduced Doritos brand Tortilla Thins . Frito-Lay will sponsor the Super Bowl ' s country music-themed halftime show . The Doritos ad features Chevy Chase -- on network TV for the first time since his short-lived Fox Television talk_show was dumped . And the Lay ' s ad will be a new twist on the comical &quot; Lay ' s Challenge. &quot; Three major sneaker makers have also bought broadcast time for this year ' s Super Bowl . Converse will introduce its $ 110 &quot; Backjam &quot; basketball shoe in a new TV spot -- a &quot; Wizard of Oz &quot; take-off -- featuring basketball star Larry Johnson as the ever-silly &quot; Grandmama &quot; &quot; No single event can get you this kind of exposure , &quot; said Joanna Jacobson , senior_vice_president of marketing at Converse . &quot; The picking and panning of Super Bowl commercials has become a sport in itself. &quot; Longtime Super Bowl advertiser Nike has two ads in the hopper -- both about the &quot; unsung heroes of basketball , &quot; said Keith Peters , a Nike spokesman . The ads -- filmed on basketball_courts across the country -- will also feature Michael Jordan and other Nike sports heroes . Reebok , meanwhile , will air a one-minute ad featuring basketball sensation Shaquille O ' Neal singing a song from his new rap album . &quot; Remember , this is the Super Bowl of advertising , &quot; said Reebok spokesman David Ropes . &quot; You ' ve got_to show_up if you want to be a player. &quot; Briefly . . . Three veteran Southern California advertising executives have joined forces to form Ground Zero_in Venice and have already landed their first client , the Daily Grill restaurant_chain . . . . Creative Images , a full-service ad_agency , has opened in Burbank . . . . The Long_Beach car audio_systems firm Kenwood U.S.A. has selected San Francisco-based Citron Haligman Bedecarre to handle its $ 5-million ad account formerly handled by Kresser / Craig of Santa Monica . . . . It will be slim pickings for new jobs in the public relations field in 1994 , with PR firms expected to hire fewer than two entry-level employees per office , according to a survey by the BohleCompany , a Los Angeles-based PR firm . . . . Marketers are showing strong interest in the Southern California Gay and Lesbian Exposition 1994 , to be held Jan . 28-30 at Santa Monica Airport . Not This Year A number of advertisers that bought_into last year ' s Super Bowl have begged_off the event this year . Here are what advertisers said are the reasons they aren ' t returning : * Lee Apparel : Committed broadcast money instead to upcoming Winter_Olympics . * Ford : No new product to introduce . * Gillette : No new product to introduce . * Subaru : Dissatisfied with results from last year ' s campaign . * Miller Brewing : Shut out when Anheuser-Busch became exclusive beer sponsor . * Servistar : Reallocating ad budget . Super Hype Advertisers are paying $ 900 # 000 for each 30-second segment of commercial time on NBC ' s telecast of the Super Bowl . Some of the major Super Bowl advertisers and the contents of their spots : * Anheuser-Busch : Bud Bowl ads feature former coaches Mike Ditka and &quot; Bum &quot; Phillips . * Chrysler : Four ads to introduce the Neon compact_car . * Nike : Ads promoting &quot; unsung heroes &quot; of basketball -- and Michael Jordan . * Reebok : Shaquille O ' Neal as basketball star-turned-rap singer . * Converse : A new_line of shoes to be introduced by &quot; Grandmama &quot; hoopster Larry Johnson . * McDonald ' s : Two NFL field_goal kickers square_off in an exaggerated competition . * Frito-Lay : An ad introducing Wavy Lay ' s potato_chips and Chevy Chase for Doritos . * Pepsi : Several flashy , new ads to promote Pepsi and Diet Pepsi brands . * Master Lock : One ad promoting durability of lock . * 7-Up : The animated 7-Up &quot; spot &quot; returns for another adventure . Federal Express , Goodyear and Alamo Car Rental will also be advertising , but information about their ads was not available .</TEXT>
