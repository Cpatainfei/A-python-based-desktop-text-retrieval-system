   <HEADLINE> BETTER LEFT UNSAID ? ; NOT DISCUSSING RACE MAY ALLOW US TO AVOID UNPLEASANT SITUATIONS . BUT SOME WONDER IF WE CAN EVER MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT CONFRONTING OUR FEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are no manuals . No widely syndicated columns offering tried-and-true advice , no well-worn para digms from which to trace a trail . If Thomas Brothers commissioned a clear map of the territory , retail-outlets -- the country and world over -- would struggle to keep it on the racks . Many wander through this maze -- foggy as it is forbidding -- and it often seems impossible to find the way_out . Stumbling free , one hopes never to repeat the trip . For all_the well-meaning attempts to build bridges , the discussion of race remains , even now , taboo -- off-limits like personal finance queries or religious discussions among strangers . Race is the crashing crystal at the well-appointed dinner_party at dusk . The only difference is that , afterward , seldom does anyone offer to help clean_up the mess . In San Francisco ' s North Beach , shortly after 5 p.m. , five women install themselves at a cocktail_table . The drink is wine ; the topic , women ' s issues . Conversation blooms surprisingly exploratory , commensurately emotional . One shares details of her rape , more_than a dozen years past . The others are compassionate , holding the speaker protectively in their collective gaze . Until , that is , she mentions that her attacker was black . Conversation careens into a wall of silence . Eyes shift to goings-on outside or are suddenly transfixed to the table ' s water rings . The women -- two black , three white -- shift in their seats until one voice ( a black_woman ' s ) gingerly pulls them from silence . &quot; I felt prickly all_over my body . I felt slapped , personally chastised for bringing it up , &quot; says the woman , who is white . The experience has permanently altered the way she tells the tale . Since it was never discussed , she can only ponder the details , the roots of silence : &quot; My perception was that the discomfort was about something I said . I guess they felt that I was feeding a stereotype. &quot; Not harboring race-based resentment , she says , she was simply blindly grabbing at details , filling_in the picture . &quot; I made ( all_the women ) uncomfortable and I felt bad for bringing it up . It had the effect , &quot; she says with a leaden laugh , &quot; of the sinking of the Titanic. &quot; Altering a_few details , this scenario is probably uncomfortably familiar . Maybe you were there , maybe you spoke the words . Or maybe you were_on the receiving end . If so , you ' ve probably had time to ponder the possible outcomes and decide which is worse : A storm of words or a blanket of silence ? Slogans of peace and harmony that haunt the recent past ring hollow , sometimes inspiring a cynical chuckle . The reticence to broach matters of race and have adult -- and , quite possibly , charged -- discussions only underscores a nation ' s failings and the arduous work ahead . &quot; The inability to talk_about race in anything resembling honest terms compounds the very misunderstanding that renders silence necessary , &quot; writes Ellis Cose , contributing editor and essayist for Newsweek , in his book &quot; The Rage of a Privileged Class. &quot; &quot; For those blacks_and_whites who come_into closest contact , it stands as a huge barrier to their ever truly accepting one another or finding common ground. &quot; Like a tumbleweed , the subject of race gathers all sorts of cast-aside delicate issues in the course of its travels : class or privilege , or an exact definition of who and what is racist . People prefer not to have that tense , if not unpleasant conversation . Instead we walk in circles ; talk in metaphors . The avoidance at times is as intricate and showy as a modern_dance phrase . &quot; There are no social graces when race is concerned , &quot; says Patricia D . Johnson , 35 , a counselor who specializes in interracial / multicultural issues . &quot; I know when I walk in a room and start talking_about it , people bounce off the walls or the room goes silent . But I realize that is so unconscious . . . . People just are so afraid. &quot; The fear manifests in various guises , finds roots in fertile ground . There is fear of committing a faux pas ; fear of the consequential reprimand -- just for starters . And some feel most uncomfortable tackling the subject in racially or ethnically mixed groups , fearful they lack not just the knowledge , but the language to do so as well . In his collection of essays , &quot; Race Matters , &quot; professor and theologian Cornel West says most Americans &quot; remain trapped in the narrow framework of the dominant liberal and conservative views of race in America , which with its worn-out vocabulary leaves us intellectually debilitated , morally disempowered and personally depressed. &quot; Still others ponder whether they may harbor deep-seated racism that might leap from their lips at an inopportune moment , or that a comment may_not be perceived as &quot; politically correct &quot; enough . More and more often , well-meaning souls are afraid to step into that fraught arena , Johnson has found . For some , the tentativeness is so great , they subconsciously choose not to address , let alone recognize , the_matter . Rather , they deny its very existence . &quot; It ' s just really scary to talk_about it , &quot; Johnson says , &quot; because emotions run so high when you do . I ( see people ) going_out and attempting to do ( race-related ) work who still have some reservations about dealing with the subject . The repercussions can be a strong incentive not to touch the issues . &quot; There are days where I don ' t want to deal with it . It ' s hard. &quot; In the midst of the dramatic sidestepping , it ' s easy to lose sight of precisely what is being avoided , what needs be discussed . Much of the necessity for dialogue about race deals with enhancing one ' s education and broadening a social or professional circle . It requires working to demystify the &quot; other &quot; through contact and education , thus shattering blindly accepted stereotypes . Given the level of anxiety over even broaching the subject , the solutions aren ' t as unfathomable as they might seem . Bridging the chasm mostly requires a little patience and common_sense . &quot; We could really move ( the discussion ) forward , &quot; says performance artist and gay activist Luis Alfaro , &quot; but that only happens when you take that mask down . We come_to this thing with very mixed feelings about language , about community . . . . ( You ) have to hear people talk_about resentment . . . about rage and anger . We ' re not going_to get_over that unless we are going_to deal with those things . And there really isn ' t any criteria for this. &quot; For some Angelenos , April 29 , 1992 , served as an impetus . Not waiting until the smoke cleared , the events of three days forced the issues of race and class not simply to the front page , but to the dinner_table , cocktail_party and locker_room as well . For some , it made_it that much more difficult to formulate questions and opinions ; for others , it provoked a long-couched dialogue -- often for the better . Others believe that the avoidance of this abstract , now given flesh-and-bone import , is lodged somewhere at the root of what turned_into L.A. ' s -- pick your term -- civil unrest , riots , disturbances . The feelings that lie behind the language we use ( or choose not to ) are clouded by a patina of euphemism . Forced to look_at our inadequate language , at insensitive jokes and sarcasm often standing_in place of probing conversations about issues of difference , it is difficult to predict a future trajectory . Rhetoric and platitudes are easy . But can they bring_about change ? The old routes are well-traveled , and those most accustomed to them take their directions by reading the winds . Silence , and the codes embroidered within it , have long dominated . We have become conversant in signs that masquerade as language . Some call it antennae , others say it ' s common_sense . &quot; I remember this one guy , whose name was John . He was white , &quot; says Byron Bonner , 34 , an African American who grew_up in L.A. &quot; The only thing that John and I had in common was that we liked to build model cars . It was cool for him to come_over to my house . . . . But me going_over to his house ? No . I had to sneak into his bedroom window. &quot; Bonner says they never discussed the ritual , and he never questioned it . Nor did he examine how he felt about it : &quot; His parents didn ' t like black people . . . . I don ' t know why or how ( I knew ) . Anytime you have to crawl through the bedroom window , that pretty much lets you know. &quot; Bonner has long since abandoned silence . He found that by not addressing issues when they arose , his anger grew_into something larger , more difficult to define . Racial slurs or sloppy assumptions about &quot; just who and what is black &quot; prompted him , instead , to fortify his walls : &quot; In college , I was ' Mr. Militant ' . . . ( now I realize ) I could have handled it a lot better , instead of walking_around evangelizing and preaching . I was really . . . pissed off. &quot; Balancing pride and tolerance , a mellowed Bonner believes , is an education unto itself . And deciding when to don the teacher ' s mantle when it comes_to the issues of race takes more_than social savvy . It takes , he says , a diplomat ' s skills : &quot; I ' m not shy about raising it if it needs to be . And it really is about educating people who don ' t really know a lot . There is intentional ( racism ) and there is stupidity . . . . I don ' t claim to know all_the answers . I know what I know . And it all depends : Do I feel_like telling these people what I know ? Do I feel_like arguing with them when they challenge my knowledge ? &quot; This enervating process , Bonner notes , doesn ' t ensure plaudits : &quot; I can ' t remember the last time . . . when I walked away feeling , ' I think that person really learned something. ' At this age , I think people pretty much are set_in their beliefs and all you can do is try to . . . catch them in an open-minded moment . . . . ( But ) if it ' s not a high priority it won ' t get done . &quot; I think people know what to do . They ' re just too lazy to do it. &quot; For some , the wager is far too high : emotional fireworks , public embarrassment or loss of a friendship . People_of_color say they find themselves exhausted by the effort of explaining , while many whites fear saying something that will brand them racist -- forever . At 28 , Marcus Kuiland-Nazario , of Puerto Rican descent , feels frustrated by the psychological impasse : &quot; Even though I have white friends , I feel as though there is a wall between us that will never come down. &quot; When race-charged issues arise , he also saves his words for those he believes will truly hear : &quot; I have some white friends who are aware . Some of them understand . And there are others ( with whom ) I know it is pointless to discuss these issues . . . because they are so myopic . But I don ' t want to just ' preach it to the choir ' either. &quot; This selective approach , however , doesn ' t stop him from honing in on particularly egregious remarks , then administering something a bit more severe than a verbal wrist-tapping . &quot; People_of_color ( are ) going_to talk_about this now . . . like it or not , &quot; he says . &quot; And the dominant culture is not used to us speaking up. &quot; Such confrontations , Kuiland-Nazario notes , are more often than not met with hostility , defensiveness and anger . Unfortunately , it is often impossible to quell the rage and move to reasoning , he says : &quot; ( People ) get really angry because I ' m challenging a belief that they ' ve held for most of their lives . . . . It ' s like I ' m telling them that they are never going_to get_married , or that they are never going_to have an orgasm again . . . . People are just really angry . People don ' t like to be wrong. &quot; Essayist Pearl Cleage calls them &quot; weird race moments &quot; -- the almost tangible limbo that exists between instantaneously regrettable words and the dreaded reaction . One minute that feels_like five hours , or a bomb that blasts in a nanosecond . Janet Fitch can ' t forget hers . &quot; I remember going_to my first sleep-away at ' Y ' camp . I must have been a second-grader , &quot; says Fitch , 38 . &quot; You know how kids make fantasy games . . . I was into exotica at that time , Cleopatra movies . . . and I remember telling a girl whose bunk was above mine , ' Let ' s play Cleopatra . I ' ll be the queen and you ' ll be the slave. ' &quot; She , a black girl , hit the roof ( and shouted ) ' I ' m not your slave ! ' I had a moment of epiphany . Gee , I was really sorry . Because my conception of ' the slave ' was someone with a fan . . . . I certainly never put it together . . . . And that was a shock. &quot; Fitch , who grew_up near the Crenshaw District and now counsels teen-agers at Foshay Junior_High , says she ' s still cautious wandering down certain avenues of conversation : &quot; They ( the administrators ) say to ' try and talk to kids about their feelings , ' but I ' m very . . . hesitant to talk to them about race . I don ' t know about the theories or the current philosophy of how ' politically correct ' people deal with the subject . &quot; The ( student body ) is just black and Chicano , and we never do talk_about race , because I ' m very conscious of being this white_person , ' coming_down ' to help . I am helping these kids . . . but as somebody who was raised in the ' 60s , the image of the ' white bleeding-heart liberal ' going_down to the ' ghetto ' to help these ' poor kids , ' was drummed into me at the time as so offensive. &quot; The whirlwind that has developed around race , without the language to explore it , has rendered people not just cautious , but silent , too timid to take risks or wander out on a limb . &quot; There is an element in the black community that is very anti-white , &quot; Fitch notes , &quot; and there is an element that says , ' Let ' s more_than get_along , let ' s see where the other is coming from . . . . But as a liberal white_person , you never know whether you will be appreciated , tolerated or they wished you ' d stayed home. &quot; Yet , she says , &quot; You don ' t know unless you do it. &quot; Fitch believes that 1992 ' s civil disturbances served to rebuild , as well as_to reinforce urban fear , the after-images wreaking havoc on interpersonal dialogue : &quot; I think nobody expected that it would have such a long-term negative reverberation on people who had been doing pretty well . That fear element came back. &quot; It simply has added another complex layer to an already prickly matter . Listening to people unwittingly make sweeping generalizations about different races , she says , makes one ask : &quot; Has this generated a new emotion or is it uncovering an emotion that was always there ? &quot; Although priming discussions about race initially may be difficult , they ' re almost impossible to quell once they ' ve gathered steam . Endless anecdotes unfold . One memory births three . Although it may begin with a hesitant stutter or a couched inquiry , there seems to be a real desire to try to get things right . This basic inability to talk affects the real work , just as backstage concern moved_out of the abstract for those at Rebuild L.A. &quot; We live_in a society where we define politeness in a way that encourages avoidance , &quot; says Jackie Dupont-Walker , 47 , RLA ' s senior project director and manager of urban development / housing . &quot; So it is impolite to confront a reality that may be unpleasant for a moment , even if we realize that it might bring us to a better situation ultimately . I think it ' s very difficult in L.A. , where there is such a large_number of subcultures , for us to really avoid it without creating problems. &quot; Not recognizing and discussing differences , and not addressing flagrant acts or remarks , she says , is precisely what has lowered the volume on discourse : &quot; So , for example , if I ' m in a work setting and somebody happens to say something that is particularly insensitive to me as a black_person , I don ' t make them feel uncomfortable by pointing it out . I just kind of go_along and say later how awful it was . &quot; There are ways to deal with that . And yes , there might be a moment of discomfort . But what we ' re talking_about is creating the kind of sensitivities that ( will help us ) learn to respect and love each other differently. &quot; Dupont-Walker looks_at RLA as a microcosm , its membership -- like the city ' s populace -- realizing that these long-cordoned-off zones of difference must be examined . A community could not mend physically unless attention was paid to its spiritual welfare . &quot; So we had a Racial Harmony Task_Force that was fairly diverse , &quot; she says . &quot; ( In ) their initial days , they found they had to deal with personal pain before they could deal with community pain . Some people were not willing to go_through the personal pain . So while a large_number of people signed_up , when they started to deal with those kinds of issues , people tended to go away. &quot; Antonia Hernandez , 45 , a task_force co-chairwoman , recalls the arduous process of scaling interpersonal walls : &quot; People we ' re sort of posturing in the beginning . . . finger-pointing , playing ( their ) roles . But unless we went beyond the posturing , the committee would n ' t exist . The ( task_force ) wasn ' t going_to be a vehicle for just a lot of haranguing . We had to respect one another and listen , no matter how out-to-lunch you thought someone was. &quot; The Asian community &quot; felt very hurt , the African American community felt hurt . We just kept working together . . . . We tried to listen to all_of the anger and really talk . . . to respect and understand the difference , &quot; she says . &quot; I don ' t know where RLA is going as an institution , ( but ) I do know that there are more people with goodwill in L.A. The city needs to deal with this issue . We are the most multicultural community in the world . And if we don ' t make_it here , we won ' t make_it anywhere. &quot; Dupont-Walker allows that the task_force is not unlike many other bicultural dialogues that optimistically started_up , then ultimately lost their thunder : &quot; Having participated in some of them , I am of the opinion that they refused to deal with the tough issues . I think we have this history of setting_up something that appears to accomplish a goal , without really struggling with the goal . . . . When we got_to those issues that were troublesome , we tended to run_away from them. &quot; The real question , says Larry Fondation , 36 , of the South Central Organizing Committee , is whether you can move from just talking_about issues to action . Given the city ' s diversity , it seems silly not to confront race issues , says Fondation , who is white but often finds himself speaking_to black and Latino congregations , preaching the import of various grass-roots issues -- from housing to liquor laws . &quot; I try to be conscious and sensitive of how I ' m dealing with people . And I don ' t always succeed , &quot; he says . &quot; You just try just to continue to be open , and ask other people to be the same in return. &quot; For some , he believes , there is &quot; sort of automatic comfort being around others of the same background . But it isn ' t realistic . The city will be largely Latino and there are those . . . who are not looking_at that . So when people ask me . . . what I ' m doing here , I tell them I think ( these issues ) affect all_of us . If I can ( communicate ) that successfully , I do_it . If I can ' t , I ' ll move_on . And try to find somebody else to talk to. &quot; For others also attempting to forge coalitions , mining for the common bond is often bandied as the glue . The push is to connect similarities rather than linger_over the differences . Luis Alfaro , however , warns against blind idealism . A common bond doesn ' t always ensure unity , especially if racial and cultural issues are swept into the corners . A member of the Gay_Men of Color Consortium , Alfaro , 32 , says he too was initially much more idealistic : &quot; I thought we were going_to create this sort of very interesting rainbow , ( but ) what ' s been really apparent to me is our differences . I think we know what the common goals are . But we don ' t know how to talk to each other . It ' s really , really hard to talk and not offend , and to stay conscious . And you cannot come_into it with all_of this baggage. &quot; Since the riots , he has also noted a growing cavalierism , a sort of verbal countercurrent that devilishly plays fast and loose with the subjects of race and culture . But this strain of candor isn ' t always constructive , he says , and the bulk of it is informed racism . &quot; This is the time to heal , &quot; says Alfaro , wincing at the cliche . &quot; It is the time to bring it out_in the open , lay your cards on the table . But really , it hasn ' t been that at all . It ' s been people sorta laying their racism on the table. &quot; Racism ' s sting aside , he says , the communication process brings enough pain : &quot; You can ' t make the opera if you don ' t start with the street theater . And the process of understanding each other , and negotiating each other , sort of gets thrown by the wayside . &quot; Activists are offended by the lack of process . We ' re just supposed to love each other , we ' re supposed to just understand each other and the truth is that it is just a very complex issue . . . and when you start to get_into those territories , you really have to start to figure_out all those little things that come_into play . Expression is not a very valued commodity . And until then , ' proper expression ' -- whatever that is -- is not going_to be allowed to come_to fulfillment. &quot; Counselor Patricia Johnson says that fulfillment -- with all its rosy connotations -- comes from raising the shade of denial . She hopes to help people face fear and anger , to uncover what lies beneath . &quot; For those who really want to try and understand and open_up . . . I try and start to help people deal with their own emotions -- the anger , their own rage , &quot; she says . &quot; I just allow them to talk_about their experience . . . to express how they feel , because I really don ' t believe that unless we are willing to look_at our own stuff , we can ' t go_out and point a finger. &quot; Once people identify the roots of the more dramatic emotions , then sift through what is indeed a racial issue and what is personal , it is easier to disengage from the conflicts when they arise , she says : &quot; Some people are easier to move there than others . And I don ' t move them . It ' s their willingness to move . I think people really do want to have intelligent , informed conversations about these things. &quot; Some think the solution is a conundrum for children to ponder ; others look_to the sages . But much of it , most agree , will come from breaking_out of self-segregation , wandering unfamiliar territories . At the heart is understanding the pain of the process and the importance of forgiveness . &quot; We all need education , &quot; says Phyllis Moberly , 44 , a local publicist . &quot; If I make a faux pas , what I wish is that the person I am talking to could have some faith in my goodwill and take the opportunity to educate me -- even if it is with some anger . . . . I live_in fear of saying something stupid or that ' s going_to hurt someone ' s feelings . I don ' t want to do that . But what happens . . . is that it makes_it easier not to even try. &quot; Moberly , who is white , speaks_of constructing bridges as an antidote to uneasiness . &quot; I think that people need to find a context , a place where they are involved with people of other cultures . . . . Some sort of community or artistic event . . . where you have a reason to become acquainted with . . . people , so conversation can happen. &quot; Janet Fitch says people don ' t have to go_to Florence and Normandie to contact the &quot; black community &quot; : &quot; You have more in common with people who are in the same neighborhood or who have the same interests as you . To go_down to Martin_Luther_King and Vermont and say : ' Here I am , I want to be friends with you ! ' . . . is a joke. &quot; Because opportunities tend to shrink as one matures , broadening one ' s monochromatic circle can take a little work and lots of creativity . The first attempts more_than likely will be awkward . &quot; The race thing is not unknown waters . It ' s just a tiny effort , &quot; Fitch assures . But a half-hearted effort is easily unmasked : &quot; Just going_to a black club isn ' t going_to change you in any way . I know people who have more_than a little problem with racism in their head or . . . ( who say ) ' I marched in the race day parade , but I still don ' t have a black friend who I can have a beer with. ' &quot; One of L.A. ' s premiums , says Anjali Raval , &quot; is that you can actually live someone ' s culture without leaving the country. &quot; Raval , an Indian born in Kenya , is experienced in cracking cultural codes and understanding the importance of racial sensitivity . &quot; I don ' t hesitate to ask questions and I would hope that nobody ' s hesitant to ask me , &quot; says Raval , 28 . &quot; I don ' t put_out a vibe that I would be offended if anybody asked me what the dot on my forehead or my nose_ring means . There ' s a difference between being ignorant and just innocently not knowing. &quot; What knowledge cannot be attained through interpersonal communication and experience is thus left to other , larger channels . That too takes a commitment . &quot; I think the media has been fanning this fire for a long_time , &quot; Marcus Kuiland-Nazario says . &quot; And media ( needs ) to be responsible -- for real . Not that hogwash ' 60s stuff . Not a two-minute ( public_service announcement ) . But a town_hall meeting with Clinton up there. &quot; He admits that he holds no easy answers , &quot; but I am here to push the button real hard . There are other people who need to do their work . I think everybody needs to make a commitment to try to change things. &quot; Each day we walk_out the door , he says , &quot; we put ourselves out on the limb . I think if you are going_to enter this dialogue , it ' s not about your expectations . You have to just see what happens . . . be open_to the experience . And it ' s a challenge . It ' s the biggest challenge of our time. &quot;</TEXT>
