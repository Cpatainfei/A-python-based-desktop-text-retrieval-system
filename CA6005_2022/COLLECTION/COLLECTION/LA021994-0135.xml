   <HEADLINE> CREDIT_CARD WAR ERUPTS AT OLYMPICS ; ADVERTISING : IOC ACCUSES AMERICAN EXPRESS CO . OF ' AMBUSH MARKETING ' IN CAMPAIGN AIMED AT RIVAL VISA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The International Olympic Committee lashed_out Friday at American Express Co. , accusing the company of being a parasite at the Winter Games . The argument over what the IOC called &quot; ambush marketing &quot; stems from an American Express television commercial promoting the availability of its services in Norway . A voice-over says : &quot; So if you ' re traveling_to Norway , you ' ll need a passport but you don ' t need a Visa. &quot; The ad angered both the IOC and rival company Visa , which is an official Olympic sponsor with exclusive_rights to provide credit_card services at Games venues . American Express was giving a misleading impression it had an Olympic connection and had refused to withdraw the ad_campaign , the IOC said . The committee said it would allow Visa to retaliate . &quot; This is the fifth successive Olympic Games in which American Express has falsely implied such a connection , &quot; said IOC executive board_member Dick Pound . &quot; Unfortunately , it appears to be American Express corporate policy , deliberately established at the highest level , to try to appropriate the goodwill of the Olympics without in any way supporting them . &quot; American Express does no service to itself , to its members , to athletes and the American public by pretending to hide behind customer service during a blatant parasite campaign. &quot; American Express responded by saying the IOC was engaged in a campaign of intimidation and vowed it would not bow to what it said were empty threats . American Express spokesman Frank Vaccaro said in Lillehammer that the company was countering its rival ' s campaign to lead the public to believe only Visa cards could be used at the Games . Visa ' s advertising suggested only its cards would be accepted at the Olympics , whereas American Express was welcomed at virtually all hotels , restaurants and tourist shops in Lillehammer , he said . &quot; American Express does not require permission from Visa or the IOC to serve our card members or to let them know we are present in Norway , &quot; he said . &quot; We have been in Norway since 1916 and operate customer services throughout the country . &quot; A $ 40-million sponsorship payment by Visa to the IOC will not change that , &quot; he said . &quot; Visa ' s purchase of the Olympic rings is not a license to mislead consumers. &quot; Vaccaro said American Express advertising used no Olympic symbols or imagery nor did_it depict any sports events . Visa Senior_Vice_President John Bennett said in a statement : &quot; Visa stands_by the accuracy of our advertising . Visa is the only card accepted at the 1994 Olympic Winter Games. &quot; IOC Marketing Director Michael Payne said he believed American Express , a former Olympic sponsor , was regretting ending its connection with the Games . &quot; I think they ' re feeling the pinch on sponsorship , &quot; he said . Payne said there had been other examples of ambush marketing at the Games . He said a third credit_card company , Mastercard , had withdrawn 200 # 000 maps of the Olympic region . Toyota Motor Corp . stopped an ad in Australia suggesting it supported the Australian team in Lillehammer after the country ' s Olympic committee got a court injunction , he added .</TEXT>
