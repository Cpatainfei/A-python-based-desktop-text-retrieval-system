   <HEADLINE> O.C. ENTERPRISE / ANNE MICHAUD : PET OWNERS DO GROOMING AT JOY SELF DOG WASH ; AT ' SHAMPOOCH ' IN ORANGE , THE CUSTOMER PROVIDES THE ANIMAL AND THE BUSINESS PROVIDES THE SOAP , TOWELS AND TUBS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fistfuls of hair in the drain pipes , a dirty tub , a bathroom that looks as if it was wetted down with a hose . Such are the pleasures of bathing a dog or cat . Compared with that scene , Joy Self Dog Wash is what its name promises , said co-owner Benjamin Park -- a joy . The shop offers soap and towels , brushes and protective aprons , eight clean tubs and short leashes to hook the pet ' s collar and keep Fido or Muffy in place . There are ramps to lead heavy dogs into tubs too . Pet owners can stop by and give their pet a wash for $ 6.99 for a cat or small dog to $ 12.99 for an extra-large dog . Anti-flea soap or powder costs extra . Park , who opened his Orange shop in November with partner Peter Kim , said customers include the Orange Police_Department and lots of parents with their kids . &quot; It ' s nice for families , &quot; he said . Park and Kim said they believe theirs is Orange County ' s first self pet wash -- sometimes called &quot; shampooches. &quot; There are at least three in Los Angeles County , and the number is growing , according to industry watchers . Petlist , a Brooklyn , N.Y. , company that supplies tubs and grooming tables , has outfitted about a dozen self pet washes around the nation , and it has orders for seven more . Petlist ' s controller Andrea Roach said at least three large pet supply companies are also planning to launch their own chains . Roach said her company ' s sales were up 20 % last year because of the volume orders . The self-wash shops generally use three to eight tubs , versus one or two tubs used by professional groomers . Pet groomers charge $ 22 or more to bathe and comb a dog or cat . The self washes offer a less expensive alternative . Roach said she doesn ' t believe groomers will suffer from the competition , though . They clip nails and clean ears during a bath session , which many amateurs cannot do . Groom &amp; Board magazine agrees . In a May , 1991 , article , the magazine said that self washes seem to attract customers who would normally bathe pets at_home , instead of luring people away from professional groomers . The self washes &quot; tend to do_well in middle-class and upper-middle-class neighborhoods , rather than elite areas , &quot; said Karen Long MacLeod , editor of the Chicago-based trade publication . &quot; The elite tend to go_to a groomer for bathing. &quot; The do-it-yourself washes have thrived in urban_areas , MacLeod said . They are in Chicago , New York and Los Angeles . &quot; The volume of dogs ( in metropolitan areas ) would support it , &quot; said MacLeod . Also , &quot; clearly , if you ' re keeping your dog inside , you ' ll want to bathe him more often. &quot; Self washes may have grown_up in urban_areas , but they were born in the middle of California farm country in Carmichael in 1989 . It was a combination professional grooming salon and do-it-yourself wash . Many shops combine the services , MacLeod said . Do-it-yourself shops sometimes have a groomer on_hand to do the work that requires some skill , such_as fur clipping . Groomers can also suggest products to relieve skin and coat problems . In Orange , Park and his two employees are equipped more with affection for animals than with any professional grooming talent . Park closed a 12-year-old landscaping business , Evergreen Landscaping , last January because , at 55 , his shoulders were too stiff for the work . He is a native of Korea who moved to Orange 15 years ago so that his four sons could receive an education in the United States , he said . Now , the sons are adults -- the youngest is in law_school . So , Park said , he does not need as much money as he once did , and he decided to enter a field of work simply for the love of it . He and Kim , who are friends from church , visited self washes in Burbank and Culver City before they opened their shop Nov . 21 . They established it near a strip of pet supply stores , one of which Kim owns , on Chapman Avenue . Park said 37 pets , on average , bathe at Joy each week . He is hoping for a good crop of fleas this spring , which he figures will push that number up_to 50 by the summer .</TEXT>
