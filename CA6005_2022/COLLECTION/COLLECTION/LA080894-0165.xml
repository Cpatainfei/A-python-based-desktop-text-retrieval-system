   <HEADLINE> WILDLIFE BIOLOGISTS ARE SHARING BEST OF 2 WORLDS ; ECOLOGY : BRAZILIAN SCIENTIST HOPES TO TAKE_HOME IDEAS FROM VOLUNTEER AND PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT SHE IS OBSERVING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The often dry and wind-swept landscapes of the Channel Islands seem an unlikely training ground for a woman charged with protecting the lush rain_forests of southern Brazil . But through an exchange program hosted by wildlife biologists in Ventura , Maria Elisa Castellanos Sola will take_home valuable tips to help her manage the endangered and disappearing jungles in the state of Minas Gerais . The dark-haired Sola is at once excited and intensely serious as she talks_about her plans to set_up volunteer and public education programs such_as the ones she saw in Ventura County . On Santa Cruz Island , for instance , she watched high_school students work as volunteers in a summer program with the Nature Conservancy to repair fences , rid the island of non-native plants and do general maintenance . Each evening , groups of students prepared a short presentation on the work they had done that day , and the issues involved . &quot; While these children are doing this hard work , they are also learning about the environment , &quot; Sola said . &quot; When you have kids working with preservation , you teach them something they could not learn in a classroom . It was really beautiful to see this. &quot; That combination of teaching and tapping the potentially vast network of free labor through volunteers will be incorporated in a similar program in Brazil , she said . &quot; This is my plan -- to have a program like this , this year , &quot; Sola said . Sola is one of two scientists from Latin_America chosen to come_to the county this year as part of a program aimed at exchanging information and experiences , learning from American mistakes and profiting from successes . The eight-week course , known as the Exchange Program for Latin_American Protected Area Managers , was conceived by Marc Weitzel , a Ventura-based U . S . Fish and Wildlife biologist whose duties include leading the California_condor recovery team . The exchange program is funded by Fish and Wildlife ' s Office of International Affairs . Eventually , the 2-year-old program will also send U . S . scientists to Latin_America to learn from that region ' s experiences as well . &quot; We have to think_of protecting natural_resources in a global context , &quot; Weitzel said . &quot; Everything we do is interrelated. &quot; The air and water that is cleansed and purified by the rain_forests of Brazil is important to the entire region , he said . &quot; One could look_at the entire Western_Hemisphere as a single ecosystem. &quot; For instance , migratory birds , which spend many months of the year in Ventura County , spend their winters in Latin_America . &quot; Natural_resources do not respect political boundaries , &quot; he said . To protect endangered species in California , their habitats in Latin_America must also be preserved , he said . Sola ' s stint in the United States began in Ventura County , where it ends this week . She visited the Hopper Mountain Wildlife Refuge , where biologists lived during the first months that the endangered California_condors were reintroduced to the wild in the nearby Sespe Condor Sanctuary . Sola also spent a_few days with the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary staff , visiting Santa Cruz Island . She said she found that Brazil and the Channel Islands have similar problems related to ranching . In both places , introducing domestically bred animals for human consumption destroys the environment . On the islands , grazing animals destroy native grasses and shrubs ; in Brazil , the ranchers cut_down the forest to make_way for pastures for grazing or for coal mining . The farmers in Brazil contract to work for large companies that own the land , Sola said . &quot; They are very poor people who go inside the forest to cut for the industry , &quot; she said . &quot; They do not know what they are allowed to do and the industry does not tell them. &quot; It is her task to educate them and help them understand the law and why it is important to protect the waterways and hillsides , Sola said . &quot; On the island , the problems are not what the farmer does not know , &quot; she said . &quot; It is more of a management problem. &quot; Ranching is still allowed on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands until the property can be acquired by the National_Park_Service or until current leases run_out . The exchange program has also taken Sola to Salton Sea , northeast of San Diego ; the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve ; Stillwater National Wildlife Reserve in Fallon , Nev. ; Sequoia and Kings Canyon national_parks , and the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in Newark . That preserve , one of the largest of its kind completely surrounded by urbanized area , has an active cadre of 120 volunteers and two centers that host thousands of schoolchildren every year for educational tours , workshops and day_camps . The center also has a program that teaches teachers how to teach conservation . that ' s important in an area where it is conservatively estimated that 85 % of the marshes have been filled_in for development , said John Steiner , chief of public use for the refuge . that ' s why the refuge concentrates a good_deal of attention on public education , especially for children . &quot; They have a great time and fall_asleep exhausted on the bus on the way home , and they ' ve learned something they will never forget , &quot; Steiner said of the children . &quot; Our goal is that by the time the children are able to vote , that they will know what they will be losing and understand the importance of a salt marsh. &quot; Sola lauded the Bay Area program as well . &quot; They try to give the children a whole vision about the environment at all levels , nature and culture , &quot; she said . &quot; They learn to appreciate their place in time over the millennia. &quot; Sola said she will use at_home what she learned about the use of volunteers as well as the educational_programs . But the flow of information has not been one-way , Weitzel and Sola said . In Minas Gerais , where the environmental laws are considered more advanced than in the rest of Brazil , landowners must set_aside 20 % of their property to remain wild . That segment is chosen by the government so that the state will always have contiguous wild areas . In addition , all_of the watershed is protected . &quot; The rivers and lakes are owned by the federation , &quot; she said . She also gave slide presentations on the programs her institute operates . But Sola said she takes_home a wealth of ideas that she is eager to put into place . She looks_to the strong models she has seen here as a means to marry the people with the conservation goals of her agency . &quot; The real origin of our problems is that we did not consider ourselves and our culture as part of the environment , &quot; she said . &quot; We have tended to separate the two. &quot; Her intention is to use what she learned to help people &quot; better understand where we are in the planet. &quot; And by so doing , she said , she intends to help preserve it .</TEXT>
