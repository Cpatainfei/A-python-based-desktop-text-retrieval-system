   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVES ON D-DAY ; ON OMAHA BEACH , AMERICA BIDS FAREWELL TO EUROPE ; THE CLINTON GENERATION ' S ENERGIES ARE FOCUSED_ON ASIA ; OUR CONTINENTAL FIXATION RECEDES TO THE SENTIMENTAL PAST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The import of President Clinton ' s participation in the 50th-anniversary celebrations of D-day is that it marks America ' s historical farewell to Europe . While America ' s cultural mind-set will of course remain in the Western humanistic tradition born in Europe , its destiny is now more linked to Asia . Clinton is the first American President with a post-Atlanticist imagination . Unlike any previous U.S. leader in the post-World War II era , Clinton ' s formative experiences had more to do with Ho Chi Minh and Honda than Stalin or Churchill . Clinton ' s experiences as a student activist were focused_on the Vietnam_War ; his experiences as a governor , like most American governors in the 1970s and ' 80s , were focused_on the issues of jobs , education and training linked to &quot; competitiveness &quot; vis-a-vis the Japanese juggernaut and its Asian-tiger neighbors . None of this is to say that Clinton will be irresponsible concerning America ' s commitments in Europe , or that he lacks the proper respect for those who died on the battlefields of Europe to make the world safe for democracy . But the emotive element of Clinton ' s presidency is elsewhere . How Clinton thinks_about Europe is probably very similar to the way most Americans do . That view was perhaps best , if inadvertently , expressed by former Vice_President Walter Mondale , who came_to Washington after Clinton was elected looking_for a &quot; serious &quot; job . When offered an ambassadorship to Britain or France , Mondale said , &quot; No thanks , I ' ll pay_for my own vacations. &quot; He was later posted with satisfaction as ambassador to Japan . The initiative and momentum in the Clinton_Administration is all focused_on Asia . The convening of Asia ' s heads_of_state for the first time at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting last year is still the only major foreign-policy initiative that belongs entirely to Clinton . No government has taken a tougher stance on the Japanese trade surplus than this Administration . Clinton has called his decision on China ' s most-favored-nation status &quot; of historic importance. &quot; He has spent much more time agonizing over whether coddling the geriatric mandarins of Beijing for a while longer will buy enough open-market space to finally do them in than he has thought_about the alternative to Boris Yeltsin in Russia or Saddam Hussein in Iraq . Clinton ' s proclivity toward Asian concerns makes_sense for America ; indeed it is the aspect of his foreign_policy that is most cogent because it is most linked to the reconstruction of the American economy , which is what he was elected to do . It is clear that Asia , with its rapid_growth rates and rising middle_class , will be the world ' s economic locomotive in the 21st Century . Issues from caning to the unfair practices of communitarian capitalism in Asia will present plenty of grist for conflict across the Pacific in the coming years . Indeed , one can argue that , unlike the Atlantic_Ocean , the Pacific is a vast epistemological gulf between civilizations . The world simply does not look the same from the east coast of the Pacific as it does from the west . We may squabble with the_French over movie revenues , but neither side questions the Declaration of the Rights of Man . While the Lone Ranger is the mythic emblem on this side of the Pacific , the Japanese motto is &quot; hammer down all nails &quot; so that individualism does not disrupt the harmony of a productive community . Even greater conflict looms . The Japanese , for example , harbor a suspicion of organ transplants enabled by the scientific definition of &quot; brain death. &quot; According to Shinto religious tradition , the traces of which still shape the average person ' s beliefs , the spirit exists not only in the mind , but in matter and the body as well . The Japanese assumption that follows from this , &quot; I am , therefore I think , &quot; could not be further from the Cartesian notion upon which &quot; brain_death &quot; ( and the Western world_view ) is predicated -- &quot; I think , therefore I am. &quot; Civilizational clashes don ' t get much deeper than that . All this will concentrate the strategic mind wonderfully and provide a foil for America to define its leadership role at the millennium as the last Western superpower . America ' s security role in Europe will become even fuzzier after the 50th anniversary of D-day , which has been so hyped that when it is all_over a sense of closure will set_in . After all , the security problem in Europe has become one that the Europeans themselves can handle , especially given the simultaneous collapse of the Soviet_Union and the sustained progress that Europe has made toward unity . By contrast , the extraordinarily impressive economic progress in East Asia , as Zbigniew Brzezinski has often pointed_out , coincides with a persistent security vacuum . China , Japan , Russia and maybe even a unified Korea will emerge in the coming years as contenders for regional power . Only the United States can still provide the kind of distanced stabilizing role there that it usefully provided in Europe until the fall of the Berlin Wall . America ' s critical role is to help the Asian giant arise in a way that doesn ' t threaten the liberal world order . The slumbering giant awakening in Asia today is not the peasant mass that took China down the communist path half a century ago and sapped the American spirit in the humid reaches of the Mekong Delta ; it is the rising middle_class that will consume and compete in the same world marketplace where Americans have set_up shop .</TEXT>
