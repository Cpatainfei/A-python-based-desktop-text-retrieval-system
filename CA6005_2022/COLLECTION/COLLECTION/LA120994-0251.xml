   <HEADLINE> COUNTY TO FIGHT SALE OF $ 9 BILLION IN COLLATERAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County plotted a legal fight Thursday against Wall_Street firms that have unloaded nearly $ 9 billion in bonds being held as collateral for loans to the county , as officials named a former state_treasurer to advise the county on navigating its financial crisis . News of the bond selloff touched_off a new round of fears that the county ' s financial situation was more dire than suspected , and that losses in its investment pool -- which the county already has said was down $ 1.5 billion -- may have deepened . If the securities sales are upheld in federal_court , the impact could be devastating to the more_than 180 cities , school districts and other agencies that have invested about $ 7.5 billion in the pool . &quot; We are seeing a lot of hysteria on Wall_Street , &quot; said county Supervisor William G . Steiner . &quot; We ' re taking actions to address that. &quot; Indeed , after several days of seeming paralysis over the financial crisis that forced the county into Bankruptcy Court this week , local_government leaders went_on the offensive Thursday . The county : * Authorized its counsel to file a federal lawsuit against several brokerage_firms that this week sold securities they held as collateral for loans to the county -- many of which were dumped on the financial markets Thursday . No suit was filed , however . * Named former state_Treasurer Thomas W . Hayes as the county ' s financial adviser . Hayes served as Gov . Pete Wilson ' s finance director for two years . * Imposed a hiring and salary freeze on county workers and at least temporarily stopped paying county vendors . Many of those who are not being paid were furious over the latest developments . &quot; If you are expecting a payment , checks are not being released today , &quot; county workers recited to vendors from a prepared script . * Set_up a separate , low-risk fund for all_the property_tax money that landowners must pay by Monday . Those billions of dollars are expected to keep the county and its investors afloat . * Sent Chief Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider to calm fears at a closed-door meeting of city_managers and finance directors from across the county . Schneider was unable to say whether cities will get their money from the county ' s investment pool , which has plunged at least 20 % in value since January . &quot; I told them it was too early to make a decision , &quot; Schneider said after the meeting , walking quickly toward his car . &quot; We will involve them in the decision-making process . We are all_in this together. &quot; Meanwhile , The Times learned that the county ' s auditor warned top officials last year that then-Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron was making &quot; risky and unusual transactions &quot; in violation of safeguards designed to keep his investments safe . As the county sought to halt the financial spiral , the governor made his first significant public comments about Orange County ' s bankruptcy . In Sacramento , Wilson said he is sympathetic to Orange County -- but does not expect the state to provide any monetary relief . &quot; The state is eager to be helpful , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; But we are not in a position where we can bail_out bad judgments. &quot; Without state help , county officials turned_to Washington , D.C. , on Thursday , asking U.S. transportation authorities to advance some of next year ' s federal highway funds for use right away . In Santa Ana , attorneys filed class-action lawsuits Thursday on behalf of bondholders , alleging that the county falsely represented its investment strategies . Named as defendants were Citron , other county officials and Merrill Lynch , which holds $ 2 billion of the county ' s securities as collateral for loans that allowed Citron to boost his ill-considered bets in the financial markets . The state_Department of Corporations announced that it will investigate the relationship between Merrill Lynch and the county treasurer ' s office and review the events leading_up to the county ' s bankruptcy filing for possible violations of state law . The Securities and Exchange Commission , which first visited the county treasurer ' s office in February to examine the portfolio , is trying to determine whether there were possible misrepresentations connected with the investment fund , according to sources familiar_with the SEC inquiry . The Orange County district_attorney ' s office is also reviewing the situation . Meanwhile , Orange County Superior_Court Judge Michael Brenner , who advises the county grand_jury , said that the panel contacted him this week , after the bankruptcy was filed , to &quot; explore their options &quot; in a possible investigation of the county ' s financial trouble . On Thursday , school district superintendents and finance officials met in secret to plot strategy for the first time since the financial crisis began and were briefed by legal_experts on bankruptcy and bonds . The meeting was just one of a stream of closed-door sessions held this week by the host of government officials who have been grappling with the nation ' s largest municipal financial disaster . Officials have said they are exempt from the state ' s open government meetings law because the sessions are held to discuss pending litigation . But one attorney erupted at the County Board of Supervisors ' now-daily session , chiding members for conducting business behind closed doors and urging all five to resign immediately . &quot; Sooner or later , you ' re going to have to come_out here and face the people and admit your lack of leadership in this matter , &quot; said Stephen Johnson , 48 , as the board convened early Thursday only to immediately adjourn to another closed_session . &quot; You can ' t keep going_back in that room and hiding. &quot; Supervisors had spent the day wrestling with the swift succession of brokerages that followed the lead of CS First Boston , which Tuesday sold into the market $ 2.6 billion in U.S._government agency bonds it held as collateral for loans to the county fund . The sale followed the county ' s failure to make $ 1.2 billion in loan payments that had come due . Together , seven Wall_Street firms this week have liquidated nearly $ 9 billion of the $ 12.5 billion in bonds the county had purchased on credit , hoping to boost its interest income . The sales of collateral came_after the county failed to make payments due on its loans . With each collateral sale , the brokerages are believed to have covered their loans -- but in the process they may have eaten deeply into the $ 7.5 billion that government_agencies invested in the Orange County pool . That is because the bonds originally pledged as collateral on the loans have tumbled in value this year , meaning that the brokerages needed to sell more of them to cover their loans . County officials who last week said the pool ' s value had declined $ 1.5 billion since Jan . 1 refused Thursday to put a value on the fund . First Boston ' s action prompted the county to seek federal and state bailouts before reluctantly settling Tuesday on filing for protection under Chapter 9 of the federal Bankruptcy Code . Such a filing is so rare that fewer than 10 cities , villages or counties sought such protection between 1980 and 1990 . The county also defaulted Thursday on a $ 110-million pension_fund bond that came due . The bonds were sold by First Boston in September and included a special provision that allowed investors to demand their money back with only seven days notice . That demand came last Thursday , when the first signs of Orange County ' s impending financial failure were announced . County spokeswoman Sandra Sternberg said the effect of the default_on county pension_funds was unclear . The collateral sales will provide a crucible for testing how Chapter 9 works . Lawyers for the county and the Wall_Street firms staked out contradictory positions on whether the brokerage_houses were allowed to sell the securities they were holding as collateral on Orange County ' s loans . The brokerages declined to discuss their legal positions beyond saying that they believe they are within their rights in selling the collateral . Bruce Bennett , the county ' s $ 375-an-hour bankruptcy attorney , also would not provide specifics , saying only that he believes many of the county ' s investments are sheltered under Chapter 9 ' s provisions for an automatic stay of such sales . Hugh Ray , chairman of the American Bar Assn. ' s business bankruptcy committee , said Chapter 9 lacks a specific exemption from the stay for complex transactions -- known as reverse repurchase agreements -- which were prevalent in the county portfolio . But he said that may be an oversight , and that such transactions probably are allowed under Chapter 9 . In the municipal_bond market , Wall_Street traders said the prices of Orange County bonds improved sharply Thursday from Wednesday , when a_few bidders were offering 50 to 60 cents on the dollar for the bonds . Traders said bids on Orange County and related bonds were in the range of 80 to 85 cents on the dollar , though they said few bond owners were selling at those prices . Meanwhile , some traders said San Diego County bonds dove in price Thursday as worries mounted about the health of that county ' s investment fund . Overall , California municipal_bond fund share prices , reflecting portfolios that include all types of California bonds , fell_for a second day Thursday , but by minor amounts compared to Wednesday ' s sharp losses . The elements of the county ' s repair plan were announced throughout the day Thursday . Hayes , the former state_treasurer , would oversee the restructuring of the investment portfolio for the next 90 days . The county also said that it had dismissed New York-based Capital Market Risk Advisors and hired Salomon Bros. , a leading New York investment bank , as its new financial adviser . Hayes will report directly to the board . At the briefing , he said he was &quot; strongly urged by Gov . Wilson &quot; to take the job . &quot; We are fortunate to have a person of Tom Hayes ' reputation , and a firm of Salomon Bros. ' experience , to steer us through this current financial situation and help set the course for the county ' s return to financial stability , &quot; Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F . Riley said . Hayes said this is the worst crisis he has seen during two decades in public_service , adding that Thursday ' s actions by the Wall_Street banks to cash_in collateral would make &quot; it more difficult to maneuver. &quot; &quot; We ' re going to do the best we can with what ' s left and try to preserve as much capital as we can , &quot; he said . &quot; I would have preferred that they had not done that . But they have done that , and now it ' s a case for the courts to decide. &quot; Hayes confirmed that at least two investment banks had made collateral calls Thursday , but neither he nor any other county official would disclose how much the county fund has lost . &quot; To the degree that there is a loss , there ' s going_to be financial pain , &quot; Hayes said . The county ' s ongoing cash flow -- including payroll and disbursements to pay vendors for service -- will go_through the treasurer ' s office . Hayes said he will handle only oversight and restructuring of the portfolio . &quot; Hopefully , it is solvable inside of a year , &quot; Hayes said of the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history . By the end of his 90-day term , he added , &quot; hopefully , we ' ll have our arms around it. &quot; But that was little comfort to small vendors such_as Sandy Schroeder , who learned Thursday that the county would not be paying them anytime soon . &quot; They owe us $ 4 # 010.13 ! &quot; said Schroeder , co-owner of Datron Peripherals , a three-person company in Fountain Valley that supplies computer_accessories to John Wayne Airport and the Orange County Sheriff ' s Department . &quot; Obviously , I ' m not going_to do anymore business with them , &quot; she said . Also on Thursday , the League of United Latin_American Citizens wrote to U.S. Atty . Gen . Janet Reno , asking her to convene a federal grand_jury for a criminal investigation . &quot; We have no effective local means to analyze practices of_our_own county money-changers , &quot; said the letter , which was signed by the group ' s state director of urban affairs , Art Montez . &quot; We have been signaling our grave concern about the bent political and economic power_structure in Orange County for years. &quot; * BANKRUPTCY COVERAGE : Related Orange County stories inside .
