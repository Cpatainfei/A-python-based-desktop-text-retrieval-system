   <TEXT> Profile TOM HAYDEN * Born : Dec . 11 , 1939 , Detroit . * Residence : Santa Monica * Current position : State_Senator representing the 23rd District , which includes Santa Monica , Malibu , Pacific Palisades and parts of West Los Angeles . * Education : Bachelor ' s degree in history , University of Michigan , 1961 . * Career highlights : Founder of anti-war organization Students for a Democratic Society in the 1960s ; founder of Campaign for Economic Democracy , a political action group ; author of seven books ; elected to the California Assembly in 1982 and to the state Senate in 1992 . * Family : Married to actress Barbara Williams ; children Troy and Vanessa from previous marriage . The Record State Sen . Tom Hayden is one of the best known of California ' s lawmakers . But his fame has less to do with his legislative accomplishments than his activities as an anti-Vietnam War protester and his former marriage to actress-activist Jane Fonda . During 10 years in the seniority-dominated Assembly , most of Hayden ' s efforts were thwarted . His major contribution to California law may have been his support of 1986 ' s Proposition 65 , the anti-toxics initiative that did an end_run around the Legislature . An indication of his standing in the Assembly came during the 1992 redistricting , in which the leadership did_away_with his district . But in his two years in the smaller and more freewheeling Senate , Hayden has found his voice . As his campaign literature points_out , Hayden recently led the first successful effort in 111 years to block confirmation of a University of California regent , in a battle that centered_on Hayden ' s opposition to student fee increases . Similar efforts have denied the Wilson Administration its nominations to the Board of Prison_Terms and the Lottery Commission . Of late , Hayden has concentrated his legislative efforts on curtailing college_student fee increases and emphasizing the state ' s previous reluctance to spend billions of dollars in freeway funds on seismic safety . He also has sought to reform the state ' s political process , an issue that now forms the backbone of his campaign_for_governor . The Speech : In His Own Words Our human hopes and possibilities are being smothered by a special-interest state that has befallen Sacramento . Every night , lobbyists for special_interests are making big contributions to politicians , and on the morning after , they ask those same politicians for a vote . Last year , the lobbyists spent $ 128 million lobbying those politicians , and you paid_for it because lobbying expenses are tax-deductible . These lobbyists not only enrich their clients , they impoverish and downsize our schools , our health_care , our future and our hope . They strangle us with the heavy hand of the past when we should be listening and tending to the needs of the future . California cannot restore its strength when we are 41st in the nation in school funding . I want our school rooms to be &quot; exploratoriums , &quot; on-ramps to the information highway of the future . I propose we increase school funding over the next five years until we reach the national average . Nor should we be closing the doors of higher education , as the soaring fees of Pete Wilson have done to 200 # 000 students in just two years . I will reduce college fees by 20 % , and make_up the cost by closing wasteful tax loopholes . I will create a committed and idealistic California Service Corps , sending thousands of college_students into a teacher corps and a police corps , to reduce our school dropout rates and increase community-based policing . To pay_for these educational initiatives , we have to change our priorities . I will insist on a $ 1-billion cut_in bloated state bureaucracy and a $ 3-billion closure of totally wasteful tax loopholes . . . . We are under-funding education to pay_for a &quot; three strikes &quot; law and a prison building program that are fiscally reckless . We must amend &quot; three strikes &quot; to focus_on violent repeat offenders , not check forgers or people who are caught growing three marijuana plants . . . . Too many middle-class people , including our younger people , are trapped in McJobs , permanent part-time jobs that lack meaning and go nowhere . I propose jobs with a future , jobs that require more education instead of less , jobs of restoring the environment instead of degrading what ' s left of it . A Hayden renewal program will begin by creating 55 # 000 jobs in southern California making_clean , zero-emission cars in the coming decade . . . . California can lead the world in designing and exporting energy conservation technology . . . . We must lead in renewable resources like solar and wind energy . . . . We must lead in telecommunications , and reduce our addiction to polluting by commuting . . . . But we cannot realize this brighter future without a governor with the independence and vision to stand_up to the special_interests . . . that dominate Sacramento like undertakers in the delivery room . As a reform governor with a mandate from the people , I will insist on Day 1 that the Legislature enact these reforms : No . 1 , campaign contribution limits of no more_than $ 250 ; expenditure limits to contain the campaign arms race ; a prohibition on lobbyists soliciting money for politicians they lobby , and stiffer penalties for political corruption than the slap-on-the-wrist attitude of today . . . . This is a campaign that is also a cause . This is about the politics of hope triumphing over a future of fear . Don ' t waste your vote on the status_quo . Vote at least to send a message -- and together we may make a miracle.POLITICAL C</TEXT>
