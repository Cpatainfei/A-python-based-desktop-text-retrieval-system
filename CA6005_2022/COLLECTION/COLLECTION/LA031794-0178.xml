   <HEADLINE> SOMETHING TO DANCE ABOUT ; CHOREOGRAPHER GIVES HOPE TO KIDS WITH CANCER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A dozen children with cancer or chronic illnesses -- some bald from treatments , one whose leg has been amputated -- were tap-dancing , drawing , singing and trying_on costumes sparkling with glitter and sequins on a recent afternoon at Long_Beach Memorial Hospital . Music from &quot; Mary Poppins &quot; and &quot; The Little Mermaid &quot; blared so loudly from the stereo that it was nearly impossible for nurses to figure_out whose IV alarm was sounding . The children in the playroom of the hospital ' s pediatric oncology and hematology ward could forget for a while that their lives have been taken_over by medicines that make them sick and tubes that follow them like puppies . &quot; When they put their costumes on , they ' re no longer sick children , &quot; said choreographer Marilyn Clements , who teaches the children to dance . &quot; They ' re in a magical place. &quot; Every week , children who feel well enough can come_to the room and spend a_couple_of hours with volunteer artists and entertainers , thanks to The Discovery Arts Center Outreach Program . Clements started the program last fall at the hospital ' s Jonathan Jaques Children ' s Cancer Center . &quot; These kids are art-starved , &quot; Clements said . &quot; They ' re not_able to take lessons . Their schedules are built around their next treatment , their next doctor ' s appointment , whether or not they feel well that day. &quot; In the next few weeks , Clements plans to bring a children ' s songwriter and a vocalist to the playroom . Don Harper , music_director of Sesame Street Live , has already spent a_couple_of afternoons giving the children music_lessons . Dr. Ramesh Patel , who works in the ward , said he has seen &quot; dramatic changes &quot; in the children who participate in the arts program . &quot; When they go_to the playroom , put_on the shoes and start tap-dancing , they ' re able to forget the hospital and the chemotherapy and its side effects. &quot; Jennifer Moffett , 7 , who has kidney cancer , is one of the program ' s regulars . She zips over to the rack of costumes and chooses a glittery get-up . Jennifer ' s face is painted , her smile bright , her enthusiasm for tap-dancing obvious in the way she hops onto the pretend stage , a piece of board . Her IV stand becomes a dance partner as the Calypso beat of &quot; Under the Sea &quot; blares from the stereo . JoAnn Young , who has lost one of her legs in a battle with bone cancer , sits before a separate board and joins in , her foot furiously tapping shuffle-step , shuffle-toe-heel . It is her 14th birthday , and she is radiant in a new dress and black patent_leather shoe . Like Jennifer , she is all smiles as she dances . &quot; I like the song that comes from the shoes , &quot; JoAnn says . Clements , a Laguna Nigel resident who has been a choreographer 20 years , said she decided to start the program after doing a show at the hospital about 18 months ago . &quot; I wanted to do more , but I wasn ' t sure what I could do , &quot; she said . &quot; I went_for a month and just learned . I talked with them , sang , played music and drew . &quot; During those visits I could see the need in those children . They wanted normalcy in their lives . They wanted to express creativity . When one little_girl said she wanted to dance , I knew I could offer something. &quot; The parents , many of whom spend day and night in the ward , are grateful for Clements ' efforts . &quot; It gives the kids something to do rather than sit in a room all day and be chained to a pole , &quot; said Suzanne Moffett , Jennifer ' s mother . When Jennifer underwent major lung surgery recently , Clements came_to her room decked_out in a red sequin dress , gold lame hat and several boas . The prognosis for Jennifer ? &quot; We ' re counting_on a miracle , &quot; said Suzanne Moffett . The cancer , which first was diagnosed when Jennifer was 3 , has spread to her lungs . Clements said more children are participating now , and more people in the industry say they want to donate their time . &quot; Musicians , artists , actors , puppeteers -- they don ' t want to just perform , they want to interact , &quot; she said . Discovery Arts , funded entirely through donations , seems to be growing in reputation also . Recent publicity brought donations of shoes and costumes from as far away as Las Vegas and San Jose . But the program could use more , Clements said . The program needs a cabinet to store costumes and shoes , as well as a video camera to tape performances . Clements hopes one day to have enough money from donations to buy art supplies and small electronic pianos for bedridden patients who want to practice .</TEXT>
