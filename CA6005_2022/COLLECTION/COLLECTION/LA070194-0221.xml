   <HEADLINE> EXPLOSION OF AIDS CASES IN ASIA ALARMS U.N. HEALTH AGENCY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The estimated number of full-blown AIDS cases worldwide increased from 2.5 million to 4 million in the last 12 months -- a rise of 60 % , the World_Health_Organization said today . Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest number of cases with 2.5 million , the U.N. health agency said . But Asia experienced an eight-fold increase of cases , from more_than 30 # 000 to 250 # 000 , it added . &quot; The global AIDS epidemic is now spreading in Asia faster than anywhere else in the world , &quot; Dr. Michael Merson , head of WHO ' s Global Program on AIDS , said in a statement . Merson is attending an AIDS conference in Tokyo . A copy of his statement was released in_advance in Geneva . The WHO report said 16 million adults and 1 million children had been infected with the human_immunodeficiency_virus , or HIV , which causes AIDS , since the epidemic first took_hold in the early 1980s . WHO estimates that by the end of the century , between 30 million and 40 million people will have been infected with the virus . All the statistics are cumulative totals since records were kept , dating to the early 1980s , so the HIV figures include people who have gone_on to develop full-blown AIDS and those who have died . It takes_on average 10 years between infection with HIV and the onset of AIDS symptoms . The virus can be passed_on through unprotected sex , contaminated blood , shared syringes and from mother to child . Although the United States accounts_for about 42 % of the reported AIDS cases , it represents 10 % of the overall estimated total . By contrast , Africa accounts_for 33.5 % of the reported cases but more_than 67 % of the estimated total , according to WHO figures . Even though Africa now bears the heaviest toll , WHO is most concerned about the explosion in infections in more-populous Asia . It said that in Thailand , HIV infection had spread from prostitutes and drug_addicts into the general population . The study said about 30 % of intravenous drug_users in Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam , were infected by late 1993 , up from 2 % in late 1992 . In the northeast Indian town of Manipur , in the Thai capital of Bangkok and the Myanmar capital of Yangon , about 50 % of drug_addicts were infected , it said . Merson said WHO was also concerned about China because of the increasing rate of sexually transmitted diseases in many parts of the country . China , with its population of 1.2 billion people , has reported only 35 AIDS cases to WHO , but a high rate of sexually transmitted diseases , such_as gonorrhea , is often a sign of the AIDS virus .</TEXT>
