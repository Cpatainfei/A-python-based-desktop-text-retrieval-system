   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : THE CUTTING_EDGE : SPECIAL REPORT ; TAX PROPOSAL SEEKS TO MEET THE FUTURE BY DEGREES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The information age came_to tax_policy Thursday night , as President Clinton called_for tax-deductible tuition for college , vocational and graduate_school and for grants to individual Americans to help them retrain and cope_with constantly changing job markets . The proposal was generous -- up_to $ 10 # 000 tax-deductible tuition and $ 2 # 000 tax-deferred individual_retirement_accounts that could be used to pay_for education , among other items . Whether it can be squared with budget limitations or a Republican Congress remains a question for next year . But the emphasis on schooling was significant . Clinton was responding to the fears of many Americans , including those of Labor_Secretary Robert Reich , that the coming of &quot; information industry &quot; will divide workers between the high-tech plutocrats and low-skill proletarians . Reich voiced such fears in a recent speech : &quot; We are_on the way to becoming a two-tiered society composed of a_few winners and a larger group left_behind , &quot; he told a Democratic_party group . One reason , he said , was &quot; technology -- largely computer based -- which has either eradicated or devalued every routine job which can be done_by a software program and simultaneously enriched every job utilizing the problem-solving skills of human brains. &quot; The rhetoric , voiced soon after the Democrats ' mid-term election defeats , was a bit emotional and misguided . Software programs have created and enriched more jobs for clerical workers than for executives -- including many of the 5 million new jobs opened in the last two years . In fact , perhaps 60 % of all 120 million U.S. workers today are in an information industry , says Robert Kling , a professor of computer_science at UC Irvine . that ' s another way of saying that crops are planted , cars are built , bank_deposits accepted , movies made and tickets dispensed_with computerized machinery . And the people doing that computerized work range from messengers and office helpers to architects and neurosurgeons . The U.S. work_force , more_than any other , has become adept at using computer_technology . Yet Clinton and Reich are correct in addressing fears and prescribing education -- or more inclusively life-long learning -- as the antidote for those fears . Because the prospects for technological change are sobering . The cutting edge today among computer_experts is electronic commerce , or the prospect of vastly expanded business on the Internet . The Internet is a federation of 3.2 million computers in 48 # 000 networks around the world . It was developed by the Pentagon and U.S. universities in the 1970s as a communications network without a center ( which could have been vulnerable to attack ) and theoretically without limits , like the universe itself . The Internet long ago outgrew government uses and now is expected to link 100 million computers in millions of local networks within the next five years . It is becoming literally a global marketplace in which companies are displaying entire product_lines for industrial customers who may log_on from anywhere . Cost of display is extremely low -- General Electric put 1 # 500 pages of its plastics division ' s specifications on the Net . And the costs of transacting business can be cut more_than 50 % just because a lot of middlemen are eliminated . Such a powerful cost-reduction tool is at least as significant as the Interstate Highway_System begun in the 1950s , which has changed the face of America . The impact of change on such a scale is unpredictable . The interstate system hurt small_towns it bypassed , but it greatly expanded the U.S. economy . And , important for individuals coping_with change , the interstate highway_system developed gradually , and so will the electronic highway -- on which commercial traffic is still surprisingly light . Forrester Research , a San Francisco firm , estimates that commerce on the Internet will grow to $ 5 billion by 1998 . that ' s less business than will be done_in America ' s shopping_malls this weekend . So in thinking_about technology , don ' t be frightened by big words . Just look_at what information industry really is . Federal Express , the package courier , started_out by giving customers small computer terminals for tracking packages -- the ones it features in TV ads . Now FedEx is giving customers diskettes they can use with any computer . And on the diskette along with package tracking are individual customer lists and capabilities for printing waybills and shipping labels . FedEx is using information to help its customers ' business and so boost its own , creating jobs both at_home and overseas . But the computer ' s effect on jobs is clearer_up close . Barbara Parkman of Milwaukee is starting a business on_her_own , searching the Internet for clients too busy to sit for hours trying to isolate useful items from oceans of information -- GE ' s 1 # 500 pages , for example . Parkman ' s &quot; job &quot; is electronic librarian . Yet more important than her computer skills for that business is the basic education she received at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee , which trained her ability to analyze information and make discriminating choices . And note , she didn ' t have to take a degree in library_science or cope_with a big company ' s employment practices . She ' s in business for herself . The world to come , in which information will be inexpensively available to all , inevitably will be more democratic . Which brings us back to Clinton ' s proposed deductions for education : Will they really spur people to develop their knowledge and productivity ? &quot; Or will they become yet another entitlement ? &quot; asks Michael Duffy , who teaches tax_policy at USC ' s graduate Business_School . Clinton ' s proposals were greeted with immediate criticism : that tax_breaks for schooling and families reach only a &quot; minority &quot; of the population today , although deductions and grants for education apparently would be available to everybody . The subject is worthy of debate . And Clinton himself referred to his model in the post-World War II GI Bill of Rights , which also reached a small minority but had a profound effect on the nation and its economy . The GI Bill , between 1944 and ' 54 , gave higher education to many who never would have had it , and therefore helped in the expansion of U.S. universities , which became a foundation for U.S. discoveries in computing and the growth of its advanced industries . This seems a more fearful and myopic time . But if Congress could re-create a GI Bill , we might see again that the economic benefits a country reaps from cultivating the minds of its citizens are unpredictable , but also unlimited -- like the universe , or the Internet .</TEXT>
