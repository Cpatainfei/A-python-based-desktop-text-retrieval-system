   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; TECHNO-EDUCATION ; AREA SCHOOLS ARE SEEKING TO EXPAND COMPUTER-ASSISTED INSTRUCTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the first day of school , a bilingual robot greets second-graders in teacher Audrey Swartz ' s class , handing_out stickers to &quot; good listeners &quot; and pointing_out maps and puppets in the classroom . &quot; Hello boys and girls . Buenos dias . Welcome to Room 15 , &quot; says the 2-foot-tall robot , called Robie , its mouth blinking and eyes glowing like headlights . Swartz used the robot to introduce her sneakered charges to the world of educational technology . Within a_few weeks , her class at Linwood E . Howe School in Culver City will be programming the robot , creating multimedia reports on a personal_computer , and studying the human_body and nature by scanning bar_codes into a laser disc player . &quot; I ' m trying to be_on the cutting edge , &quot; said Swartz , 49 . &quot; I know that the kids are fascinated by it. &quot; In Culver City and numerous other schools on the Westside , technology is taking_root in classrooms , from kindergarten to 12th grade . A move to equip schools with computers stalled in the late 1980s and early 1990s because of funding shortages , red_tape and scarcity of teacher training . Today , many schools have developed creative ways to purchase technology and use it to benefit education . It ' s an uneven picture to be sure . Some schools have barely moved beyond Apple II labs , but others are installing high-speed data transmission cables to link classrooms and access the Internet , the worldwide information network . But educators agree that an important new phase of the technological arms race has begun in_earnest . With high-tech skills now critically important in the job market , they say , computer_technology -- once considered a luxury -- is viewed_as a dire necessity . And educators increasingly value computers as a new way to reach students . &quot; This is their future , &quot; said Lynne Culp , an English_teacher at University High_School who is taking_part in a pilot_project to connect schools to the Internet . &quot; Technology can be a route to stimulating learning. &quot; Not long ago , computers were considered exotic in schools . A computer lab usually was reserved for the use of a_few gifted mathematics students -- the &quot; nerds. &quot; In the mid-1980s , more schools created bigger labs , mostly with a_few first-generation Apple computers . The late 1980s brought the advent of on-line computer services and interactive CD-ROM software that features graphics , photographs and video footage , and the appeal of technology rapidly grew . By then , however , most local schools were confronting budget problems . Many gave_up on expanding computer_technology programs in the late 1980s and early 1990s , while others struggled to maintain what they had . Today , California ranks between 44th and 48th in the nation in average student-to-computer ratio , about 20 to 1 , according to the state_Department of Education . Despite that ranking , however , there are signs that Westside schools are once again making technology a priority . This time , they ' re doing_it far more deliberately . In many cases , districts are putting far greater emphasis on planning , teacher training and raising money through parent booster clubs , local businesses and special grants . All the Westside ' s school districts -- Santa Monica-Malibu Unified , Beverly Hills Unified , Culver City Unified and Los Angeles Unified -- have either recently completed or are beginning to draft comprehensive technology plans . The Santa Monica and Beverly Hills districts have both hired technology coordinators , people who will trouble-shoot and train teachers in the use of computers . The Culver City_district sets_aside more_than $ 100 # 000 a year to buy technology , such_as multimedia carts , featuring an overhead_projector , liquid_crystal_display panels , Macintosh computers , CD-ROM_drives and speakers , for every school . Ultimately , every classroom will have its own cart . The district is currently equipping each classroom with cable_television and telephone_lines for voice and modem communications . Santa Monica , meanwhile , boasts the Westside ' s most technologically advanced high_school library , with several CD-ROM databases , an on-line periodical service and a computerized card_catalogue . One of its elementary_schools , Rogers , plans to link all its classroom computers by November so that students can collaborate on projects and communicate through electronic_mail . The district also has begun equipping all classrooms with ethernet data transmission_lines , which transmit information faster than regular telephone_lines but not as fast as fiber-optic lines . Next year , Santa Monica High_School plans to open a career technology lab that will include computer-aided_design equipment , a computer-controlled lathe and an experimental wind_tunnel . Some districts are just turning the corner . Beverly Hills , for instance , hasn ' t moved far beyond the late 1980s technologically . It has labs at all its schools , but new technology is sparse . The district also has an antiquated high_school library where students still thumb through a card_catalogue . Beverly Hills does , however , have plans to make technology a priority again , with hopes of wiring schools for faster data transmission over the next two years through use of a recently approved bond measure . * The picture is wildly uneven in the Los Angeles Unified School District , with some schools on the cutting edge technologically and others far behind . LAUSD clearly lags behind other Westside districts in plans for installation of data transmission cables . District officials say it will be up_to each school to arrange for data transmission hookups , and there ' s no funding yet for internal classroom wiring , which district officials estimate will cost $ 100 million district-wide . As much as it is financially feasible , the goal in most districts is to move away from the computer lab approach of the 1980s and toward the goal of a multimedia classroom -- something like Swartz ' s class in Culver City . &quot; Playing with a computer should be as natural an act for any child in the United States as using a toothbrush , &quot; said Tina Harris-Rouquette , an instructor at Edison Elementary School in Santa Monica . Such classrooms are scattered throughout the Westside . Swartz ' s is one example . Although she only has two computers in the classroom , she makes_sure that all_the students get scheduled periods at the keyboard . Often they work in pairs , using software that she has tailored to go_with each lesson . She links a liquid_crystal_display panel to an overhead_projector so students can compose a class newspaper as a group . As Swartz taps computer keys , the students bark out instructions on everything from layout to content . Other schools are taking their first_steps in this direction . Harris-Rouquette , for example , wants to introduce more students to technology in her school by creating a schoolwide bilingual newsletter at Edison , which is in Santa Monica ' s poorest and most ethnically diverse neighborhood . In her program , she hopes to have gifted students work with students who struggle with basic reading and writing . She wants Spanish-speaking parents to brainstorm for newsletter topics and study English through the computer . Using an $ 11 # 500 state technology grant and a district computer literacy grant , the school will get new computers with desktop_publishing capabilities , and computers will go_into every fourth- and fifth-grade classroom . &quot; What the technology brings for us is the opportunity for growth that is multiplied a million-fold , &quot; Harris-Rouquette said . Technology is also being used to reach some students who thus far have not been motivated to do schoolwork . Across town , at Olympic Continuation High_School , English_teacher Jack Casey has literally surrounded students with more_than 20 computers . During four periods each day , about 90 youths , classified as at-risk by school officials , pass_through his laboratory . In many cases , the technology has interested these students in schoolwork for the first time . When the students are not reading , they work_on the computers -- practicing keyboard exercises , keeping personal journals , writing essays , connecting with the city ' s electronic_bulletin_board or looking_up facts on a CD-ROM encyclopedia . One recent morning , Sean Syphers , a restless 18-year-old who has had trouble concentrating_on schoolwork , drew a perfect likeness of the cartoon character Yosemite Sam on a computer . Another student listened to a Beethoven string_quartet through headphones . Casey says the computer has freed these students from years of frustration with penmanship and essay revision . The students write essays about their lives , and Casey displays these often emotionally wrenching pieces on a bulletin_board in the hallway . Principal Ben Villa said he still gets chills when he recalls the essay written by a girl who witnessed the stillbirth of her godchild . &quot; One of the absolute joys in my life is to see the excitement in their eyes when they hit the ' print ' button . . . . They can ' t believe that they ' ve done all this , &quot; Casey said . In Beverly Hills , sixth-graders at Hawthorne School use a special computer-friendly camera and a Macintosh to construct family_trees . They incorporate photographs of their family members into the charts along with short descriptions of each person . In Malibu , Joe DiMercurio , the librarian at Malibu High_School , hopes that as his school goes on-line in the next year with the new ethernet classroom-to-classroom wiring , students can collaborate with peers from other schools , states and countries on science and social studies projects . In the Hollywood area , students at Santa Monica Elementary School watch science and language_lessons that are beamed into a satellite dish and taped for classroom use . And in Pacific Palisades , Ryan Hill , a severely disabled 13-year-old with cerebral_palsy , has single-handedly introduced countless teachers and peers to computer_technology during his lifetime . Limited to the use of only one finger , he is able to &quot; speak &quot; and do class work only by tapping the keys of a talking computer attached_to his wheelchair . His mother , Diane , illustrates how parents have become crucial in raising money for school computer projects . In 10 years , she has written_about 30 grants , winning about $ 60 # 000 for her son ' s schools . &quot; The only way we knew anything was going_on was through the computer . There was a lot of person in there , &quot; she said . * For all_the success stories , there are plenty of examples of stalled progress . Cost is a big factor . Hardware and software expenses are high enough , but schools also must contend with the costs of teacher training and technical support . Stories abound of state-of-the-art labs that gather dust for a year or two because no one knows how to use them . Another problem is bureaucracy . Teacher Lynne Culp spent a_couple_of years on a fellowship learning about the wonders of the Internet . When she returned to University High last year , she says , she learned that Los Angeles Unified would charge her school $ 650 to have a technician install a phone_line so the school could hook_up to the network . A private telephone_company would do the same job for about $ 50 , she protested . District officials say they ' re forming a focus group to study the $ 650 figure , which they say also covers future charges for telephone_service . Then there is the problem of &quot; techno-phobia &quot; among teachers , many of whom are reluctant to use a tool that their students understand better than they do . And training isn ' t easy . It ' s particularly difficult in Los Angeles Unified , where many teachers are frustrated by salary cuts , strike threats and overcrowded classrooms . &quot; We have a lot of people who feel_like , ' Don ' t bother me with this stuff , ' &quot; said Beverly Taylor , librarian at Hollywood High_School . Generally , large districts appear to have a harder_time gearing_up technologically than do smaller ones . Los Angeles Unified has so far been unable to spread computer_technology uniformly across its estimated 600 schools . The district ' s instructional technology office is small , with five specialists who tend to the demands of all_the schools . Each specialist usually has a waiting list of five or six schools seeking assistance with technology . Maintenance requests take at least a week to handle . Teacher training occurs at training centers that teachers attend on_their_own time . Last year , only 1 # 100 teachers out of 30 # 000 received technology training . &quot; It ' s a drop_in the bucket , &quot; said Vic Placeres , director of the school information_systems branch . The result is that , in Los Angeles Unified , schools are very much on_their_own as they try to enter the technological age . On the Westside , Los Angeles Unified ' s student-to-computer ratio in 1993 ranged from an outstanding 2-to-1 ratio at the Open School , a magnet elementary_school in West Los Angeles that has been adopted by one of Apple ' s top_executives , to a dismal 83-to-1 ratio at Selma Elementary in Hollywood . Selma had suffered numerous break-ins and thefts over the years . Lucky for Selma , the school was completely rebuilt recently and equipped with a burglar_alarm system . And Principal Doris Dent is using some of the reconstruction money to buy new computers . She also plans to apply to the state for technology grants . &quot; With our class sizes , it ' s important to have things that kids can look_forward to , &quot; Dent said . Playa del Rey Elementary , a school with a 67 to 1 student-to-computer ratio , hasn ' t been so fortunate . Principal Sharon Langman says the school booster club in her working-class neighborhood cannot raise much money . Her students don ' t qualify for federal funding for the poor and disadvantaged because income levels aren ' t low enough . Such funding would enable them to purchase computers . And there hasn ' t been anyone on staff who has the expertise to write an application for a technology grant . &quot; I ' m afraid that things are changing so fast that we won ' t be able to keep_up with it , &quot; Langman said . &quot; If our children are to compete in the 21st Century , they need to have the latest technology. &quot; One of Los Angeles Unified ' s bright spots is the Pacific Palisades complex of schools , where teachers and parents have been invigorated by winning charter school status , a step that gives the schools more autonomy in budgeting and decision-making , said Christine Maxwell , a longtime technology teacher . Like many Los Angeles Unified schools , Pacific Palisades has its share of antique Apples , but it also has a high-tech library with everything from a CD-ROM encyclopedia to an on-line atlas . In Pacific Palisades , as in other Westside communities with successful computer_programs , officials say the key in recent years has been consistent support from the schools , the parents , business people and others . That backing , says Culver City Unified ' s Audrey Swartz , has been good news for her students . &quot; We live_in the age of technology and that seems to be the way we learn , &quot; Swartz said . &quot; It seems like they will definitely be prepared for the future. &quot;</TEXT>
