   <HEADLINE> ANALYSIS ; EXPECT FAVORITES IN SEMIFINALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After encountering the brutal , stifling heat of Dallas and Orlando , Germany and Belgium opened the second round of the World Cup in Chicago in welcome weather . It was like a typical summer ' s day in Northern_Europe . It was chilly . It was windy . It was rainy . And both teams played well in one of the two best games of the round of 16 . Franz Beckenbauer , the great German player and coach , remarked in 1990 that the World Cup did not begin until the second round . It was true also in 1994 , even though this year , due at least in part to FIFA ' s rules and procedure changes designed to step_up the pace , the first-round games were more interesting than four years ago and the goals-per-game average was about one-third of a goal higher . &quot; Depend upon it , sir , &quot; wrote Dr. Samuel Johnson , &quot; when a man knows he is to be hanged_in a fortnight , it concentrates his mind wonderfully. &quot; And when the World Cup has moved to the single-elimination stage , the certain knowledge that minutes from now it ' s either you or the other guys can produce some terrific concentration and splendid games between well-matched teams . Beckenbauer before the Germany-Belgium game , put the Johnson aphorism into soccer language : &quot; Everything henceforth depends_on speed , power and concentration. &quot; He thought that if Germany fulfilled its potential , it would go_through to the final , that of its possible rivals on the way there , Italy had_the_best material and that the new football powers like Saudi_Arabia would fall by the wayside . Germany and Belgium surely fulfilled that prediction . Germany was the stronger and faster , but Belgium played courageously and tenaciously . Its spectacular goalkeeper , Michel Preud ' homme , saved Belgium from several German goals . Belgium could have used the obvious penalty kick the referee neglected to award , but the truth was that the Germans , for the first time in the Cup , played with tremendous power , led by forward Juergen Klinsmann and 34-year-old striker Rudi Voeller , called_back from retirement , and nearly every attack threatened a goal . A German team playing like the one that beat Belgium , 3-2 , is likely to reach the final . The other splendid game of the second round , a great game in any World Cup , was Romania ' s 3-2 dispatch of Argentina in a moderately hot and quite smoggy Rose Bowl . These teams are each capable of arousing extraordinary cynicism . But on this occasion , what you are bound to remember for many years was their commitment and verve : Romania ' s creative fast breaks , propelled by a brilliant Gheorghe Hagi , and Argentina ' s marvelous passing_game . The rapid , end-to-end sweeps as Argentina attacked and Romania counterattacked produced a match that only a churl could have asked to be more exciting . Spain swamped the_Swiss in a fast , rough game in which Spain ordered 18 fouls to 12 shots at the goal against a Swiss side that lacked the power to keep pace . Sweden , playing very methodically , beat Saudi_Arabia , 3-1 . The Saudis were charming to watch but they still lack the experience to break_into scoring at this level of competition . It was a tribute to their skill and courage that they got this far . Ireland , losing to the_Netherlands , 2-0 , played with verve and toughness . But important as defense is , no team can win consistently if it scores only two goals in four games . The Dutch , at 3-1 , are looking strong . They seemed confident and determined . They have scored six goals and given_up only three , but they lack the fluidity and imagination of the great Dutch teams of the ' 70s . When they face Brazil in the heat in Dallas , it will be power against panache . The real question is whether the Brazilians are suffering from the Brazilian disease of subordinating goal scoring to technical brilliance . Their footwork is elegant but they have trouble finishing . Except for their 3-0 defeat of a squabbling Cameroon in the first round , they have scored no more_than one goal from the field in any game . ( Their second goal against Russia was_on a penalty kick. ) It was much to the credit of the United States that it held Brazil scoreless in the first_half and allowed only one goal in the second in the classic American_football stadium at Stanford_University under the clear blue_sky and crisp air of Northern California . The United States , not having yet developed an identifiable soccer culture , confused the seasoned Brazilian team with its recklessly aggressive defense . But if Brazil does not develop a better finishing touch it will not prevail through the final week . Poor Mexico ! After slogging it out with Bulgaria to a 1-1 tie , it lost , 3-1 , after overtime on a humiliating run of failed penalty kicks . Theirs was by far the more skilled side , but the defensive tactic it adopted seemed not to fit with its national style . It seems strange to us that Mexico waited for the penalty kicks and made no serious attempt to decide the game in its favor during overtime . A measure of this resignation was that Mexico didn ' t make any substitutions in overtime , despite the obvious exhaustion of some of its players . This Cup ' s enigma has been Italy . It is a stereotyping cliche to call its sudden resuscitation and end-of-game 2-1 victory over Nigeria operatic , but it would be an accurate description of the team . The renowned Roberto Baggio , who had done little for three games and most of the fourth , sprang to life in the 89th minute to tie Nigeria with a clever shot , then set the stage for a penalty kick_in the 102nd minute by lobbing the ball_over the head of a defender who committed a foul in a desperate effort to recover . Nigeria at its best played beautiful , muscular soccer . But in the game against Italy , it let itself be drawn into a European-style tactical game , for which it lacks the experience and perhaps the conviction . Italy played much of the game with one man out . So did Brazil . If that is the way to win , perhaps FIFA , instead of awarding a penalty kick to a team , should reward it by taking a man off the field . In the quarterfinals , Brazil will have trouble against the Dutch today in Dallas unless it can develop more power in its attacks . Italy ' s problem is psychological . No team has technically more accomplished players . It is not clear whether its coach can make them play together . If Italy -- and Baggio -- can mesh their great abilities today , it should take Spain in a close game . As for the other quarterfinals , in the Romania-Sweden game Sunday , everything depends_on which Romanian team shows_up . If it plays as brilliantly and purposefully as it did against Argentina , Romania is likely to beat Sweden . But if it performs as poorly as it did_in the first round against Switzerland , it will return to Romania . Bulgaria has some first-class players . But Germany seems too strong . Our prediction for the semifinals is Germany-Italy and Brazil-Romania . But we could easily be surprised .</TEXT>
