   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187 ; VALLEY BUSINESS GROUPS BACK MEASURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After an emotionally charged debate that continued for months , representatives of the San Fernando Valley ' s 21 chambers_of_commerce voted this week to support Proposition 187 -- the controversial state initiative seeking to restrict health and education benefits for illegal immigrants . The chamber members , representing more_than 8 # 500 mostly small and medium-size Valley businesses , had been split over support of the measure because they disagreed whether Proposition 187 would do what proponents say it will . Chamber representatives said they agreed that illegal immigration has become a costly local problem that is being ignored by government decision-makers . But they differed on how to approach the problem . &quot; People are saying , ' I don ' t like this Third_World takeover , ' &quot; said Guy Weddington McCreary , a North Hollywood Chamber_of_Commerce member favoring the initiative . &quot; It is literally an invasion and very upsetting. &quot; But others countered that the Valley ' s lingering economic troubles , as well as demographic and other social changes , are not likely to be reversed with the passage of Proposition 187 . They cite additional costs and responsibilities the measure would create . Besides restricting government services , it would also require local school and medical authorities to report suspected illegal immigrants . &quot; We didn ' t feel that requiring medical and educational personnel to be INS cops was appropriate , &quot; said James Stewart , member of the Mid-San Fernando Valley Chamber_of_Commerce , which voted against support of Proposition 187 . &quot; We know we have an illegal immigration problem . But the solution is to do a better job at the border . This doesn ' t do anything besides create more bureaucracy. &quot; The vote Wednesday supporting the initiative by the San Fernando Valley ' s United Chambers_of_Commerce was 15 to 10 . ( Some of the larger chamber groups get more_than one vote ) . It was largely symbolic , but chamber members say the debate has been among the most emotional in recent memory . &quot; A couple of people got really hot about it and that ' s not real common , &quot; Stewart said . Chamber members said they did not believe support of the measure would cost them customers because of its broad support . In fact , Valley business owners who support the measure say it has caught_fire among longtime residents who are unhappy with growing numbers of lower-income residents , many of them Latinos , now living_in the sprawling Los Angeles suburb that was once nearly all-white and predominantly middle_class . McCreary -- who says his family moved to North Hollywood 107 years ago and was instrumental in its development -- said support for the measure is largely based on economics . He said many taxpayers fear paying increasingly larger shares of their income to support the families of illegal immigrants . But the measure is about more_than money , McCreary said . &quot; These people move_in here , they aren ' t being assimilated . . . . &quot; said McCreary , who works as a property manager . &quot; We ' ve got_to get a handle on it , or else. &quot; That kind of talk is fueling a lot of support for the measure , said Scott Macdonald , spokesman for Taxpayers Against 187 . &quot; But the 187 doesn ' t solve the problem . It does nothing at the border , &quot; he said . The Woodland Hills Chamber_of_Commerce -- the Valley ' s largest with 1 # 000 members -- agrees . They voted to oppose Proposition 187 , saying it would do little to reduce illegal immigration and , with restrictions on medical_care , could makes matter worse . Debate over support of the measure was also split , but members agreed that illegal immigration is a problem that government has been unable to fix . The Woodland Hills Chamber_of_Commerce is the largest entity within the Valley ' s united chambers . Results of a statewide Times Poll released earlier this week show that Proposition 187 is supported by virtually all groups , including Latino voters . Among all registered voters , the measure is favored 62 % to 28 % , an overwhelming margin . The Los Angeles Area Chamber_of_Commerce is scheduled to discuss support of the initiative next week .</TEXT>
