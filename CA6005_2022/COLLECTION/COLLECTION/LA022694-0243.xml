   <HEADLINE> FUEL_CELLS COMING TO LIFE ; BACKERS CALL THEM NEXT NON-POLLUTING ENERGY SOURCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The once-exotic fuel_cell may soon become a commonplace energy source in a surprising range of practical items , from batteries in video cameras and radios to smoke detectors that could last for 20 years -- even powering the family lawn_mower . They may also be put into service as a non-polluting source of electricity to run cars , buses , trucks and trains . &quot; We intend to bring fuel_cells down to earth , &quot; Henry W . Wedaa , chairman of the South Coast Air Quality Management District , said Friday at the end of a three-day conference in Long_Beach for fuel_cell marketers , researchers and environmental regulatory officials . Entrepreneurs and scientists from the United States and Canada compared notes at the conference , where Wedaa ' s goal seemed even closer than many participants had expected . On Thursday , Wedaa and Moe Sihota , British_Columbia ' s minister of the environment , proposed a North_American Clean Air Alliance to support development of low- and zero-polluting vehicles -- one of the most challenging applications of the fuel_cell . The results of ongoing research , including work by a team at Caltech ' s Jet_Propulsion Laboratory , suggest that the fuel cell-powered car is closer to reality . &quot; If they can do_it , we ' ve got_it made in the shade , &quot; said Catherine Anderson , a project engineer at AeroVironment Inc. , the Monrovia-based research firm that developed much of General Motors Corp. ' s upcoming Impact electric_car . Fuel_cells , which have intrigued scientists since the 1800s , convert fuel -- most often hydrogen -- directly to electricity without combustion . Internally , they operate something like batteries to which fuel and oxygen are constantly being added . Environmentalists long have supported fuel_cell research , because most working fuel_cells emit only benign wastes -- pure water and heat , both of which can be put to good use in a variety of ways . But several technological hurdles have kept fuel_cells on theorists ' lists of long-term , rather than short-term , energy sources . One is cost , which for most uses is significantly higher than competing systems -- except in remote locations , including in space or beneath the ocean . Liquid hydrogen is an expensive fuel , currently produced in relatively small amounts , mainly for use by food_processors and in space shuttle rockets . Another drawback has been the bulk of the cells themselves , as well as the heavy , voluminous tanks needed to safely store hydrogen on a vehicle . Virtually every auto_maker in the world is looking_into fuel_cells , if only as insurance against a rival breakthrough . Yet fuel_cell buses are practically here , said Paul Howard , vice_president of Vancouver , Canada-based Ballard Power_Systems , as he pointed to the &quot; engine &quot; of a small prototype bus parked in front of the conference site . Very small fuel_cell systems may reach the market first , according to Joseph P . Maceda , vice_president of development for H Power Corp. , a small firm based in Belleville , N.J. Unlike the highly competitive transportation industry , the world of battery-driven appliances is ripe for a new energy source , he said . Using existing fuel_cell technology , for instance , laptop_computers could run 12 hours at a stretch before recharging and still be eight ounces lighter than today ' s , Maceda said . The Fuel_Cells in Our Future Scientists and entrepreneurs are finding a surprising range of appliances and devices that could eventually use fuel_cells , which can create electricity directly from fuels such_as natural_gas without pollution-causing combustion . Transportation : * Buses and trucks * Locomotives * Ships * Airplanes * Automobiles To replace batteries in : * Laptop_computers * Movie_cameras * Smoke detectors * Remote sensors * Lighted highway signs Other uses : * Emergency electric generators * Lawn_mowers , garden tractors * Electric_power for large institutions such_as hospitals or factories or for homes * High-quality electric_power for telecommunications , entertainment * Conversion of methane gas at landfills and waste treatment plants into electricity</TEXT>
