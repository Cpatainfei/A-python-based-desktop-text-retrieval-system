   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE ; TENSIONS RISE ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL ; ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT HIRING REMAINS AN ISSUE FOR HUFFINGTON , BUT A NEW STATEWIDE POLL SHOWS HIM AHEAD . SOME ORANGE COUNTY REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS ENDORSE FEINSTEIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington campaigned Wednesday in Los Angeles and fueled a stubborn controversy over illegal immigration by charging rival Sen . Dianne Feinstein with forgery , bribery and the same federal crime he has admitted -- hiring an illegal immigrant as domestic_help . Feinstein campaigned Wednesday in traditionally Republican areas of Orange County and Riverside , where she was endorsed by several city and county leaders , including Orange County Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder and businesswoman Kathryn Thompson , both Republicans who broke party ranks . Asked about Huffington ' s allegations , the senator fired back that her opponent was committing &quot; distortions , outright lies , about me , my family , my record. &quot; Tension in the Senate_race rose another notch Wednesday with news of the first public poll to show Huffington ahead of Feinstein . KCBS-TV in Los Angeles reported Wednesday night that a statewide survey found the Republican nominee supported by 42 % of the state ' s voters compared to 40 % for Feinstein . The new poll contrasted with two previous surveys this week that showed Feinstein leading by as much as 10 points . Huffington tried Wednesday to distance his campaign from the issue that has shadowed him for nearly a week -- the admission that he employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny for more_than four years . In Los Angeles , he gave a luncheon speech to about 130 members of the Town_Hall about the priorities he would have as a U.S. senator . But throughout the day , the candidate was forced to defend his statements on the controversy and his positions on illegal immigration , particularly his support for Proposition 187 , the ballot measure that would cut most health and education benefits to illegal immigrants . As part of his defense , the candidate lashed_out at Feinstein and the &quot; liberal media &quot; that he said is helping her campaign . Among the day ' s developments : * In a morning interview on Los Angeles television_station KTLA , Huffington seemed to say that employers could hire illegal immigrants as long as they paid_for costs that might otherwise be borne by taxpayers . &quot; Now if people are going_to employ them , they should pay_for them with private funds , &quot; the candidate said . &quot; And if they ' re not , then the people will have to go_back to their own countries. &quot; Asked specifically if he was suggesting that illegal immigrants should be employed , Huffington said he supported a guest worker program for jobs that cannot be filled by American citizens . But later at a news_conference , Huffington said he did not believe it was appropriate for illegal immigrants to be employed in the United States . * Huffington , asked_in the television interview when he would provide proof of his accusation that Feinstein has employed illegal immigrants at her home , said , &quot; Thursday or Friday. &quot; But later at a news_conference , the candidate said his announcement may_not be until Sunday . He also said the announcement might not be proof about illegal immigrants at Feinstein ' s home . &quot; You ' ll have to wait , &quot; he told reporters . Feinstein rejected the accusation again Wednesday , saying she has never employed an illegal immigrant . The senator said she has had one housekeeper for more_than 10 years who was born in Milwaukee . &quot; What can I do ? . . . I have said it is false , &quot; Feinstein told reporters . &quot; You know this is someone who doesn ' t tell the truth . I mean , we have been through it over and over and over again . . . . And now , when his hand is caught in the cookie_jar , he says , ' Oh well , she has done_it too. ' And yet he has not submitted one iota of proof. &quot; * Huffington said that Feinstein was guilty of &quot; forgery &quot; in connection with her accusation last month that his home included a racially restrictive clause prohibiting its sale to nonwhite owners . The candidate said in the television interview that he did not have such a clause on his property and that Feinstein did . But Huffington acknowledged at the time that at least one of the two properties he owned in Houston included the clause . Asked about the contention of forgery , Huffington ' s campaign produced a Feinstein press handout in which the Republican candidate ' s name was placed adjacent to the racially discriminatory language . Huffington ' s campaign contended that the document was a forgery because it indicated that the candidate ' s signature was_on the same page as the controversial language . * Huffington also charged the senator with bribery , saying that a Santa Barbara newspaper reporter was acting_as an agent for her campaign last week when he approached the illegal immigrant who worked as the Huffingtons ' nanny . Huffington ' s campaign has issued a two-page notarized statement from the former nanny ' s husband saying that the reporter offered them green_cards and jobs if they talked_about their experience in the Huffington household . Both Feinstein and the newspaper reporter rejected the charge . * Federal election records released Wednesday in Washington show that Feinstein loaned her campaign $ 812 # 000 during the last 10 days of October . This brings the total the California Democrat has contributed to her reelection effort to $ 2.35 million . Huffington has given his campaign $ 27.3 million . Feinstein , according to the reports , collected $ 228 # 000 in $ 1 # 000 contributions from individuals and $ 82 # 750 from political_action_committees between Oct . 20 and 29 . The recent contributions mean that Feinstein has raised at least $ 12.5 million so far . In his speech Wednesday , Huffington sought to outline three priorities if he is elected to the U.S. Senate -- economic reform , welfare reform and &quot; breaking the grip of the special interests. &quot; &quot; Six days from now , I am asking the people of California for a mandate to get government out of their lives and off their backs ; a mandate to dismantle the federal welfare_state that is sapping our nation ' s resources and a mandate to take_on the Establishment in Washington , &quot; he said . &quot; If the people elect me , they won ' t get just another senator who will join the club , slice the pork and bring_home the bacon -- they ' ll be sending a bull into the congressional china shop. &quot; On economic reform , Huffington said he would seek to repeal the tax increases passed in Clinton ' s 1993 economic package -- which included a gas tax and other increases targeted at the wealthy . To limit the power of special_interests , Huffington also proposed that candidates be offered free_time on television for commercials . Feinstein began her day talking_about campaign reform as well . In an interview on ABC TV ' s &quot; Good_Morning America , &quot; she said , &quot; I am running against someone who has unlimited money . And if any race shows need for campaign spending reform . . . this one does. &quot; Challenging Huffington ' s self-proclaimed description of political outsider , Feinstein said the Republican congressman -- a former Ronald Reagan_Administration appointee -- has spent more time in federal_government than she has . &quot; What the race is really about is someone who has no record , who has actually been in Washington a year longer than I . . . and has done absolutely nothing but bought a House seat and turned_around and is determined to buy a Senate seat , &quot; she said . Other Orange County elected officials who endorsed Feinstein on Wednesday were Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson , Stanton Mayor Sal Sapien , Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly and Irvine Police_Chief Charles S . Brobeck . Feinstein also won endorsements from Santa Ana Councilman Ted R . Moreno , Laguna Beach Councilwoman Lida Lenney , Dana Point Councilwoman Karen Lloreda , Anaheim Councilman Irv Pickler and Stanton Councilman William C . Estrada . Huffington has won endorsements from Orange County Reps . Robert K . Dornan , Ed Royce , Dana Rohrabacher , Christopher Cox , Ron Packard and Jay C . Kim . He also has support from Assembly members Ross Johnson , Doris Allen , Gil Ferguson , Curt Pringle , Bill Morrow and Mickey Conroy . State_senators for Huffington include John R . Lewis and Rob Hurtt . At a rally at the Balboa Bay Club in Newport Beach on Wednesday , Wieder told about 80 Feinstein supporters that her own endorsement was &quot; not courageous . It ' s the right thing to do. &quot; In 1992 , Wieder angered some Orange County Republicans when she endorsed Bill_Clinton for President , which resulted in an unsuccessful recall attempt against her . Outside Wednesday ' s rally , five Huffington supporters carried signs that said , &quot; Wieder is wrong. &quot; &quot; It is time for Harriett to be honest with the voters about her political loyalties , &quot; said Jo Ellen Allen , vice chairwoman of the Orange County Republican Central Committee , &quot; and sign_on the dotted line where it says Democrat. &quot; Times staff writer David Reyes contributed to this report .</TEXT>
