   <HEADLINE> DEATH_PENALTY MEASURE SURVIVES HOUSE TEST ; CONGRESS : LAWMAKERS BACK RACIAL JUSTICE ACT , WHICH ALLOWS USE OF RACIAL STATISTICS TO SHOW BIAS IN EXECUTIONS . GOP SAYS IT WILL NULLIFY CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The House on Thursday reaffirmed support for the controversial Racial Justice Act despite Republican charges that it would effectively nullify the death_penalty or produce a racial quota system in executions . Defenders of the provision , adopted as part of the comprehensive House crime bill , argued that it is a modest step intended to overcome lingering racial bias in administering the death_penalty . A GOP attempt to remove it from the bill was defeated , 235 to 192 -- widening the margin from a showdown Wednesday , when opponents lost on a 212-212 vote . Despite the retention of the provision in the House bill , both supporters and opponents predicted that it would not survive a conference committee that will be convened to reconcile Senate and House versions of the crime legislation . The Senate bill did not include any such provision , and the Senate rejected similar proposals last year . Under the House provision , a person sentenced to death could introduce statistical evidence to support allegations of racial discrimination in the use of the death_penalty . For example , a defendant could ask a judge to consider evidence that 100 % of the death sentences in a judicial circuit were imposed on black defendants , even though blacks make_up only 10 % of those convicted of murder . The trial_judge then would decide , by comparing similar cases , whether the allegation had been proved and could either dismiss the claim or , upon a finding of racial bias in imposing the death_penalty , lower the sentence to life imprisonment . Rep . Bill McCollum ( R-Fla. ) , chief GOP spokesman on the crime bill , argued that the provision would stop states from imposing the death_penalty by placing an impossible burden on prosecutors to demonstrate an absence of racial discrimination in procedures for capital_punishment . &quot; This isn ' t a black-and-white issue , &quot; McCollum said , noting that whites convicted of murder also might use the process to escape execution . McCollum said the National District_Attorneys ' Assn . opposes the provision . He said the language included in the proposal by Rep . Don Edwards ( D-San Jose ) would allow Death Row prisoners to challenge the death sentence retroactively . But Edwards and Rep . Jack Brooks ( D-Tex. ) assured the House that they would drop the provision allowing retroactive challenges when the measure reaches the conference committee . The fight over the Racial Justice Act brought Speaker Thomas S . Foley ( D-Wash. ) and Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) into the fray . Democratic leaders wanted to keep the provision in the final bill , partly to persuade members of the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for the legislation despite their misgivings about its expansion of federal crimes subject_to the death_penalty . &quot; I ' m for the death_penalty , but I want the death_penalty to be meted_out fairly , &quot; Gephardt said . &quot; This is not about quotas . . . . Some statistics show an astounding pattern of discrimination. &quot; Sen . Orrin G . Hatch ( R-Utah ) , ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , lamented the House action , contending that the provision was &quot; intended to end the use of the death_penalty unless it is imposed on a racial quota basis. &quot; Hatch said President Clinton should speak out against the provision if he truly supports expanded use of the federal death_penalty .</TEXT>
