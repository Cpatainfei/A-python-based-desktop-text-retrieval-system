   <TEXT> Not so_long ago , Japan was regarded with a mixture of awe , envy and fear by Americans , and the Japanese model of corporate management became something of a cult in American business circles . We watched with despair as Japanese investors collected some of the icons of American popular and corporate culture , everything from Universal Studios to Rockefeller Center . The buying spree , argues Christopher Wood in &quot; The End of Japan Inc. , &quot; was a folie de grandeur , and now Japan is paying the real price of its arrogance and folly . &quot; The bubble economy &quot; of Japan has burst , Wood explains , and no one quite knows what will come next . &quot; What is at stake here is no cyclical blip but a sea of change in the way an entire society is run , &quot; Wood insists . &quot; Radical change is coming , and it will come fast. &quot; According to Wood , Japan is facing its &quot; most severe economic_crisis since the American occupation. &quot; The old magic -- a kind of financial alchemy based on &quot; export-driven pursuit of market share_in global markets , heavy capital spending , and the deliberate suppression of consumer demand &quot; -- no longer works . Wood is a former correspondent for &quot; The Economist , &quot; and nowadays he ' s working as an investment_banker in London . The blend ( or clash ) of these two sensibilities -- journalist and &quot; investment strategist &quot; -- create a savvy and sometimes impertinent tone . For example , when Wood explains how matters of money and markets are controlled by politics in Japan , he pauses to tell us that Bank_of_Japan is chartered under a 1942 statute that was copied from the Nazi Reichsbank law . &quot; The Nazis did not believe_in independent central_banks , &quot; Wood explains . &quot; So when the chips are down the far more politically aware Finance Ministry has the power to tell the Bank_of_Japan what to do. &quot; Wood writes knowingly of the political origins of the Japanese economic miracle , including the recruitment of a former war_criminal to lead an American-sponsored government in the years after World_War_II . He argues that the &quot; Hollywood culture only goes skin-deep in Japan , &quot; and the Japanese ideal remains &quot; a spirit of enlightened feudalism. &quot; And the fall of the Liberal Democratic Party , he insists , was nothing less than &quot; the collapse of a ruling order. &quot; Wood does not engage in Japan-bashing , but he is not shy about saying out loud what he thinks_about the strengths and weaknesses of Japanese culture . Japan ' s loss of leadership in the market for computers and other high_technology products , he says , is explained by &quot; Japan ' s national traits of social conformity and suppression from an early age of all forms of individualism. &quot; &quot; It has raised basic questions about whether the traditional Japanese education system , with its emphasis on rote learning in contrast to the Western liberal arts tradition of cultivating critical judgment and an inquiring mind , are really the skills best suited to the needs of serving an information society. &quot; What will take the place of Japan ' s failed policies as it hurtles toward the 21st Century ? Japan itself is being shaken by profound social , financial and political upheaval , and there is no sure way to know what the landscape will look_like when the dust settles . &quot; Japan clearly works best as a society when there is an agreed consensus , &quot; Wood concludes . &quot; But sometimes a consensus is not possible . This is the new reality that now faces Japan. &quot; But Wood himself suggests that there is a right way and a wrong way to solve the economic problems of Japan Inc. Japan faces a choice between two paths to economic recovery -- one is the rough-and-tumble of what he calls &quot; the Anglo-Saxon free-market way &quot; ; the other is &quot; a panoply of controls and subsidies in the aim of defending the status_quo whatever the cost in terms of subsidizing inefficiency. &quot; &quot; The End of Japan Inc. &quot; is a book by a specialist for a sophisticated readership . Wood names names , crunches numbers , and slips_in and out of government ministries and corporate boardrooms with the deftness of a true insider . But , to his credit , Wood manages to make_sense of the dismal science of economics and the sometimes abstruse workings of Japanese culture , politics and enterprise .</TEXT>
