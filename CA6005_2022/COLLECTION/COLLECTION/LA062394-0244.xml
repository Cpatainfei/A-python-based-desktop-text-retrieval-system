   <HEADLINE> PUC ' S VOTE WILL HELP INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS ; REGULATION : ACTION LIKELY TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT CAPITAL IN FUTURE . MAJOR UTILITIES OPPOSED THE MOVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Guaranteeing a future for California ' s independent electricity producers , the state Public_Utilities Commission voted Wednesday to stick_to the terms of a power-buying auction that had been hotly disputed by the state ' s big utilities . The independents -- many of which generate electricity from wind , solar , biomass and geothermal facilities -- still face uncertain long-term prospects as the PUC shifts the electric-power industry to competition . But for now , the PUC vote to proceed with the auction will likely free up the investment capital that many independent producers say they need to survive into the next decades , whether the electricity business is deregulated or not . &quot; Our members hope to be signing contracts_in the very near future , &quot; said Jan Smutny-Jones , executive_director of the Sacramento-based Independent Energy Producers Assn . &quot; This will result in about $ 1.5 billion in new investment and 5 # 000 new jobs in the near term . It ' s a very clear signal that California is back in business. &quot; The heart of Wednesday ' s decision was whether the PUC would stand_by the results of what most likely will be the last mandated auction of electricity generated from renewable energy sources . The utilities being forced to buy electricity from the independent producers complain that the purchases lock them into inflexible deals that may prove uneconomic over the long term . A legacy of the state ' s commitment to diverse , environmentally benign energy sources following the 1970s oil shocks , the auction -- conducted last December -- was the second such purchase by the state ' s big investor-owned utilities . On Wednesday , the commissioners voted to confirm the auction results and proceed with awarding power contracts to the independent producers . The PUC ordered only slight modifications to the auction process , which began five years ago . Disagreements over the way some producers calculated payments will be resolved by imposing a payment cap , but no other terms of the contracts will be affected . The commission withdrew an earlier proposal to defer part of the utilities ' obligation to buy electricity from the independents . &quot; It would be very unfair for us to go_back and somehow revise the ground_rules , &quot; said Commissioner Norman D . Shumway , echoing a general concern of the commission . Continued holdup of the bid awards &quot; would destroy any credibility we might have as a commission , &quot; Shumway said . The process has been stalled since December , with the utilities arguing that the procedure was skewed in favor of the independents . Southern California Edison Co . further argued that it was being forced to buy electricity that it does not yet need . The auction was held_up again in April , when the commission announced its proposal to deregulate the electric_power industry . The commissioners wanted to ponder whether the entire auction should be shelved until the PUC could flesh_out its ambitious deregulation plan . One big fear was that the power contracts could become high-cost albatrosses -- like many of those that resulted from the first mandated contracts_in 1983 -- if power prices fell dramatically under some form of deregulation . The risk could be significant ; Edison alone estimates that Wednesday ' s decision will oblige it to buy $ 16 billion worth of power over the next three decades .</TEXT>
