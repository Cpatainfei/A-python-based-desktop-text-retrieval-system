   <HEADLINE> DOWNTIME : BODY WATCH ; AT_HOME ON THE SEA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sailing alone soothes me because the sea is fair , not cruel.It judges only your ability . It does not care who or what you are . It does not ask your age , color , sex , address , sexual orientation , education or IQ , but only your competence . It requires only that you can sail . If you can , you survive . If you can ' t , better stay ashore . that ' s fair , more fair than most of us experience on land . And refreshing . -- C.E. ZOERNER JR. , Manhattan Beach</TEXT>
