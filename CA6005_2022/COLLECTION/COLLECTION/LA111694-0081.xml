   <HEADLINE> U.S. WANTS BIHAC DECLARED WEAPONS EXCLUSION ZONE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States is pressing its major Western allies to join in formally prohibiting the use of heavy_weapons around the embattled Bosnian city of Bihac , in a move to head_off further military gains in the area by the Bosnian Serbs . At the urging of the United States , the North Atlantic Council , which is the policy-setting body of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , completed an initial review of the plan in Brussels on Tuesday and sent the proposal on to NATO military_headquarters in Mons , Belgium , for further consideration . The U.S. plan would create a heavy-weapons exclusion zone around Bihac -- similar to those already established around Sarajevo and Gorazde -- that would prohibit the Bosnian Serbs from moving tanks or artillery within about a six-mile radius of the city ' s center . The idea behind the move would be to prevent further Bosnian Serb gains , which U.S. officials fear might prompt neighboring Croatia to intervene militarily to help defend Bihac -- a move that U.S. officials are concerned could widen the war significantly . But Western officials said that the U.S. proposal is meeting a lukewarm response , particularly from the_British and French , who would be asked to contribute the bulk of the additional U.N. peacekeeping troops that probably would be needed to police the zone . Any violations of the weapons prohibition would be subject_to NATO air strikes , if such actions were requested by the U.N. commander . The only U.N. peacekeeping troops in Bihac right now are 1 # 200 Bangladeshis , who are poorly armed and equipped and are considered unfit to enforce any kind of exclusion zone . And Serbian forces have refused to permit the United Nations to send reinforcements or more equipment . It was not immediately clear whether the allies ultimately would agree to go_ahead with the proposal . &quot; We ' re willing to look_at it , but there are a lot of questions that go_with it , &quot; a European official said Tuesday . Analysts said that , besides the question of added peacekeeping troops , the U.S. proposal would constitute another use of the exclusion zone to tilt the battle in favor of the Bosnian Muslims -- at a time when the allies want to appear neutral as they try to coax the Serbs into making_peace . Willy Claes , NATO ' s new secretary_general , and other key NATO officials are scheduled to discuss the issue with top U.S. policy-makers when they visit Washington later this week and early next week for previously scheduled meetings . But no decision is expected immediately . Kenneth H . Bacon , the Pentagon ' s spokesman , said Tuesday that the Administration regards the current standoff as &quot; a crucial time &quot; in the Bosnian situation . He declined to comment on specific details of the U.S. proposal . The Bosnian Muslims captured much of the territory around the city two weeks ago , but since then the Bosnian Serbs have rallied and have retaken 50 % of the territory . Bihac , in northwest Bosnia , is close to the Croatian border . Creation of the new exclusion zone would not require additional U.N. approval . The U.N. Security_Council already has given that authority to NATO and the commanders of the U.N. peacekeeping troops in the country . All they would need to do would be to declare it . Along with the proposal to establish an exclusion zone , the United States also has suggested that the allies extend the &quot; no fly &quot; zone currently in_effect over Bosnia to portions of neighboring Croatia to prevent Bosnian Serb planes from using the area to strike Bihac . The developments came as NATO formally agreed to continue its arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims without full U.S. participation in the wake of Washington ' s notice last week that American forces no longer would help enforce the restrictions . Ambassadors from the organization ' s 16 member countries endorsed an assessment by the NATO military committee saying that the U.S. withdrawal is &quot; unlikely to degrade the overall military effectiveness of the operation. &quot; Times staff writer Carol J . Williams in Zagreb , Croatia , contributed to this article .</TEXT>
