   <HEADLINE> A FAMILY ' S PAINFUL PATH TO RESOLUTION ; AFTER 30 YEARS , LAST DESIGNATED VIETNAM-ERA POW IS RECLASSIFIED BY THE AIR_FORCE AS KILLED IN ACTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nearly 30 years after their father ' s plane was shot down over Laos , the children of Air_Force Col . Charles E . Shelton this week received the official word they sought as a symbolic finale to a double family tragedy . &quot; We all agree we need some closure . We need to put this behind us , &quot; explained Los Angeles resident John Shelton , son of the man who had been the last officially designated prisoner_of_war from the Vietnam era . Now , with Col . Shelton ' s formal status changed by the Pentagon to &quot; killed in action , &quot; he can be given a memorial service at his wife ' s grave at Arlington National Cemetery . The Oct . 4 ceremony also will mark the fourth anniversary of the suicide of Dorothy Marian Shelton . A national_leader in the movement to account_for missing servicemen , she finally despaired over the lack of progress in her husband ' s case and shot herself at her San Diego home_in 1990 . Although his body was never found , Col . Shelton ' s name will be inscribed on his wife ' s tombstone . His active-duty military paychecks , which had continued through this month , will stop . And Shelton ' s three sons and two daughters hope the family can back_off from the anguished debates about whether the U.S._government has searched enough for servicemen captured or killed in Southeast_Asia . Some activists may react bitterly to the family ' s request that the Air_Force review Col . Shelton ' s status , conceded John Shelton , a 38-year-old actor . But their mother ' s death and officials ' more recent , unsuccessful searches in Laos prompted the family ' s decision , he said . &quot; I think it ' s the healthiest thing we can do , &quot; Shelton added . Family attorney Tom Reeve , who filed their formal request , agreed . &quot; The children weren ' t doing this as any kind of political statement , &quot; said Reeve , who practices in San Diego . &quot; It was something they had to do on a personal level . It was time for resolution. &quot; Amid much controversy , Dorothy Shelton had fought to keep Col . Shelton ' s status as the only Vietnam-era POW . The Air_Force agreed to that as a symbolic gesture a decade ago , according to Defense_Department spokeswoman Beverly Baker . This week ' s change to &quot; killed in action , &quot; approved by Air_Force Secretary Sheila Widnall , does not signify a policy switch , Baker stressed . &quot; We will continue to insist on an accounting_for our missing in action to the fullest extent possible , &quot; the spokeswoman said . Leaders in the POW / MIA movement said they respected the Shelton family ' s decision even though it means the government no longer lists any Vietnam_War prisoners . &quot; This is what the family wanted and we would be the last to interfere , &quot; said Ann Mills Griffiths , executive_director of the National League of POW / MIA Families . Still , that organization and others will keep pressing their belief that American prisoners remain alive in Southeast_Asia . &quot; I sympathize_with the Shelton family because they have suffered so_much . But the issue should not be closed , &quot; said former POW Eugene ( Red ) McDaniel , president of the American Defense Institute , an organization that lobbies for more POW searches . An American team in March extensively searched the area where Col . Shelton was taken captive in Laos and the area where he reportedly was buried , according to a Defense_Department press_release issued this week . The team &quot; did not find his remains or any evidence he was alive , &quot; the statement reported . Shelton was shot down on his 33rd birthday , April 29 , 1965 . U.S. rescuers contacted him by radio on the ground and he indicated he was in good_condition . Villagers later said he was taken prisoner by communist Laotian forces . His wife became a prominent crusader in the POW cause , appearing on TV talk_shows , testifying in Washington and traveling_to Asia . At the same time , she raised five children alone , the youngest of whom was only 18 months old when her husband was shot down . Every new reported sighting of POWs raised her hopes and then crushed them . &quot; This is what took our mother . The roller_coaster ride every day , &quot; said John Shelton . He was 9 when his father was captured and remembers him as &quot; a typical military dad who was kind of strict. &quot; The family is expected to receive some life_insurance payments as a result of the Air_Force decision , Reeve said . But the family would have done_better financially by keeping the POW status and the military paychecks , he explained . &quot; Their best financial interest was to hunker_down and hope nobody noticed this was coming_in every month , &quot; the attorney said . According to the Pentagon , a hearing board of three generals with combat experience in Southeast_Asia recommended Shelton ' s status change to killed in action . With Widnall ' s agreement , &quot; the change resolves the issue for his family and allows them to give Col . Shelton the proper memorial he deserves , &quot; the statement said . Now scattered in Los Angeles , San Diego and Kentucky , the family will meet at Arlington Cemetery next month for a ceremony that will include a 21-gun salute to Shelton . &quot; It will be an era gone_by for us , &quot; said John Shelton .</TEXT>
