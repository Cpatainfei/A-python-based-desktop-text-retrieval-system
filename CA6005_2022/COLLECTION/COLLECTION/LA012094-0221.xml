   <HEADLINE> LEAK AT ABANDONED OIL_WELL SEEN AS THREAT TO BAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An abandoned oil_well in Hermosa Beach is leaking as much as 100 gallons of crude_oil a week , and Terry Tamminen of Santa Monica Baykeeper , an environmental watchdog group , is trying to get_it capped . &quot; In the next 90 days , &quot; Tamminen said , &quot; we ' re going to have storms that are going_to wash that oil into a storm drain and into the bay. &quot; Local and state officials agree that the well needs capping to keep the black , sticky crude from oozing_out of the ground and finding its way into the marine world . The oil , they say , is being vacuumed up weekly until a permanent solution is found . That is not enough for Tamminen , who founded Baykeeper . He wants the well , on a vacant_lot at Cypress Avenue and 6th Street , capped at once , and he took his crusade to the Hermosa Beach City_Council last week . &quot; The bay , &quot; he said , &quot; is one of the few shallow , protected areas along the Southern California coast where fish can breathe and other marine microorganisms can regenerate. &quot; There is an abundance of plant_life , such_as giant kelp , in the bay , Tamminen said . &quot; So , if you contaminate these fragile , shallow areas , you ' re basically breaking the lower food chain. &quot; City and state officials say they are not responsible_for the leaking well . &quot; Oil_wells , &quot; said Michael A . Schubach , Hermosa Beach planning director and interim building director , &quot; are essentially a responsibility of the state Division of Oil and Gas. &quot; Councilman John Bowler said the city is &quot; kind of between the_devil and the deep blue sea for the moment. &quot; If it assumes too_much responsibility , Bowler said , Hermosa Beach could end_up paying to have the well capped and could become legally responsible_for the property on which it is located . Pamela Morris , spokeswoman for the state_Department of Conservation and its oil and gas division , said the state is trying to work_out a cooperative solution to the problem with the owner of the lot and the well , Stinnett Oil Co. , a small , private firm in Temecula . &quot; It ' s really an issue for the operator , &quot; Morris said of the leaking well . Stinnett officials did not return telephone_calls from The Times , but Morris said the firm has been extremely cooperative . According to state records , Morris said , the well was drilled_in 1930 , acquired by Stinnett in 1972 and abandoned five years ago . When wells are abandoned , they are supposed to be securely capped under the supervision of the state . Sometimes , however , underground pipes or caps corrode , allowing oil to seep out . Then , Tamminen said , the area must be dug_up to expose the shaft down to_the_point of the leak , where a new cap must be installed . Tamminen says it could cost up_to $ 100 # 000 to cap the well . State officials disagree that it will cost that much . At one time , Councilman Bowler said , hundreds of oil_wells were drilled_in Hermosa Beach , but they began closing_down in the 1950s . The councilman says this is the first time well leakage he knows of . The leak apparently began more_than a month ago , and may have been caused by early rains raising the water_table and pushing the oil toward the surface . A berm was built around the base of the rig to contain the leaking oil in a small pond , Tamminen said , but heavy rains could easily make the pond overflow . Tamminen , who lives_on a boat in the bay and zealously patrols the land looking_for probable points of pollution , succeeded in persuading the City_Council that the well presents at least one kind of danger . The city quickly made plans to erect a fence around the lot after Tamminen explained how oil collects at the base of the rig . It gets_up to three feet deep , enough to drown a curious child , he said .</TEXT>
