   <TEXT> In response to &quot; Women Are Responsible , Too , &quot; Commentary , by Judith Sherven and James Sniechowski , June 21 : I just can ' t wait for the outraged letters to arrive from the politically correct about this unspeakable truth known only to common folks and academics who study &quot; folklore. &quot; May I add another dimension I have observed in 35 years of law_practice : When people feel that they cannot get &quot; justice &quot; from the courts , they tend to seek it themselves . When we eliminated &quot; fault &quot; in divorces and sleeping around as relevant to child custody , and everybody moved to California away from friends , family and church , who or what was left to pronounce judgment ? For example , a testosterone-loaded spouse of either sex is faced with the unbearable Angst created by domestic injustice -- whether it be breach of the solemn ( to some ) vows of marriage , taunts like &quot; go_ahead and I ' ll call the cops and have you in jail &quot; or &quot; you can ' t ever see the kids until you pay me , &quot; physical or sexual pain inflicted with &quot; it ' s your word against mine , &quot; or any one of numberless ways that spouses physically or mentally torture one another short of leaving marks . In years past , a court ' s public pronouncement that the offending spouse was &quot; wrong &quot; and some usually meaningless or trivial sanction to underline the judgment was sufficient to release the tension , to still the taunts of &quot; what are you going_to do about it. &quot; Today , the aggrieved spouse can go crazy or commit murder or mayhem , as two unconvicted public figures , O.J. Simpson and Lorena Bobbitt , at this point , officially did not do . Perhaps the courts and the public would be able to find time to provide_for this basic function of law -- keeping people from settling their disputes with weapons -- if we were not so intent_on tying_up the judicial_system with enforcing old-fashioned tastes in consumption ( about 40 % ) and the long list of boomer social concerns . Perhaps making marital vows enforceable is as important as making merger_agreements enforceable . Perhaps the price of political correctness is that we cannot see our real problems anymore . LAWRENCE MERRYMAN Costa Mesa * Thank you so_much , Judith Sherven and James Sniechowski . I had forgotten that all these &quot; social &quot; problems , like spousal abuse , should be blamed on &quot; mothers &quot; -- oops , I mean &quot; insecure mothers. &quot; Heaven forbid that &quot; girls &quot; acquire any garbage from insecure fathers . If &quot; men are held fully responsible_for all their behavior , &quot; why weren ' t O.J. Simpson and countless others held accountable for their actions ? PAMELA MAXWELL Placentia * I think Disraeli said it best : &quot; There are lies , damn lies and statistics. &quot; The attempt to downplay the violence against women and to blame women for the problem is not new . But in 1994 , it is really rather disheartening to hear this rubbish being expounded again under the guise of scholarly research . Nowhere in all their selective statistical overkill did I see the numbers for how many men are brutally murdered each day by their wives . For , if I read their article correctly , it is really men who need protection from barbarous women -- and this I didn ' t know , only men are &quot; held fully accountable for all their behavior. &quot; Since men are the real victims , maybe these professionals can be called_upon to testify in O.J. Simpson ' s defense . After all , since Simpson did beat his wife and this pattern of violence may have escalated into these brutal murders , it is not his fault but rather hers . Because her mother probably told her she was worthless , and as the authors stated , &quot; Girls often acquire this garbage from insecure mothers. &quot; It is sad that the only conclusion one can draw from this article is once again , it is the victim ' s fault . ELAINE ALOIA LAMBERT Long_Beach * I was a battered spouse for 10 years , and so many times I heard the words &quot; if I can ' t have you no one can. &quot; Thank God I finally had enough courage to get_out of that marriage and situation . It was the hardest and yet the best thing I ever did for myself . Nicole Simpson has not been off my mind since June 13 . SANDRA K . KARRAM South Pasadena</TEXT>
