   <HEADLINE> BLAME FOR HEALTH PLAN ' S COLLAPSE FALLS EVERYWHERE ; LEGISLATION : THE ADMINISTRATION TASK_FORCE , INTEREST_GROUPS , CONGRESS AND PUBLIC ALL HAD A HAND IN ITS FAILURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Through the squalls and storms of the past few months , no one has been more doggedly upbeat about President Clinton ' s ambitious plan for national health_care reform than senior adviser Ira Magaziner and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . Magaziner , chief architect of Clinton ' s health_care plan , took great delight in calling attention to his office bookshelves . They were jammed with fat three-ring binders , nearly bursting with the multitude of options the Administration ' s health_care task_force had considered and rejected . The data they contained , he declared , would make believers out of anyone who doubted the wisdom of the President ' s reform formula . &quot; They ' re going to serve us very well as we go_through this process , &quot; he would say . Magaziner ' s confidence remained intact through months of rancorous public_debate over the Clinton plan . But it came crashing down a week or so ago , when he emerged briefly from the policy-making biosphere of Washington to visit his home_in Rhode Island . There , according to one associate , he finally began to see -- and understand -- the true depth of the public rejection of the Administration approach to health reform . For the first time , Magaziner realized the battle was lost . &quot; It ' s really sort of sent him into a blue_funk , &quot; the source said . Hillary Clinton is also showing signs of the strain . The First_Lady , who presided over lengthy task_force deliberations and wowed five congressional committees with her mastery of health_care minutiae , has been the Administration ' s most resolute advocate of a sweeping , government-orchestrated restructuring of health_care . Though she still expresses unflagging commitment to reform , &quot; you can pretty much see the fatigue whenever you see her these days , &quot; a Capitol_Hill source said . As congressional leaders work feverishly to salvage what they can of health_care legislation , Hillary Clinton has assumed an uncharacteristically low profile , giving only occasional interviews and spending time with daughter Chelsea instead of stumping for reform . Perhaps as much as the President himself , Magaziner and Hillary Clinton have come_to embody the Administration ' s effort to assemble and pass the largest package of social legislation in half a century , one that seemed to have everything going_for it only 11 months ago . The country was demanding big change ; that was the message of the 1992 election . And when Clinton stood before a joint session of Congress brandishing the pen with which he vowed to veto anything that fell_short_of universal coverage , the words rang with a sense of authority and determination that made health reform seem inevitable . Now , it appears that the very best the Administration can hope for is a far more modest measure that would alter insurance industry regulations but forgo any attempt to provide universal coverage . The debate now raging within the White_House inner_circle involves whether to call the effort off and start again from scratch next year , or to take whatever they can get from Congress this year and follow up with a broader bill in 1995 . No matter which course they choose , the President and his advisers will have to come_to terms with the profound public ambivalence that Magaziner discovered too late to incorporate into the Administration ' s calculations . &quot; I don ' t think anybody cares . I don ' t think anybody in the country cares . that ' s the pathetic thing , &quot; said one disillusioned Democratic congressional aide . The fundamental questions are these : What went_wrong with the Clinton health_care plan ? Why did a nation that enthusiastically endorsed the concept of reform reject the best plan that the Administration ' s experts could devise ? And who deserves the bulk of the blame ? At this point , everyone involved in the battle seems to offer different answers . It is easy to blame the White_House reform team for failing to capitalize on what appeared to be a historic opportunity , and for disregarding potential pitfalls that might have been readily apparent to those with more Washington experience . Some of the fault also lies_with a squeamish Congress and an array of aggressive interest_groups . Inevitably , one must also look_to a public that seemed to believe the impossible : that Americans could get more and better health_care without having to pay more for it . Underlying it all was the enormous size and complexity of the endeavor itself . There is a reason , after all , that presidents from Harry S . Truman to Richard Nixon fell_short in their efforts to accomplish the same goal . The fate of the Clinton reform agenda will no doubt be debated for years . But even at this stage , it appears clear that several fundamental factors contributed to its collapse : The Process Virtually everyone involved , including Clinton himself , now admits that the White_House task_force headed by the First_Lady and Magaziner botched the job . For starters , Clinton had made a campaign promise to deliver a comprehensive health_care reform plan within the first 100 days of his presidency . &quot; It was a stupid deadline that had no purpose , &quot; said one of Clinton ' s congressional allies . Predictably , the transition team failed to develop an action plan by Inauguration_Day . So it was with a far greater sense of urgency than he let_on that Clinton , five days into his presidency , announced the formation of a Cabinet-level task_force to be led by his wife . Most of Clinton ' s allies still insist that putting the First_Lady in_charge was a good idea , noting that she has been the plan ' s most forceful and effective advocate , both on Capitol_Hill and with the public at_large . But her appointment robbed Clinton of the ability to distance himself from the proposal , and turned it into more of a referendum on_his_own popularity . That weakness would become evident as a series of setbacks , from the Whitewater controversy to foreign_policy , chipped_away_at Clinton ' s approval rating . In recent weeks , congressional leaders have gone_to great lengths to distance their efforts from anything that might be characterized as &quot; the Clinton bill. &quot; Magaziner has become an even bigger target for criticism than the First_Lady . Self-assured and dismissive of those who disagreed_with him , he rapidly made enemies on Capitol_Hill , alienating many members who had been working for years to enact health_care reform . Though his intellect was universally admired , lawmakers had little confidence in his ability to make accurate political soundings . &quot; The problem started when the initial decisions were made to hand the process to one expert named Ira Magaziner , who knew , No . 1 , nothing about politics , and No . 2 , nothing about health_care , &quot; said Rep . Jim McDermott ( D-Wash. ) , the leader of a movement in the House to adopt a so-called single-payer health_care system -- in_essence a government-financed system like Canada ' s . The task_force ' s role was greatly misunderstood , even by many of the 500-plus participants . Magaziner intended for the participants to merely test theories and do research . But most thought they were working virtually round the clock to make new policy . That misunderstanding would cause plenty of hurt feelings all around . The group ' s work got_off to a rocky start from which it never fully recovered , and even Magaziner now concedes that the overnight creation of a task_force and the crash development of a health_care reform plan became an exercise in &quot; managed chaos. &quot; Each morning , there were long lines of task_force members trying to get clearance to enter the Old Executive Office_Building , which is next to the White_House . Once inside , many had no place but the floor to plant themselves and their overcoats . Desks , chairs , computers -- even telephones -- were scarce commodities . A Draconian code of secrecy was imposed by Magaziner , shutting_out the public , the press and even congressional leaders . Paperwork was to be kept to a minimum ; even contact with task_force members assigned to other work groups was discouraged . &quot; A lot of work had to be done without knowing what the context was , &quot; complained one work group leader . &quot; It was like trying to design a new national transportation_system without knowing whether there will be trains , cars , airplanes or bicycles. &quot; Despite the frenetic pace , Clinton did not meet his self-imposed early May deadline for delivering a plan . In the spring , Hillary Clinton was absent for several weeks , attending_to her dying father in Little_Rock . &quot; The whole process froze , &quot; Magaziner recalled . Even after the First_Lady ' s return , health_care remained on the back burner as the entire Administration focused_on getting Clinton ' s budget passed . When finally produced , the plan was so complicated that even its drafters had trouble explaining it , a problem compounded by the fact that the task_force had been composed of policy specialists who had little feel_for the political dimension of their work . The Interest_Groups In its complexity and its magnitude , the bill was an easy target , particularly in the highly charged atmosphere of modern interest-group politics . That lesson was clearly weighing_on Hillary Clinton ' s mind earlier this month , as she told reporters : &quot; It is more difficult in many ways today to advance a complex public policy issue than it was in the past because , if you look_at our society in_general , there are so many splintered voices of authority , and there is so_much skepticism , even cynicism , about the political process . . . . It ' s not like what it was even for Franklin_Roosevelt , who had a tough time with Social Security. &quot; House Speaker Thomas S . Foley ( D-Wash. ) laments that on such complicated legislation , &quot; people can just get_away with saying anything about it , and it isn ' t obvious that the information being given_out about it is wrong. &quot; As the weaknesses of Clinton ' s plan became apparent , virtually every big interest_group backed_away -- even those that had been among the prime_movers in getting the drive for health_care reform going . Doctors , hospitals and companies big and small all scrambled to protect their own interests , fighting it out over the details of the plan even if it meant losing their larger goals . Big companies are a case_in_point . The White_House thought it could gain the support of those employing 5 # 000 workers or more by allowing them to self-insure while requiring smaller firms to join regional health_insurance purchasing alliances . As it turned_out , few large firms were enthusiastic about remaining self-insured because they feared they would be out-muscled by the gigantic purchasing cooperatives proposed by the Administration ; in addition , they would have faced a 1 % -of-payroll &quot; assessment &quot; for opting out of the alliances . Big companies also were put_off by the tremendous flexibility that Clinton proposed giving the states . Multi-state firms feared having to operate under 50 different sets of rules . Another example was the Catholic Health Assn. , which operates more_than 1 # 200 medical facilities and was one of the strongest advocates of universal coverage . But it also was one of the staunchest foes of including abortion coverage in a standard benefits package . Other groups that had much to gain from the plan remained silent , hanging_back and hoping to gain greater bargaining leverage . The most notable was the American Assn . of Retired Persons , whose members would have benefited greatly from coverage for long-term care and outpatient prescription_drugs , both proposed by Clinton . But the AARP ' s leadership was so mindful of the firestorm that followed congressional approval of catastrophic insurance legislation several years ago , it resisted repeated personal overtures from Clinton to support his plan . By the time the organization finally signed_on , the effort was already on the brink of collapse . In the words of one frustrated Democratic senator , many of the groups that were supposed to have supported the bill proved to be &quot; a complete , miserable failure. &quot; But that was not true of the opponents . The Health_Insurance Assn . of America , many of whose members faced possible bankruptcy under a Clinton-type reform plan if alliances of business succeeded in squeezing them , launched a successful ad_campaign that raised doubts about the President ' s agenda . &quot; Harry &quot; and &quot; Louise , &quot; the characters in those ads , became the symbols of the opposition . Ironically , the HIAA shared many of Clinton ' s other goals , such_as the employer mandate and universal coverage . Congress Congress itself proved to be a moving target . Last year , more_than 20 Republican senators backed a bill that promised to achieve universal coverage by requiring people to buy_it themselves if their employer did not . Among the co-sponsors was Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , who now supports significantly scaled-back legislation . Clinton has repeatedly complained about Republican fickleness . And in an interview with reporters in August , Hillary Clinton fumed : &quot; Every time this Administration and those members of Congress who really understand the health_care reform debate have been willing to accept some modifications , the opposition has moved further away . . . . I think we ' re still dealing with smoke and mirrors. &quot; But lawmakers also say the White_House team had little feel_for the intricacies of the congressional process , and a lousy sense of timing . Some second-guessers note , for instance , that Clinton might have had a deal with Dole if he had compromised earlier on his bottom-line demand of universal coverage . Still others say that by offering such a detailed plan , the White_House gave Congress little option but to dismantle it . It would have been far better , they say , to have followed the strategy embraced by Ronald Reagan in 1986 to secure passage of his sweeping tax-overhaul plan : Spell_out broad goals , and let Congress figure_out how to get there . All sides also admit that they underestimated the degree to which the federal budget_deficit would drive the debate in Congress . The survival of every proposal hinged_on winning a favorable assessment from the understaffed Congressional Budget Office . Not only did_it slow_down the process -- indeed , both the House and Senate are still waiting_on numbers -- but it added a constraint that Roosevelt never had to face on Social_Security , or Lyndon B . Johnson on Medicare . Considering how much more expensive those programs have become , compared to how they were first imagined , there is a sound argument to be made_for a thorough economic analysis before embarking_on another one . At the same time , however , it raises questions about the extent to which economics can strangle any ambitious policy in the future . &quot; It ' s the tail wagging the dog , &quot; grumbled one Democratic senator . The Country Perhaps none of these obstacles would have mattered had public support for a comprehensive overhaul of the health_care system remained strong . But the more people learned about the cost of change , the less certain they were that they wanted to make_it . Before Clinton discovered the issue , Sen . Bob Kerrey ( D-Neb. ) had made health_care reform the centerpiece of_his_own unsuccessful 1992 presidential campaign . But he acknowledged : &quot; There ' s a price , and I think in part people are discovering that. &quot; An improving economy , moreover , made middle-class workers less fearful of losing their job and being thrust onto the street without health coverage . So what once was seen as a means of addressing the fears of everyone is now largely viewed_as a program that will benefit America ' s have-nots . In that vein , Uwe Reinhardt , a Princeton_University professor of political economics , has a harsh assessment : &quot; Universal coverage is not in the soul of the American people , or at least in those who represent them. &quot; &quot; We are a hardhearted nation . that ' s what it is , &quot; he added . &quot; We have all this money for you and me . . . but we can ' t help these low-income working stiffs . We ' re writing off the lower middle_class . that ' s who we ' re writing off . We ' re basically telling them : ' Take a walk. ' that ' s hardhearted. &quot;</TEXT>
