   <HEADLINE> MARTYR , SCHOOLGIRL , SOLDIER , TERRORIST : THE BATTLE FOR EGYPT ; SQUEEZED BETWEEN THE VIOLENCE OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS AND A CAMPAIGN OF TERROR BY THEIR GOVERNMENT , EGYPTIANS MUST CHOOSE SIDES IN A BATTLE FOR NATIONAL SURVIVAL THAT NEITHER SIDE TRULY DESERVES TO WIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is a morning like many mornings at the Hole of the Snake cafe , with the scent of cardamom-flavored coffee , the gurgling of water_pipes and the stench of the butchers ' trade_in the air . Work-weary men , their white galabiyas dappled down the front with blood , sip and gossip and nod_off surrounded by the bedlam of Cairo ' s second-largest slaughterhouse . The alarming knives of their trade , the size of fat swords , glint in holsters slung across the backs of their chairs . At a shop next door , a burly man with trunk-sized arms rhythmically whacks at the bones and entrails of what perhaps recently was a cow , with explosive results . Not an eyebrow lifts . On this morning , Mustafa the Alexandrian , at the center table near the street , is the focus of attention . In the ancient Zeinhoum slaughterhouse quarter , whose ancient wall dates_back centuries ( it was already 300 years old when the Arab crusader warrior Saladine extended it ) , time is measured in eras , and Mustafa is still &quot; the Alexandrian &quot; even though he migrated to Cairo from Alexandria 28 years ago with his butcher father at the age of 4 . &quot; Thank God I am not afraid of this kind of thing , &quot; says Mustafa of the recent night when Islamic militants , apparently caught_up in a midnight operation that went awry , opened_fire at_large with their automatic weapons -- prompting Mustafa to pick_up his knives , run_into the alley in his nightclothes and set to work_on one of them , sending him to the hospital two slices away from a human cutlet . He was offered a medal by the Ministry of Interior , which he bashfully declined . &quot; After I attacked him , I even cried about him . He was a normal , healthy young guy . But I had to do_it because I was seeing somebody killing people . How else would I beat him but cruelly ? What I did was a national duty. &quot; It is in these small dramas -- the butcher and the terrorist , the schoolgirl who died from the bomb intended for the prime_minister , the automobile dealer who turned_in the terrorist , only to be gunned_down in his shop by vengeful militants when he became a national celebrity -- that the story of Egypt ' s war with Islamic militancy has unfolded during the past two years , with every chapter ending in death : more_than 435 so far . Islamic violence has been a part of the Middle_East landscape for decades , most prominently since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran and the 16-year civil_war in Lebanon that prompted American troops to pull_out in 1984 in exasperation when confronted with Shiite Islamic wrath . But it is in Egypt , the cosmopolitan heart of Arab learning and culture , and America ' s key Arab ally , that the most crucial battle for the soul of Arabia is unfolding . With Islamic unrest also threatening stability in neighboring Palestine , Jordan , Algeria , Tunisia and even Libya , the outcome in Egypt , with its 60 million citizens , will likely shape the future of all_of North Africa and the Middle_East . Cairo ' s teeming streets , with their neon Coca-Cola billboards , lascivious movie posters and ubiquitous Kleenex vendors , seem an unlikely breeding_ground for Islamic revolution . Indeed , Egypt has long been one of the Arab world ' s most secular societies . Yet the past decade has seen a sea change in Egypt that reflects the growing influence of religion and tradition worldwide . An increasing number of Egyptian women don ' t venture outside without a modest head scarf and ankle-length dress . Mosques have sprung_up on every_other street_corner , with private mosques now numbering approximately 70 # 000 . Government television -- accused by embittered secularists of nurturing the Islamic tide -- features five-times-a-day alerts to the Muslim call to prayer . Cairo ' s poorer quarters are festooned with Muslim Brotherhood posters proclaiming &quot; Islam is the Solution &quot; that reappear as fast as the government can peel them down . Nor does the battle show any real signs of abating . After a lull of several months , when authorities rounded up and executed many key militant leaders , the renegade Gamaa al Islamiya , or Islamic Group , began striking again to disrupt the United Nations-sponsored International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in September . Warning foreigners to stay_away_from the &quot; licentious conference &quot; and its focus_on abortion , birth_control and sex education , Islamic militants attacked foreigners as far away as Upper Egypt and the Red_Sea resort of Hurghada , spraying gunfire at two busloads of Spanish and British tourists in August and October ( killing two and wounding six others ) , fatally shooting a German tourist and two Egyptians in a crowded square in September , ambushing a U.N. vehicle in mid-September ( killing one UNICEF employee and four police escorts and gravely wounding another UNICEF worker and a photographer ) and launching a fresh wave of violence against Egyptian police_officers . The cold-blooded nature of the war became chillingly clear on Oct . 14 , when one of Egypt ' s most famous citizens , Nobel Prize-winning novelist Naguib Mahfouz , was stabbed in the neck by a suspected militant as Mahfouz tottered out of his house in Cairo en route to an evening rendezvous with other writers . The 83-year-old writer , who is diabetic , hard of hearing and nearly blind , had thought the attacker was a well-wisher who wanted to shake his hand . ( Mahfouz remains hospitalized in stable condition. ) Directed by exiles in Pakistan and Afghanistan , in European capitals where Egyptian Islamic leaders have been granted asylum , in New York -- where the notorious Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman , spiritual_leader of the Gamaa al Islamiya , collected funds to dispatch back to militants in Egypt -- and even in Cairo ' s hellish prisons , the militants ' campaign has focused_on police_officers and tourists . This year , the campaign included a series of bombings at banks , designed to target foreign investment and discourage the awarding of banking interest , which fundamentalists view_as illegal under the Koran . The government has responded with a terror campaign of its own , dispatching thousands of forces into villages in Upper Egypt , a region that begins about 75 miles south of Cairo and extends through the southern and central portion of the country , deploying armored personnel_carriers and missile launchers in crowded slums and launching heavy-firepower operations against militant hide-outs . Reports of torture in Egyptian prisons -- one of them so notorious it is dubbed &quot; Scorpion Prison &quot; -- are practically commonplace : electric_shocks applied to the genitals ; lemons squeezed in the eyes ; filthy water injected into muscle tissue . Whole towns in Upper Egypt have been subjected_to repeated curfews , crushing their dubious economies , and it is not unusual for entire families to be arrested . I was not ready to believe these stories , despite repeated complaints from human-rights organizations , until I visited a family near the oasis town of Fayoum , Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman ' s hometown west of Cairo , a family whose 19-year-old son , Moursi Ramadan Mohammed Moursi , had just been hanged by the government for murderous militant activities . It ' s not unlikely that Moursi had participated in the shooting of a police intelligence_officer loathed by fundamentalists in Fayoum , as the government said he did . Perhaps he even deserved a death sentence . But sitting on the dirt floor of the living room of their tiny home -- joined occasionally by a pair of curious chickens and peering neighbors -- Moursi ' s family said they wondered what they had done to earn their place in the drama . The day of the shooting , an army of police_officers descended on the family home and started asking questions . Moursi ' s 11-year-old brother was taken_to the police_station , hanged by his feet and beaten . His mother was blindfolded and beaten . His sister , four months pregnant , was beaten and shoved against the wall , and police_officers , holding her naked , threatened to rape her in front of her husband unless he gave them information on Moursi ' s activities . Fire was set to several houses in the village , and Moursi ' s brother was thrown into the fire , then pulled_out again by a neighbor . &quot; They tied my husband to an electric pole outside and they took me to the station , &quot; says Moursi ' s sister , who miscarried after the incident . &quot; They undressed me in front of my brother and my husband and said they would rape me if he didn ' t confess. &quot; She begins to cry quietly . &quot; So of course he confessed. &quot; Surprisingly , most Egyptians are unmoved by such stories . In fact , they will say the family probably deserved it , for harboring a dangerous militant . It is fundamentalist lawyers and human-rights organizations who register the most complaints about torture in Egypt , not the public , which has generally given the government carte_blanche to do what ' s necessary to stop the terrorism that threatens to drag a tolerant and cosmopolitan country back into the nether world of religious fundamentalism . Also surprising is how few Egyptians back the government ' s efforts , either . President Hosni Mubarak ' s regime is increasingly viewed_as corrupt and dangerously out-of-touch , and much of the public supports the government only in its efforts to stop extremists . The fanfare that accompanied Mubarak ' s election to a third six-year term last fall -- complete with hot-air_balloons , leaflets dropped from planes and banner headlines exulting over his 99 % victory -- fell hollow in most Egyptian living_rooms . Here , as in most Third_World military regimes , the president had won because there was no opposition . The confrontation over the spread of militant Islam has forced nearly all Egyptians to choose sides . But it is only too clear to most citizens , caught in the middle of what they see as a struggle for the nation ' s survival , that neither side truly deserves to win . To drive along the Nile in Asyut , the most dangerous place in Egypt , is to be almost hypnotized by the sultry landscape -- a carpet of green fields , bending date_palms and slow-footed water_buffalos that shimmers along riverbanks heavy with egrets . This has always been a land of outlaws , from the original tomb robbers who made their living from the riches of the buried pharaohs to modern-day villains who tend and transport valuable caches of opium and hashish . Whole villages in Qena , just south of Asyut in Upper Egypt , are given over to men casually slinging automatic_rifles , and some villages the police simply never enter . There are professional killers to be hired here , a species spawned by the family vendettas that rage for decades at a time . So it surprises no one that many of fundamentalism ' s elements have come_together in these verdant farmlands to make radical Islam the nation ' s single most important political undercurrent . The Islamic wave first generated by the creation of the Muslim Brotherhood in 1928 got its strongest push in the 1970s from former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat , who supported Islamic militants to counter what he perceived to be a more serious threat from leftists and communists . The plan backfired when Sadat , cracking_down on the enemy he had nurtured , was gunned_down in 1981 by an Islamic Army lieutenant , Khalid Islambuli , who had seen his brother mistreated in an Asyut prison two months earlier . To understand the fundamentalists ' current appeal , one must look_at Egyptian politics from the 1920s through the ' 40s , when many of the minefields of the modern Middle_East were laid . A continuing British occupation left the local monarch looking helpless and ridiculous ; Arabs were defeated in Palestine and the state of Israel created ; corruption and unemployment grew . The country endured a 1952 revolution that was supposed to throw_out the evils of Western imperialism , an Egyptian king who answered to London and an out-of-touch wealthy elite . But in recent years , the revolution has been largely discredited and a disturbing echo of those times has begun to reverberate in the minds of many unhappy Egyptians : Nearly 50 years later , Palestine still belongs_to Israel ; the middle_class boosted by the revolution is again disappearing in the widening gulf between rich and poor ; corruption is at an all-time high , with stories daily in the local press about wealthy businessmen with government connections profiteering on the poor , and perpetual scandals involving government officials . Mubarak ' s regime is viewed by many , both supporters and opponents , as yet another tool of Western diplomacy . For decades , the center of Islamic radicalism in Egypt has been in Asyut , the country ' s third-largest city , in the achingly poor farm villages near it and in the nation ' s urban slums , disconnected swaths of misery that look_like &quot; Blade Runner &quot; landscapes just across the Nile from the neatly trimmed polo fields of the elite Gezira Club in central Cairo . Fundamentalists these past years have provided a glimpse of what an Islamic republic would look_like in many parts of Egypt . Consider Imbaba , for example , a teeming district in the heart of Cairo crowded with immigrants from Upper Egypt . Until the government moved_in 14 # 000 troops in a virtual invasion two years ago to stem the fundamentalists ' influence , the Gamaa al Islamiya had declared a &quot; state within a state &quot; in Imbaba , appointing local &quot; emirs &quot; as governors and imposing Islamic law by fiat on millions of Cairenes . More efficient than the Egyptian government in some ways , Gamaa-controlled mosques set_up discount clinics and schools , offered meat to the poor at wholesale prices and established furniture factories to employ the jobless . Dissent was little tolerated . Girls and women were sharply criticized or harassed if they ventured outside without covering their heads , and Gamaa leaders extorted &quot; taxes &quot; from Christian shopkeepers to pay_for their protection . In full view of uneasy police_officers , Gamaa leaders convened public meetings in the street each Tuesday night , openly calling_for the dispatching &quot; to hell &quot; of the &quot; criminals &quot; who had strayed from the right path of God . Gamaa ' s war with the government started in 1990 with the killing , presumably by police , of the Gamaa ' s main spokesman in Cairo . The Gamaa and its companion group , the Jihad Organization , began picking_off police and government officials , and then violence erupted wholesale with the massacre of 13 Christians in the village of Manshiet Nasser near Asyut in 1992 . The following Friday , the Gamaa &quot; emir &quot; in the adjacent village of Sanabu was killed by police as he emerged from his mosque after prayers . Soon the violence spread to attacks on foreign tourists , literary figures such_as secularist writer Farag Foda , government officials such_as Parliament Speaker Rifaat Mahgoub ( killed when his motorcade was attacked in 1990 ) , Interior Minister Hassan Alfi and Information Minister Safwat Sharif ( both escaped assassination attempts ) and the wave of bank bombings in Cairo and Upper Egypt this year . Police responded with a massive , weeklong siege on Imbaba and similar raids in the Upper Egyptian towns of Qosiya and Dairut , where previously police had feared even to enter . The Muslim Brotherhood estimates that approximately 50 # 000 Islamic defendants are imprisoned . ( Human-rights groups have variously estimated the numbers at 20 # 000 to 30 # 000. ) Most of the Gamaa ' s key leaders in Egypt are dead , victims of alleged shootouts with police , or executed after brief military trials summoned by Mubarak under Egypt ' s 13-year-old state of emergency . But only recently has the crackdown really begun to make inroads . In a series of intelligence coups , the Ministry of Interior this year aimed with surprising accuracy at the heart of the Gamaa leadership , uncovering high-level organizational meetings in_progress and killing their participants . Seven militants were killed in a Feb . 1 raid on an apartment in the northeast Cairo suburb of Zawya al-Hamra after an informant , later identified by the Gamaa as an undercover police_officer , tipped_off officials . Authorities followed up with another major bust and declared victory at an international press_conference , only to see the Gamaa strike back in mid-April with the assassination of a leader in the war on terrorism , Maj . Gen . Raouf Khayrat . The deputy head_of_state security_intelligence was incinerated when one of five assailants threw a bomb into his car as he was leaving his house near the pyramids . &quot; Our trap resulted in his death and the burning of his corpse in less than a minute , &quot; the Gamaa crowed in a fax to news_agencies . &quot; The operation asserts that mujahideen ( holy warriors ) will not delay a second to follow up tyrants , even if they feel they are safe . Raouf Khayrat ... died and burned the way they fight the youth : unjustly . But we are not alike . Our martyrs are in heaven , and their dead are in hell. &quot; Women , as the symbols of Islamic purity and protection , have been_on the front_lines of the struggle over the nature of Arab society . Officially , they have been winning in Egypt . Literacy rates , though still substantially lower than those of men , have been climbing steadily and women ' s employment is at an all-time high . Women vote_in Egypt and hold positions in the Cabinet and Parliament . Yet there has been increasing debates over their roles as professionals and homemakers , which have taken a feverish tone because Egypt seems to be identifying its society by the behavior of its women . In addition to battles in the schools over girls ' wearing the Islamic veil , many women say they are being urged by their husbands to avoid improper mixing in the workplace . Doctor and writer Nawal Sadawi , a prominent advocate of women ' s rights , had her women ' s organization shut_down by the government and its assets handed_over to an Islamic women ' s group . A Cairo University professor was shocked this year to see a divorce petition filed on her behalf by a group of Islamists seeking to protect her from the secularist views of her husband , a professor at the same university . For large_numbers of women , the question is perplexing : Where do they fit_in Egypt ' s ever-shifting society ? Last year , 500 teen-age girls north of Cairo suffered fainting spells . They were never explained , but an editor of a widely read women ' s magazine says the girls fainted because , in a world of increasingly conflicting signals , they didn ' t know what else to do . &quot; Should they continue their studies and plan on working , or expect to get_married and keep house ? Should they wear the veil ? Or skirts and blouses ? They fainted because they simply don ' t know what to do , &quot; Ekbal Baraka says . Nagwa , a communications graduate of the American University of Cairo who doesn ' t want her last_name used , faced such choices . She had reached the dubious age of her mid-30s last year before finally consenting to become engaged , to her family ' s great relief . Nagwa , who usually wears red lipstick and stylish slacks , had said she didn ' t want to submit to the kind of man who would not allow her to work or maintain her own independence . But after meeting Ahmed , a young engineer and religious conservative , she admitted she might one day consider wearing the higab after her marriage . As the months went_on , she found herself becoming more and more drawn to religion . When they are married , the couple announced , they plan to install a small mosque on the ground_floor of their home . Cooing affectionately to her fiance over the telephone one afternoon , Nagwa prepares to end the conversation and go_back to work . &quot; There is no God but Allah , &quot; Ahmed says . &quot; And Mohammed , &quot; she replies , &quot; is his prophet. &quot; The town of Dairut , just north of Asyut , is still reeling from more_than a year of on-again , off-again curfews and police crackdowns . It is digging_out of the crisis but remains a sullen little city . Merchants complain that they are being forced to pay taxes for a year in which most of the time they could not even leave their homes . &quot; I did not make any profit . I was spending out of my assets , which are almost none , &quot; one grocer complains . According to a recent survey , 12 # 323 of Dairut ' s 61 # 000 families live_in shared housing , and 479 families live_in shacks . The government , recognizing the shortfalls of the past , has recently allocated 10 million Egyptian_pounds ( $ 2.9 million ) on projects for drinking_water , sanitary services and new electrical hookups . But the survey found 182 # 000 young_men in Dairut -- a virtual powder_keg -- unemployed . An aging sheik sits in his small reception_room and says the government has not made_good on its promises to build a new life for Upper Egyptians . For years there have been promises , and no results , he says . &quot; The government and the interior ministry say we are the ruling party that has the power and the authority in this country . And the youth say we are the youth that have the energy , the belief and the ideals . Each one of them started pushing his horse forward . And Egypt does not find the person that says , ' Stop there , ' &quot; the old_man says . &quot; All of Egypt now is waiting for an explosion , a national blow-up. &quot; This appears to be a gentle old_man . He is from one of Dairut ' s oldest aristocratic families and is a former member of the provincial government . As he sits somewhat nervously in this Islamic hotbed , I ask him if the claims of violence are being exaggerated . Are foreign tourists safe here ? &quot; No , &quot; he says , his wide eyes unblinking . &quot; I do not think tourists are safe . Because there is no scale or indicator to the situation now . The government says it wiped_out the Gamaa , and the next morning the Gamaa carries_out an operation . And it turns_out the government doesn ' t know anything about the Gamaa. &quot; The problems of Dairut are magnified in the slums on the outskirts of Cairo , where Upper Egyptians have migrated over the years only to find a new urban life of poverty and limitation . In the Zawya al-Hamra district , site of one of the most violent confrontations between police_forces and the fundamentalists in February , stacks of concrete houses stand_in a bleak landscape of dust , garbage and running sewage . On a recent steaming afternoon , a crowd of men is clustered around a public water_tap , sweating with wrenches over a broken water_faucet that is the single source of water for an estimated 50 # 000 people . &quot; This whole neighborhood drinks out of this faucet -- maybe 40 years we ' ve been living like this , &quot; complains Sayed Sharqawy , a retired refrigerator technician . &quot; We put this in with our own money and we ' re fixing it with our own money . People s--- in cans and have to come and dump it in the street . Nobody else does anything for us because this is a poor neighborhood . They have no high-ranking officers of the government here. &quot; &quot; No water , no sewage , no electricity , no vegetation , &quot; adds Ali Abu Dahab , a 40-year-old day_laborer who lives_in two rooms with his wife and five children . &quot; People are living_in a primitive world of instinct. &quot; In the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood , a small , unmarked office above a fetid vegetable market in downtown Cairo , spokesman Maamoun Hodaiby sits in a gray leisure suit below a poster depicting a large octopus , labeled with a U.S. flag , spreading its tentacles around the globe . Another picture_shows Jerusalem ' s Dome of the Rock , one of Islam ' s holiest sites , locked with a chain bearing the insignia of the Star_of_David . It poses the question : &quot; Omar conquered it , Saladin freed it , who has it now ? &quot; The Muslim Brotherhood professes no relationship with the militant Gamaa al Islamiya , or Jihad Organization , and claims to be the nonviolent Islamic alternative in Egypt . Nonetheless it is illegal , and its members have joined the Egyptian Parliament only by running_on the lists of the Socialist_Labor_Party . And its statements deploring the violence have only begun appearing lately in_earnest , because of the sheer quantity of blood washing the Egyptian streets . Before that , the Brotherhood tended to say things like it &quot; regretted &quot; the violence &quot; on both sides &quot; and pointed_out it would n ' t have happened had there been a democratic alternative . &quot; Behind this violence there are economic , financial , intellectual and social factors involved . But the most important thing is the lack of hope , hope for a peaceful solution to the problem . People ask themselves : How will the change come ? And they become convinced that there is no chance for change except by using force , &quot; Hodaiby says . &quot; Nevertheless , we are patient . ( Spanish dictator Francisco ) Franco ended . The communists ended . Everything has an end . You see , this government is very powerful in killing , and it has no other power . No one supports this regime . They have been in power more_than 30 years , and they have got no plan . This man Mubarak has got nothing to say to his people . Nothing. &quot; Indeed , Mubarak is widely perceived among political analysts to be attacking the symptoms of terrorism while moving only haltingly toward the free market and political reforms that could underscore a wider public confidence in Egypt ' s future . Privatization of inefficient state-run companies has moved at a snail ' s pace , partly due_to fears of increasing unemployment , partly due_to the bureaucrats who run them , who have been the basis of the regime ' s support for decades . To his credit , Mubarak has managed to cut inflation , stabilize the rate_of_exchange and reduce the level of foreign debt , laying the groundwork for more economic prosperity . But it has not been enough to inspire widespread confidence , let alone a feeling among poor Egyptians that they will benefit from any bonanza to come . Tahseen Bashir , a longtime Egyptian diplomat , cautions that the government ' s harsh crackdown on Islamic militants could backfire . &quot; This is creating an equalization in the minds of some of these groups and the police of one violence against another . The concept of a national state that keeps some norms of behavior is being squeezed_out of existence . And that is very dangerous. &quot; Mubarak has tended to blame Islamic violence on outside support from Iran and Sudan . Privately , senior government officials say Egypt is too turbulent and too underdeveloped to plunge headlong into democracy . They are fond of pointing to the experience in neighboring Algeria , where an Islamic party was legalized , gained the majority in national elections , forced the army to take_over the country in a coup and plunged the nation into civil_war . &quot; A reasonable degree of democracy is possible . A democratic trend which could be consolidated , which could be improved . And I believe this is what is happening in Egypt , &quot; says one government official , who asked not to be identified . &quot; But it seems that during this process some forces are unleashed , and this intermediate stage is very critical . You allow people to criticize , and allow them to group into political_parties , but the whole situation has not yet ripened for full-fledged democracy and an exchange of authority . &quot; Don ' t forget these extremists received a great_deal of support from the government under Sadat , &quot; adds the official . &quot; And now we are the ones who are sorry_for it. &quot; Almost no one thinks the situation has yet progressed_to a point where the stability of the regime is seriously threatened . &quot; They do not have the ability to either overthrow the Egyptian government or to cause any kind of acute crisis in Egyptian society , based on what we ' ve seen so far , &quot; says one Western diplomat who has studied the Islamic violence . &quot; But the police in areas like Asyut have become , in the eyes of a lot of people , another warring clan , and you ' ve had a lot of people emerge from detention with a deep sense of personal grievance . Their families have a sense of personal grievance . And now the cycle looks very difficult to escape. &quot; Cairo attorney Montasser Zayat concurs . &quot; The picture is getting darker , &quot; says Zayat , who has gained notoriety in Egypt , first by defending Al-Sayed Nosair in the United States ( Nosair was convicted on charges stemming from the death of militant Rabbi Meir Kahane ) , and later by taking_on the most high-profile fundamentalist cases in Egypt , including the defense of Omar Abdul Rahman . Zayat does not openly profess membership in the Gamaa al Islamiya , but at his ramshackle downtown office in Cairo , where clients ' wives sit draped in anonymous black in the waiting room , he often acts_as their unofficial spokesman . He is in prison now , held after protesting the arrest of a colleague who died in confinement . ( Authorities say the man , Abdel Harith Madani , died of asthma . His fellow attorneys say he was tortured to death. ) &quot; It is difficult to say the government can destroy the Islamic organizations , &quot; he said a_few months before his arrest , &quot; because by the nature of the Islamic religion , its followers become harder and have more solidarity after each crisis . We ' re waiting for the frustration explosion . Natural_laws say that for every action , there is a reaction . Suppression will always be followed by an explosion , and previous history shows us that oppressors never last more_than 15 years. &quot; Sitting behind his desk , he took a sip of sweet tea . &quot; Every household in Cairo has an element of the Islamic organization in it , and the Egyptian army in the end will find itself between two solutions . Either to be unbiased , or to comply with the national desire by changing the regime . There is no third alternative. &quot;</TEXT>
