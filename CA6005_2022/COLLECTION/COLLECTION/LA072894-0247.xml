   <HEADLINE> GOP MODERATES WARN OF RELIGIOUS RIGHT TAKEOVER ; POLITICS : CONSERVATIVES ARE OUTFLANKING MAINSTREAM REPUBLICANS , LEAVING NATIONAL PARTY AT RISK , SENATORS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Many moderate Republicans , including veteran U.S. senators , have concluded with a mixture of alarm and amazement that the religious right -- already a potent grass-roots force -- is poised to take_control of the national party and precipitate a political confrontation unparalleled since the rise of Barry Goldwater 30 years ago . And , they say , middle-of-the-road Republicans have only themselves to blame : While Christian conservatives have worked tirelessly to take_over party organizations at all levels from coast to coast , GOP moderates have remained passively on the sidelines , unwilling to fight with members of_their_own party over abortion and other explosive social_policy issues that dominate the conservatives ' agenda . Unless their own wing becomes more aggressive , these mainstream Republicans warn , the religious right will reach Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson ' s stated goal of winning &quot; a working majority of the Republican_Party &quot; by 1996 . And that could alienate millions of independent voters . &quot; If we let this thing continue to percolate without attacking it head-on , &quot; declared Pennsylvania Sen . Arlen Specter , a leading moderate , &quot; we will assure President Clinton ' s reelection. &quot; In 1964 , Arizona Sen . Goldwater won the GOP presidential nomination after a grass-roots campaign by the conservative wing of the party but was mauled in the general_election by Democrat Lyndon B . Johnson . Although Specter reported some progress in a quiet campaign to persuade Republican senators to oppose addressing the abortion issue in the party ' s 1996 platform , he has not convinced Republican_Party Chairman Haley Barbour or other GOP leaders . They have told him that failing to include an uncompromising anti-abortion plank would alienate Christian conservatives . The 1992 GOP platform called_for a &quot; human life amendment &quot; to the Constitution , outlawing abortion in all circumstances . Sen . Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas , another GOP moderate , shares Specter ' s assessment . The religious right &quot; has taken_over a lot in Kansas , &quot; she said , &quot; including my own county organization. &quot; &quot; Part of the problem , &quot; Kassebaum said , &quot; is that moderates aren ' t willing to work in the trenches , while the Christian conservatives have gone door to door and worked hard and won control fair and square . My hat ' s off to them for that. &quot; The view is widely held that moderates have been &quot; asleep at the switch , &quot; in the words of former Sen . Warren B . Rudman ( R-N.H. ) . Arthur Kropp , president of the liberal People for the American Way , which issued a recent report detailing extensive religious right victories in the GOP , criticized the Republican moderates . &quot; I ' m no fan of the religious right , &quot; he said in an interview , &quot; but they didn ' t steal anything , they have just worked harder through the process to win the party over to their side and there has been no challenge to them by the national party. &quot; Already religious conservatives are far more potent than they were in 1992 , when they dominated the Republican National Convention with an uncompromising platform and fiery rhetoric that -- in the view of many analysts -- hurt George_Bush ' s bid for reelection . While it is the religious right ' s unyielding anti-abortion stance that has most worried moderates in the past , Pat Robertson has won wide support for another position that is anathema to most mainstream Republicans and independents : challenging the basic American principle of separation of church and state . Robertson has denounced the principle as &quot; a lie of the left , &quot; stirring Christian conservatives to action throughout the country . Specter said that he was shocked when Iowa Republicans booed him last month after he stressed church-state separation and declared the Texas GOP convention , where delegates carried signs saying &quot; A Vote for Our Candidate is a Vote For God , &quot; was &quot; wrong philosophically &quot; for defying the principle . The Arizona Republican Assembly , recently formed to push for conservative candidates within the GOP , declared that God &quot; has ordained moral absolutes which govern the universe &quot; and that the Constitution is &quot; the product of divine Providence. &quot; Robertson , through his own national television_program and other media , has done &quot; a tremendous job of trashing the whole idea of church-state separation , &quot; said the Rev . Robert L . Maddux Jr. , a Bethesda , Md. , Baptist minister and former director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State . Robertson has &quot; deliberately confused the idea of church-state separation with rhetoric about Christians participating in government , &quot; and the idea has taken_on a bad odor among most religious conservatives , Maddux declared . &quot; It ' s part of a scary movement that has duped a lot of good people with conservative leanings. &quot; GOP moderates are even more concerned about what the rising influence of uncompromising conservatives will do to the image of the party in the eyes of independent voters . Rudman pointed to the recent Virginia GOP convention that nominated Iran-Contra figure Oliver L . North for the Senate as an example of what he sees as the problem when religious conservatives take_over . &quot; That Virginia convention was as representative of the Republican_Party as Uganda is but those who controlled were organized and effective and nominated a far-right candidate , &quot; he said . The religious right has become so powerful , Rudman said , that no Republican with presidential ambitions will dare defy it . He pointed to the case of Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , who balked at endorsing the North nomination until Robertson told him that an endorsement would be important to Christian conservatives in 1996 . Subsequently , Dole not only endorsed North but contributed $ 1 # 000 to his campaign . Dole &quot; doesn ' t really believe_in what the religious conservatives do but he doesn ' t want to alienate them , &quot; Rudman said . &quot; Occasionally in politics you just have to rise above principle. &quot; Rudman , Specter and Kassebaum , along with Sen . John H . Chafee ( R-R.I. ) , former Secretary_of_State Henry A . Kissinger , California businessman David Packard , and then-Rep . Tom Campbell ( R-Stanford ) were among a group of moderates who formed the Republican Majority Coalition in December , 1992 , to counteract the growing influence of the conservative Christians on the GOP . Campbell , who reported that the religious right controlled 32 of California ' s 58 county Republican central committees , was named chairman . The organization conducted several public hearings in 1993 , including one in Los Angeles . It also announced that it would endorse a candidate in the 1996 nominating contest and would assemble a list of some 250 # 000 moderate and liberal Republicans to be used by its candidate in building a grass-roots organization . This year , however , the group has been relatively inactive . Specter said that he sees little inclination by moderates today to challenge the religious right . He has met behind closed doors with representatives of several women ' s abortion-rights groups , including Republicans for Choice , to seek their support in an effort to strip the anti-abortion plank from the 1996 platform . &quot; But I couldn ' t get them to act . I ' m not getting much help , &quot; he said . The religious conservatives have been challenged in strong terms recently by Democratic leaders who no doubt hope to add_to the divisiveness of the GOP . President Clinton , a frequent target of attacks from religious conservatives , declared : &quot; Anyone who doesn ' t agree with them is fair_game for wild charges , no matter how false. &quot; And Rep . Vic Fazio ( D-West Sacramento ) , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , assailed what he called &quot; the fire-breathing Christian radical right. &quot; The Democratic attacks have touched_off a barrage of counterattacks by Republican_Party leaders who have defended the religious right and accused the Democrats of an orchestrated strategy of &quot; Christian bashing &quot; to deflect public attention from Clinton ' s low standings in the polls and problems caused by the Whitewater controversy . In a memo to GOP leaders calling Clinton ' s legislative and regulatory agenda &quot; hostile to both values and religion , &quot; Barbour said that the Democrats ' attacks &quot; reveal just how far out of the mainstream their own party has drifted. &quot; Except for defending the conservative Christians and accusing the Democrats of attacking religion , the Republican leaders have been largely silent on the issue . &quot; I don ' t know that the party could have a better strategy than to just keep accusing the Democrats of attacking religion , &quot; said a veteran Kentucky Republican leader . The Kentuckian , a moderate who declined to be identified , said : &quot; In large groups of Republicans you just don ' t talk_about it . It ' s so emotional that I look_around the room to see who ' s there before I say anything. &quot; In Kentucky ' s 3rd Congressional District , Susan Stokes , a state representative who favors abortion rights , fought_off the religious right to win the Republican nomination for a House seat -- only to see the conservatives back a Republican running as an independent in the general_election . &quot; They just want to make an ideological statement , &quot; Stokes said . &quot; I feel their tactics reflect a desperation . They used scare tactics , talked_about baby killers , and sent_out mailings that didn ' t reflect the truth. &quot; In Georgia , where veteran political analyst Bill Shipp joked that &quot; you could put all_the moderate Republicans in a phone_booth , &quot; two religious right candidates -- businessman Guy Milner and former Waycross Mayor John Knox -- are in a runoff for the gubernatorial nomination . The candidate they defeated in the primary , Paul Heard , former state House minority_leader , Shipp said , would have been a stronger opponent than either of them to face Gov . Zell Miller in the general_election . In Texas , Dolly Madison McKenna , a moderate rejected by the GOP in a congressional race and in an election for state party chairman , said that moderates &quot; got lazy and didn ' t recruit while the radical right group , manipulating people through the churches , has gained control. &quot; A Houston businesswoman , she was booed at the Texas GOP convention this year when she declared : &quot; There are people in this audience who want the Republican_Party to be a church. &quot; McKenna , who plans to set_up an organization to identify moderate Republicans and persuade them to become active in the party , said that activists of the far right have &quot; recruited through the churches with gay bashing and anti-abortion crusades and other emotionally charged issues and they have taken_over party organizations throughout Texas and other parts of the country. &quot; * FOREIGN_POLICY BROADSIDE : Key Republicans say Clinton is undermining U.S. prestige .
