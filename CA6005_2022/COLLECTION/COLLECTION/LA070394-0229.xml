   <TEXT> Lee Stern can laugh about it now . He can find humor in a little enterprise he once undertook that had its ups and downs . &quot; Obviously , I never was interested in money , &quot; Stern said . &quot; Being in soccer prevented me from being one of the major owners of the Chicago Bulls. &quot; Stern , a successful Chicago commodities broker , once was a major force in American soccer . He owned the Chicago Sting of the now-defunct North_American Soccer League . He turned_down a chance to be involved with the Bulls because by the time the offer was made &quot; the Sting was losing more money than I could think_about , &quot; he said . Stern , who also once was an investor in the Chicago White Sox , lost millions trying to sell soccer to America . So did Texas oilman Lamar Hunt , who once owned the NASL ' s Dallas Tornado . If anyone in the United States has reason to be bitter by the mere mention of the word soccer , it is these gentlemen . Yet , last week there was little doubt who was running a soccer fever in Chicago and Dallas . They , like so many other Americans , have been swept_up in a euphoric wave of excitement over World Cup ' 94 . Hunt had seen 10 matches by the third weekend and was leaving town to see more . But before anyone declares America a bona_fide soccer-crazy nation , there is much to be done . The architects of the World Cup organizing committee face a heady task , the development of a professional soccer league that becomes part of Americana . That , after all , is the ultimate aim of this monthlong extravaganza . &quot; It ' s not like soccer comes_into America today as a virgin sport , untouched and untried , &quot; said Kyle Rote Jr. , one of the biggest names in U.S. soccer 20 years ago . If the Lee Sterns , Lamar Hunts and a host of other successful sports owners could not make_it work , how will it be different this time ? &quot; I think the party will be over in a couple weeks and soccer will be where it was , &quot; said David Burns of Burns Sports Celebrity Service , a Chicago-based company that promotes athletes for commercials . Even Leigh Steinberg , a sports agent from Newport Beach who represents a number of U.S. national team players , is not sure the sport will gain a foothold in America . And if it does not , then the legacy of the World Cup will be nothing more_than fond memories . After the United States upset Colombia in the first round of Group_A , the sport ' s future looked promising . The next day , calls came pouring in , Steinberg said . But when the team lost a_few days later to Romania , &quot; It hit with a dull thud. &quot; Such is the fickle nature of the American public . Obscure Olympic athletes such_as speedskater Dan Jansen or skier Tommy Moe were darlings during the Winter_Olympics last February , but where are they now ? Put simply , Steinberg believes soccer ' s future rests_on the outcome of Monday ' s Brazil-United States match at Stanford Stadium . &quot; It won ' t be different ( this time ) unless there is a spectacular upset victory against Brazil on July 4 , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re a trendy country . We tend to focus_on things that are hot . All of a sudden soccer is hot. &quot; But a bad show Monday with millions of viewers expected to be watching could cool America ' s interest . Still , the soccer community is unswayed . Now that the World Cup has captured the imagination of a nation , those who have toiled in the soccer trenches for much of their lives believe their sport and time has come . It might take_five years to find_out if they are right . Major_League Soccer , which is scheduled to open in 12 cities in April of 1995 , is hoping to lay a foundation to sustain the sport . The World Cup was the jump start , and today , optimism is oozing from the Century City offices it shares with the World Cup ' 94 organizing committee . Alan Rothenberg , head of World Cup USA ' 94 , the U.S. Soccer Federation and MLS , is part of the reason many believe the new league has a better chance of succeeding than past efforts . &quot; Alan came_up with this brilliant scheme that might be the only scheme that could work , &quot; said Rote Jr. , a Memphis sports agent . But when the World Cup started June 17 , the proposed league had so many question_marks some were skeptical . For instance , the day before the Cup opener in Chicago , Rothenberg introduced seven cities as charter_members of MLS instead of the expected 12 . Rothenberg said this week five more cities will be named by Aug . 1 , although others say it probably will happen sometime in the fall . Furthermore , sponsors and financing , the backbone of the single-entity league , which will have an operating plan similar to the franchise system used by McDonald ' s restaurants , have not been announced . But as much as the World Cup has piqued interest , it has brought potential investors to the table , MLS insiders say . Harley Frankel , senior_vice_president of MLS , worked as an NBA executive for eight years . Before that , he worked in the Carter_Administration . &quot; But this is a challenge that I think can succeed , &quot; he said . &quot; What a lot of people miss is this is not an attempt to have instant success like the NBA or baseball is enjoying. &quot; Frankel said the league ' s blueprint to build slowly is solid , but the unexpected success of the World Cup has solidified its position . &quot; It has given potential investors more confidence , &quot; he said . &quot; It has given television more confidence that it will succeed . The World Cup has given us more muscle. &quot; Or as Roy Wegerle of the U.S. national team said : &quot; If this doesn ' t kick it in , nothing will. &quot; Yet , like most new endeavors , MLS faces many obstacles . There is a gulf of difference between interest and investment . No doubt the league has gained the attention of sponsors , but until the money is raised the going will be difficult . The league hired a Wall_Street investment_banker to help raise funds , either a sign of strength or weakness . And those who invest must overcome the fears of MLS ' own five-year projections . According to a staff memo , the league expects to lose $ 63.6 million from 1993 to 1997 , including almost $ 30 million in its first season . The losses are based on an average attendance of 12 # 500 per match . By comparison , the Clippers , in their 10th season in Los Angeles , averaged 11 # 489 in 1993-94 . Perhaps the biggest challenge facing U.S. soccer is bringing its community together with a common purpose . Although that is Rothenberg ' s aim , his stranglehold on the sport has caused ill_will . Rick Davis , coach and general_manager of the Los Angeles Salsa of the American Professional Soccer League , has fired a loud salvo . His league is being told it will serve as a second division , or minor_league , to the MLS . &quot; Why has the MLS been given preferred status when the APSL has been going_for four years now ? &quot; asked Davis , a former member of the NASL ' s Cosmos . And don ' t forget yet another league already in place : Jim Paglia ' s League 1 America . All three want to have the prestigious first division status , but MLS has clout . Mostly , it has Rothenberg , who has gained immeasurable respect from FIFA , soccer ' s world governing body , because of the success of World Cup ' 94 . Rothenberg said FIFA President Joao Halvelange told him last week America ' s Cup has been the best in the sport ' s history . Few would question the work of World Cup organizers . But when it comes_to the MLS and the sport ' s future , Davis thinks an opportunity has been lost . &quot; I am disappointed and frustrated that the MLS isn ' t going_to play a game for nearly a year after the World Cup , &quot; Davis said . &quot; The league should have been ready to capitalize on new spectator interest here as soon as the World Cup ended . They knew in 1988 that the World Cup was coming here , so they had six years to organize and get the pro league going. &quot; Said John Harkes , a star on the U.S. national team : &quot; If people who are up there in top places are doing_it for the game and not for making a buck , it will succeed . If they ' re doing_it to make a quick buck , it ' ll be out of there in a heartbeat . that ' s the way it ' s always been for soccer. &quot; If MLS sticks_to its modest goals in the beginning , it has a chance to gain acceptance . Hunt , 62 , said he would love to join the fun , but is too old to start_up another adventure . But being around football much of his life , he notes that sports goes_through in cycles in America . &quot; Nothing stays the same , &quot; he said , adding that soccer just might catch_on this time . To do so , it must compete with a broad menu of sports options , from baseball to football to basketball to hockey to college sports . &quot; We ' re not a culture where one sports dominates , &quot; Rote said . &quot; You can ' t go from no passion and no knowledge in one step. &quot; But the World Cup has at least changed perceptions . The international flavor of the matches in the nine host cities has been a wonderful experience for Americans who have participated . Without the electrifying scene of World Cup competition , soccer could lose its dynamics , said Burns , the Chicago agent . &quot; Atmosphere isn ' t a bunch of little kids running_around in shorts for momma and papa to watch them , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s the mistake soccer is making. &quot; Stern believes soccer has made_it here all along because of the number of youths playing -- as_many as 16.4 million . &quot; This sport is here to stay , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s just too_much fun for kids to play. &quot; Does that translate into a successful pro league ? It has not in the past . But after the World Cup , it might in the future . * Staff writers Julie Cart and Mike Penner contributed to this story .
