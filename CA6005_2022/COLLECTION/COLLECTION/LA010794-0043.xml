   <TEXT> Mexican soldiers searching for Indian rebels sealed_off highways out of a southern region ' s main town Thursday , stirring concern among rights groups looking_into reports of abuse by troops . Late in the day , the army also apparently launched a new offensive against the guerrillas . Four airplanes fired rockets near the rural town of Cerro Huitepec , three miles southwest of this regional center . There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage . The government , however , took steps to build support in Chiapas state , a poor , predominantly Mayan region . Officials said 20 tons of rice , beans , powdered_milk and other food was being flown to the state . The federal_government also promised to strengthen its public works programs that build roads , schools and hospitals in the area . Rebels said they began the uprising Jan . 1 to highlight the plight of poor Indians in Chiapas . The presidents of El_Salvador , Guatemala and Nicaragua and the president-elect of Honduras were to arrive today in Mexico_City to discuss the crisis and show their solidarity with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . The insurrection has rattled Central_Americans in countries newly emerging from years of civil_war . Six days after the uprising broke_out , rebels were still active in some remote areas of Chiapas , a lush mountainous region bordering Guatemala and the Pacific , Interior Ministry spokesman Eloy Cantu Segovia reported . The village of Chanal east of San Cristobal de las Casas was reported to be in rebel hands by seven villagers who fled on foot over the mountains Wednesday . There had been conflicting reports on whether Chanal was recaptured by the army this week . * One of the seven , Marcelino Gomez Lopez , told El Tiempo newspaper in San Cristobal on Thursday that the rebels were not allowing villagers to leave . The rebels shot and killed a schoolteacher who tried to escape , Gomez Lopez said . The military said 105 people had been killed since the uprising began with coordinated attacks on towns in Chiapas , Mexico ' s southernmost state . The rebels from the previously unknown Zapatista National Liberation Army said they were fighting for socialism and to improve the lot of Indians who lack potable water , food , education and housing . On Thursday , soldiers sealed_off southbound highways out of San Cristobal , the region ' s main town . Helicopters hovered overhead . Most of the fighting has been south and east of San Cristobal . Heavily armed troops guarded the main square in the colonial town of 80 # 000 people , about 450 miles southeast of Mexico_City . An Associated Press correspondent reported no untoward events Thursday along the one highway open into San Cristobal from Tuxtla Gutierrez . San Cristobal and Tuxtla Gutierrez , the capital of Chiapas , were the only places accessible in the region to reporters and independent human_rights observers , who expressed concern about the army ' s move . &quot; If security reasons make_it necessary to seal_off areas , it should be explained and should be temporary . Otherwise it raises concerns about . . . violations , &quot; said Juan Mendez , executive_director of Human_Rights Watch-Americas , an organization monitoring rights violations in Latin_America . Salinas sent his top human_rights official to the battle zones to investigate possible army abuses . Jorge Madrazo , chief of the government-run National Human_Rights Commission , arranged Thursday to start taking complaints . &quot; I think we would be calling_on the Mexican government to allow both the press and an impartial human_rights investigation to take_place , &quot; Mendez said by phone from Washington . * He said his group was concerned particularly about two incidents : the apparent execution-style killings of rebels in Ocosingo , site of the fiercest fighting , and the deaths of about 17 people whose bodies bore battered faces and bullet_holes in the head . The Peasant and Agricultural Workers Center , an organization independent of the government , reported meanwhile that the army arrested five of its leaders bound for a meeting Wednesday with government officials in Tuxtla Gutierrez . It said in a news release that their whereabouts were unknown and expressed concern for their safety . The naked bodies of three men and a young_girl killed while driving_out of San Cristobal remained unclaimed in a chapel in the general cemetery . The local newspaper El Tiempo said it knew of three survivors of the van shooting incident , a focal_point of concern by rights groups . Its reporters said at least two of the three were unconscious , that all were civilians and were in a military_hospital . In Mexico_City , the daily El Universal said a message purportedly sent by the rebels said they were organizing an urban front to fight the idle rich throughout Mexico . The note was left in a movie_theater bathroom , it said .</TEXT>
