   <HEADLINE> SURGE IN BOND YIELDS SENDS DOW TUMBLING 31.23 POINTS ; MARKETS : INVESTORS ARE SPOOKED BY GOVERNMENT REPORT SHOWING INFLATION IN THE FIRST_QUARTER ROSE FASTER THAN EXPECTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Long-term bond yields posted one of their biggest one-day rises ever on news that a key measure of inflation ran at a surprisingly high rate in the first_quarter . The latest jump in yields , after nearly a full week in which they had declined , dashed hopes for a sustained turnaround in the battered bond market , analysts said . The rate on the Treasury ' s bellwether 30-year bond soared to 7.26 % on Thursday from 7.10 % on Tuesday , the last time bonds traded before Wednesday ' s day of mourning for former President Richard Nixon . Bonds ' selloff Thursday also clipped the stock_market , where the Dow Jones industrials fell 31.23 points to 3 # 668.31. However , broader stock indexes were mixed . Traders said bond yields initially fell Thursday morning , after the government reported that the nation ' s gross_domestic_product grew at a moderate 2.6 % annual rate in the first_quarter . That was less than the 3.2 % expected by many economists , leading some investors to conclude that the economy is weakening -- an environment that could allow_for lower interest_rates . But digging deeper into the GDP report , investors quickly panicked over the first-quarter change in the government ' s so-called price deflator , a measure of inflation throughout the economy . That index rose at an annual rate of 2.6 % in the quarter , higher than expected and the biggest gain since 1993 ' s first_quarter . The deflator number reinforced the idea that the Federal_Reserve_Board will feel compelled to raise short-term interest_rates further to fight inflation , analysts said . The Fed has already boosted short rates from 3 % to 3.75 % this year , in turn pushing longer-term yields_up sharply . &quot; In Treasuries , the trend is clear in most people ' s mind . We ' re going to see higher rates , &quot; said Reid Smith , a bond fund manager for Vanguard Group . The renewed selloff in long-term Treasury_bonds spilled into other bond markets Thursday , driving yields_up on mortgage-backed_securities , municipal issues and other fixed-income securities . &quot; There ' s so_much negative feeling in the market . . . that they ( investors ) just don ' t want to commit money , &quot; said Mark Romano , who manages $ 500 million at First Interstate Capital Management . News of dismal demand at the Treasury ' s sale of five-year notes Thursday also depressed investors . The Treasury sold $ 11 billion in five-year notes at a top yield of 6.60 % . That was higher than the 6.56 % many market participants had expected . Demonstrating the weak demand for the notes , the bid-to-cover ratio -- the number of bids received to those accepted -- was 2.13 to 1 , compared to an average of 2.70 in the last 20 such auctions . Bond experts fear that the latest negative turn of sentiment in the market will drive more small investors out of bond mutual_funds , whose share prices have been falling as older , fixed-rate bonds are devalued by higher market rates . Many bond fund shares have already lost 5 % to 10 % of their value so far this year . In March , bond fund investors pulled a net $ 7.7 billion out of the funds . Meanwhile , in the stock_market , the reaction to surging yields was surprisingly muted . Losers topped winners by 13 to 9 on the New York Stock_Exchange , but most stock indexes suffered smaller losses than the Dow , and some even rose . The Russell 2 # 000 index of smaller stocks , for example , edged_up 0.36 point to 251.31. But many traders believe stocks will be unable to continue their recent rebound without help in the form of stable interest_rates . Among stocks ' highlights : * Many financial issues lost ground as interest_rates jumped . Morgan Stanley dropped 1 7 / 8 to 61 , Citicorp fell 5 / 8 to 36 3 / 4 , NationsBank sank 7 / 8 to 51 1 / 4 and American International Group slid 2 7 / 8 to 86 . * Some industrial issues were also pressured . Caterpillar dropped 1 3 / 4 to 108 7 / 8 , Deere shed 1 3 / 8 to 77 1 / 2 , Alcoa lost 7 / 8 to 67 7 / 8 and Bearings lost 3 / 4 to 33 . * Another fall_in oil prices weighed_on energy stocks . Crude_oil futures on the New York Merc dropped 34 cents to $ 16.57 a barrel . Among oil giants , Chevron tumbled 2 1 / 4 to 88 5 / 8 , Mobil dropped 2 1 / 4 to 77 3 / 8 and Amoco was off 1 to 55 3 / 4 . * On the plus side , some airline stocks were stronger after Delta said it will eliminate up_to 20 % of its work_force . Delta gained 1 7 / 8 to 45 1 / 4 and USAir rose 5 / 8 to 7 1 / 4 . * SciClone Pharmaceuticals and Alpha 1 Biomedical shares lost about two-thirds of their value after their hepatitis drug failed to perform better than a placebo in clinical tests . SciClone shares closed_down 7 9 / 16 to 5 3 / 16 . Alpha fell 4 13 / 16 to 2 . Overseas , London ' s FTSE-100 index fell 20.1 points to 3 # 129.9 ; Frankfurt ' s DAX index eased 2.35 points to 2 # 251.22. Tokyo ' s Nikkei index was off 3.90 points at 19 # 725.25 , while Mexico ' s Bolsa index lost 11.55 points to 2 # 321.33. * MIXED SIGNALS : The recovery cooled but prices rose unexpectedly in the first_quarter .
