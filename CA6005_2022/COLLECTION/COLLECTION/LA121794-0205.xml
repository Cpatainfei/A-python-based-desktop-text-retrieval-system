   <HEADLINE> IT ' S BACK TO POLLS AT CSUN ; REFERENDUM : STUDENTS WILL GET THIRD CHANCE TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR MATADOR ATHLETICS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Third time a charm , perhaps ? After two losses at the student polls , Cal State Northridge will stage another fee referendum next spring , with money again earmarked for the school ' s debt-ridden athletic department . In a meeting of school athletic administrators and coaches on Friday , Northridge President Blenda J . Wilson threw her support behind a referendum to be held_in March , which will mark the third attempt in the past year to underwrite athletics with increased student fees . Wilson also told the group that she is still reviewing a list of athletic funding scenarios and plans to issue to the public by early next week a short_list of options . All of the scenarios involve budget or program cuts , Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said . The school ' s oft-controversial NCAA Division I-AA football_team , which had a budget of $ 500 # 000 in 1994 , remains under consider for elimination , Hiegert said . Northridge is facing a budget_deficit of approximately $ 700 # 000 next year . After soliciting feedback on the funding proposals , Wilson is expected to select one of the scenarios by mid-January , Hiegert said . &quot; If it comes_to that , we need to give the affected student-athletes time ( to find another college at which to play ) , &quot; Hiegert said . The referendum will be presented during the Associated Students election March 8-9 , Hiegert said . Athletic referendums were shot down twice by student vote_in 1994 . Athletics -- hampered by declining enrollment , damage associated with the January earthquake and a sluggish economy -- must find a new way to skin the same cat . This time , Hiegert said , plans call_for the measure to be presented to students in a detailed either / or format . In past elections , no athletic programs were specifically targeted for elimination if the referendum was voted_down . The end result next spring , should the referendum again fail , will be painfully clear . &quot; Students will know exactly what is going_to happen , &quot; Hiegert said . &quot; It will be along the lines of , ' Here ' s the programs we ' ll have if it passes and here ' s what you ' ll have if it doesn ' t. ' &quot; In October , a referendum that would have hiked student fees $ 49 per semester was narrowly defeated in the largest election turnout in school history . The fee would have generated $ 2.25 million annually for athletics based on current enrollment levels . A similar proposal was defeated last spring . Hiegert said it has not been determined what level of funding will be sought from students on the third referendum attempt . The Cal State University system , of which Northridge is a member , also is facing a possible 10 % fee hike next year , driving registration costs to more_than $ 1 # 000 per semester . Nonetheless , the notion of Referendum III was well-received by coaches . &quot; I was in favor of another referendum a day after the last one failed , &quot; said Pete Cassidy , the men ' s basketball_coach . &quot; A school of 25 # 000 in a community of millions should have a major athletic program and students should recognize the value of it. &quot; Wilson also assured the group that despite looming departmental cuts , the school will remain a member of Division I , where it has competed for the past five years . Said Wilson in a release through a school spokesman : &quot; We are committed to offering a quality NCAA Division I program at whatever funding level we can sustain. &quot; Northridge coaches have complained that the threat of dropping to Division II , however remote it may have been , has negatively affected their ability to recruit . &quot; It is a relief , &quot; Hiegert said . &quot; We ' re glad it ' s been put to bed . ( Rival coaches ) were using that in a recruiting situation. &quot; &quot; It ' s major news , &quot; said Don Strametz , the track and cross-country coach . &quot; We can move forward . Everybody has lost recruits over the past couple of weeks because of this ( uncertainty ) . &quot;</TEXT>
