   <HEADLINE> EAST_SIDE , WEST_SIDE ; THE TUG OF WAR BETWEEN L.A. ' S RIVAL REALITIES IS POLARIZING THE CITY . BUT SOME ANGELENOS ARE BREAKING_DOWN THE BARRIERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ocean air cools the packed bodies at Santa Monica ' s Electronic Cafe as a bash for the elite of the information highway picks_up steam . Crisp computer types and mellow virtual realists exchange techno-greetings : &quot; Hi . Military simulations ? &quot; &quot; Of course , SAG. &quot; The cafe , a high-tech playground jammed with interactive-media equipment that can link up with Europe or South_America , has drawn a highly educated , mostly white crowd this night . Lofty issues float off lips . The mood is bold . The talk is of changing the very nature of business , of crossing social barriers via computers , of making big bucks . The night is very Westside . At that hour , across town in East Los Angeles , a football game winds down , the eternal grudge match between Roosevelt and Garfield high_schools . Husbands who graduated Garfield sit on opposite bleachers from wives who graduated Roosevelt , and nobody finds that funny . The mood is proud . The stadium , crammed with 22 # 000 Latinos , hardly any blacks or whites , is a roaring sea . Two girls climb a railing , giggling when school police scold them . There is a palpable sense of community , of old rivals gruffly acknowledging the existence of the other . When the game ends , 90 young_men shake hands and strut off the field . The scene is very Eastside . Most Angelenos don ' t know about the big_game , especially Westsiders . When someone at the cafe says she ' s leaving to catch the final quarter , having heard about the game on TV , people stare as if she ' s just announced she ' s off to Beirut . Then it happens . The Westside vs . Eastside thing . A man speaks_up : &quot; Are you sure that ' s safe to do ? Isn ' t it awfully late ? &quot; One guest manages a concerned chin_up ! expression . &quot; Be careful ! &quot; It ' s not late on the Westside , of course . But isn ' t it deeply , darkly late in East L.A ? It is a critical measure of Los Angeles ' dual reality that Santa Monica and East Los Angeles are four seconds apart by modem and only minutes by car , yet they are often separated by a psychological span of light_years . Los Angeles is divided in a host of ways -- by race , income , attitude . And one of those fundamental splits is geographical . L.A. is in many ways two different cities , the Westside and everything else : that vague inland reality that has no handy nickname , beginning where the Westside trails off and stretching to the slopes of the San Gabriels . Though Angelenos can ' t seem to agree just where the border between West and East lies_in a city changing as rapidly as ours , there is still a sense , deeply embedded in our psychology , that there is another side of town whose freeway exits we do not know and whose lifestyles we do not share . Exploring this idea in barrooms and boardrooms across the city , one hears a cacophony of voices -- some amusing , some passionate , many revelatory . The east and west often hold each other in contempt , with Eastsiders dumping on the &quot; white_bread &quot; Westside , and Westsiders clucking that the rest of the town has gone_to hell . And everybody gets_into the act , from powerbrokers to housekeepers . Influential market researcher and Westsider Richard Maullin insists there &quot; is no East-West to Los Angeles , &quot; but when asked why Eastsiders blubber on so about the Westside , retorts , &quot; It ' s self-hatred . They are saying , ' I would like to be like people on the Westside and because I know that I am not , I hate you. ' &quot; Silver Lake resident Mike Roos , president of the education reform group LEARN and a man who usually acts_as an unofficial ambassador for the two sides of town , likens Westsiders to a bunch of sheep who in the 1980s &quot; bought piece-of-s- - - little boxes for $ 600 # 000 . They could have had palaces in Burbank , but they want to receive and express the acknowledgment : I live_on the Westside. &quot; Each side relishes its myths about the other . Eastsiders love to howl that Westsiders are a bunch of phonies . Malcolm Boyd , the prolific author , Episcopal priest and Silver Lake resident , recalls his favorite Westside moment : &quot; I was at -- Mortons ? -- and I heard someone at another table say , ' Steven Spielberg is reading my script today by the pool. ' And of course it was total bulls- - - ! The point is , the gods and goddesses are said to be closer to the earth on the Westside , but they ' re not. &quot; Earthy Eastside gays , like Boyd , live_in the bohemian pockets east of Vermont and call the glitzy Westside gays , who live_in upscale West Hollywood , &quot; WE-HOs , &quot; with the emphasis on &quot; HO. &quot; County Supervisor Gloria Molina , according to one longtime fund raiser , balks at attending meetings in Hancock Park because it ' s just &quot; too far West. &quot; And despite Pasadena ' s location beyond the historic Eastside , some Pasadenans see themselves as arbiters of a new Eastside consciousness , directly competing with the Westside . Pasadena Mayor Rick Cole brags that Pasadena yuppies spend their money on &quot; more meaningful things &quot; than Brentwood yuppies . The Westside , meanwhile , often regards the Eastside with subdued horror . If the Westside is the American_Dream , then the Eastside is its nightmare . Some wealthy Bel-Air residents grandly point_out that they &quot; never go east of Doheny , &quot; while the less timorous probe as far inland as La Cienega , La Brea , even Vermont . One Westside arts leader confides that spending $ 214 million on the Downtown Library renovation &quot; was a complete waste &quot; because Westsiders will never use it . Westsiders are particularly mystified that Eastsiders manage to stagger past the age of 50 , given the smog they suck_in . &quot; You can ' t really breathe that crap , can you ? &quot; asks Stephen Yagman , the flamboyant Venice attorney who handles police brutality cases . Yagman remains so cocooned on the beach that , he concedes , &quot; I know 200 people pretty well in Venice , and about 20 in the entire rest of Los Angeles. &quot; TV weathermen ( Westsiders , no doubt ) hardly ever mention airborne carcinogens like benzene , cadmium and ethylene that strike people in Beverly Hills and Westwood just as often as they do_in City Terrace and Glendale . Invisible carbon_monoxide blankets the South Bay more_than Burbank , but who hears about it ? It ' s all part of the east-west mythology . The Eastside is a place where laundry hangs_out for all to see , while the Westside is about appearances . If one can ' t see the smog , one can justify spending $ 350 # 000 for an aging rambler in Rancho Park ( comfortably west of La Cienega ) without so_much as a pool . Each side has its point . According to AQMD officials , daily ozone levels on the Eastside exceed federal health standards twice as often as on the Westside . Eastsiders often litter as if their streets were one giant trash_can , dumping sofas and hurling hamburger wrappers at a rate that city street_sweepers simply cannot match . And there are more status victims on the Westside , where one in 100 people has had plastic_surgery and nearly one in 58 who bought a new car in 1993 found it necessary to pay more_than $ 35 # 000 for it . Dennis Macheski , Price Waterhouse real_estate research_director , has authored a study of Los Angeles , the latest of many that confirm , he says , &quot; that Los Angeles really is a ' Tale of Two Cities. ' &quot; Using Mulholland Drive and the Pomona Freeway as a diagonal northern border , the study found that the poorest and least educated metro area on the entire West Coast is the region east of the Harbor Freeway . Meanwhile , one of the richest and best educated areas of the West Coast is west of the Harbor Freeway , where nearly one in five households earns more_than $ 75 # 000 a year . Los Angeles Times marketing data , roughly using La Brea Avenue as the division ( see chart below ) shows that about twice as_many Westies as Easties have a stockbroker and a gold or platinum credit_card . At the same time , one in three people living east of La Brea has no health_insurance , compared to one in nine on the Westside -- a stark reminder that for much of the city ' s working class , the economic barriers in Los Angeles are as durable as a steel-toed shoe . LOST IN ALL THE SNIPING BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES , GOOD-NATURED AND otherwise , are some important facts . The truth is that the Westside is far more diverse than many believe . Santa Monica ' s median income is $ 37 # 000 , the same as Mid-Wilshire and Silver Lake . Palms , Mar Vista , Venice and large sections of Santa Monica are all more_than 20 % Latino . Asian Americans make_up more_than 10 % of the area stretching from Mar Vista to Sunset Boulevard along the 405 freeway . By the same token , a study of the U.S. Census by Cal State Northridge shows that the least diverse region in Los Angeles is not the Westside , but the Eastside ' s homogeneous Latino settlement that sprawls across 50 square_miles from El Sereno to South Gate . On the other hand , crime , which some Westsiders imagine is turning the city to rubble somewhere beyond the La Brea Tar_Pits , is in fact not much more prevalent in Eastside communities . With the exception of the Central region , which , like most big-city downtowns , suffers exceptionally high crime , the broad eastern section of Los Angeles is no more crime-ridden than the Westside . For the first 10 months of 1993 , unincorporated East Los Angeles and the area served by the LAPD ' s Hollenbeck station ( Chinatown , El Sereno , Monterey Hills , Boyle Heights ) had virtually identical robbery rates to Santa Monica and LAPD ' s West L.A. area ( Pacific Palisades , Brentwood , Westwood , Bel-Air , Rancho Park ) . Santa Monica and the LAPD ' s Pacific area ( Westchester , Playa del Rey , Venice , Mar Vista , Palms ) suffered more rapes -- . 5 per 1 # 000 residents -- than East Los Angeles with . 25 per 1 # 000 . Auto theft was mixed : worst in Santa Monica and the LAPD ' s Pacific and Hollywood areas and markedly less prevalent in East Los Angeles and the Hollenbeck and West L.A. divisions . The homicide rate was high for the Rampart area ( Westlake , Koreatown , parts of Echo Park ) , with . 4 per 1 # 000 , but was far lower -- . 2 per 1 # 000 -- for East Los Angeles and Hollywood . But tell all that to Westsiders , and frankly , many don ' t believe it . Litter-strewn , graffiti-marked , chain-link-fenced , window-barred sections of Boyle Heights , Maywood , Hollywood and Echo Park look just awful , thus they must be awful . For all_the Westside ' s posing , appearances do matter in Los Angeles more and more . Graffiti , largely a Latino youth phenomenon , has cordoned off much of the Eastside with visual barriers that turn_back traffic and commerce as abruptly as a border_patrol . Or , as hothead economist Joel Kotkin puts it , &quot; How ' bout the death_penalty for taggers ? Schmucks will say I ' m racist to criticize , but do you really think Latinos , blacks and Asians like graffiti ? It ' s a sign to the aspiring middle_class that your neighborhood is s- - - . It ' s the taggers and the whining PCers who support them who provide the reason the middle_class leaves Los Angeles , and this destroys the very basis of the economy that immigrants and others can rise upon . Think_of Detroit . There is no neat , clean Westside in Detroit . Oh boy , let ' s copy Detroit , you know what I mean ? &quot; Truly sophisticated Eastsiders don ' t argue with the Westside ' s aversion to Eastside funkiness . Pasadena ' s Mayor Cole , asked the key ingredient to his city ' s financial success as an inland hub even as its immigrant population booms , says , &quot; Keeping it very clean. &quot; Barrio Planners president Frank Villalobos , explaining the secret to his award-winning revitalization projects like the Whittier Boulevard redesign in East Los Angeles , says , &quot; maintenance contracts keep everything attractive and clean. &quot; Truly sophisticated Westsiders , on the other hand , don ' t create absurd borders over which they cannot cross . Father Bud Kieser , a Paulist priest and Hollywood TV and movie producer , preaches an early-morning Mass to a rich Westwood parish and a late-morning Mass to a low-income mid-city parish . He has found that crossing the city ' s borders , especially dealing with the poor , has enriched his understanding of his fellow Angelenos and himself . &quot; If you look_at the faces in my ( mid-city ) church , you see the struggling , the real problems of jobs , of children , of facing retirement or fearing the loud family who ' ve moved_in next door . But on the Westside , you see the problem is almost too_much freedom . They have the money to do anything , and they lose themselves ; they lose their center. &quot; West and East could both learn a great_deal , and enjoy their city much more , if they ' d make an effort to go &quot; bi-coastal. &quot; Pity the poor Eastsider who ' s never dined on lox and eggs at Nate ' n Al ' s in Beverly Hills ( it ' s only $ 7 ) or slogged through fern glades to peek at Malibu ' s well-kept-secret waterfalls . Pity the poor Westsider who ' s never been to St . Vincent de Paul in Lincoln Heights , one of the great thrift stores in California . Most Westsiders know_nothing of buying tomatoes for 29 cents a pound at Downtown ' s Grand Central Market or renting a boat to watch the lotuses bloom on Echo Park Lake . FOR ALL THESE DIVISIONS OF LIFE AND LEISURE , IT ' S NOT CLEAR WHERE the Eastside ends and the Westside begins . The old psychological and physical border to the Eastside was the Los Angeles River . In the 1700s and 1800s , the Spanish settled many historic ranchos all_over Southern California . Beginning in the late 1800s , Latinos moved_in great waves from Mexico to areas east of the river , transforming largely Jewish Boyle Heights into one of the city ' s first barrios . Sixth-generation Mexican Americans can still be found there today . But the river is no longer the boundary , as Latino immigration tramples the old borders . Meanwhile , the Westside , as defined by Pacific Bell , the Air Quality Management District , Los Angeles Times Poll and the Los Angeles Police_Department , roughly begins at La Cienega Boulevard . But given the cachet of such Westside-esque phenomena as Michel Richard ' s glamorous Citrus restaurant and trendy Diamond Foam &amp; Fabric -- both good bets for spotting movie_stars -- La Brea Avenue seems to be the new demarcation zone . Nancy Silverton , co-owner , with her husband , Mark Peel , of hip Campanile restaurant , chose La Brea six years ago because it wasn ' t on the Westside , and she wanted something &quot; more diverse and eclectic. &quot; But now , with New York designer Anna Sui ( sort of Addams Family retro wear ) just up the block , and chichi gallery owners breathing down Campanile ' s neck on Beverly Boulevard , the Westside has encircled Silverton and Peel . They are philosophical about the transformation . Peel notes , with a hint of pride , that nearby stores &quot; are not chains or quick investments like what has happened to Melrose but are individual efforts that create a sense of permanence and commitment. &quot; If one draws an imaginary line_up La Brea , through the Hollywood Hills , curving west at the Ventura Freeway to follow the coastline , one finds that Encino , Studio City and Sherman Oaks , so-called &quot; Valley &quot; communities , are , in attitude , spirit and proximity , on the Westside . They are far more linked to Beverly Hills and Brentwood today than they are to such rumpled cousins as Van Nuys or North Hollywood . Some realtors , who Roos and others believe play a divisive role in parceling up the city , shriek happily if a home is &quot; south of Ventura. &quot; Historian Kevin Starr says cities can ' t help but develop &quot; sides. &quot; The Upper East_Side in New York , the South_Side of Chicago , undersides everywhere . L.A. started to evolve into an east-west city , he maintains , in the early 1900s , after the Wilshire brothers envisioned a westward push along the ancient path that once linked the Indian village of Yang Na , on the Los Angeles River , to the coast . Developer A.W. Ross bought_up huge parcels of the Wilshire brothers ' holdings and realized their dream , finally completing the boulevard ' s trek to the sea in 1934 . Los Angeles marched westward . Sheep-grazing land gave_rise to what is now the Regent Beverly Wilshire hotel in 1926 and Bullock ' s Wilshire in 1929 . In dusty bean fields , the State of California opened UCLA in 1929 . &quot; Suddenly , &quot; says Starr , &quot; automobiles allowed the beautiful people to zip out_to their newly built Santa Monica beach cottages . And after World_War_II , Westchester and huge tracts were built , something like 9 # 000 homes_in one year . Voila ! You had the Westside. &quot; Starr and other urban thinkers have a more complex view of the divisions within the city , describing L.A. as a series of mega-villages scattered over a vast terrain whose residents will trade -- and bicker -- among themselves much like those in old European city_states . Pride and competition are always in_play in big cities . Writing in his 1941 novel &quot; Mildred Pierce , &quot; hard-boiled author James M . Cain gave an early nod to this view when Mildred ' s snobbish Pasadena boyfriend told her she ' d make a fine wife &quot; if you didn ' t live_in Glendale. &quot; Many Angelenos are learning to sample from the stew . Gai Gherardi , co-owner of Melrose Avenue ' s L.A. Eyeworks , knows a traditional Iranian family who &quot; watched 2 # 500 drag queens &quot; in West Hollywood ' s Halloween Parade and , to her delight , loved it . In Echo Park , performance artist Eric Trules sets a tape_recorder on his windowsill to capture his white , black , Asian and Latino neighbors &quot; screaming in the middle of the night , in the most colorful language imaginable &quot; -- dialogue he hopes to weave into a book . But others , like Michael Nava , a mystery writer and senior attorney with the State Court of Appeal , marvel that the city is not &quot; in a constant state of civil unrest. &quot; Nava grew_up in a struggling , working-class family and says he feels a powerful kinship &quot; when I see a brown face , &quot; yet he chose to live_on the Westside , because , he says , &quot; life is a lot easier there . I know firsthand there ' s no romance in poverty. &quot; He says his dual experience , particularly his several years on the Westside , has convinced him that Los Angeles is a city deeply hewn by class and race . &quot; Westsiders know their affluence is paid_for by the suffering of other people , and there is a deep sense of guilt and apprehension. &quot; Echoing some Latinos , Nava dreams of a Los Angeles dominated by Latino culture and Latino leaders . &quot; The future , &quot; he says , &quot; is Gloria Molina ' s. &quot; But economist Kotkin , a resident of Laurel Canyon , sees a dreary future down that path . &quot; If the Westside and the Valley don ' t maintain themselves , L.A. will become the dream of ( KCET commentator ) Ruben Martinez and L.A. school_board member Leticia Quezada , who want a huge Mexico_City North , a dream I don ' t share. &quot; The real issue is not east versus west , &quot; it ' s whether people stay or head to the wine country. &quot; Angelenos finally seem to grasp that L.A. has become the new Ellis Island and that whole sectors of the city may still change . Monterey Park , just east of Downtown , was transformed after one Chinese American realtor bought tiny ads in mainland_China newspapers in the 1970s promoting &quot; the Chinese Beverly Hills. &quot; In truth , the city ' s Asians were Japanese Americans , but the dream was sold and a town that had defended its white identity in the 1950s by barring Latinos from buying homes was utterly remade by capitalist sleight-of-hand . In Glendale , leaders in the 1980s encouraged developers to raze whole blocks of attractive homes to build thousands of luxury apartments . Intended for yuppies , the units instead drew tens of thousands of mainly working-class renters who changed the ethnic face of what had been an overwhelmingly white city . Glendale is now about 20 % Latino and 70 % white , including a large contingent of Armenian immigrants . Drastic change creates bitterness . African Americans clash with their new neighbors as South-Central continues its unstoppable shift from black to Latino . Black flight created an outrush of 57 # 000 black Angelenos from the urban core during the 1980s , a migration to L.A. suburbs and distant states that continues . Maullin has found deep resentment in the most diverse neighborhoods . In one Eastside area with equal numbers of white , Latino and Asian residents , he says , &quot; If you get them in a room together , basically a focus group , it ' s all blah , blah , how wonderful it is . But when you get them alone , it ' s the goddamn whites this and the goddamn Mexicans that and the goddamn Asians this . There is a veneer of civility that keeps us from being Bosnia . What I am seeing is not prejudice , however . It is a powerful desire to group with your culture , and we should all wake_up to that reality. &quot; PERHAPS MORE THAN OTHER PARTS OF TOWN , THE WESTSIDE WATCHES the cycle of change with trepidation . Venice has become a bizarre melange of gang shootings , artist hangouts and award-winning custom homes . The once-tony Westwood shopping district is in a financial tailspin , abandoned by upscale shoppers after being discovered by inner-city teen-agers and overwhelmed by cheap , cutesy stores . But while much of the Westside sits precariously upon a ribbon of earth that geologists say will liquefy when the Really Big One hits , it doesn ' t seem in danger of disappearing anytime soon . Morgan Chu , a hotshot litigator at the Irell &amp; Manella law_firm in Century City , gazes at the lush Central Park-like view of the Los Angeles Country_Club from his law library and wonders how anyone can fault the Westside . He and several other men have met at Palisades High_School for pickup basketball every Saturday for more_than 16 years , forming a community so close that some fly in from Sacramento or drive from Palmdale . He says this Westside group is Asian American , African American , white and Latino , including &quot; an airline pilot , attorneys , business owners , a plumber , a_couple_of guys in construction , and , of course , the guy who keeps a slim jim ( a car break-in device ) in his beat-up car . &quot; I call this an urban oasis , &quot; Chu says . &quot; I can pick_up my wife in Beverlywood , and in 10 minutes we can be at one of 150 restaurants . On a sunny day , I ' ll sneak_out with other ' bandits ' to play golf . We start the conspiracy the day before , stash our clubs in our cars and make reservations at a public course , for nothing , like $ 10 . For that kind of lifestyle , I don ' t think there ' s a much better place to be. &quot; In much the same way , Larkin Arnold , a leading entertainment attorney who discovered Luther Vandross , has found in Bel-Air &quot; one of the best places in the world , like entering a forest when you drive through its gates. &quot; Arnold describes the two perfect moments in his daily life : soaking_up the serenity of his acre and a half of privacy ( Tom Jones lives next door , but Arnold knows that only because he has heard him singing ) or wheeling along the Malibu coastline in his black two-seater convertible . He and his wife , the first African American to serve on the board of directors of the Bel-Air Assn. , a homeowners club , enjoy the kind of global mobility that takes them from Beverly Hills to Paris to the Crenshaw district in a blink , from Wolfgang Puck ' s Chinois on Main restaurant in Santa Monica to down-home Harold &amp; Belle ' s catfish restaurant on Jefferson Boulevard to yuppie / buppie Georgia on Melrose , in which they are investors . &quot; I can compare it against New York , D.C. , Paris or any other city and still say the Westside is the best for weather , air , restaurants , hospitals , schools , creative people , the architecture of homes , &quot; Arnold says . &quot; I feel blessed God has enabled me to enjoy these things. &quot; Yet in a strange way , the Westside ' s rich and upper-middle classes are among the city ' s most isolated . Walking briskly on her exercise route below Montana Avenue , Elisa Lottor says she rarely ventures beyond Sepulveda Boulevard . &quot; You can get hurt , you can get robbed , you can get your car stolen , &quot; says the nutritionist and homeopath , padding along in Avias , eyes surreptitiously monitoring a loud group of homeless men drinking nearby . &quot; My friend in Silver Lake is always saying , ' Why don ' t you come_over ? ' and I ' d like to , because it sounds really interesting . But just to get_on the rotten freeway and then have to exit and deal with crazy drivers and street criminals , it ' s not worth it. &quot; Lottor is a gentle woman , a vegetarian who makes organic-turkey-and-brown-rice burgers for her cat . She and her husband bought north of Montana 20 years ago for $ 53 # 000 . But they ' re on the verge of leaving it all and moving to rural hills near Santa Barbara because they believe their world in Santa Monica has become a crowded foxhole . &quot; Every time we go_to Torrance to the Del Amo mall , my husband sees women with big asses and says , ' See that ? This is how normal women look. ' Nobody looks normal in Santa Monica anymore. &quot; Lottor steps into a crosswalk , and a car cuts her off . &quot; See what I mean ? That guy ' s got a Range Rover , so he ' s entitled . We ' re surrounded by so many materialistic people . You see them dragging their maids around , ordering them to do this and do that . I ' ll be at Zen Bakery , and some obnoxious guy will get_on his cell phone . And you see parents spoiling children in disgusting ways , breaking them in at Starbucks ( coffee emporium ) . You know , 8 years old and the parents are asking , ' Would you like to try a latte ? ' &quot; Joan Huber and her husband found a &quot; beautiful little community in a big city &quot; when they moved to Santa Monica nearly 30 years ago , and while their town has been altered by urban troubles , the Hubers believe_in &quot; creating a neighborhood no matter what goes_on around us. &quot; Managers of several apartment complexes , the Hubers say that if one neighbor gets sick , &quot; the others all take turns going grocery shopping , taking_out the garbage , doing the laundry. &quot; Huber had a stroke last year and , during a power outage , tried to make her way with a cane past the complex ' s pool to help guide tenants into their darkened parking_spaces . &quot; I was worried about falling_into the pool , and suddenly I saw all these young_men helping people get_up the stairs and handling the parking problem , and one of them looked over and said , ' You didn ' t really think we ' d let you down , did you ? ' It almost made me cry. &quot; Maullin says Westsiders who ' ve lived_in Los Angeles 10 years or more suffer &quot; a mass nostalgia for a place that was lower_density , less traffic and away from it all . From 1975 to 1990 , you saw tremendous commercial development of Century City and Wilshire , which didn ' t have a high-rise before 1970 . People are still in denial that they live_in an urban core. &quot; It ' s hard to imagine being anywhere near an urban core at author Amy Ephron ' s airy Pacific Palisades home . It ' s so quiet that the ear strains to focus_on far-off sounds -- an undulating hum , perhaps the ocean or a distant freeway . Some yards out here are really private parks , tended by gardeners , appointed with huge patios , koi ponds or pools . One can ' t see the wealth inside , but one senses it at curbside . Two garbage_cans on trash day is modest . Four is living right . Ephron and her husband , TV producer Sasha Harari , moved from Malibu after the fires , their second near-disaster . She remembers grabbing &quot; two Armani suits , two pairs of jeans , some T-shirts and the Warhols. &quot; Raised in Beverly Hills , Ephron seems to have worked past the nostalgia and accepted Los Angeles on its current terms . She goes_to museums in Pasadena and events Downtown . But despite her mobility , she never goes_to ATMs at night , parks only with a valet and never enters a 7-Eleven store . She has instructed her children , ages 9 , 7 and 4 , what to do if they are ever playing and someone brings_out a gun ( tell them to put it down and immediately go home. ) &quot; I do not think it is an elitist solution to pay $ 3 to park , &quot; Ephron says . &quot; I lived_in New York for a while , and I ' ve got my old New York walk back : chin_up and don ' t f- - - with me . I love L.A. , and I do not want to decry what it has become , so I live defensively. &quot; When she was growing_up , &quot; Beverly Hills was a tiny village , provincial with almost no chain_stores . There was the tobacco_shop , the knife man . We had a great toy store , Uncle Bernie ' s , with a lemonade tree that gave fresh lemonade free_of charge from a rubber tree with spigots. &quot; Today , people in Ephron ' s Beverly Hills office_building &quot; actually sit in their little_offices with the doors locked. &quot; One can feel her muted sense of loss . Ephron shakes her head . The moment passes . &quot; Psychologically , &quot; she says , the days of old Beverly Hills were &quot; a long , long_time ago. &quot; ALBERT EINSTEIN , REINCARNATED and living_in Los Angeles , would be an Eastsider . Aside from physics , Einstein wrote in &quot; Out of My Later Years &quot; of the sin of wealth , saying that the successful man &quot; receives a great_deal from his fellowmen , usually incomparably more_than corresponds to his service to them. &quot; Which sums_up how many Eastsiders feel about the Westside . Eric Trules of Echo Park wrote a poem to express his many regrets at having spent 10 years &quot; imprisoned &quot; in Santa Monica , emotionally unable to give_up his $ 422-a-month rent-controlled apartment . &quot; I saw myself just drying_up in my tiny apartment , getting old and sad , &quot; he says . &quot; Ten years . &quot; The performance artist has since discovered that women on the Eastside -- unlike women on the Westside , he says -- don ' t care that he doesn ' t earn big bucks . His love life , &quot; the worst &quot; for 10 years , has suddenly taken_off . &quot; When I moved inland , the winds shifted , &quot; he says dreamily , gazing over his smoggy view of the city toward the sea . &quot; I feel_like I ' ve gone_back to an earlier time where things are fertile and breeding and plants are growing and bougainvillea is blossoming. &quot; He cautions that the Eastside , where he is actually paying a higher rent , is not for everybody . &quot; We hear gunshots and salsa music , alarms go_off , and vicious dogs . It ' s interesting and peaceful and exciting and helicopters all at once . I tell people I live_in Echo Park , and they say , ' I ' ve heard of moving east to west but never the other way. ' And I tell them : ' It doesn ' t make me feel as small. ' &quot; Boyd , the 70-year-old Episcopal priest , chats over wine with his companion , Mark Thompson , 41 , an editor of the Advocate magazine , about why they chose an Eastside garden bungalow over the Westside . &quot; Here in Silver Lake , it isn ' t important whether you wrote a book or not , &quot; says Boyd , whose new book , &quot; Rich with Years , &quot; just hit the stands . &quot; Clothes here are very easy . Clothes there are not . There , it ' s very code , and there ' s a deep awareness of what ' s hip and what ' s not . Fame is almost a joke here . It ' s an irony . If you had it , you never made_a_point of it . We have very close friends in West Hollywood who we relate to very closely and care very much about . Yet they are seeking something there , and I am not sure what it is. &quot; Thompson interrupts : &quot; I think it ' s called youth , darling. &quot; Artists are also drawn east , to places like Mt . Washington , Highland Park and Atwater Village , because they need cheap space . Internationally acclaimed artist Lari Pittman , whose works go_for $ 5 # 000 to $ 35 # 000 , and who just sold a 14-footer to the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York , lives on a dead-end_street next to Dodger Stadium and keeps his studio at the Victor Clothing Co . building on lively Broadway in the heart of Downtown . &quot; I ' ve had calls from people saying , ' I ' m sorry I ' m late . I ' m on 3rd and Broadway in Santa Monica and I can ' t find you , ' &quot; Pittman says . &quot; But anyone who really knows the art scene knows there is a whole generation of artists living east of La Brea . On the Westside , this studio would cost $ 10 # 000 a month . But that ' s not the only reason I ' m here. &quot; Says Pittman of Angelenos who avoid inland parts of town : &quot; Maybe it ' s time for people to grow_up a little . Look_at all_of Manhattan . It looks worse than it is , but Manhattanites understand that about their city , and they don ' t become paralyzed by it. &quot; that ' s the psychological hurdle that Westsider Margrit Polak had to overcome when she fell_in_love with Eastsider Harvey Shield . Harvey , a songwriter and doo-wop singer with the Mighty Echoes , was uncertain how to persuade Margrit , a personal manager and acting coach , to abandon her condo above Rustic Canyon in Santa Monica for his flat near Downtown , site of a turn-of-the-century tuberculosis hospital . As if to weaken Margrit by drowning her in urban angst , on their first official date Harvey took her to the Skid_Row home of friends in the tattered penthouse of the Alexandria Hotel . Margrit , a New Yorker and a bohemian by nature , &quot; was impressed. &quot; Harvey says Margrit was &quot; amazed that I didn ' t lock my doors. &quot; Margrit ' s first thought upon moving_in with Harvey was , &quot; How quick could I get a security_system installed ? &quot; Today Harvey and Margrit are contented Eastsiders . They are renovating a massive Victorian home_in Angelino Heights three miles from Downtown , and they are consciously creating a multicultural upbringing for their daughter , Sofia , who made them proud with her first three words : &quot; Duke of Earl. &quot; Margrit gushes to her Westside friends about the Craftsman and Victorian manses that go_for as little as $ 200 # 000 . Unlike the Westside , she has found a warm neighborhood life . &quot; We all know each other in these three square_blocks , &quot; she says , &quot; and you can ' t say that about anywhere else in L.A. , can you ? &quot; You can say it about many places in Los Angeles , including East Los Angeles , where Latinas rose_up to stop a prison some years ago . The Mothers of E.L.A. still meet regularly , pursuing a dream to bring a school to the proposed prison site to train a new generation to design , build and repair the light rails , subways and electric_cars of the future . Barrio Planners ' Villalobos , who lives_in East Los Angeles , says that while Latinos are winning such battles more often now , flexing their muscle as homeowners and residents , they still ask , metaphorically , &quot; Can we afford to cross the Los Angeles River ? &quot; &quot; My kids go_to Malaga Cove in Palos Verdes , &quot; says Villalobos , &quot; and they ' re seen as infringing on the white kids ' territory . They don ' t look Arab , which is acceptable ; they look Mexican . But they are adaptable . They know how to go from east to west. &quot; Villalobos , who named his company Barrio Planners as a joke back in the 1970s when he and his buddies were the only Latino urban planners at their college , says the Eastside needs the Westside , filled as it is with educated and monied people who can build shopping_centers and finance new corporations . Yet , he also understands , the Westside needs the Eastside , bedrock of the middle and working classes . &quot; People were crying at my mom ' s house ( in East L.A. ) about the fires in Malibu . People were crying_for Laguna Beach , and these are rich whites that these Latino working-class people were crying_for . These feelings have to be explored more , because these are the feelings that will hold the city together. &quot; PASADENA SEEMS AN ODD candidate for providing answers to the east-west conundrum , yet increasingly , people like Villalobos cite it as the new model . City_fathers have adopted a toss-out-the-rules philosophy to respond to Pasadena ' s ever-growing and changing population , now more_than half Latino , black and Asian . The trendy new Holly Village Apartments actually form a tunnel through which freight_trains run , and the gracious docents at the Gamble House are passing their art to trainees of mostly ethnic backgrounds . Dignified Vroman ' s Bookstore threw a splashy book signing for radio star Howard Stern , after West Hollywood couldn ' t be bothered . In a city of just 135 # 000 , about 1 # 200 nonprofit groups work to improve life . The once-staid community elected the extremely liberal Cole ( critics have called him a socialist ) as its leader even as the city hotly pursues the almighty dollar in classically capitalistic fashion . One result has been the revival of Old Pasadena , a smash success . At the same time , Pasadena is fraught with the troubles that dog all cities . Last Halloween , it suffered one of the worst tragedies in its history , when gang members gunned_down a group of young trick-or-treaters . Already , in the spirit of the new Pasadena , a group of mothers and fathers has formed a citywide coalition to get guns off Pasadena ' s streets . Not everything is changing . There are still more Pasadenans in the Southwest Blue_Book social registry than residents of Bel-Air , Malibu and Beverly Hills combined . And it did require a public battle to budge the Tournament of Roses to diversify its fossilized white male board of directors . But the city ' s new community_center is filled with Latino parents taking English_classes , and Pasadena ' s future is now looking more like marble swirl than vanilla . &quot; We think we ' ll make a graceful transition , so that 50 years from now the Valley Hunt_Club will be rich Chinese , Mexicans and blacks , &quot; Mayor Rick Cole says . &quot; It has been rich whites for 100 years , but there won ' t be many whites here next century , and that has to be accepted with panache . What I hope most is that the cultural and architectural institutions of Pasadena will be cherished and will survive among a group of people who look nothing like we do now . And that ' s the rub for all_of Los Angeles . It ' s diversify or die. &quot; Yet even as Angelenos try to move beyond the economic and racial barriers that bifurcate the area , a lingering disdain and distrust infuse our disputes . Many are beginning to acknowledge and challenge the borders . Others are not . But the dialogue that is east versus west may one day bring_down the boundaries that have made Los Angeles a tale of two cities . East Versus West : Nose Bobs or Budweiser ? The Westside , on this chart , is defined as ZIP_codes west of La Brea Avenue and south of Mulholland Drive . The Eastside is defined as ZIP_codes east of La Brea Avenue , ending roughly at Atlantic Boulevard in the San Gabriel Valley . 03 # 33 , 10 # 11 Westside Eastside No health_insurance 1 in 9 1 in 3 Paid_for diet program 1 in 30 1 in 67 Has stockbroker account 1 in 4 1 in 7 Has gold / platinum card 1 in 11 1 in 25 Owns home computer 1 in 2 1 in 3 Has computer modem 1 in 5 1 in 14 Drives alone to work 1 in 2 1 in 2 Takes bus to work 1 in 27 1 in 27 Takes carpool / rail to work 1 in 8 1 in 9 Commutes 1 + hours 1 in 25 1 in 50 Commutes less than 10 mins . 1 in 7 1 in 7 Has basic cable ( only ) 1 in 3 1 in 5 Has pay channels 1 in 3 1 in 4 No cable TV 1 in 3 1 in 2 Visited EuroDisney 1 in 167 1 in 1000 Visited LA Zoo 1 in 7 1 in 4 Dines out 10 + time / mo . 1 in 7 1 in 12 Never uses coupons 1 in 5 1 in 3 Drinks Budweiser 1 in 10 1 in 5 Drinks Miller Draft 1 in 8 1 in 16 Drinks Heineken 1 in 13 1 in 21 Had recent emergency_room visit 1 in 3 1 in 3 Had cosmetic_surgery 1 in 100 1 in 167 Health-club member 1 in 4 1 in 7 Attended symphony / opera 1 in 6 1 in 11 Attended rock_concert 1 in 6 1 in 6 Owns a cat 1 in 4 1 in 5 Owns a dog 1 in 3 1 in 4 Shopped_at Target 1 in 4 1 in 4 Shopped_at Nordstrom 1 in 3 1 in 8 Spent $ 1 # 000 + on sportswear 1 in 50 None Bought furniture from IKEA 1 in 8 1 in 21 Paid $ 15 # 000 for new car 1 in 3 1 in 4 Paid $ 35 # 000 new car 1 in 50 1 in 250 Visited Palm Springs 1 in 4 1 in 10 Visited Wine Country 1 in 10 1 in 28 No domestic trips ' 93 1 in 6 1 in 2 1993 data provided by Los Angeles Times Market Research Department</TEXT>
