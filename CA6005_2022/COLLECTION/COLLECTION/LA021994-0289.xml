   <HEADLINE> SERBS ' WITHDRAWAL OVERSTATED , U.N. SAYS ; BOSNIA : SPOKESMAN TONES_DOWN ENTHUSIASM OVER PULLBACK . HE SAYS HANDFULS OF ARTILLERY , NOT ' CONVOYS , ' ARE BEING REMOVED FROM SARAJEVO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The chief spokesman for U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia on Friday sought to tone_down earlier enthusiasm over the first sizable pullback of heavy_weapons from Sarajevo by rebel Serbs , saying he was wrong to have suggested entire convoys had been seen leaving the gun batteries ringing the city . In a sign that the artillery withdrawal remains sporadic in_advance of a 1 a.m. Monday deadline that the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization set for punitive air strikes if the weapons are not pulled_back or neutralized , Col . Bill Aikman amended his previous characterization of the first significant Bosnian Serb relocation of heavy weaponry . He said the pace had picked_up from the few handfuls of_aged artillery pieces turned_over to the United Nations in the first week of the 10-day withdrawal period , &quot; but to describe them as convoys was going too far. &quot; His declaration late Thursday that U.N. monitors had watched entire convoys of weaponry being withdrawn suggested a mass-scale pullback by the rebels . In talks with U.N. Protection Force chief of mission Yasushi Akashi on Friday , Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic reiterated his promise to comply with the deadline for relocation or surrender of all tanks , mortars and rocket_launchers from the high ground around Sarajevo . Aikman declined to give specifics of how much weaponry has been moved_out of the 12-mile radius of Sarajevo that NATO has ordered demilitarized . But his cautious descriptions of the latest withdrawals suggested they included no tanks . Akashi was given assurances by both Karadzic and the greatly outgunned Bosnian government that they would complete the artillery surrender even 24 hours ahead of the deadline , said his spokesman , Peter MacFarlane . It has been estimated that the Serbian nationalists , who have besieged Sarajevo since April , 1992 , have as_many as 500 heavy artillery pieces on the edge of the city . Unwelcome side_effects of the first serious Western push to end the siege became clear as U.N. officials scrambled to aid the Serbs ' partial retreat . All of the nearly 800 additional troops relocated to Sarajevo within the past few days to back 3 # 000 already deployed in this shattered capital were borrowed from other peacekeeping or aid delivery projects in the volatile region , Aikman said . &quot; There ' s a crunch on . These people have jobs where they came from , and they ' ve got_to go_back someday , &quot; he said . A U.N. appeal for 3 # 000 to 4 # 000 more troops to enforce a cease-fire here and oversee the capital ' s demilitarization was met with resounding silence when it was issued last week . And the U.N. mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina is already short several thousand troops for protection of six &quot; safe areas &quot; proclaimed in the republic nine months ago , because contributing countries have become fearful of sending soldiers to what they see as a dangerous and largely unfocused mission . The troop shortage has compelled the newly arrived U.N. commander for Bosnian-based forces , British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , to borrow troops assigned to protect aid convoys in central Bosnia . Aikman declined to say whether that action was the cause or a consequence of a decision by the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees here to evacuate about 40 % of its aid workers from Bosnia for security regions . &quot; It ' s a standard security measure . It ' s better to have a small staff during a tense security situation , &quot; said one official of the U.N. refugee agency , explaining the quiet move to get aid workers out of the areas most vulnerable to possible retaliation by rebel Serbs . U.N. officials have sought to cast the Serbian weapons withdrawals as solid evidence that the NATO ultimatum has succeeded , and some have suggested a similar formula of regional demilitarization might be applied throughout Bosnia in stages as a means of gradually ending the war that has killed well_over 200 # 000 and driven 2 million from their homes . But the persistent dearth of U.N. troops to enforce peace measures threatens to lead to a situation in which the besieging rebels simply move their artillery from one vulnerable region to another , drawing token U.N. deployments that enforce the status_quo of fractured enclaves created by &quot; ethnic cleansing. &quot;</TEXT>
