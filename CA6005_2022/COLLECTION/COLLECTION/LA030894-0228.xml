   <HEADLINE> ART / CATHY CURTIS : LONG IN LATITUDE ; GIVEN AMPLE ELBOW_ROOM , CURATOR PAUL SCHIMMEL PUT NEWPORT HARBOR ON THE MAP IN THE ' 80S</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During the mid-1980s , while director Kevin Consey concentrated_on raising money and enthusiasm for a new , $ 20-million home for Newport Harbor on South Coast Highway , chief curator Paul Schimmel immersed himself in the museum ' s main reason for being : producing informative and provocative exhibitions of modern and contemporary art . &quot; My involvement with the building plan , the choices of the architect and design of the building was very , very little , &quot; Schimmel said recently . &quot; I was working_on the exhibitions , and Kevin wanted it to be that way . The building was his passion . In some respects , I was very fortunate because he was so involved_with the building that I was able to concentrate my full energies on the exhibition program. &quot; Beginning with &quot; Action / Precision : The New Direction in New York 1955-60 &quot; in 1984 and continuing at two-year intervals , Schimmel ' s trio of exhibitions about key issues relating to Abstract Expressionist painting involved significant original research into historical topics . Not that he neglected contemporary art . One of his major achievements at Newport Harbor was &quot; Chris Burden : A Twenty-Year Survey &quot; from 1988 . With its assembly of objects used in Burden ' s performances , its inclusion of two massive installations and its authoritative catalogue , the show offered a probing analysis and overview of the work of a seminal performance artist . Although Burden had received his master of fine_arts degree from UC Irvine -- and even had a work-study job at Newport Harbor during his student years -- the Orange County connection was not the impetus for the retrospective . Schimmel never was one to champion artists simply for geographic reasons , which provoked much grumbling in local studios . * Other landmarks in Schimmel ' s Newport Harbor career included the first Newport Biennial , &quot; Los Angeles Today , &quot; in 1984 , a survey of California artists of two generations , including Mike Kelley , Jill Giegerich , Charles Garabedian and Ed Moses . Like virtually all exhibitions at the museum , it was documented by a thorough catalogue , supporting the museum ' s growing reputation for serious scholarship . Schimmel also founded the &quot; New California Artists &quot; series , which spotlighted Los Angeles up-and-comers . The program initially was run_by Schimmel and associate curator Tom Heller ( best remembered for his California Culture Series , a blend of alternative and avant-garde classical_music programming ) . After Heller left , &quot; New California Artists &quot; really took_off under Anne Ayres , associate curator of exhibitions and collections from 1986 to 1988 , when she became director of the Art_Gallery at the Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles . Ayres , whose background was in university teaching , complemented Schimmel ' s more freewheeling personality with a series of meticulous and sensitive brochure essays expressing a keenly intellectual outlook on contemporary art . During the ' 80s , Newport Harbor became a player in the national art scene as shows were picked_up by such major institutions as the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York , the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston . Attention paid by the major East Coast art press was another sign of major_league status . &quot; Chris Burden , &quot; for example , made the pages of Artforum , Flash Art , Arts , Art in America and ArtNews magazines , as well as the Wall_Street Journal and the New York Times . New additions during Schimmel ' s curatorship , which more_than doubled the collection , encompassed a roll_call of such major California postwar artists as John Baldessari , Ed Kienholtz , David Park , Ed Ruscha , John Altoon , Vija Celmins , Robert Irwin , Charles Ray , Allen Ruppersberg , Chris Burden and James Turrell . Meanwhile , Schimmel ' s taste and knowledge helped guide the Acquisition Committee , which raised money to buy works for the museum . When members visited the private collection of Aggie Gund , then president of the board of the Museum of Modern Art in New York , &quot; they would know what they were looking_at , &quot; Schimmel says . &quot; That was very impressive for a small institution . It also helped me in terms of getting loans . It gave the museum credibility. &quot; Schimmel and Consey were not always in_accord . Their differences came_to a boil_over the declining amount of exhibition space in the new building when its size was decreased to save money . Schimmel says he was adamant that actual gallery space not be confused with other public spaces &quot; where the art is in fact decorating the architecture. &quot; Yet Schimmel -- who left his Newport Beach post in 1990 to become chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles -- is quick to credit Consey with providing a conducive atmosphere for research and acquisitions . &quot; Kevin did not hesitate to get_behind something that he believed would be in the interest of the institution , whether de-accessioning art to go_out and acquire new pieces or embracing a single exhibition that would cost us as much as the total budget several years earlier. &quot; For example , &quot; The Interpretive Link : Abstract Surrealism Into Abstract_Expressionism , Works_on Paper 1938-1948 , &quot; mounted in 1986 , cost &quot; in excess of $ 200 # 000 -- more_than the entire 1980 exhibition budget , &quot; according to Schimmel . Selling art from a museum collection often raises alarm among donors and others who fear an erosion of institutional value , but in this case it was entirely logical . After the board decided to collect only contemporary California art , works by artists with other geographic affiliations were sold at auction to raise money for acquisitions . ( Consey recalls that the board voted at least four times in six years on whether the museum should have a broader focus or remain dedicated to contemporary art , but the great majority of trustees always favored the status quo. ) In defense of the high costs of shows during his tenure , Consey points_out that he was hired &quot; to increase the scope and importance of ( the museum ' s ) scholarly activities. &quot; With the cooperation of the board and the help of &quot; an extraordinarily talented ( development ) staff and a great economy , &quot; he said , he was able to increase the museum ' s budget fourfold . It was $ 1.7 million when he left , with a surplus of about $ 30 # 000 . Hmm . Then how to account_for the $ 552 # 707 operating deficit that appears on the museum ' s September , 1990 , financial_statement ? Consey responds that the museum operated without a director for nearly a year and a half after he became director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago , a period when &quot; money was spent on exhibitions and salaries , and money wasn ' t being raised. &quot; Just before he left for Chicago in 1989 , Consey was asked what he felt he ' d achieved during his tenure at Newport Harbor . &quot; I think that , to a certain extent , we made_it socially acceptable to like contemporary art in Orange County , &quot; he replied . &quot; And if there ' s anything I ' ll take credit for , it ' s being able to do that without for a single beat compromising the cutting edge or the abrasiveness or the controversial aspects of our exhibition program . &quot; In the long_run , you never make a mistake by having excellence as your measuring stick . You may take it on the chin in the short term . You may be charged with being elitist and incomprehensible and not giving the community what it wants , but I don ' t think a public educational_institution is in the business of giving the public what it wants. &quot;</TEXT>
