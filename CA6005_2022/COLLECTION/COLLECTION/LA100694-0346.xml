   <HEADLINE> TREASURY_BOND YIELD NEARS 8 % IN BROAD SELLOFF ; WALL_STREET : REPORTS OF SURGING ECONOMY SEND INFLATION FEARS UP SHARPLY . SOME ANALYSTS NOW SEE FED RATE HIKE AS EARLY AS FRIDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Long-term Treasury_bond yields jumped Wednesday to just under 8 % -- their highest level since May , 1992 -- raising grave new worries about the economy ' s strength and what the Federal_Reserve_Board might do about it . In the latest sign that the economy remains on a roll , the government said Wednesday that factory orders rose in August at the fastest pace since 1992 . The news spurred yet another selloff in the bombed-out bond market , as traders immediately assumed that growth is strong enough either to fuel inflation or spur the Fed to tighten credit again -- or both . The bellwether 30-year Treasury_bond yield leaped from 7.88 % on Tuesday to a high of 7.97 % during Wednesday ' s trading , before closing at 7.94 % , a 28-month high . Many analysts now believe the Treasury_bond yield is certain to top 8 % soon , a_level last seen on May 5 , 1992 . The 8 % wall could be breached Friday if the government ' s report on September employment shows faster-than-expected job growth . Rumors were rife in the bond market Wednesday that the employment report will be robust enough to force another Fed interest_rate hike , possibly Friday . Eight months after the Fed began raising rates to brake consumer and business spending , &quot; there is no assurance that the economy has lost any steam , &quot; said Louis Crandall , economist at bond research firm R.H. Wrightson in New York . &quot; The question now is , what does_it take_to slow this economy down ? &quot; After the Fed ' s fifth credit-tightening move , on Aug . 16 , bond yields stabilized temporarily as Wall_Street assumed that short-term rates had risen enough to guarantee a waning economy . But since mid-September , economic data has increasingly suggested that growth remains healthy and that prices of raw_materials are rising at a pace that could eventually translate into higher consumer inflation . Those concerns have sparked renewed dumping of bonds by loss-ridden investors who fear that interest_rates , already up more_than two percentage_points across the board from a year ago , are destined to go much higher . Individual investors may just have been getting more comfortable with the bond market , until the latest selloff began two weeks ago . In a report issued Wednesday , mutual_fund tracker Lipper Analytical Services noted that most bond fund categories eked out positive &quot; total returns &quot; in the third quarter , as interest earnings marginally offset the continuing decline in principal values . But for the year to date , investors in long-term U.S._government bond mutual_funds have lost 9 % of their principal , on average , as rising market rates have devalued older bonds . Even after counting interest earned , investors in long-term U.S._government bond funds are out 4.8 % of their investment since Jan . 1 , on average . Ian MacKinnon , fixed-income chief at fund giant Vanguard Group in Valley Forge , Pa. , concedes that he and many of his peers on Wall_Street were convinced that interest_rates were near their top in August , when the 30-year T-bond yield was at 7.5 % . &quot; Now we don ' t know where the end is , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s no sign of a slowdown in the economy. &quot; But many experts believe the bond market ' s biggest problem is simply that impatient traders have panicked . Historically , there has been a six- to 12-month lag between the first Fed credit-tightening moves and bona_fide signs of slower growth . &quot; Any time that interest_rates have risen by as much as they have risen during 1994 , growth slowed significantly in the following year , &quot; said Donald Straszheim , economist at Merrill Lynch . Indeed , despite the continuing carnage in the bond market as yields surge again , many bond pros believe a T-bond yield near 8 % -- which translates into corporate_bonds near 9 % -- is a terrific return that will eventually attract a horde of new bond buyers . But Jack Utter , manager of the IDS Strategy Income bond fund in Minneapolis , acknowledges that most potential bond investors are still frozen in place as yields continue to rocket . &quot; People are thinking_about buying , but they ' re not acting yet , &quot; he said . Bonds : Rising Rates , Deepening Losses The continuing surge in market interest_rates this year has caused deep principal losses for bond fund owners .
