   <HEADLINE> CRIME AND PUNISHMENT -- AND POLITICS ; HOW MANY PRISONS MUST WE BUILD TO FEEL SECURE ? ; LEADERSHIP : ' THREE STRIKES ' ISN ' T AS TOUGH AS CHANGING THE CLIMATE FOR CRIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Three strikes and you ' re out , &quot; the proposal to imprison three-time felons for life , is drawing considerable attention from politicians . Governors as different as Mario Cuomo and Pete Wilson , who share little more_than bad polling numbers and impending elections , have rushed to embrace the proposal . This is not surprising . The idea , like the slogan , is simple , satisfying to express and capable of channeling the overwhelming tide of popular anger about violent crime rising in America . Any politician who does not ride_on this wave has good reason to fear being dragged under it . The arguments against the proposal are solid , persuasive and boring . Any effort to really enforce such a law will require a massive increase in prison spending when states like California and New York have been slashing budgets_for years . Wilson promises to build six more prisons on top of the five he has already built_on top of those built by his predecessor . Cuomo , too , promises to wring New York ' s budget dry to pay_for more cells . Life sentences involve a lot more whimper than bang . The twentysomethings with a seemingly insatiable appetite for violence become forty- , fifty- or sixtysomethings . Their propensity for violence goes_down but the cost of maintaining them ( in human as well as fiscal terms ) goes_up . In the meantime , correctional officers will have to deal with a burgeoning population of inmates with little left to lose . So many violent offenders are now being released without serving their full_terms because mandatory sentencing laws for drug offenders have already filled our prisons , forcing early release of felons without mandatory minimums . &quot; Three strikes &quot; would add yet another monolithic mandatory sentencing policy that robs our courts of the ability to make common-sense distinctions of degree between crimes and criminals . But , look , don ' t bother the public with the fiscal details , or the fact that plenty of horrible crimes , like the rampage on the Long_Island commuter_train , get committed by people with no record of felonies . Like the ball_game from which the slogan derives , the &quot; three strikes &quot; proposal has an almost mythic quality that sustains its capacity to endure in our hearts over many seasons of disappointment . This is the stuff that dreams ( and governors ) are made of . Indeed , variations on this theme , life terms for &quot; habitual &quot; offenders , have been around since the 19th Century and in some form or another sit in the laws of virtually every state in the union , the relics of earlier crime panics and campaigns . Before this wave crests , leaving_behind yet more evidence for the proposition that Lincoln should have been more worried about fooling most of the people most of the time , two aspects are worth considering . While &quot; three strikes &quot; may seem to fit_in with the &quot; get_tough &quot; policies toward crime legislated over the last decade or two , it really reflects an admission of bankruptcy on the part of that philosophy . They used to tell us that tough sentences would cut_through the confusing messages of the &quot; rehabilitative &quot; penal philosophy , and that the promise of stiff punishment would deter crime . Now , billions and billions of dollars later , &quot; three strikes &quot; implicitly acknowledges a fact too painfully obvious to conceal any more : Deterrence did not work to prevent crime . And , guess what ? The new solution to the old solution looks_like the same solution : more prisons . Californians , like people all_over America who are toasting the &quot; three strikes &quot; proposition , are expressing genuine frustration over the loss of personal security in this country . Contrary to the received wisdom that Americans want their government to go_away and leave them alone , millions of Americans are saying that they expect government to take an active role in improving the conditions that make life so fearful , and they are willing to be taxed if they believe it will go_to a serious effort . What form should that effort take ? Criminal-justice experts , liberal and conservative , share a surprising degree of consensus on programs that will have both short- and long-term impacts on public safety , such_as : targeting early intervention at juvenile offenders ; improving drug treatment and education programs in prison so that first-time felons do not graduate to careers in crime ; and boosting police presence in the schools , parks and shopping districts where law-abiding citizens must be made to feel secure if our cities are to remain economically viable . None of these proposals has anything like the magic ring of &quot; three strikes and you ' re out. &quot; Creating a thoughtful strategy to reduce crime and increase public confidence in the safety of their communities will be as boring as a pitchers ' duel . The question is whether the political leadership and the taxpayers will give the serious , low-key approach a try before or after the next multibillion-dollar monument to political mendacity is constructed .</TEXT>
