   <HEADLINE> 3-HOUR TOUR : A FEAST OF TREATS ON THE HALF-SHELL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There ' s no better place to start a crawl through Fountain Valley than Casa de Tortuga . From the street it may look_like an ordinary residence , but inside are more_than 700 tortoises and turtles , drawn from 100 species including Argentine side necks and Chinese big heads . And because turtle_soup is not on the menu , you ' ll need to head over to Richard Jones Pit BBQ . There are no Texas_tortoises , but they do offer smoked armadillo tails . After a quick bite , the latest mutant turtle comic can be found at the Land of Oohs and Ahs . 10 to 11:15 : A turtle-shaped doorbell gives you a hint that Casa de Tortuga is a casa unlike any other . Beyond the front gate , Walter Allen ' s turtles , tortoises and related collectibles fill two large homes on three city lots landscaped with cactus , hibiscus and a 5 # 000-gallon pond . Tours are booked well in_advance , but you can attend its annual open_house this Saturday and Sunday , no appointment needed . ( The neighbors don ' t mind the tours because the animals are so quiet , the operation is educational and humanitarian , and there ' s normally only one tour a day. ) &quot; It ' s just a hobby I ran_into , and it got_out of hand , &quot; said Allen , 67 . &quot; You buy two , then you got 10 , next thing you know it ' s 28 years later , and you got 600. &quot; Signs warn , &quot; Danger , beware of stampeding turtles &quot; and &quot; These premises patrolled by attack tortoise. &quot; The tour starts with red-eared sliders and Argentine side necks , whose heads are too big to retract . Among the world ' s larger tortoises are the Kalahari_Desert ' s sulcata , the Burmese and the Galapagos : &quot; That male was 6 months old and weighed 4 1 / 2 ounces when I got him , &quot; Allen recalled . &quot; Now he weighs 350 pounds . He ' s cantankerous , but he ' s our mascot because I feel so proud to raise him up . I ' ve had him 23 years. &quot; The largest is the aldabara , from the Seychelles Islands ; Allen ' s , still young , weighs 450 pounds . Inside the house are the collectibles : turtle hot_plates , graters , cookie_jars , coffee_cups , teapots and baby-powder shakers . &quot; You name it , it ' s been made into a turtle , &quot; Allen said . Some sport slogans such_as &quot; Turtles do_it slower &quot; and &quot; My shell or yours ? &quot; One room is a veritable Ripley ' s Believe It or Not of turtles , where wonders include snake-neck turtles and the spine-covered mata-mata . Chinese big heads are good climbers : &quot; I was watching a travelogue , and one went from the bottom to the top of a 200-foot-high waterfall , &quot; Allen said . &quot; Turtles have claws . If a turtle can grab on , he can climb . They ' re just not all interested in doing it. &quot; Allen also owns two albino turtles , yellow-orange with pink eyes , and even a freeze-dried turtle . 11:15-11:35 : No goldfish are in_sight , but even a mata-mata might be interested in taking a_few moments to check_out the varied spread at A-Unique Bazaar , Indo-Pak Grocery &amp; Video . Turmeric , coriander , garlic , fennel , tamarind and cardamom are a_few of the spices lining the shelves . Less odoriferous , but no less enticing , are jars of mango and chili pickle , fresh carrot pickle and lime pickle , extra hot . Chutneys include fresh mint and others made from such mangoes as chunda and katke . Basmati rice is big here ; it comes_in 44-pound bags . Among a bevy of beans for soups are garbanzo , black_eye and mung . The store also stocks Indian-language videos , though some have names like &quot; Boyfriend. &quot; 11:35-12:35 : Turtles don ' t have ribs , but Richard Jones Pit BBQ does , and the beans transcend all language_barriers . What ' s in them that makes them so good ? &quot; Sometimes beef , sometimes pork , you never know , &quot; the waitress said . One bite , and everything else went_on hold . Armadillo tails , hickory-smoked chicken strips with barbecue_sauce and fries , are $ 4.50 ; lunch with the fixings is $ 5.95 for beef or spare ribs , half-chicken or smoked ham , $ 6.95 for baby back ribs . Combination platters are generally $ 10.95 ; I chose beef brisket , &quot; smoked up_to 16 hours , &quot; and baby back ribs ( add $ 1.25 ) . A pail was provided_for bones , and a request for water brought a glass the size of the Panhandle . Other barbecue_sauces can turn a perfectly good meal into a tomato-y mess , but Jones ' bottled sauce might make a perfectly good meal itself . 12:35-1 : The Land of Oohs and Ahs carries comic_books , 25 cents and up , guaranteed to bring you out of your shell : &quot; Freex , &quot; &quot; Lobo / Infanticide &quot; ( &quot; Say yer pwayers , cweep , &quot; says a baby on the cover , milk bottle and guns at his side ) as well as the more G-rated &quot; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. &quot; Owner Robert Lugibihl said that a reorder of &quot; Tortuga ! &quot; was possible . &quot; It ' s about a turtle that got caught in an experiment , kinda like Spiderman did , and he turns_into a giant turtle , &quot; Lugibihl said . &quot; There was a museum show for kids , and one of the kids carried his little pet turtle with him wherever he went , and they were doing some sort of atomic tests in front of these kids , like with an experimental growth ray , and the kid trips and drops his turtle and it gets bathed in the beam , and it starts growing and growing . &quot; It gets as big as Godzilla , and it ' s like stomping through the city , and a_couple_of superheroes fly down to try to stop it . Its brain grows really big too so that it gets really intelligent . Finally the little kid appeals_to it , and says , ' Please stop , ' and the turtle says , ' Forgive me , I didn ' t know what I was doing , I was confused and my brain was growing , ' and then he flies off into outer space and says he ' s going_to go be with higher life forms. &quot; So where was Walter Allen through all_of this ? 3-Hour Tour 1 .
