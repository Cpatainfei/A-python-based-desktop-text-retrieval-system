   <TEXT> My mother and father arrived in Los Angeles one afternoon in early September , 1968 . They got_off the plane , and it was just as I imagined : My father came_out the front_door -- my mother , the rear . As if they were not related . Then , like two lines converging to a center point , they moved toward us . At the age of 65 , after a lifetime of uncompromising and dedicated service in the world of hardware , my father had sold_out . The news of his defection spread through the Jewish community of Rushmore Rapids , S.D. Max Weiss , the traitor , was moving to Los Angeles . &quot; I need sunshine , &quot; he explained , as though he were a plant that had been living_in darkness all these years , reaching_out at last for a little light . My mother begged and pleaded for him to stay_put . A person should think_twice before making such a drastic change . So my father thought_twice and then said it was final . He was leaving Rushmore Rapids . He was going_to retire to California . Then , shyly , and careful not to overdo it , he said my mother could come_along if she wanted . * We waited for my parents behind the wire fence : My sister Phyllis , her husband ( whose father was president of a small but flourishing movie company ) , their child and I , Harold Weiss . We hugged and kissed and told my mother and father that it was wonderful they had come . Then we stood_back and looked them over and did not admit even to ourselves that they were smaller than we had remembered . Small and gray and alien in the bright Southern California day . Then my brother-in-law , Mark Berle , Jr. , put little Mark Berle III into the Mark II Continental with its Mark IV air-conditioner , and soon we were out of the airport and onto the freeway , shivering a little in the artificial comfort of the big car . Fade in , as my brother-in-law would say when he tells me the plots of those Grade-Z movies that he and his father produce . Fade in , pan your camera and know that it is eight months later and already April . I have been in Berkeley all this time trying to turn 10 # 000 index cards full of anthropological observations into a dissertation that goes_by the catchy title of &quot; Derivation of Personality Variables in a Rice-Growing Village in Northern Thailand. &quot; But how can I pursue this when I see in my supermarket that the Easter_Bunny is holding a giant-sized box of Passover matzo ? That the exotic-food section now displays a Mother Feldman ' s Frozen Seder that features three pieces of chicken , two matzo-balls-with-soup-in-a-plastic-bag , half a shank bone , a sprig of pre-salted parsley , and a mimeographed prayer_book ? A wave of sentiment rolls_up and breaks_into foam within me . With a silent apology to Mrs . Feldman and a promise to take a rain_check , I put the frozen package back and decide that it is time_to_come home . * I think I am in the wrong apartment . But the lady in the bare feet and purple muumuu -- frying a taco shell at the kitchen_stove -- assures me that she is my mother . I can ' t believe it . I drop my suitcase and kiss her anyway . &quot; How is the novel going ? &quot; she says , giving me a big hug . This is no time to educate her about what I have been doing for the past eight months . She is too primitive in her flowing garment and silver-painted toenails . She is all sunshine and summer . Two months early . Even her hair is now a remarkable shade of gold . Out of the corner of my eye , I catch_a_glimpse of winter . There at the kitchen_table my father sits in a sweater buttoned_up to the neck . Otherwise , he seems to be wearing pajamas . It is 3 o ' clock_in the afternoon . Either he is ready for bed or has just gotten_up . One way or the other he must be_sick . Or is it only that he has taken_on the 10 years that my mother seems to have shed ? He is surrounded by newspapers . All from Rushmore Rapids . They are two weeks , three weeks , a month old . He is reading them aloud and hardly stops to greet me . * &quot; Don ' t let me interrupt , &quot; I say , pulling_up a chair to join him . He grunts , finds his place on the page and continues : &quot; Arlo Swenson , age 73 , passed_away February 10 , please omit flowers . . . La Verne Hanson , 69 , mother of Gracie , Shirley , Warren , Sigmund , sister of Twilah , Earl . . . . &quot; My mother is listening to him with one ear . With the other , she is tuned to &quot; The Dating Game &quot; on a small portable television_set that sits on top of the kitchen counter along with the sugar , flour and other staples . As my father approaches the end of the alphabet of the dead , she moves_back to the stove and transfers the television to the warming shelf along with the salt and pepper . It takes me only 24 hours to discover the derivation of personality variables in an efficiency_apartment in Hollywood . * My father can be summed_up on a single index card . Max Weiss : once-in-hardware-now-retired-pusher-of-market-basket-reader-of-old-newspapers . My mother is a longer story : Within eight months of her arrival in Los Angeles , she is_on a first-name basis with all_of the important figures of show_business . For how can one live_in the same place , breathe the same air , tan under the same sun , and continue to call them Mister Lancaster or Miss Day , Mister Peck or Miss Garland ? And especially when she steps_on their star-shaped faces as she does her errands on Hollywood Boulevard day after day . * Each morning , while my father stirs his oatmeal into boiling water , my mother has been walking down that great street , planting the soles of her straw clogs smack on those golden names . Clop ! Julie Andrews . She stood next to her at the cash_register at the Farmer ' s Market last Thursday . Clop ! Clop ! Natalie Wood . That was who was eating a hamburger at the next table the Saturday before . Clop ! Clop ! Clop ! Clark Gable , who is dead but his wife is a lovely person . My mother knows this because the real_estate man who uses the same accountant as Mrs . Gable ' s lawyer ' s stockbroker plays tennis with a friend of Mark ' s . His ears were not so big as my mother thought . Mark ' s ears ? No , Clark ' s ears . He feels_like a son to her . Clark ? No , Mark . And speaking_of Mark , he is the soul of generosity . Thanks to him and his father , she has seen practically everything that is being taped , shot , previewed or sneaked . There is nothing like seeing life firsthand . She never realized it all those years in Rushmore Rapids . She wishes my father would be more interested in these things . But my father does not hear . He is already asleep and dreaming . In ordinary black_and_white . On a grainy screen . The way it used to be at the Dakota Theater , 35 cents and the kids for a dime . My mother is sorry but she cannot make dinner for us tonight . Would we mind if she opened a can of chow_mein or a carton of cottage_cheese ? She has to make_it to a 6 o ' clock taping of a show at Channel 11 . The master of ceremonies is a friend of Mark ' s . He ' s very nice but his wife is in a mental_hospital . She feels very sorry_for him . &quot; I have just five minutes , &quot; she urges . &quot; Shall I open the chow_mein or the cottage_cheese ? I recommend the chow mein. &quot; Her hat is already on . Her pocketbook waits by the automatic can_opener . &quot; Cottage_cheese , &quot; says my father without hesitation . * The chow_mein is tempting me . But somehow , in some way , I feel I must join forces with my father . &quot; Cottage_cheese , &quot; I declare at last . I remind myself that tomorrow is Passover . The reason I came_home . Things will be in_order again for a little while . Tomorrow night my father will not be only Weiss-once-in-hardware . But man of the house , head of the table , blesser of wine , hider of matzo , donor of the dollar . The way I remember . The way I want it to be . You see , I am right . My father is up already this morning and dressed for the evening ahead . His navy-blue gabardine suit is a little shiny . And his neck does not quite fill_out the collar of his starched white shirt . But his perforated shoes are shined to perfection and he bounces into the kitchen humming a rather current tune . He envelops us in a marvelous vapor of shaving lotion , pine scent , talcum_powder and Merthiolate . All of which combine now with the steam of the soup , the scent of the chicken_livers , the traces of everything that my mother has mashed , mixed , grated and chopped . In this one moment , in this two-by-four kitchen of their exile , my mother and father have come_home . But it is a fleeting impression . It fades in the time it takes my father to pick_up the morning paper , and my mother to switch_on the radio_news . &quot; Tonight . . . , &quot; reads my father with great pride . &quot; Tonight . . . , &quot; says the announcer . &quot; . . . all Southland Jewry will gather at sundown . . . &quot; &quot; . . . all Hollywood will convene . . . &quot; &quot; . . . for the traditional ceremony . . . &quot; &quot; . . . for the traditional ceremony . . . &quot; &quot; . . . of the Passover Seder . . . &quot; &quot; . . . of the Academy Awards. &quot; * &quot; My God ! &quot; cries my mother . She claps one hand to her heart as if it had been split in two . One part Southland Jewry , one part All Hollywood . &quot; What ' s the_matter ? &quot; says my father , who looks_up , startled . &quot; Nothing , &quot; says my mother , already picking_up the phone and dialing what I know is Phyllis ' number . &quot; Whom are you calling ' ? &quot; says my father . &quot; Nobody , &quot; she answers . &quot; Go_on reading , &quot; I urge my father . &quot; Phyllis ! &quot; gasps my mother , cupping her hand_over the telephone like a secret_agent . &quot; . . . which recalls the flight of the Hebrews from the bondage of the Pharaoh . . . , &quot; continues my father , oblivious , as my mother slowly moves with the phone out of the kitchen , down the hallways , and into the bedroom , leaving_behind her the plastic length of extension_cord that connects her like an umbilical_cord to my sister in Beverly Hills . * And so it finally came_to pass that the Academy Awards fell on the same night as the first Seder . Or , to put it another way , the Seder falls on the same night as the Academy Awards . It all depends_on where one sits , and the way one looks_at it . As it turns_out , we are going_to sit in both places and look_at it both ways . Mark and his parents are going_to the Academy Awards since it is a tradition in their family . Phyllis and her 4-year-old are coming_to the Seder out of deference to my father . My mother says that this could happen only once in a 100 years . Phyllis says that somebody up there should have prevented it . I have no heart to tell my father the truth . &quot; How come Mark is not coming ? &quot; he asks_for the third time . * &quot; I told you , &quot; says my mother , as she removes three place_settings from the table . &quot; He had to go somewhere with his parents. &quot; &quot; And where did Mr. and Mrs . Berle have to go ? &quot; he presses . &quot; They had to go somewhere with Mark , &quot; explains Phyllis . We are lined_up on the living-room couch , waiting for the sun to sink -- like the enemy of old -- into the red_sea of the horizon . But the sun refuses . My sister chain-smokes and looks poignantly remote . As if she is at the wrong place , at the wrong time . My mother keeps looking_at her wristwatch and complains that the sun sets much earlier in Rushmore Rapids . My father informs her that it is the same sun . Also , that there is no hurry since we have all night for the Seder . He does not seem to notice that RCA Victor is sitting at the table in the place usually reserved for Elijah . That the remote-control switch waits_on Phyllis ' napkin along with the dinner fork . Or that the TV Guide lies open on my mother ' s plate like a supplementary haggadah . Finally , the sun sets , and we take our places at the table . In the dark of the unlit dining_area my father draws himself up_to full size and begins the prayers . As he does , a pinpoint of white begins to grow in the eye of the television . My father raises his arms . He prays in that voice that brings me back to my childhood when I was suspended between fear and laughter . * ' Boruch atto adonoy elohenu . . . praised be Thou , O Lord our God , King of the Universe . . . &quot; &quot; . . . and president of the Motion_Picture Academy . . . , &quot; says Bob Hope . &quot; My mistake , &quot; says my mother . &quot; I didn ' t mean to have the sound turned_on yet . Only the picture. &quot; My father raises his glass of wine . &quot; Boruch atto adonoy elohenu . . . , &quot; he begins , as the president of the Motion_Picture Academy moves his lips in perfect synchronization . &quot; A little louder ? &quot; asks Phyllis . &quot; Bore p ' ri ha-gofen . . . , &quot; booms my father . &quot; Not you , &quot; says my mother . Click ! Up goes the remote_control . &quot; Praised be Thou , O Lord our God . . . who gives us . . . &quot; Debbie Reynolds ! &quot; says Bob Hope . &quot; . . . the fruit of the vine . . . , &quot; says my father . &quot; Still can ' t hear , &quot; complains my mother . &quot; Boruch atto adonoy elohenu . . . bore p ' ri ho-adomo , &quot; continues my father , dipping parsley into salt water and passing it on . * &quot; It ' s only the preliminaries , &quot; says Phyllis , speeding the parsley to my mother . &quot; . . . who creates the fruit of the earth , &quot; says my father . &quot; The technical stuff , &quot; agrees my mother . &quot; Start the horseradish , Harold. &quot; Down the table go the technicalities . The parsley , the salt water , the bitter herbs . The tears and bricks of 6 # 000 years that we are going_to dispose_of in three minutes . In order to honor Charlton Heston . It is my turn_to sing . &quot; Ma nish-ta-no , ha-lai-lo ha-ze . . . &quot; as Joan Crawford nominates the first song from a motion_picture of the same name . &quot; It won ' t win , &quot; predicts my mother . &quot; Joan Crawford has aged , &quot; observes Phyllis . Don ' t look , I tell myself . My heart is pumping painfully . The vein at the side of my head is popping . My father and Bob Hope are swapping stories now and I can ' t tune out . Or stop looking . I am peeking with the eyes in back of my head . I am listening with the extra pair of ears I have just sprouted . The golden idols are irresistible and I am struck by the childish feeling that God knows it . He will come_down through the antenna , send holy sparks flying , explode the television . Strike us dead ! What is the_matter with my father ? I am furious to see how he bends over the table singing and reading and talking only to himself . His voice is no more_than the static from a competing station . * &quot; Max . . . , &quot; I say , leaning forward to let him know that I , for one , am listening to him . That for me , he should speak louder . Take a stand . But his eyes are shut tight against me . They are locked , like double_doors closing me out . Behind them , he is running . He abandons us all . He is not in Los Angeles . Not even in Rushmore Rapids . He is across some ocean . Sixty-five years away . He is his own father , and father before him . He knows_nothing of television , of my mother , of Phyllis . Or Harold . He denies us all . I want to kick him . It would bring him back . Furious , I slap down the napkin , shove back my chair , reach for the television plug . I am God ' s emissary on earth ! When suddenly I feel my father ' s hand on my arm . Without a word or a glance in my direction , he grips my arm and holds it in place . I know what he is saying with his hand . He needs no help , no Harold-to-the-rescue . He knows everything that I know . And maybe more . His blunt , hairy fingers are humorous on my own hand . They telegraph that the world is a funny place , so smile . His thumb is a botch of his 40 years at the knife-sharpener . His index_finger wags -- for shame -- at my own presumptions . The ring_finger curls under , squeezed in its circle of old_gold . It allows my mother to reach for her crazy stars another day . As long as it takes her . He will survive . She will be all_right . Phyllis is not so bad . And you , Harold , are not so great . Sit at the head of_your_own table and do what you have to do some day . Don ' t ask me . Don ' t need me . Find your own answers . Take a wife , produce a child . Then laugh . I relax , and after a while my father ' s head begins to nod and droops toward the table . If I don ' t remove his plate , he will be face down in the salad course . I remove the plate , smooth the cloth , wad up the napkin for a pillow . His face is turned sideways on the table , his hand has fallen_away from mine . He smiles to himself at the thought that at least we are sitting at the same table . Maybe he is right . At least he is not wrong .</TEXT>
