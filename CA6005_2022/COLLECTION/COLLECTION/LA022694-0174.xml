   <HEADLINE> WARDEN TOLD TO RETIRE OR BE DEMOTED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a surprise move , officials have told the warden at the state_prison in Lancaster either to retire or accept a demotion -- likely the result of a series of problems that have plagued the year-old prison , including the escapes of a convicted murderer and three other inmates . In a brief statement issued Friday , state_prison officials said , &quot; The California Department of Corrections has made a decision to restructure the management team ( at the Lancaster prison ) . . . Otis Thurman , warden , has yet to determine which options available to him would be in his best interest and has decided to take some time off. &quot; No other details were released , but several members of the prison ' s citizens advisory committee said they were told that Thurman ' s options were to retire -- after more_than three decades as a corrections department employee -- or accept a demotion and be transferred elsewhere . &quot; I was notified Thursday the warden was being asked to take a demotion and / or retire , &quot; said Jake Maeders , a committee_member . The sudden shake-up also includes the demotion and transfer of Thurman ' s second in command at the 4 # 000-inmate prison . Beginning Monday , Chief Deputy Warden Alex Marmolejo , has a new assignment as an associate warden at the state_prison in Tehachapi . Prison officials declined comment beyond the brief statement . Lancaster prison spokesman KennI . Hicks , the only prison administration employee who answers media queries , said , &quot; The only information I ' m providing is just what ' s in that statement . This is all we ' re issuing at this point. &quot; Calls to James H . Gomez , the Department of Corrections director in Sacramento , were referred to the agency ' s media office . That office said all calls_on the_matter had to be directed to the Lancaster prison . Advisory committee_members said they , too , were given little information and that they were surprised Thurman was being replaced . But committee_member George Root , a Lancaster councilman , said he thought something like this would happen . &quot; I think his ( Thurman ' s ) problem was he was too laid back , &quot; Root said . &quot; I ' m really happy the Department of Corrections saw fit to remove the warden and his deputy as a first_step to reorganization of the management staff. &quot; Most advisory committee_members said the shake-up is the result of the four escapes , including that of two maximum-security inmates , and other problems that have occurred at the prison . The first escapes occurred just five months after the prison opened Feb . 1 , 1993 . On July 2 , two minimum-security inmates , one serving time for burglary the other for robbery , walked away from their barracks . Both were captured -- one two days later , the other four days after his escape . On Oct . 5 , convicted murderer Eric Rene Johnson escaped_from the maximum-security unit . Johnson , serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole , was spotted about five hours later at a Lancaster convenience_store , a_few miles from the prison . Johnson ' s escape , the first by a maximum security inmate , triggered an uproar in the community . Prison officials waited more_than two hours to notify the local sheriff ' s station . The Lancaster City_Council was not told for more_than 12 hours , after Johnson was captured . The escape and the handling of it led community leaders to abandon plans to support construction of a second state_prison in Lancaster . On Jan . 13 , maximum-security inmate Steven Charles Brigida hid in a garbage bin to escape . He was dumped with the trash into a truck , then discarded at a Lancaster landfill . Brigida , serving a sentence of life plus eight years for attempted murder , auto theft and burglary , suffered broken ribs . Guards have shot and wounded inmates at least three times , including twice this month . Four inmates were hospitalized in early February after being injured when refusing to comply with cell and body searches that were being conducted because of information that an inmate had a weapon . The prison has been heavily criticized for failing to keep the community informed , as has Thurman for making no public statements about the escapes . Reports on the results of investigations into the escapes have yet to be released . &quot; We want the community to be safe , we want the prison more media friendly , we want better community relations , &quot; said James Lott , chairman of the 15-member advisory committee . &quot; We need to have openness . We cannot have a perception they ' re hiding things at the prison. &quot; Although Lott would n ' t speculate on reasons behind the management restructure , he said if it was a result of the escapes , &quot; I think it sends a strong signal that the community is not going_to tolerate escapes. &quot; &quot; I would hope that any change is going_to be for improvement of the facility and that would include reducing escapes , &quot; said Dennis Davenport , another committee_member . Andrew Banks , a correctional officer at the prison , said that since word of Thurman ' s departure spread , morale has been low among employees . &quot; As far as I know he was_well liked , &quot; said Banks , president of the local chapter of the California Correctional Peace_Officers Assn . Until Gov . Pete Wilson appoints a new warden , the prison will be run_by an interim warden . Joann Gordon , southern regional administrator , began serving Thursday in that post . In the next few days , Warden John Ratelle from the R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego , will arrive in Lancaster and fill the interim post . Prison officials did not know when a replacement for the chief deputy warden would be named .</TEXT>
