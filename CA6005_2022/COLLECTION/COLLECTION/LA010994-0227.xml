   <HEADLINE> KEY IRISH MODERATE ASKS FOR CLARIFICATION OF PEACE PROPOSAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A key moderate Catholic leader in Northern_Ireland urged British Prime_Minister John Major on Saturday to spell_out parts of a British-Irish peace proposal , a move requested by the_Irish Republican Army . John Hume , leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labor_Party , said a review of the proposal would not constitute negotiations , which Major has refused . &quot; The prize at the end of the road is so great , &quot; Hume said , &quot; that I think everybody should do everything in their power , and particularly governments , to ensure that comes about. &quot; Gerry Adams , president of Sinn Fein , the IRA ' s political arm , has written to Major asking_for clarification of the accord before an official IRA response is given . Adams particularly sought clarification of two points : a reference_to self-determination for the people of Ireland and whether the Protestant majority in Ulster would have a veto over island-wide moves for unification .</TEXT>
