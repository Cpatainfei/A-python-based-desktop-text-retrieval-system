   <HEADLINE> POP EYE : RECORD EXECS TAKING RAP FROM CRITICS CHARGING RACISM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Record executives who didn ' t take last month ' s congressional gangsta rap hearings seriously may be having second_thoughts now . Against the backdrop of violence that ' s marred the music ' s image , record companies are scrambling to cope_with fallout from the latest accusation against rap : racism . A growing number of black feminists , church leaders and politicians have charged that white-owned record labels are profiting from disseminating negative images of African Americans in the music of Snoop Doggy Dogg , Ice_Cube and other rappers . In the past , record companies involved in rap were accused of racism when they succumbed to pressure from white critics and censored or banned potentially offensive songs by African American rap artists . This time around , those applying pressure to the industry include singer Dionne Warwick , &quot; Soul Train &quot; founder Don Cornelius and Rev . Calvin Butts , pastor of Harlem ' s Abyssinian Baptist_Church . &quot; The proliferation of violence and unacceptable sexual messages in our youth ' s music is_due in large part to the avarice of the record industry , &quot; said C . DeLores Tucker , head of the Washington-based National Political Congress of Black_Women . The organization , which includes such high-profile figures as former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm , was instrumental in encouraging Rep . Cardiss Collins and Sen . Carol Moseley-Braun , both of Illinois , to convene the recent rap hearings . A second round of Capitol_Hill hearings is planned . &quot; For 400 years , profit has come_before principle as African Americans bore the brunt of slave masters ' degradation , &quot; Tucker told Pop Eye . &quot; Who owns the companies that put_out all this garbage ? From what I hear , the record industry is demanding in their contracts that these messages of degradation be in the music of the artists. &quot; Record company executives deny that such contracts exist and also call the charges of racism absurd . Privately , however , they express concern over the groundswell of support that the new_wave of gangsta rap critics is gaining in the African American community . &quot; It seems like the industry just can ' t win when it comes_to putting_out controversial rap , &quot; said one white executive . &quot; You ' re damned if you do and you ' re damned if you don ' t. &quot; Chuck Philips</TEXT>
