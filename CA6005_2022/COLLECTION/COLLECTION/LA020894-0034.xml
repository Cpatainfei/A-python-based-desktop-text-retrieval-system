   <HEADLINE> MORNING BRIEFING : SUPERMAN SHOWS BO A_FEW THINGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the Feb . 27 episode of &quot; Lois &amp; Clark : the New Adventures of Superman , &quot; Clark Kent will play a one-on-one basketball_game against new Angel Bo Jackson . After an obligatory &quot; Bo knows jump_shots &quot; line , Kent , played by former Princeton football standout Dean Cain , leaps super high to block a shot . Kent returns to Earth , smiling sheepishly . Says Jackson : &quot; Bo don ' t know that. &quot; * Add Bo : Before anyone writes_off Jackson , Peter Schmuck of the Baltimore Sun points_out that only three players last season hit longer home_runs . Jackson hit a 472-foot shot in Seattle ' s Kingdome , the sixth-longest of the season , according to IBM Tale of the Tape . The Detroit Tigers ' Cecil Fielder had three longer home_runs , and Dean Palmer of the Texas_Rangers and Andres Galarraga of the Colorado Rockies also went_deeper than Jackson . * Trivia time : In California girls ' high_school basketball , who are the only two players to have scored 100 points in a game ? * Shaken Shirley : You ' d think drag racer Shirley Muldowney has felt worse shakings than the 6.7 earthquake on Jan . 17 . Not so , apparently . &quot; Our house is 1 1 / 2 blocks from the Northridge apartment_building that collapsed , &quot; she told National Dragster magazine . &quot; The shaking was at least 10 times worse than any tire shake I ever had_on the track . During the two hours before the sun came , up we had good reason to believe everything was flattened from here to San Diego . &quot; Since the quake , we ' ve been sleeping_in our truck because our nerves are_on edge . &quot; I ' m out of here . We ' re looking_for property in Northern Michigan right now. &quot; * The joker : Fred Richman , longtime friend of NFL Hall_of_Fame member Dick Butkus , says some of Butkus ' greatest plays were as a practical_joker , not as a linebacker for the Bears . &quot; The two of us spent a weekend at a friend ' s Chicago apartment once , &quot; Richman recalled . &quot; At the last minute , the friend had to go_out of town , and he asked us to help_out a carpet installer when he came . &quot; When the guy finished with the carpet , Dick and I moved all_the furniture . We put his couch in the kitchen , put his refrigerator in the bedroom . . . . stuff like that . Then we left . &quot; A month later , Dick called the guy and asked how he liked the carpet . &quot; The guy told him : ' The carpet ' s great , but that installer -- what a . . . idiot that guy was. ' &quot; * Semper Fi : Hall_of_Fame horse trainer Charlie Whittingham , 80 , explains why he remained at Santa Anita rather than attend the recent Eclipse Awards in New Orleans , where his Flawlessly was honored as female grass horse of the year : &quot; I ' d better not go_back . The last time I was in New Orleans , I joined the Marines. &quot; * Trivia answer : USC Coach Cheryl Miller , who scored 105 points in a 1982 game , and her current center , Lisa Leslie , who scored 101 in 1990 . * Quotebook : Former Oakland Athletic relief_pitcher Rollie Fingers , who endorses a brush-in color product for facial hair : &quot; People come_up_to me all_the time and say : ' You ' ve got a mustache just like Rollie Fingers.
