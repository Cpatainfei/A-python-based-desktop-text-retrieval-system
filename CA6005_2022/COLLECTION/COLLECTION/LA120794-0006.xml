   <HEADLINE> QUESTION FACING NATO ' S EXPANSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> NATO was born in the crisis atmosphere of post-World War II Soviet subversion and expansionism in Europe and held together for more_than four decades by the fear of Soviet military aggression . But with the Cold_War over , the Soviet_Union dissolved and a supposed era of cooperation and partnership now dawning over the continent , reasonable questions are being raised about NATO ' s continued relevance and future . They deserve careful and credible responses . NATO ' s 16 members , led by the United States , insist that they intend to maintain the organization . What they seem to have trouble agreeing on -- indeed , what they have hardly bothered even to address -- is why . Certainly sharp policy differences growing out of the Bosnia debacle point to the urgent need for a fundamental rethinking of NATO ' s purposes , and to the need for redefining where and how it should be ready to use military_force . Certainly , too , the yearlong study that has just been ordered by NATO to set criteria for expanding its membership ought to deal not only with the mechanics of enlargement . It ought to explain as well why NATO believes it should undertake new security commitments in the absence of any clear cross-border threat to European security . The Czech Republic , Poland and Hungary all are eager to join NATO . Their reasons are obvious . All spent more_than 40 years under Moscow ' s control . All at one time or another rebelled against Communist rule and saw thousands suffer in consequence . All , Poland especially , which was partitioned by Russia four times over two centuries , have understandable historical reasons to fear for their future independence . All want the collective_security NATO offers . But what can ' t be overlooked or dismissed as empty rhetoric is the unease among Russia ' s leadership that NATO ' s potential eastward expansion produces , and the wrath among Russian ultranationalists that it provokes . If the Cold_War is over and Russia is no longer the enemy , Russia ' s top leaders ask , why enlarge NATO and so move its eastern boundary closer to the borders of the former Soviet_Union ? The unspoken answer is that Russia ' s experiment with democracy may give_way at almost any time to a revived authoritarianism with imperial ambitions ; in light of this , now well may be the best time to bring key and potentially endangered eastern European states under NATO ' s protection . President Boris N . Yeltsin professes to be insulted by such an assessment . He accuses NATO , with America in_the_lead , of seeking to redivide Europe . Of course that ' s not Washington ' s -- or NATO ' s -- intention . But at this point it ' s easier to infer what NATO doesn ' t want than what it does . A compelling case for enlargement as something that serves the overall security_interests of Europe -- and of the United States -- has not yet been made . Without it , it ' s likely that the doubts about NATO ' s purposes and its future will only grow .</TEXT>
