   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; MICHAEL MORIARTY ; WHEN FIGHTING AGAINST CENSORSHIP MEANS DEFENDING TELEVISION VIOLENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the fall of 1993 , television executives were feeling beleaguered . On Capitol_Hill , voices in the House and Senate were blaming television for the violence so evident in the streets of America . Congress was threatening the industry with legislation that imposed limits on violent programming , if the programmers didn ' t limit the violence themselves . In October , Atty . Gen . Janet Reno made headlines when she endorsed such legislation . She also told the Senate Commerce Committee that in her opinion , &quot; the regulation of ( television ) violence is constitutionally permissible. &quot; On Nov . 18 , Reno had a meeting with a group from NBC . West Coast President Donald W . Ohlmeyer Jr . was there , as was NBC ' s chief censor , Rosalyn Weinman , of Standards and Practices . Dick Wolf , executive producer of NBC ' s &quot; Law &amp; Order &quot; had been invited , and he ' d brought along one of his stars , Michael Moriarty . Moriarty , who portrayed District Atty . Ben Stone on &quot; Law &amp; Order , &quot; left the meeting steaming and dismayed . He was outraged by Reno ' s conclusion that television was inspiring real-life violence . And he says he was sickened by what he saw as the attorney_general ' s contempt for both television and the U.S. Constitution . Others in the room may have felt the Justice_Department had no business telling television networks what to program -- but only Moriarty went public with his outrage . He called a news_conference and blasted Reno . He took_out ads in the trade papers seeking support for creative expression . His pleas were met with silence . No call from Clint Eastwood . No fax from Sylvester Stallone or Steven Segal . No one else in Hollywood , it seemed , was willing to support Moriarty ' s position that violence has always been an important part of drama . Moriarty , 52 , was raised in Detroit and educated by Jesuits . A Fulbright scholar , he ' s a Tony-award-winning Broadway actor , a published poet and playwright and an accomplished jazz pianist and composer . He has won two Emmys for his television work -- the second for his role as SS Officer Dorf in the miniseries , &quot; Holocaust. &quot; Moriarty lives in New York with his wife , Anne Martin , and his son , Matthew Christopher . Since he began his battle with Reno , Moriarty has resigned from &quot; Law &amp; Order &quot; -- he claims he was being written_out of the show to punish him for his activism . Still , in a business where everything is a career move , Moriarty seems to have landed on his feet . He ' ll open in the Broadway production of &quot; My Fair Lady &quot; on April 8 , as Professor Henry Higgins . But that good_fortune has not cooled his outrage . Question : How did you end_up at that meeting with Janet Reno ? Answer : Dick Wolf ( executive producer of &quot; Law &amp; Order &quot; ) said , &quot; Why don ' t you come_down to Washington with me to meet the attorney_general ? &quot; I said , &quot; What is this -- some stupid photo-op ? &quot; He said , &quot; No , no . If she gets her way , shows like ' Law &amp; Order ' could go_off the air. &quot; And here we are in the fourth year of the show , the ratings have never been better , we ' re starting to get_into a groove , and out of left field comes Janet Reno . On the way down there , I heard it was rumored that the President wasn ' t too pleased with the fierceness of her presentation to Congress on this matter of TV violence . We were told that she might lighten_up , that we ' d have a nice meeting , all go_home and it would be over . But that wasn ' t the case . Q : Why was &quot; Law &amp; Order &quot; singled_out ? A : Janet Reno fired a volley across the bow of network television . Roz Weinman , a censor at NBC , must have called her up and said , &quot; Let ' s sit_down and have a powwow. &quot; It ' s like Bobby Kennedy saying Jimmy Hoffa is involved in racketeering , and Hoffa ' s lawyer saying , &quot; Wait a minute , Bobby , let ' s talk. &quot; But unlike that case , there ' s no law on the books prohibiting violence on television . The attorney_general should be enforcing the law , not policy . To threaten us with unconstitutional legislation -- it ' s an outrage ! Q : Why is yours such a lonely voice in this debate ? Why has no other actor , producer or executive spoken out_in support of your position ? A : The only thing I can think_of is that I came_through the theater -- an ancient art_form . Film is something that came later into my life . I had a Jesuit education , and I consider acting and the theater as kind of a calling -- a vocation . And anyone who assaults it , after 3 # 000 years of history , outrages me . Should we suggest that Al Capone learned everything he knew from George Raft ? The idea that television is responsible_for violence is the stupidest idea since Adolf Hitler said the Aryan race is superior . His psychological tests proving that have about as much credence as the ones that say violence on television causes violence on the streets . It ' s a dangerous notion , because it creates bigotry and fear . The Hollywood community is very insecure about this because television doesn ' t have the history of the theater . They actually think Janet Reno may be right -- that they are responsible_for the violence in society ! Remember , Hollywood helped put Clinton into office . He ' s their man . Look , I voted for Clinton , too , because I thought he was a liberal . I ' m not a liberal anymore . I ' m sick_of it . The President meets with ( CAA chief ) Michael Ovitz and treats Ovitz like he ' s a head_of_state . And yet , Clinton allows Janet Reno to beat_up on television . There ' s no campaign against movies . They go_after television because it ' s like the runt of the litter . I hate going_to L.A. and dealing with the contempt people have for television and television actors . It ' s unbelievable the kind of attitude people take toward what is the most exciting medium we ' ve got right now . Television is the most open , it ' s the most potentially rebellious -- we ' ve got new channels coming_in every day , and young , new people with fresh ideas . But because it is this mass medium and it has to turn_out so_much product , there is a caste_system , and a contempt and self-loathing I despise . Q : Is it your belief that violence in drama is beneficial , that it offers a safe outlet for our dark sides ? A : Violent drama has been a hallmark of every great civilization . It is not the cause of the disease -- it is an immunizing factor . People go_to the theater to experience emotions like fear and loathing . Violent drama shows us where we come from . It makes us face our hypocrisy . We package our food and put it in the freezer , and it looks_like it was made there . But it wasn ' t . The tonnage of living matter we slaughter by the second in_order to keep this race alive would make Caligula blush . Another metaphor -- Holocaust survivor and writer Elie Wiesel . He spent his youth in Nazi camps surrounded by violence . Did that turn him into a maniac ? He won a Nobel Peace Prize . Did the other camp survivors turn_into a pack of Bonnie and Clydes ? No ! They built a nation , because they understood the nature of man . We look_at violence in drama like we look_at a car accident . It ' s a way of coming_to terms with our mortality , and with potential disaster . And for people in Hollywood to actually express shame for what they ' ve done , after it ' s clear from the box_office and the ratings what America wants ? Do we want a government which treats the nation as if we were children ? And that says our actual children are victims of the adults ? that ' s a sick attitude , and it ' s liberal fascism . Q : So do you see this campaign against TV violence as a scapegoat for the government ' s inability to control actual violence in society ? A : I have no doubt . At least 50 % of the violence out there is_due to the war on drugs . The absurdity of this war grows greater every day . Again if you look_at history and the ' 20s , you had the same thing -- the same kind of hypocrisy . Kids on the street became part of the drug cartel in the same way the Purple Gang became part of the bootlegging cartel . Then there is police corruption -- huge in the ' 20 , huge now , going straight up_to the CIA . And people are more afraid of the solution than they are of the problem . Until U.S. Surgeon Gen . Joycelyn Elders stood_up and said we better start looking_at legalization of drugs , nobody wanted to talk_about it . So if there ' s anything good which has come_out of this attack on television , it ' s that people are starting to look_at the real reasons for violence , rather than at the scapegoat . Q : Should there be no limit to what can be broadcast ? A : The limit comes from the audience . I have no complaints with citizens like Terry Rakolta ( head of Americans for Responsible Television ) , who use whatever measures they can -- boycotting advertisers , protesting or writing letters -- to make their views on television violence known . that ' s the way our system is built . But it ' s tougher than going_up the fallopian_tubes to get a show on television -- and the audience votes every half-hour on what they want to see . Q : What do you say to those who say the content of television needs to be controlled because children have access to it ? A : I say that ' s the first_step toward a police_state . If the government places itself within the domestic situation , between the parent and child , and the government says it knows better than the parent how to raise that child , you ' ve really opened_up Pandora ' s box . I think if you open the door to government control of television , then you let_in a host of questions about rights . Mommy ' s secondhand smoke -- which is more dangerous than any television -- are you going_to make her smoke in the bathroom ? Someone who owns guns -- does he have to keep them out of the house from the hours of 6 to 10 p.m. ? If you don ' t trust the parents of America , you don ' t trust America , and you don ' t trust the American system . Because you , Mr. and Ms . Washington , D.C. , are working for us . You are not our parents . And you don ' t tell us we don ' t know what we are doing . Q : I still don ' t understand why , if there is indeed a concerted government attack on television , network executives don ' t go_on the counterattack ? A : They ' re doing the corporate thing . Throw them a bone , pay a ransom and it will go_away -- I ' m almost quoting Dick Wolf verbatim . that ' s the basic attitude : Anything is negotiable . But I wasn ' t built_in the corporate system . I went_in there as an artist . And , suddenly , I felt fear and I heard lies and I began to feel as if I was dealing with the KGB in the Soviet_Union . Q : In another interview , you said it doesn ' t matter if you ever act again . As someone whose life is so_much about acting , how could you say that ? A : Hell , I can make a living -- I ' ll wait tables . One thing I am not is a careerist . Janet Reno would not do what she is doing if her career were not more important to her than her common_sense . Television executives know that this is wrong , but they would lose their job if they went head-to-head with the federal_government . I have the freedom to say , screw it . I can do a little piano here , write books there , whatever . I am not going_to give_up my personal freedom and self-respect for a career . Q : And yet , couldn ' t one say all this has led you back to the theater -- where you began ? A : If someone told me seven months ago that in April I would open in &quot; My Fair Lady &quot; on Broadway , I would have said they were crazy . So I always think_of God sitting_up there saying , &quot; Well , I want to see Moriarty as Henry Higgins . How do we do that ? Let ' s introduce him to Janet Reno ! &quot; It all started there on Nov . 18 . That was the pool_table where my eight_ball landed in the corner pocket . I ' ve shed a veil because of that meeting . Before I was just an artist -- but I stood_up and spoke my piece . I ' m a citizen now . Q : How has all this left you feeling ? Are you optimistic about freedom of expression , or do you fear the government will actually place controls on television programming ? A : I ' m optimistic by nature . I know I will win , just like David knew Goliath was going_to go_down . Because all_the people who ' ve ever called_for censorship in the world have ended_up exposed as villains or clowns . And anyone who stands_up in the Land of the Free and says , &quot; I ' m allowed my own imagination , &quot; is going_to win . They ' re just going_to win .</TEXT>
