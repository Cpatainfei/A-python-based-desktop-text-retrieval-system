   <HEADLINE> PROP . 187 BACKERS ELATED -- CHALLENGES IMMINENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California voters approved the most sweeping and controversial attack on illegal immigration in the nation Tuesday by passing Proposition 187 , a measure that spawned passionate demonstrations , became the dominant issue of the election and promises to continue polarizing the state . With nearly half of the votes counted , the get-tough measure led by a substantial margin . &quot; I think this is a showing of a public attitude , that we as a public are not going_to tolerate illegal immigration , &quot; said the measure ' s co-author , Alan C . Nelson , from his home_in Sacramento . Ron Prince , co-chairman of the pro-187 campaign committee , said the measure ' s success would blossom into similar movements in Arizona , Texas and other states with a substantial illegal immigrant population . Elected officials &quot; have to start doing their jobs , &quot; said Prince at a Republican_Party rally in Orange County , where the initiative had its roots . &quot; We are letting them know with 187 that when they don ' t , we will solve the problem. &quot; Most portions of the initiative , which would deny government funded non-emergency services to illegal immigrants , technically are scheduled to take_effect immediately . However , lawyers representing organizations including the California Medical Assn. , Los Angeles Unified School District and ACLU of Southern California announced late Tuesday that they planned to file a flurry of lawsuits this morning seeking to halt implementation of the measure until state and federal_courts can review its legality . &quot; We thought we could defeat this with the election and if we don ' t do_it that way , we ' ll move_into a different forum , &quot; said Antonia Hernandez , president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund . In any case , the public education ban , which even sponsors of the measure say would require long-term litigation prior to implementation , is not scheduled to take_effect until Jan . 1 . Los Angeles school officials late Tuesday urged students to show_up to school as usual this morning . &quot; We expect them in school , &quot; said school_board President Mark Slavkin . &quot; They can come_to school assured that their immigration status will not be questioned in any way. &quot; As law_enforcement officers remained on tactical alert to guard against potential trouble , workers from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles passed_out leaflets in the Central_City , urging immigrants to remain calm and continue their normal routines . &quot; Don ' t panic . Regardless of your immigration status , you have rights . You have support and we will keep you informed , &quot; the flyer read . Capturing the seething mood of many Californians toward illegal immigration , Proposition 187 caught_fire as the hottest_issue in the state , one with bitter , divisive overtones bound to resonate far into the future . To proponents , the ballot measure was a means to save billions of dollars in state tax dollars and send a message to Washington about the economic and social problems posed by the estimated 1.6 million illegal immigrants in California . Opponents argued that Proposition 187 was a mean-spirited proposal that did nothing to strengthen border enforcement or prevent employers from hiring illegal immigrants . The measure , detractors said , would foster a police_state mentality , in which legal residents are questioned simply because of their accents or skin_color . Championed by Gov . Pete Wilson , and eventually by Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mike Huffington , Proposition 187 held a wide lead in pre-election polls as late as mid-October . But the gap appeared to narrow considerably under a barrage of anti-187 statements from mainstream civic , educational , medical , labor and religious organizations . Also weighing in on the &quot; no &quot; side were leading political figures , ranging from President Clinton to former Republican Cabinet secretaries Jack Kemp and William J . Bennett . In early October , the measure boasted an overwhelming 59 % -33 % lead among likely voters in a Times poll . But as voters increasingly concentrated_on election issues , the margin slipped to 51 % to 41 % two weeks before Election_Day . Under terms of the proposition , one of the most controversial in state history , illegal immigrants will be barred from public_schools and colleges . It also prohibits undocumented residents from receiving any of the limited publicly funded non-emergency health_care and social_service benefits that they have until now qualified for -- including immunizations , prenatal and postnatal care_for women , and foster services for abused children . Proposition 187 also mandates that educational , social_service , public health and law_enforcement officials verify the residency status of students , patients and prisoners . Administrators would be required to turn_in the names of those &quot; suspected &quot; of illegal status to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and the state_attorney general ' s office . The contentious debate about Proposition 187 unfolded against a backdrop of considerable voter discontent about the broad demographic changes -- largely fueled by immigration -- that have drastically altered California ' s makeup since the 1980s . Oft-voiced fears that California was under &quot; invasion &quot; spawned a loose network of community-based groups that banded_together as the California Coalition for Immigration Reform . The Huntington Beach-based coalition became a co-sponsor and key organizing vehicle for the initiative the sponsors dubbed &quot; save our state. &quot; It was co-authored by Nelson and Harold W . Ezell , a pair of former high-ranking INS officials , and Assemblyman Richard L . Mountjoy ( R-Arcadia ) . Opponents disparaged the effort as ill-conceived and underfunded , and the press largely ignored its aggressive signature-gathering efforts . But the Republican_Party and GOP legislators helped_out considerably , pumping more_than $ 100 # 000 into initial efforts . That enabled backers to hire a professional signature-gathering firm and put the initiative over the top with almost 600 # 000 signatures , securing a spot on the November ballot . Organized efforts to fight the measure were slow in forming . In July , a coalition of statewide health , education , law_enforcement and labor organizations hired a veteran Bay Area political consulting firm , Woodward &amp; McDowell , to run the campaign . The group , Taxpayers Against 187 , did not hold its first news_conference until mid-August and did not go_over the $ 1-million mark in campaign fund raising until a month before the vote . The anti-187 campaign strategy , aimed primarily at white voters who make_up the bulk of the state ' s electorate , was the essence of pragmatism -- acknowledging that illegal immigration was a major problem but maintaining that Proposition 187 would make a bad situation worse . Initiative sponsors employed the political equivalent of football ' s prevent defense : Let the &quot; no &quot; side chip_away with its barrage of media events , radio ads and slew of anti-187 endorsements . But do not make any major gaffes and hope that the clock runs_out -- and the ballots are counted -- before the lead changes hands . Leaders of the pro-187 campaign made relatively few public appearances . Rather , backers relied largely on the get-out-the-vote efforts and TV ads of Wilson and the state Republican_Party , the proposition ' s leading advocates . For politicians , Proposition 187 became the defining issue of state elections . Republican Senate hopeful Huffington joined Wilson on the &quot; yes &quot; side and Democratic U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein and gubernatorial challenger Kathleen Brown urged a &quot; no &quot; vote . On a sunny Sunday in mid-October , an estimated 70 # 000 peaceful demonstrators marched from the Eastside to Downtown Los Angeles to condemn the initiative and Wilson . The protest was the largest Los Angeles has seen in decades , surpassing Vietnam War-era demonstrations . But in terms of the November vote , the march was seen as a mixed blessing -- with proponents of Proposition 187 pouncing on the sea of Mexican flags waved by the crowd as evidence of un-Americanism . Another wild card was an escalating series of mainly peaceful walkouts by high_school and college_students opposed to the initiative . Defying calls by campaign leaders and educators to stay in class , more_than 10 # 000 youngsters left their campuses in Los Angeles and surrounding communities on the largest day of protest , less than a week before the election .</TEXT>
