   <HEADLINE> IN BRIEF : NONFICTION ; LIKE HIDDEN FIRE : THE PLOT TO BRING_DOWN THE BRITISH_EMPIRE BY PETER HOPKIRK ( KODANSHA : $ 25 ; 384 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cousins or no cousins , the kaiser hated the_British . They diminished him . So he hatched this Grand Scheme . He would foster a jihad -- a holy war.The Germans would then lead millions of Muslims across the Ottoman Empire through Persia to Afghanistan , whence they would seize India , cutting Britain off at the roots , and knocking_off Russia at_the_same_time . Two could play_at this empire game . It was an end_run around World_War I , and it had its moments , and its men . Wilhelm Wassmuss , for example , &quot; the German Lawrence &quot; in flowing blond mane and Persian robes , Mauser pistol in his sash , who careered about the desert persuading the natives that the Germans really were Muslims . ( The kaiser , he said , had converted , made his pilgrimage to Mecca , and was now called &quot; Hajji Wilhelm Mohammed &quot; ; the entire nation had followed his example . As Punch put it : &quot; Deutschland Uber Allah. &quot; ) Author Peter Hopkirk , on a roll after &quot; The Great Game , &quot; has written another epic of derring-do , played_out from Egypt to Kirghizia and beyond . Exotic settings ; uncommon bravery ; endurance and deceit ; alliances , intrigue , betrayal : these are the components of Hopkirk ' s history -- most often told through the adventures of impossibly intrepid individuals -- and they are stirring tales indeed . P.S. The kaiser lost .</TEXT>
