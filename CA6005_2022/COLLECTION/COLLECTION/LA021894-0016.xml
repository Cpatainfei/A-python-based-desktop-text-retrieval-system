   <HEADLINE> INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT : IT ' S THE PRAYING , STUPID</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a day like any other . We forgot to shave one leg in the shower . We brushed our teeth with the kids ' Sparkle Fun Gel . We explained to a crabby kid why jumping up and down on Mommy ' s stapler would shorten its life . How , we wondered , do the Supermodel Moms do_it ? The producers of &quot; Rolonda &quot; must have read our mind . The talk-show host this week grilled a quartet of Supermodels-Turned-Supermoms : Kim Alexis , Kelly Emberg , Karen Alexander and Linda Tonge . How do you manage to stay so beautiful after having kids ? Personal trainers ? Expensive in-home gyms ? Great genetic material ? No , you dummies . Moral superiority . &quot; We ' re Christians and we pray a lot , &quot; said Alexis , large with_child No . 2 . Then there ' s all us Little People . &quot; It ' s almost like we have a responsibility to the public to maintain a certain image -- so they can strive toward that , &quot; explained Alexis , clearly the ringleader . OK , so Monday , we ' re bleaching our hair and capping all our teeth . Tuesday , we ' ll cut_out sugar and alcohol . By Wednesday , we ' ll have to start praying . * We ' d Rather Just Leave a Tip : How would you like to be hugged by &quot; The Healer Who Hugs Diana &quot; ? that ' s what the London Daily Mail_calls Chryssie Fitzgerald , whose Knightsbridge clinic Princess Di pops into every few weeks for what ' s described as a &quot; two-hour attack on physical and mental stress. &quot; Diana ' s treatment involves so-called Flower Remedies . Concentrated essences are diluted with water , dropped on the tongue or massaged into the body . A foot massage unblocks energy channels . Colonic hydrotherapy unblocks the rest . Fitzgerald ends the session with an embrace -- hence the tabloid-given moniker . * Wanna Thank Your Mother for a Butt Like That : With Jane Fonda now focusing_on the geriatric set ( in the softest-focus infomercial ever filmed ) , there ' s room for young blood in the field of exercise videos . Enter Salt-N-Pepa , the female rap trio that ' s been strutting its stuff in such sexy music videos as &quot; Shoop &quot; and &quot; Whatta Man. &quot; All three -- Salt , Pepa and DJ Spinderella -- have slimmed down and reshaped themselves after recent pregnancies . They begin shooting their &quot; Push It &quot; exercise video in May , and it ' ll be in_stores by October . Don ' t be surprised if others in the hip-hop world make guest appearances . Pepa , after all , is dating Naughty by Nature ' s Treach . Before all this comes_to pass , you can see how fit the trio is in upcoming issues of Entertainment Weekly , where they ' re wearing CK fatigues , and Us , where they ' re looking great in Todd Oldham ' s tap pants and thigh-high boots . * Getting Naked for Charity : We can forbid Mr. Inside Out from bringing_home Playboy magazine . We have no such control over our brilliant-but-misguided girlfriend . Good thing . Otherwise we ' d have missed seeing shoe maker Libby Edelman -- the Libby in Sam &amp; Libby -- cavorting on the beach without so_much as an espadrille between her and the camera_lens . But it ' s cool . Like the nude models in the anti-fur campaign by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( Kim Basinger ' s billboard was unveiled Monday in New York ) , Edelman ' s bare-all is for a good cause . Playboy donated $ 100 # 000 to the American Foundation for AIDS Research to be first to publish fashion photographer Michael Comte ' s suggestive black_and_white photos of Edelman , Shannen Doherty , Sonia Braga , Carla Bruni and Mimi Rogers . &quot; A Safe_Sex Pictorial , &quot; Playboy calls it . Seeing these gals topless made us feel very safe indeed . * What ' s Abstinence Got to Do With It ? : For those who can ' t get enough vintage clothing , an L.A. company is reviving an age-old accessory : the chastity belt . Chastity Inc. claims its Fashion Accessory Belt &quot; is designed to address today ' s styles and sensibilities. &quot; But not in a very serious way , we ' re afraid . Although the belts come_with lock and key , &quot; it ' s all_in fun as the belts are easily removed without the keys. &quot; Ah , a politically correct chastity belt ! Clearly , though , we ' ve missed the point completely . Turns_out these belts have a higher calling . &quot; Our fashionable society will appreciate an accessory that opens the door to interesting conversation that reflects today ' s concerns. &quot; Hey , is that a chastity belt you ' re wearing or are you just glad to see me ? * Post-Traumatic Tress Syndrome : Hair oilier than usual ? You can blame it on the earthquake . So says Bernard Virginie , technical director of the Parisian diagnostic hair-care firm J.F. Lazartigue . After recently analyzing strands of L.A. women under a Microviewer at the company ' s Rodeo Drive salon this week , &quot; We saw a lot of hair that was weak and greasy. &quot; Quake-related stress may have cranked_up oil_production , he theorized . Lazartigue treatment products are meant for home hair-care enthusiasts , and items are 20 % off through February . But you can have the stuff applied in a salon setting , too . Employees of the Beverly Hills salon Cristophe are being trained this week under the watchful eye of Jean-Francois Lazartigue himself . They will also have a Microviewer on_hand to show you your very own hair_follicles -- up close and personal . Sounds terrifying .</TEXT>
