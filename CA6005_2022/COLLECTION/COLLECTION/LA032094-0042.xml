   <HEADLINE> SCARS AND SECRETS : THE ATOMIC TRAIL ; ALONG THE NATION ' S BOMB-MAKING CIRCUIT , ILLNESS AND POISONED LAND MARK THE COLD_WAR ' S LETHAL LEGACY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a dark winter day , five elders eat a quiet lunch in the tribal Chapter House in Red Valley , Ariz. , a dry corner of the Navajo reservation where most everything is dusted with the windblown earth . The meal is traditional mutton stew . The conversation , shared_in the soft sound of Navajo , is filled with grief . These men , who dug uranium that powered America ' s nuclear arsenal , have watched in anguish as more_than 100 of their friends and family -- all uranium miners -- have been slowly killed by lung disease linked to radiation . And in the past week , lung_cancer has claimed two more from their community of less than 2 # 000 people . &quot; They knew what they were doing to us , &quot; says former miner Russell Jackson . A tall man dressed in drab coveralls and a baseball_cap , Jackson sits on a folding_chair and stares at the floor as he speaks . A translator turns his words into English . &quot; They didn ' t tell us uranium was used for bombs . They didn ' t tell us it would make us sick . But they knew . We were expendable. &quot; Officials knew of the radiation hazard in the mines as early as 1951 , but strict regulations protecting miners were not set until 1969 after congressional hearings on the issue . &quot; The doctors were told not to tell them of the dangers , and they didn ' t , &quot; says Dr. Louise Abel , who works for the U.S. Public Health Service on the reservation . &quot; An entire generation of men in some villages was decimated for the country ' s nuclear effort . It ' s an epic tragedy. &quot; Similar stories have echoed across the country in the communities that composed the front_line of the Cold_War . Uranium traveled thousands of miles as it was transformed from rock to bomb , and documents from inside the weapons complex indicate that at many stops along this route , radiation was released during accidents , deliberate experiments and routine operations . Though bomb production has ceased , all_the major facilities are now toxic-waste sites -- among them some of the most contaminated places in the Western World -- and estimates for the 40-year task of cleaning_up the pollution , which will be lethal for centuries , exceed $ 500 billion . It is impossible to be certain about how the radiation releases will affect the health of the more_than 1 million people exposed . But all along the atomic trail , which stretched from coast to coast , communities feel and fear the ravages of radiation-related illness . &quot; Trust in the government and science has been a casualty for these people , &quot; says Dr. John W . Gofman , a former government expert in radiation and health who is now an outspoken critic of the bomb makers . &quot; A terrible political betrayal has taken_place , &quot; he adds . &quot; Increased disease will occur because of it. &quot; As early as 1949 , federal_officials knew that radiation could be causing cancer in workers and people living near weapons plants . However , because virtually everything to do with atomic weapons manufacturing was classified as secret , much of the debate over radiation and health was kept_from the public , which was , instead , reassured about radiation ' s safety . &quot; We were in a Cold_War that was real , &quot; says Newall Stannard , an expert in radiation and health who worked_on many Atomic Energy Commission projects in the early years . Bellicose leaders of the former Soviet_Union promised to &quot; bury &quot; the West , and the Soviets often matched or exceeded the United States in the race to build ever-more-horrifying weapons . The press reported on the competition to build better bombs and rockets as if it were an actual war . And to many people inside and outside of government , nuclear annihilation seemed possible at any moment . &quot; There was a real sense of urgency , &quot; Stannard says . &quot; People believed that things had to be done and done quickly to keep the effort going . And because of the pressure to do things fast , &quot; he says , &quot; many of us in the health and safety area weren ' t listened to. &quot; Data on radiation found in communities near the bomb facilities was not widely disseminated . Health studies were often not followed_up_on . After two decades of radiation releases at the Hanford nuclear_weapons facility in Washington , for example , doctors examined 5 # 500 children who lived nearby , but did not monitor them to see if any radiogenic illnesses developed later . &quot; They were treated like guinea_pigs , &quot; says Robert Schaeffer , a spokesman for the Military Production Network , a nonprofit national alliance that represents citizens groups at more_than a dozen nuclear sites . &quot; The government made an effort to study these people after they died , but did not protect them adequately from exposure . It looks_like a massive experiment. &quot; The contamination that poured from the bomb factories and test sites during four decades dwarfs the radiation exposures in the medical experiments -- many subjects were radiated without their knowledge or consent -- that have received wide publicity recently . The government ' s top nuclear_weapons official , Secretary_of_Energy Hazel R . O ' Leary , acknowledges that the lethal legacy of the atomic complex &quot; is a much bigger problem. &quot; The Cold_War warriors did provide defense during the decades of dread . But , adds O ' Leary , they also failed to safeguard the public from the more immediate hazards created by the production and testing of atomic weapons . &quot; They thought they could control it . They didn ' t recognize the danger , &quot; she says . And as more of the hidden history of the arms race is revealed , additional secrets -- about radioactive pollution and experiments -- may emerge . &quot; There ' s more to be discovered , &quot; she adds . &quot; that ' s the thing I most fear. &quot; What is known about the sins of the nuclear past is frightening enough . After two decades of pressure , Congress acknowledged in 1990 that workers and innocent bystanders at the start and end of the atomic trail had been harmed , even killed , by radiation-linked diseases . Uranium miners who have certain cancers or lung disease , which can be caused by radon gases in mines , are paid $ 100 # 000 from a special federal program . Similarly , exposed soldiers or people who lived under the billowing mushroom_clouds when aboveground nuclear tests were conducted in Nevada in the 1950s receive $ 50 # 000 if they develop certain cancers linked to the fallout . So far , more_than $ 117 million has been paid to more_than 1 # 600 of the sick and dying . But thousands of others who lived elsewhere along the atomic trail believe that they were irradiated , too . They also are seeking compensation through the courts . At least five suits are pending and more may be filed by workers or neighbors at any of a dozen other sites . In each case , the lawsuits have been filed against the companies that ran the facilities . But the real target is the federal_government , which , according to its contracts with the corporations , must pay all legal_fees and any judgments . Legal fees alone are running in excess of $ 20 million a year . In most cases , people exposed to radiation from the bomb complex generally allege only that they now have an increased risk of cancer . Experts seem to agree that whenever significant amounts of radiation are involved , risk is increased . But it is difficult to prove that an individual ' s disease was caused by a specific source -- uranium miners with lung_cancer , for instance , may have used tobacco ( which the miners ' compensation program takes_into_account by raising eligibility requirements for heavy smokers ) . &quot; Unfortunately , cancers don ' t come_with a tag that says , ' I ' m from Hanford , ' &quot; says Tom Bailie , who has helped organize a suit against the operators of the Hanford complex . &quot; But I think we know enough to say when someone ' s risk has been significantly increased without their permission. &quot; Health studies that can more precisely measure the effects of the radiation exposures have commenced in areas near atomic_bomb factories , but the results are years away . Nevertheless , experts such_as Gofman are certain that the nuclear enterprise has spread disease across a wide area . Gofman , now a professor emeritus at UC Berkeley , helped discover Uranium-233 , founded the biomedical lab at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in Northern California and was part of the Manhattan_Project . But he gradually became one of the nuclear complex ' s harshest critics because , he says , his warnings were ignored . &quot; There is no such thing as an absolutely safe dose of radiation , &quot; he says . &quot; They took risks , risks they had no right to impose on people without their knowledge. &quot; &quot; The best science takes_place in a very open environment , &quot; adds Secretary O ' Leary . And in the bomb complex , she says , &quot; just the opposite occurred . Secrecy was the watchword of the day. &quot; With the Cold_War over , O ' Leary wants to declassify documents and open the agency to outside scrutiny . Her openness has raised expectations along the bomb-making circuit , where many see her efforts to tell the truth about medical testing -- and the resulting public furor -- as a sign that their experiences will become the focus of national concern . &quot; There are far too many people who have died and are_sick now for them to just be ignored , &quot; says Janet C . Gordon , whose brother died of cancer in 1961 , after repeated exposures to fallout near the Nevada test site . &quot; There is a lot of attention being paid to the medical tests that were done , and they were serious . But I don ' t want people to forget what happened here . Multiply what they did to our family by thousands of families . They knew what they were doing . There ' s no excuse for it. &quot; THE URANIUM MINERS AT the Chapter House in Red Valley , remember spending long days in the excavations breathing cool air that was filled with invisible , odorless radon gases . They recall eating their lunches in deep tunnels that branched in every direction and ended in large caverns where the &quot; working face &quot; was broken with tools and explosives . They drank the water that trickled out of exposed underground springs , and some went_home to houses built from the radioactive rocks discarded from the mines . &quot; We didn ' t know what we were mining was for the military or the atomic_bombs , &quot; says former miner Kelewood Yazzie , who is now almost 70 . &quot; We knew that production counted . That was it. &quot; A prospecting frenzy had erupted in the Southwest in the 1940s and ' 50s as the government ' s demand for the raw_material for atomic_bombs soared . Soon after , studies funded by the federal_government discovered radiation levels many times higher than what was considered safe . But decades passed before the government developed rules to protect the miners . At the Chapter House , the miners say that in the late 1960s , many of their number developed lung_cancer , virtually unheard of in Navajo territory until the uranium rush . It took about 10 years for them to surmise what was happening and pursue claims against the government , supporting their case with medical research that showed excess cancer for workers in their industry as early as 1964 . But the courts ruled that the government could not be sued because the mines were operated for national security purposes . Lawyers for the miners , led by former Secretary_of_the_Interior Stewart Udall , subsequently petitioned Congress for compensation . In 1990 , the miners and their families were included in the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act , in which Congress admitted that they were endangered and agreed to pay $ 100 # 000 to each miner who could prove he had worked in the mines for an extended period_of_time and developed lung_cancer or other respiratory_diseases . The Justice_Department , which runs the program , estimates that 18 # 000 miners , nearly all_of them in the Southwest , were exposed to radiation and are potentially eligible for payment . But thousands who labored in the mills where the uranium_ore was crushed and refined into what ' s called &quot; yellow cake &quot; are not covered by the act , though many claim that they , too , were exposed to radiation . Of the 3 # 000 Navajos who worked in the uranium mines , more_than 400 have died of lung disease , reports Timothy Benally , manager of the Office of Navajo Uranium Workers in Shiprock , N.M. , which helps the miners file compensation claims . Benally says that proving a miner ' s length_of_service has been a challenge . Documenting illnesses can be difficult because local health clinics still do not have equipment that will detect all types of lung ailments . &quot; A lot of men die before they know their claim is going_to be approved , &quot; says Benally . So far , only 133 Navajo compensation claims of 301 filed have been granted . ( Fourteen hundred non-Native American miners have also been paid. ) In many cases , the children of deceased miners have taken_up their claims . On the day the Navajo elders meet in the Chapter House , Helen Johnson , a former case worker for the Office of Navajo Uranium Workers , is out on the windswept reservation visiting her clients . As she drives down the rutted dirt roads of Red Valley , Johnson recalls the slow death her father suffered when he was just her age -- 31 . &quot; He was always getting sick , &quot; she says . &quot; Then a_couple_of other miners died and my mother got real scared. &quot; Johnson ' s father died in 1970 , leaving five children between the ages of 3 months and 7 years . Her mother struggled to keep the family together as a single parent in a poor community . &quot; She hasn ' t really been the same since my father died , &quot; Johnson adds , tears trickling down her cheeks . The dying has continued . Last month , Helen Johnson attended the funeral of her uncle , 64-year-old Ray Joe Sr. , another uranium miner , another victim of lung_cancer . The funeral and service took_place in the shadow of the mountains where the uranium mines were dug . THE URANIUM THAT WAS seized from the earth in the Four Corners area of the Southwest was shipped east to be processed into fuel for bombs . At various stages , the rock was turned_into uranium hexaflouride gas , enriched and converted into a metal . Until 1970 , most of this work was done at facilities in Kentucky , Ohio and central Tennessee , at two of the Oak Ridge plants . Once a secret government-owned community , Oak Ridge was built to supply enriched uranium for the Manhattan_Project , a job that once consumed one-seventh of the electricity produced in the United States . Oak Ridge , population 30 # 000 in 1950 , was protected by gates and fences until after World_War_II , when the city was opened_to the world . Through the years , officials monitored many radioactive releases and traced contamination . But in a place where almost everyone ' s livelihood depended_on the nuclear enterprise , few challenged the government ' s assertions that the public and atomic workers were perfectly safe . Yet last November , a state report noted that 1988- ' 90 cancer rates in Anderson County , where Oak Ridge is located , were &quot; significantly higher &quot; than the rest of the state . As she navigates Oak Ridge ' s winding roads to visit her doctor , Janice Stokes points to telltale landmarks that an outsider might miss : an incinerator that burns atomic waste , signs warning that creeks and ponds are poisoned , a ball_field that was capped with extra soil to protect players from mercury contamination from an Oak Ridge plant . Stokes notes that some of the deer , frogs and even trees on the site are radioactive . ( These problems have been confirmed by state and national officials. ) She believes that Oak Ridge has contaminated her , as well . &quot; I ' ve never worked near uranium , but I ' ve got_it in my urine , &quot; she says . Stokes , born and raised seven miles from Oak Ridge , suffers from lupus and osteomalacia , a painful degenerative bone disease . &quot; I ' ve gone steadily downhill for the past eight years , &quot; says the slightly built , soft-spoken woman of 47 . &quot; There ' s just too_much unexplained illness around here. &quot; Stokes ' doctor , oncologist William K . Reid , agrees . Reid joined the local hospital staff in 1990 , and &quot; right away I was dealing with five kidney cancers , &quot; he says . &quot; I would n ' t expect to see more_than one in a population this size. &quot; Medical literature and consultations with outside specialists led Reid to suspect that radiation and other pollution from Oak Ridge facilities contributed to the illnesses he was treating -- high rates of thyroid disease , immune disorders and cancers . ( All of the kidney cancer patients were workers who had been exposed to radiation , he recalls. ) But Reid says that every effort he made to raise concerns and conduct research in the hospital on Oak Ridge radiation and health was blocked . &quot; For years they had an unspoken policy that said doctors do not talk_about this , &quot; he says . &quot; Once I started talking_about this , I stopped being the doctor that they had tried so hard to recruit. &quot; Methodist Medical_Center spokeswoman Nancy Harrison says Reid was never impeded in his research or discouraged from speaking his mind . And ophthalmologist Francis Reid ( no relation ) , who was chief_of_staff until 1991 , says that in his 15 years at Oak Ridge he saw no evidence that physicians were reluctant to discuss radiation and health . Still , there are some who believe that the medical_community may have been conditioned to sidestep the issue . The city ' s only hospital was originally built and run_by the Atomic Energy Commission . At the Department_of_Energy , the commission ' s successor , officials confirm that doctors in Oak Ridge were expected to adhere to the code of secrecy that began in Manhattan_Project days . &quot; In a system like that , &quot; says a senior policy adviser to the secretary_of_energy , &quot; those who questioned the existing order were purged. &quot; Documents do show that the Atomic Energy Commission was deeply concerned in the 1950s about any claims relating to radiation exposure and illnesses . Such claims were reported to headquarters , and information about the cases was strictly guarded . But today , people such_as William Reid who have raised doubts about the record of the Oak Ridge facilities have some evidence to support their fears . A study of more_than 8 # 000 Oak Ridge workers turned_up elevated leukemia rates . The report , published in 1991 in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. , found a correlation between the cancer and radiation exposure and suggested that the risk associated with long-term , low-level radiation is higher than previously believed . Experts have long known that a sudden large dose of radiation can kill , sometimes quickly . But they have debated the effect of lower doses received steadily over long periods_of_time . Late last year , the Tennessee Department of Health confirmed that Oak Ridge had frequently emitted radioactive elements and heavy metals into the environment . For decades , federal monitors had tracked the releases in the air and water off-site and even monitored the level of radiation in garden vegetables and milk collected near Oak Ridge . The state report included descriptions of numerous radiation releases that could , in the final tally , reach more_than 1 million curies since the Manhattan_Project . ( In contrast , the Three Mile Island power_plant accident involved about 17 curies and prompted the evacuation of thousands of people. ) The Oak Ridge report recounts a long list of incidents in which radiation escaped_from a nuclear_reactor called the X-10 and from other facilities . But it did not estimate how those living downwind or downstream -- more_than 46 # 000 people lived_in the study area near the Oak Ridge plants in 1960 -- may have been affected . A follow-up study is under way . This research is of great interest to William Reid and his patients , who would welcome any new information . &quot; As children , we went_to the Museum of Atomic Energy they had here and they gave us all radioactive dimes . We laughed about it . The safety was just something you didn ' t question , &quot; says Shirley Harkins , 39 , who grew_up 10 miles from Oak Ridge and suffers from thyroid disease . &quot; We were told that there was no problem , but we can ' t trust that now. &quot; FARTHER ALONG THE ATOMIC TRAIL , IN FERNALD , OHIO , 18 MILES OUTSIDE Cincinnati , the innocuously named Feed Materials Production Center turned enriched uranium into fuel that was sent to atomic_reactors for final conversion to plutonium . With its odd name , some locals thought the plant made feed for livestock . This impression was reinforced , no doubt , by the fact that a local dairy was allowed to pasture its herd on some of the plant ' s property . While the rolling acres outside the plant may have seemed pristine , in fact the landscape was polluted with more_than a_million pounds of uranium . Inside , work areas were often contaminated by uranium dust . According to the documents of the company that ran the Fernald plant , officials were aware of the contamination and damage to the workers ' health as early as 1952 . One memo from that time called_for an end to practices that allowed many workers to be exposed to radiation levels higher than the plant ' s own standards . A second referred to 17 workers who were exposed to uranium and reported that all &quot; showed urinary damage &quot; and was followed a year later by a report that conditions had &quot; gone from bad to worse &quot; because supervisors had focused &quot; chiefly on production requirements. &quot; A 1960 report found workers exposed to radiation levels 97 # 000 times higher than the plant ' s limit . On the basis of such information , more_than 6 # 000 former employees are suing the operators of the plant for endangering their health . The workers ' claim that radiation exposure frequently exceeded health standards and that they suffer excessive risk of cancer is contested by Kevin Van Wart , the attorney for Fernald ' s former operator , NLO Inc. The workers want a formal health program , but Van Wart says that it would be unnecessary because it would offer &quot; nothing they don ' t already get from family doctors. &quot; NLO no longer operates the Fernald plant and it exists only as a shell of a corporation . Its main activity is fighting the lawsuit , with its legal defense funded entirely by the federal_government . Nevertheless Van Wart feels a moral commitment to defend the people who once managed Fernald . &quot; These are real people who live_in the Cincinnati area and they are emotionally affected by what has been said about them , &quot; he adds . He doubts that the government will agree to a settlement . &quot; I want to go_to trial , &quot; he says , &quot; because I think we would win on the scientific merits. &quot; Van Wart says the plant was safe and that scientists would testify that the radiation to which the workers were exposed was not dangerous . In 1988 , federal_officials admitted that Fernald had emitted thousands of tons of radioactive waste into the air , the ground_water and a local river as part of routine operations . The revelations came as the government agreed to pay $ 78 million to end a lawsuit filed by Fernald ' s neighbors . Under the terms of the settlement , people who live near the plant will be compensated for the loss of property value and the psychological pain of not knowing what effect the radiation may have_on their health . Payments have started at $ 16 # 000 for distress and have topped $ 500 # 000 for loss of property values . As part of the settlement , the Department_of_Energy is also funding research to estimate the radiation dose received by the approximately 28 # 000 people who lived within a five-mile circle outside the Fernald fence . The particles of radioactive material released at Fernald could be dangerous if ingested , which is what Angie Supe fears happened to her husband , Terry , who was raised 2 1 / 2 miles downwind from the uranium plant . He drank rainwater from a cistern beside the farmhouse . Last October , he died of kidney cancer , the same cancer William Reid is treating in several Oak Ridge patients . Terry Supe was 40 . On the country lane where her husband grew_up , eight cases of cancers have been found in six households . Terry &quot; was healthy , had no risk factors , and they were putting uranium out all_the time he was growing_up near the plant , &quot; says his widow . &quot; Now he ' s gone and my daughter is so young she ' s going_to forget him pretty soon . If you ask why , you have to consider the plant. &quot; A similar connection is being made by workers and neighbors at Ohio ' s other major atomic facility , the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant near Piketon . Hidden on 3 # 800 acres of trees and hills , the 10-million-square-foot plant is described by the Government Accounting Office as &quot; among the largest industrial facilities in the world. &quot; Beginning in 1954 , it had provided enriched uranium for Fernald , which closed_in 1989 . And thousands of pounds of uranium have been released into air and water around the plant . Like the residents of the Fernald area , the neighbors of the Portsmouth plant want compensation for contamination , declining property values and the potential health effects of the pollution . More_than 300 people have signed_on to yet another suit , which attorneys say is still more_than a year away from trial . If a settlement similar to the Fernald agreement is reached , it would likely provide medical monitoring and compensation for more_than 15 # 000 people who have lived near the plant . THE HANFORD ATOMIC WEAPONS PLANT IN WASHINGTON STATE BECAME the world ' s largest nuclear complex after World_War_II , with nine reactors that turned the fuel from Ohio into plutonium , which was then refined and set along the atomic trail to be fashioned into bombs . The community surrounding Hanford , known as the Tri-Cities , takes_pride in its Cold_War role . One of the cities , Richland , was built by the government and embraced its image as an atomic city . People there still bowl at Atomic Lanes and shop_at Atomic Foods . The Richland high_school teams -- the Bombers -- still use the mushroom_cloud as an insignia and , until recently , the symbol of the atom adorned the granite pillars at the entrance to the Richland cemetery . But Tom Bailie and his family were less exuberant in their embrace of the region ' s nuclear identity . They didn ' t move_into a home next door to the Hanford atomic weapons complex in Washington state ; the bomb makers came_to them . In 1942 , as the Manhattan_Project began its race to make the first atomic weapons , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers purchased the land next to the Bailie farm in the town of Mesa , along with acreage up and down the Columbia_River -- a total of more_than 560 square_miles . Tom Bailie was born in 1947 , three years before the first reactor began operating , at a time when local health authorities were recording an increase in stillbirths . Bailie was sickly as a child and suffered from respiratory problems . At age 5 he endured a mysterious paralysis and survived only with the help of an iron_lung . Much later he discovered he was sterile . Though the Atomic Energy Commission assured the public that all was right at Hanford in the late ' 40s and early ' 50s , roughly 1 million curies of radiation were being released into the environment . Scientists have already determined that the Bailies and their neighbors , who lived directly across the Columbia_River from Hanford , probably received the largest dose of radiation that left the site . It came_in the air they breathed , the water they used to irrigate their farms , the local food they ate . Throughout its 40-plus years , Hanford technicians tested all_of these &quot; pathways , &quot; which carried the contamination to the human_body , and found radiation in every one . No warnings were ever issued . &quot; We were like guinea_pigs , &quot; says Bailie , now 47 . He has thick gray hair and bright_blue eyes . As he talks , he looks_out_over hundreds of acres of apple_trees and beyond to the Columbia_River and then the hulking concrete carcasses of Hanford ' s now-defunct reactors . &quot; I was given thyroid exams in school . And thousands of kids were put_through whole body counters so they could check for radiation . Where are they now that people are_sick ? &quot; In the early 1980s , Bailie began to collect stories about deformed animals , stillbirths and cancers , and he began asking questions about Hanford . Activists from as far away at Spokane and Seattle joined the debate , met by intense opposition from Tri-Cities residents who ' d drawn their identity from the atom and placed their faith in government assurances about the reactors ' safety . But even as the angry confrontations unfolded , the government began declassifying reports that showed the extent to which Hanford had irradiated the region ' s air , water and land . Accidents , routine dumping and experiments had poured radiation into the environment even as officials claimed that no pollution left the site . The Hanford releases included a 1948 experiment in which as much as 11 # 000 curies of Iodine 131 , known to be especially harmful to children , was intentionally released into the air . Known as the &quot; Green Run , &quot; this experiment was intended to simulate plutonium production methods in the former Soviet_Union so that instruments used on spy planes to detect the enemy ' s production levels could be calibrated . The secret Green Run spread radiation as far north as Spokane and south into Oregon . A study similar to the ones under way at Oak Ridge and Fernald will attempt to tell citizens like Bailie precisely how much radiation they received . Preliminary reports suggest that as_many as 20 # 000 children who lived downwind from Hanford were hit by a significant amount of radiation -- the equivalent of 30 chest X-rays -- in the late 1940s and early 1950s . Another 250 # 000 people lived_in the direct path of the radiation releases . A larger health study involving the actual examination of about 2 # 000 people who lived near Hanford during radiation releases , is also being conducted . In the meantime , plutonium production has ended . Hanford is now the country ' s largest environmental restoration project with a budget of about $ 2 billion a year and 15 # 000 workers . More_than 2 # 000 people have joined a &quot; downwinders &quot; lawsuit that seeks compensation for those exposed to the plant ' s emissions . They want medical monitoring and compensation for pain and suffering . So far the federal_government has paid $ 20 million for the lawyers defending the companies that operated Hanford and are named in the suit . It is not expected to go_to trial until 1995 . THE NEVADA TEST SITE , 50 MILES NORTHWEST OF LAS VEGAS , WHERE ABOUT 100 bombs were detonated above the ground between 1951 and 1963 , was the last stop on uranium ' s journey to oblivion . Before getting_to Nevada , the material that had become plutonium at Hanford was milled at Rocky Flats , near Denver , and placed in a weapon at a facility near Amarillo , Tex . Rocky Flats has been the site of widely publicized radiation pollution and incidents in which workers were exposed to radiation . Local citizens also claim to suffer health effects caused by the bomb factory . In 1981 , one researcher , Carl Johnson , reported elevated cancer rates in an area around the plant that includes much of Denver . Johnson , whose work has been challenged by other researchers , suggested that significantly higher cancer rates occurred in the neighborhoods closest to the facility , where about 40 # 000 people lived during the heaviest releases . But it is the people who live downwind from the Nevada test site who have become the symbol of all that went_wrong in America ' s rush to build the biggest and best nuclear arsenal . They felt the rumble and saw the blossoming mushroom_clouds produced by the tests . They were among the first to say that something might be wrong . And their struggle for recognition and compensation shows just how difficult it may be for other groups to win redress for what was done to them by the bomb complex . It took more_than a decade of litigation and negotiation before the government finally admitted that it was the likely cause of Arlene Davis ' breast_cancer . Davis , who recently underwent a mastectomy , grew_up under the clouds of radioactive fallout that drifted from the Nevada test site across southern Utah . Born in 1955 , she and more_than 60 # 000 others living_in parts of Utah , Nevada and Arizona were exposed to significant fallout radiation from the bombs that were detonated , as Congress has acknowledged . &quot; We used to eat dinner on our back lawn to watch the fallout clouds roll in , &quot; Davis says . &quot; They told us we were safe . And if we saw the clouds , we ' d call the whole neighborhood to watch . I remember my mother taking her finger and drawing_on the dust that fell on the cars. &quot; Government documents confirm that the Atomic Energy Commission was made aware of the fallout hazard in 1946 , before the testing began in Nevada . Reports by one of the commission ' s health experts , Dr. Stafford Warren , warned that even minute bits of fallout material absorbed by a person ' s body could produce cancer years later . &quot; This is an insidious hazard and an insidious lethal effect hard to guard against , &quot; Warren wrote . He advised the commission to discuss the danger openly , but instead , officials conducted an extensive public-relations_campaign , showing films to schoolchildren to calm their fears about the bomb_blasts and distributing booklets to communities near the test site that described local citizens as participants in atomic science . &quot; Your best action , &quot; one booklet advised , &quot; is to not be worried about fallout. &quot; As early as 1961 , studies of the downwind population suggested that Warren ' s predictions were coming true . Though held secret by the Atomic Energy Commission , the report found excess leukemia in the part of southern Utah that had received heavy amounts of fallout from the bomb tests . Such studies fueled a landmark campaign that year in which a limited group of test-site downwinders , alleging that the government had been negligent in its atomic testing , sought damages for illness related to the fallout . If the case prevailed , it would establish government responsibility for the safety of people living near bomb-complex facilities and open the door for lawsuits all across the country . At trial , attorney Stewart Udall , the former Interior_secretary , relied_on a convincing expert witness , Dr. Joseph Lyon , a University of Utah epidemiologist who discovered a 300 % increase in childhood leukemia in the fallout region . Udall also used testimony from a former Public Health Service officer , who told the court that the Atomic Energy Commission had doctored his reports on fallout to cover_up exceptionally high radiation readings in populated areas in southern Utah and obscure the fact that schoolchildren playing_at recess were exposed . The trial_court judge ruled_in favor of some of Udall ' s clients , but the decision did not stand . In 1988 , an appeals court found the government was immune to downwinders ' claims , as it had been to the uranium miners ' , under laws protecting its actions in the area of national defense . The Supreme Court agreed . Frustrated and angry , Udall went_to Congress , where he had served as a representative in the 1950s , to make one last plea . And this time he prevailed . In 1990 , the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act became law , providing both an apology and $ 200 million for uranium miners and the downwinders . Anyone who lived_in the downwind area during the Nevada tests and develops one of several cancers is eligible for the program . More_than 800 claims have been paid since 1990 . Arlene Davis submitted her claim under the act two years ago . &quot; Last February ( 1992 ) I ' m getting_in the bathtub and I see this big lump , &quot; she says . &quot; On April third I had the operation . My mother told me right away that I should get the papers together and file them because the fallout was probably the cause. &quot; She was paid $ 50 # 000 , but &quot; of course , &quot; she says , &quot; it doesn ' t make_up for what has happened to me , for losing a breast . You feel it every time you look in the mirror . Money can ' t make_up for that. &quot; THOSE LOOKING FOR A WAY_out of the morass of legal and moral issues surrounding America ' s nuclear legacy may consider the approach used by Udall for the miners and test-site downwinders . In that instance , Congress was persuaded to act because of the moral weight of the historical facts . Energy_Secretary O ' Leary says that some people in Congress are interested in righting the wrongs done to others along the atomic trail . But aides to Sen . John_Glenn ( D-Ohio ) , who chairs the committee that oversees weapons factories , say that no compensation is being considered now though they may be interested in the coming months . Still , O ' Leary has held public meetings in the past few months with groups of downwinders , irradiated workers and whistle-blowers . She has also met privately with families who believe that they have been stricken by illness and death caused by the bomb complex . &quot; Previous secretaries never met these people and I think that was a mistake , &quot; O ' Leary says in an interview . Some of these meetings have been emotionally wrenching , she says , but she sees them as a necessary part of healing the past . &quot; President Clinton recognizes this is a serious problem , &quot; she adds . &quot; He has spoken_to me about it several times. &quot; Nevertheless , one of the most seasoned legal minds in this arena remains skeptical . Stewart Udall began fighting for radiation victims in 1978 , and he has found what he calls &quot; a galling attitude toward this issue &quot; in every administration since . All along , he says , &quot; the Justice_Department has played ' smash-mouth hardball , ' trying to deny the claimants everything they could. &quot; &quot; Hazel O ' Leary may be sympathetic , &quot; he continues . &quot; But the key department is the Justice_Department . I have tried to get ( Atty . Gen. ) Janet Reno ' s attention but have not gotten a response. &quot; O ' Leary ' s spokesman , Michael Gauldin , says the entire Administration supports O ' Leary ' s efforts to right the wrongs ot the nuclear past . &quot; Secretary O ' Leary and Atty . Gen . Reno and budget director Leon Panetta have talked_about these issues and they are supportive of her , &quot; he says . However , Gauldin says , the compensation program for miners and test-site downwinders is &quot; not a model &quot; for resolving other claims &quot; but something to learn from. &quot; The Administration is moving &quot; methodically because we know people don ' t trust the government , &quot; he says , adding that any future attempt to help people injured by the weapons complex &quot; will not be just monetary , but would include something like medical monitoring and something as simple as an apology. &quot; Udall is pleased that a high-level committee has been formed by the White_House to investigate the bomb complex , but he wonders &quot; if they ' ll go_into a closet for a year until all_the furor subsides. &quot; &quot; There ' s an old saying in law : ' Justice delayed is justice denied , ' &quot; Udall says . &quot; I ' m afraid that is something that could easily happen in these cases . In a sense , it already has. &quot; * 1 . For 18 years , Navajo uranium miners in Red Valley , Ariz. , were not informed by the government about the radiation hazards of their work . More_than 100 in a community of less than 2 # 000 have died of lung diseases linked to their exposure . 2 . Uranium from the Southwest was shipped to sites including the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee , where it was enriched -- refined and blended . Radiation releases from the site over three decades were 59 # 000 times higher than that at Three Mile Island , and officials are conducting studies to determine the effects on those who lived_in the area . 3 . In Fernald , Ohio , the uranium was processed into fuel that would be sent to atomic_reactors and converted to plutonium . The government has admitted that the plant emitted thousands of tons of radioactive waste into the air , and current and former workers are suing the Fernald plant operators for endangering their health . 4 . The Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant near Piketon , Ohio , also supplied enriched uranium to Fernald . It , too , released thousands of pounds of uranium into the air and water , and 300 people are seeking compensation for potential health effects of the pollution , as well as declining property values . 5 . The fuel from Ohio became plutonium at the Hanford Atomic Weapons Plant in Washington state . Though the government repeatedly told residents that there was no danger , recently declassified reports show that the plant released roughly a_million curies of radiation . Cleanup cost for the site : $ 2 billion per year . 6 . Plutonium from Hanford was milled at Rocky Flats , near Denver , which manufactured the balls of uranium and plutonium used to trigger the bombs ' nuclear chain_reactions . 7 . Facilities around the country shipped parts to the Pantex plant in Amarillo , Tex. , where the final assembly of nuclear_weapons took_place . 8 . Aboveground nuclear tests at the Nevada test site exposed more_than 60 # 000 people to fallout radiation while the government reassured them that the blasts were safe . Childhood leukemia in the fallout region increased 300 % .</TEXT>
