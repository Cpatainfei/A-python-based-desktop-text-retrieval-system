   <HEADLINE> INVESTIGATORS BACK WITH LOAD OF EVIDENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Investigators in the Denise Huber murder case Tuesday unloaded a rental truck packed with evidence and embarked_on the painstaking process of examining &quot; every shred &quot; of suspect John J . Famalaro ' s personal effects seized from the Arizona home where Huber ' s body was found in a freezer . Among other things , investigators hope to determine whether the 37-year-old house_painter had ever met the 23-year-old waitress before she was abducted from the side of the Corona del Mar Freeway on June 3 , 1991 . Authorities also are seeking evidence that would confirm that Famalaro , a former Lake Forest resident , was in the Orange County area at the time Huber vanished . &quot; We ' re pretty confident that he was in the Orange County area during the 2nd and 3rd of June ( in 1991 ) , which is when she disappeared , &quot; said Costa Mesa police Lt . Ron Smith . &quot; But we ' re looking_for any kind of receipt , phone_bill , letter , canceled check , anything that would give us a time and a date and a location , and anything that would somehow connect him with Denise before the disappearance that would explain their encounter , &quot; Smith said . &quot; Is it just chance that her tire goes flat and he happens to be driving by ? Or had he been following her ? &quot; Huber ' s friends and family , and some police investigators have speculated that the former UC Irvine student may have known her assailant , or mistaken him for a law_enforcement officer . Bogus Los Angeles County sheriff ' s deputy shirts were found during a search of Famalaro ' s home_in Arizona , authorities said . Famalaro is being held without bail in the Yavapai County , Ariz. , Jail pending his extradition to Orange County . Arrested July 13 after Huber ' s body was discovered inside a freezer inside a stolen rental truck at his Arizona house , Famalaro faces first-degree murder_charges in connection with the kidnaping and slaying of the Newport Beach woman . He could be eligible for the death_penalty if convicted . Orange County prosecutors also filed murder_charges against Famalaro last week after preliminary DNA testing indicated bloodstains at a Laguna Hills warehouse facility rented by Famalaro matched Huber ' s blood . Famalaro has not yet entered a plea to the latter charges , but he has pleaded not_guilty to the Arizona charges . Using a rental truck of_their_own , police_detectives over the weekend packed up reams of evidence taken from Famalaro ' s home and drove to Orange County . While Huber was buried next to her grandfather in South_Dakota Tuesday , police here peeled open the truck and began sorting through evidence , much of which they already looked through once in Arizona . Among other items , the 17-foot truck was filled with hundreds of boxes of documents , papers and personal effects . Police also unloaded the suspected murder weapon -- a nail-puller that was previously described as a crowbar -- the freezer in which Huber ' s body was found , Huber ' s clothes and other belongings , as well as a refrigerator found inside Famalaro ' s house . Authorities predicted it would take weeks to pore through it all . &quot; We ' re looking through every shred of paper to see if there ' s any significance to it at all , &quot; Smith said . Of the refrigerator , Smith said detectives are looking_for clues that would indicate whether Huber ' s body was stored there while Famalaro awaited delivery of a freezer he had ordered from an Orange County Montgomery Wards store shortly after Huber ' s disappearance . &quot; There ' s about a nine-day gap , &quot; Smith said . Orange County Assistant Dist . Atty . John Conley said Tuesday the extradition process is underway , but that it could take weeks before completion . &quot; The paperwork ' s being prepared_for the governor ' s office , &quot; Conley said . Famalaro ' s lawyers said they haven ' t decided whether to fight extradition . A hearing on the_matter is scheduled to take_place in Arizona on Aug . 29 . Conley said prosecutors have not yet decided whether to take the case to the Orange County Grand_Jury for a possible indictment , which would speed_up matters . Conley acknowledged that culling the evidence could take some time . &quot; The image we have of him ( Famalaro ) is that he was a pack_rat . He kept everything , &quot; Conley said . &quot; It ' s a tedious process. &quot; Deputy Public_Defender Leonard Gumlia said Tuesday his office is gearing_up for the Famalaro case and is prepared to begin poring over the evidence and volumes of documents in the case as soon as possible . &quot; There is a lot there , &quot; Gumlia said . &quot; It could take weeks , more likely months. &quot; Gumlia said it is too soon to begin discussing defense strategies but said he anticipates asking to move the trial from Orange County . &quot; We will be looking_at a change-of-venue motion in this case , &quot; Gumlia said . &quot; It ' s gotten_to the point where ( Denise Huber ) is referred to in headlines as ' Denise. ' It ' s in all_the papers . It ' s everywhere. &quot; Gumlia said he is concerned that the media storm surrounding the story could unfairly sway potential jurors . He said he would also be concerned if prosecutors seek a grand_jury indictment against Famalaro , because it is possible that grand jurors have also been following the case in the media .</TEXT>
