   <HEADLINE> WINE : HAILING A CAB</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you ' ve toyed_with the idea of starting a wine_cellar , you might want to start soon . The current vintages of California Cabernet Sauvignons are among the best I have tasted . Once you get a taste of some of the best recent Cabernet Sauvignons from California ' s north coast regions , it ' s difficult to avoid buying a_few bottles and stashing them away for a_few years . Because of the moderate heat and lack of rain at harvest_time , 1990 and 1991 produced some terrific wines . Some believe that 1985 and 1987 were better , but the voluptuous 1990s and the deep , classic 1991s are my favorites . * Moreover , carefully selected 1989s ( an improperly maligned vintage ) can be great values . The most remarkable thing about the 1990 and 1991 wines is the amount of fruit they contain ; this means that if you age the wines five to 10 years , there still will be fruit left when you drink them . By then , much of the astringency will have gone , making the wine smoother and less gritty on the palate . However , the texture of these wines already is so appealing there is a temptation to drink them now . I have tasted a wide range of 1990 and 1991 Cabernets in the past two months and find the 1990s drinkable now , with plenty of room for improvement in the bottle . The ' 91s are deeper and loaded with concentrated fruit , but almost all need more time in the bottle to smooth_out . * An interesting thing occurred after my blind tastings . Normally , I leave most of the bottles on a counter for another day or so to see if the aeration helps or hurts the wines . Usually , about half the wines of any group begin to oxidize after a day , a_few are about the same , and a couple are actually improved . In the case of the 1991 Cabernets , almost all_the wines were better after being open a day on the counter . This isn ' t proof , but a strong indication that the wines are built to age . This has occurred , I think , because in most regions , the grapes in 1991 were harvested more_than a month later than usual , meaning they had marvelous vine-ripened flavors and could be bottled without any of the manipulations that winemakers occasionally use to extract flavor from less-mature fruit . The following wines , which are listed in no particular order , are all exceptional . 1989 CABERNETS Shafer Vineyards &quot; Hillside Select &quot; ( $ 35 ) -- Rich , dark fruit , concentrated blackberry / cassis and mint aromas and a dense , tart finish . Anyone who thinks 1989 produced wimpy wines should try this one . Seen discounted as low as $ 23.99. Iron_Horse Vineyards and Winery ( $ 14 ) -- Marvelously aromatic wine with hints of tarragon and cherry mixed with a black-cherry note . The winery recently reduced the price of this wine because of negative comments by some people about the 1989 vintage . Robert Pepi Winery &quot; Vine Hill &quot; ( $ 18 ) -- Herbal , green_pepper hints add complexity to a black-cherry and anise aroma . Though the flavor lacked a bit of fruit , the next day the wine showed well . 1990 CABERNETS Spottswoode Winery ( $ 36 ) -- Deep black-cherry fruit with nuances of cedar and a great , powerful finish that is so tasty you ' ll want to drink it now . An excellent wine that ' s nearly sold_out . Even better is the amazingly complex and complete 1991 version , which will be released about Sept . 1 . Place your orders . Liparita Winery ( $ 28 ) -- Deep fruit and dense , chewy flavors , fairly tannic , but with the stuffing to age well . Joseph Phelps Vineyards &quot; Backus &quot; ( $ 30 ) -- Very concentrated black_cherry and mint , dense color and almost overwhelming extract , yet with enough grace that it ' s nice to drink now . Another powerful Backus Cabernet . Beringer Vineyards &quot; Private Reserve &quot; ( $ 35 ) -- Another powerhouse wine from Ed Sbragia . Deep , dense cassis aromas , spiced-mint and chocolate tastes . A massive wine with a long track record of_aging . Domaine Michel ( $ 12 ) -- Herbal-cherry notes , plenty of oak , lots of fruit , but a little one-dimensional . Needs two more years to smooth_out , but a good value . Mount Veeder Winery ( $ 16 ) -- Herbal notes dominate the initial aroma , but there ' s good fruit and structure here . It tasted best the next day . Husch Winery &quot; North Field Select &quot; ( $ 18 ) -- Minty / cherry aroma and a deep fruit taste . A wine for the short term , but with great flavors . 1991 CABERNETS Staglin Family Vineyard ( $ 26 ) -- Slightly more herbal than the marvelously currant-like 1990 Staglin , this wine offers more complex flavors and more depth . Stunning wine for the next century . Frog ' s Leap Vineyards ( $ 17 ) -- Intense dark fruit aromas and flavors , nuances of herbs , and a luscious , very complex finish . As great a wine as Frog ' s Leap ' s amazing 1987 , and a bargain . ( Approximately 7 # 000 cases were produced and it was just released. ) Silverado Vineyards ( $ 17 ) -- Racy cherry and herb elements are closed_in when the cork is first pulled , but a bit of air opens the wine to reveal wonderful depth and a graceful texture . Nearly sold_out . Clos du Bois ( $ 12.75 ) -- Fairly smoky / oaky aroma still offers a load of fine fruit and ample depth for a wine so reasonably priced . Probably not very long-lived , but marvelous flavors . Lockwood Winery , Monterey ( $ 14 ) -- Earthy , faintly green-leafy aroma with good cherry-like fruit and enough richness to drink now ; excellent aging potential .</TEXT>
