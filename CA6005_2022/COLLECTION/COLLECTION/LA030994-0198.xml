   <HEADLINE> EX-CARTER AIDE NAMED WHITE_HOUSE COUNSEL ; PRESIDENCY : CLINTON ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES FURTHER STAFF CONTACTS WITH FEDERAL REGULATORS ON WHITEWATER AFFAIR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton on Tuesday enlisted eminent Washington lawyer Lloyd N . Cutler in the effort to safeguard the reputation of the White_House , even as he acknowledged that his staff had several previously undisclosed contacts with federal regulators about the Whitewater controversy . In announcing that Cutler would serve as special counsel to the President for 130 days , Clinton said that the additional contacts were incidental , involving mostly follow-up phone_calls and informal , hallway conversations about earlier meetings . They had &quot; nothing to do with the substance &quot; of the regulators ' case , Clinton asserted in a press_conference that served as a forum for his second lengthy discussion of Whitewater in as_many days . White_House aides declined to provide further elaboration about the contacts , which came_to_light as Administration officials searched their files , trash baskets and phone logs to comply with a request from Whitewater special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr . for any documents related to the Whitewater matter . With the selection of Cutler , who 15 years ago served in the same role in the White_House of President Jimmy_Carter , Clinton is turning again to a consummate Washington insider . Introducing Cutler in the White_House briefing room , Clinton said the 76-year-old lawyer-lobbyist is a man of &quot; seasoned judgment , impeccable professional credentials and the highest ethical standards . . . . I wanted a Lloyd Cutler type of lawyer , so I just decided I would go_to the original first and see how I could do. &quot; The Whitewater special counsel was appointed by Atty . Gen . Janet Reno to investigate the President and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton ' s partnership with the owner of a failed savings and loan in an Arkansas real_estate company known as the Whitewater Development Corp . Among central questions that Fiske will try to answer is whether funds of the S &amp; L were used to pay_off campaign debts of then-Gov . Clinton and whether its funds were diverted to Whitewater . Aides left open the possibility that a review of the documents will unearth still more contacts between White_House aides and regulatory officials , although they insisted that those too would be incidental . The issue of contacts between White_House aides and regulators has given_rise to new and troubling questions about Whitewater , suggesting that White_House officials were meddling in an official inquiry or at least improperly benefiting from information gleaned from it . The question of improper contacts with investigators , along with other political missteps , forced the resignation Saturday of White_House counsel Bernard Nussbaum . Cutler ' s temporary appointment will give the White_House time to find a permanent replacement as the President ' s counsel . Cutler , describing himself as a senior_citizen , said he had to &quot; negotiate hard &quot; to ensure that he would not have to remain in the intensely demanding job for more_than a_few months . He said that , although he would fulfill all_the duties of the position , he would concentrate_on &quot; the procedures and actions necessary to maintain public confidence in the integrity and the openness of the presidency. &quot; &quot; Trust is the coin of the realm , &quot; he said , adding that he thought Nussbaum &quot; had a lot of bad luck. &quot; Cutler said he had &quot; put a limit on how long I would stay , in part because I know how tough a job this is and I know how old I am , in part because I ' m married fairly recently ( three years ) to a very young and peppy wife and I want to spend some more time with her. &quot; The 45-minute press_conference -- carried live_by four networks -- was another effort by Clinton to demonstrate his willingness to tackle difficult questions . Smiling and even joking as he fielded dozens of queries , Clinton insisted : &quot; I ' m very relaxed about this . I didn ' t do anything wrong . There ' s nothing here. &quot; Without making a firm commitment , Clinton suggested that he has no intention of invoking &quot; executive privilege &quot; to prevent release of any White_House documents . The protection is designed to guard the presidency from undue scrutiny by other branches of government . &quot; I have no idea what will come_up but it is hard for me to imagine a case in which I would invoke it , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; My interest here is to get the facts out. &quot; Later , Clinton , Mrs . Clinton , Vice_President Al Gore and his wife , Tipper , met with White_House staff_members in an East Room session designed to bolster spirits and to encourage the staff to rise above the Whitewater turmoil . In his press_conference , Clinton shed more light on how he may have learned of an Oct . 8 meeting in which White_House officials were notified that the Resolution Trust Corp. , which is overseeing the liquidation of failed savings and loans , would seek a Justice_Department investigation of Whitewater . Questions have been raised about whether Clinton learned of the request before it became public and thus gained the knowledge improperly . On Monday Clinton said he &quot; probably &quot; learned of the request from Bruce Lindsey , his aide and longtime confidant , although he added : &quot; I literally don ' t remember. &quot; On Capitol_Hill , meanwhile , Republicans kept_up their pressure for special Whitewater hearings , rejecting Democratic arguments that a congressional inquiry would only compromise Fiske ' s investigation . Republicans on the House Banking , Finance and Urban Affairs Committee released a list of 40 witnesses that they hope to call to testify at a March 24 hearing on the performance of the RTC . The list resembled a Who ' s Who of the Whitewater controversy , from senior White_House aides to RTC officials and members of the Rose Law_Firm in Little_Rock , Ark. , where Mrs . Clinton was a partner . Among the witnesses the Republicans hoped to call are White_House Chief_of_Staff Thomas ( Mack ) McLarty ; Deputy Treasury_Secretary and RTC head Roger Altman ; Nussbaum ; James B . McDougal , owner of the failed Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan ; his ex-wife , Susan McDougal , and Hillary Clinton aides Margaret Williams and Lisa Caputo . Clinton said he would try to cooperate if Congress decides to conduct hearings on Whitewater . If Congress ignores Fiske ' s request that it convene no hearings because of the danger to future prosecutions , &quot; then I think that ' s something we would have to take very seriously , &quot; he said . &quot; My inclination would be to obviously participate. &quot; Aides said that , although other names of candidates were discussed as Nussbaum ' s replacement , Cutler was the most serious contender from the beginning . The President and top aides discussed the choice over the weekend . On Sunday night , McLarty visited Cutler at his home , then returned with him to the White_House about 8 p.m. for a two-hour conversation with Clinton . On Monday , after sleeping on the issue , Clinton told McLarty to offer Cutler the job . Cutler , wealthy from a long and distinguished legal career , said he had offered to serve without compensation . He said he is considering suggestions that he accept a salary and donate it to the U.S. Treasury to help reduce the deficit , or take a $ 1-a-year salary . But he asserted that , although he would not leave his law_firm -- Wilmer , Cutler &amp; Pickering of Washington -- he would observe all federal ethics rules designed to prevent conflicts_of_interest . Cutler has long been associated with liberal causes but has represented so many interests over his long career that his ideological identity is not always easy to discern . He has been retained by the leading lights of American industry , from IBM to the Big Three auto_makers , whom he helped to avoid threatened car-safety rules that they opposed . His work_on behalf of corporations has prompted angry denunciations from consumer advocates , such_as Ralph Nader . He startled Democrats by unsuccessfully pushing for the Supreme Court nomination of conservative appeals court Judge Robert H . Bork during the Ronald Reagan presidency and he championed the unsuccessful attorney_general nomination by Clinton of Zoe Baird , a Democrat who worked for him at the White_House . His long and varied career has also given_rise to certain ironies . In their health_care reform efforts , the Clintons have made drug_companies one of their favorite targets . But their new lawyer was hired in 1962 by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn . to head_off efforts in Congress to control drug prices . In a related development , a Rose Law_Firm courier in Little_Rock , who has told a grand_jury that he helped shred documents from the files of the late White_House deputy counsel Vincent Foster , said Tuesday that the order to do so came_after Fiske had announced that his investigation would include the circumstances of Foster ' s apparent suicide , the New York Times reported in today ' s editions . Jeremy Hedges , a part-time employee of the firm , told the newspaper that he shared the chore with another courier , Clayton Lindsey . Both couriers have said that they told grand jurors that they knew the papers belonged_to Foster because the box and the file_folders inside bore Foster ' s initials . Both couriers said they saw many of the papers they shredded and none mentioned Whitewater . Ron Clark , a Rose partner and its chief operating officer , confirmed in an interview with the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday that documents were destroyed after Fiske ' s appointment but said they had nothing to do with Foster or the Whitewater case . Clark said four Rose firm witnesses -- two clerks and two lawyers -- are willing to verify as much under oath . The account of the shredding provides no strong evidence of wrongdoing but does fuel speculation about a possible cover-up . The documents apparently were destroyed before Fiske issued a subpoena for documents in the case . Foster had worked_on Whitewater matters , as a member of the Rose firm and later at the White_House . Times staff writers John M . Broder and Michael Ross contributed to this story . Broder reported from Little_Rock and Ross from Washington . Profile : Lloyd N .
