   <HEADLINE> HOT SALSA ; STOKING THE FIRE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A couple of months ago , one of the food-fear stories that periodically stampede the public made the news rounds . This time a study was said to have shown chile peppers to be associated with stomach cancer . Some people started looking uneasy at lunch and waving away the hot_sauce . The story eventually died_down . People went_back to thinking_of chiles as an excellent source of vitamins -- raw peppers , even mild ones , are among the most concentrated sources of Vitamin_C in nature , and ripe red_peppers are among the best for Vitamin_A . And it should be noted that the stomach cancer rate has declined in this country over the last 20 years , while chile-eating has quadrupled . The cancer scare was evidently just a blip in the rising trend of chile consumption . Even five years ago , hardly anybody had ever heard of the Scoville test . ( For those who still don ' t know , it measures the strength of a pepper by dilutability ; a ranking of 5 # 000 Scoville units means you could dilute a sample of the chile in_question with 5 # 000 times as much water and still taste hotness. ) Today , hot_sauce makers casually boast about their Scoville ratings , confident that whether or not people know exactly what they mean ( and the Scoville test is notoriously subjective ) , Scoville units in the thousands are what chile-heads want to hear about . At the moment , the habanero pepper is the hottest chile available , either fresh or bottled . The chile writer Jean Andrews reports , however , that there are chiles in South_America that make the habanero look_like a bell_pepper , so it ' s only a matter of time before we see aji rocoto in our supermarkets . Eventually we ' ll find , or gene-splice , absolutely the hottest_pepper in the world , and what will the chile-heads do then ? They ' ll still have new territories to explore . After all , in its natural_state , the hot_stuff in chiles -- a group of chemicals called capsaicinoids -- is diluted with all sorts of inessential ingredients such_as , oh , vitamins and flavoring elements . Those who really want to set their mouths on_fire , throw their metabolisms into a whirl and pop sweat from their brows like Donald Duck can start messing with the pure item : industrial capsaicin extract . The rest of us will probably settle for a medium burn , an appetizing aroma and nutrients , stuff like that . * The combination of chipotle peppers and balasmic vinegar in this recipe is nothing short of inspired -- the smoky peppers complement the vinegar , its slight sweetness balances the peppers . This marinade would make a great sauce for any kind of barbecue . The recipe comes from Bruce J . Auden of Restaurant Biga in San Antonio , Texas , who recommends serving it with a salad of watercress , julienned jicama and orange segments dressed with hot_pepper oil . To garnish the chops decoratively with the mint cream , he uses a plastic ketchup-type bottle . From &quot; Red Hot Peppers &quot; by Jean Andrews ( MacMillan : 1993 ) .
