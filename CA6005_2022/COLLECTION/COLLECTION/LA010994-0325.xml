   <HEADLINE> SAN DIEGO FIRM PROVING GROUND FOR DEFENSE POSTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the likely elevation of Bobby Ray Inman to secretary_of_defense , an innovative , employee-owned company specializing in military contracts will find itself with some of the most powerful connections Washington has to offer . Assuming he is confirmed by the Senate , Inman will become the fourth member of the board of directors of Science Applications International Corp . to get a top Pentagon post within the last year . Since last spring , two other board_members have become deputy and assistant defense_secretaries , while a third was tapped as a contracting deputy and is responsible_for monitoring contracts between the government and private firms . The San Diego-based firm ' s close ties to the new Pentagon leadership illustrate the extremely tight web of relationships inside the modern military-industrial complex , where defense experts frequently move_back_and_forth between the public and private sectors . But even by those standards , the connection between Science Applications and the federal_government is extraordinary . Jack Modzelewski , a defense analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York , said he knows of no other defense_contractor with so many former board_members now inside the Pentagon hierarchy . &quot; It looks_like they ' re a good training ground &quot; for future government service , he said of the firm . &quot; It looks_like they are something you need on your resume. &quot; Some defense analysts attributed the elevation of Science Applications directors to the company ' s status as a premier defense research firm , noting that the 16 # 000-employee organization has more government contracts -- 4 # 000 -- than any other firm in the nation . With its reputation for aggressiveness and innovation , their argument goes , it is only logical that the company should attract some of the industry ' s best and brightest -- who also would be strong candidates for top Defense_Department jobs . But others contended that , given the potential for conflicts_of_interest -- or even the appearance of such conflicts -- the unusually powerful relationship bears watching . &quot; They ' re obviously a very influential company and they ' re a far-reaching company , &quot; said Keith Rutter , assistant director of the Project on Government Oversight , a Washington public-interest group . &quot; They have a lot of political influence. &quot; Rutter and other government and defense analysts said that since members of the firm ' s board have begun arriving so recently and because Inman ' s nomination is still being considered , it is too early to tell how the relationships will be perceived -- or what , if anything , they will mean for the company or the government . But they also said that Inman ' s directorship with Science Applications will likely be a subject of discussion during his confirmation_hearings , which begin Jan . 25 . Inman has said he would not comment about any defense-related issues until after the confirmation process . Likewise , Pentagon administrators were reticent to discuss the relationship between the Defense_Department and the firm . &quot; We are going_to decline to comment on this , &quot; said Capt . Michael Doubleday , a Pentagon spokesman . &quot; I don ' t think that we would have anything that would be meaningful to say. &quot; The company ' s ties to Washington are indeed impressive . * Inman , a board_member for 12 years , was nominated last month by President Clinton to run the Pentagon . A retired Navy admiral , he headed the National Security Agency under President Jimmy_Carter and served as deputy director of the CIA under President Ronald Reagan . At Science Applications , he has chaired the board ' s executive committee . He is expected to tender his resignation when his Pentagon appointment is confirmed by the Senate . * William J . Perry was a board_member of the firm for six years before he was tapped last year to join the Pentagon in the No . 2 slot as deputy secretary_of_defense . He was considered a candidate for the top job before Clinton chose Inman to succeed Defense_Secretary Les Aspin . * John M . Deutch was a board_member for 13 years but left Science Applications to become undersecretary of defense for acquisition and technology . In that role , he has developed a high public profile for his work researching the causes of the mysterious post-Persian Gulf War maladies reported by men and women who served in the conflict and for renegotiating the contract for development of the troubled C-17 cargo plane . * Anita K . Jones , a board_member for six years and former professor and chairwoman of the Department_of_Computer_Science at the University of Virginia , serves as a contracting deputy at the Pentagon under Deutch . She reviews defense contracts to assure that private companies meet Pentagon standards . Perry , Deutch and Jones , who have long been considered experts in the defense field , were nominated by the White_House and came_to the Pentagon to serve under Aspin . They have been considered key players in his attempts to retool the military at the end of the Cold_War . Under government procurement rules , Science Applications will not be precluded from continuing to bid for military contracts . While the company ' s connections could gain it preferred treatment in the awarding of highly lucrative contracts , Inman and the other former Science Applications directors at the Pentagon could find themselves under so_much pressure not to show favoritism that the relationship ultimately could do the firm harm , company officials say . Mark Albrecht , Science Applications ' senior_vice_president for government relations in Washington , suggested that the company actually could lose some defense work because the new Pentagon leaders will be &quot; bending over backwards &quot; to show there are no conflicts_of_interest . &quot; It ' s a very mixed blessing , &quot; he said . &quot; On the one hand , we are very proud to have people associated with our company that are so attracted to the Administration , and at_the_same_time know our company well. &quot; But he predicted that because of the unique relationship , Inman , Perry and the others will use an &quot; abundance of caution &quot; in any future dealings with Science Applications . Lorenz A . Kull , the company ' s president and chief operating officer , agreed , pledging that the firm will be careful about not expecting special treatment or drifting into appearances of conflict_of_interest . &quot; To quote a familiar phrase , &quot; he said , &quot; the Queen of England must_not only be virtuous but she also must be perceived to be virtuous. &quot; But an official from another defense contracting firm , who asked not to be identified , said that because Science Applications is one of the premier research and development firms in the nation , it would be a loss to the government if they are excluded from future Pentagon work . &quot; In the specialized areas of research houses , they have a dominant position , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m not sure who could up them in this field , irrespective of what their situation is with who is at the top of the Pentagon administration. &quot; While it remains to be seen what if anything will come of the current ties between Science Applications and the Pentagon , it is unclear whether special connections were any help to company officials two years ago , when the firm was charged with falsifying the results of test samples taken from Superfund hazardous waste sites . The case , which erupted in 1991 and before the latest company board_members went_to Washington , became what one prosecutor called &quot; the largest environmental fraud fine we ' ve had here. &quot; During the investigation , Melvin R . Laird , another board director and a former secretary_of_defense , wrote a letter to then-Atty . Gen . Dick Thornburgh , asking him to delay the prosecution . In his hand-delivered letter marked &quot; personal , &quot; Laird wrote that &quot; there was no wrongdoing on the part of the corporation. &quot; He went_on to mention that &quot; President ( George ) Bush recently recognized three of our directors &quot; with appointments to the President ' s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board , a six-member group that evaluates work by U.S. intelligence agencies . The three were Inman , Perry and Deutch . &quot; He ( Laird ) was trying to tell the Justice_Department that we were not a bunch of crooks , that they were dealing with ethical people , &quot; Kull said . Ultimately , in a settlement agreement in U.S. District Court here , the company pleaded guilty to seven counts of making false_statements to the Environmental Protection Agency and three counts of making false claims for payment . &quot; They were taking_in more samples than they could do , &quot; said Melanie K . Pierson , the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case . &quot; They were more interested in money than they were in health and safety concerns. &quot; Six employees were terminated after an internal investigation by the company found that no senior managers were involved in the scheme . Nonetheless , the company was ordered to pay $ 1.3 million in restitution and penalties . In announcing the heavy fine , federal Judge Rudi M . Brewster called the episode an example of &quot; corporate greed &quot; and said he wanted to make_sure the company accepted its share of the blame . &quot; Is this going_to be a situation where the ( employees ) were , in a sense , victims of the corporate greed ? I don ' t know any other way to describe it. &quot; Kull acknowledged that the whole episode was a grave mistake . &quot; It was an absolute embarrassment , &quot; he said . &quot; It was not a good time for us. &quot; But the episode appears to have been the only public blemish on the company ' s otherwise successful record . Science Applications was founded 25 years and today , about 91 % of its work is in federal_government contracts . But base closings and defense conversion have had a sharp impact on the firm ' s military work . Eight years ago , 68 % of its work was in defense and national security fields . That figure is now down to 51 % . Still , company revenues are predicted at $ 1.5 billion this year . The company has taken_on a number of non-defense contracts , such_as developing automated highway toll booths in California and Florida . Other projects have included new technology for fossil_fuels , systems to monitor pollutants on the ocean_floor and programs to turn air_pollution into fertilizer . The company ' s most ambitious defense project , begun in 1986 , is the $ 1-billion program to computerize the medical_records at all 700 of the military_hospitals and health clinics around the globe . John H . Warner , executive_vice_president and a board director , predicted that the new military_hospital computer_system , just two years from completion , eventually will save taxpayers up_to $ 2.6 billion . Company technicians are also providing rugged , battle-ready laptop_computers for the Army and Marine Corps . Company officials said they have so many government contracts because , unlike most other contractors , they bid on almost every research and technological project that is proposed by defense , environmental and other federal agencies . &quot; We ' re always trying to diversify and become more balanced in our work with the federal_government , &quot; Albrecht said .</TEXT>
