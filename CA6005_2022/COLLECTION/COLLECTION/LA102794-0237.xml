   <HEADLINE> 2ND MEDFLY SPRAYING DRAWS LITTLE PROTEST ; MALATHION : AS LATEST AERIAL ASSAULT TAKES_PLACE , MANY RESIDENTS SAY THEY ARE LESS ANXIOUS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO . BUT SOME STILL FEAR HEALTH RISKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three helicopters laden with tanks of bug-killing malathion lifted_off from the Camarillo Airport on schedule Wednesday night , beginning the second aerial spraying over Ventura County ' s 16-square-mile Medfly eradication zone . With a thunderous beating of blades , the helicopters circled above 10 sign-toting protesters who congregated at the airport to demonstrate against spraying insecticide over the homes of 32 # 000 people in Camarillo and Somis . &quot; There they go , sweet dreams Camarillo , &quot; said protester Anne Engelstad , 38 , of Thousand Oaks . As she watched the helicopters fly in formation toward Camarillo , she turned_to her 8-year-old son . &quot; It ' s just spooky , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' ve never seen anything like this in my life. &quot; During the four-hour incursion , the helicopters executed the second in a series of twice-a-month aerial assaults scheduled through April to knock_out any future generations of the crop-destroying pest . After experiencing a similar spraying two weeks ago , some Camarillo residents said they felt more comfortable knowing what to expect . Two weeks ago they thought they would awaken to a sticky film on every surface , but found it difficult to see the pesticide residue . &quot; It doesn ' t seem like such a hardship , &quot; said Kathy Cardenas of Camarillo , picking_up her two children from elementary_school Wednesday afternoon . But other residents , particularly the parents of young children , voiced greater concern about the long-term health effects of malathion . Debbie Jacobs of Camarillo took her 6-year-old son to a girlfriend ' s house in Ventura to spend the night , as she did two weeks ago . &quot; He has asthma , &quot; she explained . &quot; I ' m extremely concerned about the possible health effects . It scares me . There are no studies that show this is safe for people. &quot; Some residents complained they are already tired_of draping their cars with plastic to protect paint jobs , pulling patio furniture into garages and hosing_down their back yards to protect pets from the sticky sweet mixture of corn_syrup and insecticide . &quot; It ' s a headache , &quot; said Harry Becker , 80 , a Leisure Village resident frustrated that a 9-by-12-foot tarp wasn ' t big enough to cover his 1987 Cadillac . He improvised with plastic bags . &quot; Our freedom is being invaded in_order to protect the profits of the grower. &quot; Mayor Ken Gose said he has heard very little outcry from his constituents since the first aerial spraying on Oct . 12 . &quot; The first time there were quite a_few people who were upset , &quot; Gose said . &quot; They ' ve calmed_down considerably. &quot; Unlike the first aerial spraying , the pesticide-laden helicopters on Wednesday were not chased by a thick flock of copters from TV news stations . That came as a relief to some agriculture officials who were alarmed at the crowded skies two weeks ago . &quot; It scared a lot of residents , &quot; said Carla Agar , spokeswoman of the California Department of Food and Agriculture . &quot; We were telling them it was only going_to be three helicopters , and instead it looked_like Armageddon. &quot; * This time , the three helicopters loaded with 120-gallon tanks and joined by an observation helicopter set_off on their expedition into skies clear of clouds and air traffic . Light winds did not affect the mission , although ground_crews placed white cards strategically around the perimeter of the spray zone to detect if the orange-brown mixture drifts out of the set boundary . During the Oct . 12 spraying , none of the cards picked_up wayward drops of malathion and corn_syrup . But an internal flight recorder on one of the three Bell helicopters showed that a spray nozzle was not turned_off until the helicopter was 50 to 60 feet outside of the northeast corner of the spray zone . Doug Hendrix , a spokesman for the Cooperative Medfly Project , said the over-spray occurred over an orange orchard , and not over a residential_area . The spraying Wednesday was the second of as_many as a dozen such aerial attacks scheduled over the next 5 1 / 2 months to combat the infestation and preserve the county ' s lucrative citrus sales to Japan . The agricultural crisis began on Sept . 29 when authorities discovered two fertile female Medflies in a fig_tree at St . John ' s Seminary . Over the next week , traps caught a total of 63 Medflies , all but one on seminary grounds . * Medfly larvae not only destroy oranges and avocados and other fruit , but the presence of the pest can scare_off foreign countries that pay top dollar for the choicest fruit . Japan was considering banning fruit from California because of the infestation , said county Agriculture Commissioner Earl McPhail . But he said a visiting Japanese delegation , impressed with initial eradication efforts , agreed to limit the country ' s ban to fruit grown in an 86-square-mile quarantine zone that covers most of Camarillo . In preparation for Wednesday night ' s spraying , hundreds of Camarillo residents picked_up plastic tarps from a local agriculture group to protect their cars and outdoor furniture . Meanwhile , Clint McCaslin and other custodians covered a large sandbox at Las Colinas Elementary School , anchoring the plastic with sandbags . Half a dozen volunteers promised to help scrub the pesticide from tables and jungle gyms this morning . * Several Ventura hotels offered a special , one-night Medfly rate , and each received up_to half_a_dozen reservations from Camarillo residents . The Doubletree Hotelreported reservations from Camarillo were slightly higher two weeks ago . At the airport Wednesday night , 10 residents staged a low-key protest behind a fence that protected the helicopters ' staging_area . The demonstrators set_up a card_table and handed_out flyers titled &quot; Malathion Spells Murder. &quot; The congregation included members of the Group Against Spraying People . Some carried signs , saying &quot; Don ' t Spray People , &quot; &quot; Spray your property , not mine , &quot; and &quot; Wilson ' s emergency is now our emergency. &quot; &quot; I think they ' ve blinded Camarillans for too long , &quot; said Beth Fraley , 32 , who moved from a rented house in Camarillo with her two children to a house in Oxnard . She said she needed to escape the spraying after experiencing health_problems two weeks ago . &quot; They don ' t want the truth to be out because it will scare everybody , &quot; she said . In addition to a handful of news reporters , the protest attracted one Green Party congressional candidate and a counterdemonstrator who is running_for the Thousand Oaks City_Council . Agriculture officials said they had anticipated some residents would protest aerial spraying of malathion , as has been done_in other communities . But they expected it would be short-lived . &quot; Over a period_of_time , the protests decrease , &quot; said Agar , who has helped coordinate aerial sprayings in other communities . &quot; After people see that it is nothing more_than a minimal inconvenience , they go_on with their lives. &quot; Weiss is a Times staff writer and Fields is a correspondent . What to Do State and federal agencies report that malathion has been studied extensively , and there is no evidence that it causes cancer , birth_defects , nerve damage , eye damage or cumulative injury . But residents are cautioned to avoid exposure . Officials also recommend that the following precautions be taken_after spraying : * If in contact with spray , wash residues from skin and clothing with soap and water . * Do not leave laundry outdoors when spraying is scheduled . If laundry is soiled , rewash before wearing . * If your car is outside during spraying , wash it the next day to prevent paint damage . * Rinse plastic skylights and awnings the day after spraying to prevent permanent stains . * Cover fish ponds before spraying and uncover shortly after to minimize water contamination while avoiding oxygen depletion . * Avoid harvesting home-grown fruits and vegetables for three days after spraying . * Rinse all fresh fruits and vegetables with water before cooking or eating them , just as you should with store-bought items .
