   <TEXT> It was 6:30 p.m. -- cocktail hour -- and some of the day ' s most important work was about to begin for U.S. District Judge Sam C . Pointer Jr . As a jazz combo played , the 24-year veteran of the federal bench purposefully roamed around a dimly lit reception_room at a downtown Holiday Inn . One moment , Pointer was chatting with a high-priced attorney representing Bristol-Myers Squibb Inc. Next , drink_in hand , he acknowledged the greeting of an affluent Cincinnati lawyer who specializes in class-action cases . Later , Pointer , 59 , listened intently to a Long_Island woman who runs a foundation that is concerned about children affected by toxic substances . All these people have one thing in common . They are enmeshed in some of the most complicated , emotionally charged and potentially expensive litigation in U.S. history -- the claims of thousands of women who say they were seriously injured by several major U.S. corporations that marketed silicone gel breast_implants without adequate safety testing or health warnings . There are even contentions that children have become ill drinking the breast milk of women who had implants . Pointer ' s &quot; cocktail hour &quot; was part of a strategy to find a way to resolve 6 # 000 federal breast_implant lawsuits that were consolidated here , and perhaps pave the way to clear many of the 6 # 000 cases pending in state courts . For more_than a year , Pointer has been meeting with all_of the major participants for drinks before each month ' s formal status conference in court . He guided them , listened to them , calmed them . On Wednesday , there was a major development . Three major defendants -- Dow Corning , Baxter International and Bristol-Myers -- reached a record-breaking $ 3.75-billion settlement with a coalition of plaintiffs ' lawyers . Several other companies have tentatively agreed to put_in another $ 170 million , bringing the settlement pot to almost $ 4 billion . Negotiations are continuing with several other large companies , including 3M , which could enrich the settlement by hundreds of millions more . The settlement -- which will be the richest of its kind if it is approved by Pointer after a June hearing on its fairness -- may enable thousands of women to resolve their cases without a trial . Significantly , this development comes at a time when many experts question the ability of the American legal_system to cope_with such &quot; mass torts , &quot; where law , science and human tragedy intersect on a Gargantuan scale . &quot; The processing and resolution of mass tort cases have been slow and expensive , and have produced results that have sometimes seemed capricious , &quot; a 1991 study by RAND ' s Institute of Civil Justice noted . Looming over the implant lawsuits is the specter of two decades of unconcluded asbestos litigation , which has driven 18 companies into bankruptcy and made millionaires of dozens of lawyers while sick people died without a trial . The crush of filings overwhelmed courts throughout the country . &quot; Our system didn ' t do a very good job of handling the asbestos cases , &quot; Pointer said . Members of Congress , other judges , lawyers on both sides , and thousands of women hope that Pointer , a specialist in complex litigation , can help prevent a repeat of that debacle . A special panel of federal judges transferred all_the federal breast_implant cases to him in June , 1992 , after a bitter conflict arose as_to how the lawsuits should be handled . If Pointer can oversee a broad-gauged settlement that works fairly and efficiently , it could help many women and their families , leave companies with more money to compensate the sick rather than lawyers , and be a great boon to a legal_system that faces the prospect of becoming more clogged from the implant cases . &quot; This is his Sistine Chapel , &quot; said Tennessee trial_lawyer David E . Waite , who represents more_than 100 women who are suing implant manufacturers . &quot; He ' s going_to prove that the tort system can work. &quot; The judge does not tend to speak in such grandiose terms . He simply said : &quot; It ' s certainly the most challenging situation I ' ve faced in terms of everything involved. &quot; Indeed , when the cases landed on Pointer ' s doorstep , the legal situation was far from a Sistine Chapel . It was more like a runaway train . * The government estimates that 1 million women in this country have gotten silicone gel breast_implants , about 80 % for cosmetic reasons and 20 % during reconstructive surgery after mastectomies . Although the implants were initially marketed in the United States in 1962 and the first multimillion-dollar verdict came a decade ago , until recently there were few signs that the devices would generate an avalanche of litigation . But just before Christmas , 1991 , there was a critical turn of events . A San Francisco jury awarded a woman $ 7.5 million for injuries caused by her implants -- $ 6.5 million of it punitive damages against Dow . The case was the third multimillion-dollar verdict in a breast_implant case in 1991 ; the others came_in Alabama and New York . Two weeks later , one of the woman ' s lawyers , Dan C . Bolton , sent a letter to Dr. David A . Kessler , commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration , describing some of the company documents that had been revealed during the trial and accusing Dow of &quot; engaging in a consistent pattern of corporate deceit and dishonesty related to the safety of implants. &quot; The letter heightened Kessler ' s concerns about the safety of implants and on Jan . 6 , 1992 , he announced a moratorium on their manufacture until further studies could be performed . Within a month , what had been a trickle of personal injury cases became a flood and lawyers for manufacturers of implants soon realized that their clients had a major problem . &quot; It became pretty obvious there would be mass filings of lawsuits , &quot; and rapidly escalating costs to defend them , said James R . Jenkins , Dow Corning ' s general counsel . Jenkins maintained that Dow has a good defense to the lawsuits : &quot; There has been no definitive link shown between implants &quot; and various medical problems that women have developed -- including scleroderma , lupus , autoimmune_diseases , neurological impairments , tremors , muscle inflammation , burning pain in the extremities and short-term_memory loss . But Jenkins acknowledged that some scientists would testify that there is a link between implants and medical problems . And he understood that their testimony , combined with troubling internal documents of the type used in the San Francisco case , would mean &quot; a lot of these cases would end_up going_to a jury , &quot; where anything could happen . So after consulting with Dow Chairman R . Keith McKennon , he called Kenneth R . Feinberg , a Washington lawyer who specializes in settling big cases , including one lodged by Vietnam veterans against Dow Chemical and other companies stemming from injuries believed to have been caused by the Vietnam-era defoliant Agent_Orange . &quot; We agreed Ken would go_out and talk confidentially to plaintiffs ' lawyers , some of whom he knew from other cases , &quot; Jenkins said . Several months later , officials of Deerfield , Ill.-based Baxter , the nation ' s largest hospital supply company , reached a similar conclusion . Baxter retained David I . Shapiro , a high-powered Washington lawyer who had built a reputation for hammering_out major agreements between warring parties . Santa Barbara-based implant manufacturer Mentor Corp. , a considerably smaller company , also saw trouble on the horizon , according to its attorney , William B . Griffin of San Francisco ' s Brobeck , Phleger &amp; Harrison . &quot; They looked_into the future and saw disaster . . . . They were being engulfed in the legal equivalent of war , and like Napoleon ' s Russian campaign , a war that can only be lost , even if all_the battles are won. &quot; Griffin wanted peace , but before he could initiate talks he had to figure_out who could negotiate for the plaintiffs . About the same time , Cincinnati attorney Stanley M . Chesley filed a federal class-action suit on behalf of women who had implants . Chesley had become a wealthy_man during the last 20 years by filing early class-action suits after mass disasters such_as the MGM Grand fire in Las Vegas . Many trial_lawyers loathe Chesley because they think he settles cases too cheaply , depriving plaintiffs of the possibility of a larger recovery . Moreover , by moving the cases into the class-action arena , Chesley strips other attorneys of the chance to try cases individually and earn large fees themselves . Although Chesley had very few breast_implant clients , he was rapidly granted permission to proceed by U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin , a jurist before whom Chesley had appeared many times . Scores of plaintiffs ' lawyers immediately challenged Rubin ' s ruling . They asked a special panel of federal judges to move the issue out of Cincinnati and consolidate all_the cases . In September , 1992 , the special panel sent the cases to the Birmingham courtroom of Pointer , who had written a manual for federal judges on how to handle complex litigation . Pointer , a 1970 appointee of President Richard Nixon , had a reputation as an incisive questioner and was widely viewed_as the ideal candidate for a tough case . From the start , Pointer made_it clear that he would not permit the sort of scorched earth tactics -- such_as costly , lengthy and pointless fights over turning_over key documents -- that have come_to dominate civil litigation in recent years . He commanded the defendants to turn_over all potentially relevant documents and on one occasion roasted a defense_lawyer who was vigorously resisting . By now , more_than 6 million documents have been collected , indexed and placed on CD-ROMS . Pointer also directed both sides to swiftly conduct depositions so that cases could be readied for trial . He told warring plaintiffs ' lawyers that they would have to moderate their differences and function as a unit . Pointer appointed a 17-member plaintiffs steering committee , chaired by Chesley and Ralph Knowles of Atlanta , one of the original leaders of the Breast_Implant Litigation Group of the Assn . of Trial_Lawyers of America . The committee has responsibility for the overall management of litigation for the plaintiffs . ( In turn , Dow Corning hired three large law_firms , Chicago ' s Kirkland &amp; Ellis , Cincinnati ' s Dinsmore &amp; Shohl and New York ' s Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher &amp; Flom , as well as smaller firms in virtually every state . Baxter ' s defense is spearheaded by Santa Monica ' s Dickson , Carlson &amp; Campillo and Bristol-Myers by McCarter &amp; English of Newark , N.J. ) The judge also urged lawyers on both sides , and other interested parties such_as leaders of breast_implant support groups , to attend the monthly cocktail_parties . The social_gatherings give Pointer an opportunity in an informal setting to hear what ' s on everyone ' s mind . The reception technique , virtually unheard of in legal circles , also is designed to foster civility among the most hostile of adversaries . Virtually all_the attorneys said the cocktail_parties had helped create an atmosphere that enhanced the possibility of a massive settlement . &quot; For lack of a better word , there have been no New York-style antics in the courtroom , &quot; said Frank Woodside of Cincinnati , one of three national counsels for Dow Corning . &quot; The level of advocacy has not been reduced , but the level of animosity has. &quot; The judge paid particular attention to the plaintiffs , whose voices sometimes get lost in the labyrinth of large litigation . &quot; Judge Pointer . . . listens to our concerns , &quot; said Sybil Goldrich , a Beverly Hills woman who blames numerous illnesses on her implants and is co-founder of the Command Trust Network , a nationwide information clearinghouse for breast_implant recipients . The judge also gave Goldrich and representatives of similar groups the opportunity to speak in court . In one instance , he went_along with Goldrich ' s recommendation that hundreds of women -- who , without lawyers , had earlier settled cases for small amounts_of_money -- be allowed to participate in the large settlement anyway . Meanwhile , the plaintiffs ' lawyers gained momentum , borrowing several million dollars to finance their research efforts . Bristol-Myers turned_over 12 million documents from its Medical Engineering subsidiary in Racine , Wis . Gayle L . Troutwine , a Portland attorney , said a coalition of 20 plaintiffs ' lawyers and paralegals went_to Racine , where they &quot; culled the documents down to 1 million &quot; that appeared relevant and sent them off to a depository in Cincinnati for indexing and potential use later . ( Troutwine said the documents helped her settle five cases against Bristol-Myers in 1993 , including one for $ 900 # 000 and another for $ 400 # 000. ) Moreover , concern mounted among the companies when a Houston jury awarded $ 25 million , including $ 20 million in punitive damages , to a Texas woman for the damage caused to her body when her silicone gel implants ruptured . The verdict precipitated the filings of hundreds of more lawsuits during the next several weeks , making_it necessary for the Harris County , Tex. , District Court clerk to add a night_shift so that her workers could process all_the paperwork . A new adversary also popped_up for the implant manufacturers -- their insurance carriers were starting to resist coverage of legal bills , which were mounting dramatically . Dow is reported to be spending $ 10 million a month . Over the next several months , Chesley and Knowles , joined by attorneys Margaret M . Branch of Albuquerque , Elizabeth J . Cabrasser of San Francisco and Arnold Levin of Philadelphia , forged a $ 25.8-million settlement with Mentor . Still , several plaintiffs lawyers said that was &quot; chump change &quot; compared to a deal that was being secretly negotiated between Chesley and Knowles for the plaintiffs and attorneys representing Dow and Baxter . When word of the secret talks leaked_out in spring , 1993 , internecine warfare among the plaintiffs lawyers was reignited . &quot; The next three days were the worst 72 hours of my life , &quot; said Francis H . Hare , a genial Birmingham lawyer called &quot; Brother &quot; by just about everyone . Hare , a longtime leader of the Assn . of Trial_Lawyers of America , had been brought into the secret negotiations as a consultant to the plaintiffs . &quot; I got calls saying ' Brother , you won ' t believe what ' s happened . . . . They ' re trying to take my cases away , &quot; Hare said . Finally , Hare was released from his pledge of confidentiality . &quot; Then , I had to call my friends back and tell them I had been part of the secret negotiations , &quot; Hare said . Among the angriest were Margaret Branch and Houston trial_lawyer Michael T . Gallagher , both of whom represent several hundred women with implants . After another stormy hearing in Pointer ' s courtroom , Branch and Gallagher were added_to the plaintiffs ' negotiating team . So was Cabrasser of San Francisco . The expanded team started meeting with the other side : Feinberg for Dow , Shapiro for Baxter and John L . McGoldrick , the Harvard-educated lawyer representing Bristol-Myers . There was considerable sparring at the start , according to numerous sources . At an early meeting at a New York hotel , McGoldrick declared that everything the negotiators agreed on would &quot; have to be approved by people at 345 Park Ave. , &quot; a reference_to Bristol-Myers ' nearby corporate headquarters . &quot; What city is that in ? &quot; retorted Gallagher , a wealthy Texas trial_lawyer who takes his own jet to court hearings around the country and is unimpressed with East Coast locales and Ivy League pedigrees . At times , the defense negotiators had spirited arguments among themselves -- including several debates over how much each company ' s share of the deal would be . One session in a hot tub at the Canyon Ranch resort in the Berkshire Mountains in Massachusetts became so agitated that other exasperated bathers told Feinberg , Shapiro and McGoldrick they had to leave . Among the most heated aspects of the bargaining between the defendants and plaintiffs were debates over definitions of diseases for which women could be compensated in the highly complex settlement . &quot; We argued over every word in those definitions , &quot; said Liz Dudley , a Wichita , Kan. , registered nurse who has worked as a paralegal medical_specialist for a decade and has compiled a database of 1 # 200 medical and scientific articles on implants for the plaintiffs . After months of haggling , Dudley said , Feinberg , Dow ' s lead negotiator , finally agreed to the definitions . &quot; He stormed into the meeting room at the Carlyle Hotel in New York at 2 a.m. He had the papers with the definitions rolled_up in his hand . He was screaming : ' we ' ll give you your damn disease definitions ! ' &quot; ( Dudley said that comment was tepid , compared to much of the language during negotiations . Feinberg declined comment. ) The true test of the accord is about to begin . It is perhaps the most elaborate products liability settlement ever designed and contains so many escape_hatches it could still fall_apart months from now . Women will be making decisions on whether to join the settlement , based on a host of factors . Among them are the nature of their injuries and their desire to avoid lengthy court battles , in which they would have to undergo questions about intimate details of their lives . ( Women seeking details about the settlement can call a court information phone_line at ( 800 ) 887-6828 ) . If the settlement attracts more participants than expected , it could drive down the individual shares , now estimated at $ 160 # 000 to $ 1.6 million per plaintiff , depending_on the extent of her injuries . If other companies join the settlement , those amounts could go_up to a range of $ 200 # 000 to $ 2 million . Lower payouts could prompt women to drop_out , and a smaller than anticipated class of plaintiffs could be grounds for the defendant corporations to walk away from the pact . &quot; The big question now is whether there are sufficient funds &quot; to cover all_the claims women are expected to file , said Albuquerque , N.M. , lawyer Branch , who was_on the plaintiff ' s negotiating team . &quot; If not , I certainly would hope the defendants would contribute more money so that the compensation amounts will not have to be reduced . For the companies to reduce these compensation amounts would produce a flood of ' opt-outs ' that would jeopardize the entire settlement. &quot; Some plaintiffs ' attorneys have indicated that they believe their clients would fare better in a court trial , and hope to proceed with their cases this year . Breast_Implant Lawsuit Here is a look_at some of the key players in a record-breaking $ 3.75-billion settlement by three U.S. corporations with lawyers representing thousands of women who say they were seriously injured by silicone gel breast_implants .
