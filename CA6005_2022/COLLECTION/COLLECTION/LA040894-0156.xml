   <HEADLINE> FDA OBJECTS TO 19-YEAR DELAY IN RELEASE OF IMPLANT STUDY ; HEALTH : DOW CORNING FAILED TO TELL AGENCY OF RESEARCH INTO ADVERSE EFFECT ON MICE OF COMPOUND IN SILICONE GEL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The head of the federal Food and Drug Administration on Thursday expressed serious concerns about Dow Corning Corp. ' s 19-year-delay in disclosing a study indicating that a component of the silicone gel in breast_implants harmed the immune_system of mice . &quot; The agency has significant concerns both about the findings and the manner in which they became available to us , &quot; FDA Commissioner David Kessler said . The FDA first obtained the study last week from lawyers representing women suing Dow Corning and other companies , alleging that they were injured by silicone gel breast_implants . &quot; The report seems to suggest that one of the compounds that is present in breast_implants and that we were concerned about does have adverse impacts , &quot; Kessler said in a statement . FDA spokesman James O ' Hara said Kessler was referring to the fact that Dow failed to provide the study during 1991 and 1992 FDA hearings on implant safety . At those hearings , O ' Hara said , &quot; there was considerable discussion about the significance &quot; of the material Dow studied in 1975 . Robert LeVier , Dow Corning ' s director of bioscience research , one of the co-authors of the 1975 study , participated in the FDA hearings in 1991 . At the time of the hearings , LeVier said that the company had not seen any &quot; immunologic events &quot; from the material , which is called D4 . LeVier made a brief reference_to the 1975 study in a March , 1993 , letter to the FDA , a year after the agency had restricted the use of implants . But the company did not provide the study at the time , according to FDA officials . The controversy over the new study arose as thousands of women around the country are trying to decide whether to join a pending $ 3.75-billion settlement of implant cases that could bring individual women awards ranging from $ 105 # 000 to $ 1.4 million . Gary Anderson , Dow Corning executive_vice_president , contended that the study revealed no significant hazard and had not been disclosed because of that . He also expressed concern that publicity about the study might cause women to opt_out of the settlement , believing that they could fare better in court because their lawyers could argue that Dow suppressed evidence of safety hazards . Several plaintiffs ' lawyers said they did not think the 1975 study alone would prompt a woman to choose not to join the settlement . &quot; I think very few decisions will be made on the basis of this study , &quot; said Ernie Hornsby , a Dothan , Ala. , lawyer who represents several hundred women in implant cases . However , Hornsby and other attorneys said the study could be quite useful to a woman who decided to take her case to court because it might help her win punitive damages . The attorneys who gave the study to the FDA said they found it last month while reviewing millions of documents turned_over to them by court_order last May . &quot; The overall significance of the study &quot; is that it belies contentions &quot; by the implant manufacturers , primarily Dow , that there is no immune_response elicited by a silicone gel breast_implant , &quot; Hornsby said . &quot; This study shows there was an immune_response and they were aware of it in 1975 . The D4 material in the implant had a suppressive effect on the immune_system of the mice . While the study is not conclusive , it put Dow on notice &quot; of possible dangers , Hornsby said . &quot; I think the study is shocking , &quot; said Frederic L . Ellis , a Boston lawyer who represents numerous women suing Dow and who came_upon the study last month . &quot; It ' s unconscionable that Dow knew this material , called D4 , could stimulate the immune_system and they didn ' t tell the FDA , plastic_surgeons or the women , and they kept implants on the market. &quot; But Anderson , Dow ' s executive_vice_president , said the plaintiffs ' lawyers had mischaracterized the significance of the study . &quot; Had we seen a negative health effect . . . we would have submitted the report to the FDA and probably have withdrawn the product from the market , &quot; Anderson said . &quot; The results indicated there was no need to be concerned , so we didn ' t submit the report. &quot; Barbara S . Carmichael , Dow ' s chief spokeswoman , offered a more detailed explanation . &quot; When this material was tested in its pure form at an extremely high dose level , it showed no effect on the immune_system of mice , &quot; Carmichael said . She said that only when the D4 material was mixed with a foreign substance that does not appear in implants did_it show &quot; a marginal and short-lived ( 48-hour ) effect on the immune_system of the mice. &quot; Ellis said that plaintiffs also had discovered references_to other Dow studies dating to 1971 during the discovery process and that the company had failed to turn_over these documents . This week , Ellis and other plaintiffs lawyers filed papers with U.S. District Judge Sam C . Pointer Jr . in Birmingham , Ala. , who is presiding over 6 # 000 implant lawsuits , requesting that he compel Dow to turn_over the other studies . Ellis said he believed the judge would rule on the motion this month . There has been considerable debate in the scientific community on whether breast_implants have a negative impact on the immune_system or cause other medical problems , such_as tissue problems , aching joints and short-term_memory loss . On Thursday , at least two knowledgeable researchers differed on the study ' s significance . &quot; The results from the 1975 study seriously challenge statements that silicone is inert , &quot; said Dr. Nir Kossovsky , associate_professor of pathology at UCLA , who has done considerable research on women with implants and testified for plaintiffs in implant lawsuits . That is significant because women contend they have been injured by silicone leaking_out of the implant pouch and migrating throughout their systems . Kossovsky also said the study shows that silicone can account_for numerous symptoms described by implant recipients , including fevers , joint aches , chills and general malaise . On the other hand , John Naim , an immunologist at Rochester , N.Y. , General Hospital , said he concurred with Dow ' s position on the study . &quot; At the time , from their point_of_view , it was not relevant. &quot; Meanwhile , negotiations continued between 3M and other breast_implant manufacturers who thus far have not joined the settlement . If 3M and the other companies join the settlement , it could add_up to $ 1 billion to the fund .</TEXT>
