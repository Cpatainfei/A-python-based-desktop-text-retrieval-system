   <HEADLINE> 1994 / YEAR IN REVIEW ; THE HIGHS WERE HIGH , THE LOWS WERE LOW ; THERE WERE SOME FABULOUS SHOWS AND SOME PROMISING TRENDS IN L.A. ' S ART COMMUNITY THIS YEAR . AND THEN THERE WAS THE DOWNSIDE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Herewith , in no particular order , the 10 events , episodes and issues most significant for the Los Angeles art world in 1994 : Dynamic Duo : Simultaneous retrospectives of the pivotal work of Bruce Nauman and Mike Kelley at the Museum of Contemporary Art and the L.A. County Museum of Art , respectively , made_for a knockout summer museum season , while definitively underscoring the continuing international significance of art made in Los Angeles . An added twist : You would have expected the show of the younger artist ( Kelley ) to be at MOCA and of the older ( Nauman ) to be at LACMA , but the tables were refreshingly turned . Solo Stars : Among the impressive solo shows in L.A. ' s resilient galleries were those by L.A.-based artists Phyllis Baldino , Judie Bamber , Linda Burnham , Carole Caroompas , Michael Coughlan , Roy Dowell , Sam Durant , Sally Elesby , Nancy Evans , Chris Finley , Judy Fiskin , Michael Gonzalez , Scott Grieger , Roger Herman , Jim Isermann , Larry Johnson , Mike Kelley , Joyce Lightbody , Paul McCarthy , Dan McCleary , Patrick Nickell , Jennifer Pastor and John Souza , as well as those of out-of-towners Stephan Balkenhal , Max Cole , Vernon Fisher , Michael Goldberg , William Klein , Richard Misrach , Joel Otterson , Therese Oulton , Peter Saul and Richard Tuttle . This extensive list -- not definitive because incomplete -- already ranks with the liveliest gallery scenes anywhere . Show_Business : The city ' s museums came_through the January earthquake relatively unscathed , while somewhat downsized exhibition schedules nonetheless managed to impress . LACMA boasted a sizable number , including &quot; Picasso and the Weeping Women , &quot; &quot; Helen Levitt , &quot; &quot; The Camera I : Photographic Self-Portraits From the Audrey and Sydney Irmas Collection , &quot; &quot; Korean Arts of the 18th Century : Splendor and Simplicity , &quot; &quot; Spanish Polychrome Sculpture ( 1500-1800 ) in United States Collections &quot; and the current &quot; Painting the Maya Universe : Royal Ceramics from the Classic Period &quot; and ' The Peaceful Liberators : Jain Art of India. &quot; MOCA ' s prudently trimmed Roy Lichtenstein retrospective looked infinitely better than at its debut at New York ' s Guggenheim Museum . &quot; Fouquet ' s Century : Transformations in French Painting , 1415-1530 &quot; and &quot; Andre Kertesz : A Centennial Tribute &quot; dazzled at the J . Paul Getty Museum , as does the current &quot; A Passion for Antiquities : Ancient Art From the Collection of Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman. &quot; The Getty also undertook an unprecedented collaboration with the Huntington Art_Gallery for &quot; Pictorialism in California : Photographs , 1900-1940. &quot; The Norton Simon Museum opened an absorbing , yearlong show about German dealer Galka Scheyer , early champion in Los Angeles of the European avant-garde , while the Long_Beach Museum of Art offered an eye-opening assessment of &quot; The First Generation : Women and Video , 1970-1975. &quot; About Face : In January , the Lannan Foundation stunned the American art world with its announcement that it would stop collecting contemporary art . Instead , between $ 2 million and $ 3 million annually has been shifted to social programs in Native_American communities . Lannan ' s crucial program of funding museum exhibitions remains intact -- both the Nauman and Kelley shows saw the light of day thanks to Lannan largess -- but the heart of the foundation ' s enterprise had been its ambitious acquisition program . Percent-for-Ego : Culver City detonated a multi-megaton bombshell in April when it tentatively agreed that , henceforth , the one-percent-for- art requirement in civic development projects could be considered fulfilled if the city found the quality of the project ' s architecture to be substantial enough . The silly plan , ostensibly intended to boost public recognition of building design , was widely seen as a political accommodation to an influential local developer and his favored architect . Suddenly disenfranchised artists and newly enfranchised architects were polarized into warring factions , while the precedent jeopardized hard-won percent-for-art ordinances in cities nationwide . Rudderless Ship : Sixteen months have passed since the surprise departure of short-lived LACMA director Michael E . Shapiro . In November , Shapiro was named chief curator and program director at Atlanta ' s High Museum , but LACMA will finish the year still directorless and without a likely candidate in_sight . Meanwhile , major museums in Boston and New York successfully completed their protracted searches for appropriate leadership . First Generation : A distinct changing of the guard was felt more strongly than ever as significant figures among the first generation of artists , collectors and curators to make L.A. an emergent cultural force in the 1950s and early 1960s either retired or went_on to the Big Art World in the Sky . The passing of pivotal artists Sam Francis , Edward Kienholz and Hans Burkhardt ; one-of-a-kind architect John Lautner ; influential collector Frederick R . Weisman ; multiple-museum trustee ( and former Times Mirror Co . CEO ) Franklin D . Murphy ; and the widely revered collector , curator and dealer Betty Asher was followed in December by the unexpected retirement of Maurice Tuchman , founding curator in 1964 of LACMA ' s 20th-Century art_department . NEA No-No : With an unconscionable action , the National Endowment for the Arts destroyed from within more of its hard-earned credibility than its most rabid enemies had yet managed . The presidentially appointed National Council on the Arts , which oversees the NEA , declared in August that political considerations would henceforth guide the awarding of NEA grants . Asserting that &quot; we cannot be blind to political reality , &quot; council_member and Tufts University theater professor Barbara Grossman helped reject peer panel recommendations for fellowships to three artists -- even though the NEA ' s enabling legislation expressly forbids turning_down grants on political grounds . Under the Hammer : The Nov . 11 sale by the UCLA / Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center of a rare , autograph manuscript by Leonardo da Vinci bottomed_out as &quot; a new low for museum ethics , &quot; in the words of Lee Rosenbaum , newspaper_columnist and author of a standard reference_work on art collecting . The museum auctioned_off the irreplaceable public asset in_order to create a war_chest to deal with possible lawsuits against the Hammer estate . Adding insult to the injury was the cowardly silence of the leading professional organizations for American art museums , whose ethical guidelines had been so blatantly breached by the sale . Gallery Glut : The September opening of Santa Monica ' s multiple gallery enclave , Bergamot Station , generated enormous enthusiasm , attention and support . Less noticed has been the quiet emergence of a variety of new , smaller galleries -- Acme , Dan Bernier , Blum &amp; Poe , Crossing Gallery , Marc Foxx , TRI -- which , following the successful precedents of such spaces as Thomas Solomon ' s Garage , Food House , Sue Spaid and Richard Telles Fine_Arts , are replacing in significance the &quot; apartment galleries &quot; that mushroomed a_few seasons back . Finally , 1993 ' s budget-minded effort to have out-of-town dealers show their wares in borrowed L.A. galleries had felt thin and vaguely desperate , because most dealers brought only work they could fit_in their suitcases -- a practice that turned_out to be ideally suited to the convivial art fair held_in December in spacious hotel_rooms at the Chateau Marmont on the Sunset Strip . The traveling-salesman ambience of a hotel was perfect , and the fair is likely to be repeated in 1995. *</TEXT>
