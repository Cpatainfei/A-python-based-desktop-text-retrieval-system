   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; Q &amp; A ; MAXIS ' BRAUN SAYS EASE OF USE WILL MAKE OR BREAK MULTIMEDIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Want to play Mayor ? Or how about God ? Catering to modest fantasies such_as these has made Orinda , Calif.-based Maxis Inc. -- developer of best-selling simulation games such_as &quot; SimAnt , &quot; &quot; SimFarm &quot; and &quot; SimCity &quot; -- one of the hottest little companies in the burgeoning multimedia entertainment_industry . And Maxis ' chairman and founder , Jeff Braun , is now making a name for himself as one of the industry ' s most outspoken critics . Braun and software designer Will Wright founded Maxis in 1987 to create a different type of computer_game -- one where you don ' t win , lose or die in the end . The first result , &quot; SimCity , &quot; now has some 3 million people playing it on personal_computers , Macintoshes and Nintendo systems around the world . The update to &quot; SimCity , &quot; &quot; SimCity 2000 , &quot; has been a mainstay on software best-seller lists since its release last year . All of the Maxis titles let you play the heady role of omniscient creator . Whether you ' re tilling the fields in &quot; SimFarm , &quot; kissing up_to the Queen in &quot; SimAnt &quot; or creating bizarre new life_forms in &quot; SimLife , &quot; you ' re the one at the controls . Your city , farm , ant colony or environment succeeds or fails as a result of the decisions you make_over time . Just like in real_life . Braun is well-known in the industry for his off-the-cuff commentary on trends and products . We caught_up_with him last week and asked him his views on Apple , Microsoft and the harsh realities of the consumer software market . * Q : You ' ve been around as long , if not longer , than anyone else in the multimedia industry . What do you think is the biggest problem facing it today ? A : Definitely , definitely ease of use . We keep_on saying that the PC is a consumer machine , but when these people get_it home , they can ' t use it ! PCs are so hard to use , we ' re losing our credibility as an industry . We have to work_on how to make this like a commodity consumer industry item like VCRs or video_game machines . The PC just isn ' t there yet . * Q : So how does the industry go_about doing that ? A : For one thing , you hope Apple succeeds ! It really takes that Apple ( Macintosh ) type of an interface . We have very few problems with Apple products in our tech support , and we have an amazing amount of problems with Microsoft Windows on a PC . I think as Windows becomes more like a Mac -- which is what I hear ( the next version of Windows ) does -- that should pretty much take_care of it . But only if they start releasing new hardware that is literally plug-and-play , if they release stuff that anyone can plug_in and make work . People buy these PCs expecting something from the promises , but then they get_it home and can ' t even get_it to work . Think_of how frustrating that is for people . * Q : As a software maker developing for several platforms , which one do you see winning ? At the turn_of_the_century , will desktop_computers like PCs and Macs be dominant , or will the main multimedia machines be descendants of today ' s Sega and Nintendo game systems ? A : I think right now the stable platform you can count_on for the next few years is the IBM PC . I think that will remain stable for a while . Beyond that , I don ' t know . But for now , we can continue our PC business without any interruption . We ' re still trying to see what happens with the Sony PSX ( multimedia game system ) . Or what to do if the Sega or the 3DO ( multimedia games system ) take_off . We need to stay light-footed and not commit ( ourselves ) to any one platform , but to try to develop products that can take_advantage of the strengths of all these platforms . Like 3-D . We ' re putting three-dimensional graphics in our new titles , across all platforms . * Q : OK , but how about some soothsaying ? A : You want me to soothsay ? OK then , it ' s the year 2000 and Motorola owns it all . Here ' s the play : Motorola buys Apple , they get the Mac , they drop the price , turn it into a commodity thing for consumers and go head-to-head against Microsoft in a big , fat way . With large , large merchandising and large , large dollars . And then they come_up with a strategy of low-end ( computer ) consoles , like the Nintendo machine , and ( hand-held_computers ) and notebook-type computers . The idea is to create a whole line -- so it goes all_the way from consoles to ( hand-held_computers ) to laptops and to video_game machines -- and it ' s all compatible , they ' re all using the same files , all products will work_on any of them . And if there ' s one company that can really pull it all off , it ' s Motorola . * Q : Then what happens to the Intel platform and Microsoft Windows ? A : I hope it dies . Because as I said , unless we do something to make_it easy and make_it seamless for customers , we ' re going to lose a whole base of the customer . Because they ' re just not going_to want to be involved . But if you can put them on this cross-platform strategy , you can bring them in . If anyone can do_it , it ' s Motorola . Because if we ' re stuck_with Bill Gates and Intel , I think it ' s going_to be a total nightmare . I do not have any faith in Chicago or Windows 95 ( the new version of Windows slated for release next year ) or whatever they call it . * Q : Why not ? Lots of other software makers sing its praises . A : The thing I think is most depressing is that the base configuration they ' ve announced is 8 megabytes of memory . And if that ' s the base , you ' re talking more like 12 megs to run applications and games on it . So every machine for consumers is going_to cost $ 2 # 000 ? That is not a consumer machine . And most computers today only have 4 megabytes . So are they all going_to have to upgrade just for Windows 95 ? I just think that ' s insane . That alone just drives me nuts . * Q : What kind of computer do you own ? A : Um , I have a 486 clone . * Q : A PC with Windows ? Come_on ! A : Yeah , as much as I hate it . I also have a Mac , but honestly I use mostly Windows because I have to do all_the business things . And all_the business things are_on Windows , although I hate it . * Q : Excepting your own , what are your favorite multimedia titles ? A : Well , right at the top is one called &quot; Rock , Rap ' n ' Roll. &quot; My parents are afraid they might break the computer . But this one , I set it up and told my parents they could hit any key , make any kind of music happen , and they just went crazy . They loved it . It ' s easy . And I ' m just saying , now that ' s a product . Then , I would have to say &quot; Myst. &quot; It ' s the mood -- the sounds , effects and the mood they create , it ' s wonderful . It really provokes the emotion . * Q : Beyond games like &quot; SimCity &quot; and multimillion-dollar fighter_pilot training , what are simulations good for in the real_world ? A : Any kind of training . PizzaHut is putting_together a simulation where the employees in their off hours get_off from work and play &quot; Sim PizzaHut. &quot; You can literally simulate anything . You can take a problem , like traffic , and you can set_up sims that ask : What if we rearrange the light pattern ? What if we make them one-way_streets ? Basically , simulations can help people learn about any situation in a non-linear fashion . It ' s very important for education and training . And very interesting for entertainment . And politics . You can simulate the health_care system , like we did with &quot; SimHealth , &quot; and help people make decisions about policy . You can simulate the national deficit . And you could say what ' s the largest part , what if we cut_out defense ? What if we got_rid_of the CIA ? You could just say what if ? And it ' s like a spreadsheet , where you can rework it until you get an output you find satisfactory . It ' s very educational .
