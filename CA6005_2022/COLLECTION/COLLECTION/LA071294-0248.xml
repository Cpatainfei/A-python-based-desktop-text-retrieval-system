   <HEADLINE> INCREASE WORLD ROLE , CLINTON TELLS GERMANY ; EUROPE : PRESIDENT CALLS NATION ' PLAINLY CAPABLE ' OF MORE RESPONSIBILITY . CHANCELLOR KOHL SECONDS THAT VIEW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton prodded Germany on Monday to broaden its world leadership , lending support to Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s efforts to calm German and European fears of a more assertive , reunited Germany . In a two-day visit , planned partly to reassure a country whose history excluded it from the observances of D-day , Clinton said he hoped &quot; we will have the benefit of the full range of Germany ' s capacities to lead. &quot; He cited the leadership responsibilities that Europe ' s largest economic power &quot; is plainly capable of fulfilling. &quot; Clinton ' s comments , delivered as he stood with Kohl outside the German Chancellery , were the latest expression of his desire to see Germany share_in the costs and burdens of leading Europe and policing world trouble spots . The visit , which took Clinton to Berlin on Monday night , comes_on the eve of a decision by the German Constitutional Court , which is expected to legalize the use of the German military in peacekeeping efforts around the world . In their eagerness to break_with their country ' s Nazi past , postwar Germans have confined their military to a narrow domestic role and have been reluctant to allow deployment of troops abroad . Clinton ' s interest in the court ruling was underscored by his questioning of German President Roman Herzog , formerly chief judge of Germany ' s high_court . Kohl , who this month took_over the presidency of the European Union and is seeking a seat for Germany on the U.N. Security_Council , has been the country ' s leading voice for a broadened international role . At the news_conference , he supported Clinton ' s views , pointing_out that , as a nation rebuilt with international support , Germany &quot; cannot simply sit_back and let the others do the work. &quot; Germany cannot be a country &quot; with the kind of reputation and prestige we claimed for ourselves if we do not fully accept our responsibilities and fulfill our obligations , &quot; Kohl said . Clinton ' s motives stem in part from domestic considerations . The American public generally feels it pays a disproportionate share for military security and economic aid around the world . The United States wants Germany to play a greater role in multinational military operations and to continue the heavy economic aid it has distributed among former Soviet Bloc countries since the fall of communism . But , while there is growing support for a broader international role within Germany itself , it runs counter to a strong pacifist streak that makes many here unwilling to countenance expanded military operations . Rudolf Scharping , leader of the Social Democratic Party and Kohl ' s main rival in the Oct . 16 federal election , generally agrees with the chancellor on the issue . But Scharping ' s party filed the court challenges against government use of the military abroad . The cases challenge the deployment of German ships in the Adriatic_Sea to support an embargo against Serbia and of German soldiers in radar surveillance flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and on the ground in Somalia . Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel -- who leads Kohl ' s coalition partner , the Free Democratic Party -- said in an interview published Monday that , even with the expected court approval , Germany will be circumspect in its use of troops abroad . &quot; We have done_well with our policy of restraint . In the future , we will still be saying ' no ' more often than ' yes , ' &quot; Kinkel said . Clinton supports a key aspect of Kohl ' s program to broaden the German role -- his effort to integrate Eastern Europe into the European Union . The proposal is controversial among America ' s other West European allies because it would effectively shift Europe ' s center of power to the East and toward Germany . While Clinton ' s support is expected to bolster Kohl ' s position against internal critics who still want Germany to hold_back , chancellery sources expressed concern that unabashed support from the President for a strong Germany could backfire . It could , they said , scare Germany ' s European neighbors and make Kohl ' s job as president of the European Union tougher . The ticklish aspects of Clinton ' s desire for a more assertive Germany were apparent during his Bonn appearance when a German reporter asked whether the phrase &quot; special relationship &quot; now refers to America ' s ties to the Germans rather than the_British . &quot; that ' s like asking me to pick a team in the World Cup , &quot; Clinton said . In Bonn , Kohl and Clinton rhapsodized about the American role in protecting and helping rebuild postwar Germany . &quot; We have not forgotten the millions of American soldiers who , over a period of more_than 40 years , defended freedom and peace and security for us here in Germany , &quot; Kohl said . After private meetings with Herzog and Kohl , Clinton had a ceremonial lunch and individual meetings with Scharping and Kinkel . The President then flew to Kohl ' s home_in Ludwigshafen to dine on Italian cuisine with a leader who shares his fondness for a good meal . En route to Berlin , he stopped at Ramstein Air_Base to address American troops . Clinton ' s visit is expected to boost Kohl . But a Clinton aide insisted the President was not taking sides in German politics .</TEXT>
