   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; SWISS SKI GREAT ADDS TO LEGEND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Vreni Schneider would n ' t concede that winning the gold medal Saturday in slalom was a fitting way to end her Olympic career . At 29 , it is unlikely that the_Swiss star will still be beating_back the teen-agers at the 1998 Nagano Games , but why start conceding ? Had she conceded that . 68 of a second was too_much time to make_up on leader Katja Koren after the morning run , Schneider could have never made history with a seamless second run that allowed her to claim the gold by 1.79 seconds over runner-up Elfriede Eder of Austria , the silver medalist . Koren , from Slovenia , who had posted the fastest first-run time from the 33rd starting position , took the bronze . Schneider might now stake a claim to the title of best female skier ever , which has long been held by Austria ' s Annemarie Moser-Proll , who retired with 62 World Cup victories and three Olympic medals . Schneider is second on the all-time World Cup win list with 50 , and the rest of her career ahead . Her victory Saturday was no upset . She had won five of the eight World Cup slaloms this season . The race marked the first Olympic breakdown for the U.S. ski team . Of America ' s four starters , only Carrie Sheinberg completed the race , finishing 18th . In winning her third Alpine medal of these Games , Schneider became the first woman to win five of them . To the gold medals she won in giant slalom and slalom at the 1988 Calgary Games , she added this slalom gold , a silver in Alpine combined and a bronze in giant slalom . There have been lean years for Schneider , particularly 1992 , when she slumped badly and finished_out of the medals at the Albertville Games . But there were never concessions . &quot; My health is good , &quot; Schneider said . &quot; I will listen to the voice inside myself about the future , in the spring . I prefer to enjoy this very great moment. &quot; She had only the fifth-fastest time in the first run but , of those ahead of her , only Sweden ' s Pernilla Wiberg matched her in slalom savvy . Koren , Slovenia ' s comeback kid , won a super-G earlier this season from the 66th start . When she shot into first on the first run from the 33rd position , her Olympic dream was already fulfilled . Koren squinted into the sun at the timing board , stared for a good 10 seconds , finally figured_out she was first , then thrust her arms in the air . &quot; I didn ' t believe it was possible , &quot; she said . Skiing last among top seeds in the second run , the 18-year-old Koren admitted she was just skiing for a medal . Schneider had posted an unbeatable time , and Eder was entrenched in second . It was heady enough stuff that Koren could knock Wiberg , the gold medalist in combined , off the victory stand . It was the second Olympic medal for Slovenia as an independent nation . Earlier in the week , Alenka Dovzan had won the bronze in combined . These were proud moments for a nation that broke free from the former Yugoslavia in 1991 , although Slovenians are offended that the Olympic computer information_system has credited both medals to Slovakia . &quot; We are not Slovakia , &quot; Tone Vogrinec , the Slovenian coach , said . &quot; It ' s a big difference , about 800 kilometers on the map. &quot; Eder ' s silver was the second medal in these Games for the Austrian Alpine team , which has dominated the World Cup the last few seasons . Austria ' s performance has obviously been affected by the death of Ulrike Maier , killed in a downhill race Jan . 29 . &quot; You have to keep_on fighting , &quot; Eder , 24 , said . &quot; Life goes_on . I tried to be like Ulli . I had a very strong image of Ulli , to fight the way she used to do. &quot;</TEXT>
