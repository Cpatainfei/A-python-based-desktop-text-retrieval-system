   <HEADLINE> JUDGE EXCLUDES TESTIMONY OF 4-YEAR-OLD ; HEARING : THE CHILD WAS THE ONLY WITNESS TO AN ALLEGED BEATING OF HER TWIN BROTHER . HE SUFFERED SEVERE BRAIN DAMAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So small that most courtroom observers could see only her blond curls in the box as she testified , the sole witness to an alleged beating that left her twin brother severely brain damaged squirmed Wednesday as a prosecutor tried to coax her into telling what she saw . She is 4 . Jessica Thivener sang into the microphone , asked_for her mother and said , &quot; I want to see Jason. &quot; She looked_at pictures of Jason , her brother who is in a vegetative state -- perhaps permanently -- from his injuries . She occasionally glanced toward Fateheen Rahman , the man charged with attempted murder in the alleged beating . But she seemed afraid . She would n ' t tell Deputy Dist . Atty . Lea Purwin D ' Agostino what she , and she alone , had seen , despite the prosecutor ' s gentle questions . &quot; Jason ' s sleeping , &quot; Jessica said before trying to run from the witness_stand . &quot; Is Jason hurt ? &quot; D ' Agostino prodded , and the child replied &quot; yes. &quot; But when asked how Jason was hurt , Jessica said , &quot; I don ' t want to tell. &quot; Her reluctance left Van Nuys Municipal Judge Jessica Perrin Silvers little choice but to exclude the child ' s testimony . Nevertheless , following a daylong preliminary hearing , Silvers held Rahman -- who says Jason hurt himself by falling against a coffee_table -- for trial on attempted murder and child endangerment charges . Later , away from the courtroom and safe in the arms of her mother , Jessica again was asked what happened to Jason . &quot; Fateheen , &quot; she said , grabbing a toy clown by the neck and hurling it forcefully to the floor . Silvers ordered Rahman , a 22-year-old native of Bangladesh , held_on $ 500 # 000 bail . She also ordered him not to call or write the twins ' mother , Tammi Thivener , 25 , of Van Nuys . Outside the courtroom , Thivener said she blames herself for leaving her children with Rahman because she was suddenly called_in to work_at the department_store where he was a co-worker . She had planned to marry him , she said , but &quot; I don ' t have any feelings for him right now . I can ' t believe that someone so loving , so nice , could do something so horrible. &quot; Paramedic Dennis Archie testified that Rahman told him that the children had been playing and that Jason stopped breathing when Jessica sat on him . Archie also testified that he saw Rahman &quot; strike the baby with his fists , harder than you or I would. &quot; Los Angeles Police Detective Irene Frizzell testified that Jessica had earlier told her that Rahman had choked them . The child first demonstrated by putting her hands around the detective ' s neck , Frizzell testified . Later , she grabbed a Barbie doll by the neck and threw it to the floor , Frizzell said . Frizzell testified that the day after Jason was injured , when she interviewed Rahman in the Van Nuys jail , he &quot; was crying and distraught. &quot; He told her then that on the day of the injury , he was tired and was trying to sleep on the couch , but the children were crying . He said he spanked them , and that made them cry more . The detective said he told her that he shook Jason , who broke free and accidentally banged his head on a marble coffee_table . Because of his brain injury , Jason will probably spend the rest of his life &quot; in a vegetative state , &quot; and his prognosis for recovery is &quot; grim , &quot; testified Dr. Antonio Galvis , a pediatrician at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles . The 4-year-old underwent surgery for the second time Tuesday , so doctors could install a permanent shunt to drain from his skull the fluid that gathers there because of his injuries . Galvis , who was_on duty at the hospital when Jason arrived by helicopter June 12 , said the boy ' s brain was swelling so quickly his life was in danger . Jason was bruised on the left side of his head , neck , face and ear . Tiny blood_vessels in his face had ruptured , indicating he ' d been choked , Galvis said . Questioned by defense_attorney Richard S . Plotin , Galvis said he doubted Jason received his injuries by falling against a coffee_table . He said the boy ' s injuries were the type he usually sees &quot; only in the ones who fall from buildings or are in automobile accidents. &quot; Outside of court , Thivener said she holds her son for hours at the hospital . It ' s the only thing that seems to calm his whimpering . Even though he cannot respond to stimuli and is in a vegetative state , &quot; He ' s lying there , his eyes are open , and he ' s crying , &quot; said Thivener . &quot; I know he ' s in pain , that he feels everything , every poke , &quot; she said . &quot; He needs a miracle . They said he ' d die . For him to still be alive is a miracle. &quot; Plotin said outside court that Rahman felt so remorseful that Jason was injured under his care that he wrote Jason a letter . &quot; He expressed his remorse and said he was sorry . He said he loved Jason and hopes he gets better , &quot; the lawyer said . &quot; He feels devastated and ashamed , &quot; Plotin said . &quot; He never intended any injury . This is a tragedy for everybody concerned. &quot; Said Thivener : &quot; Maybe he didn ' t mean to do_it , but he still did it. &quot;</TEXT>
