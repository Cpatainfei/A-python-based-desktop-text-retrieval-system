   <HEADLINE> ASTRONAUTS ERECT SCAFFOLD , PUT IT TO A STRESS_TEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Towering over the loftiest ironworkers on Earth , Columbia ' s astronauts erected a scaffold and then jolted it Monday for the benefit of space_station architects . Crewman Charles ( Sam ) Gemar snapped the thin rods and cylindrical joints together on day four of the 14-day shuttle research mission.He subjected the rectangular structure -- a miniature version of a space_station truss -- to electronic vibrations so engineers could gauge its sturdiness . After about four hours , Gemar said he was going_to &quot; punch the clock &quot; and take the rest of the day_off . Pierre Thuot took_over for him . Because of the length of the mission -- it will be the second-longest shuttle flight if all goes as planned -- NASA has scheduled time_off for the five astronauts . Each gets two four-hour breaks_in orbit . Before going_to_sleep , Gemar and Allen tested two faulty electrical plugs . They didn ' t mind the repair work -- Allen said it ' s &quot; a great thing to do on your day_off . that ' s what you ' d be doing at_home anyhow. &quot; &quot; When you ' re up here , it ' s like every day is a holiday and every meal is a feast , &quot; Allen added . Mission Control continued to closely watch Columbia ' s auxiliary power_units , one of which had unusually high_pressure readings earlier in the flight .</TEXT>
