   <HEADLINE> A MEDICAL IMBALANCE ; AFTER A LONG HISTORY OF TESTING TREATMENTS PRIMARILY ON WHITE_MEN , SCIENTISTS ARE TRYING TO INCLUDE WOMEN AND MINORITIES . ATTRACTING THEM COULD MEAN SAVING MORE LIVES -- BUT IT ' S A CHALLENGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was envisioned as one of the first ethnically balanced , large-scale studies of its kind : a trial of 16 # 000 women to test tamoxifen ' s ability to prevent breast_cancer in women at high risk . But when researchers began recruiting subjectts for the nationwide drug study in 1992 , they were able to attract few minorities . Just 2 % of the initial study population were African Americans , Asian Americans , Latinas or Pacific Islanders . A later recruiting drive , this time targeting ethnic_groups , raised the percentage to 4 . But researchers , who had hoped for up_to 20 % , remain troubled . If a significant number of minority women aren ' t enrolled soon , researchers will be unable to answer a key question when the study ends : Does the drug work any differently in women of color ? Experts now estimate that about 60 % of the study ' s final 5 # 000 to 6 # 000 women will have to be minorities -- a daunting number by any research standards -- in_order to answer that question . Researchers in the tamoxifen study are hardly alone in their dilemma . After a long history of testing medical treatments primarily on white_men , scientists performing federally funded research are now generally required to enroll a certain percentage of women in the studies and , in many cases , a certain percentage of racial minorities . But opening this door to better and certainly more equitable science has not resulted in a flood of candidates . Many studies designed to include minority women are sorely lacking in participants . &quot; Almost all_the studies going_on right now are underrepresented in terms of women of color , &quot; says Dr. Antronette K . Yancey , an assistant_professor of public health at UCLA . The reasons for the poor participation are complex and suggest that improvements won ' t be simple to achieve . According to Dr. Machelle Allen , an obstetrician at the New York University Medical_Center who has studied the issue , the reasons include : * a history of unethical and abusive studies involving minority groups ; * discrimination in medical_care ; * practical barriers , such_as a lack of transportation to clinical trials or time to participate in them . According to an article by Allen in a recent issue of the Journal of the American Medical Women ' s Assn. , the efforts to establish race-based quotas for participation in clinical research will be unsuccessful unless these problems are addressed . &quot; These are complicated issues , &quot; Yancey acknowledges . &quot; ( Participation in studies ) takes a certain attitude and mind-set . But before that , it takes a lot of information. &quot; * From a historical perspective , it should be no surprise that minorities -- especially women -- distrust clinical research , which oftentimes divides patients into two groups -- one group receives the experimental therapy and the other receives a placebo or no therapy . Some of the most notorious examples of unethical medical research involved minority groups , says Leslie Laurence , co-author of the book &quot; Outrageous Practices : The Alarming Truths About How Medicine Treats Women &quot; ( Fawcett Columbine , 1994 ) . &quot; There is the fear on the part of some minority women that they are going_to be used as guinea_pigs , &quot; says Laurence , whose book documents how women in_general have been ignored in medical research . &quot; It ' s the legend of Tuskegee. &quot; The infamous 1932 Tuskegee study looked_at untreated syphilis in black_men . Treatment with penicillin was withheld from the men even though their death rate was twice as high as normal . The study was eventually exposed and halted . And there are other examples . Between 1845 and 1849 , Dr. J . Marion Sims -- widely known as the &quot; father of American gynecology &quot; -- performed 42 surgeries on Alabama slave women without their consent or the comfort of anesthesia in search of a cure for fistulas ( a tear from the bladder to the vagina ) , Laurence recounts in her book . And , in the 1950s , a group of mostly poor Mexican American women were enrolled in a trial to study the side_effects of oral_contraceptives . According to Allen , all_the women thought they would receive oral_contraceptives . None of the women were informed that they would actually be taking a placebo some of the time . Ten became pregnant while on the placebo . While oversight committees -- called institutional review boards -- are now used to protect patients and ensure that ethical guidelines are met in clinical trials , conducted under scientifically rigorous conditions , the mistrust lingers , Allen says . &quot; The history of abuse in the name of research has created fear and skepticism , &quot; she says in her journal report . &quot; It will take more_than the assurance of an institutional review board to undo the generations of harm done_by research abuse. &quot; Besides trust , many people simply do not know that they are eligible to participate in medical studies . This is especially true of disadvantaged women , particularly minorities who may_not even see a doctor or go_to a clinic on a regular basis , Laurence says . &quot; The care these women get is often fragmented . They already feel frustration with the medical system . And often , to get_into a trial , you have to be referred by your personal doctor , &quot; she says . Practical issues also come_into play . &quot; If a woman is also low income , she may_not have the child_care or transportation to get_to the trial site , &quot; Laurence says . &quot; Altruism isn ' t enough of a reason to take a bus for two hours. &quot; * Experts agree that diversifying studies will result in more precise medical_practices that are based on gender and ethnic makeup . For instance , in certain ethnic_groups , some drugs are metabolized differently , and some diseases are more prevalent and even appear deadlier . &quot; We want to be sure that a new treatment . . . would apply equally across various ethnic_groups , &quot; says Dr. John S . Kovach , executive_vice_president for medical and scientific affairs at the City of Hope National Medical_Center in Duarte . Biological differences among ethnic_groups , while rare , are of extreme importance in medicine . For example , a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Assn . found that black_women with breast_cancer are more_than twice as likely to die from it as white_women , in part because the malignancies are often more aggressive and fast-growing . Thus , the results of the 16 # 000-women , $ 68-million Breast_Cancer Prevention Trial to test tamoxifen for disease prevention will be , perhaps , of greater significance to African American women . &quot; We certainly are anxious to recruit women of color , &quot; says Dr. Leslie Ford , who is directing the study for the National Cancer Institute . &quot; In black_women , breast_cancer rates are higher at a younger age . And when they get_it they seem to die more often . That is why we need to know what happens with the ( black ) women who take tamoxifen. &quot; Researchers exploring AIDS treatments are also concerned about minority involvement in trials , Allen says . For example , the early studies on zidovudine -- the first approved treatment for HIV -- did not address possible racial differences . Blacks and Latinos , especially women , are still slightly underrepresented in some studies at the UCLA CARE Center , says the director , Dr. Ronald Mitsuyasu . The center -- which stands_for Clinical AIDS Research and Education -- is one of the leading AIDS research institutes in the nation , with more_than 11 # 000 people involved in studies . &quot; We recognized quite early that we were deficient in terms of our minority enrollment . But it hasn ' t been easy , &quot; Mitsuyasu says . The CARE Center has offered taxi and bus vouchers , free meals and child_care to attract study volunteers . Researchers are even giving more attention to the demands of their studies , looking_for ways to reduce tests or clinic visits that are not essential . &quot; We need to think long and hard about whether we absolutely need a certain test , such_as a weekly blood_test , in a study , &quot; Mitsuyasu says . &quot; Just from a fairness standpoint , we have to make_it easier for people for whom it ' s not easy to participate. &quot; * Yancey has demonstrated that if you make_it easy and understandable , they will come . To recruit volunteers for her study on how diet and exercise can influence the health of African American women , she hit the public_lecture circuit , ran radio spots and newspaper blurbs , and offered participants a free three-month fitness-club membership and a cookbook featuring the healthiest recipes of black American chefs . Yancey also appealed_to the women ' s sense of fairness with the message that cancer and heart_disease kill African Americans more_than any other group . &quot; When programs are developed to fight cancer and heart_disease , our voices must be heard . After all , our tax dollars are paying_for it , &quot; she said in the study literature and radio spots . When told what the study entailed and how they would benefit , the women had no hesitation . &quot; I have connective_tissue disease , and I had gained 20 pounds in the last six months . So I felt that anything that can benefit my health would be great , &quot; says Peyton Chappell , 44 , who joined the study . Debra Moore , 43 , says she was intrigued with a medical study that was exclusively for black_women . &quot; I thought , ' Well , that ' s a new concept. ' You hear about studies all_the time with Caucasian males , and even white_women . So when they get_around_to studying black_women , I figured , ' it ' s my turn , ' &quot; she says . Researchers hope that attitude catches_on as they begin recruitment this winter on the largest-ever study on women -- the Women ' s Health Initiative -- which will involve 163 # 000 post-menopausal women at 40 research_centers nationwide . The 15-year , $ 628-million trial will study chronic diseases that affect women . And , in the most sweeping attempt ever to include minorities in medical research , various centers will set goals for minority recruitment ranging from 10 % to 60 % of their total participants . &quot; The Women ' s Health Initiative is making an enormous attempt to recruit minority women , &quot; says Dr. Howard Judd , the principal_investigator at UCLA for the trial . &quot; And there is serious concern about the ability to do this -- it ' s one thing to recruit African American women , but there are now , in California , so many minority groups. &quot; But because the Women ' s Health Initiative was largely conceived as a result of the longstanding exclusion of women and minorities from medical research , to settle for less would be wrong , Judd says . &quot; There was so little work being done_in minorities and in women that we really need to recoup that and make an effort to bring them in. &quot; How to Be a Test Subject * The Women ' s Health Initiative . Open_to post-menopausal women of all ethnicities , ages 50 to 79 , who plan to live within the area for at least three years . ( 800 ) 54-WOMEN . * The Breast_Cancer Prevention Trial . Open_to women 35 to 59 , of all ethnicities , who are at high risk for developing breast_cancer . ( 800 ) 4-CANCER . * The Eating and Exercising for a Cancer-free Life study .
