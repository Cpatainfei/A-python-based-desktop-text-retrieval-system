   <HEADLINE> U.N. CHIEF BALKS AT AIR STRIKES IN BOSNIA ; REPORT : BOUTROS-GHALI SAYS THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH GROUND FORCES IN PLACE TO MAKE AIR_POWER EFFECTIVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali held_back Wednesday from ordering immediate air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina , arguing that they would be useless without a ground offensive that the United Nations is now too weak to mount . The secretary_general ' s decision , announced in a report to the Security_Council , came despite the pressure of a NATO summit communique a week ago that threatened air strikes and called_on the United Nations to draw_up urgent plans for ordering them . His report made_it clear that he is not yet ready to take the responsibility of ordering the planes of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization into action against Bosnian Serbs . Boutros-Ghali dealt with only two areas : the towns of Srebrenica , where Serbs have refused to allow the replacement of 150 Canadian peacekeepers by Dutch troops , and Tuzla , where Serbs have closed the airport to humanitarian relief flights . The secretary_general said it is clear in both cases that &quot; the use of air_power , or the threat of its use , could not alone achieve the desired objectives. &quot; &quot; Other military assets &quot; would be required , the secretary_general said , adding , however , that these &quot; assets &quot; would be &quot; in excess of those currently available &quot; to the United Nations in Bosnia . Spokesman Joe Sills told reporters that the secretary_general was clearly referring to the need for ground support . Boutros-Ghali told the Security_Council that he had instructed his chief aide in the former Yugoslav federation , Yasushi Akashi of Japan , &quot; to prepare forthwith detailed plans for military operations , with the use of air_power as required . . . and to submit these plans to me as a matter of urgency. &quot; But regarding ground forces , Boutros-Ghali has been unable to persuade governments to contribute more_than half the 7 # 600 troops already authorized to guard Srebrenica , Tuzla and other Muslim enclaves designated &quot; safe areas &quot; by the United Nations . Sills emphasized that the United Nations cannot come_up with more troops if governments persist_in refusing to send them . &quot; We don ' t have troops , &quot; the secretary_general ' s spokesman said . &quot; We don ' t print money . We don ' t have ships . . . . We depend_on the member states. &quot; Boutros-Ghali ' s report , according to diplomatic sources , also appeared to rebuff a proposal by Britain and France that he speed_up the procedure for ordering air strikes . They wanted him to give Akashi the authority to order the strikes in Srebrenica and Tuzla upon the recommendation of Lt . Gen . Jean Cot of France , the U.N. military commander in the former Yugoslav federation . Instead , Boutros-Ghali asked Akashi to make a preliminary study . In that study , Akashi concluded that air strikes by themselves would not do the job . Any discussion about the use of air_power in Srebrenica may be moot : Boutros-Ghali said Akashi is trying to arrange the exchange of Canadian and Dutch troops by &quot; political agreement &quot; with the Serbs .</TEXT>
