   <HEADLINE> EAST VALLEY FOCUS : NORTH HOLLYWOOD ; CONCERT TO AID CHURCH HIT BY EARTHQUAKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a musical show of Christian solidarity , members of a Shadow Hills church will gather to sing and raise money for another congregation , whose North Hollywood sanctuary was shaken to its foundations by the Northridge earthquake . Damage from the Jan . 17 temblor left the main worship hall of the First Presbyterian_Church a shambles , and the small congregation , about 140 of whom attend services on an average Sunday , facing a $ 1-million bill to rebuild . A May 22 benefit_concert of original Christian music by the group All God ' s Children will not generate enough money to shore_up the church ' s sagging roof and repair cracked walls , but the musicians hope to offer moral support while raising some funds . &quot; We feel that it ( music ) is a gift that we ' ve been given , and we like to give it back , &quot; said group member Carol Browning , who attends the Shadow Hills Presbyterian_Church . The sanctuary was red-tagged after the quake , but then inspectors decided it might be repairable , said the church ' s pastor , the Rev . John Moody . But a repair job looks as if it would carry a price_tag as high as replacement , Moody said . Another cheaper -- but still costly -- option would be to tear_down the sanctuary and remodel another building on the church ' s small campus to take the place of the main sanctuary . &quot; We ' ve received money from congregations throughout the United States , &quot; Moody said , but other small churches are not rich either . The donations so far total about $ 15 # 000 . When asked how his congregation would raise the necessary funds , Moody said , &quot; I don ' t know. &quot; The church belongs_to the Presbyterian_Church of the United States of America , an umbrella organization that sometimes offers congregations low-interest loans , but Moody said he didn ' t know if the larger body would underwrite a $ 1-million loan for such a small congregation . At the moment , though , he ' s concerning himself with the planned evening of music and the fellowship offered by another church . The benefit_concert , featuring musicians Browning , Pamela Brownlee and Bob Marlowe , will be presented at 7 p.m. at Caldwell Hall on the damaged church ' s campus , 11640 Hesby St. , North Hollywood . Admission is $ 10 , $ 5 for those 18 and under , and a maximum of $ 25 per family . ERIC SLATER</TEXT>
