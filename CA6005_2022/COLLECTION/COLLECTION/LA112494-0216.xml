   <TEXT> Palestinian mediators announced late Wednesday that they achieved a temporary truce between Yasser Arafat ' s fledgling self-rule authority and Islamic opponents in the Gaza Strip . The agreement , reached nearly one week after Palestinian police opened_fire on militant Islamic protesters , called_for both sides to refrain_from further violence until a permanent understanding can be reached . At least 13 people were killed and about 130 were wounded in the clashes . The agreement is aimed at ensuring peace and order during a memorial gathering Friday for a Hamas guerrilla leader killed last year by undercover Israeli soldiers . Sayed abu Musameh , a senior Hamas leader in Gaza , said the rally will be a display of support for Hamas , but said those at the rally will abide_by the law . Arafat on Wednesday staged his second show of strength since last Friday ' s bloody showdown with Islamic militants , assembling thousands of supporters -- some armed and firing weapons in the air -- to tout his preeminence as Palestinian leader . Buses poured into this drowsy market_town , disgorging loyalists from Arafat ' s Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization . In the West_Bank , about 3 # 000 demonstrators packed Jericho ' s rocky soccer field in a hard , cold rain , chanting promises to sacrifice &quot; blood and soul &quot; for their leader and his embattled self-rule government . On Monday , Arafat brought_out 10 # 000 Fatah followers for a rally in Gaza City . Violence linked to opposition to the peace accord between Israel and the PLO continued . In the occupied West_Bank , Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian guerrilla after he and another gunman ambushed the soldiers , witnesses and Israeli security sources said . They said the two guerrillas , armed with AK-47 assault_rifles , opened_fire on an Israeli paramilitary border police patrol in the center of the town of Janin . The troops shot back , killing one . The other guerrilla fled , they said . On Tuesday , gunmen in a Gaza orange grove wounded Capt . Jamal abu Toma in the leg , in the first ambush of a Palestinian police_officer . No one claimed responsibility , but fundamentalists were widely assumed to have staged the attack . A new survey said two-thirds of the Palestinians support a dialogue between the PLO and the Islamic factions . The survey of 1 # 076 Palestinians was taken Nov . 17-19 , with most of the interviews conducted before the Gaza clashes . It was carried_out by the Center for Palestine Research and Studies , based in Nablus in the West_Bank , and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage_points . Arafat and Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin will receive the Spanish Prince of Asturias peace prize today in Madrid , before meeting to discuss peace in Gaza .</TEXT>
