   <HEADLINE> FAITHFUL FEW KEEP EYE ON U.S. SOCCER_BALL ; SPORTS : AVID FANS IN MISSION VIEJO DELIGHT IN THEIR PRE-WORLD CUP ACCESS TO THE AMERICAN TEAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If this were Germany or Brazil , and the national soccer team was training a_few weeks before playing host to the World Cup , there would be hundreds of fans around the practice field , jostling to catch a peek of their heroes . But this is the United States , land of soccer heathens , and Orange County , home of fickle fans . So it ' s no wonder only a handful of spectators were_on the_hill overlooking the U.S. National Training Center recently , watching the U.S. team begin its final month of preparation for the Cup . Would players like to see the Mission Viejo facility teeming with fans every day ? Sure , that would be great for American soccer , long a laggard compared to the rest of the world ' s soccer-worshiping nations . But for those in Orange County who do care about the sport , and for the city of Mission Viejo , the U.S. team has been a godsend . &quot; I think every day how lucky I am , &quot; said Dan Zaccuri , a 33-year-old Costa Mesa construction worker and youth soccer coach . &quot; This is the first time the World Cup has come_to the U.S. , and I can stop in during the middle of the day and watch the team practice . There are people around the world who would kill to be able to do that , and I do_it all_the time. &quot; Zaccuri knows this is about to change . When the team resumes practice this week after a three-game , East-Coast exhibition swing , crowds will likely be larger than the dozen or so that have followed recent workouts . Security will be much tighter around the complex ; the number of camera crews , reporters and photographers will multiply , and the facility will be closed to the public on June 13 , four days before the start of the 24-team World Cup . What ' s more , the team , almost completely accessible for the past 17 months , will be sequestered at the Dana Point Resort in early June . But Zaccuri will always have fond memories of the day his 9-year-old son , Roman , met Coach Bora Milutinovic and kicked a ball around with U.S. team midfielder Cobi Jones . Tom Spry , manager of a Ballpark Pizza Team restaurant in Mission Viejo , will remember all_the U.S. players and coaches who frequented his establishment , chatted with customers and signed autographs on the wall . Roy Cain , manager of Hennessey ' s Tavern in Laguna Beach , will remember the night U.S. team defender Alexi Lalas and his band played in his pub . And kids from the Santa Ana Boys and Girls Club will remember the day several U.S. players put_on a free clinic for them . that ' s the way it has been since January , 1993 . The U.S. soccer team has blended into Orange County , touching the lives of many soccer fans without causing so_much as a stir among non-fans ; putting Mission Viejo back on the national and international map without creating a major flap . Unlike the circus atmosphere that accompanies many of the world ' s great national soccer teams , the U.S. team has gone_about its business in Mission Viejo with virtually no distractions . Nor has it been a distraction . &quot; We ' ve enjoyed all_the benefits from the publicity they ' ve generated without the detriments you ' d normally associate with having a major team , &quot; said Robert D . Breton , a Mission Viejo councilman . &quot; There ' s been no traffic_jams ( around the complex ) , no loitering , no major crowds to control . It ' s been completely benign. &quot; Some think too benign . &quot; A lot of people in Mission Viejo don ' t even realize the national team is training here , &quot; said Petar Vasilev , a 25-year-old salesman who moved from Columbus , Ohio , to Orange County six months ago and regularly attends practice . &quot; In any other country , people would be fighting for a place to watch. &quot; Some area merchants believe the community got more excited about the 1984 Olympics , when Mission Viejo was a venue for cycling events . &quot; The only reason is because the team hasn ' t been promoted as well as it could have , &quot; said Debbie Santoro , community relations director for Bank of Orange County , located across the street from the training center . &quot; But they ' re great guys , and we ' re glad to have them . I think the players have touched a lot of kids ' lives. &quot; World Cup fever hasn ' t exactly gripped the entire Saddleback Valley , but there ' s a bug going_around the soccer community . Spry turned one wall of his restaurant into a World Cup shrine . The back wall_in Santoro ' s bank is covered with soccer paraphernalia . The U.S. team was featured in Mission Viejo ' s St . Patrick ' s Day parade , and the city named the street entering the training facility World Cup Center Drive . The Mission Viejo region of the American Youth Soccer Organization , already one of the nation ' s largest with an average initial April enrollment of 2 # 600 to 2 # 800 , had 3 # 400 sign-ups this April , according to Bill Irvine , AYSO scheduler for South County . And many afternoons , kids have hung_out at the training center , hoping to meet the players and get a_few autographs . &quot; If you ' re into soccer , there ' s never been anything like this and there won ' t be again , &quot; said Phil Serrins , a Mission Viejo chiropractor . &quot; You have all these young_men who are the best players in the country . They ' ve gone_to ceremonies , classrooms , hospitals and put_on clinics . They ' ve been totally accessible , which has been great for the kids. &quot; Serrins , a member of the Mission Viejo Soccer Foundation booster group , was responsible_for matching U.S. players and support personnel with about 35 host families , who helped team members and their families acclimate to the area . Serrins ' family hosts U.S. goalie Tony Meola , who has spent many days at the Serrins house eating home-cooked meals , relaxing and talking soccer . &quot; My 15-year old is a goalie , &quot; Serrins said . &quot; It can ' t hurt to have one of the best goalies in the world hanging_out with your kid. &quot; Being a host family also has other privileges , such_as meeting Pele when the former Brazilian soccer great was at the training facility to film a MasterCard commercial last year . &quot; Pele kissed my daughter on the cheek and took a picture with her , &quot; Serrins said . &quot; that ' s like me meeting Babe_Ruth . She ' ll remember that for the rest of her life. &quot; Players -- at least the ones who haven ' t been cut as the team pares its roster to the final 22 -- will likely leave Mission Viejo with fond memories , too . For them , the training center , which includes a grass field and a clubhouse , has provided something no other U.S. national soccer team has ever had -- a permanent home . Sure , it rained for a_few weeks after they arrived in January , 1993 , there were disastrous fires last fall , and the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake scared the cleats off them . But all_in all , the weather has been very good , and living and training conditions have been a major upgrade from the past , when the U.S. roster was a team of nomads , assembling a_few months before competitions , playing exhibition_games and living_out of suitcases . &quot; We ' ve definitely experienced everything -- the rains , the fires , the earthquake -- but it ' s been great , &quot; said Marcelo Balboa , a U.S. team defender since 1988 . &quot; In the past , the only time we had a home was when we were_on the road . Now , we see each other every day , and we ' re more of a family instead of acquaintances . We feel_like we ' re more of a team now. &quot; The team has grown_up together the past year and a half . The wives of three players , Peter Vermes , Desmond Armstrong and Janusz Michallik , and one assistant coach , Steve Sampson , have had babies since moving to Mission Viejo . Meola was married , and defender Mike Lapper and team press officer Dean Linke got engaged . &quot; Nobody ' s got divorced since we ' ve been here -- that ' s good , &quot; said Bill Nuttall , U.S. team general_manager . &quot; We ' ve been able to settle into a community , and it ' s given us a sense of belonging . Hopefully , that will provide a benefit for us. &quot; There have been benefits to the local economy , as well . According to Nuttall , about $ 3.5 million in team salaries has been eligible to be spent during the team ' s stay in Orange County . In addition , U.S. team officials have written checks totaling $ 23 # 000 a month to several apartment complexes in the Mission Viejo area to pay_for team housing . Four players have bought homes_in the Saddleback Valley . Players have purchased and leased cars and opened bank_accounts . The team has bought an average of 15 rooms per night at the Laguna Hills Holiday Inn and has had numerous receptions , banquets and news luncheons . Restaurants around Cal State Fullerton and Trabuco Hills High_School , where the team has played exhibitions , have done brisk business . Javier Sosa , who owns the Dos Tacos restaurant across the street from the training center , said 15 % to 20 % of his business can be attributed to soccer-related customers . &quot; They ' ve had a huge economic impact , &quot; said Karen Irvine , press officer for the Mission Viejo Soccer Foundation . &quot; It ' s been a great investment for the city. &quot; The U.S. team has also been a public relations bonanza for Mission Viejo . Linke said media representatives from every country in the World Cup have visited the training center . &quot; The Nadadores ( swim club ) may have put us on the map , but this has given us worldwide recognition in the world ' s most popular sport , &quot; Breton said . &quot; To be mentioned in articles printed from Hong Kong to Australia to France , Saudi_Arabia and Germany gives us global recognition we could never purchase . &quot; Without fail , everyone I meet immediately tells me , ' I wish I could live here. ' So I think the ripple effect will extend for many years to come. &quot; Mission Viejo ' s relationship with World Cup soccer won ' t last forever . Nuttall said the U.S. team is planning to vacate the facility Aug . 31 , when their contract expires , and there have been reports that the team will move its headquarters to Orlando , Fla . But the team will have a lasting effect on Mission Viejo -- primarily in the form of the first-class facility that Kelly Doyle , city parks and community services director , said will be used for youth and adult soccer after the team leaves . As for converting the masses -- or at least raising the interest level in a sport that is foreign to most Americans -- the U.S. team ' s performance in the World Cup could go_a_long_way toward determining whether American fans embrace soccer . &quot; I think the World Cup will open some eyes , &quot; said Lalas , the most recognized U.S. player because of his wild red hair , straggly goatee and effusive personality . &quot; People aren ' t going_to become soccer lunatics , but it will give them a greater respect for the game. &quot; Orange County and the World Cup TOURNAMENT FORMAT Number of finalists : 24 , including the host U.S. team Sites : Rose Bowl , Pasadena ; Stanford Stadium , Stanford ; Soldier Field , Chicago ; Cotton Bowl , Dallas ; Pontiac ( Mich. ) Silverdome ; Giants Stadium , East Rutherford , N.J. ; Florida Citrus Bowl , Orlando , Fla. ; RFK Stadium , Washington ; Foxboro Stadium , Foxboro , Mass .
