   <HEADLINE> SCREENING ROOM : ' ROOSTERS , ' COMPELLING ' BROTHER ' AT AFI FEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Among the key AFI Film Festival offerings not already reviewed during the opening weekend at the Monica 4-Plex are Robert M . Young ' s flawed but admirably venturesome &quot; Roosters &quot; ( Saturday at 3:50 and 9:40 p.m. ) and Mariano Barroso ' s absorbing , stylish suspense drama &quot; My Soul Brother &quot; ( Saturday at 9:10 p.m. ) . &quot; Roosters , &quot; written by Milcha Sanchez-Scott , is an instance of the right material in the wrong medium . It ' s a highly theatrical allegory with numerous verbal flights of poetic fancy that cries_for the proscenium . The story ' s ultra-realistic setting , a modest dwelling in the sun-parched rural Southwest , keeps reminding us that people don ' t talk that way in real_life . ( On screen it probably would have worked better filmed against stylized sets. ) At heart it ' s a power struggle , illuminating what it means to be a man , between a young Chicano ( Danny Nucci ) and his father ( Edward James Olmos ) , who has just finished a seven-year stretch for manslaughter . Olmos wants to immediately resume cockfighting , which got him into trouble in the first place , but his son is searching for a way_out toward a better life . In the &quot; My Soul Brother ' s &quot; succinct prologue , shot in black-and-white , a young_woman , Julia ( Lydia Bosch ) , jilts Toni ( Juanjo Puigcorse ) for his brother Carlos ( Carlos Hipolito ) ; 10 years pass , and we find Julia , a flight_attendant , and Carlos , an insurance salesman with a bright future , living happily together . Out of the blue , Toni , a virile , reckless type , shows_up to turn their lives upside down . Barroso , an AFI , USC and Sundance alumnus , begins in a low key and , as Toni insinuates himself into his younger brother ' s life , masterfully revs_up the tension so slowly you barely notice . This Spanish film proceeds with assured psychological validity : You understand why Julia can be both attracted to and repelled by the uninhibited Toni , so compellingly played by Puigcorse -- and why Carlos is so vulnerable to his elder brother ' s manipulations .
