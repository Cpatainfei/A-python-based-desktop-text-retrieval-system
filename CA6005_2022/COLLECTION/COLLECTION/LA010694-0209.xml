   <HEADLINE> RESTRICTIONS AT PRIVATE GOLF_CLUBS ARE TEEING OFF PLENTY OF WOMEN ; FEMALE PLAYERS OFTEN FIND THEY ' RE NOT WELCOME IN A WORLD OF MALE PRIVILEGE . BUT STATES ARE HELPING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Women are heading to golf_courses in unprecedented numbers nationwide , but they don ' t always find the welcome_mat when they attempt to tee_off . The reception at some private clubs can be downright chilly , thanks to restrictive membership policies , limited tee times and curtailed privileges . Close to 40 % of beginning golfers are women , and their numbers have been steadily increasing for several years , according to the National Golf Foundation of Jupiter , Fla . But many apparently quit in frustration over difficulties in gaining access to courses . The $ 20-billion-a-year golf industry is wooing female executives by promoting the game as a savvy business tool . But at certain private clubs , working women may find few tee times available during their off-hours . Now , several states are using tougher laws to wage an incremental war against the remnants of male privilege on the golf_course . * Minnesota denies property_tax breaks to private golf_clubs that discriminate . And a bill to be introduced this year would amend the state ' s human_rights act to include a ban on discrimination based on marital_status . * Michigan amended its civil_rights act in 1992 to include many private clubs under provisions prohibiting discrimination . * The Wisconsin Legislature is considering a bill that could revoke liquor_licenses of golf_courses that discriminate against women in assigning weekend tee times . Traditionally , private clubs have been able to operate as they wish , picking and choosing their members and rules . The contention is that they are protected by constitutional right to freedom of association . Federal law doesn ' t prohibit sex discrimination by private clubs . Although such discrimination is gaining attention among women ' s rights groups , the issue must compete with myriad causes . &quot; It ' s one of many economic issues , &quot; said Kim Gandy , vice_president of the National Organization for Women in Washington , D.C. &quot; We believe women should have equal access to the country ' s economic mainstream , and in that sense golf_clubs are part of it , but only one part. &quot; More pressing for many NOW members are issues including equal pay , the glass ceiling and sexual_harassment , she said . One woman ' s experience helped force the Minnesota law changes . Mary McCourtney Heilman and her husband joined Interlachen Country_Club in Edina , Minn. , in 1974 . Her husband was considered the club shareholder , and she was subject_to restricted tee times . When McCourtney Heilman ' s husband died in 1988 , he bequeathed her the golf membership -- but the club told her she could not have it . She was made an associate member and her monthly dues were cut_in half , but McCourtney Heilman said that she wasn ' t allowed to play golf whenever she wished . When she remarried , she was kicked_out of the club . &quot; Most men said that ' s just the way the rules are , &quot; McCourtney Heilman said . According to Interlachen general_manager Tom Wurr , &quot; There is absolutely no difference in treatment between men and women under any circumstances. &quot; The club , which Wurr said is in full compliance with state law , decided earlier this year to change the provision that axed McCourtney Heilman ' s membership . A surviving spouse who remarries now may retain associate membership . But a married_couple must still designate one person as the stockholder . That person holds the membership and voting_rights . &quot; I can tell you that Interlachen has never rejected a female applicant , at least to my knowledge , &quot; Wurr said . He would not reveal how many female stockholders the club has , except to say they are in the minority . When Minnesota State Sen . Ember Reichgott Junge was told about McCourtney Heilman ' s treatment , she sponsored an amendment passed last year that eliminated tax_breaks for clubs that discriminate in membership or selection on the basis of marital_status . Minnesota golf_courses enjoy a considerable property_tax rate break under open space laws . In 1986 , the state banned discrimination on the basis of gender , or else higher rates would apply . But Minnesota ' s Stillwater Country_Club decided to pay the higher tax rather than change its membership bylaws . Women could not be_full members . So this year , the Legislature upped the ante . Effective in 1995 , Minnesota county assessors will figure the tax_rate as if the non-complying club ' s land were not only converted for development , but also available for_sale as individual parcels . In the case of Stillwater Country_Club , the valuation would rise from $ 1.5 million to about $ 6 million , forcing the club to pay about $ 238 # 000 more each year in taxes . Stillwater has changed its policy and starting in January , women may hold full memberships . Family memberships now are held_in the man ' s name . Nationally , many clubs are believed to have changed with the times , especially in light of anti-discrimination policies adopted by organizations , including the Ladies Professional_Golf Assn . The LPGA adopted a policy in 1991 that requires tournament sponsors to hold events at courses that do not discriminate in membership policies on the basis of race , religion , gender or national origin . A Growing Force The number of female golfers in the United States , defined as players over age 12 at all levels , as been increasing steadily for several years : 1987 : 4.8 million 1988 : 5.1 million 1992 : 5.4 million * * About 40 % of the players who have taken_up the game since 1986 are women . * 22 % of those who say they play_on a regular basis are women .
