   <HEADLINE> NO EVIDENCE OF ' SUGAR HIGH ' IN CHILDREN FOUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The myth of the &quot; sugar high &quot; may finally be laid_to_rest by a comprehensive new study that concludes that consuming large quantities of sugar does not make children hyperactive , experts said Wednesday . Many scientists have long believed that sugar-laced foods pose no threat to children other_than tooth_decay and obesity , but the new study , published today in the New England Journal of Medicine &quot; should have a great impact with the general public , &quot; said Dr. Joseph Biederman of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . In the study , researchers prepared all food eaten by 48 children and their families for nine weeks and carefully observed their behavior . &quot; There is no evidence sugar has an adverse effect on children ' s behavior , &quot; said Dr. Mark L . Wolraich of Vanderbilt University , who directed the research . &quot; Every well-controlled study has now shown that there is no link between sugar and behavior , &quot; said Dr. Judith Rapoport of the National Institute of Mental Health . &quot; This is absolutely a dead issue. &quot; The idea that sugar causes hyperactivity is the second widely accepted myth about the disorder to be discredited in recent years . During the 1980s , similar research disproved the belief that food_additives and coloring agents , such_as red dye , caused hyperactivity . That notion had caused many parents to adopt the so-called Feingold diet , in which the additives were rigorously excluded from children ' s diets . Although many insisted that the diet was effective , most researchers now believe that the perceived benefits were really a result of the increased parental attention necessary to keep the children on the diet . The links to sugar and dyes , Rapoport said , &quot; have nothing to do with real data , but a lot to do with people ' s frustration and needing answers and better treatment that are not yet forthcoming. &quot; Although the elimination of sugar and food_additives leaves the world without a pop-culture explanation of hyperactivity , researchers believe they are making progress in identifying its causes . Scientists are zeroing_in on a gene that seems to be associated with the disorder , and others have identified subtle brain differences that may contribute to it . Hyperactivity , more properly known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD , is the most common psychiatric diagnosis in American children , affecting as_many as 9 % . Its major symptoms include a short attention_span , difficulty with or inability to finish projects , a low tolerance for frustration and inability to get_along_with other children and adults . Physicians had thought that most children outgrew the condition , but new evidence suggests that it can be a lifelong problem that is manifested as drug_abuse , frequent job changes and even criminal behavior among adults . By some estimates , as_many as 15 million adult Americans suffer from the disorder . The most common treatment for children and teen-agers involves the central_nervous_system stimulant Ritalin , which -- paradoxically -- seems to calm children and enable them to focus_on tasks . Many critics argue that Ritalin is overprescribed ; recent surveys have shown that it is taken by about 3.6 % of elementary_school children and 1.5 % of those in middle_school and junior_high . Wolraich ' s study involved 25 children ages 3 to 5 , and 23 children ages 6 to 10 . The older group had all been identified by their parents as being sensitive to sugar . Psychiatric screening identified nearly a third as having attention_deficit_disorder or a related disorder . At the beginning of the study , dietitians went_into each of the homes and removed all food . They provided the family with precooked meals and all_the other food they needed each week , including snacks , food for guests and even food for parties at school . The families spent three weeks on each of three diets -- one containing sugar , one containing the artificial sweetener aspartame ( better known as Nutrasweet ) and one containing saccharin . Neither the families nor the researchers knew which diets they were receiving . Parents , teachers and baby-sitters all provided careful evaluations of the children ' s activities each week . The bottom_line , Wolraich said , was that the older children ' s behavior did not change , no matter what diet they were eating . Among the younger children , small differences turned_up in three of 31 measurements . In one of these , the parents ' ratings of their children ' s school performance , behavior actually improved when they were_on the sugar diets . The two other measurements showed that the youngsters moved more slowly on a pegboard test when they were eating sugar . Those results suggest that sugar does not trigger hyperactivity and in some cases might actually have a calming effect , but the effect was very small , Wolraich said . Experts noted that sugar can provide an energy boost , but that does not normally produce a behavioral change . Wolraich concedes that his results may_not convince everyone . &quot; With some parents , it ' s a belief and no matter what we say they are not likely to make a change . The best we can do is provide a good quality study and make them aware of it , and then let them make their own decision. &quot;</TEXT>
