   <HEADLINE> 1998 ELECTRIC_CAR DEADLINE BACKED ; POLLUTION : STATE AIR BOARD ' S STAFF REBUTS CONTENTION BY THE AUTO INDUSTRY THAT TECHNOLOGY IS NOT FAR ENOUGH ALONG . THE BOARD WILL TAKE_UP THE MATTER NEXT MONTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Laying the groundwork for a contentious vote next month , the staff of the California Air Resources Board recommended Thursday that the state go_forward with its mandate for mass-produced electric_cars beginning in 1998 . The Air Resources Board meets May 12 and 13 in Los Angeles to decide whether automotive_technology has advanced enough to uphold a standard that requires major car_companies to begin selling thousands of electric vehicles in California every year . While the U.S. auto industry contends that batteries will remain too unrefined and costly to meet the deadline , the ARB staff insists that several advanced technologies can be ready for commercial production by then . Thursday ' s recommendation to the board echoes technical findings that the ARB issued in March . Under the state ' s standard , 2 % of vehicles sold by each major manufacturer in California each year must be emission-free beginning in 1998 . That amounts to 20 # 000 to 25 # 000 cars . The volume increases to 5 % in 2001 and 10 % in 2003 . Companies violating the standard could lose their certification to sell cars in California . As the deadline approaches , auto_makers -- particularly Detroit ' s Big Three -- have been putting increasing pressure on California to grant delays . At a five-hour workshop in March , U.S. car_makers said they could not be ready until at least mid-2001 . ARB officials said Thursday , however , that the timetable can be met . Electric vehicles &quot; are more possible than ever before , &quot; James Boyd , the ARB ' s executive_officer , said Thursday . If the mandate is weakened , auto_makers will not be aggressive in bringing cleaner-burning cars to California , the staff said in its report . &quot; Tremendous technological progress has been made_over the last few years , &quot; the ARB report says , &quot; and . . . the mandate is the reason that much of this development has taken place. &quot; The ARB must review its zero-emission mandates every two years . Next month ' s decision is pivotal , because it is the last realistic chance the auto_companies will have to delay the standards before they must make major investments in manufacturing plants . If they fail , the industry ' s only other option is to persuade Congress to intervene . ARB members , led by Gov . Pete Wilson ' s newly appointed chairwoman , Jacqueline Schafer , so far have showed strong support for the mandate . ARB staff_members say it is not technology that is impeding electric_cars but the reluctance of U.S. car_makers to invest adequately . The car_companies , however , say they are worried they will have to rush to market with a product that is not viable for consumers . A reasonably priced , high-energy battery is considered crucial to the success of electric vehicles . Without it , cars must be frequently recharged . Today ' s lead-acid battery packs can power a car for about 100 miles , while more advanced prototypes have a range of more_than 200 miles . &quot; EVs ( electric vehicles ) have three problems : cost , range and infrastructure , &quot; John Williams , a General Motors engineer who represents a consortium of the Big Three auto_makers and battery producers , told the ARB last month . The companies need more time , Williams said , mainly because high-energy batteries are available only as expensive , hand-crafted prototypes . Getting them ready for affordable , high-volume manufacture will take about seven years , Williams said . &quot; The low-cost batteries have low energy and the high-energy ones have high costs , &quot; he said . &quot; What we ' re trying to do is get today ' s $ 40 # 000 battery down to $ 6 # 000. &quot; Williams said the companies expect to have an advanced , well tested battery pack prototype in 1996 , a production plant starting_up in 1998 and enough batteries to meet the mandate in mid-2001 . Even then , Williams warned , &quot; it is a high-risk &quot; venture , since the rest of the car still must be attractive to consumers . Battery manufacturers , however , are more optimistic than the U.S. car_makers . &quot; We ' re completely confident that we can meet all_the goals by 1998 , including the cost . . . . We have no intention of waiting until 1998 to produce these batteries , &quot; Michael Fetcenko , vice_president of technology for Michigan-based Ovonic Battery Co. , recently told the staff . Ovonic ' s advanced nickel-metal-hydride batteries , he said , are &quot; already in high-volume production &quot; for laptop_computers , and in a road_test in GM ' s Impact electric_car , one ran 250 miles without a recharge . Bringing the cost down for cars , he said , &quot; is achievable within three to four years &quot; -- several years sooner than GM ' s Williams predicted . Little is publicly known about how far Japanese auto_makers have progressed , because they have been much quieter than their American counterparts . The ARB staff , however , says it considered confidential_information from Japanese companies in its recommendation . The ARB concedes that cost will be a problem , but only initially . In the first few years , electric_cars will cost $ 5 # 000 to $ 10 # 000 more_than a gasoline-fueled car , but the ARB maintains that as more vehicles are produced , prices will become comparable . The operating_costs will be virtually the same -- 6.3 to 9 cents per mile for an electric_car compared with 7.7 cents per mile for a conventional Ford Escort , according to the ARB report . The oil_industry has argued that using cleaner-burning gasoline and alternative fuels such_as methanol and natural_gas is a more practical and economical way to clean California ' s air . But the ARB staff maintains that zero-emission cars are perhaps the only way to eliminate enough exhaust to achieve health standards .</TEXT>
