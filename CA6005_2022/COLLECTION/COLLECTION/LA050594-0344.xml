   <HEADLINE> EUROPEAN UNION PLAN FOR 4 NEW MEMBERS APPROVED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The European Parliament on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved European Union plans to admit Austria , Finland , Norway and Sweden to the 12-nation bloc . The &quot; yes &quot; removes one hurdle to EU enlargement and throws the spotlight on the four countries , which must gain the backing of their populations in referendums whose outcomes are far from certain . In the European Parliament , the legislative_assembly of the European Communities , what had originally promised to be a nail-biting vote turned_into a massive welcome for the four . The group also endorsed plans to extend the EU to 16 members stretching northward beyond the Arctic_Circle and along Russia ' s western border . Austria and Norway were each approved by a vote of 374 to 24 , while Finland was approved by 374 to 21 and Sweden by 380 to 21 . For the Parliament to give its assent , 259 members of the 517-member house had to vote_in favor in each case . Parliament President Egon Klepsch told a packed , applauding chamber that the vote_in favor of extending the EU will increase confidence in the assembly only six weeks before its elections . &quot; It is a large , warmhearted invitation to join us . It ' s up_to them to decide , &quot; Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos told a news_conference after the vote . Pangalos forecast that the EU ' s 12 national parliaments will have no difficulty in ratifying the accession deals . Diplomats have previously expressed doubts that they can all do so by Jan . 1 , the planned date for enlargement . The large &quot; yes &quot; vote came as a surprise after months of threats by members of the Strasbourg-based Parliament to veto the enlargement plans unless they went side_by_side with an overhaul of the EU ' s institutions .</TEXT>
