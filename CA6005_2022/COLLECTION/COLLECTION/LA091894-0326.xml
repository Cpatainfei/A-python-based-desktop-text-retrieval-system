   <HEADLINE> TORONTO FILM COMPANY GETS ' SOUTHERN EXPOSURE ' ; ENTERTAINMENT : DEBUTING THURSDAY , &quot; DUE_SOUTH &quot; WILL BE THE FIRST CANADIAN-PRODUCED SERIES TO APPEAR ON AN AMERICAN TELEVISION NETWORK IN PRIME_TIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The cast of the new CBS action-comedy series &quot; Due South &quot; perches precariously in a canoe floating , incongruously , in a set built to represent a Chicago sewer tunnel . Series co-star Paul Gross and guest star Leslie Nielsen are suited up in the red-jacketed ceremonial uniform of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police . The other series co-star , David Marciano , sits in mid-canoe , playing a brash , sarcastic Chicago cop . In the rapid-pace dialogue of the scene , Marciano ' s character worries about rats in the water , while Gross ' frets about scuffing the borrowed boat on the sewer wall . Here , in 15 seconds , is the central joke in &quot; Due_South &quot; -- the cultural collision of the naive , ramrod-straight Mountie from the Far North with the gritty American urban-scape . &quot; Due South &quot; was cooked_up by former CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky and Robert Lantos , chairman of Canada ' s largest film production and distribution company , Alliance Communications . The program is a landmark here , not only for Alliance , but also for the entire Canadian film_industry . When &quot; Due South &quot; debuts Thursday it will be the first Canadian-produced series to appear on an American network in prime_time . &quot; Selling a prime-time television series to a U.S. network has pretty well been the exclusive domain of a relatively small number of companies , all_of which are Los Angeles-based , &quot; Lantos said in a recent interview . &quot; Reaching that point ( for Alliance ) . . . was something that has been under way a long time. &quot; But it is only part of a rising American profile for Alliance , a Toronto-based diversified entertainment company founded by Lantos in 1985 . The company , which went public a year ago , has three more series and 10 movies-of-the-week in development or production at American networks and cable channels , said Michael Weisbarth , senior_vice_president for television at the company ' s Beverly Hills office . ( Alliance also has offices in Montreal , Vancouver , Paris and Shannon , Ireland. ) The company just wrapped_up four television movies based on the mega-selling Harlequin romance novels published by Toronto-based Torstar Corp. , which CBS will counter-program to Fox ' s Sunday NFL broadcasts this fall . Alliance has an exclusive arrangement with Torstar and envisions a string of Harlequin films , eventually repackaged as videos that can be sold next to the books at retailers across North_America . Alliance Releasing , headed by longtime Lantos business associate Victor Loewy , is the leading Canadian-owned film distributor here . It recently cut a deal to distribute Miramax films in Canada , giving it Canadian rights to Robert Altman ' s upcoming &quot; Pret-a-porter &quot; and Quentin Tarantino ' s &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; among many others . In February , the company and Miramax will release the Alliance-produced &quot; Exotica , &quot; written and directed by Atom Egoyan . The film , typical of the low-budget , director-driven projects the company long has been associated with , made a splash at this year ' s Cannes Film Festival , winning the International Critics Prize . Another Alliance production , &quot; Whale Music , &quot; opened the Toronto International Film Festival on Sept . 8 . In partnership with American companies , Alliance is moving_into bigger budget movies , as well . &quot; Johnny Mnemonic , &quot; a futuristic adventure based on a novel by cyber-fiction author William Gibson , is in post-production , and at $ 23.4 million is the most expensive Canadian movie ever made . &quot; Johnny Mnemonic &quot; stars Keanu Reeves and is a co-production with TriStar . The company recently launched a new division to produce low-cost action movies mainly for the cable and video market and in January will go_on the air with its own cable channel on Canadian television , Showcase . &quot; It ' s very informal , very high energy , very demanding and very exciting , &quot; chief operating officer Gord Haines said of the company he joined two years ago . &quot; It ' s like being in the middle of an explosion. &quot; About the only thing that hasn ' t exploded is the stock price , which has only recently begun to rise after months of staying close to the $ 13 a share sold at offering . Alliance stock closed_down 12.5 Friday at $ 15.625 on the Toronto Stock_Exchange . Revenue was up 45 % for the year ended March 31 , with after-tax profits of $ 5.36 million on revenue of $ 79.56 million . Roger Dent of the brokerage_firm Wood Gundy Inc. , one of the few analysts who focus_on entertainment companies here , is very high on Alliance and attributes the slow rise in the stock price to cautious Canadian investors unfamiliar_with the industry . Alliance is very much the creation of the Hungarian-born Lantos , 45 , described by &quot; Due_South &quot; executive producer Paul Haggis as &quot; a real character , a larger-than-life producer. &quot; Lantos , the company ' s largest shareholder with a 21 % stake , began in the early 1970s as a distributor and independent producer . Working in a Canadian environment dominated by the major American studios , Lantos has prospered by pursuing projects eschewed by the studios , by perfecting the art of international financing -- mainly through pre-sales to foreign markets -- and by building a lattice work of mutually supportive divisions within Alliance . For example , Alliance ' s distribution rights to movies from Miramax and New Line Cinema and to popular European films give it the clout with exhibitors to assure screen time for its own productions . Other Canadian film_producers have a notoriously difficult time getting exhibitors to show their movies rather than American films . One company division , Alliance Equicap , specializes in arranging production financing to take_advantage of subsidies and tax_breaks offered by many countries for films and television meeting national content rules . A movie featuring a Canadian writer and producer and a French director and star might qualify for subsidies and tax_breaks in both countries , for example . This approach has been crucial to Alliance , and allows the company to take_on a personal film like &quot; Exotica , &quot; which Egoyan describes as a &quot; perversely romantic &quot; movie he made_for less than $ 1.5 million . With its success at Cannes , the film is pre-sold to a variety of markets and is profitable before its release . &quot; The relationship has been very important to me , &quot; said Egoyan , who has made two films with Alliance . &quot; They ' ve given me access to a higher budget than I was used to and a lot of freedom . And they ' re very adept at selling the films. &quot; In producing &quot; Exotica &quot; and similar &quot; art films , &quot; Alliance keeps a firm grip on the budget , generally less than $ 3 million , and only steps into the creative process more or less when asked . &quot; There ' s no point in backing someone with an eccentric vision and then trying to interfere with that vision , &quot; Lantos said in explaining his philosophy . &quot; I don ' t believe we have ever lost money on one of those director-driven low-budget films . . . . We only finance them in part and our investment is_on a favorable basis , but we ' ve never lost money. &quot; With &quot; Johnny Mnemonic &quot; and others , Alliance is stepping into a different arena , but Lantos argues that the company ' s approach is similar . &quot; None of these films is what you would call a mainstream Hollywood movie , including ' Johnny Mnemonic , ' &quot; he said . But &quot; at that level financially , production makes no sense unless there is a significant guaranteed revenue coming_out of the United States . So we work with the U.S. distributors as partners on the more ambitious films , but still we pick the projects that are out of the norm. &quot; Egoyan observed that &quot; what ' s ultimately interesting about Alliance is that it ' s able to embrace contradictions . They ' re able to pursue a number of different types of projects and give equal attention . I ' ve never felt I ' ve been less important to the company than their television work , and yet I know television is the financial fuel for the company. &quot; If Alliance made its way into the film world by backing eccentric little visionary films , it took quite a different road to success in television . The company entered American television with such late-night fodder as &quot; Night Heat , &quot; a CBS action-adventure series . ( To be fair , Alliance also has long produced critically acclaimed series for Canadian television. ) And Lantos said the hands-off attitude he takes with the director-driven films is the &quot; exact opposite &quot; of his approach to television . Alliance built its credibility with the networks with successful movies-of-the-week and miniseries . Beverly Hills-based Weisbarth points to the ratings-successful &quot; Family of Strangers , &quot; starring Patty Duke and Melissa Gilbert , as an example . The film , about an adopted woman searching for her birth mother , was based on a true story , but Alliance moved the action from Indiana to the Northwest and filmed in Vancouver . Canadians wrote and directed and Canadian William Shatner co-starred with Americans Gilbert and Duke . With &quot; Due_South , &quot; Alliance has penetrated what Lantos referred to as the innermost concentric circle of the television business , the prime-time series . Whether the show sticks can ' t be foretold . But both Lantos and Weisbarth say even a quick cancellation would not be fatal to Alliance ' s future with the U.S. networks . There are already too many other projects under way . &quot; If it does get canceled , it would be a disappointment , but not a setback . It ' s maybe two steps_forward and one-half step back , &quot; Weisbarth said .</TEXT>
