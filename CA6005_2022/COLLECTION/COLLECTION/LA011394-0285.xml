   <HEADLINE> JAUNTS ; MIGRATION OF WHALES PRESENTS A SIGHT THAT ISN ' T EASY TO FORGET ; THIS IS THE SEASON WHEN THEY PASS THE CHANNEL ISLANDS ON THE WAY TO BAJA CALIFORNIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s whale watching season again , but what really are the chances of witnessing that magnificent migration from the Bering Sea to Baja California as it passes_by the Channel Islands ? You ' ve got a whale of a chance , say officials with Island Packers , which offers whale-watching cruises out of Ventura Harbor . &quot; We ' re seeing whales every day , &quot; said Heather Wagner , an Island Packers staffer . On a Jan . 3 trip , passengers saw 18 , she said , and one was breeching -- a spectacular sight as it heaves most of its massive bulk out of the water and plunges back with a huge splash . A recent Saturday trip wasn ' t that productive , but still was impressive . For about 20 minutes , passengers watched five whales cruising the waters just this side of Anacapa Island . The 3 1 / 2-hour trip was aboard the Vanguard , a 65-foot boat that can hold_up to 65 people . The boat has a galley where passengers can buy doughnuts and beverages . As the Vanguard left the dock , crew_member Holly Snyder said the waters were calm , but warned that some people get sick no matter how calm the seas . For the smoothest ride , sit at the rear , she advised ; better viewing spots are at the front and up_on the top deck . It took nearly an hour for the boat to get_into the deeper waters between the coast and the islands , where the whales are most often spotted . The captain , Glen Galbraith , first veered toward a group of dolphins a half-mile away . Slowly , he guided the boat among a half_dozen or so Risso ' s dolphins , gliding through the waters just a_few yards from the boat . &quot; They ' re not bothered by us at all , &quot; Snyder said . &quot; They ' re putting_on a beautiful show. &quot; The dolphins dove and surfaced , noisily spouting water . Sometimes they nuzzled each other underwater . The show continued for a half-hour when Galbraith got a radio call from another boat about some whales closer to Anacapa . He took_off , passing Platform Gail , an oil drilling operation , along the way . Near the platform on a buoy , seven sea_lions huddled , basking in the sun . Long before the boat reached the whales , their white spouts were visible on the horizon . &quot; we ' ll try to get_behind them slowly -- we don ' t want to make them nervous , &quot; Galbraith said as the boat approached . These were Pacific Gray_Whales , the kind most likely to be seen by whale watchers locally . Off Ventura County ' s coast , the whales are first spotted in December heading south . They travel about 5 m.p.h. , roughly 115 miles per day , with pregnant whales leading the migration . By the end of March , when the season ends , they pass this way again , their children in tow , on their way north . On this day there were five whales traveling together , their twin blowholes spouting a mist as they surfaced for air every three to four minutes . They flipped their tail flukes out of the water before diving back under . The wet exhalation could be heard on the boat . These were average size for gray_whales which can reach lengths of 40 to 50 feet . As they traveled below the surface , they left a &quot; footprint &quot; on the water , a rippling effect caused by the vertical thrusts of the tail . Enthralled by the sight was Shirley Christy of Los Angeles , who has been whale watching the last 15 years , casting_off with Island Packers 30 to 40 times a season . She fondly recalled seeing five mating pairs on one trip . &quot; We killed the motors , &quot; she said . &quot; It was very exotic. &quot; Details * WHAT : Whale watching cruises to observe the migrating gray_whales . * WHEN : Island Packers offers 3 1 / 2-hour excursions Saturday and Sunday ( some during the week ) through the end of March .
