   <HEADLINE> E-MAIL : A LANGUAGE FROM CYBERSPACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> B eep . The E-mail message arrives in the computer : hi--luvd your last messg / made me LOL . Lets get togther over lnch . soon . The New Age of Communication could render good spelling obsolete . Electronic mail -- computer-generated messages that zip through phone_lines to computer &quot; mailboxes &quot; all_over the world -- tends to emphasize content , not form . &quot; E-mail is a more informal use altogether . The message is important , the presentation is not , &quot; says Dennis Baron , a professor of English and linguistics at the University of Illinois , Urbana . &quot; Conventions of correctness are usually suspended . What we ' re seeing is the democratization of communication. &quot; E-mail message writers don ' t use letterheads . They don ' t formally sign their names . They don ' t necessarily capitalize letters . They use shorthand ( &quot; LOL &quot; means &quot; laugh out loud &quot; ) and they don ' t necessarily spell properly . &quot; The ethos of E-mail is that you say what you have to say in the moment . The point is speed and naturalness , not correctness , &quot; says John Seabrook , a New Yorker magazine writer whose recent profile of Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates included selections from E-mail between the two men . &quot; There was a big discussion in the copy department here about whether to keep Gates ' misspellings in the piece , &quot; Seabrook says . &quot; We felt we ought to keep them -- which is a pretty big deal at the New Yorker -- because it was more in the spirit of what E-mail is about . &quot; Maybe the point is that you ' re not committing anything to paper , &quot; he says . &quot; Somehow , what you write doesn ' t have the same kind of real existence , so things like spelling don ' t really matter. &quot; MARY ANN HOGAN</TEXT>
