   <HEADLINE> OPPOSITION TO TRY OUSTING JAPAN COALITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ending a political truce that was called to allow the passage of Japan ' s 1994 budget , the opposition Liberal Democratic Party committed itself Wednesday to submitting a no-confidence motion against Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata . The party ' s five top_executives and its General Affairs Committee approved a proposal by Yohei Kono , president of the party that ruled Japan from 1955 until last summer , to seek the ouster of Hata ' s minority coalition . Kono asserted that the coalition lacks a mandate and acted &quot; irresponsibly &quot; in trying to retain power while holding only 37 % of the seats in the lower house . Kono was entrusted with deciding when to submit the no-confidence motion after the long-delayed 1994 budget is given final approval by the upper house , an action likely to occur today . Passage of a no-confidence motion is not assured , and the possibility remains that Kono will back_down if he fails to win support from the Socialists , who walked_out_of the coalition April 26 immediately after electing Hata prime_minister . The Socialists , who now hold the crucial votes_in any showdown between the government and the Liberal Democrats , launched talks Wednesday with leaders of Hata ' s coalition . The parties sought to work_out agreement on key policies as the price for the Socialists ' return to the fold . &quot; I don ' t think the hurdles are too high . Agreement is possible , &quot; Yuichi Ichikawa , secretary_general of the coalition ' s Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party , said after the meeting . Ichiro Ozawa , the coalition ' s chief strategist , agreed . Wataru Kubo , the Socialists ' secretary_general , also paid a call_on Liberal Democratic leaders to explain his party ' s policy demands . Even if the Socialists reach a policy agreement with Hata ' s forces , the party has demanded that Hata resign before it returns to the government . Such a move would force the lower house of Parliament to vote again to choose a prime_minister . In negotiations conducted before the Clinton_Administration announced a breakthrough Wednesday in the North_Korean nuclear inspections standoff , the Socialists had insisted that any new coalition reject possible sanctions against North_Korea and limit itself to &quot; dialogue and persuasion &quot; to solve the issue of Pyongyang ' s suspected development of nuclear_weapons . If Hata refused , Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama declared , his party would join in supporting a no-confidence motion , then form a &quot; caretaker government &quot; with the Liberal Democrats . On paper , the combination would give the two parties 276 votes , 20 more_than a majority . But both parties , archrivals throughout the Liberal Democrats ' 38-year rule , face the possibility of intraparty rebellions . Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe , who toyed_with the idea of bolting the Liberal Democrats to join the coalition in April , said he and his faction will abide_by the party ' s decision to submit a no-confidence motion . But he promised to seek Kono ' s ouster as party chief if the motion fails to pass . Passage of a no-confidence motion would threaten to force a dissolution of the lower house and a general_election in the midst of U.S.-Japanese negotiations to set_up a new &quot; framework &quot; to reduce Japan ' s global current_account surplus of $ 131 billion and establish rules for trade between the two nations . It also would weaken Japan ' s standing at the annual economic summit of the world ' s seven major industrial democracies in Naples , Italy , from July 8 to 10 .</TEXT>
