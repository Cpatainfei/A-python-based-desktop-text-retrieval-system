   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CHECHNYA INVASION PUTS YELTSIN IN HARM ' S WAY ; POLITICS : RUSSIA ' S PRESIDENT RISKS PRESIDING OVER A LONG CONFLICT AND LOSING ALLIES IN PARLIAMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin has never been known to shy_away_from conflict , but in sending troops Sunday to subdue the fiery Muslims of the breakaway republic of Chechnya , he may have picked the nastiest fight of his life . Consider his opponents . Chechen men tend to feel undressed without their side_arms . They wage protracted blood_feuds among their powerful clans . The very name of their capital city , Grozny , means terrible or thunderous in Russian . The best-known Russian line about the Chechens , written by 19th-Century poet Mikhail Lermontov , is , &quot; The cruel Chechen is crawling up the riverbank and sharpening his knife. &quot; When Chechen Foreign Minister Shamsedin Yusef said Sunday that &quot; they cannot kill every Chechen ; there are more_than 1 million of us , and every one of us will fight , &quot; it did not sound like empty rhetoric . Of course , Caucasian daggers are no match for the might of a former superpower . But even if the Russian troops backed by pro-Moscow Chechens end_up marching triumphantly into Grozny , many expect defiant Chechens to wage guerrilla warfare against Moscow for years . And that is only one of the risks Yeltsin has incurred by sending troops toward Grozny . When Russians comment on the tensions between Moscow and Grozny since Chechnya declared its independence in 1991 , they tend to see them in the context of an infamous bit of imperial history known as the Caucasus War . For decades during the mid-1800s , the mighty czars couldn ' t manage to subdue the feisty tribes of the mountainous region united under a legendary leader named Shamil . Liberal politician Grigory A . Yavlinsky warned Sunday : &quot; The Chechnya events are the prologue to another Caucasus War . . . . They promise decades of bloodshed . we ' ll have to send our children in and bring_out coffins . Russian citizens will have to shoot other Russian citizens. &quot; Then there is the religion factor . As Muslims , the Chechens have been inundated for months by moujahedeen from Afghanistan and other Islamic countries , to_the_point that Chechen President Dzhokar M . Dudayev has claimed that he no longer controls many of his fighters . The most zealous among them don green bandannas and are known as the smertniki , the suicide squads . If Chechnya ' s plight becomes bad enough , foreign_policy expert Georgy Arbatov cautioned , Azerbaijan , Iran or Turkey could conceivably be persuaded to get involved . Other analysts discount that danger . Caucasus expert Sergei Arutiunov said he does not believe that even the other small nations of the Caucasus would be willing to come_to Chechnya ' s aid after having seen the wreckage caused by ethnic conflicts in the Russian republic of Ingushetia and in the Georgian region Abkhazia . &quot; The militant mood of the other Caucasus nations &quot; has died_down , Arutiunov said . &quot; All the awful consequences of the civil_wars have demonstrated that in such wars there can be no winners. &quot; But the worst-case scenarios lie behind alarmist warnings by the_likes_of former Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov , who declared last week that if Russia and Chechnya go_to_war , &quot; all countries and republics will get dragged into this war ; everything will be mixed and intermingled . And this war will go_on and on . It will not end until the last Russian or Chechen dies. &quot; By alienating even some of his closest supporters with his militant move , Yeltsin also risks losing some of his last friends in a Parliament that is already dominated by largely hostile Communists and nationalists . Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin barely survived a recent no-confidence vote and can little afford to lose support from normally pro-Yeltsin liberals . In the foreign_policy arena , Yeltsin is also courting trouble . Although the United States and other countries have made_it clear that they consider the Chechen problem purely an internal Russian affair , they were probably not counting_on a move that could turn_out to be so costly in human lives . One State_Department official said Sunday that the crisis in Chechnya &quot; might &quot; increase calls from the U.S. Congress for a tougher line against Russia , &quot; but I would tend to doubt it as people analyze the situation. &quot; That prediction of calm wasn ' t borne_out in initial reactions Sunday . Two senators influential in foreign affairs , Joseph I . Lieberman ( D-Conn. ) and John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) , both criticized the incursion and suggested that the United States reassess its policy toward Russia . &quot; I think we ' re seeing the resurgence of Russian imperialism , &quot; McCain said on the CNN program &quot; Late Edition. &quot; Lieberman said the troop movements &quot; will and in fact . . . should &quot; cause Congress to reassess its support for large-scale aid to Russia . In addition , the decision to move troops into Chechnya heightened the danger of anti-Russian terrorist attacks in Moscow and elsewhere . Moscow police have been_on special alert in the wake of Chechen threats to make their defiance known in the Russian_capital , although no attacks were reported Sunday . If angry Chechens resort_to terrorism , military analyst Pavel Felgengauer said , &quot; Russia may have to run anti-terrorist operations for years in Chechnya , as England had to do_in Ireland. &quot; A more subtle political danger also lurks . Predictions from liberal politicians abound that terrorism combined with bloody fighting in Chechnya may serve as an excuse for hard-liners in the government to persuade Yeltsin to declare emergency rule throughout Russia . Dictatorship could then follow . With so many dangers inherent in the decision , commentators such_as Yevgeny Kiselev of Russia ' s Independent Television network struggled to understand what moved Yeltsin to make_it . Kiselev noted indignantly that none of the government leaders who actually participated in the intervention plan -- Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev , Federal Counterintelligence Service chief Sergei V . Stepashin and others -- have bothered to explain to the public what is going_on and why . Instead , what Russians got was a much-amended appeal from Yeltsin , released only after 9 p.m. Sunday , assuring them that the troop influx into Chechnya is meant to ensure a &quot; political solution &quot; to the crisis -- an apparent reference_to peace talks planned for today . Yeltsin ' s appeal said the troops are there to defend the civilian population from armed Chechen extremists . He also is clearly well within his rights to intervene in a region that everyone except its residents considers part of Russia . And although polls put those who favor the use of force in Chechnya in the minority , many Russians openly long for the imposition of order . But Yavlinsky offered perhaps the most biting explanation for Yeltsin ' s tactic . Yeltsin , he told Kiselev in an interview , tends to resort_to force because he is no good at the tedious process of negotiations . &quot; He ' s like a person who can ' t play chess , so he kicks over the board , &quot; Yavlinsky said . Times staff writer Ronald Brownstein in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
