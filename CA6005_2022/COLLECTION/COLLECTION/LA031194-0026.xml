   <HEADLINE> CLEAVER SAYS HE WAS ROBBED DAY BEFORE INJURIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former Black Panther Party leader Eldridge Cleaver says he was robbed the day before he was found wandering the streets with a major head injury . Police said Cleaver , 58 , told Inspector Al Bierce about the robbery during a brief interview Wednesday at Alta Bates Medical_Center , where he was recovering from a brain hemorrhage . Because of his condition , Cleaver was unable to provide details about the robbery or describe his attacker , Lt . Michel de Latour said . &quot; Answering questions was not easy for him , &quot; de Latour said . &quot; He did establish that he was robbed. &quot; Cleaver was rushed to the hospital March 1 after he collapsed in a jail_cell . He underwent emergency surgery later that day for a buildup of fluid between the outer layer of the brain and the skull . His surgeon says the injury was caused by a blow on the head that occurred 12 to 24 hours before police took Cleaver into custody . Cleaver was cited for public intoxication and possession of crack cocaine and a crack pipe , but authorities might drop the charges in light of his injuries .</TEXT>
