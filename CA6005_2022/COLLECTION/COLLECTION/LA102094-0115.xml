   <HEADLINE> ' EVERY TIME , IT HURTS AGAIN ' ; ISRAEL : NATION REELING AS VICTORIES IN PEACE PROCESS ALTERNATE WITH DEADLY ATTACKS FROM OPPONENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Confronted with the wreckage of Wednesday ' s horrific bombing attack on a Tel Aviv bus , an anguished teen-age girl there screamed at no one in particular , &quot; How much can we take ? &quot; Israelis of every political stripe and from all walks_of_life were asking much the same question Wednesday , wondering how many_more emotional shocks they can absorb on the increasingly savage road to peace . In the past 10 days , the nation has been whipsawed between emotional highs and lows so drastic as_to produce a national feeling of vertigo . &quot; It ' s an emotional roller_coaster , &quot; acknowledged Education Minister Amnon Rubenstein . He put the bus attack in a unique category of outrage , something so devastating , he said , that it &quot; endangers the government ' s ability to carry_on &quot; with its process of transferring limited control of the West_Bank to the Palestinian Authority . He spoke after the militant Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the bombing . &quot; This is not an easy battle , &quot; Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in a late-night news_conference Wednesday . &quot; . . . We have to stand_in battle , facing a terrible enemy : Hamas , Islamic Jihad and parts of the Islamic movement which is spread all_over the Arab and the Muslim world. &quot; And President Ezer Weizman , who traveled_to the scene shortly after the attack , called_on his countrymen to stay calm . &quot; I appeal_to the citizens of Israel to take a deep breath , ( to have ) a lot of patience and forbearance , &quot; Weizman said . &quot; These are enemies of peace who try to torpedo things. &quot; But for many Israelis , forbearance was difficult to contemplate . &quot; This is a moment when people ' s emotions get control of them , &quot; said Yoav Peck , an activist with the left-leaning Peace Now movement . Peck , who immigrated here 21 years ago from New York , said he was braced for a right-wing backlash not only against Palestinians , but also against Israelis who support dealing with the PLO and withdrawing from occupied territory . &quot; My car has Peace Now . . . stickers all_over it , &quot; said Peck , a Jerusalem resident . &quot; When I parked in front of my house today , I wondered whether my headlights will be smashed , as they have in the past when such incidents occur. &quot; Magnifying the impact of Wednesday ' s attack for Israelis was the fact that two vicious attacks directly preceded it , plus the knowledge that the organization that carried_out all three has pledged to stop at nothing in its efforts to sink the peace process . Hamas has proved itself both willing and capable of carrying_out bold , even suicidal , attacks in the past and unflinching in its readiness to hit civilian targets . On Oct . 9 , a pair of Islamic militants carried_out a rare attack in downtown Jerusalem , killing two people and wounding 13 when they opened_fire on a street crowded with cafes . The attackers , themselves shot dead , were later identified as members of the Gaza-based Hamas movement . That same night , another group of Hamas militants kidnaped a 19-year-old soldier , Nachshon Waxman , as he hitchhiked home to Jerusalem from his army_base . The nation agonized with Waxman ' s parents during the week , as they prayed and pleaded publicly for their son ' s safe release . Friday , the Waxman kidnaping ended in tragedy . Waxman was shot dead by his captors as an Israeli army_unit stormed their West_Bank hide-out . An Israeli officer leading the raid , Nir Poraz , also was shot dead , and nine other soldiers were wounded . The failed rescue attempt was made just hours after Rabin , Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat were awarded this year ' s Nobel Peace Prize . Some Israelis now say that Rabin and Peres should refuse to accept it . After the Waxman debacle , Rabin and Peres seemed determined to demonstrate to the nation that terrorism would not derail their peacemaking efforts . The two flew to Jordan on Sunday night and , after all-night negotiations , initialed a peace_treaty with King Hussein on Monday afternoon . Israelis heard the welcome news that an Israeli Embassy may open in Amman just six weeks from now . The good news from Amman was augmented Tuesday when Avraham Hamra , the rabbi of the Syrian Jewish community , arrived in Israel with his extended family . Just days before , the government had revealed that Syria had allowed virtually its entire Jewish community to emigrate in the past three years , and had tolerated the immigration to Israel of more_than 1 # 000 . The release of Syrian Jews was interpreted here as a sign that Syria may yet sign a peace_treaty with Israel . So plans were_well under way for a gala celebration of the treaty signing , scheduled for Oct . 26 , when Wednesday ' s bombing occurred , killing 22 people . The White_House said Wednesday that President Clinton still plans to attend the signing , to which Israel and Jordan had planned to invite 5 # 000 guests . But the impulse here to celebrate vanished in the flames that leaped from the shattered bus on Dizengoff Street on Wednesday morning . &quot; It certainly has been an emotional yo-yo , &quot; said Gerald Steinberg , a military analyst at Bar Ilan University ' s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies . Israelis had no time to recover from the depression the nation felt when Waxman was killed , Steinberg said , before the horror of the bus bombing was plastered across their television_sets . &quot; If Rabin is smart , he will make next week ' s signing ceremony a low-key event , &quot; Steinberg said . &quot; It is a time for black hats and black coats , not celebrations. &quot; Specialists hasten to underscore that these ups and downs are nothing new_to a_people who rose from the ashes of the Holocaust to build a modern , thriving nation despite living_in a state_of_war with most of their neighbors for 46 years . &quot; It has been the reality since the founding of the state -- this oscillation between stress and lulls , &quot; said Prof . Zahava Solomon , head of the Bob Shapell School of Social_Work at Tel Aviv University . &quot; During the ( 1991 ) Gulf War , the periods of stress and lull were even closer together than they are right now. &quot; Israelis cope_with it , Solomon said , &quot; because , unfortunately , there is a process of habituation in people who live_in the shadow of war. &quot; Damage done to the immediate victims of a terrorist attack , and to those who witness the act or who know people involved , may be great and lasting , Solomon said . But the rest of the nation is able to pick_up the pieces and go_on . &quot; Even today , you saw this , &quot; Solomon said . &quot; It took a_couple_of minutes , and then people in the surrounding buildings came_out to help the survivors . It was not a situation of panic. &quot; Both professional researchers like herself and average Israelis are aware , Solomon said , &quot; that in time of terrorist attack , in times of war , Israeli society gets very cohesive . I hate to say it , but some good things come_out of these bad things. &quot; &quot; Every time , it hurts again , &quot; said Shmulik Sadan , a 28-year-old personnel director at a survey institute who was wounded in Wednesday ' s bombing . &quot; But if we don ' t make_peace , it ' ll just get_worse and worse. &quot; Researcher Emily Hauser of The Times ' Jerusalem Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
