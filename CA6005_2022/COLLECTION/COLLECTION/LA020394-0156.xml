   <HEADLINE> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY ; THE SUSPICION IS MUTUAL ; LATINOS IN POMONA SAY THEY ' RE DOCUMENTING THE BORDER_PATROL ' S ENFORCEMENT TACTICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Carlos Pleitez , a baby-faced 18-year-old from El_Salvador , stood on a Pomona street_corner one day last year with a_few dozen other men hoping for work , his green_card tucked safely in his wallet . But on this day , the coveted document did him little good . &quot; I had papers with me , but ( a federal_agent ) threw me in the van and took me all_the way to Riverside , &quot; the three-year Pomona resident said of a Border_Patrol visit to the day labor site about seven months ago . &quot; I said I had papers , but they told me , ' Shut up , wetback ! ' &quot; When agents learned his documents were valid , Pleitez was released . But he had lost a day ' s work and had to make his way back from Riverside on_his_own , he said . Legal immigrants throughout the San Gabriel Valley say they increasingly are feeling the sting of anti-immigrant backlash alongside their illegal neighbors . But nowhere are the sentiments stronger than in Pomona , a Latino-majority city and the only one in the valley cruised by the telltale lime-green vehicles of the U.S. Border_Patrol . There , Latinos complain that their businesses have been affected when the Border_Patrol hangs_around ; immigrants , legal or not , don ' t want to go near those businesses and risk being questioned , the merchants said . Also , an incident in which Border_Patrol agents questioned Mayor Eddie Cortez last summer quickly became local legend , even though agents insist they stopped Cortez because he was following them around . The activities of the Border_Patrol have created such concern that community activists and residents have formed a watchdog organization to educate Pomona Latinos about their rights . Members , a_few of them here illegally , also walk the streets to witness and document Border_Patrol sweeps . &quot; Even if you have papers , you feel uneasy , &quot; said Juan , 39 , who has lived_in the United States legally for 22 years and has run a small sewing business in Pomona for the past three years . Juan , who is not involved with the watchdog group , declined to give his full name , fearing the patrol would raid his business . &quot; You have to go_to work and you have a certain amount_of_time to get there . They might stop you just because of the way you look , &quot; he said . Pomona is the westernmost part of territory patrolled by agents based in Riverside , whose main task is to search for illegal immigrants . While the Los Angeles district of the Immigration and Naturalization Service -- the Border_Patrol ' s parent agency -- covers a much wider terrain , the INS sets a higher priority on arresting illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes . The harassment goes beyond Pomona , say immigration activists , who are receiving increasing numbers of complaints from legal immigrants throughout the area . &quot; We ' re hearing a lot of stories , &quot; said Nancy Cervantes of the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights of Los Angeles . &quot; Employers are threatening people , ' If you ' re illegal , then you ' re going to be in a lot of trouble , ' and I ' m talking_about legal people who have been here for years. &quot; A Latina student at Mt . San Antonio College in Walnut recently complained that she and her French boyfriend were stopped by immigration officials who checked her residency documents . Her boyfriend , in the country illegally , wasn ' t questioned . The fear of discrimination is running high among day_laborers , many of whom are documented workers who gather on the streets to find jobs . * In Monrovia , where more_than a_hundred day_laborers sometimes gather at the Home Depot on Huntington Boulevard , some who are documented said they have increasingly been mistaken for illegal immigrants . As a result , contractors offer lower wages or sometimes refuse to pay them at the end of the day , assuming they will be afraid to complain to authorities . And on a recent day in Pomona , one contractor angrily walked away from eager laborers , yelling that he would n ' t hire them for fear of being busted by Border_Patrol agents who were_on the scene at the time . But the agents already had checked the workers ' immigration documents and found them valid . Finding day jobs on street_corners might soon get harder in unincorporated county areas . County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke is proposing an ordinance that would prohibit day_laborers from seeking work in unincorporated county areas , which in the San Gabriel Valley includes Altadena and Hacienda Heights . The proposed ordinance states that day_laborers create safety hazards by interfering with traffic and clogging sidewalks . But immigration activists and day_laborers condemn the measure as an attempt to scapegoat immigrants -- legal and illegal -- for the region ' s economic woes . * &quot; We can ' t keep_up with all_the complaints and calls we get from people saying , ' Do something about it ! I ' ve lost my job . I used to make a good living and now they ' ve replaced me with someone who makes minimum_wage , ' &quot; said Agent In Charge Raymond Fuhrmann , who estimated that the Riverside station gets four or five calls a day from irate residents eager to report people they believe to be illegal . Since callers generally cannot verify whether an individual is here legally , Fuhrmann suggests they contact police regarding a person ' s illegal conduct rather than his immigration status . But his agents do respond to callers who complain about immigrants congregating on street_corners , regardless of their legal_status . Fuhrmann said his officers usually can spot a phony immigration document , but he conceded they have_on occasion pulled legal immigrants into the Riverside office before verifying their documents were valid . While Pomona ' s Latinos say agents stepped_up patrols in their city over the past year , particularly in the summer and early fall , Fuhrmann said arrests have not increased . With just 12 agents to cover 8 # 000 square_miles , more arrests would not be possible , he said . Between October , 1992 , and last September , agents from the Riverside station arrested 6 # 421 people -- 937 fewer than the previous year . That difference is likely due_to tight budgets that cut two agents off the payroll in fiscal 1993 , Fuhrmann said . Current statistics for October through the first_half of January were comparable_to the previous year . But Latino business owners and day_laborers said visits by agents have increased , even if arrests haven ' t . Fernando Garcia , 22 , a legal immigrant from Michoacan , Mexico , said the agents come_by the Contractor Warehouse on West Mission Boulevard several times a week . &quot; They treat us very badly , &quot; said Garcia , a resident of Pomona for seven years . &quot; When they arrive , they don ' t ask us whether we have papers or not . They just say , ' Hey , wetback ! ' and sometimes they grab us by the hair. &quot; Fuhrmann said he has never seen his officers behave that way . Many are compassionate toward the people they arrest , he said , purchasing food and drinks or diapers for the children before they board the 4 p.m. daily bus for the border . On a recent day in the city , agents were not hard-pressed to find arrestees . As a team of lime-green vehicles and vans cruised Pomona ' s streets and alleys , one man abandoned his car and fled into a house as a woman yelled ' La migra ! La migra ! ' from her front_yard . Many of the day_laborers at the site on West Mission Boulevard flashed their documents , but more_than half_a_dozen were marched into waiting vans . Within an hour , 21 men were apprehended , most of them within Pomona ' s city_limits . In any group approached by agents , Fuhrmann said , there are bound to be legal residents , particularly in Pomona -- with a Latino-majority City_Council and a school district whose Latino student population tops 60 % &quot; It varies . Of 10 people , sometimes half take_off running . Sometimes it ' s only one or two , &quot; he said , adding that sometimes legal residents run , too , as &quot; a joke. &quot; &quot; When you approach a group like that , there ' s no way of knowing which is going_to be illegal , especially if they ' re recent arrivals , other_than by talking to them , &quot; Fuhrmann said . &quot; But it doesn ' t take long . Within a_few minutes , our agents usually know. &quot; In September , seasoned community activists banded_together with newly politicized immigrants to form the watchdog Alliance for Immigrant Rights . Members walk Pomona ' s streets on the lookout for the Border_Patrol and hand_out cards emblazoned : &quot; Immigrant : Know Your Rights. &quot; The group formed shortly after the run-in between Mayor Cortez and Border_Patrol agents . Cortez was following agents on a sweep_through town when he said he was pulled over and asked_for identification . Cortez , who was driving an old pickup_truck , said an agent told him he &quot; fit the profile &quot; of an illegal immigrant . Border_Patrol officials said agents questioned Cortez because they considered his behavior unusual . The incident spurred rumors in the city and even made the papers in Mexico_City . It also fueled Pomona ' s nascent immigrant rights movement . A September workshop on Border_Patrol issues drew more_than 80 people . &quot; When they start asking us for ID and papers , we think they ' re going to take us away . Sometimes we run , out of fear , &quot; said Roberto , a legal immigrant who attended the workshop to learn about his rights . Roberto , who has lived_in Pomona since 1984 and supports nine children in Mexico , ducked into a hair salon when Border_Patrol agents appeared at the day labor site recently , rather than face questioning he finds unpleasant and frightening . Albert Castro , 60 , who was born in Pomona and has owned Realty World on West Mission Boulevard since 1967 , said he is more concerned about the real_estate market than the Border_Patrol . But he knows many others feel differently . &quot; Several people have said to me , ' I ' m not going_to go_out in the streets until noon or 1 p.m. , ' &quot; Castro said . The immigration patrols usually come_through town in the early morning . On a recent afternoon , Norma Y Nico was shopping for pinatas at the Rancho Pomona Market when the sight of Border_Patrol agents across the street paralyzed her . &quot; I screamed to my nephew , ' Oh my God ! La migra ! &quot; ' said Nico , who owns Pomona ' s La Lupita meat market . Nico and her nephew , both Mexican-born , are here legally . But the specter of immigrants fleeing from agents has planted an irrational fear in Nico . &quot; The Border_Patrol shows_up and people start running , &quot; Nico said . &quot; They look_like animals . It makes me feel very bad , because they are my people. &quot;</TEXT>
