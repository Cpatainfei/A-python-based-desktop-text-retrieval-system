   <HEADLINE> AFTER FAILURE TO OUST CHECHEN LEADER , RUSSIA SEEKS RELEASE OF PRISONERS ; NEGOTIATIONS : PRESIDENT OF BREAKAWAY REPUBLIC AGREES TO FREE SOLDIERS , MOSCOW ' S DEFENSE MINISTER SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Foiled in its attempts to oust the rebel leader of the breakaway republic of Chechnya , Russia dispatched two key ministers Tuesday to negotiate the release of its prisoners_of_war . Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev announced on Russian television late Tuesday that President Dzhokar Dudayev of Chechnya had agreed to release Russian POWs captured 11 days ago during an attempt to storm Dudayev ' s presidential palace in Grozny , the Chechen capital . In a bid to avert an all-out war with the oil-rich Muslim region , Grachev and Interior Minister Viktor F . Yerin had flown to the southern Russian republic of Ingushetia to meet with Dudayev in the remote village of Ordzhonikidzevskaya . Grachev and Dudayev both declared themselves &quot; satisfied &quot; with the meeting . Terms of the POW release , if any , were not disclosed . &quot; Neither Chechnya nor anybody else in the North Caucasus is going_to_war with Moscow , &quot; Dudayev declared , defusing fears of an imminent Russian attack on the defiant Caucasian republic . Grachev said the Russian Security_Council will meet Thursday to decide how to resolve the Chechen conflict . Although Chechnya declared independence in 1991 , Russia has never recognized it as a sovereign nation . Russian officials have accused Dudayev of sponsoring terrorism and providing haven to mobsters , hijackers and bandits . Still , Moscow was obliged to try to negotiate a settlement after a covert campaign to oust Dudayev turned_into a fiasco last week . Russian bombing attacks in which civilians , some of them children , perished appear only to have intensified the Chechens ' historic hostility toward Russia and boosted Dudayev ' s failing popularity , according to reports from Grozny . Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin flip-flopped by first ordering Chechens to lay_down their arms and then , when his deadline passed and nothing happened , allowing aides to claim the order had been &quot; misunderstood. &quot; About 70 people , including at least 16 Russian service personnel , remain prisoners in Grozny , where they have given damaging interviews contradicting Moscow ' s official version of events . Dudayev has released four other prisoners as a &quot; gesture of goodwill &quot; to two different visiting delegations of Russian lawmakers , who in return have asked Yeltsin to halt the bombing . On Tuesday , a third delegation headed by liberal economist and lawmaker Grigory A . Yavlinsky flew to Chechnya and its members offered themselves as hostages in exchange for the Russian POWs . Chechen Foreign Minister Shamsedin Yusef politely rejected the swap . As the conflict drags_on , the Russian Parliament , press and public are voicing strident opposition to armed intervention in Chechnya . &quot; Chechnya is an inseparable part of Russia , but we are against establishing law and order there with fire and sword , &quot; said Yegor T . Gaidar , head of Russia ' s Democratic Choice political_party and a Yeltsin loyalist . The Communist newspaper Pravda and the Russian Orthodox Church concurred with the liberal Gaidar , a situation as rare as fresh strawberries in a Moscow winter . A Russian Islamic leader , Mufti Hazrat Ravil Gainutdin , warned that military escalation of the Chechnya conflict would &quot; inevitably &quot; draw_in other Russian minority groups -- including Muslims . Valeriya I . Novodvorskaya , a former Soviet dissident , compared the mood in the Kremlin to that of August , 1968 , the eve of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia . &quot; The same threats to introduce troops if the Chechens do not give_up their freedom and independence , the same tension , the same massing of troops on the border , &quot; she said . &quot; We shouldn ' t allow Russian democracy to slide into bloody fascism. &quot; Izvestia newspaper reported in today ' s editions that Dudayev commands 11 # 000 to 12 # 000 soldiers armed with tanks , armored personnel_carriers , artillery and antiaircraft and antitank guns . Russia has massed &quot; a tremendous number of troops &quot; in the border region of Mozdok , the newspaper reported . The covert_operation to oust Dudayev was kept so secret that even a senior Russian army commander was unaware that his officers were being recruited by the counterintelligence service to fight in Chechnya . Maj . Gen . Boris Polyakov resigned last weekend in protest when he learned that his elite officers were serving in Chechnya without his knowledge , a unit spokesman confirmed . On Tuesday , Russian journalists blasted their government for shameless mendacity about the near-civil war in Chechnya . After insisting for months that Russia was not backing anti-Dudayev rebels , then maintaining that fighters captured in Grozny were not Russian and that Russia had nothing to do with warplanes bombing Chechnya last week , Grachev on Monday admitted Russian involvement . Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper responded by running a photograph of Grachev under the banner headline : &quot; Unidentified Lying Object. &quot;</TEXT>
