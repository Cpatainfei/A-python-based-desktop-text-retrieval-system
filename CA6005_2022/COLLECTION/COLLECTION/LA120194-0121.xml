   <HEADLINE> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY ; A VOLATILE SITUATION ; PROLIFERATION OF CRUDE METHAMPHETAMINE LABS IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY IS STRAINING LOCAL POLICE AGENCIES AND DRUG ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATORS -- AND PLACING CITIZENS AT RISK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the neat tract homes and aging motel_rooms of the San Gabriel Valley , scores of amateur chemists are whipping_up batches of methamphet amine at a rate that has drug investi gators overwhelmed and puzzled . This year in the valley , anti-narcotics forces are seizing methamphetamine labs at nearly triple the rate of last year . Nearly three-fourths of the labs seized in four counties covered by a regional anti-drug task_force have been in the valley , which accounts_for less than 10 % of the region ' s total population . &quot; There are more labs seized in the East San Gabriel Valley than any other region of the United States right now , &quot; said Walter Allen , a special_agent supervisor with the California Department_of_Justice ' s Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement . The drug of biker gangs in the 1960s and ' 70s , methamphetamine has become the most popular high in the San Gabriel Valley . Law_enforcement officials say the majority of arrests made_for possession or for being under the influence of a controlled substance are for methamphetamine , which has surpassed cocaine in popularity . Authorities say the reasons for this surge are clear : meth , a central_nervous_system stimulant , is similar in price and effect to cocaine but the high can last 10 to 12 times longer -- for 24 hours or more . Perhaps more important , meth can be &quot; cooked &quot; with chemicals largely found at the corner drugstore . &quot; Criminals learn how to make meth in jail , they pass the recipes on , &quot; said Covina police Det . Vic Lupu . &quot; They don ' t have to rely_on Colombians to get drugs. &quot; In these clandestine laboratories , or &quot; clan labs &quot; as authorities call them , manufacturers mix the same volatile chemicals found in car_batteries , insecticides and paint , until they produce the white crystalline powder that sells for $ 80 to $ 100 a gram . * &quot; Virtually every city in the valley has a lot of problems with clan labs , &quot; Baldwin Park Police_Chief Carmine Lanza said . Narcotics investigators can only theorize why the home of the Rose Bowl and Raging Waters is also the national hot spot for meth . Perhaps it ' s the number of cheap motels that line the valley ' s freeways that give cookers easy ins and quick outs , since many of the arrests are in those motels . Perhaps it ' s because the valley is the geographic link between Los Angeles and the Inland Empire , which already has a flourishing meth trade . Perhaps someone got started here who helped other people get started and the trade grew exponentially . Methamphetamine -- also called speed , crank , tweak , ice , lightning , even &quot; the_devil ' s drug &quot; -- is most often snorted like cocaine , although it also can be smoked , injected or taken_in tablet form . Injection produces the fastest high ; as quick as 14 seconds , said UCLA School_of_Medicine psychopharmacologist Ronald K . Siegel . Tablets , the slowest method , take several minutes to take_effect . Methamphetamine raises blood_pressure and heart_rate , and increases electrical activity in the brain , producing feelings of euphoria , arousal , stimulation and energy . Users can go without sleep and remain active for days with a minimum of food because the drug suppresses appetite . With continued use , however , the feelings of euphoria can turn_into nervousness , agitation , anxiety and paranoia . Prolonged use can lead to psychosis , accompanied by hallucinations and delusions -- and violence . In his book , &quot; Whispers : The Voices of Paranoia , &quot; Siegel tells the story of a young housecleaner who was using small amounts of methamphetamine to get her through her workday . One night , as she was watching &quot; The Ten Commandments &quot; with her boyfriend and 7-year-old daughter , she became agitated , upset and paranoid . Believing evil was near , she killed her daughter , stabbing her six times with a serrated knife . &quot; Of all_the drugs I ' ve researched over the past 25 years , &quot; Siegel said , &quot; meth is the one that really is the scariest. &quot; Meth stimulates the limbic_system , a part of the brain that controls the human impulses for fear , violence and sex , Siegel said . &quot; People become animals acting with just the limbic_system , &quot; Siegel said . &quot; They become survival-oriented . It ' s the rage that can drive a Hitler , drive a killer. &quot; Ed Ward , admissions director for Impact Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center in Pasadena , said the number of methamphetamine admissions has doubled in the past six months . Most of the meth users who come_to Impact are white males between 18 and 25 , Ward said , and most are making the drug as well as using it . &quot; Meth is the drug of choice in the teen-age ( and ) young adult population , &quot; said Dr. Drew Pinsky , medical director for the chemical dependency program at Los Encinas Hospital in Pasadena . &quot; Speed hit here in a huge , phenomenal way , mostly due_to price and distribution. &quot; In the first six months of this year , anti-narcotics forces seized 98 methamphetamine labs in the San Gabriel Valley -- a rate nearly triple the seizures in the valley during all_of 1993 . These 98 labs represented 72 % of all_the seizures made in the first_half of 1994 by the six-member meth-lab task_force working_out of the Los Angeles office of the state Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement , which takes_in all_of Los Angeles , Ventura , Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties . Five more investigators joined the task_force last week . The number of small labs found in the San Gabriel Valley puts a strain on the state task_force , which focuses_on the major traffickers . Most of the cookers in the valley are small-time , making_up less than a pound at a time , said Gregg McClung , supervisor for the Los Angeles-based task_force . The labs are cheap to set_up , easy to operate , and take just a_few laboratory beakers , a Bunsen_burner and some chemicals that are often easy to obtain . The entire &quot; lab &quot; can be packed into a medium-size suitcase . Drug investigators say one of the biggest problems associated with busting meth labs are the cleanups , which are time-consuming , dangerous and costly . A small lab , like those typically found in the San Gabriel Valley , costs from $ 2 # 000 to $ 5 # 000 to clean_up because of the toxic chemicals involved . Last year , the California Department_of_Justice spent $ 1.3 million on lab cleanups , McClung said . Police_departments in whose jurisdiction a lab is found pay_for the cleanups from their own budget , and are later reimbursed from the Department_of_Justice , if there is money left in the department ' s budget ; sometimes the funds for cleanup run_out six months into the year , leaving police_departments to fend_for themselves . The funds this year ran_out in April . Some cities , such_as West Covina and Covina , have taken_to billing motel owners where labs are seized for the cleanups , which can take two special_agents and a chemist eight to 10 hours . Labs are fire hazards for neighbors and motel customers . In 1993 , three illegal methamphetamine labs were discovered after explosions ; two of those injured the alleged drug makers , but no neighbors were hurt . Figures for 1994 are not available . &quot; What is really cause for concern with meth labs is they are often set_up in motel and hotel_rooms and the probability for explosion or fire is very high . They could endanger a lot of people , &quot; Baldwin Park Police_Chief Lanza said . And often , the users themselves are dangerous . They haven ' t slept_in days . They are paranoid and they are armed . Inevitably , law_enforcement officials say , where they find meth , they also find heavy ammunition and pornography . &quot; Meth users almost always have guns and almost always have pornographic material , &quot; McClung said . The sentence for manufacture of methamphetamine is three , five or seven years in state_prison , depending_on the cooker ' s criminal history and the amount of the drug involved , and a fine of up_to $ 50 # 000 . &quot; An average sentence for meth cookers is three years in state_prison , which means they will serve 18 months ( before qualifying for probation ) , &quot; West Covina Police Detective Neil Hopkins said . McClung , Allen and others at the Department_of_Justice advocate forming a San Gabriel Valley task_force , comprised of officers from local police agencies . The task_force would concentrate_on stopping the small-time cookers in the valley . The formation of the task_force will ultimately depend_on whether local police_departments , already strapped for funds , will be able to devote officers to the cause . &quot; It ' s going_to have to be a concerted effort by all , &quot; McClung said . &quot; It ' s just a matter of time before we have a tragedy out_in a motel. &quot; Developed by Japanese chemists in the early 1900s , methamphetamine was first used as a medication in Germany in the late 1930s . Often used to treat narcolepsy , psychiatric disorders and as a weight-loss aid , methamphetamine is sold under the trade_names Desoxyn , Methedrine and Methampex . It can also be found in small doses in over-the-counter cold medications , including Vicks Inhalers . The typical meth user is a white male in his 20s and 30s , although some law_enforcement officials say they have seen users as young as 14 and as old as 50 . Meth , unlike cocaine , is a blue-collar drug , traditionally used by truck_drivers , military_officers and bikers . West Covina Police Sgt . Mark Tedesco said most of the meth users he has encountered have low self-esteem , come from broken homes and are lower middle-class . Take the 27-year-old ex-skinhead from West Covina who injects $ 150 worth of speed into his veins every day . His body shows it ; at 6 foot 2 , he weighs only 155 pounds . &quot; The high makes my toenails boil , &quot; he said . The meth addict , who asked that his name not be published , said his father , a trucker who spent much of his time on_the_road , used to beat him when he returned home . A high_school dropout at age 17 , the youth began using speed when he started working construction jobs . The other guys used it to get them through 10-to-16 hour days , he said . &quot; I don ' t like being sober , &quot; he said , fidgeting with his lighter . &quot; Then I feel all_the pains I got. &quot; Drug Lab Seizures During the first six months of this year , law-enforcement officers seized 98 laboratories in the San Gabriel Valley used to produce methamphetamine . Here is the number of seizures in each city : Alhambra : 1 Arcadia : 8 Azusa : 5 Baldwin Park : 14 Claremont : 3 Covina : 8 Duarte : 3 El Monte : 6 Glendora : 7 Industry : 5 La Puente : 3 La Verne : 1 Monrovia : 1 Pasadena : 1 Pomona : 3 San Dimas : 2 San Gabriel : 2 Sierra Madre : 1 Temple City : 2 Walnut : 2 West Covina : 15 Source : California Dept . of Justice , Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement Warning Signs Narcotics investigators say methamphetamine laboratories are becoming commonplace in nice neighborhoods as well as old motel areas in the valley . They say residents should be aware of the following signs of a clandestine laboratory : * Strong or unusual chemical odors . * Laboratory equipment ( glass tubes , beakers , Bunsen_burners , funnels ) . * Fortifications on houses or outbuildings , such_as heavily barred windows or doors . * Chemical cans or drums in the front or back yard ( these containers often have the labels marked or painted over ) . * Automobile or foot_traffic at all hours of the day or night . * People going outside the building only long enough to smoke , especially at motels or during bad_weather . * New high fences with no visible livestock or animals .
