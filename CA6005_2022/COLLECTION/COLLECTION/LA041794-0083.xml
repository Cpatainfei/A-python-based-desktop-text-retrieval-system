   <TEXT> EXPLORING TROPICAL AUSTRALIA ( Rand McNally Video Expeditions Collection , 58 minutes , 1993 ) . For those who have never been to Australia , the typical picture of this island nation is of arid deserts and acres of sheep , with a_few high hills in the background . that ' s why Queensland ' s northeast coastal region can be such a surprise . It ' s a tropical land of rain_forests with a wondrous variety of plants and animals , some found nowhere else . This beautifully filmed video follows a tour group as it explores the rugged terrain of Daintree River , Lakefield and Eungella national_parks , and the Great Barrier_Reef Marine Park . A tour guide gives the history and geology of this unspoiled area . Viewers travel_along the Daintree River and see unusual fish and crocodiles , a black_mangrove forest and an Aboriginal dance group . The 1 # 200-mile-long Great Barrier_Reef , one of the most diverse , complex ecosystems on earth , is a paradise for snorkelers and scuba_divers . Viewers see gorgeous underwater scenes of some of the 1 # 500 fish species on the reef , including the graceful moray_eels , clown fish , sea_turtles and sharks . Tapes are available from International Video Network , 2246 Camino Ramon , San Ramon , Calif . 94583 ; tel . ( 800 ) 669-4486 . Price : $ 24.95 ( plus tax and postage ) . BORA BORA ( Pacific Productions , 60 minutes , 1993 ) . Any film on Bora Bora , considered by many to be one of the most beautiful islands in the world , would probably earn space on a travel video library shelf . Unfortunately , the quality of this video relegates it to a bottom shelf . The underwater sequences are relatively clear and lovely , but above sea_level , the film quality is so dark in many places that details are lost . Viewers first see this French Polynesian island from the air -- lush greenery surrounded by a reef , which encloses a brilliant turquoise- and amethyst-colored lagoon dotted with small motus ( islets ) . The many water-oriented activities at the lagoon include scuba_diving , fishing and sailing . Viewers participate in a traditional tamaaraa ( much like a Hawaiian luau ) on the beach , with lots of food and dance . Other scenes show adventurous tourists feeding &quot; friendly sharks &quot; and walking atop a coral_reef . Underwater film footage shows coral and plant_life , colorful butterfly_fish , turtles , moray_eels , giant mussels , barracuda and playful dolphins . Tapes are available from the Bennett Video Group , 730 Washington St. , Marina del Rey 90292 ; tel . ( 800 ) 733-8862 . Price : $ 29.95 ( plus tax and postage ) . SYMPHONY OF WONDERS ( Reader ' s Digest Videos , 52 minutes , 1993 ) . This video transports viewers on a musical journey to some of &quot; the most magnificent places on Earth. &quot; The score harmoniously captures the mood of each destination by incorporating live sounds of man and nature . The opening scenes of Mt . Rushmore and the closing scenes of the Statue_of_Liberty are , appropriately enough , accompanied by the music of &quot; America , the Beautiful. &quot; Using both aerial and ground photography , the camera films various sites in the ever-changing light of day and against dramatic sunsets . Viewers see not only primary destinations , but are offered glimpses of the people of the area and surrounding scenery . Architectural highlights include the Borobudur Buddhist shrine on the island of Java ; St . Peter ' s Basilica during a Papal Mass in Vatican_City ; the Taj Mahal ; Stonehenge , and the Great Pyramids . Natural wonders include the vast sand_dunes of the Sahara_Desert ; the roaring Iguacu Falls of South_America ; the native people and animal life along the Amazon_River ; Aboriginal dancers at Ayers Rock in Australia , and summer and winter scenes of the Grand_Canyon in Arizona .
