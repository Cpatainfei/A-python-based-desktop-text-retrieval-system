   <HEADLINE> D.A. DEFERS DECISION ON CHARGES AGAINST COWLINGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A close friend of O.J. Simpson who was arrested last month on charges of harboring the famed athlete during his six-hour disappearance will not face criminal charges , at least for now , prosecutors announced Thursday . &quot; The district_attorney ' s office has determined that further investigation is required to make a decision on whether to file criminal charges against Allen Cowlings , &quot; a statement released by the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office said . &quot; Therefore , no criminal charges are being filed at this time. &quot; Cowlings ' attorney , Donald Re , welcomed the news that his client would not be charged , but also noted that prosecutors have not ruled_out bringing charges in the future . That leaves Cowlings vulnerable to a future prosecution and could complicate matters for the Simpson defense_team if it seeks to call him as a witness in their case . &quot; My concern at this point is that they may be trying to use him to gain some tactical advantage in the Simpson case , &quot; Re said . &quot; I ' m concerned that that may be lingering in the background here. &quot; For the moment , the decision not to file charges against Cowlings means that his $ 250 # 000 bond will be returned to him at a court appearance today , Re said . The announcement came amid two other developments in the Simpson case : Closely watched DNA tests got under way outside Washington , and a lawyer representing the parents of Nicole Brown Simpson said he hoped O.J. Simpson would not contest their efforts to win legal guardianship of his two young children . Nicole Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were stabbed to death June 12 . Last week , Simpson pleaded &quot; absolutely , 100 % not_guilty &quot; to the murders . In the Cowlings case , Re emphasized that prosecutors had not shared any plans with him , but he added that their decision to leave his client &quot; hanging &quot; could make_it harder for Cowlings to testify for Simpson if his former teammate wanted him to take_the_stand . With criminal charges still a possibility , Cowlings would almost certainly be advised not to testify and instead exercise his right against self-incrimination as guaranteed under the 5th Amendment , Re said . &quot; It ' s a strategy move_on their part , &quot; Simpson lawyer Johnnie L . Cochran Jr . said of the decision not to drop charges against Cowlings . &quot; Will he be prevented from testifying on our behalf because he has this thing hanging over him ? that ' s fundamentally unfair. &quot; Given the potential impact on the Simpson case , Cochran called_on prosecutors to resolve the Cowlings matter before Simpson goes_to trial -- which could happen as early as September . According to law_enforcement sources , police recovered nearly $ 10 # 000 and Simpson ' s passport from the car after he and Cowlings were arrested June 17 . Partly in light of that evidence , investigators have said they believe Simpson was fleeing , not preparing to kill himself . Evidence of flight to avoid prosecution can be introduced to suggest that a criminal defendant had a &quot; consciousness of guilt. &quot; Re has said that if money and the passport were indeed recovered from the car , Cowlings was not aware of them . If he chose to testify in the Simpson case , Cowlings could bolster the contention of Simpson ' s attorneys that he was not fleeing prosecution but rather was_on the verge of killing himself , Re said . But the decision to leave the Cowlings investigation open makes_it much more difficult for him to take_the_stand , legal_experts agreed . &quot; This makes Cowlings unavailable for either side in the Simpson case , &quot; said Peter Arenella , a UCLA law professor . Harland W . Braun , a noted Los Angeles criminal defense_attorney , agreed , saying that as long as Cowlings faces criminal charges , Simpson &quot; effectively is deprived of a relevant witness. &quot; Braun added , however , that Cowlings could elect to testify at his own risk , knowing that it could be used against him if charges are someday filed but electing to go_forward out of loyalty to his lifelong friend . Even as prosecutors were backing_away from their pursuit of Cowlings , their experts joined with several from the defense to start a test that could influence the Simpson case profoundly . At a Germantown , Md. , private laboratory , experts for O.J. Simpson ' s defense_team were_on hand when 10 % was carved from blood samples discovered outside his ex-wife ' s Brentwood home , at his nearby estate and on his Ford Bronco . The samples were split so experts can conduct future tests if necessary . Conducting the actual tests at the Cellmark Diagnostics lab are analysts hired by Los Angeles prosecutors . The arrival Thursday morning of defense experts Dr. Henry Lee and Dr. Edward Blake was a surprise , because Simpson ' s attorneys had announced one day earlier that they would not participate in the DNA testing because the conditions being placed on them were too limiting . Emerging from the brick and glass complex just before the firm closed for the day , Lee said the conditions for the testing set by Los Angeles Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito are &quot; unacceptable for both of us -- Dr. Blake and myself . Therefore we are not participating in the observation. &quot; But the defense experts wanted to set_aside a portion of the blood samples because &quot; if we don ' t preserve some sample for the future , we don ' t have any chance to do any testing , &quot; Lee said . The scientists were accompanied by Peter Neufeld , a New York attorney experienced in DNA cases . Neufeld has criticized the Cellmark laboratory in the past for producing &quot; false positives. &quot; Simpson ' s attorneys may question the credibility of the lab and the admissibility in court of its test results . Neufeld has sought stringent regulations on DNA testing and has tried to exclude it as evidence in several court cases . DNA , which contains an individual ' s genetic blueprint , can be tested using different methods . The test that will be conducted in Maryland is called Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism ( RFLP ) and is considered highly precise . The defense_team ' s samples , which were mutually agreed to by the defense experts and Cellmark analysts , will be stored in Cellmark ' s vault . Lee said analysts extracted six blood samples from the drops collected by police last month . But it &quot; remains to be seen &quot; whether the samples will be enough to get definitive results from the RFLP tests , Blake said . Cellmark officials refused to comment on the case . Lee thanked the laboratory ' s scientists for their courtesy and said they &quot; worked with us closely &quot; in selecting the samples . Meanwhile , 3 # 000 miles away , a lawyer for the parents of Nicole Simpson said they have asked a court to formally nominate them as guardians for Simpson ' s daughter Sydney , 8 , and son Justin , 5 . &quot; We ' re trying to do what ' s best for the children , &quot; said William M . Walker , a Santa Ana attorney who filed the guardianship petition for Nicole Simpson ' s father , Louis Brown . &quot; They ' ve been with their grandparents ( since their mother ' s murder ) , and they ' re comfortable with their grandparents . I ' ve been told that they are doing as best as can be expected under the circumstances. &quot; A temporary guardianship would allow the Browns , who live_in coastal Orange County , to make decisions for the children , such_as enrolling them in school and providing emergency health_care , Walker said . Walker said Louis and Juditha Brown are not trying to establish a permanent guardianship but one that is &quot; reviewable whenever there is a change of circumstances. &quot; If Simpson gets_out of jail , he can petition the court to regain custody of his children , the attorney said . Newton reported from Los Angeles ; Leeds from Germantown , Md . Times staff writer Davan Maharaj in Orange County also contributed to this report .</TEXT>
