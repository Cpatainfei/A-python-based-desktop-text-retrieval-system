   <HEADLINE> EPA PROPOSES SHARP CUTBACKS IN TOXINS FROM INCINERATORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Environmental Protection Agency proposed new rules Thursday requiring sharp reductions in the output of dioxin , heavy metals and airborne toxins from municipal incinerators nationwide . The rules , which would take_effect a year from now , are designed to achieve compliance with the 1990 Clean Air Act , which called_on the EPA to place stricter controls on stationary sources of pollution . The recommendations would require incinerators to install more sophisticated pollution prevention equipment and thereby cut overall output of toxic releases by 99 % . In all , the proposal calls_for an annual reduction of 145 # 000 tons of toxic pollutants from incinerators , including lead , mercury , sulfur_dioxide and nitrogen_dioxide . The rules would also require substantial reductions in emissions of dioxin , a toxic compound that is emitted from incinerators , as well as numerous industrial processes , and winds_up in the food_chain . That recommendation is consistent with a draft EPA report , leaked to the media this summer , that warned of the dangers dioxin poses to human health and cited incinerators as a major source of U.S. dioxin emissions . The emissions are a particular problem at medical waste incinerators , EPA sources said . Incineration is a popular form of waste disposal across the United States . About 16 % of all municipal waste is burned , compared to 67 % that is buried in landfills .</TEXT>
