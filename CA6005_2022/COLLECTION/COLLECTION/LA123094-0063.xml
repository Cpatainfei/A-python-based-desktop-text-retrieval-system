   <HEADLINE> ALGERIA ADMITS SECURITY LAPSE IN HIJACKING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Algeria promised to fix a security lapse that allowed four hijackers to take_control of an Air France jetliner , but wary foreign firms were not taking any chances Thursday . The crew of a French tanker refused to enter an Algerian port , French passenger transport links have been cut , a Spanish airline has canceled flights , and insurers in London were considering putting Algeria on a war-risk list . Four Muslim militants , wearing the uniforms of airport workers , penetrated the Algiers airport on Christmas_Eve , skirting security measures in place since nine people were killed in a 1992 bomb attack . The airport limits access to people with tickets , police check passengers with metal detectors , and baggage is scanned and searched . But somewhere , government spokesman Ahmed Attaf acknowledged , the process broke_down . &quot; There were lapses and failures in the exercise of responsibilities , &quot; Attaf was quoted as saying in Algerian newspapers . He did not elaborate . The hijackers executed three passengers before flying to Marseilles , where commandos stormed the jet Monday , killing all four hijackers and freeing the remaining 170 hostages . The hijacking was claimed by the Armed Islamic Group , which is also blamed for the deaths of many of the 75 foreigners slain since September , 1993 . It was the third hijacking this year from the Algiers airport . The others ended peacefully when the hijackers surrendered in Spain . Muslim extremists have been fighting to install Islamic rule since elections that fundamentalists were sure to win were canceled in January , 1992 .</TEXT>
