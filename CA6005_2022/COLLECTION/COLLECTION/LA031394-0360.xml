   <TEXT> Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher ' s human_rights mission to Beijing fell_apart Saturday as senior Chinese and U.S. officials let_loose a stunning torrent of vituperation against each other over China ' s recent harassment of dissidents . &quot; China will never accept the United States ' human_rights concept , &quot; Chinese Premier Li Peng , one of the principal architects of the deadly 1989 crackdown at Tian An Men Square , told Christopher during a 40-minute lecture Saturday afternoon , according to a Chinese spokesman . &quot; History has already proven that it is futile to apply pressure against China. &quot; Li also bluntly threatened that &quot; the United States will lose its share of the big China market &quot; if the Clinton_Administration withdraws Beijing ' s trading privileges in the United States because of human_rights disputes . For his part , the usually mild-mannered secretary_of_state was quoted by his top aides as having told Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen , after four hours of frosty talks that included a noontime meal of scallops and Peking duck , &quot; I wish the meeting had been as_good_as the lunch. &quot; Never in the 23 years since then-National Security Adviser Henry A . Kissinger made his groundbreaking trip to Beijing have officials of the United States and China engaged in such a bitter and public display of name-calling on a high-level visit . One of Christopher ' s aides , Assistant Secretary_of_State for East Asia Winston Lord , accused Chinese officials of displaying &quot; chutzpah &quot; and an &quot; Alice in Wonderland &quot; mentality . And Christopher ' s spokesman , Mike McCurry , said Saturday ' s meetings were &quot; the chilliest I ' ve ever had. &quot; Even as the meetings took_place , Chinese security_forces continued a series of actions aimed at harassing both democracy advocates and any foreign correspondents who might disseminate the dissidents ' messages . Several prominent dissidents were asked to leave town during Christopher ' s weekend visit , which coincides with the annual meeting of the National People ' s Congress . Others found their homes surrounded by Public_Security Bureau police . Several foreign reporters who tried to visit the dissidents at their homes were detained by police for supposed traffic violations . Two American reporters , Nick Driver of United Press International and Matt Forney of Newsweek , were held for six hours in the recreation_room of a western Beijing apartment complex where they had gone_in an attempt to meet with dissident labor activist Liu Nianchun . Christopher telephoned the two reporters at their offices after they were released . A correspondent from the_Netherlands was also arrested Saturday , according to a fellow Dutch reporter . The secretary_of_state came_to Beijing to see if the human_rights climate was improving . An executive order signed by President Clinton requires Christopher to make_sure there is &quot; overall significant progress &quot; in a number of human_rights areas before recommending an annual renewal of China ' s low-tariff trade benefits in the United States . The benefits would otherwise expire in July . The Christopher visit has been marked by some of the tightest security seen in the Chinese capital since the democracy movement of 1989 . Police security was particularly intense in the eastern Beijing diplomatic quarter surrounding the U.S. Embassy and the residence of U.S. Ambassador J . Stapleton Roy . In the two weeks leading_up to the Christopher visit and the opening of the People ' s Congress session Thursday , major Chinese cities have been marked by a nervousness that reflects growing concern about China ' s direction after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping . Deng , 89 , is in failing health , and the anticipation of a succession battle following his death has spawned several pessimistic reports about China ' s ability to hold together in the post-Deng era . Some foreign analysts said they believe the Chinese regime decided upon a show of force before and during Christopher ' s visit because it believed some dissidents , individually or through some underground organization , hoped to use the trip for the first serious challenge to the regime since the Tian An Men upheavals . At the center of the furor between the Chinese and American governments was a meeting in Beijing two weeks ago between China ' s most famous dissident , Wei Jingsheng , and Assistant Secretary_of_State John Shattuck . Soon afterward , Chinese security_forces detained Wei and several other dissidents for short periods_of_time . Wei , who was released from jail last September after serving 14 1 / 2 years of a 15-year prison sentence , is the author of a famous wallposter called &quot; The Fifth Modernization : Democracy. &quot; In it , he criticized Deng for failing to end the dictatorship of the Communist_Party over political life in China . The reference was a direct slap at Deng ' s vaunted program of four modernizations to improve China . In the six months since his release , Wei , 44 , had resumed some political activity . In one recent interview with two Western reporters , for example , he urged the United States to keep_up the pressure on China for human_rights improvements , saying , &quot; If you retreat , you lose. &quot; At a news_conference Saturday , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said the Chinese government was &quot; deeply disappointed &quot; by Shattuck ' s meeting with Wei . &quot; He ( Shattuck ) took actions which constituted interference in China ' s internal affairs and in disregard of Chinese law , &quot; the spokesman said . &quot; The U.S. public_opinion played_up the issue , and U.S. officials made accusations against China. &quot; In his meetings with the Chinese , Christopher strongly defended Shattuck ' s conduct . &quot; He indicated in no uncertain terms that it ' s basic to the work of U.S. diplomats abroad to meet freely with foreign citizens , &quot; according to McCurry . Lord sought to minimize the impact of Saturday ' s meetings , cautioning reporters that &quot; this is a three-day trip . . . . I don ' t think we should judge , based on two meetings , the overall tenor of the trip. &quot; Christopher met with Li , China ' s premier , and Qian , who is both vice premier and foreign_minister , on Saturday . He is scheduled to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin today and then see Qian again Monday morning . Nevertheless , the disagreements on the first day were so severe and the rhetorical blasts from both sides so harsh that , privately , U.S. officials acknowledged they have no hope of easing the deep strains between the two governments during Christopher ' s trip . &quot; This was an in-your-face visit , &quot; one U.S. official observed . American and Chinese officials traded barbs and delivered sermons about each other ' s behavior . &quot; When the U.S. visitors come_to China , they should show respect for their hosts and abide_by Chinese law , &quot; Wu said . &quot; There is a Chinese saying : ' Courtesy calls_for reciprocity. ' &quot; Lord countered , &quot; It ' s extraordinary that anyone could make that statement when they ' ve been rounding people up , detaining them , lecturing them , warning them. &quot; Chinese officials insisted that only three people have been detained , and then only &quot; for investigation of their violations of criminal law. &quot; Throughout the day of meetings , it appeared that one key element of China ' s strategy is to try to separate Christopher and his State_Department from Clinton and his White_House . The Chinese spokesman repeatedly emphasized what a good meeting Jiang , China ' s president and party leader , had had with Clinton in Seattle last November . And he returned several times to the fact that the President had said he wanted a China that is strong , stable and prosperous . The other part of China ' s approach was to use its 1.2 billion consumers as a lure to U.S. business in hopes of intensifying the corporate world ' s already strong pressure on the Clinton_Administration to moderate its human_rights positions . It seems to have worked . Appearing this morning before 200 members of the American Chamber_of_Commerce in Beijing , Christopher found himself besieged by business_executives , who warned him that U.S. policies linking trade benefits to human_rights reform could cost the United States billions of dollars in lost business . &quot; United States policy puts U.S. businesses at a competitive disadvantage , &quot; said Philip Carmichael , an executive with a company that sells scientific equipment to the Chinese . William Warrick , a senior China executive for AT &amp; T , which has extensive investments in China , warned that the withdrawal of &quot; most-favored-nation &quot; trading status would result in the Americans being cut_out of the world ' s fastest-growing market . In his comments to the business group , Christopher tried to downplay the extent of U.S. demands on China . &quot; Our specific conditions are reasonable , narrow and clear , &quot; Christopher said . &quot; What we seek in China should not be regarded_as extraordinary . We are not asking_for a radical transformation of the Chinese system . We do ask that China follow the basic standards of the Universal Declaration of Human_Rights that binds most of the nations of the world today. &quot; Times staff writer Rone Tempest contributed to this report from Beijing .</TEXT>
