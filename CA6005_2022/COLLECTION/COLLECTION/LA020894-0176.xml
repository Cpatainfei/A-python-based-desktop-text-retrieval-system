   <HEADLINE> U.S. CONSIDERS ULTIMATUM ON SARAJEVO ARMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration and its European allies are moving toward a decision to lift the siege of the Bosnian capital , Sarajevo , by demanding the removal of all artillery from the city and surrounding territory and enforcing the demand with military power , senior U.S. and European officials said Monday . President Clinton ' s top foreign_policy advisers have prepared a U.S. proposal for the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization that centers_on an ultimatum to all forces in the Sarajevo area to give_up their heavy_weapons , including the Serbian artillery that has pounded the city for months , killing hundreds of civilians . The plan , which also includes options for air strikes and other military_action to enforce the ultimatum , was presented to President Clinton late Monday night in Shreveport , La. , by National Security Adviser Anthony Lake , a White_House official said . If Clinton approves the plan , as his aides expect , the United States will present it at a NATO meeting in Brussels on Wednesday . In another step toward military_action , Britain -- which had argued against NATO air strikes -- said that it is now convinced that some use of force is probably necessary . &quot; The balance of risk and benefit has changed , &quot; Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said , adding that the allies have moved &quot; a step_forward toward using force. &quot; France and Germany also joined in support of air strikes or other action against the Serbian guns . The European Union , which includes most of NATO ' s European members , declared that the alliance ' s goal should be &quot; the immediate lifting of the siege of Sarajevo using all means necessary , including the use of air power. &quot; But Canada , another NATO member , said Monday that it is opposed to air strikes . So did Russia , which is a member of the U.N. Security_Council but not of NATO . The U.S. proposal does not call_for immediate retaliation against the Serbs for Saturday ' s attack -- an idea officials considered but rejected . Instead , the Security_Council would formally demand that the Muslim-led Bosnian government and the Bosnian Serbs remove all &quot; heavy_weapons , &quot; including tanks and artillery , from Sarajevo and its surroundings , one official said . NATO would develop plans to remove or destroy any heavy_weapons that remained past a deadline , he said . &quot; The idea is to end the siege , and the main instrument of the siege has been the heavy weaponry , &quot; he said . &quot; The main difficulty is figuring_out how to remove the weapons in a way that is effective and remains effective. &quot; The plan includes a proposal to provide U.N. forces in Sarajevo with advanced U.S. radar devices , which can pinpoint sources of artillery_fire and direct air strikes or other fire against the guns . If those devices are provided , they apparently would be manned by European troops , not by Americans . &quot; We have not changed our policy of not putting U.S. troops on the ground , &quot; one official said . The immediate spur for the accelerated discussion of allied military_action was Saturday ' s artillery attack against an outdoor market in Sarajevo that killed 68 civilians and injured 200 . But officials said that the tragedy was merely another step_in a long escalation of Serbian bombardments that have made a mockery of the Western powers ' frequent warnings against attacks on Sarajevo . Clinton , during a speech in Houston , decried the shelling of the marketplace as &quot; an outrageous attack on innocent civilians. &quot; &quot; Our government is talking with our allies about what steps ought to be taken_in response not only to this outrage but to the possibility of future attacks on innocent civilians , &quot; he said . The President urged the allies to be ready to enforce their warnings with action . &quot; I don ' t think we should have any more empty threats , &quot; he said . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher told reporters that NATO will &quot; decide on a course of action , on an overall strategy , within the next few days. &quot; And Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , at the Pentagon , said the United States will give NATO &quot; a concrete set of proposals. &quot; Perry noted that military planners believe bombing raids are often ineffective against artillery but added , &quot; We ' re trying to consider it in ways that minimize the problems and the limitations of air strikes. &quot; U.S. intelligence experts told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the artillery shell that hit the marketplace Saturday appeared to have been fired from a Bosnian Serb battery , based on its type and trajectory . &quot; I ' m no expert , but from what they showed us it looks_like Serbs &quot; were to blame , Sen . Dennis DeConcini ( D-Ariz. ) , the committee ' s chairman , said after an intelligence briefing . But Christopher and Hurd said that it is not necessary to pin_down responsibility for the attack to move ahead with a plan to lift the siege . &quot; I can ' t say with authority where this particular attack came from . . , &quot; Christopher said , &quot; but I am quite confident the pattern over the last several weeks has been a pattern of Serbian shelling ( of ) the Muslim areas of Sarajevo. &quot; Canada ' s opposition could be a problem for NATO . Canada has 2 # 000 troops on the ground in Bosnia , and Canadian officials have said they fear that Serbian forces might retaliate against them if the allies mount air strikes . &quot; An air strike is the very last_resort , &quot; Canadian External Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet said in Montreal . And Russia ' s position could make action difficult in the Security_Council , where it is a permanent member . Russian Foreign Minister Andrei D . Kozyrev said that bombing Serbian positions is the &quot; least acceptable option &quot; for responding to the weekend attack and warned that air strikes &quot; would lead to an escalation of the conflict. &quot; The United States and its allies hope to meet those objections by stressing that the NATO plan would apply equally to Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Serbs and would give them a chance to remove their heavy_weapons before any military_action is ordered , officials said . They said that if air strikes are launched , they will not be as retaliation for Saturday ' s artillery attack or any other action but as a means of enforcing the heavy-weapons ban . The U.S. proposal also includes a pledge by the Clinton_Administration to become more active in negotiations toward a peace agreement among Bosnia ' s Muslims , Serbs and Croats -- something the Europeans had been seeking . Peace talks sponsored by the United Nations and the European Union have come_close to agreement on a three-way partition of Bosnia , but European_nations said that without U.S. participation it is impossible to bring the talks to completion . The Administration had refused to join fully in the talks , partly because it did not want to appear to be pressuring the Bosnian Muslims toward accepting an unpalatable partition plan . Times staff writers Richard Boudreaux in Moscow , Tyler Marshall in Brussels , Stanley Meisler at the United Nations , Paul Richter with Clinton in Houston and Shreveport , and Michael Ross and Robin Wright in Washington also contributed to this report .</TEXT>
