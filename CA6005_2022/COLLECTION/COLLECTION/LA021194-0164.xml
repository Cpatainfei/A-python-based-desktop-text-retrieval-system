   <HEADLINE> EX-SEN . CARPENTER FLEES BEFORE FRAUD SENTENCING ; COURTS : A NOTE INDICATES HE HAS LEFT U.S. FOR TREATMENT OF TERMINAL CANCER . JUDGE ISSUES ARREST ORDER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Days before his sentencing on political corruption charges , former state Sen . Paul B . Carpenter has left the country to seek &quot; a more adventuristic &quot; treatment for terminal prostate cancer . In a handwritten note that reached federal Judge Edward J . Garcia on Thursday , the ailing Carpenter summed_up his reasons for becoming a fugitive : &quot; I find my drive for survival stronger than my sense of obligation to your legal system. &quot; Federal authorities first suspected that Carpenter had fled on Monday when he failed to make his weekly check-in call to the court . On Thursday , when it was clear that the psychologist-turned-politician was in flight and would not appear for sentencing next week , Garcia issued an order for his arrest . Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of more_than seven years . Carpenter ' s attorney , Charles F . Bloodgood , said neither he nor Carpenter ' s family knows where the convicted ex-politician has fled . U.S. Atty . Charles J . Stevens said that Carpenter ' s failure to report is a violation of federal criminal_law and that the FBI is attempting to find him . Carpenter , 65 , learned last year that he has advanced prostate cancer . But he repeatedly said he was determined to clear his name despite the physical impact of the disease and treatment . Looking worn and ashen , he took_the_stand in his own defense on charges of mail_fraud , money_laundering , conspiracy and obstruction of justice . After he and his co-defendant , Capitol lobbyist Clayton R . Jackson , were convicted in the case in December , he quickly filed an appeal . He hoped he would be able to remain out of prison , telling a reporter during the trial that he would probably die of cancer before his appeal was settled . At the same time , the veteran Democratic politician who once represented a Downey district was continuing cancer therapy . &quot; I am being treated with the most advanced treatment protocol available in the United States , &quot; Carpenter wrote in his undated letter to Garcia , who was scheduled to sentence him Monday . &quot; Fifty_percent of the patients on this treatment for as long as I have been will survive another 29 months . The other 50 % will not. &quot; He complained that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been slow to approve new forms of treatment . &quot; There are more adventuristic treatment protocols being used outside of the United States , &quot; he said . But since Garcia had refused his request to leave the state to spend Christmas with relatives after his conviction , Carpenter said , &quot; I feel fairly confident in predicting that you will not let me leave the country for medical treatment. &quot; Bloodgood said Carpenter was aware he might be taken_in custody at his sentencing hearing . &quot; On the day of the conviction , the government ( prosecutors ) moved to remand him ( into ) custody right then , &quot; Bloodgood said . &quot; But Judge Garcia said then that there was no indication of flight risk. &quot; Carpenter was free based on his promise to return to court and forfeits no bail . Bloodgood , who said he was taken by surprise , noted that Carpenter ' s hormone treatment &quot; has caused some disorientation and depression. &quot; The attorney said Carpenter &quot; is not that afraid of prison . In my opinion , he is trying to save his life by getting this treatment , and I wish him well. &quot; Carpenter faces_up to seven years and three months in prison for his conviction last December on charges that he had laundered campaign contributions from lobbyist Jackson to former Sen . Alan E . Robbins . Like Carpenter , Jackson is scheduled for sentencing Monday . Robbins pleaded guilty to racketeering and tax_evasion charges and is now in a halfway house , at the end of a two-year prison sentence . Bloodgood said that because of federal sentencing guidelines , Garcia had little latitude in adjusting Carpenter ' s sentence . &quot; The problem is the guidelines themselves are merciless , &quot; Bloodgood said . &quot; They do not provide the court with much in the way of discretion . . . . There is no provision for an exception to grant mercy to a dying man. &quot; Federal prison officials have the authority to release seriously ill inmates , Bloodgood said . Carpenter is also awaiting a retrial in an earlier federal criminal case in which his conviction was overturned on appeal . In that case , he is accused of extortion , racketeering and conspiracy . The charges include extorting campaign contributions from an undercover FBI_agent who was masquerading as a Southern businessman as part of a sting operation . By the time of his first trial in 1990 , Carpenter had been elected to the State Board of Equalization . He was forced off the board by the conviction . Although he won reelection less than two months later , he was barred from resuming office by state law . This is not the first time Carpenter has been in_trouble with the federal_court . Last year , he failed to appear at a court hearing on his retrial . His lawyer discovered that Carpenter was_on a mountain-climbing trip to Costa Rica . But Carpenter eventually did appear and said he was unaware he was barred from leaving the country while awaiting trial . His latest disappearance echoes that of another powerful Southern California politician , William G . Bonelli Sr. , who like Carpenter once chaired the State Board of Equalization . In 1956 , Bonelli fled to Mexico after being indicted on bribery charges for allegedly taking payoffs for granting of liquor_licenses . He died there in 1970 , to the end insisting that he was innocent .</TEXT>
