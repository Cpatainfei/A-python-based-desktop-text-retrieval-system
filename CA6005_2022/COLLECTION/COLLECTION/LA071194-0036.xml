   <HEADLINE> FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES : THE HYPE HAS LANDED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just in time for the media blastoff of articles commemorating the 25th anniversary of the moon landing comes one small souvenir for a man , courtesy of Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin . An ad in the current Robb Report magazine for the affluent offers &quot; Buzz Aldrin ' s 25th Anniversary First Men on the Moon Watch. &quot; The $ 79.95 watch &quot; contains actual historic metal flown &quot; on the Apollo 11 spacecraft Columbia and Eagle . Aldrin , the ad says , &quot; created and now offers &quot; 25 # 000 limited-edition watches and is selling a chance to &quot; literally own a piece of history. &quot; The Case of the Missing Coins In a potentially embarrassing development for securities giant Merrill Lynch , some 399 coins purchased for $ 3.3 million are mysteriously missing from the inventory of a rare coin limited partnership it formed in 1990 with Los Angeles sports mogul Bruce McNall . A cryptic one-paragraph reference_to the missing coins is contained in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing made earlier this month by limited partnership NFA World Coin Fund , which Merrill Lynch formed with McNall ' s Numismatics Fine_Arts International . The filing says McNall and his companies -- which managed the partnership -- severed their ties to the fund in May . McNall , who recently sold a majority interest in the Los Angeles Kings hockey_team but remains the club ' s president , is in personal bankruptcy proceedings and is being investigated by a federal grand_jury looking_into whether he falsified bank loan documents . As a result , a Merrill entity , MLL Collectibles , has taken_over the running of the partnership . In a statement to The Times , Merrill said it has reported the disappearance of the coins to insurance carriers as well as the Los Angeles Police_Department . Merrill declined to comment further until the investigation is complete , except to say : &quot; We have no facts which would cause us to suspect any entity or individual to be responsible_for this currently unaccounted-for shortage . We are continuing to try to locate the coins and to research this matter through our accounting procedures. &quot; An attorney for McNall declined to comment . A source close to McNall said McNall did not personally handle the coin inventory and would have no knowledge of what could have led to the inventory shortage . The Duke Not Included Last year , Great Western Bank put its former Beverly Hills headquarters up for_sale , asking $ 30.7 million for the building . The bank hardly got the price it wanted , nor exactly the buyer it expected . Purchasing the 10-story building for $ 18 million is LFP Inc. , a company owned by controversial Hustler magazine_publisher Larry Flynt . Great Western retains one part of the property : a 21-foot-tall bronze statue of John Wayne riding a horse at the building ' s entrance . The statue , created by noted artist Harry Jackson , was unveiled in 1984 . Great Western plans to handle all maintenance of the statue as well .</TEXT>
