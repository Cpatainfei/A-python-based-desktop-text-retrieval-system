   <TEXT> Israel released 101 Palestinian prisoners Friday as a goodwill gesture ahead of the resumption of talks with the PLO . A government official said the delay in implementing Palestinian self-rule in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West_Bank city of Jericho was eroding support for the peace accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization . A spokesman said Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin had approved a campaign to bolster public support at_home for the deal . Crowds at the Nahal Oz checkpoint sang nationalist songs as the freed prisoners -- all due_to be released at the end of the month in any event -- entered Gaza . Since the peace deal was signed_in September , the PLO has demanded Israel release all_of the 12 # 000 Palestinian prisoners it holds . Israel has already released about 600 prisoners .</TEXT>
