   <HEADLINE> DISCOVERERS AND CREATORS ; THE FILMMAKER : O.C. DIRECTOR GREG MACGILLIVRAY IS ' SUPER-PROUD ' OF CAPTURING THE SPIRIT OF THE EXPLORERS ' QUEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The last surf movie Orange County filmmaker Greg MacGillivray worked_on was &quot; Big Wednesday &quot; in 1978 . That was six years after he and his late partner , Jim Freeman , finished the last of a string of surfing films they produced together : &quot; Five Summer Stories , &quot; a documentary that became a classic of the genre . Last month , MacGillivray found himself on a beach in Hawaii , shooting a new generation of surfers in a film format somewhat larger than the 16 millimeters in which he shot &quot; Five Summer Stories &quot; : IMAX , with a frame size 10 times bigger than standard 35-millimeter . &quot; It was really enjoyable . . . . I was able to meet all these new professional surfers whose names I didn ' t know , &quot; said MacGillivray , head of Laguna Beach-based MacGillivray Freeman Films . The new breed of surfers is finely tuned and serious , he found , different from the laid-back lot he knew as a surfer and surf filmmaker in the ' 60s and early ' 70s . &quot; The modern professional surfer is more or less like the professional athlete in any sport , &quot; he said . Although the new surfers are &quot; very much in_love with what they do , &quot; MacGillivray said , there are &quot; fewer characters than there used to be . In the old days , it seemed like every 10th surfer was a real character . . . . The best surfers were the guys who hung_out at the beach the most. &quot; Surfing is only one part of his current IMAX project , &quot; The Living Sea , &quot; but it represents something of a return to MacGillivray ' s first love . Another sign that his professional_life has come full circle , in one respect : the first video release of &quot; Five Summer Stories , &quot; scheduled for later this year . &quot; The ocean has always been probably the most important thing to me . I really love the ocean , &quot; MacGillivray said . &quot; I ' ve always wanted to communicate that feeling I had for the ocean with an audience. &quot; &quot; The Living Sea &quot; will be the next in an impressive body of IMAX films directed by MacGillivray , probably the foremost director in the format . His credits include &quot; To Fly , &quot; &quot; Speed , &quot; &quot; To the Limit &quot; and the most recent entry , &quot; The Discoverers , &quot; now playing_on the IMAX screen at the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles , and in San Diego at the Reuben H . Fleet Space Theater and Science Center . &quot; The Discoverers &quot; was inspired by the book of that title by historian Daniel J . Boorstin ( related story , F1 ) . It represents a departure from MacGillivray ' s previous IMAX efforts and from other works in the format ( the films are projected on a five-story screen designed to fill the viewer ' s field of vision ) . IMAX films tend to be long on visual flash but short on narrative structure . MacGillivray took a different tack with &quot; The Discoverers , &quot; which briefly tells the stories of six real-life explorers and scientists , three segments with the actual people and three with actors playing historical characters . IMAX is &quot; such an in-your-face kind of medium , &quot; MacGillivray said , that it was difficult to balance the personal stories in the film with the high-tech visuals people have come_to expect . &quot; I ' m really super-proud of ' The Discoverers. ' It ' s not the easiest kind of film to make in that medium , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s kind of the exception in the IMAX world. &quot; &quot; The Discoverers &quot; came_about when MacGillivray Freeman Films won a competition to produce a 19-minute film for Expo ' 92 in Barcelona , Spain , marking the 500th anniversary of Columbus ' journey to North_America . The idea to use Boorstin ' s book as a model was raised , and to simultaneously make a 40-minute version of the film for standard IMAX release . Screenwriter and documentary filmmaker Jon Boorstin , the historian ' s son , was asked to write the script and help direct some of the interior sequences . He had worked with MacGillivray on 1989 ' s &quot; To the Limit , &quot; which took a prize at a Paris festival of IMAX films . His first task was to boil_down the essence of &quot; The Discoverers &quot; in a script for the World Expo film -- for an international audience , with no narration . &quot; I was essentially trying to make a 19-minute silent film out of a 700-page book , &quot; Boorstin said by phone from his home_in Studio City . The work isn ' t an adaptation in any traditional sense : Four of the six characters in the longer film do not even appear in the book . Rather , the film tries to capture what the book conveys about the spirit of discovery and make audiences &quot; feel it through the characters , &quot; Boorstin said . &quot; Part of the trick was to find moments of discovery &quot; where viewers could &quot; understand the story without even understanding the words. &quot; The three historical incidents depicted are Newton ' s discovery of the refractive qualities of light , Magellan pioneering the path across the tip of South_America and the discovery of prehistoric cave paintings in Altamira , Spain , by an amateur archeologist . Three modern scientists were added for the general IMAX release , their stories told in semi-documentary fashion . Jon Boorstin agrees that depicting personal stories as narrative is a challenge in the IMAX format : &quot; It is unusual for IMAX , and for good reason , &quot; he said . &quot; The IMAX camera is big , intrusive , temperamental . . . . It ' s not really an actors ' medium. &quot; Although Daniel Boorstin ' s involvement was minimal , his son did send drafts of his script for suggestions . &quot; He loved the idea of seeing his work played with on film , &quot; Jon Boorstin said . &quot; I have to say it was a great pleasure for me , because I had never worked with him. &quot; Daniel Boorstin said in a telephone_interview that he is &quot; very much impressed &quot; with the film and appreciates that it brings the message of the book to a wider audience . &quot; I was glad to see the ideas of the book translated in that way , &quot; he said . &quot; I was very pleased with the way it caught the spirit of discovery. &quot; Boorstin even helped promote the film by giving a &quot; brilliant speech &quot; in September in Charlotte , N.C. , at a convention of the International Space Theater Consortium , MacGillivray said . &quot; He ' s an American treasure ; he ' s so learned and well-read . He ' s especially interesting to talk to , although you don ' t want to say a word when you ' re talking to the guy. &quot; * As usual , MacGillivray was already putting_together his next projects before &quot; The Discoverers &quot; was released . In &quot; The Living Sea , &quot; he is working with prominent marine biologist Robert Ballard and experts from other institutions . He has traveled_to Palau , an island east of the Philippines , to a village that has lived_in harmony with its environment for centuries ; other locations will include Nova Scotia and Chile . The film aims to point_up threats to the ocean while still giving a positive message . &quot; It ' s not a doom-and-gloom kind of thing , &quot; MacGillivray said . He said his hope is that &quot; the audience will get a real respect for the value and the fragility of the ocean and will use it better . . . . There ' s an awful lot we can draw from the ocean without being harmful to the ocean. &quot; MacGillivray has started work_on the next IMAX project , a film called &quot; Storm Chasers &quot; about scientists who study storms . He already has some spectacular film of hurricanes and tornadoes , he said . His goal is to continually seek new and different projects . He ' s been exhorted to make sequels to some of his popular films , such_as &quot; To Fly , &quot; about the history of flight , but &quot; you have to kind of resist that temptation , &quot; he said . It ' s something he says he learned when he worked as a production assistant to director Stanley Kubrick . &quot; He said , ' Why do the same thing twice ? ' Your life ' s too short to do that. ' . . . The whole point is doing a good job . Satisfying myself is the point in filmmaking , in my mind. &quot; * &quot; The Discoverers &quot; plays daily at 10 a.m. , noon , 3 , 6 and 9 p.m. at the California Museum of Science and Industry , off the Harbor ( 110 ) Freeway at Exposition Boulevard , Los Angeles . $ 10 .

Fleet Space Theater and Science Center in San Diego ' s Balboa Park today and Thursday at noon , 2 and 5 p.m. Beginning Friday , it will screen weekdays at 1 p.m. , Saturday and Sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. $ 3.50- $ 6.
