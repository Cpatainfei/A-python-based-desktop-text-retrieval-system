   <HEADLINE> PROFILES ; ISRAEL ' S DUELING DUO PREPARE TO PUT THEIR TRUCE TO TEST ; RABIN AND PERES ARE VYING FOR THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE AND SQUABBLING OVER WHO GETS CREDIT FOR PEACE TALKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For years , almost 50 , they had fought , usually without mercy and often with soul-destroying bitterness . Their peacemaking had been a pragmatic truce , a decision to halt a blood_feud that neither could win , a decision to cooperate for shared goals . This was not the life-or-death struggle between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization , but rather that between Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres , his foreign_minister and longtime rival . Their reconciliation after decades of knife-in-the-back politics astounded Israelis -- and made_possible Israel ' s success in negotiations with the Palestinians , with Jordan and , as seems likely , soon with Syria and Lebanon . &quot; It ' s a miracle that this combination exists , &quot; commented Matti Golan , an Israeli journalist who chronicled the Rabin-Peres conflict through the 1970s and 1980s , during the latest flare-up between the two . &quot; But there is no doubt that without Rabin ( the peace initiatives ) couldn ' t be , and there is no doubt that without Peres it would be impossible too . &quot; Peres does the visionary work , and the dirty work , and Rabin gives the political backing and takes the hard decisions. &quot; Yet the Rabin-Peres partnership remains fragile and tenuous , threatened by the egos of two men who want not only to bring peace to Israel and ensure its security but who want the credit for doing so . &quot; Somehow , they came_to realize that they cannot make_it separately , and each of them hates that he cannot do_it separately , that he needs the other , &quot; said Nahum Barnea , the respected political commentator of Yediot Aharanot , Israel ' s biggest newspaper . &quot; In the past , they behaved as if they could tolerate each other , but no one believed it . Now , they hate each other quite openly , but insist that it doesn ' t interfere with what they have to do -- and mostly they are right. &quot; During the secret negotiations with the PLO in Oslo last year , Peres would come_to Rabin in his Jerusalem office , and the two men would sit together -- Rabin with a whiskey and soda , Peres with a cup_of_tea or a glass of Cognac -- and weigh their options . &quot; That Peres carried_out those negotiations alone is complete nonsense , &quot; said a senior government official , who observed those late-night meetings . &quot; Every move was plotted with Rabin ' s participation , and every clause in that agreement was negotiated , down to the punctuation , with his initials on the faxes back and forth . . . . &quot; In all_the peace initiatives so far , Peres has used his skills to open_doors , but Rabin has had to decide whether to walk through -- or not. &quot; A pro-Rabin minister recounts how Rabin and Peres usually meet privately before the regular Sunday Cabinet session , and that even then the full meeting is often largely a dialogue between Rabin and Peres . &quot; The rest of us feel_like children at the dinner_table -- allowed to venture an opinion every so often but expected to listen respectfully while our elders discuss things , &quot; the minister said . &quot; And they speak in a language -- mutual experiences , a depth of understanding , a personal involvement in half a century of history -- that the rest of us don ' t have. &quot; There are renewed fears , however , that this 2-year-old partnership could break_down in the midst of crucial negotiations with the Palestinians or Syria , leading to their collapse , or that Rabin and Peres , one or the other hoping to outmaneuver his old rival , might revert to cutthroat politics . After a return last summer to open conflict , political analyst Zeev Chafets warned : &quot; From now on , their positions on sensitive issues -- Palestinian autonomy , concessions to Syria and especially the future of Jerusalem -- will be influenced , perhaps decisively , by two raw , decades-old questions : How does this help me ? And how does_it hurt him ? &quot; * Chafets , writing in the magazine Jerusalem Report , declared what many in the ruling Labor_Party will say off the record and over lunch but dare not repeat publicly : &quot; The two men are openly enemies again , old antagonists gearing_up for one last bloody battle. &quot; Substantial differences between Rabin and Peres , matters of principle rather than personality , do exist on how quickly to broaden Palestinian self-government . Peres wants to press ahead , hard and fast , holding elections and turning_over administration of the West_Bank to the PLO as soon as possible . Rabin , worried about the safety of Jewish settlers in the region , wants to defer elections until security measures are agreed upon and implemented . &quot; Negotiations are difficult because Rabin assumes control but , when things get stuck , asks Peres to solve it , &quot; a Palestinian minister said . &quot; Then we deal with Peres , only to have Rabin and his generals raise objections . . . . &quot; They complain about our muddled decision-making with some justice , but we see a similar problem on their side . They don ' t want to be caught_up in our politics , but we don ' t want to be caught_up in theirs as things get ugly. &quot; Further signs of the renewed Rabin-Peres rivalry are surfacing in_advance of the decision , to be announced in Oslo Friday , on the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize . Both men want it badly , preferably without the other , and both are lobbying hard for it . Peres , according to Western diplomats , has written scores of old friends around the world , especially in Europe , soliciting their support . Rabin called_upon his old tutor in diplomacy , former Secretary_of_State Henry A . Kissinger , himself a Nobel laureate , and received a strong endorsement ; his aides have been canvassing for further backing . * &quot; In isolation , the Nobel committee would probably give the prize to Rabin and Arafat or to Peres and Arafat , &quot; a European ambassador commented . &quot; In reality , however , Rabin has to be honored for his political courage , Peres for brilliant diplomacy . &quot; But two Israelis and one Palestinian seems unbalanced , so the quandary is whether to bring_in another Palestinian and make_it an awkward foursome , or go_back to one and one , and then the question will be which Israeli . The committee is very , very aware of the danger of breaking_up the Rabin-Peres team by choosing one over the other. &quot; The two men have clashed bitterly and publicly in recent weeks over who should receive credit for the breakthroughs in negotiations with the PLO and then with Jordan . When Rabin -- at the request of President Clinton -- decided in September , 1993 , to head the Israeli delegation for the signing of the accord on Palestinian self-rule , he preempted what Peres believed was rightfully his moment of glory , according to political insiders , and the foreign_minister considered not going_to Washington or even resigning . &quot; Rabin is destroying my life , &quot; Peres complained to one confidant . &quot; He ruins my work , he ruins my life , he tortures me . Why ? I don ' t think it is worth continuing. &quot; Only a secret trip by Rabin from his home_in Tel Aviv in a small , non-governmental car for a conciliatory discussion with Peres in Jerusalem on Saturday afternoon , the Jewish Sabbath , prevented a full-blown crisis that could have jeopardized the agreement . &quot; This was the first stiff test of the new partnership , and both the prime_minister and Peres recognized that they had to put aside their feelings if they were to continue it , &quot; a former Rabin adviser said . &quot; They had settled things between them before the ( June , 1992 ) elections and then again when the government was formed . . . . . &quot; They share the view that this is the time for peace , a truly historic moment , and they feel that they , particularly with their experiences and perhaps even uniquely , are qualified to achieve that goal . Nothing else should matter. &quot; But the White_House ceremony in July to sign the Israeli-Jordanian declaration ending the state_of_war between them was a replay of that confrontation . Rabin , insisting that he deserved all credit , initially excluded Peres from the Israeli delegation and then ignored him throughout the ceremonies . &quot; Rabin hates the idea that Peres shares the limelight when he as prime_minister has to carry the burden of the decisions , &quot; a Labor_Party insider explained . &quot; And Peres leaves Rabin with the feeling that without him as foreign_minister he would be nothing . They simply hate each other ' s guts. &quot; In an aggressive mood in Washington , Rabin had savaged his foreign_minister during a dinner at the home of Itamar Rabinovich , the Israeli ambassador and a Rabin adviser . Despite a long history of secret diplomacy with Jordan , Rabin declared that Peres had contributed nothing to the landmark agreement . Peres , who heard of Rabin ' s comments , felt so humiliated that , as he boarded the plane back to Israel , he told correspondents : &quot; I ' m fed up with all this . I didn ' t ask to go_to Washington . . . . I didn ' t push my way into this trip . that ' s what insults me the most . No one got_in the way of ( Rabin ' s ) being the star. &quot; A Peres resignation would not have put at risk the agreement with Jordan , but it would have thrown into question Israel ' s ability to conclude a comprehensive peace with its Arab neighbors . &quot; The Arabs would have read the worst into a Peres resignation , &quot; a Western ambassador said , &quot; and Israeli support for the peace process would have been split into warring camps. &quot; To make_peace , Rabin and Peres turned_to a trusted , if unlikely , mediator -- Giora Eini , then head of the legal department of the Histadrut , the Israeli trade_union federation , a member of the Peres camp within the Labor_Party but a man who has always kept his lines open_to the Rabin faction . * Eini needed more_than 40 hours of almost continuous meetings and telephone_calls to bring the two leaders together and re-establish cooperation . &quot; They call_in Eini more like a rabbi or a marriage counselor than a politician , &quot; a Labor_Party insider said . &quot; He hears all_the complaints , all_the cursing , all_the dirt , and then he suggests a way_out , who should do what , who should say what . Rabin usually feels remorse , Peres gets a measure of satisfaction , a deal is done and that ' s it -- for a week or two. &quot; Matti Golan , a Peres biographer , predicted that the latest Rabin-Peres reconciliation will not , and cannot , last for long . &quot; This won ' t end -- it simply won ' t , &quot; Golan said of the feud . &quot; It is much more_than a political issue . It is a psychological matter , and it is very complicated . What Peres does to Rabin is very painful , and ( Rabin ' s ) responses are not under his control. &quot; A political analyst who sees both men added : &quot; Their feelings are far stronger than dislike but a bit short of true hatred . Peres sees Rabin as shallow , lacking in character , without vision , not a leader worthy of this country . Rabin believes Peres to be disingenuous and devious -- too ready to make concessions , too concerned with his image and place in history. &quot; So deep is Rabin ' s mistrust of Peres that he has regularly assigned generals to Israeli negotiating teams with the PLO with orders to report back to Lt . Gen . Ehud Barak , the chief_of_staff and one of Rabin ' s most trusted advisers , on the talks . &quot; If the generals think Peres is compromising our position , they call Barak , who complains to Rabin , who then pulls_off the table what Peres has just put_on , &quot; a former Israeli negotiator said . * The rivalry goes_back at least to the contest to succeed the late Golda Meir as prime_minister in 1974 , when Rabin , her choice , won out . When Rabin was forced to resign in a minor scandal three years later , Peres replaced him and led the Labor_Party for 15 years , losing to Rabin in 1992 party elections . The two men ' s personal styles accentuate their differences . Rabin is a gruff , short-spoken general who prefers military_officers as his advisers and who works the details of a situation into hard-edged decisions . Peres has an Old_World courtliness , writes poetry and speaks with a prophetic passion . In his analysis of the feud , Chafets went_back to conflicts in the early years of Israeli statehood when Peres worked for Prime_Minister David Ben-Gurion running the Defense Ministry , often clashing with Rabin and trying to block his promotion to chief_of_staff . They remained on opposite sides in_Labor Party battles through the 1960s and 1970s . When the Labor_Party , out of power since 1977 except for national unity governments , replaced Peres with Rabin as its leader in 1992 , judging him to be more electable , Peres faced a choice of subordinating himself or retiring . He chose to remain in active politics , pledging Rabin his loyalty . Far from forgiving , Rabin turned his victory speech after Labor won the parliamentary elections into a manifesto declaring that he , Yitzhak Rabin , would govern -- apparently alone . &quot; Rabin was nervous , and he feared that his premiership would become a facade for party control of the government and Peres control of the party , &quot; Barnea said . &quot; More_than anyone else , Rabin respects Peres ' political cunning and skill because he has been the victim so often in the past. &quot; In the deal that they struck , Rabin would handle the bilateral peace negotiations with the Arabs , and Peres would pursue broader negotiations . In practice , Peres became deeply involved with the Palestinians and then the Jordanians and is now bidding for a role in the talks with Syria . &quot; Rabin will try very hard to keep Syria to himself , &quot; Barnea predicted . &quot; He will cast the questions in terms of security , which is his specialty , and ( Syrian President ) Hafez Assad will see him as the interlocutor . But , once he gets_into it , he will probably find that Peres has already been there , and he will make use of him . To their mutual discomfort , that seems to be a real element of their relationship. &quot; Biography Name : Yitzhak Rabin Title : Israeli prime_minister Age : 72 Career : Educated at Kadoorie Agricultural School , Kfar Tabor , Israel .
