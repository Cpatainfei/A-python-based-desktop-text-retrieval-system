   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / JAMES BATES AND CHUCK PHILIPS : COMPANY TOWN ; A YEAR THAT LEFT ' EM SPINNING ; ' 94 MUSIC INDUSTRY SHAKE-UPS COULD LEAD TO MAJOR CHANGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Among the rules established in 1994 in the music industry : The Eagles can still sell a lot of records and concert seats , monks with good voices can break_into the Top 10 , and it ' s important to differentiate whether rap refers to rap_music or a rap sheet . Mostly , 1994 in music was the year of executive suite turmoil , played_out publicly for weeks . Although things have calmed_down at Time Warner ' s music group for now , there remain some hot spots to watch in 1995 . Here are some of them : * Where will Mo go ? The biggest executive departure in the music business in 1994 -- and potentially the biggest executive recruit in 1995 -- is industry legend Mo Ostin . Ostin ' s official departure last week as head of Warner Bros . Records after an executive suite corporate battle was reminiscent_of the classic &quot; Mister Roberts &quot; scene in which Henry Fonda leaves his ship . Tears flowed as hundreds of employees lined the halls and streets to watch Ostin , 67 , take his last stroll out of the Burbank headquarters of what has long been considered the most successful and stable label in the rock era . Those who run the $ 11-billion industry are still reeling from the bitter boardroom brawls last fall that drove Ostin out the door and nearly brought his label ' s parent company , Warner Music Group , to its knees . The betting is that Ostin will end_up with David Geffen , who is forming a label as part of the new entertainment conglomerate he ' s creating with director Steven Spielberg and former Walt Disney Studios chief Jeffrey Katzenberg . Hiring Ostin would be a coup for Geffen ' s label . Should that happen , expect Ostin to be joined by longtime partner Lenny Waronker , along with a number of hot rising executives and artists . Insiders believe Geffen ' s new company will immediately change the dynamics of every bidding war for talent on the West Coast . &quot; Geffen is going_to make such a huge noise when his new company opens for business , &quot; said one record chief . &quot; There isn ' t a competitor in this business who isn ' t anxious about it , especially with Mo and Lenny probably going_over there . I mean , if I was a manager , I ' d bring my band to those guys in a second . That company is going_to be a mother. &quot; * More Warner stuff . The major complaint about Ostin was that he refused to play ball with the corporation and resisted streamlining his bloated label , which his critics called a graveyard for over-the-hill rock_stars and deadwood executives . But Ostin ' s successor at Warner Bros . Records , Danny Goldberg , has assured anxious employees and talent managers that he has no plans to make slashes in the artists or staff when he takes_over next week . In the aftermath , insiders find it ironic that Ostin and longtime sidekick Waronker may be the only veteran executives to have been purged from the firm . Most insiders are confident that Doug Morris , who was recently granted autonomy over Time Warner ' s domestic music division , has the creative vision to restore order and confidence not only at Warner Bros . but throughout the conglomerate . Morris is starting to stabilize things at Elektra , where he installed longtime lieutenant Sylvia Rhone and industry veteran Seymour Stein to run things , and he moved quickly to resolve an embarrassing breach-of-contract lawsuit filed by superstar band Metallica . * The rap on Interscope . One task ahead for Warner is to finalize its purchase of Interscope Records , the successful label founded by Ted Field and Jimmy Iovine and part-owned by Warner . Sources say Field and Iovine , with buyout offers from other companies on the table , are still waiting for Time Warner ' s board to approve a bid that would allow them to stay_at Warner . The price forWarner to acquire the remaining 75 % of Interscope is said to be a hefty $ 300 million . Interscope has an enviable record of signing and breaking cutting-edge artists such_as Trent Reznor , Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg . Interscope has also bested other start-up labels -- such_as American , Giant and Hollywood Records -- and is now considered a primary competitor in the signing wars among established labels such_as Geffen and Epic . A number of the label ' s most talented stars , however , are facing legal problems as they enter the new year . Dr. Dre , Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Amaru Shakur have all been charged with violent crimes . Time Warner ' s board is known for having shied_away_from controversy in the past , but insiders predict its members will approve the purchase primarily because they can ' t afford to lose the enormous profits or creative respect Interscope brings the firm . * Sumner time ? Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone has made_noises about entering the music business . Viacom spent $ 10 billion earlier this year to acquire Paramount Communications , but Paramount does not have a music operation . Another possibility is that Ron Perelman , whose New World is expanding its presence in Hollywood , will enter the music industry . Companies not versed in music haven ' t had much luck when it comes_to starting_up labels in recent years , however . Just look_at Walt Disney ' s Hollywood Records . * EMI trouble ahead ? Despite reporting decent profit , the British-owned company that had a big hit with chants by Benedictine monks may need a prayer or two in the coming year . * Lots of older records from the Capitol Records catalogue are selling , but where are the new acts that talent whiz Gary Gersh ( handpicked by Charles Koppelman , EMI Records Group North_America chairman ) was supposed to deliver ? The label clearly needs to develop younger acts for the day when it pairs them up with Frank Sinatra for &quot; Duets V. &quot; Virgin ' s Ken Berry is the biggest star at EMI these days , but the glow diminished when his wife , Executive_Vice_President Nancy Berry , reportedly began impinging_on the turf of Virgin President Phil Quartararo . Quartararo tried to get_out of his contract when Warner Bros . beckoned , but EMI President James Fifield would n ' t let him . EMI dumped President Daniel Glass after a lackluster year , replacing him with Davitt Sigerson . Word is that Fifield is also keeping a closer watch on Koppelman these days . * BMG . New North_American chief Strauss Zelnick may need to take_out a help-wanted ad to find someone to run laggard RCA Records . Music agent Tom Ross , like the batch of executives before him , is said to have turned_down the job . RCA ' s country_music chief , Joe Galante , abandoned the position to return to Nashville . Word is that BMG Canada ' s Bob Jamison may fill the spot . On the brighter side , BMG ' s Arista , under Clive Davis ' leadership , continues to outperform labels twice its size . * PolyGram . Its Mercury label is a mess . But Island , run_by Chris Blackwell , and its A &amp; M Records label , run_by Al Cafaro , are both strong . * MCA . MCA under Al Teller remains hot in country and rhythm and blues , and the respected Eddie Rosenblatt at MCA ' s Geffen Records will remain after namesake David Geffen leaves after his contract expires next spring . After former Elektra boss Bob Krasnow was forced_out , Teller moved quickly to pick him up . * Sony Music . This is the one thing Sony Corp . did right in entertainment . The company ' s movie operation has lost a bundle , but Sony Music under Thomas D . Mottola continues to make money with stars such_as his Epic label ' s Pearl Jam and Columbia ' s Mariah Carey . Columbia also launched a West Coast label , with industry vets Jeff Ayeroff and Jordan Harris , that could draw_in new talent . * Final thoughts . Said one industry insider of what to expect in 1995 : &quot; It isn ' t like we ' re entering a new year here ; it ' s more like we ' re moving into a brand-new phase . New music . New technology . New faces in the executive suites . It ' s going_to be interesting to see who survives. &quot;</TEXT>
