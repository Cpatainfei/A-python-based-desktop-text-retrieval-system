   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : PLATFORM / ' ABUSED CHILD CAN GET HELP WITHOUT RESORTING TO VIOLENCE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lyle and Erik Menendez say they killed their parents after being subjected_to years of abuse . Voices asked some Southern California residents whether a child who has been continually abused by parents is ever justified , morally , if not legally , to respond with violence . SUE NATALIZIO , Mother of five , 38 , member of PTA , Greenville Fundamental School , Santa Ana I think legally , when children are being abused by a parent , then violence by the child against the parent or parents can be justified . However , the degree of violence , like murder , demands that there would have to be an awful lot of evidence that physical abuse was , in fact , taking_place . If a child is guilty of a murder , and abuse was taking_place , I also don ' t think that the child should be punished forever . From the moral standpoint , though , the question becomes a lot harder . I personally think that violence does not solve anything . Morally , I have a lot of difficulty justifying a child harming the parents if abuse is taking_place . But then again , a parent does not have a right to hurt his or her child . It ' s a very difficult question . CHILTON ALPHONSE , Founder and executive_director of Community Sports and Arts Foundation and Sports Center , 43 , South-Central Los Angeles Yes and no . Legally , I think everyone has the right to kill , or do whatever is necessary , to save their life if they are in danger . If a parent is violent toward his or her child , then children have a right to defend themselves . However , from the moral point_of_view , I think there are enough ways a child can notify those who can help them without having to resort_to violence . There are child-care hot_lines , the police , social_service centers and other ways . But if my daughter was in a position that she felt her life was in danger and no one was responding to her cries_for help , then I think she would be totally justified to do what she had to do to save her life . MARISA JUARDO , Mother of two , 37 , South Gate When I was a kid , I used to think my parents were the worst thing on earth . I used to hate them . My mom would sometimes really get mad and hit me when I did something wrong . But looking_back on it now , and as a parent , I better understand why my mother hit me . Probably today , some people might call that child_abuse . But I think some parents resort_to violence because that ' s how they were brought_up . In the minds of some kids , they might think a spanking or being grounded is child_abuse . Of course , a child should have a right to protect himself if someone is trying to kill them . But what exactly is child_abuse ? What I ' m trying to say is that what is child_abuse to some , might not be to another . As for me , while I understand why my mother hit me , I don ' t think she had a right . I don ' t hit my kids because I personally think it doesn ' t solve anything . So , hopefully , when my kids grow_up , they won ' t use violence as a way to discipline their kids . By not hitting my kids , I broke the cycle that told my mother and her mother that hitting was the way to rear children . Because , if a child is raised with violence , then violence will be that child ' s answer . TRUDY STAMPER , Mother of high-school and college-aged children , Pacific Palisades I don ' t think children have a right to kill their parents or commit violence against them . But I also don ' t think a parent has a right to commit violence against their children no matter what they might have done . Children need to be taught at an early age , be it through school , church or other areas , that parental abuse should not be tolerated . Likewise , parents need to know that it is not all_right to harm your children . In many cases , other adults are present when a child is abused . These adults should take it upon themselves to inform the parents that their behavior is intolerable and refer them to sources that can help them . We are failing as a society . Society needs to become more available to this sort of thing . To stop child_abuse , we must_not only treat the abused but the abuser . STEVE COLLINS , Family assessment counselor for the Coalition of Children , Adolescents and Parents , 56 , Orange Whether a child is justified in committing violence against an abusive parent depends_on what type of abuse is going_on and the time in the child ' s life it is happening . Obviously , if a child is incapable of taking action , then that is another question . In any event , it basically boils_down to self-defense . The law is very clear on this : It is not all_right to commit violence against a parent and vice versa . So if it goes_to court , the jury would have to determine if self-defense was justified . Did the child do all he or she could have done to find other ways to deal with the abuse ? There are agencies ready to help those who are being abused . The moral dilemma is somewhat nebulous . For example , a person who is religious may consider killing a mortal_sin , but not find any problems joining the military . When in the military , you are justified to take someone else ' s life . So does a child have a right to kill the parents if abuse is taking_place ? Let ' s just say it ' s a difficult question to answer .</TEXT>
