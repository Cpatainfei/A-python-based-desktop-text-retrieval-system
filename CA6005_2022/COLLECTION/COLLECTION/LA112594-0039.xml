   <HEADLINE> STARVATION , ISOLATION KILLING CHILDREN OF MEXICO INDIANS ; FAMINE : OFFICIALS ARE AT_ODDS OVER CAUSE AND NUMBERS , AS POVERTY-STRICKEN YOUNG TARAHUMARA ARE HARD HIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A month before Guillermina Lirio died , her parents knocked_on the door of the Indian boarding_school , the only place they knew to seek help in this village high in the mountains of northern Mexico . The 1-year-old was losing_weight rapidly . With two older children to feed and almost no corn from this autumn ' s harvest , the Tarahumara Indian family had little to eat . The hungry baby cried constantly . Maria Elena Guerra , a 22-year-old psychology student volunteering at the school , tried that afternoon and night to nourish the little_girl with suero , a concentrated liquid nutrient , from the limited medical supplies . When Guillermina was not better the following morning , the three adults carried her to the highway to hitchhike to the church-run Santa Teresita Clinic in Creel , 24 miles away . They waited all day by the road with the crying baby . They did not get a ride until nightfall . At the clinic , for 27 days , Guillermina received suero with antibiotics , and the nurses tried to give her milk . She died Sept . 11 of gastrointestinal disease , infections and severe malnutrition . That month , back in Rejogochi , a village of 25 families , there were three other deaths from starvation-related illnesses . Guillermina was one of 20 children who died of diseases related to malnutrition in a two-month period at the Santa Teresita Clinic , said Sister Virginia Briones , head of pediatrics there . Dozens of children at the clinic are in various stages of treatment for malnutrition , several of them in critical condition . This is the time_of_year when the Tarahumara usually still have food from their harvest . Briones fears that the problem will get_worse as undernourished children are unable to fight_off the usual winter illnesses of pneumonia and tuberculosis . &quot; In some places , blood is spilled with bullets , &quot; she said . &quot; Here , my children ' s blood is being spilled with hunger. &quot; The deaths have provoked a macabre argument -- with federal_officials on one side and medical missionaries and the opposition party state_government of Chihuahua on the other -- over how many children have died and how many of those deaths were really caused by starvation . On one level , what is at stake is whether the federal_government should declare the state a disaster_area and provide relief funds . The deeper issue is the same one raised by the Jan . 1 Indian uprising in the southern state of Chiapas : How should a country aspiring to be a world economic power and ostensibly proud_of its Indian heritage address the unremitting poverty of its native population of approximately 8 million ? Because of that poverty , the 60 # 000 Tarahumara are exceptionally vulnerable to Chihuahua ' s two-year drought , the worst in 40 years , according to a state_government report . In Chihuahua , the state_capital , the drought has meant bumper stickers urging people not to waste water . In the mountains , among the Tarahumara , it has meant hunger and death . Some reports say more_than 40 children have died since July . But because the Tarahumara live_in remote villages scattered among the majestic canyons and wind-chiseled rock formations of the Sierra Madre , no one knows the exact toll . Many children die without ever seeing a doctor . In addition , Briones said , malnutrition weakens children , making illnesses that would be routine in well-fed children fatal . Starvation may_not be listed as the cause of death in such cases . Those ambiguities have led to bitter arguments reminiscent_of the United States ' Vietnam-era obsession with body_counts . Last month , Chihuahua Gov . Francisco Barrio angrily and publicly rebutted a federal report that only one child had starved to death . The discussions have become all_the more acrimonious because of a mystique surrounding the Tarahumara that gives them a higher profile than most Indian groups . The Tarahumara are famed as long-distance_runners , and their territory is a requisite stop on any political_campaign trail . The women ' s long , pleated floral skirts and bright scarves and the men ' s simple cotton loincloths make_for striking photographs . People now call the Tarahumara retiring and peaceful , but they were once alternately allies and enemies of the Apaches . The last significant Tarahumara uprising occurred in 1918 . Since then , they have responded to outside aggression by fleeing farther into the mountains . They have been forced into areas that are at best marginal for growing corn , the mainstay of their diet , according to William L . Merrill , a Smithsonian Institution anthropologist . Since 1977 , Merrill has studied the Tarahumara , particularly in Rejogochi , a collection of log homesteads scattered in a wide valley . The growing season here is from mid-April to mid-October . The success of the crop depends almost entirely on rainfall , Merrill said . This year , it did not rain . &quot; There was no harvest , &quot; said Felipe Ramirez , a 24-year-old native of Rejogochi who teaches first_grade at the 35-student boarding_school . He picked about 110 pounds of corn from his one-acre plot . Last year , the plot yielded 10 times as much , and the corn lasted only half the year , he said . In the late 1970s , Merrill calculated , the average household harvest was 1 # 320 pounds , and even that often ran_out before the next crop was ripe . Ramirez said he expects that he will be able to support his wife and 1-year-old daughter on the $ 110 a month that he earns teaching . But few others here have steady incomes . Most villagers earn a little money by working_at the communal sawmill , taking turns because there is not enough work to go_around . They supplement that income by poaching wood from the nearby national forest , Ramirez said . Those who are able work in the fields in neighboring Sinaloa , a major farming state . Villagers here insist that the problems this year are far worse than the normally precarious conditions in the Sierra Tarahumara , as the region is known . But Alicia Perez , a 20-year-old nurse at the government clinic in her hometown of Basihuare , a predominantly non-Indian community six miles away , said she believes conditions were worse two years ago . That year , a plague destroyed the bean crop and the government clinic had not yet been built . &quot; We feel that there have been a lot of advances in the two years since the clinic was built , &quot; she said . &quot; You are always going_to find that in the Tarahumara region , people are very poor. &quot; Because of the poverty , infant_mortality_rates among the Tarahumara are so high , according to a state_government report , that women on average give_birth to 10 children in the hope that half will survive . Like the villagers , the state_government , run_by the center-right opposition National Action Party , insists that this year is exceptional . The state ' s dams are at only 16 % of capacity , and more_than one-third of the rain-fed crops were lost this season . Gov . Barrio ' s request that the federal_government declare the state a disaster_area was denied , but Mexico_City has sent help , promising $ 18 million in farm subsidies and $ 1.5 million for health_care , in addition to 500 tons of food . Two pediatrics residents arrived last month at the Santa Teresita Clinic , courtesy of the government . Privately , state officials say that is not enough and hint that the federal_government has political motives for refusing more aid . But the reaction was similar when the Huicholes Indians in the Pacific coast states of Nayarit and Jalisco faced a famine two years ago . Aid came almost exclusively from private U.S. charities , while government officials said they were working_on long-term solutions to poverty in the region . Rain finally provided the real relief . The examples of the Tarahumara and Huicholes support the point that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari made at his final &quot; state of the nation &quot; address earlier this month . In commenting on the rebels who took_up arms in Chiapas , he said : &quot; If poverty alone causes uprisings , other regions of the country and a large part of humanity , living under similar or worse conditions , would be in a constant state of revolt . No , poverty in itself does not explain armed violence. &quot; But if Mexicans no longer fear an uprising following the example of the Chiapas Indians , many remain profoundly disturbed by events here . Reviewing Salinas ' address , opposition legislators said that &quot; the current administration is concluding in the midst of misery , as faithfully attested by what is occurring in Chiapas and the Sierra Tarahumara. &quot; On an individual level , Briones , a gregarious , energetic woman , was working_at a hospital in the central Mexican city of Aguascalientes a year ago when she felt called to become a missionary , perhaps in Africa . Instead , she spent six months in a Tarahumara village 10 hours from Creel by dirt roads and now runs a nursery for children suffering from the diseases she had expected to find in Africa . One of those children was Julia Batista , a 2-year-old weighing barely 14 pounds whose bones were sharply defined through her wrinkled skin . Briones carefully rocked the whimpering Julia in her arms as a nurse ' s aide changed her sheets . &quot; If a country is advancing , &quot; she said , &quot; we should see it not only in ' state of the nation ' addresses and trade treaties , but in deeds. &quot;</TEXT>
