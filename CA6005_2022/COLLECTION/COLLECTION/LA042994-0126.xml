Alfredo Rodriguez , who recently turned 18 , was charged in Van Nuys Municipal Court in the Jan . 10 , 1993 , death of Jesus Aguilar.Rodriguez was 16 at the time of the child ' s death . Prosecutors said Rodriguez was throwing Jesus and another young child across a room into a pile of pillows , but Jesus missed the pillows and smashed into a wall . &quot; He said he was just playing with the child , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Robert L . Cohen . Jesus died from a massive skull fracture and other injuries to his body , according to a coroner ' s autopsy . While Rodriguez may_not have had the intent to kill Jesus , prosecutors say he should be convicted of murder because his actions were so inherently dangerous .
