   <HEADLINE> PRISONERS OF TRANS-BORDER CUSTODY WARS ; FAMILIES : WHEN A CHILD IS UNLAWFULLY TAKEN ABROAD BY A PARENT , THE LEGAL AND CULTURAL DIFFICULTIES CAN BECOME INSURMOUNTABLE . DESPITE A TREATY DESIGNED TO SET A WORLDWIDE STANDARD , THE PROBLEM IS GROWING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a Friday evening in July last year , Jon M . Ramirez drove to the home of his ex-wife to pick_up their 2-year-old daughter for the weekend . But neither the girl nor her mother was there , and for 48 hours , a panicked Ramirez heard nothing . In the restless quiet of a Sunday night , the phone_call finally came . The voice on the other end was that of Roswita Olejniczak , the mother of their daughter , Tanyta . She told him she had flown to her native country , the_Netherlands , and would not be returning to California . And neither , she said , would their child . Thus began a harrowing and expensive ordeal for Ramirez , 33 , an insurance_underwriter whose mission to bring_back his daughter , now 3 , has taken him from the Orange County district_attorney ' s office -- which has kidnaping charges pending against the mother -- to the U.S. State_Department to the Dutch courts . Dealing with a foreign government is maddening enough , he said , but &quot; when the fate of your 3-year-old girl hangs_in the balance , the fear and frustration -- the terror -- take_on a whole new meaning . Suddenly , your life comes_apart , and you feel incredibly hopeless. &quot; Cases like that of Ramirez have increased sharply in recent years . There are at least 50 like it in Orange County , according to the district_attorney ' s office . Some have been_on the books for longer than 20 years , and some of the &quot; children &quot; involved are now in their 30s . The figures are also rising in Los Angeles County , where Deputy Dist . Atty . Linda Acaldo says the trend of parents moving children from one country to another unlawfully is creating an almost insoluble legal and cultural problem . In Los Angeles County in 1992-93 , investigators opened 11 such cases and resolved eight of them , Acaldo said ; in 1993-94 , 20 were opened , with 15 resolved , and , based on pending reports , investigators estimate opening 35 cases during the 1994-95 fiscal_year . In San Diego County , 25 cases have been resolved over the past year , with 10 pending , according to Caryn Rosen , chief of the county ' s child abduction unit . More_than half the cases in San Diego County involve parents taking children from the United States to Mexico , Rosen said . Figures from the State_Department show that 441 children were taken unlawfully from homes_in the United States in 1993 to the 32 countries that honor the Hague Convention , a 1988 treaty designed to create a worldwide standard in mitigating such cases . The treaty stipulates that when a child is wrongfully removed from one member nation to another , &quot; the child should be immediately returned to the place of habitual residence &quot; -- meaning the country from which the child was taken , said State_Department spokesman Gary Sheaffer . But officials say the Ramirez case points_up flaws in a treaty that at times seems to defeat its very purpose . The situation is complicated by the ways in which member countries interpret the treaty , Sheaffer said , which leads to the heart of the predicament involving Tanyta Ramirez . Foreign courts have the option of granting an exception to the treaty if , in their view , it would be &quot; psychologically or physically harmful to return the child &quot; -- which is why Tanyta remains in the_Netherlands , even though Ramirez was granted her sole physical custody by a California court after she was taken by her mother . &quot; The courts there ruled that it would be damaging to return the child to the U.S. &quot; because state and federal kidnaping charges are pending against the mother , Sheaffer said . He said a Dutch court made its ruling &quot; only because it feared that the mother ' s arrest would do lasting damage to the child. &quot; Tanyta has lived with her mother since birth . Statistics show that the Hague Convention has stopped short of accomplishing its desired objective . The numbers show an increase in child abductions each year since the pact was signed . In 1992 , 268 children were taken from the United States to Hague Convention countries and 247 were taken_to countries that have not signed the treaty . For the previous year , the figures were 207 and 245 , respectively . The flow of children from Hague countries to the United States is higher , with 357 ending_up here in 1993 , compared to 178 in 1992 and 148 in 1991 . Parental child abduction occurring within the United States has become a staggering problem , according to a recent Department_of_Justice study that says there are 350 # 000 a year . Although most children are returned to their homes within a week or so , as_many as 160 # 000 remain missing for longer , according to the study . The longer a child is missing , the less likely he or she will be returned to the custodial parent . For Ramirez , the seemingly endless hours of phone-calling , letter-writing and lobbying -- and more_than $ 9 # 000 in legal and travel expenses -- have failed to reunite father and daughter . At the time she was taken , Tanyta lived with her mother and saw her father on weekends . Both parents shared joint legal custody , meaning the law required them to agree on all major decisions . Ramirez said he had &quot; no inkling &quot; that his ex-wife would flee . Since then , he has written to President Clinton , U.S. Sens . Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer , Rep . Ron Packard ( R-Oceanside ) , Queen Beatrix of the_Netherlands and the Dutch Ministry of Justice . No one , he said , has offered help . Courts in the_Netherlands -- including its Supreme Court -- have ruled against Ramirez and in favor of the mother , citing the welfare of the child . Reached at her home_in Land-graaf , the_Netherlands , Olejniczak , 31 , said she left the United States because she feared that her temporary green_card , which expired in June , 1993 , would not be renewed . And if she had been deported , &quot; I felt I might never see my daughter again , &quot; she said . &quot; Tanyta . . . she ' s my everything. &quot; Olejniczak met Ramirez in 1987 in the_Netherlands , where he was stationed in the Army and she worked for the U.S. military . They were married in August , 1990 , celebrated the birth of Tanyta in March , 1991 , separated in October , 1991 , and were divorced by July , 1992 . She said it was a difficult and often volatile marriage and life afterward was even harder . Ramirez paid $ 385 a month in child_support , but no alimony . Having trouble making ends meet , Olejniczak approached county welfare authorities for assistance . She received $ 627 for one month , just before the expiration of her green_card , but said welfare officials told her that without a valid visa she could no longer qualify . &quot; Here were these welfare people telling me I was an illegal alien , &quot; she said , &quot; so I thought , ' I better get_out of here. ' &quot; Ramirez disputes her version of events , saying her green_card had been extended_to December . Olejniczak claims to have learned about the extension only recently . &quot; There ' s just an emptiness , &quot; Ramirez said recently . &quot; At night , I look_up at the sky and wonder if Tanyta sees the same stars I do -- and misses me as much as I miss her . &quot; How can you explain losing your child ? &quot;</TEXT>
