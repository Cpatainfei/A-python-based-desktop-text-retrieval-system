   <HEADLINE> A NEIGHBORHOOD SCOURGED BY CRACK FINDS REDEMPTION ; DRUGS : ON 69TH STREET , THE PLAGUE DESTROYED DREAMS , LIVES AND FAMILIES . BUT SOME SURVIVED AND FOUND NEW LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The aging , wood-frame house that Ronald White once called home -- the house he left in search of greatness , the house he returned to in disgrace , the house where he now struggles for redemption -- stands at 69th and Normandie in South-Central Los Angeles . Once , its large spreading tree , covering the front lawn , was a magnet for crack dealers , providing perfect cover . Today the house is a magnet for White , two brothers and three-dozen other recovering addicts . On Sundays they flock there to confront the disease that swept_over them . On this single block , like so many others in Los Angeles ' poorer communities , the evils of crack converged at once -- the dealing , the homelessness , the prostitution and betrayal . One home after another , one family after the next , was felled by the plague . It was not just that lives were lost , it was that life -- simple civility -- was lost . But remarkably , life has returned to the White family and their neighbors on the 1300 block of West 69th Street . What happened there is a lesson in the agonizing cycle of survival that crack creates : Only when its users reach moral exhaustion can they confront their weaknesses and crawl out . The Family Goes Under Sixty-Ninth Street once symbolized the upward mobility of blacks who migrated to Los Angeles from the South , a stream that began after World_War_II and exploded in the 1960s . African Americans settled first near Central Avenue , then spread west as opportunities grew . In 1969 , when Marie White , a native of Mississippi , moved her family of six boys to 69th Street from a cramped apartment two miles east , she found an integrated working-class block whose 30 single-family homes had gardens and fruit_trees . The new arrivals were people with office and Civil Service jobs . It was a community with Little_League , Pop Warner football , a neighborhood beautification program and a culture in which parents watched_out for their neighbors ' children . Mrs . White raised her sons to aim high . Ronald never had time for drugs or alcohol , nor did he spend much time in the neighborhood . He had his sights set_on becoming a lawyer . It was a dream he shared with his older brother Ralph and his younger one , Reggie . They would one day have the firm White , White &amp; White . They were the first post-civil-rights-movement generation of African Americans , graduating from high_school in the late ' 60s and early ' 70s with a sense of hopefulness and new_wave of affirmative-action programs . &quot; We never considered the possibility of failure , &quot; Ronald said . They went_to college and never looked_back : Ralph to UCLA , followed by Ronald at Loyola Marymount University and Reggie to Redlands University . Of the three , Ronald was the only one to become a lawyer , graduating from Hastings College of Law in San Francisco in 2 1 / 2 years in 1979 and passing the Bar on his first try . He returned to Los Angeles with the goal of making a_million dollars a year as an entertainment lawyer . A diminutive man with a warm and thoughtful manner , he worked for a while with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles , moved to an entertainment management company and even hung_out his shingle for a time . But success eluded him . It did not , as he ' d imagined , solve his childhood insecurities about his small size , dark complexion and bookish personality . There was always something missing -- a hole in his gut -- and in an age-old tale of addiction he tried to fill that space with drugs . In college it was alcohol and marijuana . &quot; I felt tall , I felt good-looking , I felt popular , &quot; he said . &quot; I was part of a crowd. &quot; By law_school he was snorting cocaine . By the time he was practicing law he was freebasing it , not long after comedian Richard Pryor severely burned himself while freebasing cocaine in a notorious San Fernando Valley incident . His suits and professional title kept_up the pretense of success . Then crack came_to town on a large scale . At first , it was an experience Ronald enjoyed sharing with his brothers , like talking politics or watching a football game . But the drug ' s brief , intense euphoria was overwhelming , and he began spending more and more money , time and energy chasing it . Soon , at 29 , he was living the life of an addict , not a lawyer . He rode the bus to work and slept on a couch in Reggie ' s apartment . Eventually , he moved_back in with his mother . Not long after , Ralph came_back home . His wife , her bank_account depleted , angrily dropped_off his clothes . Then Reggie followed . They too had become addicts . The block , whose temptations the older brothers had largely avoided while growing_up , suddenly became the center of their adult world . Through crack , these more sophisticated siblings bonded with two of their younger , less successful brothers , Roderick and Ricky . Roderick ' s street contacts kept the older Whites in good supply ; Ricky , who was developmentally slow , had a source of income : a monthly government check . For a while , it worked . They were members of that prized brotherhood : crack addicts who still had jobs , providing enough cash to party in rented motel_rooms . Ronald finally felt that sense of power he ' d craved . &quot; I always wanted to be in_charge of the good time , flashing money , spending_money , being able to call the shots , &quot; he said . &quot; We saw it as a paradise. &quot; Inevitably , they quit their jobs or were fired , and they were no longer controlling crack . It was controlling them . They started selling it so they could keep buying_it . One of crack ' s perversities is how bad it makes you want it . It destroys not only people but taboos . Friends ( or brothers ) who had warmly shared other drugs soon began to cheat_on each other for crack . The White brothers became part of a nocturnal subculture of dealers , panhandlers , shopping_cart scavengers and prostitutes that haunted the 1300 block . A house for rent quickly became a crack house . The Whites ' garage became another . Eventually , homeowners with no connection to crack -- people such_as Kenneth Middleton , who made his living as a security_guard -- would hear their doors being rattled in the middle of the night by users presuming that every house on the block sold rock . There were problems on the block long before crack arrived , to be sure , but crack -- in a way that no drug ever had done -- was exacerbating them , magnifying and speeding_up their effects , turning years into a blur that would later stand to many users and neighbors as a scarcely recollectable interval . On the street , Ronald was now known as &quot; Lawyer , &quot; the man who sometimes dressed in suits and offered you legal advice in exchange for a hit on the pipe . He became , variously , a small-time con_artist , a crack-house doorman and an escort for women who sold their bodies for a $ 10 rock of crack . Ritual controlled him : hustling for money , cutting the deal , cheating and stealing more and more , settling for smaller hits . . . anything for another hit . He and a handful of crackheads would sometimes use an abandoned house not far from 69th Street to smoke themselves dry . One night they were waiting for a young_woman to return to the trash-strewn house with money after turning a trick at a nearby motel . Like men of a millennium ago they waited in darkness , only a candlelight flickering on the floor , no toilet , no running water . They had been smoking for hours , days , pausing to break only when the pipe was empty , when it was time to hustle more money to buy more crack . Ronald ' s hands were black from the heat of the pipe , his cheeks sunk_in , his eyes bulging , his skin ashen , stretched tight across his skull . A can of food was warmed on a hot_plate . No one dared to leave . They might miss out ; there would be no sharing . &quot; Everything I said I ' d never do , everything I scoffed at , I ended_up doing . It was pathetic , &quot; he said . &quot; But when I was in the life , it seemed like everyone was in it. &quot; Whenever they ran_out , the block ' s main dealer , a younger_man named Donnell , was waiting . The Dealer Rises Donnell Alexander and his two brothers and two sisters lived_on the other side of 69th in a neat , well-furnished home_in the middle of the block . His father was a Postal Service worker with high expectations for his son . As a child , Donnell had admired the White children on the corner . When he went_off to community_college , he dreamed that he would make_it in professional_football . But crack took Donnell too -- in a different way . Attracted by early reports that the new drug was an aphrodisiac , he was one of the first on the block to try it ; he was disappointed . Then , as the market took_flight , he was drawn by the financial prospects of selling a drug that forced the users to buy_it over and over again in an increasingly tighter spiral of abuse . Donnell was 21 , typical of the youthful first wave of crack dealers . Their customers tended to be older_men and women , raised in the 1970s , an era that celebrated casual drug use . Donnell never had a qualm . &quot; It was business , &quot; he said matter-of-factly . &quot; Crack could make you do anything -- anything maybe except shoot yourself in the head , because then you would n ' t be able to get any more . I didn ' t care if the ( users ' ) kids didn ' t eat . I just wanted the money -- and crack was a moneymaking machine. &quot; His early drug experiments had given him contacts among the neighborhood ' s older dealers . He knew how to cook_up crack by shaking baking soda with cocaine . Donnell had one more advantage : He was not hooked on crack . He was hooked on power . The drug would become a tool to manipulate lives like the Whites , whose stars shone brighter than his . He began delivering crack on a moped and eventually set_up crack houses , including one that he rented a_few doors from his mother ' s home . With the money , he employed a small legion of dealers -- mostly crack addicts -- to peddle his product , paying them with the drug . The block was a great source of labor . Ronald and his college-educated brothers , selling to support their habits , occupied the lowest rung . Roderick White , a childhood friend of Donnell who had hung_around the house with few ambitions after graduating from high_school , often worked as a courier , delivering drugs to dealers in San Diego . Donnell didn ' t trust him ; Roderick tended to sample what he sold . The Whites joined other sons and daughters of the block who were busy transforming 69th into a drive-through minimarket for crack . Louis ( Paco ) Radford , the stepson of another postal worker who lived_down the street , was also a foot_soldier . Next door to Donnell ' s crack house lived Joanne Smith , who sat on the porch and monitored the block for police or other signs of trouble in exchange for crack . &quot; Nobody ever left the block , &quot; Smith said . &quot; You ' d go_away for a while and end_up right back here . The neighborhood just sucked you up . . . . My crack pipe was my MasterCard. &quot; Business at the corner , under the house with the great spreading tree , was frenetic . You pulled your car up and got instant service . Sometimes there was a rush of competing hustlers . Once Ralph White beat them to a car pulling_up to the house and held_out his rocks . He looked_into the car ' s open passenger window , said &quot; What do you need ? &quot; and stared into a face that was familiar and terrifying . It was his mother . A friend was dropping her off from church . &quot; I turned , broke and ran , &quot; he said . &quot; Humiliation . Total humiliation. &quot; Ronald , standing nearby , slipped_away into the crowd . For three years this was the nightmare that Marie White , nicknamed Saint Marie by her neighbors , lived . She had escaped the harsh rural life in the small Mississippi Delta town of Cleveland . She ' d come here as a teen-age single mother and supported her family by doing everything from housecleaning to taking_in laundry . In her 40s she ' d gone_back to school , earning a degree with honors from Cal State L.A. And now , just as she began preparing to enjoy her own life , her sons ' addictions were pulling the house apart . Her shoes were stolen from the closet , food from the refrigerator . The gold clock she was awarded for community service disappeared . She could not leave her purse unattended . Her garage had become a smokehouse for her sons and other neighborhood addicts . When she left home for a week on a vacation cruise they turned the entire place into a crack house , selling rocks out the front_door and smoking in the back . After she returned and they closed_down sales , customers continued to drop_by the house at all hours . &quot; I couldn ' t believe educated people did this , &quot; she said . &quot; It was the hardest thing for me to admit. &quot; As her sons ' devotion to crack hit its peak , she began to suspect that they were planning to kill her to take the last of what was left . She called a breakfast meeting and confronted them . &quot; Don ' t even think_about killing me to get what I have left , &quot; she told them . &quot; I don ' t have anything for you . You won ' t get a dime. &quot; They thought she was crazy . Through it all , she never put her sons out , clinging_to the belief that they would turn_around . She had frequent nightmares that someone would call to tell her that one of them was dead . She counted heads to be certain they made_it through another day . She cringed motionlessly at their stupidity . Like the day Ronald was assigned by a dealer to hawk marijuana and used the profits to buy and smoke crack . He was at his mother ' s house when the dealer came looking_for him . On the lawn , under the tree , the dealer knocked him down and began kicking and stomping him into the street . Out of the corner of his eye , Ronald could see his mother on the porch . He was waiting for her to cry_out , but she just stood_watching . &quot; Thank you , thank_you , &quot; Mrs . White was saying to herself . &quot; Maybe this will do it. &quot; She turned and coldly walked back to the house . &quot; She was the last person who had believed_in me , &quot; Ronald said , &quot; and she was turning_away . that ' s when I knew I had hit bottom. &quot; The next day he checked_into a rehabilitation center_on Skid_Row . Off the street , he rested for the first time in weeks , suffering through sweats , fighting the nagging craving for crack . Bone tired , he did little other_than sleep and eat . &quot; No more games , no more hustling , &quot; he decided . Ronald was the first to successfully complete the journey out . Several other brothers soon began to slowly push each other in the same direction . Roderick saw the change when he got_out of jail after serving a six-month sentence for selling to an undercover officer . He ' d expected the comfort of crack at_home . It wasn ' t there . With encouragement from his brothers he checked_into a treatment center but couldn ' t stick_with it , dropped_out and wound_up living_on the street on Skid_Row . Weeks later , Roderick placed a desperate call home , asking if he would be allowed to celebrate Christmas with the family . When he walked into the house , his mother didn ' t recognize him . His clothes were tattered , his hair matted , a string holding_up his pants . &quot; He smelled like something that had been buried , &quot; Mrs . White said . &quot; This was my baby. &quot; The other brothers hadn ' t told their mother where Roderick was . &quot; If you had known , you would have gone and got him , &quot; Ralph told her . Roderick , the brothers insisted , had to make the change himself for the change to stick . It did . That Christmas , 1987 , was different . The brothers , who used to eat quickly and sneak_off to smoke , stayed longer and enjoyed each other more . The strength of their family had saved the White brothers . But just as they began to exit the drug life , their block , like so many others throughout Los Angeles , was plunging further into hell because of the irreversible forces unleashed by the genie called crack . The Block Goes Under One of the ways Donnell established his reputation as a dealer was by giving free samples . He wanted to be looked_upon as a benefactor . Word got_around . New , competing crack houses sprang_up on 69th Street . Throughout South-Central Los Angeles , newly prosperous dealers were willing to spend a_few hundred dollars a month renting inconspicuous single-family homes . Marie White was stunned when she realized that the people who had rented the house next to her were part of a Jamaican drug gang . Crack users -- some of them middle-class people driving_in from a surprising swath of Los Angeles -- began turning_over paychecks , cars and other possessions to Donnell to feed the monster inside them . Donnell remodeled his crack house , adding a pool_table , a microwave and television monitors to scout both ends of the block . At one point he had $ 50 # 000 to burn . Trouble was , with all that cash he soon needed protection , not just from the police but also from criminals who viewed crack houses as an easy_mark . He stockpiled Uzis and other automatic weapons -- and made_sure competing dealers knew about them . &quot; Anyone who opened_shop on the block had to first go_through us , &quot; he said . &quot; They had to get our approval. &quot; Donnell ' s crack house drew increasing scrutiny . After neighbors complained about the traffic , undercover police placed the block under surveillance . One night police made a buy outside the house and raided it . Donnell got_away , but one of his brothers was arrested . Another time , Donnell was shot in the leg by a gunman who broke_into his father ' s guest house demanding money . Donnell ' s other brother was shot and stabbed by a rival dealer , who himself was found in a car trunk a_few days later , shot to death . &quot; I felt_like a target , &quot; Donnell said . On surrounding streets , once-reputable neighborhood businesses became fronts for crack sales : A hot dog stand added a new , unadvertised item to its menu . An ice_cream truck repeatedly circled the block long after the children were asleep . Pimps were driven_out of business by women so addicted to crack that they plied their trade alone on the street , in cars and alleys . Kenneth Middleton , the security_guard , had moved onto the block a_couple_of years before the crack epidemic with his wife and two children . One day , returning from a trip to the store , he was confronted by a panicked dealer . &quot; Where ' s my stash ? &quot; the dealer demanded . Unbeknown to Middleton , the dealer had hidden marijuana in the bumper of Middleton ' s car . Even the ethnicity of Middleton ' s wife was a drug flash_point . Because she was Jamaican , and because a Jamaican gang ran a crack house on the block , users once mistakenly tried to buy drugs at the Middleton house . Despite the constant danger , Middleton , like many others , did not confront the madness . He adapted , rather than challenge the drug_traffickers and their customers . &quot; They didn ' t bother me , so I didn ' t bother them , &quot; he said . Nevertheless , the elders on the block lived_in fear of the children . The stronger parents laid_out the rules and held their breath . Rosalyn Durr , who lived a_few doors east of the Whites and had grown_up a friend of the brothers , heard it from her father : You can go_to the corner house and stop , or you can keep walking . &quot; I decided to keep walking , &quot; she said . Her younger brother , Eric , also missed the worst years of the plague . A couple of years before crack ' s birth , he was sent to prison for killing a man in a Marina del Rey nightclub . It was a blessing , Rosalyn decided later . &quot; It probably saved his life. &quot; With business to attend_to , Donnell lost sight of what crack was doing to his family . His younger sister , Monique , became hooked and started hanging_out in crack houses , where she was abused by men who lured her with the drug . She was 17 and on the edge of one of the most pitiful sights of the plague : crack-smoking women who eventually became prostitutes . These women got pregnant , had children and lost them in a cycle of indignity . &quot; Skeezers , &quot; the men called them . &quot; Hos. &quot; &quot; Strawberries. &quot; Some nights , Joanne Smith , the friend who lived next to Donnell ' s crack house , would find Monique at another crack house , drive her home , stand her up outside in front of Monique ' s parents ' house and honk her horn . &quot; She never had a chance , &quot; Joanne said . &quot; It was a bad scene because she was so young. &quot; One evening the two planned to go_out smoking together , but Monique rushed_off for a date with a man in a rust-colored car . She said she would be back in a_few minutes but never returned . &quot; She ran_off , and I had this feeling that something is wrong , very wrong , &quot; Joanne said . On Sept . 12 , 1988 , Monique ' s nude body was found by a man walking his dog in an alley near Vernon and Western avenues . She had been shot several times . Police listed her as one of several possible victims of a serial_killer who preyed on prostitutes and crack users . Monique ' s death had a chilling effect on the block . It was the first killing that could be blamed , at least indirectly , on crack . Donnell was horrified by the fact that she had bled to death -- and troubled by his own , unsubstantiated fear that Monique had been murdered in retaliation by a customer he ' d ripped_off . Losing Monique made Joanne , 25 -- the mother of a 5-year-old girl and now pregnant -- begin to question her addiction . But it did not make her stop . A few months later , something else did . After five days of marathon smoking , Joanne awoke early one morning and found herself in a hotel about 40 blocks from home . She gathered her purse and a bag of clothes and started walking home . Somewhere along the way , she would later remember , she blanked_out but kept walking . She must have been drifting along in a haze for a block when she heard a horn blow , and a man ' s voice . &quot; Lady ! Lady ! &quot; he said . &quot; Baby ! What ' s wrong with you ? &quot; He was an older_man in a car . &quot; I have been following you for the longest , &quot; he said . &quot; You have been walking and crying. &quot; Joanne told the man she just wanted to go_home . &quot; Where do you live ? &quot; he asked . &quot; I don ' t want to know the address. &quot; She stumbled to his car and he drove her to the corner of 69th Street and Normandie . &quot; Whatever is troubling you in your life , &quot; he told her , &quot; you need to change it. &quot; Joanne walked into her house . She remembered the man , the ride home , but everything else was a blank . And maybe that was good , she said to herself . Somehow during her journey , she lost her purse and the clothes bag . She had a scar on her forehead . &quot; What happened ? I don ' t know , &quot; she said . &quot; I was pregnant and tired . When I got inside my house , I got_on my knees and prayed : ' God just give me the strength to quit because I ' m tired. ' And that is when I first decided to give_up smoking dope . But in my mind I still wanted to get high. &quot; Weeks later , five years after crack came_to town , she would take her last hit on a pipe , early in the morning on Feb . 4 , 1989 . It was the day she gave_birth to her son Demon , who entered the world with the shakes , suffering from his own addiction to the drug . Under court_order , Joanne left the baby with relatives and checked_into a treatment center . She hasn ' t smoked since . &quot; I had a choice. &quot; she said . &quot; I could smoke dope or have my children . I chose to have my children . I had smoked off paychecks , good jobs , good men . Just imagine all_the time and energy I spent into getting high , what I could have done. &quot; The same questions were going_through Ronald White ' s mind . By the time Joanne quit , Ronald had been clean for two years . He had more options than most crackheads on 69th Street . He had been working as a proofreader and a bookkeeper , and now he started to wonder how he might reclaim his legal career -- and how he might explain that gaping hole in his resume , the years he ' d spent on crack . He applied for an opening in the public_defender ' s office . He was brought before a team of attorneys and ultimately the agency ' s chief , Wilbur Littlefield . They reviewed his resume and indicated they liked what they saw . There was , however , one question , the one that Ronald dreaded . He told the truth , and he told them drugs were no longer part of his life . The job was his . &quot; It wasn ' t a difficult decision , &quot; said Littlefield , who retired last year . &quot; We are there to help people , to give people a chance . If the public_defender would n ' t do_it , then who would ? &quot; Soon Ronald moved_out of his mother ' s house and was_on his own . He married in 1991 , the same year his wife gave_birth to a son , Ronnie . The proud father was there to cut his son ' s umbilical_cord . A year later , three streets away at Florence and Normandie , the Los Angeles riots erupted in the wake of the verdict acquitting policemen accused of beating Rodney King . On their television_sets , residents watched neighbors throwing rocks and bottles and looting . The very rioters convicted of brutally beating trucker Reginald Denny were acquaintances . Henry Keith Watson grew_up on the block . Damian Williams lived a_few blocks away , and Antoine Miller was also known in the neighborhood . Miller ' s mother was known on the block too , for her past addiction to crack . For reasons the neighborhood is hard-pressed to explain , crack use seemed to surge upward after the riots , then leveled_off and plummeted . Donnell got himself arrested for the first time for selling and served half a year . Paco Radford , who sold drugs on the block , was also arrested . A painful transformation was occurring . Gradually , people who spent their time living to buy crack were disappearing -- dying or going_to jail or starting to grope toward salvation . It was as though the fire that had consumed the block and the neighborhood had run_out of brush to burn . New communities of users were sprouting throughout Los Angeles as the plague slowly ebbed in its first home_in South-Central and lurched elsewhere . A struggling sense of the old vibrancy began to return to the 1300 block of 69th Street . The Neighborhood Watch club was rekindled . Cleanup campaigns began . Residents chipped_in to beautify each other ' s front lawns . The block club fought a successful battle to limit hours of a nearby liquor_store . Rosalie Galpin , 70 , a retired machine_shop worker who had lived_in her home for half a century , noticed the difference . She had watched the block fall with a sense of frightful wonderment , closing herself off from it , making less neighborly chitchat , losing friends . &quot; Now that some of those young culprits are gone , things have gotten a lot better , &quot; she said . &quot; People are trying harder to keep the neighborhood up. &quot; Epilogue Donnell , 31 , abandoned a life as a dealer after his arrest . He now works with his father , Porter Alexander Jr. , in the construction business and believes he was a pawn of a government conspiracy to circulate drugs in the black community . He got_out , he said , because he got sick_of playing the game . &quot; I was tired_of trying to figure_out who I was going_to jack ( rob ) next , &quot; he said . &quot; It was a sickness. &quot; Joanne Smith , free_of drugs for five years , has three children : Schvetta , 11 , Demon , 5 , and Louis , 2 . She also provides a room for two other children whose parents were lost to crack . Her youngest child was fathered by Paco Radford , a seller on the block . Paco was shot to death in a domestic dispute last year with another woman in a Gardena hotel . Marie White lives with one son , Roderick , in the house with the great spreading tree . Two family photos hang_on her living room wall . One reveals a family of men with gaunt , tired faces , warped by life on the street . Ronald didn ' t make that picture . The second photo , full of round , healthy faces , brightens up the room . She knew her voice would echo and eventually steer her boys home , Mrs . White says . It wasn ' t simply her wisdom . It was the values of the neighborhood : the friends , the teachers , the extended_family -- the civility nobody seemed to believe_in any more . It grew on this block . It had been resurrected . &quot; I never really gave_up hope , &quot; she said . On Sunday mornings , a crowd of 30 to 40 gathers at the house . It is a recovery group , loosely modeled on Alcoholic Anonymous , formed and zealously promoted by Ronald in his commitment to staying clean . Of the 12 steps to recovery , he says , the first is the most important : The need to admit that you have a problem , that you are powerless unless you resolve it . Looking_back , Ronald strains to remember . &quot; Everything was filtered through eyes that were not quite seeing reality , &quot; he says . &quot; It was like suffering amnesia . Every so often , snippets and pieces come_back and you say , ' Who ? Did I really do that ? ' &quot; Ralph White , 41 , has remarried and works as a paralegal for a Downtown law_firm . Reggie , 38 , is an office worker for a Downtown corporation and is married . Roderick , 35 , works nights in a recovery home for addicts . Ricky , 37 , has his own place a_couple_of blocks from his mother ' s home . For Ronald , 40 , the saga of 69th Street has carried_over into his routine as a deputy public_defender at the Compton Courthouse , where he often juggles 30 criminal cases , many involving people on crack . The lesson ? &quot; Sometimes , &quot; he says , &quot; you have to hit the bottom before you can reach back and see the way out. &quot; On a recent day in the courthouse , White represented a gang member accused of shooting his girlfriend ' s foot half off in a jealous rage . The young_man sat sternly in his chair as the woman hobbled to the witness_stand and relived the painful experience that permanently crippled her . After the prosecutor concluded her questioning , Ronald asked his client a_few . The gang member ' s eyes never turned_in his victim ' s direction . Then Ronald asked the young_woman to show her mangled foot . She lifted it , covered in a neat , white sock . He asked her to take_off the sock . A hush fell as she slowly , painstakingly , removed the sock and revealed what was left of her foot . The defendant ' s defiant expression melted away to reflect his horror at what he had done . It was the reaction White had hoped for . This wasn ' t about tactics , he would explain later . It was about morality . He wanted the gang member to taste the consequences of his act . He wanted him to hit rock-bottom .
