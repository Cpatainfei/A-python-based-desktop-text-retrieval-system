   <HEADLINE> HOW CONGRESS SHOULD OPERATE ON HEALTH_CARE SYSTEM ; CENTRAL TO THE ISSUE IS THE SOARING RATE OF MEDICAL COSTS . WE MUST ACT BEFORE THESE PROBLEMS GET_WORSE , BUT WE MUST MOVE CAREFULLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This year ' s debate over health_care reform has demonstrated how enormously complex and difficult it will be to slow the growth of our dangerously high health_care costs and to ensure that all Americans have access to the health_care they need . But despite the impasse we have reached for the time being , the very fact that a full national debate over this very serious issue has begun in_earnest -- and it will continue -- means that health_care reform has at last received the priority it deserves . Spending on health_care has been rising at an unsustainable rate . As recently as 1965 , we spent 6 % of our gross_domestic_product on health_care . We now spend 14 % , and , if current trends continue , that figure will rise to 18 % or 19 % by the year 2000 -- only six years from now . All of us feel these higher costs in the prices charged for insurance_policies , in out-of-pocket deductibles and co-payments , in lower wages that result from companies ' paying more for health benefits , and in federal , state and local taxes to support government-sponsored health_insurance and health_care programs . The costs of Medicare and Medicaid ( Medi-Cal ) , in particular , are growing at an alarming rate . Since 1980 , federal spending for Medicare and Medicaid has grown by 113 % -- after adjusting for inflation . In 13 years , these two programs have risen from 16 % of the federal_government ' s domestic budget to 22 % this year and , unless changes are made , will rise to an astounding 35 % five years from now . These increasing costs are the major obstacle to eliminating federal budget_deficits , and to reordering federal spending priorities so that more funds are available for other critical national needs . One reason our health_care costs are rising so rapidly is that the proportion of Americans over age 65 -- those with the greatest need for health_care -- is growing each year . Another is that more treatments have been made_possible by medical and technological advances . A third is extremely high administrative costs , accounting_for fully one-quarter of all U.S. health_care costs . In addition , we have too many hospital_beds , a surplus of specialists and a shortage of primary-care physicians , a high rate of unnecessary procedures , high medical malpractice insurance costs , dependence on high-cost emergency_room care by those who lack insurance and very high prices for many prescription_drugs . Most Americans have employer-provided health_insurance . Almost everyone over 65 is covered by Medicare , and about half the poor are covered by Medicaid . But nearly 40 million Americans -- 85 % of whom are workers or their dependents -- have no health_insurance at all . They rarely see a physician , waiting until a problem becomes acute . Then they resort_to emergency_room services , the most expensive care . Since the uninsured often are unable to pay their medical_bills , hospitals and doctors shift the cost to patients with insurance . Even more worrisome , millions of additional Americans lose their insurance as they lose or change their jobs . And increasing numbers of workers avoid changing jobs , because of fear of losing valued health benefits . Even those who remain in their current jobs have no guarantee of continued coverage , and people who work for small businesses are especially at risk of losing their insurance . If only one employee of a small business becomes seriously ill , insurance_companies usually raise rates to unaffordable levels or refuse to renew coverage . Even small businesses with low-risk employees often pay 30 % to 40 % more_than large companies , which negotiate discounts for insurance , for identical coverage . Not surprisingly , about two-thirds of workers without health_insurance are employed by firms with fewer than 100 employees . Many of those firms would like to provide insurance for their employees but simply cannot afford to . For those who do have insurance , benefit packages vary widely , and many are seriously underinsured . The most serious gap in coverage for those who are insured is for illnesses or disabilities that require long-term care , which is a special concern of older Americans since Medicare does not cover nursing or home care , and little private insurance is available . We must act before these problems get_worse , but we must move carefully . All the alternatives to the present health_care system raise serious questions . But costs are rising faster than our ability to meet them ; large_numbers of Americans are experiencing personal crises because they cannot pay_for the health_care they need . And our capacity to compete in the global economy is seriously threatened by health_care costs that are far higher than those of other nations . Although I am disappointed that we were not_able to make more progress in solving these problems this year , I believe it would have been a mistake to have tried to develop and rush through Congress a major restructuring of our health_care system in the waning days of this session . Congressional leaders have made the right decision to focus_on passing , if anything , a bill which will serve as a modest first_step in addressing the problems . Because of this year ' s groundwork , Congress will return to the issue next year with a far better understanding than we had a year ago of how we might extend coverage and control costs , and how we can accomplish those goals without disrupting the health_care of those who are satisfied with the benefits they currently receive . We will be able to respond more effectively to the needs and desires of Americans as individuals , as well as serve the best interests of our nation as_a_whole .</TEXT>
