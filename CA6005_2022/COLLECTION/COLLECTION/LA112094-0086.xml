   <HEADLINE> A DISASTER WHEN BOSTON DOCTOR PACKS HIS BAGS ; MEDICINE : TOM DURANT ' S PASSPORT AND VISA PHOTOS ARE ALWAYS CLOSE_AT_HAND IN CASE HE ' S NEEDED AT A REFUGEE CAMP OR IN A WAR ZONE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Boston physician Tom Durant , vacations are almost always a disaster . Rwanda , Bosnia , Somalia , Afghanistan , Ethiopia , Kurdistan , Cambodia , Vietnam -- whenever catastrophe strikes , wherever refugees flee across borders and crowd into camps , wherever hapless civilians are starving , dying by the roadside from cholera , mutilated by land_mines , Durant is sure to show_up . When calamity calls , he puts_in for vacation time , dons his lucky Red Sox baseball_cap and heads_off to volunteer his clinical skills , his infectious humor and his steely immunity to despair built_up during three decades of a unique problem practice around the globe . House calls_on the homeless and the helpless are his prescription for anesthetizing &quot; the Mickey_Mouse of medical bureaucracy. &quot; Whether in a dusty tent hospital on the border of Cambodia or Rwanda or in the antiseptic tiled corridors of the Massachusetts General Hospital , where he is assistant director , this stocky , nearly bald medical missionary would never be mistaken for Dr. Albert Schweitzer . And his M-A-S-H-type humor and blunt vocabulary would surely startle the newest of Mother Teresa ' s novices , as it sometimes does to veteran nurses and high-tech lab types . Doc Durant , as he is usually called , except in Vietnam where he gloried in the title of &quot; Tommy Tongue_Depressor , &quot; looks and often sounds like a battle-scarred , overage rugby player , which at 66 he still is , to the consternation of his wife Fredericka . A founding member of the Beacon_Hill Rugby Club , he still competes in the dinosaur division , for players over age 35 . &quot; I ' m a hooker , &quot; Doc grinningly confessed over coffee and bagels in his office at Massachusetts General . &quot; The hooker is the guy in the middle who hooks the ball out of the scrum , the huddle , while everyone piles on . So in refugee situations you ' re used to being buried under burdens of chaos. &quot; The office is decorated with photographs he has taken of rice_paddies in Cambodia , a sampan on the Mekong_River in Southeast_Asia , sunrise in Somalia , wood fires front-lighting a smoldering volcano in Rwanda , a stone bridge recently blown away from the Bosnian landscape . Also there ' s a rugby poster from the world championship at Twickenham , England , a helmet liner &quot; liberated from an Iraqi militiaman &quot; and some literature not found in your average doctor ' s office : a pamphlet on putting the pieces together in Northern_Ireland , a treatise on the proliferation of anti-personnel mines around the world , the annual report of the American Refugee Committee , under whose auspices he has treated the forsaken on three continents over the past 15 years . Comparing the catastrophes he has witnessed is a grim compilation of mankind ' s inexhaustible inhumanity . &quot; Afghanistan had the most refugees , over 5 million , &quot; he begins . &quot; Many had been maimed by the millions of land_mines planted by the Soviets . Their planes dropped butterfly bombs , disguised as copies of the Koran , which kids often picked_up . &quot; Kurdistan produced nearly a_million refugees . Cambodia has just repatriated the last of its refugees . One Thai border camp became the second-largest Cambodian city. &quot; Durant has made 14 trips to Cambodia since House Speaker Thomas ( Tip ) O ' Neill dispatched him in 1979 to assess the refugee situation . &quot; Our plane was one of the first to land in Phnom Penh after Pol Pot took_over , &quot; Durant said . &quot; The city once had a war-swollen population of 2 million , but there was no one around . We saw about 1 # 000 Vietnamese soldiers , a total of two trucks and eight Russian limos carrying government officials , but no more_than 20 Cambodians . An empty city , ghostly silent. &quot; In those crowded camps over the next decade the silence was broken by &quot; harrowing stories we kept hearing about the killing fields . The horror continues . Land_mines planted years ago claim 1 # 000 new victims a month : farmers digging their fields , kids bringing the cattle home . One out of every 230 Cambodians is an amputee. &quot; Somalia he regards_as &quot; by far the most dangerous . Shortly after we left in January four Indian doctors were killed at the hospital . There is more random gunfire than any place in the world . Your rented four-wheel drive comes equipped with a 15-year-old on the roof with a . 30-caliber machine_gun and a 12-year-old in the back cradling an AK-47 . You realize their job is to protect the vehicle , not you . &quot; Thousands starved to death every day in a schizophrenic nightmare where a mile away there was a market with fresh vegetables and camel meat . But the people had no money . Sooner or later all refugee situations deteriorate . The guys with the guns get a disproportionate share of the food and try to make a buck while the very young and the very elderly die . Most of the gunmen were spaced out on chat , a mind-bending drug flown in daily from the slopes of Mount Kenya because it must be chewed fresh. &quot; Bosnia , Durant says , &quot; was a completely different ballgame . Refugees in business_suits and sports jackets who had lost everything : home , family , workplace . We scavenged for usable medical supplies in the ruins of seven hospitals blown away by the former Yugoslav Army . In Somalia , the deaths were the result of chaotic indifference . In Bosnia , they were premeditated and genocidal. &quot; But of all his experiences , &quot; nothing matched the horror and magnitude of Rwanda . The number of dead in a short time was greater than any other place : 60 # 000 to 70 # 000 from cholera alone . At Goma , across the border in Zaire , corpses lined one side of the road , market stalls the other . &quot; If you were lucky enough to have a family , you got wrapped in a burial cloth . Otherwise , if you were off fetching water or firewood , you just died where you collapsed from massive dehydration . You can lose one-third of your body_weight in two days to cholera ' s devastating diarrhea. &quot; In Goma , Durant witnessed his &quot; first murder . I saw a thief hacked to death in 15 seconds in the marketplace by four strokes of a merchant ' s panga , the African machete . The first cut his scalp off , then two ripped apart his chest and the last was to the neck. &quot; Far from Massachusetts General ' s computerized scanners and the latest laser technology , the Boston physician often finds himself practicing the most primitive brand of preventive_medicine . &quot; Even in the grimmest situation , &quot; he insists , &quot; there is always something worth doing. &quot; Four retired firemen from San Francisco and one from San Diego saved more lives in Goma than all_the doctors put_together , he says . &quot; They loaded two pumper trucks onto a C-5 cargo plane , put their hoses into Lake Kivu , after clearing the corpses away from the intake , and brought 300 # 000 gallons of fresh_water a day to the camp 10 miles away . Clean drinking_water was essential in replacing cholera ' s enormous body loss . &quot; If you can drink , you can save yourself . Our own niche was organizing outreach teams to bring a replacement solution of sugar , salt and water to people in the remote huts too weak to walk to the clinic . In two weeks we inoculated 100 # 000 kids against measles , polio and tetanus , 10 # 000 of them were unaccompanied minors whose parents had died in that terrible tribal slaughter. &quot; Durant , who has taught at Harvard , Tufts and Boston University medical_schools , helped launch a massive 10-year training_program in Cambodia . All the native doctors had been killed by -- or had fled from -- the Khmer Rouge who , in their zeal to eliminate the educated elite , targeted for death anyone wearing eyeglasses . Young refugees with no formal education were trained in the camps to give inoculations , run tuberculosis clinics , instruct midwives , even perform surgery and amputations on those mutilated by land_mines . Even Durant ' s carefully controlled demeanor of &quot; detached involvement &quot; was stretched to the breaking point one afternoon in Somalia . &quot; We try not to eat_in the camps because they have so little , &quot; he said . &quot; I was sitting in the cab of a truck with two small bananas . I stripped one and threw the peel out the window . A little kid picked it up and wolfed it down . Obviously , he got the other banana . It blew me away for the rest of the day. &quot; The idea of becoming a doctor came_to Durant when as a young soldier on occupation duty in Korea just after World_War_II he saw thousands of homeless , emaciated children foraging for food in trash_cans . After graduating from Georgetown medical_school and doing his residency at Boston ' s City Hospital , he hung his shingle in the Dorchester neighborhood where he was born and still_lives in a 100-year-old house . &quot; The practice consisted mostly of relatives , medical_students from City Hospital and some black patients , &quot; he recalled . &quot; It wasn ' t very lucrative but it was lots of fun. &quot; He went_to Vietnam in July , 1966 , and for two years was Saigon ' s public health adviser . Durant ' s office in the ornate old city_hall built by the_French backed_up on the mayor ' s . The mayor was a Vietnamese physician and also a neurotic alcoholic who rolled a grenade around on his desk and kept threatening to blow away his problems . One day after a long wet lunch , the mayor unholstered his pistol and proceeded to shoot the numbers off on the clock hanging_on his side of their mutual wall . This writer first met Durant in a Catholic cemetery on the far side of the &quot; Y &quot; bridge_over the Saigon River . Hundreds of refugee families were living under tarpaulins and scraps of parachute cloth hung between the gravestones . At a clinic under an awning stretched between the outspread wings of a stone guardian_angel , Durant was clowning and laughing with the bedraggled urchins lining_up to be examined . He fitted his Red Sox cap on one bawling moppet and allowed another to tune_in on his stethoscope . &quot; Tommy Tongue_Depressor demonstrates his tomb-side manner , &quot; joked his pal Mike McGrath , a burly ex-Marine from Boston who had come_back to Vietnam with the U.S. aid program . The name stuck . So did Durant ' s enthusiasm for disaster calls . Durant has always been too busy to play with what he laughingly dismisses as &quot; doctor ' s toys. &quot; He has never belonged_to a country_club , owned a yacht or gone_on a safari . He counts his rewards in the &quot; incredible people you get_to work with , real pros who can keep things in perspective and never lose their sense of humor. &quot; For the last five years Durant has been battling prostate cancer with a bravura toughened by tackling the roughest rugby opponents . &quot; Running_off to those terrible places is what keeps him going , &quot; said wife Fredericka .</TEXT>
