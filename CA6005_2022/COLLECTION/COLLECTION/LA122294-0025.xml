   <TEXT> I am a former citizen and lawyer from Argentina . I am now a very proud 83-year-old citizen of the United States . I was very pleased and excited about President Clinton ' s visionary summit to create a new free-trade &quot; Partnership for Prosperity &quot; among all_the nations of our continent . Clearly , the greatest accomplishment of the United States in promoting human_rights , education , health , development and jobs for all people of the hemisphere would be to erase the suspicion and mistrust instilled in the soul of Latin_America by the former policies of our government . The hand of the United States outstretched to Latin_America in such a partnership will cement peace , hope and a new friendship among all_of us . This new environment of prosperity and cooperation is truly welcomed by me , particularly since I have worked toward this aim for more_than half a century . I want to especially thank President Clinton for remembering in his opening speech of the summit all_of the courageous and innocent people who were tortured and killed by the military dictators who ruled several countries of the Latin continent for so_long .
