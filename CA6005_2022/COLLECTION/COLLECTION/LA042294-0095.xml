Wrote Ray Frager of the Baltimore Sun : &quot; Medals will be awarded in gold , silver and plaster. &quot; Trivia time : What pitcher lost the most games in the major_leagues last season ? The Expendable One ? Wrote Kevin Paul Dupont of the Boston Globe : &quot; Doesn ' t it make all_the sense in Wayne ' s World for the Kings to trade Wayne Gretzky ? For starters , they could dump his $ 8-million salary and still get a_couple_of good players and probably some draft picks . . . . &quot; Right now , the Kings are dead in the water , proof that 1992-93 was a mirage . Dealing Gretzky could be their only way to keep fans happy in the long run. &quot; Whole lotta love : In a complete-the-sentence interview with Sun magazine , Pete Sampras said the rock_band he most wished he had been in was Led Zeppelin .

It ' s a start : Asked to assess the play of Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan , who played a round_of_golf recently at White Cliffs Country_Club in Plymouth , Mass. , pro Mark Buell told the Boston Globe , &quot; She hit it every time she swung at the ball. &quot; Head-turner : Said right_fielder Jim Eisenreich of the Philadelphia Phillies after the Dodgers ' Mike Piazza hit a three-run home_run Monday night with an awkward , one-handed swing : &quot; I couldn ' t believe he hit it that far with that swing . At first , I thought it would be foul , but it had a backspin and still went a good 10 feet past the fence . He ' s incredibly strong. &quot; Bad boy wanna-be : Michael Moorer , who will fight Evander Holyfield for the heavyweight championship tonight , said he would have been good for the Detroit Pistons . &quot; I can knock guys out on the court as well as I can in the ring , &quot; he said . Trivia answer : Scott Erickson of the Minnesota Twins , who was 8-19 . Quotebook : Dan Wilkinson , a defensive tackle who is expected to be among the top picks in Sunday ' s NFL draft after giving_up his final two seasons of eligibility at Ohio State : &quot; When you ' re a kid growing_up , you don ' t dream about school , you dream about playing in the National Football League. &quot; JERRY CROWE</TEXT>
