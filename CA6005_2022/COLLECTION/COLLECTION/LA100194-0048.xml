   <HEADLINE> A FRIGHTFUL DISEASE IS BANISHED ; THANKS TO DRS . SALK AND SABIN , POLIO IS NO LONGER A THREAT IN THE WESTERN_HEMISPHERE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Only older Americans are now able to recall the chilling fear once raised in all families , especially those with younger children , by the viral infection that science knew as poliomyelitis and that lay persons commonly called infantile_paralysis . In its severest form the virus attacked the nervous_system , producing death or paralysis . Sometimes its victims were doomed to a permanent immobile existence encased within a life-support system known as the iron_lung . Its most famous victim , Franklin D . Roosevelt , who contracted the disease at the age of 39 , proved that it was possible to overcome or at least compensate for some of polio ' s worst consequences . Roosevelt ' s determination and success -- he was elected to the first of his four terms as President 11 years after being stricken with polio -- gave hope to millions . But two remarkable American medical researchers gave more_than hope . By developing vaccines to prevent polio , they provided the means to eradicate the disease and in so doing lift the terror that it inspired . In 1954 , Dr. Jonas Salk of the University of Pittsburgh found that polio viruses killed by formaldehyde were still able to produce immune_reactions when injected into the body . From that discovery came the Salk vaccine . Five years later , Dr. Albert Sabin at the University of Cincinnati developed a live-virus vaccine for immunization against polio . Since 1961 , this has been the vaccine of choice used throughout the world . Because of it , millions have been spared from infection . The World_Health_Organization has now declared the Western_Hemisphere to be free from polio , the last known case having occurred three years ago in a village in Peru . About 750 million people in the Americas can thus be considered as safe from one of history ' s most feared diseases . Credit is given to a regionwide immunization campaign launched in 1985 . The threat of polio elsewhere in the world , while vastly diminished , has not wholly disappeared . Public-health officials hope the aggressive campaign waged in the Western_Hemisphere can be emulated so that the 120 # 000 cases that still occur annually in the world ' s poorer regions can be eliminated . Meanwhile , what has happened in the Americas must be hailed with the gratitude that such an accomplishment commands . The Charter of the United Nations speaks_of saving future generations from the scourge of war . The achievement of Drs . Salk and Sabin was nothing less than to spare future generations from the scourge of a frightful disease .</TEXT>
