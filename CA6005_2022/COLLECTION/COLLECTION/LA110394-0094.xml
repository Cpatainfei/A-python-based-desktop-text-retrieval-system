   <HEADLINE> KITCHEN MATRIARCHS ; THE UNSINKABLE MADAME WU</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Rolls Royce Silver Cloud rolls silently to the curb at Drago Restaurant . Madame Wu , looking regal in an upswept hairdo and Emanuelle Kahn glasses , opens the door and steps_out , ignoring the proffered hand of the valet . This is one woman who needs no help from anyone . For a woman who owns a city_block of prime Santa Monica property and is a legend among restaurateurs in a town where restaurants die faster than the latest diet fad , Sylvia Wu amazes even herself . &quot; I don ' t know where I got my ambition , &quot; she says . &quot; As a Chinese woman I wasn ' t supposed to know anything about business . My husband didn ' t think I could run a restaurant by myself . He still doesn ' t , but I knew I could and did. &quot; Wu , like her husband King Yan Wu , was born into a wealthy , political family in the early part of the century . When the Japanese invaded China , Wu ' s family fled to Hong Kong , where she befriended the first_lady of China , Mme . Sun Yat-Sen , whose style and presence has been an inspiration to Wu throughout her life . King Yan Wu ' s father was ambassador to the United States in the 1920s . * &quot; During my 12 years as a housewife in New York , I didn ' t know how to cook , &quot; Wu says . &quot; I am thankful that my husband ' s mother sent us a cook . that ' s how I was able to show my restaurant cook how to prepare certain dishes. &quot; The restaurant started_out with so-called Chinese dishes , some she had never heard of in China . &quot; I never heard of egg foo yung and pressed duck , but that ' s what was being served in Chinese restaurants in those days , &quot; she says . &quot; Now we don ' t serve any of those dishes. &quot; Wu ' s ability to adapt quickly to change was probably what saved her restaurant from extinction . When the Pritikin Diet made a big splash , Wu came_up with a &quot; Long-Life Diet &quot; ( a name suggested by former Los Angeles Times restaurant critic Lois Dwan ) imitating Pritikin ' s low-fat , low-salt , low-cholesterol restrictions . The Peking duck served at Madame Wu ' s Garden has no fat on the crisp skin . &quot; In China , people like the fatty skin , but not here . We fan the duck dry and let the fat completely drain off. &quot; * She acted_on her customers ' needs and dietary requirements with dispatch . &quot; Lawrence Welk wanted whole steamed duck and vegetables , so that ' s what we served him , &quot; she says . Cary Grant came_into the restaurant one day raving about a chicken_salad he had at a restaurant on La Cienega and asked why Wu didn ' t try something like it herself . Wu , remembering a Chinese banquet dish made with chicken , won tons and puffy noodles , came_up with a Chinese chicken_salad that has been copied by restaurants from here to New York City . Wu has operated her restaurant since 1959 -- in two successive locations . She started_out where Drago is now , but moved a_few years later to the grand , 12 # 000-square-foot exemplar of stylized Asian postmodern architecture , designed by architect Guy Moore , on 22nd Street in Santa Monica . She thinks she may be ready to let_go , but not just yet . Who can give_up a celebrity hangout where Cary Grant , Jimmy Doolittle , Robert Redford and Jane Fonda were at_home ? The memories ! And the dishes : Terrific Peking duck that is still served to visiting dignitaries ; wonderful crab puffs that melt in your mouth ; shrimp toast and Wu ' s beef ( a version of orange beef without the orange ) . Besides , Wu refuses to stop working . She is a powerful presence at her restaurant , flitting from table to table , making small_talk , checking the kitchen ( although she throws_up her hands at times ) , listening to requests and making suggestions with patience . Her energy , enthusiasm and positive outlook haven ' t waned an iota . * She loves being with her children and grandchildren and insists on regular Tuesday family dinners at her restaurant . On Sundays , her second son , George , a judge , does the cooking . &quot; I love young people , &quot; she says and wishes she would see more of them at her restaurant . ( Friday ' s &quot; crime night , &quot; in which diners solve a mystery during dinner , is an effort to attract a young crowd that she keeps going no matter what. ) But she ' s happy . &quot; I ' m at_peace . I love my life and I think I have accomplished something . My name is known wherever I go. &quot; Wu is also well known for her philanthropy , having endowed a scholarship foundation at Marymount High_School in her late daughter ' s name , as a Music Center patron for years and having given numerous dinners at her restaurant for charities . &quot; You know something , &quot; she says . &quot; Years ago , I sold this restaurant ( now the Drago location ) to a French couple for $ 15 # 000 &quot; . . . &quot; $ 15 # 000 , &quot; she repeats , as if she herself can ' t fathom it . &quot; You know how much they sold it for ? $ 300 # 000. &quot; Regrets ? &quot; Oh , no , not really . Everything is meant to be , &quot; she says .
