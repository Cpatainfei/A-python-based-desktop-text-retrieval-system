It ' s so bad. &quot; Roseanne also dishes on actress Denny Dillon , who portrays her in the Fox film , and adds that &quot; I wish they ' d wait till I die before they do these kinds of things. &quot; * KCBS News Director : Roger Perret , a producer at KCAL-TV Channel 9 , was named news director at KCBS-TV Channel 2 on Thursday . He replaces Robert Jordan , who resigned last month . Perret had been at KCAL since 1989 ; he previously was assistant news director at KNBC-TV Channel 4 . KCBS has trailed its rivals at KNBC and KABC-TV Channel 7 in the local news ratings for many years , but Perret said , &quot; This station is a sleeping giant about to awaken. &quot; THE ARTS Protecting Artists ' Rights : In a potentially precedent-setting first test of a national law protecting artists ' rights , a federal judge has prohibited the removal of a football field-sized sculpture from a New York office_building . U.S. District Judge David Edelstein ruled that the installation is protected under the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 . Edelstein is the first judge to issue a permanent injunction under the law , which gives artists the right to prevent the &quot; intentional distortion , mutilation or other modification &quot; of their works that would be &quot; prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation. &quot; The building ' s owner had sought to remove the installation by artists John Swing , John Veronis and John Carter ( known as the &quot; Three-J ' s &quot; ) , but the judge ruled that the removal would destroy certain elements of the work . However , Edelstein denied the artists ' request to finish the piece , which has been a work_in_progress since 1991 . The ecologically themed installation uses recycled materials and includes giant mosaics on the floor and sculptural elements including a mythological god , a huge silver fish and an astronaut with a trash-can head . MOVIES Venice Fest Begins : The Venice Film Festival opened Thursday with a dispute over a celebrity judge threatening to steal the limelight from Oliver Stone , whose &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; is favored to win the Golden Lion Award . The buildup to the 51st edition of Italy ' s premier film festival turned bitter when an organizer accused Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa of being too right_wing to sit on the star-studded judges panel , which includes actress Uma Thurman and director David Lynch . However , the festival ' s head , filmmaker Gillo Pentecorvo , defended Vargas Llosa as a man of culture ideally suited for the job . Meanwhile , the judges have their jobs cut_out for them : Italian Gianni Amelio ' s low-budget &quot; L ' america &quot; ( America ) , a moving tale of an Italian con_man who tries to get rich by opening a shoe factory in post-communist Albania , is seen as Stone ' s chief challenger for the Golden Lion . * Zeffirelli Sues Magazine : Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli has sued the London-based movie magazine Screen International for libel for calling him a fascist member of the Italian Parliament . Zeffirelli is a senator representing Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi ' s Forza Italia ( Go , Italy ) Party , which rules_in coalition with the neo-fascist National Alliance and the federalist Northern League . Zeffirelli ' s attorney called the allegation &quot; totally inaccurate &quot; and &quot; highly damaging to Franco Zeffirelli ' s international reputation. &quot; The magazine is aimed at senior personnel within the worldwide entertainment_industry .
