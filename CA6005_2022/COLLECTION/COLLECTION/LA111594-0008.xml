   <HEADLINE> BOSNIAN ARMS : IT ' S NOW A KILLER QUESTION ; THE SO-CALLED MERE ' CIVIL WAR ' THAT NOW THREATENS THE WESTERN ALLIANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Relations between the United States and its NATO allies , particularly the_British , have become progressively more strained over Bosnia in recent months . But a critical_point may have been reached last Saturday when the Clinton_Administration terminated U.S. participation in the enforcement of a U.N.-imposed Bosnian arms embargo . President Clinton ' s action has little to do with generally tense relations between Prime_Minister John Major ' s Tory government and his own Democratic Administration . While it is true that Tories usually get_on better with Republicans than with Democrats ( Tory Margaret Thatcher and Republican Ronald Reagan got_on famously ) , Bosnia is creating an exception to that rule . For the Clinton_Administration ' s Bosnia policy , however clearly at_odds with British policy , differs less than the policy that will be pursued by the incoming Republican majority in Congress . The point most at_issue is the arms embargo imposed by the United Nations on all_of the former Yugoslavia . Because Serbs dominated the former federation and , in particular , controlled its military , they retained control of the federation ' s arsenal , and the blanket embargo has had a grossly uneven effect , favoring Serb aggression and retarding Bosnian defense . Congressional Republicans are determined to go beyond non-enforcement to a unilateral U.S. breach of the embargo , claiming that only when Bosnia has armed for its self-defense can further Serb aggression be deterred . They may well attempt to force Clinton ' s hand with binding legislation . America ' s NATO allies want the embargo maintained , claiming that peace can best be reached by ratifying most of the early Serb conquests and , in any event , by preventing arms from being shipped to any of the warring parties . Congress ' view that Serb aggression must be halted by the stick rather than the carrot is , in our judgment , the more realistic path to peace , but realism has also seemed to dictate that the United States not pursue a European policy in defiance of Britain , France and even Germany , ( not to speak_of Russia , which with the four main NATO powers has formed a &quot; Contact Group &quot; vainly attempting to piece together a common Balkans policy ) . The Clinton_Administration faces a dilemma that probably cannot be resolved unless the U.N. Security_Council itself chooses to lift the embargo . The Europeans will resist any U.S. attempt to persuade the council to take this step , and a Russian veto is likely if less than certain . Still , facing a hawkish Republican majority in Congress , the Administration would be_well advised to try harder than it has hitherto to find the Security_Council votes it needs . If it fails to find them , it is just possible that the embargo dispute may herald a phase-out of NATO itself as a factor_in European security . The NATO allies have placed themselves in a lose-lose position as regards the preservation of the alliance . If , on the one hand , they force the United States to back_down and to help them maintain the embargo , the Americans , particularly the Republicans , will infer that NATO lacks the will to confront Russia on anything smaller than a life-or-death issue . And since , on such an issue , Europe is_well able to defend itself without American help , NATO will be seen to have outlived its usefulness . If , on the other hand , the Clinton_Administration refuses to back_down and , under congressional pressure , breaks the embargo unilaterally , the rupture in NATO will only come quicker . Will the United States sacrifice NATO to its Bosnia policy ? Or will the NATO allies sacrifice NATO to theirs ? Who needs NATO more ? Intransigence on both sides , helped along by a Russian veto in the Security_Council , may yet succeed in fragmenting an alliance that held_up through all_the strains of the Cold_War , a remarkable consequence of what some persist_in calling a mere civil_war .</TEXT>
