   <HEADLINE> POLITICAL BRIEFING : WRIGHT BREAKS WITH TRADITION IN GIVING DOUBLE ENDORSEMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> for whatever it ' s worth -- to only a single candidate in a race . State Sen . Cathie Wright ( R-Simi Valley ) , who is herself running_for lieutenant_governor , clearly did not feel bound by such constraints in a recent Republican primary campaign . Last summer , Wright endorsed Richard Sybert , a Calabasas resident and former senior aide to Gov . Pete Wilson , in the 24th Congressional District contest to nominate an opponent to Rep . Anthony C . Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills ) . Sybert used Wright ' s support to help establish his initial bona fides . &quot; Rich came_to me before he even formally announced , &quot; Wright recalled this week . &quot; I thought he was_well qualified. &quot; And , she said , it helped that he was willing to commit substantial personal funds to his campaign . Then , two weeks before the June 7 primary , Wright received a call from Newbury Park businessman Sang Korman , who Wright had endorsed in the 1992 GOP contest in the same district . Korman , who filed to run months after Sybert , had done no active campaigning to that point . &quot; I really admire him for the reason that he came_to this country without a dime in his pocket , &quot; Wright said of Korman ' s immigrant tale . &quot; He feels he was successful because of this country and he wanted to give something back. &quot; So , even though she felt that Korman &quot; didn ' t have a chance , &quot; Wright agreed to endorse him as well . Korman capitalized by sending a letter to voters during the last week of the campaign touting Wright ' s fulsome praise : &quot; I am convinced Sang Korman will become a great congressman for the 24th Congressional District . I am delighted to endorse Sang Korman for Congress and urge you to vote him. &quot; And what if some voters felt misled by Wright ' s unconventional multiple endorsement ? &quot; They could , &quot; Wright acknowledged . &quot; But you have to understand you have some loyalty. &quot; Sybert , who won the primary with 47 % of the vote , said he learned of Wright ' s endorsement of Korman when he saw his opponent ' s mailing . Still , he sought to be philosophical . &quot; I thought it was a little odd , &quot; he said . &quot; But that ' s her choice. &quot; * STEALTH CAMPAIGN : Korman , the Korean-American businessman and Newbury Park resident who has run_for the Republican nomination for Congress four times since 1988 , was traveling in Asia on business throughout much of the primary campaign . But he returned shortly before the election and decided to wage a last-minute , low-key campaign . Korman , who had previously spent more_than $ 750 # 000 of_his_own money on his unsuccessful campaigns , sent_out five pieces of mail to Republican voters in the 24th District . He did no fund-raising or door-to-door campaigning , made no public appearances and gave no interviews . He won 5 # 981 votes , or 15.5 % , and finished third in a five-person field . He won 13 # 884 votes , or 23.7 % , and placed second among nine candidates after campaigning vigorously in 1992 . Bob Lavoie , Korman ' s friend and former campaign manager , decided shortly before the election to attempt to capitalize on his residual name recognition . &quot; He thought he was going_to have an impact , &quot; said Lavoie , who did the mailings . &quot; I thought he ' d do_better than that. &quot; Korman left for Korea after the primary and could not be reached . Asked whether this would be Korman ' s final congressional bid , Lavoie replied , &quot; I hope so. &quot; * ENDORSEMENT ABSENCE : Vanquished primary candidates usually fall_into line behind their party ' s nominee , putting aside the rhetorical slings and arrows of the prceding campaign . This is not so with the runner-up to Richard Sybert in the Republican contest in the highly competitive 24th District congressional race . Robert K . Hammer , a Newbury Park investment_banker and first-time candidate , pointedly vowed to withhold his backing . He won 17 % of the vote . Hammer had questioned his opponent ' s commitment to the area that he seeks to represent because Sybert moved_into the district last fall to run there . Sybert , who grew_up in Southern California , in turn , cited Hammer ' s failure to vote_in a number of elections . The two locked horns on other issues as well . &quot; While I will give the_devil his due and the 15 minutes of fame he will demand , the man fresh from Sacramento will receive no endorsement from this camp ; nor , given the way that campaign was run , can he legitimately expect one , &quot; Hammer said in a note to this reporter . Not surprisingly , Sybert did not see things quite the same way . &quot; that ' s obviously just sour grapes , &quot; Sybert said . &quot; I ' m sorry he feels that way . That is not proper behavior and I hope , after he calms_down , that he will come_to the same conclusion. &quot; * ISRAEL OVERSIGHT : Rep . Howard P . ( Buck ) McKeon ( R-Santa Clarita ) says he was surprised last week when news accounts of his annual financial disclosure report failed to mention a trip to Israel that he took with his wife last August . It turned_out that the House clerk ' s office had neglected to include an amendment McKeon made to his initial report correcting the inadvertent omission of the trip . &quot; It was just an oversight , &quot; said Janice Glossen , senior reports examiner in the clerk ' s office of records and registration . &quot; The report should have been part of the public record. &quot; McKeon made the one-week , introductory trip to Israel , his first , as part of a 14-member freshmen group that was sponsored by the American Israel Education Foundation , an arm of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .</TEXT>
