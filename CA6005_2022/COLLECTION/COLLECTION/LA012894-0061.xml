   <HEADLINE> MARTIN KOSLECK ; ACTOR RECOGNIZED FOR NAZI ROLES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Martin Kosleck , the German-born film character_actor who portrayed dozens of Nazis everyone loved to hate , but who said he never had the questionable honor of meeting one , is dead . Christopher Drake , a longtime friend , said Kosleck , known for his icy demeanor and wicked eyes , was 89 when he died Jan . 16 in a Santa Monica convalescent home . He had undergone abdominal surgery a week earlier . For years before and after World_War_II , Kosleck epitomized the Nazi menace for millions of American moviegoers . He played SS troopers , concentration_camp officers and mean-spirited German soldiers , all consumed with blind obedience to Adolf Hitler . He portrayed Joseph Goebbels , Hitler ' s propaganda minister , five times . Kosleck was born in Barkotzen , Pomerania , now Germany . His German-Russian family traced its heritage to the 13th Century . He was 10 when he left his small village to study acting with Max Reinhardt in Berlin . He later went_to Hollywood where he perfected his English and dined with such old Berlin friends as Marlene Dietrich . He also was an accomplished portrait artist and managed to support himself with his art while waiting for a break_in movies . According to author Richard Lamparski , in one of his &quot; Whatever Became of . . . ? &quot; anthologies , Kosleck was finally discovered not in films but on the New York stage , where director Anatole Litvak saw him in &quot; The Merchant of Venice &quot; and cast him in a film that foretold things to come for his career : &quot; Confessions of a Nazi Spy &quot; in 1939 . It was his first link with Goebbels . For the next decade he was the evil spy , double_agent or Gestapo despot in &quot; Underground , &quot; &quot; All Through the Night , &quot; &quot; Chetniks , &quot; &quot; Berlin Correspondent , &quot; &quot; The Hitler Gang &quot; and other films . His piercing stare made him a natural for other psychopaths in &quot; The Mad Doctor , &quot; &quot; She Wolf of London &quot; and &quot; The Frozen Ghost. &quot; During an interview with Lamparski , Kosleck said he had never met Goebbels . In fact , he said , &quot; I ' ve never spoken with a Nazi in my life . . . . The fools were all_over the streets of Berlin when I left in 1931 . No one I knew took them seriously. &quot; His last performance was a small part in &quot; The Man With Bogart ' s Face &quot; in 1980 . He was married to the actress Eleonora von Mendelssohn , who died several years ago . There are no immediate survivors , Drake said .</TEXT>
