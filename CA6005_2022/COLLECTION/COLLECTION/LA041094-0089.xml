   <HEADLINE> SECRET BEACHES ; AUSTRALIA ; FRASER ISLAND : 200 MILES OF PERFECT SAND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It seems ironic that in Australia , a land outlined by endless golden beaches and filled_in almost entirely with uninterrupted barren dirt , the tourist bureau would find it necessary to advertise sand . Yet that is exactly what they ' re up_to with Fraser Island : a 100-mile sliver off Australia ' s as-of-now unspoiled Queensland coastline . With a Barnum-like zeal , Fraser ( as the locals simply call it ) is billed as the &quot; largest sand island in the world. &quot; A truthful proclamation , yet one that also should be taken with , well , a grain of sand , considering that sand is only one chapter of the tale . The Aussies , after all , are something of an ironic folk . Most were in convict shackles when they first laid eyes on their new home . Not that this inconvenience restricted the settlers ' curiosity in any way . It ' s said that when the unwilling immigrants first encountered the indigenous population , they immediately asked_in their best Queen ' s English what those large brown animals were that they ' d seen bouncing all_over the place . The answer they received was perhaps the last one ever taken at face_value in Australia : &quot; Kangaroo , &quot; said the natives , an Aboriginal term meaning , &quot; I don ' t know what you ' re saying to me. &quot; It is no surprise , then , that a visitor today first places a footprint in the 200 miles of Fraser ' s sandy coastline with a sense of uncertain wonder . Given the jungle-like rain_forests of its interior , the giant freshwater lakes , the magnificent sculptured cliffs , the myriad of brightly colored birds , the Willy Wonka-esque wildlife ( brumbies , dingoes , echidnas , wallabies , dugongs ) and the conflicting variety of plant communities ranging from low heathlands to tall closed forests , the sand can become a simple afterthought shaken out of a shoe at day ' s end . Unless , of course , one were to allow a little time between visits . Then , the true power of the sand would satisfy even the strictest truth-in-advertising commissions . For Fraser , one soon learns , is in a constant state of flux . The same sand that first created the island more_than 100 million years ago , is today still burying forests , molding new freshwater lakes , altering the 75 miles of unsullied coastline and thrusting sand mountains , seemingly overnight , 800 feet into the southern sky . Geographically , Fraser is the perfect middle ground between the urban civility of Brisbane , about 180 miles to the south , and the magnificent grandeur of the Great Barrier_Reef , which begins just to its north . Yet of these three diverse points of interest , Fraser clearly would run a distant third in a name-recognition contest -- so distant , in fact , that it took the luxury of an extended &quot; see everything &quot; honeymoon to steer my wife and me away from the majestic reef and toward the rather dubious promise of sand . Yet its relative anonymity is bound to be short lived . Conde Nast Traveler has named it one of the 10 best beaches in Australia . And thanks largely to the world ' s ardent naturalists -- who won a bitter battle against Fraser ' s zealous sand miners in the 1970s -- the island has been selected Australia ' s next contribution to UNESCO ' s World Heritage List . This decree places it on a global par with 300 or so other sites including the Serengeti , the Great Barrier_Reef and the Grand_Canyon , as an area to be preserved in its natural_state for all time -- though try telling the sand about preserving natural_states . When Capt . James Cook first spotted the island in 1770 , he thought the huge volcanic outcrop , dotted with hundreds of Aboriginal fires , was actually a headland . He called it &quot; Indian Head &quot; without ever coming ashore . . . and then , in true explorer fashion , quickly moved_on , looking_for other places to name . It took 50 years for this mistake to be corrected -- and the corrector , it turns_out , would wish he had never bothered . After carefully circumnavigating the island -- with the Pacific on its east , and the Great Sandy Strait on its west -- the Scottish sea_captain James Fraser and his wife , Eliza , promptly wrecked their ship on the island ' s resilient shores . Some of the group perished , but others , including the newly-widowed Eliza , survived with Aboriginal help . In fact , following her rescue from the island , Eliza would go_on to make something of a career for herself retelling of the marooning and of her life in the hands of her protective &quot; savages. &quot; The Aborigines , for their part , met with a fate typical of colonized people who suddenly find themselves at the center of newly formed economic equations : Timber cutters ran them off the island . Just a 10-minute ferry ride_off Australia ' s east coast , Fraser is today a far more accessible place than it was for Eliza . Thanks to an abundance of ferries , tour buses and four-wheel-drive rental companies , there are now basically three ways to see the island : a one-day , three-day or on-your-own tour . The first requires curiosity ; the second , stamina ; the third , money . The one- and the three-day excursions generally begin at the many campgrounds , hostels and backpacker hotels of Hervey Bay , the Queensland town from which ferries depart regularly for Fraser Island . Though launches do leave from the more distant Rainbow Beach and Maryborough , Hervey Bay is the nearest and most accessible avenue to Fraser . This curious mainland town , with an anachronistic row of World_War_II cannons still lining its streets , seems to almost physically lean toward the fruitful island . It ' s as if the overly solicitous people who make_up its population feel they need to be as near to their fiscal lifeblood as possible . Perhaps this explains the cannons . The most important thing to know about the one-day tour is that while you ' ll see a lot , you will experience little . As with most physically challenging and diverse landscapes , it is difficult to get a true sense of place when one is constantly being herded in and out of labor-saving , time-efficient , air-conditioned buses . Finances and time constraints , however , often make this the only realistic option . Thus , in_order to get the most out of such a hit-and-run approach to the island , it is critical to secure the correct island guide . On Fraser , that means an infamous Australian bushman who goes_by the name of Bronco . Bronco , who knows just about everything there is to know about Fraser , takes special pride in the fact that he and his customized tour bus are made of roughly the same hulking steel alloy . With luck , or by booking a tour with Fraser Venture , you can find yourself in his harbor-like hands . The three-day tour is another animal altogether . Assembled by companies catering specifically to modern explorers , this tour loosens you to a guide-less , four-wheel-drive romp across the island . Unlike those on the schedule-keeping tour buses , you are steered only by your curiosity -- and the curiosity of the five others with whom you ' ll be driving . . . and sleeping . Yes , despite its economic manageability ( or because of it ) , this is the love-your-neighbor approach to touring ( and a litmus test for new marriages ) . With three strangers in a tent at night and six crammed into the vehicle during the day -- to say nothing of the Hervey Bay baloney you ' ll be living_off of for the next three days -- this can either be a magically unforgettable experience . . . or the longest 72 hours of your life . ( I quickly discovered that much of the enjoyment of four-wheeling depends_on whether you sit on the front of the vehicle , or whether you hold_on for dear life in the back. ) Despite the obvious demands that come_with the camping package , it is still by far the most popular among Fraser Island visitors . Certainly , sleeping under the stars -- as we did during a sweltering Down Under summer in December -- is the most natural way to fit into this rustic environment ; especially when one can stake out one ' s bedroom either on a wide-open inviting beach or in a forest roofed by such odd looking trees as the satinay , kauri_pine and blackbutt . The third , usually more expensive , pathway to Fraser involves a small assortment of on-island lodgments . Inventively named outposts such_as Dilli Village , Eurong Beach , Happy Valley , Orchid Beach and Kingfisher Bay are scattered about the island and provide accommodations to fit just about every need . This includes everything from the modest cabin to the &quot; environmentally sensitive &quot; resort that takes credit_cards and can do your laundry while you busy yourself at the pool , in the shops or even in the conference_center . Booking in_advance is often a must . No matter how long one winds_up staying_on Fraser , nature-based recreation will always be the key to experiencing the island . Surf , rock and estuary fishermen have been known to miss their return ferries following long encounters with bream , trevally and wahoo -- to name just a_few of the popular catches . Herein lies a mystery . As many of the lakes are created ( or perched ) high in the dunes above sea_level by trapped rainwater , scientists were for the longest_time baffled by the presence of freshwater_fish in these suspended reservoirs . The answer , after much head scratching and extended fish talk , was finally found , not in the lakes , but in the sky . The fish , like all shrewd travelers in this modern age , simply flew to the island . A stop at Fraser ' s geologically edifying Visitor ' s Center in Eurong resolves this mystery with an animated tale of mainland waterspouts and their rather surprised passengers . * Hikers who come_to Fraser soon find themselves confronted with that most enviable of dilemmas : which part of the island to explore first . In truth , energy levels often give_out before most agendas . Nevertheless , big-eyed visitors who don ' t get lost in the 3 # 000 acres of rain_forest usually attempt to take_in the following : Lake Bowaraddy , where if you clap your hands , tortoises pop their heads_up to see if you are going_to feed them ; Lake Wabby , which is slowly being engulfed by the Hammerstone sandblow ( guides encouraged us to slide_down the giant sand_dune and straight into the refreshing cool waters , though they said nothing about the energy-sapping walk back_out ) ; the Cathedrals , 15 miles of exposed , colored sand cliffs sculptured by the wind ; the Maheno and the Marloo , twisted wrecks testifying to the island ' s shallow offshore sandbars ; primitive Aboriginal sites , some restored to pre-settler conditions ; a manual lighthouse , one of the last in the world , and Eli Creek , a welcome picnic spot as it discharges over 1 million gallons of cool fresh_water onto the beach every hour . For naturalists and animal lovers , Fraser also proves to be both a wonder and a challenge . There are more birds here than in all_of the_British Isles , according to the Australia Tourist Commission . Yet in a fine touch of winged Australian irony , these same graceful creatures are all but forgotten in early August through October , when numerous giant humpback_whales arrive_at the temperate shores after having fled the icy waters of Antarctica . Though these salt water giants cannot generally be seen from shore , local operators arrange ocean tours for viewing . Not forgotten , but often missed by all but the earliest risers , is the spectacular mating ritual of the island ' s countless turtles , usually beginning in late November and lasting until the hatching in mid- to late January . Perhaps it was me , but I couldn ' t help feeling that these haughty little fellows actually seemed to perform better when they sensed they had an audience . On second thought , however , this type of behavior hardly seems unusual on an island that is home to the strangest of Australia ' s many strange animals . Here , after all , one can find the brumby , a Swiftian-looking horse descended from the mounts of the original British Army ; the dingo , that barkless , child-snatching dog of lore ; and the dugong , a sea_cow , of all things ( attention Gary Larson ) . There ' s also advertised pipi , wong and eugarie hunting -- though none in our tour could ever figure_out what those actually were or if we happened to catch any by mistake . Not that we left empty-handed . By the time our little &quot; stopover &quot; on the way north to the Great Barrier_Reef had ended , we had managed to come_away with another , more unexpected prize : Fraser Island , despite everything the brochure was trying to tell us , was thankfully much more_than just a whole_lot of sand .
