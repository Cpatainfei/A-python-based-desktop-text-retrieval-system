   <HEADLINE> A CALL IN THE NIGHT : SHE TOOK THEIR CHILD ; FAMILY : JON RAMIREZ ' S EX-WIFE BROUGHT DAUGHTER TO THE NETHERLANDS . SIMILAR CASES ARE INCREASINGLY COMMON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a Friday evening in July of last year , Jon M . Ramirez drove to the home of his ex-wife to pick_up their 2-year-old daughter for the weekend . But neither the girl nor her mother was there , and for 48 hours , a panicked Ramirez heard nothing . In the restless quiet of a Sunday night , the phone_call finally came . The voice on the other end was that of Roswita Olejniczak , the mother of their daughter , Tanyta . She told him she had flown to her native country , the_Netherlands , and would not be returning to California . And neither , she said , would their child . Thus began a harrowing and expensive ordeal for Ramirez , 33 , an insurance_underwriter whose mission to bring_back his daughter , now 3 , has taken him from the Orange County district_attorney ' s office -- which has kidnaping charges pending against the mother -- to the U.S. State_Department to the Dutch courts . Dealing with a foreign government is maddening enough , he said , but &quot; when the fate of your 3-year-old girl hangs_in the balance , the fear and frustration -- the terror -- take_on a whole new meaning . Suddenly , your life comes_apart , and you feel incredibly hopeless. &quot; As the international divorce rate rises , cases like that of Ramirez multiply almost exponentially . There are at least 50 like it in Orange County alone , according to the district_attorney ' s office . Some have been_on the books more_than 20 years , while some of the &quot; children &quot; involved are now in their 30s . Figures from the State_Department show that 441 children were taken unlawfully from homes_in the United States in 1993 to the 32 countries that honor the Hague Convention , a 1988 treaty designed to create a worldwide standard in mitigating such cases . The treaty stipulates that , when a child is wrongfully removed from one member nation to another , &quot; the child should be immediately returned to the place of habitual residence &quot; -- meaning the country from which the child was taken , said State_Department spokesman Gary Sheaffer . But officials say the Ramirez case points_up obvious flaws in a treaty that at times seem to defeat its very purpose . The situation is complicated by the ways in which member countries interpret the treaty , Sheaffer said , which leads to the heart of the predicament involving Tanyta Ramirez . &quot; First of all , a U.S. custody order has no legal grounds outside the United States , &quot; despite the existence of the treaty , he said . &quot; And generally , you end_up fighting an all-new custody_battle in another country just to get the child back. &quot; Foreign courts have the option of granting an exception to the treaty if , in their view , it would be &quot; psychologically or physically harmful to return the child &quot; -- which is why Tanyta remains in the_Netherlands , even though Ramirez was granted sole physical custody of her by a California court after she was taken by her mother . . &quot; The courts there ruled that it would be damaging to return the child to the U.S. , &quot; because state and federal kidnaping charges are pending against the mother , Sheaffer said . He said that a Dutch courts made its ruling &quot; only because it feared that the mother ' s arrest would do lasting damage to the child. &quot; Tanyta has lived with her mother since birth . Statistics bear_out the point that the Hague Convention has stopped short of accomplishing its desired objective . The numbers show an increase in child abductions each year since the pact was signed . In 1992 , 268 children were taken from the United States to Hague Convention countries and 247 were taken_to countries that haven ' t signed the treaty . The preceding year , 207 were removed from the United States to other Hague countries , with 245 going_to non-Hague countries . The flow of children from Hague countries to the United States is even higher , with 357 ending_up here in 1993 , compared to 178 in 1992 and 148 in 1991 . Parental child abduction occurring within the United States alone has become a staggering problem , according to a recent Department_of_Justice study that says such abductions reach 350 # 000 a year . Although most children are returned to their homes within a week or so , as_many as 160 # 000 remain missing for longer periods_of_time , according to the study . The longer a child is missing , the less likely he or she will be returned to the custodial parent . For Ramirez , the seemingly endless hours of phone-calling , letter-writing and lobbying -- and more_than $ 9 # 000 in legal and travel expenses -- have failed to reunite father and daughter . At the time she was taken , Tanyta lived with her mother and saw her father on weekends . But both parents shared joint legal custody , meaning the law required them to agree on all major decisions . Ramirez said he had &quot; no inkling &quot; his ex-wife would flee . Since then , he has written to President Clinton , U.S. Sens . Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer , Rep . Ron Packard ( R-Oceanside ) , Queen Beatrix of the_Netherlands and the Dutch Ministry of Justice . No one , he said , has offered help . Courts in the_Netherlands -- including its Supreme Court -- have ruled against Ramirez and in favor of the mother , citing the welfare of the child . Reached at her home_in Land-graaf , the_Netherlands , Olejniczak , 31 , said she left the United States because she feared her temporary green_card , which expired in June , 1993 , would not be renewed . And if she had been deported , &quot; I felt I might never see my daughter again , &quot; she said . &quot; Tanyta . . . she ' s my everything. &quot; Olejniczak met Ramirez in 1987 in the_Netherlands , where he was stationed in the Army and she worked for the American military . They were married in August , 1990 , celebrated the birth of Tanyta in March , 1991 , separated in October , 1991 , and were divorced by July , 1992 . She said it was a difficult and often volatile marriage and life afterward was even harder . Ramirez paid $ 385 a month in child_support , but no alimony . Having trouble making ends meet , Olejniczak approached county welfare authorities for assistance . She received $ 627 for one month , just before expiration of her green_card , but said welfare officials told her that , without a valid visa , she could no longer qualify . &quot; Here were these welfare people telling me I was an illegal alien , &quot; she said , &quot; so I thought , ' I better get_out of here. ' &quot; Ramirez disputes her version of events , saying her green_card had been extended_to last December . Olejniczak claims to have learned about the extension only recently . In an effort to resolve the_matter , Olejniczak says she would allow Tanyta to return to the United States , but only for a visit and only if all criminal charges are dropped and the courts award her sole physical custody . Neither appears likely . &quot; There ' s just an emptiness , &quot; a tearful Ramirez said recently at his home here . &quot; At night , I look_up at the sky and wonder if Tanyta sees the same stars I do -- and misses me as much as I miss her . It ' s just a feeling of doom I have , wondering if anyone will ever expend the effort to help me bring my daughter home . How can you explain losing your child ? &quot; The problem is , such cases often drag_on for years , and many are never resolved , said Deputy Dist . Atty . Kelly MacEachern , who handles the Ramirez case and more_than 50 &quot; just like it &quot; in Orange County . Many of the children involved are now in their 20s and 30s and often don ' t see the abandoned parent until they make the effort themselves as adults , MacEachern said . Ramirez said he wants only &quot; reasonable contact &quot; with his daughter , who he says is losing the ability to speak English in favor of Dutch . He recently sought to have criminal charges dropped_in an effort to bring_about her return , but prosecutors declined . Only an order from the U.S. attorney_general would erase the outstanding warrants , and , officials say , that isn ' t likely to happen . Since last year , Ramirez has been allowed to see Tanyta only once , in a supervised visit in April , after a contentious hearing in the_Netherlands . Olejniczak ' s brother , father and uncle huddled nearby , Ramirez said , apparently concerned that he , too , might try to take her away . &quot; We fell_into the same sweet routines , &quot; he said . &quot; Watching TV , she put her arms around me , held me tight and called me Daddy . Having to leave her there was gut-wrenching . She looked_out the window and blew kisses at me . She waved that little wave of hers . . . &quot; Suddenly , his eyes filled with tears . &quot; Sometimes , I feel I just can ' t go_on , &quot; he said . &quot; You have no idea how awful this is . It ' s the scariest nightmare I could possibly imagine . It consumes your life . I ' d give anything to see it end and have her back in my arms again. &quot;</TEXT>
