   <HEADLINE> TOURS FOR THE THINKING PERSON ; GARDEN GAMBOLS ; TRIPS ON_TAP FOR 1994 EXPLORE SOME OF THE BEST FLORA AND FAUNA THE WORLD HAS TO OFFER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Not on your standard garden-variety tour do you get_out of the cities and off the beaten track to see such sights as a private English cottage garden delightfully and chaotically abloom in washes of every color . Or the painterly landscapes of hillside Italian villas , with their wonderful fountains playing in the bright Mediterranean light . Nor has Europe cornered the market on_tours of beautiful gardens . In Japan , visit an enchanting 14th-Century temple garden ; in Ecuador marvel at innumerable orchids dripping off trees in the land of their native primeval forests . Garden tours , it would seem , are sprouting up like weeds . &quot; In the last 10 years , there has definitely been an increase in the number of garden tours offered , &quot; says Paul Coopersmith of Coopersmith ' s England , a company that organizes tours to Great Britain and Europe . &quot; And more and more tours are being offered to more and more parts of the world . The market is really expanding. &quot; The reasons ? &quot; Certainly it reflects the heightening interest in gardening here at_home , &quot; says Coopersmith . &quot; But in large part it ' s that Americans have become more sophisticated as travelers. &quot; One advantage to joining a garden tour , as opposed to setting_out on_your_own , is that you get the benefit of having leaders who are usually knowledgeable in the fields of landscape design or horticulture . You also may gain admission to private gardens that would otherwise be off limits . Many of the trips that follow are geared toward the devoted , even hard-core gardener : They travel_to several gardens a day , every day . But , says Coopersmith , this is not true of all garden-oriented tours . Some participants are &quot; not necessarily into gardens that much . But they like small groups , nice hotels ; they like to walk outside and see lovely things. &quot; With that in mind , a_few of the tours on this list are followed by stars , indicating that they include time for regular sightseeing and shopping excursions . Consider them if your traveling companion is less enthusiastic than you are about plants . Prices are per person , based on double occupancy ( additional cost for single supplement ) and are subject_to change . Cost includes air fare unless otherwise indicated or labeled &quot; land price. &quot; Some prices include a tax-deductible contribution to a nonprofit organization .
