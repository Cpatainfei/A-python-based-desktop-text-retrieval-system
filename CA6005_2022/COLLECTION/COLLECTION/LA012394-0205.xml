   <HEADLINE> LORENA BOBBITT FOUND INNOCENT ; JURY CITES TEMPORARY INSANITY ; LAW : JUDGE PLACES HER IN CUSTODY TO UNDERGO PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION AFTER SHE SEVERED MATE ' S PENIS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lorena Bobbitt was acquitted by reason of temporary insanity Friday by jurors who agreed an &quot; irresistible_impulse &quot; provoked by abuse compelled her to cut_off her husband ' s penis . She was committed to a mental_hospital for observation . A supporter shrieked as the beginning of the verdict was read , while Mrs . Bobbitt stoically stood next to her attorneys . The decision ended a two-week trial that riveted television viewers who followed every salacious detail of the Bobbitts ' sex lives as it unfolded in testimony on CNN and Court TV . While the verdict was being read , Mrs . Bobbitt turned_to one of her lawyers and asked : &quot; Is that good ? &quot; &quot; This case was not about a penis , &quot; said Lisa Kemler , one of her lawyers . &quot; Everyone was so consumed with that . But that ' s not what this case is really about . It was really about a life. &quot; One of her closest friends read a message from Mrs . Bobbitt directed at abused women . &quot; She encourages you to reach_out , talk to someone today , &quot; Janna Bisutti said . She said Mrs . Bobbitt also hopes to pursue the dream she had when she came_to the United States in 1986 -- a good education , marriage and family . John Bobbitt , who was acquitted of marital sexual_assault for allegedly raping her shortly before she mutilated him , checked_out of his Manassas hotel Thursday and was not at the Prince William County_courthouse . &quot; He ' s not into dancing on graves , &quot; said Paul Erickson , Bobbitt ' s media adviser . Judge Herman A . Whisenant Jr . placed Mrs . Bobbitt in custody to undergo psychiatric evaluation to determine whether she poses a danger to herself or others , as required by Virginia law . Defense_attorney James Lowe objected to the immediate custody order and asked the judge for a hearing on the issue . But Whisenant said the law gave him no choice . Defense_lawyer Blair Howard called the verdict &quot; a great step_forward for Lorena in the healing process. &quot; The psychological observations will determine whether she needs treatment and the extent of that treatment . &quot; I think she will be found not dangerous to herself and others , &quot; Lowe said . Mrs . Bobbitt was taken_to Central State Hospital in Petersburg , where she will be examined by state doctors and at least one outside expert . They must report back to the judge within 45 days . &quot; From the start I knew my daughter was innocent . What happened was a moment of madness , &quot; Mrs . Bobbitt ' s father , Carlos Gallo , said from Venezuela . The Ecuador-born Lorena was raised in Venezuela . Prosecutor Paul B . Ebert told reporters after the verdict that he has &quot; a certain amount of sympathy for Mrs . Bobbitt , but that doesn ' t justify what she did. &quot; &quot; Hopefully , if she needs help , she will get_it , &quot; Ebert said . Ebert said he could not have pursued the case without calling John Bobbitt , 26 , as a witness , and he doubted that his hesitant , sometimes contradictory testimony during the trial hurt his case . &quot; I can ' t manufacture testimony . John Bobbitt is what he is , and he testified , &quot; Ebert said . Earlier in the day , Mrs . Bobbitt smiled and talked with well-wishers as the panel of seven women and five men deliberated . Jurors had sent_out questions to the judge about psychiatric reports on Mrs . Bobbitt and the judge ' s instructions on how to weigh evidence about her state_of_mind . The jury announced its verdict after 7 1 / 2 hours of deliberations over two days . Mrs . Bobbitt , 24 , was charged with malicious wounding , which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison . The jury also considered unlawful wounding , a lesser felony charge that carries no more_than five years in prison . She also could have been deported . Jurors could have acquitted her outright had they concluded she acted in self-defense . Lawyers for Mrs . Bobbitt argued that her four-year marriage to Bobbitt was a &quot; reign_of_terror &quot; in which Bobbitt sometimes beat her and sexually assaulted her . The couple separated twice but were living together at the time Bobbitt was cut . They ' re now seeking a divorce . Mrs . Bobbitt said she was raped early June 23 when her husband came_home from a night of drinking with a buddy . She went_into the kitchen for a glass of water , saw a knife by the dim light of the refrigerator and took it into the bedroom , where she cut_off Bobbitt ' s penis . In recounting those events , Mrs . Bobbitt testified about what went_through her mind as she saw the knife : &quot; I remember the first time he raped me . I remember the put-downs and insults he told me . . . . There were so many pictures in my head . I remember how he did anal sex with me and hurt me . I remember everything , everything. &quot; Her lawyers said years of physical and sexual abuse triggered an &quot; irresistible_impulse &quot; in Mrs . Bobbitt . They said she also was motivated by self-defense because she said Bobbitt had threatened to track her down and rape her if she left him . Although at her husband ' s trial Mrs . Bobbitt was able to describe the mutilation , she testified in her own trial she couldn ' t remember . Prosecutors tried to depict Mrs . Bobbitt as a vengeful wife who attacked her husband out of anger and maintained she could not claim self-defense because Bobbitt was asleep when he was mutilated . Bobbitt ' s penis was reattached surgically the same day it was severed . Doctors say it may take two years to find_out if he will fully recover . The trial in this historic Civil War town 35 miles from Washington , D.C. , brought_out dozens of reporters and television crews . Court TV carried the proceedings gavel-to-gavel . Its coverage ranked 13th in last week ' s cable Nielsen ratings , attracting viewers in 1.76 million homes . Cable News Network also showed much of the testimony live .
