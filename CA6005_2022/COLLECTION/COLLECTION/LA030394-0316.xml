   <HEADLINE> COMPUTER_FILE / LAWRENCE J . MAGID : CD-ROM TAX_PROGRAMS ? WASTED BYTES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> IRS , meet CD-ROM . The two leading tax preparation programs , ChipSoft ' s TurboTax and Meca ' s TaxCut , are now available on multimedia compact_discs for those who want moving pictures and sound along with forms and schedules . The multimedia versions require an IBM-compatible personal_computer with Windows , a CD-ROM_drive and a sound board . There are also non-multimedia versions on floppy_disks for Windows , Macintosh and MS-DOS . Multimedia tax_programs may be eye- and ear-catching , but when it comes_to filling_out your tax_returns , they ' re not much more useful than the floppy_disk versions of the same programs . More on that later , but first let ' s look_at the basic tax preparation software you can get_on a CD or floppy_disk . Any version of TurboTax and TaxCut can prepare your federal and , in many cases , state returns . The same can be said for Parson Technology ' s Personal Tax Edge and Computer Associate ' s CA-Simply Tax . In each case , you have the option of entering information directly on an on-screen replica of an IRS form , or submitting to an &quot; interview &quot; and letting the program put the data on the forms for you . TaxCut does the best job at shielding you from IRS forms . The program pioneered the use of the interview format and this year has added another help system_called the Navigator , which uses graphics to help guide you through the return . The interview takes_place on the top half of the screen , while tax and program advice appear on the bottom . You can optionally view the tax_forms on the bottom of the screen as you enter data on top . * TurboTax also has an interview system , called EasyStep , but it ' s not quite as easy to use as TaxCut ' s . The program is very good for people who are comfortable with filling_out IRS forms . Yet there is still plenty of context-sensitive on-line help , including official IRS instructions that are keyed to whatever form and line you ' re working on . Both programs provide access to all_the forms most people need , and they greatly reduce data entry by automatically copying information from one form to another . They also do your arithmetic and calculate the amount due or refundable . Each of them prints IRS-approved forms and makes_it possible to send them in electronically through an IRS-approved service_bureau . These programs are clearly better than filling_out your forms by hand . At a street price of less than $ 40 ( add $ 10 to $ 15 for the CD-ROM versions ) , they ' re probably more cost-effective than going_to one of the mass-market tax preparation services_staffed by people with limited training . However , computer_programs don ' t protect you from entering incorrect information , and they are limited in terms of how much advice they can give you when it comes_to lowering your tax obligation . Anyone with a complicated tax scenario may be better_off with a CPA , tax attorney or other tax professional . By delivering special versions on CD-ROM , Meca and ChipSoft have been able to add instructional material that , in theory , should make the programs easier to use . I ' m not convinced . ChipSoft took a cafeteria approach with its multimedia version . In addition to the basic Windows version of TurboTax , there are several extra programs , including a video guide featuring Fortune magazine Managing Editor Marshall Loeb , an on-disc version of J.K. Lasser ' s best-selling tax guide , an interactive tax savings guide and IRS on-line instructions . The TurboTax CD also comes_with the state tax preparation software for California and New York . Residents of other states can use the enclosed coupon to order their state software by mail , at no extra charge . * Watching mini-movies of Loeb talking_about taxes isn ' t my idea of entertainment , and it ' s not an efficient way to learn about tax savings . He does give some excellent advice , but his comments would be just as easy to understand in written form . Besides , the film_clips are very basic and general . You can get far more information on TV and radio talk_shows . Lasser ' s &quot; Your Income_Tax , &quot; which does not include any sound or video , contains useful advice , but ChipSoft chose a poor way to deliver it . To read the guide ( which is a graphic image of the printed book ) you need to install the Adobe Acrobat Reader . The software , which comes_on the CD , is copied to your hard_disk . You must also copy another piece of software , Adobe Type Manager , which not only takes more disk_space but , once installed , runs automatically every time you start Windows , whether you need it or not , hogging memory . I would n ' t mind this if the CD came_with an un-install program to get_rid_of these files . But it doesn ' t . I ' m not sure which is harder , removing a Windows program from the various places it has inscribed itself on your system or filling_out IRS tax_forms by hand . TaxCut , by the way , does come_with an un-install option . After you ' re done with your taxes , the program automatically removes itself from your hard_disk , although it does not delete your data files . Meca took a different approach . With Multimedia TaxCut , the instructional material is integrated into the program so that audio and video help pops_up as your prepare your return . But the use of sound and video doesn ' t really make_it any easier to complete your tax_returns . There are two multimedia features . One simply reads aloud instructions that are already on screen in the non-CD version . I found it annoying and a lot more time consuming than just reading the instructions on screen . The other multimedia tool presents a series of clips of the program ' s author , tax attorney Dan Caine , explaining various aspects of the software and tax law . Caine ' s mini-lectures do include some useful information , but again , it ' s the type of information that could easily be displayed in text form . I ' m all for using sound and video as a teaching tool . A video clip is a great way to show how a heart_valve works or illustrate the trajectory of a spacecraft . Sound clips are wonderful ways to teach music or provide a clip from a historically significant speech . But talking heads on a tax preparation program are a waste of bytes .</TEXT>
