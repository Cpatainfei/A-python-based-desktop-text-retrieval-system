   <HEADLINE> NEW LEAF ON LIFE ; HOUSEPLANTS FROM ' 70S ARE AS POPULAR AS EVER , BUT TODAY THEY PROVIDE HUES , ACCENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you haven ' t been in the houseplant section of a nursery since the ' 70s , a fresh visit might feel_like deja_vu . All the foliage plants you associate with the avocado-pit-rooting-on-the-windowsill era are there : philodendrons , rubber_plants , mother-in-law ' s tongue , false-aralia ( the marijuana look-alike ) , Chinese_evergreens , pothos . And , yes , even Boston_ferns . Hasn ' t anything changed in two decades ? Well , yes , and no . &quot; Nothing has truly gone_out of style , &quot; says grower Mark Stansbury of Newport Greenhouses . &quot; Except maybe Creeping-Charlie . All the rest of the classic ' 70s houseplants still sell. &quot; The way plants are used in the home , though , has changed considerably . While some plant lovers still favor the relaxed , indoor_garden look of earlier times , the use and the role of houseplants have evolved . Today , indoor plants are more often used to provide dramatic accents rather than to create a microclimate . A room is more likely to have single , large plants in it rather than scores of smaller plants ; and most plants reach for the skylight rather than trail from hanging planters . Whereas variations on green seemed color enough in an earlier time , now houseplants are likely to bring bold splashes of color indoors with them . People want living color_in their interiors today , just as they do_in their landscaping , Stansbury said . They ' re scooping_up blooming outdoor plants in small pots -- things like azaleas , begonias , cineraria , cyclamen and kalanchoe -- and bringing them inside to enjoy while they ' re in flower . The interest in indoor blooms has become so strong , in fact , says Stansbury , that many interior plant growers have switched from specializing in foliage plants to exclusively providing indoor seasonal color . Larry Amling , manager at Armstrong Garden Center in Newport Beach , sees the same trend . Anything in bloom in the interior plant section of his nursery sells , he says , and four-inch pots sell particularly well . &quot; People are buying several at a time and combining them with small foliage plants like maidenhair_fern , just as they would with outdoor seasonal color_in containers , &quot; says Amling . Though theoretically these plants could be transplanted outside after blooming , most people treat them as long-term centerpieces and dispose_of them after they flower , he says . One increasingly popular way to provide long-term color indoors is with orchids ; their blooms typically last a minimum of two months . Orchid prices have dropped significantly since the ' 70s , most dramatically in the case of cymbidiums . &quot; It wasn ' t that long ago that cymbidiums were priced according to how many flower_stalks were in bloom , &quot; Amling says . &quot; But that ' s no longer the case . And prices are much lower , usually $ 29 retail , versus the $ 39 to $ 49 price_tags of the past. &quot; The price of cymbidiums came_down because of faster methods of propagation and more growers entering the market , and the same thing will happen soon with phalaenopsis ( moth-orchids ) , Stansbury predicts . Whereas cymbidiums are generally retired to a patio between bloom seasons , phalaenopsis qualifies as a true houseplant and remains indoors year-round . &quot; All phalaenopsis requires is good light -- morning sun or filtered light all day long -- temperatures consistently above 55 degrees , and regular fertilizer , &quot; says Steve Kawaratani of the Laguna Nursery . &quot; They ' re pretty easy . My wife has about 30 , and there ' s always at least one in bloom. &quot; * Bromeliads are another option for indoor color , says Kawaratani . &quot; Flowers last up_to four months , &quot; he says . Nurseries used to offer only one variety , he says ( you ' ve seen it ; the flowers are bubble-gum pink ) , but dozens are available . Since a parent plant will produce only one flower during its lifetime , many people treat bromeliads as disposables . But you could also move them outdoors after they finish blooming and let them produce offsets , which , with a bit of luck , will flower . Advances in tissue culture technology are directly responsible_for most of the new bromeliads , says Stansbury . ( The same thing is true of orchids and anthuriums. ) Because a laboratory has the ability to produce clones of an original plant in a test_tube every few weeks , it no longer takes years to propagate enough of a new hybrid to bring it to market , he says . Peter Tolley , lab manager at Twyford Labs in Santa Paula , provides a dramatic illustration : &quot; We cloned some marigold hybrids for a seed company a while back , &quot; he says . &quot; We started with something like five plants and produced a half-million by the end of the year . With traditional propagation methods , you ' d get maybe 600. &quot; Tissue culture technology has affected the traditional houseplant market , too . Take another look_at that philodendron in the nursery . Chances are it ' s not really the same plant you grew in the ' 70s . &quot; People like buying something that they have had good_luck with before but that ' s a little bit different , &quot; Amling says . For example : a trusty philodendron but a cultivar with burgundy-tinted leaves this time around , for instance , or a variegated rather than a regular Ficus benjamina . &quot; In fact , anything variegated goes. &quot; Ferns are different too . ' Dallas , ' for example , has pretty much supplanted ' Boston. ' &quot; It needs less light , less humidity and less room because it stays compact rather than cascading , &quot; Amling says . * Visit a nursery that makes interior plants one of its specialties and you ' ll find differences from the ' 70s that are more dramatic . The very size of the plants , for one thing . Houseplants as big as small trees have become almost commonplace . There are two reasons , according to Kawaratani . One is that current architecture encourages it . &quot; Ceilings are higher , and there ' s more glass and skylights , &quot; he says . &quot; Spaces like that call_for larger plants that were used in the past , and they provide enough light to support them. &quot; The other reason is aesthetic . People are buying fewer plants -- no more windows totally obscured by greenery in macrame hangers -- and instead opting for bolder ones . &quot; They ' re buying architectural-looking plants with strong , graphic shapes -- the emphasis is line rather than mass -- and treating them like just one more element in the decor , &quot; Kawaratani says . Palms , still the top sellers among tree-size interior plants , are a good_example . Stately Kentia or fishtail_palms can soften an empty corner between two windows , serve as a backdrop to a wingback chair , or flank a handsome archway , drawing attention to it . Similarly , columnar-shaped plants , like dracenas or euphorbias , can substitute for sculpture in an entryway or other narrow space . Euphorbias , though expensive because extremely slow growing , are excellent houseplants for people who don ' t like to fuss , Kawaratani says . &quot; Since they have virtually no leaves , they need little water or humidity . Their main requirement is sunlight. &quot; Giant bird-of-paradise is a relative newcomer that ' s become very popular . Though common as an outdoor plant , it ' s also been found to do_well indoors when provided with ample light . And it is a striking example of the current philosophy of less is more . A six-foot-tall plant might consist_of just four or five enormous leaves -- a dramatic contrast to the thousand-leaved Ficus benjamina that would likely have filled its place in the ' 70s . * Speaking of the ' 70s , two large plants from that era that weren ' t seen much of in the ' 80s are experiencing a comeback . One is Dracaena fragrans ' Massangeana , ' commonly known as the cornplant ; the other is Ficus lyrata , the fiddleleaf fig . Like the other large houseplants mentioned already , these two are decidedly structural in shape . If you ' re looking_for a plant six feet tall or larger , you ' ll most likely need to visit what the trade calls an &quot; interior scaper. &quot; Instant Jungle of Costa Mesa , a provider of plants for restaurants , hotels and shopping_centers as well as for spacious interiors , is one . &quot; Large Kentia palms are our specialty , &quot; says vice_president Andy Blanton , &quot; and they ' re still my favorite plant . They ' re graceful , versatile and classic . They seem to work with any interior . I think they ' ll always be around. &quot; To satisfy customers ' constant demand for the unusual , however , Instant Jungle has sought_out lots of new palms as well . Triangular palm , named for its wedge-shaped trunk , is an outstanding example . In addition to a strong , architectural shape , this tree features a trunk washed in beautiful lavender , gray and eggplant tones . Grass palm from Mexico , which looks_like a cross between a giant festuca and agave -- looks spiky but feels soft -- is another interesting example . &quot; It ' s very architectural , &quot; Blanton says . &quot; And that ' s what people seem to want today . They want a specific shape for a specific space , not just a generic big , bushy plant. &quot; Other exotics stocked by Instant Jungle are giant aloes , ponytail-palm ( actually a succulent ) and various bamboo with patterned canes , an interesting alternative to dracaena where a columnar-shaped plant is desired . * In summary , everything you grew in the ' 70s is still out there . Even spider_plant is back . In fact , some stores can ' t keep it in_stock since the National Aeronautics and Space Administration published research citing it as one of the most effective plants for air purification . Lots of exotic new things are , too . And the majority of these plants are available at prices that are positively retro . In fact , houseplants just may be the bargain of the ' 90s . &quot; What else can you think_of where prices are actually lower than they were in the ' 70s ? , &quot; Stansbury asks .</TEXT>
