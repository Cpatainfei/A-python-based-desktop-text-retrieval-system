   <HEADLINE> COASTAL WREN WON ' T BE PUT ON ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST ; WILDLIFE : THE DECISION ANGERS MANY CONSERVATIONISTS . HOWEVER , THERE IS DISAGREEMENT AMONG ORNITHOLOGISTS ON WHETHER THE BIRDS ARE A TRUE SUBSPECIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Citing disagreement within the scientific community about the coastal cactus_wren and whether it is a unique subspecies , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decided Friday not to put the songbird on the endangered species list . Federal_officials released a report containing the findings of several ornithologists who said the bird found primarily in Southern California coastal sage scrub is similar to other subspecies of wrens found in large_numbers in Baja California and throughout the Southwest . Experts estimate there are 2 # 000 pairs of coastal wren living_in Orange , Riverside , San Bernardino and San Diego counties . The Fish and Wildlife Service ' s decision not to include the coastal wren on the endangered species list was also made easier by the refusal of the influential American Ornithologists ' Union to recognize the bird as a separate subspecies . Most observers viewed the agency ' s ruling as a victory for developers . However , both builders and scientists said the decision will have little impact on the wrens found in Southern California because most of them live alongside the California gnatcatcher , which is already protected as an endangered species . Dawn McCormick , a spokeswoman for the Irvine Co. , Orange County ' s largest private landowner , said the Fish and Wildlife Service ' s ruling , while welcomed , &quot; does not really impact us a whole lot. &quot; The Irvine Co . played an influential role in the creation of state ' s Natural Communities Conservation Planning program in 1991 , which encourages landowners to voluntarily set_aside habitat for the gnatcatcher and other rare plants and animals . The program calls_for &quot; comprehensive habitat planning that deals with habitat as_a_whole rather than individual species , &quot; said McCormick . &quot; We ' re treating the gnatcatcher and cactus_wren all_the same as part of the ( planning ) process , &quot; said McCormick . &quot; We ' re treating the cactus_wren as if it was_on the ( endangered species ) list. &quot; * However , some scientists criticized the Fish and Wildlife Service ' s action and blasted the American Ornithologists ' Union ' s refusal to recognize the coastal wren as a subspecies . &quot; The AOU ' s recognition of the gnatcatcher as a distinct subspecies and their rejection of the cactus_wren seems in opposition to the decision I would expect from them , &quot; said Dennis Murphy , director of the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford_University . Officials at the American Ornithologists ' Union in Washington could not be reached for comment . Murphy , who was the chief author of the conservation guidelines for the state ' s conservation planning program , also expressed disappointment over the refusal by federal wildlife officials to recognize the coastal wren as a distinct and endangered species . &quot; This coastal population of wren is one of the most distinct subspecies you ' re ever going_to find , &quot; he said . &quot; I assure you that if you gave me a box full of coastal wrens and inland wrens , I could separate every_last one of them. &quot; The coastal wren is about eight inches long , with black and buff feathers spotted with dark splotches . The bird ' s distinctive sound is a staccato churring that experts describe as unharmonious and even annoying . But Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman Richard Zembal said there is still not enough scientific evidence available to list the coastal wren as a separate subspecies . &quot; There is nothing unique about the Southern California wren . . . . They are common in many kinds of habitats all_over the southwestern United States , &quot; said Zembal . &quot; The question is one of distinctness . We just can ' t say that the Southern California cactus_wren is a unique population. &quot; Other kinds of cactus_wrens , which are non-migratory , are found throughout the Southwest , from Texas to California and south to Mexico . The bird makes its home_in the cholla and prickly_pear_cactus , about three feet off the ground . Amadeo Rea , a San Diego ornithologist who led the effort to put the coastal wren on the endangered species list , said the songbird has a call different from the other wrens . &quot; Anyone can see there is a difference unless they ' re blind in both eyes , &quot; said Rea . &quot; The desert and coastal birds sound different . There are also obvious physical differences between the continental and coastal birds. &quot; However , Rea acknowledged that the coastal and Baja California birds have similar characteristics . * The Fish and Wildlife Service ' s report also said that the coastal wren ' s numbers in Southern California are declining as &quot; coastal sage scrub habitats are becoming increasingly depleted &quot; and encouraged the conservation of the bird ' s shrinking habitat . Kimball Garrett , ornithology collection manager at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural_History , said the bird should be listed as an endangered species because &quot; it ' s losing its habitat. &quot; &quot; They ' ve got_to look_at this as a habitat issue too , &quot; Garrett said . &quot; Unless the ( coastal ) wren is listed as an endangered species , we will have no viable means of habitat protection . And if the bird ' s habitat can ' t be protected , we can ' t protect the bird. &quot;</TEXT>
