   <HEADLINE> LAW AND ORDER ON THE DELTA ; SPECIAL DFG UNIT HELPS PATROL SLOUGHS LOOKING FOR POACHERS AND OTHER VIOLATORS , BUT SOMETIMES COMPASSION NECESSARY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the dog is the natural enemy of the cat , the snake of man , so were we of the fish patrol the natural enemies of the fishermen . -- JACK LONDON , &quot; Tales of the Fish Patrol &quot; From the looks_on the faces of the four men , confronted on a recent night by Department of Fish and Game_wardens and caught red-handed with dozens of undersized striped bass , it seems little has changed since Jack London ' s days as a commissioned warden around the turn_of_the_century . Fishermen still break the law , knowingly or otherwise , and those who get caught are usually quick to show their scorn for the law . &quot; There are too many regulations on everything , &quot; one of the men said as he was being cited by Lt . Joe Gonzalez . &quot; You should have the rules written_on the ( fishing ) licenses . I can go_out into the ocean and catch anything I want . There are no regulations out there ! &quot; Gonzalez , who has seen and heard it all , continued writing while warden Robert Prosser gathered the fish , some only four inches long , as evidence . Only one of the men , all_of Philippine ancestry , spoke English , and he was the one cited . He will have his day in court , and probably be fined a_few hundred dollars . Back in the truck , continuing down the dark and desolate road , Gonzalez said : &quot; The man ' s an engineer for the state . He builds bridges and he doesn ' t know that a striper should be 18 inches ( the legal limit ) ? &quot; * The 1 # 100 miles of waterways winding through this region are jet-black at night , and the streets along the levees provide miles of access . It is easy to see why this maze of sloughs known as the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta , an agricultural mecca by day , is a poacher ' s paradise . With knowledge of the tides and seasonal runs of salmon and striped bass , fishermen can carry a small_boat down to the water ' s edge , spread a net or set a line across the slough and in a_few hours haul in a load of fish , then slip out_of_sight . Such operations have been going_on in the Delta since London ' s days , when &quot; knives flashed at the beginning of trouble and men permitted themselves to be made prisoners only after a revolver was thrust in their faces. &quot; But now , with all Delta fisheries in serious decline for several reasons , a serious effort is being made to deter poachers from showing such blatant disregard for the law . The DFG is trying to use its regular wardens in conjunction with the relatively new Delta-Bay Enhanced Enforcement Project , or D-Beep , which was organized in 1992 and recently expanded to 10 wardens and a lieutenant . An additional 10 wardens doesn ' t sound like much , but then D-Beep is not an ordinary DFG unit : It has money with which to operate . D-Beep is funded by the Department of Water Resources as part of a mitigation effort to offset fishery losses caused by water diversions that destroy eggs , larvae and young_fish in the system . Steelhead runs , once prolific , are all but a thing of the past . Salmon runs are endangered or threatened . Spawning adult striped bass in the Delta , which in the 1960s numbered 3 million , have declined to a_few hundred_thousand . The days of London ' s sailing the bay chasing down Chinese junks and angry fishermen are a thing of the past in one respect : D-Beep wardens have at their disposal shiny new boats capable of 50 m.p.h. , with state-of-the-art electronics and engines that run silently at the touch of a button . They have telescopes with cameras to spot and document poachers from almost a mile away , and laser-enhanced night-vision equipment that enables them to see in the dark . Said Prosser , somewhat colorfully : &quot; Our deputy lieutenant , he ' s just happier than a pig in boop that somebody ' s got the money to buy these things to make our job easier. &quot; It will never be an easy job . The Delta is too big , and it ' s like no other angling destination . Fishermen from all walks_of_life come here every day . In the spring and summer when the daytime heat is unbearable , they come at night when the mosquitoes are equally unbearable , parking on the levees and clearing a path to the water ' s edge . For many , there is no such thing as catch and release , nor is there any sport . There is only the_matter of catching some fish to feed the family . * On that same recent cold and windy night , Prosser and Gonzalez stopped to check_out an old station_wagon parked on the levee 15 feet above the slough . Inside were a husband and wife with two young children . One end of a string of heavy monofilament was tied to the car ' s antenna , which was bent almost to the breaking point toward the water . The other end was about 35 feet out_in the slough , attached_to a rock . Three lighter lines with baited hooks were suspended from the heavier line and the hooks were in the water . The line would be checked from time to time , any fish removed and the hooks baited and put_back in place . It ' s a method common among Southeast Asian fishermen and is legal , Prosser said , provided three or fewer hooks are used . Prosser and Gonzalez climbed back into the truck and continued down the road . They stopped again and noted more anglers using the same method . Farther down the road , the four previously mentioned fishermen were huddled at the foot of an embankment , using rods and reels , when Gonzalez and Prosser came_up from behind . At first , the English-speaking man denied catching the fish stuffed in a small_white bag nearby , some of them still flapping . He eventually acknowledged blame for the whole group . &quot; It ' s my fault for bringing them , &quot; he said , pointing to the others , who seemed confused by the situation . Driving on , the wardens noticed a man setting_up a plastic tarpaulin under some trees for shelter . He had his young son with him . They were camping for the night , hoping to catch their dinner . &quot; Hard times , &quot; the man said , as Prosser and Gonzalez started to move_on . They did not check for licenses . &quot; Even we have a heart , &quot; Prosser said . When told by this reporter that he had never experienced anything to match this scene , Gonzalez said matter-of-factly : &quot; This is just different out here . This is the Delta. &quot; * Since its creation in 1992 , the D-Beep unit has made more_than 4 # 000 arrests , with a conviction rate of nearly 100 % . Most of the violations were for fishing without a license or for possessing too many fish or fish under the legal size . But D-Beep , while steadily increasing the compliance rate among everyday fishermen , seems also to have begun uncovering dozens of large-scale poaching operations in which fish by the hundreds were being netted or caught_on set-lines and sold on the black_market . &quot; Many people here are new immigrants and they ' re not sophisticated , and other groups have a whole plan worked_out where they may actually be fencing this stuff , and they ' re just as complicated as any drug lord , &quot; D-Beep warden Mark Lucero said . The most innovative poachers to date , Lucero said , were dubbed the &quot; 50th Avenue Sturgeon Gang &quot; because all its members lived_on 50th Avenue in Sacramento . After six months ' surveillance with night scopes , D-Beep finally nabbed two of them in November 1993 on the lower Sacramento River off Sherman Island , near its confluence with the San Joaquin River . At midnight , the suspects were spotted working with longlines on the water . They then moved upriver without using their lights for about two miles , and began loading the night ' s catch into a van . The team moved_in and arrested So Van Nguyen and Tung Van Nguyen . Others believed to be involved could not be connected to the crime . Included in the catch was a 180-pound sturgeon as a well as smaller sturgeon and hundreds of striped bass . The van was modified with an electric winch and boxes with false bottoms to store the fish and gear . The longlines measured a total of 2 # 250 feet . The Nguyens pleaded guilty on March 1 and were fined $ 2 # 735 each . So Van Nguyen was sentenced to 30 days in jail , Tung Van Nguyen to 10 days in jail . Both had their fishing privileges revoked for three years , and their boat and equipment were confiscated by the state . &quot; The key thing is , our funding source basically allows us to do our job 24 hours a day , &quot; Gonzalez said . &quot; If we come_upon a net case or set-line or longline , we have the capability to just go_ahead and be_on stakeout as long as it takes , where we might not have been able to before . With some of the restrictions and budgetary problems the state ' s going_through right now . . . that is affecting the regular wardens ' jobs . They don ' t have that luxury to stay out there past eight hours. &quot; An even more recent case involving two gill-netters resulted in large fines and jail sentences . And one repeat offender , who had spent six months in jail , was believed to have fled the country after being caught a third time . Several boats have been seized and thousands of dollars worth of gear have been confiscated . D-Beep members and the DFG admit they will never be able to put a stop to the poaching of fish in the Delta -- Lucero says they probably catch only 3 % of the violators -- nor are they naive enough to believe that the fisheries will ever be the same as in Jack London ' s day . But London would be proud nonetheless , having written_of his dealings with poachers : &quot; We menaced their lives . . . We confiscated illegal traps and nets , the materials of which had cost them considerable sums and the makings of which required weeks of labor . And when we captured them , they were brought into the courts of law , where heavy cash fines were collected from them . As a result , they hated us vindictively. &quot;</TEXT>
