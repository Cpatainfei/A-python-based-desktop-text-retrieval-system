   <HEADLINE> GOP SEEKS MORATORIUM ON NEW FEDERAL REGULATIONS ; POLICY : NEW REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS JOIN FORCES TO PRESS THE CLINTON_ADMINISTRATION TO BAN ISSUING ANY NEW RULES FOR 100 DAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The new Republican leaders of the House and Senate , joining forces for the first time on a high-profile legislative issue , called_on the Clinton_Administration Monday not to issue any new federal regulations during the first 100 days of the 104th Congress . The GOP proposal would take_away one of the executive_branch ' s most potent powers at a time when there is significant political momentum for legislative measures that would roll back federal regulations and bar new ones . In a letter sent to the White_House on Monday , incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) and his Senate counterpart , Majority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , urged President Clinton to issue an executive order , effective immediately , that would impose a moratorium on new federal rules that govern everything from air_pollution to airline travel_to banking transactions . At the same time , the House and Senate leaders asked Clinton to direct Cabinet secretaries to rout_out unnecessary or inefficient regulations already on the books and provide Congress with the internal analyses supporting its rule-making decisions . A White_House spokeswoman said it was too early for the White_House to react to the proposal . &quot; We will take_a_look at it -- obviously we ' ll take a careful look_at anything that comes from the congressional leadership , &quot; said White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers . &quot; But we don ' t have any response to it at this time. &quot; The 100-day period coincides with a Republican timetable for acting_on a range of promised legislation designed , among other things , to lighten the regulatory burden imposed on the economy by Washington . Republicans on Monday cited private estimates suggesting that abiding_by all federal regulations costs American industry between $ 588 billion and $ 860 billion annually and constitutes a &quot; hidden_tax &quot; that imposes an &quot; enormous burden on our economy. &quot; The proposed moratorium appeared designed to thwart many agencies ' plans to bypass what they see as a new , Republican-dominated Congress hostile to strictures on businesses . Many agencies had hoped to move quickly to tighten some public health and safety protections through the issuance of regulations , which are interpretations of laws , rather than ask Congress to reform the laws themselves . In one of the most controversial regulatory proposals in the works , the Food and Drug Administration has been drafting regulations that could affect the lucrative tobacco_industry by defining nicotine as a drug . At the same time , the Environmental Protection Agency has said it would propose new regulations to assure the purity of drinking_water , and Interior_Department officials have discussed ways to tighten environmental rules on the mining industry through the regulatory process . The lawmakers said that any moratorium should exclude regulations that &quot; respond to emergencies such_as those that pose an imminent danger to human health or safety. &quot; Senate Republicans , flexing their new political muscle , said they believed Clinton would have little choice but to take them up_on their challenge . &quot; I think ( members of the Clinton_Administration ) see change coming and reforms bigger than they anticipated having to consider and say : ' The ground is shifting beneath us . We ' d better reinvent government more , ' &quot; said Sen . Thad Cochran ( R-Miss. ) , one of eight GOP congressional leaders who signed the letter . &quot; It seems we ought to explore some ways to work together to meet the objectives the President is now talking_about . . . . We ' re suggesting something he may very well be able to do or want to do , judging by his recent statements. &quot; The leaders ' bold gesture came as House and Senate lawmakers prepared a raft of proposals designed to roll back regulation . That objective is one of the House Republicans ' &quot; contract with America &quot; items , and is expected to be a major theme among Republican presidential candidates in the coming election campaign . Cochran said Dole and Gingrich , who have had strained relations in the past , had joined forces to press for the moratorium &quot; because this is such a high priority. &quot;</TEXT>
