   <HEADLINE> AND THE EARTH DID NOT SWALLOW THIS FILM PROJECT ; MOVIES : SEVERO PEREZ PERSEVERED TO MAKE THE FEATURE BASED ON THE 1971 NOVEL OF A CHICANO BOY GROWING_UP IN A MIGRANT FARM-WORKER FAMILY IN THE ' 50S .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Severo Perez , an independent Chicano filmmaker and writer , is about to see his dream of a lifetime come true . His feature_film &quot; . . . and the earth did not swallow him &quot; is set to premiere Saturday at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival . The film is based on the 1971 semi-autobiographical novel &quot; . . . y no se lo trago la tierra , &quot; by the late Tomas Rivera , the Chicano writer who was chancellor of the University of California at Riverside when he died in 1984 . Rivera ' s much-praised book tells the story of a Chicano boy growing_up in a migrant farm-worker family in the 1950s . Perez recalled that after reading the book 20 years ago , he excitedly called Rivera on the phone . &quot; I told him it was the first time I ever saw my culture , the stories , the people that I grew_up with on a page , and they were real . I think he was a little embarrassed. &quot; The filmmaker also tried to secure the rights to the film at the time . &quot; Rivera said , ' Go_ahead and just do it. ' I told him I needed a release . Unfortunately , I couldn ' t take his word and get funding. &quot; Perez later learned the film rights had been sold . In the meantime , the San Antonio , Tex. , native built Learning Garden , a successful educational film and animation company in Hollywood . He also worked as a producer on Jesus Trevino ' s &quot; Seguin &quot; and wrote &quot; Soldier Boy , &quot; a screenplay about a Chicano family adjusting to life in post-WWII Texas . Although that film was never made , Perez and his wife , Judith , adapted it into a play , which premiered in 1982 at El Teatro Campesino , directed by Luis Valdez . &quot; After that , I devoted my time to getting the rights to ' tierra , ' &quot; said Perez , now 52 , in an interview at his Silver Lake home . He finally bought the rights to the book from the author ' s widow . When Perez contacted PBS producer Paul Espinosa , he didn ' t think their project would turn_into a major production , but to their delight , they received a $ 1-million grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to write and research the screenplay . Once the film finished shooting in 1992 , Perez ran_out of money to complete the film ' s score and post-production . Espinosa got additional money from the Corp . for Public Broadcasting and from &quot; American Playhouse , &quot; the PBS-TV program that funded Greg Nava ' s &quot; El Norte &quot; and Ramon Menendez ' s &quot; Stand and Deliver. &quot; Espinosa now sets the film ' s final cost at nearly $ 2 million . * Perez admits they were lucky , since most independent Latino film projects in Hollywood usually fall by the wayside . &quot; The problem with Chicano filmmakers , &quot; he says , &quot; is that we don ' t have access to the marketplace. &quot; Nevertheless , Perez feels that a healthy , independent Chicano cinema is possible . &quot; To have a Chicano cinema , we have to address a Chicano audience , their sensibilities . We can ' t just expect an Anglo actor with brown contacts to speak_to our culture . It has to be deeper than that . The chemistry for Mexican rice isn ' t just tomatoes and rice ; it ' s a whole process of building something from scratch . &quot; I started making films before I saw Chicano films , &quot; he says . &quot; The one filmmaker I appreciated was Mexican director Alfonso Arau , especially his ' Calzonzin Inspector ' and ' El Aguila Descalza. ' They were films made on the run and are still exciting to watch. &quot; Perez was also inspired by Italian Neo-realist director Vittorio DeSica ' s &quot; Bicycle Thief. &quot; &quot; When I was desperately looking_for more money to finish ' tierra , ' I reminded myself that DeSica shot most of his film in wide shots because it was the most inexpensive way to work . Since I had 47 locations in 27 days and a small budget , I told the story using master shots because in that wide shot you get a sense of atmosphere as well. &quot; * While Hollywood bemoans the supposed lack of qualified Latino actors for starring roles , Perez had no such problem . He cast veteran Latino actors Rose Portillo ( &quot; Cagney &amp; Lacey &quot; ) and Marco Rodriguez ( &quot; Hill Street Blues &quot; ) as the boy ' s parents ; Daniel Valdez ( &quot; Zoot Suit &quot; ) as Bartolo , a traveling troubadour ; Lupe Ontiveros ( &quot; El Norte &quot; ) as a deceiving baker ' s wife ; and Sal Lopez ( &quot; Virgin of Tepeyac &quot; ) as El Mojado . Casting the lead role of the migrant boy was harder . He saw some 300 kids before picking Jose Alcala , 16 , of East Los Angeles for the part . &quot; Jose has honesty , &quot; Perez said of his choice . &quot; He also has enormous courage . For a young actor with little acting training , he took risks by getting_out there and doing the lines I gave him without hesitation . What you see on the screen is genuine. &quot; Alcala , a Garfield High_School student , previously co-starred in the television movie &quot; The Long Walk Home &quot; with George C . Scott . &quot; I enjoyed working with Mr. Perez , &quot; says Alcala . &quot; He told me that ' tierra ' was the story of a boy who ' s looking through his past to discover who he is . That helped me get a better grip on the role. &quot; Perez is hoping his film will be picked_up by a commercial distributor for a theatrical run after its premiere . &quot; Although ' tierra ' will air nationally on ' American Playhouse ' this fall , PBS is encouraging us to seek a commercial release to make the film more visible when it is aired in the future. &quot; The director ' s next project is a small-budget film version of &quot; Soldier Boy. &quot; &quot; It ' s an extension of ' tierra , ' both in time and place , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
