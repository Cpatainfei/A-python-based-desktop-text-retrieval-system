   <HEADLINE> PAPER TRAIL IN ARGENTINE ARCHIVES TRACES NAZIS ' STEPS ; SOUTH_AMERICA : PREVIOUSLY SECRET DOCUMENTS REVEAL NETWORKS THAT HELPED PROTECT THIRD_REICH KILLERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When ABC Television aired Sam Donaldson ' s in-your-face interview with Erich Priebke early in May , the U.S. network not only revealed the presence of an accused Gestapo war_criminal in southern Argentina . It also put a prime-time spotlight on this South_American_country ' s shadowy role as a haven for World_War_II Nazis . Priebke , a former German SS captain who participated in the execution of 335 Italian civilians in 1944 , has lived peacefully and quietly in Argentina since 1948 . He and hundreds of other Nazis who came_to South_America after the war found anonymity and security , precious commodities for men who were hated and hunted elsewhere in the world . How Third_Reich killers and collaborators were able to hide_out in this country is now becoming increasingly clear : In the last two years , the_Argentine government has opened previously secret archives to researchers who want to trace the steps of Nazis in this country . And as the painstaking research proceeds , under the auspices of Argentina ' s Jewish community , it is turning_up documents that detail a historical pattern of tolerance and complicity on behalf of fugitive Nazis . &quot; There was a network of protection -- if not legal , at least bought -- that made_it very difficult to find them and bring them to justice , &quot; said Ruben Beraja , leader of the Delegation of Argentine Israelites Assns. , which is sponsoring the research dubbed &quot; Project Testimony. &quot; Exactly how the protective systems worked and who was involved have long been a subject of speculation . Nazi-hunters have discovered some of the puzzle ' s pieces over the years as they tracked_down war_criminals in Argentina , including the notorious Adolf Eichmann . But important information in the form of official_documents -- diplomatic notes , police reports , administrative memoranda -- was largely out_of_reach until Project Testimony . Although the documents uncovered have yet to be catalogued and cross-referenced , researchers showed The Times copies of hundreds of pages containing intriguing information on notable Nazi figures . Many of the documents show that Nazis entered Argentina with travel papers issued by the International Red_Cross , reinforcing allegations of Red_Cross negligence or complicity in the flight of Nazi war_criminals to South_America . Red_Cross officials now say that it was not the organization ' s job to investigate applicants for travel documents . An Argentine Federal Police memorandum from 1964 notes that death-camp doctor Josef Mengele &quot; entered the country on 20 May , 1949 , carrying passport No . 100 # 501 , issued by the International Red_Cross in the name of Gregor Helmut. &quot; That document also shows that German authorities were also careless , at the very least , in Mengele ' s case . &quot; In November of 1956 , &quot; the memo says , &quot; he presented his birth_certificate with his true name , certified by the Embassy of the Federal German Republic in our country , and requested the rectification of his name and surname. &quot; Argentine authorities issued him a new identification card with his real name . Another document shows that Mengele petitioned Goethe University in Frankfurt , Germany , to validate his medical degree . Mengele was known as the &quot; Angel of Death &quot; for his role in the extermination of thousands of Jews at the Auschwitz death camp , where he performed experiments on prisoners . Other documents found by Project Testimony say Mengele practiced medicine here , reportedly specializing in illegal abortions . One paper explains Argentina ' s refusal to arrest Mengele for extradition because &quot; the crimes attributed to the subject are political in nature. &quot; An order for his arrest was finally issued in 1961 , but he was never found . Mengele later lived under another name in neighboring Brazil , where he drowned at an Atlantic resort in 1979 , according to Brazilian authorities and international investigators . Another Nazi war_criminal who came_to Argentina was Josef Schwammberger , an SS sergeant who participated in thousands of killings as the commander of Jewish slave labor camps in southeastern Poland during the war . An Argentine police document says Schwammberger entered the country in 1949 . The only Nazi war_criminal ever extradited from Argentina , Schwammberger was convicted in Germany and sentenced to life in prison in 1992 . In several notable cases , Argentine authorities have refused to extradite Nazi war_criminals . In 1947 , the Communist government of Yugoslavia requested the extradition of Ante Pavelic , a former Croatian leader and Nazi collaborator , for war_crimes . A previously secret Argentine Foreign Ministry document recommended refusal . &quot; The ' war_crime ' is what we could call a recent juridical creation . . . akin to that of political crime , &quot; the document says . &quot; Argentine legislation only contemplates extradition for common crimes , and it prohibits it for political crimes. &quot; A June , 1947 , letter from the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires asked Argentina not to admit Milan Stoyadinovich , a pro-Nazi former premier of Yugoslavia . On Sept . 22 , a man named Branko Benzon asked Director of Migration Pablo Diana to allow Stoyadinovich and his family to enter Argentina . The next day , Diana authorized the entry . Beatriz Gurevich , coordinator of Project Testimony , said Yugoslav-born Benzon was a member of a secret commission that advised Diana ' s office on entrance permits for refugees from Europe . According to Gurevich , the commission ' s members were natives of European_countries and frequently made recommendations in favor of Nazis . She said Project Testimony is preparing to release a document that shows how the commission played a key role in influencing immigration policy on behalf of fleeing Nazis . Admiration for Germany was widespread in South_American_countries during the 1930s . President Juan Peron , who governed Argentina with an authoritarian hand from 1946 to 1955 , has been accused of neo-Nazi tendencies -- an accusation that is heatedly denied by Peronists . In interviews , Gurevich emphasized that Argentina was not the only Nazi haven , and not all Argentine officials were pro-Nazi . &quot; It would be mistaken to think that in Argentina there was a generalized anti-Jewish and pro-Nazi attitude , because it wasn ' t so , &quot; she said . Some documents uncovered by Project Testimony have shown that some Argentine diplomats in Europe helped protect Jews from persecution before and during the war . Others , however , denied visas to Jews and helped Nazis after the war . Argentine diplomats in China sold visas to Jews and Nazis alike for up_to $ 2 # 500 , according to researchers . In the Foreign Ministry files , researchers have discovered a 1946 note from the U.S. Embassy that speaks_of large-scale efforts to sneak Nazis into Argentina . &quot; There exists a concerted plan to arrange the clandestine departure from Spain and entry into Argentina of former German agents , &quot; the note says . &quot; It appears that it is becoming increasingly difficult for such German agents in Spain to remain concealed and that , as a consequence , some 150 to 200 Germans expect to come_to Argentina under false identification. &quot; In 1948 , U.S. authorities asked Argentina to look_for Hitler deputy Martin Bormann , who disappeared at the end of the war . A note from the U.S. Embassy reported that &quot; a source abroad &quot; said Bormann was &quot; allegedly residing in Posadas , Provincia de Misiones , &quot; in northern Argentina . An Argentine translation made the location &quot; Posadas , Province of Mendoza , &quot; which is in western Argentina . If a search was ever conducted , it may have been in the wrong province , although Project Testimony has found no further documentation on the case or any other indication that Bormann may have entered Argentina . Project Testimony is being carried_out by a handful of researchers . Gurevich keeps copies of some key documents in her office but often is unable to locate requested papers . If the information were computerized , she said , it would be easier to access . But just one researcher is assigned to the laborious work of entering all_the data into computers . Research in the government archives is laborious . Uncounted boxes of documents , often in disorder and without indexes , remain to be studied . Gurevich said many documents will never be found because they have been thrown_away or purged . Information on Nazi arch-criminal Eichmann , she said , &quot; is almost all purged. &quot; The government says the Eichmann files were lost . Eichmann , mastermind of Hitler ' s genocidal policy against Jews , was abducted from Argentina by Israeli agents in 1960 , tried in Israel and hanged . So far , the archives have yielded no information on Priebke , the former Nazi now being held_in southern Argentina at Italy ' s request . Gurevich said she had no knowledge of most other Nazis said to still be living_in Argentina . Her project ' s purposes are historical , she said , with no priority on tracking_down or gathering evidence against living war_criminals . Rabbi Marvin Hier , dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles , said in a telephone_interview that Argentina should be commended for finally opening its archives to such research . But most of the material is &quot; on people who are no longer alive , &quot; Hier said . &quot; The main issue is , who have they got_out there like Priebke who are still alive ? &quot; The Wiesenthal Center has proposed that Argentina form a special task_force to look_for Nazi war_criminals in this country . President Carlos Saul Menem recently said he believed that such an investigative group would be a good idea . Menem has also said Priebke would be extradited &quot; immediately , if all_the documents are in order. &quot; But Leonidas Moldes , the judge now in_charge of the Priebke case , ruled_in 1988 against the extradition of Abraham Kipp , a former SS policeman from the_Netherlands who has lived_in Argentina since 1949 and has been convicted in absentia of war_crimes by a Dutch court . Priebke has admitted that he was the second-in-command of troops that executed 335 Italians , including about 75 Jews , at the Ardeatine Caves south of Rome . But he told Argentine reporters recently that all_the victims were Communist terrorists and were killed in reprisal for an attack that killed 33 Nazis . In the lake and ski resort of Bariloche , 1 # 000 miles south of Buenos Aires , Priebke was prominent as the president of the local German-Argentine Cultural Assn. , which sponsors a private_school . Argentine newspapers have reported suspicions that the association served as a front for groups helping Nazi war_criminals . In late May , after Priebke ' s house_arrest , the Italian Embassy asked Argentine authorities to take special security measures to prevent the ex-Nazi from escaping with the help of &quot; organized groups. &quot; Priebke , 81 , is reported to be deeply depressed and in poor health , with high_blood_pressure and an irregular heartbeat . It remains to be seen whether he will live to become the second accused Nazi war_criminal to be extradited from Argentina .</TEXT>
