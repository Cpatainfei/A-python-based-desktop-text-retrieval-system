   <TEXT> The Hollywood ending he ' d regularly supplied to others but could never manage for himself finally came_to Steven Spielberg Monday night . To the small surprise but great delight of the audience at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion , Spielberg for the first time won Oscars for best picture and best director for his work_on &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; Looking dazed at both awards even though he must have expected at least one of them , Spielberg grew increasingly emotional as he thanked first his wife , actress Kate Capshaw , &quot; for saving my life 92 days in a row in Krakow , &quot; and then his mother , &quot; my lucky charm. &quot; Then , his voice truly breaking , he talked_of remembering &quot; the 6 million who can ' t be watching this among the billion watching tonight. &quot; Despite this bravura finish , for a while it looked as if this might not be &quot; Schindler ' s &quot; night after all . Yes , it quickly picked_up the first award of the evening for art direction , beating out likely winner &quot; The Age of Innocence. &quot; But after that the film lost in four straight categories , including one for sound to in-house rival &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; before John Williams broke the streak with his victory for best original score . * After that , with the exception of the best actor category , &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; took everything it was up for , invariably reducing its recipients to tears . Steven Zaillian , whose adapted screenplay was praised by Spielberg for its &quot; inordinate restraint , &quot; took pains to thank his father for his complete belief in &quot; common decency. &quot; And veteran editor Michael Kahn was equally emotional in referring to this experience as &quot; the most fulfilling time of my life. &quot; Despite all these words for and about &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; the Oscar evening was very nearly stolen by someone who didn ' t say a word . No , not the canine stars of &quot; Beethoven ' s 2nd , &quot; who steadfastly refused to hit their marks , causing host Whoopi Goldberg to remark , &quot; And they call me a bitch. &quot; Besides Spielberg , the night belonged_to Anna Paquin . The delighted winner of the best supporting actress Oscar for her uncompromising work in &quot; The Piano , &quot; Paquin was so flabbergasted that at first she could do no more_than hyperventilate onstage . Then , when her speech was over , she clutched the statue to her chest like a treasured doll and broke tradition by running directly offstage to her seat . It was the performance of the evening . &quot; The Piano &quot; won two other major Oscars , both expected . Holly Hunter , who reminisced about pretending to play the piano on the window sill when she was 6 years old , won for best actress . And Jane Campion , who won for best original screenplay , confessed that though she &quot; used to feel deeply cynical about award nights like this , &quot; actually participating in one had brought her close to tears . As always , the moments Oscar watchers treasured most were the small , spontaneous ones , like the unidentified woman from the group accepting the best documentary short award for &quot; Defending Our Lives. &quot; Last to speak , she passionately blurted_out : &quot; Domestic violence is the leading cause of violence to women in the United States . Please , we need all your help to stop this. &quot; As for memorable acceptance speeches , two stood_out , one short and one long . The short one came courtesy of Fernando Trueba , the director of &quot; Belle Epoque , &quot; the winning foreign-language film from Spain . &quot; I would like to believe_in God in_order to thank him , &quot; he said , &quot; but I just believe_in Billy Wilder. &quot; * The most eloquent acceptance came from best actor winner Tom Hanks , who starred as an AIDS-afflicted lawyer in &quot; Philadelphia. &quot; Speaking completely without notes , Hanks passionately thanked co-star Denzel Washington &quot; for putting his image at risk &quot; and his gay high-school drama teacher , saying , &quot; I wish my babies could have the same kind of influences. &quot; He closed with a heartfelt &quot; God bless you all , God have mercy on us all and God bless America. &quot; Unfortunately , moments like these are getting increasingly rare , as the Oscar show gets more and more intent_on making the trains run_on time . The result is acceptance speeches so brief that they end_up being nothing but laundry lists of thank-you ' s to no-doubt deserving collaborators . Helping to ease the pain was Whoopi Goldberg , who proved especially adept at keeping things lively with continual ad-libs directed at targets as varied as Nancy Reagan , Larry Fortensky , and a certain fearless section of a great metropolitan daily newspaper . More star power was provided by Bruce Springsteen , who displayed more onstage charisma in singing &quot; Streets of Philadelphia &quot; than did Paul Newman , winner of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award . &quot; This is the first song I ever wrote for a motion_picture , &quot; Springsteen said as he hefted the statuette after the song won . &quot; I guess it ' s all downhill from here. &quot; For collectors of Oscar trivia , the evening provided at least one fun fact to know and tell . When &quot; Black Rider &quot; won for best dramatic short , it marked the second year in a row that a film from a Common_Market country set_on public transportation took_home that particular prize . There ' s a story in there somewhere .</TEXT>
