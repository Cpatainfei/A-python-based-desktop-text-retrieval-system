   <HEADLINE> O.C. THEATER / JAN HERMAN ; EXPECT A CAST OF ECLECTIC CHARACTERS IN SPOTLIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The months ahead promise a world of contradictions at the county ' s prime venues , with stage appearances by everyone from Frankie and Johnny to Spalding Gray , Tommy and the Phantom . Of course , no self-respecting year of theatrical offerings could get_by without Evita and Annie or , at the very least , Susan Anton fronting the Radio City Music_Hall Rockettes . So expect them to show_up here with bells on . If that doesn ' t slake the county ' s thirst for fare of every stripe , there ' s always the possibility of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe with spaced-out Trudy somewhere on Storefront Row , a figurative place of brave little theaters installed in out-of-the-way commercial malls and basements and on local college campuses . King Lear is also making plans to divide his kingdom in that neighborhood . And the classic black American family from the ' 50s , the Youngers of Chicago ' s South_Side , will get its chance to be counted there . Another brood of a much earlier time , the Millers of small-town Connecticut , also will be turning_up , as will the Class of ' 59 from Rydell High . But it is Hedda Gabler who launches 1994 with a bang tonight at South Coast Repertory in a Mainstage revival of Henrik Ibsen ' s century-old play titled ( what else ? ) &quot; Hedda Gabler. &quot; ( Previews continue through Jan . 13 ; the regular run opens the following night. ) Is she a pre-feminist hero of mythic stature or just a gun-toting , manic-depressive housewife who makes trouble for everybody , herself above all ? To put it another way , are her inchoate yearnings for liberation from a life of provincial repression the stuff of tragedy or melodrama ? &quot; We see her as an archetype , &quot; director David Chambers said earlier this week in Costa Mesa . &quot; We ' re looking_at the play as one might look_at a Greek play , recognizing the power of fate . We ' re interested in her spiritual and psychological journey . &quot; Ibsen ' s plays in the 20th Century have been locked_in the drawing room . He ' s been put_in a post-Freudian bag . The take_on the plays tends to be psychological and sociological . &quot; While those are not elements to be ignored , we have to remember he was an extraordinary poet . Psychology and sociology are not all he was interested in by any stretch of the imagination. &quot; &quot; Hedda Gabler &quot; ( through Feb . 13 ) ought to have a formidable actress in the title_role . Chambers has cast Lynnda Ferguson as Hedda , and she certainly has shown herself capable of commanding the stage in previous SCR roles . SCR-goers will remember her most recently as Marianne in &quot; The Miser &quot; and before that as Olivia in &quot; Twelfth_Night , &quot; both also directed by Chambers . But she also starred as a much underrated Tracy Lord in &quot; The Philadelphia Story &quot; and made her SCR debut as the downed aviator in &quot; Misalliance. &quot; Ferguson has been surrounded with a cast possessing top-notch credits . Most of the supporting players are newcomers to SCR . But if they measure_up to the quality of the sterling Nicholas Hormann , an SCR veteran also cast in the production , we ' re in_for a great ride . Meanwhile , SCR has enlisted Ralph Funicello to design the set and Shigeru Yaji the costumes , which virtually guarantees an arresting visual look . And Chambers has written a new English version of the Norwegian text , reworking it from a commissioned literal translation . &quot; While I have not colloquialized the language , there is very definitely an abbreviation , &quot; Chambers said . &quot; I ' ve deflowered the language , if you will , and I hope it is has a Pinteresque impact for its brevity , economy , tautness and ambiguity . The play is shot through_with mysteries and ambiguities . It has extraordinary menace. &quot; Although SCR has done only one Ibsen play before ( &quot; A Doll ' s House &quot; in 1978 ) , it will turn later this month to a longtime favorite , the South_African playwright Athol Fugard , on its Second Stage . Three of his works have been done at the theater ( &quot; The Blot Knot &quot; in 1982 , &quot; Master Harold . . . and the boys &quot; in 1985 , and &quot; The Road to Mecca &quot; in 1989 ) . This time SCR will mount the ironically titled &quot; Playland , &quot; a work about the aftermath of apartheid that had its U.S. premiere two years ago in San Diego ( to mixed reviews ) . SCR artistic director Martin Benson , an old_hand at Fugard stagings , will direct . &quot; Playland &quot; ( Jan . 25-Feb . 27 ) will go_up in Costa Mesa just before the beginning of nationally designated Black History Month -- February -- and doubtless will teach a lesson about race relations in Fugard ' s deeply humane style . The play , which has just two actors and is set_in South_Africa , focuses_on a white war veteran and a black watchman of an amusement_park . They confront each other on New Year ' s Eve , 1989 , in a battle of wills and tortured confessions until the sun comes_up . The Alternative Repertory Theatre in Santa Ana also is gearing_up for Black History Month with a production of &quot; Raisin in the Sun , &quot; Lorraine Hansberry ' s 1959 drama about Lena Younger ' s hope of buying a house and moving her family out of Chicago ' s black ghetto . &quot; We ' re expecting a lot of student groups , &quot; said ART spokesman Gary Christensen . &quot; Even though people may_not have seen the movie ( of ' Raisin ' ) with Sidney Poitier , they ' ve heard of it . The play has a very special place in the black community . It has a mythology . It ' s a sort of national treasure. &quot; Immediately following &quot; Raisin &quot; ( Jan . 28-March 5 ) ART will stage Ray Bradbury ' s &quot; Dandelion Wine &quot; ( March 18-April 9 ) , a reminiscence of childhood about a man who goes_back to his hometown to recapture his youth and reconciles himself with his past . After that comes &quot; The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe , &quot; Lily Tomlin ' s spacey one-woman show of the ' 80s ( written by Jane Wagner ) . Tomlin did_it all_over the country and in Los Angeles and took it to Broadway . But , so far as we can tell , it has never been done_in the county . ART will not have Tomlin ' s services , however . Nor will &quot; Search &quot; ( May 6-June 11 ) be done as a one-woman show . Director Patricia L . Terry has decided to use an ensemble of five women instead . They ' ll be playing Trudy , of course , as well as Agnes and Kate and Chrissy and all_the other inimitable characters Tomlin originated . Meanwhile , over at the Laguna Playhouse ' s Moulton Theatre in Laguna Beach , artistic director Andrew Barnicle is preparing the world_premiere of John Twomey ' s &quot; Teachers ' Lounge &quot; ( Tuesday through Feb . 6 ) , which is described by the theater as a humorous look_at a year in the life of a school_system on the verge of collapse . The Playhouse has done original works before in its long and venerable history , but not often . Barnicle , who is directing &quot; Teachers ' Lounge , &quot; says it is &quot; just as accessible as anything we do here . It ' s a linear play with real people in it . I ' m not exploring or experimenting with theatrical form in front of my audience here . &quot; What interests me , &quot; he adds , &quot; are the characters and the subject_matter and the questions the play raises . It ' s amusing and poignant and very timely. &quot; Later this year the Playhouse also will stage &quot; Ah , Wilderness ! &quot; ( March 15-April 10 ) , Eugene O ' Neill ' s comic ( for him ) recollection of youth through the eyes of Nat and Essie Miller and their son , Richard . That will be followed by &quot; The Mystery of Irma Vep &quot; ( May 17-June 12 ) , Charles Ludlam ' s transvestite spoof of Gothic horror shows . The Playhouse combination is , to say the least , eclectic . &quot; I wanted plays that offer counterpoint to each other rather than any through line , &quot; Barnicle says . &quot; The reason we ' re doing ' Irma Vep ' is just to get some Ludlam up_on our stage . I tend to look_at playwrights who are either interesting or neglected . I also want to put_on one American classic in every season. &quot; When it comes_to eclectic , however , nobody can compete with the Orange County Performing Arts Center . Its Broadway Series for the rest of this year continues with &quot; Grease &quot; ( Mar . 29-April ) . &quot; The Who ' s Tommy &quot; ( May 10-15 ) , &quot; The Great Radio City Music_Hall Spectacular &quot; ( June 14-19 ) and &quot; The Phantom of the Opera &quot; ( July 22-Aug . 28 ) . &quot; Grease &quot; will have stand-up comic Rosie O ' Donnell among its Rydell High graduates and , like several other recent entries in the center ' s Broadway Series ( &quot; My Fair Lady , &quot; &quot; Camelot &quot; and &quot; Gypsy &quot; ) , is a road revival on a pre-Broadway tour that will take it to , rather than from , New York . &quot; The Who ' s Tommy , &quot; a rock musical about a boy who is blind , deaf and mute , is still on Broadway . It was developed at the La Jolla Playhouse in 1992 and became a smash hit there . Then it opened in New York and was hailed by the critics as the best rock musical ever to appear on Broadway , where it won five Tony Awards ( though not the one for best musical ) . &quot; The Great Radio City Musical Hall Spectacular &quot; is supposed to be more_than a mouthful of words . Created to celebrate the hall ' s 60th anniversary , it will feature the Rockettes and Susan Anton . Just what Anton has to do with the hall ' s legendary history is not clear . Andrew Lloyd Webber fans will not want for fare this summer . The nearly six-week booking of &quot; The Phantom of the Opera &quot; is the longest of any event in the center ' s history . Though not as large as the production that played Los Angeles , it will come complete with chandelier . The casting hasn ' t yet been decided . But don ' t expect any name stars . In shorter bookings and in decidedly less glitzy terms , El Teatro Campesino and Spalding Gray will come_to the Irvine Barclay Theatre for one-night engagements . El Teatro Campesino will revive Luis Valdez ' s play &quot; I Don ' t Have to Show You No Stinking Badges ! &quot; ( Feb . 16 ) , about a middle-aged Latino couple that has made a successful living as the &quot; King and Queen of Hollywood extras. &quot; Gray will do his latest monologue , &quot; Gray ' s Anatomy &quot; ( May 1 ) , which revolves_around a traumatic eye operation that ultimately led to his marriage but , as with all Gray ' s kaleidoscopic tales , gets_into the myriad nooks_and_crannies of his life . Back at SCR the rest of the Mainstage season features a world_premiere of Richard Greenberg ' s &quot; Night and Her Stars &quot; ( March 4-April 3 ) and revivals of Peter Shaffer ' s &quot; Lettice &amp; Lovage &quot; ( April 15-May 15 ) and Brian Friel ' s &quot; Dancing at Lughnasa. &quot; The theater_company is particularly high on the new Greenberg play , as might be expected for a commissioned work . But SCR producing artistic director David Emmes speaks_of it as &quot; a breakthrough &quot; for Greenberg on a par with &quot; Prelude to a Kiss , &quot; which launched Craig Lucas on a huge trajectory . Greenberg had another play done at SCR with mixed results ( &quot; The Extra Man &quot; in 1991 ) and is_best known for &quot; Eastern Standard , &quot; which premiered in Seattle and went_to Broadway as the quintessential play about Manhattan yuppies of the ' 80s . In &quot; Night and Her Stars &quot; Greenberg reaches back to the ' 50s for a look_at the TV quiz show scandals that catapulted people like Charles Van Doren to fame and , as it turned_out , lured them into ethical quicksand . On SCR ' s Second Stage the rest of the season will offer &quot; Someone Who ' ll Watch Over Me &quot; ( March 8-April 17 ) , a hostage drama by Frank McGuinness that was nominated for a Tony Award on Broadway last year , and a still-unnamed play in the final slot ( April 26-May 29 ) . The big summer events for Shakespeare Orange County will be Thomas F . Bradac ' s staging of &quot; King Lear &quot; with Alan Mandell , one of the Southland ' s premiere classical actors , in the title_role . SOC also will do &quot; Twelfth Night. &quot; Both plays will be produced at Chapman University ' s Waltmar Theatre , dates to be announced . We haven ' t forgotten Evita and Annie . The Fullerton Civic Light_Opera promises &quot; Evita &quot; ( Feb . 18-March 6 ) for Plummer Auditorium , along with &quot; Annie &quot; ( May 13-29 ) and &quot; The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas &quot; ( July 15-31 ) . FCLO producer Griff Duncan also says the company will stage another outdoor summer season of three plays -- one musical , one comedy and one drama -- at the Muckenthaler Center , with titles to be announced . Also in Fullerton , the Vanguard Theatre Ensemble opens the year tonight with the Michael Cristofer ' s &quot; The Shadow Box , &quot; ( through Feb . 5 ) , followed by John Olive ' s &quot; Voice of the Prairie &quot; ( March 2-April 2 ) ; Timberlake Wertenbaker ' s &quot; The Love of the Nightingale &quot; ( April 27-May 28 ) ; &quot; Talley ' s Folley &quot; ( June 29-July 30 ) ; Ruth and Augustus Goetz ' s &quot; The Heiress &quot; ( Sept . 7-Oct . 5 ) ; and Arthur Miller ' s &quot; The Crucible &quot; ( Oct . 26-Dec . 1 ) Vanguard , which is entering its third season this year , recently incorporated as a not-for-profit institution and has already made its mark as one of the county ' s prime storefront theaters . But another storefront operation , the three-year-old Backstage Theatre in Costa Mesa , will fold at the end of January , following Terrence McNally ' s &quot; Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune &quot; ( tonight through Jan . 30 ) . &quot; We ' re closing_up here at the end of that run , &quot; Backstage producer Al Valletta said , adding that he hopes to stage shows in Los Angeles instead .</TEXT>
