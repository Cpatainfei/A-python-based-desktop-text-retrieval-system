   <HEADLINE> IT ' S TIME OF THE SEASON FOR HAY_FEVER VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s hay_fever season again . But you hardly need to be reminded if you ' re among the estimated 20 % of Americans with pollen allergies . That means eyeballs that itch , noses that run and stuffed-up heads that feel about ready to explode . The symptoms probably showed_up in the San Fernando Valley during the past couple of weeks , brought_on by the recent spell of unusually warm and sometimes windy weather . So far , allergy experts say the pollen levels in the air are normal for this time_of_year . But it is still early and for many people the worst is yet to come . Even so , this year ' s sneezing season may turn_out to be milder than last year ' s . The heavy winter rains last year made trees and plants grow like crazy . By comparison , this past winter was dry . &quot; As near as I can tell , it looks_like a normal hay_fever season , &quot; said Zeb Dyer , an allergy researcher at the Santa Barbara Medical Foundation Clinic . &quot; But it all depends_on the weather from here on out . &quot; Rain would help wash some of these pollens out of the air , &quot; he said . &quot; But if we have a lot of dry , windy days dispersing pollen all_over the place , there are going_to be a lot of sick people. &quot; Some allergy sufferers are having a harder_time of it this year because of the Northridge earthquake . Aftershocks from the Jan . 17 temblor continue to kick_up lots of dust to irritate already sore noses . Dr. Donald L . Unger , an allergist who practices in Thousand Oaks , added that molds , growing in damp cracks of quake-damaged homes and offices , are also a problem . &quot; Several of my patients who are mold-sensitive are having a heck of a time , &quot; Unger said . Currently , pollinating trees are the biggest problem for most people , especially the Arizona_cypress , coast_live_oak and olive . But far more hay_fever sufferers are allergic to pollen manufactured by grasses , such_as false_ragweed and other relatives of the best-known hay_fever producer , Bermuda_grass , Timothy grass and fescue . And grasses won ' t begin pollinating in_earnest for another couple of weeks . By then , &quot; people with asthma will also be having more symptoms , &quot; said Dr. Wayne E . Imber , an Encino allergist . He and other allergy experts say the best thing a sufferer can do is identify the source of the problem and try to avoid it . Other survival tips : Stay indoors if possible during the early morning and afternoon hours , when pollen levels are highest . If you have to go outside at those times , change clothes when you get home and wash your hair to get_rid_of pollen . Use an air conditioner indoors with a good filter . Imber said many hay_fever sufferers can get_through the season with non-prescription remedies , such_as eyedrops , antihistamines and nasal sprays . If those don ' t work , other allergists recommend several relatively new prescription antihistamines that are non-sedating , including Seldane , Hismanal and Claritin . There also are new prescription steroid nasal sprays that work well without the serious side_effects of other medicines containing steroids . If all else fails , allergy shots are probably the answer . The shots , initially once a week then with decreasing frequency for at least six months , almost always work . &quot; According to the literature , they ' re 90 % effective , &quot; Imber said .
