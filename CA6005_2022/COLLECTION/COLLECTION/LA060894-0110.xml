   <HEADLINE> COLLEGE BINGE DRINKING SOARS , STUDY FINDS ; ALCOHOL : THE NUMBER OF FEMALE ABUSERS IS FOUND TO HAVE RISEN SIGNIFICANTLY . PANEL RECOMMENDS A CAMPAIGN TO DEGLAMORIZE CAMPUS CONSUMPTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> America ' s colleges are witnessing a &quot; startling &quot; increase in binge drinking , particularly among women , and as_many as one in three students qualify as alcohol abusers , according to a study released Tuesday by a Columbia University panel . Noting that widespread drinking leads to violence , vandalism and declining academic performance , the report issued by Columbia ' s Center_on Addiction and Substance_Abuse calls_for campus campaigns to deglamorize alcohol . Alcohol_abuse is rampant on campuses across the country , even though about three-fourths of college_students are below the legal drinking_age , the report notes . The percentage of college women who deliberately consume enough alcohol to get drunk has soared from 10 % in 1977 to 35 % last year , according to the study , conducted by the Center ' s Commission on Substance_Abuse at Colleges and Universities . Binge drinking -- defined as the consumption of more_than five cans of beer or five glasses of wine at a single sitting -- is practiced by 50 % of all students . Among college women , the percentage has increased from 14 % to 37 % over the last 15 years , the study says . Women drinkers are more at risk than their male counterparts because sex-based differences in metabolism tend to cause them to become intoxicated after drinking smaller quantities of alcohol . &quot; Once thought_of as a male rite of passage , alcohol_abuse has now become a woman ' s rite of passage , &quot; said Pamela Ann Rymer , a federal appeals court judge and a member of the Columbia commission . &quot; Yet drinking to get drunk . . . can destroy the lives of the best and the brightest of our young women. &quot; &quot; This prevalence of binge drinking has devastating consequences , &quot; added Father Edward A . Malloy , president of the University of Notre Dame and chairman of the commission . An estimated 90 % of all campus rapes involve drinking on the part of the assailant , the victim , or both , the report says . And some 60 % of women who contract sexually transmitted diseases , including AIDS , are under the influence of alcohol when they have_intercourse . Center President Joseph A . Califano Jr . said that young_women feel more pressure today to compete with men , even in self-destructive activities such_as drinking . &quot; It ' s the worst aspect of the macho world , &quot; he said . College_students spend an estimated $ 5.5 billion a year on beer , wine and liquor -- more_than their combined outlays for books and all other beverages , the report says . On a typical campus , per capita student spending on alcohol is $ 446 a year . The study indicated that collegians tend to drink more_than young people who do not attend college . For example , 42 % of college_students reported that they had engaged in binge drinking at some point during the preceding two weeks , compared to 33 % of non-college youth . White male college_students were the heaviest drinkers , averaging nine drinks per week , or roughly twice the amount consumed by white females . Black students on predominantly white schools drank far less , the study indicates . Academically , alcohol is a downer , the study reported : 40 % of students with academic problems drink too_much and alcohol is a factor_in 28 % of dropout cases . &quot; Alcohol . . . is a stumbling_block to academic success , &quot; said Malloy . &quot; We must recognize that alcohol_abuse is a debilitating , not a liberating , experience and we must work together to deglamorize it. &quot; The commission proposed a series of steps to change campus attitudes about alcohol_abuse , including increased education on the problem and coordinated strategies involving faculty , alumni , parents and students . It suggested a national &quot; Alcohol Awareness Index &quot; to rate colleges and universities on how well they address alcohol problems . The index would be published in college catalogues and national college guides . The panel advocated a ban on alcohol-related advertising and promotions , along with strict regulation of drinking at campus functions . It called_for a change in the Campus Security Act of 1990 to require that crime reports specify if alcohol_abuse was involved .</TEXT>
