   <HEADLINE> SAILING THE SAN JUANS ; HAUL AWAY ! ; FOR $ 500 APIECE , 20 NOVICES CHARTERED A 127-FOOT SCHOONER , LEARNED THE LINGO , HOISTED THE SAILS AND HAD A GRAND ADVENTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Before daybreak the last damp hawser is heaved aboard and coiled on deck . The sailing schooner Zodiac eases out of the sleeping harbor and ghosts through a chilly drizzle toward the Strait of Juan de Fuca where the wind blows . We crinkle in stiff nylon foul-weather_gear as we move across plank and tar deck . Zodiac is the largest sailing_vessel of its kind on the West Coast , 127 feet long . It is celebrating its 70th birthday afloat . And for this blustery spring week the Zodiac is ours as we roam the blue-black waters , the narrow channels , the open straits , rain-forested shores and sheltered harbors of Washington ' s San Juan Islands . Here with bald_eagles , dolphins , harlequin ducks , seals , sculpted cliffs , tide pools , spicy fresh air and towering cedars , 20 friends , acquaintances and distant friends-of-friends have taken a flyer on each other and a small-time , big-boat operation . We took_a_chance with the weather too . Springtime in these waters between Vancouver Island , British_Columbia , and the Washington mainland is windy . But wind hereabouts spells weather -- so we ' re swaddled in gloves and long johns . Those who follow us on Zodiac later in summer will lounge along in their shorts and tank_tops . But they are unlikely to receive our reward : flying_on the wing of a gale in a tall ship sailed well . How well ? Doggone well , if you please . And to our astonishment , we ' re doing_it pretty much on our own . Some of us are small_boat sailors ; many had never hoisted a line until four days ago when we gathered aboard at Bellingham , two hours north of Seattle . Never mind . A 200-ton schooner is a life apart from a small_boat . We ' re all novices at this . But the spirit has seized us . In the name of hard play , we practice and learn . And nature favors us , delivering light winds for the first days . So while we work , we can absorb the scenery of this lovely nest of islands , venturing as the wind blows us from secluded anchorages to busy port towns . In ages ranging from our mid-30s to early-60s , we stand daylight watches by the bells , set the sails and work the tacks -- and whoop_it_up like college kids at the end of the day . Zodiac ' s crew of nine , including three men with captain ' s licenses , supervises us with self-assurance . But sometimes with urgency . Using our backs and tired hands and newly sharpened eyes , we now fathom the ancient working and lilt of schooner sailing -- turning the huge spindled helm and hauling , coiling , flaking , adjusting and making fast the ship ' s quarter-mile spider_web of heavy lines , matching Zodiac ' s cloud of canvas to the twisting channels and shifting winds of island navigation . Each of us now feels a swell of confidence , a hardness in our muscles , an uplift of exuberance as we slip_away on this work-a-day Wednesday morning into exposed waters south of the islands where the north Pacific reaches its finger into the American continent . A diesel_engine has taken us clear of the picturesque harbor at nearby Victoria , British_Columbia , where we made an overnight side trip . Usually , we ' re not underway until mid-morning . But today , as we gulp steaming mugs of coffee , and , I confess , wrestle here and there with a touch of that old sailor ' s curse , the hangover , we are happy to rise before the sun . Today , we are hunting for wind . Sailing stations ! . . . On the peak halyard , haul_away ! . . . Avast ! . . . That is_well , make_it fast . . . Come_up from behind . . . The patois of the ancient mariner is no longer so strange . First we hoist the 4 # 000-square-foot mainsail , almost the size of a basketball_court . Everyone lines_up tug-of-war style and pulls on twin , two-inch-thick rope halyards to the old sailing chantey , &quot; Two-Six Ho. &quot; The sail creeps_up the towering fir mast with unbearable slowness , and sweaty wisps of steam rise from inside our waterproof pants and jackets . There are no winches on Zodiac . Then the smaller foresail is raised on the shorter mast forward , not an easy task either . By now , our wind_off the southern tip of Vancouver Island is brisk and the dawn sky breaks wet and lumpy gray . One of us is stationed on the five-foot spoked helm to hold Zodiac pointed into the breeze and keep pressure off the huge spread of canvas . Next , the staysail , and finally , the jib are set . Arms ache . Hearts pound . There is now 7 # 000 square_feet of sail aloft , loose and cracking nervously in the wind . Capt . Tim Mehrer , a sanguine native of these waters who has commanded Zodiac for 20 years , orders the helm spun over . The ship bears_off , her sails filling with a deep whuh-thunk . Sheet lines squeak taut . Wooden pulley blocks rattle and tense . The 13-inch-thick , wood-plank hull heaves into five-foot chop with a melodic groaning and creaking . This is the song known to seafarers as the working of a wooden ship . The disappearing music of our heritage . There are no real ocean swells reaching this far into the Strait of Juan de Fuca , and Zodiac does not bob or roll in the chop like a smaller sailboat -- the sensation that induces seasickness . Instead , she powers through the open water at 13 knots , her massive deck lifting and falling dramatically , or so it seems to us , but so slowly , so heavily that only one or two aboard feel any queasiness . At first I can see a_couple_of faces fixed with that pale , uncomfortable , oh-ho look . But this passes quickly with the immense excitement and laborious maneuvers necessary to execute long , rounding tacks from one broad reach to another . Patrick Kerns , the 290-pound , pigtailed itinerant tall-ship sailor who is our bosun and mate , covers the deck in big strides , his wet , bristly face aglow with a fierce smile . In a hoarse growl , he offers us praise and encouragement . &quot; That was a tack ! Well done . That was how it ' s done ! &quot; It is warm and dry below , but no one leaves the deck . There will be time for that later . Good wind over a good ship is rhapsody . Except for a single passing freighter , we are alone at_sea in what mariners call a fresh_gale . To the starboard , the snowy Olympic mountains peek through steely layers of clouds . Off the port , the silhouette of the San Juans fills the horizon and dead ahead a black squall_line of a storm gathers . * There are many reasons to come_to this popular vacation region . Sailing is one of the best . We find ourselves making a circle through the San Juans , counterclockwise , starting in the remote north . Up here , the San Juans are a necklace of small , unoccupied islands -- Patos , Sucia , Matia , Clark -- designated as state marine parks , reachable only by watercraft . A day ' s sail away is lovely , finger-narrow Reid Harbor at Stuart Island , part state park and part sleepy rural homestead . Not far away is the resort village and marina of Roche Harbor on heavily developed San Juan Island . Here is a 150-year-old inn with nostalgic hospitality and the kind of guests who can appreciate the silhouette of a big schooner looming through the front window of the bar . The port of Victoria has every bit the feel of the islands , although it is not part of them . There are few feelings to match arriving here in a sailing_ship . But today we traverse the southern reach of the islands , ducking out of the winds to clear U.S. Customs at Friday Harbor , the largest community and chief tourist destination in the San Juans . Even in the off-season , the port is a bustle of fishermen and yachts and seaplanes and day visitors who have come_by ferry . By acclamation , we on the Zodiac decide to limit our shore_leave to only one hour , preserving the afternoon for more sailing . Our departure proves to be a false start . A late head-count shows us one person short . Dave Early , a Zodiac crewman , has slipped ashore to make a phone_call . We double_back through the crowded harbor . And as he races down the long dock to meet us , a crowd gathers . We break_out kazoos and pipe him aboard , red-faced , to the tune of &quot; Anchor ' s Away. &quot; The crowd cheers . Outside the harbor , our gale has diminished to a gentle_breeze , which we leisurely ride toward the very southernmost tip of the San Juans to a bay on Lopez Island where British Capt . George Vancouver anchored 202 years ago during his exploration of these islands . Off in the distance , the lights of Seattle glow orange against the clouds . A gentle rain begins , and we scamper to the warmth below . * I feel particular satisfaction . Five months ago , I was stirred by the sight of a big schooner as it pulled_away from the dock at Bellingham , Wash . On its stern was the name Zodiac . Inquiring on the waterfront in Seattle , where I live , I learned it is the largest of fewer than a half-dozen charter schooners on the West Coast . Later , I tracked_down Mehrer and his father , Karl -- both schoonermen who make their living in the industrial boiler business and devote the rest of their time to preserving historic sailing_ships . The Zodiac , they explained over lunch , is maintained by 60 or so volunteers . Almost nobody could afford to pay workers to keep_up such a ship . The volunteers take their turns as crew during the spring-to-fall sailing season , then help with refurbishment during winter . When at_sea , only the cook is paid . It turned_out that for all their seafaring skills , the Mehrers were not much in the way of high-powered marketers , and happily so . Their clientele came from people like me who happen along , the curious , and then by word_of_mouth . But there was a catch to the charter . Since they were a small operation , they accepted only groups , no singles or couples . For a six-night , five-day , cruise , I would have to assemble a full compliment of 20 guests -- we would need that many to lift the sails and handle the boat . Impossible , I thought . But I scratched down the costs on a cocktail napkin : 20 people at $ 500 apiece , plus tax , would cover the charter , including all food . Hmm . Maybe not so impossible after all -- a hotel_room and food for six days could easily run more . I set myself a deadline of 30 days . I called and wrote_about 30 friends and acquaintances , some of whom I ' d known a lifetime and others who I just met . I told them to pass the word to their friends . If I had 20 checks within a month , I ' d confirm the charter . Otherwise , I would drop the idea . Two weeks later , I was turning people away . From New York , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Canada and Seattle , my friends and their friends took the dare . Our group was born . And we spent the next months in exquisite anticipation , sharing books and seafaring movies , planning and daydreaming . We wrote and called and talked ourselves into a froth . But I worried : Had I oversold the venture ? How would 10 men and 10 women , some married and some single but all set_in their ways , adapt to the loss of privacy of dormitory sleeping ? Or to sharing three heads and two showers ? What if the wind failed us ? What if it rained every day ? What if the food was lousy ? I send a warning letter : Prepare for everything . This is the Northwest . With bulging sea bags , we boarded on Friday afternoon at Bellingham ' s ferry terminal and motored to a nearby cove . Robin Clark of Manhattan Beach , Calif. , brought his songbook and lyric voice . Ross Anderson of Seattle brought a guitar . We sang . Chef JoAnn Perna of Creswell , Ore. , produced the first of a steady offering of galley feasts -- dinners that included salmon , pasta primavera with calamari , Mexican fajitas and breakfasts such_as blueberry beer pancakes . We gorged ourselves . Up from the stowage locker came fresh-from-the-keg bitter ale from Seattle ' s Red Hook brewery and cases of assorted Washington wine . We drank . In the morning , we sailed off the anchor without starting the engine -- a showy accomplishment for us novices . Likewise , we sailed the next afternoon into the San Juans to Sucia Island Marine State Park and anchored without need of engine power , a feat that even small-boat sailors rarely attempt in these tight , shoal waters . We launched one of our two tenders to take a dozen hikers ashore to explore the island park . Others of us traded turns exploring coves with the two kayaks we brought aboard . Who could count all_the eagles and seals and sea_birds and dolphins ? We gathered_in the soft light of the great wood salon below deck and staffers Tim and Karl told us about this ship , registered as a national historic vessel -- built as a trans-oceanic pleasure yacht for the founders of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Co . and later turned_into a bar pilot schooner off of San Francisco . And every night , again and again , I ' m pleased to report , I listened to the same thundering toast : to my own dumb luck or gifted foresight , whichever , for taking_a_chance on a schooner and a gang of disparate pals . Here , here . We had sailed in glorious waters , unhurried and with friendship snugged down by a new dependence on one another and by unexpected sentimentalism for an old wooden ship . And we vowed , we would sail the Zodiac again . GUIDEBOOK A Schooner in the San Juans Schooner Zodiac : Tim , Karl and June Mehrer , P.O.
