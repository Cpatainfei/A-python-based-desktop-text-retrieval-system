   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : ROUND OF 16 ; ITALIANS COME BACK FROM THE PRECIPICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you should wonder , Italy is dancing today to the jerky , heart-shaking beat of an unsettling new band , the Grateful Undead . It plays two hit numbers , &quot; Man Short , &quot; and &quot; Brinkmanship. &quot; &quot; It seems our destiny to suffer , &quot; Coach Arrigo Sacchi said with a sigh . &quot; We fell_behind , 1-0 , and that made_it very difficult . Then -- worse -- we were playing with 10 men and sometimes nine . If you think_about it that way , to win was almost heroic. &quot; If you think_of it another way , for 88 minutes , Nigeria ' s Super Eagles laid it to a misfiring flight of high-priced Italians who more resembled flailing butterflies . The game was all but over . Italy was heading_home in well-merited disgrace , bound surely to what Antonio Matarrese , that nation ' s soccer federation president , said would have been &quot; summary_judgment &quot; as one of the 1994 Cup ' s top underachievers . Then Roberto Baggio limped to the rescue . The lame man kicked . The fat lady sang . &quot; We saw an Italy that doesn ' t ever give_up , &quot; Matarrese said , mirroring national wonder at the latest exploits of the Gang That Should Be Gone . &quot; It shows strength of character in difficult moments. &quot; Even before the final whistle , the Italian press had discovered a -- you guessed it -- &quot; Miracle in Foxboro. &quot; &quot; It ' s Enough to Drive You Crazy , &quot; says one of Italy ' s sports newspapers in a banner headline this morning . &quot; Victory was two minutes too far , &quot; Nigerian Coach Clemens Westerhof said . &quot; We were not afraid . Italy was lucky. &quot; Sacchi didn ' t see it that way , patrolling the sidelines with enough vigor and nervous energy to bring FIFA officials to restrain him within the chalk-marked coaching box . &quot; I feel lucky , but also unlucky , &quot; Sacchi said after a fretful overtime victory , Italy ' s second triumph while playing a man short . &quot; I felt in those last few minutes that we might be out , and it didn ' t feel just . We deserved to win . We were better. &quot; Sacchi said Italy set the pace and the tenor of the game against a strong , tall and superbly conditioned Nigerian team . &quot; We took_control in the beginning and won that way , &quot; Sacchi said . &quot; Strong will and determination prevailed. &quot; To many in the largely Italy-cheering crowd , though , as well as_to commentators in Rome , the Azzurri looked listless , playing fitfully . &quot; The players seemed perplexed and disappointed , &quot; commentator Bruno Pizzul said . &quot; We were facing the prospect of being pushed_out of the Cup without a trace . Then the team miraculously got itself back on its feet . It ' s a day we won ' t easily forget , for they made us fear the worst. &quot; Said former Italian national Coach Enzio Berazot , &quot; I ' ve never seen a team so open_to attack as Nigeria , but Italy only got_through by chance. &quot; Sacchi , who tried six dozen of Italy ' s premier players before settling_on the 22 to bring_to the Cup , has been criticized for his team ' s lack of spark . In the first round , Italy beat Norway , tied Mexico and lost to Ireland , managing only two goals in the process and finishing third in its group . On Tuesday it was equally disappointing -- right up until the moment it became breathtaking . &quot; In the last minutes Italy seemed resigned , then Baggio turned the game upside-down , &quot; said Azeglio Vicini , coach of the Italian team that finished third in the 1990 Cup . Baggio , one of the world ' s best strikers , had a lackluster first round , going scoreless and complaining of an Achilles ' heel problem that had him limping again Tuesday . &quot; It was 90 minutes of suffering , but it was a good game , &quot; he said . &quot; On offense , if we don ' t have a chance to score it seems like we are not doing anything , but we were trying . I don ' t get many chances early , but then at the end of the game I was able to put the ball where I wanted to . Now that I have scored , I feel much better. &quot; There were moments deep in the second_half when it seemed even to his teammates as if Baggio could not run any further . But his first tournament goal , as pretty as it was late in coming , lent him wings . Said the affable Sacchi , &quot; I ' m not lying when I say that Baggio is great . He loosened_up after the goal and then he was extraordinary. &quot; Says the Rome newspaper L ' Unita in its main headline this morning : &quot; At the 90th Minute , Baggio Liberates Everybody. &quot; Italian commentator Paolo Rossi , who led scorers in the 1982 Cup that Italy won , says Baggio ' s two goals Tuesday -- the second on a decisive penalty kick -- will prove pump-priming . &quot; Baggio needs to unblock himself by scoring , &quot; Rossi said . Having now fashioned ( or simply endured ) two improbable man-short victories , Sacchi left Foxboro Stadium a wiser_man Tuesday . &quot; Soccer is a game you never stop learning . You think you have seen it all and then . . . &quot; He smiled , borrowing a phrase from Italian soap_opera announcers , &quot; On to the next episode. &quot;</TEXT>
