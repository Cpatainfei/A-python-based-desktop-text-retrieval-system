   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEW ; ' JIHAD IN AMERICA ' PROBES RADICAL GROUPS IN U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If the weapon of choice of many Islamic terrorists is the AK-47 rifle , the favored weapon of anti-terrorists seems to be the camcorder . Running_through Steven Emerson ' s hourlong report , &quot; Jihad in America , &quot; is a chilling string of video clips showing radical Islamic fundamentalists , organizers and terrorists urging followers to wage a holy war against Jews , Christians and America . Nothing surprising here -- only that the speeches were delivered in America , where , Emerson charges , a growing network linked with key Middle East-based terrorist groups such_as Hezbollah and Hamas continues to elude U.S. law_enforcement . The safety of speech and religious freedom is the ironic reason , say law_enforcement officials who speak_to Emerson , that the FBI cannot round_up those fomenting Jihad ( or holy war ) and those networked with the convicted bombers in the 1993 World Trade Center attack . Perhaps , but it seems to be a weak alibi in the light of decades ' worth of very effective FBI harassment and arrests against many militants of the left and right . The real reason police don ' t go_after Jihad ' s supporters in this country isn ' t explored here . Emerson begins his story with a beat-by-beat explanation of the growth of Islamic militancy -- with the careful caveat that this represents a fringe of the Islamic faith . CIA funding of Islamic forces against the Soviet_Union in Afghanistan began a groundswell of confidence and money and arms for fundamentalists . An offshoot of this confidence was the Al-Kifah Support Network , based in Brooklyn , where such leading voices of Jihad as Abdullah Azzam would speak and organize . It was here that the group responsible_for the World Trade Center bombing often met , but it ' s only one of more_than 30 militant Islamic groups in the United States , Emerson says . Despite denials by spokespeople , he identifies the Islamic Association for Palestine and the Islamic Committee for Palestine to be essentially the U.S. branches of terrorist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad , respectively . Emerson ' s reporting is dogged and more_than slightly gutsy ( how in the world did he obtain that videotape ? ) , and makes a clear case that U.S. officials will be butting heads with the Constitution before they butt heads with terrorists . * &quot; Jihad in America &quot; airs 10 p.m. tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 .
