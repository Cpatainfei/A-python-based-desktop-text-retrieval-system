   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; A KILLER ' S SANITY MAY FREE HIM ; AFTER DAVID LEE NAGEL SLASHED HIS GRANDPARENTS , A GEORGIA JURY SENT HIM TO A HOSPITAL INSTEAD OF TO PRISON . BUT EXPERTS NOW SAY HE WAS NEVER MENTALLY ILL . SO THE STATE MUST RELEASE HIM -- OR DEFY THE LAW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By the spring of 1981 , the question of what to do with David Lee Nagel suggested a grim but unequivocal answer . Nagel had spent his adolescence bouncing among jails , youth camps and mental_hospitals . He had racked_up what the psychologists called a &quot; long history of antisocial behavior , &quot; meaning fights , breaking and entering , auto theft , fleeing the police and attacking a counselor . He had also , on the night of May 8 , 1981 , in this region about 70 miles southwest of Atlanta , stabbed his grandparents to death , apparently because they had denied him their car keys . When three state doctors soon after pronounced the 19-year-old sane , responsible_for his acts and competent to stand trial , the Troup County district_attorney did not hesitate . It was clear to him that Nagel should be executed . But the jurors at his murder trial thought otherwise . Exactly why they balked remains a matter of speculation . Perhaps they were swayed by Nagel ' s tenure in mental_institutions , or the vague references in his records to schizophrenia . Perhaps they shrank_from sending a frail teen-ager to the executioner . Or perhaps they could not imagine -- could not accept -- that anyone who was mentally sound could commit such an act of butchery . Whatever the reason , jurors on Dec . 2 , 1981 , found Nagel not_guilty by reason of insanity . For 13 years , the verdict didn ' t much matter ; Nagel , whom the court_ordered institutionalized , simply disappeared behind the bars of a maximum-security mental_hospital rather than a prison . Now the verdict does matter . Now the verdict means that Georgia faces the unappealing prospect of releasing a double killer -- or defying state mental_health laws and the U.S. Constitution . After years of caring for him , the state ' s top mental_health experts have concluded that David Nagel is not mentally_ill -- and in fact was never mentally_ill . &quot; Nagel does not meet the legal criteria for involuntary commitment to a mental_institution , &quot; declares forensic psychiatrist Dr. Everett Kuglar , acting superintendent of the Georgia Mental Health Institute . &quot; Nagel should be released. &quot; The U.S. Supreme Court may eventually agree . Two years ago , looking_at a patient much like Nagel , the justices said Louisiana could not continue to confine Terry Foucha once a mental_hospital decided that he showed no sign of mental_illness . The due_process clause of the 14th Amendment just won ' t allow it , the justices declared . You can ' t confine someone in a mental_hospital for what he ' s done_in the past , or might do_in the future , if he isn ' t mentally_ill . Like Nagel , Foucha -- found not_guilty by reason of insanity in an aggravated burglary case -- was diagnosed as having an &quot; antisocial personality &quot; and had a history of altercations while confined . Like Nagel , he may have suffered from a &quot; drug-induced psychosis &quot; at the time of his crime . Like Nagel , he could find no doctors willing to guarantee that he would not be dangerous in the future . No matter . &quot; As Foucha was not convicted , he may_not be punished , &quot; wrote Justice Byron R . White for the majority . &quot; Louisiana has by reason of his acquittal exempted Foucha from criminal responsibility. &quot; To Everett Kuglar , the Foucha decision makes obvious what must be done with Nagel . The state psychiatrist well understands the desire to confine a killer -- in fact , he believes Nagel should have been convicted of murder -- but he flatly declines the role of jailer . &quot; It ' s not our problem today what mistake the justice system made years ago , &quot; Kuglar said . &quot; If you can ' t get a jury to convict . . . well , that ' s it . It ' s not the business of a mental_hospital to retain people who aren ' t mentally ill. &quot; Georgia judges , however , don ' t see it that way . From the trial level to the state Supreme Court , they don ' t appear inclined to let Nagel go . A jury in its wisdom found Nagel insane , these judges proclaim , and we presume he continues to be insane . Nothing Nagel now offers proves otherwise ; nothing establishes that he will not turn violent again if released . &quot; Weighty as the medical experts ' testimony may be , &quot; Troup County Superior_Court Judge Allan B . Keeble observed in denying Nagel ' s release , &quot; this court must balance that testimony against the seriousness of ( Nagel ' s ) acts. &quot; The son of Nagel ' s victims puts the_matter more directly . &quot; I don ' t care what the psychiatrists say , &quot; declares Emmett Frank Marshall Jr. , who is Nagel ' s uncle . &quot; For what he done to my parents , I don ' t think he should ever be released. &quot; * There ' s little sympathy for Nagel here in Troup County . In small ways and large , he has tormented the region for much of his life . Coming from an abusive and broken family , he landed , at age 15 , in a Christian boys ' home , which soon asked that he be removed . Back in LaGrange , he spent four years in relatives ' homes and assorted institutions . &quot; He ' d get_into trouble , he ' d be real sorry , &quot; Emmett Marshall recalled . &quot; He ' d con you , telling you this sad story about how he was going_to straighten_out , wanted to do right . And for a while , he would do OK . But it would never last. &quot; No one felt able to deal with him : An exasperated high_school principal asked that Nagel withdraw after a_few weeks in class ; his grandparents said they feared him ; a youth detention camp counselor decided &quot; David needs constant institutionalization and therapy more_than any other kid I ' ve worked with. &quot; Nagel was clearly troubled , but was he mentally_ill ? Various Georgia doctors ' diagnoses never involved what physicians and state law define as mental_illness -- a &quot; disorder of thought or mood which significantly impairs judgment , behavior , capacity to recognize reality , or ability to cope_with the ordinary demands of life. &quot; Rather , Nagel was seen as a more familiar type : a highly disturbed adolescent , suffering from depression , anxiety , low frustration level and poor impulse control . Nagel also abused drugs . His perceived problems were what the doctors categorize as &quot; behavioral , &quot; not psychotic . As a result , the doctors treating Nagel never believed he justified involuntary commitment , which requires , among other things , a finding of mental_illness . Once the doctors stabilized Nagel , they felt they had to release him if and when he wished to go . that ' s what happened in December , 1980 . This time it was from the West Central Georgia Regional Hospital in Columbus . In early April , Nagel ' s mother , unable to deal with his drinking , drug_abuse and hostile behavior , sent him back to West Central . On April 23 , the hospital released him to his maternal grandparents , Frank Emmett Marshall Sr . and Mattie Louise Marshall . Two weeks later , Nagel stabbed his grandparents , cut their throats and dumped them in the countryside . Then he drove_around with two friends before renting a motel_room . Questioned the next day by LaGrange police , Nagel confessed , appearing calm and remorseless . He ' d been drinking and taking pills ( possibly PCP ) , he explained . Other_than that , he offered no motive . No transcript exists of Nagel ' s trial , only the memories of those few involved . Mack Reynolds , the young lawyer appointed by the court to defend Nagel in the only death_penalty case ever tried in Troup County , recalls that he could not even get his client ' s mother or minister to testify on his behalf . Nor could he call a medical expert to the stand , for the court provided no funds to hire one . All he had going_for him , to counter three state doctors ' testimony that the defendant was not mentally_ill , were the records from Nagel ' s 22-month stay_at a private Florida psychiatric_hospital in 1979-80 -- records that happen to include tenuous references_to &quot; pseudopsychopathic schizophrenia. &quot; This diagnosis -- which could be applied broadly to anyone a doctor thought might have some characteristics of a schizophrenic -- is no longer used anywhere , by anyone . In fact , the American Psychiatric Assn . dropped it as a recognized diagnosis in 1980 , the very year Nagel was being diagnosed , and a full year before his murder trial . &quot; It just was not reliable , certainly not for the legal_system , &quot; explains Dr. Robert Miller , chief psychiatrist for the Colorado Department of Corrections . &quot; It was way too subjective . There was no scientific evidence for its existence. &quot; Normally , the records containing this diagnosis would not have been admissible without testimony from Nagel ' s doctor in Florida . But the district_attorney -- aware travel funds were limited and apparently confident of a conviction -- stipulated their entry into evidence . That gave Reynolds a chance to talk_about them in his closing argument . &quot; Any good lawyer can testify better than an expert , &quot; Reynolds said recently . &quot; I can ' t exactly recall what the records said , but they supported my philosophy of the case . My philosophy of the case was , ' These murders were so horrible nobody in their right mind would have done that. ' &quot; The jurors apparently bought that theme , thereby riling much of Georgia . For weeks after the trial , outraged citizens bombarded Reynolds with hostile calls . At the next session of the state Legislature , politicians did_away_with the &quot; not_guilty by insanity &quot; category entirely , changing it to &quot; guilty but mentally ill. &quot; None of this altered Nagel ' s situation , of course . The task of confining him still fell to doctors and counselors , rather than wardens and prison_guards . More precisely , the task of confining Nagel eventually fell to Kuglar , who knows all too well what acts are within the realm of sane human behavior . * From the moment he met him in 1985 , Kuglar thought Nagel was not psychotic . Kuglar then was superintendent of the Georgia Regional Hospital in Augusta , where Nagel was confined . In a building full of psychotics , half of them schizophrenic , 90 % of them violent , most of them dazed and deluded , Nagel stood_out . So in time , Kuglar became well acquainted with him . What he saw was an angry , insecure young_man , full of guilt , the product of a chaotic family . What he saw , in other words , was not unusual for young_men in their 20s , at least not the ones who come Kuglar ' s way . Most admissions to adolescent units are there because of their behavior , not because they are mentally_ill . Nagel had a personality_disorder . Nagel most decidedly needed to stay_away_from liquor and drugs . Nagel undeniably had brutally killed two people . But to Kuglar , Nagel had nothing approaching the type of thought or mood disorder that defined mental_illness in Georgia . Where true psychotics such_as schizophrenics were withdrawn , detached and delusional , Nagel was direct , lucid , engaged . Possibly , he had killed his grandparents during a temporary drug-induced psychosis . But there had been no substances to abuse since , and no evidence of mental_disturbance . To meet the criteria for civil commitment , you had to be mentally_ill , and dangerous to yourself or others , and in need of involuntary inpatient treatment . You had to be all three of these . To Kuglar , Nagel just didn ' t meet these criteria . This conclusion pulled Kuglar into unfamiliar territory . For 35 years , he has straddled the Georgia mental_health and legal_systems , running hospitals while evaluating defendants for Georgia courts . More often than not , he is the state ' s expert , proclaiming a defendant competent to stand trial . More often than not , this judgment makes the prosecutor ' s case for conviction and prison . Now , this same judgment was making the case for Nagel ' s release . For several years in the 1980s , Kuglar didn ' t have to face such a difficult prospect . Nagel didn ' t want to leave the mental_hospital . The hospital meant security and structure ; the hospital protected him from the community ' s anger and his own demons . So Kuglar obliged him . Nagel received not anti-psychotic drugs or formal psychotherapy , but &quot; socialization &quot; -- a small part-time job , activities , recreation . In 1989 , he was transferred to Central State Hospital in Milledgeville , but Kuglar also ended_up at Central State that year , as medical director of the forensic services division . Joined now by Robert Storms , the senior forensic psychologist there , Kuglar talked regularly with Nagel , not in formal therapy sessions , but in hallways and offices , where Nagel worked buffing floors . Watching him write to female friends , weep when his mother made a rare visit , earnestly mull_over problems with the hospital staff , Kuglar and Storms grew to like Nagel . They liked him despite his occasional fights with other patients ; they liked him despite his occasional tendency to threaten escape , suicide or attacks on the staff . Kuglar and Storms didn ' t take the threats seriously . To them , Nagel was simply trying to manipulate his environment , as all people do . The fights meant even less to the doctors . In the Binion Building , Nagel had to deal with truly psychotic patients . Three times , he had ended_up in scuffles started by the other guy , and had been placed in seclusion . In one of those cases , a big guy sitting over in a corner working_on his delusions had finally decided Nagel was the_devil . It was very tough , Kuglar and Storms well knew , to keep your cool with some of these folks . Kuglar and Storms eventually concluded that Nagel not only wasn ' t psychotic , but in fact had never been . Schizophrenia and manic-depressive illnesses are primarily progressive . Nagel could not have been schizophrenic at age 19 , Kuglar reasoned , and now show no signs of the disease . Kuglar had known about 3 # 000 patients fairly well . He ' d never seen one do anything like that . Kuglar thought references in Nagel ' s record to pseudopsychopathic schizophrenia were &quot; nonsense terms &quot; -- part of a game played by therapists seeking insurance payments . Kuglar couldn ' t entirely condemn those who played that game . If you needed such a diagnosis to get funding so you could treat your patient , maybe such actions were justified . Justified -- but not accurate . By the fall of 1990 , Nagel wanted out . No longer did he desire the security of a mental_hospital . He wanted a hearing on whether he met commitment criteria . He wanted a lawyer . He wanted Kuglar ' s help . * When the Central State Hospital ' s Forensic Division Team convened in May , 1991 , to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of Nagel , all involved appreciated the difficult question they faced . Nagel had committed a heinous crime . He was in their words , &quot; impulsive , immature , naive , unpredictable , manipulative and somewhat antisocial. &quot; Nagel would fit well in most prison populations . His ability to function in the community was uncertain , since he had spent most of his life in institutions . He might return to liquor and drugs once his forced abstinence ended . Kuglar didn ' t think that would happen , but no one could guarantee . Was that to be used as a rationale to keep Nagel confined in a mental_hospital ? If so , how long could he be held ? On what basis ? On what basis would he get_out ? Did he first need to prove he would n ' t be dangerous in the future ? Wasn ' t that an insurmountable burden ? Wasn ' t that unconstitutional preventive detention ? Whatever his behavioral problems , Nagel was alert , concise and communicative . His insight and judgment were normal . He appeared to be in good contact with reality . The team ' s conclusions and recommendations were , in the end , unanimous : Nagel was not psychotic and therefore did not meet the criteria for continued hospitalization . The process for Nagel ' s release should be initiated in the courts . &quot; David Nagel is an easy one to live with , &quot; Kuglar said of this decision . &quot; It ' s not even close . I get some I don ' t sleep_over , I get some I feel torn about . David is not one of them. &quot; By September of 1991 , both Central State hospital and Nagel ' s attorney -- Torin Togut of the Georgia Legal Services_Program -- had filed petitions seeking a discharge hearing . In Georgia , release hearings must be conducted by the court that originally committed the patient . The trial_judge at Nagel ' s murder trial had retired and the prosecutor was working in Nevada . No matter -- on Oct . 17 , 1991 , Nagel , in pursuit of his freedom , returned to Troup County , to the scene of the slayings and his trial . The community was waiting . &quot; Hearing Thursday May Free Killer Nagel &quot; warned the banner headline atop Page One of the LaGrange Daily News . * With David Nagel once again in their midst , albeit shackled , it cannot be said that the citizens of Troup County were overly concerned with the fine points of Georgia mental_health laws or U.S. Supreme Court rulings . In truth , it mattered little to some whether or not Nagel was insane . &quot; I don ' t think there was ever anything wrong with David , &quot; the victims ' son Emmett Marshall told a reporter just before the hearing . &quot; He was just mean. &quot; Soon after , officers brought Nagel to the LaGrange courtroom in handcuffs and foot chains . No longer a frail , nervous youth , he sported a goatee , shoulder-length brown hair , and muscles derived from years of bodybuilding . Guards were everywhere , inspecting the courtroom and the 20 spectators , among them Nagel ' s mother . Ten years before , the state had argued Nagel sane and responsible , while the defense had argued him incompetent . Now these positions were reversed . Only Kuglar remained consistent . &quot; No , I don ' t think David meets the commitment criteria , &quot; he told the court . &quot; I don ' t think he ever met it , to be honest with you . . . . &quot; The focus this day was not on commitment criteria , however . The focus was_on Nagel ' s stormy , violent history . The hospital fights and threats that looked commonplace to the doctors looked_like danger signs to Judge Allen Keeble and the county district_attorney . And Kuglar could offer no guarantees to assuage them . &quot; I don ' t think David would present any harm to others in the near or immediate future , &quot; Kuglar explained . &quot; I doubt seriously if he would ever . . . . But then you want me to predict whether he will or not . . . . I can ' t predict that . . . . &quot; Our feelings about the release are not based on the fact that we think David has been very perfect . It ' s based on the fact that we don ' t think he has a mental_illness that meets the state ' s criteria for continued hospitalization . Now , what he may do when he gets_out , I don ' t know . . . . But I have strong feelings that anything he does , he will not be doing_it because of mental_illness . He will be doing_it because he made a choice to do so. &quot; After listening to such comments all morning , Judge Keeble felt compelled to step_in . Intentionally or not , he began to lead Kuglar through a field full of legal land_mines . &quot; As best I can understand what you ' re saying is that in your opinion , Mr. Nagel has no serious mental problem now and never has had any ? &quot; Keeble asked . &quot; that ' s my opinion , Your Honor. &quot; &quot; So I assume , then , that it would be your opinion that those 12 Troup County jurors in 1981 who found him not_guilty by reason of insanity made a mistake ? &quot; &quot; Yes , sir. &quot; Kuglar -- all jowls and wrinkles , gruff and blunt , with no taste for small_talk or testing the political currents -- had managed to trample a bit on the concept that a jury ' s verdict establishes a legal verity . In doing so , it would emerge later , he had also managed to trample on the Georgia Supreme Court ' s sensibilities . But at this moment , Judge Keeble , low-key and reserved of manner , looked more perplexed than triumphant at where he had led the doctor . &quot; It seems , &quot; Keeble said , &quot; very difficult for me to look_at the situation in which an individual essentially butchers his grandparents . . . without concluding . . . that such an act could only have occurred had the person been abnormal in some respects from a mental standpoint . . . . From a lay standpoint , for a person to do this kind of thing he has to be mentally ill. &quot; If only that were so , Kuglar thought . If only sane people didn ' t do brutal things . Out loud , he said : &quot; Those people who think that have not had firsthand experience with what severe abuse of some of these drugs would do. &quot; The judge digested this comment . Watching from his seat , even Nagel ' s attorney Togut sensed Keeble was trying to be fair . This judge had a reputation in Togut ' s office as being the best in the circuit . No judge in this circumstance , Togut believed , could handle the case differently . Certainly no judge who lived_in Troup County . &quot; Assuming you are correct , &quot; Keeble continued , &quot; and the jury made a mistake . . . there is nothing we can do about that . that ' s a legal fact at this point . . . . One of the things that I guess concerns me most is that in April of 1981 someone came_to the very same conclusion that you have . . . And less than a month after that ( Nagel ) murdered two people. &quot; Kuglar would n ' t budge ; the lawyers in Georgia , having failed to confine Nagel , could not so easily ask the doctors to do so . &quot; Your honor . . . , &quot; he said , &quot; it is not the business of mental_hospitals to keep retained those people who might be dangerous if they do not have the mental_illness . The mental_illness has to be there first. &quot; Faced with this enduring conflict between the interests of the community and the concerns for individual rights , Keeble and Kuglar ' s revealing exchange finally reached an impasse . &quot; OK , &quot; the judge said . &quot; that ' s all_the questions I have. &quot; * In the end , Kuglar ' s efforts just didn ' t wash . Despite the medical experts ' testimony , despite the failure of the state to offer any contrary medical opinion , despite the U.S. Supreme Court ' s Foucha decision , Judge Keeble , in denying Nagel ' s release , ruled that &quot; his acts of butchering can only be described as depraved and senseless. &quot; Once a defendant is determined to be insane and to meet the criteria for civil commitment , by state law &quot; this condition is presumed_to continue. &quot; The Superior_Court , and not mental_health professionals , &quot; has the responsibility for deciding applications for release. &quot; Before &quot; this court can conclude that Nagel is sane , &quot; there must be &quot; at least a better than even_chance that his condition will persist. &quot; The Georgia Supreme Court , ruling on appeal last spring , went even further than Keeble . Where Keeble at least acknowledged the medical experts , the high_court flatly said Kuglar and Storms ' testimony &quot; deserved no weight whatsoever. &quot; By law the jury ' s verdict established Nagel ' s mental_illness , &quot; so the issue to be determined was whether Nagel ' s sanity had been restored , &quot; not &quot; whether the jury had made a mistake. &quot; Kuglar and Storms were , in_effect , &quot; attempting to impeach the original verdict of the jury. &quot; The Georgia Supreme Court ' s ruling will not be the last word in the_matter of David Nagel . In July , Nagel ' s attorney Togut filed a habeas_corpus petition in U.S. District Court . As he moves the case from the state to the federal legal_system , Togut will press a number of legally substantive arguments . He will cite the Foucha vs . Louisiana decision . He will quote Justice Leah Sears-Collins , the solitary dissenter on the seven-person Georgia high_court , who argued that her colleagues have created a &quot; Catch-22 &quot; in which Nagel , to prevail , would have to &quot; convince a psychiatrist to testify falsely . . . that the jury reached the correct result. &quot; He will talk_of preventive detention and insurmountable obstacles and the 14th Amendment . Most fundamentally , he will plead for &quot; the principle of law &quot; to prevail . Whether or not these arguments succeed , the question of what to do with Nagel promises to continue to haunt Georgia much as it has for the past 15 years . The state , after all , has no satisfactory solution . Everyone involved knows Nagel belongs neither at_large , nor in a mental_hospital ; Nagel belongs in prison . But Georgia can ' t put him there . As he considered that notion one recent afternoon , Everett Kuglar sat at his desk , staring out a window at a rolling lawn at the Georgia Mental Health Institute in Atlanta . &quot; Weightless , &quot; the justices had called his opinion . What should he have done , lie ? Agree that a person &quot; must be crazy &quot; to commit brutal murders ? That Nagel once was mentally_ill ? That the jury got_it right ? &quot; If society doesn ' t like the laws , change it , &quot; Kuglar rumbled . &quot; If society wants a person to spend the same number of years in a mental_hospital as he would have in prison , then say so . Don ' t have the law say that as soon as a person doesn ' t meet commitment criteria , he gets_out , then use ruses and quirks to keep him in. &quot; Finally , though , Kuglar had to agree the_matter was not all that simple . Yes , he understood why most people were happy that Nagel remained confined ; yes , he understood why Emmett Marshall ' s wife would say : &quot; We ' re scared right now . It ' s scary he could get out. &quot; Hell , he didn ' t know if Nagel was dangerous . In truth , Kuglar allowed , he probably would have been the state ' s star witness in 1981 ; if called to testify , he would have made the case for conviction and prison , if not the death_penalty . Of course , that also meant he would not have made the case for a mental_hospital . The obvious , perplexing irony of his position left Kuglar shaking his head . Usually , responsibility was his watchword ; usually , it was the defense_attorney who opposed him , not the state . Falling silent , Kuglar turned his chair , his back now to his visitors , his mind now on a jury ' s 13-year-old verdict -- the inescapable , irreducible predicament at the heart of the Nagel affair . &quot; David should have been convicted and sentenced , &quot; Kuglar said finally . &quot; But that ' s not what happened . that ' s just not what happened. &quot;</TEXT>
