   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON AIDS ; HOW HUMAN BEHAVIOR WOKE THE VIRAL SCOURGE ; IT IS NOT A MORAL JUDGMENT TO FIND THAT THE GAY SEXUAL REVOLUTION HAD MUCH TO DO WITH MAKING AN EPIDEMIC .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If HIV and AIDS are indeed old killers , then one final , explosive question remains : Why did a virus that was confined to a tiny ecological niche suddenly burst into global pandemic ? In her forthcoming book , &quot; The Coming Plague , &quot; Newsday reporter Laurie Garrett outlines a crucial phase needed to transform a low level of virus into the outright epidemic phase she calls &quot; amplification. &quot; Some thing or things have to happen to force a microbe out of its previously placid ecological hole and stir it up_to critical mass . The history of epidemics shows that such things are almost always related to human behaviors . As might be expected , given the ways of the world , we know much more about the precise mechanisms that amplified AIDS in America than we do about Africa , but we know that in both continents enormous social and sexual revolutions closely predated the AIDS epidemic . Northern AIDS ( in the United States , Europe , Australia and Japan ) , say researchers , is primarily spread by anal sex and IV drug use ; southern AIDS ( in Africa , Central and South_America and Asia ) mostly by vaginal sex and improper medical sterilization of syringes . Northern AIDS overwhelmingly affects men , notably homosexual and bisexual men , and there is comparatively little female-to-male transmission . Southern AIDS strikes heterosexual men and women evenly , and women appear to transmit HIV to men as easily as men to women . African historians say that decolonization there was followed by social shocks so profound that many cultures experienced greater change in a single generation than in the previous 1 # 000 years . Male African villagers , suddenly working in cities far from wives and family , replaced village monogamy or polygamy with multipartner urban sexuality . Women in the bustling cities were often compelled to engage in prostitution . There was a post-colonial explosion of unsterile needle use by ill-trained &quot; needle doctors &quot; and by poorly executed mass-immunization programs . Military conflicts were marked by epidemics of mass rape . In America , the golden opportunities for AIDS -- the blood products revolution , the IV drug revolution and the gay revolution -- are obvious to anyone monitoring the epidemic . Tellingly , all those revolutions were launched at around the same time , the era of Woodstock and Stonewall . Culling blood products from multiple donors began only in the 1960s , and the manufacture of clotting factors -- developed from the blood of thousands of donors -- began only in 1970 . As a source of disease amplification , the blood revolution has built-in limitations . While it is medically easy for blood recipients to receive infectious agents , it is socially difficult for them to pass diseases on . Many blood recipients are elderly or chronically ill and do not donate blood or engage in IV drug use or sexual_activity that might spread their infections . The main exceptions are hemophiliacs , but there are relatively few of them . More_than one-third of U.S. AIDS cases -- about 113 # 000 -- are associated with IV drug use , while more_than 80 % of HIV-positive women inject drugs or have sexual partners who do . For the most part , however , users share needles with the same small cluster of people , keeping infection within a relatively restricted community , while poverty , lack of social mobility and a high death rate among IV users may impede HIV ' s spread to the general population . If the blood and IV drug revolutions created new viral highways that were medically efficient but socially limited , the sexual revolution among gay_men in the 1970s created near-perfect conditions for viral amplification . Gay_men , according to Alfred Kinsey ' s famous 1948 study of the sexual habits of American males , had relatively few sexual partners before liberation . As social conditions and sexual opportunities improved for gay_men in the 1960s , health conditions in the ' 70s declined to_the_point where , by 1985 , certain pockets of Manhattan ' s growing gay community had incidences of genital_herpes and other sexually transmitted diseases up_to 20 times higher than heterosexual men of the same age . As the late AIDS activist Michael Callen noted , the gay male community was &quot; wallowing . . . in an increasingly polluted microbiological sewer. &quot; The vortex of desire and disease facilitated the amplification of HIV in several interrelated ways . For starters , multi-partner sexual_activity was raised to unprecedented levels , guaranteeing that any sexually transmitted microbe entering the gay reservoir would quickly spread to thousands and tens of thousands . Another was the practice of anal sex . While all forms of unprotected sex carry some risk of HIV transmission , studies show that for the receptive partner , unprotected anal sex is extremely risky . Finally there ' s the virulence factor . According to a theory advanced by Amherst ' s Paul Ewald , author of &quot; Evolution of Infectious_Disease , &quot; increased transmission may have literally amplified the virulence of HIV , which means two things : how easily a virus is spread and how fast it makes you sick . According to natural_selection , only those viral strains best suited to their environment will survive and reproduce . In a world when people had relatively few sex partners , the only strains of HIV likely to survive over the long_haul were those that delayed making their hosts sick for decades and gave relatively monogamous hosts a chance to have sexual_relations with several partners . But when HIV entered gay communities in which multipartner sex was the norm , this selective favoring of the least-virulent strains came_to an end . Now , even though virulent strains made their hosts sicken faster , the time_periods involved -- several years instead of several decades -- still gave those hosts ample time to infect many others . The result was a genetic favoring of the most virulent strains . Today , despite those who would have us believe that the pandemic is still confined to certain groups , infection has advanced to_the_point where everyone who engages in blood-sharing or unprotected sex outside a long-term monogamous relationship is at risk .</TEXT>
