   <HEADLINE> GOING TO ' SOUTH PACIFIC , ' AGAIN ; RIGHT NOW YOU CAN SEE THE STAGE MUSICAL IN TUSTIN AND BREA ; IT JUST CLOSED IN YORBA LINDA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot; South Pacific , &quot; the lovely and mysterious island of Bali H ' ai beckons from across the misty ocean . &quot; If you try , you ' ll find her , &quot; croons Bloody Mary , &quot; where the sky meets the sea. &quot; You never have to try too hard to find Bali H ' ai in Orange County , though . This season alone , from where the 55 freeway meets the 5 to right off Imperial Highway , productions of &quot; South Pacific &quot; are running in Tustin and Brea , practically next to each other . A third , in nearby Yorba Linda , closed just weeks ago . Virginia DeLand , producer for the Yorba Linda Civic Light_Opera where the show opened in July , remarked that &quot; people who have theaters in such close proximity should pay a little more attention &quot; to what each other is doing . Yet she confessed that her troupe had known_nothing of the other productions . &quot; South Pacific , &quot; she said , was &quot; high on the ballot from our audience. &quot; At the Brea Civic Light_Opera , where it debuted last weekend , president Harold Ivy said the musical &quot; topped the list &quot; of possible shows drawn_in January by the 12-member executive board . Was the board surprised to learn that other companies would be offering the same thing so close by ? &quot; ' Upset ' is a better word , &quot; Ivy allowed . Over in Tustin at the Elizabeth Howard Curtain_Call Dinner Theatre , &quot; South Pacific &quot; had been playing for more_than two months before the lights ever came_up on Brea ' s tropical paradise . The Curtain_Call ' s executive staff -- led by producer Howard and her brother , John Ferola , who is the artistic director -- choose from a stable of 20 to 30 musicals and run them as long as they seem to draw an audience ( &quot; South Pacific &quot; is scheduled to close Oct . 23 ) . &quot; South Pacific &quot; has been a recurring stalwart , having occupied their stage four times in the last 15 years . &quot; You don ' t do ( shows ) for a_few years and then they come_around again , &quot; said Doug Shaffer , the Curtain_Call ' s musical director . Like DeLand and Ivy , Shaffer said he , Howard and Ferola had been unaware of the other productions , but he insisted that the dinner theater offers a unique product that doesn ' t necessarily compete with community organizations . * In any case , this isn ' t the only season that has seen the show &quot; come_around again &quot; with amazing regularity . Not even counting the Howard productions , it has been mounted six times in Orange County since 1987 . Part of its appeal certainly is in its beautiful ballads ( &quot; Some Enchanted Evening , &quot; &quot; Younger Than Springtime &quot; ) and rousing showstoppers ( &quot; There is Nothin ' Like a Dame , &quot; &quot; I ' m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outta My Hair &quot; ) and in its counterpointed love_stories , one between career-woman Ensign Nellie Forbush and sophisticated , wealthy Frenchman Emile de Becque , and the other between young hotshot hero Joe Cable and angelic native-girl Liat . Still , it ' s the sailors who can really sell the show . An irresistible hodgepodge of Americans who pant after dames , and who exercise their Yankee ingenuity to get_around regulations and make a half-honest buck on the side , they seemingly never fail to charm . Indeed , in spite of the competition , all three of this season ' s &quot; South Pacifics &quot; have pulled audiences in . &quot; Our pre-sale has been very good , &quot; Ivy said of Brea ' s production , which continues through Oct . 9 . &quot; We expect this to be our best show to date. &quot; Elizabeth Howard ' s production is apparently having a healthy run , doing its part to keep the county ' s last surviving dinner theater in business . But perhaps even &quot; South Pacific &quot; can play_out its appeal . Yorba Linda ' s production , which sold_out several times , was scheduled for six more performances at the 2 # 000 seat amphitheater in Anaheim ' s Pearson Park . But those shows were canceled . Out of a possible 12 # 000 tickets , only 10 had been pre-sold . * Sue Richmond of the Anaheim Recreation Department , which books the park , said she really doesn ' t know why the sales were so dismal , whether it was &quot; the show , the circumstances , the timing or what . Normally , we do concerts and children ' s shows . We had 1 # 600 people for a magic show this summer. &quot; With such a large house , she noted , &quot; it looks pretty scary when only 30 people show up. &quot; The deal between the YLCLO and the city of Anaheim was the first of its kind and Richmond speculated that the city would &quot; probably try a similar arrangement again . Basically , we did_it to get some people in because we have experienced a drop_in grant funding . We did_it so that people would notice that the amphitheater is here and that there are other things going on. &quot; The good news on the cancellation ? Some of the Yorba Linda cast members hopped right over to Brea ' s production . For some people , Bali H ' ai is always calling . * The Brea Civic Light_Opera production of &quot; South Pacific &quot; by Rodgers and Hammerstein continues through Oct . 9 at the Curtis Theater , 1 Civic Center Circle , Brea , Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. $ 7 to $ 15 . ( 714 ) 990-7722 . The Elizabeth Howard Curtain_Call Dinner Theatre production continues through Oct . 23 at 690 El Camino Real , Tustin , Tuesdays through Saturdays at 6:15 p.m. and Sundays at 11:15 a.m. and 5:15 p.m. $ 20.95 to $ 31.95 , includes meal .
