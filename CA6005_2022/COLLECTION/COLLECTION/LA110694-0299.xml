   <HEADLINE> IT ' S NOT GOOD AS GOLD , IT ' S BETTER ; BOXING : FOREMAN HITS THE JACKPOT IN LAS VEGAS WITH HIS SHOCKING VICTORY OVER MOORER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At 45 , George Foreman experienced the thrill of a lifetime Saturday night . &quot; Winning the title the first time didn ' t touch winning the gold medal in the Olympic Games , &quot; he said after leveling Michael Moorer in the 10th round with a right_hand to the jaw . &quot; But this is the greatest thrill of my life. &quot; Foreman was behind by five points on each of two scorecards and , somehow , by only one on the other when he delivered the punch that dethroned a man 19 years younger and shocked 12 # 000 eyewitnesses . Actually , it was a combination that sent Moorer to the canvas -- a left to the forehead and then the right . &quot; I knew he wasn ' t going_to get_up , &quot; Foreman , attired in a suit and hiding his swollen eyes behind dark glasses , said at the news_conference . &quot; I hit him a_few other times with good right_hands , but they were short punches . This time I got body_English into it. &quot; Former World Boxing Assn . and International Boxing Federation champion Moorer , the first to be interviewed after the fight , said he never saw the punch coming . &quot; It was a sneaky right , &quot; said Moorer , who also wore dark glasses . &quot; It was something we had worked_on a lot in the gym . &quot; Teddy ( trainer Teddy Atlas ) wanted me to keep circling to the right to stay_away_from it. &quot; Despite the big lead_on the two cards , Moorer said he never thought_about playing it cautiously the last three rounds . &quot; I wasn ' t going_to let_up , &quot; he said . &quot; He caught me . What can I say ? The best_man won tonight . &quot; Boxing is a sport that has winners and losers . The only thing that hurts is that I called my son and he was crying. &quot; Most of the rest of the people who watched on TV must have been cheering . &quot; This was for the 45- to 55-year-old athletes , &quot; Foreman said . What will be the subject of Rev . Foreman ' s sermon today in Houston ? &quot; Don ' t let anybody tell you what you can ' t do . . . and don ' t go_to Vegas and bet against me. &quot; Foreman was asked if he realized he was losing the fight . &quot; The scores didn ' t matter , &quot; he said . &quot; I thought I would knock him out_in the 11th round . &quot; I wanted to knock him down in one of the late rounds because I knew he would n ' t get_up then. &quot; But did he feel a sense of urgency as his eyes swelled , Moorer kept firing quicker and sharper punches , and time was running_out ? &quot; No , I just felt half-blind , &quot; he cracked . Foreman looked_like a 45-year-old fighter -- slow and sluggish -- until the last punch of the fight . Only his strength , heart , and a rigorous conditioning program got him as far as the 10th round . &quot; I was in great condition , &quot; Foreman said . &quot; It was all that running_on the beach at Malibu that did it. &quot; Oh yes , one other thing kept him going . &quot; I got tired_of being introduced as the former heavyweight champion of the world , &quot; said the new heavyweight champion of the world .</TEXT>
