   <HEADLINE> STREET SMART : COSTA MESA FREEWAY TO GET ALL-PURPOSE LANE IN EACH DIRECTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dear Street Smart : Every morning I travel the northbound Costa Mesa Freeway , and daily I see numerous drivers exiting onto the Garden Grove Freeway from the wrong lane . I , too , am exiting the Costa Mesa Freeway at this juncture ( from the slow_lane , however ) , and I always have to look_out for someone to my left cutting_in front of me to make the transition . Why doesn ' t law_enforcement do something about this ? Secondly , the on-ramp to the westbound Garden Grove Freeway at The City Drive is long and has two lanes , one of which is a diamond lane . The traffic in the non-diamond lane backs_up all_the way onto The City Drive . I have noticed that few people use the diamond lane , and about half of those who do are solo occupants . It would seem to make_sense to eliminate the diamond lane , thereby alleviating the congestion onto The City Drive . M.J. Lambertsen Lake Forest It may help to know that there are plans to add one all-purpose lane in each direction on the Costa Mesa Freeway between 17th Street and Garden Grove Freeway including the connector ramps . Construction is expected to start in January . Regarding your second question , a recent traffic survey of the The City Drive ' s westbound on-ramp found that 20 % of the approximately 8 # 700 vehicles that use it per day are legal car pools , said Rose Orem , a spokeswoman for Caltrans . Therefore , Caltrans is hesitant to remove the diamond-lane designation . Caltrans will , however , adjust the meter on the other lane to speed the flow of cars onto the freeway , she said . Dear Street Smart : Traveling north on Moulton Parkway at the traffic speed of 45 m.p.h. , you pass the traffic_lights at El Toro Road , then an incline and about a block later you encounter traffic_lights at Gate 12 of Leisure World . There is no warning that traffic will exit or enter Gate 12 nor is there a view of possible traffic exiting Gate 12 on their green_light . Many accidents have occurred there and many near-accidents happen there almost every day . This might be avoided by a simple warning_light placed halfway up the incline stating &quot; Danger -- Traffic_Light Ahead. &quot; Gordon K . Bern Laguna Hills Investigators of Orange County ' s traffic engineering department are assessing that area for visibility problems , said Ignacio Ochoa , traffic engineer . It may be that overgrown vegetation on the median of the road and on Leisure World ' s side is the culprit and needs to be cut_back , he said . If the roadway does not meet visibility requirements for other reasons , corrective measures will be taken , Ochoa said . It would be a simple thing to erect a &quot; Signal Ahead &quot; sign , he said . The number of accidents on Moulton Parkway near Gate 12 has not been unusually high , especially since the traffic_signal was installed at Gate 12 about eight years ago , he said . * People who use the county ' s Dial-A-Ride bus_services will have an opportunity to speak out about proposed changes and possible reductions in transit van service for senior_citizens . The public can testify at a hearing conducted by the Orange County Transportation Authority at 9 a.m. May 9 , at the Planning_Commission Hearing Room , 10 Civic Center Plaza , Santa Ana . The changes , which include the phase_out of Dial-A-Ride service for able-bodied senior_citizens , are being proposed as part of a plan to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act . The federal law requires all transit operators to provide comparable service for people who can ' t use public_transit due_to a disability .
