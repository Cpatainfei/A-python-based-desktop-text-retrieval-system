   <TEXT> A short walk up Jianshe Road from the train_station in this booming frontier factory town reveals the timeless face of capitalism , as embraced unabashedly in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . In a Dickensian scene , prostitutes and filthy-faced urchins line the sidewalk by the Shangri-La , a shiny , marble-crusted , five-star hotel . Outside , a small boy hoists a seemingly lifeless infant on his shoulder and begs . Inside , sleek men in tailored suits mill_about importantly in the lobby . The paradoxes of capitalism are nothing new_to China , despite four decades of egalitarian Maospeak . Chinese civilization has long had its own brand of capitalism , some experts say , a force that spread its energy and its ethos across the Pacific Rim -- and is now boomeranging back . Its essence , aside from the profit motive , is a way of doing business called guanxi -- roughly translated as &quot; personal_relationships &quot; or &quot; connections &quot; -- that guides the ubiquitous networks of Chinese family entrepreneurs . Guanxi ( pronounced &quot; gwan-shi &quot; ) also implies a moral code of sorts , offering an informal alternative to the legalistic trappings of Western capitalism -- and prompting some observers to worry about its corrosive effects on the rule_of_law in the world ' s fastest-growing markets . The guanxi tradition flickered at_home under Communist orthodoxy until it was rekindled a dozen years ago by Deng Xiaoping ' s economic reforms . China ' s industrial_revolution started in test laboratories like Shenzhen , a special free_trade zone across the border from Hong Kong . Abroad , the flame was nurtured passionately by the multitudes of the Chinese diaspora , the overseas progeny of an old tradition of economic migration and political asylum-seeking . Now , these wandering sons and daughters of Greater China -- some 55 million strong -- are bankrolling the dynamic economic development of their 1.2 billion cousins in the ancestral homeland , transcending national borders and political ideology . Countless small entrepreneurs -- from Taiwan to Chinese enclaves in such places as Bangkok and Los Angeles -- are proving that tiny is beautiful , and highly profitable . They have formed a spontaneous capillary system of investment , pumping tens of billions of dollars into small joint-venture factories and real_estate projects , all_the while penetrating deeper into the Chinese mainland . By most accounts , their stake in China ' s economy dwarfs that of the celebrated Chinese tycoons of Hong Kong or the giant multinationals from Japan and the United States . Experts say these networks of small investors are thriving , despite the high risks of doing business in China , because they are nimble on their feet , they speak Chinese -- and they have good guanxi . &quot; They ' re like guerrilla troops , &quot; said S . Gordon Redding , author of &quot; The Spirit of Chinese Capitalism &quot; and a business professor at the University of Hong Kong . &quot; These enterprises are designed for the jungle , not for the parade ground. &quot; Guanxi also can be a euphemism for bribery -- or , to put a positive face on it , incentive payments to trusted contacts in local_governments , all_in the name of expediency . The line between culturally correct and seemingly corrupt often is impossible to draw . But these methods are ideally suited to doing business in developing China , where the legal_system is primitive and peevish bureaucrats are easily bought . Smart business_deals aren ' t cemented by paper contracts that can ' t be enforced , the theory goes , but by informal relationships of trust and mutual obligation . Many overseas Chinese entrepreneurs have considerable experience in this gray ethical area , having for years conducted business across an unstable jigsaw_puzzle of Third_World legal_systems and political regimes . Ethnic Chinese families and their enterprises have been repressed in Indonesia and Malaysia , for instance , and tightly regulated by authoritarian Singapore . &quot; The continued vitality of overseas Chinese owes a lot to their dependence on personal_relationships , &quot; said Wong Siu-Lun , a sociologist at the University of Hong Kong . &quot; Partly , it ' s a way to resist interference by the state . If they build_up big corporations and hierarchies , they can be easy targets. &quot; Indeed , entrepreneurs in Nationalist Taiwan were controlled by a military_police state until 1987 . Even today , the bulk of their estimated $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion cumulative investment in the mainland is underground , typically channeled through shell companies in Hong Kong and still technically illegal under Taiwan law . Personal networking is not unique to Chinese entrepreneurs ; it ' s the bread_and_butter for small-business people in any culture . But to many Chinese , guanxi takes_on a special intensity in their Confucian ethos , where family values of obligation are paramount . Some of the practices aren ' t easily understood by a legalistic mind . &quot; We don ' t bribe people in China , but giving them gifts is a matter of generating good feelings , &quot; said Wong Mau-Hung , a Taiwan native who has lived_in Japan and Hong Kong for 30 years . Wong is investing heavily in mainland real_estate development , using personal connections he acquired over the years as a tour operator . &quot; China is a very poor place . If somebody needs a television or a car , we might give it to him . But it ' s for the development of the nation , &quot; Wong explained . &quot; To me , it ' s a matter of profit-sharing , &quot; said Steve Tii-Ren Shaw , 32 , a native Taiwanese educated at Cal State Long_Beach . Shaw worked for a plastics firm in Toronto and is involved in opening a machinery plant in Shenzhen . &quot; I just want these things done smoothly , so I give them a consulting fee or a service commission , &quot; Shaw said . &quot; I ' ll save money in the long_run by getting things done on_time . It networking . &quot; He ' d drop_off his first_cousin like a stone if he thought he was going_to hurt his business. &quot; As a result , it ' s the little guys who are cleaning_up in China , investment_bankers say , not the large , lumbering foreign corporations that are slow in making decisions . Although they face high risks , small entrepreneurs are reportedly taking_home 70 % to 90 % returns on equity with their investments . Reliable information about the profitability of such networkers is extremely difficult to obtain , however . These aren ' t publicly listed companies . The bookkeeping is typically spread across borders , split between sub-family units and channeled through evanescent ghost corporations . So-called transfer pricing -- which hides profits from tax authorities -- is the name of the game , inside and outside China . &quot; It ' s difficult to pin_down who is doing what , &quot; said Li-Pei Wu , chairman of General Bank , which serves the Chinese community in Los Angeles . &quot; They don ' t want people to know . There are tax considerations . When you have so many companies operating , you can manipulate which ones make money. &quot; Frankie Leung , a Los Angeles lawyer and prolific author of advice on doing business in China , sees a collusive mind-set in the Chinese business networks . &quot; The Chinese don ' t like to talk_about networking . It ' s like they ' re a sect , &quot; Leung said . &quot; They don ' t like to be intellectually analyzed . When you describe it , the mystique value is lost . They think their practices can be learned and used to attack them. &quot; Clannishness among the guanxi capitalists might be attributable to the fact that many , indeed , do business through their clans . But geographic links are considered even more important . A preponderance of Taiwanese investment in China , for example , is believed to be routed surreptitiously through Hong Kong banks to Fujian province , just across the Taiwan Strait , to which the vast majority of Taiwan ' s 21 million people trace their roots . With rising labor costs at_home , small manufacturers have been in a frenzy to relocate their plants on the mainland . But the risks can be high . Joey Peng , a former Los Angeles resident who runs a trading company in Taipei , said he and his brother lost $ 2 million on a joint-venture factory making computer disk_drives in Hanzhou , China . Peng is networking aggressively , hoping to make a comeback . All networks don ' t necessarily lead to China . Taiwanese investors have swarmed into Southeast_Asia in search of cheap labor , using guanxi with ethnic Chinese partners from Indonesia to Indochina who often speak a common dialect . The trend is encouraged by the Taipei government , which hopes to derive diplomatic advantage from its $ 85-billion cache of foreign_exchange reserves . Taiwan holds the largest foreign investment stake in Vietnam and rivals Japan in other key markets . In the reverse flow , ethnic Chinese in Southeast_Asia are pumping capital toward the Chinese heartland . Mainland entrepreneurs , having secretly stashed billions of dollars from trading profits in overseas banks , are bringing_home hard currency under the guise of foreign investment , experts say . Most often , the guanxi spreads widely through expanding concentric circles of mutual friends and sometimes rather distant acquaintances . So_long as there is a web of interlocking entanglement , enough trust can be maintained to conduct business with confidence . At its most refined stage , Chinese networking is a speculative game , where contacts are made and gifts or favors exchanged without any immediate expectations . Someday , the thinking goes , there might be a benefit . Shane I-Feng Wang , a real_estate developer based in Monterey Park , is one entrepreneur who thinks that way . Wang , whose father was a high-level official in the Nationalist government that retreated to Taiwan in 1949 , said he recently entertained the son of Chinese Premier Li Peng in Los Angeles . The son of the Communist and the son of the Nationalist did not discuss business or politics , Wang said . But it was a promising guanxi for the future . Last year , Wang invested nearly $ 5 million in a joint-venture commercial real_estate development in northeast China ' s Jilin province , he said . Wang reverently displayed drawers and shelves packed with business_cards -- the most important guanxi in a set of special binders -- and boasted of having more_than 30 # 000 contacts in Los Angeles alone . &quot; I spend money to take_care of people when they come_to L.A. , not for any purpose . I don ' t expect anything in return , &quot; he said . &quot; But when I go_to China , they introduce me to people they know . In many cases , this becomes very useful for business. &quot; Where Guanxi Governs Commerce Much of the commercial life of China -- and of the overseas Chinese business people who ply their trade across the Pacific -- is lubricated by guanxi , a concept best translated as &quot; connections. &quot; As capitalism regains its hold_in coastal China , it is smaller enterprises joined through overseas guanxi networks rather than large-scale foreign investors that are the leading engines of economic development .</TEXT>
