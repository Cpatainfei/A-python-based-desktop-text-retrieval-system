   <HEADLINE> TEST SUGGESTS HUBER BLOOD MATCH IN O.C. ; INVESTIGATION : MORE DEFINITIVE DNA ANALYSES OF SAMPLES FROM THE LAGUNA HILLS SITE ARE NOW UNDERWAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Preliminary tests show that blood from a suspected murder site in Orange County could match samples taken from the victim , Denise Huber , and authorities said Monday that they have begun sophisticated DNA tests to establish more definitive results . Linking the blood found in a Laguna Hills storage facility to Huber is crucial in determining whether the 23-year-old Newport Beach woman was killed there . A match would almost surely mean transfering the prosecution of suspect John J . Famalaro from Arizona to Orange County . Huber ' s nude and handcuffed body was found two weeks ago in a freezer inside a stolen moving truck at Famalaro ' s home here . Since the grim discovery , authorities have been building a case against the former Orange County man and trying to decide where he will be tried . &quot; Right now the evidence indicates that the truck came from California . The freezer was purchased in California and brought from California to Arizona , &quot; Yavapai County Atty . Thomas B . Lindberg said . &quot; The freezer was kept plugged_in while it was in the truck . Is that enough to push the case back to California ? &quot; I don ' t know . A blood match would make a stronger case for California jurisdiction. &quot; An official familiar_with the investigation said preliminary tests of the Orange County storage_locker blood sample are &quot; within a range &quot; that is compatible with Huber ' s blood_type . More definitive testing , including DNA analysis , is expected to be completed later this week . All of the blood testing is being done_in Orange County , where samples obtained from the storage facility are being compared with others taken from Huber ' s body . Should the blood from the storage facility be positively identified as Huber ' s , the findings would support the long-held theory of law_enforcement officials that Huber most likely died shortly after her disappearance June 3 , 1991 . Famalaro rented a storage_locker in Laguna Hills , where authorities suspect Huber was bludgeoned to death , possibly with a crowbar . Famalaro apparently lived_in the storage_locker at that time . Forensic technicians found the bloodstains in the storage facility last week . &quot; It makes_sense that she died ( in Orange County ) , as much as I would like to have jurisdiction over there , &quot; said Denise Huber ' s father , Dennis . The Hubers believe that Famalaro is more likely to receive a death sentence in Arizona courts if he is convicted . Arizona and Orange County authorities were expected to meet today to further discuss jurisdiction . Meanwhile , Costa Mesa investigators were to return to Famalaro ' s home on the Prescott Country_Club in Dewey to search for additional evidence . Orange County Assistant Dist . Atty . John Conley said jurisdiction might be decided &quot; by the end of the week at the earliest. &quot; Both Lindberg and defense_attorney Thomas K . Kelly have said a blood match would almost surely send the case to California for trial . Laurie Berra , spokeswoman for the Yavapai County Sheriff ' s Department , said local officials are unconcerned with where Famalaro should be tried . &quot; We just want to see justice for the ( Huber ) family , &quot; Berra said . &quot; I don ' t want to see Denise get lost in all_of this . I don ' t want the victim to be forgotten , as happens so many times. &quot; On Monday , Yavapai County Superior_Court Judge Raymond W . Weaver was advised by the defense that Dr. Heinz Karnitschnig will perform his medical_examination of Huber ' s body today . The defense pathologist will require at least two hours . Huber ' s parents have agreed to the arrangement , Lindberg told the court , because &quot; they did not want to hinder any judicial process , harm any potential aspects of the case or prevent the judicial_system from acting properly. &quot; The family is planning to bury Denise Huber ' s body next Tuesday in South_Dakota . Famalaro is expected to be arraigned Monday , but Kelly said his client would not appear at the hearing &quot; because I do not want to subject him to the stress of media coverage. &quot; Kelly will enter the plea . The arraignment , however , could be moot if law_enforcement officials determine through DNA testing that Huber ' s blood was splattered in the storage facility . &quot; Hopefully , by the end of the week we will know the whole genetic printing ( of the blood samples ) , &quot; said Yavapai Sheriff ' s Lt . Scott Mascher . Usually , DNA testing is a lengthy and time-consuming process , however , Mascher said Orange County investigators are hustling the testing through their laboratory . &quot; DNA takes some time , but they want to put it out as quickly as they can , &quot; Mascher said . &quot; We ' re not rushing things . There ' s still a lot things we have to do. &quot; Mascher said he spent all_of Monday itemizing evidence seized in three searches of Famalaro ' s home . &quot; I ' ve itemized evidence . . . what has to go_to the lab for analysis and what has to be retained ( at sheriff ' s headquarters ) , &quot; Mascher said . &quot; On this end , we have a lot of evidentiary items in the case. &quot; Mascher , the lead investigator in the case , said it did not matter_to him where Famalaro is tried . If necessary , he said he could appear in a California courtroom to testify just as easily as in Yavapai County .</TEXT>
