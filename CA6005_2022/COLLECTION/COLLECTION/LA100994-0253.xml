   <HEADLINE> U.S. , IRAQ MOVE MORE TROOPS TOWARD KUWAIT ; MILITARY : BAGHDAD MOBILIZES FORCE OF 64 # 000 . TENSION UP AS AMERICAN SHIPS , PLANES , 4 # 000 SOLDIERS CONVERGE ON GULF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The standoff between Iraq and the United States intensified Saturday as Baghdad moved more troops close to the Kuwaiti border , and the Clinton_Administration dispatched 4 # 000 soldiers to join U.S. ships and planes converging on the Persian_Gulf . U.S. officials reported Saturday that more_than 14 # 000 troops from two mechanized divisions of Iraq ' s elite Republican Guard had joined other forces within 12 1 / 2 miles of the Kuwaiti border -- bringing the number of Iraqi forces in the border area to up_to 64 # 000 . The Pentagon said it was sending 4 # 000 soldiers from the Army ' s 24th Mechanized Division at Ft . Stewart , Ga. , near Savannah , to Kuwait this morning , and it had placed the remainder of the unit , along with the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton on alert . The U.S.S. Tripoli , an amphibious ship with 2 # 000 Marines from Camp Pendleton and the Tustin Marine Corps Air_Station , arrived off the coast of Kuwait on Saturday . The Defense_Department also deployed two more Patriot air-defense missile batteries to Saudi_Arabia , and placed additional U.S. combat aircraft in Europe on alert , but officials declined to provide the names of the units or the number of planes involved . The escalation by both sides represented a significant deterioration of the situation from only 24 hours earlier , when the United States first announced that it was sending forces in an attempt to deter the Iraqi troops . Despite Baghdad ' s massed forces , analysts said an incursion may_not be planned , and Iraq may simply be trying to pressure the United Nations into lifting its economic sanctions . On Saturday , however , a grim-faced Marine Corps Lt . Gen . John Sheehan , operations director of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , told reporters that , although there still was no firm indication that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein planned to invade immediately , the forces he has deployed so far &quot; clearly represent a threat &quot; to Kuwait . President Clinton , who went_to the presidential retreat at Camp David , Md. , for the weekend , reiterated his earlier warnings that it would be a &quot; grave error &quot; for Baghdad to underestimate U.S. resolve in preventing Iraq from invading Kuwait again . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry and Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , stopped in Florida en route home from Haiti on Saturday to confer_with Gen . J.H. Binford Peay III , head of the U.S. Central Command , which oversees operations in Kuwait . Sheehan said orders for the Ft . Stewart and Camp Pendleton forces to deploy could come imminently , depending_upon those discussions and others late Saturday night . The size and makeup of the well-equipped , heavily armed Iraqi force is &quot; similar to previous deployments we saw ( in 1990 ) when they did go_into Kuwait , &quot; Sheehan said . &quot; They clearly have the capability to attack. &quot; Sheehan noted pointedly that the United States now has enough warships in the region to fire 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Iraq . &quot; We clearly have the capacity to go_to downtown Baghdad , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s one of the lessons I hope Saddam learned the last time we did this. &quot; U.S. officials said Clinton and other top presidential policy-makers spent part of the day on the telephone conferring_with their counterparts in Britain , France and other countries that had been part of the allied coalition that defeated Iraq in the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War . The U.S. concern was echoed by other powers with interests in the region . Both Britain and Russia issued stern warnings to Baghdad , and Britain sent a frigate to bolster its naval force in the Gulf . Kuwait dispatched 50 tanks to its border with Iraq and placed its armed forces on high alert . Saudi_Arabia pledged to support U.S. troops . In New York , the U.N. Security_Council , in an unusual Saturday session , expressed grave concern over Iraq ' s actions and warned that the United Nations is still committed to protecting Kuwait ' s borders . The action came_after the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Madeleine Albright , unveiled satellite photographs showing Iraqi troop movements . Officials said France and Russia had obtained similar photographs from their own spy_satellites . Western analysts continued to be flabbergasted by Iraq ' s boldness in provoking the West , particularly since it is substantially weaker militarily than it was before its defeat in the Persian_Gulf_War . The most frequently voiced theory is that Baghdad is trying to bully the U.N. Security_Council into lifting sanctions imposed during the Gulf crisis of 1990 . One of the curbs Iraq objects to most is the sanction prohibiting Baghdad from selling its oil on world markets except under a tight U.N. supervision in which all_of the revenue would be devoted to humanitarian relief within Iraq and to payment of war reparations to Kuwait . Iraq has denounced the restrictions as a violation of its sovereignty and has refused to sell its oil under those conditions . The Security_Council had been set to vote Monday on Iraq ' s request that the sanctions be lifted . Washington had opposed easing the embargo , saying the Iraqis have not complied with all aspects of the resolution , such_as officially recognizing Kuwait or accepting the border demarcation . Diplomats said the latest confrontation , however , had all but ended any hope that the council might override U.S. objections , and restored Baghdad ' s status as a pariah in the international community . For its part , Iraq on Saturday denied that its troops were preparing_for another invasion of Kuwait , such_as the one in August , 1990 , that sparked the Persian_Gulf_War . But it threatened to end cooperation with the United Nations unless economic sanctions were lifted . Perry told reporters that the Iraqi troops positioned near the Kuwaiti border are &quot; too close for comfort. &quot; He said Iraqi mechanized units were &quot; less than an hour &quot; from Kuwait . &quot; We cannot afford to assume that this is just a bluff , and that is why we are taking the actions that we are taking , &quot; he said . &quot; If Saddam Hussein tries to send any military_forces into Kuwait today , then we will be prepared to meet them. &quot; Separately , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , leaving Washington on a trip to the Middle_East to bolster the Arab-Israeli peace process , said he will visit Kuwait during the trip -- probably on Wednesday -- to &quot; provide a very strong expression of our resolve. &quot; In a statement at Andrews Air_Force Base just before leaving , Christopher said Iraq &quot; must_not be allowed to intimidate &quot; either its neighbors or the United Nations . He said Baghdad ' s latest provocations &quot; underscore the importance of maintaining U.N. sanctions. &quot; Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) voiced support for Clinton ' s action , adding : &quot; The message the U.S. and the world needs to send is clear : If Saddam acts against Kuwait , the world will respond. &quot; Pentagon officials said the U.S. forces that Clinton ordered to the region on Friday were continuing their journey . The aircraft_carrier George_Washington and the guided-missile cruiser San Jacinto were en route to the Red_Sea . The ships and the 4 # 000 U.S. troops that left Ft . Stewart on Saturday night will join an array of U.S. ships , aircraft , supplies and Patriot missile batteries already in the region -- in Kuwait , Saudi_Arabia and Turkey , some positioned by the United States after the Persian_Gulf_War . Three Navy warships -- including the cruiser Leyte Gulf and the destroyer Hewitt and an unidentified submarine are already in the Persian_Gulf . By itself , a 50 # 000-member Iraqi contingent would not be regarded_as unusually formidable . However , officials said the addition of the two Republican Guard units , which are well-equipped and mechanized , clearly made_it a serious threat to Kuwait . Army Maj . Gen . Patrick Hughes , intelligence director for the Joint Chiefs , said the Iraqi force included a &quot; substantial &quot; array of self-propelled cannon , T-72 tanks and fighting vehicles and is &quot; the best-trained , best-led , best-equipped &quot; force Iraq has .
