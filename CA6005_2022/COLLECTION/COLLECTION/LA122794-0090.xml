   <HEADLINE> LIVING LARGE ; WE ' RE A NATION OBSESSED WITH CALORIES , WAISTLINES AND FIRM FANNIES . BUT THE NOTION THAT IT ' S OK TO BE BIG IN THE LAND OF LIPOSUCTION AND LIQUID_DIETS IS GAINING ACCEPTANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Frances White is not plump . Nor is she stout , stocky , tubby , paunchy or pudgy . Frances White is fat . F-a-t . Fat . We may speak openly of this because White has accepted her weight . Her goal now is to get you to accept it too . White , 51 , carries 350 pounds on a 5-foot , 8-inch frame . She has always been heavy . Destined , she says , to be a large_person from birth . She was put_on her first diet before age 10 . Then came thyroid pills , exercise programs and more and more diets . To her relatives she was an embarrassment . You ' ll never marry unless you shed some pounds , they warned . Her friends were little better , unable to fathom why she couldn ' t slim_down . At supermarkets , common strangers behaved like food police , criticizing items in her shopping_cart . And then there were the taunts , the oinks and the stares -- society ' s constant , humiliating reminders that she literally didn ' t fit_in . &quot; It ' s very painful , being fat in our body-obsessed society , &quot; says White , membership coordinator for San Francisco ' s public television_station , KQED . &quot; There ' s this cruel perception that we ' re always eating , that we ' re all lazy , sloppy and sickly . Your life is just miserable unless you find a way to cope. &quot; Frances White has found a way to cope . She has become a disciple of &quot; fat liberation , &quot; a promoter of the idea that it ' s OK to be large in the land of liposuction and liquid_diets . This might seem a heretical notion , considering our culture ' s obsession with firm fannies , no-fat cuisine , waif-like fashion_models and the adage that &quot; you can ' t be too rich or too thin. &quot; But the ideology of fat acceptance is , in fact , finding favor in America -- not just among the heavy but also among many health_professionals , obesity researchers , psychotherapists and civil-rights advocates . &quot; Fat people suffer tremendous painful social consequences because of their condition , &quot; says Dr. Kelly Brownell , director of Yale_University Center for Eating and Weight Disorders . &quot; We need to relieve them of the blame for their excessive weight and promote the message that very few of us can attain society ' s beauty ideal. &quot; Last month , the cause received a hearty boost from new findings suggesting that some people are genetically predestined to be obese . Researchers at Rockefeller University in New York say they have identified a gene responsible_for secreting proteins that signal the brain when the stomach is_full , thus indicating that it ' s time to stop eating . When this gene is defective , the signal is not sent or received and obesity results , the scientists believe . &quot; You have to attend_to ( obesity ) as an organic problem , not a behavioral problem , &quot; says Rudolph Leibel , a leading obesity researcher at Rockefeller University . Losing_weight , in other words , is not always a question of willpower . Government statistics show that 33 % of Americans are obese -- defined as more_than 25 % above their ideal body_weight . Studies have linked obesity with numerous medical ailments , including hypertension , diabetes , certain cancers and coronary heart_disease . But many fat activists -- and a small band of experts -- question such studies , contending that researchers have failed to distinguish fat people who exercise and eat sensibly from those who don ' t . &quot; There are many fat people who lead healthy lifestyles and I believe they are at considerably lower risk for these diseases , &quot; says Joanne Ikeda , a UC Berkeley nutritionist and expert on pediatric obesity . &quot; But the studies don ' t address this question because the scientific community assumes that all fat people are lazy gluttons. &quot; Leading the charge against fatism is the National Assn . to Advance Fat Acceptance ( NAAFA ) , a Sacramento-based group founded by a man angered by the bigotry his fat wife faced . The organization lobbies for fat-friendly legislation , operates a legal research and defense fund and designs educational_programs to fight &quot; fat phobia &quot; and anti-fat messages in the media . In recent years , the group has persuaded greeting-card manufacturers to come_up with &quot; fat-sensitive &quot; designs and pressured national restaurant_chains to install wider seating in new outlets . Last summer , members made headlines with a demonstration at the White_House , where they chided President Clinton -- who had been considered an ally because of the flak he took_for gaining weight on the 1992 campaign trail -- for ignoring fat people in the debate over health-care reform . &quot; Fat people are becoming empowered , &quot; says Sally Smith , NAAFA ' s executive_director . &quot; We are coming_out of the closet and realizing that you don ' t have to put_up with second-class treatment , and you don ' t have to put your life on hold waiting to be thin. &quot; Support groups and anti-diet organizations are popping_up from coast to coast , preaching the merits of &quot; size diversity &quot; and fighting the perception that fat people could get trim if only they would really try . Joe McVoy , a psychologist and eating-disorder specialist in Radford , Va. , recently formed a network of physicians , dietitians , therapists and others who advocate fat acceptance and healthy living for the obese . The Assn . for the Health Enrichment of Large People , he says , was born of his frustration at seeing his fat patients diet endlessly with no enduring success . &quot; For the last five decades , we ' ve been telling fat people to lose_weight , and that once they did , everything would be OK , &quot; McVoy says . &quot; Well , dieting as a long-term solution doesn ' t work . . . So we ' ve locked these people in a whirlpool of feeling bad because they ' re fat , and feeling worse because they fail at dieting. &quot; But some are bouncing_back in the war against fatism with litigation . More and more heavy people have begun to bring claims under the Americans With Disabilities Act and other laws . A Cookeville , Tenn. , woman who sued a movie_theater after she was barred from bringing her own chair to a showing of &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; recently settled her case , receiving a sum her lawyer called &quot; very satisfactory. &quot; Pam Hollowich , a 400-pound Los Angeles woman , sued Southwest Airlines after she was &quot; humiliated &quot; by a ticket_agent who allegedly pulled her out of line and ordered her to buy a second seat . &quot; It was terribly traumatic , degrading , &quot; she says . &quot; I was the fat lady who held_up the plane. &quot; Southwest Airlines spokesman Ed Stewart called the charges &quot; totally untrue , &quot; adding , &quot; we do everything we can to accommodate people of all sizes. &quot; Other lawsuits have challenged hiring practices and discrimination by landlords who reject prospective fat tenants , telling them they might crack the floor or break the toilet . &quot; Over the last year , we ' ve seen a dramatic increase in these cases , &quot; says James Goodman , senior attorney at the Persons With Disabilities Law Center in Atlanta . Meanwhile , legislation that would prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of size has recently come_before several state legislatures . So far , only Michigan has adopted such a law . &quot; Fat people are the last acceptable targets of bigotry in our country , &quot; says New York Assemblyman Daniel Feldman , who plans to reintroduce his bill next year . &quot; There are widespread , systematic patterns of discrimination against them. &quot; Research confirms his assertion . While it has become taboo to insult a person ' s race , gender , sexual orientation or religion , surveys show many people think little of mocking the obese . Fat people also appear to suffer in virtually all aspects of life , from employment to relationships , health_care , education and economic status . One researcher asked a group of college_students who they would be least inclined to marry . The obese ranked near the bottom , with the students preferring to wed embezzlers , ex-mental patients , cocaine users or shoplifters . The question of why fatness is such a stigma is a complex one . Some experts believe contemporary attitudes are linked to the Puritans , whose lifestyle was dominated by control , stoicism and self-denial . Fat people look indulgent -- unwilling to hop_on the treadmill and do what it takes_to get_in shape . As for fat people themselves , many regard their condition as the worst curse imaginable . Colleen Rand , a University of Florida obesity researcher , asked 47 formerly obese people whether they would rather be fat again or suffer some_other disability . Ninety-one percent said they would rather have a leg amputated , while 89 % said they would rather be blind . The personal stories of fat people echo the scientific data . Gary Raymond , a 49-year-old San Bernardino resident who has tried countless diets -- plus abdominal surgery -- to lose_weight , recalls the purchasing manager ' s job he got , and then lost , he says because of his size -- 385 pounds . For Terry Nicholetti Garrison , a radio advertising saleswoman in Ithaca , N.Y. , fat prejudice began in adolescence and followed her into the convent , where she was forced to wear a corset beneath her habit because her hips were said to sway too_much when she walked . For five years , she lived with red slash marks on her body from the corset ' s stiff stays . &quot; I ' ve made_over 100 unsuccessful attempts to lose_weight -- pills , diuretics , amphetamines , every single diet , hypnosis -- and still people tell me that all I need is a little willpower , &quot; says Garrison , 49 , who is 5 feet , 3 inches and weighs 210 pounds . &quot; Jesus , Mary and Joseph ! If I worked as hard at becoming a millionaire as I did at losing_weight , I might not be driving an ' 84 Sentra that ' s rusting away beneath me. &quot; Fed_up with the pursuit of thinness , Garrison and Raymond have decided to accept their weight and become torchbearers in the fat liberation movement . Raymond is a columnist for a magazine that caters to fat people , and also founded a company called Mourtodri , which makes towels for large people . Garrison wrote a book , launched a newsletter called &quot; Grace-Full Eating &quot; and , with a Cornell University psychology professor , created a self-help group for &quot; victims of weight prejudice. &quot; Critics say such groups ignore the medical risks associated with obesity . Earlier this month , the nonprofit Institute of Medicine released a report showing that obesity-related ailments lead to health_care costs of more_than $ 70 billion a year . And former Surgeon Gen . C . Everett Koop , launching a new campaign urging Americans to &quot; drop a_few pounds ( and ) shape_up , &quot; says that obesity-related conditions are the second-leading cause of death in the United States , after smoking . Even those who endorse the live-and-let-live philosophy of fat activists say that acceptance may_not be best for everyone . &quot; What our profession needs to do is determine which people should lose_weight , because of medical complications , and then help them do that , &quot; says Brownell of Yale ' s eating disorder center . &quot; Advocating body acceptance for everyone is not a defensible position . It would mean accepting a massive public health problem. &quot; As the scientific debate continues , fat liberationists say there are signs that their message is being heeded . Hollywood , for instance , has taken an interest in fat characters who go beyond the traditional comic roles . Last year ' s film &quot; What ' s Eating Gilbert Grape , &quot; for example , featured an obese woman who stood_up to bigotry and enjoyed her family ' s loving support . Nevertheless , 45 million Americans will attempt to lose_weight this year , according to Marketdata Enterprises , Inc. , a New York-based market research firm . And thigh cream , tummy tucks , liposuction and other forms of plastic_surgery are more popular than ever . &quot; It ' s slow going , &quot; says Frances White , president of NAAFA . &quot; But at least now people are talking_about size acceptance . And a lot of fat people are realizing they don ' t have to hide from the world. &quot;</TEXT>
