   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; JACQUES TOUBON ; DEFENDING THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AGAINST ALL INTERLOPERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A recent editorial cartoon in Le Figaro , the Parisian daily , showed an American soldier , circa 1944 , stumbling in terrible French to greet an attractive young Frenchwoman . &quot; You can just say ' Hello , Baby , ' &quot; the young_woman tells her suitor . &quot; Jacques Toubon is only 3 years old ! &quot; Such are the barbs being fired by newspapers and radio_stations in France these days into the thick_skin of Toubon , France ' s 53-year-old minister of culture . In just 15 months on_the_job , Toubon already has drawn flak for taking steps to protect the_French language from the intervention of foreign , and especially English , words . The Loi Toubon , passed last month by the National Assembly , requires companies to use French in advertisements and contracts . As a result , Nike , the athletic-wear manufacturer , has to find a suitable translation for its slogan , &quot; Just Do It , &quot; and MacDonald ' s will have to find a new name for &quot; cheeseburger. &quot; ( &quot; Hamburger &quot; is OK ; it ' s considered part of the_French language. ) A second Toubon-authored law , which will take_effect in 1996 , will require radio_stations to devote at least 40 % of their music air time to French songs . The new attempt at language protectionism has made Toubon the butt of countless jokes in the media . Some disc_jockeys have begun referring to the minister as &quot; Monsieur All Good , &quot; his last_name roughly translated into English . But this bothers Toubon not at all . He remains convinced that most people support his attempts to keep French pristine . His detractors , he contends , are a minority group of intellectuals and newspaper writers for whom &quot; it is fashionable to insert foreign words into their speech. &quot; Toubon is a longtime member of the conservative Gaullist party . Known for his harsh tongue on the National Assembly floor , he is viewed_as a skillful political organizer . But , outside the law-making body , it is his considerable charm and dimpled smile that is most often mentioned by those he meets . Toubon was born in Nice , the son of a croupier in a Riviera casino . His first marriage ended in divorce ; he has remarried . He works from an ornate suite of offices where the Duke of Orleans and , later , Napoleon ' s brother lived . Already a powerful figure in the government , Toubon will be a key figure in the coming year as conservatives begin choosing their candidate for president to replace the retiring Francois Mitterrand . Toubon will have to choose between his prime_minister , Edouard Balladur , and Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac , who helped Toubon get his start in national politics more_than 20 years ago . * Question : Let ' s begin with the Toubon Law to protect the_French language . Why is it necessary ? Answer : There are two objectives . The first is an intrinsic one : to develop a way of guaranteeing that everything said and written in France can be understood by the entire French population . The Toubon Law will ensure that instruction_manuals and explanatory leaflets for all products , whether domestic or imports , be translated into French . Contracts will be written in French so workers are able to understand them . And at scientific conferences , the French-speaking attendees will have to speak in French . Our second objective is broader -- to develop French translations for words used in industries such_as electronics and computers . Language is an irreplaceable capital for all peoples . If it is not preserved and modernized , it will no longer allow the people to express themselves , to understand each other or to communicate with the universe . Q : In many fields , English has become virtually a world language . You oppose that ? A : We support the concept of linguistic pluralism . If , one day , all mankind spoke in one language , or rather in one international code , this would lead to a dramatic impoverishment of culture and cultural exchange , and , finally , it would mean a regression of humanity . I do not think having everybody speak English or American_English would be a sign of progress . On the contrary , progress is when each individual expresses his identity through his culture and through the language that is its foundation . This law is our long-term investment . Q : But does the problem really exist ? Is anyone in France confronted with a situation in which they are not_able to speak their language ? A : Oh , yes . There are a lot of companies , French and foreign , who hire people with contracts written in English . This is discrimination -- and it ' s illegal . It ' s the same for instructions for appliances . In fact , it happens every day . When you arrive_at Roissy ( Charles de Gaulle ) Airport , you can see billboards written entirely in English . Many foreigners tell me that when they come_to France , they want to change their environment -- not find the same one they have at_home . Q : You ' re speaking now of advertising billboards for companies such_as American Express . But their audience includes Americans . Surely , you don ' t intend to stop them from reaching their clients . A : Of course , we will not prohibit American Express from directing their ads to their English-speaking clients . But what we are saying is that for every billboard written in English , there should be one written in French . Q : What about the words &quot; American Express ? &quot; Those are English words , too . A : American Express is a trademark , and we accept trademarks . No problem . Generally speaking , we accept all trademarks . Hamburger . Hot Dog . Pizza . There is no French equivalent , because they are American or Italian specialties . Or let ' s take goulash , the Hungarian national meal . Goulash is goulash . There is no word in French . The same rule applies to the names of restaurants . A Pizzeria will still be called a Pizzeria . Tandoori , for an Indian restaurant , will be still be called Tandoori . Q : So , some foreign words are OK and others aren ' t ? A : The issue here is not so_much that a foreign language be used . On the contrary , I would like to see French_people speak more foreign languages . But the problem is that French_people no longer speak French properly . And we are afraid that they may express themselves with the vocabulary , the syntax and the spirit of another language . Some English-speaking people also worry that other English-speaking people distort the_English language , what you call &quot; Basic English. &quot; We want each language to remain a living language and not have a two-track system where we would have one international code for communications and the national language only for administration , education , etc . That would destroy languages . Let me take a more concrete example . The word site in French means a beautiful place , a memorable place with historical value . This word has a positive meaning . But , more and more , the word site is used with the_English meaning . A &quot; site &quot; has become just a place . An industrial site , for example . It is a distortion of its usage , and now it has lost its actual impact . Now , when one uses the word site no one knows exactly what it means . Is it something beautiful or something ugly ? It would be better for everyone if the_French person is capable of expressing himself by using words from the_French language . Q : How does this issue make you feel personally ? Do you get angry when you hear English spoken by French_people ? A : No , I ' m not worried . I know full well that when it comes_to the usage of language , only the_French people and society make the rules . However , I think the state is responsible_for the patrimony of a country . The responsibility of the state is not to police the usage of language . All my law says is that , in certain cases , French must be used . The law doesn ' t fix rules of usage . That is the responsibility of the_French Academy , the intellectuals and the popular users . The state ' s role is to increase people ' s awareness and , most of all , the awareness of young people -- for whom the good usage of language is a vital skill . Let me take a concrete example . Today , unemployment is particularly high for young people just coming_out of school . We have noticed that their major handicap is language skills . They do not know how to read or write properly , or even to write their own resumes or fill_out an application . It is not only culture that is at stake here . It is the lives of the people . Q : But isn ' t your example more a question of education ? Isn ' t this law too late ? A : No , I don ' t think so . The law and the debate around it is leading to a greater awareness , and this awareness will fall upon the parents , on the teachers , on the pupils . I have met several people who are now interested in knowing how their children are taught French . It ' s primarily a law against indifference , against negligence . Q : How do you explain what the media thinks_about this law ? I have seen many articles poking_fun at your law . A : The people who are opposing me on this issue belong_to a minority group of intellectuals , for the most part , and for them , language is not an issue . For them , it is often fashionable to insert foreign words in their speech . We have , on the contrary , other groups who agree that language is a means of social integration . This is the case of many young immigrants for whom the usage of French is a type of passport necessary to enter French society . The majority of the population is in favor of this law , but most often this majority is silent . Q : You have insisted that this law is not directed only at English , and yet most French_people see it that way . A : This is not an attack against the_English language . My law will essentially affect the_English language , but it is not against English . It is intended to preserve the_French language . For example , if we have a new concept to name , we should not use the_English language to name it . In France , we have never said &quot; computer. &quot; We use the_French word ordinateur . The same goes_for AIDS . We say &quot; SIDA , &quot; even if the disease was first discovered in the United States . The point is that , if we make an effort , we can speak French without having to use English . Hence , I think , there is a bit of a misunderstanding . English and American newspapers say the_French are doing_it again -- that we want to be different . But 120 countries already have such a law and many other countries are in the process of passing such a law . Moreover , 15 states in the United States also have linguistic laws . Q : Will there be fines for language offenders ? A : In order for laws to be respected , there must be sanctions . These sanctions will be adapted to each case . If , for example , a working contract is not written in French , it will not be a legal_document . If an ad is done_in a foreign language , it will not be publicized on radio or television . Fines will not be given for language misuse . It is only in a case of violent attempts to prevent the law from being enforced that a jail sentence will be given . Q : How can you impose sanctions on advertising ? A : There will be fines , similar to tickets for speeding . A fine per billboard . But , most important , the objective is to encourage companies to make a French equivalent for every billboard made in a foreign language . Q : So , you don ' t really mind if someone on the street says &quot; cool ? &quot; A : Cool . Yes , well , nowadays people think everything modern or young comes from foreign words . It is a trend from high_school . I think we should try to show our young people that by using the word decontracte , instead of &quot; cool , &quot; they are saying the same thing . Television is imposing a cultural model made in the U.S.A. For example , the trend at the moment is to play street basketball , and this leads to children dressing like the American basketball_players , walking like them and using the same vocabulary . This phenomena has always existed , but I think this may cause our society to break_down into tribes . The ultimate risk would be that our Republic , our common thing , disappears . There is a lot at stake here. *</TEXT>
