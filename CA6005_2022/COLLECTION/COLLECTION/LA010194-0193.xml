   <HEADLINE> HOME SAFETY ; PROPER CRIB WILL LET YOU REST EASY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Selecting baby gear with safety in mind can keep home sweet home a haven for babies . For infants , safety often begins with proper crib and mattress selection . Cribs in poor repair or with ill-fitting mattresses are responsible_for myriad injuries to infants . For example , babies can suffocate if their heads or bodies become wedged between the mattress and the side of the crib . To avoid this , be sure the crib mattress fits snugly into the crib . If more_than two fingers can fit between the edge of the mattress and the crib , the mattress is too small . Widely spaced crib slats -- those that permit babies ' arms , legs and torso to slip through but prevent their heads from doing the same -- can also cause injuries . Slats , spindles or rods should be spaced no more_than 2 1 / 8 inches apart . And do not use cribs with cracked or missing slats . Reduce the risk of head entrapment by selecting head and foot boards without cutout spaces . Plastic wrappings or bags can cling_to babies ' faces and cause them to suffocate . This material should never be used to cover the mattress or pillows . Cribs made before 1978 may be coated with paint or varnish containing dangerous amounts of lead . Refinish older cribs with lead-free paint designed for baby products . Remove all toys strung across the crib top after babies are 5 months old or can push_up to their hands and knees to avoid becoming entangled or falling_over a hanging crib toy . Changing Tables and Playpens Changing tables and playpens should also be selected with safety in mind . Choose changing tables with easily accessible drawers or shelves . Babies can roll_off the table even if left unattended for only a_few minutes . Look_for mesh playpens with openings that are less than a quarter-inch wide . The mesh should have no tears , holes or loose threads . Do not leave babies in mesh-sided playpens with one side down . Babies can suffocate if they fall or roll into the gap between the edge of the floor_board and the mesh side . If a wooden playpen is the choice , be sure the slats are spaced no more_than 2 1 / 8 inches apart . Safety Gates Wooden accordion-style gates made before 1985 may have wide V-shaped openings along the top edge and sides that may entrap children ' s heads . Instead , select gates with straight top edges or accordion-style gates with openings no more_than 1 1 / 2-inches wide . And remember : Safety gates are deterrents , not a substitute for supervision . Almost all gates can be dislodged or climbed . Traveling Taking precautions before traveling with babies can also be important . Select a wide-based stroller to prevent tipping . Test the brakes to be sure that they lock the wheels securely . The stroller ' s safety_belt and crotch strap should open and lock easily -- and both should fasten securely to the frame . Infants should ride in car_seats positioned in the center of the back seat facing the car ' s rear . In the event of a crash , the impact would be spread across their backs .</TEXT>
