   <HEADLINE> ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WORKED 5 YEARS AT HUFFINGTON HOME ; POLITICS : CANDIDATE SAYS HIS WIFE HIRED THE WOMAN . HE SAYS PROPER TAXES WERE PAID AND A GREEN_CARD APPLIED FOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Republican candidate Mike Huffington , whose tough stand against illegal immigration is a cornerstone of his Senate_campaign , employed a woman at his Santa Barbara home for about five years who was in the country illegally , his campaign acknowledged Wednesday . The woman ' s job ended last year , shortly after Huffington was sworn into office as a freshman congressman and several months before he announced his bid to challenge Sen . Dianne Feinstein , sources told The Times . The woman had cared_for the Huffingtons ' two daughters -- now ages 3 and 5 -- since they were born . Huffington declined to talk with The Times on Wednesday . But in a live television interview Wednesday night , the candidate said his wife was responsible_for hiring the illegal worker , which is a violation of federal law . He then accused Feinstein of hiring illegal immigrants at her home , but offered no evidence of the allegation . &quot; My wife did hire someone , found_out that she was illegal , applied for a green_card and filled_out all_of the paperwork and paid the taxes , &quot; he said on KCAL-TV in response to a question about The Times ' story . &quot; But what is ironic is . . . we ' ve been told by people who know a lot about ( Feinstein ' s ) staff , she too had hired two people who were illegal . The question I would ask Mrs . Feinstein is , did she pay the taxes as my wife did ? &quot; Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata hotly rejected the allegation . &quot; That charge is an outright lie . It ' s just typical when he is caught breaking the law , his first response is to lie . Now his campaign is in great jeopardy. &quot; Earlier in the day , after a campaign event in San Diego where Huffington spoke about his support for Proposition 187 -- the anti-illegal immigration measure on the November ballot -- the candidate was asked if he had ever employed an illegal immigrant at his home . He told the San Diego newspaper reporter he did not know of any problem . Huffington ' s campaign released five pages of federal documents Wednesday evening , after being questioned about the issue by The Times , to demonstrate that the candidate ' s wife had tried unsuccessfully to obtain papers that would allow the worker to be in the country legally . According to the documents , the application was made to the U.S. Labor_Department on Nov . 13 , 1990 . The process requires that the employer interview a number of U.S. citizens for the job to demonstrate that the foreign national is the only candidate qualified for the job . One of the documents released by the campaign was a sworn affidavit from Arianna Huffington saying that she had advertised the position in the Santa Barbara News Press and interviewed at least four applicants . Arianna Huffington said Wednesday evening that she conducted the interviews and the woman who had already been_on their staff for more_than a year was the most qualified . &quot; There was nobody like her , &quot; she said . &quot; She is a wonderful human being . My children adore her. &quot; She also said the couple paid all_of the necessary taxes for the woman . She said the woman left the Huffingtons ' employment shortly after Mike Huffington was sworn into office in January last year . Arianna Huffington said the woman did not want to make the move to Washington with the Huffingtons because she was married . The document issued by the campaign indicates that the approval for a work certificate was given by the Labor_Department on June 5 , 1991 . The work certificate , which does not allow the immigrant to remain in the country legally , permits the employer to seek INS approval for immigration . The next step is a years-long process of waiting for a &quot; green_card &quot; from the Immigration and Naturalization Service . The employee is not allowed to work in the country legally until the green_card is issued by the INS . The woman never obtained a green_card while working for the Huffingtons . Since 1986 , federal law has made_it a crime for employers to hire illegal immigrants . President Ronald Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act_on Nov . 6 , 1986 , requiring that employers verify workers ' citizenship status when they are hired by requesting personal documents such_as a U.S. passport , Social_Security card or driver ' s license . The act requires employers to prove the credentials were checked by filling_out an immigration document -- known as Form I9 -- that is to be completed by employers within three days of hiring a worker . The document is also to be maintained on file for inspection by the Immigration and Naturalization Service . Failure to complete the forms or maintain the records is itself a violation of federal law . The act provides civil penalties of up_to $ 10 # 000 for each illegal immigrant hired . Repeat violators may also be prosecuted criminally and face jail terms . The Times talked to four sources who once worked inside the Huffingtons ' $ 4-million home_in Santa Barbara who confirmed the employment of the illegal worker . They agreed to talk on condition that their names not be used . Huffington ' s household staff had more_than a dozen employees , including butlers , gardeners , security people , clerical help , drivers , maintenance workers and child_care providers . Huffington ' s campaign confirmed the story only after a Times reporter offered specific details of the illegal immigrant ' s employment . The woman began working for the Huffingtons in 1989 , the year their first daughter was born . At the time , Mike Huffington claimed separate residences , with the GOP candidate living_in Texas where he was an executive of his family ' s oil and gas_company . Mike Huffington said he moved to the Santa Barbara home_in 1991 , after the family company was sold . The candidate was involved in some of the hiring decisions on the staff at the Santa Barbara home , sources told The Times . One source said he was interviewed by both Huffington and his wife for a job in December , 1990 . One source said the illegal worker had also traveled_to Washington with the Huffingtons , where they own another home . In the Senate_race , immigration has already been a major issue between the candidates , with both Huffington and Feinstein disputing who would be tougher at enforcing immigration laws . Huffington staked out the conservative side of the issue last week when he endorsed Proposition 187 , the ballot measure that seeks to cut_off health and education benefits to illegal immigrants . Feinstein opposes Proposition 187 . Unlike Feinstein , Huffington also supports a constitutional amendment to prevent babies born to illegal immigrants in the United States from automatically becoming U.S. citizens . &quot; The hostility of this state toward illegal immigration has risen in direct proportion to the weakness of our political_leaders to enforce the immigration laws already on the books , &quot; Huffington said last week in announcing his position on Proposition 187 . &quot; We have allowed kids to cross the border , board our buses , use our schools , then return to their country while no one bats an eye , &quot; he said . &quot; We have allowed illegal aliens to stand_in line to receive post-earthquake housing aid , reassured that the Immigration and Naturalization Service won ' t ask any questions for fear of appearing ' discriminatory. ' &quot; We have cut corners , looked the other way and sent the wrong message -- that breaking the law pays , that only fools go_through the proper immigration channels . Well , no more . I believe Proposition 187 will finally draw_a_line between illegal immigration -- which is harmful and divisive -- and legal immigration -- which is beneficial to the nation and to California. &quot; In San Diego on Wednesday , Huffington repeated that theme in a discussion about border issues with a campaign crowd of about a dozen people . He also said he does not believe cracking_down on those who employ illegal immigrants is a good solution . He said in an interview that he does not support that approach , although it is the current law , unless a tamper-proof identification card is created . &quot; On the employer sanctions , I think it ' s important that we have . . . a tamper-proof identification card , preferably a Social_Security card , that says you are a citizen . So if you go_to an employer , that employer knows it ' s tamper-proof . So if you don ' t have it , you ' re not a citizen. &quot; &quot; The employer sanctions to me make a lot of sense , &quot; he added . &quot; My concern is if we don ' t have a tamper-proof card , there are forgeries out there and we can ' t hold an employer responsible if he has what he thinks is a citizenship paper. &quot; Another speaker at the meeting said , however , that employer sanctions were an important tool in the fight against illegal immigration . &quot; I think the real answer lies_in enforcing the employer sanctions , &quot; said T . J . Bonner , president of the National Border_Patrol Council , a group that represents 4 # 500 federal employees . &quot; If we cut_out the magnet which is attracting people to this country , we won ' t have to concentrate so_much at the borders. &quot; Huffington served in Congress when the so-called &quot; nannygate &quot; scandal erupted in Washington over two women considered by President Clinton for the job of attorney_general . Last January , Zoe Baird , Clinton ' s nominee , withdrew her name from consideration when it was disclosed that she had hired an illegal Peruvian couple for domestic_help and she had failed to pay their Social_Security taxes . Two weeks later , Federal Judge Kimba M . Wood withdrew her name after disclosing that she also had hired an illegal immigrant to work in her home as a nanny . Unlike Baird , however , Wood paid taxes and had hired her nanny before federal law made such hiring illegal . Feinstein ' s office said Wednesday that it researched past and present employees at the senator ' s home after the Baird and Wood incidents . A spokesman for the senator said there were no illegal immigrants on the staff . Times staff writers Richard Paddock in San Francisco , Mark Gladstone in Sacramento , Patrick J . McDonnell in Los Angeles and Greg Krikorian in San Diego contributed to this report .</TEXT>
