   <HEADLINE> TINY STRUCTURE IN BRAIN MAY BE KEY TO RECOGNIZING FEAR ; SCIENCE : RESEARCHERS SAY THE AMYGDALA HELPS READ SOCIAL SIGNALS AND LINKS THE MENTAL AND THE PHYSICAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is any text on human affairs so closely read as the faces of the men and women around us ? The vocabulary is unmistakable : the pursed lips of distaste , the widened eyes of fear , the wrinkled nose of disgust . To live without the ability to read such facial_expressions is to be illiterate in an almost universal , unspoken language of emotion . Now scientists have discovered &quot; rare and remarkable &quot; evidence that an almond-sized structure hidden deep within the human brain may be the key to recognizing the play of emotions in facial_expressions . Damage it and a person can no longer recognize fear in another ' s face . &quot; It is one of the most significant observations in the history of the study of facial_expressions , &quot; said Caltech neurobiologist John Allman . The provocative finding , made public Wednesday , adds_to a growing storehouse of tantalizing insights into the neurobiology of emotions . It hints at how a critical juncture in the brain serves as an intermediary between the mind ' s intangible intellectual activity and the body ' s more physical responses . Authorities said it also is evidence that the mind ' s emotions evolved in tandem with the body because fear -- so crucial to the functioning and survival of human_beings -- apparently occupies a distinct physical place in the brain , separate from the seat of any positive emotions . In research published today in the journal Nature , scientists at the Salk Institute in La Jolla and the University of Iowa College of Medicine have discovered that a part of the brain called the amygdala plays a central role in discerning human social signals . The organ is located near the base of the brain ' s gelatinous , three-pound sponge of tissue . The team reached its conclusions by studying an unusual patient -- &quot; a case in a_million &quot; -- in whom the amygdala cells had been destroyed by disease . Without the cluster of special neural cells , human_beings apparently cannot recognize fear , nor can they decipher the suite of emotions in more complex facial_expressions , the researchers said . But they have no trouble recognizing to whom a face belongs . What the researchers found most striking was that no positive emotions were affected . In this instance , the patient could not perceive fear in another ' s expression , yet had no trouble recognizing the broad smile and crinkled eyes of happiness . &quot; The patient looks_at a face of fear and she has no idea what she is seeing , &quot; he said . &quot; She can recognize happiness perfectly. &quot; She was asked to rate pictures of faces showing expressions of half_a_dozen basic emotions and put_through a variety of standard mental evaluation tests . &quot; This information is extremely important for our understanding of social behavior in_general , &quot; said Antonio R . Damasio , the neurologist who led the research team . &quot; What is at stake here is how we utilize a language not made_up of words or signs to communicate meaning to others. &quot; For centuries , philosophers and scientists have puzzled_over the relationship between the mind and the millions of neural cells that make_up the brain . Researchers have tried to decipher how the brain creates mental experience by studying monkeys , rats , snails and -- indirectly with computerized imaging techniques or brain-wave measurements -- human volunteers . Earlier studies with laboratory animals had convinced researchers that the tiny organ is crucial to the formation of emotional memories and fear responses . In a long series of experiments with laboratory animals , Dr. John L . McGaugh at the UC Irvine Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory pinpointed the amygdala as the site where adrenaline and other hormones affect memory . Using advanced computerized imaging techniques , other researchers have observed the way blood flows and pools in brains of human volunteers and determined that the organ also plays a central role in the onset of clinical_depression . It even appears to cement recollection of charged events more firmly in the mind , by linking emotions to long-term_memories . But until now , researchers had no direct way to plumb its function in the human brain . &quot; It opens the door to a different view of the brain , &quot; said Dr. Leslie Brothers , a UCLA research psychiatrist at West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical_Center who researches the role of the amygdala in non-human primates . &quot; I was thrilled . This makes_it very clear that the amygdala is involved in receiving social signals in humans. &quot; Several researchers cautioned that because the report concerns a test of impaired brain function in a single person , the results may_not be widely applicable . But other scientists said the finding fits neatly into a broad pattern of research results from animal experiments and tests of human patients with brain defects . &quot; It is consistent with lots of other emerging findings , &quot; McGaugh said . &quot; The basic premise is a strong one and is going_to gain ever-increasing support. &quot; In research that has not yet been published , for example , Damasio ' s group has tested a second patient with more severe neurological damage centered in the amygdala . He has lost the ability to recognize fear and anger in others , Allman said . A third patient , with less severe damage to the amygdala , is no longer able to tell in what direction someone is gazing . &quot; She literally could not tell whether someone was looking_at her or not , &quot; Allman said . &quot; It would make normal social discourse very impaired . If you can ' t make eye_contact with a person , it makes you very uncomfortable , &quot; he said . Damasio and several other scientists believe the research offers important evidence that the mind and the body evolved together , with primary emotions such_as fear becoming a separate and integral part of the brain because they play such an important role in survival . The amygdala is tightly connected to other parts of the brain responsible_for the &quot; fight-or-flight &quot; reflexes that are probably older than the human species itself . &quot; Not all emotions have the same value , &quot; Damasio said . &quot; It is quite likely that emotions such_as fear have a much higher adaptive value because it can signal a situation of danger . It has been segregated , selected and developed apart from others . This is the clue that neurobiology is giving us . &quot; An emotion is not a luxury . It is something vital for our survival because it is part and parcel of how we guide our behavior and reason , &quot; he said . &quot; This is woven into the fabric of our biology. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Mind and Emotion * The Discovery : When a part of the human brain called the amygdala is destroyed , a person no longer can recognize common emotions in facial_expressions , especially fear . * What It Means : It demonstrates how the brain acts_as a broker between intangible activities of the mind and physical responses , suggesting that primary emotions are an integral part of the brain ' s neural circuits .</TEXT>
