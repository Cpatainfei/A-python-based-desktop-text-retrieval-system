   <HEADLINE> CONDOR IN THE WILD TARGETED TO BE RECAPTURED ; ENDANGERED : THE VULTURE WILL BE RETURNED TO L.A. ZOO TO PREVENT HER FROM DYING OR TEACHING HAZARDOUS HABITS TO YOUNGER BIRDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the first two California_condors reintroduced into the wild of Ventura County backcountry in early 1992 is targeted for capture today to be returned to the Los Angeles Zoo . The 3-year-old female known as Xewe -- like three other condors captured and returned to the zoo two months ago -- had developed dangerous habits , flying from her new Santa Barbara County habitat back to populated areas of Ventura County and roosting on power_lines . The same behavior earlier killed four of the endangered vultures . Officials said the capture of Xewe ( pronounced GAY-wee ) is necessary to prevent her from dying in the wild or teaching the same bad habits to five younger_birds released late last year in the remote Lion Canyon area of Santa Barbara County , 60 miles northwest of the Sespe Condor Sanctuary near Fillmore . Biologists hope that Xewe ' s capture will mark the end of the large curious birds ' return flights into Ventura County , at least until their population is so large and well-established in Santa Barbara County that they come_back to the Fillmore area only to forage and explore , but not to roost . Xewe will now join the other three condors captured from the Sespe Condor Sanctuary as part of the captive breeding stock at the zoo and will most likely never be released into the wild again . &quot; On a personal level , we all hate for Xewe ' s sake to see her brought_in , &quot; said Michael Wallace , curator of conservation and science at the Los Angeles Zoo and leader of a team of experts who advise the U . S . Fish &amp; Wildlife Service on the project . &quot; I raised that bird . But we have to make the decision that is best for the overall population and not just for one individual. &quot; Marc M . Weitzel , Fish &amp; Wildlife condor recovery project leader , called the necessity for the decision unfortunate . But success is not measured with one bird , he said . &quot; It will be measured many years down the road , &quot; he said . &quot; Success will be establishing a core population in the wild. &quot; Lloyd Kiff , who led the condor recovery team for 10 years , said that Xewe ' s pattern of returning to the Sespe site actually is a good sign concerning the five younger_birds in the wild at Lion Canyon . &quot; This tells us the earliest experience is important in determining movement in later years , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' ve seen it happen with several birds now and that should bode well for the five at Lion Canyon , &quot; which were never in the more dangerous Sespe area . * Xewe , however , has been captured before and scientists are not at all certain that they will be successful today . She has steered clear of locations suitable for trapping with nets and roosted high above the ground . So biologists will try today to entice her with food into the same cave-like structure where she was held before her release two years ago . &quot; She ' s extremely trap-shy and leery of us , &quot; Weitzel said . Fish &amp; Wildlife Service biologists in_charge of a program to bring the condor back from the edge of extinction had hoped that Xewe would act_as mentor to the five younger_birds released in Lion Canyon last year , showing them how to roost , forage and nest . Instead , Xewe ' s homing instinct proved too strong , and she returned to the Sespe Condor Sanctuary where she was first released more_than two years ago . She has been seen roosting near Castaic Lake , flying over Fillmore and landing on power_lines . The eldest of the free-flyers , with bright red eyes and a 9-foot wingspan , Xewe also does not appear to be foraging for food or finding carrion on_her_own , going more_than three weeks without food until biologists put_out a calf carcass for her . Rather than leave her to die of accident or starvation , or spend valuable hours to keep her alive in a separate location from the main program in Lion Canyon , biologists decided to begin trying to trap her . * The population of California_condors , which once roamed the North_American continent by the thousands , had dwindled to only 27 birds in April , 1987 , when the last wild condor was trapped and brought_in to the captive breeding program . That bird , known as AC-9 , fathered Xewe in captivity . The $ 15-million , 14-year program has been controversial from the start , drawing objections from the National Audubon Society and other groups . But the program stayed_on track , producing new young every year . In January , 1992 , Xewe and a male condor , Chocuyens ( pronounced Che-KOO-yenz ) , were released into the Sespe , becoming the first two to fly free since 1987 . They carried with them the biologists ' hopes for the successful reintroduction of the species into the wild . Kiff said that day that he felt &quot; consummated and vindicated. &quot; Biologists had always said they expected deaths in the program , but they were surprised when the first one came so soon . Chocuyens became the first casualty in the program 10 months later when he died after drinking anti-freeze . * Two months later , six more birds were released into the Sespe . But the birds could not stay_away_from populated areas , and over the course of the next 10 months , three of them died in collisions with power_lines or poles . In December , 1993 , scientists decided to recapture the remaining four birds , including Xewe , and transfer them to Santa Barbara County in an area surrounded by mountains . In March of this year , however , three of the Sespe birds returned to their first home_in the Sespe , and scientists feared they would be subject_to the same dangers that killed the birds the previous year . The three Sespe birds were captured and returned to the L . A . Zoo , where they remain . Including Xewe and the five at Lion Canyon , there are now 85 California_condors alive , and up_to eight more are expected to hatch by the end of the season . Scientists hope to eventually establish at least three populations of 100 birds each in California , New Mexico and Arizona .</TEXT>
