   <HEADLINE> VEGAS GALA SHAPES UP AS A JACKSON FAMILY GAMBLE ; BENEFIT : SLOW TICKET SALES FORCE PRICE_CUTS , WHILE MICHAEL ' S ROLE IN TONIGHT ' S SHOW IS MINIMAL . SOME MONEY IS EARMARKED FOR CHARITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When announced last summer , NBC ' s &quot; The Jackson Family Honors &quot; was shaping_up as a massive charity gala featuring a rare live TV performance by Michael Jackson . It was to be staged in Atlantic_City in December . With the concert finally on_tap tonight in Las Vegas , much of the sheen has rubbed_off : * Despite indications as late as last week by executive producer Jermaine Jackson that his brother would perform a solo number on the show , Michael ' s press representative announced Wednesday that it won ' t happen . Michael will simply sing one song with the family and present humanitarian awards to Elizabeth Taylor and Motown Records founder Berry Gordy . * At the same 12 # 000-seat MGM Grand Hotel arena where Barbra Streisand recently sold_out two shows in less than an hour , tickets were still remaining for the two-hour TV taping as of Friday morning . The slow sales are why prices on thousands of mid-level tickets were cut Wednesday from $ 350 to $ 150 , sources said . Other tickets range from $ 50 to $ 1 # 000 for special charity packages . * Though the &quot; musical benefit &quot; could garner up_to $ 6 million in TV broadcast fees and ticket revenues if the concert sells_out , only $ 500 # 000 is formally pledged to charities not controlled by the Jacksons . The remaining $ 5.5 million would be paid to a Jackson Family nonprofit foundation -- never mentioned in the concert ' s ads -- to cover production_costs , including expenses incurred when the show had to be moved from Atlantic_City to Las Vegas , organizers say . * Hopes for corporate sponsorships to underwrite the cost of the production vanished after Michael Jackson was accused by a 13-year-old boy last August of sexual molestation . The corporate sponsorship figure once being bounced around in the industry was $ 6 million . &quot; The challenge for me was to just make_it happen , &quot; said Jermaine Jackson , executive producer of the show and president of Jackson Communications Inc. , the corporation staging the event . &quot; It was a major challenge just to overcome all_the obstacles . Even now , we ' re still putting_out fires. &quot; NBC will air the MGM Grand Garden arena show on Tuesday . The event marks Michael Jackson ' s first formal stage appearance since cutting_short a world concert tour in November because of a drug_addiction he said stemmed partially from dealing with the molestation claims . The entertainer denied the allegations , but reportedly paid more_than $ 10 million last month to settle a lawsuit filed by the boy . No criminal charges have been lodged against the singer . Jackson ' s sister Janet and brother Jermaine will perform solo and the Jackson 5 ( minus Michael ) are expected to stage a number stocked with 29 Jackson relatives , including mom and pop Katherine and Joe Jackson . LaToya Jackson , who has claimed she and her siblings grew_up in an abusive household and who publicly has questioned brother Michael ' s sexual behavior , is not expected to attend . Other musical guests scheduled to perform include Gladys Knight , Smokey Robinson and Celine Dion . &quot; It was most important to bring the family together to help the less fortunate in the world , &quot; Jermaine Jackson said . &quot; The idea behind this whole_thing is to give_back . It ' s a charitable event . We ' re not getting paid_for this . It ' s been a long process and it ' s been worth it all. &quot; The executive producer said &quot; net proceeds &quot; from the event will be donated to the Permanent Charities Committee of the Entertainment_Industry , a Studio City-based 52-year-old fund-raising arm of the show_business community . * The plan is for Permanent Charities Committee to distribute a maximum $ 500 # 000 donation , mostly for California earthquake relief , to Northridge Medical_Center , St . John ' s Hospital in Santa Monica , the American Red_Cross and the Salvation_Army , with lesser amounts earmarked for the Friends of Conservation and the Library of Congress ' American Popular Music Program . If the show sells_out , concert promoters speculate that the 12 # 000 tickets could generate an estimated $ 2.5 million . Representatives for the Jacksons said the family ' s firm already has secured an additional $ 3.5 million in broadcast fees from NBC in the United States and 25 other stations around the world . The company could generate more revenue if successful in marketing the show to other countries after it airs next week . A spokesman for the Jackson camp said that if the show sells_out , approximately $ 5.5 million would be paid to Jackson Jubilee Inc. , a New Jersey-based nonprofit group , to cover the administrative and production_costs of putting_on the project . A lawyer for the family said that Jackson Jubilee was incorporated under New Jersey law on Nov . 8 , 1993 , and that applications have been filed for nonprofit status . The Internal Revenue Service , the New Jersey Charities Registration Office and the California Registry of Charitable Trusts have no record of the group on file . Undisclosed portions of the $ 5.5 million will be paid to Jackson Communications Inc. , a family corporation , and Gary Smith , the Emmy-winning producer behind the 200-person , $ 3-million production , as well as_to TWI , a New York agency that negotiated the international broadcast fees . Representatives for the Jacksons said no one in the family will make money on the event . * The &quot; Jackson Family Honors &quot; was originally scheduled for taping in Atlantic_City on Dec . 11 to be broadcast as an NBC special on Jan . 10 . Corporate sponsors that expressed interest last year in financing the project dropped_out after Michael Jackson disappeared and reportedly checked_into a London drug-treatment clinic . The show is being produced by Jackson Communications Inc. The company , based in Iselin , N.J. , was formed by Jermaine , his parents and real_estate attorney Robert Petrallia in 1991 to pursue the possible development of an entertainment-oriented urban-renewal project in Asbury Park . The firm , which is reportedly involved in real_estate and talent management , negotiated a six-year deal last April with NBC to broadcast the award show annually , sources said . &quot; The company was set_up to give the ( Jackson ) family an opportunity to develop a dynastic quality very much in the tradition of the Rockefellers and the Vanderbilts , &quot; said Petrallia , who is JCI ' s chairman and chief_executive_officer . &quot; But it also has a very big interest in participating in activities that improve the quality_of_life around the world . Virtually every project we do has some nonprofit aspect to it. &quot; NBC officials said that when the licensing_agreement was first reached between the network and Jackson Communications last summer , the event was designed strictly as an entertainment special . It was only after the plans were under way that the Jacksons decided to turn the event into a benefit , network officials said . The network added that it researched the listed charities to verify that they were legitimate , but that NBC is not involved in the distribution of the funds to those charities . Reportedly , the controversy surrounding Michael Jackson and the other members of the family has not impaired commercial sales for the TV_show . The show was nearly sold_out as of late last week . Major advertisers such_as MCI , Volkswagen , General Foods and Procter &amp; Gamble bought_time at the rate of $ 130 # 000 per 30 seconds , which is about average for this kind of programming . &quot; You can ' t ignore the adverse publicity , but this is one of these situations that you look_at from a client-by-client situation , &quot; said Douglas Seay , senior_vice_president of national broadcast for Hal Riney &amp; Associates , a New York-based agency . Seay said he was considering buying_time on the special for clients : &quot; As a package , this show makes_for good counter-programming for the Olympics . There ' s an automatic interest factor , not unlike a tawdry soap opera. &quot; Philips is a free-lance writer and Braxton is a Times staff writer .
