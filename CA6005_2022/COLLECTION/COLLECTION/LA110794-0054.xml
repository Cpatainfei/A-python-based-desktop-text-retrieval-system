   <HEADLINE> SCREENING ROOM : ' SEX , DRUGS ' SHOWS THE NETHERLANDS ' PERSPECTIVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although rambling and repetitive , Jonathan Blank ' s important , comprehensive documentary , &quot; Sex , Drugs and Democracy &quot; ( Friday at the Nuart for one week ) reveals how effectively the Netherland ' s progressive society works in regulating , rather than banning , drugs and prostitution , and in providing civil_rights for one and all . Apparently , Holland ' s history as a small country of pragmatic traders has made_for its unusually enlightened views . ( 310 ) 478-6379 . Far less effective , Victor Ginzburg ' s &quot; The Restless Garden &quot; ( Friday at the Sunset 5 for one week ) , ostensibly surveys the crumbling Soviet_Union ' s sexual revolution , but is mainly interested in presenting as_many Russian beauties in the nude as possible ; lots of arty dance sequences , one truly poignant moment when a breathtakingly gorgeous young_woman talks in halting English of drifting into prostitution . ( 213 ) 848-3500 . The American Cinematheque ' s Eric Rohmer weekend retrospective at the Directors Guild commences Friday at 7:15 p.m. with his knockout first feature , &quot; The Sign of Leo &quot; ( 1959 ) , perversely never released in the United States and actually more impressive and involving than such later prestige talkathons as &quot; My Night at Maud ' s. &quot; In a fable cleverly invoking the role of random fate and raising the question of whether we are our brother ' s keeper , irony compounds irony as a big , amiable American expatriate ( burly Jess Hahn in a rare starring role ) faces utter destitution as his French friends flee a sweltering Paris in August . Also unfamiliar and equally outstanding , the astringent , acutely observant 1967 &quot; La Collectionneuse &quot; ( Saturday at 5 p.m. ) stars Patrick Bauchau ( who will speak after the screening ) in a superb portrayal of a classically French erotic gamesman , a snobbish aesthete who condescends to -- but cannot quite dismiss -- the self-possessed young_woman ( Haydee Politoff ) his friend unexpectedly brings along on a St . Tropez vacation . For full schedule : ( 213 ) 466-FILM . The American Film Institute ' s eighth Americas Film Festival commences an 11-day run Friday at the Monica 4-Plex with Sergio Cabrera ' s &quot; The Strategy of the Snail , &quot; a wry , warm account of the residents of an old Bogota apartment_house fighting_off a demolition order . The film , which screens at 6:45 and 9:15 , became one of the most popular in Colombia ' s history and is that country ' s official entry into the Oscars . An opening weekend standout is Adrian Rudomin ' s riveting , rigorous &quot; Land of Darkness , &quot; ( Saturday at 4 p.m. ) , a 75-minute USC student production starring John Rocha in a powerhouse portrayal of a young , idealistic priest mistakenly forced into the federal army during the Mexican_Revolution , plunging him into a bitter and astonishing spiritual odyssey . ( 310 ) 394-9741 . In conjunction with &quot; Zine Scream ' 94 , &quot; a celebration of the self-publishing scene , Filmforum has come_up with an appropriately outlandish program , screening at Hollywood Moguls tonight at 8 , of short films , some of which are mainly an obscure blur , some merely tedious but others lots of fun . Perhaps the most accessible is Momita SenGupta ' s mischievous &quot; Androgynous , &quot; about the honeymoon adventures of a cross-dressing couple -- she ' s a Sharon Stone type who dresses like a tough_guy , he ' s a black_man who wears dresses and makeup . Greta Snyder ' s rightly disturbing &quot; Our Gay Brothers &quot; is a collage , mainly of old found footage , celebrating women in all their variety -- and also gay_men , suggesting an alliance between the two -- while on the soundtrack we hear a group of gays discuss female sexuality in the crudest terms possible . With &quot; The Leash Men &quot; Kurt Keppler reworks clips of men fishing to skewer deftly their sport while Michael Gitlin , using random snippets of dialogue and eerie visuals , evokes a highly contemporary aura of paranoia . Michael Le Haie and Jonathan Stein ' s &quot; Critizen &quot; is an affectionate portrait of San Francisco ' s Sean Bosker , a young intellectual prankster , who among other activities , has the courage to go_to Fisherman ' s Wharf buck naked and ask the tourists , &quot; Seen any good sights ? &quot; Weirdest , most imaginative of all is Michael Collins ' &quot; This Is a Dead Boy , &quot; which intentionally or otherwise plays like a spoof of a Dennis Cooper novel in which the King of Bad News slays a boy , yanks out the kid ' s left eye , which goes_on to have a life of its own . ( 213 ) 466-4143 . For information about &quot; Zine Scream ' 94 , &quot; ( 213 ) 936-3039 .</TEXT>
