   <TEXT> * As the author of a bill to restructure the Los Angeles Unified School District , I am disappointed by your article dealing with the tough questions of how to pay_for &quot; categorical programs &quot; like special_education . In an in-depth article ( &quot; Allocation of School Funds Spurs Competing Demands , &quot; June 2 ) , The Times focused_on $ 212 million , or about 6 % of the district ' s $ 3.9-billion budget , which is being spent on special_education and integration services . My bill in the state Legislature , AB 1635 , would fundamentally change the way in which the LAUSD spends money . The district would only get 5 % to pay_for administration , with the remaining 95 % going_to the local school sites . AB 1635 makes_sure that money for special_education and other &quot; categorical &quot; programs follows the pupils in a flexible way that gives our schools autonomy . The administration could hold_back no more_than 10 % of that money , for buildings and other districtwide costs . This is a tremendous improvement over how those funds are budgeted now . The taxpayers are tired_of paying_for a huge bureaucracy and it ' s no wonder that the debate over Los Angeles Unified is stormy . Had The Times given my bill a good look , you could have told people that a broad new solution is in the works . BETTY KARNETTE Assembly , D-Long Beach</TEXT>
