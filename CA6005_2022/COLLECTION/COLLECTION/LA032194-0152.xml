   <TEXT> A powerful aftershock to the Northridge earthquake rolled across Southern California on Sunday , starting two fires , briefly disrupting power to thousands of San Fernando Valley residents and sending people fleeing from stores and movie_theaters , but causing little damage . The 5.3 magnitude quake , centered near Panorama City , was felt over a wide area of Los Angeles and Orange counties when it hit at 1:20 p.m. It was the third-strongest of more_than 5 # 000 aftershock to hit the region since the Jan . 17 quake , which killed at least 61 people and caused at least $ 13 billion in structural damage . Freeways sustained some cracking in the aftershock , but none were closed , officials said . Los Angeles city Fire_Department officials said two fires were started by the earthquake . A mini-mall blaze in Van Nuys began because of electrical damage caused by the quake , and a transformer at a Department of Water and Power_plant near Burbank Airport caught_fire after earthquake damage caused oil in the unit to overheat , said Jim Wells , a Fire_Department spokesman . A Sherman Oaks house , moved off its foundation by the Jan . 17 quake and scheduled for demolition today , was sent sliding another 25 feet down the hillside . The shaker rattled nerves as well , although no injuries were reported . For fans camped outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for tonight ' s Oscar ceremonies , the quake was a second authentic L.A. experience -- but it did not move them from their cherished places . Rhea Sprecher , an art_teacher from Wisconsin , still managed to spot Debbie Allen , Goldie Hawn and others . &quot; I felt some rumbling under my feet and I said : ' Would that be an earthquake ? ' &quot; Inside , where organizers were rehearsing the introduction for the visual effects Oscar , chandeliers swayed , the seats rocked and huge pieces of scenery rattled . &quot; Everybody , stay in your seats ! &quot; Oscar director Jeff Margolis ordered over the public_address_system . In Malibu , a minor rockslide failed to disrupt traffic . And in Santa Monica , life in the bustling Third Street Promenade shopping and dining_area was back to normal shortly after the temblor stopped . &quot; Seismically , this is a very expected behavior . Probably the big news_story in this earthquake is people ' s nerves , &quot; said Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton . Although authorities reported little damage to homes and businesses , hundreds of people were evacuated from malls and theaters in the San Fernando Valley area . As a precaution , about 1 # 000 people were removed from IKEA , a home furnishings store in Burbank . Despite shoppers ' anxiety , the evacuation was quick and orderly , said Dennis Rodriguez , the store ' s operations manager . &quot; People were a little frightened . We got workers together with customers and guided them downstairs , &quot; Rodriguez said . Some children were separated from parents but were reunited outside the building , he said . Another 500 shoppers were evacuated from the Fashion Square Mall in Sherman Oaks , where the aftershock shattered plate_glass alongside an escalator and sent some overhead spotlights crashing to the floor . No one was injured at the mall , where the first 34 of the complex ' s 140 stores closed since the Jan . 17 quake reopened Saturday , employees said . &quot; We had the rain yesterday and another aftershock today , &quot; said Bob Smith , a mall employee . &quot; It ' s been a tough weekend. &quot; At Valley movie_theaters , patrons fled their seats as they were showered with broken plaster and other debris . James Booth of Burbank was_on a bucket lift filling cracks on the second floor of the Cal State Northridge science building when the shaking hit . &quot; I thought it was this jackass shaking the bottom of the lift , &quot; Booth said , pointing to a co-worker . &quot; I thought the entire building was going_to come down. &quot; In the Mid-City area , Percy Bennett ' s furniture and appliance store still had plywood up from the Jan . 17 quake , which shattered its glass front . Inside , another souvenir of Jan . 17 is the ceiling that still has a hole the size of a big screen TV . On Sunday , Bennett just pulled his merchandise out onto the sidewalk and kept working . &quot; This quake was nothing compared to that big one , &quot; he said . &quot; I was sitting here on this ( exercise_bike ) just peddling along when I started swaying . But yeah , I sure could feel it. &quot; A Santa Monica conference of the Anxiety_Disorders Assn . of America ended with a bang as the quake struck . &quot; I tell you , the timing couldn ' t have been better . It was the last_day , the last minute , the last second and it hit . It was pretty ironic , &quot; said association President Jerilyn Ross . At Disneyland in Anaheim , some of the more elaborate attractions were temporarily closed_down . At Universal Studios in Universal City , all attractions closed immediately after the quake . Chris Cangco of Glendale was_on a tram going_over a bridge that falls_apart as part of the special_effects tour when the quake hit . &quot; I didn ' t realize it was an earthquake at the time . I thought it was an effect of the . . . tram. &quot; The ride continued , and only when the 45-minute trip ended did someone inform the riders that a real earthquake had hit . The aftershock knocked_out power to about 77 # 000 San Fernando Valley residents , most for five minutes or less , DWP spokeswoman Mindy Berman said . However , about 7 # 000 customers in Van Nuys were without electricity for half an hour . Caltrans reported minor damage to freeways near the epicenter of the aftershock but none serious enough to close any roads . On the Golden State Freeway north of Granada Hills , the aftershock dislodged temporary asphalt filler that had been used to close a 6-to-8-inch gap caused by the Northridge quake . Temporary asphalt fixes also came loose in a concrete overpass at the interchange of the Simi Valley and San Diego freeways . Caltrans crews quickly refilled the gaps without shutting_down any freeways . &quot; It ' s not something that would alarm anyone , &quot; said Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli . &quot; It ' s super-minor. &quot; Caltech seismologists said the aftershock was expected , and in the normal range . &quot; This is perfectly normal . This is what we expect , &quot; said Egill Hauksson , a seismologist at Caltech . He said Sunday ' s shaking occurred on the east_side of the fault plane where the main shock occurred on Jan . 17 , but was not on the same fault . The aftershock was centered about two miles west-northwest of Panorama City , and about three miles northeast of the epicenter of the Northridge quake , said Hutton , within a &quot; pie-shaped aftershock zone &quot; where shocks have been clustered . The aftershock was closer to the surface than the Northridge quake , with preliminary estimates putting it about nine miles below the earth ' s surface , compared to 12 miles for the main Jan . 17 temblor . With a preliminary magnitude of 5.3 , the quake is 1 / 20 the magnitude of the main Jan . 17 quake . Hutton said the number of aftershocks continues to decline each month . Sunday ' s temblor &quot; is an aftershock , but it is also an earthquake on its own &quot; and will produce its own aftershocks , she said . However , there is only a 1 in 20 chance that it was a foreshock to a larger quake . A 3.4 magnitude aftershock was recorded at 3:34 p.m. Sunday , and another reading 2.7 hit at 8:05 p.m. , seismologists said . Meanwhile , a spokesman for Farmers Insurance Co . said Sunday ' s major aftershock could temporarily suspend earthquake insurance underwriting in the region . &quot; Geologists may call this an aftershock , but this is a separate quake for insurance purposes , &quot; Jeffrey Beyer said . State law allows insurers to impose a moratorium of up_to 60 days on sales of earthquake insurance after a quake occurs . A moratorium after the Jan . 17 Northridge quake covered about 100 square_miles and lasted no more_than 30 days at many companies . &quot; I don ' t know of any moratoriums still in_effect , &quot; Bill Schulz , spokesman for the state_Department of Insurance , said . The aftershock prompted some business owners and authorities to close some public structures so they could check for structural damage . In Burbank , owners shut_down the 75-store Media City_Center mall for the day after sprinklers jolted by the aftershock drenched some shoppers . City building inspectors also ordered the mall parking structure closed until it could be inspected , said Lt . Don Brown of the Burbank Police_Department . At the Glendale Galleria , &quot; we heard the building just rumble , &quot; said Drew Boghorsyan of the mall ' s customer services_department . Merchants at 26 of the mall ' s 248 stores closed_up shop to go_home , but Boghorsyan knew of no damage . A spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District said schools will be open as usual today , although workers will inspect repairs from the January quake to make_sure they held . In all , 76 public_schools were damaged in January . Doug Brown , the district ' s facilities director , said : &quot; We will be out at the schools where there was previous damage to make_sure the repairs are still holding . &quot; We ' re going to hit the ones that had the most damage and the least permanent repair work done and work our way back from there. &quot; The Washington , D.C.-based Anxiety_Disorders Assn . had been discussing such problems as quake-related stress in its four-day conference at the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel . As the final seminar drew to a close Sunday , the fifth-floor banquet room began to shake and the chandeliers rattled noisily . The seminar ended with applause and laughter -- for the quake . On Friday , the conference had featured a seminar called &quot; The Los Angeles Earthquake and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. &quot; And some of the psychiatrists and social_workers later kidded one another about earthquakes . &quot; Jokingly , we who ' d never experienced an earthquake said : ' Gee , I wish I could feel just a little one so I could know what it feels_like , ' &quot; Ross said .
