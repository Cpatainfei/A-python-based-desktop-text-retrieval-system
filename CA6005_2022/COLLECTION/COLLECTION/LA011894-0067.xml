   <HEADLINE> THE WEEK AHEAD : KIEV ; NEXT NUCLEAR TEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ukraine ' s Parliament is scheduled to meet today for the first time since President Leonid M . Kravchuk announced an historic agreement with the United States and Russia to eliminate all nuclear_weapons on Ukrainian soil . The Parliament , or Rada , is expected to be deeply divided and could even reject the disarmament deal that was the highlight of President Clinton ' s trip to the former Soviet_Union last week . Kravchuk argues that because the trilateral agreement signed Friday in Moscow was a &quot; statement , &quot; and not a treaty , it does not require parliamentary approval . Key lawmakers disagree , and could demand the treaty be submitted for ratification or rejection .</TEXT>
