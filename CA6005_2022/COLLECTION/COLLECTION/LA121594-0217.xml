   <HEADLINE> POP BEAT : PUNKS INSURE US AGAINST MUSICAL BANKRUPTCY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We live_in wondrous times . Who would have guessed that braying , irreverent punk_rockers would give a substantial boost to Orange County ' s civic image ( at least in rock ' n ' roll circles ) , as the triple platinum-selling Offspring have done ? And that respectably conservative politicians would manage to turn O.C. into a laughingstock , its public pride and confidence splotched with gushing graffiti sprays of red ink ? While the pols scramble to clean_up their mess , the punks keep coming , looking_to do their bit for community pride by committing sonic mayhem . At the core of ADZ are three players who were part of the county ' s first punk blast 15 years ago ; Guttermouth and the Grabbers are newcomers with albums steeped in local punk traditions . All recognize that brevity is the soul of punk , turning_in 11- or 13-track albums that clock_in at 22 ( Guttermouth ) , 29 ( ADZ ) and 32 ( the Grabbers ) minutes . Ratings range from * ( Chapter 9 ) to * * * * ( Cloud 9 ) . Three stars denote a solid recommendation . * * * 1 / 2 ADZ : &quot; Where Were You ? &quot; ; Lethal Rikk Agnew , Tony Brandenburg and Casey Royer have something approaching 50 years ' collective experience in punk_rock , but their most glorious moment came early on , when they were three-fifths of the lineup on the Adolescents ' 1981 debut album . &quot; Adolescents &quot; is the one O.C. punk album to hear if you ' re hearing just one , although that proposition might be taken as fighting words by certain partisans of Agent_Orange , T.S.O.L. and Social Distortion . Though the lineup was short-lived , the original Adolescents ' continuing impact has led to periodic reunions that still can generate a crowd . &quot; Where Were You ? &quot; is the first album to feature as_many as three of the five original members since the excellent but overlooked &quot; Balboa Fun Zone &quot; ( 1988 ) . The ADZ reunion brings inconsistent results ranging from flat throwaways to a_few highlights that could be mistaken for lost outtakes from the classic Adolescents debut . The Rikk-Tony-Casey realliance was brief : Only singer Brandenburg , whose new nom de stage is Tony Reflex following previous incarnations as Tony Cadena , Tony Montana and Tony Adolescent , remains in the band . Guitarist Agnew evidently fell from the others ' good graces before &quot; Where Were You ? &quot; was even finished : He is the target of scorn on a song called &quot; Rikki Headcheese. &quot; Royer , the drummer on the ADZ album , carries_on as front_man in D.I. , a post he ' s held since 1983 . Rounding_out the recording lineup , and remaining in a revamped stage lineup led by Reflex , are guitarist Rodger Ramjet and bassist Mike Rouse . The opening theme_song , &quot; A-D-Z , &quot; suggests that the band isn ' t infected by any sense of its own historical importance : &quot; It ' s the same three chords . . . playing songs ' cause we ' re bored / A-D-Z. &quot; Along with those three chords come Tony ' s always-convincing ( if one-dimensional ) snarls , screams and growls and a persuasive band attack bolstered by massed , anthem harmonies from a younger band of punk contenders , Face to Face . But boredom sometimes afflicts the songwriting . &quot; Where Were You ? &quot; is a dull account of a men ' s-room altercation at a punk show . &quot; Car Crash &quot; looks toward an oddly pointless target for its routine venting of punk obnoxiousness -- the scornful lyrics sketch the circumstances of the auto wrecks that claimed ' 50s / ' 60s pop icons James Dean , Ernie Kovacs and Jayne Mansfield . &quot; Solitaire &quot; is flat , and &quot; Adnauseum Dub &quot; ( sic -- you expect punks to get Latin spellings right ? ) is an aptly titled musical joke invoking the spacey , echoing atmosphere of a reggae &quot; dub &quot; mix . On the plus side , when ADZ manages to write a good , catchy , shout-along cadence into a song , the band knows how to ride it . &quot; Flyswatter &quot; echoes a Wire nugget , &quot; 1-2-X-U , &quot; but it ' s a worthy theft , while the anti-cop &quot; Riot on Sunset &quot; and the anti-drug &quot; Some Kind of Fun &quot; give Mr. Reflex a chance to impress by vomiting sardonic antagonism all_over his targets . The aforementioned &quot; Rikki Headcheese &quot; may be unkind in its taunting of an erstwhile band mate , but it at least does Agnew the honor of hoisting him on_his_own musical petard -- the song surges with the dense swarm of harmonized guitars that he and his brother Frank turned_into a much-copied signature of the early Adolescents ' sound . Stay_away_from this if you think it ' s tawdry to milk the punk past ; those who feed_on old punk should be pleased at just how hard ADZ can milk it . ( Available from Lethal Records , P.O. Box 14868 , Long_Beach , CA , 90803-1414. ) * ADZ plays tonight at the Showcase Theatre , 683 S . Main St. , Corona . ( 909 ) 340-0988 . * * * 1 / 2 Guttermouth : &quot; Friendly People &quot; ; Nitro Pals and sometime touring partners of the Offspring , Guttermouth is now the first band on the new record label that the Offspring ' s Bryan Holland and Greg Kriesel are financing with part of their haul from &quot; Smash. &quot; Guttermouth covets the Vandals ' old handle as snotty , irreverent , all-purpose punk satirists who hold nothing sacred . If you don ' t laugh , they ' ve failed . On &quot; Chaps My Hide , &quot; a mercifully brief ditty about the adult equivalent of diaper_rash , they ' re so puerile that you can only wonder whether they ' re still in diapers themselves . But numbers like &quot; Jamie ' s Petting Zoo , &quot; a gruesome little song designed to win the revulsion of animal-lovers everywhere , and &quot; can ' t We All Just Get Along ( at the Dinner_Table ) , &quot; score satiric points while reveling in willful breaches of politically correct good citizenship . The latter is the album ' s best joke : Guttermouth slips into a General_Assembly ' s worth of silly foreign accents while suggesting flippantly that keeping a multicultural table might be the recipe for international harmony . The band has fun by mockingly espousing just the sort of banal idea that extreme proponents of multiculturalism might put forth in all seriousness -- peace ' n ' harmony advancing , like the army , on its stomach . &quot; Derek &quot; picks a fight with an opposing punk faction , the &quot; straight edge &quot; brigade that shuns all intoxicants , including alcohol . &quot; Disneyland &quot; finds Guttermouth claiming common_ground with Sting in decrying the bulldozing of tropical_rain_forests . While the tirade may be sincere , its juice comes from Mark Adkins ' snide attitude rather than from the substance of the argument . For the album ' s profanely titled closing track , Guttermouth adopts a comically nihilistic , we-hate-everything stance that looks_back to the Adolescents ' &quot; Creatures &quot; and &quot; I Hate Children. &quot; There ' s a hollowness in all-purpose mockery when it doesn ' t reveal a firm moral foundation . Guttermouth , if only glancingly , does stand on that old punk standby , individualism , as a core value that ' s being advanced in slaps at the herd mentality . More often , Guttermouth just delights in being silly and rude for the fun of it . The band ' s musical foundation is strong , if familiar , as received punk styles ( including some of that Adolescents massed-guitar sound ) are executed crisply and with lots of punch -- especially on a galloping instrumental , &quot; Summers Over. &quot; ( Available from Nitro Records , 7151 Warner Ave. , Suite E-736 , Huntington Beach , CA , 92647. ) * Guttermouth and Face to Face play Dec . 31 at the Ice House , 112 E . Walnut Ave. , Fullerton . ( 714 ) 740-3052 . * * * 1 / 2 The Grabbers : &quot; The Way I Am &quot; ; Doctor Dream All the Grabbers ever do is complain ; what makes them tolerable , and even enjoyable , is the unfettered garage-punk that carries singer-lyricist Tommy Macke ' s sour observations about messed-up relationships and life as a stacked deck . Instead of looking_to the speeding , hard-core sound , the Grabbers gain extra heft by slowing the tempos a bit and letting the guitars slice and careen in homage to the Sex Pistols . Like their label-mates , Cadillac Tramps , the Grabbers get lots of mileage out of a high-voltage double-guitar attack and shout-along refrains . Those massed vocals help compensate for Macke ' s somewhat thin lead voice . Lyrically , the Grabbers ' alienation is most affecting when expressed obliquely so that it takes_on a mood of creeping anxiety , as on &quot; Kodac Moment &quot; and a cover of Dream Syndicate ' s &quot; Days of Wine and Roses. &quot; When the only point is to vent spleen , things get pretty ugly . &quot; Lost all control , now turn and run / I ' ll cut_out your tongue and I ' ll call it fun , &quot; Macke advises one of the insufficiently faithful or understanding women who are his frequent targets . Of course , the character making these threats and moaning about betrayals is a sodden drunk or drug_addict who clearly hasn ' t earned anybody ' s faith or understanding . The album title suggests that we take the songs as a composite character sketch . In the end , with &quot; So It Seems , &quot; a glimmer of self-awareness dawns on our antihero after the woman in whom he had placed his hopes has finally abandoned him : I believed_in nothing , so it seems Sit alone and watch TV Wonder what will happen to me if I don ' t straighten_out my life I ' m living_in a daze , looking_at life through a haze Stronger melodies and a countervailing humor or poignancy would have helped the Grabbers give this grim study more dimension . But the cumulative weight of the album ' s consistently driving , trenchant music makes_it worth hearing them out . ( Available from Doctor Dream Records , 841 W .
