   <HEADLINE> MCGEE ' S MIND BACK ON GAME ; AFTER SHOOTING , TRANSFERS , HE ' S READY TO PLAY AGAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jon McGee was in Norman , Okla. , half a continent removed from where gunfire had inexplicably found him in a place where he had least expected it , when it dawned on him . He hated football . &quot; I didn ' t like watching it on TV , I didn ' t like playing it , I didn ' t like playing football video_games , &quot; he said . &quot; Just about anything that had to do with football , I didn ' t like . I got_to that point. &quot; Ordinarily , of course , such feelings would not be cause for alarm . But they concerned McGee because he excelled_at football and had always enjoyed it . At the time , in fact , he was attending the University of Oklahoma on a football scholarship . Several months earlier , in the fall of 1992 , he had been playing for USC , waiting for practice to start at Howard Jones Field , when he was struck by gang-related gunfire about a quarter-mile away . A stray bullet passed completely through his left arm above the elbow , an injury that surely must rank among the least common -- and most traumatic -- ever suffered on a football_field . It could have hit Rob Johnson or Willie McGinest or Tony Boselli , any of the Trojans ' stars . Instead , it struck McGee , a promising freshman linebacker who had been a prep All-American a year earlier at Sahuaro High in Tucson but had yet to make his mark at USC . Two years later , McGee , 20 , suffers no physical ill effects from the injury but is still trying to find his way in college football . He has transferred twice , most recently to Arizona in hometown Tucson , where he is a walk-on trying to earn a scholarship as he sits_out this season . Psychologists , he said , have told him that he has suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome , a mental_disorder sparked by exposure to violent incidents that return as recurrent images , disrupting normal life . Symptoms include nightmares , insomnia and depression . In McGee ' s case , they also included an aversion to football . &quot; I think part of it is that it happened on the football_field , and he had to go_back and look_at the football_field every day , &quot; said his father , Mike , no relation_to former USC Athletic Director Mike McGee . &quot; I guess your mind does funny things to you . . . . &quot; It ' s just like this girl ( Monica Seles ) who got stabbed on the tennis_court . She ' s making umpteen millions of dollars a year and she can ' t go_back . It ' s a psychological thing. &quot; Some won ' t understand it , Jon McGee acknowledged . &quot; People who haven ' t gone_through it will probably think I ' m nuts and it shouldn ' t have bothered me as much as it did , &quot; he said . &quot; It was really hard to figure_out . I had just a terrible attitude about football . I got_to the point where I didn ' t want to go lift weights , I didn ' t want to work_out . I just had a bad outlook on everything . Everything was negative. &quot; Although he said at a news_conference two days after the shooting that he planned to remain at USC , McGee later asked Coach Larry Smith to release him from his scholarship so that he could transfer . &quot; I thought a change of scenery might help my attitude toward football , &quot; he said . He transferred to Oklahoma early in 1993 but realized during spring practice a_few months later that he still wasn ' t enjoying football . His coaches persuaded him to stay , however , and he played in four games last fall before quitting the team and leaving school . He enrolled at Arizona last spring , determined never to play again . &quot; I wasn ' t going_to play football or even think_about playing football , &quot; he said . A few months ago , however , he changed his mind . &quot; It was like all_the clouds parted and I decided I wanted to play again , &quot; he said . &quot; It was like a light switched_on or something. &quot; He made an appointment with Arizona Coach Dick Tomey , who invited him to practice . &quot; It ' s been going really good , &quot; McGee said . &quot; I ' ve been having a lot of fun with football now . I ' m just excited to get_back into it and get going . I ' ve got the desire back . I ' ve made about a 180-degree turn and I ' m positive about everything now. &quot; After playing so sparingly during the last three years -- he sat_out four games of his senior year in high_school because of an ankle injury and never got_into a game at USC -- McGee is a little rusty . But he is determined to make an impact next season on a defensive unit that has recently ranked among the best in the nation . &quot; I see signs of Jon McGee having the potential to be a good college football_player , but he ' s got quite a ways to go as far as his overall development , &quot; said Larry Mac Duff , Arizona ' s defensive coordinator and linebacker coach . &quot; He needs to improve his quickness and some of those things . &quot; He ' s working extremely hard . At one time , he was a guy who was very highly recruited and very highly publicized on a national basis as far as an outstanding prospect , and I think now what he wants to do is get_away from all that . He just wants to work hard and improve and make his own way in our program . &quot; I think he ' s taking steps toward doing that , but he ' s got a ways to go and he ' s going_to be in competition with some really good players here . So , time will tell. &quot; For McGee and his family , it has already been a long wait . But , apparently , their ordeal is over . &quot; I know how upset he was , and I know how he ' s doing now , and he ' s his old self , &quot; Mike McGee said of his son . &quot; In talking with the psychiatrists and psychologists , they say it ' s just a process your mind has to go_through to readjust and it usually takes a year and a half to two years . And they were right . He really is over it . &quot; He ' s missed a lot and he ' s got a lot of catching_up to do . But he ' s doing_well . And he ' s happy . that ' s what I care about , and that ' s what he cares about. &quot;</TEXT>
