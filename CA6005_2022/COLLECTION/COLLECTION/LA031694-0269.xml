   <TEXT> It comes as a bittersweet surprise to the dwindling percentage of Americans who hunt for sport : They have become , of all things , the unintended beneficiaries of the national debate over gun_control . This occurs at a time when hunters have organized as never before against the forces besieging them -- the animal protection movement , the federal and state budget-cutters and , quite often , the environmentalists . As a result , hunters stand more powerful , voice stronger resolve and command greater prestige in Washington than at any time in at least two decades . More_than 40 % of the lawmakers in the House and Senate belong_to the Congressional Sportsmen ' s Caucus . Started five years ago to safeguard the interests of sports hunters and anglers , the caucus is among the largest on Capitol_Hill . And didn ' t President Clinton go bird shooting with a caucus leader this winter to show his allegiance ? There are few in Congress who oppose all forms of hunting . And it ' s hard to find a Clinton_Administration official who doesn ' t see the need to woo hunters more energetically -- even as the government seeks to control the firearms of urban violence . But just what do the_hunters intend to do with their newfound political clout ? On issues coming_before Congress beginning this week , the Sportsmen ' s Caucus aims to have its say on everything from the trophy hunting of polar_bears to the &quot; multiple use &quot; of forests , wetlands and grazing_lands . The caucus wants changes in the Endangered Species and the Marine Mammals Protection acts . It is pushing a so-called &quot; hunter ' s bill of rights , &quot; and is determined to maintain hunting privileges in the California desert . But for all this bravado in Washington , these are days of foment for America ' s everyday hunters . By region , by generation and by gender , the nation is divided over hunting -- often deeply . The rifts widen because hunters ' typically conservative political leanings have separated them from their more liberal , erstwhile friends in the environmental movement -- despite the common desire for healthy wildlife habitat . And while many game species are thriving in America , the places to hunt them unfettered have not expanded . Some have shrunk or grown more controlled under the pressures of human population growth , suburban sprawl and public backlash over the recklessness of some hunters . The share of Americans who actively hunt is shrinking , too , leaving many feeling isolated . Finally , there is the growing might of the animal protectionists . When asked about the most important animal rights fight of the future , veteran activist Cleveland Amory responds : &quot; To get_rid_of this dreadful hunting. &quot; Hunters , it seems , began taking him dreadfully seriously a_few years ago . The Sportsmen ' s Caucus was established in 1989 , two years after the Brady Bill was introduced in Congress to require a waiting period for handgun purchases . True-blue hunters and anglers formed the core , but they enlisted colleagues not previously as concerned with sportsmen ' s issues . For at least some recruits , caucus membership was a way to demonstrate that gun_control could be unyoked from the interests of , as they say in Washington , &quot; legitimate sportsmen. &quot; For others , it represented recognition that hunters back home were becoming more politically active . So as the government undertook the first national firearms legislation in a generation , hunters found themselves wrapped in a reassuring political embrace . Members of Congress did not just have to oppose the National Rifle Assn. , they could also support the Sportsmen ' s Caucus . &quot; I guess you could say we ' re in better shape than we ' ve been in in a while , &quot; allowed Rep . Bill Brewster , a two-term Oklahoma Democrat who has created a niche for himself in Congress as a voice of hunters and co-chairman of the Sportsmen ' s Caucus . Currently , the caucus roster lists 185 House members and 35 senators . After Clinton signed the Brady Bill in December , the President joined Brewster for a morning of hunting on the Maryland shore . The take was a single duck ; the symbolism , though , was received by millions of people . Gun_control , the President said , &quot; doesn ' t have anything to do with hunting. &quot; The President ' s point_man on the hunting issue is Kenneth L . Smith , former governor ' s assistant in Arkansas and now deputy director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . The Administration , Smith said , does not aim merely to support hunters , but to recruit them and maintain their &quot; heritage. &quot; &quot; Let me say I believe it is important for the ( Fish and Wildlife ) service , state agencies and the hunting community as_a_whole to engage in outreach to promote hunting among the young and those who live_in urban_areas , &quot; Smith said . The new political energy of hunters extends way beyond Washington . In the last two years , sportsmen ' s caucuses have been organized in all 49 state legislatures , except Hawaii ' s . When asked to argue their case , hunters say something that may surprise some : They are the nation ' s original conservationists . Yes , there were unfortunate episodes in America ' s past where wanton hunting wiped_out the passenger_pigeon and drove the bison to near extinction . But pioneer conservationist-hunters like Teddy Roosevelt and Wilderness Society founder Aldo Leopold conceived a logic for a nation that had outgrown its frontiers : Managing game populations and habitat was in the_hunter ' s long-term interest . Since then , hunters have come_to pay_for -- and almost wholly shape -- the nation ' s wildlife management efforts . The private Safari Club notes with pride that in this century , white-tailed_deer have increased their numbers fiftyfold , elk eighteenfold , antelope two-hundredfold and wild turkeys have rebounded from a small few to 4 million . Perhaps it should be noted that predators who compete with humans for game -- notably the grizzly_bear , wolf and panther -- have not done as well . And neither have the_hunters . From 1955 to 1975 , about 10 % of Americans counted themselves as hunters , according to the Fish and Wildlife Service . There has been a steady drop-off since : 9.1 % in 1980 , 8.4 % in 1985 and 7.5 % in 1991 . Today , the number of hunting_licenses issued nationwide is about 15 million . In California , the number of licenses has decreased since 1972 , from 651 # 091 to 299 # 416 . And the future ? Among themselves , sportsmen and women are divided as perhaps never before , unsure about allies old and new . To the extent that the Sportsmen ' s Caucus represents hunters , the battle is less about Roosevelt-style land conservation and more about land use and budget allocations : The inviolable rights of private_property owners ; the multiple use of lands to include not only hunting but grazing and logging and mining ; a deep suspicion of government land regulation , and a nostalgic resistance to change . Thus , the League of Conservation Voters , an independent group that rates Congress on environmental votes , scores the members of the Sportsmen ' s Caucus poorly . In 1993 , the league said , the caucus contained only three environmental &quot; heroes , &quot; those who voted pro-environment 80 % of the time , and 84 environmental &quot; zeros. &quot; Overall , the caucus was ranked significantly lower than Congress as_a_whole . &quot; Typically , the caucus is terrible . They ' re the kind that put_on plaid shirts on Election_Day and pretend they ' re environmentalists , then go_back to Washington and vote against the environment the rest of the time , &quot; said Peter L . Kelley , the league ' s communications director . One of the most stinging charges against the caucus is that its leaders are elitists in the mold of the modern European sporting gentry -- they hunt in exotic locales and private preserves beyond the reach of all but a_few , and come_to represent less the interests of ordinary hunters than of the chummy clique of their outdoor pals in the development , ranching , mining , oil and chemical businesses . Financing for caucus activities , for everything from its hunting trips to its educational_programs and summer_camps for youths , comes largely from just these kinds of interests -- oil and timber companies , tobacco and cattlemen ' s associations . But there also is backing from ammunition and fishing_tackle manufacturers and publishers of sporting magazines , including Times Mirror Magazines , publisher of Outdoor Life and a subsidiary of the company that owns the Los Angeles Times . Members acknowledge their caucus is partly fraternal . But no more so , they insist , than other special-interest congressional caucuses . Brewster said that he is unfazed by the caucus ' low environmental ratings -- he scored 45 % on the League of Conservation Voters 1993 report . &quot; Some of these environmental groups are too heavily influenced by the animal rights types , &quot; Brewster said . But his own life may illustrate something more fundamental at_work . By occupation , Brewster is a rancher and a land owner . Hunting is his hobby . When a bill to raise grazing fees is proposed as a conservation step , or when wetlands reform threatens to restrict agricultural land use , Brewster finds himself solidly with the land use status_quo -- and in opposition to environmentalists . For 1994 , the Sportsmen ' s Caucus has seven specific goals beyond its general call to protect the interests of hunters and anglers . They are : * Passage of a bill to forbid protesters to interfere with hunting on federal lands . Such an amendment has passed the Senate and is pending in the House . * Amendment of pending legislation to create a national_park in the Mojave_Desert . The caucus wants hunting rights preserved . * Significant revision of the Endangered Species Act to benefit hunters and landowners . The caucus calls these &quot; common_sense amendments. &quot; Environmentalists say they are an all-out assault on this longstanding conservation_law . * Maintenance of agricultural subsidies that pay farmers to keep some land fallow . These lands have become important wildlife habitat . Clinton has proposed cutting the financing in half . * Prevention of budget raids on the license fees paid by hunters for wildlife management . Some in Congress would like to divert some of these funds or charge hunters extra for anti-crime programs . * Amendment of the pending reauthorization of the Marine Mammals Protection Act so that hunters can legally import polar_bear &quot; trophies. &quot; These bears are protected in the United States , but some hunting is allowed_in Canada and proposed in Siberia . * Defend the rearing and release of captive ducks at private shooting clubs . Some biologists fear these birds will spread disease and weaken natural flocks . The caucus leadership vows to oppose regulation unless these fears can be proved . A good number of hunters say that the caucus ' agenda does not represent the desires of all sportsmen and women . Call it the &quot; greening &quot; of the outdoor sporting community . Some hunters say this is an instance of Congress lagging behind the people . Here and there , evidence points to hunters loosening their rigid arm-lock with the gun lobby and reaching to their former allies in the conservation movement . &quot; We ' ve begun to include them more in things , &quot; said Kevin Sweeney , chief spokesman for Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt . &quot; It was a mistake not to involve them from the start in the initiatives we ' ve undertaken . . . . What we ' re trying to do here is provide more habitat . And if you ' re interesting in hunting and fishing , you should be our natural allies. &quot; Richard Parsons , government affairs counsel for the Safari Club -- which represents hunters with international concerns -- partly agrees : &quot; With environmentalists , our goals are and should be exactly the same . Wildlife that has a value to someone is more likely to be preserved than wildlife that doesn ' t . We support sustainable use. &quot; Those who read sportsmen ' s publications vouch for a new environmental tone these days . Some sport fishing magazines have become downright rabid in supporting the cause . Writing in Fly_Rod &amp; Reel , outdoor journalist Ted Williams disowned those land-use traditionalists who presume_to speak_for sportsmen in Congress . &quot; The congressional Sportsmen ' s Caucus is a front for politicians pushing the agenda of air and water polluters , clear cutters , oil and gas extractors , agribusiness habitat wreckers and wetlands developers , &quot; Williams wrote . If this bridging of the gap between hunters and environmentalists is indeed genuine , it will be bad news for the animal rights movement . A Los Angeles Times poll in December found 54 % of respondents opposed sport hunting . The strongest opposition came from women , young people , blacks and Westerners . Perhaps sentiment in Congress is so lopsided for the other side because hunting is regarded_as a culture and animal rights as a movement . Annette Lantos is a congressional volunteer and staff director of the Congressional Friends of Animals Caucus , chaired by her husband , Rep . Tom Lantos ( D-Burlingame ) . She said the caucus has a membership of 25 . Who are they ? &quot; Well , we don ' t disclose our members , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s not quite acceptable yet . we ' ll lose them. &quot; Even at that , the Friends of Animals Caucus says that it is not openly anti-hunting . &quot; We ' ve learned that you cannot legislate morality . Ours is an educational effort , &quot; Annette Lantos said . Wayne Pacelle , national director of the Fund for Animals , acknowledges being_on the defensive in Washington like never before . &quot; When historians sit_down to write , they will say that this marked the pinnacle of hunter strength in Congress , &quot; Pacelle said . &quot; But on Capitol_Hill , their power is really the product of the good old_boy network . The Sportsmen ' s Caucus may have 40 % membership in Congress , but its agenda couldn ' t claim 10 % support among the public. &quot; For now , animal protectionists continue to claim a strong alliance with mainstream environmental groups , and have taken their anti-hunting campaigns around Congress directly to voters . Their strategy is to confront , state by state , those types of hunting that arouse the most controversy . Two ballot initiatives have been successful : A 1990 California measure that outlawed hunting mountain_lions and a 1992 Colorado proposition outlawing baiting and dog hunting of bears . In elections this year , Pacelle ' s group and others are focusing_on bear and cougar hunting in Oregon and trapping in Arizona . Some activists are itching to target one state and try_for an all-out hunting ban . Maybe a more lasting battleground will be America ' s youth . Animal protectionists have campaigned hard , and by many indications successfully , for the attention of children . Hunting activists say they are fighting_back with youth camps , fishing derbies and shooting safety programs . &quot; This is a heritage that is passed down from one generation to another , &quot; Brewster said . &quot; Eventually , if there aren ' t young people to hunt , it will die out. &quot; Times researcher Doug Conner in Seattle contributed to this story .</TEXT>
