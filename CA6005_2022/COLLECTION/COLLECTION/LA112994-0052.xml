   <HEADLINE> THE ASIA BOOM ; ENVIRONMENT ; IS POLLUTION THE PRICE OF ASIA ' S DEVELOPMENT ? ; CHINA ' S RAPID GROWTH HAS MANY WORRIED , RECALLING THE EARLY DAYS OF JAPAN ' S ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From its hilltop perch overlooking the North China Plain , the Jietai Temple provides a stunning contrast between the ancient serenity of China and its modern industrial roar . The dark wood and gray brick Buddhist temple , built_in AD 622 during the Tang Dynasty , is a gracious retreat nestled in a pine and cypress grove 25 miles west of Beijing . But on the plain 1 # 200 feet below , veiled by a thick cloud of sallow smoke , the massive Capital Iron &amp; Steel Corp. , cradle-to-grave workplace for 200 # 000 employees , works night and day to meet this booming nation ' s demand . Steel_production has helped China maintain its phenomenal rate_of_growth , a 40 % expansion of the economy in just three years . But the sulfur_dioxide emissions from the plant ' s coal-fired blast_furnaces produce acid_rain and make Beijing one of the most polluted major capitals in the world . Just breathing the air for a day in Beijing , concluded one study , is the equivalent of smoking three packs of unfiltered cigarettes . According to a 1992 report by the World_Bank , the concentration of sulfur_dioxide is twice the recommended level ; unburned particulate matter more_than four times recommended amounts . The environmental problems in China are not limited to Beijing or the major cities . Several of the main tributaries of the Yellow River , the lifeline of the North China Plain , are so polluted with chemicals that they can no longer be used for irrigation . Acid_rain blackens crops throughout China and is such a danger that the Japanese and South_Korean governments are increasingly concerned that it may reach their shores . On a recent trip to a remote mountain area of southwest Sichuan province , Chinese photographer Gao Bo , back in China after five years in France , noticed a stunning transformation . &quot; Land that was once virgin_forest was denuded , &quot; said Gao . &quot; The land looked wounded . Not only were there no trees , there was nothing green. &quot; Until recently , China has been slow to react to these warning signs . In general , people have been too busy enjoying the fruits of a booming economy to consider the environmental consequences . &quot; I think the basic problem with China is that people have totally misplaced expectations , &quot; commented Vaclav Smil , an environmental scientist at the University of Manitoba who has emerged as the Cassandra of the China boom . &quot; They have this idea that they can become whatever they want . They are totally drunk with this 13 % annual economic_growth rate , and we in the West feed them . What they cannot see is that the growth is totally unsustainable. &quot; Recently , however , senior Chinese officials appear to have heard the alarms raised by foreign environmentalists . At a Beijing conference , Xie Zhenhua , administrator of the Chinese Environmental Protection Agency , said the main threat to the Chinese environment was &quot; irrational economic development that sacrifices the environment for advancement. &quot; Assessing the environmental price of Asia ' s phenomenal development has become a front-burner issue as economic_growth has soared . First there was Japan , rising like a phoenix from the ashes of World_War_II . Then it was the turn of the four little dragons -- Hong Kong , Singapore , Taiwan and South_Korea -- each one a small industrial powerhouse . Thailand , Malaysia and Indonesia came next , bringing double-digit growth to Southeast_Asia . Finally , the great sleeping behemoth in the region , China , shook_off ideology and isolation to join the rapid-growth club . But every step_forward seemed to have the potential of triggering two steps backward . How much does Malaysia ' s emergence , for example , cost in the destruction of some of the world ' s few remaining tropical_rain_forests ? Is Taipei ' s impossible traffic and foul air justified by Taiwan ' s phenomenal growth ? As much as the world admires economic success stories , a handful of environmentalists and scholars have begun to ask tough questions about the price along the Pacific Rim . &quot; I believe that environmental constraints will soon affect China ' s economic_growth , &quot; said Michel Oksenberg , president of the East-West Center in Honolulu . &quot; They have already begun to affect quality of life. &quot; Others contend that it is not too late for China and the other emerging Pacific Rim nations to learn from Japan , which began its industrialization without a glance at the environmental price . Indeed , Japan provides an impressive model of blind growth giving_way to ecological awareness . From the days of the Meiji Restoration , which began in 1868 , a national goal of &quot; catching_up_with the West &quot; was so fixed in Japanese minds that high_school anthems were composed in praise of smokestacks . Even the names of cities in Japan became associated with pollution . The mention of Kawasaki and Yokkaichi conjured_up images of smog -- and asthma and bronchitis . Water_pollution spread virtually everywhere -- in rivers , lakes and even the treasured Inland Sea . When the Bullet Line train opened between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964 , the year of the Tokyo Olympics , it was heralded as a triumphant symbol of progress . A few years later , it became a focus of complaints about noise . Minamata , in Kumamoto prefecture on Kyushu island , gave its name to what is still called &quot; Minamata-byo &quot; ( Minamata illness ) , or mercury_poisoning . It stands unrivaled as a pollution disaster in Japan . The Chisso Corp. , a chemical manufacturing firm , was found to have dumped about 27 tons of organic mercury compounds into Minamata Bay between 1932 and 1968 , which started causing deformities and deaths as early as 1956 . The mercury attacks the central_nervous_system . Cats that ate the fish in the bay were the first victims noticed ; then came the humans . The turning point came_in 1967 -- a year before Japan surpassed the GNP of West Germany . A Marxist economist , Ryokichi Minobe , was elected governor of Tokyo running_on a pledge to return &quot; blue_skies &quot; to the nation ' s capital . From that time on , the ruling Liberal Democratic Party began stressing environmental measures . By the mid-1970s it had enacted automobile emissions standards even stricter than those in California . Although &quot; environment &quot; today is a fashionable political topic , Japan still is no environmental paradise . The government established its Environment Agency in 1971 but has left it largely toothless . As an agency , it lacks the prestige of a ministry and enjoys few independent powers . Nevertheless , government ministries have worked_out with the business and industrial firms they are supposed to promote -- and control -- standards that have reduced pollution measurably . No one any longer is counting the days of the year on which Mt . Fuji can be seen from Tokyo -- a statistic that in the 1970s was a major indicator of pollution . Now , its economy secure , Japan has reached the level of Western industrialized nations in environmental awareness . Some environmentalists , however , doubt the relevance of the Japan model to China because of China ' s size and population . &quot; Japan is in an altogether different category , &quot; said Smil . &quot; You can ' t compare an island of 127 million people with a country of 1.2 billion people . Japan has been able to clean_up by exporting some of its dirty industries and importing its energy . Japan closed_down its coal_industry . China can ' t do that. &quot; By conservative estimates , China has enough coal in the ground to last 250 years . In order for the Chinese economy to reach Japan ' s level , it will have to consume five times as much primary energy . &quot; There is not enough oil in the world to supply them , &quot; said Smil . China hopes to double its generation of electric_power by the year 2000 . More_than 80 % of this power will be generated by coal . For Smil , this formula foreshadows environmental devastation for the entire East Asian region as acid_rain spreads beyond China . Oksenberg , the East-West Center president , is more sanguine . For one thing , he notes a heightened interest in Japan and South_Korea about environmental concerns in China . Recent developmental aid programs from both countries have directed money to Chinese environmental programs . Japan ' s Asahi newspaper recently reported that Mitsubishi Corp. , the huge and powerful trading company , has agreed to provide $ 25 million as part of a fund to build a 550-mile pipeline from Jingbian in China ' s Shaanxi province to bring natural_gas east to Beijing as part of a plan to replace the use of coal . Finally , as the first glow of the economic blaze begins to fade , Chinese officials have shown increasing concern about the environmental cost of growth . The government has committed itself to spending $ 9.5 billion for environmental protection before the end of 1995 and another $ 23 billion by the year 2000 . In April , Wang Binggian , vice_president of the National People ' s Congress , said polluters should face the death_penalty . &quot; Violators should be punished as severely as smugglers and drug_traffickers , &quot; added Song Jian , director of the legislature ' s environmental committee . Times staff writer Sam Jameson in Tokyo contributed to this article .</TEXT>
