   <HEADLINE> THE ASIA BOOM ; PUBLIC WORKS ; ASIANS POWER UP THE PRIVATE SECTOR ; BILLIONS ARE NEEDED TO BUILD ROADS , BRIDGES , AIRPORTS AND UTILITIES -- FAR MORE THAN GOVERNMENTS CAN FINANCE ON THEIR OWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just two years ago , the Philippines suffered crippling electrical brownouts almost daily . Workers sweltered in offices without air conditioning , shops had gasoline generators throbbing on the sidewalks outside , and factories were forced to curtail production because of the shortage of power . &quot; We were really hurting , &quot; recalled Guido Delgado , head of the state-owned National Power Co . &quot; Not only did we need power fast , we needed to get_in place huge amounts of generating capacity. &quot; Faced with a desperate situation -- no new power_plants had been built for six years -- the Philippines turned_to a relatively new concept from the United States : independent , private power_companies . A nearly bankrupt government with a disastrous credit rating approached foreign companies and offered them carte_blanche if they could get the Philippines powered again . Now , thanks to the crash program , brownouts are largely an unpleasant memory . More_than $ 1 billion has been spent in the power sector since 1992 , and electricity supplies have surged 18 % in the past year . Long regarded_as one of the most backward countries in Asia , the Philippines has blazed a trail of privatized infrastructure projects that is being followed by governments from New Delhi to Beijing . The reasons are obvious : Asia is in the midst of a boom of historic proportions . According to estimates by the Asian Development Bank , Asian_countries , not including Japan , will have to spend $ 1.3 trillion in the coming decade on power , roads and other infrastructure just to keep_up with their burgeoning economies . And Japan will spend $ 6.3 trillion on a host of public works projects of its own . The Asian skyline is filled with construction cranes , from dams in India to magnetically levitated trains in Japan . The building of Hong Kong ' s new airport and its access_roads and bridges , with a total cost of $ 20 billion , is one of the most expensive construction projects ever contemplated . &quot; Infrastructure development is indispensable in a country ' s overall economic development , &quot; said Cordell Hull , chairman of Bechtel Enterprises Inc. , a giant California construction firm . &quot; If it lags , there will be bottlenecks , inefficiencies and delayed or impeded economic development. &quot; In China , for example , after more_than a decade with yearly 10 % growth , infrastructure needs are huge . The average time between trains is only about eight minutes , an indication that the tracks are dangerously overcrowded . Most ports are working_at full capacity , and electrical brownouts are common . Chinese officials estimate that the country will need 17 # 000 megawatts of new power production every year until the end of the decade . By comparison , the largest electric utility in North_America , Ontario Hydro , has 34 # 000 megawatts . &quot; China ' s infrastructure hasn ' t kept_up with economic_growth , &quot; said Gerald L . Murdock , president of Hong Kong-based Asia Power Group Inc. &quot; The country ' s power-generating capacity was inadequate to start with . The miles of China ' s railroads are the same now as at the time of the civil_war in 1947. &quot; Even a country as backward as Vietnam , which has virtually no modern industry to speak_of , is forecasting that it will have to spend $ 500 million a year to meet its electricity needs . Economists have found a direct link between investment in infrastructure and a country ' s wealth . A World_Bank study concluded that , for every 1 % increase in a country ' s economic_growth , power supplies increased by 1.5 % , telecommunications by 1.7 % and paved roads by 0.8 % . Since Asia ' s economic_growth has averaged 8 % for the past decade , all_the infrastructure needs have risen accordingly . As recently as a decade ago , most governments in Asia relied_on public borrowing to finance their infrastructure projects and operated them as state-owned monopolies . But Asian governments found they do not have the cash to meet the huge financing costs expected in the next decade , and they have had to tap the private sector . Besides , private companies tend to do the job faster and more efficiently . &quot; The capital requirements are beyond the reach of most governments , &quot; said Vladimir Bohun , who heads the power division of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank . &quot; We estimate that the region needs $ 500 billion over the next decade for the power sector alone. &quot; As in the Philippines , many of the developing private projects are &quot; build-operate-transfer &quot; enterprises . A private company is given a government contract to build an electric_power plant , for example , operates the plant for 20 years at an agreed price for electrical_power , then turns it over to the government at no charge . The country gets the electricity with little investment of public money , while the company reaps the benefit of high returns on investment . So far , privatized infrastructure projects have been used mainly for power_plants . But the concept was also employed to build highways in Malaysia , Thailand and China , as well as telephone_systems and ports . One piece of good news for the United States in all this construction is that U.S. companies are well-positioned to profit . In Bangkok , for example , a joint_venture between Nynex Inc. , one of the Baby Bells , and a Thai conglomerate has been signed_up to install 2 million telephone_lines using equipment provided by AT &amp; T . In the past year , the company ' s investment has tripled in value to $ 1.2 billion . Donald M . Kusza , the head of General Electric ' s power_systems division in the Southeast_Asia region , said the company has signed_up $ 1.6 billion in new business so far this year , compared to $ 900 million for all_of last year . Asia accounts_for a 35 % share of the company ' s business , almost the same as the U.S. market . &quot; The growth now is in the Asian market , &quot; Kusza said . &quot; The opportunity for growth out here is great . U.S. products are_well received , we have_the_best technology , and the Japanese up_to now have not been aggressive players. &quot; While companies such_as General Electric and Bechtel have been participants in the Asian infrastructure market for decades , the recent push toward privatization has seen some relatively new players . One of the biggest is Mission Energy Co. , a subsidiary of Southern California Edison . Mission recently took a 32.5 % share of a joint_venture with General Electric and Mitsui Co . of Japan , building a vast coal-fired power complex in Indonesia . Enron Corp. , a Houston-based oil and gas conglomerate , set_up two power_plants in the Philippines and was the first foreign company to get the go-ahead for a private power_plant in India . For those who arrived as pioneers in the market , returns on their investment has been handsome . Companies setting_up power_stations in the Philippines two years ago are realizing up_to 25 % returns on equity , while India has guaranteed a minimum profit of 16 % a year . &quot; You can ' t repossess a power_station or a highway if the deal goes_bad , so these companies have to be compensated for their risks , &quot; said one international banker . &quot; If I could , I ' d put all my money in one of these power projects . They are paying an unbelievable return. &quot; In addition to new companies arriving to help shape what is being hailed as the &quot; Pacific Century , &quot; Western firms are also looking_to the region to help finance the huge new projects . A recent arrival is the Asian Infrastructure Fund , which was created by international investor George Soros and Peregrine Securities , a Hong Kong firm , to invest directly in infrastructure projects . Will Lilley , the fund ' s managing director , said the fund has so far raised about $ 530 million out of an expected $ 1.6 billion . &quot; Huge sums_of_money are at stake in Asia , &quot; Lilley said . &quot; The state sectors have basically failed , and they need private capital money to meet their people ' s needs for power , water , telephones and roads . There could be a worldwide shortage of capital. &quot; Another source of money is the domestic market in Asian_countries , which have witnessed the growth of a relatively large middle_class in the past decade . OSK &amp; Partners , a stockbroker in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , estimates that , of the $ 14.7 billion earmarked for infrastructure projects in the next five years , $ 3 billion will be provided by domestic investors . Richard McIndoe , a banker with the_British merchant_bank S.G. Warburg , noted in an interview that big Western banks are proving hesitant to get involved in the rush to finance infrastructure projects . Banks tend to have shorter horizons than the 25 years required by such deals . They also are worried that , if a developer finances a project in China in dollars , the Beijing government might later devalue the currency . As a result , only a handful of banks have become involved . The Asian infrastructure industry suffered through a nightmare of sorts in Thailand last year when a Japanese company finished construction of a toll road through the center of Bangkok . The Thai government waited until the project was completed to announce that the proposed toll was too high , and it seized control of the road . Eventually , a buyout was arranged , but the incident has made investors throughout the region jittery . &quot; High rewards mean high risks , and the latter exist in abundance in Asia , &quot; said Robert C . Broadfoot , managing director of Political &amp; Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd. , a Hong Kong firm that measures risks for its corporate clients . &quot; While we believe that more money will be made in infrastructure in Asia in the coming decade than perhaps anywhere else in the world , we also fear that more money will be lost. &quot; Projected Asian Infrastructure Spending 1994-2000 Asian_countries , not including Japan , are poised to spend about $ 1 trillion in the next few years on transportation , power and other infrastructure projects . China is expected to claim the lion ' s share . * The Projects ( % ) Transportation : 35 Power : 35 Telecommunications : 15 Utilities : 10 Other : 5 * The Nations ( % ) China : 34 India : 23 Indonesia : 9 South_Korea : 9 Thailand , Malaysia , Taiwan : 15 Other : 10 SOURCE : Political &amp; Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd . in Hong Kong</TEXT>
