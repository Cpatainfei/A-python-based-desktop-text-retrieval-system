   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 / DAILY REPORT ; CANADA HOLDS BRAZIL TO DRAW , 1-1 , ON RESERVE ' S GOAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Canada produced one of its finest soccer results Sunday , tying World Cup favorite Brazil , 1-1 , on a goal by substitute Eddy Berdusco in the 70th minute of a World Cup tuneup game . Berdusco , who entered in the 62nd minute , sent the crowd of 51 # 930 at Edmonton into a frenzy when he hammered a shot high into the left corner over goalie Claudio Taffarel . The goal came_after Romario scored in the 45th minute . The Brazilian star took a pass at the top of the penalty_box , snaked his way through three defenders before drilling a low , hard shot to the left corner behind goalie Craig Forrest . The game was one of five exhibitions Canada is playing against World Cup-bound teams . Brazil , a three-time champion , will open World Cup play June 20 against Russia at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto . Canada failed to qualify . * Herman Gaviria and Freddy Rincon scored in the second_half on setups off free_kicks as Colombia defeated Greece , 2-0 , in a World Cup tuneup for both teams at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford , N.J. Not only was the exhibition a tuneup for the teams , it was the first test of the stadium ' s new grass field , which was installed over an artificial surface in May . And from all indications , the field held_up well . The ball appeared to bounce smoothly , the footing was good and the grass did not come_up as players were tackled , a major concern with seven World Cup games scheduled here in June and July . Colombia , which will be playing in its third_World Cup and second in a row , dominated the game before a crowd of 73 # 511 , most of whom wore yellow and rooted for the South_American team . * Striker Tomas Brolin struck twice within six minutes early in the second_half as Sweden beat Norway , 2-0 , to win the three-nation Nordic Cup soccer tournament . It was the last exhibition before the World Cup_finals for Norway , which will play Mexico in its opening game in Washington on June 19 . Sweden will face Romania in its final tuneup in San Diego on June 12 before taking_on Cameroon in the World Cup opener seven days later at the Rose Bowl . The Swedes , who lost their first Nordic Cup match , 1-0 , to European champion Denmark , struggled in the first_half against a Norwegian defense that conceded only one goal in four previous exhibitions . * Ireland , a surprise winner over the_Netherlands and Germany on_the_road , was a 3-1 victim of non-qualifier Czech Republic in Dublin . Pavel Kuka scored twice and Jan Suchoparek scored a third goal as the Czechs found holes in the_Irish defense . Andy Townsend scored for Ireland . * Ecuador ' s Ivo Ron scored twice to beat World Cup-bound South_Korea , 2-1 , at Wakefield , Mass .</TEXT>
