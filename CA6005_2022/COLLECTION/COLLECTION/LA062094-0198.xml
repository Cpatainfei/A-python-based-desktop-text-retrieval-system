   <HEADLINE> SEASON OF HOPE ; A LOOK_AT THE FUTURE THROUGH LA QUINTA ' S STUDENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sea_gulls gather like storm_clouds in the sky above La Quinta High_School ' s quad , circling and shrieking in anticipation of lunchtime leftovers . You could set your watch by their arrival here 7 1 / 2 miles from the ocean , on a tidy little campus where surfers and brains and jocks gather and mostly get_along . Snoop Doggy Dogg ' s rap ends . With the bell , a_thousand students scatter toward combo lockers , classrooms , their future . So_much is different in high_school -- this school -- from 17 years ago when I was a student . Starting a freshman with braces and class vice_president and ending_up a homecoming queen nominee and class ditcher , I was as twisted up as any teen-ager over all_the usual romantic and academic crises and terminal boredom . Nobody worried then about a classmate in civics drawing down on them from a backpack . Nobody worried about AIDS or tuberculosis . We didn ' t have a shooting in the parking_lot . We did have a drunk driver who fatally plowed into the parking_lot ' s fence . We had more smoking and drugs . In the mid-1970s , the student population was vastly white , with only 79 of 2 # 000 kids of Asian or Pacific Island descent -- and they were primarily Japanese American kids whose families farmed strawberries one could still buy from the fields . Last year , filmmaker Oliver Stone ' s company conducted open casting calls_out of the La Quinta cafeteria for his Vietnam movie , &quot; Heaven and Earth. &quot; It ' s a very different place , La Quinta . Family income levels have dropped . Only five students got free lunches when I attended ; today 40 % of the campus population does . Test scores have gone_up . Enrollment has declined ; so have electives such_as metal shop . Students now complain that they can ' t enroll in more classes in a day . Changing values and cultures are shifting much of what was high_school tradition . Fewer than 40 class rings sold this year . Nobody wants to work_on the yearbook anymore . For all_the concern over teen sex , couple-dating sometimes seems as outdated as Ken and Barbie . In some ways it might be a hint of what ' s in_store for Southern California . Although the image lingers of bedrock white Orange County , 17 years ago it was even more so : 86 % of the people living here were white . Today , the 2.4 million population -- dramatically affected by an infusion of immigrants and a changing economy -- includes 23 % Latinos and 10 % Asian and Pacific Islanders . In the high_schools alone , the numbers rise to 35 % and 13 % . Hoping to take a snapshot of ordinary teen-age life in this rapidly changing world , we spent most of the school_year at La Quinta High_School . Maybe , we thought , we might also catch_a_glimpse of_our_own future . Here at La Quinta , where 27 languages are spoken , where dark hair and distant relatives are the norm , the so-called minority is the majority , and diversity and multiculturalism are not talked to death but lived_out every day . &quot; It ' s about time Americans realize we are part of the whole world , &quot; world history teacher Rita Corpin remarked one day outside her classroom . &quot; Kids at La Quinta get that every day. &quot; * We start with fall , that season of beginnings and possibilities on a campus where students are more likely to feel hopeful about their future , and about themselves . Their dreams for big romances and small waists haven ' t yet faded like summer tans . By October , it seems , the big news off campus is La Quinta ' s TB scare . After it becomes public that a 16-year-old student is still contagious with the disease , screenings are expanded to the entire campus . Headlines go_on and on about the scare . Teachers and administrators fret that the bad news will discourage parents once open enrollment commenced . School officials monitor the situation and hold meetings to arm teachers with facts and assuage fears . For La Quinta students , it is one big yawn . At weekly appointments , students who had tested positive for TB trudge from class to Nurse Sheryl Reyes ' office , where they line_up for their mandatory medication and then return to their desks . In Barbara Henry ' s art_class one day , a girl is called to the nurse ' s office to a_few chants of &quot; TB , TB. &quot; But everyone , including the girl , laughs . There is not much obsessing about TB and , like AIDS , maybe it is just teen-age denial . But the kids talk more about the news coverage of TB -- they think it ' s sensationalized -- than about who has it on campus . * Marching band member Amber McCammack , all school spirit and freckle-faced innocence , was a mother by her junior year . One day after &quot; narc watch , &quot; which involves her standing guard outside the girls bathroom while her friends smoke inside , she welcomes me to campus and wonders why I ' m here . She agrees to meet later for a chat . What is it like now to get_through high_school ? , I ask . Over a banana_split after school that day , she licks chocolate off her spoon and talks_about things so private and painful it is hard not to wince . Amber , 17 , freely dissects why she thinks she had herself a baby . As she does this she is such a collision of girl and woman , cynical wit and crushing vulnerabilities . Her father died when she was 3 ; her mother then married a man Amber did not like . She thinks she clings_to her boyfriend for the male protection she was denied . Her grades suffered after her 16th birthday , when she learned she was pregnant . Her family was , of course , not pleased , she says . She says she never considered abortion . She felt oddly admired by other girls for seeing the pregnancy through . &quot; They told me , ' I could never . I would just get_rid_of it. ' They felt the disappointment of their parents would be worse than anything else that could happen to them. &quot; She jokes that the one class she has done especially well at -- besides band , of course -- has been Life_Sciences , specifically the chapter on reproduction . * The excitement of homecoming is in the air -- or is it just a free period for a gym assembly where everyone gets_to yell and show school spirit and sport the Aztec blue and gold ? The script for this ritual brings alumni back to the big football game and a frilly-dressed queen to be crowned at half-time . In looking_at the football game program , I realize that the four princesses were born the year before I graduated . Ouch ! Princess Aileen Rose has a 2.0 GPA and these plans : &quot; Go_to a two-year college , then to a four-year . Get_married and have three kids ( one girl , two boys ) . Go bungee-jumping. &quot; Princess Mina Nguyen has a 4.1 GPA and four favorite teachers . Her plans ? &quot; Harvard and major in law , international relations and political science. &quot; That old chestnut , football , has taken_a_hit on this campus with the changing student population . Asian-born kids generally don ' t have the size and years of practice in Pop Warner that past graduates had , coaches say , and their parents largely resist any activity that might detract from schoolwork . Success , the coaches say , can no longer be strictly defined by winning . &quot; We ' re better because of it , &quot; Jim Perry , athletic director and basketball_coach , says one day after school in the gym , where expandable bleachers are tucked beneath the gray Aztec Empire painted on a wall . In his striped warm-up suit the coach saunters along the sidelines as young boys run_up and down the court . This is the start of Perry ' s 13th year as a teacher and coach , and he has changed as radically and surely as have his teams . Coaches get as personally involved with their students ' future as anyone on campus . They cajole students to stay out of trouble ; they needle them about schoolwork ; they nag them to kick butt for the greater good of their team ; they referee family battles , they size_up a kid ' s commitment and character and vest his future if deemed . Perry has attended weddings and birthday_parties and other milestones of his long grown-up charges . He is that kind of guy . At some point_after foreign students became a sizable presence in the school ' s sports programs , Perry took a year off &quot; to regroup and rethink &quot; -- to decide whether he could go_on coaching . His conflicts reflect much of how other teachers and students have adapted to their changing world . He visited campuses where friends of his coached , places such_as Alhambra High_School , where there is &quot; a huge Chinese population going_through the same thing &quot; in athletics . Same thing in Wichita , Kan . He helped a friend teach basketball at a Mexican clinic where they had not much more_than a hoop in the village common . He rediscovered what it was like to share the pure love of a game and , he says , &quot; the true meaning of teaching : the commitment to the value of kids doing the best they can , &quot; no matter how many jump_shots they missed . &quot; It really changed me personally , &quot; he says as the players wander toward the locker_room , &quot; and I think we do a better job now. &quot; Being as close as he is to a lot of the students and former students who return as assistant coaches , Perry watches the nuance of student relationships . &quot; There have been racial tensions over the years , &quot; Perry says , &quot; but they tend to be between Hispanics and Asians rather than with whites , because the whites are such a minority here . It ' s over stuff like culture , language , ' why do you think I ' m different ? ' , stuff like that. &quot; More subtle social problems play_out on campus as well , Perry and other teachers say , things like how females are viewed in their culture versus their standing in America . The backgrounds of many of the kids born in Vietnam are sometimes stunning , he says , when you think_about what they bring_to school with them mentally . &quot; These kids have had members of their families involved in guerrilla activities ; they ' ve been floating in the South_China_Sea on a rickety boat for three to five weeks ; they ' ve seen people dumped overboard , they ' ve watched pirates kill people. &quot; Perry shakes his head . It ' s a different kind of lost youth than gang bloodshed , but it is nonetheless innocence lost to violence . * It ' s 9 a.m. Monday , and Rita Corpin ' s world history honors class is under way . &quot; We ' re just starting the Middle_Ages , &quot; she says , as a video on what it ' s like to live_in a castle plays . No big surprise here . Some kids are yawning with their heads down in the dark . Corpin is unfazed . She ' s been teaching here three decades . The class is an interesting microcosm on some days . One of the things Corpin tells her students is that she is impressed that they know more_than one language . But shortly after she noticed groups of students speaking languages other_than English in class , she saw a problem emerging . If she felt left_out and excluded , how must other students feel ? &quot; I require everyone to speak English in class , because that puts_down walls , and I tell them , ' We need to speak a universal language so we can all communicate and understand each other. ' &quot; Some days Corpin has her students group off by color of their clothes , or by first letter of their name . One day , she had her students line_up by country of birth . America was a small group -- six out of about 30 . &quot; The rest were born in Pakistan , Iran , Vietnam , Romania , all around the world. &quot; Corpin let her own observation sink_in . &quot; There may be riots and problems in L.A. , but it ' s working here , the melting_pot . And it ' s not a class thing either. &quot; World history in Corpin ' s class is delivered with a cultural point_of_view -- not just a drone of dates and names but the music , foods , religions , values , social_welfare system , art and literature , men ' s and women ' s roles and economics . &quot; We ' ve got the United Nations on this campus , and I think its great , &quot; Corpin says with pride . But do the kids ? &quot; that ' s a good question . I think there ' s a lot more understanding . At first I felt there were walls . One thing I have noticed : There has been some white flight , but the students here now -- by and large get_along very well , because we see that there ' s understanding and respect. &quot; &quot; You have to remember , students are young and open-minded . Students are very open_to change , and very positive . When students break_into study groups , you don ' t see big breaches between races . &quot; Now guys and girls in the same group , that ' s an even rougher mix , &quot; she says with a laugh . * Flames are devouring entire neighborhoods in Laguna Beach and Malibu and Sierra Madre , monopolizing television_news for days . There is not a peep about a drive-by in La Quinta ' s senior parking_lot Oct . 27 , except a_few graphs in the back of the local news pages . According to Principal Mitch Thomas , a student booted_out of La Quinta a year ago and a male friend pulled into the senior parking_lot after school that day , and one of them jumped_out . He pointed the barrel of a . 25-millimeter automatic toward the campus and sprayed five or six shots , apparently at random . There were not many students around , although volleyball team members , lined_up for a group photo , would later say they heard pops but did not immediately realize bullets were flying nearby . Fortunately , nobody was hit , and somebody recognized the guys in the car that peeled out onto McFadden Avenue . Arrests are made and a motive suspected -- girlfriend-boyfriend hassles -- but never established . It is a tough blow at a school that prides itself on security and the principal ' s zero tolerance for even fistfights among students . During job interviews Thomas conducted , he drilled campus supervisors such_as Dominic Palumbo , a towering Texan , and Pat Faulkner , a solid , no-nonsense mother of five , with questions like : How fast can you run the 100-yard dash ? How fast can you scale a 10-foot fence ? &quot; One of the things I looked_for by asking that was a sense_of_humor , &quot; Thomas says . &quot; It ' s essential . Pat ' s response was great . She says , ' It depends_on what ' s on the other side. ' You need to know does this ( campus worker ) have a sense_of_humor ? . . . Because if they are hard-nosed with those kids all_the time , they ' re not going_to make it. &quot; The levity and vigilant attention to problems seem to be working . Unlike my years here , the entire perimeter of the campus is gated , and the three open entrances are under routine watch by the walkie-talkie-toting paid supervisors and three administrators . Visitors must be checked_in by staff and given special sticker badges . Both parking_lots are closely watched . The October shooting episode scares the heck out of her , supervisor Faulkner admits , but it is an exception . Mostly the challenge is the day-in , day-out mouthing off or rebellion that she tangles_with . &quot; They test you , &quot; she says , smiling and shaking her head . &quot; But what else is new about kids ? I got my own . I should know. &quot; * The continual complaints of campus budget_cuts are an evergreen among faculty , parents and students . Today ' s spokesman for the issue is school newspaper_editor Chris Dutton . &quot; So_much has been cut , &quot; says Chris , 17 , a blond senior staffing the lunchtime bake-sale table to benefit La Quinta ' s Students Against Drunk Driving chapter . He also co-captains the mock trial team , edits the Aztec Sun and works_on the yearbook . &quot; The school newspaper has been cut_back to five editions ( a year ) ; Drama 2 , 3 and 4 is one class , and there ' s no play , &quot; says Chris , who works part-time at JCPenney ' s credit department . Sounding amusingly like an older_person always seeing the past better than the present , Chris says students during his underclass years had far more spirit . He is very ambitious and ready to move_on to college -- a university in New Zealand where he will study political_science and broadcast journalism . He sometimes seems older than some of his classmates , maybe because he has self-awareness that comes from some painful self-examination . Childhood friends of his were messed_up pretty bad on drugs , and Chris had to think hard about his own furtive drinking . In his sophomore year he was scared that it was out of control , so he went clean and sober . Hence his leadership role in SADD . Though he is only an average student because he often takes_on too_much and then doesn ' t finish everything , teachers sense Chris will succeed . But in any school of 1 # 300 kids -- any community of 1 # 300 people -- not all will be able to fix their problems -- or rise above them . And La Quinta is no different . Nancy Wride , Times Staff Writer Wride attended La Quinta High_School from fall 1973 to spring 1977 and in those years worked as a reporter for the Aztec Sun . She covered the big stories of the day , from President Gerald Ford ' s campaign stop at Mile Square Park to prom expenses . She joined the staff of the Los Angeles Times in 1979 while a student at Cal State Fullerton and has won numerous awards , including the state publishers ' s award for feature writing . Gail Fisher , Times Staff Photographer Fisher graduated from Garfield High_School in Akron , Ohio , in 1972 and earned her BA from Miami University of Ohio . She taught high_school woodworking and photography , then left to earn a master ' s in photograhpy at Ohio University . In 1980 , she joined the San Bernardino Sun and three years later moved to the Times . She has won many awards and was twice named photographer of the year .
