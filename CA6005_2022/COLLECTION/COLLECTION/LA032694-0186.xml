   <TEXT> Singapore Airlines is prepared to buy_up to 52 wide-body jetliners worth $ 6 billion from Boeing Co . and Airbus Industrie , an airline spokeswoman said Friday , in what would be another welcome boost for Southern California ' s beleaguered aircraft industry . The carrier ' s order would particularly benefit Northrop Corp. , which builds the fuselages for Boeing ' s 747 jumbo jet in Hawthorne , and several dozen other 747 suppliers in the region . Singapore Airlines , whose 63-plane fleet is already dominated by 44 747s , has invited proposals from manufacturers to supply additional 747s , along with A340s built by Airbus , the European aircraft consortium , airline spokeswoman Agnes Huff said in Los Angeles . The A340 entered service a year ago , and Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways and Air Canada are among the carriers that have ordered the plane . Huff said Singapore Airlines hopes to formally place its order within the next few months . A third major manufacturer , McDonnell Douglas Corp. ' s Douglas Aircraft unit in Long_Beach , is also welcome to submit a proposal to Singapore , Huff said . But she said Boeing and Airbus were invited because those are the two makes of jets the airline flies . The airline ' s expected order follows the February announcement of a $ 6-billion order planned by Saudi_Arabia ' s national carrier , Saudia . Boeing and Douglas are negotiating with the Saudis about sharing that order .</TEXT>
