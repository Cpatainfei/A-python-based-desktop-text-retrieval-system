   <HEADLINE> CLINTON ATTACKS RELIGIOUS RIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * I shook my head in disgust as I read of President Clinton ' s recent verbal attack on Rush Limbaugh and other conservative talk_show hosts ( June 25 ) . Invoking the memory of those who sacrificed their lives on D-day , he stated , &quot; These people did not die so the American people could indulge themselves in the luxury of cynicism. &quot; That comment is indicative_of his Administration ' s utter disdain for our basic freedoms . He obviously does not realize that is exactly why they died . JAMES P . SANTAGATA Mission Viejo * Thank God that President Clinton moved from the restrictions of presidential imagery to become human and hit back at the sacred-cow privileges of the Rush Limbaugh evangelists of American talk radio . Clinton correctly pointed_out that the constant cacophony of right-wing vilification is more_than an anti-Administration media circus . It saturates America with a negativism that fuels an already dangerous national sense of hopelessness . The spectacle of an arrogant Limbaugh strutting across our TV screens peddling his political propaganda is a bad-taste hangover from Reaganistic reaction . But this is 1994 . It ' s time to go_ahead and vomit over the nauseating chorus of evangelistic blasphemy preached from their protected perches by self-appointed political propagandists for the Deity . TED COX Palm Springs * Democrats are alienating Christians . Recent statements from Don Sweitzer , the party ' s national political director , and Rep . Vic Fazio ( D-West Sacramento ) demonstrate an insidious attack against Christians who actively disagree_with their ideology ( June 26 ) . Whenever politicians make personal attacks instead of debating the differences_of_opinion regarding issues , it is an indication they are in_trouble . Unable to convince voters their philosophy is correct , they resort_to a personal smear campaign . Democrats would like voters to believe the Republican_Party is being taken_over by &quot; the radical right &quot; with a scary agenda . An interpretation of that , and certainly closer to the truth , is that Christians are concerned with the direction of America and are getting politically involved to make changes that include less government , lower taxes , better schools and reduced crime . I guess it ' s the less government and lower taxes part that has the Democrats worried . JOHN O ' NEIL Newport Beach * So &quot; Billy Boy &quot; is now blaming Jerry Falwell and Limbaugh for his problems instead of taking a good look in the mirror . Falwell and Limbaugh tell the truth . Clinton should try it ! L . M . LEWIS Costa Mesa * The Republicans have been vigorously criticizing Democrats for being intolerant_of religion . But at the Iowa Republican Caucus , Sen . Arlen Specter attracted the one round of catcalls when he affirmed his support for the &quot; basic_principle of separation of church and state &quot; ( June 26 ) . Noted ! EMIL LAWTON Sherman Oaks * While I agree with Edwin Yoder about Falwell and the religious right ( &quot; The Religious Right , Doing the Wrong Thing , &quot; Commentary , June 28 ) , I disagree_with his statement that Christianity &quot; is about right and wrong. &quot; In fact , the persistence of this erroneous_belief is one of the prime reasons the religious right exists . Christianity is about a loving God who became human , led an exemplary life , showed love and mercy to the least deserving , and then died willingly to demonstrate God ' s power over death . If only Falwell would spend more time preaching the Gospel instead of spreading his pseudo-Christian-conservative agenda , he might find a society more willing to embrace his values . However , the Christian Gospel involves a higher level of moral ambiguity and uncertainty than Falwell and the religious right can countenance . LAWRENCE TONSICK Pasadena * Yoder refers to the conflict developing between President Clinton and Falwell , the two Baptist boys . Yoder says that the Baptist God must be confused over two Baptists fighting with each other . He then refers to the President as &quot; a good Southern Baptist boy who goes_to church regularly , Bible in_hand , knows and loves all_the old hymns and is_well acquainted with Holy Writ. &quot; Let me say that Yoder may be confused but God is not confused and neither is he mocked . God has X-ray vision . He can see right through humankind . Just because somebody goes_to church and loves the hymns , does not necessarily mean he or she is a Christian . Anybody can put_up a successful front . After all , evangelists Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart did . JOHN Y . BHATTI Los Angeles</TEXT>
