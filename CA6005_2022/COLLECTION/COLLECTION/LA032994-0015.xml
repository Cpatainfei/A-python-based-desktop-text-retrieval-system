   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / ALEXANDER COCKBURN : BRINGING MALTHUS UP TO DATE ; TODAY ' S INTELLECTUAL OVERLORDS ECHO THE 19TH-CENTURY ECONOMIST ON MAKING THE WRETCHED MORE SO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The problem with the row over Louis Farrakhan and the deplorable views of his aide is that it focuses attention on the wrong target . American Jews aren ' t in any danger from the Nation of Islam . In fact , as a group liable to persecution , they aren ' t in any danger at all . The whole uproar is fraudulent , rearing a vast mountain out of a tiny molehill ; just another way of hyping Israeli bond drives . But there are potential mass murderers in our midst . They don ' t wear swastika armbands . Many of them are policy-makers , opinion-formers and respected members of the polity . Liberal foundations -- particularly environmentally oriented ones -- are top-heavy with them . They are Malthusians . In the town of Chico the other day , a woman who said she was head of the Population Committee of the Sierra Club in California asked why I was so hard on Malthus . Why was I discounting the menace of overpopulation ? Thomas Robert Malthus was an English economist of the early capitalist era . Read him and it will save you a subscription to the Wall_Street Journal , Progressive Policy Review , the New Republic and almost every_other journal of neoliberal opinion . Malthus believed that the overbreeding poor would inevitably outstrip the means of subsistence . Attempts to alleviate poverty and misery only make things worse ; the misery of the lower classes is the consequence of a natural_law that functions &quot; absolutely independent of all human regulation. &quot; Malthus felt quite differently about the more privileged sectors . Whereas the lower classes overbreed , the upper_classes regulate their numbers , fearing that excessive reproduction will damage their station . As a political economist , Malthus had to reconcile his theories of population with the problem of effective demand . Who were the consumers necessary to keep the system turning_over ? Malthus loathed the poor and rejected the idea of increased purchasing power among the laboring classes , arguing that under a system of private_property , &quot; the only effectual demand for produce must come from the owners of property , &quot; and that these affluent underbreeders would spare the otherwise inevitable visitation of misery on_their_own sector of mankind and secure &quot; to a portion of society the leisure necessary for the progress of the arts and sciences , &quot; thus conferring on society &quot; a most significant benefit. &quot; For Malthus , the poor -- excepting workers necessary for production -- are dispensable and should not be assisted in any way . Consumption -- the exercise of effective demand -- is mostly the purview of the wealthy . Travel from Malthus to another English thinker , Cambridge philosopher and historian Ernest Gellner , whose speech on &quot; Nationalism and the New World Order , &quot; offered at a 1993 conference on &quot; Emerging Norms of Justified Intervention , &quot; appeared in the February bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . Gellner advances the foggy proposition that human society has been dominated by three types of motivation : honor , interest and salvation . Concerning us here is salvation , which Gellner defines as the idea of perfecting an industrial economy through the establishment of righteousness on Earth -- in other words , the just society . According to this eminent thinker , salvationism has conclusively failed . All that remains for the human project is the establishment of a world government &quot; to combat ecological threats and those posed by terrorism &quot; and the formation of &quot; a kind of International of Consumerist Unbelievers. &quot; In sum , a world police_force plus Malthus ' gentry , attending_to the all-important work of circulating commodities . This adequately represents the thought of today ' s intellectual overlords . In Malthus ' era , the answer to the problem of the poor was definitively given when the_British did nothing to alleviate the starving to death of about 1 million Irish peasants in the mid-1840s . The welfare reformers of today have essentially the same perspective , for no &quot; reform &quot; is possible within the terms of capitalism , so there won ' t be any , aside from endeavoring to make life worse for the wretched . For openers : linking welfare to sterility . The answer to Malthus and to Gellner is despised &quot; salvationism &quot; -- meaning that a society has to care_for all its people , the &quot; surplus poor &quot; as well as the elites . Desperate people produce more babies than secure ones . Meanwhile , give me the single teen-age mom every time , making her rebellious , entirely rational choice .</TEXT>
