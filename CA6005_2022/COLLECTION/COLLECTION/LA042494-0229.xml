   <TEXT> Spike Lee ' s father , Bill , stands at the oven on the first_floor of his brownstone in Fort Greene , cooking a noontime breakfast for his young son Arnold , shooing_away some of their 19 cats , and talking_about his family -- about everyone except Spike Lee . He talks_about his great-great-great-grandfather Mike , the defiant son of an African king , and his great-great-great-grandmother Phoebe , who was taken from her mother in Africa when she was 9 . He talks_about his grandfather William James Edwards , descendant of Mike and Phoebe , an educator who went_to school with Booker T . Washington ; &quot; I went_to school with Martin_Luther_King , &quot; he adds . Then he talks_about his father and mother , his sisters and brothers , all -- like himself -- trained musicians . Finally , Bill talks_about the children of his first marriage , who each also started_out playing music -- David , piano ; Joy , bass ; Cinque , drums ; Chris , trumpet , and Spike , cello . &quot; David got interested in photography , &quot; he begins , &quot; Joy got interested in acting ; she ' s also a dancer and a singer . Cinque got interested in writing ; he ' s also an actor . Chris became interested in art ; he ' s still an artist , but he hasn ' t pursued it. &quot; He pointedly leaves_out his oldest son , Spike . He says , when asked , that he has no idea what Spike ' s new movie is about , even though it is a movie he in a real sense spawned ; even though he scored his son ' s first four films . &quot; I don ' t have anything to do with Spike now , &quot; he says of troubles between the two , which included the elder Lee ' s arrest for heroin possession in 1991 and subsequent request to his son for a loan -- which was refused -- in early 1992 . &quot; We haven ' t talked for two years. &quot; &quot; Crooklyn , &quot; Spike Lee ' s seventh film , which opens May 13 , focuses_on a family with a daughter and four sons growing_up in a Brooklyn brownstone in the 1970s . The father is a jazz_musician , the mother a schoolteacher , their car , a Citroen station_wagon . The Lee family arrived in Brooklyn from the South when the eldest , Shelton Jackson -- Spike -- was a toddler . The Lees , who drove a Citroen station_wagon , soon numbered_one daughter and four sons , who did much of their growing up in the 1970s . Father Bill Lee plays jazz bass . Mother Jacquelyn Shelton taught art . &quot; Some things are based on our family , &quot; Cinque Lee , 27 , the youngest of the four sons , concedes . &quot; Very , very , very loosely based , &quot; says Spike Lee , 37 . Faced with the same question , their brother David , 33 , simply falls silent . Their sister , who now calls herself Joie , 31 , says as little as possible . The four of them are spending the summer of ' 93 making their movie together in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section , outside an elegant brownstone on Arlington Place -- a block chosen to be the set for the film because of its Brooklyn neighborly feel , a brownstone chosen because of its resemblance to the one , some three subway stops away , where the Lee children all grew_up , where Bill Lee still_lives . &quot; Crooklyn &quot; is a family picture , in many ways . &quot; I gave_birth to this project ; Spike delivered it , &quot; says Joie . Joie , the only girl in the family , wrote the screenplay , which tells the story through the eyes of the only girl , Troy . Her co-writer ( in addition to Spike , who joined the process later ) was her brother Cinque , who is also her partner in a company they named Child Hoods . &quot; We wrote the script for ourselves , &quot; Cinque says . &quot; Then we showed Spike and he said , ' Hey , I ' ll do it. ' We were surprised ; we didn ' t think he ' d be interested. &quot; But he was . &quot; After ' Malcolm X , ' he wanted a rest , &quot; Cinque says . &quot; I ' m sure he wanted to do something light , that didn ' t ruffle any feathers. &quot; &quot; My little_brother doesn ' t know what he ' s talking_about , &quot; Spike replies , clearly still willing to ruffle feathers , at least in his own nest . &quot; It would ' ve killed me to do a film like ' Malcolm X ' right afterward , &quot; Spike Lee was saying . &quot; So the script of ' Crooklyn , ' you know , really fit . Because of the scale. &quot; Indeed , most everything about &quot; Crooklyn &quot; is_on a scale less than half that of &quot; Malcolm X. &quot; &quot; X &quot; cost about $ 35 million for an 80-day shoot ; &quot; Crooklyn &quot; was budgeted_for $ 15 million and was shot in 52 days last summer . &quot; Malcolm X , &quot; which was filmed here , in Africa and in the Middle_East , took about two years to make , swept_through 40 years in the life of a historic figure , and employed 200 actors with speaking parts , more_than 400 crew_members and tens of thousands of extras . &quot; Crooklyn , &quot; which stars Alfre Woodard and Delroy Lindo as the parents , covers about six months in the life of a family and their neighbors on one block in Brooklyn , with time_out for a trip to Maryland ( filmed in New Jersey ) . Spike and his producers say that &quot; Crooklyn &quot; is not really a departure ; it is a return to the scale of all_the films he made before &quot; Malcolm X. &quot; But the scale is not all that is different . &quot; Crooklyn &quot; is &quot; neither angry nor confrontational . . . nobody will feel alienated in this one , &quot; Spike himself said in March , 1993 -- despite his belittling of his brother Cinque for saying much the same thing on the set . The Brooklyn of &quot; Crooklyn , &quot; though filmed in the same neighborhood , is far from the literally explosive terrain of 1989 ' s &quot; Do the Right Thing. &quot; Lee gained notoriety in that movie for the character he played who throws a garbage_can through the window of Sal ' s Famous Pizzeria , sparking a riot in which the business burns to the ground . There were several fiery scenes in &quot; Malcolm X &quot; as well . For &quot; Crooklyn , &quot; the Lees filmed another scene of smoke and screams and chaos , of a father gathering_up his hysterical children . This time , though , it was an oven exploding in the kitchen . The scene , which did not make_it into the film ' s final version , was a true event in the Lee family history . David , a photographer who has been working for his oldest brother &quot; since I was 11 , &quot; recalled the real-life incident vividly . &quot; My eyebrows were singed off , &quot; he said , then noticed his listener ' s attention on his brow . &quot; I ' m wearing prosthetic eyebrows , &quot; he added , arching them . Spike does not remember the incident quite as distinctly , but he admits , &quot; ' Crooklyn ' is the Brooklyn of my youth &quot; -- a 1970 of dancing to &quot; Soul Train &quot; and singing along with &quot; The Partridge Family , &quot; of miniskirts and platform shoes , of Curtis Mayfield and the Jackson Five , all shown in the nostalgic tints of a 1970 Ebony . &quot; I ' m not going_to say that this was the age of innocence . But you know . . . the worst thing you had when I was growing_up was the glue sniffers. &quot; Unlike many films featuring African Americans , Lee said , &quot; ' Crooklyn ' is not about a dysfunctional family , where the mom is a crack-head. &quot; But the film does feature some lowlifes , including one named Snuffy ( played by Spike ) , who sniff glue . Criticized for leaving_out the drugs from the world of &quot; Do the Right Thing , &quot; Lee put drugs in both &quot; Jungle Fever &quot; and &quot; Malcolm X , &quot; though he left them out of 1990 ' s &quot; Mo ' Better Blues , &quot; a film about a jazz_musician -- the last of Spike ' s films scored by his father , and the one in which Bill Lee appears in a cameo at the end . A year after that film ' s release , Bill Lee was arrested in a Brooklyn park police sweep on suspicion of possession of heroin . ( The case was eventually dismissed. ) Spike won ' t talk_about his father , but Cinque credits Bill Lee with inspiring &quot; Crooklyn. &quot; &quot; When we were growing_up , our father had a name for everybody on the block , &quot; Cinque recalls , sitting on a stoop in Arlington Place . &quot; ' Conk , ' because his hair was conked . ' Slide , ' because he wore slippers , and he would always slide when he walked . &quot; We still live_in the same neighborhood -- that ' s a Brooklyn thing -- and we hear about the neighbors : ' Slide got a new dog. ' &quot; It was from that , Cinque says , that &quot; Crooklyn &quot; was born . He and Joie decided to create some 35 characters , mostly from their old block . &quot; It ' s hard to remember which were real characters and which were fictional. &quot; As he speaks , some studious children play Scrabble nearby ; a 5-year-old adds an &quot; s &quot; to &quot; exam. &quot; Not far away , Eulalie Richards talks_about the history of the block , how in 1947 when she moved_in &quot; there were still five white people on the block. &quot; Now she is 93 , and the block is_full of large families , many from Barbados . &quot; Everybody here ' s very tight. &quot; Two young_men are strutting down the street , oblivious of the rain-making machines , the sky-high lighting , the huge trailers , the fat coils of wire crowding the street . &quot; You have five apples and 12 people , &quot; one young_man says to the other . &quot; How do you give each person an equal share ? &quot; &quot; You cut it. &quot; &quot; No , you can ' t cut it. &quot; They turn the next corner , as he supplies the solution : &quot; You make applesauce. &quot; These are scenes from the neighborhood , not the film , part of the normal swirl of a Brooklyn block . Only the Scrabble players are actors in &quot; Crooklyn , &quot; waiting for their summons to the camera . Cinque looks very much at_home . &quot; We wrote it as a television series for children , &quot; he says . But Nickelodeon screened a pilot for the series , had it tested with a group of inner-city kids , and gave it thumbs down . &quot; It had no hip-hop music , no dancing . It had jazz. &quot; Not wanting to waste the characters , Joie and Cinque put many of them in a film script . As they wrote -- faxing pages back and forth , even though they live two blocks from each other -- they narrowed their focus further and further , first on a neighborhood , then on one block , then on one family , finally on one character ( the girl , Troy ) . The resulting film , Cinque said , is &quot; 95 % &quot; from their imagination , although they had a hard_time persuading even the crew of that . &quot; In one scene , a dog gets caught in a sofa_bed and dies , &quot; Cinque says . &quot; And people kept_on coming up and saying &quot; -- he mimics shock and outrage -- &quot; ' Did you really kill that dog ? ' It ' s a fictional movie ! &quot; But there are scenes that even his siblings admit are based on their childhood . In one , while a camera crowds a small bedroom on the second floor covered with basketball posters , Alfre Woodard talks to a young actor named Carlton Williams , who plays the oldest_boy . &quot; Clinton , you ' re the eldest and I expect more from you , &quot; she says while Clinton sits on his bed , pouting . &quot; I ' m going_to let you make your own decision. &quot; &quot; Why did Daddy have to have his concert tonight ? &quot; Clinton says . &quot; The same exact night of the seventh game of the NBA championship . The Knicks and the Lakers -- and I got tickets. &quot; &quot; You ' ll make the right decision , &quot; his mother says . &quot; Which is more important ? Your father or the Knicks ? &quot; Cut . &quot; I definitely remember that , &quot; Spike Lee says later . &quot; That was the seventh game of the NBA championship in 1970 ; that ' s the game that Willis Reed dragged his leg on the court and the Knicks beat the Lakers . I got one ticket for the game , I got_it through my father ' s lawyer . . . who lives_down the block , who went_to school with John Havlicek. &quot; Lee tells the story with great detail and animation , which brings_to mind a line he used to tell interviewers : &quot; When I was a kid , I wanted to be a basketball_player , but I stopped growing. &quot; There are no such details about his father ' s concert , making_it clear which choice he made . Does he regret it ? &quot; It was unfortunate my father had to schedule a concert . . . but I mean , there would be other concerts ; it was only going_to be this one championship game . But it . . . I think it hurt ( my father ) . I think it hurt very much . Shoot , when my sister did ( the musical ) ' Mule Bone ' on Broadway , their opening_night was a night the Chicago Bulls were in town . You know where I was at. &quot; If , as Spike Lee likes to say , &quot; it ' s a scientific fact that a child ' s character is formed by about 5 , 6 years old , &quot; what kind of child would he cast to play himself ? &quot; Someone real quiet , &quot; he answers . &quot; You know , very observant , but real quiet. &quot; And difficult ? Stubborn ? &quot; I think that I ' ve been stubborn at times , but I think that any artist has to be stubborn. &quot; If at age 37 Spike Lee continues playing the rebellious child -- the arrogant older brother , the stubborn son -- he seems to have taken_on some new roles as well . You could even say that he is a family_man now , having married Washington lawyer Tanya Lynette Lewis in October . He is also , metaphorically at least , a father . &quot; Crooklyn &quot; marks the first time he actually has had to discipline his lead actors , most of whom are children . Few are professional ( professional child actors &quot; stink . . . they ' re not natural , &quot; the director says ) , many recruited from local schools throughout the boroughs . During the shoot , &quot; a lot of time was spent playing parent : ' Shut up , sit_down , why you doin ' that ? Stop it ! Why you hittin ' ? ' Stuff like that. &quot; Lee has also played father in a way as a filmmaker , mentor to members of a younger generation who see him as the grand old trailblazer , even though his first professional film , &quot; She ' s Gotta Have It , &quot; debuted a mere eight years ago . But in that time black directors have come_into their own , including John Singleton , the Hudlin brothers , Mario Van Peebles and Ernest Dickerson ( &quot; Juice &quot; ) , Lee ' s cinematographer since film school ; &quot; Crooklyn &quot; is the first movie Lee has made without him . Some have called this a renaissance in black filmmaking . Lee ' s reaction : &quot; The door ' s cracked ; it ' s not wide open. &quot; He takes his mentor role seriously , proud_of the careers his films have launched , including those of Wesley Snipes , Rosie Perez , Martin Lawrence and John Turturro . He has also taught film at Harvard , and offers every spring term a kind of film institute at Long_Island University , open_to anybody . &quot; I ' ve always been about the demystification of film , &quot; he explains . &quot; I think that ' s what keeps people -- in particular minorities and women -- from entering the film_industry . This whole hocus-pocus aura they try to put around filmmaking , the Hollywood magic , that ' s just to make_it seem inaccessible to people. &quot; Lee has become a serious businessman as well , not only with his own film company , but with three Spike ' s Joint stores selling promotional jackets , caps , T-shirts and books ; a music company ; a management company for athletes ; a soon-to-open advertising_agency that will be a joint_venture with BBDO Worldwide . He ' s even become a Brooklyn landlord . All this authority , some people have reasoned , must be making Spike Lee more mellow ; they use as evidence his relatively restrained reaction when &quot; Malcolm X &quot; failed to get Oscar nominations for anything but best actor and best costume_designer , and won neither . &quot; I ' ve said more_than my share about the Academy Awards , &quot; he says now , in his Fort Greene office , a converted firehouse decorated with huge posters of his films . &quot; People know how I feel . So why should I keep wasting energy about it ? &quot; But then he launches into it once again , winding_up with his review of the relative merits of 1989 winner &quot; Driving Miss Daisy &quot; and 1989 reject &quot; Do the Right Thing. &quot; Why does he think so many of his films cause such a ruckus ? &quot; It ' s part of the agenda that I stir_up controversy , &quot; he says . &quot; At least I try to make thought-provoking films. &quot; As for his own work , he looks_forward to making &quot; musicals , romantic films , all kinds of films. &quot; Including thrillers : His next film is &quot; Clockers , &quot; based on the gritty Richard Price novel about cops and drug dealers in New Jersey . The executive producer is Spike ' s idol Martin Scorsese . In each new film he expects the cast and crew to form a kind of family . &quot; Some films are good family . Some films are bad families . But you definitely have family . Family does happen. &quot; Family and music seem to be the central themes of Bill Lee ' s life , yet he has stopped talking_about a particular member of his family . &quot; I can ' t dwell_on that , &quot; he says . &quot; He ' s not even our son anymore , &quot; says Lee ' s son ( and Spike ' s half-brother ) Arnold . &quot; I ' ve never been a Spike Lee fan , &quot; says Susan Kaplan-Lee , Bill ' s wife , wearing a &quot; Do the Right Thing &quot; jacket . The conflict began when Susan started living with Bill shortly after Jacquelyn died in 1976 -- when &quot; my mother wasn ' t even cold in her grave , &quot; Spike has put it . It grew during production of Spike ' s &quot; Jungle Fever , &quot; about an interracial relationship : &quot; that ' s directly talking_about me and my wife , &quot; Bill says , with some heat . Then early in 1992 , Bill has said , he asked his son for a_few thousand dollars to help pay his household bills ; Spike turned him down , &quot; and his attitude was very insulting. &quot; ( &quot; Why should I dignify comments my father said , &quot; Spike Lee replies , &quot; or play it out_in a public forum ? &quot; ) The loan request came not long after Bill ' s drug bust ; did drug use contribute to the split ? Bill Lee says no . &quot; I ' m glad I was arrested . It woke me up . . . . Dope was not part of my life until I was 40 years old , &quot; adds Lee , now 65 , which means he started getting involved with heroin when his children were young , around the time his wife was dying of cancer . But all this , he says , is insignificant . &quot; People remember you by the work that you do. &quot; And Bill Lee , like his oldest son , has often used his life experiences as a source for his seven folk jazz operas . One of them , &quot; Little Johnny , &quot; is about the purchase of the Lee family home_in Fort Greene that is the setting of &quot; Crooklyn. &quot; &quot; It has old people and kids and a story , &quot; he says vaguely . It doesn ' t have conflict . &quot; In all these operas , I never think_about no conflict. &quot;</TEXT>
