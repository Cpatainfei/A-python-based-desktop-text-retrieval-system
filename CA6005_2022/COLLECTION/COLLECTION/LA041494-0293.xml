   <HEADLINE> JUST OFF THE CUFF , O ' LAUGHLIN NOT READY TO PLAY ; COLLEGE FOOTBALL : COMING OFF SHOULDER SURGERY , CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE QUARTERBACK WATCHES THE START OF SPRING PRACTICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cal State Northridge opened spring football drills Wednesday with starting quarterback J.J. O ' Laughlin watching from the same vantage_point he occupied at the close of last season -- the sideline . O ' Laughlin , who was knocked_out of an Oct . 30 game against Chico State , is rehabilitating from reconstructive surgery on his right shoulder_in December . He has been stretching and lifting weights , but is not cleared to throw a football until Monday . &quot; It ' s coming_along well , about as_good_as could be expected , &quot; O ' Laughlin said . &quot; There was some major damage. &quot; O ' Laughlin ' s injury was diagnosed as a complete tear of the rotator_cuff , plus ligament and cartilage damage . He has a scar which stretches from under his throwing arm to the top of his shoulder . &quot; It ' s a six-month process and I ' m going_on four , &quot; O ' Laughlin said . &quot; I ' m a little bit ahead of schedule , but I want to be smart about it. &quot; He will watch for the rest of this week , then try to resist the temptation to cut loose any long passes . &quot; I ' ll be tossing it for a while , &quot; O ' Laughlin said . &quot; I don ' t want to jeopardize my recovery by trying to throw a bomb or something . I ' m just going_to take it day by day. &quot; O ' Laughlin , a 6-foot-3 , 200-pound transfer from Illinois , completed 99 of 214 passes for 1 # 181 yards and nine touchdowns with five interceptions before his injury . * Coach Bob Burt welcomed 52 players for drills , but not before he asked many of them if they voted_in student elections . On the ballot was a referendum that would increase student fees to go_to athletics . &quot; I told them , ' If you don ' t go vote , we might be out here practicing for nothing , ' &quot; Burt said . Athletic Director Bob Hiegert is_on record saying the Northridge football program is in jeopardy should the referendum fail . * The Matadors thought they needed a punter because Albert Razo , a four-year starter , has completed his eligibility . No problem . The man Razo took_over for has resurfaced . Darren McMahon last punted for Northridge in 1989 , when he walked on to the team after hearing that Razo was ineligible . McMahon performed adequately , but Northridge coaches informed him that Razo would be their punter as soon as he regained eligibility . So McMahon , a former Granada Hills standout , left the team quietly . Now he ' s back , taking_advantage of a 10-semester rule used to determine the eligibility of Division II athletes . Because Northridge was competing in Division II when McMahon started his college career , he is governed by that standard , rather than the Division I requirement that an athlete complete his eligibility in five years . Under Division II rules , an athlete has eligibility for 10 semesters -- which do not have to be consecutive -- as a full-time student . &quot; Once I knew he was eligible , recruiting a punter was not a factor , &quot; Burt said . &quot; Darren punted well for us . He wasn ' t Razo , but very few guys are. &quot; * Northridge will conclude spring drills with an intrasquad scrimmage on May 6 .</TEXT>
