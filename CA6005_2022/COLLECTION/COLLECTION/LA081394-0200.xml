   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CONFLICTING APPROACHES TO ENDING BALKANS WAR FORGE ODD ALLIANCES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a case of strange bedfellows , the United States and Serbia are now both at_work trying to bring peace to the Balkans by eliminating the Bosnian Serbs ' huge military advantage over their victims . In an even stranger collaboration , Britain and the United Nations seem to be trying to save the rebels from that fate . Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has already cut_off fuel and weaponry to his former allies , and President Clinton vowed Thursday to push to exempt the Muslim-led Bosnian government from a U.N. arms embargo if the Bosnian Serbs have not accepted a peace plan by Oct . 15 . The theory , say Western diplomats , is that if the Bosnian Serbs can no longer fight with the confidence of a heavy_weapons advantage and a reliable supply of ammunition , they will be vulnerable to government counterattacks and presumably more willing to give_up some captured land in return for peace . But just as international efforts to force the Bosnian Serbs to comply appeared in sync , the U.N. Protection Force headquartered in this Croatian capital has weighed in to ease rebel fears of a comeuppance . British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , commander of U.N. troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina , has warned the Sarajevo government that it might face punitive air strikes if it takes_advantage of the Bosnian Serbs ' isolation by trying to recover territory seized by the rebels over the past 28 months . The civilian bureaucracy of the U.N. mission is also acting to ease Bosnian Serb concerns that the international community is taking sides . Mission spokesman Michael Williams said any move to lift the arms embargo would compel a withdrawal of U.N. forces , which would unleash &quot; disastrous &quot; consequences for civilians in Bosnia . With no protective cordon of peacekeepers between Bosnian Serb heavy_weapons and poorly defended enclaves such_as Gorazde , Srebrenica and Zepa , the rebels could unleash a fierce artillery assault against the last Muslims in eastern Bosnia . &quot; Given that lifting of the arms embargo would be designed to help one party and be aimed at another party , that would make_it quite difficult for ( the U.N. force ) to remain in Bosnia , &quot; Williams said , adding that contingency plans for a pullout were being speeded_up in the wake of Clinton ' s appeal . The issue of a pullout has exposed yet another rift within the international community over Bosnia , this time between the military peacekeepers on the ground and the diplomatic peacemakers at_work on a settlement . &quot; Every time the international community , via the ( U.N. ) Security_Council or NATO , is finally on the verge of pressuring the Bosnian Serbs hard , ( the U.N. force ) comes_up with something to balance things out , &quot; a senior Western diplomat observed . Bosnian government leaders welcomed Clinton ' s call to arm them , even if the peacekeepers leave as a result . But Muslim civilians , especially those in the Serbian-encircled eastern enclaves , probably fear they would be overrun by the rebels before weapons could reach them . Rose has repeatedly insisted the 20 # 000 U.N. troops deployed in Bosnia would be targets of angry Bosnian Serb retaliation if the arms embargo is lifted . Sources within the U.N. hierarchy and the diplomatic community say Rose places a higher priority on getting British forces_out of the dangerous peacekeeping mission than he does on securing a settlement of the conflict . Forcing through a peace plan also appears a secondary goal at U.N. headquarters , where Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has likewise observed publicly that the Balkans mission may have to be scrapped for security reasons , no matter what the outcome of the negotiations . The peace plan drafted by the United States , Russia , Britain , France and Germany would divide Bosnia roughly in half , giving 49 % to the Bosnian Serb insurgents who now occupy more_than 70 % , and the slightly larger part to a federation of Croats , Muslims and Bosnian Serb proponents of integration . Federation officials have accepted the plan as the most the outside world is willing to ensure them , while rebels loyal to Bosnian Serb nationalist Radovan Karadzic have steadfastly refused to give_up any territory in exchange for peace . Karadzic ' s spurning of the peace plan has angered Milosevic , whose own country and Montenegro , the junior partner in the rump Yugoslavia , are staggering under the stiff economic sanctions imposed for instigating the Bosnian conflict . In an effort to get sanctions relief , Milosevic has joined the effort to force Karadzic to agree to make_peace . When the peace proposal was being drafted , Western officials raised the prospect of North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization bombings if either side rejected their formula for division . But Russia is reluctant to target traditional Slav allies , and Britain and France fear any use of force against the Serbs will expose their peacekeepers to retaliation . The U.N. force &quot; suffers from the Stockholm syndrome , &quot; the senior Western diplomat commented , referring to the psychological phenomenon of hostages who grow to sympathize_with their captors . &quot; They are surrounded by the Serbs . They know the Serbs could kill them . So who do they side with ? The Sarajevo government that is in the same boat ? No . They side with the Serbs because they don ' t want to upset the side that would kill them. &quot; Diplomats from troop-contributing countries acknowledge the dilemma but excuse its consequences for the peace plan as the price for protecting the lives of their soldiers . &quot; It ' s not the fault of ( the U.N. force ) that the world cannot make_peace in the Balkans , &quot; said an envoy from one country with troops in Bosnia . &quot; They have been sent into the middle of a raging war and told to keep still until the outside world decides what to do about it . They are a human shield against the spread of the conflict , and an ineffectual one at that. &quot; BOSNIA HERZ</TEXT>
