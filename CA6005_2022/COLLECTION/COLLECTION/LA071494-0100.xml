   <HEADLINE> SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY ; MISSION TO THE MOON ; THEY SHOT THE MOON , AND MADE IT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Around the clock , workers in white smocks scrambled to assemble the world ' s most advanced technology in Rockwell International ' s Building 290 . Newsmen , scientists and astronauts visited , seemingly watching their every move . The floor of the hangar-like facility was littered with half-built spacecraft . In the 1960s , during the days of the Apollo space missions , this building in Downey was known as Tepee Village , nicknamed for the capsule-like shapes of the command and service modules that were readied there for shipment to Cape Canaveral . It was here , 25 years ago , that a work_force assembled a spacecraft that took men to the heavens and returned them safely home to Earth . The mission enlisted workers from all_over the Southland : In Redondo Beach , they designed and built the engines that landed men on the moon . In Seal Beach , they erected part of the rocket that blasted those three astronauts into space . In El Segundo , they created the docking ports that linked spacecraft modules together during a celestial rendezvous . The Apollo_program , which let men walk , drive and hit golf_balls on the moon , is over . But for many of those who worked_at area aerospace firms to design and build much of the equipment to get there , the mission is the highlight of their careers , even if they were far from the spotlight . Many have retired . Others were laid_off not long after the moon landing . Some are now top_executives or have started their own companies . But most agree that nothing was quite like working_on the lunar landings . &quot; The objective was very clear : Man . Moon . 1970 , &quot; said former Apollo astronaut David Scott , 62 , who walked on the moon in 1971 and now lives_in Manhattan Beach . &quot; Everyone understood exactly what the objective was. &quot; Many thought that , by now , NASA would be embarking_on a manned exploration of Mars or building a lunar base . But even a scaled-back space_station has had trouble getting funding from Congress . Today , Building 290 in Downey , where the lunar_modules were assembled , is silent . Offices are darkened and shuttered , with little activity except for space shuttle upgrade work . The Apollo_program &quot; built to a crescendo , then kind of died_away , &quot; said Westchester resident John Gibb , 75 , who headed the development of the propulsion_system in the spacecraft . &quot; They had the climax , and then it was all_over . It doesn ' t seem to amount to much anymore. &quot; And many of the spacecraft engineers who worked_on Apollo have gone_on to other work -- or are out_of_work . &quot; I see them in my classes , &quot; said Shirley Thomas , a USC professor who has helped aerospace_engineers retrain as environmental engineers . &quot; Bright men , a third of them with Ph.Ds , are just bleeding . They ' ve sold the first car , they ' ve sold the second car , they ' ve sold the home , and they can ' t find work. &quot; Many former workers , plus retirees such_as Palos Verdes Estates resident Rocco A . Petrone , 68 , long for the days when space exploration was a national goal . &quot; After 25 years , I ' m still enthused , &quot; said Petrone , then-director of launch operations at Kennedy Space Center and later the president of Rockwell ' s space division . &quot; I wish the nation was. &quot; Those on the Apollo projects often worked more_than 60 hours a week , getting little sleep . Many saw their families break_apart , and some developed health_problems because of the demanding work . Even on July 20 , 1969 , when Neil Armstrong took that first_step on the moon , employees at Rockwell continued working , peering at black-and-white TV_sets during breaks . Some thrived on the pace . &quot; They were really unbelievable times , &quot; said Beverly Gresham , a Rockwell secretary in customer relations who has been with the company since 1958 . &quot; ( If ) you talk to the people who are retiring , they will say it was the most fun they have ever had. &quot; In those days , billions of dollars poured into the space_programs . And for young engineers with brand-new degrees , it meant opportunities . Robert Sackheim was still taking college courses when he went_to work for TRW Inc. , which was designing the engine that lowered Armstrong ' s lunar_module from the hovering spacecraft to the moon . As a development engineer , he split his time between the headquarters in Redondo Beach and a testing facility in San Juan Capistrano . He remembers all-nighters , with some people taking catnaps in their chairs . &quot; It was a lot of just grinding_out the details , &quot; said Sackheim , now the manager of TRW ' s Propulsion and Combustion Center . &quot; We were doing a lot of mundane details . But , overall , it was a real technical challenge , not a minor feat . The lunar_module had to land safely , and that was very important. &quot; * Even when the work was not thrilling , former workers say , working_on the program was . At Cosmodyne in Torrance , workers had previously perfected cryogenic systems , which were put to the test in cooling lunar_module components . &quot; Technically , it was not very challenging , &quot; said President Russ Brown . &quot; ( But ) the mission itself excited the imagination . You could not help but feel it. &quot; Most of the activity during the Apollo days was at Rockwell International Corp . ( North_American Aviation until 1967 and North_American Rockwell until 1972 ) . At the time , North_American ' s space operations were based in Downey , where the spacecraft was made , and in Seal Beach , where the company built the second stage of the Saturn V rocket that launched the astronauts into space . Its Rocketdyne Division built boosters for the rocket in Canoga Park . The mastermind of the company ' s foray_into space was Harrison ( Stormy ) Storms , an aerospace maverick who lived_on the Palos Verdes Peninsula . When he took_over the company ' s missile division in Downey in 1960 , Storms already had played a pivotal role in the development of the P-51 Mustang during World_War_II , the F-86 Sabre Jet of the Korean_War , the F-100 Super Sabre and the X-15 rocket . At the time , he could see that defense contracts were_on the wane . Author Mike Gray , in his book on North_American ' s Apollo_program , &quot; Angle_of_Attack , &quot; wrote : &quot; The romantic era when half_a_dozen guys could gather_in a hotel_room and design a bomber over a_couple_of cases of beer was about to be replaced by something off the scale of everyone ' s experience -- something monumental. &quot; The change started in 1961 , when President John F . Kennedy called_for a trip to the moon by the end of the decade . Storms had shared the same goal since he was a young_man . &quot; As long as I can remember , he said , ' I want the moon with a red ribbon on it , ' &quot; said his widow , Phyllis Storms , who lives_in Rancho Palos Verdes . &quot; This was a whole new adventure , whole new worlds. &quot; But competing aerospace firms had a head_start on the moon_shot , and some called North_American ' s team &quot; tin benders , &quot; according to Gray ' s book . So Storms assembled a team of experts that eventually became known as the &quot; Storm_Troopers , &quot; named for the group ' s swift action in launching the Downey facility ' s space_program . &quot; We were a well-organized , well-managed team , &quot; said David Levine , 67 , who was chief electrician and has since retired in Palm Springs . &quot; Certainly Stormy was the fire , the incentive , the motivator. &quot; Storms also was tough to work for : He often pitted teams of engineers against each other to come_up with solutions to solve a problem . &quot; He fired me about five dozen times , &quot; said Hermosa Beach resident Earl Blount , who was in_charge of the space division ' s public relations . &quot; Stormy , of course , he was the guy ( who ) made_it happen . We were just the unseen ditchdiggers. &quot; Overall , the work_force of North_American ' s space division multiplied . By 1964 , at the height of the development , 35 # 000 employees worked there , most of them in Downey . The plant gained national attention . Astronauts , including Armstrong , Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins from Apollo 11 , often came_to perform flight simulations and tests , staying overnight at the Tahitian Village , a hotel down the street with a Polynesian theme . The astronauts became friendswith some of the top designers and engineers . &quot; It was a good feeling to get_on top of a rocket ship with 6 million pounds under you , and you can say , ' These are my friends who built this , ' &quot; said astronaut Scott , who also went_on the Apollo 9 mission in March , 1969 , which tested the spacecraft ' s docking functions within earth ' s orbit . Some of the safeguards were designed by trial_and_error . For example , one of the titanium tanks for the spacecraft ' s engines exploded in a test at the Downey plant , said Gibb , the Westchester engineer . But there was no explosion in identical tests done_by the tank ' s manufacturer . The problem : Pure nitrogen tetroxide , the chemical that was placed in the tanks , undergoes a violent reaction with titanium . They added water to dilute it . &quot; You were dealing with problems with technology that was never designed before , &quot; Gibb said . In addition , because of NASA ' s efforts at quality_control , all_of the metals had to be traced back to their origins -- right down to where the metals in screws were mined . That meant taxing hours . Employees sometimes were away for days , or were called to work in the middle of the night to fix a problem . If a test failed , it could mean working into the night until it was corrected . &quot; One Christmas , I spent the morning with my family , but at 11:30 I got_on an airplane in Southern California and headed_off ( for Houston ) , &quot; said Manhattan Beach resident George Merrick , 66 , then the chief engineer of the command service module programs . &quot; I said , ' OK , guys , I ' ll see you later. ' The way it was , if it took six days a week to get the job done , you did it. &quot; * The long hours and the workers ' single-minded dedication to the job were often hard on the their families . &quot; If we could get_down to a 10-hour day , we were lucky , &quot; said Bud Benner , 70 , of Cowan Heights , who was chief of engineering for spacecraft design . &quot; Your family suffers . I was very fortunate I had a wife who brought_up our boys in good shape. &quot; During the height of development in the mid-1960s , Benner ' s 13-year-old son died of a blood infection . &quot; That was pretty rough , &quot; he said . &quot; It was devastating for my wife . I had to go soft for a while and pull_back . But then you get involved again , all kinds of hours . These are very challenging programs . You can ' t just coast . I was back within a couple months. &quot; Other employees suffered health_problems or serious stress effects . Storms had a heart_attack at_work . &quot; He , of course , didn ' t want to go_to hospital , but , of course , they took him , &quot; Phyllis Storms said . Her husband suffered a major setback in January , 1967 , when three astronauts were killed in an explosion at Cape Canaveral . Later , Long_Beach ' s three offshore oil islands were named in their honor . Stormy &quot; was extremely depressed , &quot; Phyllis Storms said . &quot; It was just terrible . Those were his friends. &quot; The cause was believed to be a spark that ignited the pure oxygen that filled the capsule . Charles Feltz , then the spacecraft program manager , said he and others argued for an escape_hatch , but NASA told them to take it out . * Even so , part of the blame eventually was passed to the company , and the accident cost Storms his job . He was replaced as president of the space division . &quot; Stormy happened to be the one who paid the price , &quot; said Blount , the public relations worker . Storms served briefly as a vice_president of the company , and then became a consultant to the aerospace industry . He died in 1992 . The problems caused some workers at the facility to become even more driven . &quot; There was a kind of anger when everyone pointed fingers at everyone else , &quot; Blount said . &quot; But there was a determination to do even better. &quot; In the end , North_American delivered a spacecraft light enough to be thrust into space and durable enough to withstand the 3 # 000-degree heat upon re-entry into Earth ' s atmosphere . The command_module -- the only part of the spacecraft left by the end of the mission -- contained about 15 miles of wire and had 2 million functional parts . But it was just under 11 feet tall and 13 feet wide , and weighed 12 # 800 pounds . When Apollo 11 was launched , Storms watched from a boat that a friend had chartered . He was not invited to Cape Canaveral . And 4 1 / 2 days later , when Armstrong set foot on the moon , Storms was watching TV at_home in Palos Verdes Estates , alone with his wife . At the North_American plant , a model of the solar_system was set_up in the auditorium , along with speakers to carry the astronauts ' radio communications . Employees who were off that Sunday tell stories of swarming to TV_sets and radios . &quot; I was_on the golf_course with my wife and a_couple_of other people , &quot; said Dan Brown , 60 , of Fountain Valley , who was director of manufacturing and now is a company vice_president . &quot; A man came_up_to me and said , ' You want me to believe that man is walking on the moon ? Not in my lifetime. ' He didn ' t believe it. &quot; * At North_American , employees got_to celebrate when the astronauts came_back to earth . There was a big splashdown party at the Tahitian Village . Several weeks later , the three astronauts came_to thank the workers for their contributions . But even as they celebrated , the program was winding down . &quot; We were laying_off hundreds of people almost instantly , &quot; Blount said . When Walter Cronkite went_to the plant to do a story on the layoffs , the employees he interviewed all said they were proud_of the Apollo_program , Blount said . Thinking that it was a public relations ploy on the part of the company , Cronkite approached an elderly woman who had been laid_off . Her response was the same . &quot; She told him , ' My grandkids will know I worked_on this program , ' &quot; Blount recalled . Rockwell went_on to build the space shuttle , and the company currently is constructing a docking module and shuttle upgrades at its Downey site . * Many of the astronauts have tried entrepreneurial ventures . Former astronaut Scott is president of Scott Science and Technology in Santa Monica , a business that is promoting smaller lunar missions and satellite salvage operations . Apollo 12 astronaut Richard F . Gordon of Manhattan Beach runs Space_Age America , a small company gathering artifacts for a Japanese space museum . A group of other Apollo veterans , meanwhile , are planning a 25th anniversary celebration of the moon landing for July 20 , when a host of engineering firms will be honored for their role in the mission . Others have lost touch with their colleagues . Levine , the electronics engineer , says he ' s spent the past 15 years getting_to know his family . Few of his Palm Springs neighbors even know that he worked_on Apollo . &quot; There ' s almost no interest , &quot; he said . &quot; A good basketball_game has almost more interest than space . It ' s hard to believe . But every time I see the moon , I see the guys walking up there , and I think_about what an incredible journey this was. &quot; Ted Johnson is a Times staff writer . Times staff writer Greg Johnson also contributed to this story . Mission to the Moon Redondo Beach : TRW Inc. designed and built the engine for the lunar_module that allowed astronauts to descend onto the moon from their hovering spacecraft . In 1970 , Apollo 13 astronauts used the engines to return to Earth after an explosion in their capsule forced the moon mission to be aborted . Downey : North_American Aviation , later Rockwell International , designed and built the spacecraft for the Apollo missions , including the command and service modules . It also built the adapter that housed the lunar_module . Seal Beach : Rockwell built the second stage of the Saturn V rocket , which thrust astronauts from Cape Canaveral into space . The rocket part was loaded on a barge from the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station and shipped to Cape Canaveral . El Segundo : Rockwell built parts used in the docking of the command and lunar_modules , as well as a launch escape tower . Source : Rockwell , TRW .</TEXT>
