   <HEADLINE> JAPAN PLANS A FUND AS AMENDS FOR SEX SLAVES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japan as early as Wednesday will announce a 10-year , $ 1-billion program to indirectly compensate women used as sex slaves by Japanese soldiers and other individuals , who were victimized by Japan ' s World_War_II aggression , a Foreign Ministry official said today . Socialist Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama will make the announcement and his chief Cabinet secretary , Kozo Igarashi , will spell_out the details , the official said . Designed to launch a yearlong period of self-reflection leading to the 50th anniversary of Japan ' s defeat , the announcement will mark a reversal of decades of postwar diplomatic efforts to avoid any form of accepting responsibility for acts against individuals in Japan ' s war with China , which began in 1931 , and World_War_II . It is an outgrowth of an order that former Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa issued after the 38-year rule of the Liberal Democratic Party ended last August . Hosokawa told the Foreign Ministry to develop a comprehensive package resolving all issues left over from World_War_II . Disagreements over details within the Japanese bureaucracy forced Murayama to hold_off announcement of the measures before departing last Tuesday on a four-nation Southeast Asian trip . He will return later today . Clearing up doubts about Japan ' s consciousness of its past is regarded by many -- although not all -- Japanese leaders as necessary to open the door to an active foreign_policy in Asia . Although governments run_by the Liberal Democratic Party expressed &quot; regrets &quot; for suffering Japan caused during the war , no prime_minister until Hosokawa ever admitted that Japan ' s war in Asia was &quot; a war of aggression. &quot; Even Hosokawa later toned_down that comment to say Japan ' s war had been filled with &quot; aggressive acts , &quot; implying that not all_of the war constituted aggression . Since May , two Cabinet_ministers -- one in the government of former Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata and one in Murayama ' s coalition Cabinet that includes Liberal Democrats -- were forced to resign after denying that Japan had committed aggression during the war . The San Francisco Peace_Treaty of 1951 and other pacts that Japan signed with all_of its wartime enemies -- except Russia and North_Korea -- have settled legally the issue of reparations with each of the countries concerned . But for individual victims of its wartime acts of aggression , &quot; Japan has done virtually nothing , compared with Germany , &quot; its wartime ally , Igarashi , the chief Cabinet secretary , told reporters last week . Demands have been increasing in recent years from groups of wartime victims throughout Asia and as far away as the_Netherlands and England . A poll published by the Asahi newspaper last week found that more_than 70 % of Japanese believe that their country has not paid enough compensation to Asian victims of World_War_II . The package of measures Murayama will announce will touch upon issues such_as repayment of wartime postal savings by Taiwan Chinese who were drafted into the Imperial Army and the repatriation to South_Korea of Korean forced laborers left on Russia ' s Sakhalin Island after the war . Taiwan , from 1895 , and Korea , from 1910 , were colonies of Japan until its defeat in 1945 . But the focal_point of Wednesday ' s announcement is expected to be the $ 1-billion fund that will be used to symbolically compensate for Japan ' s enslavement of as_many as 200 # 000 women who were forced to serve as prostitutes for Japanese soldiers fighting as far away as Burma . Most of the women came from Korea but large_numbers also were conscripted from the Philippines . The money is to be used to establish a foundation that will build and operate youth centers in a number of Asian_countries to train youths , promote exchanges and collect historical materials . Japanese media also have reported that the government is considering a separate plan to establish a $ 100-million , privately financed fund from which to make direct payments to victims . Although President Kim Young Sam said South_Korea would seek no monetary compensation for them , groups of the former sex slaves -- or &quot; comfort women , &quot; as wartime Japanese euphemistically called them -- have demanded direct payments . The Seoul-based Korean Council for Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan already condemned the proposed youth exchange center plan as a sop by the Japanese government to avoid assuming legal responsibility for the acts of its wartime military . Lila Pilipina , a Philippine organization of former sex slaves , also demanded apologies to each of the victims in the Philippines , as well as direct monetary payments . Murayama apologized in each of the cities he visited -- Manila , Hanoi , Kuala Lumpur and Singapore -- for Japan ' s &quot; acts of aggression &quot; and vowed that Japan will never again become a military giant . But in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysian Prime_Minister Mahathir Mohammed told Murayama that Japan should stop apologizing for the war and start assuming political leadership in Asia and the world by becoming a permanent member of the U.N. Security_Council .</TEXT>
