   <TEXT> Only in the Byzantine world of regulatory politics could something called the &quot; common_sense initiative &quot; be called a revolution . But the federal_government ' s chief environmental regulator is touting common_sense as the newest wrinkle in rule-making to protect the environment . Carol Browner , administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency , is calling_for &quot; a new generation &quot; of rules that &quot; work in tandem rather than at cross purposes &quot; to control pollution . Late last month , Browner launched a pilot_program to devise packages of regulations tailored for six industries : metal plating , electronics and computers , automobile , petroleum , printing , and iron and steel . Those packages would replace a costly and confusing tangle of regulations designed to protect air , land and water individually . &quot; We ' re always sending the message that your air problem is separate from your water problem , which is separate from your waste problem , which is separate from your worker safety problem -- the message that environmental protection can and should be split apart into different pieces , &quot; said Nikki Roy , a former EPA regulator and now an analyst at the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington . &quot; But if you ' re interested in pollution prevention , you need to think_of all these things at the same time. &quot; Adhering to regulations designed to protect and clean the environment now costs U.S. industries at least $ 30 billion a year . And yet , under often-conflicting federal regulations , industries are playing what Roy called &quot; toxic shell_games , &quot; where pollutants are shuffled from air to water , or water to land , or land to air . For most industries , keeping_up with the EPA ' s complex of regulations is frustrating and costly . And for regulators lurching from environmental crisis to environmental crisis , the rule-making process has become a discouraging routine of plugging holes and fighting industries . The result , said Browner recently : &quot; Too_little environmental protection at too high a cost ( and ) increasing frustration with the process of environmental regulation. &quot; Here are two of the plentiful examples of the problem : * Until recently at steel plants nationwide , clean-water regulations prevented the disposal of waste water laden with toxic contaminants into nearby rivers , lakes or sewage facilities . But federal regulations appeared to allow plant employees to use the waste water to cool superheated coke as it came_out of huge ovens . That took_care of the waste water : It was instantly vaporized , and the ammonia , benzene and cyanide it contained passed_out into the air through the plant ' s ventilation_system . In recent years , the EPA has worked to close the regulatory loophole , but similar ones are always cropping_up . * One large chemical manufacturing facility in New Jersey , following a directive issued by the EPA ' s office of air quality , installed a &quot; wet air scrubber &quot; on its smokestack -- a device that washes smog-producing contaminants out of the airstream and dissolves them into waste water . A different EPA directive -- this one issued by the agency ' s office of water quality -- required the firm to install a device that strips pollutants out of waste water and releases them back into the air . Installing this revolving door for pollutants cost the company $ 3 million . But the effect was the same as if no anti-pollution devices had been installed . Under the new EPA initiative , industry and labor representatives , environmental and citizens ' groups and federal and state regulators would gather together to develop what Browner called &quot; a blueprint for how to achieve real environmental protection &quot; in given industries . Everything is_on the table , including the possibility of new legislation , Browner said . The six industries represent 11 % of U.S. gross_domestic_product and employ nearly 4 million people . The effort at environmental perestroika comes at a time when the EPA is under unprecedented attack on Capitol_Hill . Lawmakers have cited the agency ' s history of generating complex and costly regulations to oppose a welter of new environmental initiatives . Among the legislation held_up by the congressional opposition is a bill setting purity standards for drinking_water , another designed to reduce pollution in lakes , rivers and streams , and a proposal to elevate EPA to Cabinet status . &quot; Some of the complaints we hear are legitimate , &quot; Browner acknowledged recently . &quot; We tell people to go_in five directions at one time . We cannot continue this incremental system of regulation. &quot;</TEXT>
