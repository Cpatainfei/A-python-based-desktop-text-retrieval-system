   <TEXT> Re &quot; The Real Cost of Crack &quot; series , Dec . 18-21 : At last we are offered a comprehensive view of the destruction visited on all_of us caused by the abuse of crack . My wife and I are foster_parents and are adopting two babies born addicted , and we have had ample opportunity to view firsthand the horrifying effects of this ugly epidemic . I , personally , have come_to the conclusion that nothing will save our society except to stop this scourge at its source . That is , we need a comprehensive effort to prevent crack-addicted parents from bringing children into this world who are virtually all dumped on society for us to deal with . We need to divert money to birth_control clinics ( lots of them ) where addicted mothers can get free abortions , tubal_ligations or Norplant , along with some kind of monetary reward for coming_in . We need to offer mothers who deliver addicted babies the choice of tubal_ligation and help with their addiction , or we need to give them jail time . Harsh ? Not at all . Harsh is a baby going_through months of agonizing withdrawal . Harsh is having to grow_up with no one to truly love or care_for you . Harsh is trying to cope_with life with a severely damaged nervous_system . PHILIP G . deCARION Laguna Beach * &quot; The Hidden Devastation of Crack &quot; ( Dec . 18 ) is wrong-headed and exacerbates the very problem it is presumably trying to help . The major problem with the article is its thesis , which seems to be that crack is so powerful , people are victims of its seduction . Crack users are no more victims of this mind-altering substance than are drinkers of alcohol . It is a matter of personal choice , for which the individual is responsible . According to the National Institute on Drug_Addiction ' s annual household survey , the percentage of people between ages 18 and 25 ( the most drug-prone years ) that had used an illicit drug during the last month declined steadily from 37 % in 1979 to 15 % in 1991 . Even allowing_for changes in the age range of the population during that period , this suggests that , while overall drug use was declining , many who became crack users were simply changing from one drug to another , rather than being snared anew by the irresistible pull of a new demon drug . The sooner we start placing the responsibility for drug_abuse on the individual , rather than on the drug , or society , or economics , or a flawed childhood , the sooner we will begin directing our anti-drug efforts toward prevention through education and help through treatment . DIRK C . ELDREDGE Long_Beach * As reported , crack has made Skid_Row a younger , meaner place . And as we have long stated , lack of housing is not the problem . Willingness to spend income on housing is the problem . Newly employed &quot; graduates &quot; of our award-winning shelter , Transition House , have never had a problem locating appropriate housing . Our challenge lies_in making homeless people employable and educating them to spend their money on housing and not on drugs . MARTHA BROWN HICKS , President Skid_Row Development Corp . Los Angeles * The series on the crack epidemic was excellent . However , I ' m sorry that it focused so_much on African American people . The ravages of crack go beyond that community . I have some expertise on this subject , since I ' m a so-called drug war refugee . I lived for years in a crack-infested neighborhood three blocks from MacArthur Park , until we finally had to flee due_to death threats . I observed that the majority of the buyers were white . I saw obviously affluent men as well as suburban homemaker types with_children in safety seats purchasing crack on my street . It would be really informative to investigate how all races , ages and income_brackets have been involved in spreading the disease of crack cocaine . ELLEN SNORTLAND Lake View Terrace</TEXT>
