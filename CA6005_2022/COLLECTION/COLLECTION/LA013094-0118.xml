   <TEXT> The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences has collected some of the top music performances from Grammy Awards telecasts on a new series of CDs and videos . The first set of four CDs and two videos , being released by Atlantic on Feb . 7 , includes music from Michael Jackson , Sting , Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond , Bonnie Raitt , Tina Turner , Eric Clapton and Aretha Franklin . . . . Looks_like it ' ll be a wait for a full new Whitney Houston album , but a greatest-hits package -- probably featuring a new song or two -- is_due in summer or early fall . . . . TLC is finally putting the finishing touches_on its second album , which is now due in April , but the three female rappers will be heard before then , guest starring on Keith Sweat ' s single &quot; How Do You Like It ? &quot; in March . . . . Speaking of hot guest stars , rappers-singers Nice N ' Smooth scored Bobby Brown for the first single , &quot; Return of the Hip-Hop Freaks , &quot; from their April album . Also guesting : House of Pain ' s Everlast and Cypress Hill ' s B-Real . . . . The rap community is eagerly awaiting the second album by Public Enemy ' s deejay Terminator X -- a collection of songs with him producing , but others rapping . The track that ' s really got everyone excited is &quot; Sticka , &quot; featuring Chuck D , Ice_Cube , Ice-T and MC Lyte . . . . Meanwhile , despite continued rumors that Public Enemy has retired , the group , with Chuck D at the helm as usual , is in the studio working_on an album that ' s due this summer . . . . David Lee Roth does country ? Not exactly . His upcoming album , &quot; Your Filthy Little Mouth , &quot; due March 22 , features a duet between Roth and Travis Tritt on a number titled &quot; Cheatin ' Heart Cafe &quot; and Diamond Dave ' s version of Willie Nelson ' s standard &quot; Night Life. &quot; But a spokesman says that the album is all rock . . . . Anton Corbijn is the director of an upcoming video for longtime collaborators Depeche Mode . The clip for &quot; In Your Room &quot; will feature several images recycled from past Mode clips . The song itself has been remixed by Butch Vig ( he produced Nirvana ' s &quot; Nevermind &quot; album ) and is vastly different from the album version . . . . John Cale , fresh from the brief Velvet Underground reunion , is teaming with veteran singer-songwriter Bob Neuwirth for &quot; Last_Day , &quot; a &quot; song-cycle &quot; album of related songs. *</TEXT>
