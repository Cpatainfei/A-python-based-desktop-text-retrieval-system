   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS : COUNTYWIDE ; AIRPORT INITIATIVE STIRS HEATED DEBATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With a month to go before election_day , opponents and backers of a commercial airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station traded charges Friday during a forum taped at the KOCE-TV studios in Huntington Beach . The forum on Measure A , a countywide initiative on the Nov . 8 ballot that seeks a General Plan amendment to build an airport at El Toro , was supposed to last a half hour . But the four panelists kept the heated exchange going_after the cameras were turned_off , accusing one another of distorting the facts . Businessman and developer George Argyros and Garden Grove City Councilman Mark Leyes spoke in favor of Measure A . Mission Viejo Mayor Susan Withrow and William Kogerman , co-chairman of Taxpayers for Responsible Planning , spoke against the initiative . Argyros and Leyes said that converting El Toro into a commercial airport after the military pulls_out at the end of the decade would create thousands of jobs and make Orange County more competitive in the world economy . &quot; This is a wonderful opportunity . This is a chance to decide on the future , &quot; Argyros said . Withrow and Kogerman strongly disagreed , saying it would cost billions of tax dollars to build an air cargo facility at El Toro . Kogerman said passage of Measure A would &quot; short-circuit &quot; the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority , a county panel already working to craft a redevelopment plan for the base . &quot; The viability of the whole issue has to be considered through the ( county planning ) process , &quot; Kogerman said . Leyes countered that the planning authority is &quot; biased &quot; in favor of South County cities that oppose an airport because of noise , traffic and pollution concerns . He said Measure A gives all voters a chance to decide the issue . The forum will be broadcast on KOCE-TV Oct . 26 at 6:30 p.m. and Oct . 27 at 10 p.m. SHELBY GRAD</TEXT>
