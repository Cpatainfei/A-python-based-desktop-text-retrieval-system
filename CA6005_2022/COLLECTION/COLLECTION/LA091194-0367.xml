   <HEADLINE> RETURNING TO TRADE ; COMMERCE : VIETNAMESE EMIGRANTS ARE RETURNING TO THEIR HOMELAND AS EXPECTANT CAPITALISTS -- AND FINDING BOTH OPPORTUNITY AND FRUSTRATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In District 3 , just north of the center of town , an upscale boutique stands_out among the battered stores , sidewalk bicycle repairmen and pushcart vendors selling noodles with pungent-smelling meats and sauces . Squeaky-clean windows and doors give_way to freshly painted walls , racks of silk and linen dresses and a row of wooden dressing_rooms . The sign atop the store , one of three in the former Saigon owned by a pair of 33-year-old Americans , reads &quot; Dung / Joyce U.S.A Fashion. &quot; Owners Tony Vuong , a women ' s clothing designer with outlets in Orange and Los Angeles counties , and Danny Trinh , a former resident of Alhambra who has moved to Ho Chi Minh City , are among a vanguard of emigres leading a drive by U.S. business to take_advantage of the new freedom to trade and invest in Vietnam . They opened the store in February , the same month President Clinton lifted the nearly 20-year-old ban on commerce with America ' s wartime foe . For them , Vietnam -- which has been trying since 1986 to re-enter world markets after years of isolation -- is the latest business frontier . It seems to offer limitless opportunities , not to mention low labor costs . &quot; Whenever a communist country opens_up , its economy can only go_up year after year , &quot; Vuong said here recently . This year , international trade and investment in Vietnam -- where foreign employers are required to offer a minimum_wage of just $ 35 a month -- is expected to total about $ 9 billion , according to Virginia Foote , president of the United States-Vietnam Trade Council in Washington . But while some U.S. businesses -- among them many small businesses owned by Vietnamese Americans -- welcome the chance to catch_up_with competitors who haven ' t been kept_out of Vietnam by economic embargoes , most are still cautious . The ban , they note , was lifted only seven months ago , so many firms are still researching opportunities in this nation of 70 million people . Business people also warn that commerce in Vietnam can be a nightmare of frustrating bureaucracy , incompetent or greedy officials and uncertain business laws . &quot; When a country has been closed for 20 years like this , there has to be a time in between with lots of problems before it gets better , &quot; Vuong said . &quot; There ' s no business court you can go_to to if contracts are broken . It takes forever to get licenses to do anything , and corruption here is worse than ever , &quot; said the designer , who owns Cerlini boutiques in Westminster ' s Little Saigon and in Alhambra . &quot; But we ' re here because we ' re looking_to the future in this market. &quot; According to Foote , between February and early July , 15 projects with a total value of $ 141.9 million had been awarded to U.S. companies -- big ones such_as Coca-Cola Co . and smaller ones such_as Dung / Joyce . That placed the United States 15th among nations doing business with Vietnam , but the ranking should rise soon , analysts say , because hundreds of Americans are now in Vietnam closing deals or developing relationships with entrepreneurs and investors . A good_example is American Rice Inc. , a subsidiary of Los Angeles-based Erly Industries Inc. , which recently set_up a joint_venture with Vietnam ' s ministry of agricuture to begin producing rice for export to the U.S. and other countries . The company ' s first shipment of rice to the United States left Vietnam in April , said Richard McCombs , American Rice ' s chief financial_officer , and the company hopes that is only the beginning . Vietnam ' s cheap labor and other low costs attracted his company ' s interest , he said . * The arrival of foreign capital is good news to Vietnamese government officials , who estimate that more_than $ 40 billion will be needed through 2000 to keep their nation ' s economy growing at 8 % to 10 % a year . ( Economic expansion was 8.3 % in 1992 , according to the General Statistics Office. ) Tourism and exports -- of crude_oil , rice , seafood , coffee , coal and rubber -- helped to feed that rise , but the nation is dependent_on imported fuel , construction equipment , cars and fertilizers , as well as consumer goods such_as clothing and computers . &quot; Basically , we need everything , because we ' re starting from the bottom , &quot; said Tran Thien Cuong , speaking_for the Chamber_of_Commerce and Industry of Vietnam . Officials in Hanoi readily acknowledge the difficulties of doing business in their country . &quot; We ' re still new at this , so we ' re making_up laws to fit our uses as we go_along , and that can be inconvenient for Americans , we know , &quot; Cuong said . &quot; Americans like everything to be clearly defined : Water is water ; fire is fire . But this is the time when fortunes are made . After the rules are written clearly , the big opportunities will be gone. &quot; Besides trying to straighten_out commercial_law , officials are trying to clean_up extortion and other improprieties among government administrators and employees , he said . Violators include license regulators , police_officers and airport customs clerks . &quot; Corruption is our biggest misfortune . The hard economic times have created this very ugly industry , but we ' re determined to solve this problem , &quot; Cuong said . Ironically , the crackdown on illegal business practices actually hurt a deal that another Vietnamese American was developing . Christopher Phong Tran , the 29-year-old president of Tymes International Inc. , a Westminster investment_company , was to sign a contract_in April to import clothing made by Legamax , a major Vietnamese garment maker with plants in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City . The company is partly owned by the Hanoi government . Several days after Tran arrived in Ho Chi Minh City , however , federal_officials fired Legamax ' s chairwoman . An audit of the company ' s books accused her of applying for too many loans from international banks , according to the Vietnam Investment Review newspaper . Officials put_off Tran ' s negotiations indefinitely as they conducted further audits of the management of the 8 # 000-employee company . Since then , the government has replaced most of the firm ' s executives , Tran said recently . &quot; It can be very unpredictable here , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s the risk you take. &quot; Though not yet 30 , Tran is a seasoned businessman who has been working_on deals here since the late 1980s . His father and older brother brought him along on business trips to Vietnam , then helped him start his own company . On his own , he scouted investment opportunities and waited for the United States to lift the trade_embargo . Though the Legamax deal fell_through , Tran used the time to set_up a branch office . He also met with potential Vietnamese partners in the banking , seafood and travel industries . Tran , who left Saigon at 13 and later graduated from UCLA , typifies the young Vietnamese American business professionals who have few memories of their birthplace but are now visiting it several times a year to wheel and deal . They can be seen riding around the major cities of Vietnam in hired cars or zipping around on Honda motorbikes . They are never without cellular_phones . Some , like Tran , spend several weeks on each trip ; others stay for long-term assignments as corporate managers . Ideologically , they are distant from many of their expatriated elders , who frown_on renewed ties with the Communist regime that forced 2 million Vietnamese into exile with the fall of South Vietnam in 1975 . Nearly half the emigres now live_in the United States . &quot; I know the past was horrible , but it ' s still the past , &quot; Tran said . &quot; We , the young people , are trying to go_on . We are the future , and we ' re trying to work for the future. &quot; Each time he lands at Tan Son Nhut Airport in Ho Chi Minh City , Tran said , he still feels angry that his native_land is so poor compared to many of its Asian neighbors . &quot; I get upset when I see foreign businessmen in Vietnam making_fun of our people or the lack of conveniences , &quot; Tran said . &quot; I ask myself why it has to be that way . I want to help Vietnam improve . I want to create jobs. &quot; About 3 % of the 70 million people of Vietnam are jobless , according to Cuong , the official with Vietnam ' s commerce group . The average annual income of a Vietnamese worker is about $ 300 , but that figure belies the true buying power of Vietnamese citizens : Hundreds of thousands of families here receive money from relatives and friends living abroad . Their annual contribution is estimated at $ 500 million or more , Cuong said . But consumers have few choices . that ' s where Vuong and Trinh see opportunity . On a visit last year to Ho Chi Minh City , they said , they noticed women from abroad coming_to Vietnam to work , more foreign companies hiring local women and more local women opening their own businesses . Yet there were few shops offering professional dress_suits for women . After conducting interviews , the partners estimated that about 5 % of Ho Chi Minh City ' s 4 million to 5 million residents were adult women able to afford designer clothes . They opened their first boutique in Ho Chi Minh City in February . Their hunch proved correct , and customers scooped_up $ 80 suits and $ 100 dresses -- prices comparable_to those in the United States . So Vuong and Trinh opened two more shops in Ho Chi Minh City . Even at a small percentage of the city ' s women , the customer base &quot; is still more_than the same target market in Orange County , where there are only about 100 # 000 Vietnamese , &quot; Trinh said . &quot; We ' re ahead. &quot; Outside the original Dung / Joyce boutique in District 3 , where the partners have their headquarters in an upstairs office , the searing afternoon heat was pierced by the sounds of roaring motorbikes , scooters and cars . But the air-conditioned shop was comfortable and the city noises could barely be heard inside . Dang Thi Minh Ngan , a 21-year-old saleswoman , said customers realize that they need to catch_up_with international fashions . &quot; The newer the styles , the more they like and buy , &quot; she said , standing among the business_suits and dresses . &quot; We actually teach them how to dress. &quot; Even the color black -- which had been considered impractical for the warm climate here and unfashionable because it is associated with death in Vietnamese culture -- is starting to come_into vogue , Ngan said . Explained Trinh : &quot; We tell them it ' s sophisticated and that it ' s very popular in the West. &quot; The partners plan to open their own clothing manufacturing_plant in Ho Chi Minh City by the end of the year . &quot; Who knows ? Maybe after that , we open a store in Hanoi , &quot; Vuong said . Another consumer product in short supply in Vietnam is computers . &quot; Vietnam is starting from ground zero , &quot; said David J . Drinkard , a representative for Maynard , Mass.-based Digital Equipment Corp . &quot; And as its market takes_off , it will help ( Digital ) worldwide. &quot; Digital executives have hired eight Vietnamese salespeople to promote their products , opened an office in Hanoi and want to open another in Ho Chi Minh City , he said . Though Drinkard said he likes being a pioneer in the nation ' s computer market , he called Vietnam &quot; a hardship post. &quot; &quot; What could be taken_care of anywhere else with a phone_call or a fax requires a meeting here , &quot; said Drinkard , a native of St . Louis . &quot; Things take longer . &quot; It ' s because of the lack of exposure to international business practices , &quot; he said . &quot; I do a lot of training here to get people used to the nature of business , like marketing and keeping_up with new technology. &quot; Vietnamese workers are learning quickly and have the reputation of being easy to train , Drinkard added . Vietnam ' s General Statistics Office estimates that the nation ' s work_force totals more_than 30 million people and that the literacy rate is nearly 90 % . More_than 10 # 000 Vietnamese have earned doctorates , mostly in social and technological subjects , from universities in the former Soviet_Union and Eastern Europe . To Jeannie Wey , who represents Vision Air Expedition Inc. , a Los Angeles-based wholesale broker of airline tickets , the biggest obstruction to doing business in Vietnam is the language_barrier . &quot; You have to find somebody good who can speak Vietnamese to work for you , someone who has to know the system and which official to go_to for what , &quot; Wey said . She chose Tran of Tymes International Inc. He and Wey met after his travel_agency , a division of the investment_firm , became one of Vision Air ' s clients several years ago . Now the two are building relationships with Vietnam ' s two airlines to prepare_for the day when , they believe , the United States will open direct routes to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City . But there ' s another problem Wey is glad to handle herself : Most of Vietnam ' s investors and traders are men -- and most still aren ' t used to negotiating with professional women . &quot; They ' re usually taken_aback by me , &quot; she said , smiling . &quot; But I just go_ahead and stick my hand_out . They ' re still trying to get used to shaking hands with a woman. &quot; Vietnam ' s Economy Blooming Economic growth in Vietnam is advancing at an impressive rate . In 1985 , imports and exports were valued at just $ 1.4 billion . Seven years later , the most recent year for which information is available , the comparable figure was $ 5 billion . As American investment increases , growth will doubtless accelerate . Import-Export Trend The value of Vietnam ' s exports increased almost 400 % between 1985 and 1992 , nearly matching the value of all imports . Amounts in millions of dollars : Imports ( 1992 ) : $ 2 # 535 Exports ( 1992 ) : $ 2 # 475 Petroleum ' s Place Petroleum figures prominently in Vietnamese trade . Refined petroleum products ranked as the second-largest group of_imports in 1992 , while crude_oil had by far the largest share of total exports : Imports : Capital goods * : 37 % Petroleum products : 23 % Fertilizer : 9 % Steel : 3 % Other : 28 % * Exports : Petroleum : 32 % Agriculture , forestry products : 18 % Rice : 17 % Marine products : 12 % Light industrial goods : 9 % Other : 12 % * Materials , equipment or products used to produce salable goods Foreign Investment Taiwanese interests were the top investors in Vietnam for the period 1987 through July , 1994 . U.S. investors rank behind those in 14 other nations , having faced a trade_embargo until February . Top foreign investments by country , amounts in millions of dollars : 02 # 15 , 12 Country Investment Taiwan $ 1 # 677 Hong Kong $ 1 # 671 Australia $ 756 France $ 717 South_Korea $ 716 Singapore $ 548 Japan $ 518 Malaysia $ 510 England $ 387 Holland $ 380 Switzerland $ 247 Thailand $ 194 Russia $ 173 Indonesia $ 160 United States $ 142 What ' s Next Some unresolved issues and steps_in U.S.-Vietnamese trade that will be addressed or completed in the near future : Liaison offices : The two governments are expected to open political liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington by the end of the year . Diplomatic relations : Though trade has been resumed , the United States has yet to fully normalize diplomatic relations with Vietnam . This step hinges_on Hanoi ' s cooperation on the MIA--POW issue . Government investment : Although U.S. firms are free to invest in Vietnam , government-funded investments are not yet allowed .
