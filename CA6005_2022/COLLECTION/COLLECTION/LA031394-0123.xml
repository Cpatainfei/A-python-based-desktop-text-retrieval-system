   <HEADLINE> RETHINKING THE BIOSPHERE ; ARIZONA EXPERIMENT COULD BE GREAT TOOL , IF LEADERS SHED IDEOLOGICAL BLINDERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the arid Arizona countryside just north of Tucson stands a superb scientific machine , a tightly sealed glass and steel complex rising 91 feet over the desert floor and covering the space of three football_fields . It is a private global-ecology lab to probe the human future on Earth and beyond , extending_to the colonization of Mars . Even NASA scientists say the space agency could not have done better . The only trouble is that its owners do not quite know how best to use it . The machine is Biosphere 2 , built privately at a cost of $ 150 million and bankrolled largely by Edward P . Bass , a Texas billionaire . Last September , seven people emerged after two years of attempting self-sufficiency in a closed system with 3 # 800 other species . ( The overly rich soil caused oxygen to drop so low that fresh air had to be pumped in. ) Just what was proved in those two years is unclear . When details of the proposed Biosphere first became known , some derided the project as more showmanship than science ; many mainstream scientists said it had no testable hypotheses or controlled experimental design . The Biosphere team responded well by asking_for a review by a panel of outside scientists chaired by a leading ecologist , Thomas E . Lovejoy of the Smithsonian Institution . But the panel quit in frustration , saying its calls_for more rigorous science fell mostly on deaf ears . &quot; That was not science , it was enclosed gardening , &quot; says Gerald A . Soffen , a panel member who was NASA ' s project scientist for the Viking mission to Mars . Still , the Biosphere folks learned lessons , and these now are being applied in a second venture . Last Sunday , seven new &quot; Biospherians &quot; entered the planetary test_tube . This time their stays will be shorter and more flexible , and various scientists will visit to conduct atmospheric , entomological and agricultural research . Oxygen will be piped_in as needed ; the outside advisers say that scientific results will be valid as long as input and output of chemicals or gases are measured . Thus , properly , the notion that Biosphere must be sealed has been abandoned . Also , 40 geckos and 50 toads have been introduced to control cockroaches , which seem to be determined to follow human_beings wherever they go . Still , Biosphere leaders bridle_at strict scientific methodology . The director_of_research , John B . Corliss , says that normal academic standards &quot; blunt &quot; creativity . &quot; Our goals are high , &quot; he says . &quot; The point of going_to Mars is to strive for perfection. &quot; As for outside advice , Corliss is candid : &quot; We listened more to those who were enthusiastic about Biosphere than those who were not. &quot; In other words , criticism is unwelcome . The Biosphere is a magnificent tool that could be a great boon to mankind , permitting ecological science on a scale never before possible . Let us hope that its leaders can see beyond their romantic ideological blinders .</TEXT>
