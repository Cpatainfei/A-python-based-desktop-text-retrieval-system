   <HEADLINE> UNREST WON ' T HARM S . AFRICA VOTE , OFFICIAL SAYS ; POLITICS : COMMISSIONER ACTS TO REASSURE CITIZENS . MEANWHILE , ZULUS DELAY SUMMIT WITH GOVERNMENT AND ANC TO DISCUSS CRISIS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hoping to reassure a traumatized city and a frightened nation , the head of the independent electoral commission calmly insisted Tuesday that the blazing gun battles and chaos that swept the central business_district here Monday will not derail or delay next month ' s democratic elections . &quot; Quite frankly , it does not seem to impact directly on the prospects of substantially free and fair elections , &quot; Judge Johann Kriegler told a news_conference . &quot; It may have major political implications . . . but I ' m pretty certain it will have no effect on the electoral process. &quot; But Kriegler added that a hastily formed task_force had gone overnight to KwaZulu , the volatile Zulu homeland run_by Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi , to determine if free and fair balloting will be possible there given Buthelezi ' s increasingly strident opposition to the elections and record levels of political violence in surrounding Natal province . The task_force has until April 5 to make its report . All-race elections for a national and nine provincial parliaments and the first post-apartheid government are scheduled for April 26-28 . If necessary , Kriegler said , the voting could be postponed in selected parts of KwaZulu until stability is assured . Here in Johannesburg , police said Tuesday that at least 34 people , including three police_officers , were killed and 173 wounded by gunfire and marauding mobs downtown on a day that one newspaper here dubbed &quot; Bloody Monday. &quot; An additional 18 people were killed in related factional violence in and around the black townships of Soweto . On Monday , there had been a confusing series of wild shooting sprees involving the police , African National Congress security_guards and thousands of anti-election Zulu protesters aligned with Buthelezi ' s Inkatha Freedom Party . Most of the Zulus marched through the streets armed with traditional weapons like spears and clubs , but many pulled_out automatic_pistols and assault_rifles when the shooting began . Each group blamed the others for instigating Monday ' s violence . But witnesses and participants gave vastly differing accounts of who fired the first shots . It was also impossible to prove widely accepted reports that snipers or agents provocateurs had opened_fire from high-rise office_buildings onto Zulus gathered peacefully in a grassy plaza in front of the main library . The downtown remained tense and filled with rumors Tuesday , but most shops and offices reopened , and trains and taxis resumed service . Sporadic shooting was reported , and unidentified gunmen in a speeding minivan fired at the heavily guarded ANC headquarters . No one was injured , and the gunmen escaped . ANC guards killed eight Zulus at a back corner of the headquarters , a 21-story office tower , in the worst single incident Monday , after armed protesters repeatedly circled the building and fired shots at ANC workers . On Tuesday , a team of police forensic experts investigated the blood-stained pavement and shattered windows nearby , in part to determine if the ANC guards had fired into the crowd from an overhead balcony . Hopes that the tragedy could spark a sense of urgency and force the feuding parties into a truce were dashed when the Zulu king , Goodwill Zwelithini , postponed an emergency , two-day peace summit at least until after Easter . Government officials had announced late Monday that President Frederik W . de Klerk , ANC President Nelson Mandela , Buthelezi and his nephew , the king , would meet this week for the first time to discuss the political crisis and the growing violence . But in a letter to De Klerk , Zwelithini said negotiations must wait until &quot; people have been given the opportunity to bury their dead and until such time as the fierce anger in their breast has abated somewhat. &quot; A scheduled meeting between Mandela and the king earlier this month was called_off after ANC officials reported assassination threats against their leader , who is expected to become the country ' s first black president . The Zulu leaders oppose the election and the country ' s interim constitution because they say it does not guarantee them the autonomy they seek for the estimated 8 million Zulus . The tribal Zulu homeland , created under apartheid to separate the races , is to be reincorporated into the new South_Africa after the elections . In Pretoria , the Transitional Executive_Council -- a multi-party group set_up to oversee the government in the run-up to the election -- ordered the drafting of regulations needed to declare a state of emergency in Natal province . Among other things , that declaration could allow the dispatch of troops to quell the violence there . John Kane-Berman , head of the Institute of Race Relations in Johannesburg , said Monday ' s violence increased pressure to delay elections until Zulu concerns can be addressed and an all-inclusive solution can be found . &quot; I hope the events here drive_home to politicians and foreign governments that the notion of holding a free and fair election in a month ' s time is a pipe_dream , &quot; he said in an interview . &quot; The sooner people realize that and stop living_in cloud cuckoo land , the better . . . . We now have to think_of the unthinkable -- postponing the elections. &quot; But Desmond Tutu , the Anglican archbishop and Nobel laureate , said in Cape_Town that a delay is impossible . &quot; The elections must happen , &quot; he said . The battle of Johannesburg marked the first time that the brutal factional fighting that has ravaged black townships for years moved_into the white-dominated city that is the commercial and political hub of the country . Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel declared central Johannesburg and 10 surrounding districts &quot; unrest areas , &quot; giving police enhanced powers of search and seizure , curfew and arrest to curb gatherings and quell disturbances .</TEXT>
