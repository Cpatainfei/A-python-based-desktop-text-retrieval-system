   <HEADLINE> RIORDAN ' S ENERGETIC AGENDA FACES ITS TOUGHEST CHALLENGE ; CITY_HALL : DESPITE GAINS , ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REMAINS ELUSIVE . MAYOR SAYS HE HAS LAID GROUNDWORK FOR CHANGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When he took the oath of office , Richard Riordan carried a promise of renewal for &quot; a city in need of safety and economic opportunity . . . a city desperate for hope. &quot; At the six-month mark of his tenure , the mayor of Los Angeles is winning praise for strides on the first and last themes . In a bleak period of budget retreat , Riordan managed to scrape together the down_payment on an ambitious crime-fighting plan that could noticeably increase the number of officers on the beat by summer . And many observers say that the mayor ' s energetic agenda and expressions of hope have helped revive expectations that the city ' s future can be brighter than its recent past . But at the turn of the year , interviews show , there is also a growing sense that the new mayor must pick_up the pace on his inaugural ' s most difficult theme : stimulating job creation and business opportunities . &quot; He has changed the chemistry and changed the dynamic in the community , &quot; said Los Angeles political consultant Rich Lichtenstein , who often represents business interests at City_Hall . &quot; Now he has to take some substantial initiatives to get some economic turnaround . . . or he will lose the momentum. &quot; &quot; I ' m not hearing from them a clear sense of what jobs they ' re looking_for ( or ) what they are looking_for ( generally ) in terms of economic development , &quot; said Councilwoman Ruth Galanter , who heads a key committee that oversees the city ' s business-oriented agencies . Fresh from a skiing vacation in the Idaho Rockies , where he could savor early successes , Riordan has returned to the dark-paneled reality of City_Hall and the enormous challenges ahead . Chief among them is devising a politically viable , balanced_budget and freeing up nearly $ 100 million more for the second phase of his five-year effort to expand the LAPD by 40 % . In an interview , Riordan was upbeat about the progress he has made and the prospects for working_through the difficult issues ahead . &quot; The main thing I ' m proud_of is the people I ' ve brought here , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s like building a building . You first hire an architect . You then put_up a foundation , and you don ' t see too_much . Then all_of a sudden , within a_few days , you put_up the superstructure and people see significantly more_than they have seen for the last year. &quot; The legacy of this Administration , many analysts and elected officials believe , will be written more in the coming six months than in the last . Looming for Riordan are defining battles over new union contracts , whether private firms should provide some public_services , and a controversial effort to tap into funds going_to a large Department of Water and Power_workers pension_fund . And financing Riordan ' s police buildup could require unpopular cuts_in other services such_as libraries and parks , some officials believe . The outcome will turn_in large part on how effectively the mayor exploits the new chemistry he has fostered , and how he builds_on the initial policy advances he has won . Implementing Riordan ' s core agenda -- curbing street violence , creating jobs and streamlining government -- hinges_on the uncertain willingness of the City_Council to go_along with his initiatives . To that end , Riordan has invested heavily in the politics of schmooze and nurturing personal ties with council_members . In contrast to the often aloof , enigmatic former mayor , Tom Bradley , Riordan has injected a new gregariousness into the City_Hall political equation . He has invited the entire council over to his house for dinner , played golf or ridden mountain_bikes with council_members , and attended public &quot; Meet the Mayor &quot; sessions with them from one end of the city to the other . He calls often and , in a reflection of the new equanimity , sometimes wanders into a council_member ' s office for a chat . &quot; It ' s just my style , &quot; Riordan said . &quot; I ' m comfortable . . . . I ' m learning a lot by talking to them. &quot; When Galanter let it be known that she was &quot; really miffed &quot; with the mayor ' s office a_few months back , three calls came_in quick succession from Riordan and two lieutenants . The issue now escapes her , she said , but not the response . &quot; The mayor ' s operation was very careful to try to repair that , &quot; she said . What all_the attentiveness and political courtesy buys Riordan is unclear . Members have shown a willingness to deal the new mayor embarrassing defeats -- such_as spiking a fund-raising scheme that would have transferred title of the historic Central Library to a tobacco company affiliate . Riordan advisers concede that they still have no natural , reliable council majority . They plan to hunt_down votes one by one , issue by issue . But Riordan Chief_of_Staff William McCarley said he is &quot; optimistic we ' ll be able to generate enough support to get a large part of Riordan ' s program &quot; implemented . Riordan agreed . &quot; Generally , I think the one thing I have going is that virtually all_of the City_Council trusts me. &quot; But with so_much of Riordan ' s financial and City_Hall restructuring plans still unknown , even to top mayoral advisers , others are more cautious . One mayoral adviser privately described the police funding and deficit problems as &quot; the big engine coming_down the tracks at us. &quot; Still , many say Riordan ' s personal demeanor , his political popularity and a general feeling that the city must be moved beyond riots and recession are playing in the mayor ' s favor . &quot; He has people pulling for him because they feel that his success will become their success , &quot; said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky , the city ' s budget expert . &quot; The council feels we have nothing to gain by scoring political points. &quot; Whether he is appearing on national news interview programs or taping an introduction for a sports bloopers television_show , Riordan has reached_out to a varied audience . The 63-year-old millionaire mayor has been a voice of tireless optimism , sometimes expressed in the unpolished manner of a neophyte politician . He also has demonstrated an appetite for unconventional thinking -- science_fiction master Ray Bradbury recently brainstormed with Riordan about transportation and city_planning issues . Some observers say those characteristics have come_through in his public persona and seem to have struck_a_chord with much of the city . &quot; He ' s saying the basic truth : That L.A. is not doomed . . . ( it ' s ) going_to turn_around , &quot; said Joel Kotkin , a senior fellow at the Center for the New West , a public policy think_tank . &quot; He ' s saying it ' s a city with problems , but a city with huge promise. &quot; What has been conspicuously lagging , Kotkin and others say , is a cleareyed scheme for attacking the malignancy of high inner-city unemployment , middle-class job losses and rebuilding an economy battered by defense cuts . &quot; I ' m certainly waiting for the type of jobs he has envisioned for unemployment problems , &quot; said Mark Whitlock , who directs an economic development program associated with the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles . &quot; And I ' d like to see a candid discussion of what the Administration ' s vision is for rebuilding South-Central Los Angeles . &quot; The problem ' s been around for the last 30 years , so I can ' t say six months is too ( long ) . But I don ' t think we can afford to wait another six months. &quot; Riordan said that realistically , economic help for inner-city residents may have to come_in the form of jobs located elsewhere , and transportation improvements to carry workers there . &quot; Those businesses can be anywhere in the city , &quot; he said . &quot; I think somehow RLA and everything concentrated too_much on where the jobs were created , as opposed to the goal of the job. &quot; Some City_Hall and Administration sources say that Riordan was set_back by the rocky tenure of Alfred Villalobos , his deputy mayor for economic development who resigned last month after a series of disclosures about a checkered business past . Riordan aides say it will be weeks before a new economic development czar is in place . But McCarley , the mayor ' s chief_of_staff , denied that Villalobos ' service or departure delayed the mayor ' s economic planning . He said it is unrealistic to expect a full-blown economic development plan so soon . &quot; That is the most difficult , least defined and hardest area to have an impact on , &quot; he said . Riordan said he is leery of producing a huge plan that raises false expectations . &quot; I ' m not a bull artist . When you start talking_about magic_bullets you ' re giving people an impression of doing much more_than you ' re capable of doing . &quot; The Riordan economic program to turn L.A. around is to make_it safe and friendly . Business is going_to go where it ' s in their self-interest to go , &quot; the mayor said . A number of studies are under way to determine how best to leverage state and local federal funding to help small businesses , and how to improve the transportation_system to get the unemployed to areas where jobs are more readily available , McCarley said . Riordan and his aides emphasized that the mayor has made calls to deter individual businesses from leaving Los Angeles , including Packard Bell , a computer company in Chatsworth . George Mihlsten , a prominent Downtown lawyer , said Riordan contacted two of his clients -- whom he declined to identify -- and aides followed up aggressively in an effort to keep the companies and several thousand employees in the city . &quot; For the first time in the history of the city , the mayor ' s office is going_out and aggressively pursuing companies that are thinking_of leaving , &quot; Mihlsten said . &quot; This is a major change for the city of Los Angeles , to begin acting like other cities and competing for employers and jobs. &quot; Riordan has also appointed a new Administration official charged with making_it easier for the film_industry to remain in the city . And a committee of heavyweight developers is drawing_up a plan for reducing paperwork and delays for new construction projects . There have been signs of a new business acumen and agility in the Riordan Administration . They include the much-publicized standoff with the airlines over higher Los Angeles International Airport landing fees , a hard-nosed renegotiation of a huge Alameda Corridor transportation deal and , with unusual speed , putting_together a deal for a new police training and communications facility that will save $ 50 million . In an early , bitter showdown with the airline industry , the Administration won a key legal and political victory that will permit the collection of tens of millions of dollars in new levies . Elsewhere , Riordan and his harbor commissioners tossed_out a previously negotiated , $ 260-million Bradley Administration agreement to purchase Southern Pacific railroad rights_of_way . The rights_of_way are crucial to a huge , harbor to Downtown shipping corridor that will create thousands of jobs and relieve congestion and delays . By December , the purchase_price had been renegotiated to $ 240 million and Riordan estimated that the agreement shaved about $ 80 million off the overall costs faced by the Los Angeles and Long_Beach ports . The full savings is impossible to know until the $ 1.3-billion project is completed , but even Southern Pacific ' s attorney , Tom Houston , grudgingly concedes that the new Administration cut a better deal for itself . The savings were clearer on the recent Police_Academy deal -- the sort of multimillion-dollar opportunity the businessman in Riordan understood . After years spent studying construction of a facility in Sylmar , the LAPD was approached by a young real_estate_agent with a cheap and speedy alternative -- a modern , 14-acre campus-like corporate training facility in Westchester . The LAPD quickly deemed the site ideal , but other bidders were making offers for the complex , and City_Hall ' s lumbering bureaucracy would have to move quickly or the deal could be gone . At the initiation of Galanter , who represents Westchester , Riordan was given unusual negotiating authority by the City_Council and went_into deal-making mode . He called_up the corporate officials who were selling the property to secure the city time to make a bid . Then he reached outside City_Hall to volunteer attorneys and real_estate experts who could quickly analyze and negotiate a deal . Seven days later , city officials were counting up $ 50 million in estimated savings and planning to begin the first_classes at the new facility in a_few months -- more_than two years sooner than once anticipated . Although the $ 13-million Police_Academy deal has been widely applauded , it also highlights a recurring concern about the new Administration . As Riordan relies_on experts in the private sector to help conduct important city business , opportunities for conflicts_of_interest grow and the outer limits of ethics regulations are being tested . There has been no indication of impropriety , but the attorneys and real_estate developer brought_in to the Police_Academy deal were not covered by normal conflict-of-interest disclosure rules for city officials who negotiate such contracts . Political scholar Xandra Kayden , past executive_director of the commission that drafted the city ' s ethics laws , said such arrangements can be beneficial , but also pose risks . &quot; The main priority of government is not to be efficient , &quot; she said . &quot; The main job of government is to be fair . And that ' s where you can ' t be sure when things are moving so quickly. &quot; Riordan advisers say the mayor did what just he was elected to do -- save taxpayers millions of dollars and use his business skills to make government more responsive . &quot; I think this was the mayor at his finest , &quot; McCarley said . &quot; He was experienced . . . he was able to strip away the bureaucratic delays . This was his element. &quot; In Mayor ' s Own Words : A Look_Back and Ahead In an interview Friday with The Times , Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan discussed his first six months in office and what lies ahead . Here are some excerpts : Accomplishments : We ' ve just got an incredible group of people together . And that means both full time plus volunteers who have spent hundreds , sometimes over a 1 # 000 hours , working for the city . The planning , the hard work that has been put_in , the change in culture which is starting to seep through the city . Obviously , Project Safety Los Angeles is a good thing . It ' s the first time , I think , in the United States that anyone has had a long-term strategic plan in making major changes in the Police_Department . Within five years , starting last July 1 , it will increase the number of police in community-based policing and on the streets five times . Budget Battles Ahead : We have to find the money ( for police ) because we absolutely do not have a choice . If you don ' t make the city safe , the tax_base is going_to shrink and you ' ll have less money to do anything . The obvious places to look are some of the proprietary departments , such_as DWP , the airport , harbor , public works in the long_run . You can ' t go much further on some of the libraries ( and ) parks . You can ' t cut them anymore . ( He declined to discuss details of his upcoming budget balancing plan. ) Economic Development : We ' re working with the state and federal_governments , working to set_up community banks , to set_up a bunch of capital pools . We ' re working very closely with the ( federal ) government on setting_up an empowerment zone . By the same token , all those things put_together are just frosting on the cake . People don ' t want to move businesses into a war zone . They don ' t want to be in a city that has been just incredibly unfriendly to business , particularly small business . And that ' s where you are going_to turn this city around economically . Once you have improved the infrastructure for business , it will just pour in here out of self-interest . And ( we must ) build_on our strength : the entertainment_industry . If we could increase the number of pictures produced in L.A. 10 % over the next year , it would be the same as bringing_in several hundred small companies . ( In the ) long_run , you ' re not going_to get major manufacturing operations that are labor intensive into the city of L.A. You need high-tech jobs that are not as labor intensive . A lot of the biomedical , electronics , things like that . Conditions in South-Central Los Angeles : I ' ve tried to step back and say what can we do_better or differently , and the one thing I ' ve come_to a conclusion on is the ultimate goal has got_to be jobs in the inner_city . And the way you get jobs , obviously , is you have business that will hire you . And that business can be anywhere in the city , provided that they are willing to hire people from the inner_city or any place else in the city . I think somehow RLA and everything concentrated too_much on where the jobs were created , as opposed to the goal of the job . First , you have to encourage business to hire people from all parts of the city . Secondly , people have to have access and transportation to and from the jobs , which they don ' t have today in many cases . And third , they have to have the tools to do a good job , such_as a good education , which in many cases they don ' t have . We are working_on all those very hard . I ' ve been_after improved busing . And education , that ' s been my whole life . Sizing Up the Mayor A sampling of views on the performance of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan . &quot; He has had an extraordinarily long honeymoon . In large part that is because people don ' t think he is in it for himself . They see him giving his time . . . to help the city. &quot; -- Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky . * &quot; Everyone accepts that he has had some victories and he is serious about the issue of crime . Now it ' s time to use his honeymoon to accomplish some_other things on economic development and on privatization. &quot; -- Nick Patsaouras , a candidate in last year ' s mayoral primary . * &quot; He has been able to do a better job in a lot of ways with the council than Mike Woo would have . Mike would have brought a lot of history with him and Riordan has been able to say , ' I don ' t have the history , let ' s get going. ' &quot; -- Lawyer and lobbyist Douglas Ring . * &quot; Our community , more_than any other , lives with crime and violence . The fact that public safety is No . 1 on his agenda every day really strikes_a_chord . And his close relationship with ( Police_Chief ) Willie Williams is_well received. &quot; -- African American political consultant Kerman Maddox . * &quot; He has to come_out and articulate a vision of the economic future of Los Angeles . He has not done that yet. &quot; -- USC professor Kevin Starr , a specialist in urban politics and culture .</TEXT>
