   <HEADLINE> OFFBEAT AFRICA ; FOR THOSE WHO ' VE BEEN THERE BEFORE , WHERE TO GO NOW ? HERE , FOUR TRIPS OFF THE BEATEN TOURIST PATHS AND AWAY FROM THE MAIN SAFARI CROSSROADS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Kilimanjaro or Zanzibar ? &quot; asked Keisha , our expedition guide . To climb 19 # 000 feet for five frigid days , lose your meals to altitude_sickness and perhaps not even reach the summit , or to slip_on a sarong for a week of tropical nirvana . I , for one , knew which way the trade_winds blew . Nine adventurers on a trans-Africa trek , we chose Zanzibar , an Afro-Arab island that is part of the East African_country of Tanzania . We were signed_on with Dragoman , an overland tour company out of Suffolk , England , that runs five-week expeditions through the wild lands of eastern and southern Africa several times a year . British traveling companions , Aussies and New Zealanders made_it a lively group ; I was the only American . One of our company , Drew , was a sheep station foreman from Australia . Keisha , a petite Welsh woman raised in Namibia , was a masterful driver , yet the long , dusty drives of our wildlife safaris had us aching for the slow life . The &quot; Who Has the Filthiest Feet ? &quot; contest amuses for only so_long , so we traded_in our khakis and slipped into port at Dar es Salaam , Arabic for &quot; Haven of Peace. &quot; Though Dar es Salaam is the commercial center of Tanzania , and the embarkation point for the 22-mile ferry ride to Zanzibar , it ' s delightfully unspoiled . The ferry itself was our first clue to the mystique of that spice island . We queued_up at the waterfront in Dar with throngs of natives ; women in long , black shrouds or vivid sarongs , men in caftans and gilded , white fezzes . Someone wedged a five-foot , woven cage of live birds between Drew and me . An old_woman chanted a traveling prayer in rapid Swahili . She wrung her spidery , henna-adorned hands as she purred her mantra . Dusk arrived with us as we pulled into the harbor at Zanzibar town , the main city on the 640-square-mile , coral island . The air was warm and thick_with the fragrance of spice . Local &quot; agents &quot; approached , eager to find us hotels , restaurants and transport . I marveled at the rich shades of their mahogany skin . &quot; This way , Mista ! &quot; &quot; Welcome , Madame . Welcome ! &quot; ( Madame being pronounced &quot; Mud ' em. &quot; ) Our man of choice , Mohammed , would prove himself dedicated , albeit unpredictable . Having arrived on the late ferry , 4 1 / 2 hours of standing room only , we learned that there were no vacant rooms left in town . Reassuring us animatedly , Mohammed secured a van and driver , chauffeuring the nine of us to a lively seafood restaurant , the Fisherman , on Shangani Street . Despite the fact that the menu had nothing to do with what was available in the restaurant , it was an enviable feast . We stuffed ourselves greedily with fresh crustaceans , calamari and African beer , while Mohammed worked_out the accommodations . He returned with our van and we were off again , winding through dimly lit Zanzibar streets , too spent to ask where we were going . Finally , Mohammed pulled over to the edge of a deserted beach and announced that we would spend the night on Prison Island . No one said a word as we unloaded our gear and slipped out onto the sand , just a_few titters of nervous laughter . As adventure travelers , we had asked_for this . Closer to the water , two boatmen held a sail-less dhow at_the_ready , the whites of their eyes glistening in their thin faces . They seemed agitated , as if by the thought they might lose the fares they had been promised for ferrying us to our destination . Dhows are among the last sailing_ships making regular runs_on the world ' s seas , and they hold a particular significance in Zanzibar , and her sister island Pemba , as coral_reefs surrounding both islands hinder the passage of cargo_ships . A deep breath , then another , and we handed off our bags and struggled aboard , each finding some dry perch amid the nets and bail buckets . The old motor rumbled to life and we slipped into the mist . Mohammed , gaunt in his gray , tattered caftan , waved us away , a Merlin of that East African sea . About 500 yards from the shore of Prison Island , the dhow suddenly ran_aground . While the boatmen and one of the women in our group hopped overboard and struggled to free it , one of our group began a stream of hysterical gibberish and another simply froze in her seat , silent and petrified . I handed_over the bags , tied my sarong up around my knees and joined the others in the thigh-high water . The coral wasn ' t as sharp as I had feared , but there were plenty of slimy , cold plants and marine creatures to wade through . As I made my way with the others toward the lush island , I saw tiny bungalows lit by oil_lamps and candles . The boatmen vanished . We were prisoners , abandoned on Prison Island . Lights were_on inside the hotel , but no one answered our knocking . I went_around the side and shouted &quot; Jambo ! &quot; the Swahili version of &quot; Aloha , &quot; to the ramshackle cabin in back . Finally , two men hurried out_to us , and we haggled out a rate for five double rooms . To our surprise , the men then started down a path into the dark jungle . &quot; Oh my God , oh my God , oh my God , &quot; moaned Anne -- who was from England -- as we shuffled along the trail , gear in_hand , frequently colliding_with what seemed to be large , round boulders . At last , we arrived_at a row of small bungalows on the edge of the sand . Every star was out . The hotel men slipped_away without a word . Most of the group went directly to bed , easing under their mosquito_nets with relief . Drew and I opted for night tide-pooling instead . Prison Island , also known as Changuu Island , is really just a large , flat , coral hill , so that even at high_tide the surrounding waters are quite shallow . The intertidal zone is a maze of pools , each revealing a unique , self-contained home for sea life -- like little neighborhoods , alive_with creatures that scuffle around together . Multicolored clown fish abound_in the warm waters , as well as sea_anemones , sea_urchins and corals . The next morning , we set_off to explore the island . It takes about half an hour to walk the 1 1 / 4-mile perimeter . Our first discovery was the identity of those boulders from the night before : Giant sea tortoises lay_about the island , which is a sanctuary for wild peacocks as well . There were the abandoned prison , infirmary and guard stations , built_in 1893 , to visit . Zanzibar became an independent Arab state in the 1800s , governed by the Sultan of Oman , who developed Zanzibar town and the clove industry . The island also became the largest slaving entrepot on the east coast , with Arab traders bringing captured slaves from all_over the East African mainland . Prison Island once detained slaves . Originally owned by an Arab trader , the prison later housed hardened criminals and served as a quarantine station . Today , it is a strangely beautiful ruin , tortoises sunning beyond its walls . Arab doorways , still standing , frame the occasional , lateen-sailed dhow sailing elegantly by . A revolt by Africans in 1964 overthrew the Arab ruling_class on Zanzibar , and later that year Tanganyika and Zanzibar joined , forming the new country of Tanzania . But even today , the Africans of Zanzibar remain vastly underprivileged compared to the colonial Arab and Indo-Pakistani immigrant communities on the island . In the afternoon we left Prison Island for Zanzibar town , where Mohammed greeted us as promised . When told about our dhow running_aground , his eyes rolled skyward as he exclaimed , &quot; Praise be to Allah ! The Great One has saved your lives ! &quot; We took that to mean that Mohammed and his cohorts felt that they were not to blame . Back at the minibus , we rushed_off again , this time to separate hotels , men in one , women in another . The women ' s accommodations were of the standard , somewhat primitive caliber found in Zanzibar town , but with the allure of a candy shop downstairs , and a friendly dwarf , Harry , who washed our clothes to within an inch of their lives . Later , on our way to the night market , Zanzibar town was a labyrinth : dark alley to ancient Arab palace to lonely beach littered with parchment-colored dhows . Evenings here mean communing . The townspeople are out visiting , or basking on_their_own front steps , children racing through the corridors . We came_upon a group of men , leaning their chairs back against the wall outside a tiny shop front , laughing and talking on into the wee hours . The glow of hundreds of creamy white candles lured us to the Jamituri Gardens at the waterfront near the old &quot; Arab &quot; fort , a massive , crenelated structure built by the Portuguese . We tried smoked octopus , spicy vegetables , beef satay , curries and cassava . Sugar_cane nectar , pressed from the stalk through an antique clothes wringer , is surprisingly light and fresh-tasting . Local musicians supply the entertainment . This luscious repast is overshadowed only by the people-watching -- the night market is a rendezvous for friends , a special family outing , a shadowy , romantic tryst for couples . The next morning , we took a tour through the spice plantations in a cool , open-air van , our guides introducing us to hundreds of spices and fruits . We wandered among cherimoya , plumeria , litchi , and jasmine trees . Zanzibar was once the world ' s largest producer of cloves . The clove plantations sport ancient sorting machinery , mound after mound of fresh harvest drying in the sun and balmy breezes . We continued on to the Marahubi Palace , once the home of the Sultans of Oman and their harems . The palace is a maze of ruined chambers , baths and outdoor &quot; pleasure ponds , &quot; which prompted visions of decadence . Thick jungle scenery punctuated the morning . Women sauntered slowly down the dirt roads , huge baskets of fruit and spice wrapped onto their heads with the same wild fabrics used for their sarongs . I spied a woman enjoying the shade of her lanai . She rocked her dozing baby in a hand-tied sling beneath a frangipani tree . With a slow smile , she let me take her photo , but covered her angelic child as I moved closer . Arrangements were made ( Mohammed again ) to move_on to Zanzibar ' s stunning east coast . We would stay_at an all-but-deserted beach , near a tiny village . Our bungalows at the Bwejuu Dere Guest House were tranquil , to say the least , with their whitest-white adobe walls and doorways of periwinkle , yellow , pink and coral . The bedrooms were simply furnished with bamboo-and-palm-leaf beds laden with cotton mattresses and crowned with the familiar mist of mosquito_nets . I wondered why the proprietor was moving so slowly when we arrived . But our own pace became as timeless as we slipped into swimsuits and crossed the 15 feet to the beach , pausing only to utter &quot; lobster , &quot; our dinner request . Finally , we lay_down in the sand , warm water licking our toes . Occasionally , a villager ambled by to offer a fresh-cut coconut or a sarongful of shells no more beautiful than the ones all around us . One afternoon , I walked_off alone to explore the village , wearing a swimsuit and sandals . Among the huts were small gatherings of women of varying ages , reclining on palm-shaded lanais . They were amicable , despite our language_barrier , yet I could see that they were shocked at my bare legs . At their invitation , I stopped to sit with one group , and struggled to communicate with my bare-bones Swahili . Chattering faintly , an old_woman made her way over to me , untied one of two sarongs she wore , and wrapped it around my hips . The other women cooed their approval ; with that , I knew I had been initiated . Each woman summoned her own children so that I could take their photos , and we prattled on through the afternoon , shelling coconuts . Sailing away from Zanzibar a_few days later was downright mournful . What was it that called us to that spice island ? The architecture , the culture , the beaches ? The rich traditions that prevail here are protected by the blessing of the island ' s geographic elusiveness . Zanzibar remains a seductive capsule of time that spans centuries and surpasses expectation . Praise be to Allah .
