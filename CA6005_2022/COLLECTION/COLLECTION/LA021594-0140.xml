   <HEADLINE> TRADE WAR FEARS SEND DOLLAR PLUNGING ; MARKETS : U.S. CURRENCY DROPS TO NEARLY SIX-MONTH LOWS AGAINST THE YEN , SENDING JAPANESE STOCKS INTO A TAILSPIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S.-Japan trade rift sent the dollar plunging to nearly six-month lows against the yen Monday , pummeling Japanese stocks and pulling other Asian markets down as well . The dollar ' s slump , and Asian markets ' slide , continued early today , as investors feared a damaging trade war could erupt between the two countries . Tokyo ' s Nikkei stock index , which slid 531.45 points to 19 # 459.25 on Monday , was off 501.95 points or 2.6 % to 18 # 957.30 at midday today . Meanwhile , the U.S. stock_market shrugged_off the concerns , closing mixed Monday . Long-term U.S. bond yields rose modestly , while gold gained . In New York , the dollar closed at 102.65 yen on Monday , a drop of 4.2 % from 107.20 on Friday , as traders reacted to the weekend collapse of trade talks between President Clinton and Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa . Clinton had sought numerical targets for trade_in the fight to open what the United States contends are unfairly sheltered Japanese markets . But Hosokawa balked . Clinton ' s tough talk after the trade summit immediately raised fears of unilateral trade sanctions against Japan . Also , some analysts believe the United States now will encourage a stronger yen and weaker dollar in an effort to instantly cheapen prices of U.S. goods sold in Japan . Hence , currency traders quickly knocked the dollar down on Monday . It traded at one point at 101.00 yen , a_level not seen since Aug . 17 , the day the dollar hit a post-World II low of 100.40 yen . Early today in Tokyo the dollar traded just above 102 yen , before Japan ' s central_bank intervened to stabilize the currency . Meanwhile , the Tokyo stock_market ' s tumble reflected investor worries that the yen ' s soaring value will crimp Japanese exports , by automatically raising their prices here and elsewhere abroad . Fears of a trade war also weighed_on other Asian markets , most of which are export economies . Hong Kong ' s Hang Seng stock index sank 515.22 points , or 4.5 % , to 10 # 988.81 on Monday , though analysts said worries about rising interest_rates also hit Hong Kong shares . At midday today the Hang Seng was off 50.75 points to 10 # 938.06. South_Korea ' s main stock index dropped 15.77 points to 901.38 on Monday and was off 2.08 points early today . On Monday , the President Clinton refused to rule_out a possible all-out trade war with Japan , although he said he would take &quot; some days &quot; to mull the full range of options before imposing sanctions on Tokyo . * Meanwhile , the U.S. stock_market ended mixed in choppy trading Monday . The Dow Jones industrial index added 9.28 points to 3 # 904.06 , and advancing issues narrowly outnumbered declines on the New York Stock_Exchange . Also , smaller stocks gained_ground , with the Nasdaq composite index up 4.06 points to 785.45. But some broader indexes , such_as the NYSE composite , were marginally lower . Big Board volume came_to a moderate 263.2 million shares . Though the market had a generally calm reaction to the dollar ' s plunge , traders noted that the Dow was up more_than 25 points early in the day , a gain that evaporated as the dollar ' s decline intensified . Losses in most European markets overnight , in addition to the slump in Asian stocks , weighed_on U.S. investors . Still , analysts noted that a falling dollar was bullish for U.S. exporters and for auto_makers and other industrial companies that compete head-on with the Japanese . &quot; In the end it ' s going_to allow them to penetrate the Japanese market more , and in the short-term it benefits them because they become more competitive , &quot; said Patrick Moriarty , chief investment officer at Bank Julius Baer . Among the market highlights : * Auto stocks rose . Chrysler gained 3 / 4 to 59 3 / 4 , Ford added 1 / 4 to 65 3 / 4 and GM was up 5 / 8 to 61 3 / 4 . * Other industrial winners included Whirlpool , up 2 1 / 2 to 70 1 / 2 ; Boeing , up 1 to 44 5 / 8 ; GE , up 7 / 8 to 108 1 / 8 ; and United Technologies , up 2 to 67 3 / 8 . * Rebounding tech stocks included Adobe Systems , up 1 1 / 8 to 30 ; Sun Microsystems , up 1 3 / 4 to 26 1 / 2 ; Lotus Development , up 2 1 / 2 to 58 1 / 4 ; and Newbridge Networks , up 1 5 / 8 to 64 3 / 4 . * Pfizer fell 1 1 / 8 to 58 1 / 4 on reports the drug giant is trying to forge a strategic alliance with foreign rival Glaxo . Glaxo ' s NYSE-traded shares gained 1 / 4 to 19 . * QVC Network gained 1 5 / 8 to 48 1 / 2 amid speculation that rival Viacom had won the protracted bidding war for Paramount Communications . Viacom class A fell 1 5 / 8 to 34 7 / 8 , and Viacom class B dropped 1 3 / 4 to 29 7 / 8 . Paramount fell 3 / 4 to 76 1 / 8 . * WMX Technologies gained 1 / 8 to 24 7 / 8 after prosecutors in California said they would n ' t appeal a decision last week dismissing theft charges against a WMX Technologies unit and eight employees . * Iwerks Entertainment shot_up 2 1 / 4 to 25 . The Burbank-bases special-effects firm said it will build a series of specialty theaters for a chain of family complexes owned by Blockbuster Entertainment . * Telmex gained 7 / 8 to 73 7 / 8 on the NYSE , even though the Mexican stock_market closed lower again . The Mexico_City stock_exchange ' s Bolsa index fell 23.23 points to 2 # 778.83. Other Markets Long-term Treasury_bond yields rose slightly on muted fears that the dollar ' s plunge against the Japanese yen would prompt Japanese investors to sell U.S. bonds . The 30-year T-bond ' s yield rose to 6.45 % from 6.40 % on Friday . But yields on shorter-term securities barely budged . Prospects for a weakening dollar sparked fears that Japanese investors would dump dollar-denominated securities -- especially bonds -- to cut exchange_rate losses . When the dollar falls against the yen it automatically erodes the value of U.S. securities owned by Japanese . But analysts said there was little indication that Japanese investors were selling_off their holdings of Treasury securities . A report from the Federal_Reserve_Bank of Atlanta on regional economic_conditions also prompted some bond selling , Chan said . The survey showed a surge in production by manufacturers who expected to raise prices in January . While regional in scope , the report was viewed_as an indicator of national business conditions and may have focused attention on the timing of the Federal_Reserve ' s next move to raise short-term interest_rates , Chan said . In other markets : * Gold gained $ 3.90 to $ 383.90 an ounce on the New York Comex , while silver rose 9.5 cents to $ 5.34. Traders noted that a falling dollar raises the risk of higher import prices , which could boost inflation , thus increasing precious-metals ' attractiveness . * Warming sunshine spread from the East Coast to the Midwest Monday , pushing March crude_oil futures down 59 cents to a seven-week low of $ 14.13 a barrel .</TEXT>
