   <HEADLINE> STATE SMOG PLAN OFFERED ; WILSON ASKS COST STUDY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Pete Wilson has requested an economic analysis that could delay a sweeping new plan crafted by his air quality staff to clean_up California ' s smog by reducing emissions from cars , diesel trucks , consumer products , pesticides and other pollution sources . The proposed clean air plan , which began arriving Monday on the desks of business_leaders , environmentalists and local officials , is the vision of the state Air Resources Board ' s staff on how California would meet a federal mandate to reduce smog from San Diego to Sacramento over the next 15 years . Debate over the highly charged clean air issue was scheduled to climax in the final days before California voters cast their ballots for governor . The air board set its public hearing and vote on the plan for Nov . 9 and 10 -- immediately after the election -- in_order to comply with a Nov . 15 deadline set by Congress . But Wilson intervened after receiving a written_copy of the plan by urging the board ' s chairwoman to order a full economic report on the proposals -- even if it means California will miss Congress ' deadline . The clean air plan &quot; absolutely must be subjected_to an independent , outside economic analysis , &quot; the governor wrote in a letter to ARB Chairwoman Jacqueline Schafer dated Saturday . &quot; The hard-working men and women of California -- whose jobs are_on the line -- deserve nothing less . &quot; I realize that undertaking a thorough economic review may cause a slight delay in delivering a complete ( plan ) to the federal_government by Nov . 15 , &quot; he wrote , adding : &quot; It is essential that you take the time necessary to assure that our state air plan not only protects California ' s public health and air quality but also protects California jobs. &quot; Wilson ' s request came_after more_than 100 business_organizations in California , including the state Chamber_of_Commerce and the Western States Petroleum Assn. , called_for his Administration to analyze the cost and job impact of the staff ' s proposals as well as alternatives . Under the federal Clean Air Act passed_by Congress in 1990 , California must submit an approved smog plan by Nov . 15 or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is required to start the process of imposing economic sanctions , including a freeze on federal highway funds disbursed to the state . In reality , the EPA has until mid-January to reply and sanctions would take a year or longer to go_into effect . Some environmentalists were concerned Monday when they learned of Wilson ' s request from The Times because the ARB staff has been working_on the plan for months . &quot; It is very disturbing when the executive of the state with the worst air quality in the nation is asking his air quality staff to delay compliance with federal air quality law , &quot; said Cliff Gladstein , president of the Coalition for Clean Air , based in Santa Monica . &quot; It seems to reflect a pattern on his part . All this past year he has been willing to put_off creating sound air quality policy in_order to avoid deadlines . It is troubling. &quot; Gladstein said requiring economic assessments is &quot; part and parcel of the anti-environmental movement ' s strategy to undermine environmental laws. &quot; The vote , he said , was &quot; conveniently placed &quot; after the election , adding that improved air quality is being &quot; held hostage by statewide politics. &quot; California business_leaders , however , expressed concern about what they called the &quot; fast-track &quot; schedule of the air board because details of the plan were not available to most businesses until Monday . &quot; Thirty days and one public hearing on a plan that will dictate how my company operates in California for the next 15 years is ridiculous , &quot; Walt Keeney , president of Flour Transport , based in Maywood , said in a statement . The ARB staff estimates that the costs of state-imposed proposals would reach $ 1.1 billion a year statewide . That does not include additional costly rules that would be imposed by local air districts or the federal_government . In the Los Angeles Basin alone , the South Coast Air Quality Management District estimated the cost of smog cleanup regulations at over $ 5 billion a year , much of that for modifying the Southland ' s transportation_system . All sides agree that a state-designed air plan is crucial since it would relieve California of even-stricter requirements proposed by the Clinton_Administration ' s EPA . Wilson called the federal plan &quot; irresponsible and devastating. &quot; But the ARB staff ' s proposed alternative drew criticism from environmentalists , who wanted quicker implementation and more stringent rules , and from business_leaders , who called it unrealistically stringent . Included in the ARB staff proposals is a more aggressive mandate for California cars to run_on alternative fuels , a reduction in fumes from aerosol paints and other consumer products such_as deodorants and beauty supplies , and scrapping programs and financial incentives for removing old vehicles from the roads . The ARB staff also proposes a controversial mandate to slash emissions from California-based diesel trucks in half by 2002 , a standard that would probably force use of alternative fuels , and urges the federal_government to impose the same limits nationwide by 2004 . The staff says national standards &quot; are essential &quot; because such sources as out-of state trucks would be exempt and California-only rules could trigger unfair business competition between cities . Dave Titus of the California Trucking Assn . said Monday that truckers are opposed to the ARB staff ' s approach of imposing rules on California trucks two years earlier than nationwide . He said truckers also believe that the standard is too stringent to be workable . &quot; Anything that does not have uniformity nationwide is going_to be a concern to the trucking_industry , &quot; Titus said . &quot; We like the concept of a national standard that puts all California trucking_industry on an equal footing with their counterparts in other parts of the nation . What is left to be worked_out is what standard is workable. &quot; Environmentalists , however , say awaiting a national rule from the U.S. EPA could delay cleanup of pollutants from diesel_engines for many years . The ARB proposal also contains no plan for tackling the ubiquitous problem of solo commuters . Instead , the agency proposes to study basing vehicle registration fees on the amount of emissions from the car or miles driven , as well as ideas that would penalize drivers who use roads during rush_hours . The plan looks_to the federal_government for substantial help in some areas . For aircraft , trains , farm and construction equipment and recreational boats , the ARB staff recommends national regulations since those sources come under the jurisdiction of the EPA . Also included in the state plan is a list of about 100 proposed measures approved last month by the Los Angeles region ' s AQMD that mostly tackle industrial sources of smog . Environmentalists called the state ' s proposal vague and weak . &quot; It is disappointing , &quot; Gladstein said Monday . &quot; The emissions reductions they describe are not sufficient to achieve clean air . . . . This document is a little weak in what ( ARB ) can do itself and tries to push off some of that responsibility to the federal government. &quot; In particular , environmentalists called the diesel truck proposals disappointing , saying the state should go much further and move more quickly in mandating use of cleaner technologies . Stringent rules for trucks , trains and other interstate transportation sources have been one of the most controversial parts of California clean air plans since they are costly , and technology to replace traditional diesel_fuel with alternative fuels is largely untested . The state plan is designed to meet all_of California ' s requirements for cleaning_up ozone , the colorless , lung-scarring main ingredient of smog . Six areas of California fail to meet health standards for ozone , with the worst air , by far , in the basin composed of Los Angeles and Orange counties and parts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties . The Los Angeles Basin under the federal Clean Air Act has until 2010 to clean_up ozone . The deadline is 1999 for the San Joaquin Valley and 2005 for Ventura County , the southeast desert area , San Diego and the Sacramento metropolitan area . Key to the future of the state ' s clean air efforts is whether its plan would meet the approval of the U.S. EPA and eliminate the need for the federal version . The federal agency was forced to propose its own clean air plan in February for the Los Angeles Basin , Ventura County and Sacramento after losing a lawsuit with environmentalists , who sued to force the EPA to take_over in California . The federal plan has triggered vehement opposition from business groups and local and state elected officials , largely over unprecedented proposals to regulate airlines , ports , trains and diesel trucks . The EPA then challenged the state to come_up with a better plan to replace it .</TEXT>
