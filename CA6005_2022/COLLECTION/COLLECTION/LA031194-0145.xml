   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; JAPANESE LEARNING TO JUST SAY NO ; BUCKING A TRADITION OF AMBIGUITY , PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MORE DEFINITIVELY DISAGREE -- AT_HOME AND AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The year was 1969 . President Richard Nixon asked Prime_Minister Eisaku Sato to impose quotas on textile exports in exchange for the return of Okinawa . Sato used a notoriously ambiguous phrase -- &quot; Zensho shimasu &quot; -- which can be translated as &quot; I ' ll take a proper step , &quot; or &quot; I ' ll take a favorable action , &quot; but often means rejection . Sato later denied promising quotas , and Nixon spent more_than two years bludgeoning Japan into accepting them . The incident severely damaged U.S.-Japan relations . The Japanese reluctance to give a clear , definitive no has confused countless other foreigners and snarled international interactions , from casual chats to trade talks . The ambiguity of the Japanese no is so famous that President Clinton , at a dinner last year in Vancouver , Canada , with Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , scribbled this advice to him : &quot; When the Japanese say yes , they mean no. &quot; But times are changing . Five years after flamboyant legislator Shintaro Ishihara urged his nation to stand_up to Washington in his controversial book , &quot; The Japan That Can Say No , &quot; Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa did just that by resoundingly rejecting U.S. demands for measurable trade targets in his recent summit_meeting with Clinton in Washington . There was no hemming or hawing in the language Japanese negotiators used to reject the proposed targets . They said , &quot; Totei doi dekimasen , &quot; or &quot; There is no way I can agree with that , &quot; according to translator Mariko Nagai , who has worked_on dozens of U.S.-Japan trade negotiations . &quot; I was a bit scared about interpreting it , because the language was so clear , &quot; Nagai said . She said she has seen a trend toward sharper language among Japanese negotiators in recent years . Hosokawa ' s definitive no to Clinton , widely applauded here as a sign of Japan ' s coming of_age , symbolizes a shift away from the soft , indirect_expressions that Japanese have long used to maintain harmony and save face with one another . As contact with foreigners increases and the tradition that frowns_on direct expression weakens , more Japanese are learning to speak more clearly and daring to disagree -- in daily life as well as in the international arena . Assertiveness seminars and debate training are being imported from the West and gaining popularity -- especially among women . Debating skills are being formally promoted in the classroom for the first time by the Ministry of Education , whose centralized curricula have focused_on rote memorization rather than on self-expression . Consumers are being encouraged to say no to high prices and sales pressure tactics . One Tokyo consumer service center has launched a campaign to promote &quot; the courage to say no &quot; to salespeople . The mass media are weighing in with such articles as &quot; Become an Employee Who Can Say NO. &quot; &quot; The yesman is being weeded_out , &quot; declared Spa , a trendy men ' s magazine . &quot; . . . If you can ' t clearly communicate your will , you won ' t win in business. &quot; Such blunt advice bucks centuries of communication techniques designed to soften denials with subtlety and understatement , by providing hints and relying_on the other person to intuitively fathom the real meaning . ( Certainly , blunt speech has always existed in Japan -- clear orders by the boss to the underling , or many husbands to their wives , for example . But to casual friends and other acquaintances , Japanese have often spoken obliquely. ) No one knows why such subtleties of speech developed . The prevailing theory is that they sprang from a need for people to get_along in this crowded island nation . Another common explanation is the Confucian system of hierarchical human relations , which makes_it difficult for subordinates to say no not only in Japan but also in such countries as Korea . Kikuo Nomoto , a Japanese language expert , said the nation ' s long history of repressive rule , from the feudalism of the Tokugawa Shogunate to the militarism of the early to mid-1900s , also stifled expression . &quot; The feudal government did not permit criticism , so people developed techniques to hide their real feelings , &quot; Nomoto said . The influence of politics on expression is particularly apparent in the Kyoto area , experts say . Some Kyoto phrases carry completely different meanings from their surface appearance . To be asked to stay for dinner , for instance , actually means &quot; Please go home. &quot; Many Tokyoites say Kyoto expressions are the most difficult to understand in all_of Japan . Kyoto Women ' s University Prof . Kazumasa Hoshino explained that Kyoto was the seat of government and center of imperial rule for more_than 1 # 000 years . To protect themselves from the many changes of government and to avoid making enemies , people learned to cloak their language in niceties and used extreme caution in admitting people into their inner_circles , he said . Even today , many first-class restaurants in Kyoto won ' t serve first-time visitors without an introduction from a regular customer . The unwitting visitor will merely be told that all seats are filled . The most provocative theory about the reluctance to say no comes from Yoshimi Ishikawa , a novelist and social commentator . He says many Japanese avoid giving a clear yes and no because they lack certain absolute_values . &quot; Westerners have . . . the law of the Bible . In Japan , our god has been our emperor , who has never given us any absolute laws . All he says is , ' Ah , so ? ' ( ' Is that so ? ' ) &quot; When our absolute_value is ' Ah so , ' how can we say yes or no ? &quot; Ishikawa said . Such patterns of communication will not be transformed overnight . But sheer necessity is fostering some change . Nori Shikata learned to say no as a high_school exchange student with a Midwestern farm family in the early 1980s . Before going_to the United States , he was told that saying no clearly -- declining a party invitation , for instance -- would avoid misunderstandings and not offend Americans . Shikata , who went_on to become a bureaucrat , said directness was the most difficult thing he had to learn in the United States . But now he can state his views on any number of issues -- and Japan is producing more people like him . The number of exchange students going abroad grew to 185 # 888 in 1990 from 23 # 149 in 1980 . Exchange students return to Japan with a remarkable ability to speak their minds , said Junko Kawano of the AFS Japan Assn . exchange program . Although they have to readjust to Japanese society , causing initial hardship , the end result is that more people can maneuver in both foreign and Japanese situations . Training in debate is not limited to those who go overseas . On a recent morning at the Ichikawa City Elementary School in the Tokyo suburb of Chiba , the second-grade class of Junko Sakuma took an adventure in the art of debate with this topic : Do dogs or cats make better pets ? Forget about tiptoeing around another person ' s feelings . The verbal jousting was fierce , said a recent account in Aera magazine . The cat side : &quot; Cats have fluffy fur and are cute. &quot; The dog side : &quot; But not all cats are fluffy ! &quot; The cat side : &quot; Dogs bark and make a racket. &quot; The dog side : &quot; But if you train them , they ' ll be OK ! &quot; Such classroom debates are spreading , thanks to the Ministry of Education ' s new directive to encourage self-expression and foster debate skills . Teachers were first instructed to place priority on speaking skills in a 1989 ministry directive : &quot; In this era of internationalization , it is necessary for children to express their own ideas themselves and communicate them to others. &quot; In 1992 , newly issued sixth-grade textbooks contained the first-ever instruction in rhetorical skills : a lesson called &quot; Let ' s Debate ! &quot; Beginning next month , high_school students will be able to fulfill an oral_communication requirement with a debate class . More universities too are using debate as a teaching technique . Keio University Prof . Atsushi Kusano , who employs it in his class on modern Japanese politics , said more people are becoming accustomed to debate through Western news_shows beamed here , such_as the &quot; MacNeil / Lehrer NewsHour &quot; and Cable News Network . He also said people are becoming frustrated with the government ' s reliance on foreign pressure to enact domestic changes and want to debate the issues and decide their policies for themselves . That attitude is exemplified by politicians such_as Ichiro Ozawa , one of the key leaders of the Hosokawa coalition government . In business as well , debate and assertiveness_training are gaining converts . Tsutomu Hamaoka , a manager for the Fuji Photo Film Co. , began teaching debate skills to his department last year . Hamaoka said the exercises of tallying up pros versus cons , or using a devil ' s advocate to provoke deeper thought , may seem routine to Westerners but is radical stuff to many Japanese . Many decisions rely more on &quot; feeling &quot; or &quot; intuition &quot; than hardheaded logic , he said . Although Westerners are able to separate attacks on their ideas from attacks on them personally , Japanese find that difficult and thus shun confrontation , he said . &quot; There is no cultural parallel to the_devil ' s advocate in Japan , &quot; said Michihiro Matsumoto , president of the Management Development Institute , which sponsors debate training seminars . &quot; Japanese feel that if you disagree_with their theories , you are disagreeing_with their personalities. &quot; To overcome that feeling , debate trainees are told they are merely playing a role unrelated to their true selves . Assertiveness_training is perhaps even more subversive than are debate lessons . Self-assertion has long been frowned_upon as selfish -- and American -- in a society that requires conformism . Now such seminars are in_demand by everyone from homemakers to corporate managers , said Noriko Hiraki , a social_science professor at Japan Women ' s University . She runs seminars privately and for the Psycho Technology Institute of Japan , which has tripled the number of seminars and doubled the size of classes since its first workshop 10 years ago but still has waiting lists . Ten years ago , many of her clients wanted to learn assertiveness because they were being transferred abroad . Nowadays , she said , most of the demand is for teaching Japanese to speak more assertively to other Japanese . Hiraki said the old form of ishin denshin , or tacit communication , in which both sides know what the other means without being direct , is breaking_down . Managers are also feeling a growing generation gap with younger people , who are less intimidated by seniority . &quot; Nowadays , if you ask your young staff_members to go_out for a drink after work , they ' ll say they have other plans , &quot; said Fuji ' s Hamaoka , 53 . &quot; When I started_out 30 years ago , we would change our plans. &quot; Nomoto , the language specialist , said young people are losing the ability to understand established code phrases for no -- such_as &quot; I ' ll think_about it. &quot; &quot; They come_back a week later and ask if you ' ve thought_about it , &quot; he said . Shinobu Omiya , a 30-year-old office worker for a publishing_firm , said her generation still ponders excuses before saying no but doesn ' t really seem to need the crutch anymore . But some say this is more a product of bad manners than of increased self-confidence . Women are the most conspicuous recruits in the move to learn to say no . Hiraki said 70 % of her students are female . At one Keio University debate last year , all_the captains of the 10 debate teams in Kusano ' s class were women . For women conditioned to just say yes , Hiraki ' s lessons have brought small but significant triumphs : the homemaker who said no to a persistent newspaper salesperson for the first time in her life ; the woman who finally declined a friend ' s invitation to eat_at a restaurant she didn ' t enjoy ; the wife who told her husband she really wanted to take a bath when he called_for a ride . Nozomi Yokoyama , 28 , and Kazuko Oura , 26 , recently took debate lessons . Learning the skills of cool , objective analysis will help their careers , they said . Arata Sato , a Keio University_student in environmental studies , said Japanese will continue to speak more softly than Westerners but that the era of compliance and unvoiced opinions is ending . &quot; More women want to continue work after marriage or having children , and we have to debate this with our husbands and bosses , &quot; she said . &quot; Unless we have our own clear way of thinking and can explain it skillfully , we won ' t be persuasive. &quot; Researcher Megumi Shimizu of The Times ' Tokyo Bureau contributed to this report . Some Hidden Meanings Different responses in Japanese and what they really mean : PHRASE : Kekko desu . LITERAL MEANING : I ' m fine . OFTEN MEANS : No , thank_you . ( I ' ve had enough. ) or I ' d love some more . Please ask me again . PHRASE : Kangaete okimasu . LITERAL MEANING : I ' ll think_about it . OFTEN MEANS : Don ' t hold your breath PHRASE : Muzukashii desu ne . LITERAL MEANING : It is difficult to do that . OFTEN MEANS : It ' s impossible . PHRASE : Doryoku shimasu . LITERAL MEANING : I ' ll try OFTEN MEANS : Forget it . PHRASE : Zensho shimasu . LITERAL MEANING : I ' ll take a proper step . OFTEN MEANS : I won ' have anything to do with that anymore .</TEXT>
