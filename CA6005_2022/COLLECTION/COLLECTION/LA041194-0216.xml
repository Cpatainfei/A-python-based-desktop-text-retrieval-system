   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE ; WEAK ON GEOGRAPHY ? TRY MAPPING IT OUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cellular One , a Bay Area mobile communications company , had lots of customers and plenty of capacity . The one thing it didn ' t have was a way to match the two . As a result , some customers got cut_off in mid- sentence , while others struggled with inferior connections . That was before Cellular One embraced Geographic Information_Systems , a way of linking geography with non-geographic information . GIS lets users see business data such_as sales , phone_calls and store locations on a map , juxtaposing that information with , say , demographic data . Business decisions that once required reams of statistical_tables and a healthy dose of imagination are laid_out visually . With the installation of a GIS-based network management center in Santa Clara last fall , Cellular One was suddenly able to deploy its cloud of cellular coverage where customers were actually making the calls , delivering better service while making more efficient use of its resources . Once restricted to big companies with access to mainframe computing power , GISnowadays is spreading like wildfire , thanks to the growing power of desktop_computers and to innovations in GIS software . The falling price of desktop-based GIS programs -- nearly 70 % during the past three years -- is leading to a revolution in the analysis and display of business data . Cellular One is far from the only business using this powerful tool to answer the question : Where are the customers ? Kodak , Arco and Coldwell Banker are a_few of the many large corporations that use it to find market niches , place new stores , assess ZIP-code demographics for direct mailings , dispatch repair teams and even analyze power-consumption data within a building . Small businesses can use GIS too , although this segment is often called &quot; desktop mapping. &quot; Sales of PC-based software in this genre grew 24 % in 1992 , and an estimated 37 % in 1993 , when they reached $ 115 million , according to Daratech , a Cambridge-based market research company . In February , MapInfo -- the largest vendor of desktop mapping software -- went public . Older companies with mainframe products are entering the desktop market , and new companies have brought_out new GIS products in the last few months . With the decline in computer prices and increase in their speed and power , GIS solutions are already within reach of even a small company . Three years ago , a mapping software cost upward of $ 10 # 000 , according to Daratech ; now a desktop installation is around $ 3 # 000 . Within the last year , smaller companies such_as Scan / US have brought_out Windows-based geomarket analysis packages for less than $ 1 # 000 . Daratech assesses the &quot; core market &quot; -- GIS software , hardware sold by vendors and support service -- at $ 953 million in 1993 . But including all data , technical support , hardware and software , companies spent $ 5.5 billion on GIS technologies . A primary use of GIS is in site selection . Ken Green , senior analyst in_charge of volume prediction at Arco , uses it to decide where to buy land for new Arco stations and AM / PM outlets . In the past , Arco would have turned_to a demographic analyst for a market study of a location , but now Green can simply highlight a possible venue with his mouse and show the roadways , traffic_patterns and existing Arco stations . In making real_estate decisions , Green knows that downtown Los Angeles has more potential gasoline customers , but the question is , as he puts it , &quot; is eastern Washington going_to have a higher yield given what we pay_for the land ? With mapping software I am able to show how many potential customers are within a two-mile ring , or I can show the effects of a freeway . &quot; Another market project we used the software for involved a change in our beverage contract with Coke to a setup that included both Coke and Pepsi . &quot; There was reason to believe that installation of new , larger machines that included both Coke and Pepsi would result in a significant increase in sales , but we could not install the machines everywhere at once . I worked with the marketing department and used GIS software to create a map of the counties with the highest drink sales . That set the agenda for the program. &quot; Coldwell Banker used GIS &quot; for one client in Phoenix where the market demographics within two miles of each store were considered critical , &quot; said Celeste Cummings , a senior systems analyst for the firm . &quot; GIS allowed us to determine which stores were pulling from the same market , in a sense cannibalizing customers from each other . This allowed the client to decide which stores to close and where to open new ones. &quot; GIS-based analysis offers the clarity of a map display and the deeper understanding of geographic and spatial analysis . At Coldwell Banker , this means that instead of handing a voluminous text-based report to a client , agents are able to become more involved_with the analysis . &quot; When the data appears on a map , it is easy to see where you ' ve got holes , &quot; said Cummings . &quot; The weak_spots just jump_out at you. &quot; Often , the geographically linked information changes the potential product market . Todd Schwartzrock , director of marketing for Revere National Corp. , a billboard concern , finds that his new mapping system is pointing to new clients who were previously not approached . Although outdoor advertising has long used lifestyle data to place billboards , Revere uses the mapping software in conjunction with a traffic engineering firm that tracks license_plates of cars passing its billboards . The results are target-marketing as a science . In the past , Schwartzrock ' s pitch to a client would have involved some generalizations about who the ad would appeal_to and what sorts of viewers might see the billboard . Now he can say with confidence who passes that location , where they live and what sort of buying patterns that neighborhood has . &quot; It affects the kinds of clients we actually approach in the use of our media , &quot; Schwartzrock said . &quot; We are moving away from the traditional use -- alcohol and tobacco -- and toward retail , entertainment , and packaged goods . MapInfo allows us to do this with more_than just intuitive claims. &quot; Targeting specific neighborhoods was the interest that launched a relationship between the Southern Baptist Sunday_School Board and Los Angeles-based mapping firm Scan / US . The Sunday_School Board -- which manages over $ 250 million a year in revenue -- is the world ' s largest Protestant religious publisher , with over 38 # 000 churches in its conventions . Working with Scan / US , it built the Southern Baptist Data Consortium , which adds demographic data and the locations of churches and congregations to maps . &quot; GIS helps the churches understand how the community has changed and what they can do to reach the community , &quot; said Earl Nobels , director of the Sunday_School Board . &quot; As urban systems spread_out tentacles -- highways -- housing usually follows . The core of the city will then lose population , and racial and ethnic changes will follow . So you may have a church that has been there for 25 years , now battling to survive . It has to serve a whole different group of people. &quot; GIS has enabled some congregations to make the tough choices necessary to survive . One predominantly white church in a major metropolitan area saw its congregation shrink_from 1 # 500 to fewer than 100 . In the same community was a black church that was pressed for space . Nobels conducted an analysis with Scan / US to show where the religious communities were located , and armed with this information , the white church decided to donate its facilities to the black church . The daily diet of tough decisions at the Federal Emergency Management Agency made GIS a natural . FEMA started using the MapInfo program after Hurricane Andrew touched_down in 1992 . The agency was facing 240 square_miles of devastation with no street_signs and damaged roadways . &quot; We set_up a raw street grid and then added_to it whatever visual markers existed , &quot; explained Tom Mulhall , manager for FEMA Response and Recovery Information_Systems at its Miami office . &quot; You couldn ' t say ' turn right at 120th Street. ' You had to say ' right at the water_tower , left at the collapsed shopping center. ' &quot; Powerful notebook PCs allow FEMA field operatives to continually send_in new data and receive redrawn maps several times a day . During the California wildfires last summer , FEMA used GIS to map areas of damage and decide where relief should go . FEMA estimates that this took a three-week process and converted it into a matter of hours . TECH TIPS : What to Look_for With GIS GIS packages are available for PCs , workstations and mainframes . At a minimum , you ' ll need a 486 IBM-compatible PC or a Macintosh II . Either should have at least 8 megabytes of RAM , high-resolution graphics and 100MB of free hard-disk space . Most GIS packages come_with some basic data but expect users to buy additional data for their specific needs . Some desktop packages : * Scan / US , $ 695 ( ( 310 ) 820-1581 ) For Windows , comes bundled with basic demographic data for the entire United States . * MapInfo , $ 1 # 295 ( ( 800 ) 327-8627 ) The largest vendor of Windows-based GIS software , MapInfo sells many GIS add-ons and also makes a Mac version . * Atlas GIS for Windows , $ 1 # 595 ( ( 800 ) 472-6277 ) Atlas is also a major supplier of data formatted for its software . * Businesses with bigger needs might consider a mainframe or workstation installation with the help of a consultant . The two largest GIS companies , Intergraph in Huntsville , Ala. , and ERSI in Redlands , Calif. , specialize in the mainframe market and also have PC products . A good source of information is the monthly magazine GIS World ( ( 303 ) 223-4848 ) .</TEXT>
