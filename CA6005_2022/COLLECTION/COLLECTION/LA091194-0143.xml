   <HEADLINE> THE WESTERN_HEMISPHERE SUMMIT : A GOOD IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS NOT YET ARRIVED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Whatever its stumbles , the Clinton_Administration ' s policy in the Western_Hemisphere has had its priorities right . Bill_Clinton courageously led a bipartisan effort on behalf of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . And his Administration has fostered democracy and market economics , as well as a larger Western_Hemisphere community , without alienating our neighbors . It would thus be a pity if overzealousness in pushing a hemispheric summit jeopardized what has been achieved and what seems realistically within reach during Clinton ' s term . Proposed by Vice_President Al Gore , the Western_Hemisphere summit , scheduled for early December in Miami , is a good idea whose time has not yet come . Heads of government assembled at a summit can either issue general declarations designed to impart a new sense_of_direction or , if well-prepared , they can issue an action program to steer their bureaucracies toward established goals . But the best that can be hoped for under present circumstances is a symbolic public-relations exercise . The new Mexican president will not take_office until Dec . 1 ; the Mexican Cabinet , normally announced the day before the swearing in , will have had barely a week in which to establish itself . Brazil will be focused_on the election of a new president Oct . 3 , with a runoff Nov . 15 if no candidate wins a majority . Because the inauguration is Jan . 1 , Brazil would , in_effect , have to be represented at the summit by two presidents : the outgoing one , without authority , and the incoming one , as yet without power and probably without a program -- especially if there is a runoff . In preparing_for the summit , the Clinton_Administration will lack interlocutors to harmonize its views with two of the key Western_Hemisphere countries . In truth , the United States has yet to formulate views capable of being harmonized . The policies that receive most attention -- the possible invasion of Haiti and the conflict with Cuba -- have little Latin_American support . Above all , the Administration has yet to make_up its mind on the overriding issue for the other summit participants : how to relate NAFTA to the rest of the hemisphere . All this risks either that divisive peripheral issues will dominate the agenda or that the summit will peter_out in platitudes . This would be a pity , because the new governments in Mexico and Brazil will be in an unusually favorable_position to join us in giving new impetus to a creative Western_Hemisphere policy . Mexico has passed a crucial hurdle toward becoming a pluralistic democratic society . And Brazil seems to have traversed the political instability following President Fernando Collor de Mello ' s impeachment and stands poised to reassert its influence . In Mexico , the test for the newly elected president , Ernesto Zedillo , will not be whether he presides over the defeat of_his_own party , the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , but whether he manages to bring_about a genuinely pluralistic process . This will not be a simple matter , given the historic dominance of the PRI and the regional base of other parties . But Zedillo seems committed to rapid political modernization . The United States has a dual obligation to understand the difficulty of this political evolution and to have confidence in the new leadership -- at least until there is strong evidence to the contrary . The missionary tendencies of some middle-level Administration officials , and their apparent preference for the more radical advocates of political change , should be curbed . With respect_to the summit , this means that declarations on democratization should emerge from consultations in which the new president of Mexico is perceived to be a principal contributor and not the recipient of condescending lectures . Such an approach is , however , incompatible with a summit during the first week of Zedillo ' s presidency . The problem is even greater with_respect_to Brazil , where the sequence of economic and political reform is the reverse of Mexico ' s . Mexico is moving toward political pluralism as the result of economic reform ; Brazil is gaining economic momentum in the aftermath of a drastic reform of its politics . The fight to overcome political corruption has enabled former Brazilian Finance_Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso to master the rampant inflation that had threatened to undermine public confidence and drive the democratic politics toward extremism . After the election , the Brazilian economy will gain impetus from accelerated foreign investment that , in turn , will further stabilize Brazil ' s politics . As Brazil masters its domestic difficulties , it will resume a leadership role in Latin_America . It will have the strongest economy ( as large as all other South_American economies combined ) ; one of the most experienced and able foreign services in the world , and an established tradition of participation in international affairs . A reformed Brazil can be expected to favor greater Western_Hemisphere integration based on &quot; Mercosur , &quot; the regional grouping of Brazil , Argentina , Paraguay and Uruguay , which it has sponsored . Launched in 1991 , Mercosur has three options : It can complement NAFTA , become an alternative to it or ultimately combine with it . Any Western_Hemisphere summit that fails to explore these possibilities will also fail to deal with the key issues before the Western_Hemisphere . Thus the reemergence of Brazil as a major interlocutor challenges the United States to a new approach to coordination with our neighbors . Neither such a Brazilian-U.S. dialogue nor adequate consultations with the other countries of Latin_America will be possible before the summit . What little is known of summit preparations derives from a State_Department paper , circulated to potential participants , that seems more suited to an academic conference than to a meeting of heads_of_state . Its headings are vague , the various initiatives it outlines as imprecise as they are vast and unachieveable in the time remaining . And , despite its scope , the proposed agenda is silent on the future relationship of NAFTA to the rest of the hemisphere . These deficiencies cannot possibly be corrected in the time remaining before the summit and in the absence of a Brazilian or Mexican contribution . So_long as Mexico and Brazil cannot participate in meaningful consultations , the existing procedure conveys a patronizing implication that the United States wants the summit for either domestic political reasons or as a platform to lecture Latin_America . All this suggests the following necessities : * Delay the summit until the spring ; * Use the interval to come_up with a U.S. set of proposals ; * Take_advantage of the presence at the United Nations of most Latin_American foreign_ministers during September to begin shaping an agenda that reflects a common hemispheric program . The planned summit is a constructive step_in a basically constructive Administration policy . It should not be spoiled by meeting for the sake of meeting -- when the basis for a real dialogue is so close .</TEXT>
