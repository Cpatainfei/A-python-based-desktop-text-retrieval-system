   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; DOLLAR SLIDE CLIPS STOCK , BOND PRICES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Another steep fall_in the dollar sent bond yields sharply higher Monday and clipped stock prices . In commodities markets , oil prices slumped to their lowest level since early May on expectations of ballooning supplies . The dollar ' s action held_sway over most other markets . The buck edged back toward its record low against the Japanese yen as dealers grew pessimistic about the outlook for progress in bogged-down U.S.-Japan trade talks . In New York , the dollar fell to 97.83 Japanese yen , down from 98.65 on Friday and near its all-time New York low of 97.50 reached July 12 . The dollar also weakened against the German mark , falling to 1.527 from 1.539 on Friday . Despite hopes that the Federal_Reserve_Board ' s recent boost in short-term interest_rates would bolster the dollar , it has continued to slide , reflecting in part a lack of confidence in the United States by foreign investors , experts say . Analysts also said Monday that some currency traders were spooked by rumors that the German central_bank has decided it is finished cutting interest_rates and may in fact need to begin tightening credit soon as Europe ' s economy revives . In the U.S. Treasury_bond market , the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond jumped to 7.55 % from 7.48 % on Friday . Shorter-term yields also rose . Bonds are hurt as the dollar weakens because foreign investors are reluctant to buy U.S. securities , fearing that the falling dollar will continue to devalue U.S. assets . Traders said stocks and bonds were in part victims of typically slow summer-Monday trading activity , but stocks held_up better than bonds . The Dow Jones industrial average eased just 3.89 points to 3 # 751.22 as 235.8 million shares changed hands .

Quaker Oats jumped 2 1 / 8 to 84 , Gillette leaped 1 7 / 8 to 71 7 / 8 and Procter &amp; Gamble gained 5 / 8 to 56 3 / 4 . * Mexican stocks traded_in the United States followed their home market higher as investors celebrated the apparent election of the ruling party ' s presidential candidate Sunday .

It cost 3.338 pesos to buy a dollar in New York on Monday , compared to 3.359 on Friday . In other foreign markets , Tokyo ' s 225-share Nikkei index fell 118.12 points to 20 # 394.58 , continuing its recent selloff . In Frankfurt , the DAX index slid 25.78 points to 2 # 123.79 , while London ' s FTSE-100 index lost 20.1 points to 3 # 171.3.
