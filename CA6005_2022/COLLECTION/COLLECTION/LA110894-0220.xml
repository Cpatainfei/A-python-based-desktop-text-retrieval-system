   <HEADLINE> WORLD OIL OUTPUT SOARS IN OCTOBER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> World oil_production surged by more_than a_million barrels a day in October from September levels , and the upward climb is expected to continue through 1995 , the West ' s oil_industry watchdog said Monday . Production is growing faster than expected because of enhanced recovery methods and other new technology that enables producers to maximize output , and it more_than offsets higher demand forecasts , analysts say . In 1995 , oil_production in non-OPEC countries alone is expected to rise by at least 500 # 000 barrels a day to 41.6 million , the Paris-based International Energy Agency said . Even though oil demand continues to grow at a blistering pace -- a 1.5 % increase , or 1 million barrels a day in 1994 alone , according to the IEA -- the world ' s thirst for oil is being quenched by higher-than-expected exports from the former Soviet_Union , the North_Sea and Latin_America . &quot; Non-OPEC production is constantly going_up , and we think forecasts are actually underestimating it even now . If the winter is very mild , we ' re at risk of falling prices , &quot; said oil analyst Mike Barry of Energy Market Consultants . According to the latest monthly IEA report , most of the October gains were posted in nations that are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , especially North_Sea producers Norway and Britain .</TEXT>
