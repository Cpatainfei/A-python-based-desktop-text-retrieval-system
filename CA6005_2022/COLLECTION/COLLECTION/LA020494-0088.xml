   <HEADLINE> HIGH_SCHOOL NOTEBOOK : CHAMINADE ' S GYM EARNS A BIG ASSIST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chaminade High ' s basketball_team hasn ' t had many breaks this season , but the Eagles got a huge one Monday against visiting Notre Dame . The Knights had the ball with the score tied and eight seconds remaining when Rich Igou spotted Tommy Zapata at the other end of the court , open for an easy layup . But Igou ' s baseball pass was high and hit a speaker hanging from the ceiling at mid-court , turning the ball_over to Chaminade . &quot; He threw the ball the only way he could , &quot; Notre Dame Coach Pete Cassidy said . &quot; He was being triple-teamed . I thought it was a great play . But to Chaminade ' s credit , they still had to score. &quot; The Eagles set_up a play_at mid-court and Mike Yang made a three-foot shot with three seconds left , giving Chaminade a 68-66 victory . FOOTHILL LEAGUE Overlooked Saugus running back Chris Johnson has received no scholarship offers and Coach Jack Bowman is mystified . Johnson rushed for more_than 3 # 000 yards in three seasons , which Bowman thought was enough to cash_in for a scholarship . When classes resumed at Saugus last week , Bowman spent many hours on the phone with college coaches , trying to persuade them to take second looks_at Johnson and All-Valley lineman Matt Speranza . &quot; This really mystifies me , &quot; said Bowman . &quot; I ' m real stunned about both of them. &quot; Johnson rushed for 1 # 398 yards and 19 touchdowns last fall . NORTHWEST VALLEY Irish Get Their Man Finally , it ' s a done deal . San Fernando quarterback Leon Blunt signed a letter_of_intent with Notre Dame on Wednesday , the first day of the NCAA ' s winter signing period , and ended weeks of speculation in the process . It was no easy decision , Blunt said . Blunt said that on Wednesday morning , he was still reconsidering his oral commitment to Notre Dame . USC also was heavily courting the option quarterback . Early Wednesday , while Blunt was getting ready for school and still trying to make_up his mind about college , Notre Dame called . The caller was informed that Blunt was in the shower . &quot; They said they ' d hang_on until I was done , &quot; Blunt said , laughing . &quot; They wanted to make_sure I was gonna sign that thing. &quot; He did . Along with several other Southland standouts , Blunt finally signed his letter_of_intent during a ceremony at Bluechip Illustrated magazine headquarters in Woodland Hills . Hart defensive back John McLaughlin also signed with Notre Dame and attended the event . Blunt may have had trouble selecting a school , but he remembers how to talk the talk . &quot; Me and McLaughlin were the only ones in Notre Dame hats , &quot; Blunt said . &quot; So everybody knew who the best guys were. &quot; * Javy Ramos , an All-City Section basketball guard from San Fernando , missed all_the hubbub . He didn ' t miss any games , however . Because of a family medical emergency , Ramos was forced to leave for Mexico on Jan . 15 , two days before the earthquake leveled parts of the San Fernando Valley . High_school basketball_games were canceled for two weeks . Ramos returned Monday night , in no apparent hurry to get_back to school . Coach Dick Crowell called him at_home Tuesday morning to see if he could make practice later that day . Ramos said he couldn ' t leave the house because the earthquake had damaged the door to his family home . Said Crowell : &quot; Javy , you were gone_for seven or eight days and nobody messed with your house. &quot; The result ? &quot; He hemmed_and_hawed , but he finally agreed ( to come_to practice ) , &quot; Crowell said . * Bob Francola is a little worried about his team . That is , he ' s wondering if he still has one . Francola , the football_coach at Kennedy , said the widespread earthquake damage at the Granada Hills campus has his players talking . &quot; Every time I see something ( on television ) about the schools , they show Kennedy , &quot; Francola said . &quot; that ' s where the most visible damage is. &quot; As a result , Francola had to do some damage_control of_his_own . Some returning Kennedy players already have assumed that the school will be bulldozed and that they will be attending another school next fall , he said . Francola has started calling players to assure them that Kennedy , despite the structural damage , will field a team . Kennedy , the newest of the 49 high_schools in the L.A. Unified School District , suffered so_much damage that administrators adopted a year-round academic calendar . The school is not expected to reopen until March . MID-VALLEY LEAGUE Got a Charge Out of It Birmingham ' s Tony Silberfeld doesn ' t mind being a pushover on the court -- just as long as he gets the call . Silberfeld -- all 6-feet and 128 pounds of him -- has taken 28 charges in 12 games . &quot; Offensive charges not only turn games around , they can nullify baskets and change momentum , &quot; Braves ' Coach Al Bennett said . &quot; It is a really big play. &quot; Bennett said Silberfeld has an eye for spotting opportunity . &quot; He looks_for that kind of thing , &quot; Bennett said . &quot; His back is all bruised up , but it has really kept us in games. &quot; PACIFIC LEAGUE An ' A ' for Honesty You ' ve got_to respect a coach who comes right out and admits when he ' s made a mistake . So , applaud John Goffredo . The Crescenta Valley coach has watched Hoover upset his team twice this season , both on last-second shots . The second time was last week , and Goffredo admitted it was the Tornadoes ' delay offense that caused his team problems . The Falcons weren ' t prepared_for it , Goffredo said . But Hoover ' s delay was no secret . The Tornadoes had been running it for weeks . &quot; I didn ' t think they ' d do_it against us , though , &quot; Goffredo said . &quot; I wasn ' t prepared. &quot; MARMONTE LEAGUE Royal Resurgence The Royal girls ' basketball program , which did not have a winning record in any of Coach Paula Getty-Shear ' s first five seasons , is riding high . Last season , Royal was 5-17 . &quot; And that was with two forfeits , &quot; Getty-Shear said , laughing . &quot; We were really 3-19. &quot; But the resurgent Highlanders won 12 of their first 15 games this season , including a 54-42 victory over Thousand Oaks on Jan . 25 . It was the first time a Getty-Shear team defeated the Lancers . Why the sudden improvement ? &quot; We have some ( good ) players finally , &quot; Getty-Shear said . Sophomore Tawnee Cooper has been a revelation , averaging 19.6 points , 9.7 rebounds and four steals a game . Two other sophomore newcomers , Jenny Broadhurst and Merilee Lewis , start for the Highlanders , as does Croatian foreign-exchange student Bruna Grubisic . * The Channel Islands girls ' basketball_team recently lost a starter for the rest of the season . But she isn ' t injured , nor did she flunk all her classes or move_out of the area . She graduated . Raider forward Alison Jones finished her required classwork as of the just-completed first semester and opted to graduate , ending her high_school career early . &quot; We ' re going to miss her , but we ' ll be all_right , &quot; Coach Don Salado said . Jones may try to play for Oxnard College . * One of the hottest squads in the state , the Raiders ( 18-2 ) have won 17 consecutive games , including all 10 of their league contests , entering Thursday night ' s game against Camarillo . Senior guard Shawanda Hotchkiss has been their key player , averaging 17 points , 5.5 rebounds and three steals . &quot; It ' s been a great season for us , &quot; Coach Don Salado said . &quot; We ' ve been playing real steady basketball. &quot; CHANNEL LEAGUE Muscling In Ventura has virtually locked_up the league wrestling championship after beating Rio Mesa , 46-13 , last week , but Coach Paul Clementi is looking_for more . The Cougars are ranked No . 2 in the Southern Section Division I coaches ' poll behind El Modena . If Ventura can finish in the top two , it will earn a home match in the preliminary round of the dual meet championships , an event it has hosted only once before , in 1992 . &quot; It ' s what we ' re shooting for now , &quot; Clementi said . &quot; This has been a basketball town but we ' re helping to turn it on to other sports . It would be a great way for our seniors to start their playoffs. &quot; Around the Leagues . . . * St . Genevieve Coach Dan Donovan missed his team ' s game last week because he was trying to move_out of his earthquake-damaged home_in Valencia . Problem was , Donovan couldn ' t find any vacant storage_space for his belongings while his home was being repaired . Building inspectors gave Donovan ' s house a yellow tag , meaning limited access is permitted . He will stay there until he is able to store his belongings and move_in temporarily with his in-laws in Northridge . * St . Francis ( 17-5 , 8-1 in Del Rey League play ) has allowed 60 points or more only twice this season , and the Golden Knights won both of those games . The team is allowing 48.5 points per game , but averaging only 52.6 offensively . * Crescenta Valley junior Brock Jacobsen finally has started to meet the scoring potential Coach John Goffredo had predicted . Jacobsen , who was injured early in the season , scored 53 points in two games last week . Jacobsen is the younger brother of Adam Jacobsen , who graduated from Crescenta Valley in 1993 and holds the Southern Section record for most three-point baskets with 387 . * Verdugo Hills ' Chan Cornish is averaging 17.8 points and 14.2 rebounds a game . * Because of a scheduling quirk , the Crescenta Valley girls ' basketball_team has played 11 of its last 12 games on_the_road . And its final four games , scheduled to be at_home , will be played_at Glendale College because the Falcon gym was damaged by the earthquake . * Saugus forward Lisa Nielsen is the leading girls ' scorer in the Foothill League with an average of 13.9 points a game . * Chaminade sophomore Tami Pivnick is leading the girls ' soccer team in scoring for the second consecutive season . The midfielder has 20 goals and eight assists in 20 matches . The Eagles are battling Mission League opponents Alemany , Harvard-Westlake and Louisville for the league ' s final two playoff spots . Bishop Montgomery has clinched the title . * Four Harvard-Westlake wrestlers were winners in their own tournament last weekend . Paul Michaels ( 103 pounds ) , Brandon Roth ( 112 ) , Josh Eisenberg ( 171 ) and Germain de Martinis ( 189 ) each won their weight divisions , leading the Wolverines to the team championship . Kennedy Cosgrove and staff writers Steve Elling , Jeff Fletcher , Dana Haddad , Michael Lazarus and Paige A . Leech contributed to this notebook .</TEXT>
