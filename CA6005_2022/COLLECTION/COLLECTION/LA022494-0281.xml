   <HEADLINE> EAST VALLEY FOCUS : SAN FERNANDO ; COUNCIL ENACTS OIL_PIPELINE MORATORIUM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Responding to concerns raised by a massive pipeline fire caused by last month ' s earthquake , the San Fernando City_Council Tuesday night enacted a 45-day moratorium on oil_pipeline agreements . Aimed at stalling a proposed crude-oil conduit that would cross beneath the city , the move puts San Fernando in step with the city of Los Angeles , which last week enacted an identical moratorium . It can also be extended until engineers submit reports on pipeline safety and investigate earthquake-triggered ruptures of the aging Four Corners Pipeline , which runs from Kern County to the South Bay and dates_from the 1920s . Oil from one of the ruptures , on Wolfskill Street in Mission Hills , ignited , seriously burning a man , destroying a house and charring 17 vehicles . Tuesday night ' s vote was aimed at a proposed Pacific Pipeline Systems Inc. pipe segment that would run beneath a railway right_of_way in San Fernando . The underground line would connect Emidio , about 60 miles north of Santa Clarita , to Wilmington and El Segundo , and is a key link between offshore Santa Barbara oil fields and South Bay refineries . Pacific Pipeline supports the moratorium , and is confident that it can convince elected officials and the public that its line is safe . &quot; We back it because I feel they should settle any concerns they have about pipelines , &quot; said Norman Rooney , president of Pacific Pipeline Systems Inc. , a sister company of the Southern Pacific Transportation Inc. &quot; There ' s been a dramatic improvement in pipeline technology in the last 20 years , let alone the last 50 years. &quot; Anti-pipeline activists from Los Angeles tried to persuade the San Fernando council to enact a stronger measure and fund its own safety studies , but the council balked at the cost . &quot; We are a 2.5-square-mile city with limited resources and we ' re trying to protect the citizens of our town , &quot; Councilman Doude Wysbeek told members of the Los Angeles-based Coalition to Prevent the Pipeline and Pollution . &quot; For us to ( employ ) an independent engineer and expend a tremendous amount of city resources on a pipeline that we don ' t even know will come_through at this point would be foolish. &quot; GEOFFREY MOHAN</TEXT>
