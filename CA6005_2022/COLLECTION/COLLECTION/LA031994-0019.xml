   <TEXT> Rochelle Manning -- a radical Jewish settler who was awaiting extradition to California for trial in the letter-bomb murder of a Manhattan Beach secretary -- died Friday in an Israeli prison , a government spokesman said . Manning , 54 , had fainted after morning_prayers at the prison outside Tel Aviv . She lost_consciousness and died 45 minutes later of an apparent heart_attack , said Dubi Ben-Ami , a Prisons Authority spokesman . An autopsy is planned , as Manning did not have a known heart_condition . Manning , who immigrated to Israel in 1986 , had lived_in Kiryat Arba , a militant Jewish settlement near Hebron in the West_Bank , where she and her husband were close friends of Dr. Baruch Goldstein , another American immigrant , who massacred about 30 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque three weeks ago . In an interview a week ago with the weekly newspaper Kol Hair , Manning recounted that Goldstein had told her in January how depressed he had grown after the upsurge in attacks on Jewish settlers in Kiryat Arba and Hebron , particularly the murder of a close friend and his son . &quot; He told me he felt he was going crazy , &quot; Manning said in the interview . &quot; He was terribly hurt by the murder ( in December ) of Mordechai Lapid and his son Shalom . . . . He was the last person I would think could do something like that ( the Hebron massacre ) , but on second thought he was the only one who could have done it. &quot; Israel ' s Supreme Court earlier this month turned_down Manning ' s final appeal against an extradition order returning her to the United States to stand trial in the 1980 death of Patricia Wilkerson , who was killed when a bomb hidden in an electrical appliance exploded . Manning ' s husband , Robert , was extradited to the United States last July , convicted in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles of conspiracy to murder and sentenced to life imprisonment . Prosecutors alleged in that trial that the bomb was intended for Wilkerson ' s boss , Brenda Crouthamel Adams , at the Prowest Computer Corp . and that the Mannings had been hired by Los Angeles real_estate_broker William Ross , who had a protracted business dispute with Adams . Rochelle Manning was tried with Ross for the murder in 1988 , but the jury couldn ' t reach a verdict . She was arrested in 1991 in Israel , and for three years she fought extradition . Ross recently was returned from Canada to Los Angeles , where he awaits retrial . The Mannings had been_active with Ross in the Jewish Defense League , founded by the late Rabbi Meir Kahane , which has provided many of the members of Israel ' s extremist Kach movement . Israel banned Kach this week as a &quot; terrorist organization. &quot; In Kiryat Arba , the Mannings were regarded , with Goldstein , as among Kach ' s most radical supporters ; Israel Army Radio said neighbors described them as &quot; Bonnie and Clyde &quot; for their willingness to use arms against Palestinians . Kach advocates the use of violence to drive Arabs from the biblical Land of Israel . But friends expressed great sorrow at Rochelle Manning ' s death . &quot; We have maintained she was innocent , &quot; said Rabbi Kenny Cohen , who had known the Mannings in Los Angeles as well as in Kiryat Arba . &quot; We are saddened that the government of Israel and its people did not stand_up for her . I think everyone here knew she was innocent , including people in the ( Israeli ) government . . . . But no one had the courage to say , ' We are not sending her. ' &quot;</TEXT>
