   <HEADLINE> THE DEFENDERS ; BEYOND THE GLITZ OF CELEBRITY TRIALS , CRIMINAL_LAW IS A GUT-WRENCHING BUSINESS THAT THE PUBLIC DISDAINS . AND NOW , ECONOMICS ARE MAKING IT A DEAD-END CAREER FOR ALL BUT DEFENDERS OF THE RICH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They can trace their lives through a succession of grisly subtitles : the Hillside Strangler , the 54th Street Massacre , the Ninja Murders , the Halloween Ambush , the Chinatown Shoot-out . . . . They can recall , in anguished detail , each case they ' ve lost , each time a client has been sentenced to life imprisonment or , God forbid , death . They are criminal defense_attorneys -- not the celebrity lawyers who squeeze past ogling camera_lenses on the way to represent the_likes_of O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson , but the everyday lawyers who champion the causes of anonymous men and women accused of heinous crimes . They ' ve never been asked_for an autograph , never posed for People magazine . They dine , not at hoity-toity places , but with the hoi_polloi in a corner of a dingy courtroom cafeteria . &quot; Despite the Robert Shapiros of the world , people like me are not getting rich , &quot; said Tustin defense_lawyer Donald G . Rubright . &quot; I don ' t have a Mercedes ; I have a Maxima with 122 # 000 miles on it. &quot; And even as their profession takes center stage this week in Simpson ' s trial on double-murder charges , they worry that the kind of high-stakes criminal_law they practice is becoming a dead-end career for all except the few whose clients are the very , very rich . The lawyers are not alone in their fears . The same sense of impending extinction is permeating the ranks of specialists and sole practitioners throughout the professions -- from medicine to accounting to architecture -- as economic and social realities corrode layers of tradition and privilege . Private attorneys will always pick_up drunk driving and misdemeanor cases . But for specialists in major felonies , &quot; there ' s no future , &quot; laments Rickard Santwier , a criminal defense_attorney for 25 years . &quot; The only lawyers who will be private practitioners will be those who are hired by people with money. &quot; Court appointments to represent clients who couldn ' t afford their own defense used to keep the private defense_lawyers busy . But this year , Los Angeles County opened a second public_defender office -- as_many municipalities have done -- and cut by more_than half the number of cases spun_off to outside lawyers . In Orange County , where the idea of a second public_defender ' s office has been around for a while , court administrators are clamping_down on fees paid_for expert witnesses and investigators that private defense_lawyers say they need . A Superior_Court judge was assigned earlier this year to hear complaints from lawyers who feel they were wrongly denied funds by court bureaucrats -- who keep their eyes on the purse_strings , not defense needs . &quot; A lot of judges like to say that an indigent defendant is not entitled to a Cadillac defense , &quot; Rubright said . &quot; But as one judge said : ' It ' d better be a Chevy that starts when you turn the key. ' &quot; Just as significantly , the cost of a felony criminal case , especially a murder trial , has soared past middle-class affordability , further concentrating work in the hands of public_defenders . &quot; For private lawyers like myself doing murder cases , there are fewer and fewer cases , &quot; said defense_attorney Michael Yamaki . &quot; People just can ' t afford the kind of defense they need in such a case . . . . Everybody deserves the same kind of defense that O.J. is getting , but how many people are going_to get_it ? that ' s the question. &quot; With fewer cases coming their way -- and the realization that the economics will only get_worse -- many of the region ' s best criminal defense_attorneys , including those who have specialized in death-penalty cases , are putting their skills to work_on white-collar crime cases , family law , environmental issues and even an occasional drunk-driving charge . Others are looking_at retirement , calculating how much longer they can go_on if they don ' t want to branch_out . Tough choices , these are , for a breed of attorney that seems locked_in the embrace of a grinding , gut-wrenching , all-consuming job . For the unlucky , murder trials and death-penalty cases can lay waste to physical health , deplete emotional reserves , sunder marriages and friendships and make a mockery of the most earnest of personal commitments . They ' re all unlucky sometimes . Carl Jones knows who and how , and rattles_off a list of wrecks as easily as if he were reciting his own resume . This one is in a wheelchair , another is using a cane after a stroke , a third suddenly dropped_dead . Jones knows from his inside out the toll a death-penalty trial can take_on an attorney . He ' s been doing them for nearly three decades now , and colleagues say he ' s one of the best . &quot; I ' ve frequently said I can ' t find any death-penalty trial_lawyers over 65 years old who are in good_health . . . . Check around . You ' ll find people with vision problems , heart problems , strokes , diabetes , high_blood_pressure , &quot; Jones said . &quot; It seems we bury somebody every month or so . It ' s a killing profession . In trying to save lives , we ' re all killing ourselves. &quot; And for whom ? Accused murderers , rapists , hate-crime perpetrators -- individuals whose names are more obscure than the where , when and how of the crime . Defendants feared and reviled by a public that is baffled , even appalled , when lawyers willingly take their cases . A public that ' s quick to cry &quot; technicalities &quot; if the defense is successful . &quot; It ' s not easy being a defense_attorney , &quot; Rubright said . &quot; You ' re not beloved by the public , by prosecutors or police , and often not by your own client. &quot; For this , courts typically pay attorneys $ 50 an hour -- $ 75 an hour in a capital case -- while colleagues in large law_firms bill their corporate clients four or five times as much , senior partners charge $ 600 an hour and the biggest-name lawyers get $ 1 # 000 or even $ 2 # 500 an hour . &quot; The county pays $ 300 or $ 400 an hour to a civil lawyer to handle a landslide or fight voter reapportionment . Then they pay us $ 75 an hour for a death-penalty case , &quot; Jones said . &quot; We ' re only handling life and liberty. &quot; Under a contract with a panel of private attorneys , Los Angeles County now pays a flat rate for defending indigents in major felony cases . The rates are based on a number of factors , including the seriousness of the charge and complexity of the case , with four tiers of payment : $ 60 # 000 , $ 90 # 000 , $ 120 # 000 and $ 200 # 000 and higher . High-profile lawyer Leslie Abramson , who collected $ 650 # 000 from the now-depleted estate of Jose and Kitty Menendez for defending their son Erik on murder_charges , will be paid $ 125 # 000 a year by the county for Erik ' s retrial . ( Lawyers expect Simpson ' s defense to exhaust his net worth , estimated to be $ 10 million. ) In Orange County , flat fees govern all non-homicide cases . Private lawyers on panels receive from $ 360 for a misdemeanor case to $ 1 # 160 for a felony case that is bound over for trial , plus up_to $ 360 a day for felony trial work . The Orange County courts have reviewed and rejected proposals for a second public_defender office , though county managers continue to consider it . &quot; We felt that our contracts ( with private lawyers ) were more cost-effective than a second public_defender ' s office , &quot; said Alan Slater , the Superior_Court ' s executive_officer . From their fees , criminal defense_attorneys -- who most often practice alone or with a small group of partners -- have to pay the office rent , utility bills and clerical salaries . And unlike public_defenders , who make $ 42 # 500 to $ 96 # 800 a year in Los Angeles County , they don ' t have paid benefits -- vacations , health_insurance , retirement_plans and the_like . Still , criminal defense_attorneys don ' t claim to be impoverished . Most say they live comfortable lives . But not lavish . &quot; People at the top make an OK living , &quot; said Charles Lindner , a defense_attorney in Santa Monica and former president of the Criminal_Courts Bar Assn . &quot; But nobody who ' s really good does_it for the money . Carl ( Jones ) is not rich , Leslie is not rich . I ' m not rich . Our civil counterparts are probably making $ 800 # 000 a year . &quot; Am I comfortable ? Yes . I ' m supposed to be , &quot; Lindner said . &quot; I ' ve been a lawyer for 20 years . To have a 2 # 000-square-foot house on a decent lot on the Westside of town , that ' s comfortable . But what are you supposed to have after 20 years of work . . . and still pulling 60 hours a week ? &quot; Veteran Santa Ana defense_lawyer Marshall M . Schulman says practitioners aren ' t going_to become multimillionaires , and that fact also has led to the erosion of members in the criminal defense bar . &quot; You don ' t see the younger lawyers getting_into the field , &quot; Schulman , 67 , said . &quot; Criminal_law was very popular in the 1960s and ' 70s , but in the ' 80s and continuing in the ' 90s , young lawyers have become much more mercenary . They now are more interested in material wealth. &quot; In the past six years , since leaving the Los Angeles public_defender ' s office , Mark S . Kaiserman has spent most of his time on five or six death-penalty cases . He earned more money in private practice . But not enough . This past week , Kaiserman went_to work for the new second public_defender ' s office . &quot; Yes , I was making more , substantially more , &quot; Kaiserman said . &quot; But that doesn ' t mean I was happier . The quality of my life was not better . I was working harder during those years , with one death-penalty case after another. &quot; Harder even than having 30 or 40 cases to juggle at any one time in the public_defender ' s office . While in private practice , Kaiserman skipped work_on weekends only once or twice a year . &quot; that ' s not the kind of life I wanted . Other things are important to me , &quot; he said . The other things are his wife and two children . &quot; I enjoyed my life more with what I was making as a public_defender than with what I was making in the years of private practice , &quot; Kaiserman said . &quot; I had more of a life and I felt better about myself. &quot; Defense_attorneys who specialize in death-penalty cases know about not having a life , about having their lives consumed by the peril of another ' s , about being terrified to take any time for themselves . &quot; This is just not you picking_up a briefcase and coming_to work , &quot; said attorney Yamaki , a former member of the Los Angeles Police Commission . &quot; Your entire life is entrenched with the case . . . . People talk_about the high costs ( of ) legal_representation , but I think most lawyers are charging an amount that takes into consideration what this is going_to take_out of them by the time they finish the case . &quot; There is a dilemma between having a personal life and really doing your best work . I don ' t really know if you can balance the two , &quot; Yamaki said . &quot; I try to give as much commitment to my personal life as_to a case , but while you ' re in trial , your trial becomes more important than your personal life at that time . It sounds sick , but when given the responsibility of defending someone ' s life , it . . . requires a full-time commitment . You can ' t be a part-time lawyer when you ' re doing a death-penalty trial. &quot; This awful burden of someone else ' s life leaves defense_attorneys with little energy for anything else . &quot; You are it for your client , &quot; said Santa Monica defense_attorney Michael V . White . &quot; Your client has nobody else to rely_on but you . You are the last stop . If you can ' t do your best for your client , if you can ' t save your client , the client ' s gone . that ' s a pretty awesome responsibility. &quot; So they obsess on their cases . They choose an office because it ' s near the courthouse , then make_it into a cocoon . They bark at their secretaries , skip meals and , after a 16-hour workday , wake_up at 2 a.m. to scribble more notes . Every personal plan gets tossed aside , Yamaki said . &quot; I would be hard to live with , if I went_on vacation and didn ' t do that last bit of interviewing and it might have helped the case , &quot; he said . &quot; In your mind , you think that everything you do might make or break the case , and you have so_much fear that , even in_questioning ( witnesses ) , that you can blow your case , just by one wrong question . &quot; that ' s what you make ( clients ) pay_for , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s more_than hours ; it ' s the emotional toll . You never , ever recover . I can tell you every case that I lost , what I thought happened in the case , what I would have done differently . . . . You carry it with you. &quot; At his Pasadena office , attorney Jones can shut_out just about everything when he ' s working_on a life-or-death case -- everything but the regrets of a loss . &quot; You agonize , second-guess yourself , beat yourself up bad , &quot; he said . &quot; You wonder , dammit , why did I go_to that movie , take that afternoon off , go_to lunch ? Would it have been different if I had worked that weekend ? It ' s horrible . It ' s horrible. &quot; In his 25 years of practice , Santwier never has had a client sentenced to death . But whenever he takes_on another capital case , he has to steel himself for that possibility . With each case , Santwier said , &quot; I see a substantial change in me . Each time you try one of these cases , you give_up a little bit of your person , your humanity . You try not to make the highs too high or the lows too low , else , how can you go_on to the next case ? &quot; Going_on to the next case is becoming harder and harder for private defense_lawyers . Santwier , who co-chairs the county panel of attorneys who take_on indigent clients , said about 50 % of his caseload now comes from court appointments . By next year , he figures , about 20 % of his cases will be court-appointed ; in two years , that will drop_down to 5 % . &quot; One of the sad things about the law I ' m practicing now is that I won ' t be practicing it in the future , &quot; Santwier said . Jones , who is 56 , doesn ' t want to practice any other kind of law . &quot; I ' m watching the calendar until I can get the hell out of here , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m going_to retire . I ' m going_to finish the three cases I ' ve got , and then I ' m not taking any more . &quot; With people dropping_dead and committing suicide , having heart_attacks and strokes , I think it ' s the wise alternative , &quot; Jones said . &quot; I want to retire . I want to live. &quot; Fifty-two-year-old H . Elizabeth Harris wants to go_on practicing forever , she says . But she wants to stay off Jones ' list of wretched lives . She was headed there a_few years ago , her blood_pressure a barometer of her growing caseload . So she made some changes . She ' s a vegetarian now and fits a four-mile walk into each 12-hour workday . Last year , she took two months off and went_to Africa . She knows now that &quot; I have to take_care of all parts of me , &quot; Harris said . After her current capital cases are finished , she is not likely to take_on any more . Yet it ' s hard for criminal defense_attorneys to watch their practices metamorphose into civil_law . The love of the fight -- the belief that they ' re making a difference -- burrows into their souls and stays there . &quot; There have been times , &quot; said White , &quot; when I have represented somebody who ' s never ever had anybody in their corner before . They see me fight with everything I ' ve got and they know I care . Win or lose , they ' ve at least found somebody who has been there for them. &quot; Despite everything , added Jones , &quot; there is one saving grace to all_of this : when the court clerk reads the verdict ' not_guilty , ' or , in a hopeless case , when the clerk instead of reading a verdict of death reads a verdict of life imprisonment . that ' s why we do it. &quot;</TEXT>
