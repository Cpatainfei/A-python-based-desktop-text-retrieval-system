   <HEADLINE> U.S. BUSINESSMAN IN CHILE WORKS FROM THE GROUND UP ; CROPS : HE HOPES TO BECOME A MAJOR CRANBERRY PRODUCER -- MAYBE EVEN NO . 1 . HE ALSO WANTS TO SELL HIS PRODUCT WHERE FEW PEOPLE NOW THIRST FOR IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California businessman Warren Simmons is betting big on cranberries . He ' s investing millions of dollars to plant 1 # 000 acres of cranberries in this nation , where the fruit has never been produced commercially . Simmons hopes to become a major cranberry producer -- maybe even No . 1 in the world . He also hopes that juice from his crop can be sold in Europe or Asia -- where hardly anyone now thirsts for the product . Can it be done ? That depends_on many things , including bugs and bumblebees . Simmons , 66 , is the first to admit he is taking a plunge . He is not a farmer , much less a juice-maker or a mass-marketer . But he does have some impressive business successes behind him , plus some considerable capital to gamble . And he believes_in bumblebees . &quot; If I start talking_about bumblebees , I talk all day , &quot; he says as he begins a tour through some of the farmland he is developing near Valdivia , in southern Chile . A former airline pilot , Simmons started the Tia Maria restaurant_chain in the early 1970s , then developed San Francisco ' s Pier 39 commercial complex . With his son , Scooter , he founded Chevys Mexican Restaurants , which had 37 outlets when they sold_out to Pepsico ' s Taco Bell Corp . in 1992 . It was at Chevys that Simmons first focused_on cranberries . He ordered fresh cranberries for making margarita cocktails but , as he recalls it , Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. was unable to fill the order because of shortages . After visiting Chile to explore the possibility of producing wine grapes here , he decided that cranberries could be more profitable . American demand for cranberries is strong , while North_American land suitable for growing them is in short supply . When the fruit was mainly used for sauces and jellies , there was plenty to go_around . But Ocean Spray ' s successful promotion of cranberry_juice has expanded the market enormously . The perennial cranberry vine , which spreads low over the ground in a tangle of thin runners and shoots , thrives in boggy , acidic soils . Those conditions are found mainly in Wisconsin , Massachusetts and New Jersey . But American legislation to preserve natural wetlands has severely curtailed expansion of cranberry bogs . Cranberries also are grown in &quot; upland &quot; fields that are specially adapted with irrigation and sprinkling systems . This type of cultivation has been successful in Washington and Oregon , but increasingly strict limitations on the diversion of river waters are making expansion of cranberry lands difficult there too . Canada has been contributing 7 % or so of the supply of cranberries in recent years , but Canadian environmental restrictions also limit new planting . Meanwhile , popular belief in the medicinal value of cranberry_juice , especially against urinary_tract_infections , has helped keep American demand growing . In the past few years , agricultural researchers have found that cranberry plants grow well in southern Chile , which has a cool , rainy climate similar to that of the Pacific Northwest . So far , no one has produced cranberries here for export , but Simmons plans to begin doing so in 1996 . As for those bumblebees : One problem cranberry growers face is pollination . Honeybees often fail to show_up for work_on rainy or overcast days . But bumblebees , Simmons says , work rain or shine ; using them to pollinate cranberries can increase fruit yields by 28 % . He plans to put_in flower beds -- borage , cat mint , bee plant -- around his cranberry beds to attract bumblebees . When the cranberries are in bloom , the flowers will be cut , leaving only cranberry blossoms for the bumblebees . &quot; We will bring_in a bumblebee expert and we will propagate our own colonies , &quot; Simmons says . &quot; To get a 28 % higher yield , I ' ll do anything. &quot; That clearly is Simmons ' style : Do what it takes , cost what it may . He already has hired Elden Stang , a horticulture professor from the University of Wisconsin , as technical adviser for his company here , called Cran Chile . Stang , one of a handful of top American experts on cranberries , took a year ' s leave_of_absence from the university last July to work with Simmons in Chile . Stang ' s wife , Judy , supervises a laboratory where tiny pieces of cranberry plant are propagated in a gelatin-like medium of vitamins , minerals , growth_hormones and sugar . The laboratory shoots then grow roots in a greenhouse , where they are redivided . The lab and greenhouse are producing over 6 million plants a month , Stang says , making the micro-propagation operation one of the largest in the world . Cranberries do not reproduce from seeds . In the United States , new plants are grown from vine cuttings , but strict Chilean regulations for importing plants made_it impossible to bring_in enough cuttings for a project like Cran Chile . So Stang , 54 , helped Simmons set_up the center for micro-propagation with technology that had never been used for reproducing cranberry plants on a large scale . &quot; The man had amazing faith to do this , &quot; Stang says . One advantage to micro-propagation instead of_imported cuttings is that diseases common to cranberries in North_America are kept_out . &quot; We ' ve seen no diseases , &quot; Stang says . Cran Chile planting began in October and continues at a rate of about five acres a day . Touring three farms where work is taking_place , Simmons stops where bulldozers , backhoes and tractors prepare sunken planting beds the size of football_fields . The beds are side_by_side with roadways in between . Most cranberry crops in the United States are harvested by flooding the growing beds with water . The berries float to the surface , where they are more easily gathered_in . Simmons will harvest his crops from mobile bridges that span the planting beds to avoid any harmful pressure on the plants , he says . &quot; The biggest thing is to save stress on the beds. &quot; Cranberry vines take four to five years to mature . The average for cranberry yields in the United States is 160 to 180 barrels an acre ( a barrel is 100 pounds ) . Some land in Oregon has yielded more_than 600 barrels an acre . By the year 2001 , when he has 1 # 000 acres of mature vines in production , Simmons hopes to be harvesting 300 barrels of cranberries per acre . That would be a total of 300 # 000 barrels , more_than any single producer now harvests . &quot; Our weather , we hope , duplicates Bandon , Oregon , &quot; he said . &quot; They have the highest yield of anywhere in the world. &quot; Simmons does not say how much he is investing . But the Chilean financial newspaper Estrategia estimates pre-production investment for cranberries in Chile at up_to $ 16 # 000 per acre -- $ 16 million for 1 # 000 acres . Simmons says he hopes to find a juice-maker to turn his berries into concentrate . If no one is interested , he said , he will invest in a juice plant himself . But he says he needs to contract with a large marketing organization to sell the juice . He says he has approached several companies . &quot; I didn ' t even get an answer to my letters , &quot; he complains , but his optimism seems undaunted . &quot; The Germans like a tart drink , &quot; he says . &quot; I think they would like cranberry_juice . I think Germany is the ideal market. &quot; He says he is reluctant to put his cranberries on the American market , because the additional availability might depress prices , but he will do so if he can ' t sell them in Europe or Asia . At least one other company is planning to grow cranberries for export in southern Chile . Partners in the venture include Americans Thomas Kehler , Don Mowat and Jon Lindbergh , son of the late aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh . Simmons admits his is a big bet , one he could lose . &quot; There ' s just a chance there ' s a bug down here that thrives on cranberries , &quot; he says . &quot; If some bug eats all my cranberries , I ' ll shrug my shoulders and walk away . But if I make money on it , I want to keep growing. &quot;</TEXT>
