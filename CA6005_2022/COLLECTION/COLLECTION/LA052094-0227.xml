   <HEADLINE> RECORD U.S. SALES ABROAD HELP CUT THE TRADE_DEFICIT ; COMMERCE : BUT THE CONTENTIOUS IMBALANCE WITH JAPAN PERSISTS AS GAP HITS $ 5.8 BILLION IN MARCH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. trade_deficit narrowed greatly to $ 7.46 billion in March as a record level of American sales abroad helped offset record imports , the Commerce_Department said Thursday . However , within the overall positive report were troubling statistics on trade with Japan . While the total U.S. deficit narrowed by 18.5 % , the imbalance with Japan grew by 25.4 % to $ 5.8 billion , its third-highest monthly level . As the report was being released , representatives of both nations were meeting , breaking three months of near silence in an effort to resume negotiations on a smoother trade relationship . The monthly U.S. trade figures , which are routinely volatile , showed U.S. exports of goods at an all-time high of $ 42.17 billion . Imports were valued at $ 54.21 billion , also a record . A surplus in the area of services -- investment operations , entertainment and travel , for example -- cut the overall trade_deficit . The Commerce_Department reported that the increase in exports was fueled by jumps in U.S. sales of gold bullion , commercial airplanes , telecommunications_equipment and engines . &quot; These exports occur in areas of rising U.S. competitiveness and coincide with some early signs of better economic_growth in the industrialized nations , particularly in Europe , &quot; Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown said in a statement . But he said that despite such month-to-month jumps , &quot; continued slow growth abroad remains a drag_on U.S. economic expansion. &quot; The United States has been pressuring Japan to stimulate its sluggish domestic economy to spur demand for U.S. goods and help narrow the growing trade imbalance between the two countries . Emissaries from the new Japanese government of Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata visited the offices of the U.S. trade representative Thursday , trying to re-establish talks that were broken_off Feb . 11 when U.S. and Japanese officials were unable to agree on a plan to open the Japanese market in four crucial economic sectors . U.S. officials approached the meeting with a wait-and-see attitude , saying during a dinner break that they had not yet heard enough from the Japanese to warrant reopening the stalled negotiations . But they said the meetings would continue into the evening and could resume today . The Japanese , a senior White_House official said , &quot; know what it would take &quot; to resume formal negotiations . With the Hata government still trying to get its political footing , Clinton_Administration officials are reluctant to push Japanese officials to make risky concessions . There is no suggestion that such pressure , which produced some progress in low-visibility areas during the past year , would be successful in the coming year . Negotiations fell_apart when Hata ' s predecessor , Morihiro Hosokawa , visited the White_House earlier in the year . At this stage , with the new prime_minister expressing interest in resuming the talks , &quot; it ' s not the best thing in the world to start throwing furniture around the room , &quot; a senior U.S. trade official said . Throughout its first year in office , the Administration sought ways to pressure Japan to compromise on the trade front , demanding that Tokyo agree to establish some form of objective criteria for measuring progress in purchasing foreign products . Senior officials deny there has been a shift from that approach , but their comments have suggested that it has less emphasis . They said there is no deadline for progress , and they steered clear of creating any expectation that Clinton and Hata would be able to nail_down an agreement by the time they meet at the next international economic summit , which takes_place in Naples , Italy , in July . But they also made_it clear they are unwilling to let new talks drag_on indefinitely . Speaking in what he freely acknowledged was a defensive tenor , the senior trade official took pains during a recent meeting with reporters to emphasize a series of agreements that are intended to open Japan to U.S. apples , rice and chemicals , as well as cellular_telephone companies and construction contracts . After the meeting Thursday got under way , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told reporters during a recess that &quot; we had an exchange of very detailed ideas. &quot; * NAFTA PAYOFF : Exports to Mexico are booming .
