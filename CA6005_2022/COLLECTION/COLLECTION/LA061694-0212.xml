   <TEXT> Bond yields soared and stocks tumbled Wednesday as rising commodity prices renewed concerns about inflation .

The Treasury ' s benchmark 30-year bond yield rocketed to 7.39 % from 7.30 % late Tuesday . It was the highest closing yield since June 1 . Its price , which moves_in the opposite direction , plunged 29 / 32 point , or $ 9.06 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . The rise in interest_rates , which gave equity investors an excuse to sell and collect profits amassed recently , sent the Dow Jones average , which on Tuesday climbed past 3 # 800 for the first time since late March , down to 3 # 790.41 , losing 24.42. The blue_chip gauge had gained more_than 31 points in the previous session . Bond prices were narrowly higher during the morning , with investors encouraged by government data indicating economic_growth may be slowing .

Oil prices soared due_to increasing tensions concerning North_Korea and an unexpected decrease in weekly U.S. supply figures . Precious_metals also moved higher with gold rising $ 2.60 an ounce on the New York Comex . The bond market ' s rout triggered the setback in_stocks . &quot; It seems like every time the CRB index hits a certain level , the bond market gets negative and then our market just follows_suit , &quot; said Alice Sadlo , first vice_president at McDonald &amp; Co . The selloff on inflation worries hit blue_chips across the board . &quot; It shows you just how nervous people feel about the inflation issue , &quot; said Jack Shaughnessy , director_of_research at Advest . Much of the selling on Wall_Street was directed at big name stocks and smaller issues weathered the session slightly better .
