   <HEADLINE> RETRO ; MOVING_ON , AND ON , AND ON ; ROBERT CONRAD TAKES HIS ROLES SERIOUSLY...AND LIGHTLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fans always ask Robert Conrad the same question : Can he still fit into the skin-tight pants he wore 30 years ago on the Western spoof &quot; The Wild , Wild_West &quot; ? &quot; The answer is yes , &quot; the 58-year-old Conrad says with a hearty laugh . &quot; There were times in the last 28 years where I couldn ' t . But I have gotten myself to where I am happy. &quot; Conrad played sexy James T . West , an undercover_agent for President Ulysses S . Grant , on the series , which aired on CBS from 1965-69 . The late Ross Martin played his sidekick and master of disguise , Artemus Gordon . The two traveled_to their various assignments on a specially equipped railroad_car . Repeats of the series recently began on cable ' s TNT and Conrad couldn ' t be happier . &quot; I think its deja_vu with me , &quot; he says . &quot; This is a hoot for me only because I remember some of the reviews . I remember all_the producer changes . It was a unique show for me . The show that wasn ' t supposed to work , works . I feel_like the battery I used to represent . I feel_like the Energizer . I am going_on and on and on. &quot; Ross Martin , Conrad says affectionately , would be thrilled with the longevity of the &quot; Wild West. &quot; &quot; He was a unique guy who went way too early . I ' ve always had a good feeling about this show in spite of all_the producers . ( Creator ) Mike Garrison was fired and rehired and then died . Bruce Lansbury came_in and he was such a good guy. &quot; Off camera , Conrad admits , the series was chaos . &quot; It was made in six days and their leading man had a tendency to party hard , party real hard . It was a tough shoot. &quot; According to Conrad , Warner Bros. , which just completed the film version of the classic TV Western &quot; Maverick , &quot; has a &quot; Wild_West &quot; theatrical feature in development . &quot; There ' s a very strong ' Wild_West ' fan club out of Indianapolis , &quot; he says . &quot; Whomever does the role is going_to be scrutinized by them. &quot; Though James Garner , who played Bret Maverick on the series , is appearing in the &quot; Maverick &quot; movie , Conrad isn ' t sure he ' ll be involved with the &quot; Wild_West &quot; movie . &quot; I ' ve had opportunities to do the show again , conversations about doing_it as a TV series again . But I would n ' t do_it without Ross Martin . The bottom_line is I would do the feature based on the material . I don ' t need the money and I would n ' t want to associate myself with something that really has become more important to me in its death than it ever was in its life. &quot; Conrad says he was shocked when he landed the role of James West . He was the 17th out of 18 actors auditioning for the role . So how did he get the part ? &quot; I have kind of an attitude on and off camera , &quot; Conrad acknowledges . &quot; that ' s what they bought . The only guy being considered for the role I was concerned about never showed_up . He was , and is , a man I admire , John Derek. &quot; The series , he says , went_off the air because of the pressure put_on the network by former Democratic Sen . John Pastore , who deemed the series too violent . &quot; I was in Rochester , N.Y. , doing a Shriner ' s Crippled Children ' s ( Hospital ) benefit and got a call from the president of CBS . He said we are not going_forward with the show . We had a 33 share ! &quot; But Conrad thought it was time to move_on . &quot; Though I take acting lightly , sometimes I take it very seriously . It was time to move_on and we did. &quot; And Conrad has done quite well . Since &quot; Wild_West &quot; was canceled , he ' s starred in the series &quot; Black_Sheep Squadron &quot; ( a.k.a. &quot; Baa Baa Black_Sheep &quot; ) and &quot; High Mountain Rangers . For the last 13 years , Conrad has had his own successful production company and produced and directed numerous TV movies . One of the most popular TV movies in which he starred and produced was the 1985 thriller &quot; Two Fathers , &quot; in which he played a macho steelworker who teams_up with a stuffy executive ( George Hamilton ) to capture the man who murdered their children at a pre-wedding party . The sequel , &quot; Two Fathers : Justice for the Innocent , &quot; airs Friday on NBC . This time around , the dads team_up again when the man escapes_from prison . &quot; I play Stanley Kowalski in ' Two Fathers , ' &quot; Conrad says , laughing . &quot; George Hamilton -- there is a very debonair dude . He has the perfect gray on the sides ( of his hair ) . He has a magnificent suntan . There ' s a line in the movie where I say , &quot; I am proud and 60. ' It was written , ' We are proud and 60. ' George said : ' No . No . No. ' So I changed the line . Now I say to George : ' I am pushing 60 and you are not too far away from Leisure World yourself. ' &quot; &quot; The Wild , Wild_West &quot; airs Saturdays at 7 and 8 a.m. on TNT ; &quot; Two Fathers : Justice for the Innocent &quot; airs Friday at 9 p.m. on NBC .</TEXT>
