   <HEADLINE> THE VALLEYS ' SUPPORTING ROLES ; HOLLYWOOD KEEPS COMING_BACK TO THIS AREA TO FIND A WIDE VARIETY OF SETTINGS FOR MOVIE AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; A rock is a rock , a tree is a tree -- shoot it in Griffith Park ! &quot; -- Abe Stern , film_producer and uncle of Carl Laemmle , founder of Universal Studios At old Mission San Fernando , Jane Wyman marries Cesar Romero in the kind of ceremony that the mission ' s Franciscan fathers didn ' t exactly have_in_mind when they built the chapel back in 1797 . This wedding is strictly make-believe , recorded by cameras for a 1986 episode of CBS-TV ' s &quot; Falcon Crest. &quot; &quot; It even made the front page of the National Enquirer ! &quot; Kevin Feeney , the mission ' s business manager , recalls . In the Antelope Valley , a_few residents gather beneath a glitzy , Las Vegas-style marquee bearing the name of singer Vic Damone . They ask someone how they can obtain tickets to Damone ' s concert . Alas , there are neither tickets nor concert . The marquee is a prop for the 1991 feature_film &quot; The Marrying Man , &quot; starring Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin . In the San Fernando Valley community of Lake View Terrace , a medical facility turned film-and-TV set has served motion_pictures such_as &quot; Terminator 2 : Judgment_Day &quot; &quot; Postcards From the Edge &quot; and &quot; Another 48 Hours &quot; -- not far , incidentally , from the scene of a video watched by millions around the world : the beating of Rodney G . King by Los Angeles police_officers . And on leafy Orion Avenue in Van Nuys -- whose white picket_fences , spacious lawns and shuttered Cape_Cod houses have appeared in movies ( &quot; La Bamba &quot; and &quot; Big Trouble &quot; ) and TV series ( &quot; Dallas &quot; and &quot; CHiPs &quot; ) -- a homeowner recalls an early morning when her teen-age son burst_out the door on his way to school , only to be startled by cameras on the front_porch shooting actor Peter Falk . &quot; Whoops ! I guess I ruined your shoot , &quot; the youngster said apologetically . Year after year , Hollywood comes calling -- sometimes in a neighborhood near you . And three stars of the show are every bit as venerable and versatile as top-drawer character_actors . They are the San Fernando , Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys , which have appeared in so many productions -- from blockbuster films to TV series to videos to commercials -- that they deserve their very own stars on the sidewalks of Hollywood Boulevard . Indeed , the list of on-location sites -- even predating ex-New Yorker Carl Laemmle ' s transformation of a 230-acre chicken ranch in 1914 to what is now Universal City -- seemingly stretches as long as Hollywood Boulevard : Griffith Park ( &quot; Batman , &quot; &quot; Bonanza , &quot; &quot; Rebel Without a Cause &quot; ) , the Van Nuys Airport ( &quot; Casablanca &quot; ) , the Iverson Ranch in Chatsworth ( &quot; Ben-Hur , &quot; &quot; Rin Tin Tin &quot; ) , Malibu Creek State Park , partly in Agoura ( &quot; M * A * S * H * , &quot; &quot; How Green Was My Valley &quot; ) , the Sepulveda Veterans Affairs Medical_Center in North Hills ( &quot; Altered States , &quot; &quot; Knots Landing &quot; ) , East Palmdale Boulevard ( &quot; Radio Flyer &quot; ) , and the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in Van Nuys ( &quot; Rising Sun , &quot; &quot; Murder , She Wrote &quot; ) , among myriad others . Then , too , countless private residences and estates provide settings as dramatic as Mediterranean villas or Tudor mansions , which look as if they ' re in Connecticut or New Jersey . Or , many locations appear as perfectly mundane as the &quot; Leave It to Beaver &quot; set or any other house that might pass for Anywhere , U.S.A. Each has been deployed again and again by producers and directors who often anchor their flings of fantasy in real-life , everyday places . There , production companies pay homeowners and landlords rental fees ranging from $ 250 to upward of $ 15 # 000 a day , noting that they ' ll probably have to rearrange walls , furnishings and sometimes even landscaping , but promising to restore all properties exactly to the way they were . Actually , their work begins months earlier when scouts for the Los Angeles area ' s 40-odd location companies try to match real-life sites with those described in scripts . They bird-dog neighborhoods and study huge books of wide-angle color photos in quest of a perfect match . Example : One scout recently examined photos at Real to Reel Inc. , a Los Angeles location agency , hoping to find what he called &quot; a 1947 kitchen &quot; for a work-in-progress titled &quot; Roswell , &quot; about tales of UFOs landing near Roswell , N.M. And whenever on-location shooting won ' t work , filmmakers rely_on back lots and sound stages such_as those at Universal Studios Hollywood , Warner Bros . and Walt Disney Corp . in Burbank or Santa Clarita Studios . Or they turn_to recycled locations such_as the National_Park_Service ' s Paramount Ranch , deep in the hardscrabble hills of south Agoura and the setting for 1930s films such_as &quot; Adventures of Marco Polo &quot; and &quot; The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. &quot; Amid rickety facades that hark_back to the wild , wild_West , CBS-TV ' s &quot; Dr. Quinn , Medicine Woman &quot; dominates production so_much nowadays that Alice Allen , who issues permits to do film or TV work_at the Paramount Ranch facility , quips , &quot; The doctor is in residence here. &quot; It ' s not by accident that the three valleys -- especially the San Fernando Valley -- turn_up on millions of big and small screens across America , sometimes with a presence as indelible as John Wayne swaggering to an Oscar in the 1969 motion_picture &quot; True Grit. &quot; More movie-making and television production occurs in the Valley than in any other single area of Los Angeles , author Richard Alleman writes in &quot; The Movie Lover ' s Guide to Hollywood &quot; -- the Valley accounting_for about one-third of film and TV production in all_of the city , says Hollywood film historian Marc Wanamaker . &quot; First , you had many studios in the Valley -- then came the studio ranches and all_the other locations , &quot; says Wanamaker , now at_work on a history of U.S. motion-picture studios . With their craggy hills , sprawling desert , crowded urbanscape and assorted foliage ( which enables filmmakers to shun , if they need to , Southern California ' s patented &quot; palm_tree &quot; look ) , the three valleys have offered filmmakers virtually unlimited choices . The busiest location ? Griffith Park , according to some location scouts and librarians at the Hollywood-based California Film Commission . It ' s the setting for portions of feature_films such_as &quot; Hoffa , &quot; &quot; Poetic Justice , &quot; &quot; Dave &quot; and &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; as well as TV ' s &quot; MacGyver , &quot; &quot; The Wonder Years &quot; and &quot; Doogie Howser , M.D. , &quot; among many others . &quot; It ' s unbelievable how much filming goes_on there , &quot; says Czechoslovakian-born Paul Pav of North Hollywood , whose credits as a location manager include &quot; Lethal Weapon 3 , &quot; &quot; Poltergeist &quot; and &quot; Ghostbusters. &quot; &quot; In Griffith Park , you ' ve got New York , you ' ve got the South , you ' ve got whatever you want. &quot; Another site rich_in motion-picture lore is the Van Nuys Airport , the setting for portions of the 1942 Warner Bros . classic &quot; Casablanca. &quot; But stories about filming of the famous scene in which Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman , as World_War_II lovers , say goodby at a foggy Moroccan airstrip are shrouded in a fog of_their_own . While some published accounts say filming took_place at the Van Nuys Airport ( then known as Los Angeles Municipal Airport ) , others describe the location variously as the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport and Glendale ' s old Grand Central Air_Terminal , now part of an industrial_park . Actually , historian Wanamaker says , Bogart and Bergman bade farewell on a Burbank sound stage , with the takeoff created by special_effects and a miniature plane . Another film historian , Dick Mason of Warner Bros. , chuckles at the confusion . &quot; Embellishment is the name of the game among people in this business , &quot; he says . &quot; Everyone exaggerates. &quot; Elsewhere , a private house in Arleta served as a set_in &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; while Chatsworth ' s Iverson Ranch provided scenes for the spectacular chariot_race in 1959 ' s Oscar-winning &quot; Ben-Hur , &quot; for other films such_as &quot; Julius Caesar &quot; and &quot; The Robe &quot; and for TV series such_as &quot; Bat Masterson &quot; and &quot; Zane Grey Theater. &quot; And the Santa Clarita Valley takes_pride in its remote but high-profile Vasquez Rocks ( &quot; Battlestar Gallactica , &quot; &quot; Star Trek , &quot; &quot; Charge of the Light Brigade &quot; and Steven Spielberg ' s upcoming &quot; The Flintstones &quot; ) , while hundreds of Antelope Valley residents recall the winter night in 1992 when they watched parts of an abandoned , half-completed residential tract on Lancaster ' s outskirts go_up in flames after filmmakers received permission to burn 10 houses for a fiery scene in &quot; Lethal Weapon 3. &quot; &quot; Out here , we think we can offer just about any kind of location , &quot; says Stephanie Abrahamson , director of the Antelope Valley Film Assn . &quot; And if you want it , we can give you 360 degrees and not a human in sight. &quot; But today , pitching Southern California to filmmakers is a tough sell as Los Angeles struggles to remain the world ' s &quot; movie capital &quot; in the heat of competition from Canada , New York , Florida , Illinois and other venues . Permits issued by the city for on-location filmmaking declined 20 % between 1990 ( the peak year ) and 1992 , according to a report in Location Update , a monthly trade magazine published in Los Angeles . The problem stems from not just a flagging economy but what some call a &quot; user- unfriendly &quot; climate in some neighborhoods . &quot; L.A. residents , by no means in_awe_of an industry shoot , don ' t like the inconveniences it brings -- parking problems , late-night noise , trespassing , &quot; Location Update reports . For his part , location manager Pav says the prospect of Hollywood pitching camp in the neighborhood &quot; goes both ways. &quot; &quot; Some people will slam the door -- or they ' ll send their dogs after you , &quot; he says of_his_own scouting forays . &quot; On the other hand , some keep sending you pictures of their house with a note : ' Please ! Use my house ! ' They know it can be lucrative -- especially when the economy isn ' t so good. &quot; Even on that squeaky-clean block of Van Nuys ' Orion Avenue , on-site filmmaking has drawn mixed reviews from residents since the camera vans first rolled into the neighborhood 21 years ago for a network TV film , &quot; Go Ask Alice &quot; ( Andy Griffith , William Shatner and Julie Adams ) . &quot; For a while , we thought it was overdone -- people were out here shooting at 3 and 4 in the morning , for months at a time , &quot; says Jean Austin , a retired Hollywood hairdresser who adds that she has lived_on Orion Avenue for 30 years . &quot; Sometimes you have to say , ' Enough ! ' -- as much as we ' re all trying to keep filming in L.A. &quot; A few doors away , Keith and Marilyn Mullins contend that filmmaking on Orion Avenue is far more blessing than curse . &quot; It ' s always welcomed , &quot; says Keith Mullins , adding that their house served as a set for &quot; Go Ask Alice &quot; and for Great Western Savings ' TV spots featuring Dennis Weaver . &quot; The film companies do everything they can so we ' ll want them to come_back . Especially today , we don ' t want to lose them. &quot; Now , with Mayor Richard Riordan and newly appointed &quot; film czar &quot; Cody G . Cluff of the Los Angeles Film Commission leading the charge , the city has served notice that it intends to regain its filmmaking glitter . The applause is loudest among entrepreneurs such_as Jim Thompson , president of Real to Reel Inc. , and others who ' ve staked their futures on Valley-area and other filmmaking within the &quot; 30-mile zone , &quot; a radius from La Cienega and Beverly boulevards , beyond which production in Southern California is more expensive because of added labor costs . &quot; Cities such_as Toronto and Chicago have hurt us tremendously , &quot; says Thompson , 40 , who also is publisher / editor-in-chief of Location Update . &quot; But there ' s a feeling now that everything will turn_around again -- and that a lot of business will come_back to L.A. &quot; For now , Hollywood keeps calling with fistfuls of cash -- and the Griffith Parks , the Orion Avenues , the Vasquez Rocks , the East Palmdale Boulevards and the Paramount Ranches endure on the silver_screen and in living rooms across the land . For that matter , so does the work of Paul Pav , Real to Reel Inc. and all those other location scouts who keep scouring the neighborhoods and poring over those thick photo books in search of that perfect &quot; 1947 kitchen &quot; and other sites . They work with a painstaking zeal that continues to remind the San Fernando , Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys that , yes , they ought to be in pictures -- and in a way that keeps saying to them : &quot; Here ' s looking_at you , kid. &quot; Where Real Becomes Reel A sampling of on-location and studio sites in the San Fernando , Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys : SAN FERNANDO VALLEY Academy Plaza Theatre , 5200 Lankershim Blvd. , North Hollywood .
