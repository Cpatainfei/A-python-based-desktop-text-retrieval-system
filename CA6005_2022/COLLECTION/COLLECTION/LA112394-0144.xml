   <HEADLINE> AFTER RUMORS , BERLUSCONI LEARNS HE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION ; ITALY : THE BELEAGUERED PREMIER IS ACCUSED OF BRIBING TAX POLICE BEFORE ENTERING POLITICS . FOES CALL ON HIM TO RESIGN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After months of rumors , Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi learned from a newspaper Tuesday that he is under investigation for allegedly having bribed tax police before he entered politics . Formal word came as the beleaguered billionaire presided over an international conference here on ways to combat organized crime . The judicial notice does not imply guilt , but it does spell embarrassment . Whether the timing was contrived or simply ironic , it dealt a fresh blow to Berlusconi ' s sagging political fortunes -- and to public confidence in his government . Left-wing opponents called_for his resignation . Berlusconi said in a nationwide broadcast Tuesday night that he is innocent and will not quit . &quot; I will not resign . This country needs stability . . . a government that governs seriously , &quot; he said . In the flux , the Italian stock_market fell 2.8 % Tuesday , while the lira eased against the dollar and slumped briefly to historic lows against the German mark . As 800 delegates from 136 nations at a seaside palace here debated how to clean_up criminal money-laundering , Berlusconi , president of the U.N. crime conference , told reporters that he is untroubled by the corruption inquiry in Milan . &quot; I have never corrupted anyone . I have nothing to fear , &quot; he said in the taped broadcast . He called_on magistrates to concern themselves &quot; with justice , not politics. &quot; Berlusconi aides were outraged that news of the probe had been apparently leaked from the magistrates ' office to the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera , whose exclusive Tuesday morning stole the thunder from conference deliberations . &quot; Extremely grave , &quot; said Antonio Tajani , spokesman for Forza Italia , the political_movement Berlusconi heads . Tajani called it an attempt to influence voters before the Dec . 4 second round of municipal elections in more_than 200 cities . Forza Italia , which stormed to national power in the spring , fared poorly in first-round voting Sunday among Italians distressed by Berlusconi ' s austerity budget_for 1995 , which would trim pensions and health and social benefits . What concerns the Milan magistrates are bribes paid to tax inspectors by two of the many companies within Berlusconi ' s vast Fininvest business empire , a network of publishing , advertising , real_estate and insurance_companies , supermarkets and three national television channels . Berlusconi , who insists -- despite the cost to his popularity -- that government debt and deficit must be reduced , belittled the Milan probe as &quot; a six-month-long affair. &quot; Corriere said one payment of about $ 80 # 000 was made in 1991 to a general , a lieutenant_colonel and a warrant_officer in the Guardia di Finanza during inspection of company books at Arnoldo Mondadori Editore , the country ' s largest publishing_house . Berlusconi ' s brother Paolo and the head tax officer for Fininvest , Salvatore Sciascia , acknowledged making the payoff in testimony to the investigating magistrates in July . They claimed that the issue was not corruption but extortion ; payment was demanded under threat of disruption and possible economic paralysis of the company . The second incident , in 1992 , Corriere said , involved Paolo Berlusconi , Sciascia and two other Fininvest managers , who paid about $ 60 # 000 to two brigadiers , a lieutenant_colonel and two warrant_officers in return for their approval of accounts at the insurance_company Mediolanum Vita . Once again the managers allege extortion by the tax police . Berlusconi echoes their accusation . He says the tax police took an extraordinary interest in Fininvest companies almost from the moment he declared himself a political candidate . One team of inspectors marched into the new Forza Italia headquarters in downtown Rome a_few days before the election that brought Berlusconi to power . For nearly three years , judges in Milan and other major cities have been investigating endemic corruption in which Italian businesses large and small routinely paid_off politicians and government officials in return for favors or government contracts . It was business and politics all ' italiana ; everybody knew , including voters whose exasperation finally overturned the system . Berlusconi , a 58-year-old self-made man , owns Fininvest , which did $ 7 billion in business last year . As more_than 3 # 000 prominent political and business figures have been implicated in the still-expanding judicial inquiries , there have been rumors that Berlusconi ' s name was bound to come_up . Ironically , he is a beneficiary of the political vacuum created by the corruption inquiry , which decimated Italy ' s Establishment political_parties . When it seemed that the political left led by former communists would win national elections in March , Berlusconi created his free-market Forza Italia movement to counter it , modeling the party organization after fan clubs for his A.C. Milan soccer team . He won resounding electoral victory and formed a government in May in right-wing alliance with northern federalists and neo-fascists . It has been tough sledding ever since , amid internal squabbles and growing popular antagonism to his economic measures . The disputed budget , which drew more_than 1 million protesters to Roman streets earlier this month , is now before the Senate . A national general strike is scheduled for Dec . 2 . Berlusconi , who went_to Rome on Tuesday night to greet visiting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , returns here today for the final meeting of a conference he hopes will agree to establish an international anti-crime academy in Italy .</TEXT>
