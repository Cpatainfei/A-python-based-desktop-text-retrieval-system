   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEWS ; ' ROOMMATES ' WITH AIDS LEARN TOLERANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Finally , a movie about AIDS that dramatizes the democratic nature of the disease -- specifically , a heterosexual who is homophobic to the core and dying of AIDS . In NBC ' s &quot; Roommates , &quot; Randy Quaid , as a scruffy ex-con who contacted AIDS from a blood_transfusion , is the wise-cracking , hard-drinking half of an &quot; odd couple &quot; sharing an apartment in a complex run_by an AIDS action committee as a home for people with the disease . Quaid ' s roommate , a sudden intrusion , is played by Eric Stoltz as a dapper Ivy League-educated homosexual who leaves the East Coast comfort of a loving but uncomprehending family to gain some control over his final months . * Initially full of mutual disdain , the roommates regard one other with cultural snobbery and stereotypical intolerance . One reads &quot; Moby Dick &quot; and wears neckties , while the other smokes , drinks and watches sports on a blaring TV . It ' s a match made in hell but one gradually , genuinely transformed by mutual needs that flowers into durable friendship . Of course , you just know early on that compassion and acceptance will supplant ignorance and prejudice . But the way these characters come_to be soul_mates feels right , instead of overly contrived . Robert Lenski ' s teleplay and Alan Metzger ' s direction avoid land_mines of sentimentality with a narrative full of surprises ( a hilarious pool game ) and candid emotions . Aside from its strong acting and technical polish , the production ' s thematic achievement is twofold : ( 1 ) it demolishes the myth that AIDS is a gay disease , and ( 2 ) it refreshingly punctures holes in the prejudices of both straights and gays ( but mostly straights ) . * &quot; Roommates &quot; airs at 9 tonight on NBC ( Channels 4 , 36 and 39 ) .
