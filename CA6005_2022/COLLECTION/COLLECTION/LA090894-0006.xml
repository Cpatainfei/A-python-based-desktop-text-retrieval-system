   <HEADLINE> STATE SMOKING RESTRICTIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In reference_to your Aug . 30 editorial on Prop . 188 , &quot; Half-Truths Cloaked in Slickness &quot; : Misled or not , all voters who signed a petition to qualify Prop . 188 for the ballot should now vote no . When these petitions were circulating , Assembly Bill 13 , a statewide smoking restriction bill sponsored by Assemblyman Terry Friedman ( D-Brentwood ) , was given little chance for passage . In a show of courage against the powerful tobacco lobby , both houses passed the bill and Gov . Pete Wilson signed it into law on July 21 . AB 13 does exactly what Prop . 188 claims to do but does not : provides real protection from secondhand smoke for the great majority of Californians who do not smoke . It also has the practical effect of establishing a uniform statewide regulation while not denying localities the right to establish stricter regulations ( few , if any , will because AB 13 already prohibits smoking in virtually all workplaces , including restaurants ) . The proponents of Prop . 188 ( i.e. , Philip Morris ) are disingenuous when they argue that a &quot; uniform &quot; tobacco control act is needed . The fact is , one already exists . . . as long as Prop . 188 does not pass . Because one of the worst aspects of Prop . 188 is that it would supersede AB 13 , and cement a tobacco company marketing ploy into our state Constitution instead . RONALD M . GWYNN Orange * Your editorial is a good_example of why Prop . 188 should be approved by the voters . You cleverly try to give the opinion that Philip Morris Inc. has misled the public into thinking that Prop . 188 is something that it ' s not . Prop . 188 is clearly written and easy for anyone to understand . We need uniform state laws for smokers and nonsmokers . Some cities haven ' t gone_far enough . Other cities such_as Davis have gone_to the extreme , making_it illegal to smoke within 30 feet from any building , which in reality benefits no one ' s health . Prop . 188 is a sensible solution to a problem that should have been solved years ago . It should be approved on Nov . 8 . DARWIN SEAMONS Whittier * Few sights are more ironic than that of conservatives clamoring for their &quot; civil rights. &quot; Even as the right continues trying to deny freedom of choice to women , protection from discrimination to gay and lesbian people , and separation of church and state to schoolchildren , former Reagan aide Aram Bakshian Jr . is actually complaining that the government isn ' t freely indulging Americans ' right to smoke ( Column Right , Sept . 1 ) ! I ' m sure his ACLU card is in the mail . MICHAEL CHASKES Los Angeles * Bakshian is off base on several items . First , as an &quot; anti-smoking zealot &quot; I do not wish to pass a tobacco version of Prohibition . Higher taxes ( to pay_for the increased use of Medicare dollars ) , and a ban on smoking in public will be adequate . And whether or not one believes the evidence that secondhand smoke causes cancer and heart_disease , it is undeniable that for the millions of people with asthma and respiratory ailments , tobacco smoke , even in small doses , is quite dangerous . Additional medication , associated side_effects and possible long-term complications do result . And while eating junk food is bad for you , nobody else is harmed . So , Mr. Bakshian , I say to you -- take your cigar and smoke it in the privacy of your home , but stay out of public places when you must indulge . You can venture out there whether or not you are smoking , but there are others who are condemned to stay inside , in private , because they cannot be where others are smoking . STEPHEN M . GREENBERG MD Santa Monica</TEXT>
