   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; GLOBAL POWERS ONCE AGAIN PARALYZED BY BOSNIA CRISIS ; BALKANS : SERBS BOAST OF STARING_DOWN NATO . WORLD LEADERS can ' t SQUARE FEAR OF QUAGMIRE WITH DESIRE TO END THE KILLING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After almost 3 # 000 dead or wounded in Gorazde , after another &quot; safe haven &quot; has been trampled , after NATO ' s threat of massive force has thus far produced only limited air strikes , the international community has reverted to fretful paralysis over what to do about Bosnia . The U.N. Protection Force remains handcuffed by a mandate to keep peace in a country where there is none . Relief organizations still must wheedle and negotiate with the dominant Bosnian Serb rebels to get food , medicine and shelter to the war ' s civilian victims . And the world_powers that chose humanitarian intervention over halting the bloodshed when it began are searching for an easy way_out of the tragedy that becomes more difficult and costly to rectify with each passing day . More_than two years after the outbreak of the worst violence in Europe since World_War_II , world leaders still cannot square their fears of being drawn into an endless conflict with a nagging desire to do something to make the killing of innocents stop . The most dangerous consequence of the Gorazde crisis , which rocketed to the political fore this month , may be the message drawn by the Bosnian Serbs that they can take_on the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization and win . Air strikes launched April 10 and 11 were limited displays of the Western alliance ' s power . But their intended lesson was grossly distorted by propagandists who mold Serbian public_opinion . Rebel leaders -- like the hard-line Bosnian Serb commander Gen . Ratko Mladic , already inflated with overconfidence from having rolled_over poorly armed government troops in a lopsided blood bath -- now boast of having stared_down mighty NATO . &quot; No one can save us from the Serbs now ! &quot; wailed a frightened Muslim woman evacuated from Gorazde to Sarajevo on Monday as part of a U.N.-organized airlift . The commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia , Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , has invoked a new motto for the peacekeeping mission with his declaration that he has no intention of &quot; bombing our way to peace , &quot; despite the Bosnian Serbs ' lukewarm compliance with a NATO edict to withdraw from around Gorazde . Cmdr . Eric Chaperon , a U.N. spokesman , said Monday that all Bosnian Serb artillery was believed to have been pulled_back 1.9 miles from Gorazde , although he conceded that some Bosnian Serb troops had still not withdrawn . A further test of Serbian compliance will come tonight when another NATO deadline expires ; the rebels are to have moved all_of their heavy artillery at least 12 miles from Gorazde by 2:01 a.m. Wednesday ( 5:01 p.m. today PDT ) . There are fears among U.N. officers , Rose included , that the Serbs may simply redeploy the tanks and artillery banished from Gorazde to other vulnerable areas they are known to covet for their emerging state of Greater Serbia . &quot; If I were Mladic , I ' d hit somewhere else fast , as soon as I could get everything moved_up there , &quot; one U.N. officer said . He speculated that the next target could be the area around Brcko , which the rebels want to widen the territorial connection between land conquered in eastern Bosnia and in Croatia . By turning_a_blind_eye to recalcitrant rebels who burned homes and blasted utilities as they beat a grudging retreat , Rose calmed the NATO demand for immediate punishment that would probably lead to an escalated conflict between his 15 # 000-strong peacekeeping force and the radicalized Serbs . The U.N. Protection Force is deployed to Bosnia for humanitarian purposes only , and any action seen as partial to the government would prompt the Serbs to declare war on the peacekeeping mission . But some here believe the United Nations is simply postponing the inevitable in refusing to take sides in the deadly conflict , which most world leaders say was provoked by nationalist Serbs . This week ' s meetings in London and Geneva to devise a Western strategy for the Bosnian crisis seem to underscore that there has so far been no consensus or definition of policy and objectives . Even NATO and the U.N. peacekeeping force have shown themselves at_odds over how they should respond to blatant and destabilizing displays of aggression . When NATO commanders sought to order air strikes against Bosnian Serbs who defied the withdrawal ultimatum Sunday , Yasushi Akashi , the civilian chief of the U.N. Protection Force , rejected the appeal as unnecessary because he had reached separate and more lenient terms for compliance with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic . Akashi also apparently softened the NATO order for Serbs to grant unhindered freedom of movement to U.N. troops and humanitarian organizations , allowing the rebels to resume their harassing insistence on clearance for vehicles , aircraft and aid personnel . Letting the Bosnian Serbs win their first round with NATO also risks encouraging them to stand tough in future faceoffs , which even the most optimistic U.N. officers are already bracing for . Western mediators and leaders continue to believe peace talks will one day lead to a negotiated resolution of the war , despite the numerous failed diplomatic initiatives involving the Bosnian Serbs and their allies in Serbia . With no credible threat of force to stop their advances , and dwindling U.N. options for even maintaining an illusion of keeping the peace , the conflict in Bosnia appears fated to continue with political_leaders talking in faraway capitals while their warlords fight on .</TEXT>
