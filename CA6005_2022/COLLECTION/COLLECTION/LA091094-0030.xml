   <HEADLINE> BOARD REPRIMANDS LIBRARY PRESIDENT ; MONTEREY PARK : PANEL REACTS AFTER OFFICIAL MADE RACIALLY TINGED COMMENTS AT A MEETING . SHE IS ASKED TO APOLOGIZE TO THE COMMUNITY OR RESIGN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Monterey Park ' s library board called_on its president to apologize or resign Thursday after she threw a cup of water at a Chinese American activist and threatened others with her walking stick . &quot; Watch_out . I have a club and I am apt to use it , &quot; board President Kathleen Brzozowski warned as she left the crowded meeting room after throwing the cup in the direction of Laura Lee , chairwoman of the Chinese American Civil Liberties Organization . Lee later filed a police complaint against Brzozowski . The board president was under_attack for racially tinged comments she made in July concerning fellow library board_member Marina Tse , a prominent member of the city ' s sizable Asian community . According to the 1990 census , 56 % of Monterey Park ' s residents are of Asian descent . The incident was the latest in a racially charged dispute that began in April with the resignation of Jeanette Cheng , the city ' s first Chinese American librarian . The dispute escalated in July when the board president denied allegations that trustees were trying to oust Tse for her lone opposition to Cheng ' s resignation . At that time , Brzozowski said Tse had been misrepresenting her position , adding that Tse had a &quot; problem understanding English , &quot; was not suited to be a trustee and should take a &quot; low position until she can speak the language. &quot; Tse is a special_education teacher with a master ' s degree from USC . She was recently appointed to a state special_education commission by Gov . Pete Wilson . &quot; This is the worst insult I have ever had , &quot; she said Thursday . About 30 members of the city ' s Asian and Latino communities attended Thursday ' s meeting to hear the debate over the racial issue . But when the board came_to that item on the agenda , Brzozowski said she could not stay . A member of the audience accused her of trying to &quot; chicken out. &quot; At that point , she threw the cup and stalked out , wielding her stick_in front of her . Several police_officers later arrived_at City_Hall to question witnesses . Police are investigating Lee ' s complaint , Capt . Jim Strait said Friday . After Brzozowski ' s departure and speeches from community activists demanding her resignation , a motion was approved stating that the president ' s comments were not the board ' s view and that she should be asked to apologize or resign . &quot; She owes an apology to the community and if she can ' t bring herself to do that then she should resign , &quot; said trustee Joseph Ruben , who authored the motion . Brzozowski did not answer calls to her home Friday . &quot; Does she want ( Tse ) to be a maid , a cleaning lady , a bus girl ? &quot; Lee asked . &quot; This kind of remark is not only an insult to Ms . Tse , it also offends me and many hard-working , first generation immigrants. &quot;</TEXT>
