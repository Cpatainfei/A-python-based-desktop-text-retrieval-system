   <HEADLINE> PUBLIC HEALTH ; TOBACCO FIRMS ' INTENT IS KEY TO FEDERAL CONTROL ; FDA IS INSISTING THAT THE INDUSTRY BOOSTS NICOTINE LEVELS TO KEEP SMOKERS HOOKED . BUT COMPANIES SAY IT ' S FOR TASTE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ultimately , when the battle over federal regulation of cigarettes is decided , it may all come_down to intent . What are the intentions of the tobacco_industry when it controls nicotine levels in cigarettes ? To keep smokers hooked , as the government believes ? Or to maintain taste and flavor , as the companies insist ? The final interpretation likely will determine whether the Food and Drug Administration has the power to regulate cigarettes -- more precisely , nicotine in cigarettes -- as it does drugs . No one challenges the fact that the tobacco_industry controls and manipulates nicotine levels . &quot; The whole dispute is about why they do_it , &quot; said Matthew Myers , an attorney for the anti-smoking Coalition on Smoking OR Health . &quot; Sure the companies adjust tar and nicotine levels , &quot; said Tobacco Institute spokesman Walker Merryman . &quot; They have to , in_order to produce a consistent product. &quot; Federal law defines a drug as a substance intended to diagnose , treat , cure or prevent disease . In 1938 , when Congress amended the 32-year-old food and drug law , it added language to enable the agency to regulate other items , such_as weight loss products , as drugs . Thus , a drug also is defined as a substance , other_than food , &quot; intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. &quot; Nicotine is considered a drug -- and regulated by the FDA -- when it is used in patches , gum and other prescription products that are designed -- intended -- to help individuals stop smoking . But it has never been regulated in cigarettes . Many experts agree that nicotine does have pharmacologic , or drug-like , affects . But they disagree over how addictive it is . In 1988 , Surgeon_General C . Everett Koop declared nicotine to be as addictive as cocaine and heroin . Tobacco_industry officials insist it is not addictive at all . &quot; There is no question that nicotine affects your brain and your brain chemistry , &quot; said a senior FDA official . &quot; But the manufacturer has to intend to affect the structure and function. &quot; &quot; If the industry could present a persuasive case that nicotine is only about taste , then the FDA would have a hard_time showing that they intended for it to affect the body , &quot; said Myers , whose coalition is made_up of the American Heart Assn. , American Lung Assn . and American Cancer Society . &quot; What has changed is the ever-mounting evidence of the industry ' s complete understanding of the extent to which nicotine affects the body and our knowledge of the industry ' s technical ability to carefully control the level of nicotine. &quot; But one lawyer knowledgeable in food and drug law , who declined to be identified because his firm represents tobacco interests , said the FDA is using the industry ' s knowledge that nicotine is present in cigarettes as a hook &quot; to slide into &quot; the question of intent . He also pointed_out that the industry began making cigarettes long before it knew about nicotine and its effect on the body . &quot; If you continue to be aware that something is there , it becomes difficult to say you bear no responsibility for it , &quot; he acknowledged . Nevertheless , &quot; the tobacco companies say , ' Yes , we have more knowledge now that nicotine is present , and that it was always present . But you ' re telling us that , way back in 1922 , we intended this ? Even though we didn ' t know about it ? ' All of the internal industry research documents that have been made public -- either through leaks to the media or from Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce panel on health -- tend to support the FDA ' s position that the industry is not adjusting nicotine levels for taste . They show the companies ' own research , memos and other papers preoccupied with the pharmacologic effects of nicotine -- not with its relationship to taste or flavor . &quot; We never expected . . . to have evidence of intent , &quot; says the senior FDA official . &quot; If you control and manipulate nicotine levels , that ' s an indicator of intent . that ' s why we focused_on control and manipulation . What has happened here . . . is that documents from the industry go directly to the issue of intent , which is much more direct evidence. &quot; FDA officials believe the agency already has jurisdiction over cigarettes through the provisions in the law . But many observers predict the FDA almost certainly will be thwarted or delayed by legal challenges filed by the industry and others if and when it attempts to act . Some say the agency ' s best chance to regulate cigarettes is for Congress to amend the law spelling_out such specific power . &quot; The FDA is a bureaucratic entity , and I believe it is incapable of doing anything on this within ( FDA Commissioner ) David ( A. ) Kessler ' s lifetime , even if he outlasts some of the old-timers , &quot; said one lawyer familiar_with food and drug law . &quot; But it does not mean that the FDA will not cause things to happen , or cause Congress to get interested. &quot; But , noting that the momentum against tobacco has been building , he added : &quot; Will they issue a ruling that ultimately will be put into effect ? It could take years . And the court proceedings will take additional years . And by the time the process moves toward culmination , the circumstances might have changed in such a way that the FDA ' s original approach might not even seem worth doing. &quot;</TEXT>
