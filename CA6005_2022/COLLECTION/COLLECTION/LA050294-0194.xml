   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A ; THE INS AND OUTS OF THE PROXY_FIGHT ; Q &amp; A : JOHN WILCOX , CHAIRMAN OF A PROXY SOLICITATION FIRM , DISCUSSES WHAT SOME O.C. COMPANIES HAVE RECENTLY FACED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The era of hostile corporate takeovers may be over , but the proxy_fight lives on . Orange County has seen its share of proxy_fights , which can be anything from a battle for the control of a company ' s board of directors to a vote on a management proposal to increase executive compensation . Earlier this year , dissident shareholder Rafi Khan lost a bid to take_control of Costa Mesa-based ICN Pharmaceuticals from founder Milan Panic . And just last week , two other local companies -- Gateway Communications in Irvine and US Facilities Corp . in Costa Mesa -- faced the prospect of proxy_fights when shareholder groups threatened to take_control of the companies ' boards . John Wilcox , 51 , chairman of New York proxy solicitation firm Georgeson &amp; Co. , said such fights are less frequent than in the 1980s , but shareholders are still very involved . And soliciting proxies -- the forms used to cast votes_in corporate elections -- is easier than before , thanks to rule changes made by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in October , 1992 . At any given time , Georgeson has about 650 clients -- either company executives who want to stay in control or dissident shareholders who want to change a corporation ' s leadership or its management policies . More frequently , though , companies hire Georgeson -- or competitors such_as D.F. King &amp; Co. , also based in New York -- to find_out who its shareholders are and why they are buying or selling the company ' s stock , Wilcox said . In a telephone_interview last week , Wilcox spoke about proxy_fights , how they work and what is involved . * QUESTION : What distinguishes a proxy_fight from a takeover_attempt such_as a tender_offer ? ANSWER : A tender_offer differs from a proxy_fight in that cash is put_down on the table . Cash is king . If you ' ve got arguments competing with cash , cash will always win . In a proxy_fight , it ' s much more like a political_campaign . Two sides are presenting arguments and vying for the votes of shareholders at the annual shareholders meeting . Not all proxy_fights are for control of a board too . Many deal with how shareholders should vote on management proposals . * Q : How does a proxy_fight usually start and then proceed ? A : There are some variations because of the new proxy rules . Let me explain what has happened with the 1992 proxy rule amendments . Those amendments make_it possible for a shareholder to conduct a communications campaign that is unregulated so_long as the shareholder is not seeking proxy voting authority on a proxy card of_his_own . That has created a hybrid kind of communications campaign that has come_to be known as a &quot; just vote ' no ' campaign. &quot; In fact , it can be used for a lot of other things than getting shareholders to vote &quot; no &quot; on management proposals . It can be used in support of shareholder proposals to pressure management to do certain things . Under the old rules , any communication that influenced the way somebody voted_in an election was regulated . You had to get permission from the SEC and so forth . Under the new rules , things are much more liberal and flexible for the shareholder . You have to take that into account . Last year , in the 1992-93 proxy season , the most publicized use of this type of campaign was the State of Wisconsin Investment Board ' s effort to influence shareholders to withhold their votes from those directors of Paramount Communications who were_on the compensation committee . The State of Wisconsin Investment Board argued that the CEO was overpaid given the performance of the company . Therefore , the directors who worked_on the committee should have their votes withheld . That campaign was unsuccessful , but it did achieve a fair amount of publicity . It could not have occurred under the old rules . * Q : The problem with being regulated was that it slowed things down ? A : It slowed the shareholder down , and there were some costs involved in preparing filings and getting lawyers involved and collecting information for the SEC documents . It was rigid ; now it ' s more flexible . * Q : What kinds of costs does a company incur in a proxy_fight ? A : Usually , proxy_fight costs include lawyers , printing and mailing , proxy solicitors , telephone expenses for calls to shareholders . If there is litigation , then you get open-ended legal costs . There may be advertising and public relations costs as well . . . . Costs are also influenced by who the shareholders are . Proxy costs have become easier as more stock is held by institutional investors . Then you can go_to the largest holder and reach a majority of shares without getting involved in an expensive , broad-based campaign aimed at individual shareholders . * Q : When were proxy_fights most popular ? A : The peak years were 1988 through 1990 . These new rules made_it much cheaper to wage proxy_fights like &quot; just vote ' no ' &quot; campaigns that can have a lot of impact , such_as draw attention to a company , send a message to management or destabilize it . For the past 15 years , the way people have invested has changed . In the old days , individual investors went_out and bought stock . Now , the money of individuals is being invested through intermediaries that are big investment pools like pension_funds and investment funds . These are the institutions . The activism of the institutions took_root in the takeover era of the 1980s . They were passive for many years . But as takeovers increased , so did concern that management was often guilty of not looking_after shareholder interests in fighting_off the takeovers . * Q : You do have a sense of the activism level now ? A : The focus_on anti-takeover issues and policy questions on governance characterized the early stage of the movement . In 1989 , CalPERS , the state public employees retirement_fund , wrote to the SEC complaining about the way the proxy rules worked . That started discussion of proxy rule reform that culminated in adoption of amendments on Oct . 15 , 1992 . They received more_than 1 # 200 letters , more_than on any other issue . Those rules created these changes , allowing shareholders to communicate with each other without regulation . Now the activist movement has moved from policy and takeover issues to performance , compensation and the role of the board of directors . Now you have a lot of discussion on a company ' s financial performance , its business plan and how it deals with problems . Is the compensation for executives excessive ? You see a lot of discussion of whether a board is made_up primarily of outsiders . How do they determine compensation ? How does the board monitor the CEO ' s performance ? Does the board own stock in the company and therefore have an interest identical with the shareholders ? These issues have a lot of room for common_ground between management and shareholders . * Q : Have the new rules changed the outcomes of proxy_fights ? A : There haven ' t been enough proxy_fights to tell yet . One case we were involved with was ICN Pharmaceuticals in its battle with Rafi Khan . If you look_at that one , you can see how complicated a proxy_fight can become . They ' re very company-specific and people-specific . It was about how Milan Panic ran the company and his own political career . It also had to do with the credibility of Khan . that ' s true for every battle for control . I don ' t think you ' ll see very much change in the win-loss record . * Q : Who wins ? A : We did a study from 1984 to 1990 . In 28 % of the cases , the challengers won , and the incumbents won 40 % of the time . In the other cases , there was a settlement or some unclear result . In 50 % of the contests , the challengers won or took_control of the company shortly thereafter . In 74 % , the challengers made some kind of impact or gain . * Q : Do you think corporate boards have become more responsible and independent ? A : I think they have become more informed . One development in recent years is the increasing recognition by senior management or the directors that they have the responsibility to manage their ownership base and their stock ' s activity in the market , as much as the attention devoted to operations . This is new thinking . * Q : Do you anticipate more SEC rule changes ? A : There is one chance . The State of Wisconsin Investment Board wrote the SEC in January requesting them to look_into how votes are tabulated and the disclosure of information about voting results at shareholder meetings . They asked that voting results be disclosed immediately instead of waiting for the next filing of documents with the SEC . They ' re also seeking access to voting records so they can verify the results . * Q : Are executive pay issues dying_down ? A : Not at all . Those are at the top of the list this season . . . . There is a huge debate about whether executives are paid too_much in this country . * Q : You ' ve done this for 20 years at Georgeson . What is it about this business you really like ? A : It ' s not just the proxy business . What we ' re dealing with here are fundamental issues of how power is shared , how businesses are run . During the debate over proxy rule reform , people focused_on core issues of corporate governance . There are issues that are at the heart of what we care about in the United States , at the heart of a democratic society . How do we share power and prevent it from being concentrated ? Companies are microcosms for society . People care very much about these issues . There is a lot of intellectual stimulation in this business . * Q : Are outside chairpersons becoming more popular ? Carmelo Santoro , an Orange County executive , has taken that role several times recently . A : Yes . That fits_in with the changing function of the board of directors . It ' s a hotly discussed topic . I ' m the chairman of Georgeson but not the chief_executive_officer . Our philosophy is that we bring different skills to the company . Some companies have temporary outside chairpersons for some reason or other , like in CEO turnover . General Motors Corp . said it is sometimes appropriate for non-executives to head a board . It is common in the United Kingdom to have a non-executive chairman . There is no right or wrong answer .</TEXT>
