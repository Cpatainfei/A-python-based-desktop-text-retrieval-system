   <TEXT> Just another Hollywood remake : While lawyers for the Hollywood Chamber_of_Commerce are trying to stamp_out rival walks of fame -- such_as Huntington Beach ' s new Surf Walk of Fame -- historian Ken Schessler has made an interesting discovery . He points_out that the book &quot; Famous First Facts &quot; states that the original walk of fame was established in 1929 at Rollins College in Winter Park , Fla . -- 30 years before Hollywood got the idea . We phoned Rollins , and spokeswoman Ann Mikell said the school ' s shrine is still going strong . &quot; This year we honored Maya Angelou , &quot; Mikell said . Rather than consisting_of glitzy stars , the Rollins walkway is made_up of stones , rocks and bricks from the homes of more_than 600 people , including such historical figures as William Shakespeare , Christopher Columbus , George_Washington and Abraham_Lincoln . &quot; We don ' t really have any Hollywood-type personalities , &quot; Mikell said . &quot; The closest might be Fred Rogers ( TV ' s Mister Rogers ) . He graduated from here. &quot; One other thing : Mikell said that Rollins College has no plans to demand that Hollywood shut_down its Johnny-come-lately Walk of Fame . * What ' s in a street name : West Los Angeles Drive and East Los Angeles Drive are two legs of the same street in a crime-ridden section of Vista , a northern San Diego County city . A resident recently suggested that some new names for the two might reduce crime . So , the City_Council has decided to survey residents of East Los Angeles Drive to see if they would favor their street being re-christened Vista Townsite Drive . And West L.A. Drive ? It will remain unchanged , reported Randy Dotinga in the Times Advocate of Escondido . &quot; I don ' t have a negative connotation when I hear ' West Los Angeles , ' &quot; explained Councilman Ted Cole . * Money-making postal ideas : Sounds like a contradiction in terms , we know . After all , the U.S. Postal Service had to be practically dragged kicking and screaming into issuing an Elvis stamp -- its biggest seller ever ( bringing_in $ 36 million last year ) . Postal services in several other countries had already immortalized the King . And , now , they are capitalizing on other American stars shunned by the Postal Service . Madonna is featured in stamps put_out by the nations of Gambia , St . Vincent and Grenada . A Marilyn Monroe stamp ? Well , you can write Tanzania for one . If it ' s a Bad Actors Series you wish to start , Sierra_Leone has Sylvester Stallone in &quot; Rocky III &quot; while Grenada has Dolly Parton , Madonna and Cher . Or if you want to begin a Celebrities- Who ' ve-Died-in-L.A. Series , you could combine Marilyn Monroe with Grenada ' s tribute to glum-faced singer Janis Joplin . The latter is a 90-cent stamp , in Eastern Caribbean dollars , of course . But because her first_name is misspelled &quot; Janice , &quot; it ' s probably worth at least $ 1.80. * Relief for classical_music haters : T.C. Cirillo sent along a business_card from a Lakewood chiropractor who specializes in several categories , including : &quot; Low Bach Pain. &quot; miscelLAny : The five most frequent reasons that the CHP tickets drivers in Southern California , according to Sgt . Ernie Garcia are : 1 . speeding , 2 . drunk driving , 3 . running a stop sign , 4 . tailgating and 5 . running a stoplight .</TEXT>
