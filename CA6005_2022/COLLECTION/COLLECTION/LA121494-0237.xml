   <HEADLINE> ITALIAN PREMIER GIVES TESTIMONY ; EUROPE : BERLUSCONI SPENDS MORE THAN SEVEN HOURS WITH MAGISTRATES . PROBE TARGETS ALLEGED PAYOFFS TO TAX INSPECTORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Asserting his innocence and vowing to remain in office , Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi gave marathon testimony Tuesday to magistrates in Milan investigating alleged payoffs to tax inspectors by his Fininvest business empire . Berlusconi turned_up at the Milan courthouse around noon on a misty winter ' s day and did not leave until more_than seven hours later . The foggy darkness that masked his departure was emblematic of the day in which a sitting Italian prime_minister was queried in a criminal case for the first time : Berlusconi , whisked_away in a limousine with its curtains drawn , said nothing . Neither did the magistrates , from their heavily protected fourth-floor chambers in the downtown courthouse . Berlusconi ' s alleged involvement in Fininvest bribery cases occurred before he entered politics and while he headed a media and commercial conglomerate with receipts of about $ 7 billion a year . The cases , involving alleged payoffs to tax inspectors totaling about $ 200 # 000 in 1990 and 1991 , are small potatoes among thousands involving big business , public officials and politicians in an unprecedented three-year investigation that has triggered a political revolution in Italy . But they could prove the straw that breaks the back of the young Berlusconi government . Amid partisan salvos between the magistrates and Berlusconi supporters , Umberto Bossi , a loose-cannon populist who is one of the key pillars of Berlusconi ' s right-wing government , talks openly of a new government within the next few weeks . Other members of Berlusconi ' s coalition are also showing signs of restiveness with a prime_minister who is under siege from all sides : His party lost local elections , organized labor wars against his economic austerity program that threatens to prune pensions , students are occupying high_schools around the country and even his Cabinet_ministers are lukewarm in their defense of the billionaire tycoon . At the courthouse , where questioning was interrupted only for a midafternoon coffee and brioche break , Berlusconi was interrogated by three magistrates , headed by Chief Prosecutor Francesco Saverio Borrelli . Analysts believe that the 58-year-old tycoon protested his innocence to the judges -- as he has to the Italian people in recent weeks . In an open_letter Tuesday morning to the business newspaper Il Sole-24 Ore , Berlusconi said he was meeting the judges &quot; with my head held high. &quot; &quot; I ' ve never corrupted anybody , ever , in any circumstances , &quot; he wrote , reiterating that he had no thoughts of resigning a post he assumed in May after a stunning electoral victory in his political debut . &quot; I have no intention of giving_up , &quot; he wrote . Berlusconi and the rest of Italy learned that he had been formally named in the Fininvest investigation , which also involves his brother Paolo , on Nov . 22 as the prime_minister chaired an international anti-crime conference in Naples . Word had been leaked to a newspaper from the judges ' office in Milan . Tuesday ' s long day of testimony came_in the context of an accelerating struggle between the magistrates and government_ministers who accuse the judges of becoming more political than judicial in their &quot; Clean Hands &quot; inquiry . About two weeks ago , an appeals court ruled that Clean Hands investigations involving Fininvest should be moved from Milan to the smaller city of Brescia to ensure a more objective inquiry . Then -- a thunderbolt -- Judge Antonio Di Pietro , the spearhead of the Clean Hands investigation , resigned last week after leading the inquiry for nearly three years . In the process he had become a national hero , the most respected public figure in Italy , according to the polls . In Milan , crowds rallied outside the courthouse last week to lament Di Pietro ' s departure . Tuesday , about 100 anti-Berlusconi protesters at the courthouse , a monument of Fascist architecture , were outnumbered by police as Berlusconi ' s motorcade swung through steel mesh gates now symbolic of a scandal that has implicated more_than 3 # 000 Italians , including business_leaders , politicians -- and more_than one prime_minister .</TEXT>
