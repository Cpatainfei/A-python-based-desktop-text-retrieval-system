   <HEADLINE> CONTROVERSY OVER BEAN FUTURES BOILS_OVER ; CHINA : A SENIOR BEIJING COMMODITIES_EXCHANGE OFFICIAL DENIES TRADERS ' CHARGES OF IRREGULARITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A group of Chinese futures traders has accused the fledgling Beijing Commodity_Exchange of irregularities and demanded an inquiry into allegations of fraud in the green_bean trade there . A senior exchange official denied the charges Friday and said the actions in_question were merely intended to curb speculation . The controversy highlights the confusing state of the futures industry in China . The government is allowing only a_few exchanges to stay in business , some after merging with smaller markets . Most have been ordered shut_down . The continuing clampdown is part of a government anti-inflation strategy designed to check price rises in key raw_materials . Scores of futures contracts_in commodities have been canceled . Beijing maintains that China ' s futures have been influenced by price manipulators and become a haven for hot money from inside China and overseas , and especially from Hong Kong and Taiwan . All brokerages with foreign funding have been shut and are not expected to reopen . The Shanghai Petroleum Exchange all but closed early this year after Beijing capped the price of refined oil products -- ending speculation altogether . In the new Beijing flap , a group of commodity traders sent an open_letter to the China Securities Regulatory Commission , the country ' s financial watchdog , demanding an inquiry into the allegations of irregularities by the exchange where they trade . The letter says the Beijing Commodity_Exchange made two controversial announcements in a span of 100 trading minutes , causing severe fluctuations in the price of the January 1995 contract for green , or mung , beans . &quot; This is like an emperor issuing an order in the morning and rescinding it in the evening , &quot; said one of the traders who organized the protest letter . The first notice , issued late Aug . 17 , banned compensation for buyers who had to take delivery of mung_beans older than those specified in their contracts . The move sparked a selloff . The second notice early the next day in_effect reversed the first , restoring compensation for a limited period . Traders , who were angered and confused by the move , said the exchange compounded the problem by posting the second notice well after morning trading had begun . The exchange executive defended its actions , saying the announcements were designed to curb speculation and that they did not send conflicting signals . &quot; This exchange is not a casino , &quot; he said . &quot; Our policy is reasonable and aims to prevent speculation . If no announcements had been made , Beijing would have become a garbage_dump for old mung_beans from the whole of China. &quot;</TEXT>
