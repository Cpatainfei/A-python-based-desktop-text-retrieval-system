   <TEXT> Re &quot; A Needless New Risk of Breast_Cancer , &quot; Commentary , March 20 : It was an egregious disservice to all consumers , and especially to women concerned about breast_cancer , for The Times to have provided a forum for Samuel S . Epstein ' s widely rejected attacks on the safety of bovine somatotropin ( BST ) . Epstein has so little credibility in the cancer research community that its major scientific organizations tire of responding to his many charges . Prompted by his most recent statements on BST , the American Cancer Society recently issued a statement declaring : &quot; Extensive testing and research has shown that rBST is indistinguishable from natural bovine growth_hormone and thus entails no risk for consumers . There are no valid scientific findings to indicate a risk of human carcinogenesis. &quot; In a written response to Epstein , the Food and Drug Administration was equally direct : &quot; Claims that IGF-1 in milk could result in premature development of breasts in young children and breast_cancer in adults are not only not substantiated in the scientific literature , but , in fact , have no basis in science. &quot; The harmless but scary-sounding insulin-growth factor ( IGF-1 ) Epstein refers to is simply a medical term for a protein that is naturally found in cow ' s milk , human milk , and saliva and other human_body fluids . ( All milk contains several natural , safe and completely digestible hormones. ) But more to_the_point , the FDA has concluded from detailed studies that IGF-1 is not increased . In short , neither BST nor IGF-1 poses any breast_cancer health risk . But in printing Epstein ' s latest pseudoscientific charge , The Times has caused untold scores of women to mistakenly believe something is dangerously wrong with their milk . The &quot; needless new risk , &quot; as your paper titled the article , isn ' t BST or IGF-1 -- it ' s the misinformation printed by newspapers that are either unwilling or unable to determine the veracity of the facts they provide their readers .
