   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER ; GAME_WARDEN BRAVES PERILS OF A DARK , MENACING WILDERNESS TO STALK NOCTURNAL POACHERS IN MT . BALDY ' S BACK_COUNTRY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On winter nights in the forest , as Orion the_Hunter mocks from the heavens in starry repose , the game_warden is listening . Darkness swallows the forest whole , robbing the warden of sight , playing tricks on his mind . In the stillness , the patter of deer hooves on brittle sycamore leaves is no longer charming , the graceless crashing of a black_bear through brush holds menace -- and the crack of a high-powered rifle is so sure that the warden sometimes imagines his heart caught in the cross-hairs . Mark Jeter , 34 , a state_Department of Fish and Game_warden , is_on overnight patrol for poachers in the Angeles National Forest ' s Mt . Baldy area , just north of Glendora . He has no partner , no reliable radio contact , no immediate backup . Every hunter he meets is armed and most likely up_to no good -- hunting at night for most animals is illegal . Through the forest ' s unforgiving back_country , his lonely patrol is one that most people never see -- and his job , Jeter says , is woefully misunderstood . People look_at the state seal on Jeter ' s four-wheel-drive in puzzlement . &quot; Fish and Game ? &quot; they ask . &quot; What kind of games ? &quot; Or they remember the September news coverage of wardens preparing to kill spa-hopping Samson the bear in Monrovia -- until Gov . Pete Wilson pushed for a reprieve . State officials finally found Samson a home at the Orange County Zoo . Or the day Jeter fired tranquilizer darts at a scared bear that lumbered through an Azusa neighborhood in May and then was shot to death by police . &quot; They call it ' fish and maim , ' &quot; lamented Jeter , a folksy Oklahoma native who lives_in Glendora with his wife and two children . &quot; ( They say ) , ' You ' re either killing something or sitting in a coffee shop. ' &quot; But there ' s no coffee_shop on Jeter ' s mountain beat -- the only coffee he gets is his own instant cappuccino out of a thermos . Fish and game_wardens also get a bad rap from other law_enforcement officers who dismiss them as &quot; critter cops. &quot; But wardens have the same legal authority and power of arrest as police_officers , and their work can be even more risky . * Game_wardens stand six times the chance of being assaulted with firearms as an officer on the street , according to a 1990 federal study . The U.S. Department_of_the_Interior study concluded that the game_warden ' s patrol is the country ' s most dangerous form of law_enforcement . In his third year as a game_warden , Jeter sets his own hours , working by land , sea and air . One day , he ' ll chase lobster poachers by skiff off Catalina Island or work a plainclothes detail at a swap meet , searching for illegal bear-claw jewelry ( It is legal to kill bears with the proper permits , but it is illegal to sell their parts ) . On another day , he ' ll put_on shorts and hiking boots and backpack eight miles into the woods in search of bighorn-sheep poachers . Or , on a busy hunting weekend , he ' ll patrol the forest by small plane . Of all his assignments , Jeter prefers night patrol in the forest , a prime_time for poachers who skulk through the canyons under the cover of darkness . Some kill black_bears and peddle their gallbladders -- for about $ 265 a gram -- for use in pricey Asian folk remedies for stomach problems and other ailments . In the Angeles National Forest , wardens have found only one bear recently with a sliced-out gallbladder , near Ojai . But in June , Jeter and other area wardens arrested a Rosemead businessman for allegedly trafficking hundreds of gallbladders , most from black_bears killed in other Western states . The arrest was the culmination of a 1 1 / 2-year undercover operation . In winter , when deer , bear and other large game animals are in season , Jeter patrols the forest about three nights a week for hunters . It ' s illegal to hunt most animals at night because the darkness gives hunters an unfair advantage , state fish and game officials say . Also , it is more dangerous to shoot in darkness . * For cover , Jeter dims his two-way radio light and kills his headlights . His Ford Bronco ' s grille is painted black so the chrome doesn ' t catch the moonlight . If he parks for a long_time , he pulls an olive-drab parachute over his truck and anchors it with a tree or rock to avoid a telltale silhouette . One night a week , under a blaze of stars , he camps_out on a portable cot in a sleeping bag , with a . 40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and flashlight at his side , a two-pound bulletproof_vest snug beneath his clothes . He sleeps fitfully , trying to shut_out the eerie scream of the mountain_lion killing prey , and the hungry young owl that screeches and snaps its bill when it begs for food . He ' s up by first_light , when hunters start their day , antsy for action . &quot; If something gets taken illegally or something gets poached , it ' s my fault that I wasn ' t there , &quot; Jeter said . Most nights , Jeter sits for hours in his truck , or walks the roads , watching for lights , listening for gunshots . In the bustle of the city , sometimes gunfire passes unnoticed , or is dismissed as a car backfiring . In the still of the forest , there is no mistaking gunfire . If all is_quiet , he drives on to hot spots , including water_holes , where hunters search for forked deer prints in the mud . Jeter ' s Mt . Baldy beat is roughly 132 # 470 acres , a territory almost 10 times the size of Pomona . In California , about 265 wardens patrol 100 million acres , an average of 377 # 358 acres per warden . In his forest-green Bronco , Jeter drives carefully on winding , unpaved roads with no guardrails . He keeps watch_over deep canyons , thick_with chaparral , manzanita and canyon_oak , where bears prowl for acorns , holly leaf and coffee_berry . At night , far from the city lights , the forest is as black as the backdrop of a search-and-destroy video_game . Poachers shine 1-million-candlepower spotlights into the_hills until they hit pay_dirt -- deer eyes , which glow emerald green . And then they shoot , sometimes with high-powered assault_rifles , equipped with night scopes . The guns , which are legal for use but frowned_on by many hunters , can quickly pump 20 or 30 rounds into a deer . To save money , some hunters don ' t pay_for the required licenses . It costs $ 24.95 for a hunting_license , plus $ 16.55 for a &quot; tag , &quot; or permit to shoot a deer , $ 23 for a bear permit . If you ' re caught without the proper permits , it ' s roughly a $ 650 fine . Others hunt while drunk , or try to take more_than the two deer and one bear allowed under law . Still others set leg-hold traps -- and fail to check them once a day , as required -- or use illegal bait , such_as a cut-up fawn or a deer shot out of season to attract bear , mountain_lions or other animals looking_for a meal . Last year , right before deer season , Jeter got a tip about an illegal bait-and-shoot ruse in the foothills above San Dimas . About a quarter of a mile off the road , a hunter had hacked a 40-yard swath through laurel_sumac and built an eight-foot-wide shooting lane . At the end of the lane , the_hunter dug a pit , with brush trimmed around it so only his head could peek out . At the lane ' s other end the_hunter left bait -- a water trough , two hunks of salt and a bale of hay . For three dark mornings , Jeter staked out the_pit , showing_up at 3 a.m. , so cold that he could barely move . The hunter never showed . Eventually , the brush grew back and covered the setup . Jeter was undaunted . &quot; Sometimes you go all night and don ' t even see a light , not even hear a gunshot , &quot; Jeter said . &quot; But if you don ' t do the time , if you don ' t do the hours , you ' ll never catch these guys . You can ' t expect to go_out for an hour or two and go , ' No bad_guys tonight . Time to go home. ' &quot; This hunting_season , Jeter has so far issued seven citations , mostly for deer poaching and weapon violations , about average . The season began in October for animals including deer and bear , and in November , for most others ; deer season ended Nov . 6 , and bear season ends Dec . 25 . Most violations are misdemeanors , punishable by up_to a $ 1 # 000 fine and six months in jail . An estimated 95 % of all poachers get_away , according to fish and game studies on detection rates . Last year , wardens issued 2 # 150 citations for poaching , about 17 % of them for illegal taking of deer , the most common offense . In 1988 , the Department of Fish and Game had 14 wardens in an undercover anti-poaching unit ; now , because of budget cutbacks , the unit has only one permanent warden . U.S. forest rangers also patrol the woods , but their shifts end by 5 p.m. , and by midnight , sheriff ' s deputies are done with mountain patrol . After that , Jeter is the lone law_enforcement officer on_duty in his district . At night , nobody knows exactly where Jeter ' s patrol takes him . In the canyons , his radio contact fades in and out . Night patrol is heart-stopping duty . It is a tough drive , on windy , unpaved roads through steep canyons , hard to follow after long nights driving endless stretches , or when a light in the_hills diverts Jeter ' s attention from the road . Sometimes , a tire on Jeter ' s Bronco catches the side of the road , or his bumper scrapes the canyon ' s steep edge . Or , sometimes , Jeter watches the_hills with a night scope and spots hunters , who sometimes spot him as well , so they unsling their rifles and move_on . The worst moment is when Jeter drives_up to one of the U.S. Forest Service ' s locked gates , which are there to keep people out of areas that are off limits . He is wary about reaching for the combination_lock into the gate post ' s nook , a potential nestling place for rattlesnakes , though he ' s never found any there . With his back spotlighted by the Bronco ' s glaring headlights , he is a sitting duck if anyone wanted to take a shot . At that moment , if a twig or two cracks in the wind , it ' s enough to set Jeter -- a former federal drug enforcement officer -- on edge . &quot; It ' s not me thinking , ' Gee , that ' s a bear or a mountain_lion , ' &quot; Jeter said . &quot; It ' s , ' Is that a person ? And what the heck are they doing 12 miles up , in the middle of nowhere , on_the_road or up behind this locked gate ? ' &quot; I just have a hard_time believing that a mountain_lion is going_to come_up and make me a meal . The thing I fear is the crazy person , the person who ' s not right. &quot; Last Halloween , in a thicket of trees near Mt . Baldy , Jeter ran_across three young people in white robes and black masks . Near pentagrams chalked in the dirt , they sat with a sword , owl ' s wing and a jar of goat ' s blood , chanting at the moon . He confiscated the owl ' s wing -- someone said they got_it from a road kill -- and sent the group on its way . In an emergency , Jeter would try to radio his dispatch center in Sacramento or forest dispatchers in Arcadia for help from Azusa or Glendora police . But his back-country beat , which rises to an elevation of 6 # 000 feet , includes Devil ' s Canyon , Barbecue Alley and Valley of the Moons , places that aren ' t on any map . So far , Jeter hasn ' t run_into a situation that he couldn ' t handle . In his three years on the beat , Jeter hasn ' t shot anyone or been shot at . Mostly , he runs_into nuisances . In pitch blackness , for instance , he will hook a chain to a snapped yucca plant that blocks the road and use his truck to drag it away . Or he ' ll run_into careless hunters who use their great-grandfather ' s old rifle , some with taped-up stocks , or the barrel rusted shut , or half a stock so they have to shoot from the hip . Old rifles aren ' t illegal , but they ' re dangerous , and the shooters are as likely to kill themselves -- or someone else -- as any animal . On a recent late-night patrol , Jeter issued a citation to a 60-year-old man for keeping a loaded rifle and handgun in his four-wheel-drive truck , next to his 13-year-old grandson . The craggy-faced man , a hunter for 28 years , said he keeps the weapons close for protection , not to take illegal shots from the road . Thirty minutes later , Jeter suddenly stopped his Bronco . In the moonless night , he had spotted a glint in the road , maybe a shell casing from a . 38-caliber handgun , the type of weapon owned by the man he had just cited . He backed_up and looked , jacket-less and in short sleeves in air so cold that he could see his breath . No luck . He backed_up again . Sure enough , Jeter found a . 38-caliber shell casing , but it was an old one , sitting upright in the road , full of water from the previous night ' s rain . But Jeter checked the casing anyway , against the shells he had just confiscated . No match . If the shells had matched , then maybe the man had lied -- and had indeed shot at something from the road . Jeter says his job is nothing , compared with his brother ' s , who works as a policeman in Roseville , outside Sacramento . &quot; I ride along with my brother sometimes , &quot; said Jeter , who has a degree in criminal justice from Sacramento State University . &quot; We go_to gang_fights . Oh , man . Everyone ' s moving_around . Everyone ' s ( cursing ) everyone . I am , like , stressed at the end of the night . . . . I think his job is a lot more dangerous than mine. &quot; The warden ' s job demands a love of the outdoors , the ability to sit still in the wilderness for hours on end , for a starting salary of $ 26 # 400 . Jeter is not a hunter . He won ' t even run_over snakes in the road . Instead , he uses tongs to move them out of the away . In the forest , there are sights to behold . On the darkest of nights , the Seven Sisters constellation lights_up the sky . Once , in an electrical_storm , Jeter watched a lightning bolt split a big pine_tree and set it afire . Another time , in the early morning near the San Gabriel River ' s East Fork , he saw what looked_like a dog at the side of the road , digging madly , dirt flying everywhere . It turned_out to be a small bear , head buried in an ant hill , only its butt sticking_out . He even runs_into regulars , such_as the great horned owl that perches on the highway marker night after night . &quot; I never get bored of seeing ( animals ) , &quot; Jeter said . &quot; Like the deer I saw the other night . That was great . It ' s not like , ' Oh , there ' s another deer , I see them every damn day. ' &quot; Even on his days_off , he drives to the forest with his wife , 11-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter , for camping , fishing or hiking . His job takes its toll on the family . During the height of deer season , Jeter often leaves home Friday night and returns on Sunday . This is Jeter ' s dream job , the one he always had his eye on , even when he was working in drug enforcement . He still has the sixth-grade essay he wrote_on why he wanted to be a game_warden . As a kid , growing_up near rural_areas , he spent all day outside . At age 10 , in Florida ' s Panhandle , he and a friend decided to camp in the woods -- until it got cold and dark . Two hours later , scared to death , they moved to a spot under a street light on the edge of the woods . &quot; I ' ve come a long way now , &quot; he said . &quot; Now , I don ' t need the street light. &quot; Now , Orion the_Hunter , a winter constellation , lights the night sky for him , bow_and_arrow perpetually poised , ready for the kill .</TEXT>
