   <HEADLINE> POST-4TH FED WATCH MAKES FOR DULL SESSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stocks inched higher Tuesday as bond yields dipped in light post-holiday trading , and as financial markets nervously awaited the outcome of a Federal_Reserve_Board policy meeting . Meanwhile , the dollar rose against the Japanese yen but fell against major European currencies as doubts grew that a weekend meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations will come_up with a major rescue plan for the dollar . On Wall_Street , stocks churned in an uneventful session , with the Dow industrials adding 5.83 points to 3 # 652.48. In the broad market , advances narrowly outnumbered declines on the Big Board , where volume was a slow 195.4 million shares . Many investors and traders had not yet returned from Monday ' s Independence_Day holiday . Analysts said the few players in the market were apprehensive about the outcome of the Fed policy meeting , which began Tuesday and continues today . Although there has been speculation that the Fed might lean toward raising short-term interest_rates again to keep inflation at_bay and help prop_up the sagging dollar , many analysts expect the central_bank to pursue a steady policy course for now . Some analysts said the Fed probably wants to see this Friday ' s government report on June employment to get a better handle on the economy ' s strength . A big gain in jobs in June could convince the Fed that the economy warrants slightly higher interest_rates to moderate its growth . In the bond market , yields finished a bit lower Tuesday , helped by another steep fall_in grain prices . The Commodity Research Bureau index slid 3.30 points to 226.73 as grain prices sank on news of more Midwest rain . Falling commodity prices reduce inflationary pressures , which in turn can take upward pressure off interest_rates . The yield on the Treasury ' s 30-year bond eased to 7.58 % from Friday ' s 7.60 % . In currency trading the dollar gained against the yen , to 98.90 yen in New York from 98.55 Friday . But the dollar fell to 1.580 German marks from Friday ' s 1.596. Among the day ' s stock_market highlights : * Technology stocks failed to respond well to news that computer networker Wellfleet Communications intends to buy SynOptics Communications . Wellfleet dove 5 3 / 16 to 20 1 / 16 ; SynOptics fell 1 1 / 8 to 14 5 / 8 . Some analysts questioned SynOptics ' value to Wellfleet . Among other falling tech issues , Cabletron Systems fell 2 to 96 , Newbridge Networks lost 7 / 8 to 34 1 / 2 and Cisco Systems eased 5 / 8 to 22 15 / 16 . * Oil stocks were strong .

Among other oils , Arco gained 1 3 / 8 to 103 , Phillips jumped 1 3 / 4 to 33 1 / 2 and Mobil rose 1 3 / 8 to 82 5 / 8 . * Boeing rose 3 / 4 to 47 1 / 8 on the company ' s report that it delivered 67 commercial airliners in the second quarter , slightly more_than some analysts had expected .

Frankfurt ' s DAX average ended at 2 # 032.69 , down 21.71 points , while London ' s FTSE-100 index lost 5.4 points to 2 # 965.0.
