   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : WILL THE SAVVY AMATEUR INHERIT ON-LINE GOLD ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Misdial a phone_number these days and there is a good chance you won ' t just hear a voice mail message or the telltale beep . . . beep . . . beep of a fax machine , but the buzz-saw whine of a computer bulletin_board or on-line service . The number of amateur bulletin_boards -- computerdom ' s cousin to ham radio -- is spiraling into the hundreds of thousands . Hundreds of organizations are hooking_up to the Internet every month . Apple Computer , AT &amp; T and Microsoft all promise to move_into on-line consumer services in a big way . Rupert Murdoch and General Electric are already there with Delphi and GEnie . Practically every_other week , &quot; content providers &quot; ( multimedia bafflegab for organizations that own their own data ) leap into the on-line El Dorado hoping to mine digital dollars . Newspapers like the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times have cut on-line distribution deals with Ziff Interactive and Prodigy , respectively , while NBC announced it will join publications like Time magazine and the New Republic in cyberspace via America Online . With on-line industry revenues of more_than $ 500 million last year accompanying a 25 % growth in paying subscribers , the computer cognoscenti are already predicting a &quot; shakeout in cyberspace. &quot; There is a growing glut of on-line services , they contend , and the market can ' t support them all . A shakeout may be coming , but not because of any on-line gluts . that ' s a bit like saying there ' s a glut of telephone_numbers and the market can ' t support them all . While it ' s undeniably true that the rush to on-line has a lemming-like quality mixed with equal parts of greed and fear , it ' s also true that the economics of on-line services are being radically and fearsomely transformed . This shakeout will instead shatter the very notion of an interactive &quot; information utility &quot; that got Prodigy , CompuServe and America Online launched in the first place . Their business model is being ruthlessly undermined by the rise of cheap memory , cheap software and cheap telecommunications . They ' re begging to be bypassed . * Once upon a time , Information Age industrialists thought you had to invest millions in the hardware , software and telecommunications technologies necessary to launch a national on-line service . IBM and Sears have reportedly poured more_than $ 1 billion into their Prodigy over the last decade . CompuServe and America Online have spent tens of millions . On-line services were seen as capital-intensive businesses that required tons of money for software and systems development . In reality , it turns_out that on-line services don ' t have to be capital-intensive at all . If you ' ve got half a mind to launch an on-line service , that ' s all you need . An agile entrepreneur or intelligent content provider can start_up and maintain a dial-up on-line service for a_few thousand -- not a_few million -- dollars . If you are_on the Internet , the barrier of entry to offering on-line information and interaction globally is practically zero . The issue is whether you offer the sort of information and interactions people want . If you do , the real challenge then is creating a billing system to collect your money . Convincing a_few advertisers to sponsor your wares might also be nice . Of course , you need software that is compatible and user-friendly for the people who log_on to your service , but increasingly , that kind of network interface software is becoming as accessible and affordable as spreadsheets and word_processors . Prediction : Microsoft will make more money selling interface software to on-line services than running one . The folks at America Online , Prodigy and CompuServe should be terrified . Right now , their content providers pay big bucks to be_on their network . In market terms , however , a Time magazine or NBC needs them like the proverbial fish needs a bicycle . There is absolutely no inherent economic or technological reason why Time needs to go electronic via an America Online versus having its own on-line service for subscribers . In 1994 , the cost to Time is marginal . Just wait . Instead of &quot; information providers &quot; paying on-line services to carry their content and support their chat lines , the on-line services will be bidding to keep the content on the network , just as networks pay affiliates to carry their television programming . * Sure , an America Online has an &quot; installed base &quot; of personal_computer subscribers . But there is nothing that prevents a Time or a Newsweek from giving their readers the option to call_in directly . In other words , these media providers will bypass the on-line resellers of their information . Don ' t be surprised when magazines and newspapers begin to disintermediate existing on-line services and offer toll-free ( advertiser-sponsored ) access to their own on-line services . Of course , you ' d still be able to do all_the electronic_mail and bulletin_board communications functions that the on-line services now provide . Similarly , expect financial service_firms like American Express , Fidelity and Merrill Lynch to offer their own &quot; free &quot; on-line advisory services off toll-free numbers . Again , given that the bulk of their data is already digitized , launching these services will represent -- at most -- a marginal_cost . The catch ? You might have to make four or five toll-free calls_on your personal_computer to network to your favorite media instead of just one toll_call to the service . Sending e-mail might be more difficult -- although you can be sure these new services will negotiate Internet access to other on-line services . This trend toward on-line disintermediation doesn ' t mean there will be a cyberspace shakeout ; quite the contrary , it implies that consumers will have a very crowded and competitive marketplace from which to choose . The critical observation is that the larger on-line services like Prodigy and CompuServe can no longer rely_on other people ' s information to lure new subscribers . They ' ll need to offer new kinds of interactive programming . So what will the Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh of on-line services interact like ?</TEXT>
