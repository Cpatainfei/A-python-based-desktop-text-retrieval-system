   <HEADLINE> JUDGE SENDS EXACTLY THE RIGHT MESSAGE ; HATE-MONGERING SKINHEADS FEEL THE FULL FORCE OF THE LAW -- AND THEREFORE JUSTICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two young skinheads who plotted to ignite a race war in Southern California will now spend years in federal prison . Christopher David Fisher , 20 , and Carl Daniel Boese , 17 , pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges stemming from a federal investigation of their racist and violent activities . U.S. District Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr . refused to coddle them . He sentenced Fisher , a leader of the Fourth Reich Skinheads , to eight years and Boese to nearly five years . Those appropriate sentences should put others who hate on notice : If they break the law , they will not get_off lightly . The youth of Fisher and Boese cannot excuse what they did with other members of their hate group . They used pipe_bombs and Molotov_cocktails against homes and synagogues ; they plotted to attack the historic First African Methodist Episcopal Church , kill prominent African Americans , murder Jews , blow_up Asians , harm Latinos . They served as lookouts for other criminals . They spewed hatred and , worse , they acted_on their beliefs . They were serious and they had the means -- guns and explosives -- to maim and murder . Before anyone was killed -- and that was their racist group ' s avowed aim -- a federal investigation into weapons trafficking by white_supremacists stopped the plotting . Agents of the FBI , the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms and Los Angeles police made arrests in July before Fisher , Boese and others could put more of their murderous plans into action . &quot; They were sending absolutely the wrong message , &quot; Judge Byrne said . &quot; Hopefully , what occurs in this courtroom sends a different kind of message. &quot; The prosecutor , Assistant U.S. Atty . Marc R . Greenberg , is satisfied with the sentences . He can also take_pride in the unusual counseling that he initiated last month for Fisher , Boese and others associated with the skinhead group . During three days of emotional sessions they met with Holocaust survivors , a black federal judge , Jewish and other minority students , rabbis and the black minister they had plotted to assassinate at First AME -- the Rev . Cecil Murray , who put his beliefs into practice when he forgave them . They also toured the Simon Weisenthal Center ' s Museum of Tolerance , watched the Holocaust movie &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; and visited the Men ' s Central Jail , where inmates warned them to change . Boese seemed less than guilt-ridden about the consequences of his hatred , but Fisher appeared contrite , tearfully voicing remorse at the sentencing . Regardless of the defendants ' demeanor , their tough sentences will warn others who share their awful beliefs .</TEXT>
