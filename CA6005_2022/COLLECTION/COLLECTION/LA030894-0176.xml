   <HEADLINE> EXHIBITORS GATHER IN LAS VEGAS , PAN FILM QUOTAS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With Hollywood under threat of increased quotas and levies in Europe , some exhibitors on Monday came_out in favor of maintaining open access to those film markets . John Wilkinson , chief_executive of Great Britain ' s Cinema Exhibitor ' s Assn. , said theaters everywhere will need open markets if they are to meet the growing public demand for entertainment . In England , he said , moviegoing rose 8.8 % last year alone , a trend that &quot; requires feeding with more and more product. &quot; Wilkinson ' s comments came during afternoon sessions at the NATO / Showest meeting of movie_theater owners . The annual convention brings_together exhibitors and Hollywood executives , who provide a preview of upcoming releases . The troublesome specter of quotas and fees has grown since last December , when U.S. negotiators were unable to overcome stonewalling by their European counterparts on including entertainment in the GATT agreement . Without the protection of GATT , Hollywood is vulnerable to protectionist measures from countries trying to boost their own film_industries . * Much of that protectionist sentiment stems from the dominance of U.S. films in Europe , even though many Hollywood films are financed with foreign money or released by foreign-owned studios . Wilkinson in his talk intentionally called American films &quot; international &quot; movies , noting that many of them &quot; just happened to be produced in Hollywood by international production companies. &quot; Paul Oneile , managing director of the Greater Union Organization , made the case that Australia ' s film_industry has flourished with the lifting of quotas . During the 1980s , he said , the number of Australian films tripled as quotas were lifted . &quot; Quotas do not make a bad film good , &quot; he said . Joost Bart , president of Decatron Kinepolis in Belgium , also strongly endorsed open film markets , saying the prospect of quotas and levies is scary . He also said exhibitors should have made their point_of_view more widely known on the GATT controversy . Peter Ivany , chief_executive of Hoyta Corp . in Australia , said he agrees with anti-quota arguments , but he added that local film_industries must be supported . He said Hollywood should endeavor to produce its films around the world , in the same way that a company such_as Toyota produces its cars around the world .</TEXT>
