   <HEADLINE> NOTRE DAME GIVES_UP ITS INDEPENDENCE ; COLLEGE : EVERY SPORT EXCEPT FOOTBALL WILL COMPETE IN THE BIG EAST STARTING IN 1995 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It had become &quot; The Question &quot; for John MacLeod . When would Notre Dame ' s basketball program join a conference ? It was asked often as the Fighting Irish struggled to losing records the past two seasons , and MacLeod could only shrug as the administration methodically weighed its options . When Notre Dame finally announced Monday that it had been approved to join the Big East in every sport except football in 1995 , MacLeod couldn ' t wait for someone to ask his feelings . &quot; Where are all_the guys that want to talk_about the conference ? &quot; he said , reporters still trickling in_for a news_conference . &quot; We finally can talk_about it . I don ' t have to give this canned response anymore. &quot; The Fighting Irish were introduced as the 13th Big East member only four months after it appeared the chances of joining were scuttled with the addition of Rutgers and West_Virginia as full members . Those former football-only schools were added March 9 and Temple and Virginia Tech , also football-only members , were denied full membership . That ended a basketball vs . football membership feud that had threatened to shatter the 15-year-old conference . The Big East presidents had said any further expansion before 2000 was unlikely , unless &quot; a unique exception &quot; arose . Notre Dame was that exception . Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese said the addition of Notre Dame was &quot; probably the greatest Ben Gay we could apply to our wounds. &quot; Already entrenched in the New York television market , the nation ' s biggest , the Big East now moves_into the Chicago market , which is No . 2 . The conference also gets Notre Dame ' s immense national following , as well as the addition of lesser-known sports in which the_Irish are national powers , including men ' s and women ' s tennis and soccer , baseball and volleyball . Notre Dame has been a member of the Midwestern Collegiate Conference , a non-football conference , in every sport but basketball . For the_Irish , the largest impact is the potential for its basketball program to return to the prominence of the 1970s and ' 80s , when it was perennially among the nation ' s top teams under Digger Phelps . The Irish have lost several top recruits in recent years because they were not in a league . &quot; If we were going_to play in the Big East next season , we would have a very difficult time , &quot; said MacLeod . &quot; But by the time ' 95 rolls_around we will have had a chance to bring five new players into our program . . . . We ' re stepping_up big-time. &quot; Despite MacLeod ' s enthusiasm , Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal said the alliance was not made because the basketball_team couldn ' t compete as an independent . &quot; I have always maintained that we could continue as an independent . I still do , &quot; said Rosenthal , who was vacationing in Colorado . &quot; I think the emergence of our Olympic sports as national competitors . . . . and the fact that those programs would be enhanced was a clear-cut factor. &quot; There never was talk_about including Notre Dame football . Notre Dame , Rutgers and West_Virginia will begin competing in all sports in the 1995-96 season . A conference format has not been worked_out , although it appears likely there will be two divisions with each team playing the others at least once .</TEXT>
