   <TEXT> * Re &quot; Papal Politics &quot; by Martin E . Marty , Opinion , Sept . 11 : Marty is right , the Pope played hardball . Unfortunately we played softball . However , Marty needs to take his thinking one step farther . The Pope has no more right being a major spokesperson at the population conference than would a mayor from Tahiti being a major spokesperson at a Vatican Ecumenical Council . This was a conference of states , not of religions . As such , the Pope represents the Vatican , a state with a_few thousand people , mostly men . He doesn ' t represent the millions of Catholics around the world . They are represented by their heads_of_state . Vice_President Al Gore was far too willing to compromise with the Pope . He would have been within his right to say to the Pope , &quot; You don ' t represent the millions of Catholics in the U.S. I do . I am representing their views more accurately than you do . Most of the Catholics strongly disagree_with your views. &quot; Gore , of course , could have said that diplomatically . Gore would have been much wiser politically to have challenged the Pope . Gore is a family_man . Gore did sacrifice a run_for the White_House when his son needed him . He is , in my opinion , a much more moral man than most who are in Washington or even in the Vatican . Only someone like Gore could have pointed_out the absurdity of the Pope dominating a political conference on population . Gore is too_much of a gentleman to have done so . RICHARD FOY Redondo Beach * Marty accuses the Vatican of throwing &quot; Cairo off course. &quot; Through the draft program of action , the Clinton_Administration ( Vice_President Gore , Undersecretary Tim Wirth ) and their allies have attempted to throw Third_World development off course . At the Cairo conference the Catholic representatives have objected most strongly to : * The redefinition of abortion as health_care and a form of family_planning . * The redefinition of family to include homosexual relationships ( to the detriment of children ) . * The corrupting of youth morality by Planned Parenthood-type sex education . With such significant issues on the table , it is to the credit of the Catholic community that the Vatican did not cave_in after continual attacks like that of Marty . It is also a compliment to the Vatican that Marty ' s attack was more personal than substantive . It was the draft program for action that shifted emphasis from development toward radical social engineering . It has been the U.S. contingency and its allies that have stonewalled on clarifying terms , refused to admit they are breaking_with previous development conferences on abortion and hidden behind euphemisms . What the U.S. delegation , the draft program for action and the Cairo Conference have refused to acknowledge is that the major cause of poverty and suffering is not population growth , but poor political and economic_policies . The former communist world has long had the highest rates of abortion . Where is their prosperity and development ? Lower fertility_rates do not lead to development . Sociology has shown conclusively that the traditional family is the foundation on which any healthy society must build . The Vatican has exposed to the world the deceits hidden in the euphemisms of the draft program for action . In the midst of the uproar , the attacks and the criticism , I am proud that the Catholic community has taken this heroic stand . THE REV . THOMAS J . BURDICK Chairman , Respect Life Committee San Bernardino Diocese * I disagree_with Marty ' s accusation that the Pope is being political . The fact that the killing of pre-born babies has become a political issue is of no concern to the Pope . He is simply reaffirming God ' s fifth commandment : &quot; Thou shalt not kill. &quot; BARBARA D . KENT-BELROY Fullerton * There can be no real improvement in the lives of many people without the increased use of artificial methods of birth_control to curb the number of babies born_on this planet with no food , no shelter and no hope . The Pope is kidding himself if he thinks otherwise . JUDY DANIELS Thousand Oaks * So the malcontent Malthusians who roam the corridors of the U.N. and the White_House , both of which already consider themselves the world government , have got $ 17 billion with which to enforce our &quot; reproductive rights. &quot; Quite apart from forwarding a theory long discredited and without scientific foundation , the real question of Cairo is not about women ' s rights , the power of the Vatican or legal abortion . It is about surrendering a basic individual freedom to a government . Letting them into your bedroom , in_essence . Lest you consider this overly Orwellian , ponder this : Who will be the overpopulator ? You ? Me ? Or will it be the person who doesn ' t agree ? ROBERT LUSETICH Los Angeles</TEXT>
