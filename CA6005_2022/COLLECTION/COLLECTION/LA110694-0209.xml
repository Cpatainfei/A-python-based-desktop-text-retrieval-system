   <TEXT> In a crisp , elegant voice , actor Edward Herrmann reads the first passages of the audio-book version of &quot; Lost Moon , &quot; the story of the aborted Apollo 13 mission to the moon . As he gets_to a section about rumors that the astronauts carried suicide_pills , he is interrupted . &quot; Forget about it , &quot; says the cheery voice of Jim Lovell , the Apollo 13 commander and the book ' s co-author . &quot; There just weren ' t any situations where you ' d ever consider making , well , an early exit. &quot; Just who is in_charge of reading this book , anyway ? The answer is : both of them . This is an audio-book publisher ' s experiment with multiple voices , a rarity in an industry devoted almost exclusively to a single-reader format . And in the coming months , publishers will tinker even more with tradition : New titles will feature music , sound_effects , CD recordings and even full-cast productions . That is enough to make some audio-book purists buy earplugs . But some producers say more elaborate productions are the future of audio-books , as publishers jockey to distinguish their new releases and try to appeal_to new listeners . &quot; By double_digits , people are coming_into the audio market , and they ' re bringing in more tastes , &quot; says Donald V . Allen , president of High-Top Sports Productions , an audio publisher in Hollywood . &quot; Some people want more stimulation , more involvement in the product. &quot; His firm ' s example : Richard Bak ' s &quot; Ty Cobb : His Tumultuous Life and Times , &quot; a December release featuring the sounds of a baseball_game . &quot; This is one that lends itself , &quot; Allen says . &quot; You have the roar of the crowd , the sound of the ball hitting the bat , the catcher talking to the umpire. &quot; Although the industry is still dominated by simple productions , two audio-book hybrids recently made_it to the Publishers Weekly bestseller list : &quot; Star Wars : Dark Empire , &quot; a full-cast recording of a comic_book , and &quot; Neuromancer , &quot; a new audio production of William Gibson ' s cyber-novel that features unreleased mixes by rockers U2 . &quot; This is part of the same technological campfire ( as radio dramas ) , &quot; says Maya Thomas , a producer at Time Warner AudioBooks , which released both bestsellers . &quot; We ' re telling the tale and setting the mood. &quot; &quot; Lost Moon , &quot; just released by Simon &amp; Schuster Audio , features the voices of Lovell and Herrmann , as well as the original recordings between Mission Control and the Apollo spacecraft . &quot; This is a medium you can play with , &quot; says Seth D . Gershel , publisher of Simon &amp; Schuster Audio . &quot; You don ' t just have to have someone sit_down at the microphone and read . You can experiment. &quot; Simon &amp; Schuster Audio originally planned for &quot; Lost Moon &quot; to be a traditional production . Lovell , who co-authored the book with Jeffrey Kluger , was to have read the six-hour abridgment on_his_own , but he had the same problem that many writers have behind a microphone : They aren ' t trained as narrators . &quot; Some people are astronauts , some people are publishers , some people are readers , &quot; Gershel says . &quot; But we really wanted his voice on there . He really has a peaceful-sounding tone for a guy who sat_up there in a tin_can , wondering if he would come_back or not. &quot; Their solution was to split the duties . Herrmann , a veteran audio-book voice , narrates the bulk of the book , which is written in third_person . Lovell voices more personal passages , such_as the tense moments when he and the two other astronauts wonder how they will make_it back to Earth . His passages were rewritten in first_person for the audio production . &quot; The book really has a double focus , &quot; Herrmann says . &quot; It shifts between what was happening at Mission Control in Houston and what was going_on in the spacecraft . . . . This makes_it more authentic , hearing it from ( Lovell ) . &quot; * For other publishers , casting multiple voices is a simple way to discern the characters . Steven Weber ( &quot; Wings &quot; ) voices much of &quot; Dream Lovers , &quot; Dodd Darin ' s book about his parents , Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee . But Alison West takes_over the reading when the book covers Dee ' s personal life and her troubles with an overprotective mother . Gender isn ' t always the issue . In its upcoming release of James Patterson ' s &quot; Kiss the Girls , &quot; Time Warner AudioBooks will feature different voices for a cop and two serial-killer villains . &quot; It makes_for a quicker identification and more variety , &quot; says John Wynne , another producer at Time Warner AudioBooks . In &quot; Kiss the Girls , &quot; he says , the action &quot; shifts suddenly to the killers ' point_of_view as the cop is tracking them down . Having different voices heightens the suspense. &quot; Time Warner , in its attempt to reach new listeners , has been among the most aggressive in releasing audio-books with new twists . For example , in the audio version of his autobiography , Motown founder Berry Gordy sings a_few chords of some of his record label ' s hits . Then the production features vintage recordings of the full singles . Some producers argue that listeners expect to hear music and sound_effects , especially when the audio-book is an offshoot of some_other form of media . Simon &amp; Schuster ' s &quot; Star Trek &quot; novels feature the sounds of phasers and laser guns . Time Warner ' s &quot; Star Wars &quot; comic_books include the popular score . Random House ' s &quot; Baseball , &quot; the companion audio-book to the PBS series , features music from the documentary . &quot; When the James Bond novels were first released , something was missing , &quot; says Gershel of Simon &amp; Schuster . &quot; It was the theme_song at the beginning . The audio cried_out_for that . People expect to hear it because they saw the movie. &quot; Yet sound_effects and music have a limit , Gershel says : &quot; People new_to the business tend to overload . You want the story to just blend_in the background . You ' re not going_to take Barbara Bush ' s biography and juice it up with music . It doesn ' t need that. &quot; Some audio publishers say that the more elaborate productions will only distract from the story . &quot; It ' s like storytelling , &quot; said George Hodgkins , president of Audio Renaissance Tapes in Los Angeles . &quot; If you characterize too_much , it gets_to be silly. &quot; Technology could change the format . Producers are looking_to three-dimensional , compact_disc sound but so far have limited titles to ones popular to collectors , such_as &quot; Star Wars &quot; and &quot; Star Trek. &quot; But Herrmann argues that elaborate productions will turn_off many fans . Commuters , who make_up almost half of the audio-book market , listen to books to escape the cluttered world of radio talk and music shows , he says . &quot; Tapes are an exercise in shutting the world out . They give you time to yourself . People listen to them because they aren ' t bombarded by images. &quot; Says Gershel : &quot; You want people to say , ' The story is terrific , ' not ' This is a good tape. ' &quot; *</TEXT>
