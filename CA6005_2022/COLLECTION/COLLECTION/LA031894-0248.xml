   <HEADLINE> ON-LINE OVERLOAD ; NETCOM STRUGGLES TO KEEP PACE WITH ITS RAPID GROWTH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bob Rieger wants to be a high-tech version of his hero , Henry_Ford . Just as Ford ' s goal was to put every American behind the wheel of a Model T , Rieger dreams of steering everyone to the Internet , that electronic information pastiche through which users can browse card_catalogues of libraries worldwide , keep_up with news as it ' s happening and chat on-line with kindred spirits . Rieger ' s biggest problem might be that he ' s succeeding too well . Lured by a flat monthly rate for dialing up the Internet through his service , so many new customers have subscribed_to his Netcom On-Line Communication Services Inc. that the system at times has practically ground to a halt . Netcom ' s expansion -- and occasional stumbles -- illustrate the frenzied rush onto the Internet as users take_to_heart the notion of an &quot; information superhighway &quot; and seek the quickest on-ramp . Other types of electronic information networks are having similar problems . In January , America Online , a booming on-line service that enables personal_computer users to read news , shop for merchandise and exchange messages , had to shut_down temporarily and revamp software to handle a subscriber overload . Netcom is far from the only provider of Internet access , but it is surely one of the fastest growing , with a noticeable proportion of messages posted in Internet forums coming from Netcom users . Only 5 years old , Netcom is now the nation ' s fifth-largest Internet service provider , no mean achievement given its popularity with individuals as opposed to big corporations that access the Internet directly . Having long ago outgrown the den of Rieger ' s house , Netcom is setting_up shop in a San Jose office_building where engineers hustling day and night cannot install modems fast enough to keep_up with all_the new subscribers hankering to dial up the Internet . Each day , the electronic-mail equivalent of 4 million pages of text passes_through Netcom ' s equipment . Netcom was the first commercial company to provide individuals with access to the Internet , born about 20 years ago as a Defense_Department network and long the province of the military-industrial complex , computer geeks and academics . Users gain access by dialing a local number at Netcom that patches them into the network . This year the company expects to see sales explode by about 700 % , from $ 2.8 million in 1993 . Its subscriber base is projected to shoot_up from the current 20 # 000 users ( a user might be an individual or a company with dozens or hundreds of employees signing_on ) . A nationwide expansion is_well underway , a new management team is in place , and an initial_offering of stock to the public is in the works . * So what ' s the problem ? Rivals are popping_up like crazy . ( Most of them are small , regional operations , but on-line services such_as America Online , Prodigy and CompuServe plan soon to provide a full array of services on the Internet , beyond electronic mail. ) And disgruntled customers complain of sluggish response_time during peak hours and difficulty in getting_through . &quot; Netcom has been going_through some growing pains , &quot; said Arthur R . McGee , a computer consultant in El Segundo who spends hours logged_on each day . &quot; But no one ' s about to abandon ship. &quot; With its flat-rate pricing of $ 17.50 or $ 19.50 a month ( plus a $ 20 set-up fee ) , McGee said , Netcom is &quot; pioneering the way that will make the information superhighway more affordable. &quot; As an aerospace company employee and night-school student in the 1980s , founder Rieger had a more modest goal : to help other students gain access through his personal_computer to their university ' s computer facilities . When enough students signed_up , Rieger began to charge a modest monthly fee so that he could buy more equipment . In exchange , his customers clamored for more services , so Rieger added electronic_mail , software_packages and some games . After 18 months , Netcom outgrew Rieger ' s house . Besides , he added , &quot; the noise , heat and racket drove my wife crazy. &quot; Relocating the phone_lines and beefing_up his computing resources required major funds and time . Rieger quit his job in artificial_intelligence with Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space and cashed_in his retirement package , refinanced his house , sold a vehicle and borrowed from relatives to come_up with the necessary $ 300 # 000 . To date , Netcom has installed modems to connect customers to the Internet in nearly 30 cities , with many_more planned . Figuring a way to track usage so that the company can plan for the right equipment and the proper number of phone_lines is proving daunting . &quot; People and systems are never in equilibrium , &quot; acknowledged Netcom ' s new president , John Anthony Whalen Jr . Chairman and Chief_Executive Rieger , 45 , claims that the company has never lost money . But some industry watchers see some risk . &quot; It ' s not all that difficult for a company to grow so fast and so well that . . . they outpace themselves , &quot; said Joel Maloff , a former telecommunications executive in Ann Arbor , Mich. , who consults with businesses about how to use the Internet . &quot; There may be some hiccups , and they may have overextended , &quot; he added . &quot; If not , fabulous. &quot; * Also , &quot; there ' s a risk that this Internet fever is going_to be a fad , &quot; noted Victor Wheatman , a Santa Clara-based analyst for the Gartner Group , a technology research firm in Stamford , Conn . For companies and individuals with secrets to hide , he added , the information superhighway is a hostile environment , filled with computer hackers striving to uncover sensitive information . Wheatman also suspects that much of the Internet growth could vaporize . &quot; I ' d like to see a study of inactive ( subscribers ) , &quot; he said . With about 5 % of Netcom ' s users hogging 30 % of the Internet action , Rieger fears that some sort of fee based on usage might be necessary , mainly to encourage use in off-peak hours . But his goal is to keep access as open as possible . &quot; I don ' t want Aunt Molly not to be able to afford the Internet , &quot; he says . The Boom in Internet Access Based on a rough survey , consultant Joel Maloff of Ann Arbor , Mich. , projects that connecting organizations and individuals to the Internet by phone will be a $ 230-million business in 1994 in the United States , up from about $ 50 million last year . Here are companies that provide the links and their projected 1994 market share : * PSI ( Performance Systems International ) * + : 14 % Sprint * + : 13 % Uunet * + : 12 % ANS ( Advanced Network &amp; Services ) * + : 9 % Netcom * + : 8 % Barrnet * : 3 % Cerfnet * : 3 % Suranet : 3 % Nearnet : 3 % World : 3 % + Available in major markets nationwide * Available in California * Source : Maloff Co .</TEXT>
