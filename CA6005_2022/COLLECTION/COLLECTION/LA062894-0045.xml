   <HEADLINE> GERMANS HANG_ON TO BEAT SOUTH_KOREA ; GROUP C : DEFENDING CHAMPIONS BUILD 3-0 LEAD , SURVIVE HEAT AND SECOND-HALF RALLY IN 3-2 VICTORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Germany had so_much to prove Monday that maybe , just maybe , it was too_much for the defending World Cup champions . After two mediocre games that had everyone from Bonn to Berlin in a tizzy , Germany ' s players , coaches and federation officials were hoping for a breakthrough in their final first-round match against South_Korea . And for 45 minutes the magic returned on a torrid Texas afternoon . Then , almost as quickly , it disappeared before 63 # 988 at the sold_out Cotton Bowl . Just like that . Germany won , 3-2 , in one of the World Cup tournament ' s most entertaining games , but it was South_Korea receiving most of the accolades after a grueling duel in the sun . Remarkably , Korea rallied from a 3-0 deficit and turned the powerful Germans into a team sitting on the precipice . &quot; We must admit , we are pretty lucky to have won this game , &quot; said Berti Vogts , Germany ' s coach . That they were . After taking a commanding lead in the first 37 minutes , the Germans collapsed on a day when temperatures reached almost 120 degrees on the field . Fifty spectators were treated for heat_exhaustion , 12 of whom were hospitalized and released . Although Germany won the Group C title with the victory , it was feeling the heat afterward . The Koreans , who were eliminated after two ties and a loss , were frustrated but had reason to be proud . They had rallied to tie Spain in the final six minutes , then had tied Bolivia before gaining the soccer world ' s attention Monday with their indomitable spirit . &quot; We didn ' t anticipate they could play all 45 minutes of the second_half , &quot; said Andreas Brehme , one of the only German defenders who had a satisfactory game . Said Hwang Sun-nong , who scored his team ' s first goal in the 52nd minute after catching goalkeeper Bodo Illgner out of position , &quot; We became physically superior in the second half. &quot; Germany already was getting harsh criticism from the German press before the match . And few in the German media were about to let_up after the team barely held_on in the final 30 minutes , when Korea had three solid scoring opportunities blocked by Illgner . &quot; At first , I think the players were very intimidated , &quot; said Kim Ho , Korea ' s coach . But then their confidence grew as German players slowed to a jog in the second_half . In a surprising move , Kim replaced captain and goalkeeper Choi In-young with Lee Woon-jae , to start the second_half , but the risky move worked . &quot; My first concern was to win , &quot; Kim said . &quot; If that means taking_out the team captain , then I will take_out the team captain. &quot; Once they realized they could attack the German defense , targeting Stefan Effenberg , who was playing for the injured Thomas Strunz , Korea became the aggressor . It looked_like a team of seasoned veterans compared to the all-stars from Germany . &quot; We got them going_with our mistakes , &quot; Vogts said . Although it was a memorable effort , Korea will leave the United States without its first World Cup victory in four appearances . &quot; We had a good chance , and we feel bad , &quot; Hwang said . Almost as bad as the Germans feel . It was a frustrating , fatiguing day despite the play of Juergen Klinsmann , who scored two goals , one of them the Cup ' s best so far . In the 12th minute , he took a pass from Thomas Haessler on the right side and , with his back to the net , controlled the ball with his right foot . In a brilliant move , he then hooked a waist-high left-footed shot inside the goal post . On Klinsmann ' s second goal and fourth of the tournament , he controlled a looping cross from the right and made a powerful shot . The ball slipped through Choi ' s hands on the way into the net . Still , Klinsmann was not in a celebratory mood afterward . &quot; We were not mentally fresh and it was hard for us to pick_up speed , &quot; he said of the second-half collapse . Lothar Matthaeus , the team ' s captain , was more contrite , saying , &quot; We are a little bit arrogant so this was the result. &quot; Matthaeus suffered a cut foot when he bumped_into a Korean in the first_half , but continued playing despite the pain . He clamped the cut during halftime , and then continued for a while . But eventually he had to leave , replaced by Andreas Moeller . &quot; I thought_about coming_off the field ( at halftime ) , but I didn ' t want to , &quot; Matthaeus said . &quot; ( Then ) the pain got worse. &quot; Matthaeus ' wound had to be stitched and his condition has not been determined . Germany won its group title with seven points . Spain finished second with five after defeating Bolivia , 3-1 . The victory ensured Germany of playing in the single-elimination second-round July 2 in Chicago . Whether Germany finds its form is anyone ' s guess . It will need to revamp its defense . &quot; We were in a huge mess and that will need critical_analysis , &quot; Vogts said of his defense .</TEXT>
