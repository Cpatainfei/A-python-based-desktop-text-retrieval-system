   <HEADLINE> DATA GROUP ' S LINKS CONCERN BCA LEADERS ; ISSUES : COACHES CLAIM NCAA-FUNDED ANALYSTS ARE CONNECTED TO FOUNDER OF MOVEMENT THAT FAVORS GENETIC SUPERIORITY . PANEL MEMBER DENIES CHARGES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the exception of a threatened boycott , no Black Coaches Assn . announcement attracted more attention than a charge on Dec . 14 , 1993 , that at least three members of an NCAA-sponsored research panel were linked to the founder of a movement known as Beyondism , which in some cases advocates polices of genetic superiority . Three months later , the panel ' s principal consultant , Jack McArdle , an associate_professor of psychology at the University of Virginia , continues to dispute the allegations and defend the research . McArdle ' s Data Analysis Working_Group , whose findings are crucial to NCAA policy concerning academic entrance and eligibility standards for student-athletes , particularly minorities , was labeled &quot; the hidden enemy &quot; in a statement by Rudy Washington , executive_director of the BCA . &quot; Fifty years ago , millions of Jews were herded onto railroad_cars and sent to their deaths , &quot; Washington said in a statement . &quot; Letting this group continue to advise the NCAA can only propagate the same basic ideas of a superior race. &quot; At the heart of the issue are the beliefs of Raymond Cattell , a noted psychology professor who first published his views on the subject in 1936 . McArdle said Cattell believes there is a disproportionately large_number of children born to those with less intellect . A possible solution , according to Cattell ' s writings , is that some people would be encouraged more_than others to reproduce . In its most basic form , the beginnings of genetic breeding , otherwise known as eugenics . The connection between Cattell and some members of the data analysis group became the focal_point of concern for the BCA and others . According to the Chronicle of Higher Education , Congresswoman Cardiss Collins ( D-Ill. ) wrote to NCAA President Joseph Crowley raising the issue . In the letter , Collins said McArdle , John Horn , a USC psychology professor , and John Nesselroade , a Virginia psychology professor , &quot; appear to be_on the ' self-appointed executive group ' &quot; to Cattell ' s Beyondism Foundation . Defenders of the panel said it is unfair to assume guilt_by_association . They say many psychologists who did graduate work under Cattell , as Horn and Nesselroade did at the University of Illinois during the 1960s , do not endorse Cattell ' s beliefs of eugenics . &quot; It is not part of my personal belief system and I ' ve told ( Cattell ) so on numerous occasions , &quot; said McArdle , who was appointed director of Cattell Research Institute in Charlottesville , Va. , last year . &quot; But eugenics is a complex topic and it ' s one that is easily confused with racism , so I understand the concerns of the people ( in the BCA ) from the eugenics aspect. &quot; According to McArdle , who was hired as the principal researcher for the NCAA project in 1989 , no member of the Data Analysis Working_Group adhered to the belief of eugenics as proposed by Cattell . &quot; There ' s no genetics in here at all , &quot; he said of the research . &quot; This is not genetics study. &quot; This has not mollified Collins , who chairs the Subcommittee on Commerce , Consumer Protection and Competitiveness . Collins is also vice chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus ' Task_Force on Intercollegiate Athletics . Collins ' subcommittee , which reports to the powerful Committee on Energy and Commerce , has launched an investigation into the inner workings of the Data Analysis Working_Group . If the investigation continues at its present pace , the first hearing could take_place by the end of the month , just in time for the NCAA ' s crown_jewel , the Final Four . McArdle , who said he admires some of Cattell ' s work , said it was because of Cattell ' s pro-eugenic policy that he chose to not join the psychologist ' s Beyondism group . As for the BCA ' s charges , McArdle said he can understand why the coaches and Collins are concerned by appearances of a link between Cattell and the research group . For instance , Nesselroade , McArdle ' s colleague at Virginia , published a book with Cattell in 1988 . &quot; I ' m not denying that their question is good , &quot; he said . &quot; They should ask such a question and they should ask us where we stand on these issues . The best evidence we have is the research we ' ve done for the NCAA. &quot; In that research , the group ' s data support the BCA ' s contention that higher entrance standards are possibly racially biased . Additional research , which should be completed within two months , McArdle said , also seems to support the initial findings . &quot; They were viewing us as adversarial when , in fact , we were not at all_in the position to advocate one or the other sides , &quot; McArdle said . USC ' s Horn said he talked to Trojan Coach George Raveling , a BCA leader , about his links to Cattell , explaining his association did not cause him to do &quot; anything dishonest or improper with data or to advise anyone to do that. &quot; Added Horn : &quot; Rudy Washington has made some accusations that are absolutely scandalous . He ' s accused people on the basis of no evidence. &quot; McArdle said he has written Collins and offered to make himself available for any questions concerning the research . He said he has not been contacted by the BCA , but that he would be willing to speak with the organization . Armed with information they believe suggests that the NCAA research findings were tainted , the BCA and Collins recommended , among other things , that all eligibility standards be repealed immediately . The NCAA didn ' t go_along with that , but it did call_for an immediate review of all available research on Proposal 16 , legislation that would impose new academic standards for incoming Division I freshman athletes beginning in August , 1995 . The resolution was adopted in January at the NCAA Convention . Collins ' subcommittee not only wants McArdle ' s findings examined by an independent third_party , but it wants access to the raw data used in the research . It contends that there is no system of checks and balances within the Data Analysis Working_Group , that data this important require independent confirmation . Collins also plans to challenge the scientific integrity of the process , as well as the NCAA ' s choice of consultants and the research panel ' s alleged lack of diversity . According to a source familiar_with the subcommittee , the NCAA has yet to respond &quot; adequately &quot; to Collins ' written request for access to the raw data . Nor has it agreed to allow an independent research group to study the data .</TEXT>
