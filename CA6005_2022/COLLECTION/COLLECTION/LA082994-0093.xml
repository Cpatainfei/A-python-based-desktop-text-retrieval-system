   <HEADLINE> LAW , HEALTH OFFICIALS SEEK TO ESTABLISH DRUG COURT ; JUSTICE : THE FOCUS WOULD BE_ON REHABILITATING NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS THROUGH TREATMENT , TESTING . FAILURE WOULD MEAN JAIL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Miami has one . Oakland and Portland , Ore. , do too . And now Orange County ' s law_enforcement and health_care officials are eagerly pursuing the county ' s first drug court , which would mark a dramatic shift in the way the criminal justice system handles nonviolent drug_addicts . The drug court would focus_on rehabilitation -- not punishment -- and would funnel first-time and repeat drug offenders through a rigorous , months-long program of drug treatment and testing . Failure would mean jail or prison , while graduates would escape conviction . The goal : breaking the vicious_cycle of addiction . &quot; This is not legalization of drugs , &quot; said Orange County Superior_Court Judge David T . McEachen , who is spearheading the effort to make drug court a reality . &quot; We are taking the exact opposite approach . Rather than just putting people in jail , we ' re going to give a certain target group_a chance . . . to achieve total abstinence. &quot; McEachen said he recently visited drug courts in Oakland and Oregon and came_away impressed with the possibilities : reducing crime , cutting court costs and freeing jail space and other resources for violent criminals . Orange County ' s drug court is still in the formative stages , but authorities hope to pay_for part of the program with grants obtained through the federal crime bill that was passed_by Congress last week . The local program would be modeled after other drug courts nationwide . Typically , one judge and courtroom staff are designated as the drug court , and eligible defendants are referred there from other courtrooms . The judge is responsible_for overseeing the program , and the defendants make frequent court appearances -- in some cases once a week -- to report their progress . A pilot_program could begin locally in early 1995 , with at most a_few hundred participants , court officials say . Superior_Court Executive_Officer Alan Slater said it is too soon to say who might be eligible , but everyone agrees that violent criminals need not apply . Prosecutors estimate that 3 # 000 to 5 # 000 people were charged in Orange County last year with possessing drugs such_as cocaine , heroin and methamphetamine . &quot; I think it ' s a model whose time has come , &quot; said Slater , who joined county judges , health officials and others at a daylong symposium Friday in Dana Point to hear about drug court programs nationwide . &quot; I think a judge said it best : ' This is a better mousetrap. ' &quot; The program would involve nearly every facet of law_enforcement and county government . Many involved say they are proceeding carefully to make_sure the program is a success -- and not a way for drug_addicts to take_advantage of the legal_system . Assistant Dist . Atty . Brent Romney said his office won ' t back the program until he is assured that public safety remains a No . 1 priority . He said the program should admit only addicts who meet specific criteria and are likely to benefit from treatment and rehabilitation . &quot; From our point_of_view , if the person is an addict and the person really wants help and we have a program in place , we probably would be very much in support of that , &quot; said Romney , director of the district_attorney ' s municipal court operations . &quot; I think everyone is in_agreement . If you can rehabilitate them , it ' s worth it. &quot; Chief Deputy Public_Defender Carl C . Holmes said he believes a drug court could reduce crime . &quot; The system is not working and we have to find other solutions to save us from the effects of drug use , &quot; Holmes said . &quot; There is really no question that drug use leads to crime . Drug_users support their habits with their crimes. &quot; Holmes said the program is a win-win situation for the judicial_system . If a defendant successfully completes the program and remains drug free , he or she avoids a conviction and the program saves money that otherwise would be spent for jails , courts , attorneys and cops . If the defendant fails , he or she still faces the original criminal charges . Some have likened it to giving drug_addicts a long rope : They can either hang themselves or hoist themselves to drug-free living . Holmes said a drug court might not be wildly popular in conservative Orange County . &quot; But we owe it to ourselves , no matter what our political views , to fight this problem in the most effective way possible. &quot; There are about 30 drug courts nationwide , and more_than 100 are being established . The first started in Miami in the late 1980s . McEachen said the idea for an Orange County drug court was sparked in May when he and Presiding Superior_Court Judge James L . Smith heard a presentation on such courts at a judicial conference . &quot; We looked_at each other and said , ' This is for us , ' &quot; McEachen recalled . Orange County judges have since been holding meetings with officials from various county agencies , including prosecutors , defenders , police , probation and health_care workers . Smith said the program appears to be a way to keep people from abusing drugs and coming_back to court &quot; time after time &quot; while saving taxpayers money . Smith has long been a supporter of alternative methods of fighting drugs , and caused a flap when he endorsed decriminalizing drugs as a way to gut the profit motive of dealers . More_than 50 people gathered_in Smith ' s courtroom Thursday to hear more about the concept from experts , including Alameda County Municipal Court Judge Jeffrey S . Tauber , who helped start the nation ' s second drug court . The strength of the drug court , Tauber told the group , is in linking all_the various agencies and services to create a circle that prevents people from falling_through the cracks in the system . In the Portland metropolitan area , court officials started a drug court program in August , 1991 , after surveys showed that up_to 75 % of all people booked on felony charges tested positive for drugs . &quot; Drugs were eating us alive , &quot; Multnomah County Dist . Atty . Mike Schrunk said at Thursday ' s meeting . Between August , 1991 , and June , 1994 , Portland officials diverted about 1 # 730 cases into the drug court , with about a third of those offenders graduating from the intensive 12-month program . Schrunk said the program has saved more_than $ 1 million through reductions in probation , law_enforcement and defense costs . Some success , like the 18 drug-free babies born to program participants , has been easy to measure , Schrunk said , while other aspects are more difficult to gauge . But Schrunk said he knows one thing for_sure : &quot; It ' s been more successful than what we were doing. &quot;</TEXT>
