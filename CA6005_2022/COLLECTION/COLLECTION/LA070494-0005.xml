   <HEADLINE> WHEN PROTEST GOES TOO FAR ; SUPREME COURT GETS CLINIC ISSUE JUST RIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The abortion debate has generated nearly as much heat over the First_Amendment , and its guarantee of free speech , as over the constitutionality of the medical procedure itself . Last week ' s decision by the U.S. Supreme Court limiting protests near abortion clinics is a case_in_point . By a 6-3 vote , the court held that judges and lawmakers can impose a buffer zone around a Florida abortion clinic and prevent protesters from picketing and chanting on the street and sidewalks in front of the facility and its parking_lot . The decision , stemming from a long-running confrontation outside the clinic , was the court ' s first detailed pronouncement on a protest issue that has arisen in scores of cases . Leaders of Operation Rescue , an anti-abortion group , vowed to shut_down the Florida clinic by conducting continuous protests . The clinic staff , complaining that the loud chanting during surgical hours was disruptive and constituted harassment , obtained a state court injunction . The broad injunction barred the chanting , created a 36-foot buffer zone outside the clinic and prohibited display of signs and photos that might disturb patients . Abortion opponents challenged the injunction , citing First_Amendment protections . But the high_court decisively disagreed . Writing for the majority , Chief_Justice William H . Rehnquist upheld key parts of the injunction , including the buffer zone and the bar on chanting . However , the ruling struck_down the ban on signs and photos . In so doing , it clarified the law on this issue and drew a reasonable line between legitimate protest and illegal harassment . Moreover , when read against the backdrop of other recent developments , the decision effectively disarms the most violent , disruptive abortion protesters . The message is consistent , whether from Congress in the form of the new Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Law ; from the California Legislature , which passed a similar law late last year ; from California ' s appellate_courts , upholding an injunction in Vallejo similar to that in Florida , or from the U.S. Supreme Court itself in narrower rulings handed_down earlier this year : Peaceful protest is constitutional ; disruptive or violent protest is not . Although division remains among the justices over the constitutionality of abortion , the Supreme Court fortunately has begun to find its voice on the narrower , yet no less vital First_Amendment question springing from this highly charged controversy .</TEXT>
