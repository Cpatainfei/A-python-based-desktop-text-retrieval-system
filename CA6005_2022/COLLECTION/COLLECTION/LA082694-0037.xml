   <TEXT> Want a clear view of the night sky in Los Angeles ? Go inside and turn_on your computer . Astronomy-themed home computer_programs have been_on the market for several years , but the vast storage capacity of CD-ROMs has launched a new generation of starry software . Two of the more notable of the pack are &quot; Planetary Taxi , &quot; a whimsical program aimed at junior_high and high_school students , and the spectacular Russian-made &quot; Redshift , &quot; which turns your computer into a sophisticated planetarium . &quot; Planetary Taxi , &quot; from the enterprising Voyager company in New York , depicts the solar_system as a giant roadway accessible by interplanetary taxi . Your guide is Rita , a Brooklyn-accented dispatcher whose voice is a refreshing change from the bland norm of software programs that seem to get their actors from the same agency that supplies talent for infomercials . Rita has you choose from three taxis . The &quot; Rookie &quot; model provides a simple tour of the program , while &quot; Cruiser &quot; and &quot; Expert &quot; get you into the &quot; Planetary Taxi &quot; game . To play , you sit in the driver ' s seat with a view of a highway on a desert landscape . A passenger comes on-board and makes a request to go_to a planet that meets his or her needs . For example , a kid who can ' t wait for tomorrow to go_to Disneyland wants you to take him to the planet with the shortest day . An athlete wants to go where he can jump the highest and a romantic soul wants to go_to the planet with the most moons . You click in a guess at what planet they want and the taxi streaks across the highway , recording the time it takes_to get there at rocket speed of about 25 # 000 miles per hour . If you ' ve gotten the answer right , the passenger gives you a big tip . A near guess gets a smaller tip and if you ' re totally wrong , you have to try again . The idea is to collect as much as you can in tips before racking_up 50 years of travel_time . &quot; Planetary Taxi &quot; also includes 300 high-quality still photographs of the planets and a handful of animated sequences . Currently , the CD-ROM is available only on the Macintosh platform for about $ 30 . Voyager officials say a Windows version will be out by the end of the year . &quot; Redshift &quot; is the first software_product developed in Russia to be generally available in the West and it ' s a stunner . ( The program is in English and the title refers not to the favorite color of the former regime there , but to the term used to describe the increase in the wavelength of light of an object in the universe as it moves away from an observer ) . The dimensions of the program , commissioned by London-based Maris Software , are mind-boggling . The program includes depiction of a sky full of about 250 # 000 known stars , 40 # 000 deep_space objects , 5 # 011 asteroids , the planets in our solar_system and all their known moons . &quot; Redshift &quot; allows you to choose any moment in time between 4 # 000 BC and AD 11 # 000 to check on the position of the planets . And it allows you to view this from more_than 1 # 000 vantage_points in the solar_system . Once you pick your time and place , you can set the planets and moons in motion to watch how they progress in relationship to each other . For example , you can choose to sit on Jupiter ' s moon , Io , and watch how the giant planet would have risen_up into view on the day the Declaration_of_Independence was adopted . The view is a quantum leap up from the simple renderings of planets we studied in school . The heavenly_bodies in &quot; Redshift &quot; are amazingly detailed , and the quality of the light shining on them changes with their movements in relationship to the sun and other objects . There are numerous controls to manipulate -- you can speed_up or slow_down time , zoom_in or out , or change the angle_of_view . And if all this isn ' t enough , &quot; Redshift &quot; also includes 700 full-screen photographs of planets , moons , nebulae and galaxies , and it comes_with a dictionary of astronomy that includes more_than 2 # 000 entries . At its best , &quot; Redshift &quot; provides a hint of the wonder we felt as kids when staring up at the night sky . But &quot; Redshift &quot; is no kiddie program and it ' s not a game . It ' s for serious study of the heavens , whether by professional or amateur astronomer . Once the novelty of &quot; Redshift &quot; wears_off , those with only a passing interest in the field will probably not delve much further into it . But it ' s undeniably spectacular and bodes well for what can be done_in the future on CD-ROM . &quot; Redshift &quot; is available in_stores and through mail_order for both Macintosh and Windows platforms for about $ 50 .</TEXT>
