   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / QUARTERFINALS ; SOCCER / GRAHAME L . JONES ; TIME FOR SCORERS TO SCORE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Agatha Christie would have loved this World Cup . In three weeks , the tournament has featured more twists and turns , more unexpected developments , more mysterious goings-on , than any World Cup in recent memory . There have been surprises on and off the field , and tragedies , too . Consider : -- The slaughter of innocent World Cup viewers in an Irish pub , a crime that prompted an editorial cartoonist in the Times of London to depict a gun-toting terrorist proudly holding aloft the World Cup trophy , its design altered to resemble a death ' s head rather than a globe . -- The still unexplained air crash that caused the deaths of Mexican World Cup fans traveling_to Washington , D.C. , to support their team . -- The murder in Medellin , Colombia , of Colombian World Cup player Andres Escobar , a crime whose roots have yet to be uncovered . -- The failed drug test and subsequent banishment of Argentine star Diego Maradona . As disturbing as all_of these developments have been , they have not managed to detract from what , to this point , has been a successful World Cup . By any measurement , the 1994 tournament must be considered the most incident-packed and gripping of any in the last two decades . Despite the initial skepticism of foreign journalists , the fans have flocked to the stadiums in record numbers , television ratings have been consistently higher than expected , and goals have been scored dramatically and , in some games , frequently . And there is still more to come . In this weekend ' s quarterfinals , the eight survivors of the original 24 teams are set to write four new chapters in the unfolding drama . On Saturday , Italy and Spain square_off at Foxboro Stadium , then later in the day is potentially the finest game of the tournament , Brazil and the_Netherlands at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas . On Sunday , defending champion Germany takes_on upstart Bulgaria at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford , N.J. , then Sweden and Romania meet at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto . In many ways , they are an unlikely batch , these eight quarterfinalists . Only two of them , Italy , which finished third , and Germany , which won the trophy , were in the final eight four years ago . Bulgaria has advanced farther than ever before , although it can thank Mexico ' s inexplicable inability to make penalty kicks for that . Romania , deserving conqueror of scandal-plagued Argentina in the second round , gives Eastern Europe two quarterfinalists for the second consecutive tournament . In Italia ' 90 , Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia reached the final eight . Like Bulgaria , this is also the farthest Romania has progressed . The last time Sweden advanced this far was in 1958 , when it staged the tournament and finished second to Brazil . The Brazilians themselves last reached the quarterfinals in Mexico in 1986 , when they were ousted by France on penalty kicks_in Guadalajara after one of the great World Cup matches . Also eliminated on penalty kicks_in the 1986 quarterfinals was Spain , which fell to Belgium that year in its most successful recent performance . Finally , there is the_Netherlands , which has to look_back to 1978 , when it finished second to Argentina , for its best recent run at the Cup . So why did these eight teams survive while the rest fell by the wayside ? What common_denominators are there that have kept them alive ? Are there any weaknesses that would indicate they will not go much farther ? Goals take teams through tournaments . Teams that can ' t score can ' t win , so it is no surprise to see many of the world ' s best scorers still in the competition : Juergen Klinsmann and Rudi Voeller of Germany ; Romario and Bebeto of Brazil ; Dennis Bergkamp of the_Netherlands ; Gheorghe Hagi and Ilie Dumitrescu of Romania ; Martin Dahlin of Sweden ; Hristo Stoitchkov of Bulgaria and Roberto Baggio of Italy . But every one of them is going_to run_into a more difficult defense and a more dominating goalkeeper in the quarterfinals than they have faced so far , which should result in some fascinating duels . Here , in the context of the matchups , are some clues to why some will succeed and others fail . SPAIN-ITALY The Spanish have reached this point by sheer hard work , by adopting a physically bruising approach at times and by not yet having had to play a truly difficult opponent in a game that mattered . South_Korea , Bolivia and Switzerland were not true tests for Spain , which tied its other game , against Germany , by mutual consent . Goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta has been praised by Coach Javier Clemente , but the Italian forwards are likely to make him work a lot harder on Saturday to stay in Clemente ' s good graces . Two goals against Nigeria on Tuesday might finally free Baggio from the shackles of expectation that were chained to him by the Italian media and fans . Now , if he has shaken_off the nagging injury that has kept him from peak fitness , he and teammates Giuseppe Signori and Daniele Massaro will make life miserable for Spain . On the other hand , if the Italians are exhausted from their two-hour battle with the Nigerians , the Spanish , who have had the benefit of three days ' extra rest , could shut them down and snatch a game winner on the counterattack , which is their forte . Italy has lost to Ireland , beaten Norway , tied Mexico and beaten Nigeria while fighting injuries , red cards , poor officiating and the usual intense pressure from the Italian media . In other words , they are enduring their typical World Cup . BRAZIL-NETHERLANDS No game in the tournament has been as eagerly anticipated as this one , which matches the two most technically gifted sides in the World Cup . If they play to their optimum level , it could be a game for the ages . The Brazilians have been both dominant and unconvincing , if such a mix is possible . Cameroon , Russia and the United States hardly constitute tough opposition , and when the Brazilians ran_into the organized and disciplined Swedes , they managed only a tie . The Dutch have been equally unconvincing , albeit attractive . They move the ball in bewildering patterns , keeping control seemingly without effort while they try to create an opening . Bergkamp could have had several goals by now , had his shooting luck been better . Teammate Wim Jonk has provided added impetus from midfield . Ronald Koeman possesses the most dangerous free_kick in the world . But still there are questions about the_Netherlands ' vulnerability to the swift counterattack . Faced with the twin threats of Romario and Bebeto , it is likely that the Dutch will yield a goal or two , which means Bergkamp and company will have to come_through at the other end . The Dutch struggled to defeat Saudi_Arabia and Morocco , lost to Belgium in a game they dominated offensively , then beat Ireland with some ease . Brazil will provide their toughest test to date . GERMANY-BULGARIA It is almost impossible to envision the defending champion not being able to win this game , especially with Bulgaria having had to endure two hours of agony while keeping Mexico at_bay before advancing on penalty kicks . Stoitchkov is in superb form , but the Germans have had three days ' extra rest and the combination of Klinsmann and Voeller up front will torment the Bulgarian defense . If Bulgaria is to have a chance , it will have to shut_down not only the two strikers but their principal supplier , Thomas Haessler , who is quietly enjoying an excellent tournament . Bulgarian goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov thrust himself into the running for the Yashin Cup , awarded the tournament ' s top goalkeeper , with his penalty-saving performance against Mexico and could enhance his chances if he can hold the Germans scoreless . But don ' t count_on it . The Germans have tied Spain and defeated Bolivia , South_Korea and Belgium en route to the quarterfinals and this test is no more difficult than any of those . Bulgaria , meanwhile , has beaten Greece and Argentina , lost to Nigeria and tied Mexico . SWEDEN-ROMANIA One of the World Cup ' s most potent offenses meets what is undoubtedly its best midfield-defense combination . The Swedes are solid at the back , with midfielders Jonas Thern and Stefan Schwarz acting_as fifth and sixth defenders in front of the back four . On attack , Tomas Brolin provides the inspiration while Dahlin and Kennet Andersson finish_off the chances created . The combination has resulted in victories over Russia and Saudi_Arabia and ties with Cameroon and Brazil . Romania , on the other hand , possesses the twin talents of Hagi and Dumitrescu , who read each other so well that their combination play is virtually flawless . Each can create or score goals and , if they fail , Florin Raducioiu returns from a one-game suspension to pick_up the slack . Romania has had only one lapse , a loss to Switzerland , while defeating Colombia , the United States and Argentina . That last victory has raised spirits immensely and a place in the semifinals is quite possible . Which teams will make the final four ? that ' s a mystery only Agatha Christie could solve .</TEXT>
