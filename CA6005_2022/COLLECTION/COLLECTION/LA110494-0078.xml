   <TEXT> Never with fiction , but occasionally with accounts of great insights -- such_as discovering the extent of the universe , its nature , or its origin -- I begin my reading with the conclusion . I like to know the author ' s thoughts on the implications of whatever it is that has just been recounted before I begin . Alan Dressler ' s startling prognostications in a concluding essay in &quot; Voyage to the Great Attractor &quot; drove me with some excitement to Page 1 . Dressler , an astronomer based at the Pasadena office of the Carnegie Institution ( which controls the Mount Wilson Observatories as well as a telescope in Las Companas in Chile ) is an expert in intergalactic_space . He is also an excellent observer of human nature . His talent as an astronomer got him invited to participate in a unique galactic survey that resulted in a discovery that compelled his colleagues to re-conceptualize the texture of the universe . His skill as a writer enabled him to describe the strengths and weaknesses of each member of the survey team , including himself , which explains the startling coda . Dressler sees humankind on the verge of mastering the molecular_biology of the human genetic package as well as the equally complicated and related biology of the human brain . Because he believes we will be unable to resist opening the Pandora ' s box of manipulating our own DNA , he suggests that &quot; we are most likely near the end of what we have known as humanity , &quot; and predicts that a new species will appear &quot; either here on Earth , or out among the stars , &quot; where &quot; humans may be destined to evolve a variety of sentient creatures who will carry_on the exploration of the hyperspatial domain. &quot; Hyperspace , where galaxies beyond galaxies recede from us even as we race toward them , includes the stars that compose the supercluster of galaxies known as the Great Attractor . That object , however , was unknown when the seven astronomers joined in 1980 to make an unprecedented large-scale map of about 500 elliptical galaxies , probably the oldest galaxies in the universe . Writing in the first_person , and frequently in elegant poetic language , he introduces each member of the team , like an astronaut who is recounting a group adventure . Dressler ' s team , later dubbed the &quot; seven samurai , &quot; was led by the then-36-year-old Sandy Faber from the Lick Observatory near Santa Cruz . She had mentored four of the participants and knew their work intimately . They would be using telescopes on four continents in both hemispheres . Dressler tells us about how each one came_to astronomy and eventually to the project from their home bases around the United States and Great Britain . Dressler has been able to distill these personalities , describe insights and errors , and maintain suspense as he moves from revelation to frustration to reconsidered revelation . All the while he gently explains how astronomers work , how bigger telescopes do not see &quot; deeper &quot; but rather gather ever more faint sources of light , which they study through spectroscopy , a way of analyzing the chemical makeup of distant objects . Dressler takes us along with him as he discovers that he has made the kind of trivial mistake anyone could have made . In correcting it , however , he revealed a phenomenon so preposterous that all_the team members had to convince themselves that it was right before they could present their conclusions to the world . And he describes the ecstasy of discovery . Ramifications of the discovery of the Great Attractor include acknowledging that the universe is lumpier than had been assumed ( a view recently verified by the pictures from NASA ' s COBE satellite ) , filled with huge areas of cold dark matter and vast empty spaces . Frank and personal , Dressler exposes his astronomers , their egos and temperaments in conflict at the blackboard , the telescope and the computer , as they feud and fuss but finally come_together in their 1986 presentation to present evidence that an enormous galactic structure is distorting an expanding universe .</TEXT>
