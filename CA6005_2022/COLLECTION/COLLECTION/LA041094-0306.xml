   <HEADLINE> YMCA NEEDS VOLUNTEERS FOR SOCCER PROGRAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now that the vacant_lot at 3rd and Bixel streets is to be turned_into a temporary soccer field , volunteers are needed to establish a recreation program there . An alliance of neighbors , businesses , social_service agencies , the Ketchum-Downtown YMCA and the police persuaded Cathay City Development , the owner of the property , to allow the lot to be used for recreation in the absence of immediate development plans . The YMCA seeks coaches , insured drivers , grant writers and people who can help with security or teach gardening , art or pet care . In addition , the Y needs volunteers who are bilingual in Spanish or Korean and anyone who can maintain a computer_database for the program . Volunteers are also needed to survey schools , churches and community organizations in developing a plan to transport children to and from the field . The Community Recreation Field Project Team will meet at 5:30 p.m. Monday and April 25 on the second floor of the Mayfair Hotel , 1256 West 7th St . Information : Kathy Bates at ( 213 ) 624-2348 , Ext . 240 .</TEXT>
