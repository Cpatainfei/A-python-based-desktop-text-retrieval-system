   <HEADLINE> EX-GUERRILLAS , EXILES NAMED TO MANDELA CABINET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Election officials on Friday formally proclaimed last week ' s all-race elections &quot; substantially free and fair , &quot; and Nelson Mandela , president-to-be of the first post-apartheid government , immediately named 17 members of his new Cabinet . For first deputy president , the most closely watched spot , Mandela chose Thabo Mbeki , the urbane chairman of the African National Congress . He bypassed Cyril Ramaphosa , the popular ANC general secretary who was widely touted for the slot after his success as the ANC ' s chief negotiator . Ramaphosa subsequently declined any Cabinet post in an apparent rift with Mandela . Frederik W . de Klerk , the outgoing white president , will be appointed executive deputy president of the coalition government . His National Party , which has ruled South_Africa since 1948 , lost to the ANC by a margin of more_than 3-to-1 in the first elections in which the country ' s black majority was allowed to vote . Under the nation ' s new political_system of proportional_representation , the National Party will get six places in the 27-member Cabinet . They include such powerful portfolios as finance , home affairs and constitutional development . Mandela told reporters that he will retain the current finance_minister , Derek Keys , in his post . The move is aimed at reassuring the country ' s mainly white business_leaders -- as well as potential investors and aid donors overseas -- who are nervous about the ANC ' s still untested economic_policies . &quot; We realize the importance of leaving the department , the portfolio , of finance as it is -- without interference , &quot; Mandela told reporters in Cape_Town after a three-hour meeting with De Klerk . He has previously said he would recommend that Chris Stals , governor of the Central_Bank , be retained when his term ends in July . Mandela said De Klerk had complained that naming a Cabinet was premature and had asked him to reconsider several choices . Mandela , who shared last year ' s Nobel Peace Prize with De Klerk , said he would take the request back to his advisers . &quot; As far as we are concerned , it is a decision which is final , but when you are working in a government of national unity , you can ' t talk_about finalities , &quot; he said . &quot; You have to take_into_account the concerns of the parties with whom you are going_to work. &quot; Despite Mandela ' s frequent promises of a gender-equal society , he named only two women to his Cabinet , giving them the portfolios of health and public enterprises . His estranged wife , Winnie Mandela , was elected to Parliament but was not named to the Cabinet . Several of the new ministers are little known , but nearly all share one thing with the 75-year-old patriarch of the anti-apartheid struggle : They either suffered in prison with Mandela , fought as guerrillas against white authorities or worked from exile to end the brutal system of institutionalized segregation and white minority rule . Most are in their 50s or older . The formal transfer of power from De Klerk to Mandela , and from white to black after more_than three centuries of racial tyranny , will be at an elaborate inauguration ceremony Tuesday in Pretoria . The Independent Electoral Commission said the final vote tallies showed the ANC with a landslide victory of 12 # 237 , 655 votes , or 62.6 % of 19.5 million ballots cast . The ANC also won control of seven of nine new provincial legislatures . The total was less than the ANC goal of winning two-thirds of the vote , which would have created a majority in Parliament that would have enabled the party to rewrite the interim constitution . Mandela , surprisingly , said he was &quot; relieved &quot; that the ANC would be forced to compromise in the so-called government of national unity in drafting the charter . The National Party won 3 # 983 , 690 votes , or 20.3 % of the total . That was half of what De Klerk had called his goal but consistent with many pre-election polls . As expected , the National Party easily won the provincial race in the Western Cape region . Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi ' s Inkatha Freedom Party was third nationally with a larger-than-expected 10.5 % of the total vote . That gives them up_to three seats in Mandela ' s Cabinet and provides a major political_platform for Buthelezi , a mercurial politician whose career seemed near oblivion less than a month ago . Almost all_of Inkatha ' s votes came from bitterly contested Zulu areas in the strife-torn KwaZulu-Natal province . Although Buthelezi only joined the race a week before polls opened , Inkatha won an upset there , with a majority of 50.3 % of the vote to 32.2 % for the ANC . Other parties split the rest . Inkatha ' s come-from-behind victory in the area was tainted by allegations , by rival parties as well as independent observers , of widespread fraud and ballot rigging . But the electoral commission said it was unable to prove many of the charges . Buthelezi hailed the win as &quot; a moment of glory , because we know that the hardships we suffered and the battles we fought were not wasted. &quot; He said in a statement that South_Africans are now &quot; free_of oppression , free_of racialism and , most of all , free_of apartheid. &quot; The Freedom Front , which campaigned for a homeland for Afrikaners , was fourth in the national polls with 2.1 % of the total . The Democratic Party , a white liberal group , won 1.7 % , and the Pan-Africanist Congress , a radical black group that was once the ANC ' s chief rival , won only 1.2 % . The tally gives the ANC 252 seats in the 400-seat National Parliament , which will convene for the first time Monday in Cape_Town to formally elect Mandela president . The National Party will get 82 seats and Inkatha 43 . Results were announced a week after polls closed on a remarkable election . There was little or no violence , although millions of voters were forced to line_up for hours or even days . But poor planning and logistic bungling complicated the polling and slowed the counting . &quot; Many said it would be impossible , &quot; Johann Kriegler , the electoral commission chairman , said at a news_conference at a convention center north of Johannesburg . &quot; And it very nearly was . We had the will , but not the time. &quot; During the elections , he said , &quot; we managed to pull_back from disaster &quot; by using the army and air_force to deliver millions of extra ballots and voting materials and by extending voting in some areas to a fourth day . Despite a near breakdown in counting , he said , &quot; once again disaster was narrowly averted. &quot; Kriegler said &quot; no deals &quot; were struck in KwaZulu-Natal to allow Inkatha to win_over ANC complaints . And he said the country must prepare a voters roll before the next election . &quot; It is virtually impossible to run an election without &quot; such a list , he said . International observer missions from the United Nations , the Commonwealth , the European Union and the Organization of African Unity quickly endorsed the electoral commission ' s assessment and results . &quot; The outcome of the elections reflects the will of the people of South_Africa , &quot; the missions said in a joint statement . Mbeki was always a likely candidate for Mandela ' s deputy president . He was the ANC ' s most visible diplomat during its long exile . He left the country in 1961 and studied economics at Sussex University in England and military strategy in the Soviet_Union . He is the son of an ANC stalwart , Govan Mbeki , who was jailed with Mandela . But several of Mandela ' s other top choices raised questions and eyebrows . He named Alfred Nzo , an enigmatic former ANC leader , as foreign_minister to replace Roelof F . ( Pik ) Botha , who has held the post since 1977 . Nzo went_into exile in 1964 and served as ANC secretary_general from 1969 until 1991 , when he was eased out as a poor administrator . Nzo is little-known at_home or abroad and is not listed in the current &quot; Who ' s Who in South_African Politics. &quot; Joe Modise , the portly former commander of the ANC ' s largely unsuccessful guerrilla army , Spear of the Nation , was named defense minister . He was criticized for condoning torture at ANC camps prior to 1990 and has had little success in his attempts to create a national peacekeeping force made_up of former black guerrillas , homeland forces and white soldiers . Other Mandela choices were applauded . Dullah Omar , a respected civil_rights and community lawyer in Cape_Town , will be justice minister . Trevor Manuel , a civil_engineer who played a key role in drawing_up the ANC platform for reconstruction and development , was given trade and industry . Jay Naidoo , a trade_unionist who helped found the nation ' s largest labor federation , will help oversee the redevelopment plan as minister without portfolio . And Joe Slovo , the avuncular Communist_Party chairman who emerged as a crucial problem-solver in the oft-bitter negotiations for democracy , was given the portfolio of housing and welfare .</TEXT>
