   <HEADLINE> THOUSANDS OF RWANDAN REFUGEES AT LAND ' S END AS ZAIRE CLOSES BORDER ; AFRICA : ORDER HALTS STREAM OF HUMANITY FLEEING ACROSS BRIDGE IN ADVANCE OF FRENCH PULLOUT . U.N. OFFICIALS PROTEST CLOSURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Facing a mounting refugee tide , Zaire closed its border with Rwanda on Saturday , sending a ripple of panic through tens of thousands of escaping Rwandans . After 24 hours of vague warnings , the Zairian government at 2 p.m. abruptly halted the stream of refugees shuffling across a one-lane bridge from Rwanda into Bukavu . They had been crossing at the rate of about 100 a minute since the border was opened at its regular time of 6 a.m. Perhaps two_dozen refugees plunged into the dark_blue current of the Rusizi River and swam the 40 yards to Zaire , some pulling their cattle with them . At least one small child was rescued from drowning . Dozens more refugees piled into overloaded fishing_boats to make the crossing . A handful of Zairian soldiers threw_up barriers on the rickety bridge and enforced the closure with whistles and brandished guns . The sight sent thousands of panicked Rwandans surging against French troops providing security on the Rwandan side of the bridge , but the_French were able to stop the advance . Within an hour , calm was restored . The 15 # 000 or more refugees left behind merely stood on the edge of their country , some with their belongings balanced on their heads . They stared blankly across the river to where nearly 80 # 000 of their compatriots had already escaped . A few gathered water and went_about their everyday chores , but most seemed overcome with uncertainty . Virtually all_of these people have been_on the run_for weeks , drifting from northern villages into the Rwandan border area where the_French have maintained a &quot; safe zone. &quot; On Saturday , two truckloads of Ethiopian troops under U.N. command arrived_at the bridge to relieve some of the_French troops , who are preparing to pull_out of Rwanda at midnight tonight . Refugees have voiced great mistrust of the United Nations , and many had timed their flight to Zaire in_advance of the_French pullout . U.N. officials protested the closure of the border and expressed dismay that countless families were separated . Many refugees had grown accustomed to free movement here ; they frequently sent one or two family members back into Rwanda for firewood , which is in short supply in Bukavu . Late Saturday , Zaire issued a statement indicating that an infusion of international aid into the frontier zone might persuade it to reopen the border . The government had ordered the closure to prevent another Goma , the border town 70 miles north of here where a_million Rwandans have gathered , spreading disease and disorder in the region . Already , the population of Bukavu has swelled 50 % from the migration of refugees , foreshadowing another health crisis . Up to 100 # 000 refugees are massed on the city ' s sidewalks , traffic_circles , parks and front_yards . There are virtually no sanitation facilities ; as fast as relief workers can dig trench latrines , periodic downpours fill them up . Outlying space for refugee camps is already jammed . And officials said there is nowhere except downtown Bukavu to direct the incoming stream of Rwandans until at least Tuesday , when a new but distant camp is supposed to be ready for occupancy . But the heavy rains already threaten the dirt access_road to that camp . Perhaps 40 # 000 people have died already in camps in Goma , and the United Nations and many humanitarian groups here have argued that Rwandans are better_off in their own country than as squatters in Zaire . But that sentiment was not evident in the faces of the thousands stopped at the bridge_over the Rusizi . Many , fearing they will be mistreated or killed under the new government that has taken_over their country , had walked for days to make their escape -- only to be halted just yards from their goal . Even more poignant was the sight of a young_man who was not to be daunted by the sight of Zairian soldiers . From a flat bank on the Rwandan side of the river , the man bundled his goods in a scarf . He waded into the water , where the current carried him 200 yards downstream . There , on a rock , he rested . Thousands of refugees on both sides of the border began to cheer him on . He plunged into the water and swam again . A soldier , waving a gun , scrambled down the 200-foot embankment in chase . &quot; Left ! Go left ! &quot; the crowd in Rwanda shouted . The man scrambled to the left . With the soldier closing in , he climbed a steep rock , heaved his bundle ahead of him and melted into a crowd of fellow Rwandans as a thunderous cheer rose from both sides of the river .</TEXT>
