   <HEADLINE> YOUTHS TEACH PEERS ABOUT SEXUAL HEALTH ; MEDICINE : T.H.E. CLINIC IS FOR , ABOUT AND RUN BY KIDS WHO EDUCATE OTHERS ABOUT SUBJECTS RANGING FROM PREGNANCY TO BIRTH_CONTROL AND AIDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Enlightening other teen-agers about sexual health and disease prevention is not something that Jovan Colbert ever thought he ' d be doing . &quot; I used to think like most people my age thought -- nothing can affect me , &quot; said the 18-year-old Dorsey High_School senior , a recent hire at T.H.E. Clinic ' s teen facility in Crenshaw . &quot; But the fact of the_matter is , teens are sexually active , and they don ' t know all_the risks involved. &quot; That pragmatic approach to sex education is what drove T.H.E. director Sylvia Drew Ivie to open a clinic for , about and run entirely by teen-agers . The clinic operates_on Ivie ' s belief that teen-agers communicate best with their peers . &quot; Often , teens are too shy to discuss things with the regular nurses , &quot; said Ivie , whose main clinic specializes in low-cost or free women ' s health_care . &quot; When I looked_at all_the different programs that address teens , I saw that the program that worked most was teens doing things themselves . So that ' s how we set it up. &quot; The teen center is housed in a spacious back wing of the clinic at 3970 Martin_Luther_King Jr . Blvd . What was once an ad-hoc conference area is now a waiting area , lounge and four individual counseling rooms where teen advocates talk privately with clients about everything from pregnancy scares to proper condom use . The lounge , called &quot; the living room , &quot; is a comfortable-looking space filled with overstuffed sofas and a monitor that plays informational videos . The 14 part-time advocates , trained by the California Regional Family_Planning Council , also present health workshops at schools , churches and other community_centers . Although the presentations and skits are sometimes &quot; not taken seriously enough &quot; by young audiences , advocate Carlton Stubbs said , the message that he and his co-workers bring is no laughing matter . &quot; I learned a lot about how AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases spread , and I was surprised that it ' s growing fastest among teen-agers , &quot; said Stubbs , of Ladera Heights . &quot; You always think_about somebody older getting_it and dying . It ' s important that our ( black ) community knows this information. &quot; Another problem faced by the clinic was a reluctance by teen-agers , especially boys , to admit that they need help . Clinic Director Auleria Eakins , 20 , said the addition of male advocates helped , although girls still far outnumber boys as clients . &quot; The boys believe that nothing can happen to them -- it ' s more of a macho thing , &quot; Eakins said . &quot; They think that going_to a clinic makes them look_like punks , like they don ' t know everything . But the problem among teen-agers is all_the same : They lack information. &quot; Tylar Moore , who became an advocate with the new clinic after months of screening teen-agers at T.H.E. , said she hopes that the facility will encourage young people to come_in before they are in_trouble . &quot; Most of the teens were coming_in because of a problem -- not for information , &quot; said Moore , a 17-year-old Dorsey student who aspires to be a neurosurgeon . &quot; But it ' s better now that we have our own space . We used to take people in whatever room was available. &quot; Added Ivie : &quot; T.H.E. means ' To Help Everyone. ' We ' re trying to do just that. &quot;</TEXT>
