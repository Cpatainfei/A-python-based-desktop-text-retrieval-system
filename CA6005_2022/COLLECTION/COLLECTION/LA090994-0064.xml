   <HEADLINE> ART ; STORMS OF CREATIVITY ; JEANINE BREAKER LOOKS SKYWARD IN EXPRESSING TAUT EMOTION IN HER SMALL PASTEL WORKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is weather that first moves Los Angeles artist Jeanine Breaker to create her finely drawn landscapes . Not the temperate Southern California kind , but the weather she saw as a girl , growing_up on a Wisconsin farm : for example , the storms that devastated crops just before harvest_time and decimated farmers ' incomes . &quot; I start with an environmental_condition that takes my breath away , &quot; she said . &quot; The sky gives me gifts. &quot; Breaker ' s more_than 30 small but mighty pastel works_on view in Pierce College ' s Art_Gallery , several of them diptychs , are not only about weather or the natural environment , though . They are also landscapes of the mind , operatic renderings of the turbulent emotions that roar through body and soul and leave their own kind of devastation if they catch a person unaware . Within most of the images are tiny figures facing danger . One hangs from a wire ; another is up a pole or about to fall_into a giant crevice . Fire threatens people in more_than one work . Yet Breaker ' s dark but richly colorful pastels convey anything but gloom and doom . The work &quot; is about vulnerability and facing strife , and optimism , &quot; Breaker said . &quot; It ' s about putting yourself in precarious positions so you can grow . The figures are in peril , off-balance , but they haven ' t lost their footing . They haven ' t fallen_in the fire . It ' s not a negative to be in those positions , but it ' s hard. &quot; &quot; These are works that expose our subconscious fears , rages , longings and ambitions , and still project a burst of optimism and courage that is so integral to what is positive in the human spirit , &quot; said gallery director Joan Kahn . &quot; They made me think_about danger and risk and being courageous in one ' s own life . There ' s this real sense of life and vitality and great_power in them. &quot; To ensure that viewers understand the intended meanings of each work , Breaker titles each one and includes the phonetic spelling of the title words and selected definitions of them , much as they appear in a dictionary . Inspired by an image of a burning rain_forest in Belize , &quot; rainwalk &quot; ( titles are lower case ) , includes the definition , &quot; a walk as part of a ritual to invoke precipitation. &quot; With &quot; cold shut , &quot; in which two people can ' t seem to get_together , we are told that it means , &quot; brought_together at too low a temperature to properly unite. &quot; &quot; The words add a dimension to the work ; it is more visually enriched because of the titles , &quot; she said . &quot; People are more accessed to the work . I lend my own interpretation of the pieces through the words . It feels real complete when I put visual art and words together. &quot; Breaker ' s landscape images have been inspired by real landscapes such_as those of Bryce and Zion national_parks and the Betatikin Cliff Dwelling in the Navajo National_Monument in Arizona . Though she takes photographs of landscapes that appeal_to her , she does not work from the pictures . She looks_at them to &quot; capture the mood , &quot; and then puts them away , she said . &quot; If I allow the mood to happen , then the figures come_to me . Then the titles present themselves to me . I have to feel the figures because I can ' t see them when I draw them . The chalk is too big. &quot; &quot; I like the fact that ( the small works ) look_like 5-by-7 photographs . A friend said , ' They are like film stills . You see into them , next to them , above them and below them. ' I ' m also whispering in the little ones . Of course , they ' re all self-portraits. &quot; WHERE AND WHEN What : &quot; Jeanine Breaker , Pastels. &quot; Location : Pierce College Art_Gallery , 6201 Winnetka Ave. , Woodland Hills . Hours : 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday . Ends Sept . 22 . Call : ( 818 ) 719-6498 .</TEXT>
