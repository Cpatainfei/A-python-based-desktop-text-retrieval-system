   <HEADLINE> THE NARROWING GAP ; TRADE GAINS IN EUROPE OFFSET RECORD IMPORTS FROM FAR EAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nation ' s trade_deficit dropped nearly 13 % in August to $ 9.74 billion , as a shrinking trade imbalance with Western Europe offset record imports from Japan and China , the Commerce_Department reported Wednesday . Increases in the export of aircraft , autos , tobacco , semiconductors and industrial machinery pushed U.S. exports to a record high . The total August deficit in goods and services was an improvement over the revised $ 11.19-billion shortfall in July , the second-worst trade_gap ever . The drop_in the deficit was the first since a 1.6 % decline in October , 1993 . The strength of American trade was notable in_relation_to Western Europe , whose nations are slowly pulling_out of a punishing recession . U.S. exports there grew and imports fell . &quot; We did a very good job in selling goods abroad , &quot; said Larry Moran , a research economist at the Commerce_Department ' s Bureau of Economic Analysis . But analysts pointed_out that 1994 continues to be a bad trade year for the United States , which is importing far more_than it exports , particularly now that the U.S. economy is growing strongly . In the first eight months of the year , the trade_deficit was running at an annual rate of $ 147.4 billion . The record is $ 152.1 billion , set_in 1987 . In particular , the trade_deficit with Japan , one of the United States ' major trading partners , soared to its third-highest level ever , mainly because Americans continue to import and buy large_numbers of Japanese cars . The growth was also tied to the strength of the yen against the dollar . &quot; Our economies are in quite different stages of the business_cycle , &quot; said Robert Z . Lawrence , a professor of international trade at Harvard_University ' s Kennedy School of Government . &quot; We are growing rapidly , and they are not . . . . That clouds the question of whether or not they are becoming more open. &quot; As for China , whose economy continues to blossom , it is sending a record volume of goods to a voracious U.S. market , including toys and apparel , while buying relatively little , analysts said . For their part , investors who worried that the August trade figures indicate the nation ' s economy is running too hot sent yields on the benchmark 30-year Treasury_bond up_to 7.89 % from Tuesday ' s 7.86 % . But the Dow Jones industrial average closed_up 18.50 points at 3 # 936.04. The trade_deficit with Japan rose in August to $ 5.8 billion from $ 5.7 billion in July and prompted a renewed call by U.S. auto_makers for Japan to live_up_to its commitments to open its markets . &quot; Without a doubt , we are headed for a record deficit in automotive trade with Japan this year , despite the effects of the strong yen and improved competitiveness of the U.S. auto industry , &quot; Andrew H . Card Jr. , president of the American Automobile Manufacturing Assn. , said in a statement Wednesday . Imports of goods from Japan reached a record $ 10.67 billion , surpassing the $ 10.6 billion reached in March . Auto imports accounted_for more_than half the increase , said Haydn R . Mearkle , assistant chief of the foreign trade division of the Commerce_Department ' s Bureau_of_the_Census . The rise in imports more_than offset an increase in U.S. exports of goods to Japan , which climbed to $ 4.87 billion from $ 4.37 billion . Much of the increase was in the form of aircraft exports . It will be months , if then , before the trade figures reflect the effects of the recent agreement between Washington and Tokyo on opening Japanese markets in telecommunications and medical equipment , government procurement and other areas . The situation was different in Western Europe , where the trade_deficit shrank to $ 1.62 billion in August from $ 2.37 billion in July . Imports from Europe fell 3.1 % to $ 10.7 billion ; exports rose 4.6 % to $ 9.1 billion . The Commerce_Department provided no details of either . But analysts attributed the performance to improved financial_conditions on the Continent . &quot; Europe is_on the road to recovery , so exports are starting to pick_up and may explain why there ' s a better balance there , &quot; said Cynthia Latta , senior financial economist at DRI / McGraw-Hill in Lexington , Mass . The U.S. deficit with China rose a whopping 21.3 % to $ 3.24 billion in August , one of the highest deficits with a nation other_than Japan . Imports grew to $ 4.15 billion in August from $ 3.64 billion in July , reflecting a wide variety of goods , including toys and apparel . A decrease in U.S. fertilizer shipments to China , meanwhile , offset an increase in aircraft exports and contributed to a drop_in overall exports , to $ 919 million from $ 971 million in July . U.S. Trade Picture Improves Month-by-month changes in the government ' s new trade report , which includes trade_in services as well as goods . The charts track the overall deficit , the deficit in goods and the surplus in_services , in billions of dollars : OVERALL DEFICIT : -9.74 DEFICIT IN GOODS : -14.30 SURPLUS IN SERVICES : + 4.56 Source : Commerce_Department</TEXT>
