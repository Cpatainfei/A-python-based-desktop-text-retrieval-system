   <HEADLINE> VALLEY BRIEFING : OIL_PIPELINES ; CARRYING CRUDE BELOW THE VALLEYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The rupture of an oil_pipeline during the Northridge earthquake has prompted some residents and public officials to call_for extra safeguards on the lines that cross underneath the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys . When the Jan . 17 quake fractured an Arco pipeline on Wolfskill Street in San Fernando , the crude caught_fire , seriously burned a man and charred 17 cars and a house . The line passes below O ' Melveny Street School , but officials in San Fernando , , Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Unified School District are divided on how-and if-the line can be relocated . Two of the lines crossing the Valley are owned by Arco Oil and its subsidiaries . A pipeline owned by Mobil Oil , known as the M-70 line , was installed three years ago to replace an aging-and leaky-pipeline that was installed in 1929 .
