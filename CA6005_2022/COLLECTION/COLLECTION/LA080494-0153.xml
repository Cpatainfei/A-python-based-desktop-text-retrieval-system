   <HEADLINE> SIGHTS ; AGE CANNOT WITHER , NOR CUSTOM STALE THE ART OF BEATRICE WOOD ; AN EXHIBIT OF WRYLY HUMOROUS AND VIBRANT DRAWINGS BY THE OJAI ARTIST IS_ON DISPLAY AT THE CARNEGIE MUSEUM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When it comes_to Beatrice Wood , Ojai ' s venerable grand dame of the arts , the pesky age issue is certainly relative . It has been over a year since the media descended on her for the occasion of her 100th birthday . Now , Wood is simply getting_on_with the business of living , continuing to produce work in two and three dimensions -- ceramic vessels , tableaux and drawings . At 101 , she is still blessed with the wry levity and flowing hand that artists a fraction of her age should envy . Youth prevails , regardless of what numbers tell us . And that ' s an underlying theme of &quot; Dialogues : Drawings by Beatrice Wood , &quot; another coup for the Carnegie Art Museum . This cohesive group of images focuses_on the risky playground of social_intercourse . But Wood -- alias &quot; Beato &quot; -- casts a suspicious eye on the ulterior motives and duplicity in social settings , showing the kind of skeptical bemusement you might expect of a perceptive young_person . Wood has gracefully assimilated the influences gained from her role in seminal 20th Century art . Accounts of the artist ' s life can hardly refrain_from mentioning her intellectual and / or romantic entanglements with such figures as Marcel Duchamp , Edward Weston , Brancusi and Henri-Pierre Roche ( author of &quot; Jules and Jim , &quot; speculated to be about Wood ) . What self-respecting , history-loving art observer can get_around her reputation by association ? Wood ' s cachet as a living legend travels with her wherever she , or her work , goes . Although known for often bedazzling and intricate ceramic works , Wood leans toward an almost naive airiness once her drawing persona takes_over . Spare and unconcerned with virtuosity , Wood ' s drawings are loose and supple things , sensuous of line and sly of content . Her forms and sense of spatial distribution -- or dissection -- take cues from Cubism , resulting in a kinder , gentler variation thereof . As seen in this exhibition of devious delicacies , Wood is a master deflector of social mores . In the course of the show , we get the impression that the artist is both celebrating the social life while questioning -- sometimes even skewering -- it . Putting things in perspective , there is &quot; The Well-Fed Settling the World , &quot; depicting the discreet , ineffectual charms of the bourgeoisie . Wood shows two pieces entitled &quot; The Bore , &quot; with the offending parties depicted as overbearingly pleasant types surrounded by parties melting with tedium . She lets us in on her politics and values with such humorous scenes as &quot; Trying to Convince a Republican , &quot; with subjects reduced to arm-wrestling , or &quot; Men Trying to Discuss Politics , &quot; all contorted figures and twisted limbs . Her libertine philosophy is stated simply in &quot; Monogamy Is Impossible &quot; and &quot; Tell Us a Dirty Story. &quot; In her work , we often detect references of Wood ' s own background as a well-heeled Easterner who gave_up propriety for a more free-spirited life early in the century . Characters often suggest an earlier period in history , as in the wacky &quot; Man Introduces his Mistress to His Wife , &quot; with a top-hatted scalawag from another time . But , typical of Wood , there is no moral scorn attached_to a potentially loaded image . One tangent to the exhibition proper is the newly unveiled table , a crafty looking object , made by Wood along with Lloyd Wright in the ' 30s . Above it hangs a lithograph of Wood ' s portrait of Helen Lloyd Wright . This image is alone in the gallery for its conscious lack of irony . In her recent book , &quot; Playing Chess with the Heart , &quot; Wood writes : &quot; There are three things important in life : honesty , which means living free_of the cunning of the mind ; compassion , because if we have no concern for others , we are monsters ; and curiosity , for if the mind is not searching , it is dull and unresponsive. &quot; To that short_list might be added flexibility . In these drawings , as with much of her art , Wood dances along a fine line separating -- and intertwining -- innocence and sophistication . She remains a local treasure with a worldly reach . LOCAL HARVEST Upstairs at the museum , a juried selection of local art goes_under the peculiar moniker &quot; A Classic Celebration. &quot; There are some admirable fruits here to behold -- further proof of the artistic worthiness lurking in Ventura County . Jumping_off the wall_in the museum stairwell , Gary Salvail ' s &quot; Orange Sofa &quot; exudes a funky bewitchment , with its colorful elevation of the everyday . Kazuko Knowles shows her painting &quot; Venezia I , &quot; a rippling pattern of stones in a dark patina . Suzanne Shechter ' s fine , unabashedly Hopper-esque &quot; Union Station &quot; finds a boy in a train_station , raked with late afternoon sunlight , wallowing in a not-unpleasant aura of desolation . Meanwhile , Wilva Ehlers ' &quot; Wilva &quot; depicts its woman of leisure with appealingly chunky brushwork and a relaxed energy . Powerful Ojai artist Alberta Fins ' typically dark-toned mixed-and-mashed-media pieces contrast with Bill Woolway ' s marvelously effervescent , folksy cityscapes . Downstairs in the back gallery , &quot; Jill Sattler : Atmospheric Photography and Other Treasures , &quot; is an uneven display of photographs and assemblages , distinguished mostly by her evocative sepia-toned portraits of Beatrice Wood , flanked by girls on her 100th birthday . Details * &quot; DIALOGUES : Drawings by Beatrice Wood , &quot; through Sept . 4 at Carnegie Art Museum , 424 S . C St . in Oxnard ; 385-8157 . * ALSO at the Carnegie , &quot; Jill Sattler : Atmospheric Photography and Other Treasures &quot; and &quot; A Classic Celebration. &quot;</TEXT>
