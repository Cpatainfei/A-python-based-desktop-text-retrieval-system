   <HEADLINE> 5 IRAQIS , 1 KUWAITI SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR PLOT TO KILL BUSH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Five Iraqis and a Kuwaiti were sentenced to death Saturday for a foiled attempt to assassinate former President George_Bush in April , 1993 . Discovery of the plot led President Clinton to order a retaliatory missile attack on Baghdad . Six other Iraqis and a Kuwaiti were given prison_terms ranging from six months to 12 years for their involvement in the plot , which was uncovered the day before Bush arrived to be honored for his leadership in liberating Kuwait from Iraq in the Persian_Gulf_War . One defendant was acquitted . Death sentences in Kuwait automatically go_to an appeals court for review , a process that could take months . Capital_punishment in Kuwait is carried_out by hanging . Kuwaiti security authorities discovered a car packed with 175 pounds of explosives a day before Bush arrived in Kuwait . Prosecutors said the car was to be used to blow_up the former President , who forged the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraqi forces_out of Kuwait in February , 1991 , nearly seven months after they invaded the Gulf emirate . Prosecutors charged that most of the defendants were Iraqi intelligence_agents sent by Saddam Hussein ' s regime to kill Bush . Iraq denied masterminding the plot and vowed revenge against Kuwait for accusing it of such treachery . Iraq said Bush was &quot; not worth several kilograms of explosives. &quot; Judge Salah Fahad , the court president , called the defendants &quot; a bunch of evil men sent by Iraq to wreak havoc. &quot; &quot; As if what Iraqi intelligence did to Kuwait during the occupation was not enough , they have sent us this gang with their Kuwaiti partner to continue their shameful deeds inside Kuwait and terrorize the Kuwaiti people , &quot; he said . The defendants listened_in silence as the judge delivered the sentences . When he finished , one of the Iraqi defendants , Raad Asadi , leaped to his feet and shouted : &quot; There is no justice. &quot; Pandemonium erupted in the heavily guarded courtroom when Jabbar Kanaani , a 56-year-old Iraqi defendant , punched Asadi in the face . Asadi was the purported ringleader . Only one of the 14 defendants , 36-year-old Wali Gazali , pleaded guilty . He told the three-judge panel that Iraqi agents gave him a car packed with explosives and ordered him to blow it up at Kuwait University , where it was believed Bush was to be honored during his April 14-16 visit .</TEXT>
