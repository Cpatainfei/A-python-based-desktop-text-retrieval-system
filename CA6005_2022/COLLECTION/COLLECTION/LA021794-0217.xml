   <TEXT> A woman , her ex-husband , their 12-year-old son and her boyfriend were found shot to death Wednesday in an apparent murder-suicide on a peaceful , tree-lined street in South Pasadena . The bodies of Jane Larsen , 49 ; Gene Larsen , 64 ; Ben Larsen , 12 , and Michael O ' Brien , 44 , were discovered in a tiny beige house in the 1000 block of Foothill Street shortly before 9 a.m. Police were tight-lipped about the killings , but sheriff ' s officers , who joined South Pasadena police in the investigation , acknowledged that Gene Larsen brought a 12-gauge shotgun to the house and that the recently finalized divorce may have been the cause . &quot; At this point , &quot; said sheriff ' s spokesman Fidel Gonzales , &quot; we can ' t tell who did the shooting , but the former husband came_to the house . The divorce was final last week and it probably had something to do with this. &quot; A 12-gauge shotgun and a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun were found at the scene , authorities said . Police said that at least three of the victims had been killed with the shotgun : Ben was shot in the head and arm , Gene Larsen was shot once in the chest and Michael O ' Brien was shot in the head . No details were available regarding the weapon that killed Jane Larsen . Gene Larsen was described by acquaintances as a man with a bad_temper who could not accept the divorce . Jane Larsen taught disabled children in the Los Angeles Unified School District . Gene Larsen was an insurance_agent and Ben was a student at South Pasadena Junior_High_School . O ' Brien taught children with learning disabilities for the South Pasadena School District . A horrified neighbor discovered Ben ' s body sitting upright in the living room of the house his mother had rented about a year ago after the breakup of her marriage . Police found the bodies of the adults in a bedroom . Concerned school officials had phoned a neighbor when Ben failed to show_up for class Wednesday morning . The neighbor peeked through a window of Ben ' s home , saw the body of the youth and ran screaming to the home of Ricardo Delgado across the street . Delgado entered the home and saw a boy sitting on the couch as though he was watching television . Overhead , a shiny red banner was strung across the room , reading : &quot; Be My Valentine. &quot; Everything looked in perfect order , he said . Delgado described himself and other neighbors as &quot; depressed as hell . We ' re shocked and mad that it ' s always going_on and seems to get_worse -- the violence . And that we can ' t prevent it and that it happened to really nice , sweet people that don ' t deserve it. &quot; * Lucile Baker , who was a neighbor of the Larsens for about six years when they lived_on nearby Collis Avenue , said Jane Larsen &quot; was always afraid &quot; of her husband . &quot; He was always smarter than you or you or you . that ' s why she had to leave. &quot; Baker said that Jane Larsen was unable to continue making the mortgage payments on the Collis Avenue house after the separation and rented the little home on Foothill Street . The property belongs_to Caltrans because it is in the right_of_way of the long-proposed extension of the Long_Beach Freeway through South Pasadena . &quot; Jane was a wonderful lady , &quot; Baker said . &quot; She had a wonderful son. &quot; Gene Larsen worked for the Prudential insurance_company in Pasadena until he quit in September . A fellow employee , who declined to be identified , described him as &quot; a little forceful . Everything was wrong with the company and that sort of thing. &quot; A former neighbor who asked not to be identified said that Gene Larsen was a good father who would take Ben on helicopter rides in connection with his membership in a military_reserve unit . But he said Larsen &quot; wasn ' t a good person. &quot; He said that Jane Larsen told him a_few years ago that her husband was carrying guns and recently said he could not accept the finality of their divorce . Les Adelson , superintendent of South Pasadena Unified School District , praised both Jane Larsen ' s son and Michael O ' Brien . &quot; An outstanding , delightful young_man with outstanding citizenship , &quot; he said of Ben , who was an &quot; A &quot; student . Adelson said that a crisis_intervention team is being sent to Ben ' s school to help students deal with his death . He said that O ' Brien , who taught at Monterey Hills School , &quot; was a great guy , a warm , friendly , caring person. &quot; Adelson said parents of O ' Brien ' s learning-impaired students were being urged to come_to school with their children today to help them deal with their grief . &quot; These are fragile kids , &quot; he said , &quot; and we feel it will be a real support to have the parents there. &quot;</TEXT>
