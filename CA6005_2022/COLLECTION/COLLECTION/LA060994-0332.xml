   <HEADLINE> U.S. URGES OECD TO BROADEN ITS FOCUS , MANDATE ; RELATIONS : AT ANNUAL MEETING IN PARIS , MEXICO BECOMES THE GROUP ' S FIRST NEW MEMBER IN 20 YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher on Wednesday called_on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- often known as the West ' s &quot; rich_man ' s club &quot; -- to expand its vision and mandate to accommodate the post-Cold War world . &quot; We cannot allow new divisions to arise . Europe must_not be split into zones of prosperity and poverty , stability and insecurity , &quot; he said at the OECD ' s annual ministerial meeting , where Mexico became the group ' s first new member in more_than 20 years . By broadening its focus and membership , the OECD can coordinate economic progress at a time of accelerating change and help &quot; more countries throughout the world enter the community of advanced industrial nations , &quot; he said . The speech was part of a broader U.S. effort to reassess and adapt the political and economic institutions created after World_War_II to the post-Cold War era , according to senior U.S. officials . OECD membership is limited to democracies with market_economies . But in a clear effort to encourage non-members , Christopher said , &quot; An open , creative and dynamic OECD can help enlarge the community of free and prosperous nations throughout the world. &quot; He specifically mentioned South_Africa as well as Asian and Latin_American regions . Christopher ' s speech came as the OECD opened membership negotiations with South_Korea , which is expected to join as early as 1996 , and the four East European_countries of Hungary , Poland , Slovakia and the Czech Republic . Also Wednesday , the OECD signed a cooperation agreement with the Russian federation to provide expertise to help build a market_economy there . Eventually , the OECD will conduct a review of Russia ' s economy , identifying what works and what doesn ' t , and will offer training , technical and policy advice , U.S. officials said . &quot; Encouraging Russia ' s integration with the West is the best investment we can make in our security and in the security of all_the peoples of Europe , &quot; Christopher said . He said the actions taken by the OECD this year are historic ones that would have been unimaginable five years ago . But Christopher warned that the &quot; scourges &quot; of &quot; hunger , poverty , despotism and chaos &quot; that once plagued postwar Western Europe are still vivid elsewhere , notably in the former Yugoslavia , and threaten other areas such_as the former Soviet republics . &quot; It continues to be in the interest of the world ' s advanced industrial democracies to help ensure that dislocation does not lead to disillusionment with democratic institutions and free markets , &quot; he said . The OECD is also expected to initiate talks with China about global trade issues , U.S. officials said . But any form of membership for Beijing is still remote .</TEXT>
