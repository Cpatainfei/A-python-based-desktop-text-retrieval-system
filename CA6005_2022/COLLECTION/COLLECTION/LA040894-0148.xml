   <HEADLINE> POPE JOHN PAUL ATTENDS FIRST VATICAN CONCERT THAT MEMORIALIZES HOLOCAUST ; RELIGION : PONTIFF LOOKS_ON AS CONCENTRATION_CAMP SURVIVORS LIGHT CANDLES . AMERICAN LEADS ORCHESTRA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Holy candles burned from a menorah in the heart of the Vatican on Thursday . Six candles . One for every 1 million Jews claimed by the Holocaust . Pope John Paul II watched the candles . He sat on a tall , white-covered armchair flanked on one side by Oscar Luigi Scalfaro , the president of Italy , and on the other by Elio Toaff , the chief rabbi of Rome . They had come_to the great audience hall next to St . Peter ' s , and 7 # 500 spectators with them -- Romans , diplomats , cardinals , concentration_camp survivors -- for an extraordinary concert marking the anniversary of the Shoah , Hebrew for Holocaust . When the music ended , John Paul rose to talk_about the candles . &quot; The candles lit by some of the survivors symbolically show that this hall is without limits ; it contains all_the victims , fathers , mothers , children and friends . In this commemoration , all are present . They are with you . They are with us , &quot; he told the hushed , somberly dressed crowd in the hall where he gives his weekly general audience . As a young factory hand in his native Poland during World_War_II , Karol Wojtyla witnessed the Nazi persecution of Jews . It marked him . The candles , he told concentration_camp survivors at a preconcert meeting Thursday , &quot; keep before us the long history of anti-Semitism , which culminated in the Shoah . But it is not enough that we remember , for in our day , regrettably , there are many new manifestations of the anti-Semitism , xenophobia and racial hatred which were the seeds of those unspeakable crimes . Humanity cannot permit all that to happen again. &quot; It was the first time that the Vatican officially commemorated the Holocaust . The carefully measured performance of London ' s Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Gilbert Levine , an American Jew , came_in the context of perhaps the best relations in history between Catholics and Jews . &quot; This is a marvelous event in Catholic-Jewish relations , but also as a fact of history , that the Vatican commemorates the Holocaust . We need facts of history to tell future generations about these events and that they were not a figment of anybody ' s imagination , &quot; said Levine in an interview before the performance . In 1979 , a year after his election , John Paul prayed at the infamous Auschwitz death camp in Poland . In 1986 , he became the first Pope to visit the synagogue in Rome , where a Jewish community has lived since before the birth of Christ . Last December , he personally oversaw final negotiations to inaugurate diplomatic relations between the Holy_See and the state of Israel . &quot; This is fitting continuation of what I call one of the greatest success stories of the 20th Century -- the building of Catholic-Jewish relations . What an extraordinary journey to reach this point . There was never a commemoration like this , &quot; said Rabbi A . James Rudin , inter-religious affairs director of the American Jewish Committee who helped plan the concert . Each of the six candles was lit by a Holocaust survivor , one of them by Levine ' s mother-in-law , Margit Raab Kalina , originally of Czechoslovakia and now of New York . She survived Auschwitz . Referring to the survivors in remarks after the concert , John Paul said : &quot; Their presence strengthens our common commitment . The evocative melodies which we have listened to echo the anguished plea to the Lord , the expression of hope in him who hearkens to those who seek him , to welcome and console them . I wish to invite all_of you to observe a moment of silence , in_order to praise the Lord with words which he will suggest to our hearts , and to hear once more the plea , ' Do not forget us. ' &quot; There has never been a papal critic of anti-Semitism and racism as outspoken as John Paul . &quot; The Pope saw the Holocaust , not from any high official level , but on the ground in Poland . It was etched into him , &quot; Rudin said . In his early 20s , the future Pope worked first as a laborer in a stone quarry near Krakow , then as a boiler cleaner in a chemical plant during the Nazi torment of Jews . &quot; We have seen with our own eyes , we were there , and we were witnesses to the violence and the hatred which too often ignites in the world and rapidly inflames it . We have seen , and we see peace derided , brotherhood betrayed , harmony neglected and pity despised , &quot; John Paul told the concert audience . The program opened with cellist Lynn Harrell and the orchestra playing &quot; Kol Nidrei &quot; by composer Max Bruch , a work based on the central prayer of the service for Yom Kippur , the Jewish Day_of_Atonement . Then came the contemplative third movement of Ludwig van_Beethoven ' s Ninth Symphony . Baritone Howard Nevison and the Choir of St . Peter ' s Basilica followed with a version of the 92nd Psalm written by Franz Shubert , a Catholic , for the inauguration of the Vienna synagogue in 1826 . Actor Richard Dreyfuss , who will host transmission of the concert on U.S. public television later this year , narrated the Jewish prayer for the dead from Leonard Bernstein ' s Kaddish symphony . The performance climaxed with Bernstein ' s &quot; Chichester Psalms , &quot; also in Hebrew .</TEXT>
