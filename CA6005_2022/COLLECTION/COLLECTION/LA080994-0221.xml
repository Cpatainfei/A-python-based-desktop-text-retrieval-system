   <HEADLINE> SUPERSTARS OF DEEP ; WHALES IN SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL PUTTING_ON A SHOW UNMATCHED IN NATURE FOR PURE MAJESTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stephanie Le Chat looks_out_over the bow of the 88-foot Condor and can hardly believe her eyes . &quot; There is no beauty quite like that of the sea , &quot; she says . It has been quite a week for Le Chat , 29 . She came from Europe to be married in Las Vegas , traveled_to Arizona , where she met members of the Navajo tribe , and now finds herself surrounded by creatures both wild and wonderful . She , her husband , Patrick , and 50 others lining the rails of Capt . Fred Benko ' s boat have been watching Risso ' s dolphins shoot through the water like fluorescent torpedoes . They have been marveling at humpback_whales bold enough to swim alongside the boat , keeping pace with the slow-moving vessel and popping_up from time to time as if to sneak looks_at the watchers . But what have been giving them the biggest thrills are the blue_whales , which send plumes of mist high into the sky -- in one instance nearly blowing the feathers off a gull -- and bare their massive bodies . One whale seems to fly out of the water , crashing back_down and causing a splash that ' s sure to leave a lasting impression on everybody . &quot; What you ' re looking_at , folks , is the largest animal that has ever been_on the face of earth , &quot; says Benko , whose boat has made the 2 1 / 2-hour run from Sea Landing to Santa Rosa Island , where there have been the most whale sightings . &quot; Larger by far than any of the dinosaurs and much , much larger than anything on land today. &quot; Reaching lengths of 100 feet and weighing more_than 100 tons , yet possessing grace and power enough to travel great distances with very little effort , blue_whales have taken_up temporary lodging in the Santa Barbara Channel . They are there because they feed_on krill , tiny shrimp-like crustaceans that have concentrated in abundance in the nutrient-rich waters around the Channel Islands . But the abundance of blue_whales is unusual , especially considering that they are still trying to rebound from widespread hunting , which reduced the species from the hundreds of thousands in the early part of the century to near extinction . There are believed to be fewer than 10 # 000 -- perhaps as few as 5 # 000 -- left . &quot; In all_the oceans of the world , I ' ve never seen concentrations of blue_whales like this , &quot; says David O . Brown , 35 , a researcher who spent seven years studying whales with the Cousteau research team . &quot; That includes the Antarctic , that includes sub-Arctic , that includes Gulf of St . Lawrence ( off eastern Canada ) where there ' s supposed to be a big concentration . . . It ' s just amazing ! &quot; John Calambokidis , a research biologist with Cascadia Research , an Olympia , Wash. , organization that studies marine mammals and their movements , said population estimates put the number of blue_whales that feed along the California coast each summer and fall between 1 # 000 and 2 # 000 . But unlike gray_whales , which migrate fairly close to the coast from the Bering Sea to the lagoons of Baja California each winter and back each spring , blue_whales are less predictable in their migration habits and tend to remain farther offshore . &quot; There is a very special occurrence going_on out there , &quot; says Alisa Schulman-Janiger , a spokeswoman for the California chapter of the American Cetacean Society . &quot; A lot of people don ' t realize that gray_whales are_on a mission ( calving ) and only occasionally does one stop ( for whale-watchers ) . But here , these blue_whales are in their feeding grounds and you can literally watch them for hours. &quot; Benko is making the most of the phenomenon , canceling fishing trips and running daily whale-watching trips until the whales decide to leave , which could be today or two months from now . There was a similar occurrence in 1992 , the whales appearing in mid-summer and sticking_around until Sept . 15 . Benko and co-captain Ron Hart have studied whales and have the whales ' routine down_pat . With the exception of one day when the fog refused to lift , they have encountered blue and humpback_whales on every excursion for the last month . &quot; I really think they recognize the sound of the boat because as the season progresses , we tend to get better and better whale sightings , &quot; Benko says . &quot; And I think this is because these animals are acclimating to the Condor and realizing that we ' re not threatening. &quot; * Leaving Santa Barbara Harbor at 8 a.m. , Benko tells his passengers that the crossing to the islands will take more_than two hours , then begins dispensing information about the animals of the region . &quot; ( The Channel Islands ) have the greatest diversity of pinnipeds ( seals and walrus ) of any place in the northern_hemisphere , &quot; he says , piloting the vessel over the slow-rolling swells . &quot; We have huge elephant_seals , up_to 6 # 000 pounds , on the islands right now . We have California_sea_lions , harbor_seals , Guadalupe fur_seals , Northern fur_seals and Stellar sea_lions -- all come_into the channel at various times_of_year , particularly at San Miguel and Santa Rosa islands. &quot; Benko tells the passengers they might also see common_dolphins , Pacific white-sided dolphins , Dall ' s porpoise , Risso ' s dolphins , Northern right_whales and tiny minke_whales . As the fog slowly gives_way to sunshine , a California_sea_lion is floating on the surface in a posture known as rafting , sticking its fins out of the water and using them as solar_panels to absorb heat . Farther along in the channel , a blue_shark is cruising off the starboard bow , its fins barely visible above the surface . In the same area , a large elephant_seal sticks its head out of the water and watches the Condor glide_by . Hart tells of the time late last April , when a group on the boat encountered a pod of killer_whales moving swiftly across the surface . &quot; That same afternoon we got a call from ( the skipper of ) the Truth , &quot; Hart says . &quot; They saw the orcas ( as killer_whales are often called ) and went closer to look_at them and , as they were coming_into them , a gray_whale pops_up right off the front of the bow . The skipper backs_down hard to keep_from running_into this whale and then he sees that it ' s injured . It ' s right beside him and he leans over to look down at the gray_whale and this orca just came_up and munched it. &quot; Brown explains that killer_whales -- they are actually dolphins -- will attack whales or practically anything else they want . While diving off New Guinea in 1988 , he filmed killer_whales feeding_on a school of pelagic sharks . &quot; They ' d show_up with sharks sticking_out of the sides of their mouths , &quot; Brown says . &quot; They ' d let them go and the sharks would try to swim away and they ' d grab them again -- like they were playing with them . I saw one literally tear_up an 11-foot shark. &quot; The emergence of Risso ' s dolphins off the bow puts everyone ' s focus back on the present . The mammals , some 10 feet long , are leaping playfully and riding the wake of the Condor , giving most of the passengers a much-needed break from the monotony of boat travel . In the distance , the first spouts are seen , appearing as broad smoke signals against a hazy white sky . Benko and Hart identify the source as humpback_whales , saying blue_whale spouts are thinner and reach much higher . Within a_few minutes the Condor is in the thick of things . Benko , careful not to harass the whales , lets them come_to him . Whales half the size of the boat cruise beside it on either side . Jaws are dropping and cameras are clicking away . &quot; I love the whales , &quot; say Margo Adams , part of a large church group from Ventura . &quot; They ' re such gentle leviathans . Their grace is awesome. &quot; A California_sea_lion leaps over the head of one humpback each time it surfaces , as if to also be noticed . Benko remains with the humpbacks for an hour or so and then pulls_away , having seen the slender plumes of blue_whales above the white horizon . Those who haven ' t succumbed to the rocking of the boat -- Hart says about 7 % get seasick every trip -- take the time to reload their cameras and jockey for position at the bow and along the rails . Benko tells the passengers how impressive the whales they are about to see really are : -- The blue_whale ' s heart is as big as a small car and its tongue is as big as an African_elephant , weighing up_to six tons . &quot; Actually this animal is as large as_a_whole herd of elephants , &quot; Benko says . -- A blue_whale calf is 25 to 30 feet long at birth , can gain as much as 300 pounds a day and grow to 55 feet within six months . This is partly because the blue_whale ' s mother ' s milk is more_than 50 % fat , compared to the less than 10 % fat found in human milk . -- The air expelled from the blue_whale ' s blow hole is coming_out at about 300 m.p.h. And the holes , Benko says , &quot; are easily big enough for any one of us on the boat to slip down inside. &quot; Armed with this knowledge , the passengers finally get a first-hand look . Several blue_whales are spouting a_few hundred yards away . Others are feeding_on the krill on the surface . One whale breaches off the starboard bow , its sleek blue body in clear view . It breaches again , as if for an encore . Another surfaces about a dozen feet away and rolls_over on its side , showing_off a long , white pectoral_fin . Then , as if they have grown bored with the Condor and its shutterbugs , the whales move_on . Stephanie Le Chat , who still can ' t believe her eyes , watches them until they disappear . It is as she said . There is no beauty quite like that of the sea .</TEXT>
