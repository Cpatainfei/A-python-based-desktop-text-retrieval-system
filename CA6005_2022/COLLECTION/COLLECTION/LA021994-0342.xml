   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN MAKES A MOVE : FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE ? ; WHATEVER , THE WEST MUST SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Sarajevo artillery crisis is becoming the Cuban missile crisis of the 1990s . NATO has sworn that air strikes will follow if the Serb heavy artillery ringing the Bosnian capital is not removed by midnight Sunday and has backed_up its words with the largest military preparations seen anywhere since the Gulf War . Meanwhile , Russia ' s special envoy to Sarajevo has sworn that such air strikes will lead to &quot; all-out war , &quot; while back in Moscow President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s principal rival , Vladimir Zhirinovsky , has spoken_of &quot; World_War III. &quot; ENTER THE RUSSIANS : Uninvited , Russia has pledge 400 troops for Sarajevo . The United States has a leased naval base in Albania and 300 troops , not part of the NATO operation , in Macedonia . One Bosnian Serb military_leader has sworn that if air strikes occur , all foreigners will be taken hostage . U.N. officials have nervously welcomed the Russian move , which clearly caught them by surprise , and hopefully ( or fearfully ) reported Serb compliance with the ultimatum . But Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher sees only partial compliance , and Sarajevan Muslims fear a bluff . The Russians may indeed be bluffing , but a more hopeful reading of the radically ambivalent Russian move is that Yeltsin , unable to bluff NATO , has decided -- with a suddenness that might be unbelievable in anyone except this most mercurial of leaders -- to join NATO in a South Slav police_action . Like the Russians themselves , all_of the combatants in the Balkans War are Slavs , but religion binds the Russians to the Eastern Orthodox Serbs and divides them from the Roman_Catholic Croatians as well as from the religiously mixed but substantially Muslim Bosnians . In 19th and early 20th-Century Great Power struggles , Serbia sided with Russia , Croatia with Austro-Hungary , Bosnia with Turkey . Serbia remains a potent symbol for Yeltsin ' s hyper-nationalistic foes . Just possibly , Yeltsin has found a way to play the Serbian card his own way . If he can be seen at_home to have rescued the Serbs from NATO , then even if he has also checked the Serbs ' expansionistic adventure , he will have foiled Zhirinovsky . If he is willing to replicate the Sarajevo solution , placing a Russian cordon sanitaire around other besieged Bosnian towns , he will be hailed as a savior . Yeltsin may have realized how a Serbian victory could hurt him . The proposed partition of Bosnia would not just reward Serbian aggression , after all , but also inspire Russian neo-fascism . Zhirinovsky , Yeltsin ' s foe , is the Russian equivalent of Slobodan Milosevic , Serbia ' s neo-fascist president . Zhirinovsky wants to defend the ethnic Russians in Ukraine , Belarus and the Baltic_states by uniting them in a Greater Russia just as Milosevic has sought to unite the ethnic Serbs in Croatia , Slovenia and Bosnia . The trick , for Yeltsin , is to show that he can defend those ethnic Russians without being drawn into actions that would drag Russia down as surely as Milosevic ' s actions have dragged Serbia down . The defense of the Serbs may be just the needed demonstration . EXIT WITH PEACE ? : But the implications are broader still . If NATO and Russia can stand together as a tacit alliance against ethnic aggression anywhere between the Atlantic and the Urals , no European ethnic_group would benefit from this protection more_than the scattered Russians themselves . The wars that may be averted elsewhere as East and West together impose peace in the Balkans are wars that Russians might otherwise have to fight . The Bosnian Muslims , understandably , are ready to see nothing more in the arrival of Russian ground troops than the reinforcement of the Serbs now that the Serbs are_on the defensive . They may well be right , but this moment of rapidly growing peril is also one of unparalleled opportunity . Yeltsin and the NATO leaders , including President Clinton , must help one another to seize it .</TEXT>
