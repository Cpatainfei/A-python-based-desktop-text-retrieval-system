   <HEADLINE> MOLECULAR SHARKS ; THE DIZZYING MATTER OF WHERE A VIRUS FITS INTO THE GRAND SCHEME AND WHERE HUMANS FIT INTO NATURE ' S HUMBLING PLAN ; THE HOT ZONE , BY RICHARD PRESTON ( RANDOM HOUSE : $ 23 ; 352 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; The Hot Zone &quot; got_out of my backpack while I was off fishing . There were other choices in our motley array of tents -- Cormac McCarthy novels , Paul Bowles stories , &quot; The Magic Mountain &quot; and Ralph Cutter ' s &quot; Sierra Trout Guide. &quot; But it was my nondescript advance proof of &quot; The Hot Zone &quot; that inflamed Jim ' s interest , and for the rest of our five-day trip the book and its story spread . Under a full_moon , with kids whittling around a comforting fire , Jim recalled a scene in which researchers slice_through single cells with a diamond blade so sharp you would never feel its prick . The book jumped to Paul . Paul read feverishly , then described the hideous event known as &quot; bleeding out. &quot; &quot; The Hot Zone &quot; passed to a Bay Area friend . I didn ' t regain possession and start reading until we returned to civilization . Only then , after involuntarily blurting &quot; Oh no ! &quot; mid-sentence , did I fully comprehend the book ' s infectiousness . What we had_on that remote lake shore in the Sierra_Nevada , I now realize , was a &quot; microbreak. &quot; The story had erupted and , for the moment , been geographically contained . Trust me on this , though -- &quot; The Hot Zone &quot; is going_to sweep the population like fresh gossip in an office with E-mail . And the whole story is true . The passage that caused my uncharacteristic outburst comes a_few chapters into Richard Preston ' s tour_de_force . Major Nancy Jaax , a veterinarian in the U.S. Army ' s little-known Medical Research Institute of Infectious_Diseases , has just taped herself into a sealed Chemturion biological &quot; space suit &quot; and stepped through an airlock into a dangerous and obsessively controlled Level 4 biocontainment area known as &quot; the hot zone. &quot; Soon Jaax is ripping apart a diseased monkey ' s skull . Wrist-deep in blood and tissue , she thinks : &quot; No blood . I don ' t like blood . Every time I see a drop of blood , I see a_billion viruses. &quot; Jaax , is investigating a &quot; filovirus &quot; called Ebola , a &quot; Level 4 hot agent &quot; which , by definition , is lethal and contagious , and has no vaccine or cure . It is , we are told , &quot; a perfect parasite because it transforms virtually every part of the body into a digested slime of virus particles. &quot; In 1967 , a filovirus traveled to Germany in the blood of an African_Green_monkey . There it &quot; jumped species &quot; to a man who handled research primates , and started spreading so quickly , Preston says , that for a_few days &quot; doctors in the city thought the world was coming_to an end. &quot; In 1976 , a hot agent known as Ebola Zaire emerged like a phantom tiger from the jungle . It rampaged through 55 villages , slaughtering nine out of ten people it infected , before mysteriously petering out . Most such &quot; microbreaks &quot; have remained confined to Africa . But there is no doubting the virus ' ambition . In one scene , Preston describes a virus undergoing &quot; extreme amplification &quot; at a Nairobi hospital . As the afflicted patient dies , blood and bile spout from every orifice , letting the virus find new &quot; hosts &quot; in doctors and nurses . Earlier , the passengers of a crowded plane watched the same patient fill his airsickness bag to the brim with black_vomit , a substance that smells like a slaughterhouse and swarms with the wildly contagious_disease . In case anyone misses the point , Preston reminds us : &quot; A hot virus from the rain_forest lives within a twenty-four hour plane flight from every city on earth. &quot; Now that HIV -- a mere Level 2 agent -- has cut its tragic swath , it ' s hard to dismiss such observations as alarmist melodrama . And remember : &quot; Ebola does_in ten days what it takes AIDS ten years to accomplish. &quot; Given such startling facts , &quot; Hot Zone &quot; left me craving more biology . But it ' s clear why Preston pruned as he did . He uses the power of simple narrative to drive deep this story ' s urgent truths . Well-placed lyrical asides lodge Preston ' s biological mystery in parts of the mind that straight science often leaves untouched : troops of monkeys leap through the crowns of camphor_trees at night ; villagers sob outside huts in which their loved ones writhe and die ; mummified baby elephants litter a crevasse in a cave where the virus may hibernate in insect or mammal hosts . In the book ' s credits , Preston recalls feeding his editor the cliche : &quot; God is in the details. &quot; &quot; No , &quot; she replied . &quot; God is in the structure. &quot; Preston , as it happens , is a master of both . In a scene that illuminates Nancy Jaax ' s harried domestic life , the wife and mother slices the palm of her hand while hastily opening a can of beans with a butcher_knife . Preston reveals this detail -- along with the disturbing particulars of Ebola ' s aggression -- just before Jaax performs the monkey autopsy . How could I not blurt &quot; Oh no ! &quot; when Jaax spotted the hole in her blood-sopped &quot; space suit &quot; ? Throughout the book , horror lurks on the edge of banality . &quot; The Hot Zone ' s &quot; central crisis is a 1989 filovirus outbreak that decimated a population of several hundred research monkeys , at a corporate laboratory in suburban Virginia . Not knowing whether this strain of virus is deadly to human primates , suspecting that it may transmit through the air , Jaax joins a biocontainment assault . She enters the disease-ridden building to the squeals of children playing_at a nearby preschool . It is bad form to reveal a book ' s ending . I can say , though , that if you ' re alive to read this , events did not hand Preston his most dramatic climax . Don ' t be disappointed . Gripping as Preston ' s real-life plot may be , the questions &quot; The Hot Zone &quot; provokes are even more compelling . For instance : As new viral agents emerge , biological emergencies and individual liberties are bound to collide . ( Remember the furor that has surrounded &quot; fascist / lunatic &quot; suggestions to isolate people with AIDS ? How about murder_charges against knowingly HIV-infected who have unprotected sex ? ) Where will the lines be drawn and by whom ? &quot; The Hot Zone &quot; also inspires navel-gazing of a more fundamental sort . In his acclaimed book , &quot; First_Light , &quot; Preston put his talents to the study of the stars . &quot; The Hot Zone &quot; is strewn with astronomic metaphors . They ' re not gratuitous : microscopes as well as telescopes probe the cosmos . As Preston says in describing a hot zone researcher ' s scrutiny of a magnified cell : &quot; What loomed before his eyes was a huge , complicated vista , crowded with more detail than the mind could absorb . He might have been a navigator of a starship making a low-orbit pass_over a huge , unexplored planet . . . . The cell was a world down there , and somewhere in that jungle hid a virus. &quot; Viruses , Preston says , are &quot; molecular sharks , a motive without a mind . . . . They exist in the borderlands between life and nonlife. &quot; Yet it is barely possible to consider these things without discussing their &quot; strategy &quot; for attaining their apparent raison d ' etre -- which is to spread like an imperialist army . &quot; The more one contemplates the hot viruses , &quot; Preston says , &quot; the less they look_like parasites , and the more they begin to look_like predators. &quot; Karl Johnson , the &quot; discoverer &quot; of the Ebola virus , remains in abject fear of the potential devastation it or some_other hot agent could inflict on our species . Yet , Johnson tells the author , &quot; I ' m so glad nature is not benign . . . . &quot; &quot; Do you find the virus beautiful ? &quot; the author asks , as Johnson casts an imitation fly_on the trout-rich waters of Montana ' s Bighorn_river . &quot; Oh yeah , &quot; Johnson says softly , one predator in_awe_of another . The dizzying matter of just where a virus fits into God ' s grand scheme , or where we humans fit into nature ' s more humbling plan , runs_through the &quot; The Hot Zone &quot; like the echo of a Zen koan . So it is really annoying when , in the book ' s final section , Preston steps_out of his poet-journalist role and leaps with preacherly zeal onto a stump . The earth , he declares , is &quot; beginning to react to the human parasite , the flooding infection of people , the dead spots of concrete all_over the planet , the cancerous rot outs_in Europe . . . . &quot; That we humans have been slothful environmental stewards seems beyond debate . Perhaps , as the Gaia theorists would have it , the earth is a throbbing organism that ' s not gonna take our guff anymore . On the other hand , it ' s equally plausible that our species has burgeoned exactly in_order to survive the predations of AIDS , Ebola et . al . -- Hey ! All the other parasites do_it ! In any case , such trite speculation is only a momentary distraction from the subtler ruminations Preston ' s fine story-telling stirs .
