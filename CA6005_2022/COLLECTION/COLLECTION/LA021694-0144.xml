   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE / LIFELINES OF L.A. ; THE QUESTIONS ; SHAKY BRIDGES , SHAKEN THEORIES ; WHEN THE VIOLENT SHAKING STARTED , JOHN FAUST WAS ALREADY ON THE FREEWAY , DRIVING METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY BUS NO . 3466 THROUGH THE CRISP MORNING DARKNESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Powerless to prevent his 14-ton vehicle from jerking half a lane to the right , Faust braked to a heart-pounding stop . Then he swung the 40-foot bus sideways -- blocking oncoming drivers from what only he and a handful of others could see : A gaping chasm in the eight-lane Simi Valley Freeway , where it once crossed San Fernando Mission Boulevard . &quot; It was like looking down into a pit , a void , &quot; said Faust , whose bus was not carrying passengers . &quot; My thought was : ' Am I going_to get_out of here safely ? ' &quot; He and the others did make_it out , aided by providence of the Northridge earthquake ' s 4:31 arrival . Had the temblor hit two hours later , this and the region ' s other freeways would have been loaded with traffic . But the failure on the Simi Valley Freeway is larger than just the loss of one important traffic artery . Of the six major roadway collapses caused by the Jan . 17 earthquake -- of the 157 other overpasses damaged -- the Simi bridge ' s failure remains perhaps the most unnerving : It defied some of the most modern engineering assumptions used to safeguard California ' s freeways from earthquakes . &quot; ( The bridge ) contains a lot of the details that we like to see in designs -- and yet it still performed poorly , &quot; said UC San Diego ' s M.J. Nigel Priestly , the research leader for the state ' s program to fortify freeways . California Department_of_Transportation officials decided earlier this decade that the structure was not at risk . Overruling two junior engineers , they removed the bridge from the list of structures scheduled to be &quot; retrofitted &quot; with jackets of steel reinforcements , records show . Now the collapse has called into question the standards Caltrans has used to determine which bridges get retrofitted and when . As a consequence , the safety of hundreds of similar bridges excluded from the list is being re-evaluated . &quot; The good news from this earthquake is that retrofitting worked , &quot; Priestly said , noting that not a single retrofitted bridge suffered serious damage . But the performance of the Simi Freeway and the collapse of other roadways , which caused about $ 1.5 billion in damage and left a motorcycle patrolman dead , shook confidence in the safety of the nation ' s most intricate network of freeways . It also raises this question : Four years and four months after another earthquake crushed to death 43 motorists on two San Francisco-area freeways , with what urgency have California ' s engineers and political_leaders sought to strengthen hundreds of other bridges identified as being seismically unsafe ? A Times examination found that the pace of a state program to retrofit freeway bridges and overpasses has been slowed in part by cost concerns , competing transit projects , Caltrans ' cumbersome bureaucracy and a public employee union ' s lawsuit . Records and interviews also show : * About 80 % of the state ' s 1 # 313 bridges identified as being vulnerable to earthquakes have not been repaired . * In Los Angeles County , 84 % of 716 bridges designated for retrofitting remain unrepaired . * Only four of the 10 most vulnerable overpasses in the county have been fixed -- and the unrepaired spans are at some of the busiest freeway junctures . * Caltrans has spent less than a third of the $ 300 million per year that officials estimated would be used for shoring_up unsafe bridges . * A small share of the billions of dollars from a new gasoline_tax has been spent on bridge repairs , although voters were told that seismic retrofitting would be a major beneficiary of the new revenue . * And , just three days before the Northridge quake , the director of Caltrans halted the hiring of outside engineering consultants who have performed nearly half the design work for the bridge retrofitting program . Caltrans officials say they have moved as swiftly as possible , considering the complexities of the work . Although more retrofitting needs to be done , they said the state ' s bridges are generally sound . &quot; I think they ' re very safe , but we have some work to do , to get a_few bridges up_to the standard of the rest of them , &quot; said James W . van Loben Sels , who was appointed to head Caltrans by Gov . Pete Wilson . &quot; We ' re going to do_it as rapidly as we can. &quot; Chief Caltrans bridge engineer James E . Roberts said the retrofitting program has moved cautiously to ensure that the costly repair procedures would work in the real_world , not only in a laboratory . Roberts said he wants the same emergency powers for retrofitting that the governor has given the agency to rebuild the damaged freeways . However , Van Loben Sels said he does not believe emergency powers are needed . The decision Jan . 14 to halt outside contracting for design engineering work will not slow the retrofitting program , according to Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago . He said the decision was made_for cost reasons and that the department ' s in-house staff of engineers can shoulder the extra workload . &quot; This is our highest priority and other projects may feel delays because of that , &quot; Drago said . Two years ago , Caltrans completed an analysis of the state ' s 12 # 000 bridges , concluding that 4 # 000 posed varying seismic hazards . Since then , the retrofitting list has been whittled_down to 1 # 313 . Caltrans officials take 17 factors into account when ranking bridges , including the proximity of earthquake faults , traffic volume and age . Structures built before 1950 or after 1980 are considered the most sound . Work has not been completed on some of the most unsafe bridges , officials said , because many are supported by clusters of columns -- and a higher priority has been given to fixing single-column bridges . Caltrans had assumed that the single pillars were the most vulnerable . But the Northridge quake crumpled both types of columns . &quot; The multicolumn ( bridges ) have to be a higher priority than they were before , &quot; said Ronald Mayes , a consultant to the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research in Buffalo , N.Y. &quot; Some of them are very vulnerable. &quot; A Race Against Time To appreciate how far California has come , or not come , in building bridges to survive quakes , it is helpful to recall how fortunate the state has been until recent years . &quot; Before 1971 , California only lost $ 100 # 000 -- total , in history -- to bridge damage from earthquakes , &quot; said Brian Maroney , senior bridge engineer for Caltrans ' Office of Earthquake Engineering . That year the 6.4 Sylmar earthquake toppled parts of two interchanges , killing two men in a pickup_truck . They died less than two miles from where LAPD Officer Clarence Wayne Dean would plunge to his death from a freeway bridge on Jan . 17 , 1994 . After Sylmar , Caltrans set_about rebuilding the interchanges and fixing 58 damaged overpasses . As a precaution , they outfitted about 1 # 200 overpasses with cable restrainers to keep segments of roadway from separating and collapsing . Knowing that scores of bridges passed the test of the Sylmar quake , Caltrans officials may have been &quot; lulled into a false sense of security , &quot; said James H . Gates , head of structural mechanics engineering for Caltrans . Over the next 16 years , the significant quakes that struck the state were either in rural regions or did not inflict damage to major roadways . It was not until October , 1987 -- when the 5.9 Whittier quake stunned engineers by nearly toppling the two-level interchange of the Santa Ana and San Gabriel River freeways -- that an intensive research effort was launched . Caltrans engineers began seeking to identify vulnerable bridges and studying what repairs could be made , short of tearing_down and rebuilding thousands of structures . Then came Oct . 17 , 1989 . The World_Series game in San Francisco that wasn ' t . The grisly footage of the collapsed , double-deck Nimitz Freeway that killed 42 people -- an inadequate design made lethal by the Loma Prieta earthquake . &quot; Most of California ' s reinforced concrete bridges were designed and built before the 1970s and their seismic performance is suspect , &quot; warned a governor ' s Board of Inquiry into the Loma Prieta quake . But has government ' s response come_close to matching the dangers highlighted by the Board of Inquiry ' s May , 1990 , report , &quot; Competing Against Time &quot; ? &quot; There is pretty strong evidence that this retrofitting program is working , &quot; said Jack P . Moehle , a UC Berkeley professor and director of the nearby Earthquake Engineering Research Institute . &quot; Unfortunately , nature has just moved a little more rapidly than Caltrans. &quot; Richard Katz , a San Fernando Valley legislator who chairs the Assembly Transportation Committee , said : &quot; Caltrans has an inherent problem , internally , of ( not ) being able to do anything quickly. &quot; Indeed , Caltrans ' pace of retrofitting has not matched either the department ' s estimates or the promises made to voters by an array of leaders . In 1990 , the bipartisan promoters of a sweeping transportation ballot initiative , Proposition 111 , told voters that if they would agree to double the state gasoline_tax , the earthquake-retrofitting program would be a major beneficiary . The tax has doubled -- from 9 cents a gallon in 1990 to 18 cents a gallon today -- raising about $ 1.4 billion more a year for overall transportation projects . But records show that from mid-1989 to July of this year , Caltrans will have spent $ 432 million to retrofit 251 bridges -- amounting to an average of 3 % of the agency ' s overall annual budgets . The spending for retrofitting is less than a third of the $ 300 million a year that then-Caltrans Director Robert K . Best told the Legislature in 1991 he hoped to spend . Jack McDowell , a consultant who managed the Proposition 111 campaign , said , &quot; If somebody broke their promise ( afterward ) , we had no inkling during the campaign. &quot; Asked why the department has spent only $ 86.5 million a year on retrofitting , Caltrans ' Roberts said the repair procedures had to be adequately researched and soil conditions sometimes required years-long analyses . Building can also be difficult , he added , because some jobs require lane closures , night work and approvals from other agencies . Litigation also has delayed some work . Eight private engineers said in interviews they were ordered by Caltrans to stop retrofit designing because of a lawsuit brought by the union for the department ' s engineers . The stoppage for several months last year came_after a judge ' s ruling in favor of the union , which has sought to block the hiring of outside engineers . A bigger bottleneck , according to a former Caltrans official , is the agency ' s contracting procedures . It has taken as long as a year to get approval to retain outside engineers . &quot; We had to go_through the same process as purchasing toilet_paper for state toilets , &quot; said Herbert K . Jensen , who until late 1992 administered the contracting . Before last month ' s quake , the department had planned to spend $ 1.1 billion more to repair about 1 # 000 bridges that remained on the state ' s retrofitting list . If , as expected , dozens more bridges are identified for retrofitting in the coming weeks , Caltrans spokesman Drago said these projects would also &quot; get first crack &quot; at Caltrans ' pool of money . At least $ 615 million more will be needed for seven of the nine toll bridges maintained by Caltrans and additional funds will be necessary for the 13 # 000 overpasses and toll bridges controlled by local_governments . During the last four years , the administrations of two governors and state legislators of both parties have said with voices and votes that retrofitting should receive top priority . In practice , state Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) said , it has not worked_out that way . &quot; There are always developers and politicians lobbying for a new off-ramp , or some_other project , &quot; Hayden said . &quot; ( Caltrans ) can ' t move forward faster with retrofitting without cutting_into those projects. &quot; Dean R . Dunphy , Gov . Pete Wilson ' s secretary of business , transportation and housing , acknowledged the intense competition for Caltrans funding . &quot; Retrofitting has been a priority from the beginning , &quot; Dunphy said . &quot; But not the only priority. &quot; Bruce Nestande , a past chairman of the California Transportation Commission , said safety also has been at stake when Caltrans spent money for items unrelated to retrofitting , such_as widening freeway on-ramps . &quot; A decision was made not to shut everything else down for the motoring public , &quot; he said . Assumptions Crumble One of the most encouraging lessons that engineers say they have learned from the Northridge earthquake is that retrofitting works : Field investigators have confirmed that the 115 retrofitted overpasses in Los Angeles County were unscathed or had minor damage . None had to be closed . But interviews and records show that at least four of the quake ' s six major bridge collapses challenge the engineering assumptions and policy decisions dictating whether or when bridges get fixed : * Simi Valley Freeway overpass , at San Fernando Mission Boulevard / Gothic Street : When Caltrans re-evaluated the list of bridges planned for retrofitting three years ago , engineers overruled recommendations of two subordinates and decided that the Simi Valley structure was safe . The bridge was removed from the list . Now , the decision is open_to doubt . Subjected_to 12 seconds of some of the most intense ground shaking inflicted on any structure during the Northridge quake , the 566-foot-long bridge failed . Engineers said the 10 concrete support_columns turned_out to be too stiff . Roberts of Caltrans defended the decision to remove the bridge from the retrofit list , saying it was based on the best information available at that time . &quot; I think that was a good judgment , personally , &quot; he said . The bridge was removed from the list in part because it was designed in 1973 , with the benefit of lessons learned from the 1971 Sylmar earthquake , officials said . Engineers who have studied the collapse have found a clue that may help prevent others . They believe that the failure of the steel-reinforced , concrete columns was hastened by what was once an award-winning architectural feature : The tops of each of the columns had a gradual Y-shape , called a flare . These flares , according to the engineers , decreased the flexibility of the columns . Designers had assumed that the top edges of the flares would merely crack and crumble during a strong earthquake -- without doing harm to the overall integrity of the column . Instead , the Simi Valley Freeway overpass flares remained intact , placing more strain on the columns . &quot; They were conceived to be primarily aesthetic , &quot; said Priestly of UC San Diego . &quot; In the early days , they would say ( that anything which ) increases the strength of the structure can only be good. &quot; But Priestly said the lesson of the collapse is that the influence of the flares &quot; can be very bad. &quot; Caltrans officials said they now are re-evaluating the hundreds of bridge columns elsewhere that also were built with flares . Structural engineering professor Frieder Seible of UC San Diego said some flared columns are safe , while others can be made safe with jackets of extra steel reinforcing . Some of the biggest flared columns in California are being used on expansion of the Harbor Freeway near Downtown . Caltrans engineers said the columns survived the quake with no damage . But Caltrans has decided to exclude flares when rebuilding the collapsed interchange of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways . &quot; There ' s something going_on here , &quot; said Maroney , the Caltrans bridge engineer . &quot; We need to evaluate it. &quot; Engineers also are studying other aspects of the bridge ' s design , including the angle of the columns . * Golden State-Antelope Valley freeway interchange : This site 21 miles north of Downtown had partially collapsed during the Sylmar quake while under construction . It is vital to commuters from the Antelope Valley . Among them on the morning of Jan . 17 was motorcycle officer Dean , who plunged to his death from the collapsed ramp linking the westbound Antelope Valley Freeway to the southbound lanes of the Golden State Freeway . The connecting ramp from the Antelope Valley to the northbound Golden State also fell . Engineers believe the culprits were columns that proved too stiff , along with expansion joints that were too narrow . Again , retrofitting probably would have saved both elevated ramps , officials said . After the 1971 quake , Caltrans installed devices to strengthen the bridge_decks at the interchange . But records show that of all_the single-column bridges identified statewide for retrofitting , this interchange was the only one where repairs were not under way . Records show that retrofitting design work began in 1992 . But two obstacles emerged : The range of hard and soft soils at the interchange required extensive analysis . And Caltrans had to decide whether it would be more cost effective to erect a new structure that would be_better suited to the soil conditions than to spend $ 11.7 million for retrofitting . &quot; It would be imprudent to retrofit if you are going_to rebuild everything else in there , &quot; said Roberts of Caltrans . &quot; And I think they were in the process of coming_to that conclusion. &quot; Roberts acknowledged that the site was not ideal for a major interchange . &quot; If you had all_of the knowledge of foundation conditions then that you have today , you would try and get_out of there , &quot; he said . Rebuilding the interchange will cost an estimated $ 34 million . * Golden State Freeway at Gavin Canyon bridge : Located 23 miles north of Downtown , this 80-foot-high bridge had been placed low on the list of structures to be retrofitted with steel jackets . Top Caltrans engineers cite two reasons for their belief that this bridge was relatively safe : The structure had survived the powerful 1971 Sylmar earthquake , centered nearby , with virtually no damage . And in 1974 , it was outfitted with cable restrainers to keep the bridge_decks together at their expansion joints . Generally , said Gates of Caltrans , &quot; bridges that were successful in 1971 got a good grade &quot; for seismic safety and were placed lower on the retrofitting list . Roberts had a hand in designing the Gavin Canyon bridge , which was built_in 1967 , and he inspected it and found it sound after the ' 71 Sylmar quake . Caltrans officials and other experts said this and all other collapsed bridges would have survived if retrofitted . But records show that Gavin Canyon was so low on the retrofitting list that no design work had begun . It would have cost an estimated $ 2.2 million to retrofit -- and it now will cost $ 14.8 million to rebuild . One reason the cluster-column bridge had not been fitted with steel jackets , Roberts said , was that Caltrans had decided that spans supported by single columns were more at risk . The clustered columns were considered more complex and more expensive to retrofit . Seible of UC San Diego said Caltrans engineers acted prudently in 1974 when they placed the cable restrainers in the Gavin Canyon bridge . But the structure failed largely because the support_columns were too brittle and the bridge ' s expansion joints still had less than twice the capacity demanded by the Northridge quake , he said . &quot; Clearly ( retrofitting ) was not adequate , &quot; Seible said . &quot; Otherwise the structure would not have collapsed. &quot; * Santa Monica Freeway overpasses at Fairfax Avenue and La Cienega Boulevard : Engineers are confident that if the Northridge earthquake had struck just a_few months later , this part of the nation ' s most heavily traveled freeway would not now be a demolition site . Retrofitting of the clustered columns for the two overpasses was to begin this month . Those columns , like so many others , failed . Engineers have found that the clustered columns were too brittle -- but would have performed adequately if retrofitted . The proof is that just a_few hundred yards away , a freeway overpass at Cadillac Avenue suffered no visible damage , they said . Those columns had been outfitted with full-length steel jackets . The failures along the Santa Monica Freeway point_out the vulnerability of columns constructed without enough horizontal steel reinforcing bars . For most of the state ' s bridges in need of retrofitting , engineers said that 8 to 10 times more horizontal reinforcing steel is needed . These spiral-like hoops of steel provide strength and flexibility to columns . By retrofitting the columns with steel jackets , engineers can compensate for the inadequate construction . Otherwise , said Caltrans ' Maroney , &quot; it ' s like the difference between what happens if you pour a glass of water onto a table , or into a glass . Without the horizontal steel to contain it , the concrete just explodes outward. &quot; Retrofitting of the two Santa Monica Freeway overpasses would have cost a total of $ 4 million , records show . The estimated cost to rebuild the Santa Monica Freeway : $ 15 million to $ 21 million . The two Santa Monica Freeway collapses were precisely the kind of failures that engineers feared when they examined the damage to the Santa Ana-San Gabriel River freeway interchange , which barely withstood the 5.9 Whittier earthquake of October , 1987 . &quot; These two failures are almost identical to what happened to the 605 / 5 interchange , &quot; said John F . Hall , a Caltech engineering professor who is studying the Northridge quake for the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute . Why , seven years after the Whittier wake-up call , were these two overpasses not retrofitted ? The overpasses were supported with clustered columns , so they had a lower priority . The design work for the retrofitting started 2 1 / 2 years ago and construction was to begin this month . Hayden said the failure to quickly retrofit bridges on the nation ' s busiest freeway points_out the fallibility of Caltrans ' priorities . &quot; They have the money , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s a question of what they spend it for. &quot; Setting priorities for repairs remains the challenge for the engineers and politicians entrusted with making bridges and overpasses as safe as possible . But as the Sylmar , Whittier , Loma Prieta and Northridge earthquakes have shown , even the best-informed engineering assumptions can tumble like so many guesses . As for bus_driver Faust , he has won a commendation for his efforts the morning of Jan . 17 . He is hoping that the earthquake professionals get_it right before the next one . But when he makes his afternoon run these days and comes_upon one overpass , &quot; I ' m looking_up for cracks -- and keeping my foot to the floor. &quot;</TEXT>
