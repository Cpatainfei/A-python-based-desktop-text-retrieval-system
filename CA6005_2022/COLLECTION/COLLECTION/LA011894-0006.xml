   <HEADLINE> ' ENSLAVEMENT ' OF THE MIDDLE_CLASS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Alexander Cockburn ( Column Left , Jan . 6 ) is misled by his attraction to the wrong historical analogy . Imperial China is a better model for understanding what ' s wrong with contemporary America than medieval Europe is . We are not so_much divided economically into lords and peasants as we are divided socially into power classes : coolies , landlords , mandarins and the imperial court . But for most of us , the real problem isn ' t the landlords , it ' s the mandarins . Planners , regulators , facilitators , coordinators , staff aides , commentators , experts , and every_other imaginable category of trained , professional , certified public intellectuals and recognized authorities govern all modern &quot; democracies &quot; -- and they govern with an iron hand , under absolute and plenary dispensation from the awesome and distant Court of Heaven . The Euro-American left will continue to be a marginalized and ridiculous political force unless it can somehow learn to see around its Marxist spectacles , abandon its false analogies , and rededicate itself to the ancient Western ideals of personal liberty and social concord . J . L . JONSSON Long_Beach * Cockburn describes the sharply lowered earning power of the middle_class over the last 30 years , and then presents a class-warfare explanation . He ignores another possibility : We have too many people . In the period Cockburn is describing , America ' s population and the world ' s nearly doubled . With a finite amount of land providing food and space for an increasing number of people , competition for resources increases , causing prices to rise and living standards for many to fall . It is time for governments and churches the world over to encourage parents to have no more_than two children . The tax and welfare systems , which both reward childbearing , should be changed . Note that a one- or-two-child policy , followed for one or two generations , will result in a population drop . If we don ' t encourage birth_control now , we will need to require it within 50 years . HERBERT G . ROSENBLOOM Sepulveda * I ' m unclear on why the development of things like computers , a result of &quot; corporate planning , &quot; and something used to investigate the riddles of cancer and unlock the secrets of the universe are &quot; utter failures , &quot; and have provided &quot; virtually nothing of worth. &quot; How was the computer on which Cockburn writes invented and marketed if not through &quot; corporate planning &quot; ? DAVE CAVENA Pasadena * The ideas put forth in Cockburn ' s commentary are all but completely absent from the American mainstream press . Why should this be so ? The people of this country deserve media which provide a balanced forum for all thoughts and ideas , even if they shake the foundation upon which our modern society is built . It is becoming increasingly evident that the status_quo is not working and that serious questions about where we are and how we got here need to be asked , no matter what &quot; sacred_cows &quot; are slaughtered in the process .
