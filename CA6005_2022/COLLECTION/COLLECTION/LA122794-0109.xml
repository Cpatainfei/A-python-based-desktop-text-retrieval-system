   <HEADLINE> FIRM MAKES IMPRESSION IN RAPID PROTOTYPING ; VALENCIA : 3D SYSTEMS LEADS THE INDUSTRY THAT PROVIDES MACHINES FOR MAKING PLASTIC MODELS FROM COMPUTER DESIGNS IN HOURS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1992 , Logitech Inc. , a computer_peripherals maker , had a chance to win a big contract from IBM . The computer giant needed to produce a two-button computer mouse in a hurry . IBM gave Logitech a two-week deadline to come_up with a working model and a price to mass produce the part . So Logitech turned_to an unusual model-making machine it had purchased from 3D Systems Corp . in Valencia . The 3D technology can convert a computer design into a real plastic model in hours instead of the weeks associated with traditional modeling materials , such_as wood , clay and metal . When Logitech executives met with IBM a week later , they were able to show IBM a working model , and Logitech won the business on the spot . &quot; It blew our competition out of the water , &quot; said Rick Lutzinger , Logitech ' s director of mechanical_engineering . This kind of quick turnaround is why 3D Systems has sold more_than 450 of these machines , known in the trade as rapid prototyping systems , to some of the country ' s largest companies , including GM , Chrysler and Ford , in addition to aerospace companies , toy makers and producers of consumer goods , such_as Tupperware . Of the estimated 891 rapid prototyping systems at_work in manufacturing facilities worldwide , 3D is the industry leader , according to Wohlers Associates of Ft . Collins , Colo. , an industry research company . 3D also does in-house design work for customers , besides selling the modeling machines . And 3D ' s broadening reputation has finally meant profitable times for the 8-year-old company . The company posted a $ 2.1-million profit for the nine months ended Sept . 30 , compared to a $ 920 # 469 loss a year earlier . Meanwhile its sales jumped 38 % to $ 31.1 million in the latest nine months . This is a sharp turnaround for 3D , which despite its interesting technology , for a long_time had difficulty building a profitable business . The company lost nearly $ 10 million in 1991 . Management changes followed , including the hiring three years ago of chief_executive Arthur B . Sims , a high_technology industry veteran , who led the company through layoffs and installed marketing changes . Sims set_out to broaden the company ' s revenues by relying not just on selling the pricey modeling machines , which can cost from $ 100 # 000 to $ 500 # 000 . Now 3D sells service_contracts to maintain the machines for buyers , and it also has a staff in-house that is hired to build models for customers that don ' t want to buy 3D ' s sophisticated machines , but still want to use the technology . Today only half of the company ' s revenues are dependent_on the sales of new machines . The company has reported five consecutive quarterly profits , and Sims hopes 3D Systems is at the start of a new period of prosperity , while finding new applications for its technology . Next year it ' s also entering a new , and potentially large , market with the introduction of a lower-priced , desktop modeling machine . Analysts like the changes at 3D . &quot; The new management has done a good job at leading the company into controlled , consistent growth , &quot; said Antoine Tristani , technology analyst with Southcoast Capital in Austin , Tex . &quot; The challenge we face is much the same kind of challenge the early computer companies faced , &quot; said 3D ' s Sims . &quot; We ' ve got_to figure_out where our greatest potential lies. &quot; Indeed , 3D , which once had the rapid prototyping field to itself , will soon contend with 20 rivals . &quot; All the companies that have jumped in want a piece of 3D ' s pie , &quot; said Rolf Hubert , vice_president of marketing at Sanders Prototype Inc. of Wilton , N.H. , a new 3D rival . * 3D also faces the task of convincing conservative manufacturers -- as distinct from its first wave of customers -- that its high-priced technology is worth the investment . So far , 3D has sold the bulk of its high-end machines to an elite tier of companies that pride themselves on being at the technological forefront . 3D ' s machines work like this : An engineer using computer-aided-design software designs , say , a car part . That design is then fed into a 3D machine , which contains a laser above a vat of liquid plastic . A computer guides the laser to draw_a_line on the surface of the resins to create a cross-section of the part . That first section immediately becomes solid . The machine then drops a fraction of an inch and creates another cross-section in the liquid above it . This process is repeated until , a_few hours later , a three-dimensional model is completed ( hence , the company ' s name ) . 3D ' s founder Charles Hull , who remains company president , developed this modeling method in 1986 . Manufacturers use these prototypes to see how a product will look , and to test and spot flaws before committing huge sums to tool up manufacturing_plants to build the actual parts . Another key appeal is to shorten the time it takes_to get new products to market . Since 1988 , Ciba-Geigy Ltd. , the giant Swiss chemical conglomerate , has owned 36 % of 3D ' s stock . Ciba develops materials for 3D ' s technology under an agreement that expires in July . The companies are discussing the terms of an extension of that agreement . If analysts are correct , rapid prototyping is also a business that will grow rapidly . Wohlers Associates estimated sales of rapid prototyping equipment and supplies at $ 100 million worldwide in 1993 , and expects that by 2006 , the industry will hit $ 1.2 billion in annual sales . In order to grow , however , 3D must find new markets . Since 1993 , 3D has been offering a new application for its machines that can create models for metal parts . 3D ' s vice_president of strategy and market development , Richard Fedchenko , believes &quot; QuickCast , &quot; as this new system is called , will eventually be larger than 3D ' s traditional plastic parts business . The company also hopes to sell its products to the medical industry . Several research hospitals and medical companies are now using 3D ' s technology to make models for prosthetics , and prototypes of human bones and organs that can help surgeons plan operations . Doctors within hours can examine an exact model of a specific patient ' s fractured body_part before starting an operation . That dramatically shortens the operation , and will probably help the patient recover more quickly . &quot; Medicine is a real wild card , &quot; said Sims . &quot; I would be really surprised if it doesn ' t grow even faster than the manufacturing applications. &quot; 3D executives are also preparing_for the 1995 introduction of a smaller prototyping machine suitable for engineering use on desktops . The price will be around $ 50 # 000 . So far , 3D hasn ' t revealed the details of this desktop model , prompting much industry speculation . Some question whether the liquid resins and industrial chemicals that 3D uses in its top end models , which shouldn ' t be touched directly , will work in an office setting . But many in the business see the marketing promise of a lower-priced modeling machine . &quot; All of us recognize the desktop market has a lot of potential , &quot; said Jennifer Maher , marketing manager with Helisys of Torrance , a 3D competitor . &quot; But in_order to be successful , you ' ve got_to get high volume. &quot; Industry watchers say 3D ' s image suffered in its early years because company officials often oversold the technology ' s benefits . Manufacturers were initially dazzled , but became disillusioned when many couldn ' t figure_out how to make the modeling machines improve the manufacturing process , said Geoffrey Smith-Moritz , editor of the Rapid Prototyping Report , an industry newsletter in San Diego . &quot; Companies that bought them ended_up making paperweights , &quot; he recalled . Today , 3D ' s executives say they must be careful not to over-promote the technology , especially with new customers . &quot; In the end it comes_back to performance , not the promises you make , &quot; said Fedchenko .</TEXT>
