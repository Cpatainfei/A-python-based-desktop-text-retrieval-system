   <HEADLINE> THE STRAIGHT SHOOTER ; RETIRING NRA CHIEF BOB CORBIN LED AS HE LIVES : NO COMPROMISES AND NEVER SURRENDER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Few know the man or even the name . Yet he is vilified for the lobby he leads . He is at_odds with President Clinton , Mother Teresa , Los Angeles Police_Chief Willie L . Williams , other top cops and liberals who consider him a fusty gunslinger . In his real , gentler life here , Bob Corbin is a 65-year-old father of three daughters ; a crew-cut , 130-pound Hoosier who drinks Hamm ' s and likes country cafes that serve biscuits and gravy for breakfast . He dotes on two grandchildren , wife Helen , heating baked beans in the can to save on dishes , gunky pipes and prowling for lost gold mines in Arizona ' s clean mountains . Corbin does not like career criminals , a Congress in a mood to prohibit assault weapons , Washington Post editorials , the views of Sarah Brady -- and being photographed with a rifle . He says it would not be appropriate . Not for the president of the National Rifle Assn . &quot; Burglars read newspapers , &quot; he says . To date , no burglar has hit Corbin ' s home cache of hunting rifles , pistols and a fully automatic but fully legal MP5 submachine_gun . &quot; My second concern is the minute people who don ' t like guns see someone holding one , they are opposed to you . I want people to listen to what I have to say and then make_up their own mind . After that , I don ' t care. &quot; Except to care about those who might presume that Corbin plus an assault_rifle equals John Rambo . As NRA ' s top gun notes : &quot; The perception today is that guns are evil and people who own guns are evil . I have been in law_enforcement all my professional career and I don ' t think I ' m evil. &quot; Gun_control advocates , however , disagree . They are awaiting Sunday and the NRA ' s annual meeting in Minneapolis when Corbin ends his leadership of a 123-year-old gun club considered by some to be a greater threat to public health than the Tobacco Institute . Corbin has been a devoted president . Yet on his two-year watch , politicians have defied the all-mighty NRA and its megabuck phone banks , the Brady bill became law and firearm debates rage hotter than a $ 2 pistol . Could it be , ask gun controllers , that the NRA is thinking compromise is the better part of discretion ? Might a new president be closer to moderation and Jesse Jackson than extremism and Jesse James ? &quot; It won ' t make one bit of difference who becomes president , &quot; Corbin snorts . &quot; There is no way the present board is going_to change direction and thinking_of NRA . Which is no compromise , no surrender. &quot; * No wonder those around former Arizona Atty . Gen . Corbin , his state and its legacies do think_of him as Buffalo Bob . Also a banty rooster who calls a spade a shovel ; a frontier thinker who sees only blacks_and_whites , guilt or innocence , victims and perpetrators . Also a little big man of several fascinations . * Corbin has been married to one woman for 34 years , is opposed to abortion , favors the death_penalty , enrolled his grandson in the NRA at the age of 3 days and is a lifelong Republican . Deborah Corbin , his oldest daughter , is divorced , supports abortion rights , and is both anti-gun and a registered Democrat . They do not speak . * Corbin has followed Yaqui guides into Mexico in pursuit of century-old whispers about bars of buried gold . His highest fever centers_on the Lost Dutchman Mine of the Superstition Mountains east of here . Corbin has spent 40 years and made 300 treks in search of the mine without finding enough ore for a pair of cuff links . * Corbin may_not know where that tha ' ar gold is hiding , but he certainly knows where its miner is buried . He once lead a municipal drive that restored a pioneers ' cemetery near downtown Phoenix and the weedy , cracked , 1891 grave of Jacob Waltz , last known digger of the Lost Dutchman . * In 1965 , Corbin , as Maricopa County attorney , handled the rape and kidnaping prosecution of Ernesto Miranda , whose appeal of an earlier criminal tangle produced the Supreme Court ' s sine_qua_non decision on suspects ' rights . Corbin won conviction . Miranda went_to prison for four years . In 1976 , in a fight in a Phoenix bar , Miranda was stabbed to death . &quot; There were witnesses , &quot; Corbin remembers . &quot; But nobody said a word . They knew their Miranda rights and that murder remains unsolved. &quot; * The only creak in Corbin ' s career was over his friendship with the financially powerful developer of the Phoenician resort . When Corbin contemplated a run_for governor , his friend donated $ 39 # 000 to the campaign . That was in 1986 , when there seemed nothing wrong in accepting money from Charles Keating . In 1990 , with the savings and loan scandal unraveling , with political enemies after a hard-nosed attorney_general ' s hide , Corbin made a typically pugnacious gesture . He refunded Keating ' s $ 39 # 000 -- but to the Resolution Trust Corp. , which is prosecuting and overseeing the S &amp; L bailout . * If there was a trademark to Corbin ' s public_service , it was always an office with props of a territorial lawyer : roll-top desk , spittoon , the bass tick of a Regulator clock and a framed invitation to a 19th-Century public hanging . Corbin wishes he had lived there and then . &quot; If I could have picked my time , it would have been 1860 in the West , &quot; he explains . &quot; Arizona . New Mexico . They were all settled by independent , tough , strong people who gave_up family and friends to struggle out here. &quot; that ' s why Corbin prowls ghost_towns and graveyards . To touch and sense the energies of that generation . that ' s why he has studied outlaw histories and recognizes a trace of gunfighter in his makeup . that ' s certainly why Jim Skelly , friend , political ally and state legislator describes Corbin as &quot; the last relic of frontier justice . . . he believes wrongdoers should be punished . He doesn ' t buy that modern crap that all these things are society ' s fault. &quot; Old foes from a dozen years as Arizona ' s attorney_general may doubt Corbin ' s methods and means . But never his uncorruptibility . New enemies from Corbin ' s two NRA terms will dispute his beliefs . But never his sincerity . And no one accuses Corbin of partisan prosecutions . In 1988 , Republican Atty . Gen . Corbin busted Republican Gov . Evan Mecham for misusing campaign contributions . Charges were dismissed . But only after Mecham was impeached . In 1987 , Corbin indicted former GOP congressman Sam Steiger for extortion of a parole board_member . Steiger was convicted but won on appeal . &quot; He ' s a fascist at heart , &quot; Steiger says . He attacks Corbin for everything from a &quot; low IQ &quot; to &quot; bad breath. &quot; &quot; But I have a deep and undying bias that won ' t go_away by logic and common sense. &quot; Clearly , Corbin is a law-and-order man in the mold of Roy Bean and somewhere to the right of Daryl Gates . &quot; There must be stability in the law so people know what to do , &quot; he believes . &quot; Someone once said I would prosecute my own mother . Probably true. &quot; Probably not . Mother is 91 . * Fascination for firearms began when Robert Keith Corbin was 12 and a . 22 caliber Springfield was a rite of passage for kids in Worthington , Ind . Corbin took his first rifle atop a railroad trestle over the junction of the Eel and White_rivers and plinked at water_snakes . At 18 , he ate bananas and milk to make 111 pounds in skivvies , minimum weight for joining the Navy . Corbin served two years , spent his GI Bill to study accounting , and worked as a court bailiff to pay_for 3 1 / 2 years of night_school and a law_degree . By then , he knew by heart a Saturday Evening Post story about the Superstition Mountains . It told of silver bars a person might trip over , of lost gold mines and an immigrant miner named Waltz . To Corbin , the piece promised &quot; freedom of the West . . . a place where if you gave your word , you didn ' t have to put it in writing . One Saturday in 1957 , Corbin was admitted to the Indiana Bar . On the following Monday , with law books and luggage jammed into a Triumph TR-2 , he headed for Arizona . &quot; I came_through the Salt River Canyon at night , &quot; he says . &quot; There was this huge moon , a_million stars and cactus black against the sky . I remember mountains , silent , proud , honest . I knew the people would be the same way. &quot; * But the people first encountered by Corbin as a rookie prosecutor with the Maricopa County Attorney ' s Office were murderers and wife beaters . Even then , Corbin ' s impartiality was close to a religion . He heard rumors that a judge was signing blank bail_bond releases . The jurist happened to be the ex-county attorney who had hired Corbin . No matter . Corbin took the complaint to the presiding judge . His former boss resigned and left the state . As county attorney and state_attorney general , there was no misinterpreting Corbin ' s Way : die-hard and unflinching conservativism . Lock ' em up and let ' em hear the tinkle of keys being thrown_away . If there be more criminals , let there be more prisons . To be effective , the death_penalty must be swift and sure with a limit on appeals . &quot; But I don ' t think I ' m a dying breed , &quot; he says . &quot; I think I ' m a breed that has been put_back in a corner for the last 30 years . And I think people are waking_up . We ' re going back to the basics. &quot; Until recent tempering of Arizona by a younger , more liberal electorate , Corbin ' s views were a snug fit . By all analyses , they also built an effective attorney_general ' s office . * Under Corbin , the agency became the 10th largest in the nation . He doubled its staff of lawyers and investigators , quadrupled the annual budget and scored a 95 % conviction rate . And when his terms were done_in 1991 , his attorneys presented their hip-shooting boss with a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine_gun . Burton Barr , an old adversary from the Arizona House of Representatives , doesn ' t agree with Corbin ' s shoving ways . Those who can ' t concede alternative sides to an issue , he says , stand_in the way of progress . The history of America is dialogue and compromise while deciding what one must give to get . On the other hand , Barr notes , the threat of organized_crime against Arizona lurked huge when Corbin was in office and &quot; he had to fight it hard and fight it large . Yes , organized crime retreated before the threat and effectiveness of Bob Corbin. &quot; * Corbin ' s cursing would have stirred a dead outlaw . On this , his latest prospecting trip , a horse had stomped hard and Corbin ' s toe was between a rock and a hard hoof . But in these harsh Superstition Mountains , which have buried six dozen men , coarse words and men are part of the ecosystem . It ' s lovely lore . They say Apache Jack was killed by a curse picked_up here . When they found Adolph Ruth ' s skull , a hole in the side matched the punch of a . 45 caliber slug . Miner Jacob Weisner died of blood_poisoning after ripping an Apache arrow out of his arm and shoulder . All had looked_for the Lost Dutchman Mine of Jacob Waltz . None would have denied this lode was worth dying for : Filthy rich gold ore worth $ 1.6 million a ton . And Bob Corbin won ' t stop prowling the Superstitions , poking for the Lost Dutchman until he dies . Preferably of natural causes and very wealthy . But there is a more to it than gold lust . The Superstitions , cool and exquisite in spring , a hot death sentence in summer , are Corbin ' s Walden Pond . &quot; Over the years , it ' s the only place I can go where you ( reporters ) can ' t get_to me , &quot; he says . &quot; When I get_on a horse , I forget about phones and cities and politics . My mind is here. &quot; &quot; Here &quot; is approaching Weaver ' s Needle , a tall , broad pillar setting directions from just about anywhere within the soul of the Superstitions . The rocky , broken trail is hours from Apache Junction , where Corbin picked_up a new mare . But Corbin doesn ' t need the Needle to find his way . * Several hundred trips have taught him each crease and creek of the endless Superstitions . He has read every word , heard every rumor of the Lost Dutchmen . He has held its ore , which is &quot; half-gold , half-quartz , the richest I ' ve ever seen. &quot; He wants to believe that the mine is still there . Although it might be covered over . He has studied 100 maps of its location and none agree . But one could be right . So this day is like all other times he has backpacked the Superstitions . A good horse with a back made of bricks . A young sky lifting frowns from the canyons . Tobacco in his pipe . Vienna_sausages out of the can and always the escape of silent loneliness . Three hours into the mountains , Corbin and mount have climbed Black Top with its far overview of LeBarge Canyon . Corbin ties the mare to a thorn bush , starts talking and history pours : &quot; They found Ruth ' s body just down there in 1931 . Well , his head was found under a Palo Verde tree and the body a mile away . &quot; Marie Jones used to work the Needle . Her grandfather was half-black , half-Apache who had told her about a jewel-encrusted , gold statue of Christ buried in the Needle by Apaches who had massacred a Mexican pack train . &quot; God , don ' t get me started . But that ' s why it is intriguing . Like I said , I have always wanted to live_in the 1800s and this land is the way it was in the 1800s . &quot; There ' s peace out here . Except when Crazy Jake is dynamiting. &quot; * During a maiden bid for attorney_general , Corbin considered making a television commercial that showed him on horseback , a six-gun on each hip . During a campaign speech , he suggested that the best way to stop airborne drug runners might be to shoot them down . With stiff postures his legacy , friends say , no wonder Corbin became president of the National Rifle Assn . Nor were they surprised to learn that he was point_man in a coup to reload this rich , all-powerful lobby from placid years when membership fell , lobbying went limp , association policies emphasized target shooting before self-defense and gun_control editorials remained unchallenged . &quot; What we ' ve done is throw_out ( moderate Warren ) Cassidy , the executive_vice_president . . . and brought_in ( Executive_Vice_President ) Wayne La Pierre with the idea that we were going_to fight , &quot; Corbin says . Corbin is comfortable on a sofa at_home , an unpretentious adobe ranch with a gasp of a view of Phoenix sprawling flatly to the south . There ' s a portrait on a wall , a bad oil of Corbin with the statue of blind justice when both were much younger , less jaundiced . Corbin ' s iced_tea is melting . He is puffing his pipe into a smog alert . The topics are NRA and the media , Congress and its Brady Bunch , the state of the gun battle and the future of the war . NRA membership , he says , is up_to 3.4 million from 2.4 million during the Cassidy era . Although a recruiting blitz , a campaign to counterattack the media , and a program to rebuild national and local lobbies ate $ 40 million in NRA cash reserves , there ' s still $ 50 million in the ammo box . &quot; And we ' ve instituted a lot of new programs , &quot; Corbin notes . There ' s Crime Strike in support of local anti-crime bills and responsible , in part , for pushing three-strikes-you ' re-out legislation . Also seminars to instruct women in firearm self-defense and programs on gun safety for elementary_school students . * Some , however , challenge Corbin ' s effectiveness . They say the American majority favors some form of gun_control ; therefore , the NRA is flogging a dead cause . Corbin returns fire : &quot; The media says we have lost our clout in Congress . But we were in 31 House races two years ago . You know how many we lost ? One. &quot; Corbin doesn ' t understand the media . He thinks that gun_control editorials are moved more by emotions , by grief at today ' s violence , than by the balanced reason and facts of the issue . Editors and general assignment reporters are generally younger , and often from the East , he says , where hands-on experience with firearms is limited . But the NRA ' s immediate priority , he says , is zeroing on the Brady Act -- so named for press secretary Jim Brady , shot in the brain during the attempted assassination of then-President Ronald Reagan . NRA-backed suits in five states are seeking to overturn the law and further confirm individual Second Amendment rights to &quot; the right of the people to keep and bear arms. &quot; Corbin sees the Second Amendment as sacrosanct as the First guaranteeing freedoms_of_speech , religion and the press . &quot; My God , &quot; he snorts . The lighter is clacking again , his pipe belching and glowing . &quot; Somebody breathes that they are going_to do something to the media and they are up in arms screaming about First_Amendment rights . &quot; When we scream about Second Amendment rights , we ' re evil , we ' re wrong , we should compromise. &quot; * It ' s all_over now . Years of estimating public moods and second-guessing political_systems . Months of trials , unseeing juries and work_days ending at dawn . Until , at 65 , Bob Corbin knows that there are no new debates , only stale arguments presented by fresh opponents . &quot; It ' s got a little old , &quot; he says . &quot; Some days you feel_like going_out and fighting . Some days you want somebody else to do_it . So I guess it ' s time I backed_off and started enjoying myself. &quot; Bob and Helen Corbin will enjoy themselves at Walker , site of a disappeared gold town , and the cabin they are rebuilding in the Bradshaw Mountains north of here . Helen will continue to write home-grown and locally successful paperbacks . Bob will get really serious about extended explorations to gold fields lost and far . Recently , among the trees and the 7 # 000-foot silence , with plops of frozen snow still clinging at this level , Corbin looked_back . Maybe he is out of touch ; a man whose day and ideas have passed . But they worked well in his time and one day , who knows , those old basics of a firm handshake and honest words might help this country again . He regrets nothing . Except for what his career stole from three daughters : &quot; When my kids were little , I thought politics were important and you had to be everywhere . If it took you until 3 in the morning to solve a problem , you stayed until 3 in the morning. &quot; * But daughter Kathy Corbin-Russ , 33 , a wife and mother , NRA-educated gun owner and a Phoenix golfing professional , speaks no resentment . She says Dad did what a professional dad has to do . &quot; Mom tried to balance it all out and that seemed to work fine , &quot; she says . &quot; I don ' t think I missed anything. &quot; Lori LaJeunesse , 37 , a Los Angeles nutritionist and personal trainer , says life with father was softer than one might imagine . &quot; If I ' d done something wrong and had to wait until father to get home , he ' d ask : ' What do you think you should do ? ' &quot; she recalls . &quot; Mother would ground you for life . Deborah Corbin , 41 , of Washington , D.C. , a membership benefits representative with the American Federation of Teachers , sees her father as &quot; a man with integrity . . . intense , very smart , reserved. &quot; But they have been estranged for years . &quot; I ' m a unionist . . . a feminist and a registered Democrat , a member of NOW ( National Organization of Women ) and pro-choice and absolutely anti-gun , &quot; she says . &quot; So there ' s sort of no common ground. &quot; Meanwhile , Corbin continues painting and plastering the cabin on an 1897 gold claim . He has installed a burglar_alarm , for this remote mountain home between Potato Patch and Big Bug Creek has been broken_into seven times in five years . That riles Corbin ' s sense of frontier justice . He says he ' d like to string_up the burglars . Then display the bodies like coyotes as a warning to others . When the corpses crumble , he ' d rebuild the skeletons with baling wire . &quot; I ' m joking , &quot; he says . &quot; I guess. &quot;</TEXT>
