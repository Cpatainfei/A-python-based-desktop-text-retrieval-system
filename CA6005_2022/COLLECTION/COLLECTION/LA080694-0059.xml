   <HEADLINE> OIL EXPORTS AND JOBS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Michael Parrish correctly states the economic opportunities awaiting the U.S. by lifting the ban on the export of Alaskan crude ( &quot; Study Sees 25 # 000 Oil Jobs If Alaska Export Ban Ends , &quot; July 1 ) . An additional benefit not mentioned is the reduction in our dependency on foreign oil.By allowing the export of Alaskan crude we can effectively reduce the amount of oil imported . The fear of higher oil prices due_to the introduction of the higher-quality oil is irrational if we consider the price we will ultimately pay_for our dependency on foreign oil . Just recall the 1973 oil embargo and the prices we were paying at the pump during the Gulf War . The boost the American economy ( and particularly California ' s ) can get from lifting the ban is_well worth the consequences . NITZAN MATZKEVICH Fullerton</TEXT>
