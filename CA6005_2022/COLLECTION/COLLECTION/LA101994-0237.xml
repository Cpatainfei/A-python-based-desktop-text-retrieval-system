   <HEADLINE> STEAM_HEAT ; TEST OF WILLS BETWEEN 2 GEOTHERMAL FIRMS COULD GET EVEN HOTTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the takeover battle between the nation ' s two largest geothermal companies continues to escalate , California Energy Co . will probably have to boost its offer for Magma Power Co . to more_than $ 1 billion if its hostile bid is going_to succeed , analysts say . At issue is the proposed union of two little-known but prosperous geothermal companies , the largest survivors of a government-sponsored effort that began in the late 1970s as an effort to foster the growth of &quot; alternative_energy &quot; companies that harness wind , solar and steam power for profit . The contest has been a test of wills between an aggressive company from Nebraska with a California name and a staid utility in San Diego with strong ties to Dow Chemical . The fight has also put a spotlight on changes sweeping the entire electric_power industry . Utilities are going_down the same path toward deregulation and free-market competition as trucking , airlines and other once-protected U.S. industries . Power_companies large and small could soon be competing for customers , who ultimately will be able to shop around for the best electricity and gas rates . And because current fossil fuel-generated power costs less than half what geothermal does to produce , and because government-mandated subsidies for alternative_energy producers are slowly melting away , geothermal companies face a bleak future in the United States , despite the enormous technological advances made by Magma Power and others . Despite that , the $ 840 million California Energy has offered for Magma shows there is life yet left in the geothermal industry in overseas markets such_as the Philippines , where fossil_fuels are scarce , and Indonesia , where they are exported to generate foreign currency . Indonesia alone is expected to build 3 # 000 megawatts of geothermal generating capacity over the next decade -- as much as currently exists in the United States , according to Kidder Peabody geothermal expert Bill Short . And both California Energy and Magma Power expect to play strong roles in developing that power . &quot; For every unit of opportunity for geothermal domestically , you have 10 units internationally , &quot; Short said . The exploitation of overseas markets was a major factor_in California Energy ' s proposal to buy Magma Power for $ 35 a share_in cash and stock . By combining , the two companies could compete more efficiently , California Energy Chairman David Sokol said when the offer was announced . Since then , the battle has heated_up steadily . Magma Power ' s board formally rejected the unsolicited offer and advised shareholders to turn a deaf ear to its suitor . Last week , California Energy stepped_up the pace by initiating a proxy_fight that would force a special shareholders meeting at which it could present its case directly to Magma investors . On Monday , the two companies traded lawsuits in federal_court in Nevada , where Magma is incorporated . California Energy accused Magma Power of violating its fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders , while Magma Power accused California Energy of violating disclosure laws relating to its proposed acquisition and proxy solicitation . Magma Power , which runs seven geothermal plants in the Imperial Valley that generate enough power to light a city of 250 # 000 people , is also taking its case directly to Wall_Street and large investors , saying it is worth more_than $ 840 million , mainly because of its international prospects . Many financial analysts , including UBS Securities ' Daniele Seitz , say California Energy will probably have to bump its offer to $ 40 a share if its tender_offer is to succeed . &quot; At this point , shareholders see this as an underwhelming bid , a bit shy , &quot; Seitz said . &quot; They are waiting to see whether California Energy means business. &quot; Sokol said in an interview that his company &quot; won ' t go_to $ 40 . . . . But we ' ve been willing since Sept . 19 to sit_down and negotiate all terms of our proposal. &quot; California Energy moved its headquarters from San Francisco to Omaha in 1991 , in part to be near its largest shareholder , general contractor Peter Kiewit &amp; Sons , which owns a 43 % stake . Because its six energy plants are in the Mammoth and Yuma areas , the company retained California in its name . Magma Power is 21 % -owned by Dow Chemical , whose engineers helped the company solve the riddle of harnessing superheated brines , which flow in subterranean currents a mile below the Imperial Valley at temperatures of 550 degrees Fahrenheit . Though Dow has lowered its stake in Magma from 41 % two years ago , the two companies maintain strong links . Several of Magma Power ' s current and past executives , including Chief_Executive Ralph Boeker , are former Dow Chemical executives . Both California Energy and Magma Power are highly profitable , thanks in part to the federal and state subsidies for alternative_energy companies in the 1970s . The government ' s goal was to reduce a dependency on foreign oil and to foster environmentally clean power . New laws mandated that utilities such_as Southern California Edison sign contracts of up_to 30 years to buy geothermal , wind and solar_energy , paying the projected cost of fossil_fuel power . Over the initial 10 years , utilities were to pay at a fixed rate based on the hypothetical cost of a barrel of oil , which was projected to rise as high as $ 40 . Instead of rising , the price of fossil_fuel declined to about $ 17 a barrel level , the current price . Now , as the 10-year fixed-price periods are ending , the contracts with geothermal producers are being repriced to reflect actual power costs . The result will be a dramatic drop_in revenue for Magma and others . For example , Southern California Edison is now paying producers such_as Magma about 11 cents per kilowatt-hour for its geothermal power . If the contracts were adjusted today to reflect the cost of natural_gas , the price to Magma would drop to about 2.7 cents , according to Don Fellows , manager of non-utility power purchases for Edison . Magma Power can now produce power at about 5.7 cents a kilowatt-hour , Boeker said . But that ' s still about twice the cost of power produced by natural_gas . &quot; Because of the low price of natural_gas , we haven ' t been able to do anything , &quot; said David N . Anderson , executive_director of Geothermal Resources Council , a trade association of geothermal companies based in Davis , Calif . &quot; We ' re not bringing_in anyone new into the business . Jobs are not growing. &quot; According to Anderson , the number of U.S. geothermal developers and producers has dropped to 10 from more_than 25 in the late 1970s . But the geothermal energy industry is not going_to disappear , said Jan Hamrin , a principal in the environmental consulting_firm Hansen McOuat Hamrin &amp; Rhode in San Francisco . &quot; There is a national interest in ensuring that geothermal survives , in structuring a new utility industry that brings_down electric rates but which hedges against future risks of escalating oil prices , &quot; Hamrin said . Geothermal Profit California Energy and Magma Power are two little-known , but highly profitable , geothermal companies now locked_in an increasing bitter takeover battle . The firms are the largest survivors of a government-sponsored effort that began in the 1970s to foster the growth of &quot; alternative_energy &quot; companies . MAGMA POWER CO .
