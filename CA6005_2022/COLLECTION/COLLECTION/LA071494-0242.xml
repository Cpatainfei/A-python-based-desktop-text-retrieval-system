   <HEADLINE> EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : MOORPARK ; COMET ' S IMPACT ON JUPITER TO BE VIEWED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A program at the Moorpark College Observatory this weekend will give residents a chance to see the planet Jupiter through the observatory ' s telescope before and after it is hit by the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 . On Friday , there will be an informal discussion and picnic starting at 6 p.m. on the grounds around the observatory on the campus , 7075 Campus Road.At sunset , telescopes will be set_up to look_at Jupiter , a day before the comet is expected to strike the planet . &quot; we ' ll see what the planet ' s atmosphere looks_like before it is hit , &quot; said Hal Jandorf , an astronomy instructor at Moorpark College . &quot; This will be a sort of before-and-after program. &quot; An unusual stream of 21 comet fragments -- each the size of a mountain -- will begin striking Jupiter on Saturday , continuing over the next five days . A second program at the observatory scheduled Sunday will look_at how the first fragments to strike the planet will affect its atmosphere . Sunday ' s program will begin at 8 p.m. and last until 10:30 p.m. , when Jupiter sinks too low on the horizon to see . Jandorf said the program will include a discussion about comets that have struck the Earth , such_as the comet that some scientists believe caused the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago . There will be a $ 3 charge for those attending Sunday ' s program . Observatory officials suggest that children under age 6 may be too young for the program . For information and updated conditions for star-gazing , call the Ventura County Astronomical Society ' s Star Line at 529-7813 . SCOTT HADLY</TEXT>
