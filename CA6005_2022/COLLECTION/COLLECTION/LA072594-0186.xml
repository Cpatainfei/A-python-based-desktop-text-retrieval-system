   <HEADLINE> TOKYO SAYS NEW CHINESE SATELLITE VIOLATES WORLD PACT ; TELECOM : APSTAR-1 WAS SQUEEZED INTO AN ORBIT BETWEEN RUSSIA ' S RIMSAT AND JAPAN ' S SAKURA 3A .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Chinese satellite intended for use by many well-known broadcasters has been launched in defiance of international rules into an orbit where it will disrupt Japanese telecommunications , government officials here have charged . &quot; we ' ll immediately take appropriate measures if China switches_on the satellite transponders and causes transmission interference with our satellite , &quot; an official of Japan ' s Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told Reuters news_agency Friday . He did not specify what Japan ' s action would be . Reuters Television is one of the clients scheduled to use the Chinese Apstar-1 satellite , launched Thursday into an orbit squeezed between a Japanese and a Russian satellite . The new satellite is expected to start transmissions in about a month . Other broadcasters that have been expected to use Apstar-1 include CNN , ESPN , Home Box_Office Asia , Viacom International , Discovery Communications , TVB International and Hong Kong ' s Television Broadcasts Ltd . Some have made back-up plans , however . The increasingly bitter Tokyo-Beijing dispute heightens the possibility that more broadcasters will turn_to using a privately owned satellite , called the PAS-2 , that was built by Hughes Aircraft Co . for PanAmSat Corp . The PAS-2 was launched by France ' s Arianespace July 8 from French Guiana to an orbit positioned to serve the Asia-Pacific region . PanAmSat is controlled by founder Rene V . Anselmo and the Mexican firm Grupo Televiso . The new Chinese satellite is positioned close to a Japanese satellite known as Sakura 3a that handles much of the international telecommunications and other services of Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp . Earlier this month , an NTT spokesman said problems could be prevented by a minor shift in the planned orbit of the Chinese satellite . Tokyo has been pressing Beijing for more_than a year to either alter the satellite ' s planned orbit or agree not to use bandwidths employed by the Sakura 3a . Japan sent a delegation to Beijing to seek a solution to the problem , but it met with no success , the ministry official said . Japan charges that China is violating rules established by the International Telecommunications Union , a 182-country , United Nations-affiliated body that supervises the global use of satellite positions and broadcast frequencies . The union lacks effective enforcement powers , however . Some analysts fear that if China flouts global rules , there could be a destructive and expensive breakdown of international order in satellite transmissions . China is aggressively seeking to promote its satellite-launch services as an inexpensive alternative to Western competitors . The Apstar-1 is owned by APT Satellite Co . of Hong Kong , a Beijing-controlled consortium that includes three Chinese government bodies , Singapore Telecom and companies backed by investors from Thailand , Macao and Taiwan . Japan ' s Sakura 3a is in an orbit that positions it constantly at a longitude of 132 degrees east , while Russia ' s Rimsat orbits at 130 east . China said it was placing the Apstar-1 between these two satellites , at 131 degrees east . Tokyo insists that that is too close to avoid interference . &quot; Because Japan had placed its satellite earlier than China , the international rules oblige China to secure consent from us , but there has been no action whatsoever from China , &quot; the ministry official said . As controversy over the planned Chinese launch heated_up earlier this month , an APT Satellite spokesman in Hong Kong insisted that Japan had no basis for concern . The company , he said , was working_out &quot; a technical solution to minimize the effect if interference should occur. &quot;</TEXT>
