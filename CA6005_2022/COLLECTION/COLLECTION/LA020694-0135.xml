   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; JEAN-JACQUES BEINEIX ; DEFENDING THE FRENCH FILM_INDUSTRY AGAINST A GLOBAL U.S. MOVIE MARKET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first feature_film Jean-Jacques Beineix directed was the kind no Hollywood studio would have made . It had a paltry $ 1 million budget . No name stars . Everyone speaking a foreign language . And , of course , a first-time director at the helm . Yet , his 1981 thriller , &quot; Diva , &quot; became a critical and commercial success in the United States , where it is still among the 10 most-successful foreign films . Beineix was hailed as a genius and compared to Orson Welles . So it was only natural that the director , now 47 , and still one of France ' s most gifted filmmakers watched the recent world-trade talks , and especially the battle between French filmmakers and Hollywood studios , with deep concern . Simply put , Hollywood wants the_French government to level the playing_field for entertainment programming by eliminating subsidies for French films and minimum quotas for French TV programming . But to the_French , guardians of Europe ' s only flourishing film_industry , Hollywood ' s efforts are an unabashed attempt to crush France ' s cultural heritage . France managed to keep the whole issue out of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , but the war for the big and small screens of France is far from over . During the past year , eight of the 10 top-grossing films in France have been American . ( The only two French films on the list , &quot; Les Visiteurs &quot; and &quot; Germinal , &quot; are scheduled for U.S. release later this year. ) The dispute recently reached its nadir when the_French producer Daniel Toscan du Plantier suggested that the Los Angeles earthquake was a sign that God had taken the_French side on the issue . ( Toscan du Plantier later apologized for his &quot; bad private joke. &quot; Jack Valenti , head of the Motion_Picture Assn . of America , accepted the apology. ) Although Beineix and other French actors , producers and directors have sharply criticized Toscan du Plantier ' s &quot; joke , &quot; they remain angered by Hollywood ' s designs on the_French market . The son of a Paris insurance salesman , Beineix fell_in_love with films as a youngster , feasting on the classic French works but also on the films of such Americans as Welles , John Huston , Woody Allen and Jerry Lewis . Beineix studied medicine but quit school after three years to work as an assistant director on several dozen films . Since &quot; Diva , &quot; he has directed four films , including &quot; Betty Blue , &quot; a modest success in the United States . Today , Beineix works_out of an old building in northern Paris , next door to an X-rated movie_house , and he recently finished several long TV documentaries . His most recent feature , &quot; IP5 , &quot; starring Yves Montand in the late actor ' s last role , made a modest profit in France , though it has yet to find a U.S. distributor . &quot; A lot of people were interested , but nothing happened , &quot; he said . * Question : Jack Valenti , head of the Motion_Picture Assn . of America , contends that French films should compete with American films on an equal footing and let the audiences decide which films they like best . What ' s wrong with that ? Answer : What Valenti is talking_about is business and , business-wise , he is right . But our civilization needs something else . Our fight is to tell this ( American ) lobby that we need some room to express ourselves , not we as French or Italians but we citizens of the world -- Japanese artists , Mexicans artists , Brazilian artists , whoever they are . We know that the strategy of these companies is to make a profit as quickly as possible . They now see no difference between making a film and taking_out an insurance_policy . They want insurance for success . But creativity is something else . You don ' t have to always increase a movie ' s pace , become more violent and less intelligent . We don ' t have to give people what they expect instead of trying to raise their expectations . That is why I think we are rendering an extremely important service to this business . Let ' s say , it ' s a kind of research . Even Hollywood needs some fresh blood . We are investing in research , and this research will help the system of filmmaking to survive . Q : Meaning the_French film_industry ? A : Not just French . It is the same for a lot of artists in America . This is not a fight against America at all . Q : But by erecting barriers to American entertainment in France , isn ' t France practicing blatant protectionism ? A : It is very easy to talk_about protectionism . But is it protectionism to save something that belongs_to the heritage of the human community ? America has always fought monopolies . It is even in your law . So if you accuse us of protectionism , then we must accuse you of monopolizing 80 % of our market . So , we just want some room so that all_the people interested in this type of creation could have some room for their own sake . And I think the system would be much smarter to help this cinema exist . If you don ' t , you will slowly reduce the audience ' s choices . And I think that is a big mistake . Q : But let ' s take Jean Renoir , one of France ' s greatest directors . He didn ' t need protection . A : Who needed protection in that time in the business ? Q : So you think things have changed ? A : The rules have changed . We are in a position now where a foreign industry has 80 % of our market and looking_for 100 % . . . . So I tell the Americans , be careful . You are going_to lose a lot of image . The feeling of anti-Americanism is growing . And the American industry has more to lose than to win . The Japanese went too far in America , and it created a backlash . The same will happen in this country . Q : But the fact is that the most popular films in French cinemas today are American . Do you think French filmmakers have lost touch with their audience ? A : This trade fight has nothing to do with America or Europe . It is about values , artistic points_of_view , independence and freedom . The cinema is a place of freedom ; it is a place where people can express themselves . Q : But what ' s wrong with making films that audiences want to see ? Isn ' t that the point of making films ? A : Let ' s say you have two products . One is selling very well , the other isn ' t . Is it because the first product is better than the second or is it because the marketing is better ? The crisis of our cinema is almost an ideological crisis . The audiences do not believe_in themselves anymore . So they would rather go and see an American film , which is bringing them far from their home , far from their country , and they will dream about something they do not know about . I don ' t have the feeling that our films are less interesting than the usual American film . I would say our countries have the same average of good and bad films . Q : Then why aren ' t French films more popular in the world ? A : You have to know that our language is a language spoken by maybe 1 % , 2 % , 3 % of the people in the world . We do not sell abroad . American films do sell abroad . With this market , they can have the money for the distribution , they can spend the money to advertise , make prints , etc . We could improve the quality of our films , of course . But much of it is purely technical and financial . A lot of people in this country have the talent to do those big American-style films . But we do not have the market . That is the problem . We are now -- and this is what I think is unfair -- investing in research for a lot of talent that will work later in America . Q : Is there some essential difference between French and American films ? A : I don ' t think so . But the big American films are mainly action films , with violence and big stars . Look_at &quot; Cliffhanger. &quot; I went_to see that picture . It was entertaining , but I couldn ' t help thinking , is this going_to be something you are proud to leave your children ? I don ' t think it is being unfair to ask this industry to spend a little bit of its money to find people like John Ford , Hemingway , Welles . Just because these films please an international audience doesn ' t mean it ' s good cinema . Would you say a hamburger was a gastronomic success in the history of cooking ? No , but it is a very easy way to provide the biggest number of people with the simplest food possible . Cinema should do more_than just feed people with ready-made , easily recognizable products . I expect more . Q : So you don ' t think that French cinema would survive without protection , without some government assistance ? A : Well , here I think there is a big misunderstanding . The decision of this country to take a percentage of the profits and use it to help fund the next project is an investment in the industry . When you just consider cinema to be a product , you have a problem . If you let the market make all_the decisions about pacing , actors and even good and bad endings , then it doesn ' t work . Our ( French ) system allows us to take some of these risks , to have first-time directors and unknown actors . &quot; Diva &quot; would never had been made by a studio . &quot; Betty Blue &quot; would never , never had been made by a studio . I find new actors all_the time . That would be impossible if it had been a studio approach . Is this hell , is this the end of the world ? No , I think it is a nice system . Q : But if films can ' t survive on_their_own , with audiences willing to buy tickets , maybe they shouldn ' t exist . A : No , No , No . Would you say autistic children shouldn ' t survive because they can ' t survive on_their_own ? Q : Surely you ' re not saying the_French film_industry is handicapped ? A : No . But because we are small , because obviously the rules of standardization , rough-and-tough liberalization will not allow the system to survive , we should still be allowed to render a service to the community of artists worldwide . I think it is common_sense to say you can ' t treat the values of intelligence and creativity the way you do soap or soup or cars . Sincerely . Q : What do you think_about the American film business today ? A : I ' ve become disillusioned . After &quot; Diva , &quot; I was almost ready to emigrate ( to the United States ) because I had the feeling that Europe was old-fashioned and decaying . But then I discovered that Hollywood was decaying , too . Not because of the people . . . but because of the mentality , the greediness . This business is really a business , and artists have become some kind of strange , difficult beings . I thought that Hollywood was the place you could make dreams come true , where adventure was possible . But it is just bureaucratic , and it ' s less and less involved in creation and creativity . Q : You had a big success with &quot; Diva &quot; in the United States , and yet you have had only one other film , &quot; Betty Blue , &quot; distributed there . Why is that ? A : At first , Hollywood saw me as some kind of exotic puppet . I was pretty hot at the time , and they were saying , &quot; Well , he did this ' Diva ' for $ 1 million ; let ' s have him do another one for the same amount , but for an American audience. &quot; An American audience ? I still don ' t understand what that means , but I ' ve heard it a lot. *</TEXT>
