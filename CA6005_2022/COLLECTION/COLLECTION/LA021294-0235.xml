   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : DONATIONS SOUGHT IN QUAKE RELIEF EFFORT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Operation USA , a Los Angeles-based international relief development agency , is asking_for donations ranging from Tylenol to tractor-trailers full of blankets in an earthquake relief effort spreading throughout the damaged area , including the heavy-hit San Fernando Valley . The organization works with community-based medical clinics , free clinics and groups such_as Proyecto del Barrio , a Pacoima agency whose building was severely damaged in last month ' s earthquake . Operation USA is asking_for donations of diapers , baby food , infant formula , sunscreen , plastic sheeting , blankets and medical supplies . &quot; I just got_off the phone with one of the clinics we ' re working with . We need Tylenol , Liquid Tylenol , insulin syringes , bandages , &quot; said Kim Zamarin , Operation USA administrator . &quot; There ' s an ongoing need for blankets , &quot; she added . &quot; We ' ve gotten_out over 3 # 000 , and 1 # 200 are going_out in the next two days , but we need more. &quot; The organization hopes that manufacturers or distributors will donate supplies in bulk , but any donation will be accepted . &quot; They can send 50 cents if that ' s what they have to help . It all comes_together and we turn it around. &quot; Operation USA isn ' t looking_for volunteer help yet , Zamarin said , unless the volunteer comes_with a tractor-trailer . &quot; If they are volunteers who have big trucks and can donate time -- time and big trucks -- that would be excellent , &quot; she said . For more information , call 1-800-678-7255 or send donations to Operation USA , L.A. Quake , 8320 Melrose Ave. , No . 200 , Los Angeles 90069 . REBECCA BRYANT</TEXT>
