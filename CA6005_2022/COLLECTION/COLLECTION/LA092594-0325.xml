   <HEADLINE> NOTEBOOK ; REED TO TOIL FOR MANUAL ARTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Travis Reed is only a sophomore , but he ' s attending his third high_school , Manual Arts , this fall . Reed was the only freshman on Crenshaw High ' s state champion basketball_team in March . After the season , the 6-foot-5 left-handed guard-forward moved to Fontana and played_on A.B. Miller High ' s summer league team . He recently moved_back to Los Angeles and enrolled at Manual Arts . Reed will join a Toiler team that finished 20-5 last season and reached the City Section 4-A quarterfinals . Manual Arts was 17-3 this summer and won the Sports World tournament . &quot; We had a pretty successful summer , but we didn ' t have a dominant go-to guy , &quot; Manual Arts Coach Randolph Simpson said . &quot; Travis is multitalented . He ' s a utility_man who can play_on the perimeter or post up . we ' ll play him wherever he is needed. &quot; * Coaches ' corner : If anyone is familiar_with the Marshall High football program , it ' s Jim Beattie , the first-year coach at Northern Conference rival Eagle Rock . Beattie coached Marshall to the 1982 City 2-A title and has been a teacher at the school for the last 21 years . Beattie , 59 , who has coached either football , basketball , track or cross-country at Marshall since 1973 , replaced Gary Kuniyuki , who resigned at Eagle Rock shortly before the season . . . . The Belmont High boys ' cross-country team is seeking its 11th City title . Coach Alex Carmona and assistant coaches Everaldo Silva and Jorge Marquez ran_on the Sentinels ' first City champion team in 1983 . . . . * Soccer update : The Cal State Los Angeles soccer team is eighth in the NCAA Division II rankings . Senior midfielder Jesus Gonzalez , who leads the team with six goals and 12 points , was named most_valuable_player of the Cal State Bakersfield tournament after leading Cal State L.A. ( 7-0-1 ) to the tournament title . Defenders Dario Gomez , Oscar Legaspi , midfielders Luis Hernandez and Juan Carlos Elizarraraz , and forward Mike Martinez also return for Cal State L.A. , which is trying_for its second California Collegiate Athletic Assn . title in three years . The Golden Eagles open CCAA play Saturday at Cal Poly Pomona . East L.A. College is led by midfielder Sergio Vasquez , an All-South Coast Conference selection who scored 15 goals and helped the Huskies to a 20-2-2 record and reach the Southern California regional finals . Freshman Jorge Flores was a member of the United States World Cup national teams for ages 20-and-under and 17-and-under and was recruited by UCLA and Old_Dominion . The team also includes Flavio Rodriguez , Eddie Ferrer and Ernesto Serrano of Bell , Martin Castillo of Bell Gardens , Ricardo Saucedo of Garfield High and Arturo Lopez of Roosevelt . * College Football : Although UCLA was beaten by Nebraska last week , 49-21 , there were a_few shining moments . Freshman wide receiver Jim McElroy , an All-City selection from Washington High last season , provided a couple when he made two receptions for 32 yards in his first college game . It might have gone unnoticed since top receivers Kevin Jordan and All-American J.J. Stokes get all_the attention , but Stokes did not play and UCLA was getting blown_out at the time . Their regulars were taken_out and the 6-0 , 170-pound McElroy had his chance and made the most of it . Correspondent Gary Chavez contributed to this report .</TEXT>
