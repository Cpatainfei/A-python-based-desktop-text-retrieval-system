   <HEADLINE> U.S. , ALLIES MULL MORE STRIKES AS SERBS HIT BIHAC ; BOSNIA : NATO MAY USE AIR_POWER AGAIN TO THWART REBEL ATTACKS . WASHINGTON PUSHES FOR ' EXCLUSION ZONE ' TO PROTECT ENCLAVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States renewed consultations with key allies Tuesday over possible new air strikes to protect the Bosnian town of Bihac , as Serbian nationalists closed_in on the area after Monday ' s Western attack on a Serbian-held airstrip . Clinton_Administration officials said the United States is again pressing the United Nations to call_in more warplanes from the 16-country North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization to prevent the fall of Bihac in the face of the intensified Serbian onslaught . At the same time , Washington was said to be renewing its push to get NATO to declare Bihac an &quot; exclusion zone. &quot; The designation would prohibit the Serbs from using tanks and artillery in the area and would authorize air strikes against violators . The Serbian attacks on Bihac underscored the difficulty for the Administration and its major European partners in the face of a continuing split among the allies , and between the United Nations and NATO , over how to handle the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina . Despite Monday ' s NATO air strike against a Serbian-held airfield in Croatia , Serbian forces continued to press in on Bihac , engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Bosnian government troops and setting villages on_fire . Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic , angrily denouncing NATO as &quot; a criminal organization , &quot; threatened to retaliate against U.N. and NATO forces in a way that &quot; will hurt every member &quot; of NATO . U.S. officials described the situation in Bihac as &quot; growing more desperate by the minute , &quot; with Serbian rebels mounting a three-pronged pincers movement that sent hundreds of refugees streaming out of the enclave . They said that Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic called_in U.S. Ambassador Victor Jackovic in Sarajevo late Tuesday to express &quot; very deep concern &quot; about the possibility that Bihac might fall , providing a major setback for Western peacemaking efforts . The renewed Serbian attacks appeared intended to call the West ' s hand following Monday ' s NATO air strike on the Serbian-held airfield at Udbina . Damage from the raid was modest . The NATO armada of 30 warplanes blew five craters in the airstrip ' s main runways . But Western officials said the raid was designed to &quot; send a signal &quot; that the United Nations would not tolerate the Serbian offensive . Still , for all their obvious embarrassment in the face of the new Serbian attacks , it was not immediately clear what the allies would do to prevent the fall of Bihac or to ward_off any further Serbian retaliation against U.N. forces . The North Atlantic Council , NATO ' s major decision-making arm , is scheduled to meet today to consider a U.S. proposal to create a new &quot; exclusion zone &quot; around Bihac , but officials said Britain and France still are reluctant to go_along . Key European allies have been opposed to increased use of NATO military power because they fear that the Serbs would retaliate and endanger U.N. peacekeeping forces , which comprise mainly French , British and Dutch soldiers . The Europeans regard Washington suspiciously , partly because the United States has no ground forces in Bosnia and also because they regard it as overly aggressive in its efforts to punish the Serbs . Even so , top Administration officials renewed their push for the new plan . U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher had &quot; extensive &quot; telephone_conversations on the issue with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd . The Administration also pursued the issue in the United Nations , but apparently failed to win a consensus . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry warned that if the Serbian nationalists launch additional air strikes against Bihac from the Croatian airfield , NATO warplanes will return and destroy the 15 or 20 Serbian fighters that they intentionally did not attack Monday . Yet time appeared to be running_out . Some U.S. officials believe that , unless some action is taken soon , the fall of Bihac could be imminent . Karadzic ' s intensified rhetoric was not the only sign of heightened defiance . Serbian forces near Banja Luka fired two SA-2 surface-to-air_missiles at British Harrier aircraft patrolling the area for NATO . Serbian forces in one area were supported by a rocket-firing helicopter . And the Serbs briefly captured two Czech soldiers attached_to a local U.N. peacekeeping force but released them after appeals by the United Nations .</TEXT>
