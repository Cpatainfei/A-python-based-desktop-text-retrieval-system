   <HEADLINE> POLAND ' S STRICT ABORTION LAW SURVIVES CHALLENGE ; EUROPE : LEGISLATORS FAIL TO OVERRIDE PRESIDENT WALESA ' S VETO OF BILL EASING LIMITS ON WOMEN ' S ACCESS TO THE PROCEDURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of Europe ' s strictest abortion laws survived a strenuous challenge Friday when Polish lawmakers failed to override a presidential veto of legislation that would have made abortions more readily available . The vote was a victory for President Lech Walesa , and it staved_off a high-stakes power struggle between the staunchly antiabortion president and the governing coalition , which is led by former Communists who favor easing abortion restrictions . Walesa , a devout Roman_Catholic and father of eight , had said he would not sign the legislation even if the Sejm , the lower house of Parliament , voted to override his veto . Under such a scenario , the president could have been called before a constitutional tribunal and forced to step_down . But the standoff was averted when the Sejm fell 42 votes short of the required two-thirds majority needed to override the veto , with 232 deputies voting against Walesa , 157 for him and 22 abstaining . &quot; The president welcomes the Parliament ' s acceptance of his argument that human life should be protected , &quot; said Walesa spokesman Leszek Spalinski . Abortion rights advocates said they would not give_up and pledged to push for a nationwide referendum . But because of that long process , the highly explosive subject effectively has been defused until next year , virtually assuring it a prominent role in the presidential election . &quot; We want to have a public vote on this , &quot; said Tomasz Nalecz , spokesman for the Union of Labor , whose parliamentary members voted against Walesa . &quot; Because the presidential veto must be overturned by a two-thirds majority , we are in a situation where decisions are being made by the minority. &quot; The abortion debate has fast become one of the most divisive issues in democratic Poland . More_than 90 % of the citizens identify themselves as Roman_Catholic , but polls show that a majority of citizens support liberalizing abortion rights . The church ' s strong antiabortion stance has created a backlash against its political and social moralizing and was viewed_as an important factor_in the election defeat last year of several right-wing parties that had pushed for the law now in place . The law , passed early last year with strong church backing , permits abortions only when a woman ' s health is threatened , when a prosecutor determines the pregnancy resulted from a crime or when the fetus is badly deformed . Only Ireland and Malta impose greater restrictions among European_countries , and Poland is the only former Eastern Bloc country to have reversed the easy availability of abortion under communism . At its peak , there were about 100 # 000 registered abortions a year in Poland and hundreds of thousands of unregistered ones . In the first year of the new law , there were fewer than 800 legal abortions , although there are no estimates on the number of women who turned_to the gynecological underground or went abroad to terminate pregnancies . &quot; We are not exactly sure how large the black_market is , but there is no doubt the number of abortions has dropped , &quot; said Pawel Wisicki of the Polish Federation of Movements for the Protection of Human Life . &quot; The present law has done a lot of good , and it would make no sense to change something that bore such good fruit. &quot; The legislation vetoed by Walesa was written by a group of women legislators from several left-wing parties who had fought unsuccessfully to block the restrictions last year . Their amendments would have eased criteria for abortion to include women experiencing financial difficulties or family hardship . &quot; This still would n ' t have given women freedom of choice , because someone else would have decided whether her situation was bad enough or not to warrant an abortion , &quot; said Wanda Nowicka , who heads the Federation for Women and Family_Planning , a Warsaw group that supports abortion rights . While the church attacked the proposed changes as too vague and far-reaching , critics of the existing law contended that it discriminates against the poor because wealthier women can go abroad or pay_for an illegal abortion in Poland . So-called abortion tours are advertised in Polish newspapers by foreign companies , and even Polish clinics advertise services using easily deciphered euphemisms . &quot; It is demoralizing to have laws that are meant to be broken , &quot; said Nalecz of the Union of Labor . The law does not punish a woman who has an illegal abortion but calls_for a two-year prison sentence for the doctor who performs it . Enforcement has been difficult , however , leading critics to charge that the law has done little more_than drive_up the cost of abortions and force doctors and patients to go underground . Of the 53 cases of alleged illegal abortions investigated in the law ' s first year , none resulted in a conviction . A report by the Justice Ministry concluded that the small number of cases could indicate that the new law has caused a huge drop_in the number of abortions or , more likely , that illegal abortions are simply not being reported to authorities .</TEXT>
