   <HEADLINE> PESO LOSES MORE VALUE AGAINST DOLLAR IN MEXICO ; CURRENCY : EXCHANGE_RATES FLUCTUATE WILDLY AT BORDER EXCHANGE HOUSES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Mexican_peso lost more value against the U.S. dollar on Mexico ' s currency markets Monday as jittery investors anticipated declining interest in Mexican securities and continuing political unrest in Chiapas . The peso slipped more_than 30 % against the dollar last week after the Mexican government decided to let its value float freely against the dollar . An extended period of volatility could be in_store as investors wait to see how strongly the Mexican government acts to control inflation and whether foreign investors regain confidence or flee the country , analysts said . On Monday , the peso slipped_in two-day futures contracts , closing at 5.1 pesos to the dollar , compared with 4.95 on Friday , a 3 % loss , said Carlos Escalante , an analyst at Vector-Mex brokerage in Mexico_City . Because U.S. markets and Wall_Street investment houses were closed Monday for the Christmas holiday , trading was light , sporadic and volatile . An analyst at Baring Securities in Mexico_City said trading today will more accurately reflect the peso ' s worth . The peso ' s value declined amid wildly fluctuating quotes Monday at several currency exchange houses at the U.S.-Mexico border in San Ysidro , ranging from 4.69 new pesos to nearly 5 to the dollar Monday afternoon . The rate &quot; is changing every five minutes , &quot; said an employee at Trolley Stop Money Exchange in San Ysidro . &quot; The market is extremely volatile , and my guess is that it will be this way for a_couple_of months &quot; said Enrique Kennedy , manager of Bancamex , owner of several exchange houses in San Ysidro . The Mexican stock_market index , meanwhile , closed_up 0.94 points , or 0.4 % , to close at 2 # 342.79 on Monday . Mexican stocks have risen in past days as the weak peso has pushed share prices higher . This is in part because investors figure that many Mexican companies will benefit from the devaluation as Mexican exports get cheaper and imports get more expensive , making Mexican goods more competitive at_home . Further fallout from the devaluation is expected this week as traders and government officials return from the Christmas holidays . An estimated $ 800 million of tesobonos , which are fixed-income securities denominated in dollars , will mature this week . Traders fear owners of the bonds won ' t roll_over their holdings and will seek instead to obtain dollars for the maturing securities , driving down the peso . * Reuters and Bloomberg Business News contributed to this report . * A STUNNED NEWCOMER President Zedillo ' s troubles mount .
