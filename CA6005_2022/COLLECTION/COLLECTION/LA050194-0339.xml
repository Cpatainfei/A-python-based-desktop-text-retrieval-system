   <HEADLINE> TOWN REVIVES AS REOPENED RIVER DRAWS ANGLERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bearing cash and spreading joy , anglers returned to this beleaguered town Saturday for the first time since a disastrous 1991 pesticide spill killed more_than 1 million fish and devastated the local economy . In a surprisingly rapid comeback , the Upper Sacramento River ecosystem has recovered well enough to support a population of native and hatchery trout , drawing anglers from all_over Northern California and giving motel owners the first chance in ages to use their &quot; No Vacancy &quot; signs . &quot; I love it . This is great , &quot; said Charles Davis , an unemployed tree pruner from Dunsmuir shortly before he caught three rainbow_trout . &quot; This is going_to help this town tremendously. &quot; Dunsmuir has struggled to survive since July , 1991 , when a Southern Pacific train derailed and dumped 19 # 000 gallons of the pesticide metam sodium into the river just north of town . The spill killed virtually everything in the river for 40 miles downstream and sent a cloud of toxic fumes through Dunsmuir that sickened some residents . Recently , a state study found that more environmental damage was sustained than thought -- including the discovery that many_more fish died than biologists first believed . Scientists also say three previously undiscovered species of small snail were rendered extinct by the spill . Although the railroad has agreed to pay $ 40 million to the state and $ 14.5 million to spill victims , many town residents remain embittered by the disaster . They worry that the poison may cause lingering health_problems . They fear that their businesses may_not survive . And they are angry over what they perceive as a lack of fair compensation from Southern Pacific . &quot; The last 2 1 / 2 years have been a very difficult period_of_time for community life in Dunsmuir , &quot; City_Manager Alan Harvey said . &quot; We are looking_forward to this season as a rebirth , a new beginning , a chance to enjoy what the Upper Sacramento can mean for the community. &quot; Although the river is still many years from complete recovery , the state_Department of Fish and Game concluded that reopening the waterway to limited fishing would not seriously hamper the continued revival of the ecosystem . On the first day of the season , most anglers headed to a six-mile stretch of river where about 2 # 000 hatchery trout had been planted earlier in the week . They were allowed to catch and keep_up to five fish a day -- planters or native rainbow_trout . Along the rest of the damaged river , anglers were permitted to fish for prized native trout , but were required to throw_back anything they caught . Anglers along the entire 40 miles of river were required to use barbless hooks to reduce the risk of injury to native fish that escaped or were released . Despite the restrictions , anglers who have long favored the area heralded the reopening of the river , which draws the casual fisherman because of the easy access and fly fishers because of the native trout . Local proprietors estimated that hundreds of fishers showed_up for the reopening Saturday . &quot; It will be wonderful for the town , &quot; said 74-year-old Ed Hiatt of Woodland , who has been coming here to fish since the 1920s . &quot; They practically died without the tourism. &quot; The Department of Fish and Game expects to plant about 27 # 000 hatchery fish in the river this season . Most of them are not as hardy as the native trout and will be caught by anglers or perish during the winter . The hatchery fish are unlikely to dilute the genetic stock of native trout . &quot; We are pleased that less than three years after the accident , things are getting_back much nearer to normal than they have been , &quot; Southern Pacific spokesman Mike Furtney said . The native trout appear to be making a strong comeback , as survivors have moved_in from tributary streams and the river above the spill site . Fish and Game biologists estimate there are now about 1 # 250 natives per mile and predict that will quadruple to 5 # 000 per mile in the next two years . Before the spill , biologists estimate that the river contained more_than 300 # 000 trout -- about 7 # 500 per mile -- along with more_than 750 # 000 riffle sculpin and other kinds of fish . Until the recent completion of a detailed fish count that included tallying frozen fish carcasses , officials had pegged the fish kill at hundreds of thousands . The scientists now say their estimate of more_than 1 million fish killed is conservative . The study also found that the spill took a heavy toll on terrestrial species , killing 30 % of the birds and mammals near the river , 4 # 000 giant_salamanders and hundreds of mature trees . The three species of snails discovered extinct were among 27 kinds of mollusks now known to have inhabited the river before the spill . &quot; There were three species previously unknown to science that were destroyed , &quot; said Fish and Game biologist Mark Stopher , who headed the damage assessment team . &quot; They don ' t even have names . We found them from the shells left in the river. &quot; Unlike the trout , species such_as mollusks , sculpin and crayfish are making a slow comeback largely because they are less mobile . Part of the settlement money may be spent to transplant these species from other rivers . Jerry Cantrell used to enjoy fishing in the river a_few blocks from his home , but now , at age 46 , he said he is totally disabled from exposure to the pesticide cloud . The former energy consultant said he also has lost much of his lung function , has had four operations to repair intestinal damage and cannot remain out of bed for more_than a_few hours a day . His son , Mark , 17 , also suffered lung damage from the fumes , he said . &quot; There are a lot of people very bitter about it , &quot; he said . The state_Department of Health Services conducted a door-to-door survey nine months after the spill and found that people exposed to the poison reported a higher incidence of mood changes , vision changes and diarrhea than people who were out of town at the time . But state medical experts said they could not determine whether the metam sodium has caused long-term health effects . The state is not attempting to monitor victims of the spill and has no record of how many people were affected or how many remain ill . &quot; For investigators to determine that a particular exposure in a complex environment is responsible is a very hard thing to do , &quot; said Rick Kreutzer of the Department of Health Services . It is easier , perhaps , to see the social effects of the disaster . Former Mayor Virginia Barham was recalled by the town ' s voters , along with two City_Council members , amid charges that they were insensitive to victims of the spill . The former city_manager , who had suggested that some residents were falsely claiming to be ill so they could collect from Southern Pacific , resigned after the recall . Now , many of the 3 # 000 people who filed claims against the railroad are concerned that the $ 14.5-million settlement will fall far short of paying_for their actual damages . Once attorneys ' fees and legal costs are deducted , the settlement works_out to about $ 3 # 000 a person . &quot; They paid the state more_than they paid us , which means the fish are worth more_than the community ' s health , &quot; said Cantrell , the ailing energy consultant . &quot; First we were victimized by Southern Pacific and now by the court system. &quot; * RELATED STORY : C4</TEXT>
