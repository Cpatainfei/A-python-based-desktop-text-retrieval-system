   <HEADLINE> ACURA TO BUILD NEW CAR IN U.S. ; JAPAN ' S AUTO SALES PLUNGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a pioneering move for a Japanese car_company , Honda Motor Co. ' s Acura division said Wednesday that it will build its next luxury car in the United States . Honda said the new model -- to premiere in 1996 -- will compete in the $ 23 # 000-to- $ 30 # 000 price segment of the luxury market , between its Acura Integra and Vigor models.The car will be built at Honda ' s East Liberty , Ohio , assembly_plant for_sale only in the United States and Canada . Richard Thomas , Acura executive_vice_president , said making the car in the United States &quot; makes excellent business sense. &quot; He cited the strong yen , which has made Japanese cars more expensive in the United States . The yen ' s surge has cut U.S. sales of Japanese imports , but Japanese domestic sales have also been off because of the country ' s lingering recession . The plight of Japanese manufacturers was underscored in a separate report Wednesday from the Japan Automobile Dealers Assn. , which showed domestic sales for 1993 down for the third year in a row and at the lowest level in six years . Domestic sales of cars , trucks and buses fell 8.4 % to 4.9 million vehicles , hitting the lowest level since the 1987 total of 4.3 million . The figures , which do not include &quot; mini-cars &quot; with engines smaller than 660 cubic_centimeters , reflect the severity of Japan ' s recession and the &quot; uncertainty consumers feel about the future , &quot; association spokesman Yoshio Kondo said . Domestic sales have plunged 18.2 % from the 1990 peak of 6 million vehicles , making this the industry ' s most extended downturn since the years immediately after World_War_II .</TEXT>
