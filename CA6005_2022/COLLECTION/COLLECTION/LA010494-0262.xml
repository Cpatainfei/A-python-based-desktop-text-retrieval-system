   <TEXT> GETTING IT ON PAPER : The passports have been printed in Switzerland , a gift of the_Swiss government . The drivers licenses and identity_cards are being done locally , green ink on white paper.And the new currency , the Palestinian pound , has already been designed . Yes , Palestinians are getting ready not only for autonomy this year under the agreement between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel but for the independent state they hope will follow on the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . &quot; What does_it take_to make a country ? &quot; joked Adnan abu Humeid , a West_Bank businessman . &quot; There are some states that are not much more_than a telephone code , a soccer team , an airline . . . . I ' m sure we ' ll have all that and more by July. &quot; The question that remains unresolved , largely because of its sensitivity , is whether PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat plans to put his own picture on the new Palestinian stamps .
