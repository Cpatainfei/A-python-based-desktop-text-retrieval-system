   <HEADLINE> NO MORE MR . MODERATE ; ONE PART OF WILSON IS A CONSENSUS-BUILDING PREPPY FROM YALE . THE OTHER IS A TOUGH-TALKING EX-MARINE . CALIFORNIA VOTERS CHOSE THE YALIE FOR GOVERNOR IN 1990 . NOW THE MARINE IS SEEKING A SECOND TERM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is nearly dark on a late winter afternoon , and Pete Wilson is out_to prove he is ready to rumble . California ' s chief_executive is concluding a two-day swing that has taken him through half the state he adopted more_than 35 years ago , a state that , despite electing him twice to the U.S. Senate and once to the governor ' s office , has never quite adopted him . Wilson , despised by his own party ' s true believers and merely tolerated by most of the rest of his constituents , is recharging his batteries for what he says will be his final campaign . On this tour he has stopped at a Fontana steel_mill , the Los Angeles County Central Jail and an Orange County police_station . He has partied with old friends in San Diego , talked business with Fresno employers and chatted on-line with future-minded voters in the Silicon_Valley . Now he is back in Sacramento to unveil his reelection campaign with a rally at a nightclub tucked into a newly renovated downtown shopping_mall . Lest anybody miss the message , he will deliver his speech from the center of a boxing ring . The room , decorated with blue and gold balloons and banners , is packed with Wilson supporters , many of them fresh from their jobs at the Capitol down the street . Even at day ' s end , their white shirts remain crisp -- like the enthusiasm they exude for their boss . They roar in approval when Wilson enters and strides toward the ring through an honor_guard of supporters ; as he passes , he slaps awkward high-fives at outstretched palms . Still clad in a dark suit and red tie more appropriate for the formal venues from which he has come , Wilson steps into the red , white and blue ring , shadow boxes for a moment , then grabs the microphone to address the faithful . With his wife , Gayle , standing beside him , the governor who rode into office four years ago as a different sort of Republican concerned about children , schools and the environment , who billed himself as a champion of women ' s rights , who openly courted the gay vote , delivers a speech to drive_home his latest theme -- that guiding the nation ' s largest state is not a job for the weak of heart . He sums_up his new message with these words : &quot; California , &quot; Wilson says , &quot; is not for sissies. &quot; This from a man who complains that the public misunderstands him . How could the public not ? Reinventing government may be all_the rage at the moment , but sometimes it seems as if Peter Barton Wilson has been reinventing himself throughout his 28 years in public office . Once the advocate of a &quot; no bust &quot; policy for marijuana possession , now he talks up zero tolerance for drug use . Despite having signed the biggest tax increase in state history , he portrays himself as a tight-fisted fiscal manager . And though he is a onetime Senate champion of cheap migrant labor for his friends in the farm lobby , he now blames immigrants for many of his state ' s mounting problems . The self-described compassionate conservative has become California ' s chief tough_guy . The transformation strikes some as hypocritical . Gentler analysts might see it as evidence of how the man split his political personality to react to changing times . One part of Wilson is a consensus-building , compromising preppy from Yale who understands the limits of ideology and knows how to cut a deal . The other is a tough-talking , power-craving ex-Marine . California voters were offered the Yalie for governor in 1990 , but watched him respond to the tempering force of the state ' s deepening recession with a public metamorphosis into a swaggering , take-no-prisoners autocrat . Now the Marine is seeking a second term . If Wilson wins , no one can be sure which side of him will govern the state -- if it can be governed -- for the next four years . By any conventional reasoning , Wilson has no business even being in this race , much less leading it , which is where some polls placed him as summer headed toward fall . Since he took_office , more_than half a_million Californians have lost their jobs . Those who still are working pay higher taxes , while the ones who depend_on government benefits have seen their stipends slashed . With the acquiescence of the Democratic Legislature , Wilson has raided state workers ' pension_funds , raised college fees by more_than half , grabbed local property_taxes and let school funding be eroded by inflation . He has run a string of budget_deficits unrivaled since the Depression , and it was his brinkmanship that forced the state to pay its bills with IOUs during a long budget stalemate in 1992 . A year later , Financial World magazine rated the state ' s management the worst in the nation . Wall_Street has downgraded the state ' s credit three times in three years , forcing taxpayers to pay higher interest on the government ' s burgeoning debt . While no major scandal has rocked the Wilson Administration , on his watch the Department of Motor_Vehicles spent millions on a new computer_system that does not work , and the state lottery was found to have used slipshod procedures in awarding a $ 600-million contract without competitive bidding . The California National_Guard , when called_upon to quell the Los Angeles riots , had to cool its heels for half a day because the soldiers were ready but the ammunition was not . It is no wonder that seven in 10 voters believe the state is headed_off down the &quot; wrong track. &quot; There has been enough misery in Wilson ' s 3 1 / 2 years as governor to bury most politicians . Yet this is no conventional pol . Since 1966 -- when Lyndon B . Johnson was in the White_House and student radicals were in the streets -- Wilson has succeeded like no other California leader by distilling and then reflecting back the heartfelt impulses of the state ' s voters . The vision he has articulated for his state may be a narrow one , but Wilson is unparalleled at reading the public ' s will , and his instincts are remarkably in sync with a majority of the electorate , still dominated by the aging white middle_class . From time to time he takes those impulses to extremes , and his poll ratings plummet . But he learns , refines the message and trudges on , for politics is his life . He has been a legislator , a mayor and a U.S. senator . Wilson , 61 , has been elected nine times to public office and lost just once -- an ill-fated bid for governor in 1978 . He doesn ' t mean to lose again . &quot; I am a real pain_in_the_ass , &quot; Wilson says when asked to describe the trait that serves him best as governor . &quot; I just stay with what I believe_in until I get_it done. &quot; Though Wilson claims no interest in national office , a comeback victory this year would put him on every pundit ' s A-list of Republican presidential prospects . Standing_in his way is Democrat Kathleen Brown , the state_treasurer and former Los Angeles school_board member . Luck has given him a popular opponent whose campaign has repeatedly stumbled , plagued by management difficulties and a lack of focus . And he ' s seized the opportunity her missteps have presented by hammering at a tough man ' s triad of issues : crime , immigration and welfare . His longtime campaign manager , George Gorton , conceded after scanning the polls earlier this year that Wilson would have a hard_time winning if the campaign were focused_on softer issues like education and the environment , issues on which voters believe the governor has performed poorly . But Gorton , recalling Democrat Dianne Feinstein ' s 1990 slogan ( &quot; tough but caring &quot; ) , says that in this mean season there is not even a need to make such a gesture of compassion . &quot; This is a year , &quot; Gorton said , &quot; for tough and tough. &quot; DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS HAD another agenda in mind when they welcomed Wilson to Sacramento four years ago with almost open arms . After eight years of George Deukmejian , who took great pride in saying &quot; No &quot; to legislative initiatives , most Democrats were happy to see a self-described activist grab the reins , even if he was a Republican . Wilson ' s first address to the Legislature , Assembly Speaker Willie Brown recalled , might just as well have been delivered by Feinstein . The liberal chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee , Democrat John Vasconcellos , was accused of helping write Wilson ' s inaugural_address , and he says he would have been proud had the assertion been correct . In those early speeches , Wilson denounced partisanship , called_for consensus and outlined his view that prevention -- in the form of expanded health and social programs for the poor -- was far more humane , and less costly to taxpayers , than remediation . Not only was Wilson saying the right things , as far as most Democrats were concerned , he also was stroking them personally , something most of them had rarely seen from a chief_executive . In his first days in office , the new governor invited lawmakers to a lavish Washington-style dinner that featured political comic Mark Russell , and in the weeks that followed , Wilson proved to be far more accessible than his predecessor . His chief_of_staff , Bob White , took_to playing racquetball weekly with the prickly Vasconcellos , a gesture that did not go unnoticed among Democrats weary of Deukmejian ' s taciturn ways . Yet there were hints of another side . Only days into his first term , Wilson and his wife toured a nursery ward for premature_babies at a Sacramento hospital , showing genuine concern as they chatted with the medical staff and peered at the preemies struggling for life behind glass . Afterward , the governor used the setting as a backdrop to make a pitch for expanding prenatal care_for poor working mothers . But to fund his new program , Wilson said , he would need to cut $ 61 from the monthly welfare grants for poor women with_children , whose stipend already was below the cost of housing in some metropolitan areas . &quot; I am convinced they will be able to pay the rent , &quot; Wilson said of the welfare mothers , &quot; but they will have less for a six-pack of beer . I don ' t begrudge them a six-pack of beer , but it is not an urgent necessity. &quot; Although the remark , which sounded rehearsed , stunned advocates for the poor , many of them shrugged it off as a bit of cheap demagoguery from an otherwise sensitive man . Liberals were willing to overlook such comments as long as Wilson was willing to raise taxes to avoid deeper cuts_in the state ' s threatened social_services . While he had never urged voters to read his lips along the lines of George_Bush ' s infamous pledge , Wilson did portray Feinstein as too eager to tax and had promised not to raise personal_income tax_rates . But faced with a $ 14-billion deficit in his first six months in office , Wilson and the Legislature raised the sales tax and expanded its reach , increased levies on alcohol , boosted motor_vehicle registration fees and , breaking his pledge , raised income_tax rates , though only on the state ' s wealthiest residents . The total tab came_to roughly $ 250 for every man , woman and child in the state , or $ 1 # 000 for a family of four . When Republicans in the Legislature balked , the governor said he would not stop at twisting arms to get the votes he needed . If necessary , Wilson said , he ' d break them . If he sounded like a fierce advocate for his position at the time , now Wilson says he raised taxes only with great reluctance , and only to win Democratic votes for an unprecedented reduction in welfare grants and a five-year freeze on the automatic cost-of-living increases that had been part of the welfare program since Ronald Reagan was governor . &quot; I hated it , &quot; Wilson says of the tax increase . But he adds : &quot; That was the only way I was going_to secure the agreement of the Democratic majority in both houses to the kind of spending_cuts that I knew we had to get if we were to have any remote hope of containing the hemorrhage. &quot; This kind of horse_trading , while often obscured by Wilson ' s pointed rhetoric , has characterized his Administration . &quot; He ' s an ex-legislator , &quot; notes state Sen . Patrick Johnston of Stockton , one of Wilson ' s Democratic admirers . &quot; He understands the mind-set of writing a bill that has to appeal_to a variety of people and having to figure_out what motivates legislators to vote. &quot; Wilson ' s conservative critics , of course , take a different view of his deal-making , particularly the grand compromise on taxes . They believe the rookie governor missed a historic opportunity to stand tough and reshape government . That episode early in his term , they say , exposed Wilson for what he is -- the ultimate pragmatist . &quot; He had a terrible budget situation and he chose the solution he could get , rather than the answer that was right , &quot; says economist Arthur Laffer , the former USC professor and supply-side theorist . Laffer ' s rather unconventional explanation for Wilson ' s economic_policy , or lack of one : the leadership training instilled by his alma_mater , Yale_University . Like the three Republican Presidents from that school -- William H . Taft , Gerald R . Ford and Bush -- Wilson lacks ideological moorings , Laffer argues . &quot; Yalies immerse themselves in the topic , &quot; says Laffer , a fourth-generation graduate of the New Haven , Conn. , institution . &quot; They learn the subject from the inside out . They put themselves in the other guy ' s shoes . The only thing they have to sacrifice is all their own personal values . They are like ships in the ocean with all_the equipment in the world -- but no compass. &quot; Such criticism might be easier for Wilson to stomach had his prescription cured the budget ' s ills . But , of course , neither the taxes nor the cuts stanched the fiscal bleeding , and the budget , along with California ' s economy , remained in the tank . The public soon turned irritable , and Wilson was their logical target . His public approval rating plunged in September , 1992 , to the lowest level ever recorded for a California governor : Just 19 % of the voters surveyed by the Field poll said he was doing a good job . As Wilson was absorbing these blows , he also was mourning the loss of a longtime friend and adviser , Otto Bos . The governor ' s eternally optimistic communications director had died_suddenly of a heart_attack in June of 1991 . Bos , an immigrant with humble roots who learned English as a teen-ager , was a decorated veteran of Vietnam who later protested the war while a student at San Francisco State . After covering Wilson as a reporter for the San Diego Union , Bos joined the then-mayor ' s staff in 1977 . He was , some said , the only man in Wilson ' s tight inner_circle who had ever changed a diaper . Although his job was to communicate Wilson ' s message to the public , Bos probably was more valuable for his ability to communicate the public ' s message to Wilson . His passing left a void that no one else close to the governor was able to fill . &quot; Otto just came at it from a different perspective than Pete did , &quot; says Gayle Wilson . &quot; Whether it was being an immigrant , or having been at San Francisco State in the ' 60s , he would see things differently from a man raised in St . Louis who went_to Yale and was in the Marine Corps. &quot; Assemblyman Vasconcellos still describes the first six months of Wilson ' s term as the &quot; period of enlightenment. &quot; He is not alone in citing Bos ' death as a turning point in Wilson ' s governorship . Education lobbyists , children ' s advocates and environmentalists all saw Bos as their bridge to Wilson . &quot; Otto was so public and so accessible and so buoyant , &quot; Vasconcellos says . &quot; When he was there in difficult times , Pete was magnanimous . Without him Pete has been mean . He has been in the hands of people so cynical and so dark and so hidden that it ' s been pretty horrible. &quot; Wilson is typically dismissive of such analysis , deriding it as &quot; pop psychology worth about what you paid_for it. &quot; The governor considers himself a rationalist to the core . To suggest that a personal loss -- even a huge one -- might color his decisions on policy is to insult him in the basest way . Ask him about emotions and more often than not Wilson responds with facts . Prod him , and he will acknowledge that he loved Bos like the younger brother he never had . But he insists that Bos , while a friendly sort , was no political pushover . &quot; Otto was a thoroughly decent , warm guy , &quot; Wilson says . &quot; But he was tough-minded . And I don ' t know that his decisions would have been very different from my own. &quot; Wilson , in fact , did not need Bos ' death to darken his world_view toward the end of his first year in office . The state he was elected to govern , after all , was crumbling around him . In a thin but jolting report from his Department of Finance , the governor learned that even if the economy recovered , serious demographic trends would keep budget_deficits piling_up for years to come . Welfare caseloads were growing , immigration was rising unabated , prison populations were soaring and school enrollment was climbing inexorably . Meanwhile , the number of people in their peak taxpaying years was shrinking relative to the population of older and younger , more dependent residents . While some of its more Malthusian projections turned_out to be exaggerated , this gloomy missive -- titled &quot; California ' s Taxpayer Squeeze &quot; -- confirmed for Wilson what he had already begun to sense : that the huge amount of political capital he had expended trying to balance his first budget represented no more_than a down_payment . WITH HIS STATE ' S FUTURE LOOKING GRIMMER , WILSON ' S TONE BECAME more severe toward the end of 1991 , and his Administration ' s policies took a noticeable lurch to the right . In an interview for a November , 1991 , Time magazine cover story about the decline of California , Wilson for the first time as governor cited the influx of illegal immigrants as a source of the state ' s problems . California ' s generous benefits also were luring the poor here from other states , he warned . &quot; There is a limit to what we can absorb , &quot; Wilson said , reflecting the frustration so many of his state ' s residents were feeling . A few weeks later , he unveiled a proposed ballot initiative that would have slashed welfare grants and shifted the balance of budget powers from the Legislature to the governor . For Wilson , the state ' s sorry plight -- and perhaps his own increasingly desperate political standing -- had crystallized thoughts he ' d long harbored about personal and parental responsibility . His strong feelings on parenting come despite not having had children of_his_own , though he did help rear the teen-age children of his two wives . When pressed_on a subject he almost never discusses in public , he jokes that his childless status is &quot; not for want of effort. &quot; &quot; I was hoping I was going_to be the father of my own , &quot; he says with disappointment , unwinding over beers in early June at a Century City hotel . &quot; That never happened . . . I think I missed a lot of fun . And also , I will concede , missed what I think is the heavy responsibility. &quot; But Wilson seems to have absorbed through the military many of the life experiences others pick_up rearing young children . A disciplined man himself , he admires that trait in others , going_back to when he first tasted executive life as a lieutenant leading a rifle company in the Marine Corps after the end of the Korean_War . &quot; When you really have to look_out for somebody else , when their well-being is in your hands and you have to make_sure they ' re fed before you ' re fed , that they are billeted before you are . . . that ' s the kind of responsibility I think has a maturing effect , &quot; he says . &quot; I saw guys who I thought were absolute lightweights , suddenly when they had the responsibility of running a platoon or running a company , become very different people. &quot; This theme , Wilson says , runs_through every major issue he has dealt with as governor . And you can see it in his actions . The governor , after all , was talking_about personal responsibility before Bill_Clinton made_it fashionable and even before Dan Quayle took_on the nation ' s most famous single mother -- television character Murphy Brown . When Wilson was confronted with his first chance to spare a man ' s life or send him to death , he sided with death . He denied clemency for two-time killer Robert Alton Harris even after acknowledging that Harris , the victim of monstrous abuse , suffered a childhood that was a &quot; living nightmare. &quot; Wilson sent to the gas_chamber a man who could have been a poster child for the governor ' s argument that prenatal care , early_childhood counseling and intervention in dysfunctional families are needed to prevent California kids from going_bad . He will concede that the killer ' s backers presented a solid case for clemency . But the governor , discussing the case in an after-hours interview in July , betrays no regrets about the decision . Like a Marine storming the beach , Wilson answers questions as if he fears that any sign of doubt could get him killed . &quot; I have , I think , a pretty strict standard , &quot; he says , recalling the Harris case . &quot; I don ' t think it is enough that you yourself have suffered abuse . You may very well have been brutalized . But if you are capable of discerning right from wrong , and capable of exercising a choice , an intelligent choice , and you choose to take a life , then I think you have forfeited your own. &quot; Wilson ' s view of the Los Angeles riots is similar . Though he has spoken eloquently on the problems of low self-esteem among the underclass , he had no interest in joining those who blamed the riots on widespread poverty and the sense of helplessness it can breed in its victims . &quot; I don ' t think you can ever condone violence , &quot; he says . &quot; that ' s just not acceptable . And it ' s not inevitable either . I mean look_at the Great Depression of the 1930s . If there ' s been a tougher economic time in this century for the people of this country than the current time or the time just passed , it was the ' 30s . What was the crime_rate then ? And what was the violent crime_rate ? Negligible . &quot; At that point we still had families , and we had people who were disciplined . And there was a code_of_conduct . You were raised to respect the rights of other people . You were raised to respect yourself , other family members . You didn ' t just do as you damn pleased and bash somebody because the mood was_on you. &quot; It was in those gloomy late spring days of 1992 , fresh from the execution and the riots , that Wilson turned his attention to the Legislature , and his approach was no less harsh . In a budget deadlock that accomplished little , the governor stared_down the Democrats for 63 days and forced the state to pay its bills with IOUs . Although widely viewed_as the victor in the confrontation , Wilson , to break the impasse , gave_up on deep cuts_in health and welfare programs and agreed to a disguised form of deficit_spending . And by making education funding the major issue , Wilson picked a fight with an opponent , the California Teachers Assn. , that was more_than his match . In the end , the schools got enough money to stay afloat in hard_times , and the teachers union got enough ammunition to paint Wilson as the anti-education governor . Democrats were more_than happy to let Wilson claim a tactical victory . They knew it would be Pyrrhic . But the governor wasn ' t through . With the November elections looming , he called the Legislature back into special_session to fix the fraud-ridden and inefficient worker ' s compensation system . He argued persuasively that the system was costing employers too_much while paying employees too_little : the middlemen , mostly doctors and lawyers , were eating_up the difference . But Wilson clearly wanted to use the issue as a wedge to drive voters away from Democrats in key legislative districts . When the special_session convened , the governor demanded that lawmakers pass his bill . Instead , they recessed after one day and went_home . A month later , Wilson suffered such a shellacking at the polls that Republicans began talking openly about dumping him as the party ' s nominee in 1994 . With his ally , President Bush , pulling_down the entire Republican ticket , Wilson lost big : voters rejected his ballot initiative to slash welfare grants , defeated his hand-picked successor for the U.S. Senate , and strengthened Democrat Willie Brown ' s grip on the state Assembly , which Wilson had hoped to put_in Republican hands . The results amounted to a stinging vote of no confidence that threatened to make him the state ' s first governor in half a century to be forced_out after just one term . FEW THINGS FRUSTRATE Pete Wilson more_than someone who disagrees_with him because they don ' t understand his argument . Supremely confident in the strength of_his_own reasoning , he usually concludes that anybody who opposes him must_not have heard , or comprehended , his point_of_view . This is a governor who watches legislative floor debates -- a usually meaningless theatrical exercise that occurs only after all_the votes have been decided in private -- on closed-circuit TV in his office and grows angry when his allies fail to present his position forcefully enough , as if doing so would change some minds . So when the voters rejected everything Wilson stood_for in the midterm elections , it was natural for him to discern that they did so because they were ignorant . Taking_stock after that electoral drubbing , Wilson resolved to redouble his efforts to educate the masses . &quot; People are deluged with information , most of which they ' re not seeking , and if it ' s a choice between what they would like to know and what I would like them to know , they ' re going to choose what they ' d like , &quot; Wilson said recently after a day of campaigning across Southern California . &quot; And it gets_worse , ironically , as we succeed in affording them greater range of viewing choice , a greater range of information sources . that ' s highly desirable in most respects . Except I ' m not sure people have really learned how to manage their time and whether they ' ve really learned how to manage gathering the information they need. &quot; Wilson once described the voters as &quot; intellectual shut-ins , &quot; and clearly he would like to help these poor souls gather the facts they need to judge him fairly . &quot; When the whole village had the same information from a handbill slapped up_on the side of the Pony_Express office , &quot; he says , &quot; for better or for worse , whatever the quality of the information , at least they all had the same information . Now we ' ve got channel surfing . And it ' s very difficult to develop a sense of community in a community that ' s channel surfing. &quot; To compete for attention with Roseanne , Seinfeld and MTV , Wilson concluded that he would need to focus_on a_few simple goals while relegating other issues to the back burner . He chose economic_growth , immigration , crime and welfare reform . Everything else that he earlier had advocated got short_shrift , including water and timber policy , growth management , low-cost housing , and yes , prevention programs . He made_peace with the Democrats who controlled the fate of his proposals in the Legislature , stopped battling the education establishment and developed an uneasy truce with the public employee unions . Illegal immigrants , criminals and Congress took the brunt of his firepower . In a sense , Wilson realized that the two personas that had failed him so badly in his first two years could , if combined , be his salvation . In 1991 , Wilson ' s penchant for cutting deals got him labeled weak . The following year he turned confrontational , only to find himself perceived as ineffective . But if pursued in tandem , these elements could produce everybody ' s ideal leader : tough yet reasonable . In Sacramento , he would once again engage in the kind of messy give-and-take that is central to building a record of accomplishment within the legislative process . But on the hustings , where his words would draw more attention than his deeds , Wilson could use his bully pulpit to the fullest and be more strident than ever . Much as his mentor , Richard M . Nixon , was remade for his 1968 run at the presidency , Wilson got a political make-over for his long trek back from public scorn . And like the &quot; New Nixon , &quot; the new Wilson was a lot like the old one . Only the packaging was different . When he cut the necessary bargains last year to enact the state ' s first on-time budget in seven years , he found the political press , and the public , more enamored with his punctuality than concerned about his product . The governor then compromised on worker ' s compensation reform , accepting a package that he might have won a year earlier had he negotiated with lawmakers rather than browbeat them . He OK ' d business tax_breaks that , while dwarfed by tax increases he had signed , were hailed as a signal that California was serious about keeping jobs in the state . And he began to win passage of some of the same welfare reforms that lawmakers and the voters had rejected the year before . With just enough progress under his belt to declare an end to gridlock , Wilson hit the road to sell himself as the comeback kid . Having concluded rightly that television_news crews would not come_to the Capitol to cover him , he went and offered himself to them . No plant opening was too small for this governor , no ribbon-cutting too inconsequential . The man who preached personal responsibility was taking none for the state ' s economic woes , blaming most of the mess on someone else . With a Democrat now in the White_House , Wilson toured the state , and the country , bashing the federal_government at every opportunity -- for cutting the defense budget , for closing military bases , for declaring California critters endangered while ignoring the state ' s economic needs , and , especially , for failing to control the borders . On immigration alone , Wilson became a perpetual motion machine , traveling_to El Paso , Tex. , to draw attention to a border crackdown he says shows that the federal_government could do more to stop illegal immigration in California ; filing lawsuits seeking reimbursement from Congress for the state ' s cost of educating , jailing and providing emergency health_care to illegal immigrants ; touring hospitals and police_stations to discuss the effects of illegal immigration ; appearing at the border again to question President Clinton ' s decision to send troops to stop the Cuban boat people while doing little , in the governor ' s view , to help California . All this leaf-beating has had only a marginal effect on public policy , but a huge impact on how the public views Wilson : A wide range of voters see him as a fighter on the right side of the immigration issue . Wilson also helped his image with his response to two Southern California disasters : the fires that stretched from Thousand Oaks to Laguna Beach , and the Northridge earthquake . Aboard a plane for Los Angeles only hours after the Jan . 17 quake jolted the region , the governor spent most of the following two weeks in the city , viewing damage , meeting with everyone from the President to local City_Council members , and convening his Cabinet for a rare session outside the Capitol . He signed a wave of executive orders to cut regulations and laid the groundwork for a rapid government response to the disaster , including the early reopening of two Los Angeles freeways that collapsed . At times like this , Wilson was more chief_executive than chief comforter . At a shelter in Glendale , he walked briskly without pausing past rows of cots filled with the newly homeless so he could keep a date with local officials and the National_Guard . At a downed freeway bridge , he spoke at length with Caltrans engineers about the damage before offering little hope to citizens pressing against the police lines . &quot; There is a symbolic value to being here , &quot; Wilson said between briefings , &quot; to make clear to people , whether they be Caltrans workers or National_Guard or CHP , that you really value what they ' re doing. &quot; But what of the victims ? &quot; You can ' t say very much to the parents of a child who has been killed or the children of the parent . It ' s pretty difficult to comfort people who have lost their homes and their life ' s belongings. &quot; AFTER ALMOST THREE DECades in public office , Pete Wilson knows that politicians and sporting events rarely mix well . So it was with some trepidation , but a sense of gubernatorial duty , that he took a break from budget deliberations on a Saturday in June to welcome the World Cup soccer tournament to California . The Rose Bowl was filled with 90 # 000-plus fans , a huge number of them Latinos there to cheer on Colombia in its game against the Romanian national team . As Wilson walked to the center of the field , the booing and hissing began . The chorus soon rose to a crescendo , drowning_out his short speech . As he left the field , the governor waved to the crowd , and many returned his friendly gesture with an obscene one of_their_own . The rude reception , naturally , was a reflection of the Latino community ' s irritation with Wilson ' s heated rhetoric on the issue of illegal immigration . The governor says he expected some hostility , and he dismisses its importance by suggesting that maybe 10 people in the vast audience were registered to vote . But talking to him , you can ' t help but think he ' d like to meet with those 10 voters and try to win them over . &quot; It ' s a very sad thing when a lot of people who are perfectly decent people are misled , have been deceived , and entertain a false notion , &quot; he says when asked if the animosity bothered him . &quot; I think people are laboring under a misapprehension when they believe a big lie and think that the chief_executive of their state is somehow a racist or anti-Latino . The sad thing about that is that it ' s untrue and it ' s ugly . And yeah , that bothered me. &quot; Yet Wilson is the one who helped turn illegal immigration into an &quot; us against them &quot; proposition . From his campaign commercial showing hordes of Latinos swarming across the border while the narrator intones &quot; They keep coming , &quot; to his full-page advertisements in the New York Times , Wilson has been nothing short of shrill . Exaggerating for effect his positions on health_care and education for illegal immigrants , he gives the impression that he wants these services curtailed when he really is advocating instead that the federal_government pay the tab . His commercial might just as easily have shown an excerpt of a Wilson speech in which he says illegal immigrants most hurt recent legal immigrants who have played by the rules . But Wilson says that kind of message is too complicated to convey in a 30-second spot . Others say these are thoughts the governor would just as soon not get_across . &quot; He ' s got_to have an enemy , &quot; says state Sen . David A . Roberti , the former Senate leader . &quot; I don ' t like that , but maybe that ' s how you win in California . that ' s how Republicans have traditionally won . . . . Fortunately for Gov . Wilson , he ' s got some very visible enemies who upset the public -- immigrants , welfare recipients being the old standbys , and criminals for_sure -- that he can gravitate to. &quot; For most of Wilson ' s term , the Democrats who control the Legislature checked the governor ' s impulses , rejecting or watering_down his most extreme proposals on welfare , immigration , education and crime . Wilson , in fact , appeared comfortable with the relationship , which allowed him to portray himself as tougher than thou , blame the Democrats for blocking change and ultimately enact proposals in_line with the centrist leanings that have characterized his career . Then came Polly Klaas . Kidnaped from a slumber_party in her Petaluma home last year , and later found murdered , the 12-year-old girl became a vehicle for a state ' s fear of random crime , especially after an ex-convict confessed to the crime . The long search for Polly ' s body galvanized the public ' s anger and focused attention on the Legislature ' s failure to pass many of the anti-crime measures Wilson had long advocated . Wilson immediately endorsed the &quot; three strikes &quot; sentencing measure , which requires prison_terms of 25 years to life for two-time losers convicted of a third felony . When some prosecutors and judges fretted that the measure was so broad it would clog the courts and fill the prisons with aging , nonviolent criminals , many in the Legislature expected Wilson to follow his usual pattern and agree to a compromise . Like Nixon going_to China or Reagan cutting an arms deal with the Soviet_Union , Wilson , insulated by his immense store of credibility on the crime issue , could have taken a stand against the biggest crime bill of them all . Instead , he insisted that the bill be passed into law exactly as written by its sponsor , Fresno photographer Mike Reynolds , whose daughter was murdered two years ago by a repeat felon . Less than a year after failing to advance past its first committee test , the bill sailed_through on landslide votes_in both houses of the Legislature . Wilson signed the historic legislation on a rain-swept March morning in the parking_lot of the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s Hollywood division , chosen because it had one of the city ' s highest rates of violent crime a year ago . With television_cameras whirring , Wilson sat at a simple metal desk surrounded by uniformed cops , the leaders of several victims ' groups and a handful of politicians . &quot; We ' re going to start turning career criminals , &quot; he said , &quot; into career inmates. &quot; The governor ' s signature on the three-strikes bills spoke more about his vision than volumes of speeches on the power of prevention ever could . The new law is expected to produce a prison-building boom that will dwarf the past decade ' s explosion , which already has made California home to one of the world ' s largest penal colonies . The bill , according to Wilson ' s Corrections Department , will force the state to build an additional 20 prisons in the next six years -- at a time when the University of California and the California State University systems will be lucky to add one new campus each . The $ 2-billion annual cost of operating the new prisons -- at more_than $ 21 # 000 per inmate -- is roughly seven times the amount Wilson will spend this year on his entire agenda of prevention programs . To lead is to choose , Wilson said in that first address to the Legislature , when he urged lawmakers to invest in programs that would prevent human failure rather than warehouse it . Now he asserts -- with significant public backing -- that the best prevention that money can buy is to lock_up the thugs before they steal again . Wilson acknowledges that every dollar he spends on prisons is a dollar he does not have for the kind of schools , drug treatment or job training that he has said can reduce crime over the long_haul . He says he regrets that the state cannot do more to help children born to abusive parents . But that compassion so_much on display four years ago has faded , overtaken , at least for now , by the cold reality of limited dollars and the voters ' priorities , at least as he sees them . Wilson ' s predecessors -- his opponent ' s father among them -- built legacies of universities , parks and college campuses , but this governor describes his prisons as an investment in California ' s future . &quot; You can ' t have people living_in fear , &quot; he says , &quot; and still have what I call a civilized society. &quot; While others may judge a society by the quality of its schools or the way it treats its poor , Wilson has subordinated those standards to something more fundamental -- a message that can be articulated clearly , and toughly , in a 30-second commercial , today ' s equivalent of those 19th-Century handbills .</TEXT>
