   <HEADLINE> THE PRICE OF BACKING AWAY ; TRADING : NASDAQ MARKET MAKERS OFTEN DON ' T HONOR THE PRICES THEY DISPLAY . COMPLAINTS ABOUND , BUT NASD SAYS MOST ARE FRIVOLOUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On trading desks across the country , the video screens of Nasdaq computer terminals glow with stock_symbols and price quotes , displaying the list of market makers who deal in each stock and the prices at which they stand ready to buy or sell shares . Federal regulation -- what ' s known as the &quot; firm quote rule &quot; -- requires market makers to honor the prices they display . But Nasdaq market makers often do not . Through Oct . 4 , traders had filed 4 # 748 complaints this year alleging Nasdaq market makers &quot; backed_away &quot; from their obligation to trade at posted prices . Over several months , a reporter visiting various trading desks witnessed more_than two_dozen instances in which market makers at least appeared to renege_on this duty . Backing_away leaves small investors to buy_at higher prices or sell shares for less than the posted quotes . And interviews with traders and officials of the National Assn . of Securities Dealers , which operates Nasdaq , as well as examination of scores of formal backing-away complaints , strongly suggest that the NASD is doing little to stop the practice . While James M . Cangiano , the NASD ' s executive_vice_president for market surveillance , insists the group takes backing-away complaints &quot; very , very seriously , &quot; the NASD confirms that it has taken no public action in response to any of the complaints filed this year . Indeed , firms accused of backing_away -- and the NASD itself -- contend that the vast majority of complaints are frivolous . NASD officials deny that backing_away is widespread and note that most complaints are filed by a group of small , maverick market makers who , they contend , are simply out_to harass the big , established market-making firms . Selling at posted prices would seem to be a fundamental element of a stock_market ' s operations . But just as Nasdaq ' s fragmented trading system often fails to make the market ' s best prices available to small investors , backing_away means investors often aren ' t getting the market makers ' quoted prices , either . &quot; It ' s like you go_into a store and this has a $ 3 price_tag on it , &quot; said Phillip A . Dina of Dina Securities in Wayne , N.J. , picking_up a tape dispenser from his desk to make the point . &quot; What would you do if you walked up_to the counter with it and the lady said , ' Oh , no , it ' s now $ 3.25 ' ? that ' s what happens on Nasdaq all_the time. &quot; Veteran traders say backing_away occurs because , with little risk of serious penalty , it enables market makers to pick and choose who they want to trade with . It also lets them concentrate_on making money by buying and selling for their firms ' own accounts , rather than honoring their obligation to trade with all comers . Though the larger Nasdaq stocks -- such_as Apple Computer , Microsoft and MCI -- have many market makers , few of the dealers are really interested in trading actively at any given moment , market professionals say . Most &quot; are just interested in trading their own accounts , &quot; said Robert M . Gintel , chairman of the Gintel Group of mutual_funds . The dealers post quotes because Nasdaq rules require them to do so . But , said Gintel , &quot; out of 20 market makers for a stock , maybe two are really interested in trading at any given time. &quot; The rest , he said , &quot; will scurry like rabbits to get_out of the way &quot; of unsolicited trades , swiftly changing their quotes if an unwanted order comes_in on which they cannot be sure of making a profit . * On Oct . 13 , while a reporter was present on the trading floor of a New York market maker in Nasdaq stocks , a trader -- on instructions from an individual investor -- tried to sell 500 shares of Intuit Inc. This was hours before Microsoft Corp . announced its bid to buy Intuit , and the software firm ' s stock had been bouncing around in anticipation . The trader offered to sell the shares to Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. , the giant Wall_Street investment bank , which is also a major Nasdaq market maker . At that moment , Morgan Stanley had_the_best posted &quot; bid &quot; price for Intuit , offering to pay $ 49.25. Morgan declined to fill the order . But for at least 12 minutes after , the firm continued to post the $ 49.25 price , seemingly indicating that it was ready to take any legitimate offer at that price , as the firm-quote rule requires . Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Tracy Gordon declined to comment on the incident . Though no formal complaint was filed_in this case , Morgan Stanley has been the target of scores of formal backing-away complaints over the last 12 months . The firm says all_the complaints are unfounded . On the same morning , a reporter watched as another trader attempted to buy 1 # 000 shares of Apple stock from Prudential Securities at Prudential ' s posted asking price of $ 42.375. Prudential never responded to the computerized purchase offer , the trader said . She was forced to wait and try again with another firm , ultimately paying $ 42.75 per share , or a total of $ 375 more_than if she had gotten the original price . The trader said the same thing happened to her at least six times that day , on orders involving several stocks and market makers . Prudential spokesman Charles Perkins said he could not find_out what happened in the Apple trade without more information . In general , he said , &quot; every firm is dealing with thousands of orders every day . The system recognizes that some trades may get lost on occasion. &quot; In this case , he noted , the trader did not file a complaint . * Some traders say backing_away allows_for preservation of what they refer to as &quot; the club , &quot; an inside group of market makers who maintain wide spreads -- the gap between the &quot; bid &quot; and &quot; asked &quot; prices that gives market makers their profit . By backing_away , critics say , these firms are able to trade primarily with other market makers they know , while refusing to honor their quoted prices for the customers of other firms with which they have no cozy rapport . Meanwhile , small investors ' orders sit unfilled for precious minutes , often while prices move to their disadvantage . &quot; It all has to do with whether or not you ' re in the club , &quot; said Arthur W . Goldsmith , chief_executive of A.J. Michaels &amp; Co. , a market maker and trading firm on Long_Island that has filed many backing-away complaints . &quot; If you ' re not , they never take your order. &quot; NASD officials call baseless the allegations that Nasdaq practices are anything but extremely competitive . Nasdaq &quot; is stringently overseen by both the ( Securities and Exchange Commission ) and the NASD , and neither we nor the SEC have ever found anti-competitive practices to exist in our market , &quot; NASD President Joseph R . Hardiman said in a memo written Thursday to market makers . Still , Goldsmith spoke_of the panicked frustration some traders feel when they are trying to sell stock for a customer . They send orders , one after another , to the market makers displaying the best quotes . Then they wait , usually several minutes between each attempt . In all , it can take 10 minutes or longer to execute a trade -- during which time the price of the stock may move drastically . &quot; It ' s like you ' re holding a stock and there ' s no exit , &quot; Goldsmith said . On the New York Stock_Exchange , by contrast , trading of each stock is centralized in the hands of a single &quot; specialist &quot; firm . The specialist is obliged to see that all orders to buy or sell at the prevailing market_price get filled . So backing_away does not exist on the NYSE . The NASD attributes the upsurge in backing-away complaints to a protest by a small group of market makers angry that the NASD cut_into their living in January by sharply limiting Nasdaq ' s small-order execution system ( known as SOES ) , which had been the basis for these firms ' profits . The NASD says the firms abused SOES , unfairly using it to take_advantage of big market makers who were not fast enough in updating their prices . * Indeed , a prodigious 85 % of the complaints through late June were filed by a single small firm that heavily used SOES , Datek Securities of Staten Island , N.Y. , the NASD says . These small firms , in turn , allege that the NASD is ignoring abuses by big market makers who routinely violate the firm-quote rule . When the NASD scaled back the small-order system , the firms said , they turned_to using Nasdaq ' s mainstream trading system , known as SelectNet . But , they said , they have discovered that they frequently cannot get their orders filled . The reason , they allege , is that the bigger market makers won ' t honor their posted prices . Executives at the complaining firms contend that the NASD does little or nothing to investigate . &quot; We have hundreds of backing-away complaints we ' ve filed , but it becomes a futile effort , &quot; said Michael F . Frey , president of A.J. Michaels . &quot; Nothing ever happens. &quot; But it is not just the former SOES traders who are complaining . For example , Keith Balter , head of Nasdaq trading at Weeden &amp; Co . -- and a vocal critic of the SOES traders -- said he too has filed backing-away complaints when he believed fellow market makers failed to honor quotes . In each case , he said , the NASD seemed to do nothing . &quot; We just don ' t hear anything , &quot; Balter said . Judging by its public statements , the NASD -- which has the power to impose large fines and suspend market makers -- means to sternly enforce its regulations against backing_away . &quot; The activity of backing_away really goes_to the heart of our business , &quot; said Cangiano , the NASD surveillance chief . &quot; If you get somebody who reneges and is not fulfilling the obligations of a market maker , then obviously there are serious implications for the marketplace. &quot; As of Oct . 4 , out of the 4 # 748 complaints filed this year , the NASD said it had disposed_of 4 # 257 . Aside from the four fines , the only other action taken was to send 81 private warning letters , Cangiano said . Cangiano said it took only the mildest action because it was persuaded that all_of the cases were unintentional . Without evidence of repeated violations by a trader , he said , the NASD is likely to accept the explanation that the trader inadvertently missed seeing an order pop_up on the computer_screen . &quot; we ' ll let you go , &quot; he said . &quot; We realize everybody is busy , and messages scroll off the workstation &quot; without being seen , Cangiano said . * Traders say the SelectNet computer_system indeed is flawed , making_it easy for traders who are not paying_attention to miss orders . But Linda Lerner , general counsel for Domestic Securities , a Suffern , N.Y. , firm that has filed reams of backing-away complaints , said the NASD is simply too willing to believe market makers ' claims that unexecuted trades are accidental . Brandon Becker , head of market regulation for the SEC , the federal agency that oversees the nation ' s stock_markets , declined to comment on the NASD ' s handling of the complaints . Copies of backing-away complaints obtained by The Times allege a litany of abuses , including foul language ( a violation of NASD rules ) , telephones slammed down , traders refusing to give their names ( also a violation ) , and lies by traders who claimed they had fulfilled their obligation to trade at quoted prices by trading with someone else first . Domestic Securities ' parent firm , All-Tech Investment Group Inc. , filed more_than 20 complaints against Morgan Stanley in the first six months of this year . In one , All-Tech charged that on March 23 , it signaled via SelectNet that it wanted to sell 500 shares of Tele-Communications Inc. at Morgan Stanley ' s posted bid_price of $ 23.50. All-Tech alleged that Morgan Stanley simply ignored the order . &quot; We called after a minute of waiting ( for a reply via computer ) and they hung_up on us , &quot; says the complaint , signed by All-Tech principal Mark Shefts . &quot; We called a second time ; the trader refused to give his name but stated : ' Take it up with our legal department . Don ' t bother us. ' They also claimed that there was a market maker ahead of us. &quot; But according to the complaint , Morgan Stanley did not change its quotes for another minute -- an indication that the firm was still willing to buy TCI stock at $ 23.50 , regardless of any earlier trade . Florence A . Davis , Morgan Stanley ' s director of compliance , said her staff had investigated the allegations in this and all_the other complaints and come_up with solid proof that Morgan Stanley had fulfilled its obligation to trade at its posted prices . &quot; We ' re not scofflaws at Morgan Stanley , &quot; she said . &quot; The documentary evidence is so black-and-white. &quot; But Davis declined repeated requests by The Times to see the evidence , saying the complaints had been thoroughly reviewed by the NASD . * Series Reprints : A compilation of this six-part series on Nasdaq will be available from Times on Demand upon completion of the series ' publication next week .
