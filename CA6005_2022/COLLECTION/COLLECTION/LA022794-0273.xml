   <HEADLINE> INVENTOR ZAPPING OIL SPILLS WITH DRY_ICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It all started with the Huntington Beach oil spill in 1990 , when Tim Beck stood on the beach watching a black tide of crude_oil heading into shore . &quot; It just kept getting closer and closer ( to the beach ) ) , and nobody showed_up to save the day , &quot; says Beck , 45 , a Manhattan Beach inventor and , to make ends meet , an El Segundo substitute science_teacher . &quot; I started thinking there had to be some way to stop an oil spill. &quot; Then it came_to him . Why not use massive heat extraction ? In other words , why not freeze the oil ? Turn the liquid oil spill into a frozen oil spill -- an &quot; oilberg &quot; as Beck calls it . Then you could simply pluck the chunks of oil right off the water . Beck ' s first idea for freezing oil spills was to use liquid_nitrogen , which at nearly minus 300 degrees Fahrenheit is plenty cold enough to freeze oil or almost anything else . Only problem was , it ' s so cold that it might also freeze the oil-spill workers along with the oil . He had to scratch that idea . Then Beck thought_about using frozen carbon_dioxide -- that is , dry_ice -- as the heat extraction agent . The only problem was that oil experts said dry_ice , at minus 109 degrees Fahrenheit , isn ' t cold enough to freeze crude_oil . Beck discovered that it was indeed cold enough , once the gases contained in crude_oil dissipated into the air . Finally Beck found a company in Rancho Cucamonga , Alpheus Cleaning Technologies , that manufactures dry_ice pellets for &quot; ice blasting , &quot; which is like sandblasting except that dry_ice is used . For about 15 cents a pound , the company sells dry_ice pellets about an eighth of an inch long and about the thickness of spaghetti -- small enough to float , big enough to freeze oil . Beck started taking his idea to oil_companies , seeking financing to continue the experiments . But he had a hard_time finding backers . Eventually , though , Beck says he found an oil_company that put about $ 50 # 000 into his research program . He put another $ 20 # 000 of_his_own money into it . The results were encouraging , Beck says . During one experiment he managed to create a 500-pound &quot; oilberg , &quot; demonstrating the feasibility of the process on bigger-than-a-mud puddle spills .</TEXT>
