   <HEADLINE> FAITH OR FAD ? ; ENERGIZE THE FERVENT BELIEFS OF SOME CHRISTIANS WITH TECHNIQUES FROM THE NEW AGE HUMAN POTENTIAL MOVEMENT . THE RESULT ? MOMENTUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For four days , they blurt_out secrets , slug pillows while yelling &quot; Mama , Mama , Mama , &quot; and pretend to be aboard a sinking cruise_ship that has only one life_raft . They also pray , listen to music from &quot; Beverly Hills , 90210 &quot; and -- occasionally -- claim to hear whisperings from God . By the time it ' s over , many say that they ' ve never felt closer to Jesus or to other people , and that their lives have dramatically changed . The program is called Momentus , a $ 500 jump-start for the spirit that is raising eyebrows among charismatic and evangelical Christians in Orange and Los Angeles counties , Northern California , Texas and Hawaii . Started in a church gymnasium , Momentus is an unusual mix of conservative Christianity and rough-and-tumble psychological techniques . In it , people confess sins , wrestle with past hurts and role play in an attempt to better understand themselves and their relationship to God . So far , the seminar has won praise from a former co-host of Pat Robertson ' s &quot; 700 Club &quot; TV_show , dozens of pastors , a Nicaraguan contra general and the man who ran the Border_Patrol ' s western headquarters under President Ronald Reagan . But it also has split one church , created a stir at others and come under question for its confrontational approach . Momentusites acknowledge the program is rigorous -- even humiliating at times -- but say it needs to be to shake Christians from their complacency . &quot; Jesus , &quot; explains founder Dan Tocchini , &quot; is not Mr. Rogers. &quot; Tocchini , 38 , is the lightning_rod for Momentus ' detractors . A former altar_boy who later sold movie_theaters , he says he was &quot; born again &quot; 15 years ago in his sister ' s living room . From there -- and this is what disturbs his critics -- he went_to work for Lifespring , a controversial self-improvement seminar similar to est . To a number of Christians , Lifespring ' s New Age philosophy and methods -- which borrow from Eastern religions , existentialism and encounter-group psychology -- are not only at_odds with biblical teachings , but potentially dangerous . Although most of Lifespring ' s 500 # 000 customers have enjoyed the seminars , the company has been sued more_than 40 times for allegedly causing psychological injury or death -- charges it denies -- and its insurers have reportedly paid millions in settlements . Tocchini , however , was intrigued with the idea of converting Lifespring ' s techniques to Christian ends . When his Pentecostal sister prophesied that &quot; God would do a mighty work &quot; with him at Lifespring , he signed_on . &quot; In Catholic_schools , I learned a lot about the Bible and Jesus_Christ , &quot; he says . &quot; But knowing truth is very different from being true . . . . In Lifespring , I saw that people were able to take_on principles and use them like second nature in a short period_of_time . I wanted to learn how to ( use the same teaching_methods ) to make biblical principles more ( real ) in people ' s lives. &quot; In 1990 , two years after quitting Lifespring , he was ready . At that time , he was involved in a home Bible study group at an Episcopal church in Petaluma , Calif. , and &quot; there was a buzz about our ( meetings ) in the congregation at_large . . . . I ( had developed a skill for ) honing in on what people were concealing and the concerns of their hearts. &quot; When the priest asked him to create a spiritual-growth program for the entire parish , Tocchini came_up with Momentus . It had no name and lasted just two days , but the effect was electric . &quot; People came_out and were really excited about doing things , &quot; Tocchini recalls . &quot; And that got the priest kinda jumpy . He said , ' You ' ve gotta put the reins on these people , ' and I replied , ' I don ' t have any. ' &quot; The jumpiness continued after Momentus moved to Santa Rosa , Calif . At first , the reviews were glowing . Broken marriages were healed , non-Christians accepted Jesus into their hearts , believers found new fervor for the Lord . But soon , a vague uneasiness crept_in . There were questions about the &quot; living mirror &quot; exercise , the odd lingo spoken by seminar graduates and the &quot; peepee-to-peepee &quot; hugs . It sounded to skeptics like Lifespring in sheep ' s clothing . ( Lifespring officials say their program has no association with Momentus . &quot; Only Lifespring is Lifespring , &quot; says company president Jeffrey L . Cosby . &quot; We ' ve assumed that what ( Tocchini ) is doing is quite different. &quot; ) &quot; The debate isn ' t over the purpose of ( Momentus ) , which is to get people to make_full commitments to Christ , &quot; says John Strong , an evangelical Santa Rosa pastor who cautiously endorses the seminar . &quot; The issue is the tools being used. &quot; The underlying argument boils_down to this : Is it possible to Christianize the psychological methods of human-potential groups , or are they inherently &quot; man-centered &quot; and anti-God ? The most controversial of those methods -- one that has been used by Lifespring and adapted by Momentus -- is the living mirror , an exercise in which individuals stand_in front of other people at the seminar and listen to what those people think_of them . &quot; People who don ' t know you from Adam are giving you a rundown on what they think you are , and some of it is just really uncalled for , &quot; says Wayne Coombs , a Palos Verdes minister who otherwise loves Momentus . &quot; It ' s said with a real sense of unkindness ( and ) for me , there was some damage. &quot; Likewise , a Los Angeles woman , who asked not to be named , says the &quot; harshness and verbal abuse &quot; left her depressed for two months : &quot; Christians are supposed to reach_out in_love and be gentle . . . ( but ) this just ripped me apart. &quot; Tocchini refunded her money . But many others describe the exercise as illuminating . &quot; I ' d been wearing this mask of always smiling and being the life of the party , &quot; says Lynn Thompson of San Jose . &quot; I got found_out . It forced me to take_a_look at myself . . . . I realized I wasn ' t allowing people to know me . . . . Some of the stuff went_back to when I was a kid. &quot; Another image problem for Momentus involves Tocchini ' s apparent inability to put his message into conversational English . People come_out of the seminars spouting such phrases as &quot; showing_up , &quot; &quot; where do you stand &quot; and &quot; who we are will show_up in how we engage with others regarding the commitments that define our relationship. &quot; Says Strong : &quot; It gets ( outsiders ) riled up. &quot; Recently , Tocchini has begun replacing some of the psychobabble with weird constitutional language . He talks_about &quot; governing the capitol that you are &quot; through your personal legislative , executive and judicial_branches , and says that getting &quot; aligned with our God-designed identity . . . ( enables us to ) enjoy the privileges and benefits of a constitutional republic. &quot; Other factors that put_off non-Momentusites include the relentless pressure many graduates use to recruit them into future seminars , the secrecy surrounding Momentus ( participants sign agreements not to reveal seminar contents , a rule Lifespring recently dropped ) , and the infamous , but now discarded , peepee-to-peepee embrace -- a fully clothed , pelvis-to-pelvis body hug that has also been used by Lifespring . &quot; Can you imagine the apostle_Paul . . . writing to the saints , encouraging them to hug one another penis to vagina ? &quot; one minister asks . A few have also been irked by the perceived elitism of Momentus graduates . &quot; The attitude seemed to be that anyone who had doubts or questions about Momentus would be fine if you just got him through the ( seminar ) , &quot; says Charles Berlin , an early Santa Rosa supporter who later changed his mind . &quot; But Jesus never said , ' You have to do the seminar. ' &quot; * Not surprisingly , tension soon swept Santa Rosa ' s evangelical and charismatic Christian community , the primary target for Momentus ' word-of-mouth advertising . At Tocchini ' s home church , a quarter of the 800-member charismatic congregation left when pastor J.R. Young refused to condemn the seminar . Several conservative Sonoma County preachers began branding Momentus satanic . And the Santa Rosa Press Democrat ran a front-page story describing the uproar . &quot; In all my life , I ' ve never seen people as energized as the ones from those early seminars , &quot; says Dennis Peacocke , a Santa Rosa Bible teacher and author who initially endorsed Momentus , then switched sides and led the revolt at Tocchini ' s church . &quot; But it took_over the energy of the church . It sucked everything into its orbit. &quot; Tocchini says the ensuing controversy was &quot; like a witch hunt. &quot; Part of the problem predated Momentus , pastor Strong says . At Tocchini ' s church , for example , some congregation members were automatically suspicious of the seminar because of fallout from a 1980s movement called shepherding . Under that program , which at one time involved charismatic churches across the country , individuals submitted control of their personal lives to church leaders . The purpose , Strong says , was to help believers follow biblical teachings , but it got_to the point where &quot; people were being told how often to have_sex with their wives. &quot; That , he says , &quot; left many wary of the next fad . And when that next fad came_through -- in the form of Momentus -- a bunch of people not only said ' no , ' but ' hell no. ' &quot; Tocchini had expected to make waves . After leaving the Episcopal church in Petaluma , he halted the seminars for more_than a year because &quot; I knew what kind of upset was coming and I wasn ' t sure I wanted to pay the price. &quot; It wasn ' t until mid-1992 , after a_few more trial runs of the seminar in Santa Rosa , that he incorporated Mashiyach Training Services ( from a Hebrew word meaning anointed ) as a nonprofit religious organization . ( A few months later , the nonprofit status was changed to for-profit , with Tocchini controlling 78 % of the corporation ' s stock. ) He also created a $ 400 advanced course , launched satellite offices in Tustin and Houston , and now holds seminars in Dallas , Sacramento , Florida and Hawaii . But Tocchini , a raspy-voiced college dropout who looks somewhat like a big Danny DeVito , says Momentus has yet to make a buck . In 1993 , the corporation grossed $ 250 # 000 , paid Tocchini about $ 35 # 000 and lost money , he says . This year , with a second seminar leader on staff and a new audiocassette sales division , Tocchini expects to move_into black ink . * Although Southern California and Texas haven ' t seen the sort of church split that rocked Santa Rosa , occasional small problems have arisen . Mission Viejo Vineyard Christian Fellowship , for example , lost 15 to 20 of its 300 adult members after church leaders criticized the program . And a 550-person Assemblies of God church near Houston lost about 50 members when it endorsed Momentus . To counter criticism , Tocchini has made some changes . In addition to dumping the peepee hugs , he also jettisoned his use of profanity in the seminars ( although attendees themselves are free to swear if they wish ) and a visualization exercise that had people picture themselves soaring to heaven to retrieve a package that contained the baby Jesus ( opponents consider such uses of the imagination occultic ) . But skeptics say the changes are cosmetic . &quot; You ' re dealing with a greased pig , &quot; says Santa Rosa pastor Dick Williams , who went_through Momentus and liked it , then decided he had been psychologically manipulated . &quot; No matter what you say , they can say , ' Oh , we ' re not doing that anymore. ' &quot; Says Tocchini : &quot; No matter how thoroughly we document our ministry with a Biblical rationale , ( some ) will never cease their opposition. &quot; Momentus supporters acknowledge that their approach defies religious convention . Although Marriage Encounter , Cursillo retreats and some_other accepted Christian programs have also adapted a_few encounter-group techniques , none uses Momentus ' discomforting style . &quot; This is not a retreat , &quot; says pastor Coombs . &quot; It ' s a major confrontation -- with yourself. &quot; The idea , Strong says , is to break_through the &quot; anger , bitterness and old tapes &quot; that hold people back from fully following Christ . People are forced to look_at discrepancies between their behavior and their beliefs , which &quot; brings_up issues of repentance , confession and forgiveness. &quot; Psychological exercises are only used to reinforce points or draw_out emotions that get people to look seriously at their relationships with God and other people , he says . If it seems heavy-handed at times , well , Jesus was the same way , Tocchini says : &quot; About 80 % of what Christ said was harsh . Driving people from the marketplace with a whip was harsh . . . . He was as much a lion as a lamb ( because ) he was_after the truth. &quot; * The guy clutching the microphone was a liar and Wayne Coombs wasn ' t going_to let him get_away with it . It was day three of a Momentus seminar in Orange County and Tocchini had opened the floor to anyone who wanted to share . Coombs sprang from his seat and challenged his fellow enrollee . &quot; You don ' t love your wife , do you ? &quot; he recalls asking . &quot; What ? &quot; the speaker sputtered . &quot; Of course I do. &quot; &quot; No , you don ' t . You ' re a liar , man. &quot; The verbal sparring continued briefly , until finally the man broke_down sobbing and admitted that he still loved his first wife . Then , as the rest of the room listened_in stunned silence , he added : &quot; She was stolen from me by another man -- and I hate his guts. &quot; Coombs asked : &quot; Have you ever told him how you feel ? &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; came the grim reply . &quot; I beat the ( hell ) out of him . And then I went_to his house and set it on fire. &quot; At that moment , the man ' s second wife -- also attending the seminar -- walked forward , visibly shaken . &quot; Why didn ' t you ever tell me this ? &quot; she asked . Her husband hugged her halfheartedly , but she pulled_away and told the group about their empty marriage , how they hadn ' t had_sex in ages . It was , says Coombs , an emotional bombshell . Then something amazing happened . The next day , the woman approached Coombs and told him that she and her husband had somehow worked things out overnight and fallen &quot; in love. &quot; Her entire countenance , Coombs says , had shifted dramatically . A few weeks later , she showed_up at Coombs ' church , still enthralled with the marriage -- and pregnant . Coombs sees only one possible explanation : &quot; No ( psychological ) manipulation can do something that dramatic . that ' s the power of the Holy Spirit. &quot; Others report equally surprising changes of heart . Bobby Herron , an African American missionary with Athletes in Action , says the seminar disarmed the &quot; distrust and animosity I felt toward white people . . . . I ' m still an activist , but I realized that holding onto bitterness and hurt doesn ' t produce good fruit . . . . I hope other individuals of color will avail themselves of Momentus. &quot; For some , Momentus has been a spiritual epiphany . Of the 250 non-Christians who have gone_through the seminar , about 200 have converted to Christ , Tocchini says . He adds that Momentus doesn ' t proselytize nonbelievers -- a statement attested to by a Jewish couple who attended a recent Manhattan Beach seminar -- but says anything can happen once the sessions get under way . A few even claim to have heard whisperings from God . Williams , the Santa Rosa minister who is among those most critical of Momentus , says he &quot; experienced the Holy_Spirit speaking_to me in some of the exercises. &quot; Says Tocchini : &quot; It ' s a real potent environment . . . . It ' s powerful . I ' ve had 40 or 50 people remember molestations they never remembered before. &quot; Occasionally , something backfires . &quot; If you put a jerk through this , he comes_out a dynamic jerk at the other end , &quot; Strong says . But most of the 1 # 200 people who have taken Momentus -- including a growing roster of Christian celebrities -- seem to rave about it . Harold Ezell , a former Border_Patrol chieftain and Der Wienerschnitzel exec , says it helped him become &quot; more forgiving. &quot; And Christian musician Sheila Walsh , onetime sidekick to Pat Robertson , testifies in Momentus brochures that it enabled her -- after 26 years as a believer -- to &quot; finally begin to grasp hold of what it means to love God with everything and to love my neighbor as myself. &quot; * Leading the opposition is the Christian Research Institute of Irvine , an anti-cult organization that wields considerable influence among conservative believers . Last year , CRI issued a statement that it was investigating &quot; disturbing reports &quot; about the seminar because &quot; it appears that a number of principles embraced and promoted by the human potential movement ( in particular Lifespring ) have been carried_over to Momentus under a thin veneer of Christianese. &quot; But CRI officials admit that they have done virtually no firsthand research on the seminar . And several former CRI staffers say the institute ' s methods and credibility have slipped_in recent years . For example , CRI acknowledges that its most current critique of the Vineyard -- a popular , nationwide network of charismatic churches -- was written nine years ago by a free-lance researcher who based his entire report on a four-day Vineyard conference about church growth . The information was never double-checked or updated . In the case of Momentus , CRI has relied_on statements from &quot; seven to 10 &quot; unhappy seminar attendees ( but says only two of them will allow their names to be released ) , a handful of skeptical Santa Rosa ministers and a theological analysis written by a premed student from Orange Coast College who left a local seminar after a day and a half . Not good_enough , say several other researchers . &quot; ( You ) don ' t make blanket statements based on somebody ' s rumors , &quot; explains Gretchen Passantino , a Christian investigative journalist who once worked for CRI . Although somewhat dubious about Momentus herself , Passantino says the only accurate way to assess the seminar is to send a trained researcher through undercover . Interviews with Tocchini and other knowledgeable sources -- pro and con -- also would be sought . CRI says it can ' t put anyone through Momentus anonymously because enrollment questionnaires ask where the person works and it ' s against CRI policy to lie . ( Requests by The Times to have a reporter attend the seminar without signing a secrecy agreement were turned_down by Tocchini. ) As for interviewing Tocchini , CRI researcher Marian Bodine says she met with him once -- at his request -- but &quot; Waco was burning that day and we really didn ' t have time to talk. &quot; Despite the limited investigation , Bodine drafted a five-page critique of Momentus last September . But it hasn ' t been released to the public , she says , because Tocchini threatened to sue . Tocchini denies hinting legal_action , and CRI continues to distribute various materials it has collected about the seminar . * Some observers suggest that the controversy over Momentus may be a lot of sound and fury over nothing . The effects of the seminar on graduates , say several supporters and critics who have watched it long term , often fade or disappear after a_few months . Rex Julian Beaber , a psychologist and attorney familiar_with encounter_groups , says that isn ' t surprising : &quot; The grand lesson of the whole marathon group encounter movement is that the effects are very short-lived . . . . It is very difficult to change another human being. &quot; The only reason people think their lives are different is because &quot; they confuse emotional intensity with significance . What are they doing now that they weren ' t doing before ? Were they unemployed people who now have jobs ? . . . Are they best_friends with someone they couldn ' t forgive ? The evidence of real change is usually trivial. &quot; The exceptions , Beaber says , are people who attend a seminar at a critical juncture in their lives and are thus more susceptible to a &quot; conversion experience. &quot; They usually join the group or stay involved to solidify the effect , he says . For most others , however , &quot; it ' s like a roller-coaster ride -- a brief emotional flurry that disappears in time. &quot; And that , he says , is the secret to any successful self-help or spiritual conversion movement : &quot; A truly great idea can be written_down in a book or article and transmitted to millions . But a mediocre idea has to be shrouded in emotional intensity. &quot; that ' s not to meant to imply that such ideas are useless , he adds : &quot; People ' s lives are so bland that anyone who makes them feel anything is a miracle worker. &quot; Butch Pluimer , a charismatic Tustin minister and Christian radio personality who is cautiously introducing Momentus at his church , agrees : &quot; Obviously , ( the seminar ) is meeting a need in many people ' s lives that the church isn ' t . Some say it ' s the most transforming thing they ' ve seen . Others say it ' s the most egregious . Let ' s talk and see if we can make_it better . . . . I don ' t want to say that everything they ' re doing is perfect , but I don ' t want to shut the door just because it ' s fresh and new. &quot; Clearly , the verdict on Momentus is still out . Even critics admit that they ' ve had a hard_time staking a position . As Santa Rosa ' s Peacocke wrote in his eight-page critique of Momentus : &quot; I have never been less certain in attempting to evaluate and discern if something was or was not of God. &quot;</TEXT>
