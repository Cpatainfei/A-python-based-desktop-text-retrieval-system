   <HEADLINE> THE WEEK AHEAD : QUEBEC_CITY ; INTO THE FRYING PAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Daniel Johnson , a fiscal conservative and a federalist , is to be sworn_in as premier of Quebec today amid continuing speculation over his abilities to outmaneuver the province ' s perennial French-speaking separatist movement as successfully as his predecessor . Johnson succeeds longstanding Premier Robert Bourassa , a Liberal who was known for his canny handling of the situation but who stepped_down last year because of ill_health . Johnson is considered a cool and aloof technocrat , firmly committed to austerity measures that are unpopular with Quebec ' s potent unions . Johnson ' s test will come this fall , when provincial elections are to be held . Currently , opinion polls show Johnson and the Liberals trailing the separatist Parti Quebecois , led by Jacques Parizeau .</TEXT>
