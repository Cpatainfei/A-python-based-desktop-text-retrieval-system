   <TEXT> SNOOP ON THE ROAD : As Snoop Doggy Dogg climbs onto the silver_screen , the Long_Beach rapper is also set to step onto concert stages for his long-delayed tour . He was originally set to be featured on a Dr. Dre-headlined tour last year , but that trek was scrapped , in part due_to Dre ' s own legal troubles ( he ' s on probation for a series of violent incidents and still must be at_home by 9 each night. ) Now that Snoop will finally headline his own tour ( with the group Jodeci also on the bill ) , the question some are raising is whether he has waited too long after the release last October of &quot; DOGGYSTYLE. &quot; &quot; His tour will be big but it would have been even bigger if it happened when the album had just come_out , &quot; says Wendy Day , head of the Rap Coalition , a nonprofit organization that looks_out for the interests of rappers . &quot; He ' s almost at a point now of over-saturation . We ' ve had a lot of Snoop in the past six months. &quot; The delay has also given time for some anti-Snoop forces to coalesce , Day adds . &quot; Pickets and protests are possible at his shows , &quot; she says . &quot; A lot of women don ' t like what he says about women on his record . He ' s different when you talk to him in_person . But it ' s what he says on this record that people react to. &quot; Other observers also fear that the fact that Snoop is charged with murder will bring_out pro-police protesters who have in the past targeted such rappers as N.W.A. , Ice-T and Tupac Shakur . &quot; There ' s a lot of negative feeling about him out there in the mainstream , &quot; says one record industry source who asked not to be named . &quot; That feeling clashes strongly with the feeling in the rap community about him . I would n ' t be surprised to see some trouble on the dates. &quot; Dennis Hunt</TEXT>
