   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL REPORT / SOCCER IN AMERICA ; TALL ORDER ; MAJOR_LEAGUE SOCCER , SCHEDULED TO MAKE ITS DEBUT IN 1995 , FACES THE DAUNTING CHALLENGE OF SURVIVING ON THE COMPETITIVE AMERICAN SPORTS LANDSCAPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lee Stern can laugh about it now . He can find humor in a little enterprise he once undertook that had its ups and downs . &quot; Obviously , I never was interested in money , &quot; Stern said . &quot; Being in soccer prevented me from being one of the major owners of the Chicago Bulls. &quot; Stern , a successful Chicago commodities broker , once was a major force in American soccer . He owned the Chicago Sting of the now-defunct North_American Soccer League . He turned_down a chance to be involved with the Bulls because by the time the offer was made &quot; the Sting was losing more money than I could think_about , &quot; he said . Stern , who also once was an investor in the Chicago White Sox , lost millions trying to sell soccer to America . So did Texas oilman Lamar Hunt , who once owned the NASL ' s Dallas Tornado . If anyone in the United States has reason to resent even the mere mention of the word soccer , it is these gentlemen . Yet , for one month this summer there was little doubt each was running a socccer fever . They , like many other Americans , were swept_up in a euphoric wave of excitement over World Cup ' 94 . Hunt had seen 10 games by the third weekend and Stern could not be lured away from the television screen . But before anyone declares America a bona_fide soccer-crazy nation , there is much to be done . The architects of the World Cup organizing committee face a daunting task , the development of a professional soccer league that becomes part of America . That , after all , was the ultimate aim of their monthlong extravaganza . They sold us soccer for a month . Now , can they sell it for a lifetime ? &quot; It ' s not like soccer comes_into America today as a virgin sport , untouched and untried , &quot; said Kyle Rote Jr. , one of the biggest American names in the sport 20 years ago . But if Lee Stern , Lamar Hunt and a host of other successful sports owners could not make_it work , many wonder how it will be different this time . &quot; I think the party will be over in a couple weeks and soccer will be where it was , &quot; said David Burns of Burns Sports Celebrity Service , a Chicago company that promotes athletes for commercials . Even Leigh Steinberg , a sports agent from Newport Beach who represents a number of U.S. national team players , is not sure the sport will gain a foothold in America . And if it does not , the legacy of the World Cup will be nothing more_than fond memories . After the United States had upset Colombia in the first round , the sport ' s future looked promising . The next day , calls came pouring in , Steinberg said . But when the team lost a_few days later to Romania , &quot; It hit with a dull thud. &quot; Such is the fickle nature of the American public . Obscure Olympic athletes such_as speed skater Dan Jansen and skier Tommy Moe were darlings during the Winter_Olympics in February but have all but disappeared since . &quot; We ' re a trendy country , &quot; Steinberg said . &quot; We tend to focus_on things that are hot . All of a sudden soccer is hot. &quot; But for how long ? The soccer community is unswayed by such pessimism . The World Cup captured the imagination of a nation , and those who have toiled in the soccer trenches for much of their lives believe their sport and time have come . It might take_five years to find_out if they are right . Major_League Soccer , which is scheduled to open in 12 cities next April , is hoping to lay a foundation to sustain the sport . The World Cup was the jump start , and optimism is oozing from the Century City offices MLS shared with the World Cup ' 94 organizing committee . Alan Rothenberg , head of World Cup USA ' 94 , the U.S. Soccer Federation and MLS , is part of the reason many believe the new league has a better chance of succeeding than past efforts . &quot; Alan came_up with this brilliant scheme that might be the only scheme that could work , &quot; said Rote , a Memphis sports agent . Unlike most sports enterprises , MLS has total ownership . Instead of a collection of individual owners , MLS will dictate rules and policy in what Rothenberg calls a single-entity league . But when the World Cup started June 17 , the proposed league had so many question_marks that a healthy skepticism prevailed . For instance , the day before the Cup opener in Chicago , Rothenberg introduced seven cities as charter_members of MLS , instead of the expected 12 . Rothenberg said recently that five more cities would be named by Aug . 1 , although others say it probably will happen sometime in the fall . Furthermore , major sponsors and financing , the backbone of the single-entity league , have not been announced . MLS insiders say the World Cup has piqued the interest of potential investors , but the fledgling league needs commitment now more_than ever . &quot; This is a challenge that I think can succeed , &quot; said Harley Frankel , MLS senior_vice_president , who worked as an NBA executive for eight years . &quot; What a lot of people miss is , this is not an attempt to have instant success like the NBA or baseball is enjoying. &quot; Frankel , once a staff_member in the Carter_Administration , said the league ' s plan to build slowly is solid , but the unexpected success of the World Cup has solidified its position . &quot; It has given potential investors more confidence , &quot; he said . &quot; It has given television more confidence that it will succeed . The World Cup has given us more muscle. &quot; Or as Roy Wegerle of the U.S. national team said , &quot; If this doesn ' t kick it in , nothing will. &quot; Yet , like most new endeavors , MLS faces many obstacles . There is a gulf of difference between interest and investment . The league has gained the attention of sponsors . MLS announced recently that Mitre will be the official game ball and Nike will provide uniforms for six teams . However , sponsors are not investors and until the money is raised , there will be no stadiums and no players . The league hired a Wall_Street investment_banker to help raise $ 100 million , a move that can be seen as a sign either of strength or weakness . And those who invest must overcome the fears of MLS ' own five-year projections . According to the MLS business plan , the league expects to lose $ 63.6 million from 1993 to 1997 , almost $ 30 million in its first season . The losses are based on an average attendance of 12 # 500 a game . By comparison , the Clippers , in their 10th season in Los Angeles , averaged 11 # 489 in 1993-94 . Perhaps the biggest challenge facing U.S. soccer is bringing its community together with a common purpose . Although that is Rothenberg ' s aim , his stranglehold on the sport has caused ill_will . Rick Davis , coach and general_manager of the Los Angeles Salsa of the American Professional Soccer League , has fired a loud salvo . His league is being told it will serve as a second division , or minor_league , to the MLS . &quot; Why has the MLS been given preferred status when the APSL has been going_for four years now ? &quot; asked Davis , a former player with the NASL ' s Cosmos . And there is yet another league trying to start , Chicago entrepreneur Jim Paglia ' s League 1 America . But whereas the APSL and League 1 America covet the USSF ' s designation of Division One status , only MLS has it . Mostly , it has Rothenberg , who has gained respect from FIFA , soccer ' s international governing body , because of the success of World Cup ' 94 . Rothenberg said that FIFA President Joao Havelange of Brazil told him that the World Cup had been the best in the sport ' s history . When it comes_to the MLS and the sport ' s future , Davis thinks an opportunity has been lost . &quot; I am disappointed and frustrated that the MLS isn ' t going_to play a game for nearly a year after the World Cup , &quot; Davis said . &quot; The league should have been ready to capitalize on new spectator interest here as soon as the World Cup ended . They knew in 1988 that the World Cup was coming here , so they had six years to organize and get the pro league going. &quot; Said the U.S. national team ' s John Harkes : &quot; If people who are up there in top places are doing_it for the game and not for making a buck , it will succeed . If they ' re doing_it to make a quick buck , it ' ll be out of there in a heartbeat . that ' s the way it ' s always been for soccer. &quot; If MLS sticks_to its modest goals in the beginning , it has a chance to gain acceptance . Hunt , 62 , said he would love to join the fun , but is too old to start another adventure . But having been around football much of his life , he notes that sports go_through cycles in America . &quot; Nothing stays the same , &quot; he said , adding that soccer might catch_on this time . To do so , it must compete with a broad menu of sports options , from baseball to football to basketball to hockey to college sports . &quot; We ' re not a culture where one sport dominates , &quot; Rote said . &quot; You can ' t go from no passion and no knowledge in one step. &quot; But the World Cup has at least changed perceptions . The international flavor of the matches in the nine host cities was a wonderful experience for many Americans . Without the electrifying scene of World Cup competition , soccer could lose its dynamics , said Burns , the Chicago agent . &quot; Atmosphere isn ' t a bunch of little kids running_around in shorts for momma and papa to watch them , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s the mistake soccer is making. &quot; Stern , on the other hand , believes soccer has been making_it here all along because of the number of youngsters playing -- as_many as 16.4 million by some estimates . &quot; This sport is here to stay , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s just too_much fun for kids to play. &quot; Does that translate into a successful pro league ? It has not in the past . But after the World Cup ? It might . Staff writers Julie Cart and Mike Penner contributed to this story .
