   <TEXT> Percival Lowell , wealthy scion of a Massachusetts textile family , was obsessed with Mars : He sought to prove that life existed on the Red_Planet . So he dispatched a Harvard astronomer on a hasty rail tour to scour the Arizona Territory for a telescope site . Lowell ultimately failed in his quest . But , 100 years after he first peered through a telescope from Mars Hill in Flagstaff on May 28 , 1894 , the observatory he founded is thriving . It was from Lowell Observatory in the early part of the century that astronomers discovered the planet Pluto and gleaned the first clue that the universe is expanding . The observatory , small by today ' s standards and not part of any university , continues its scientific role . It seeks_out comets and asteroids , studies the planets and assesses the sun ' s long-term future and stability . &quot; They have a long and distinguished history in making contributions , particularly in planetary sciences , and they continue to do so , &quot; said Richard Green , director of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories , including Kitt Peak near Tucson . The observatory marked its centennial by opening a $ 2.5-million interactive visitor center that will attract some of the thousands of people who pass_through Flagstaff , 140 miles north of Phoenix , on their way to the Grand_Canyon . &quot; The observatory is alive and well and pursuing astronomy at the forefront of what ' s being done , &quot; said Edward Bowell , a staff astronomer and noted asteroid hunter . Bowell and astronomers Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker head an effort to detect potentially lethal chunks of ice and rock hurtling through space . They are among the most prolific patrollers in the world : Bowell has discovered and named more_than 300 asteroids , and Carolyn Shoemaker has found more_than 300 asteroids and 30 comets . They troll for killer comets and asteroids , like Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 , which is expected to plunge into Jupiter on July 16 at 134 # 000 m.p.h. Shoemaker-Levy 9 ' s collision with Jupiter will unleash a blast conservatively estimated at 1 million megatons , 200 times the explosive power of the world ' s entire nuclear arsenal . Lowell , with 16 astronomers with doctorates , has stayed in the game partly by upgrading older , undersized equipment in an era when instruments are constantly getting bigger and more sophisticated . Most important has been the use of extremely sensitive , digital_computer cameras that improve the performance of existing telescopes , according to Lowell director Robert Millis , co-discoverer in 1977 of rings around Uranus and in 1988 of Pluto ' s hazy atmosphere . These devices allow an instrument the size of the 72-inch Perkins telescope , the largest at Lowell , to operate as well as the 200-inch Hale telescope on California ' s Mt . Palomar did before its operation , too , was improved in the same way . With an annual budget of about $ 2.5 million , Lowell operates four small telescopes at Mars Hill , elevation 7 # 200 feet , and has five more instruments operating or planned on 7 # 200-foot Anderson Mesa south of Flagstaff and one in Australia . On Anderson Mesa are the Perkins scope , owned by Ohio State and Ohio Wesleyan universities , the 42-inch John S . Hall telescope , a 31-inch reflecting telescope , a $ 17-million instrument under construction called the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer and a wide-field telescope recently refurbished and moved from Ohio to study approaching comets and asteroids . The interferometer , to be operated in collaboration with the Naval Research Laboratory and the U.S. Naval Observatory , will use six 20-inch mirrors acting in concert to produce images 100 times sharper than conventional ground telescopes , Millis said . Lowell , the world ' s largest privately owned institution of its kind , reflects the course charted by its independent , charismatic founder . Percival Lowell , who died in 1916 , stipulated in its endowment that it could not become subsidiary to any educational_institution . Until 1948 , research languished , since the observatory existed solely on interest from its endowment . Then trustee Roger Lowell Putnam sought other funding and landed a contract with the National Weather Service for a project to study the sun ' s stability that continues today . The observatory was born_out of Lowell ' s fascination with the work of Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli , who described lines on Mars ' surface as &quot; canali. &quot; The word literally means &quot; grooves , &quot; but was mistakenly translated into English as &quot; canals. &quot; In early 1894 , Lowell sent Harvard-trained astronomer A . E . Douglass to Arizona to scout a site from which to observe Mars . In six weeks , Douglass ruled_out Tombstone , Tucson , Tempe and Prescott and settled_on &quot; Site 11 , &quot; west of Flagstaff . Five weeks later , he had a wooden dome built for Lowell ' s two borrowed telescopes . Lowell , a widely traveled Harvard intellectual , theorized that Schiaparelli ' s canali were farm irrigation systems . Lowell wrote three books about Mars , though professional astronomers rejected his views . But later work_at the observatory won acclaim .</TEXT>
