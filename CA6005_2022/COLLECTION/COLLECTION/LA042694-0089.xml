   <HEADLINE> PROPERTY VALUES : SPARKS FLY OVER POWER_LINES AND THEIR IMPACT ON PRICES ; UTILITIES : DEBATE GROWS ABOUT THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD ENERGY . UNTIL RECENTLY , CONCERN HAD BEEN CENTERED ON THE TOWERS ' LOOKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Attorneys , appraisers , real_estate_agents and residents living near major_power lines in the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County are watching to see the outcome of a trial under way in Orange County Superior_Court in which a group of homeowners are claiming that their property_rights have been compromised because of upgraded power_lines next to their homes . The plaintiffs went_to trial this month demanding that San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co . buy their homes and pay the 1990 market_price for them -- 1990 was the year when power_lines near their properties had more power added_to them . The utility sees this as an attempt by homeowners who have seen the market plummet to tap into the deep pockets of the utility . This case -- and several others like it throughout the country -- points to a growing debate about the health and economic effects of electromagnetic field energy , also known as EMF . Until recently , neighbors have been mostly concerned about the aesthetics of towers nearby -- sometimes reaching 90 feet high -- or an unattended electrical station . But medical researchers and scientists now report that we may be harmed by long exposure to a wide range of electrical sources , from small appliances like a fan to major transmission_lines . None of the recent studies are conclusive , but children and the elderly who are exposed to elevated levels of EMF may be at an increased risk for brain cancer and leukemia . Scientists have shown that EMF can alter basic cellular functions and may possibly interfere with workings of the human immune_system . Pregnant women may also be at increased risk of miscarriage . The new concerns over possible health hazards are prompting a growing number of homeowners and home_buyers to learn more about electromagnetic fields and their affect on health and home values . &quot; There will be fewer people interested in a property adjacent to a power_line , &quot; said Howard D . Greenberg of Tri-Valley Appraisal Services in Woodland Hills . &quot; It ' s not an adverse condition per se , &quot; said Greenberg , but he still discloses proximity to a power_line both to would-be lenders and buyers . &quot; It is a topic that is so sensitive now , &quot; said Kathy Mehringer , vice_president and regional sales manager at Fred Sands Realtors in Westlake Village . &quot; I don ' t think there is a standard of practice for the real_estate industry on this issue yet. &quot; In fact , the California Department of Real_Estate ' s Environmental Hazards guide for homeowners and buyers doesn ' t even mention EMF , she said . But according to state law , whenever a property enters escrow , the seller must disclose defects and hazards to a would-be buyer , but it is still uncommon for EMF information to be listed . While Mehringer cannot recall a transaction at her company that was adversely affected by the existence of power_lines on or near a property for_sale , she said she could imagine just such a thing happening . She isn ' t certain if nearby power_lines really have an effect on property values , though . &quot; If I am a buyer and I am concerned about EMF , I would probably choose not to buy a particular property instead of just seeking a lower purchase price. &quot; Cheryl McCartin , one of the Orange County homeowners suing San Diego Gas &amp; Electric , is convinced that upgraded power_lines have diminished the value of her property . The McCartins purchased their home_in 1988 for $ 730 # 000 . For 18 months , McCartin tried to sell her home ( the latest asking price was $ 700 # 000 ) , but didn ' t get one offer . &quot; We ' ve been trying to sell our home and we can ' t sell it , &quot; McCartin said . What she did get were comments from realtors and potential buyers about the power_lines . Around the time that the McCartins bought their home , power_lines on 45-foot-tall towers on an adjacent parcel_of_land were generating 12 # 000 volts each . In 1990 , the local utility company upgraded the lines by adding another 12 # 000-volt circuit , although the towers remained the same height . The McCartins filed suit in November , 1992 , claiming that the magnetic_fields coming from the power_lines are a direct intrusion on their property or , to use the legal jargon , they claimed an &quot; inverse condemnation &quot; and an unconstitutional taking of their property without just compensation . The McCartins and their neighbors want the court to issue an injunction requiring the utility to buy their homes for the fair market_value as of the date the upgraded power_lines were installed in July , 1990 . This would be substantially more money than sellers could get_in today ' s more deflated market . Utility companies locally and throughout the country are understandably worried about what happens if the McCartins succeed in their court case . &quot; There will always be a certain percentage of people who don ' t want to live near a power_line , but that doesn ' t mean the property values will be diminished , &quot; said Mike Poizner , principal real_estate officer at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power . &quot; Right now , we don ' t have hard market data showing that buyers pay less for property near a power line. &quot; Besides , he said , when the McCartins bought their home_in 1988 , there already was a very noticeable power_line there . &quot; It seems they weren ' t that concerned when they bought_in the first place , &quot; Poizner said . In the Los Angeles area , Poizner said , the DWP has done very little upgrading of power_lines in the past few years . &quot; Each time we have updated power_lines , we have tried to not increase the amount of EMF. &quot; That , he said , is done_by employing new technology and getting different electromagnetic fields to sort of cancel each other out . John Tinker , senior counsel for Southern California Edison Co. , thinks that the new trend of seeking property-related compensation from utility companies has more to do with the depressed real_estate market than science or real concern among residents near power_lines . &quot; The Southern California real_estate market is such_that a lot of people are trying to find a reason their homes aren ' t selling , &quot; he said . &quot; They ' re looking_for someone to help compensate them for the drop_in market values. &quot; While the DWP and Edison both say they haven ' t been sued because of property-related claims stemming from the EMF debate , such lawsuits are not far off , predicted Louis Slesin , editor of Microwave News , a bimonthly newsletter based in New York City that chronicles the EMF controversy for its 1 # 000 subscribers . &quot; We ' ve been tracking EMF for 15 years , and clearly there is an effect on property values , &quot; Slesin said . &quot; People sometimes can ' t get agents to even show a home_in the vicinity of a power_line . This is going_to be more and more tested in the courts. &quot; * While scientists debate the seriousness of EMF as a health hazard , Slesin said , attorneys and homeowners will increasingly seek to stop new and expanded power_lines with lawsuits such_as the McCartins . &quot; Residents are discovering that they don ' t need to argue the health issue , &quot; he said . &quot; They can more easily litigate the issue of property values. &quot; Residents who are concerned about levels of EMF can have their home checked_out room by room for free . The number to call_for information or to schedule an appointment for DWP customers is ( 800 ) DIAL-DWP . Edison customers can call ( 818 ) 812-7380 .</TEXT>
