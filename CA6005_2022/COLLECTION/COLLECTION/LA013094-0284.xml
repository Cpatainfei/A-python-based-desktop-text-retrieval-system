HOMEOWNERS WITH $ 5 # 000 EACH AFTER NORTHRIDGE TEMBLOR . CRITICS SAY ONLY A NATIONWIDE PLAN CAN WORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the wake of the Northridge earthquake , several legislators hope to revive a short-lived state insurance fund to help homeowners repair earthquake-damaged homes_in the future -- even as opponents insist that the state cannot afford such a program . The effort to re-create the fund comes a year after legislators urged by Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi concluded that the California Residential Earthquake Recovery Fund was bordering_on insolvency and had to be dismantled . Critics say the only way such a program can work is to spread the costs nationwide by creating a federal coffer for all types of calamities , including hurricanes and tornadoes in the South , East and Midwest , and volcanoes and earthquakes in the West . Backers of the defunct California fund acknowledge that the program had flaws but say Los Angeles homeowners with damaged property could have received several thousand dollars each under the program . &quot; It probably seemed like good politics at the time ( to abolish it ) , &quot; said Assemblyman Rusty Areias ( D-San Jose ) , who tried to keep the fund in place and Monday plans to introduce legislation reinstating it . &quot; I feel badly for the people who advocated the repeal of that program , but what we said will happen has happened , &quot; said Areias , who is chairman of an Assembly committee on earthquake safety . &quot; They took the risk and we all lose. &quot; If the earthquake fund had been in place when the Northridge temblor hit , Areias and other officials estimate , the fund would have contained about $ 350 million . If 60 # 000 to 70 # 000 Los Angeles-area homeowners applied for coverage , they could have received checks for $ 5 # 000 or more each . In the absence of a disaster fund , people whose homes were damaged are left to make claims against private insurance , if they had quake coverage , or seek loans from the Federal Emergency Management Agency . The state also offers tax_breaks for rebuilding . Then-Gov . George Deukmejian pushed for the creation of the California Residential Earthquake Recovery Fund after the Loma Prieta earthquake in October , 1989 . At the time , officials were rushing to find ways of responding to the $ 7.9-billion damage in the San Francisco area , and the program won near unanimous support in the Legislature . As it was envisioned , homeowners were supposed to pay $ 12 a year into the fund if they lived_in areas where the risk of earthquakes is low , and $ 60 if they lived_in high-risk areas . The payments would be made when they paid their homeowners insurance_premiums . In exchange , the state promised to pay as much as $ 15 # 000 to owners of single-family houses for quake damage , with a $ 3 # 500 deductible . Deukmejian viewed the fund as a supplement to private earthquake insurance_policies , which commonly have deductibles of 10 % of the policy ' s value . On a $ 200 # 000 policy , the homeowner must pay the first $ 20 # 000 in damage . Areias said the legislation never promised to pay the full $ 15 # 000 . All it guaranteed was a prorated share of whatever was in the fund . In the short time the program was in place , homeowners whose residences were damaged by quakes in 1992 received $ 120 million in payments . After the 7.6 quake in the Mojave_Desert and the 6.7 quake in Big Bear in 1992 , 4 # 900 people from as far as Los Angeles and San Diego filed claims , and received checks averaging $ 6 # 439 . The fund also was in place in April , 1992 , when a 7.1 quake rocked Northern California . In all , 1 # 370 homeowners received money after that quake . &quot; It was a godsend , &quot; said Pat Tomasini , who received checks totaling $ 13 # 000 after her home_in the Victorian town of Ferndale was destroyed by the April , 1992 , quake . &quot; that ' s a big , big help , &quot; added Tomasini , who has rebuilt . &quot; It can pay_for foundations , it can pay_for a lot of things . When you have no house , you have no collateral . That ( $ 13 # 000 ) is your security. &quot; Areias blamed legislators from areas where the risk of quake damage is low for undermining the program . Their constituents did not want to pay the minimum $ 12 annual premiums , he said . He also criticized Garamendi for not trying harder to make the program work . When he was a state_senator , Garamendi was among legislators who voted to create the fund . But when he became insurance commissioner and was faced with the prospect of administering the program , Garamendi began sounding warnings that the program was unworkable . The focus of his criticism was that the program promised more_than it could deliver . In an interview after the Northridge quake , Garamendi called the program a &quot; bait and switch &quot; because of an implied promise that people who paid their premiums could have collected up_to $ 15 # 000 . The fund never could have paid everyone who was eligible , he said . &quot; Never , ever promise people something that you can ' t deliver . That is known as fraud , &quot; Garamendi said . &quot; You tell people : ' Pay $ 60 a year , and the state will pay you up_to $ 15 # 000 , ' and we only give you $ 2 # 000 , that is a fraud . I would shut_down an insurance_company that did that , and go_to the district_attorney to get an indictment. &quot; He said the program was flawed from the start . There was , he and other critics noted , no requirement that people who paid into the state fund also have private insurance_policies . Nor was there a penalty for failing to pay into the fund , and fewer than half the homeowners in California did . In the months before the fund was abolished , Garamendi offered several suggestions to the Legislature for ensuring that people made their payments , ranging from liens placed on the property to adding the fees to annual property_tax bills . But many of the options had the ring of taxes , and as the memory of Loma Prieta faded , no politician wanted to be accused of supporting new taxes . &quot; The suggestions I made were totally ignored , &quot; Garamendi said . He then worked to abolish the fund and found allies in Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg , an influential Democrat from Sacramento , one of the few big cities in the state where quake risks are low , and Sen . Art Torres ( D-Los Angeles ) . Torres is considering running to succeed Garamendi as insurance commissioner . Today , those who worked to abolish the fund are relieved . The Northridge quake caused so_much damage that it would have bankrupted the fund . These critics believe that Los Angeles-area homeowners would have made claims against the state ' s strained $ 40-billion general fund . &quot; If you think people are angry now , imagine their frustration with a government that promised them a policy , and there was no money in the fund , &quot; Torres said . As homeowners pick_up from the Northridge earthquake , Assemblywoman Juanita McDonald ( D-Carson ) , chairwoman of the Assembly Insurance Committee , is planning to hold hearings soon on the question of insuring against quakes . Areias , who is running_for state controller , is looking_for support for reinstituting a recovery fund , although such a kitty would not cover damage from the Jan . 17 temblor . The San Jose Democrat said the recovery fund could be financed by mandatory $ 60-a-year payments per homeowner . Isenberg , who does not want to reinstate the fund , said it would cost property_owners about $ 1 # 000 a year to make the fund solvent -- much more_than homeowners would be willing to pay . Given the high price of a recovery fund , Isenberg and other officials suggested a statewide ballot measure to determine whether the electorate is willing to fund it . &quot; People want no or very low-cost complete coverage , with no tax increase , no cutting of other programs , a no-pain solution . I don ' t know how to do that , &quot; Isenberg said . &quot; Any politician who claims he or she does is lying. &quot; Gov . Pete Wilson , who signed the bill dismantling the program , opposes re-creating the fund . The state cannot afford to cover the damage associated with a major quake , said Marjorie Berte , Wilson ' s insurance adviser . &quot; It needs to be handled on a national level , &quot; Berte said . As high as the $ 30-billion damage estimates are for the Northridge temblor , a major quake on the San Andreas or other faults in the Oakland , San Francisco or Los Angeles areas could cause damage in excess of $ 50 billion . In Washington , Rep . Norm Mineta ( D-San Jose ) is carrying legislation to create a nationwide fund to cover losses from all types of natural disasters , including earthquakes , volcano eruptions , hurricanes , tornadoes and tsunamis . Mineta ' s legislation would create a fund to supplement private earthquake insurance_policies . Annual premiums would be $ 60 to $ 90 , Mineta said . The system would be similar to the national flood insurance program , in which people who live or own businesses in_flood plains are required to buy flood insurance and comply with building_codes designed to limit flood damage . Mineta , who intends to hold hearings on the issue next month , said chances for passage &quot; are relatively good. &quot; &quot; No one is immune from disasters , &quot; he said . At the California Seismic Safety Commission , Executive_Director Tom Tobin said some type of recovery fund , either on the state or federal level , is an essential part of the state ' s earthquake preparedness plan . Tobin opposed the abolition of the California Residential Earthquake Recovery Fund . After seeing it operate in 1992 , he said he was &quot; absolutely surprised by how well it worked. &quot; &quot; I don ' t live my life in fear of the Big One , &quot; Tobin said , &quot; but we do need options for recovery. &quot;</TEXT>
