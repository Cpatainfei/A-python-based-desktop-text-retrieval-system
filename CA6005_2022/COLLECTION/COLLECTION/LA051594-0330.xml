   <HEADLINE> FIRST_PERSON / JEFF KRAMER : DIET EXPERT GETS TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No meat , no chicken , no fish , no oil , no whole dairy_products . That sums_up the weight-loss advice of Dean Ornish , a deadpan cardiologist who never met a legume he didn ' t like . Armed with years of research and a heaping portion of common_sense , Ornish is methodically mincing the nutritional status_quo into so_much vegetarian ratatouille . How hot is Ornish ? Nearly 1 # 000 people showed_up to hear him speak in Santa Monica recently . Saint_John ' s Hospital , which sponsored the free lecture , said space ran_out two days after the talk was publicized . Ornish ' s two books , &quot; Reversing Heart_Disease &quot; and &quot; Eat More , Weigh Less , &quot; have rocketed onto best-seller lists . Drawn by the wise and gentle guidance of this unassuming low-fat guru , I witnessed his Santa Monica oration more as a glassy-eyed disciple than an impartial journalist . What can I say ? I love the guy . In the course of a month , Ornish has taken my desire to shed a_few pounds -- 60 of them , to be precise -- and introduced me to a low-fat , high-volume vegetarian promised land . Under his counsel , I have abandoned such staples as Corn Dog Wellington and 12-Cheese Pizza with Dove Bar sauce for more flavorful , satisfying fare , namely . . . grain . No , the transition has not been effortless , but it has been far easier than many of you blood-thirsty meat-eaters might expect . In fact , a central Ornish theme is that most people find it easier to radically change their diets than to cut_back on the bad stuff , one bratwurst at a time . Merely reduce the amount of fatty foods you eat , says the Dean of Lean , and you ' ll crave them more_than ever . But eliminate such fare altogether , and quicker than you can say &quot; steamed broccoli , &quot; healthy eating becomes a habit . Comfortably sated by mass quantities of plant matter , you will find yourself strolling untempted past whole bins of grease-embalmed pork grenades and other artery cloggers . Not only will you no longer covet such foods , but you ' ll come_to regard them with an indifference bordering_on disdain . You might even start lecturing friends and co-workers on the evils of demon meat . You might expound endlessly on the myriad uses of nonfat yogurt . You might puree eggplant . In short , you might become a crashing bore . You might also lose some weight . By following the Ornish regimen , which includes regular , moderate exercise , I have shed 10 pounds in a little more_than a month . I ' m now a Tinkerbell-esque 270 . &quot; that ' s great , &quot; Ornish said with a Buddha-like smile as we chatted before his talk . At the risk of angering the great master , I confessed that I was a bit disappointed that I had not lost more . But Ornish , who is director of the Preventative Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito , urged me to keep the faith . This may_not be the fastest way to lose_weight , he assured me , but it ' s the most lasting . To underscore his point , he told me about an obese patient who was placed on the program and instructed not to weigh himself for a full year . Twelve months later , he had lost an average of seven pounds per month , which added_up to a whopping 84 pounds . Ornish , a proponent of meditation and other holistic techniques , proved even more inspiring during his formal presentation . He lambasted federal guidelines that call_for Americans to limit their daily fat intake to 30 % of total calories . ( For example , if you consume 2 # 000 calories , no more_than 600 should come from fat ) . But to make a serious dent in heart_disease and obesity , Ornish contends , fat intake should be reduced to 5 % to 10 % of total calories . &quot; If we just put into practice what we already know , heart_disease could be wiped_out 95 % of the time , like malaria , &quot; he said . Like others , Ornish suggests a link between low-fat eating and the low rates of cancer and heart_disease in China and other cheeseburger-deprived countries . But the notion that a healthy diet can actually reverse heart_disease is something new . As the audience gasped in amazement , Ornish showed before-and-after slides of clogged arteries becoming dramatically clearer after patients embarked_on a 10 % -or-less fat regimen . Despite his training as a cardiologist , he was almost scornful of angioplasty , heart bypasses and other high-tech treatments that fail to address the underlying cause of heart_disease . &quot; It ' s somehow conservative to cut someone ' s chest open and blow a balloon up in their arteries , and it ' s radical to stop smoking , walk , eat vegetables and meditate , &quot; he said to a hearty round of applause . So persuasive was Ornish that no one in the audience seemed to care that he weighs nearly 400 pounds . ( Just kidding. ) Actually , Ornish is a trim ex-Texan who believed meat made him sluggish so he gave it up at age 19 . His interest in diet eventually led to groundbreaking clinical studies on heart_disease . An unintended consequence of his work with heart patients was that they lost_weight on a low-fat program . So he tailored the approach for the general public in his book , &quot; Eat More , Weigh Less , &quot; which includes a sizable collection of gourmet low-fat recipes . Unfortunately , no one in our busy modern household has time to prepare them , least of all my razor-thin , not-so-subtle girlfriend who bought me Ornish ' s book in the first place . She , of course , eats ANYTHING she wants , including whole-milk ice_cream and beef_tallow STRAIGHT FROM THE CAN and yet she never gains a SINGLE OUNCE AND I HATE HER AND I HATE DEAN ORNISH AND . . . Time to meditate . The point is that even if you don ' t use the recipes in the book , it ' s easy to improvise . For example , black_bean burritos with tofu and nonfat sour_cream make_for a quick and tasty meal . My plan is to eat this way for a year and see what happens . I ' ll either be very thin or very angry . So pass the damn celery .</TEXT>
