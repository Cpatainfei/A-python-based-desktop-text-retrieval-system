   <HEADLINE> FOR SENIORS ; OCTOGENARIAN TOILS TO PLANT SEEDS OF TREE AWARENESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Her eyes have a childlike quality . They ' re curious , seeking . But the eyes don ' t jibe with the tremor in her hand . She readily admits that her memory sometimes disappoints her . Her physical presence is slight but when she claps her hands after making a discovery about her beloved eucalyptus_trees , it ' s clear there ' s a force to be reckoned with here . &quot; Sometimes I think I lead a charmed life ; it always gives me what I need , &quot; says Grace Heintz , 89 , from her modest apartment in Santa Monica . Ever since she was a 4-year-old in her native Wisconsin , Heintz has been picking_up things from the earth and asking , &quot; What is this ? &quot; So it ' s no surprise that she can name every kind of tree in Santa Monica , has revised a book on the subject and wrote one of_her_own , &quot; Trees of Santa Monica , &quot; in 1988 . She taught herself to ride a bicycle at age 65 and rode all_over the city identifying the variety of eucalyptus_trees . Not_bad for a former grade-school teacher who several years ago took a botany course at Santa Monica College and developed a passion for eucalyptus_trees . She has driven a camper throughout the state to identify the trees . Of the 700 varieties of eucalyptus_tree , Heintz has identified 500 in California . And established a reputation . Jim Bauml , senior biologist for the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum , has known Heintz for 13 years and has used her on many occasions to verify trees in the collection . &quot; I don ' t know of anyone else who has a broader or deeper knowledge of the eucalyptus , &quot; he said . When the Los Angeles Zoo wanted to acquire koalas from Australia , Heintz was called_in . Why ? Because koalas only eat 17 varieties of eucalyptus leaves and she could identify whether those varieties were available . She made the identifications and the leaves were sent to Australia to test on the animals . They concurred with Heintz . A few months ago she received a call that would change her life . A stranger called and told her to get_over to Lincoln Park because something terrible had happened . &quot; I went immediately , &quot; Heintz recalled . &quot; When I got there , there was a wire fence around the park . Some man said I would have to leave . I told him I wanted to see my tree . It was 75 years old . He said , ' They aren ' t there anymore. ' I could see that but I wanted to walk to where it was. &quot; It was a significant moment for Heintz , to look through the wire fence at the spot where something of grandeur once was . &quot; I knew it was my destiny to fight the city and prevent this from happening again even though it ' s completely foreign to my nature to do something like that , &quot; she said . She talks_about a eucalyptus_tree as if it were family . Like the eucalyptus deanei she identified on 24th Street and Marguerita Avenue in Santa Monica . She found_out that it was going_to be chopped_down to make room for a house . &quot; The tree filled me with awe . I went and talked to the neighbors about it and it was saved and the house was built anyway , &quot; she said . Heintz says she has this habit that when she starts something , she can ' t stop it . She decided to speak before the Santa Monica Parks and Recreation Board . &quot; They had people there from the Native Plant Society who are plant bigots . They can ' t believe eucalyptus are good_enough trees . They say they ' re bad -- get too big , droop their limbs . They said they shouldn ' t be planted because they ' re not natives . They had their minds made_up and they didn ' t listen , &quot; she said . The fact is that only one type of eucalyptus , the brandis , actually droops its limbs , and only at night . Heintz believes that people like John Lynd , manager of parks and sports for the city of Santa Monica , must go . Lynd says the city ' s official policy is not to remove healthy trees . Although the trees in Lincoln Park were healthy , a section of the park was redesigned and the plan called_for the removal of the healthy gray gum eucalyptus -- a species that no longer exists in Santa Monica . &quot; We do plan on replanting but not with eucalyptus_trees for now . We do have a plan for the future which includes the gray gum , &quot; he said . &quot; In fact , Grace is growing some for us. &quot; Lynd said he always turns_down requests to remove trees and added that &quot; Santa Monica has one of the nicest urban forests of 28 # 000 city-owned trees. &quot; So , as she enters her ninth decade , Grace Heintz is starting a movement . A kind of tree politics is growing and attracting people who share her love of trees . They decided to model themselves after a group in Pacific Palisades called Palisades Beautiful , except instead of only planting trees as they do_in the Palisades , the Santa Monica group would preserve what they have and get_rid_of the people who favor chopping them down . &quot; We do need to keep watch on what the city is doing . I suspect I ' m the inspiration . I want this bad thing of chopping_down these trees to turn_into something good . The city has to get straightened on what they can and can ' t do . As for me , I always want to further my knowledge so keeping these trees is important to my studies , &quot; she said . The group will be called Santa Monica Beautiful and its goals are to preserve what is already growing , make recommendations to the city after careful analysis of what new trees should be planted and monitor the city ' s tree management . She ' s been called the &quot; Johnny Appleseed &quot; of California eucalyptus . Now she ' s planting the seeds of tree awareness . After the fight with the city , she wants to establish tree walks where schoolchildren and adults are taught about the beauty in their midst .
