   <TEXT> Brazilian novelist Joao Ubaldo in Rio de Janeiro ' s O Globo : &quot; I never thought I ' d write this , but I ' m a bit afraid of playing against the United States . It ' s obvious that , normally , any Brazilian team not composed exclusively of wooden_leg players would beat the United States . But the way we are playing , under pressure to not lose , I prepare myself for 90 minutes of suffering and exasperation , as with the awful game against Sweden. &quot;</TEXT>
