   <HEADLINE> MEDIA ; PUBLISHERS REACHING_OUT TO NOUVEAUX READERS ; MAGAZINES RUSH TO TELL RUSSIA ' S NEW RICH HOW TO SPEND THEIR MONEY TASTEFULLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the old days , Soviet magazines like Rural Life and Worker Woman offered readers such mundane articles as &quot; Tips for Fixing Your Tractor &quot; and &quot; How Our Factory Fulfilled its Production Quota. &quot; But today , there are Russian magazines with a very different goal : Telling the nouveaux riches how to spend their money . Trendy Americans with money to burn , after all , have upscale publications like Architectural Digest , Vanity_Fair , Connoisseur and Vogue -- all full of articles and advertisements suggesting ways to spend copious amounts of cash . So why not Russians , bent_on catching_up_with their shopping after years of empty shelves ? &quot; There are people here with a lot of money sitting in their pockets , &quot; Igor Grigoriev , editor of the new Imperial magazine , said . &quot; It ' s suicidal to keep a lot of money around because you don ' t know what ' s going_to happen here . The government could pass laws taking it all away . &quot; that ' s why we want to explain to Russians how to spend their money tastefully -- what to wear , what perfume is good , which car is prestigious. &quot; The appearance of publications like Imperial underlines how quickly some Russians are progressing toward a Western-quality lifestyle . And how quickly capitalism is developing here . * While there is much hardship as Russia tries to reform its economy , BBDO , an international advertising_agency , estimates that in Moscow alone there are also more_than 10 # 000 Russians who make more_than $ 100 # 000 a year . And there are other wealthy Russians , particularly in 20 other Russian cities with more_than 1 million population . Russia ' s new rich include entrepreneurs who have started successful businesses and people working for foreign firms who draw a Western-size salary . Some wealthy Russians -- members of organized_crime gangs , racketeers and smugglers stealing valuable natural_resources -- make their money through illegal means . Among the new publications appealing_to the rich : * 4WD Live , a German magazine devoted to four-wheel drive vehicles , which launched a Russian edition last June . The glossy magazine , on sale for &quot; hard &quot; currency only , profiles the latest off-road vehicles from around the world . * The weekly newspaper Inostranets ( Foreigner ) is &quot; for those ( Russians ) who are leaving forever , those who are leaving for a while and those who are staying home , &quot; according to the paper ' s masthead . The paper ' s regular departments include &quot; Work , &quot; &quot; Tourism &quot; and &quot; Repatriation &quot; as well as features on Russians living abroad . * Most ( Bridge ) is a slick monthly business magazine that attracted intense interest with a list of the 50 richest Russians . * Two other magazines were created with the specific goal of educating Russians about conspicuous_consumption . Grigoriev ' s Imperial is the more ambitious of the two , covering business , fashion , travel and leisure . &quot; Our magazine is for the beautiful people , &quot; the 26-year-old editor , who met with magazine editors in London while planning Imperial , explained . &quot; It ' s for people who drive BMWs , who buy clothes by Hermes and who wear cologne from Pierre Cardin. &quot; Imperial ' s thick , glossy pilot edition , published in September , was like nothing Russians have ever seen . One article featured Hawaiian vacations . Another showed_off collections of designers Christian Dior and Giorgio Armani . There was also an investigation into whether delicate Japanese bonsai trees can survive in Moscow homes . The magazine ' s ads come from Western companies including Panasonic , Bose and RJR Nabisco . It even scatters English words , printed in the Latin alphabet , throughout its Russian Cyrillic text . * Grigoriev explains that Russian lacks the equivalents of such words as &quot; style , &quot; &quot; promotion , &quot; &quot; contributors &quot; and &quot; features. &quot; The price_tag , too , is distinctly un-Russian . Imperial ' s first bimonthly issue , which is about to hit newsstands , will sell for $ 5 a copy , with 50 # 000 issues printed . Future press runs depend_on the success of the magazine ' s agreement with BBDO , which plans a cooperative effort to fill Imperial ' s pages with snazzy ads . Domovoi , a bimonthly similar to Imperial , was introduced last autumn by Moscow ' s Commersant Publishing_House . Commersant , one of Russia ' s leading media companies , produces the pre-Revolutionary journal of the same name , which was revived in 1990 and is now considered must reading for Russians in business . Rather than having to start from scratch , Domovoi will be given free_of charge to Commersant ' s 25 # 000 daily subscribers . Domovoi draws much of its staff from Commersant , with which it shares offices in a refurbished school . Domovoi , named for a mythical elf that allegedly guards each Russian home , aims to provide practical advice on how to spend money &quot; to the greatest satisfaction , &quot; according to its pilot issue . &quot; The magazine is for the nouveaux riches . They got rich a week ago , a month ago , and want to know what to do with their money , &quot; Igor Svinarenko , one of Domovoi ' s editors , said . Svinarenko added that Domovoi hopes to reteach skills that atrophied during Soviet rule . &quot; We were a classless society . Under communism , no one ever needed to know , say , how to talk to a maid . But now our readers need to talk to their maids , and it ' s not clear how they ' re supposed to do_it , &quot; he said . * Domovoi ' s 98-page pilot issue contained one article exploring the new suburbs popping_up around Moscow , discussing the pros and cons of each new community . Another feature described Russia ' s growing New Age movement . Readers also learned how to get a credit_card from Russian_banks that have started issuing Visa and MasterCard . A section called the &quot; Yellow Pages &quot; offered classified advertising . Like Imperial , Domovoi has its sprinkling of English words , also often printed in Latin script . Both magazines are printed in Finland , and neither seems to mind competition . Imperial ' s editor , in fact , says the two publications will complement each other .</TEXT>
