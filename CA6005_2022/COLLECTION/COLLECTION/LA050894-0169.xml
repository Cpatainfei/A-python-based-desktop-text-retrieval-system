   <HEADLINE> WAVE OF BEACHINGS BAFFLES EXPERTS ; MARINE LIFE : SCIENTISTS ARE TRYING TO DISCOVER WHY AN UNUSUALLY LARGE_NUMBER OF WHALES AND DOLPHINS HAVE BECOME STRANDED ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an unusual episode that is baffling scientists and upsetting beach-goers , two_dozen dolphins and sperm_whales have washed ashore along a 110-mile stretch of California ' s Central Coast , sparking an intensive hunt for a cause . The mysterious strandings , which began April 3 , have been clustered in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties , between San Simeon and Refugio State Beach . All but three of the marine mammals have died . &quot; At this point , we have no idea what ' s going_on , &quot; said James Lecky , chief of the protected species division at the National Marine Fisheries Service . &quot; There are no common symptoms , no obvious causes of death . What we do know is that these strandings are occurring at a much higher_frequency than we expect to see. &quot; Last year , marine scientists recorded fewer than 30 strandings of common_dolphins and sperm_whales along the entire California shoreline . In the five weeks since this spring ' s wave of beachings began , 21 dolphins and three whales have washed ashore . In response , volunteers in a statewide marine mammal stranding network have rushed to the Central Coast , rescuing the victims and collecting the dead for laboratory studies that may reveal clues . Although the species ' population levels are strong , scientists worry that the deaths could be an indicator of disease or the presence of toxic substances , either naturally occurring or people-related . &quot; We don ' t need to go_into a panic mode yet , but we ' re certainly concerned and we need to figure this out , &quot; said John Heyning , curator of marine mammals at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural_History . This week , Heyning will perform necropsies on several carcasses , hunting for diseased organs or other obvious explanations of mortality . Scientists elsewhere are conducting lab work , including toxicology tests to look_for the presence of heavy metals or other contaminants . Unraveling the mystery could take months or years , experts say . Theories about the beachings abound . One possibility is that shifts in ocean_currents have redistributed the species ' food source , forcing them closer to shore to feed . If that is the case , the strandings could simply be evidence of natural deaths that would usually occur at_sea , Lecky said . A &quot; red tide &quot; of toxins , caused by algae blooms , is another suspect , and a disease epidemic could also be to blame . In the late 1980s , 2 # 500 Atlantic bottlenosed dolphins died of a virus that was not identified until years later . So far , that culprit -- the morbillivirus -- has not been detected on the West Coast , and tests for it on one of the surviving dolphins were negative . Along the Central Coast , some residents see a connection with a massive spill of petroleum thinner at an oil field owned by Unocal Corp . The site of the 8.5-million-gallon spill -- which occurred over a period of 40 years and was only acknowledged by Unocal in March -- is three miles south of Pismo Dunes , where seven mammals washed_up . The state_Department of Fish and Game_plans to conduct tests to uncover a possible relationship with the spill , but scientists do not believe that one exists . The petroleum , they say , would probably have evaporated or become diluted before reaching the dolphins and sperm_whales feeding offshore . &quot; I ' m not ruling it out , but I would think we ' d have seen die-offs of birds and other more susceptible animals &quot; if the oil were to blame , Heyning said . The sperm_whale -- memorialized in fiction by the mighty Moby Dick -- is the largest of the toothed_whales , with males reaching up_to 60 feet in_length . Sperm_whales are also among the deepest- and longest-diving mammals in the sea , able to plunge 6 # 000 feet and remain submerged for up_to 90 minutes . None of the beached whales survived . The dolphins that have washed ashore include two species -- the long-beaked and short-beaked common_dolphin . Known to form exceptionally large schools , they are the most common cetaceans found off California . Neither the sperm_whale nor the common_dolphin is endangered . There are an estimated 750 sperm_whales in the state ' s waters , Heyning said , and about 240 # 000 common_dolphins . Despite those numbers , a beached mammal -- especially one flopping futilely on the sand -- is a distressing sight . At Pismo Dunes , beach-goers encountering the seafaring victims have been pretty upset , said Don Patton , superintendent of the state recreation area . &quot; We see quite an emotional response because you don ' t find these animals lying_around in our artificial world very often , &quot; Patton said . &quot; These things have washed_up in popular areas of the beach , and with the live ones , we ' ve had large_numbers of people in the water , trying to coax them back_out to sea. &quot; Encouraging a distressed mammal to return to the ocean is not necessarily advised . Although beachings remain one of nature ' s mysteries , experts say creatures that wash ashore are typically too weak , diseased or disoriented to swim . &quot; In my opinion , they just hit the shore and are too sick and confused to do anything about it , &quot; said Heyning , who has studied hundreds of strandings . For that reason , most mammals that wash ashore die before volunteers from California ' s marine mammal stranding network can race to their aid , said Joe Cordaro , a federal wildlife biologist and coordinator of the network . Even if rescuers arrive in time , he said , the journey to a rehabilitation site is stressful , and often fatal . In this instance , three dolphins remain alive . Two were driven to San Diego ' s Sea World -- traveling on foam pads in the back of a truck , where attendants kept them covered with wet towels and made_sure their blowholes were clear . Sea World ' s curator of mammals said the dolphins are in stable but poor condition , with one requiring assistance to eat and another receiving antibiotics for an infection . The third survivor -- named &quot; Catalina Bob &quot; by his rescuers and &quot; C53 , &quot; for Cetacean 53 , by scientists -- is doing better , recuperating at Marine World / Africa USA in the Bay Area . Krista Hanni , science director for the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito , which deploys volunteer rescuers , pronounced Bob &quot; in good shape. &quot; &quot; Diagnostic tests turned_up nothing conclusive , &quot; she said . &quot; If all goes well , we hope to release Bob in Monterey Bay on Monday. &quot;</TEXT>
