   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; ' DISCLOSURE ' : THE PLOT THICKENS . . . ; DOUGLAS , MOORE STAR IN ADAPTATION OF CRICHTON ' S NOVEL ON HARASSMENT REVERSAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like the hotel chain that promises &quot; no surprises , &quot; the film version of the best-selling &quot; Disclosure &quot; has little use for the unexpected , with one exception . Albeit unintentionally , it increases appreciation for the storytelling skills of novelist Michael Crichton . One aspect of Crichton ' s talent , his ability to spin_out glib tales that are pantingly close to today ' s headlines , has been much commented upon . &quot; Disclosure , &quot; with its au_courant topic of sexual_harassment in the workplace , is high-concept pulp fiction , the latest in a successful string that has included &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; and &quot; Rising Sun. &quot; But not until you see &quot; Disclosure , &quot; starring Michael Douglas and Demi Moore and directed by Barry Levinson from a script by Paul Attanasio , will you appreciate a humbler aspect of Crichton ' s craft . Although literary critics understandably fulminate about his characterization and his writing style , Crichton knows how to write a coherent plot , something his movie versions tend to have trouble with . &quot; Disclosure &quot; is hardly_a great mess . It is rather standard Hollywood fare , adequately entertaining if lacking in the over-the-top enthusiasm someone like Paul Verhoeven ( &quot; Basic Instinct &quot; ) would have brought . But its preoccupation with snazzy computer-generated special_effects has left key plot points so unclear at least one baffled viewer had to retreat to the book to find_out why some things happened and others did not . Of course &quot; Disclosure ' s &quot; money scene , the lurid sexual encounter between Tom Sanders ( Douglas ) and his glamorous boss ( and former girlfriend ) Meredith Johnson ( Moore ) , has not been allowed to languish in uncertainty . Crisply shot by &quot; Howards End ' s &quot; Tony Pierce-Roberts , it is presented as a high-gloss clash of the titans , with the unscrupulous Johnson trying to force her dastardly will on a plainly confused Sanders . Sanders ' confusion is understandable . When this particular day began , he and his svelte wife , Susan ( Caroline Goodall ) , were looking_forward to some positive results from the merger of DigiCom , the high-tech Seattle firm Sanders works for , with a bigger outfit . He might even be promoted to the plum job of vice_president of Advanced Operations and Planning . But when Sanders gets_to the office , he eventually finds_out ( in a typically murky bit of exposition ) that DigiCom ' s mercurial boss , Bob Garvin ( Donald Sutherland ) , has given the promotion he thought he earned to Johnson , an ambitious old flame who he feels &quot; doesn ' t know the difference between software and a cashmere sweater. &quot; As played by Moore , Johnson is a classic villainess with a heart as brittle as a silicon_chip . Rapacious and conniving , she insists on getting her own way or knowing the reason why . Although Moore does not bring the brio to the part that Linda Fiorentino imparts to &quot; The Last Seduction , &quot; she is perfectly adequate_to the film ' s single-dimension sensibility . The same is true for Douglas , whose character spends much of the movie rushing around with jaws clenched and a harried look_on his face after Johnson has the cheek to accuse him of harassing her . As DigiCom lines_up behind Garvin ' s favorite and problems develop with a new gizmo he is supposed to be supervising , Sanders decides to duke it out and ends_up with harassment expert Catharine Alvarez ( Roma Maffia , who makes the same strong impression she did_in &quot; The Paper &quot; ) as his lawyer . All this is certainly clear enough , but other things that should be are not . What , for instance , is the nature of the hold Johnson has over Garvin , and is there anything besides pure lust motivating what happens behind her locked office doors ? The book tidily clears_up these problems , but the film leaves them uncomfortably hanging_around . More effective , and a surprising highlight of the film , are &quot; Disclosure ' s &quot; visuals . Production designer Neil Spisak , art_directors Richard Yanez-Toyon and Charles William Breen and set decorator Garrett Lewis have created an exciting office environment from scratch for the folks at DigiCom . And the ever-reliable gremlins at Industrial Light &amp; Magic have come_up with a vivid representation of the possible future of virtual_reality technology . Although Levinson has done a plausible job of directing , &quot; Disclosure &quot; suffers from what feels_like a lack of creative passion . After &quot; Toys &quot; and &quot; Jimmy Hollywood , &quot; back-to-back personal projects that misfired , it ' s hard not to feel that he took this film on largely to strengthen his commercial credentials , and it shows . Similarly , screenwriter Attanasio , who dealt thoughtfully with ethical dilemmas in &quot; Quiz Show , &quot; works in a more limited moral palette in &quot; Disclosure , &quot; where questions of who is right and who is wrong are plainly obvious . The idea that sexual_harassment is about power , not sex , and that a woman in power can potentially misbehave just like a man may be news to certain segments of the population , but they are not news enough to light a much-needed fire under this production . * MPAA rating : R , for a very strong sex scene , sexual dialogue and other strong language . Times guidelines : The sexual situations are more clinical than steamy .
