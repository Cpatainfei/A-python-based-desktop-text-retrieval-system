   <HEADLINE> TO WEST TEXANS , IT ' S ' GOD ' S COUNTRY ' ; FRONTIER : THE REGION IS DRY , DUSTY AND VIRTUALLY DESERTED . EARLY EXPLORERS COMPARED IT TO HELL . BUT THE HARDY FEW WHO LIVE THERE FEEL DIFFERENTLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A century and a half ago , an Army explorer stumbled onto a hauntingly remote and desolate chunk of Texas prairie and was not much impressed . W . B . Parker branded the_hills and plains &quot; inhospitable &quot; and declared : &quot; Destitute of soil , timber , water , game and everything else that can sustain or make life tolerable , they must remain as they are , uninhabited and uninhabitable. &quot; He vowed never to return . Well , that relentlessly raw land was eventually settled , if sparsely . But major highways bypassed it , other Texans ignored it , and it remains today a region with little population or prosperity and no name or identity of its own beyond a_few hardscrabble farms and ranches and small and struggling towns . Apparently , though , the land holds a wonderful secret that touches the native soul . Joy Cave , a Guthrie schoolteacher , put it this way : &quot; We don ' t belong_to anybody . We belong_to ourselves. &quot; Then she added : &quot; Guthrie is the geographical center of nowhere . . . but something has kept me here . I just love it. &quot; Said Micky Parker , the librarian in Jayton , population 638 , &quot; We ' re really kind of stepchildren here. &quot; So where is &quot; here ? &quot; It is an ill-defined territory , well west of Ft . Worth , where the West purportedly begins . It lies north of Interstate 20 within a triangle connecting Wichita Falls , Abilene and Lubbock . A true map of &quot; here &quot; probably would include all or large parts of nine West Texas counties and bits and pieces of five others . that ' s roughly 8 # 500 square_miles , an area larger than the whole of Rhode Island , Delaware and Connecticut . Fewer than 25 # 000 people live_in this phantom state within a state , many on small farms and larger ranches where the earth yields few crops and a relative trickle of Texas crude_oil . There are no tourist attractions , no daily newspapers , no television_stations . Jobs are scarce , health_care erratic , the population aging and declining . Many schools have closed . Other high_schools , unable to field 11 players , play six-man football , sometimes in front of an audience of pickup_trucks . What does the citizenry say of this geographic dead zone ? They boast that drugs and crime are pretty much nil , that the people are close and caring and , most of all , that it ' s a great place to rear children . &quot; It ' s God ' s Country , &quot; said Janelle Barry of Spur , which is about as close as any to being this region ' s quasi-capital . &quot; The Big Empty , &quot; native son Jim Corder joked . &quot; I ' m always looking_for West Texas or my part of it , and not finding it , &quot; Corder wrote in &quot; Lost in West Texas , &quot; a whimsical and charming book that deals largely with his nameless homeland . &quot; My part of West Texas doesn ' t show_up much in books , &quot; thus leaving a &quot; hole &quot; in Texas , he grumbled . Outsiders , he said , &quot; miss the strange and lonesome beauty : the view one sees of the Double Mountains down the Salt Fork from the highway bridge between Swenson and Jayton ; the first dramatic drop into the deep of the Croton Breaks . . . . &quot; Corder , an English_professor at Texas Christian University , was born near Jayton , but even he cannot pinpoint the boundaries of his province . &quot; It just doesn ' t have any identity , except in the minds of the people who live there , &quot; he said . Corder figures W . B . Parker and his expedition leader , U.S. Army Capt . Randolph Marcy , flirted_with his province when they ventured into what is now King County many years ago . As quoted by Corder , Marcy was even less impressed with the region than Parker . &quot; It is , in almost every respect , the most uninteresting and forbidding land I have ever visited , &quot; the commander grumped , and spoke harshly of its &quot; barren parsimonious soil. &quot; Still true . This place is too dry , too dusty and hammered too often by winds from hell . The prevailing south_winds were lashing gnarled mesquite trees as a visitor arrived in Rule , population 783 , on the southeastern edge of Jim Corder ' s cosmos . The playground at Slim Sorrells Park is as empty as the Western Winds Motel and the Rule Memorial Museum , which is &quot; Open by Appointment &quot; only . The Rule drive-in picture_show is open weekends from April &quot; until it gets cold. &quot; Across the Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos is a German settlement once named Brandenburg but , for patriotic purposes , became Old_Glory in 1918 . An American flag still flutters in the center of what is now little more_than a shell of a town . Its school shut_down eight years ago , the grocery-service station more recently . &quot; Right now , I ' m the only fella here , &quot; drawled Lisbon Letz , the Old_Glory postmaster for 36 years . &quot; Time ' s starting to pass pretty quick now. &quot; Then there is the town of Swenson , named for the once-great Swenson ranching empire . Fat cattle wearing the famous SMS brand once roamed ranches in central , west and northwest Texas . Now Swenson is a ghost_town , its most forlorn remnant a red brick bank founded in 1911 . The hot Texas sun peers through holes in the roof . Over the doorway an awning of metal and wood hangs like something dead . Few natives know the country better than Gene Swenson of Stamford . &quot; There ' s a lot of this damn land that the only thing you can do is run a cow on it , &quot; he said , and even then it sometimes requires 35 acres per cow . &quot; Basically , this is ranch country . In my opinion , some of it was plowed up that shouldn ' t have been. &quot; In Jayton , the walls of the shuttered Barfoot Hotel are cracked and the paint has peeled . The weekly Jayton Chronicle is moribund , too , even though the town has fared better than most . Mobil Oil and the highway department are_active employers , and there is a Chevrolet dealership . A downtown historical marker reveals that the Double Mountain Salt Works was located along the Brazos_River on the &quot; Indian-infested frontier &quot; and was the northernmost business in Confederate Texas . Jayton also is the county_seat -- but that was not always so . According to one juicy tale , cattle trucks whisked the county records from the original courthouse in Clairemont , a mysterious fire destroyed the building and the records emerged in Jayton . So would a new courthouse . &quot; That makes a good_story , &quot; said librarian Micky Parker , but no such raid occurred . Furthermore , it was an electrical fire during a sandstorm in the drought-ridden ' 50s that demolished the Clairemont courthouse . There is no mystery about the Jayton school_system , which is first-class . Jim Corder , who attended the old_school , marveled at the grass-covered football_field , lights and closed-in press_box . &quot; When my brother played football at Jayton , &quot; he wrote , &quot; I remember watching the principal draw_off the yard markers in the dirt with a hoe. &quot; Jayton High ' s Jaybirds once played eight-man , then 11-man , and now six-man football . Don Richards , a Lubbock attorney , played_on Jaybird teams three decades ago and planned to return for this year ' s homecoming game and his 30th class reunion . &quot; It was a great place to grow_up , &quot; he said . He remembers having to travel_to Aspermont for the movies and to Spur to shoot pool . And mischief in those days was faking late-night accidents to stop truck_drivers on U.S. 380 , or driving a car across the train trestle at the Brazos_River . Ironically , Jayton ' s superb educational system is now threatened by the state ' s so-called Robin_Hood school finance plan , which funnels tax money from rich to poor districts . As a school official once explained : &quot; Our people are very poor . We just happen to have a pool of oil in the center of the county. &quot; Knox City , population 1 # 440 and the county_seat of nearby Knox County , is also something of a paradox . Debbie ' s is a friendly catfish and chicken fried steak place , but the Oil Patch Cafe is closed and abandoned . On Ranch Road 222 to Guthrie , home of the famous Four Sixes ranch , the terrain turns hilly and rocky . But an oasis , the Chaparral , appears out of nowhere to offer wine , beer and liquor . It is one of few such outposts in a steadfastly dry region . Purple wildflowers , defying all odds , sprout along the road , a lonely cow is wedged under a shade_tree in a faraway field , and civilization is not much in_evidence . The road feeds into U.S. 82 and , after crossing the South Wichita River , which is bone_dry , leads into Guthrie past the King County_Courthouse and up_to the headquarters of the 6666 . The Texas Almanac puts the county population at 367 , not quite half of it in Guthrie . Although Guthrie is little more_than a ranch supply center , there is a library next to the courthouse , and &quot; Lost in West Texas &quot; was afforded lofty display this summer . &quot; You ' ve found a good place to get lost , &quot; declared part-time librarian Karen Pettiet , who has lived here almost all_of her 40 years . &quot; It ' s true , there ' s not really much to see out here . &quot; But there ' s something you can ' t identify . This is a fantastic place. &quot; Along the highway from Guthrie to Dickens temperatures hover near 100 degrees and wind kicks_up distant dust_devils . This is truly the wide-open spaces . An occasional windmill interrupts the monotony . Only 322 people call Dickens home , but they have the essentials of all West Texas towns : a Church of Christ , a Baptist_church and a cemetery . The drive-in is history , so Dickens has a youth-oriented video business operating out of a house . They bring quilts , pillows , candy and soft_drinks along with 50 cents admission and flop down in front of a TV screen equipped with a VCR . &quot; We ' ve got 25 kids in town and we ' ve been having about 30 show_up , &quot; chuckled proprietor Mike Porter . &quot; So we think it ' s a success. &quot; Up the highway , the Double H Motel has rooms with refrigerated air , electric heat , phones and truck parking . A gourmet jelly store is long gone but the nearby Ponderosa cafe advertises the &quot; world ' s largest &quot; barbecue sandwich . In neighboring Spur , a garbage company once announced in the weekly paper that trash would not be picked_up as scheduled because of a holiday . It added : &quot; The whole town will be picked_up on Tuesday. &quot; Jim Corder returned to his homeland in the ' 80s and wrote wistfully of the Croton Breaks , Golden Pond and other special places in his childhood &quot; cosmos. &quot; &quot; When you get_to Aspermont , you ' re there , &quot; he wrote . There ? &quot; There , &quot; he said , &quot; is just around a curve on the other side of town . There , off to the left in the blue distance , blue above the broken plain surrounding them -- the Double Mountains. &quot; God lives atop the Double Mountains , Corder insists . &quot; The Double Mountains are not only the dwelling place of God , but also , as the markers of my province , they are the first boundary of the cosmos , &quot; he wrote . Stopped by fences , ravines or a gate marked &quot; Posted , &quot; Corder ' s approach to the Double Mountains was stymied . A more recent visitor circled the mountains for three days . Like Corder , he never reached them , so could not confirm that God lives there . But Sammy Baugh does . The former TCU football great and pro Hall of Famer owns a ranch that backs_up to the southern edge .</TEXT>
