   <HEADLINE> WHY NO COUNTRY CAN STAND ON ITS OWN ; WHAT ' S NEEDED IS MULTILATERAL REGULATION OF MIGRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Next month the leaders of the Central_American_nations and top U.S. and Mexican officials will arrive_at the Western_Hemisphere summit in Miami prepared to discuss the migration issue . There is no longer any avoiding it . Almost all parties in this hemisphere realize that the movement of populations across international borders is likely to be a top-table agenda_item at any such conference for some time_to_come . For in the aftermath of passage of California ' s Proposition 187 , many U.S. politicians -- far too many -- are scrambling to figure_out how to respond nationally to what they see as the will of the people . Or is it simply to exploit political opportunity ? Whatever the motive , it now seems obvious that something like Proposition 187 will make_it onto the national stage before long . What ' s especially galling to students of hemispherical politics , however , is any suggestion that Mexican authorities have been oblivious to the growing friction . In his final State of the Nation address , outgoing Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari criticized Proposition 187 in no uncertain terms : &quot; Local political interests in California tend to blame Mexican workers for the ills of that society. &quot; The farsighted Salinas added , &quot; Mexico affirms its opposition to that xenophobic campaign and will , in fact , continue defending the labor and human_rights of our migrant workers. &quot; While that necessary stand no doubt pleased many domestic constituencies , it also prompted Mexican human_rights authorities to point_out that Mexican immigration laws are among the harshest and that no fewer than 60 # 000 undocumented workers in Mexico -- who are often treated not any better , and sometimes worse , than illegal immigrants in the United States -- were deported last year alone . Thus the problem is neither solely a California one nor even a U.S. one but one affecting the hemisphere . This is why real progress toward more humane regulation of migration will not be made and cannot be made by one nation , much less one state . Any such negotiated agreement would not , of course , be a simple matter : Both the U.S. and Mexican constitutions , for instance , offer large guarantees of freedom to travel and emigrate . Even so , what ' s needed is some way to regulate the flow of workers across borders -- making_it aboveboard and legal , eliminating the exploitation that comes_with criminality . We believe that a serious bilateral effort to formulate such an approach would do far more to regulate cross-border migration , relieve domestic tensions and improve Mexican-U.S. relations than all_of the grandstanding ideas on both sides of the border . As Times Op-Ed page contributor Jorge Castaneda put it Friday , &quot; Many business and political_leaders in Mexico are now espousing the stance that very few ( including this writer ) staked out during the NAFTA debate : that Mexico should have pressed for a chapter on immigration , even if that meant complicating the treaty ' s ratification. &quot; For its part , The Times has suggested a bilateral accord or some kind of &quot; North_American Free Labor_Agreement &quot; as a way of controlling the immigration flow . A cross-border labor_agreement would only do what NAFTA aims to do with the cross-border movement of capital and goods : better regulate the salutary economic integration that is already taking_place among the United States , Mexico and Canada . Such an achievement would be far better than anything else now on the horizon .</TEXT>
