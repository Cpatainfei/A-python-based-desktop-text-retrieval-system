   <HEADLINE> PLO BLAMES ISRAELIS FOR DELAY IN ELECTIONS ; MIDEAST : ISRAEL SAYS THE HOLDUP IS_DUE TO PROPOSAL FOR A PALESTINIAN PARLIAMENT , WHICH DEVIATES FROM PACT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization are trading angry accusations about who is to blame for the delay in holding West_Bank and Gaza Strip elections called_for in their peace accord . Both sides agree on one thing : It is growing increasingly unlikely that Palestinian elections will be held before the end of this year . That means PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat will continue to govern the Gaza Strip and Jericho -- and some aspects of Palestinian life throughout the West_Bank -- with a government that has no popular mandate . &quot; The Israelis are not serious , &quot; said Saeb Erekat , municipal affairs minister in the self-governing Palestinian Authority . &quot; In the past , they accused us of not wanting elections . But they are obstructing the elections now. &quot; But Yossi Beilin , Israel ' s deputy foreign_minister , said : &quot; Mr. Erekat is suggesting to elect a Parliament . That is in contradiction to our agreement , and that is going_to create a very big delay to the elections . If elections are very important to people like Saeb Erekat , and I believe that they are , then he should remove the obstacles to elections. &quot; Erekat , charged by Arafat with running the committee designing the Palestinians ' first general_elections , said he handed plans for elections to Israeli negotiators Aug . 16 and 17 . His proposals -- which have not been made public -- reportedly call_for the Palestinians to elect a 124-member governing council Dec . 15 . &quot; They said that they will study our papers and get_back to us , but they haven ' t responded to us on even when to have negotiations on elections , &quot; Erekat complained . &quot; They don ' t want to have elections , because they don ' t want to redeploy their forces on the West_Bank and they don ' t want to give this government the popular mandate that it needs. &quot; But Hannie Jerushun , spokeswoman for Danny Rothschild , Israel ' s chief negotiator with the Palestinians , retorted : &quot; Yasser Arafat only wants to have elections that he knows he can win . We have not responded because there are things in their proposals that we do not accept and because the time is not right to discuss these things . This process must be done step by step. &quot; Oded Ben-Ami , spokesman for Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , observed that &quot; we told Mr. Erekat , and we told the Palestinian Authority , that we are not going_to jump to the next step before the previous step is completed. &quot; Ben-Ami said Israel has no intention of beginning talks_about Palestinian elections until Jerusalem transfers to the Palestinians authority in the West_Bank for five areas of civilian life . The date for that transfer has not been set , he pointed_out , although Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said last month it will be completed next Monday . The election raises temperatures on both sides because the timing , structure and outcome are considered critical to the success of the still-fragile Palestinian-Israeli accord . Neither side wants to be seen as obstructing formation of a democratic government in the territories , but both are aware that the election process is fraught with political risks . &quot; Realistically , I don ' t think elections will happen before next spring , but I want them to happen tomorrow , &quot; said Khalil Shikaki , a political_science professor at An-Najah University in Nablus and a member of an independent Palestinian group preparing its own election plan for the territories . &quot; I want elections because I want accountability. &quot; The committee Shikaki is working with is &quot; very close &quot; to completing a plan calling_for Palestinians to elect an 80-member legislative body and a 20-member executive body , he said . He said that opposition organizations , including Hamas , a militant Islamic group , and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine , a leftist organization , have indicated a willingness to participate in the kind of elections Shikaki ' s committee is promoting . Shikaki criticized Erekat for submitting election proposals to Israel that have not been published in Palestinian newspapers or debated within the Palestinian community . &quot; How can you start negotiating with the Israelis on elections , &quot; he asked , &quot; when you have not even built a Palestinian consensus on your ideas ? &quot; Under the agreement that Israel and the PLO signed_in Washington on Sept . 13 , 1993 , elections already are overdue . That declaration of principles stated a goal of holding &quot; free and general_elections . . . no later than nine months after the entry into force of this declaration. &quot; Technically , that meant elections should have been conducted by June 13 . But it took Israel and the PLO much longer than expected to agree on implementing the first phase of their accord -- Israel ' s pullout from Gaza and the West_Bank -- and transfer of authority there to the Palestinians . Israel only pulled_out of Gaza and Jericho in May . Since then , the Palestinian Authority has struggled to build a government to manage daily affairs in the crowded strip and in Jericho . It has also been engaged in often-acrimonious talks with Israel over transfer of some authority in the rest of the West_Bank to the Palestinians . The two sides agreed just last month in Cairo to transfer five spheres of civilian life in the West_Bank to the Palestinian Authority ; only one -- education -- has actually been transferred . The next step_in the process , the Israelis say , is securing funding for the Palestinian Authority -- expected to happen this week at an international donors conference in Paris . The Israelis say they will start negotiations with the Palestinians on Israel ' s military redeployment in the West_Bank only after they are assured that the Palestinians will be able to pay_for services there . Once Israel transfers civilian functions to the Palestinian Authority , it will be ready to start negotiating redeployment . And once redeployment is agreed on , Israel will start negotiating the election framework , Israeli officials said . But other hurdles keep getting_in the way of preparing_for elections . Erekat complained that Israel refused to allow Palestinians to conduct a community survey and district mapping . Israelis responded that they rejected the request because the Palestinians wanted to use a Palestinian company based in mostly Arab East Jerusalem to conduct the surveys . Israel insists that no function directly connected to the Palestinian Authority in the territories can operate out of East Jerusalem , which Israel regards_as an inseparable part of its capital . The Palestinians insist on involving East Jerusalem , which they hope will one day become the capital of an independent Palestinian state . &quot; Every day that we delay the ( technical ) process of preparing_for elections is another five days delayed on the actual date of holding elections , &quot; Erekat said . &quot; Soon , we will have to make another announcement of a date . I think it hurts us , the Palestinian Authority , so_much to keep delaying. &quot; Beilin said , &quot; I believe that it is in Israeli interest to have elections . It is the task of those of us on both sides who believe_in the importance of elections -- because they legitimize the process , because those now opposing the process may accept the Palestinian Authority , if there is a democratic election . It is our task to encourage each other. &quot; &quot; If the Palestinians agree , &quot; Beilin said , &quot; to elect simply a council and not a Parliament , and if they agree to have East Jerusalemites participate by proxy voting -- in other words , if the territory of East Jerusalem is not included in the Palestinian entity -- that will make_it possible to have elections in a very short while. &quot;</TEXT>
