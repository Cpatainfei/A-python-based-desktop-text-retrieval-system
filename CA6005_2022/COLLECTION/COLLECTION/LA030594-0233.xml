   <HEADLINE> HARDING ATTACKED IN PARK ; FIGURE_SKATING : SHE SUFFERS SPRAINED WRIST . POLICE NOT TREATING IT AS RANDOM . HER APPEAL TO POSTPONE USFSA HEARING IS DENIED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One week after Tonya Harding fizzled in the XVII Winter_Olympics by finishing eighth , she has returned to the public consciousness . Harding , under investigation for her alleged role in the Jan . 6 assault on rival figure skater Nancy Kerrigan , told police she was attacked while walking through a park in Beaverton , Ore. , late Thursday night . It was yet another twist to the two-month saga that also included Friday ' s decision by the U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . to deny Harding ' s appeal_to postpone a disciplinary hearing scheduled for Thursday . Harding , a two-time Olympian , said she was attacked from behind by an assailant as she walked toward an apartment complex where she is staying with her best_friend , Stephanie Quintero . Police are investigating the case as if it were not a random attack . They refused to name any suspects . Harding , 23 , suffered minor bruises and a sprained wrist . She was treated at Kaiser Sunnyside Medical_Center and released . With her left wrist wrapped in a bandage , she talked briefly with reporters camped outside the apartment where she stays . &quot; I ' m feeling OK , &quot; Harding said . &quot; can ' t you guys get a life or something ? &quot; Harding was visibly upset and suffering an asthma_attack when officers arrived_at the residence after the assault , police said . Rescue personnel gave her oxygen . She was able to talk only after taking asthma medicine . A police report said Harding told officers that she was pushed from behind . After struggling , she activated a personal security_system that emits a loud scream , which scared_away the assailant , believed to be male , the report said . David Webber , Quintero ' s father , told reporters : &quot; She ' s survived a lot of other things . This is just another thing that she ' ll survive. &quot; Webber said Harding ' s injuries were minor . He said they would not prevent her from competing in the World Figure_Skating Championships , which begin on March 22 in Chiba , Japan . But a USFSA panel could alter those plans if it finds that Harding violated the organization ' s code of ethics . The group is meeting Thursday in Colorado Springs , Colo. , to determine her status . The panel is expected to meet for at least two days , during which time Harding ' s attorneys will be allowed to cross-examine witnesses , said William Hybl , panel chairman . Harding could be suspended from the association . Harding ' s attorneys , who successfully stopped the U.S. Olympic Committee from suspending Harding before the Lillehammer Games last month , are trying to secure her place in the world championships by forcing the panel to postpone its hearing . The hearing was ordered last month after it was determined that there were reasonable grounds to believe Harding was in violation of the USFSA ' s code for her involvement in the Kerrigan assault . Harding ' s ex-husband , Jeff Gillooly , has pleaded guilty to racketeering in connection with the attack . He also has implicated Harding . Shawn Eckhardt , Harding ' s bodyguard , was arrested for his role in the attack and also named Harding as a conspirator . Harding has denied that she knew about the attack beforehand . But Harding ' s attorneys claimed that she did not have enough time to prepare_for the hearing , that the panel was not impartial and that the proceedings would prejudice her position in a criminal investigation against her . A Portland , Ore. , grand_jury is expected to deliver its final report on March 21 , a day before the world championships . The Justice Dept . also is considering whether Harding violated federal laws in connection with the Kerrigan assault . John Russell , a spokesman for the criminal division , said a review was initiated two weeks ago at the request of local prosecutors .</TEXT>
