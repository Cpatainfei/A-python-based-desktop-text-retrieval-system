   <HEADLINE> FAA FOUND LAGGING IN TESTING OF BOMB-DETECTION EQUIPMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Technical glitches are slowing the Federal Aviation Administration ' s efforts to develop new devices to protect airports and planes from terrorist bombs , congressional investigators reported Thursday . As a result , the FAA has made little progress in meeting the goals of the Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990 , a report by the General Accounting Office said . The law directed the FAA to speed_up research and development so it would have new explosives detection equipment in place by last November . &quot; Although several devices show promise , technical problems are slowing the development and approval of the devices , &quot; the GAO study said . &quot; Similarly , FAA ' s efforts to enhance aircraft survivability are promising but are several years from completion. &quot; The FAA has 40 detection projects under way but has conducted laboratory tests on only seven devices , the report said . None of them meets the FAA ' s performance requirements . An FAA advisory panel has estimated that approval of any new explosives detection equipment could be two to five years away , the report said . FAA officials said they have not seen the study . &quot; The FAA is anxiously awaiting the report from the GAO , &quot; FAA spokeswoman Liz Neblett said . &quot; When it does come_out , we will give it all due consideration and consider all_of their recommendations. &quot; The GAO , the investigative arm of Congress , said it found a number of weaknesses in the FAA ' s security research program , including the agency ' s reluctance to test new equipment in airports . FAA officials plan to rely_on tests conducted at its lab , the study said . &quot; However , the airline industry and others disagree_with FAA ' s approach and believe that operational testing should be part of the certification process , &quot; it said . The report also criticized the FAA for lacking a strategy to guide security efforts to put new equipment in place .</TEXT>
