   <HEADLINE> THE BOSNIA TRAP ; SOLVING THE UNSOLVABLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is peace at_hand in Bosnia ? Is the Clinton_Administration beginning to show some foreign-policy competence and sophistication ? A week ago , both questions seemed ridiculous . The shelling of the Sarajevo market put the Bosnian war back on the international front-burner -- but peace seemed as far away as ever . And the Clinton_Administration was still clueless , uttering threats against the Serbs it had no power to enforce , and offering the Bosnians hollow promises of support that only prolonged a hopeless struggle . But late last week , the Administration signaled a change_of_course . With Russia trying to block air strikes by the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , and with Boris N . Yeltsin refusing to take President Bill_Clinton ' s phone_calls for two days , the Administration seemed to understand just how bad its Bosnian options really were , and accepted that its entire Bosnian policy had been a mistake . Although the threat of air strikes remains if the Serbs fail to remove the artillery around Sarajevo , there will be no more talk_about bombing the Serbs to the negotiating table , no more huffing and puffing about European &quot; appeasement &quot; of Serbian aggression . The Administration has now agreed to back the European peace plan it once condemned ; and some officials now support lifting economic sanctions against Serbs , who the Administration once compared to the Nazis . Apparently , two important facts finally sank_in . Air strikes won ' t change the military balance in Bosnia , and the ethnic division of Bosnia is inevitable . Air strikes were always popular_with people who wanted to &quot; do something &quot; about the Yugoslav war but didn ' t want to commit U.S. ground troops . But the option was never realistic . Air strikes are a trap . What happens if we bomb and they still don ' t obey ? What then : More threats ? More air strikes ? And if they still don ' t obey ? What then -- ground troops , or a humiliating admission of failure ? To its credit , the Administration has always understood it would be hopeless to intervene with U.S. ground troops . The Serbs are the best and most determined guerrilla fighters in Europe , and the Bosnian Serbs are tougher than their Yugoslav cousins . During World_War_II , the German Luftwaffe launched massive bomb attacks on Belgrade and the German Army marched into the capital . This was the signal for a furious campaign of national resistance . The Germans retaliated with brutal savagery , executing hundreds of innocent civilian hostages in retaliation for German soldiers shot by partisans . Serbs were slaughtered wholesale by Croatians allied_with the Nazis . The Serbs -- like the Vietnamese and the Afghans -- fought on . By the end of the war , some of Germany ' s toughest and most cruel divisions were hopelessly tied_down in a losing guerrilla war in Yugoslavia . Can we succeed where Adolf Hitler failed ? Do we really want to try ? The Administration always knew the answer to both questions was no -- but it couldn ' t bring itself to accept the inevitable consequences . If we aren ' t going_to go_to_war against the Bosnian Serbs , then the Bosnian Muslims have lost the war , and they will have to take the best terms the Serbs can be persuaded to give them . This was the bone in the Administration ' s throat : Accepting Serb demands for partitioning Bosnia meant accepting ethnic division of a multiethnic country , recognizing mass expulsions of Bosnian Muslims from their homes by the victorious Serbs . This , said the more idealistic and fuzzy-minded members of Clinton ' s foreign-policy team , was tantamount_to accepting ethnic cleansing , something the United States can never do . This misses a subtle but important difference . The forcible removal of populations involves the involuntary exile of people who belong_to the &quot; wrong &quot; ethnic_group . Ethnic cleansing is the combination of forcible removal with deliberate crimes and atrocities : massacres of civilians , systematic attempts to destroy rather than relocate a particular group of people . When people are ordered to leave their homes , this is forcible removal . There may be a threat to use force if people do not go peacefully , but this is far different from the murderous anarchy and pogroms where people are shot , brutalized and chased from their homes by armed gangs of thugs . Let us be careful here . Recognizing that forcible relocation has created new facts on the ground does not mean condoning war_crimes . Where civilians have been murdered and populations massacred as the result of interethnic conflict -- where ethnic cleansing has been practiced -- crimes have been committed . The question of how the world should treat war_crimes in the former Yugoslavia will have to be decided when the shooting stops and a U.N. tribunal begins its work . This is a difficult question and the final answers are unlikely to satisfy anyone fully . But , for now , it is enough to draw a distinction between catching and punishing criminals and stopping a war . Forcible removal isn ' t new . It isn ' t even always illegal . In 1945 , the victorious allies met at the Potsdam Conference and ordered the forcible removal of the Sudetenland Germans : 3 million people , guilty of no crime except German ethnicity , were driven from their homes under appalling conditions . The United States and Britain approved this unjust and cruel act . Later , 12 million more Germans were driven from Poland -- some died as they struggled on foot through winter snows . Forcible relocation was bad , but it solved some problems in Poland and Czechoslovakia . Demands of ethnic Germans in Sudetenland and the Polish Corridor helped destabilize those countries before World_War_II and increased German political support for Hitler . Those problems don ' t exist any more . Without relocations , there would now be millions of restless Germans in Poland and Czechoslovakia . They would be a majority in many parts of both countries , and many would be demanding reunion with the Fatherland . The Balkans have a long history of relocations . The breakup of the Ottoman Empire left ethnic_groups scattered and intermingled from Yugoslavia to Iraq . Repeated massacres -- of Armenians , of Turks , of Jews , of Greeks , of Albanians , of Serbs , of Gypsies and of Croats -- led to forcible relocations throughout the area . For the West today to act_as if forcible relocation is a crime invented by the Serbs and without historical precedent is disingenuous and misleading . When people have grown to hate each other , and that hate has grown murderous , there is no point in_forcing them to live side_by_side . Instead of basing policy on opposition to the principle of relocations , we should be working to alleviate the suffering of the victims and to help them build new lives in new homes . Forcible relocation is like divorce : messy , expensive , bad for the children and never a good solution . But , sometimes , it is the least bad possible solution . It would be better if the peoples of the former Yugoslavia could live together in peace . But , obviously , they can ' t , and we will not get peace until boundaries correspond more closely than they do now with the distribution of the former Yugoslavia ' s peoples . Now that the United States has swallowed this bitter pill , peace may_not be as far away as it looks . For all_the noise , the three sides in Bosnia -- Croats , Muslims and Serbs -- are not all that far from a settlement . The Serbs have won most of what they wanted on the battlefield , and are even willing to make a_few small concessions to the Muslims . The Muslims , for their part , are fresh from a string of victories over the Croats , and the Croats are ready to settle . Peace hasn ' t broken_out because the Muslims are hoping for a_few more gains against the Croats and a slightly sweeter offer from the Serbs -- perhaps under pressure from the West . Now the Clinton_Administration , beneath the usual diplomatic double_talk , is in the process of extinguishing the last Muslim hopes for victory and encouraging them to accept a political settlement based on the military facts on the ground . This will stop the killing , improve the conditions of life for Bosnians and allow the process of reconstruction to begin . It will also reduce the chances -- very real and very worrying -- that the Bosnian war will spread to engulf the entire Balkan peninsula . The Bosnian Muslims have lost land in the war , but peace will be different . The Bosnian Muslims are a talented , entrepreneurial and well-educated people -- much more so than the Serbs . They may have lost the war , but they are likely to win the peace . This has happened before -- look_at Germany and Japan . The Clinton_Administration has finally accepted that the West can ' t help the Bosnians win the war . This doesn ' t mean we are helpless : We can and should help them build a peace . A generous program of reconstruction and development aid can give the survivors of this terrible , unjust war something that more bloodshed can ' t -- real hope . And , speaking_of hope , the new realism now animating the Clinton_Administration offers hope to Americans as well . It may be that , at last , the Clinton_Administration is shaking_off its rosy illusions about the state of the world , and that the next three years will see more of the sophisticated foreign-policy thinking that offers the best hope for world peace and American security .</TEXT>
