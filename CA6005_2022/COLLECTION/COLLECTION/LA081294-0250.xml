   <TEXT> Don Harris would n ' t miss a tournament in which Stealth participated if his life depended_on it -- which it darned near has . Earthquake repairs can wait while the Rousselet family is_on the road watching Stealth and Shockwave . And Fred Herrera , literally and figuratively , is driven to near-exhaustion coaching the North Hollywood Jets . What pushes these levelheaded people to_the_point of craziness ? Not their jobs . The answer is club sports . * These games are a step_up from Little_League . In clubs , community athletic organizations in which boys and girls 8 to 18 compete year-round in softball , soccer and other sports , competition is keener and so is attention paid to the honing of skills . Parents pay as much as $ 500 annually for their children to play , many with the hope of landing a college athletic scholarship . There are 31 club softball teams and nine club soccer teams in the San Fernando , Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys . Most clubs have one team , but some have as_many as four . As the names of some teams -- Spartans , L.A. Force , Wild Things -- suggest , no one plays the clubs to fool_around . That includes adults . &quot; Typically , there are tournaments darned near every weekend , year-round , &quot; said Steve Valentine , president of West Valley Soccer Club , of which Shockwave , a girls ' age 14-and-younger team , is a member . &quot; Kids who really want to play_at the club level need to be talented and interested . But they also need to have strong parental support. &quot; While players compete with high intensity , many parents , coaches and club organizers find themselves demonstrating a similar level of devotion . Rene and Leslie Rousselet of Woodland Hills no longer take their family camping , and they ' ve sold their boat they used to take_water skiing . But this family that no longer plays together still stays_together -- through club sports . Lauren Rousselet , 13 , the eldest of four children , plays goalkeeper for Shockwave and catcher for Woodland Hills-based Stealth ' s 14-and-younger softball team . Lauren ' s brothers , Michael , 10 , and Stephen , 8 , and her 5-year-old sister Brooke do not participate in club sports . But it ' s a good bet they will someday . Virtually every weekend , the Rousselets happily pack up their van and travel en masse to watch Lauren play , often staying overnight in a motel . The kids view the trips as mini vacations . Their parents spend time between games bonding with other parents . &quot; You make a lot of friends , &quot; Leslie Rousselet said . &quot; There are some really nice families , really nice kids . We want to go_out to dinner with them whether we ' re out of town together or not. &quot; Still , the going can be a grind . During one stretch this summer , the Rousselets ' itinerary included softball tournaments in Ventura , Rancho Cucamonga and Escondido , then a soccer tournament in Orange County on four consecutive weekends . Ten days later , the family was scheduled to travel_to Hawaii for another softball tournament . Small wonder that the middle_finger on Lauren ' s right_hand has been swollen for weeks . But then , so is her mother ' s monthly planner . &quot; I have a spiral calendar and we go_over it and over it , &quot; Leslie Rousselet said . &quot; Last year , we went crazy with all_the stuff we let ( Lauren ) and all our other kids do . I ' ve learned that it can be insanity . Friends tell me we ' re crazy . I get that a lot. &quot; The Rousselets pay $ 300 for Lauren ' s membership in Shockwave and $ 325 for membership in Stealth . that ' s money that could go toward home improvements . Since the Northridge earthquake in January , household chores have piled_up considerably . &quot; It gets expensive and there are , probably , other things we could be doing with our money , &quot; Rene Rousselet said . &quot; It does cause some conflicts between Leslie and me . But we both agree this is something we want to do . And it ' s a short period_of_time , really , in ( Lauren ' s ) life . You can ' t get this time back. &quot; Allegiances to club sports can approach near-fatal attractions . Don Harris , Stealth president and coach of the club ' s 12-and-younger team , almost died on a recent weekend trip to Riverside by ignoring nausea and vomiting that began the night before a game and lasted well past the first pitch . But Harris , a coach for the past 17 years , wasn ' t about to miss a tournament over a bout with the bug . &quot; I was thinking_of not going because I was ill , &quot; Harris said . &quot; But I felt an obligation to the kids. &quot; After the game , Harris headed for a hospital emergency_room . Six hours later , he underwent emergency surgery for a perforated colon . Doctors told him he had risked dying by not seeking treatment sooner . Harris said that two weeks later he was coaching again . He ' s scheduled for follow-up surgery near the end of summer -- after Stealth returns from Hawaii on Aug . 24 . * &quot; Club sports can really grab you , &quot; said Sergio Rosenberg , president of L.A. Force Youth Soccer Club in Northridge , which has three boys ' and two girls ' teams . &quot; Pretty soon , you ' re wondering what your real job is : your everyday job , or your soccer team. &quot; Running a club can be like running a small company . Most organizations are governed by a board of directors composed of coaches and parents representing each team within the club . The board meets regularly to discuss business , such_as fund raising and planning tournaments . Some teams enter tournaments in which competition progresses_to state and national levels . Stealth ' s 12-and-younger team traveled_to Indianapolis on Monday to compete in the annual national championship tournament sanctioned by the Amateur Softball Assn . of America , the national governing body of amateur softball . The team is scheduled to return to California on Sunday , then depart for Hawaii two days later for another tournament . Such lengthy sojourns , some of which extend_to foreign countries , do not come cheaply , or without the expenditure of some sweat -- much of it off the field . In addition to paying registration fees that cover the cost of uniforms , equipment , insurance and coaches ' stipends , parents help finance trips by conducting fund-raisers -- raffles , candy sales , car washes , whatever . Some clubs also seek corporate sponsorship to help foot the bill . In July , Fusion , a 14-and-younger girls ' soccer team affiliated with the West Valley United Soccer Club embarked_on a two-week European tour that included matches in Denmark and a visit to Germany . Fund-raising efforts totaled more_than $ 43 # 000 for the trip , about $ 2 # 800 per player . The trip paid_off when Fusion finished first in one tournament and third in another . &quot; We all decided that it would be a wonderful experience for our kids , &quot; said Marsha Kavaller , whose 14-year-old daughter , Lauren , plays for Fusion . &quot; We had a general meeting of our club and said : ' We ' ve got an idea ; let ' s go_with it. ' &quot; The whole_thing takes a major commitment . Sometimes , it ' s a commitment just to get the kids off to practice. &quot; Marsha Kavaller said . Members of the North Hollywood Jets , a boys ' soccer club with four teams , can relate . But thanks to Fred Herrera , the club ' s president , coach , and Jack-of-all-trades , transportation is not a problem . * Herrera regularly chauffeurs players to and from practices and matches , driving almost daily across Southland freeways . After one recent practice , Herrera shuttled players home to Los Angeles , Pacoima and Northridge before returning to his own home_in Van Nuys . Herrera , 45 , a former Jets player , arrives_at practice at Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks Park with goal posts , nets and duct tape in the back of his van . &quot; Fred is the Jets , &quot; said Marcos Solorzano , 17 , of Canoga Park , a three-year member . &quot; He ' s the spirit of the whole club. &quot; Many of the club ' s players come from low-income families whose parents work long hours and have difficulty meeting club costs . The aim of the Jets , a club &quot; running_on a shoestring , &quot; is to make participation easier , Herrera said . Registration is $ 28 . The club ' s four coaches , including Herrera , are volunteers who also handle organizational responsibilities . &quot; I was brought_up in Pacoima , so I know what it was like , &quot; said Herrera , whose sons , Ryan , 19 , and Justin , 17 , have played with the Jets . &quot; Everybody here helps_out . It ' s hard work , but that ' s the way we have to do_it . We ' re used to doing without the best of everything. &quot; * Still , the Jets manage to make regular trips to San Diego , Las Vegas and Bakersfield . And club membership is growing . This fall , the Jets plan to field a new 10-and-under team . Herrera shuns credit and maintains that he isn ' t the only one who makes the Jets soar . &quot; I tip my hat to everyone involved , &quot; Herrera said . &quot; There are a lot of Fred Herreras around , maybe in different ways or different organizations . I think anybody involved in a club is going_to make some sacrifices . That doesn ' t just go_for us . Everybody ' s got_to give something. &quot; Local Contacts SOFTBALL To contact the local branch of the Southern California Amateur Softball Assn. , call ( 805 ) 252-8292 .
