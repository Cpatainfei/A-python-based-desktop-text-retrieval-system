   <HEADLINE> NISEI FOUGHT SECRET WAR OF WORDS ; WORLD_WAR_II : LINGUISTS DRAWN FROM AMERICA ' S INTERNMENT_CAMPS IN THE ' 40S SERVED IN EVERY MAJOR BATTLE IN THE PACIFIC . THEY CULLED CRITICAL INFORMATION FROM JAPANESE CAPTIVES AND THE AIRWAVES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Half a century ago , the Japanese commanders didn ' t bother putting many of their wartime military communications into code . After all , they knew how strange their language looked and sounded to foreign eyes and ears . But the Imperial Army didn ' t know about an American secret weapon during World_War_II , the Military Intelligence Service , 6 # 000 Japanese-American linguists who served in every major battle in the Pacific , from the Aleutians to Okinawa . They questioned captives for immediate , useful information . They eavesdropped on communications between Japanese pilots and their airfields . They read poems and diaries taken from the bodies of dead soldiers . If the Japanese warriors didn ' t know about the Japanese-American translators , neither did the American public . The government pledged them to secrecy ; it kept records of their service classified for a quarter of a century after the war had ended . Their story is told in a new book , &quot; Honor by Fire , &quot; by Lyn Crost , 79 , who was an Associated Press reporter in Washington when she was hired by the Honolulu Star-Bulletin to cover the feats of Hawaii ' s soldiers in Europe . There , she became acquainted with the Japanese-American soldiers and has maintained those friendships for 50 years . Still , she had to work hard to get their adventures from men who , she writes , are &quot; so modest that you must drag the stories out of them or hear the accounts from others. &quot; In the Pacific , the 6 # 000 Nisei -- second-generation Japanese-Americans -- &quot; saved over 1 million lives and shortened the war by two years , &quot; Maj . Gen . Charles Willoughby , intelligence chief for Gen . Douglas MacArthur , estimated in a speech years later . All told , the Nisei linguists translated 20 million captured documents and questioned 14 # 000 prisoners , sometimes wresting surprising information . Responding to humane treatment from his Japanese-American interrogator , one prisoner , a former shipyard worker , drew detailed sketches of every type of ship in Japan ' s navy . Being a war front translator could be dangerous work . For soldiers like Yoshikazu Yamada it could be doubly dangerous . He was treating American wounded when the Japanese attacked an airfield in the Philippines . As he fled , the Americans mistook him for the enemy . He found himself ducking fire from both sides . Nisei linguists served with Allied forces from the United States , Great Britain , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , India and China . Many of them volunteered -- and some were drafted -- from the internment_camps to which virtually all West Coast Japanese-Americans were confined by a nervous government following the outbreak of war on Dec . 7 , 1941 . According to Willoughby , Japanese indifference about security allowed Nisei intelligence teams to read captured maps and orders , to learn Japanese troop strength and plans_of_attack and , from diaries and letters and poems , to learn the state of morale of Japanese troops . &quot; Other documents indicated the enemy ' s problems of food and supply , his order of battle , the effect of our air_attacks , his relations with the natives , the relative effectiveness of Allied and Japanese weapons , &quot; Willoughby later reported . &quot; Spot interrogations of prisoners taken_in battle were at times of such importance that they caused a shift in Allied plans of attack. &quot; The Nisei served in the struggle to open the Burma Road to funnel weapons to China . In India , they intercepted Japanese radio commands for air strikes . And , by a stroke of luck , they were able to provide Gen . Dwight D . Eisenhower with a description of Germany ' s defenses that his troops would have to breach when they invaded Europe on D-Day . That occurred because the Japanese ambassador to Berlin had been given an extensive tour of Germany ' s defenses and promptly sent a description to Tokyo . His message was intercepted in Turkey and sent to Virginia , where Nisei linguists translated it . Word was then flashed to Eisenhower . Despite their service , says Crost , the Japanese-Americans are still singed by prejudice . &quot; This story must be told , &quot; she said . &quot; Americans do not know how hard these men fought in a war to keep democracy alive. &quot;</TEXT>
