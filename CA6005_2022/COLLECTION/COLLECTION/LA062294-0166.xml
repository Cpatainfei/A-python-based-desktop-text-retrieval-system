   <HEADLINE> WELFARE MOTHER PLAN FAILS TO HALT PREGNANCY TREND ; SOCIAL_SERVICES : THE NEW CHANCE PROGRAM HAS RAISED THE EDUCATION LEVEL AND MOTHERING SKILLS OF TEEN-AGERS . BUT RESULTS OF ITS ATTEMPT TO DISCOURAGE REPEAT CHILDBEARING ARE DISAPPOINTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An experimental program being tested in California as part of a national effort to move teen-age welfare mothers toward self-sufficiency has shown disappointing results in discouraging repeat pregnancies and reducing reliance on government assistance , according to findings being released today . The program , called New Chance , demonstrated substantial success in raising the education level of young mothers and modest success in improving their parenting skills . But the study found that , like other programs in the past , it had little impact on one of the most serious problems facing teen-agers on welfare -- repeat pregnancies . Those in the program received extensive education , training , counseling and parenting instruction , researchers said . But 18 months after entering the program , more_than half of the young_women participating in it reported that they were pregnant again . And while many of them had found jobs , pregnancies and other family problems prevented them from staying employed for any length of time , leaving them on welfare . &quot; The results of the demonstration are mixed and they are less than what we have hoped for . . . . The program did not work in the area of repeat childbearing , &quot; said Janet C . Quint , senior research associate for the New York-based Manpower Demonstration Research Corp . and the author of the report . Over an 18-month period , the study followed 2 # 300 teen-age mothers who applied for the program at 16 locations in 10 states . With centers in Chula Vista , Inglewood and San Jose , California had one of the highest levels of participation . New Chance , which started in most states in 1989 , was designed for teen-age welfare mothers because they are the segment of the welfare population considered most likely to spend their life on public assistance . Its goal was to move them away from welfare dependency and toward self sufficiency through an intensive program which included instruction in contraception and family_planning as well as academic courses aimed at earning high_school equivalency certificates . Ultimately , officials hoped the services provided by New Chance would improve the lives of the young mothers and their children as well . The program was directed at a segment of the welfare population considered among the most disadvantaged . To participate , mothers had to be 16 to 22 years old , had to be receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children and had to have given_birth as teen-agers . The average participant in the program was 19 and had given_birth to her first child before the age of 17 . The vast majority were unmarried high_school dropouts . Researchers emphasized that the report released today provided only short-term results and said they hope that a follow-up study to be completed in 1996 will show that the long-range impact of the program was more effective . But they acknowledged that the short-term results clearly demonstrated that there are no quick_fixes . Robert C . Granger , senior_vice_president for the Manpower Demonstration Research Corp . and project director of the New Chance research , said the data gathered so far provides valuable guidance for state and federal_officials who are proposing welfare reforms . He said it shows that the Clinton_Administration and many states have correctly targeted teen-age pregnancy as a problem that must be attacked in any welfare reform plan . &quot; We think that it makes a lot of sense to focus_on adolescent pregnancy and to come_up with some ways of not having_young unwed mothers have babies when they are ambivalent about having those babies or don ' t want those pregnancies , &quot; he said . Quint said the high number of repeat pregnancies has perplexed both the researchers and the operators of the program and neither has found a clear explanation for it . She said many of the programs have since beefed_up their family_planning and added more case managers to their staff who could provide follow-up counseling for mothers after they left New Chance .</TEXT>
