   <HEADLINE> SHALALA REVIVES ' MURPHY BROWN ' PREGNANCY ISSUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a blunt warning about the dangers of unwed teen-age motherhood , Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said Thursday that television character Murphy Brown set a bad example by having a fictional baby out of wedlock . With the comment , Shalala echoed sentiments that led to a storm of controversy when uttered two years ago by then-Vice President Dan Quayle . &quot; I don ' t think anyone in public life today ought to condone children born_out of wedlock , . . . even if the family is financially able , &quot; Shalala replied when Rep . Richard E . Neal ( D-Mass. ) asked her whether the unmarried Murphy Brown was right or wrong in having a child . Shalala ' s comments came_in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee on President Clinton ' s welfare reform plan . The pointed remarks by Shalala dramatized the increasing willingness of mainstream Democrats to address the destructive social and economic consequences of rising birthrates among unmarried_women and girls . About 30 % of all children now are born to unmarried mothers , representing one in five white babies and two of three African American infants , according to the National Center for Health Statistics . In the past , many Democrats have charged that Quayle and other critics of the trend were racist , sexist or both . Clinton has repeatedly raised concerns about the increasing numbers . Quayle ' s allusion to the popular &quot; Murphy Brown &quot; sitcom came during a speech on May 19 , 1992 , to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco . He called_for &quot; social sanctions &quot; against women who irresponsibly bear children outside of marriage , saying that it &quot; mocks the importance of fathers. &quot; The speech was ridiculed by Democrats as well as Hollywood celebrities . Clinton , then seeking the Democratic Party ' s nomination , dismissed Quayle ' s comments as &quot; cynical election-year politics. &quot; Even then-President George_Bush ' s spokesman , Marlin Fitzwater , said at the time : &quot; We don ' t want to take_on a popular TV character. &quot; Informed Thursday of Shalala ' s remarks , David Beckwith , Quayle ' s former press secretary , told a reporter : &quot; You have made my day . . . . I am pleased that she has recognized the obvious. &quot; Shalala said she wants government to tell unwed teen-age mothers that they have &quot; made a mistake. &quot; Differing with those who advocate distribution of condoms in schools as a way to deal with the problem , she declared : &quot; We are absolutely committed to promoting abstinence-based programs in the schools as a key to preventing teen pregnancy. &quot; She balked , however , at House Republican demands for a federal cut-off of cash benefits to welfare mothers who have another child , saying that would leave such families destitute . She called_for a national educational campaign and for community-based programs to deliver a clear message to young people about delaying sexual_activity until they finish high_school and find a job . &quot; Half of the welfare recipients were parents as teens , &quot; Shalala said . &quot; If you are an unmarried teen-age mother , your chances of ending_up poor for the rest of your life are very high. &quot; Without changes in federal policy , she added , half of those on the welfare rolls will be teen-agers by the end of this century . &quot; This is a disaster -- children having children , &quot; Shalala said . Under Clinton ' s proposal , women under age 18 who have children would be required to live with their families or other adults , finish high_school and take job training or get a job within two years after going_on welfare . The Administration ' s plan also would impose new measures to establish paternity and require unwed fathers to pay child_support , withholding benefits from mothers who refuse to cooperate with state agencies in finding the fathers and setting_up a nationwide system to enforce payment of child_support , including revocation of driver ' s licenses of delinquent parents . Shalala said more_than 14 million Americans now receive Aid to Families With Dependent Children at a cost of more_than $ 22 billion a year , with more_than 3 million recipients added_to the rolls in the last five years . &quot; This issue has become even more urgent in light of some disturbing trends , &quot; she testified . &quot; More and more children are born to teen-age mothers and outside of marriage . Almost half of all single mothers receiving AFDC -- about 42 % -- are or have been teen-age mothers. &quot; While Shalala called_for bipartisan backing , Republicans on the Ways and Means panel sharply criticized the Clinton plan , arguing that it would be phased_in too slowly and was sent to Congress far too late in the session to be enacted this year . But Rep . Sam Gibbons ( D-Fla. ) , chairman of the panel , said welfare reform has a high priority and Rep . Harold E . Ford ( D-Tenn. ) , chairman of a subcommittee with jurisdiction over welfare , said the bill could be passed this year . In her testimony , however , Shalala said passage of health_care reform legislation is essential before welfare reform can work effectively . As_many as 15 % of women on welfare will be reluctant to give_up Medicaid benefits to take a job without assurance of health_care for children , she said .</TEXT>
