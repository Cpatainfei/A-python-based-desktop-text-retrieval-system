   <HEADLINE> SUITS AGAINST 3RD PARTIES HALTED ; LAW : THE SUPREME COURT RULING WILL MAKE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR INVESTORS WHO HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED IN STOCK SCHEMES TO RECOVER SIGNIFICANT SUMS OF MONEY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Supreme Court , overturning nearly a half-century of legal precedents , ruled Tuesday that defrauded investors may_not sue lawyers , accountants , bankers and other third_parties who &quot; aided and abetted &quot; a stock scheme . The 5-4 decision reinterprets the landmark Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to limit liability to those who directly perpetrated a fraud . The surprise decision , unless reversed by Congress , will make_it virtually impossible in many instances for defrauded investors to recover significant sums_of_money when they have been cheated by a deceptive investment scheme . Typically , the crooked promoter of the investment is penniless , having spent or squandered the funds gained through fraud . For example , California investors won a $ 1.5-billion judgment against former savings and loan mogul Charles H . Keating Jr. , but it was uncollectible because he had no money left . The financial recoveries have usually been obtained by lawsuits against others who have deep pockets , most often lawyers and accountants hired by the perpetrator of the fraud . &quot; This is a very dark day . It means untold thousands of investors in cases around the country will lose their day in court , &quot; said Joseph W . Cotchett Jr. , a Burlingame lawyer who was the lead counsel for a class-action suit on behalf of 23 # 000 California investors who purchased the bonds fraudulently sold by Keating ' s American Continental Corp . The decision will not affect settlements already concluded , lawyers said . That will be good news for investors in Keating ' s company , which owned Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine , the nation ' s costliest failure . Both the company and the thrift collapsed five years ago under the weight of bad investments and outright fraud , for which Keating was sent to prison . The investors received $ 260 million in settlements from lawyers , accountants , appraisers and others who worked as advisers to Keating . So far , investors have received nearly 50 cents on the dollar and will be getting_about 10.5 cents on the dollar more within three weeks , said Leonard B . Simon , one of their lawyers . He said a final_payment amounting to about 5 cents on the dollar will likely be paid late this year or early next year . Although those settlements are not affected by Tuesday ' s decision , the Supreme Court ruling would make_it almost impossible to effectively pursue future cases in federal_court , Cotchett said . Neither plaintiffs ' nor defense_lawyers believe that the decision will end most pending litigation , though it will likely cause numerous cases on appeal_to be sent_back to lower courts . Lawyers will have to sort_out case-by-case whether professionals participated in frauds and are still liable or whether they will be dropped from pending suits because they were so-called secondary wrongdoers as aiders and abettors under federal law . This is the second time in two years that the high_court has moved to shield accountants , lawyers and investment_bankers from damage verdicts in cases of massive fraud . Last year , on a 7-2 vote , the high_court said defrauded investors cannot bring a civil anti-racketeering suit against outside advisers on the theory that the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act , known as RICO , applies only to people who are involved in the &quot; operation or management &quot; of a fraudulent enterprise . Still , most securities fraud claims are filed under the Securities Exchange Act . In the wake of the stock_market crash of 1929 , Congress made_it unlawful &quot; for any person , directly or indirectly . . . to use or employ , in connection with the purchase or sale of any security . . . any manipulative or deceptive device , &quot; such_as a misleading stock offering . Private investors were given the right to sue to seek monetary recoveries . Without further guidance from Congress , securities law has been developed almost entirely in the lower federal_courts . In decisions dating_from the mid-1940s , judges have upheld private lawsuits against not only the principal parties in a failed investment scheme , but also those who aided and abetted the schemes . For example , an accountant who endorsed a misleading prospectus or an appraiser who put a phony value on property could be sued . Then , judges said it was important to demand that all those who knowingly participated in a fraudulent_scheme join in paying damages to those who were cheated . This wide-net approach to securities law gained public attention in the late 1980s when hundreds of lawsuits were filed against lawyers , accountants and bankers after the collapse of the savings-and-loan industry . Plaintiffs said these white-collar professionals played key roles in the failure of the institutions and should pay_for the losses they caused . But the leaders of accounting and law_firms decried this &quot; explosion &quot; of litigation . They said they should not be handed a &quot; virtually limitless liability &quot; simply because they have &quot; deep pockets. &quot; Apparently , their complaints found a sympathetic ear at the high_court . Last year , after squelching the civil RICO suits against accountants and lawyers , the justices agreed to hear an obscure case involving $ 15 million in housing bonds sold by a Denver bank . Rather than rule on the issue raised in the appeal , the justices said they wanted to consider whether the 1934 law creates &quot; an implied private right to action for aiding and abetting violations , &quot; as everyone had assumed for decades . The answer Tuesday was &quot; No. &quot; Justice Anthony M . Kennedy said it covers only those who engage in manipulation or deception , not those who &quot; aid &quot; or &quot; abet &quot; their efforts . Chief_Justice William H . Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O ' Connor , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas joined the opinion in Central_Bank of Denver vs . First Interstate Bank . In dissent , Justice John Paul Stevens faulted the majority for conservative &quot; activism &quot; by first rewriting an appeal and then using it to overturn decades of settled law . &quot; We should leave it to Congress to alter &quot; the law if legislators disagree_with the prevailing legal standard , he said . Not surprisingly , Tuesday ' s decision was welcomed by the securities industry and the accounting profession . Investors &quot; will have their day in court , but they will have to sue wrongdoers , not simply people who have insurers , or a large bank_account , &quot; said Theodore B . Olson , who represents the Securities Industry Assn . &quot; Many times the accountants or underwriters are named in the suits when they really did not engage in the practice . But they are listed simply because they are the deep pockets. &quot; The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants applauded the ruling as &quot; important progress in curbing abuses of the federal securities laws. &quot; Lawyers who represent defrauded investors say they will be able to seek damages from accountants and lawyers only if they can show they played a principal role in the scheme . &quot; In some cases , they are the primary violators . But this is a major change in the law . It adds a real hurdle , &quot; said Jonathan Cuneo , general counsel for the National Assn . of Securities and Commercial_Law Attorneys . &quot; This creates the need for Congress to strengthen the law to protect investors , &quot; he added . He and others noted that state courts have also been moving to limit the liability for third_parties in failed investment schemes . Plaintiffs ' lawyers , knowing the issue had been_on appeal , have been alleging other wrongdoing by professionals as a way to get_around a possible ruling like the one the court made . Tim Cohelan , a San Diego lawyer who filed a class action suit against Hill Williams Corp . on behalf of the home builder ' s 5 # 000 investors , said the lawsuit will not be directly affected by the Supreme Court ' s decision . The suit does not allege that professionals aided and abetted a fraud , he said . Instead , it relies_on state laws . However , the ruling could have an indirect effect , Cohelan said . &quot; Supreme Court decisions have a persuasive influence on state judges. &quot; Hill Williams collapsed last year after collecting $ 90 million from the public , allegedly to build houses . Only about 50 homes actually were constructed by the Anaheim Hills developer during the three years that it raised money , mostly from elderly investors . Times staff writers James S . Granelli and Susan Christian in Orange County contributed to this report .</TEXT>
