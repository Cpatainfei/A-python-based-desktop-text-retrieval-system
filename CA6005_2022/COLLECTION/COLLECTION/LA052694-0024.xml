   <HEADLINE> REEL LIFE / FILM &amp; VIDEO FILE ; ' THREESOME ' EVOKES HOSTILE RESPONSE ; WITNESSES SAY HOMOPHOBIC INSULTS WERE SHOUTED DURING THE MOVIE , WHICH REVOLVES AROUND A LOVE ' TRIANGLE ' AMONG TWO MEN AND A WOMAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Homophobes in the audience at the Mann Buenaventura were scandalized at a recent showing of &quot; Threesome. &quot; The sexual coming-of-age movie that one reviewer described as &quot; Three ' s Company &quot; with a case of hot monkey love , revolves_around three college_students , two men and a woman , involved in a love triangle . This triangle is truly an equilateral one . He ' s hot for her . She ' s hot for the other , but the other is hot for him . Josh Charles plays the role of Eddy , a sensitive young_man , which in the Hollywood parlance generally equates to sexual confusion . His question_mark comes_in the form of Stephen Baldwin , who plays a jock with a crush on their female roommate , Lara Flynn Boyle . Witnesses said that 20 minutes into the film several male audience members started yelling &quot; homo &quot; and &quot; fag &quot; and , although there is no man-on-man sex in the film , one butt-grab sent some outraged male viewers cussing and fuming from the theater . With about 15 minutes left in the film , one man , unable to retain a tolerant attitude any longer , reportedly sprang from his chair saying , &quot; Oh my God , I can ' t stand this anymore &quot; and bolted . * &quot; Indochine &quot; is the Vietnam film Oliver Stone would have made if he were in touch with his feminine side . The story of a French colonial plantation_owner in Southeast_Asia is a woman ' s picture in the way &quot; Gone With the Wind &quot; was a woman ' s picture . Both have strong female characters who personify the decline of a system that ' s luxurious for a_few , while cruel to the many . Catherine Deneuve plays the plantation_owner who lives_in a Maugham-esque colonial paradise during a time of growing anti-colonial spirit . The film builds as the fate of an increasingly strife-torn country becomes intertwined with the personas of Deneuve and her adopted Vietnamese daughter , who are in_love with the same man . The Ojai Film Society is featuring &quot; Indochine &quot; as its Sunday film . The screening is set for 4:30 p.m. at the Ojai Playhouse , 145 E . Ojai Ave . Admission is $ 6 . * Century Theaters are screening an advertisement for mature audiences only . The chain ' s Century 8 Theater is playing a political ad for Frank Navarette , a candidate hoping to win a seat on the state Board of Equalization , a little-known body that sets tax_policy . Theater management , always obsessive about its image even as it shows films cheapening sex and exalting violence , was almost apologetic about the novel ad placement . &quot; As an equal access media , we can ' t turn anybody down , &quot; pleaded Century Media Advertisement Manager Alex Gorovitz . &quot; The only restriction is we can ' t put_on anything that is not compatible with family entertainment . Alcohol , tobacco or anything that ' s not morally right. &quot; we ' ll forgo the easy pick on the morality of elected officials and instead point_out that , because of adult subject_matter , the 26th Amendment to the Constitution made voting an NC-18 activity and therefore unsuitable for general admission .</TEXT>
