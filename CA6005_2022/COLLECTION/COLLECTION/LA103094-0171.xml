   <HEADLINE> TAKE A TEXAS Y ' ALL , AN HOMBRE OF EAST L.A. , UN POCO OF SPANISH : IT ' S TEJANO ; LINGUISTICS : FROM EAST TO WEST , NORTH TO SOUTH , MOTHER_TONGUES ARE GETTING STIRRED TOGETHER FOR EVERYDAY USE BY THE NATION ' S FAST-GROWING HISPANIC POPULATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s not strict English . Ni puro espanol . No , what ' s spoken here along la frontera is a mixture -- sometimes logical , sometimes goofy -- of two languages and two cultures . &quot; Our parents speak English and our grandparents hablan espanol , &quot; says &quot; Rock ' n ' Roll &quot; James Echavarria , a disc_jockey on bilingual radio_station KIWW . Rock ' n ' Roll James hits the airwaves with a rapid-fire delivery -- and no pauses between English and Spanish : &quot; KIWW 96 , the Valley ' s choice for hot tejano hits . Rock ' n ' Roll James acompanandoles , faltan como veinte y dos minutos para las dos de la tarde . And right now , we ' ve got some more jams . . . . &quot; From Queens to East Los Angeles , Miami to Detroit , Houston to Chicago and thousands of places in between , Spanish and English are getting stirred together in the everyday parlance of many among the nation ' s fast-growing Hispanic population . And as Rock ' n ' Roll James will tell you , it ' s become a hybrid dialect -- and a marketing tool -- here on the 2 # 000-mile U.S.-Mexico border . &quot; I learned all_of this by ear because I never really took Spanish class or anything like that , &quot; said the longhaired 27-year-old , who , despite his moniker , plays tejano music -- a mixture of Mexican ranchera and polka , with pop , country and Cuban influences thrown_in -- instead of rock ' n ' roll . &quot; It ' s sort of slang , tejano slang. &quot; After switching to a 60 % English , 40 % Spanish format featuring the popular tejano sound two years ago , KIWW jumped to No . 1 in the Lower Rio Grande Valley and remains one of the top stations . &quot; We ' re actually developing a new language , &quot; Rock ' n ' Roll James said . He calls it tejano . Others call it Spanglish , or Tex-Mex . Some English-only advocates might call it a threat . But unlike supporters of the Parti Quebecois , seeking to create a separatist French-speaking nation in eastern Canada , many Spanish speakers in the United States don ' t debate which language to speak . Instead , they ' re mixing both . Linguists call it &quot; code switching , &quot; and they say it ' s natural when people grow_up with two languages . &quot; It ' s done unconsciously , &quot; said Lucy Garcia Willis , head of the modern language department at the University of Texas-Brownsville . &quot; It gets the point across . Some people will frown_on it . But it ' s a cultural thing . It ' s probably gaining more and more acceptance. &quot; With proper grammar taking a back seat to convenience , some educators worry that generations of Hispanics are growing_up without knowing either language properly . But Mark Glazer , an anthropologist at the University of Texas-Pan American , views it as a long-term movement toward English . Glazer adds that English itself formed in a mixture , with strong influence from French and Germanic_languages . And it works both ways . English phrases are increasingly slipping into the Spanish and Portuguese spoken in Latin_America . Although Willis believes people should learn the proper grammar of both languages , she says there ' s often a grammatical logic behind many code-switching phrases . A Mexican-American mother , for example , might tell her daughter to put_on her red shoes : &quot; Ponte los red shoes. &quot; The mother may know the Spanish words for red shoes ( zapatos rojos or zapatos colorados ) , but it ' s easier to use the_English ones . And yet the mother says &quot; los &quot; red shoes instead of &quot; las &quot; red shoes because zapatos -- the Spanish word for shoes -- is masculine , not feminine . &quot; Some will consider it totally butchering the language , but keep_in mind the tendency of modern society for efficiency , saying things in as few words as possible , &quot; Willis said . So the verb &quot; to type &quot; ( escribir a maquina ) becomes &quot; taipiar , &quot; which doesn ' t exist in real Spanish . Windshield_wipers ( limpiaparabrisas ) become &quot; los winshi-waiper. &quot; &quot; Give me a ride &quot; becomes &quot; Dame un ride. &quot; &quot; I go_on break at 10:30 &quot; becomes &quot; Tengo el break a las 10:30. &quot; Tony Zavaleta , a UT Brownsville anthropologist who studies the border , says true code-switching -- with no interruption in thought -- takes more_than simply knowing both languages . It ' s the result of living in an environment like the Texas-Mexico border , where Spanish and English have meshed since the 1800s . &quot; It ' s a cultural foundation , and sense of ownership and place , to facilitate a person to switch_off languages , &quot; Zavaleta said . &quot; As we go_through the construction of a sentence at the speed_of_light , our minds are picking_up two vocabularies -- a vocabulary in English and a vocabulary in Spanish . &quot; English is better for describing science . Spanish is better for describing emotion. &quot; And while phrases like &quot; hasta la bye-bye &quot; may be taking things to a nonsensical extreme , people don ' t carry grammar books with them when they sit_down to eat fajitas and french fries . &quot; After all , it ' s not a matter of language , &quot; Zavaleta said . &quot; It ' s a matter of communication. &quot;</TEXT>
