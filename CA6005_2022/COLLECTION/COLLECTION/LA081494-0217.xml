   <HEADLINE> INESCAPABLE CONCERNS ; POROUS LANCASTER STATE_PRISON STILL DOESN ' T HAVE A WARDEN TO CALL ITS OWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tired of California ' s high unemployment_rate ( it ' s up_to 9 % ) and Los Angeles County ' s even more anemic showing , at 10 % ? Perhaps you could consider a career in corrections . Specifically , we ' re talking_about the job of prison warden . Apparently , there ' s something of a shortage of these folks . that ' s the impression we get from the ongoing game of musical chairs at the most porous maximum-security prison in the state in recent memory : California State Prison-Los Angeles County , in Lancaster . It ' s the only one to have had escapes by dangerous inmates this year and last year . First , John Ratelle ascended to the warden ' s chair in February , replacing the fellow in_charge during both of those escapes , Otis Thurman . Security was tightened during the Ratelle regime and no escapes were recorded , but we weren ' t exactly pleased to hear that Ratelle was still serving as warden of a state_prison in San Diego at the time , and traveling back there on weekends . Ratelle is now out . He has been replaced , also on an interim basis , by Donald R . Hill . But it turns_out that Hill has a divided attention_span as well and is still serving as warden of the California Correctional Institution at Tehachapi . Sure , an assistant is running day-to-day operations at Tehachapi , but Hill is the top_dog there and would be called during any disturbance . What gives ? Isn ' t there some kind of minor_league for prison wardens ? Aren ' t there credible assistant or deputy wardens out there , and why is it taking so_long to find one ? It helps that there have been no escapes_from Lancaster since January . The surrounding community , however , needs the additional reassurance of knowing that the place is being run_on a permanent , full-time basis by a warden whose attentions won ' t be diverted to another prison in some_other part of the state . Lancaster needs its own warden , and soon .</TEXT>
