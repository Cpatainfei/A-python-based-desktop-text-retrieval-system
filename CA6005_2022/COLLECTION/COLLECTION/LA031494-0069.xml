   <HEADLINE> KOHL ' S PARTY DEFEATED IN LOWER_SAXONY STATE VOTING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Germany ' s Social Democrats swept back into power in Lower_Saxony state Sunday , dealing Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s party a stinging defeat in the first of the country ' s 19 elections this year , German television said . According to a computer projection , the Social Democrats won 44.4 % , just above its score in 1990 , while Kohl ' s Christian Democrats slumped to 35.9 % from 42 % in the last election . It was the worst result since 1959 for the Christian Democrats in the northwestern state , Germany ' s third-largest , and a weak start for the embattled chancellor in his uphill drive for reelection in October . &quot; This is the day the twilight of the chancellor began in Bonn , &quot; said Green politician Juergen Trittin , the state ' s federal affairs minister . Rita Suessmuth , Bonn Parliament Speaker and a leading CDU politician , said : &quot; It is a bitter disappointment . It confirms that Bonn has had to make some hard decisions that did not necessarily appeal_to the voters. &quot; Kohl , chancellor since 1982 , is trailing his SPD national challenger Rudolf Scharping in opinion polls that show voter dissatisfaction with mounting unemployment and the high cost of Germany ' s reunification in 1990 . Rain and strong winds kept voter_turnout slightly lower during the day than in the 1990 poll , but chief election official Karl-Ludwig Strelen said turnout could reach the 1990 level of 74.6 % .</TEXT>
