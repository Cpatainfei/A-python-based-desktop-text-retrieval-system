   <HEADLINE> REEL LIFE ; BOMBAY BLOCKBUSTERS ARRIVE WITH SOME LONG STORIES TO TELL ; POPULAR INDIAN FILMS ARE BIG ON LOVE , MUSIC AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO VIEW THEM , AS A VISIT TO A SIMI VALLEY VIDEO STORE ATTESTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just about every story on the film_industry of India starts with the observation that India produces more films each year than any other country , including the United States . Fascinating though it may be , we won ' t repeat the fact yet again . We won ' t repeat it because it ' s self-evident after one visit to the India Movie Land video store in Simi Valley . More_than 1 # 000 titles line the shelves of the recently opened store . Owner Neeraj Newton said that represents roughly how many films his native country produces each year . &quot; Some of them have English subtitles , &quot; Newton said , &quot; but that ' s very rare . Most are in Hindi. &quot; Popular Indian films are star-driven , usually about romance , often musical and always long . &quot; The shortest I ever saw was exactly three hours , &quot; Newton said . &quot; Some are 4 1 / 2 hours or more. &quot; If you think that ' s a marathon , Newton said some dramatizations of classical Indian epics consume 20 to 25 tapes , each lasting three or more hours . The cinema is , after all , an escape in a country where many live under harsh economic_conditions . Describing the theater experience in India , Newton uses one word : &quot; Crowded. &quot; Indians have bought more_than a half-billion movie tickets since 1975 and that ' s just for one film , &quot; Sholay , &quot; an Indian takeoff on &quot; The Magnificent Seven. &quot; Most Americans know Indian cinema from director Satyajit Ray ' s small , moody films like the 1956 &quot; Pather Panchali , &quot; which is also known as &quot; Song of the Road , &quot; or the work of Mira Nair ( &quot; Salaam Bombay ! &quot; and &quot; Mississippi Masala &quot; ) . Popular Indian films are somewhat prudish . The nation that gave us the Kama Sutra doesn ' t permit nudity in its films . However rape scenes are almost de_rigueur . Bikram Singh , a prominent movie critic , described a typical rape scene this way to the New York Times : &quot; The actress is disrobed or stripped as she is chased from room to room by the villain . Actual sex or full nudity is never shown but the audience knows what is going_on , with screams from the woman and the camera focusing_on torn bits of dress and leering thugs. &quot; There are even character_actors who specialize in rape . One known as Ranjeet , said that in his countless films he has raped virtually every major actress in the Hindi-language film_industry . In the same article the the New York Times reported that women ' s groups are having more success in protesting such portrayals .</TEXT>
