   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : ANNUAL MUTUAL_FUND REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK ; STOCK ROCKET ; INVESTORS ENJOY GAINS FOR THIRD CONSECUTIVE YEAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The stock mutual_fund locomotive steamed ahead in 1993 , as small investors in the typical stock fund enjoyed a third consecutive annual gain . The average general U.S. stock fund rose 12.5 % for the year , significantly better than the 8.9 % average gain of 1992 and far above the 2.7 % that investors might have earned if they sat_out the often-volatile stock_market in favor of a money_market fund . The average stock fund gain also was better than the 10.1 % return ( stock price appreciation plus dividends ) in ' 93 on the Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 index , the benchmark of blue-chip_stock performance . For investors who diversified into foreign stock funds last year , the results were dramatically better : The average international fund rocketed 39.4 % for the year , marking the first year since 1986 that foreign funds have outperformed U.S. stock funds . The annual fund rankings , reported Tuesday by fund tracker Lipper Analytical Services in New York , will most likely gratify many of the small investors who channeled an unprecedented wave of cash into stock funds in 1993 . But investors also should realize that that cash wave helped create its own reward : As more money flowed into stock funds , fund managers pumped it into stocks , pushing the market up and thereby attracting new investors . One measure of the market ' s powerful and broad advance is that not a single category of stock funds lost ground last year ; the worst-performing category , environmental funds ( which own stocks of pollution-control companies ) , rose 3.4 % for the year on average . Whether the bullish cycle can repeat in 1994 is anyone ' s guess , of course . In the fourth quarter , there were signs that fund managers themselves were growing wary of many high-flying growth_stocks -- in such fields as telecommunications and gaming -- that had led the market earlier in the year . As the funds stopped buying those stocks , many of the shares sank -- which sparked a setback in the broader stock_market in November . That , in turn , caused some small investors to turn skittish : Net new cash flows into stock funds fell 35 % from October to November . Nonetheless , many Wall Streeters believe the stock_market and thus many stock funds have at least an even_chance of advancing again in ' 94 , if the economy continues to grow without a sharp rise in inflation or interest_rates . But even the most optimistic fund managers now warn that the market will be a much tougher game in 1994 and that a fund ' s performance will depend almost entirely on a manager ' s ability to pick the right stocks , rather than simply bet_on riding the broad market higher . Indeed , growth_stock funds -- the most-owned category of funds -- may have provided in 1993 an early hint of what ' s to come : The average growth_stock fund gained 10.6 % last year , the poorest performance ( relatively speaking ) of any major fund category . Michael Lipper , head of Lipper Analytical , said the problem for the growth funds was that many of those fund managers were unwilling to part_with consumer products stocks in such fields as drugs , food and tobacco , even as the stocks crumbled because of rising competition and loss of brand-name pricing power . The 12.5 % average stock fund return , meanwhile , was a product of the continuing strong performance of smaller stocks . The average small-company fund rose 17 % , the third straight year in which small-stock funds beat more conservative blue-chip funds , such_as equity-income funds . Many Wall Streeters believe small stocks are in the middle of a five- to seven-year cycle of outperforming blue-chips , as the economy ' s growth remains moderate -- an environment that is believed to be tougher on bigger companies than on more nimble and opportunistic smaller ones . Elsewhere , the surge in international stock_markets , fed_in large part by U.S. investors ' cash , is expected to continue in 1994 , but not at the same torrid pace . And the potential for a temporary pullback in those streaking markets is extremely high , many analysts say . In fact , the peasant rebellion in Mexico this week has provided novice international investors with their first taste of what can go_wrong in thinly traded foreign markets . Mexican stocks plunged nearly 4 % on Monday before rebounding somewhat Tuesday . Still , many experts believe that international markets in_general have better long-term prospects than the mature U.S. market . And given U.S. stocks ' three-year run , investors may have little choice in their pursuit of higher returns than to target foreign stocks and other market niches that have only recently begun to rally .
