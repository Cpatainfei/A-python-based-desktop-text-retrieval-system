   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; POST-QUAKE TRAFFIC ROUTES TAKE A BEATING ; TRANSPORTATION : ROADS THAT WITHSTOOD THE SHAKING ARE NOW BEING BATTERED BY CARAVANS OF DIVERTED COMMUTERS AND RAINS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Surface streets that withstood the initial battering of the Northridge earthquake are now taking a daily pounding from overflowing traffic diverted from crumbled freeways . Long lines of cars and trucks are traveling on roads unprepared to handle such weight and volume , according to Santa Clarita city officials and traffic engineers . &quot; We ' ve already seen the damage along Lyons Avenue when traffic is diverted off of I-5 , &quot; said Gail Foy , the city ' s public information officer , noting one of several streets showing the strain of post-quake traffic . Santa Clarita has tallied $ 6.8 million in damages to its roads so far , and officials expect the figure to climb as more complete repair estimates come_in . Adding_to the damages are the recent rains that have soaked city streets . &quot; The rains don ' t help , &quot; Foy said . &quot; The trucks come_by and weaken the street , then the rains come and weaken them even more. &quot; The following Santa Clarita thoroughfares have borne the brunt of the traffic rerouted since the Northridge earthquake : * Sierra Highway . When debris from the earthquake still blocked the Golden State Freeway , this street parallel to the Antelope Valley Freeway was the only southern route for commuters from the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys . All four lanes were temporarily designated for southbound travel in the mornings . Traffic now runs in both directions again , but an additional lane has been striped to improve the commute . * San Fernando Road . As one of the two primary roads that feed onto Sierra Highway and a designated truck route , this was the first street in the center of the city to be packed with cars following the quake . A left-hand turn lane is to be installed this week for northbound traffic turning onto Lyons Avenue that should help evening driving , said Bahman Janka , a city traffic engineer . * Soledad Canyon Road / Valencia Boulevard . Santa Clarita ' s only major east-west thoroughfare , it often crawls bumper-to-bumper during peak times , but blockage of the Golden State and Antelope Valley interchange has sent hundreds more drivers cutting_through the city . City engineers hope to better synchronize traffic_signals along the thoroughfare to ease congestion along the route . &quot; We ' re going to be taking_a_look at the whole signal system along Soledad Canyon Road to see what we can do , &quot; Janka said . * Lyons Avenue . Because it is a connection to the jammed San Fernando Road and with the parallel Soledad Canyon Road packed to the north , many drivers are trying to cut_across this east-west road . Trucks rarely crossed this road before the quake but now travel it frequently . As they have done with most expenses incurred as Santa Clarita deals with quake damage , city officials plan to ask the Federal Emergency Management Agency to reimburse repair costs . Cities are eligible to apply for federal funds for secondary damage to streets from the Jan . 17 earthquake , according to Harry Sherwood , who reviews street and public works claims for FEMA . &quot; It could be said this damage is directly the result of the earthquake , &quot; Sherwood said . &quot; The freeway is down , and that traffic definitely has to go somewhere. &quot; Even if Santa Clarita is reimbursed for repairs , that doesn ' t make the commute any shorter or the roads any smoother in the meantime . Overflow traffic is expected to continue clogging surface streets for the months it takes_to repair damage to the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways . &quot; We ' re going to be impacted by that for a very long_time , &quot; Janka said .</TEXT>
