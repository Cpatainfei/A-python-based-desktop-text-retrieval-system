   <HEADLINE> MUTUAL_FUNDS / RUSS WILES : THOUGH NOT QUITE CHILD ' S PLAY , PORTFOLIO OFFERS SOMETHING NEW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With something on the order of 5 # 000 mutual_funds available today , it ' s getting harder for fund companies to come_out with unique products or services . But a new portfolio from Chicago-based Stein Roe Mutual_Funds does just that , and it also manages to target a neglected shareholder group : children . The Stein Roe Young Investor Fund , which opened May 9 , has a dual mission . It sees itself as a vehicle for financing a child ' s future college education and as a way to get youngsters excited about the investment process . The first angle is nothing new . All sorts of mutual_funds can be used for college planning . Equity funds in particular work well for younger children because of the greater long-term returns associated with the stock_market . More conservative bond and even money_market portfolios make_sense for teens who know they will need to drain the account within a_couple_of years . The second angle , of trying to involve kids in the investment process , is unusual . &quot; Education that deals with investing , mutual_funds and financial planning is underrepresented at the high_school and junior_high levels , &quot; says Kenneth W . Corba , one of the three portfolio managers for the Young Investor Fund and a former high_school English_teacher . Corba says his first definition of success with the Young Investor Fund would be to outperform the Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 index . &quot; After that , I ' d like to light a spark or create an interest among kids in the stock_market and individual companies around them , &quot; he says . The main way Stein Roe intends to do this is by holding recognizable stocks in the portfolio , especially &quot; companies that appeal_to or affect the lives of children or teen-agers , &quot; as the prospectus , or legal disclosure document , puts it . Three of the bigger holdings -- Procter &amp; Gamble , Microsoft and Motorola -- show that management reserves the right to interpret its mandate liberally . But more identifiable kid-related stocks such_as Toys R Us , McDonald ' s , Walt Disney Co . and Coca Cola have also been included . Most of the holdings will be large growth companies characterized by higher profitability and lower dividend yields than the Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 . But the fund isn ' t restricted from owning smaller stocks . &quot; We ' re even looking_to get some small-stock ideas from kids , &quot; says Corba . The fund ' s budding capitalists will get a quarterly newsletter and an expanded annual report featuring games and articles designed for young investors . Other odds and ends will include an investment primer for teens and adults , and a short financial coloring_book for younger children . The fund ' s prospectus , it should be noted , is a bit easier to read than many such documents but is hardly Dr. Seuss material . The Young Investor Fund is marketed directly by Stein Roe ( ( 800 ) 403-KIDS ) , without a sales charge or load . The company estimates the fund ' s operating expenses will run 1 % annually , which would make_it a bit less costly than the average growth-stock portfolio . The minimum investment is $ 2 # 500 , or $ 1 # 000 in a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act account , which is applicable in California . UTMAs are an easy way to hold assets in a child ' s name under the supervision of a parent or other adult custodian . The money in the account , even if given by an adult , becomes the kid ' s property , which means he or she might decide not to use it for educational purposes . The child gains access to the money upon becoming an adult . Before then , the custodian oversees the account . There is a potential tax_advantage to putting assets in a child ' s name . Depending_on the youngster ' s age and investment income , some or all_of that income might be tax-free , and the rest could be taxable at the child ' s lower rate . Stein Roe ' s product joins a short_list of funds that have been designed for under-age shareholders . Of these , Twentieth Century Giftrust , based in Kansas City , Mo. , remains the most unusual . This no-load fund gives new meaning to the idea of investing for the long_haul . Money placed in the fund can ' t be touched for 10 years or until the child becomes an adult , whichever is further down the road . Donors can specify even lengthier investment commitments . Because of these restrictions , Giftrust ( ( 800 ) 345-2021 ) has been slow to catch_on . It counts just $ 179 million in assets despite having the No . 1 performance record for any mutual_fund over the 10 years through March 31 , 1994 . The fund holds aggressive growth_stocks for which a long horizon is generally desirable . The minimum investment is $ 250 . One more wrinkle : Giftrust itself , rather than parents or kids , pays the taxes on yearly dividends and capital_gains out of the fund ' s assets . Twentieth Century also has a separate UTMA plan , in which the company will automatically shift an investor ' s money from its Select stock fund to a money_market portfolio as the youngster nears college age . A few other mutual_fund groups offer college planning incentives , typically in the form of lower minimum investments . For example , Boston-based Fidelity Investments ( ( 800 ) 544-8888 ) drops the normal $ 2 # 500 minimum on its Asset Manager , Blue_Chip Growth and Growth &amp; Income funds to $ 1 # 000 for people setting_up UTMA accounts . It also waives the normal 3 % sales charge on the latter two funds ( Asset Manager is a no-load portfolio anyway ) . Fidelity shareholders willing to set_up an automatic investment plan can participate for as little as $ 100 . * The Investment_Company Institute has proposed voluntary guidelines that it predicts will help eliminate confusion over inconsistent use of A , B , C and D classes of shares among fund companies . The Washington-based trade organization is recommending that front-end load funds be designated as A shares , while B shares would be those on which an investor pays a 12b-1 fee in combination with a declining back-end charge . The C and D shares would be two alternate types of &quot; level-load &quot; pricing schemes making use of 12b-1 fees ; a front-end charge would apply to the D shares but not the C . There also would be less-costly X and Y classes of shares , reserved for institutional investors and fund company employees , respectively . Still confused ? Then consider no-load funds , on which multiple classes of shares don ' t apply . * The stock_market might still look expensive to a lot of people , but fund companies continue to introduce new portfolios with a bargain-hunting slant . One such product is the 4-month-old John Hancock Special Value Fund , headquartered in Boston but managed by Charles H . Womack of NM Capital Management in Albuquerque , N.M. Despite an emphasis on neglected , out-of-favor stocks trading at low price-to-book values , Womack says he ' s still finding plenty of companies in which to invest . Favorites include Boeing , Precision Castparts , Adolph Coors and the Brown Group . Womack says some of the better buys are among smaller stocks . &quot; that ' s where we ' re finding the values. &quot; He ' s also predicting upside earnings surprises this year and next . * The Vanguard Group of Valley Forge , Pa. , is offering a free 20-page booklet that outlines the basics of asset allocation . The publication illustrates long-term risks and returns for various asset categories , using information compiled by Ibbotson Associates of Chicago . The &quot; Vanguard Investment Planner &quot; can be ordered by calling ( 800 ) 523-8552 .</TEXT>
