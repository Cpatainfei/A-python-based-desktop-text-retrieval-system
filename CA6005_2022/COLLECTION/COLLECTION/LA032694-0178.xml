   <HEADLINE> EUROPE MAY EASE BARRIERS TO U.S. ENTERTAINMENT ; TRADE : A EUROPEAN UNION OFFICIAL ' S COMMENTS ARE_WELL RECEIVED BY A U.S. FILM_INDUSTRY OFFICIAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a sign that Europe could ease barriers limiting Hollywood ' s access to the Continent ' s entertainment market , a senior European Union official Friday declared that the union plans to move away from protectionist measures that prop_up its struggling audiovisual sector . Colette Flesch , director general of the EU Executive Commission ' s cultural affairs department , indicated that only a new , aggressive global strategy to promote its own entertainment products can guarantee the sector ' s long-term survival . &quot; Europe has no alternative but to develop a coherent global strategy if it wants its industry to survive and develop , &quot; she told a seminar on the media here . &quot; It is in this context that the Commission . . . aims at presenting both governments and professionals with options not to increase protectionism , but to give a new dynamic perspective to the European audiovisual sector. &quot; Flesch ' s remarks reflected a growing realization on this side of the Atlantic that protectionist measures , aimed mainly at restricting the access of U.S. films to Europe , had not just failed to protect Europe ' s film_industry but also seriously weakened it . Franklin Tonini , vice_president of the Motion_Picture Export Assn . of America ' s European office here , applauded the general direction of Flesch ' s comments . &quot; We warmly endorse what she said , &quot; he said . &quot; We in the United States are prepared to cooperate with the Europeans. &quot; The tone and content of Flesch ' s speech mark a dramatic shift of thinking in a region that has come_to see generous state subsidies for local films , as well as quotas and other restrictions on foreign productions , as essential for the industry ' s survival . In 1992 , European films were supported by government subsidies totaling more_than $ 700 million . Despite these subsidies , those movies have failed to gain much audience support , with attendance figures declining at a time when attendance for U.S. films in Europe is stable . Another reason for the proposed strategy shift , EU officials admit , is that advances in audiovisual technology are increasingly likely to undermine protectionist measures . &quot; European directors need to start making films for people , not just for themselves , &quot; said Ivan Hodac , vice_president of Time Warner Europe . He claimed that about half of Europe ' s subsidized films never reach the theaters . Flesch ' s comments carry added significance because they come as the EU starts an in-depth review of the region ' s audiovisual sector . A formal discussion paper carrying much of the flavor of Flesch ' s remarks is scheduled to be approved by the commission within the next few weeks . The paper will probably then become the focus of an industry conference , to be held here in May and called by Joao de Deus Pinheiro , EU cultural affairs commissioner . Times staff writer James Bates in Los Angeles contributed to this report .</TEXT>
