   <HEADLINE> THE G-MAN , THE SHRIMP SCAM AND SACRAMENTO ' S BIG STING ; FBI_AGENT JAMES WEDICK ' S UNDERCOVER OPERATION NETTED 14 PUBLIC OFFICIALS . BUT HAS IT CHANGED THE WAY THE STATE LEGISLATURE WORKS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the prosecution table in a wood-paneled federal courtroom in Sacramento sits FBI_agent James J . Wedick Jr . His suit and tie are as drab as any plainclothes cop ' s , but there is something that sets him apart : the long brown hair , flecked with gray ; the salt-and-pepper beard ; the half-glasses that give him an almost scholarly air . For nearly a decade , through endless stakeouts , a failed marriage and bureaucratic hurdles , Wedick , 44 , has spearheaded the most ambitious political corruption investigation in California history . Infiltrating the world of back-room deals and $ 1 # 000-a-plate dinners , he and his team snared five lawmakers , Sacramento ' s top lobbyist , a coastal commissioner and various aides . So far , they have not lost a case . At the defense table is state Sen . Frank C . Hill . From the moment he was elected to the Assembly in 1982 at the age of 28 , Hill seemed ticketed for statewide office . Popular with his colleagues , the Whittier lawmaker was in the inner_circle of the Assembly Republican leadership , and he regularly lunched with the governor . Handsome . Brash . Always smiling . A prodigious fund-raiser . But Hill now faces charges that he extorted $ 2 # 500 from an undercover_agent . His political career is in shreds , his legal bills mounting , and each of the three counts of extortion , money_laundering and conspiracy against him carries a maximum prison_term of 20 years . As the lead-off witness against Hill last May , Wedick tells jurors that 12 years earlier , a &quot; cooperating witness &quot; told him that $ 30 # 000 could buy special-interest legislation in California . Wedick was happy to hear it , because he realized he had an opportunity to prove that lawmaking in the nation ' s most populous state was for_sale . It confirmed his worst suspicions that California ' s reputation for squeaky clean politics was a facade , that it was as unsavory as the old Tammany_Hall in his native New York City . Why was it necessary , the prosecutor asks him , to set_up a phony shrimp business to ensnare Hill and other legislators ? It ' s the nature of the crime , Wedick instructs the jurors . In a bank robbery , the FBI is notified almost instantaneously . But political corruption is harder to detect . If a lobbyist &quot; bribed a state legislator , &quot; he says , &quot; he is not likely to report it to us and neither is the legislator. &quot; When Hill ' s lawyer takes his turn , he tries to get Wedick to discredit a former Hill aide named Karin Watson , who is expected to provide crucial testimony . The lawyer presses Wedick to admit that the FBI entrapped Watson by plying her with expensive champagne . Wedick concedes that during secretly recorded conversations , Watson &quot; sounded like she had a lot to drink. &quot; The defense_attorney shoots back , &quot; Didn ' t that concern you ? &quot; Wedick , an experienced witness , turns the question into an opportunity to slam Hill . &quot; My chief concern was that I had a criminal violation , &quot; he bristles . Watson , he points_out , &quot; arranged for Frank Hill to co-author a bill for $ 10 # 000 long before &quot; she was given champagne by an undercover informant . Almost 100 miles southwest of the courthouse lies the Federal Prison_Camp at Dublin . A neatly landscaped flower_garden greets visitors to the complex of refurbished Army barracks that house the 300 nonviolent , white-collar inmates . Assigned four to a room , prisoners can place their own phone_calls and spend as much as $ 165 a month at the commissary on such items as typewriter_ribbon and perfume oils . There ' s no razor wire or chain link encircling the facility . In fact , there ' s no fence at all . The camp has become a satellite of the state Capitol . On a recent day , former Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan , now prisoner 06833-097 , scurries up a staircase , flashing a smile . A bulletin_board lists former Coastal Commissioner Mark L . Nathanson -- dubbed &quot; commissioner to the stars &quot; because of the help he offered prominent Hollywood figures -- as a member of the prison ' s Toastmasters Club . So is onetime Assembly aide Tyrone Netters . Ex-legislative aide Darryl Freeman is also at the camp . Clayton R . Jackson , a hulking former college football_player who became the Capitol ' s top lobbyist , waits for a visit from state Sen . Nicholas C . Petris . Jackson and the four others at Dublin are among the 12 public officials arrested , indicted and convicted in Wedick ' s undercover operation . They once shaped the laws of California . Today , they are cutting weeds , fixing toilets or cooking meals , serving an average of four years in prison . Like them , Hill advanced his career in a political culture that relies_on hefty campaign contributions as the currency of political action . Wedick breached that system and exposed how fund-raising is interwoven into the fabric of lawmaking and can be a form of bribery . His zealotry has made him perhaps the most hated man in Sacramento . Defenders of Hill and others targeted by the FBI assail Wedick as a rogue agent who abused the powers of the federal_government . Sacramento lawyer Donald H . Heller , Jackson ' s attorney , describes Wedick as &quot; a very aggressive agent . I think his greatest strength is his greatest failing . He ' s so dogged in his pursuit of truth that anything that doesn ' t fit his view must be a lie. &quot; But a_few lobbyists and reformers voice admiration for Wedick , saying he has inspired a long overdue housecleaning and revealed the inherently corrupting nature of fund-raising . Perhaps , more_than anything else , Wedick ' s investigation has given Californians a disturbing view of how they govern themselves . Late on a summer evening , James Wedick -- Jimmy to some of his friends -- is still at_work in a 12-foot-square , windowless room in the FBI ' s Sacramento office . As a special_agent , he earns about $ 80 # 000 a year , including two hours a day of mandatory &quot; overtime , &quot; but he works even longer , usually by himself . Battered file_cabinets , sagging steel shelves and cardboard boxes hem_in the table that serves as his desk . Wedick ' s colleagues jokingly call his room &quot; the_pit &quot; or &quot; the vortex. &quot; It seems a suitable home for an agent known for his obsessiveness . For as long as he can remember , Wedick says , he wanted to be an FBI_agent . At 14 , he even wrote the bureau for career guidance . But his request for information was mistaken as a job_application , triggering a call from a recruiter who wanted to sign him up immediately . It took Wedick almost 10 minutes to straighten_out the FBI official , who ended the conversation abruptly after promising to send a copy of &quot; The FBI Story. &quot; Wedick , who was raised in the_Bronx , is the son of a New York City Fire_Department battalion chief . He landed his first FBI job at the age of 20 -- as a part-time clerk . He later began working 40 hours a week while pursuing a degree at Fordham University . Living_on Staten Island at the time , he caught_up on his sleep on subways and ferries while commuting four hours a day . &quot; that ' s what my father taught me , &quot; Wedick says . &quot; It was the work ethic all_the way. &quot; He became an agent at 23 , the youngest in his training class . What he liked about the job was the action , the rush of apprehending hard-core criminals . &quot; I personally never wanted to work white-collar crime and public corruption , &quot; he says . He was chasing bank robbers and fugitives in the late 1970s in Gary , Ind. , when a fellow agent , a gregarious Southerner named John E . ( Jack ) Brennan , asked him to help_out in an undercover , white-collar crime case . &quot; I will only work this one case , &quot; Wedick told his friend . The case , code-named Operation Fountain_Pen , &quot; got bigger and bigger , until it consumed me , &quot; he says . Wedick hasn ' t worked bank robbery since . The chief target was Phil Kitzer , a Minnesota swindler who specialized in selling worthless securities from phantom offshore enterprises with names like the First City National_Bank of Haiti . ( One of Kitzer ' s claims was that he participated in the theft -- by fraud -- of Elvis Presley ' s private jet. ) For 10 months , an unsuspecting Kitzer flew Brennan and Wedick around the world , introducing them to , among others , a New York mobster who once threatened to throw the pair out of a hotel window . After intense days of posing as a con_artist , Brennan would want to leave the office and relax with his family . Wedick , on the other hand , would stay until 2 in the morning . Others who worked with him were struck that he was able to go from morning to night without stopping to eat . Wedick agrees that his job is &quot; almost like an addiction , &quot; leading to the dissolution of his first marriage . Operation Fountain_Pen ended with the conviction of dozens of con_men across the country , including Kitzer . It spawned another , more renowned sting operation , Abscam , which deployed agents and informants , some disguised as Arab royalty , as bait for grifters and -- as it turned_out -- members of Congress . Wedick had blown his cover by then so he was merely a supporting player in Abscam , but the case gave him his first taste of exposing political corruption . And he was hooked . The bureau , fearing mob reprisals from Operation Fountain_Pen , reassigned him to Sacramento in 1978 . As he was settling in , Wedick received a tip from Marv Levin , then a consultant with a nonprofit agency that issued government-guaranteed loans to small businesses . The two had struck_up a friendship soon after Wedick arrived in Sacramento , sometimes meeting in a local park while tending their children . ( Wedick ' s son from his first marriage is now a teen-ager ; he also has a preschool-aged daughter. ) Levin , who had done some lobbying , told Wedick of conversations with an Assembly aide who claimed that legislation could be bought for a price in the state Capitol . Levin , who had been a whistle-blower while working for the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture in Washington , had a sharpened sense of outrage at a state_government that he regarded_as corrupt . Wedick says Levin ' s news didn ' t surprise him . An FBI probe in the late ' 70s of the Capitol had ended without any convictions . But Wedick realized that if he could persuade Levin to wear a hidden recording device -- a wire -- then he might be able to get the proof he needed to launch an investigation that would nail corrupt politicians . For three years , while Wedick worked_on a series of high-profile white-collar cases , he ruminated about ways to infiltrate the Legislature , sometimes talking it over with Brennan , now assigned to Mobile , Ala . While driving by a Sacramento fish market specializing in shrimp , the pair concocted the idea of setting_up a bogus business that would import gourmet shrimp from the Gulf_of_Mexico to a growing market in Northern California . The home_office would be established in Mobile . The company would need a special-interest measure to help it qualify for a loan guaranteed by the state . Undercover operatives would then approach lawmakers and their aides for help in moving their bill through the system . If the officials were corrupt -- if payoffs were necessary -- the FBI would write the checks . All conversations and transactions would be taped -- the kind of evidence that juries could not ignore . Officials at FBI headquarters were intrigued by the scheme , but initially turned it down . The federal_government had never authorized an operation that pushed phony legislation as a way to catch crooked state lawmakers ; there was also concern that the investigation would be an unwarranted intervention by the federal_government into state politics . Still , Wedick persisted , arguing that an undercover operation was the only way to penetrate a political_system that has its own code of silence . &quot; From Day One , the bureau was leery about getting involved with a state Legislature in this kind of intrusive way , &quot; Wedick says . In October , 1985 , with the help of two assistant U.S. attorneys , David F . Levi and George L . O ' Connell , Wedick got the go-ahead from the Justice_Department for the investigation , which included $ 100 # 000 for bribes . The project was code-named Brispec , for bribery-special interest , but later , when it became public , the press dubbed it &quot; shrimpscam. &quot; So concerned was FBI headquarters over the sting that it gave Wedick and the prosecutors only six months to show that they could deliver . During the next three years , &quot; ( t ) here were several times that tempers exploded and we really thought at several junctures that the thing was just going_to blow_up , &quot; says former Assistant U.S. Atty . John P . Panneton , who prosecuted the first of the Brispec cases . &quot; Wedick and his crew would basically have to justify continuing the operation and ( the Department_of_Justice ) didn ' t want to pay any more money. &quot; Wedick spent months setting_up the bogus business , fussing over every detail . There were corporate papers to draw_up , a checking_account to open , stationery to print and phony correspondence to generate . Brennan would become John E . Gordon , president of Gulf Shrimp Fisheries , Inc. on Airport Boulevard in Mobile , and the secretary-treasurer of the corporation would be Gordon ' s invented brother , James J . Gordon -- none other_than James J . Wedick . As the probe moved fitfully , Wedick relied_on his friend Marv Levin . Overweight and with a history of heart problems , Levin doesn ' t look_like a spy . In fact , he is something of a klutz -- he once failed to change the batteries on his FBI-issued pager because he didn ' t want to waste the government ' s money . Tapping into his experience as a lobbyist , Levin helped Wedick craft the bill so that it was customized for one company only -- Gulf Shrimp Fisheries . To qualify for a low-interest loan , according to the proposal , a company had to &quot; import to the State of California low-fat , high-protein foodstuffs that are not native to the coast and State of California. &quot; Only such businesses in the counties of Sacramento or Yolo -- where Gulf Shrimp had its local office -- need apply . The legislative aides who helped maneuver the measure around procedural barriers were soon soliciting money for themselves and their bosses ' campaigns , and agent Brennan was ready to comply . Securing the required approval from Washington on short notice , though , proved difficult . Wedick and his Sacramento boss , Terry Knowles , recall frantic attempts in August , 1986 , to reach FBI Director William H . Webster for approval to make $ 28 # 000 in payoffs . Calling through the night , they were finally able to persuade an assistant director to authorize the payment , just hours before the 8 a.m. meeting . In all , Wedick and his team paid_out $ 60 # 000 in bribes in 1986 , and before they were done , they would shell_out at least $ 25 # 000 more . The bill passed , but as had been agreed , the FBI tipped_off then Gov . George Deukmejian about the sting and he vetoed the legislation . Prosecutors thought they had accumulated sufficient evidence to indict at least four individuals , including one prominent legislator -- Sen . Paul B . Carpenter , a Democrat from Cypress , and one of his top aides , John A . Shahabian . But no arrests were made so that the probe could remain secret . Authorities realized they needed to &quot; flip &quot; one of the insiders they had caught in the act and use him to further penetrate the Legislature ' s corruption . Wedick and prosecutors debated who would be likely to cooperate . They settled_on Shahabian . A chunk of a man with strikingly dark hair and a mustache , he was independent-minded with few illusions about the Legislature . He was also a devoted father and regularly attended the Armenian Apostolic Church . Most important , he was not likely to put loyalty to his boss ahead of_his_own and his family ' s interests . Marv Levin was now about to perform his most sensitive undercover job . Levin , who in real_life was pushing to develop a posh marina in West Sacramento , prevailed on Shahabian to join him for an unusual 7 a.m. meeting on Sept . 10 , 1987 , with federal fish and game officials , supposedly to iron_out differences over the Gulf Shrimp Fisheries project . Arriving_at a federal_office complex in suburban Sacramento , Shahabian entered what appeared to be the office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , complete with a large seal on the entry door . Levin led the legislative aide into an unmarked suite of offices . He vanished and Shahabian was met by someone he describes as &quot; a striking woman , &quot; who flashed an FBI badge and greeted him by name . The agent was Nancy Eddington , who had recently been assigned to Wedick ' s team . ( Three years later , Eddington and Wedick were married. ) Shahabian was supposed to think that agents had been working around the clock to nail him . To heighten the illusion , agents had not shaved and had extinguished dozens of cigarettes in boxes of stale pizza . There were also audio and photographic props . An anxious Shahabian faintly could hear secretly taped conversations of himself and Levin . Blown-up surveillance photos were tacked_on the walls , showing him with his children . Another shot showed him accepting a sizable campaign contribution . After a_few minutes , he was taken_to the office of the FBI ' s special_agent in_charge , Terry Knowles . Reciting from a carefully constructed script , Knowles told Shahabian , &quot; This is the most important day of your life. &quot; Shahabian remembers thinking to himself , &quot; It ' s shaping_up to be a pretty bad day. &quot; After Knowles finished making his pitch , Shahabian was guided into a room , where he met Wedick . Shahabian , who was told that he could face a possible 20-year prison_term , decided to talk . &quot; I had nothing but my wits against an array of agents and U.S. attorneys , &quot; he now says . &quot; Wedick was basically the bad cop . It was his job to stay in my face . He ' s not a friendly guy . Not a backslapper or a charmer. &quot; Shahabian recalls Wedick badgering him to make a commitment , like a prison_camp commandant pressing a POW to cooperate . Wedick doesn ' t deny that he was blunt and confrontational . &quot; At different times , John would change his story from basically admitting it to not admitting it to admitting it. &quot; At the end of 15 hours -- during which he was repeatedly told that he could leave if he wanted -- Shahabian agreed to cooperate . This is Wedick ' s specialty , his niche in the bureau . He is the inquisitor , the tough_guy who works to &quot; turn &quot; miscreants into willing allies . Typically , once they commit , he becomes &quot; a soft guy , &quot; their best_friend , their confidant and protector , for the life of the investigation . Prosecutor O ' Connell , now a private attorney , describes Wedick ' s talent &quot; as father confessor , as rabbi with all_the characters he deals with. &quot; Shahabian provided testimony that contributed to Carpenter ' s downfall and vital introductions that led to the prosecution of Hill and others . He was granted immunity from prosecution . But in the spring of 1993 , Shahabian accused Wedick and other authorities of &quot; unethical police methods &quot; and &quot; deceit. &quot; He charges that Wedick distorted transcripts of his secretly recorded conversations and deleted key passages . Wedick , who steadfastly has denied any improprieties , still wonders why he couldn ' t befriend Shahabian the same way he did other informants . He still gets calls from con_man Kitzer . Ex-legislative aide Karin Watson hugged Wedick warmly after she was only sentenced to probation in exchange for her testimony against Hill . Whatever Shahabian ' s misgivings , his hundreds of hours of secretly recorded conversations with lawmakers and their aides were exactly what the authorities needed to prove criminal wrongdoing . Quoting from the tapes , Wedick persuaded a federal magistrate to allow a historic 1988 raid on the Capitol offices of Frank Hill , then an assemblyman , and three other lawmakers , Assemblyman Pat Nolan ( R-Glendale ) , Sen . Joseph B . Montoya ( D-Whittier ) and Assemblywoman Gwen Moore ( D-Los Angeles ) . Moore was the only one not prosecuted . &quot; This is Jim Wedick . Today ' s date is July 10th , Wednesday , 1991 . The time is approximately 7:39 a.m. in the morning . I ' m with Alan Robbins . He ' s going_to , he ' s about to meet with Clay Jackson at the El Rancho Hotel. &quot; With this terse send-off , Wedick directed Robbins , a San Fernando Valley Democratic senator , to a breakfast meeting with Jackson , a cigar-chomping , 6-foot-6 , 300-pound attorney . Corporate clients paid Jackson ' s firm , SRJ Jackson , Barish &amp; Associates , more_than $ 2 million a year to represent their interests in the state Legislature , making_it the highest-grossing lobbying firm at the Capitol . Wearing a wire and transmitter , Robbins walked into the aging West Sacramento motel for his rendezvous with Jackson . Wedick and two prosecutors parked nearby to eavesdrop . Just a month earlier during a meeting at the Hyatt Regency hotel , Robbins had agreed to cooperate with Wedick . The FBI ' s suspicions about him were aroused during the fight over the 1986 shrimp bill , when an aide to the senator solicited a $ 500 contribution from Gulf Shrimp Fisheries . But Robbins wasn ' t targeted by Wedick until several years later , when a San Diego hotel developer charged that the senator had extorted $ 250 # 000 from him . What clinched the case was Wedick ' s discovery that Robbins was laundering this and other payoffs , directing the money to a stable of girlfriends , including a stripper and a former prostitute , on the payroll of a Santa Monica public relations firm . Savvy , intelligent , manipulative , the deeply tanned and well-dressed Robbins irritated his colleagues with his brashness almost from the moment he arrived in Sacramento in 1973 . Robbins , who made millions of dollars as a land developer , seemed to always have a hidden agenda . In 1981 , his career was almost derailed when he faced charges that he had had_sex with two 16-year-old girls . He was acquitted and his legislative career thrived as he raised huge contributions from the insurance industry and other special_interests . As a champion fund-raiser , Robbins was tolerated by his colleagues , even though he was one of the most disliked members of the Legislature . So it came as no surprise that he was a target of prosecutors . Confronted with overwhelming evidence , Robbins signed_on as an enthusiastic member of Wedick ' s team , agreeing to plead guilty and cooperate in exchange for a lighter sentence . Over breakfast with Jackson , he would try to get the insurance lobbyist to put a price on a worker ' s compensation bill important to his clients . As Jackson was about to have his coffee refilled , Robbins asked him for &quot; a quantification &quot; of what he was prepared to pay_for his help on the bill . &quot; You mean how important it is to the comp people ? &quot; Jackson asked a_few seconds later . &quot; Yes. &quot; &quot; Immense . . . I could probably put something together on this in two days. &quot; &quot; Such_as ? &quot; &quot; Maybe a quarter ? &quot; The shorthand phrase -- an offer of a $ 250 # 000 bribe -- was what the prosecutors needed to convict Jackson , who is now appealing . Jackson ' s attorney , Donald H . Heller , repeatedly objected to the FBI ' s use of Robbins , an admitted felon , as an undercover operative . The most vocal of the defense_lawyers in the sting cases , he also attacked FBI tactics that he claimed were intended to intimidate witnesses . In a confidential letter to the court , Heller contended that Wedick attempted to scare_off potential character witnesses for Jackson by asking them about his sexual_relationships , which were unrelated to the charges against him . These questions were &quot; calculated to intimidate prospective defense witnesses and smear Mr. Jackson ' s good name in Mr. Jackson ' s community , &quot; Heller complained . As Heller ' s letter makes clear , however , Wedick first got approval for the questions about Jackson ' s sexual behavior from the U.S. attorney ' s office . Aided by Robbins , the government also built a case against Coastal Commissioner Nathanson , a Beverly Hills real_estate_broker who had helped Robbins shake down the San Diego developer . Wedick also turned_up evidence that Nathanson had sought to extort cash from such Hollywood figures as Sylvester Stallone , Jeffrey Katzenberg and Barry Diller for building_permits for their beachfront homes . Nathanson eventually pleaded guilty to using his office as a criminal enterprise and was sentenced to 57 months in prison . Robbins originally was sentenced to five years , but because of his cooperation on these cases , a judge later cut the term to 24 months . He was released early from custody in March . A jury takes only eight hours to find Frank Hill guilty of three counts of extortion , conspiracy and money_laundering . Wedick ' s record is still perfect : 14 convictions and no losses . Even before the_Hill trial ends in mid-June , the FBI flies Wedick and his wife to Washington , D.C. , so that he can receive an &quot; award for excellence &quot; from director Louis J . Freeh . The citation credits Wedick with initiating the Capitol probe and pursuing it &quot; despite initial opposition to the plan. &quot; It is a surprising acknowledgment of the resistance that the probe generated . The trophy , an inscribed circle of leaded glass mounted on a wooden base , is the only sign of his achievement in the family_room of his suburban Sacramento home . Several days after the_Hill verdict , wearing shorts and a T-shirt , the sunburned agent finally seems to have unwound . &quot; Totally amazing &quot; is how he describes the outcome , saying that the government never dreamed the operation would be as successful as it was . Sipping tonic , he ticks_off what he sees as the larger repercussions of his probe , including the 1990 ballot initiatives that instituted legislative term limits and a strict code of ethics that bars honorariums like the one that Hill took from an undercover_agent . &quot; We clearly got some of the big players down here , &quot; Wedick says . &quot; But we didn ' t get them all . There ' s more of a leeriness if someone starts to talk_about money and legislation in the same breath. &quot; While Wedick is proud_of such progress , he has no illusions that he has transformed the culture of Sacramento . His investigation has certainly not curtailed massive fund-raising , especially during the end of the legislative session in August , when lawmakers stage dozens of events around the Capitol just as they are about to vote on controversial bills . Wedick is especially dismayed that Hill continues to have his defenders and that his colleagues were reluctant to expel him from office . Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy , who testified on Hill ' s behalf , explained to reporters that many lawmakers regard Hill as a good friend . Maddy questioned whether Hill would have been convicted outside of Sacramento . &quot; I think he was more a victim of circumstances and the venue than he is of committing a crime , &quot; Maddy said . In mid-September , Wedick heads for the federal courthouse for the last act in the FBI sting . Hill , who finally resigned in July , is about to be sentenced . Wedick ' s dress is sharper than usual : instead of his usual white shirt , he ' s wearing a blue-striped one he borrowed from his son . In the courthouse , Wedick walks past Hill ' s family and supporters into the courtroom of Judge Edward J . Garcia . When Hill and his co-defendant , former Democratic Senate aide Terry E . Frost , are called to the bench , the ruddy-faced Hill appeals_to Garcia for mercy , reiterating his innocence . But throughout the proceeding , Garcia makes_it clear that he views Hill as a liar . &quot; The jury didn ' t believe him ( at the trial ) , &quot; says Garcia , &quot; nor did I. &quot; Still , moved by letters of support on Hill ' s behalf , Garcia sentences the former state_senator to a relatively light 46 months in prison . Frost receives 21 months . ( Both are now in the Federal Prison_Camp near Boron , with appeals pending. ) In the lobby of the courthouse , tearful friends and relatives comfort and embrace Hill . As Faye Hill walks by the agent who dreamed_up the sting that caught her husband , she snarls , &quot; They ' d better hold me back. &quot; &quot; If Faye Hill thinks I get a kick sending Frank Hill to prison , &quot; Wedick says later , &quot; I don ' t. &quot; There is some drive_in him , however , that makes him want to root_out wrongdoing , and it won ' t let him rest . &quot; I just can ' t give_up the chase. &quot; Today , although he won ' t discuss it , Wedick is pursuing allegations that elected officials in Fresno and Clovis sold their votes on land-use issues to developers . He has also kept track of ex-Sen . Paul Carpenter , recently extradited from Costa Rica , where he fled after his 1993 conviction for mail_fraud , obstruction of justice , conspiracy and money-laundering . But he hasn ' t turned_away from the Capitol , where he remains a bete_noire for many of the Old_Guard who believe that but for happenstance , they could be sitting in a federal prison_camp in the place of their former colleagues . During the_Hill trial , Assembly Republicans threw one of their usual fund-raisers at the Hyatt , this one attended by Gov . Pete Wilson . Afterward , several lobbyists spotted Wedick in the lobby . Some thought he had come_to spy , which he denies . They complained to him about the targets of his probe . &quot; They were saying , ' You got the wrong guys , ' &quot; Wedick recalls . &quot; My reply was , ' There are ( crooked ) guys ? Who are they ? If you have the information , let ' s start with you. ' &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Agent Weddick ' s Catch FORMER SEN .
