   <TEXT> Reviewers , Lord love us , may mismatch our socks and dent our fenders like everyone else , but about books we ' re supposed to be authorities . You , the readers , want to know two things : What is &quot; Conversations With Sheryl Sutton &quot; about ? And is it any good ? It ' s my job to answer those questions and , if possible , give you something extra besides . Nothing looks worse in a review than a simple confession of ignorance . Yet the truth is : I have only a vague idea of what this experimental novel is about . And it may be good , but how good only a reader a lot more erudite than I ( and , let ' s face it , than most of you too ) would be qualified to say . I could finesse this , of course . Reviewers have ways of disguising their intellectual inadequacy . I could talk_about the author , Hungarian poet Janos Pilinszky ( 1921-81 ) . I could dwell_on the social and historical background : He was in prison_camps during World_War_II ; later , under Hungary ' s Communist regime , which banned his poetry for 10 years , he eked out a living as a columnist for Catholic publications . I could talk_about the theater : Much of &quot; Conversations &quot; is a treatise on what we now call performance art . Anything but the book itself . The neatest trick -- in fact , the one I ' ll use here -- is to talk_about the book after all , but only about those parts of it I can understand . The idea is that its readership , at best , will be small and select . Pilinszky ' s true audience will be smart enough to find it even without the aid of my crude finger-pointing ; the rest of you won ' t be able to call my bluff . To begin , then : Paris , 1973 . A man and a woman . The man , Pilinszky , is in his 50s and ailing ( although the bout of pneumonia he suffers in the novel may be just &quot; a wry acknowledgment of his hypochondria , &quot; co-translator Peter Jay says ) . The woman , Sheryl Sutton , is another real person , an American actress , then 23 , appearing in the Robert Wilson play &quot; Deafman Glance , &quot; a work that highly impressed Pilinszky . In life , Pilinszky and Sutton met briefly at a cafe and later talked for several hours . In the novel , they have a number of long , deeply philosophical conversations . Their relationship , although platonic , is intense . Sutton nurses Pilinszky back to health , sometimes sleeping on the floor beside his sickbed . She reads his works , acts_out dramatic scenarios that they make_up and cooks him his favorite potato goulash . Do we expect a contrast between the world-weary European and the raw , primitive Yank ? Whatever the real Sheryl Sutton may be like , Pilinszky ' s Sutton is fully his equal in intellect and sophistication . Their dialogue , set_down unadorned as in a play , is so elliptical and poetic that Jay admits : &quot; There are a_few passages so baffling that nobody we have turned_to has been able to shed_light_on them. &quot; Pilinszky himself puts it best : This so-called novel is &quot; the only book of essays I am capable of writing. &quot; The subject of those essays -- of the conversations -- is what possibilities are left for art after the horrors of the 20th Century . The aim , Pilinszky says , is to become a &quot; citizen of the universe , &quot; not merely of the world . &quot; Masterpieces are beyond boredom , not before it , &quot; he says . &quot; What now disturbs me in modern literature is that it doesn ' t dare run the risk of boredom , &quot; as Tolstoy ' s novels and Bach ' s music did . Sutton finds in Wilson ' s play and in performance art a path around the conventions of realistic theater to a direct confrontation with reality , the silence and wholeness of Greek tragedy and religious_ritual . This is , finally , a book of wonders . It ' s a wonder that the chance meeting between Pilinszky and Sutton gave_rise to such a singular work . That Jay and Eva Major spent years translating it . That Sheep Meadow-Carcanet published it , with what must have been little hope of commercial gain . In short , that &quot; Conversations , &quot; quirky and brave , exists at all -- waiting for the right readers to come_along . And reviewers be damned .</TEXT>
