   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; CSUN PLANS MASSIVE FUND-RAISING APPEAL ; CONTRIBUTIONS : LETTERS WILL BE MAILED TO 130 # 000 ALUMNI NATIONWIDE . FOR THE QUAKE-CRIPPLED CAMPUS , IT WILL BE THE LARGEST CAMPAIGN IN YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hoping to strike at a time when massive earthquake damage on campus has thrust Cal State Northridge into the national spotlight , university officials said Tuesday that they plan to mail fund-raising_campaign letters to 130 # 000 alumni nationwide , their most ambitious solicitation effort in years . The appeal will consist_of three letters from CSUN President Blenda J . Wilson . Alumni in the San Fernando Valley and adjoining earthquake-damaged areas will get a general greeting and update , while alumni in other Southern California areas and nationally will receive specific appeals for contributions of up_to $ 1 # 000 , CSUN officials said . &quot; When you ' ve been splashed all_over the world as an institution that got very badly hit , it ' s important you communicate with your friends and alumni that you ' re still alive and well , &quot; said Wilson , who was named CSUN ' s president in May , 1992 , with a mandate to improve the campus ' historically lagging fund-raising_efforts . Michael Hammerschmidt , CSUN ' s director of university development , said the Jan . 17 earthquake simply accelerated the university ' s prior plans to mount a major fund-raising_campaign . Without the earthquake , he said , &quot; we probably would have not even started thinking_about it for two or three years. &quot; Although no official tally has been prepared , CSUN officials have estimated that the earthquake will cost the campus $ 250 million to $ 350 million in damages and other expenses . That would make_it the costliest loss ever for a U.S. institution of higher learning . Federal and state disaster relief funds are expected to cover most of the loss . Any proceeds from the mailed solicitations , which will cost $ 10 # 000 to $ 12 # 000 , will be used toward covering expenses not reimbursed from other sources , Hammerschmidt said . But he offered no estimate of how much money the appeal might produce . In the forthcoming letter to Valley-area alumni , the university decided against making an explicit financial appeal , figuring local residents may have suffered earthquake losses as well . But Hammerschmidt said the university nonetheless hopes to expand its contacts with those alumni as a prelude to future fund-raising_efforts . In the future , Hammerschmidt said CSUN hopes to do three or four fund-raising mailings a year to alumni . Neither he nor Wilson could recall the last time that CSUN sent as large a fund-raising appeal as is planned this week . In recent years , the university has relied mostly on a computerized phone bank , an operation staffed by paid students . Although Northridge in 1992-1993 ranked as the fourth-largest campus in enrollment in the 20-campus Cal State system , it ranked only 10th in attracting donations , a total of $ 4.9 million , according to state records . But only about $ 450 # 000 of that came from alumni . Since the earthquake , the university has already received a $ 50 # 000 donation from the John D . and Catherine T . MacArthur Foundation , $ 25 # 000 from The Commonwealth Fund and $ 10 # 000 from Union Bank , Hammerschmidt said . Wilson serves as a director for the latter two groups . CSUN also received an unsolicited $ 1 # 000 donation from a graduate alumnus in Japan . In other developments , the campus , which reopened Monday , showed fewer signs of chaos . Workers toiled to complete the remainder of a mini-city of portable classrooms brought_in because virtually all_of CSUN ' s major classroom buildings remain closed . Even so , students and faculty_members seemed to better cope_with the disarray than on opening day . More portable classrooms were opened and signs identifying individual classrooms and areas , virtually absent the day before , were widely posted . But clusters of modular classrooms mostly at the north end of the campus remained incomplete , and many groups of instructors and students were forced to gather_in the open or under the shade of trees . CSUN Dean of Libraries Susan Curzon predicted that the heavily damaged Delmar T . Oviatt Library will remain closed at least for the entire spring semester . The expected long delay in reopening the library , the centerpiece building on campus , is_due to the extensive work required to identify how severely it was damaged , she said . Students , meanwhile , are being shuttled to UCLA , and Curzon said she hopes to have an electronic mini-library open in temporary quarters on campus within a month .</TEXT>
