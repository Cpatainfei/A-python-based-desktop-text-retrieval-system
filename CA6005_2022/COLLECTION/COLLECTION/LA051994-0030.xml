   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ' S LOST WINE COUNTRY ; GALLEANO ' S LAST STAND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The low-lying , weathered buildings show cracks ; the sun-splashed courtyard is dotted with turn-of-the-century winemaking equipment , partially rusted and covered with cobwebs and dust . This is Galleano Winery in Rancho Cucamonga , an area roughly 60 miles east of Los Angeles that once was the largest wine-growing region in the United States . The winery looks pretty much as it did decades ago , and Don Galleano wants to keep it that way . He could have refurbished the place with a coat_of_paint , a repaved parking_lot , and perhaps even a neon sign for the tasting room , with a flashing hand pointing_the_way . But Galleano sees his winery as a living example of one of the most vital and energetic wine districts in U.S. history , a district that has steadily dwindled in recent years . Galleano , caretaker of the last remaining family-owned and family-operated winery exclusively using grapes from Rancho Cucamonga , vows his property will always be here to represent the hard work that came_before . Half a century ago this east-west valley was home to more_than 35 # 000 acres of vines ( greater even than the Napa Valley is today ) and more_than five dozen wineries . Its decline was caused by a change in consumer tastes , real_estate development and a lack of winemaking technology . * In the late 1800s , this flat land in western San Bernardino County was a barren place of high sand_dunes and an apparent lack of water . But by 1900 , it was_on the road to becoming a haven for Italian immigrants seeking to recraft the red-wine tradition of their native_land . Its subsequent decline saddens Galleano , who believes he must preserve its heritage . To speak with Galleano -- which anyone can do_by showing_up most Sundays for a tour -- is to get a history lecture . First , however , you must get here , to the modest buildings along Wineville Road . And don ' t drive too fast or you ' ll miss the entrance . &quot; People say , ' You ' re the guy with the stories , ' and I like tellin ' ' em , &quot; says Galleano with a broad smile . He often starts his stories in front of his house , across the street from the winery . &quot; This house was built_in 1895 by Col . Esteban Cantu , the governor of Baja California Norte , &quot; Galleano says . &quot; It was one of a series of summer_houses he owned in this country , and my grandfather , Domenico -- he was called Nino -- bought_it in 1927. &quot; As Galleano talks , he continues through the winery with its huge , square concrete fermentation tanks -- one so large that , with its wall removed , it is now a private tasting room . The cellar also contains giant redwood vats of red_wine , white_wine , Sherry and Port . The smells are heady . * The best place to catch Galleano ' s act is inside the small , history-drenched tasting room . Nostalgia lurks in every cranny . &quot; See that clock ? &quot; he says , pointing to a huge , circular timepiece you couldn ' t miss from a mile away . &quot; I got_it from Brookside ( Winery ) . It had been at the old Italian Vineyard Co . Why , it was probably bought by Mr. ( Secondo ) Guasti himself. &quot; It was Guasti , a visionary from Piedmont , Italy , who , legend has it , upon observing one day in 1900 that winter rainfall runoff disappeared into the sand , discovered a lone grapevine in the desert floor . He dug down 24 feet before finding the tip of the roots in soil moist from the water_table . &quot; This valley has exceedingly deep sand , so vines could send roots down to such depths that superficial drought couldn ' t affect them , &quot; says Thomas Pinney , a professor of English at Pomona College and author of &quot; A History of Wine in America. &quot; Pinney says the sandy soil and accessible water_table persuaded Guasti that he could develop the land into vineyards , so he bought eight square_miles of land , founded the Italian Vineyard Co . and planted European vines -- such warm-climate grapes as Grenache , Mourvedre and Syrah . He also brought entire families from Italy to settle the town he named for himself and to work the vineyards . His efforts would one day become the world ' s largest contiguous vineyard , 5 # 000 acres , surrounding Guasti . * &quot; My grandfather sold a lot of wine to the fishermen from San Pedro , mainly Yugoslavs and Italians , &quot; says Galleano . &quot; They would drive_out here for two , three days at a time and have jack rabbit drives ( hunts ) in the sand_dunes , and they ' d eat_at the local restaurants and they ' d drink a lot of wine. &quot; Most of the history of this region is of just this sort -- anecdotal . Few books exist on the area , and those that do are skimpy and poorly organized , with dates and even spellings tossed about rather casually . In a 1976 article on the region for the Claremont Courier , Pinney wrote : &quot; It is not easy to form an accurate picture of the ( wine ) industry in Cucamonga since it is so unsettled and no currently available guide is even approximately trustworthy. &quot; It is clear , however , that much of the wine tradition that existed here prior to 1920 , the onset of Prohibition , was lost during the next 13 years . Galleano says many of the winemaking families gave_up and left the area . A few , such_as his , stayed_on and sold grapes for home winemakers . ( Prohibition laws permitted a head of a household to make 200 gallons of wine for personal use each year. ) When Prohibition ended in late 1933 , the Galleano family was among the leaders in a second wave of development here . Over the next quarter century , Cucamonga Valley grew faster than any other wine region . Grape planting took_off in_earnest as wineries girded for increased demand . And the demand was largely for sweeter wines , such_as Port and Sherry , which then were far more popular_with Americans than table_wine . And Cucamonga made excellent dessert_wines . At its peak in the early 1950s , more_than 60 wineries sold wine to local and national accounts ; winery sales rooms were busy on weekends with visitors from Los Angeles ( Galleano has old cask cards showing that wine was $ 1 per gallon , but you had to bring your own empty jug ) . Grapes were shipped near and far for commercial and home winemaking . * By 1962 , the valley was producing the equivalent of 4 million cases of wine a year , more_than 5 % of all wine sold in the United States , including imports . However , the bubble was soon to burst . Only five years later , in 1967 , statistics show , more dry wine was sold nationally than sweet . And winemaking technology hadn ' t yet advanced to_the_point where good table_wine could be made from such warm-climate grapes . Thus began the rapid decline of Rancho Cucamonga as a vine capital . The lack of demand for Cucamonga wine came at_the_same_time that demand rose for land for housing and office_buildings , spurred by the development of Ontario International Airport and other projects . And the vineyards were ripe for the picking . Galleano , 42 , nearly gets misty-eyed when he speaks_of the decline of the area as a wine center : &quot; When I was growing_up , I was looking_at all these guys in the twilight of their lives , still growing grapes and still making wine , &quot; he says . &quot; They were tired . They were looking_at real_estate . You know , farming for most people is a way to hold onto the land until you can sell it for a price much higher than what you bought_it for . &quot; My grandfather lived a perfectly happy life growing grapes and making wine . But in the 1960s , when it became tough to sell the wine , when they knew they had bought the ground for $ 500 an acre and they were offered $ 5 # 000 an acre to sell it for development , well , can you blame them ? &quot; So the vineyards with their ancient , gnarled vines and small wine cellars all became expendable . * The Galleano Winery can ' t avoid the sounds of a busier world . Trucks gazoom along I-15 on the other side of the ancient vines ; jet_engines shriek into Ontario Airport , a_couple_of miles northwest . But the winery buildings , sitting under the flight_path and in front of the winery ' s three acres of old vines , cluster alone . The only neighbors are grazing cattle . A car passes so infrequently that , when one does , you wonder whether the driver is lost . Last December , the J . Fillippi Winery in Fontana , across the 10 and 15 freeways to the northeast , was sold to developers and will move to another location , leaving Galleano as the last holdout making wine at its original site . But his decision to preserve the heritage here was made long ago . &quot; I made the decision in 1977 , &quot; he says . &quot; This history has to be preserved , it ' s going so fast . I ' ve been given an opportunity , and I ' m not gonna blow it. &quot; Ironically , however , it is development -- a word that is otherwise anathema to Galleano -- that permits him to save his little five-acre rancho and , with luck , 62 acres of vineyards nearby . Galleano is involved in the development of a 50-acre parcel on Aero Highway in Rancho Cucamonga that is just a half-mile from the $ 11-million Epicenter , the stadium of the local minor_league baseball franchise , the Quakes . * The vines on Galleano ' s development site are gone now ; the land is graded and has curbs , gutters and sewers ; buildings of 12 # 000 square_feet to 25 # 000 square_feet are planned . More vineyard land sits adjacent to the Epicenter . Galleano swears it will be buildings before long . He acknowledges the irony of using the funds from a destroyed vineyard to save another . &quot; I know it sounds odd that I would be developing a vineyard into buildings , but it ' s to save one . That five acres , &quot; he says of_his_own ranch with finality , &quot; don ' t move. &quot; And he intends to convert more land to agriculture . One parcel adjacent to his home was zoned for industrial use some years ago . When the economy turned sour , he says , &quot; Bank of America took the property over . I ' m trying to buy_it . If I can , I ' ll change it into an agricultural preserve . &quot; I ' m looking_for areas that have been designated as open space . I want to plant grapes to take_care of the needs of this winery and other wineries that think we ' re doing something right here. &quot; He becomes passionate when he speaks_of the great quality of Mourvedre , Grenache and Muscat of Alexandria . * Last year Galleano processed virtually all_the grapes grown on the last remaining 1 # 850 acres of vines in the Cucamonga Valley , and he sold a third of a_million gallons of wine in bulk to other wine companies , such_as Bronco , Franzia and Delicato . R.H. Phillips Winery in Esparto , near Sacramento , annually buys large amounts of Galleano ' s red_wines to blend into its successful &quot; Night Harvest Cuvee Rouge , &quot; which sells for about $ 6 a bottle . Says R.H. Phillips ' winemaker , Ron McClendon : &quot; I ' m surprised at the color he gets_in his Grenache . It ' s really a powerhouse , full of fruit . And the Mourvedre has a special character , fresh fruit and smoke. &quot; He says nearly a fourth of the &quot; Night Harvest Cuvee Rouge &quot; is Galleano ' s Cucamonga wine , &quot; and that wine needs his fruit , &quot; says McClendon . &quot; It ' s the signature of that wine. &quot; Most of the wine Galleano markets in bulk comes from vineyards owned by developers waiting until the real_estate market improves . &quot; We have a wonderful vineyard right down the street that ' s owned by General Dynamics , &quot; says Galleano . &quot; It ' s got old dry-farmed Grenache and Zinfandel . They ' re thinking of putting a golf_course on it , but until they do , we get the grapes. &quot; Some of those grapes go_into the table_wines Galleano sells at his tasting room . The red_wines are rustic and rough-hewn but they are nowhere near as coarse and earthy as_many of the country wines of the past . Still , they are wines happily at_home in a water_glass aside a hearty stew . Galleano uses no small-oak aging , preferring to leave the wine in large upright redwood vats for a year to soften before bottling . One classic example is the 4-liter bottle of Zinfandel for $ 7.75. Customers may also buy a ceramic crock with a spigot , for dispensing the wine . Galleano also sells his gutsy red_wines to Basque sheepherders , who , he says , love his wines . He also makes the house wine for Central Basco , a popular Basque restaurant in nearby Chino . Galleano ' s white_wines , particularly the Muscat , are fresher than they were in the past , but most of them offer a trace of residual sugar , so they are aimed more at picnics , patios and parties than fine dining . Galleano may_not be crafting Chateau Latour . But he is honoring his great-grandfather ' s heritage by preserving a trace of what once was a huge and flourishing industry now fast evaporating -- a blessing still on view down remote Wineville Road .</TEXT>
