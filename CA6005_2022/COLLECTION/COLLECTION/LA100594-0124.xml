   <HEADLINE> MEDICINE / HEAD INJURIES ; NEW DRUG MAY HELP LESSEN EFFECTS OF SEVERE TRAUMA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new genetically engineered drug could increase the likelihood of surviving severe head injury by as much as 20 % , researchers said this week . The new treatment could spell the difference between a job and independent living and life in a coma , or even death , for as_many as 50 # 000 Americans each year , Dr. J . Paul Muizelaar of Wayne State University in Detroit told the Congress of Neurological Surgeons in Chicago on Monday . Muizelaar and his colleagues at 28 other hospitals around the country administered either the drug , called PEG-SOD , or a placebo to 463 patients who suffered severe head injuries , most of them in automobile accidents . Among those given the sham treatment , 46 % were able to return to work or live independently . Among those receiving the optimum dose of the drug , however , 55 % were able to do so . Because more_than 500 # 000 Americans are hospitalized with head injuries each year , neurologists &quot; have said that even an improvement of a_few percentage_points ( in survival ) would be clinically important , &quot; Muizelaar said . &quot; This is even better than that. &quot; &quot; We feel the results are very significant , &quot; said Dr. Kenneth S . Waxman , a neurosurgeon at UC Irvine . &quot; PEG-SOD is . . . the first ( such medication ) shown to actually work in a controlled trial. &quot; Head injury is the leading cause of death and disability in children and young adults in the United States , accounting_for 13 % of all injuries , according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke . Conservative estimates suggest that 2 million people suffer a traumatic brain injury each year , with 500 # 000 requiring hospitalization and 75 # 000 to 100 # 000 resulting in death . More_than half of those injuries arise from motor_vehicle accidents . Males are twice as likely as females to suffer head injuries , and most survivors are between the ages of 15 and 24 . Nationwide , the economic costs of head injuries total more_than $ 25 billion per year , according to the stroke institute , with the lifetime cost for a single survivor reaching as much as $ 9 million . A substantial fraction of the deaths and damage arises from so-called secondary brain damage , the swelling and pressure that develop in the days after the accident . When the flow of oxygen and sugar to the brain is impaired by trauma , toxic chemicals called oxygen free_radicals are created . The free_radicals damage tissues directly and also produce swelling that can be extremely damaging or fatal . The body has a naturally occurring enzyme called superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) that destroys free_radicals , but this system is overwhelmed by the trauma . A long series of animal experiments by Muizelaar and other researchers has shown that SOD produced by genetic_engineering techniques can supplement the natural SOD activity and minimize damage . Scientists attached the SOD to a polymer called polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) so that it remains in the blood longer , thereby extending its therapeutic benefit . Muizelaar said that the drug ' s manufacturer , Sterling-Winthrop Inc. , will probably apply to the Food and Drug Administration for marketing approval upon the completion of a second and larger clinical trial that is expected to be completed within a year . The FDA has already placed the drug on the so-called fast track toward approval because it is used for a life-threatening disorder for which no treatment is currently available . Such approval is likely , Muizelaar speculated , because &quot; it appears to me that it works and that it is also very safe. &quot; The results in the new study are similar to those obtained in a previous study on 104 patients used to determine the best dosage levels . Muizelaar said as_many as 900 more patients are enrolled in the other ongoing study of the drug . The failure of the drug in those patients who did not respond may have been_due to the severity of the damage caused by the trauma , Muizelaar said . He also speculated that the response would be better if the drug were given immediately after the injury . On average , the drug was administered to patients in the study about six hours after their accidents . &quot; This is a sentinel finding . . . because it shows we ' re on the right track , &quot; added Dr. Steven L . Giannotta of USC . &quot; Over the last 10 years there have been no major accomplishments that have altered the way we care_for head injuries . This gives impetus to the search for medications that can have even greater impact. &quot;</TEXT>
