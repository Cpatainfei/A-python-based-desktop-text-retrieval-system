   <HEADLINE> EPA URGED TO ADOPT LOCAL SMOG CLEANUP PLAN ; ENVIRONMENT : COUNTY BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES SAY FEDERAL PROPOSAL COULD ACTUALLY PUT MORE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Saying a federal plan to clean_up smog could do more harm than good , Ventura County business and government representatives urged federal_officials Wednesday to adopt a locally written proposal instead . At a public hearing attended by an overflow crowd in Ventura , one Camarillo school_board member said the proposed cleanup measures would cost schools so_much in new equipment that many would be forced to discontinue busing -- resulting in more cars on_the_road and more pollution . &quot; More_than 1 million of 5 million students in California ride buses to school , &quot; said Val Rains , a Pleasant Valley School District trustee who represented the California School_Boards Assn . &quot; That could easily be doubled or tripled if operating revenues were available , &quot; Rains said . &quot; But the federal implementation plan would have exactly the opposite effect on schools. &quot; Officials called_on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulators conducting the hearing to adopt the locally written plan , which emphasizes that those responsible_for the most pollution bear more of the cost . Robert Paulger , a Procter &amp; Gamble executive who helped draft the local alternative plan , said the coalition of business and agricultural leaders figured_out a way to reduce emissions by 40 % needed to meet federal health standards without threatening local industry or farms . &quot; We want the same outcome as the federal plan , but with less impact on jobs , &quot; Paulger said . The local coalition estimates that the proposed federal plan would cost the county nearly 130 # 000 jobs if it is implemented as proposed . Among other provisions , the local plan would impose fees on all motorists who drive gasoline or diesel-burning cars based on the miles they drive each year . Such a fee would require the blessing of the state . At Wednesday ' s public hearing on the proposed &quot; federal implementation plan , &quot; the railroad , aviation , trucking and automotive industries asked_for leniency from the crackdown on pollution . Felicia Marcus , regional administrator for the EPA , opened the daylong meeting at the Board of Supervisors hearing room by asking speakers for constructive criticism of the proposed EPA plan . The result , she said , was better than she had hoped . &quot; I am thrilled by the spirit of collaboration here , that the whole group got_together , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s a road map to a successful local plan . And if you have that , we ' re out of here. &quot; Marcus said the EPA will consider all viable alternatives and may incorporate them into the final cleanup plan . She said EPA has worked closely with industries for decades , working_out pollution rules . &quot; The stationary sources who have been in the game for 25 years know we ' re being fair , &quot; she said . &quot; But it ' s pretty clear to anyone who ' s driven behind a big rig truck that mobile sources have not been as regulated as other sectors. &quot; * Although a federal_court is forcing the EPA to develop the cleanup plan for Ventura County , and the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas , the federal proposal would not be needed if the Ventura County Air_Pollution Control District can adopt enough measures to meet federal clean air standards on its own . Marcus said that the EPA plan can be used as a type of backstop , offering some regulations that are outside local jurisdiction to bring the county ' s air into compliance with federal law . But Bill Mount , deputy director of the local air district , said it is unlikely that the county will be able to lower air_pollution enough to meet health standards without adopting some federal measures . Technical studies are now under way to find_out how close local measures will bring the county to compliance with the standards . The county was designated as an area with a &quot; severe &quot; air_pollution problem for ozone , a lung-damaging gas created when emissions from cars and industry mix_in sunlight . The proposed federal plan calls_for new restrictions on emissions from trucking , railroads , aircraft and shipping , none of which the local_government can regulate . The railroad industry , which operates both freight and passenger_trains through Ventura County , asked the EPA to exempt some interstate trains from new regulations . To achieve the required emission reductions , the industry proposed to buy new , more efficient locomotives . &quot; We stand ready to do our fair share , &quot; said Travis Hinton , Amtrak ' s transportation superintendent for the region . * The trucking_industry opposes a measure that would limit heavy-duty trucks to one stop in Ventura County . Local growers object to that provision as well , saying they depend_on trucks to move their goods to market . &quot; This plan has the potential to severely damage , if not completely destroy , Ventura County ' s citrus industry , &quot; said Carolyn Leavens , a major citrus and avocado grower . Growers in the county have also objected to a provision that would regulate some pesticides . Barbara Weinberg of the American Lung Assn. , and Stan Greene , who spoke on behalf of Citizens to Preserve the Ojai , reminded the group that the reason for the plan is public health . &quot; The latest findings have shown that nonsmokers in highly polluted areas had steeper decline in lung function than smokers in non-polluted areas , &quot; she said . &quot; We ' re doing this because it ' s for our health. &quot; Greene , whose organization sued the EPA in 1988 to force the county to reach clean air goals , said the cost of air_pollution , both to public health and industry , can no longer go unpaid . &quot; It must be borne by those who produce it , whether it ' s industry , agriculture , or transportation . There is no going backward. &quot; NEXT STEP The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will continue to accept written comments on the proposed federal cleanup plan through Aug . 31 . The EPA will then finalize its smog cleanup rules , which will be adopted in February . Written comments can be sent to Felicia Marcus , regional administrator , Region 9 , 75 Hawthorne St. , San Francisco , Calif. , 94105 .</TEXT>
