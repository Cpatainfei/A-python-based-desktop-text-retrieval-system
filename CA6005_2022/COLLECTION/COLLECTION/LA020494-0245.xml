   <HEADLINE> GEORGIA EXPLOSIONS KILL 2 AS YELTSIN VISITS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two explosions ripped through an apartment in this tense capital Thursday , killing two people and injuring the Georgian defense minister , while less than a mile away the Russian and Georgian presidents signed agreements to allow Russian military bases and troops in Georgia . A Georgian spokesman blamed the bombings on terrorists opposed to closer military links with Moscow . But there was no evidence that the assassination was linked to President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s first_state visit to the former Soviet republic , and the one-day summit proceeded as planned . Georgia ' s deputy defense minister , Col . Nikolas Kekelidze , was in bed in his downtown apartment when a powerful , remote-controlled bomb exploded at 4 a.m. , killing him and a woman who was identified by friends as his mistress . The blasts also damaged nearby buildings . Yeltsin arrived in Tbilisi at 10 a.m. under unprecedented security . About 200 dilapidated buses were used to block roads into the city , and hundreds of Georgian police_officers lined the streets along which Yeltsin ' s motorcade traveled . Yeltsin ' s security_staff had already insisted that the Russian president not spend a night in Tbilisi , where they said his safety could not be guaranteed , Russian and Georgian sources said . The second bomb went_off in Kekelidze ' s apartment at 1 p.m. , as Yeltsin and Georgian leader Eduard A . Shevardnadze were signing 26 different agreements on military and economic cooperation in a government building not far away . Georgian Defense Minister Georgy Karkarashvili , who had come_to inspect the considerable damage done_by the first explosion , suffered a slight concussion from the second blast . Apparently the apartment had been booby-trapped ; a grenade was set to detonate when investigators opened the door . Karkarashvili offered his resignation earlier this week in protest of the closer ties to Russia , but Shevardnadze had not accepted it . Some sources suggested that pro-Russian forces carried_out the bombings , but there was also speculation that the motive instead stemmed from Kekelidze ' s business dealings . A Georgian Defense Ministry statement said the bombings were &quot; very well planned and professionally executed &quot; and represented &quot; one more link in a chain of terrorist murders , none of which have been solved. &quot; Since the demise of the Soviet_Union , no former republic has had a stormier relationship with Moscow than Georgia . Georgia has fought three civil_wars since 1991 -- and blames elements in the Russian defense Establishment for giving separatists arms , intelligence and volunteers . Last spring , Shevardnadze declared that Georgia was &quot; effectively at war with Russia. &quot; In a sign of how fast things have changed , on Thursday , President Yeltsin became the most feted guest in Georgia since independence . Shevardnadze called the Russian-Georgian friendship treaty &quot; one of the major events in 200 years of history between our two peoples. &quot; A protocol signed by the two leaders will allow_for three Russian bases to be set_up in Georgia : in Tbilisi , in Batumi on the Turkish border and in Akalkalakhi , near the Armenian border . The agreements also permit the deployment of Russian border guards on the frontiers of the former Soviet republic , envision Russian arms sales to Georgia and pledge Russian help in setting_up a Georgian national army . Though some protesters bitterly attacked what they saw as a Georgian sellout to a resurgent , imperialist Russia , Shevardnadze emphasized how much bad ties with Moscow had weakened his country . &quot; The temporary coolness in our relations was a serious mistake which must be corrected , &quot; Shevardnadze said . Times special correspondent Rowell reported from Tbilisi and staff writer Efron from Moscow .</TEXT>
