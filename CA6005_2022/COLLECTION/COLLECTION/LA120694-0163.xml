   <HEADLINE> ENERGY FIRMS AGREE TO MERGE FOR $ 950 MILLION ; ACQUISITIONS : SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT COMES AFTER CALIFORNIA ENERGY SWEETENS BID FOR MAGMA POWER TO $ 39 A SHARE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a surprising turnabout that cost a handful of overeager traders about $ 1 million , rival geothermal producers California Energy Co . and Magma Power Co . said Monday that they agreed to merge after California Energy raised its offer to $ 39 a share , or $ 950 million . The deal , which would create the world ' s largest independent geothermal producer , stunned several Wall_Street observers . Many thought that San Diego-based Magma Power had successfully fought_off California Energy ' s hostile_takeover effort . Only Friday , Omaha-based California Energy said it was calling_off its $ 38.50-a-share , $ 925-million hostile tender_offer for Magma Power after failing to enlist the support of Dow Chemical Co. , which owns 21 % of Magma Power shares , and B.C. McCabe Trust , which owns 12 % . But Dow , Magma ' s largest shareholder , took a decisive role over the weekend to persuade the two companies to forge a merger_agreement , California Energy Chairman David Sokol said Monday . Dow arranged a Saturday meeting in New York between Sokol and Magma Power Chairman Paul Pankratz and Chief_Executive Ralph Boeker , Sokol said . After California Energy sweetened its offer , the two sides came_up with an agreement that was unanimously approved early Monday by Magma Power ' s board of directors . Terms call_for a new tender_offer to commence Dec . 9 in which California Energy will pay $ 39 for each Magma Power share_in a combination of $ 28.50 cash and $ 10.50 in California Energy stock . The acquirer will pay_cash for the first 50.3 % of Magma Power shares tendered . Sokol said California Energy will attempt to pay_cash for the rest of Magma ' s shares if financing can be arranged . In a statement , Dow Chief Financial Officer Enrique C . Falla said he was delighted by the agreement . He was not available to comment further on Dow ' s role in the pact . Pankratz and Boeker , both former Dow executives , were unavailable for comment Monday . Analyst Daniele Seitz of UBS Securities said Magma Power was forced belatedly to accept the California Energy bid after failing to elicit &quot; a big , fat premium or a white_knight , which never showed up. &quot; While analysts generally viewed the offer as fair for Magma Power shareholders , some , including Michael Cha of J.P. Morgan Securities , lamented the fact that the two companies didn ' t announce an agreement earlier Monday or over the weekend . As it was , owners of about 100 # 000 Magma Power shares lost about $ 1 million by selling their stock in private transactions early Monday at about $ 28 a share -- the price when the takeover_bid was launched in September -- figuring Friday ' s news of the termination of tender_offer would cause share prices to fall , Cha said . Official trading of both companies ' stock was suspended at the market ' s opening Monday and resumed after the merger was announced at 9:30 a.m. EST . Magma Power shares closed_up $ 1.875 at $ 37.375 on the Nasdaq , while California Energy stock closed_down 87.5 cents at $ 15.625 on the New York Stock_Exchange .</TEXT>
