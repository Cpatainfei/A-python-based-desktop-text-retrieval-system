   <TEXT> &quot; Sexual Confusion in the Wild &quot; ( Oct . 2 ) was one of the finest articles I have ever read on the environment . Informative and terrifying , it uncovered a great darkness that I feel dwells deep beneath what we humans perceive as reality . I wept when I read it . I put it on the bulletin_board at my workplace . There it remained for three days . I attached a note and my name asking_for_it to be returned in case it was judged inappropriate . Today I found it torn_off the board and crushed into a ball in the trash . It was an angry and ugly statement . I was shocked by the violence of it and was reminded of swastikas painted on synagogues in the middle of the night . After pondering the issue , trying to reason it out , it occurred to me that there are many in our world who do not want to know the truth about man ' s destructive march across our magnificent planet . There are many who want to stay uninformed and complacent , hanging_on to comfort and economic security no matter what the price . This might be even more terrifying than the story behind Marla Cone ' s article . BRENDA SHERMAN McBRIDE Woodland Hills * In reply to &quot; Pollution ' s Effect on Sexual Development Fires Debate , &quot; Oct . 3 : Before the average modern person of reproductive age freaks_out , consider stress from such articles as a more probable_cause . Profound problems such_as low sperm_counts , breast_cancer and , most disturbing , &quot; retard ( ed ) penis growth &quot; show_up in nature with overpopulation . Also consider the parents ' pot smoking , use of designer_drugs , alcohol , casual sex and a Clinton-type diet . In today ' s world common_sense , morality , political integrity , or lack of same , will be the hope or horror of the near future . Perhaps these scientists would do_better to hold_out mirrors to the population to show us where the real problems are . WARREN ARNOLD Malibu * Will gender confusion be the key to ridding the world of pesticides ? When the agribusiness executives realize that pesticides result in reduced sperm_counts and small penises in themselves and / or their progeny , I think we ' ll find sharply reduced quantities of pesticides produced and distributed into our community .
