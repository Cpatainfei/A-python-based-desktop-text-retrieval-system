   <HEADLINE> COLLEGE BASKETBALL / DAILY REPORT ; MEN ; BOYCOTT TALK NOT QUITE OVER WITHOUT MINORITY CHANGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While emphasizing that &quot; the healing has begun , &quot; USC ' s George Raveling said Thursday there still exists the possibility of a future boycott by basketball_coaches if changes aren ' t made in NCAA minority policies . Speaking at a National Assn . of Basketball_Coaches ' press_conference in Charlotte , N.C. , Raveling was quick to praise a recent federally mediated agreement between the NCAA and the Black Coaches Assn . In that agreement , the NCAA promised to review , among other things , its initial eligibility standards for student-athletes , its hiring practices for upper hierarchy positions , its position on a fourth year of eligibility for non-qualifiers and its legislation concerning access to players during the off-season . Still , Raveling , a prominent member of both the BCA and the NABC , said the black coaches ' organization definitely would have boycotted games had an agreement not been reached . Asked to describe the specifics of such a boycott , Raveling said he couldn ' t because , &quot; we might have to use it in the future. &quot; Added Seton Hall Coach P.J. Carlesimo : &quot; If no changes are made , absolutely ( there will be a boycott ) . &quot; Sitting nearby was James Haney , NABC executive_director , who tried to downplay the threat of a future walkout . &quot; It ' s gone , &quot; Haney said of the animosity between the coaches and the NCAA . &quot; History is history . You can ' t deny it existed . But we ' re moving on. &quot; In fact , Raveling and Carlesimo said they expect significant and favorable legislative adjustments at the next NCAA convention in January . Raveling based his prediction &quot; on dialogue I ' ve had with people in both groups. &quot; Carlesimo was even more upbeat . &quot; To get where we are now , to me , is an absolute incredible accomplishment , &quot; said Carlesimo , who serves on the NABC ' s board of directors . &quot; Yeah , I think ( the NCAA ) is going_to take a hard look ( at the issues ) . I think there ' s going_to be an incredible amount of change. &quot; One topic that won ' t go_away : restoration of a 14th scholarship . &quot; I don ' t think that ' s a dead issue , &quot; Raveling said . &quot; I think that will be an issue revisited at the next convention. &quot; * NCAA Executive_Director Cedric Dempsey met with reporters Thursday . Among the highlights : -- Dempsey echoed the words of Raveling , saying the mediated agreement was only the beginning of the negotiating process . He also said the powerful Presidents Commission had made &quot; no commitment that any of those issues would be passed. &quot; As for the threat of a boycott , Dempsey said the NCAA never devised a contingency plan to deal with a tournament walkout . -- A newly formed NCAA education services division will begin operation as soon as a director can be hired . Watching closely , no doubt , will be the BCA , which has pushed for greater minority representation in the NCAA administrative offices . Dempsey would n ' t guarantee that a minority would be hired for the position , but he did say , &quot; We are committed to increasing diversity. &quot; -- Interviews have been completed with athletes concerning their thoughts on a possible Division I-A football playoff . Those players have expressed concern about lengthening the season , the loss of free_time and the question of remuneration for their services in such a playoff system . According to Dempsey , the earliest a playoff bracket could be put into place would be the 1995-96 season . Even then , there might not be time to negotiate television and radio rights . &quot; We may be looking_at two years down the line in_order to put it into place , &quot; Dempsey said of the possible football championship . * The NABC announced the formation of a 10-member USA Select Team made_up entirely of college senior players . The NABC-sponsored team will be coached by Massachusetts ' John Calipari , who will help whittle the long list of 40 candidates to the final cut . The team , which will assemble May 24 , then travels_to Portugal , France , Spain and Italy for games against those countries ' national entries in June . GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI</TEXT>
