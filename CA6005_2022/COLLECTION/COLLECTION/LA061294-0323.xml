   <HEADLINE> CRITICS SEE FOREIGN TIES AS A LEASH AROUND U.S. NECK ; SOVEREIGNTY : IN A FAMILIAR DEBATE , THE WHITE_HOUSE IS ACCUSED OF GIVING TOO MUCH CONTROL TO OTHER NATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ghost of Henry Cabot Lodge is stalking President Clinton . Seventy-five years ago , in the aftermath of World_War I , Sen . Lodge successfully led the fight against President Woodrow Wilson ' s proposed League of Nations , arguing that it would give other countries too_much power over U.S. policy on trade , immigration and committing troops to war . Echoes of the argument rang through Congress last week , where a shifting amalgam of conservatives and liberals accused Clinton of giving international institutions like the United Nations , the successor of the League of Nations , too_much influence over U.S. policy -- not only abroad but at_home . The charge that Clinton is ceding control over American affairs to international bureaucracies -- or put another way , compromising the nation ' s sovereignty -- is now opening a debate about America ' s role in the world in two key arenas . On one front , Clinton is facing a phalanx of critics -- led by many of the Republicans likely to seek the party ' s presidential nomination in 1996 but also including some Democrats -- who want to diminish U.S. reliance on the United Nations and pursue a more independent course of action in Bosnia , North_Korea and elsewhere . On a second front , Clinton is trying to push a new_world trade treaty through Congress over the objections of critics who say the pact would give other nations power to undermine a vast array of U.S. environmental and worker-safety laws . These debates cut_to central choices about how America pursues its international objectives in the post-Cold War era . The Administration -- believing that the demise of the Cold_War rivalry has made_possible international cooperation on an unprecedented scale -- has generally sought to increase the power of multilateral institutions such_as U.N. peacekeeping operations and the world trade organization . Their argument is that coordinated multinational action is the best way to deal with economic and security problems around the globe -- particularly at a time when the United States cannot afford to shoulder all burdens by itself . But they have faced an intense backlash -- and have already been forced to retreat on some fronts -- by critics who complain that relying so heavily on the U.N. and other international institutions has limited America ' s freedom to maneuver . &quot; We are seeing that this staunchly internationalist vision of what the world should become has a great many holes in it , &quot; said Alan Tonelson , research_director at the Economic Strategy Institution in Washington . Administration officials said Clinton is merely pursuing the cooperation necessary in an increasingly interdependent world . They flatly reject the contention that he is reducing U.S. freedom to act unilaterally -- either in foreign or economic_policy . &quot; This is not a new argument in American politics , &quot; said U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor . &quot; It comes_up historically with any international agreement America has ever entered of any note. &quot; Indeed , the fear that national_leaders will compromise U.S. sovereignty to international institutions has been a steady background hum in American politics throughout this century , particularly among conservatives fearful of anything that looks_like &quot; world government. &quot; Those concerns played critical roles in the Senate decisions to reject American participation in the League of Nations after World_War I and the International Trade Organization after World_War_II . But for most of the last 40 years , these apprehensions have been confined largely to an extremist fringe , such_as the handful of conservatives who blocked U.S. adoption of a treaty on genocide for almost four decades . Now these arguments are being propelled back toward center stage -- partly by the GOP search for new_lines of attack on Clinton but also by changes in the international environment . Beyond the partisan dimensions , Tonelson noted , these debates have been sharpened by two powerful trends : the increased reliance on U.N. peacekeeping forces made_possible by the end of the superpower rivalry , and the growing demands for new rules and institutions to run the integrating global economy . In trade , the crux of concern about eroding sovereignty is the mechanism for settling international economic disputes . Under existing trade laws , countries can challenge other nations ' domestic economic or regulatory rules as unfair trade practices by bringing cases before panels authorized by the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , the agreement that sets worldwide trading rules . Using that process , for instance , Mexico and the European Union have won judgments condemning the U.S. ban on tuna caught with nets that imperil dolphins . Another GATT panel is reportedly nearing a decision on a European case charging that U.S. fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles penalize European manufacturers , such_as Mercedes-Benz . The existing procedures have a huge loophole : Under current GATT rules , the country that loses a decision can block the implementation of sanctions to enforce it . But the new GATT treaty -- which Congress must still approve -- closed that escape_hatch and denied a nation the ability to block rulings against it . As Administration officials quickly pointed_out , that does not mean that the new_World Trade Organization created in the treaty can order the United States to change a law that it considers in violation of international trade rules , such_as the tuna ban . But it does mean that the country challenging the law will be legally authorized to impose sanctions or tariffs on U.S. products if Congress does not change the law . Kantor said this new mandatory system is in U.S. interests because American firms are more often plaintiffs than defendants in such trade disputes . Congress , he noted , directed the negotiators to produce a tougher system for enforcing decisions . &quot; We use the dispute settlement in the GATT more_than any other country on Earth , &quot; he said . &quot; We were frustrated by the European Community ( now the EU ) especially in the ' 80s , time after time , by their blocking dispute-settlement rulings. &quot; But consumer activist Ralph Nader and other critics -- who aired their critiques at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing Friday -- worry that the mandatory system will provide a new avenue for domestic special_interests , working in concert with foreign countries , to challenge environmental or occupational-health laws as unfair trade practices . Faced with the prospect of sanctions , he said , Congress will be under enormous pressure to change offending statutes . Treaty supporters insisted that Nader overstated the risk of the new trade organization ruling against U.S. laws . But they acknowledged that some reversals may be the price of compelling others to abide_by decisions that go_against them . &quot; It would be disingenuous to suggest that a system that benefits you as a plaintiff would have no consequences as a defendant , &quot; said one senior Administration official . Despite these concerns , Congress is likely to approve the new trade order . But it may_not sit still for too many international judgments that challenge U.S. laws , noted an aide to one senior Democrat who supports the treaty . &quot; If what we see as a result of the WTO is a cascade of filings , the system is going_to fail , &quot; he said . A similar balancing between the desire for international cooperation and unfettered freedom of action runs_through the debate over sovereignty in security affairs . Since the Vietnam_War , U.S. leaders have regularly demanded greater burden-sharing from our allies . But under Clinton , the issue has flipped from concerns that American allies were not doing enough to fear that they have moved_into the driver ' s seat . In what appears certain to be a central count of the GOP case in 1996 , Republicans now routinely charge that Clinton has neutered U.S. foreign_policy by only acting through the United Nations and with the approval of our allies . &quot; It has become an excuse for not acting , &quot; said Jack Kemp , a former Cabinet member under President George_Bush and possible Republican presidential contender in 1996 . &quot; You can say : ' We would have done something , but we couldn ' t get the_French or the_British to go_along at the U.N. ' &quot; Vice_President Al Gore inadvertently provided the critics with a powerful example when he traveled_to Marrakech , Morocco , in April for the signing of the new_world trade agreement . Gore appeared hours after U.S. planes enforcing an allied &quot; no fly &quot; zone over northern Iraq accidentally shot down two U.S. helicopters , killing 15 Americans and 11 foreign officials . &quot; I want to extend condolences , &quot; Gore said , &quot; to the families of those who died in the service of the United Nations. &quot; On Thursday , in a tone of enthusiastic disdain , House Minority_Leader Robert H . Michel ( R-Ill. ) threw those words back at the Administration . &quot; When our men and women are killed on the battlefield , &quot; he declared during debate on a measure to bar U.S. forces from serving under U.N. commanders , &quot; they do not die in the service of the United Nations . They die in the service of the United States of America. &quot; The fear that Clinton has excessively deferred to the United Nations drove Thursday ' s stunning House vote calling_on the Administration to unilaterally breach the U.N. arms embargo barring aid to the Bosnian Muslims . Similar concerns also powered the GOP amendment to bar U.S. forces from serving under foreign commanders in U.N. operations . That amendment -- like an earlier Senate Republican effort -- failed on a party_line vote . But those clear expressions of congressional dissatisfaction -- reinforced by the disillusionment that followed the ill-fated U.S.-led operation in Somalia -- have already deflated the Administration ' s enthusiasm for participating in multinational U.N. peacekeeping operations , once touted by Clinton as a key to American engagement with the world . As a candidate , Clinton called_for a dramatic expansion of U.N. authority , suggesting a standing multinational rapid-deployment force that could be used for peacekeeping , &quot; standing guard at the borders of countries threatened by aggression &quot; and preventing &quot; violence against civilian populations . . . . &quot; That expansive vision of an independent U.N. force -- one that many liberals have harbored for decades -- &quot; was dumped on day one &quot; after Clinton took_office , said one Administration official . &quot; The first meeting that was held_on peacekeeping ( policy ) everybody said : ' that ' s unrealistic , let ' s put that on the back burner. ' &quot; By the time the Administration put_out a presidential directive on peacekeeping last May , it sharply limited U.S. participation in U.N. military operations -- and the circumstances when U.S. forces taking_part in such operations could serve under foreign commanders . Those guidelines are so restrictive that other nations now largely blame American reluctance for delaying dispatch of a U.N. peacekeeping force to Rwanda . One Administration national security strategist agreed that early in his term Clinton had a propensity to view the United States in these U.N. deliberations &quot; as just one more vote . . . . There were times when we were not willing to assert our own proportional weight in a collective manner. &quot; But the strategist insisted that even if chastened about the need to exert leadership , the United States must continue to seek multinational cooperation -- both to share military burdens that the nation is unwilling to shoulder alone and to ensure concerted action against outlaw countries such_as Iraq and North_Korea . &quot; If the U.S. says we are basically going_to break any embargo the U.N. put_together that we don ' t agree with , it is going_to be hard to argue to other sovereign nations that they should abide_by embargoes we support , &quot; he said . The argument that the United States cannot afford to routinely act alone has undeniable force . Even Kemp insists that his criticism does not mean &quot; to suggest we should be like the lone cowboy in foreign policy. &quot; But the recoil from U.N. peacekeeping , the reluctance to defer to the United Nations on the arms embargo in Bosnia and the anxiety about binding dispute resolution through the new_World Trade Organization suggest that fears of eroding sovereignty that jolted the League of Nations 75 years ago still carry a charge in American politics today . Both Clinton and his critics are trying to thread the needle between views that are close to contradictory : the beliefs that this nation cannot afford to act alone yet must_not excessively rely_on allies . In their struggles stand the continuing evidence of America ' s uncertainty about how to define and advance its aims in a world no longer defined by the Cold_War .
