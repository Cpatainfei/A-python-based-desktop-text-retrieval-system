   <HEADLINE> SCENARIOS FOR A 2ND KOREAN_WAR GRIM FOR U.S. , SOUTH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For years , American and South_Korean military planners have studied what they sometimes call the Second Korean_War . They have played_out the war_games and the scenarios aren ' t pretty . &quot; The north ' s plan has two options to it , &quot; explains Paul Godwin of the Defense_Department ' s National War College , an expert on Asian military affairs who has played the role of a North_Korean in the war_games . &quot; One is to take Seoul quickly and sue for peace . The other is to bypass Seoul and kick us out_in a blitzkrieg . &quot; Either way , we won ' t have the buildup that we had for ( the Persian_Gulf_War ) . This would be more like a Soviet invasion of Germany . The north comes_over , we ' ve got no more_than 24 to 72 hours lead time . Once American forces die -- and they would die -- we ' re going to go. &quot; That , in a nutshell , is the daunting military problem that would confront U.S. armed forces in a second Korean_war . Top military officials insist that the United States and its allies would win such a war , but some defense experts are not so sure . And even if the allies were victorious , their casualties would be enormous . These war scenarios explain why the United States has gone_to such extraordinary lengths to negotiate with and conciliate a Pyongyang regime that has repeatedly flouted international_law and stalled on living_up_to its agreements . The most recent sign of these conciliatory policies came last Tuesday , when the International Atomic Energy Agency reached a deal with North_Korea for the inspection of seven of its nuclear installations . But Clinton_Administration officials acknowledged that even on these inspections , North_Korea got special treatment . The inspections , one official admitted , will be &quot; more limited than the routine , ad_hoc inspections the IAEA has in other countries. &quot; And the agreement merely puts Pyongyang back to where it was exactly a year ago , when the international agency first sought the right to make special inspections of two nuclear waste dumps in North_Korea . If North_Korea goes_along with the inspections , the Administration has promised to cancel this year ' s annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises . And if the Pyongyang regime goes_along with other inspections and gives_up its nuclear_weapons program , the Administration has promised other rewards , even economic help and diplomatic recognition . Why does the United States tolerate North_Korea ' s continuing defiance in a way that it did not with Iraq ' s President Saddam Hussein ? Why doesn ' t the world ' s leading military power rely more heavily on threats to use force ? Or why not employ economic sanctions , which North_Korea has said it would consider an act of war ? Some answers can be traced to the Pentagon strategy in a Korean_war , contained in a highly secret Pentagon document labeled U.S. Forces Korea OpPlan 5027 . The war plan was revamped in the early 1990s by Gen . Robert W . RisCassi when he was commander_in_chief of American and South_Korean forces in the Korean theater . Only a_few people know the plan ' s details , but its general outlines are clear . According to interviews with present and former U.S. defense officials , military commanders and diplomats , a Korean_war would be an extremely bloody conflict in which South_Korean ground forces , especially , might suffer heavy casualties at the outset . &quot; We would rely_on the South_Koreans in the initial stages of a war for the ground defense and the ground combat capability , &quot; Adm . Charles R . Larson , commander_in_chief of U.S. forces in the Pacific , told The Times in a recent interview . &quot; The United States would provide a lot of things that we do very well -- such_as indications and warning , intelligence , sophisticated systems , air_power . . . Navy and Marine Corps power -- as we are then mobilizing and shipping heavier forces and ground forces. &quot; U.S. jet fighters , including F-15s and F-16s , would be brought_in from bases in the Pacific Rim and the United States . The United States would deploy aircraft_carriers and surface_ships carrying Tomahawk missiles . And it would send_in a rapid-deployment corps , composed mainly of light infantry , along with heavy firepower and some armor , from Hawaii and Ft . Lewis , Wash . The purpose of a strategic air campaign &quot; would be to try and blind them , &quot; says Godwin . &quot; The F-117 ( Stealth aircraft ) pilots are going_to be busy. &quot; North_Korea ' s air_force has only some substandard Soviet MIG-21s and MIG-29s . Primarily because of fuel shortages , its pilots train for an average of only 20 hours a year . In any conflict , air superiority would go very quickly to the allied forces , U.S. officials say . U.S. military planners believe that with American reinforcements , the allies would beat_back North_Korean forces and drive not only toward but past the capital of Pyongyang -- stopping , however , well short of the Chinese border . &quot; You can bet that if war breaks_out , American diplomats will be in Beijing saying , ' we ' ll stay well clear of your borders , and here are the rules of pursuit , ' &quot; says one experienced U.S. defense official . The American_plans , of course , were drawn_up with a specific history in mind : that of the first Korean_War , which broke_out June 25 , 1950 , when North_Korean forces invaded the south and drove deep into South_Korean territory . Gen . Douglas MacArthur soon counterattacked , landing American troops behind enemy lines at Inchon and driving toward the Yalu_River border between North_Korea and China . Chinese &quot; volunteer &quot; troops then entered the war , pushing U.S. and South_Korean forces_back and into a bloody , prolonged stalemate . In all , 33 # 629 Americans died and another 103 # 284 were wounded . Much has happened in the last four decades that might change how a new Korean_war would be fought . South_Korea has developed and prospered in a way that once seemed unimaginable -- giving it enormous economic power and , at_the_same_time , tremendous property interests to protect if conflict broke_out . North_Korea no longer can rely_on Chinese political and economic support , much less hundreds of thousands of troops . The Soviet_Union , Pyongyang ' s other longtime patron and supplier of cheap oil , does not even exist . And on the allied side , the end of the Cold_War has given a new , tremendous war-fighting boost to the United States : Once war broke_out , the best American units would go immediately to Korea . &quot; The deterrent value of the United States is much greater now , &quot; says Douglas Paal , a former National Security_Council official for the Ronald Reagan and George_Bush administrations . &quot; There is no alternative front . We don ' t have to keep some of our best forces on the North German plain. &quot; Still , many military analysts believe that a new Korean_war could prove just as difficult for American and South_Korean forces as the first one . North_Korea has an active force of 1.3 million men , including 1.1 million ground forces , American officials say . &quot; When you ' re talking_about ground troops , North_Korea is a very formidable force , &quot; says one U.S. official . &quot; They are not Iraqis . They are trained , tough , disciplined and well led. &quot; Over the last decade , the North_Koreans have deployed 60 % to 70 % of these troops near the Demilitarized Zone and border with South_Korea . Only 25 % of those forces were in forward locations in the late 1970s . The troops are frequently on alert status . These deployments are the result of a North_Korean effort in the late 1970s to shift the balance of its defensive power to the border region and to make_it more mechanized . In recent years , Pyongyang has also substantially changed the kinds of forces and armaments that it maintains in the border area . Military analysts say that the picture is particularly worrisome because the North_Koreans have massive artillery emplacements in hardened sites and because they have an estimated 100 # 000 &quot; commando rangers &quot; -- the largest contingent of special forces in the world -- ready to knock_out South_Korean communications , supply and transport networks and the airports and harbors at which American reinforcements would be landed . Strategists believe that North_Korea would launch massive artillery barrages as cover -- and then rush across the border with its vastly superior number of ground troops , trying to move enough units around to break_through the South_Korean lines at some key points and then encircle the defenders . Once the northern troops broke_through the southern lines , they say , the war might be all but over . The north could break_up supply_lines in the south , take_over Seoul and push_on through the rest of South_Korea . Except for the area around the border , the rest of South_Korea is not heavily defended . The North_Korean strategy , says Ronald N . Montaperto of the National Defense University ' s Institute for National Strategic Studies , &quot; would be to drive far south and wreak heavy destruction and then look_for a political settlement. &quot; &quot; They would try to go_farther and faster than last time because they know they aren ' t going_to get help from the Russians or Chinese . They would hope that the costs of another Inchon invasion would be so heavy that we would sue for peace. &quot; U.S. analysts say that the South_Korean army of about 500 # 000 men is not in tiptop shape and is badly deployed . The main part of it -- 12 forward divisions and 30 divisions and a support brigade behind -- is laid_out in a thin line_of_defense along the border . Some U.S. analysts say another crucial factor is that South_Korean troops are not trained in the tactic of massing to defend a specific point or , in other cases , falling_back to trade space for time , which is critical in this situation . South_Korea has few units in reserve to launch any kind of counterattack . With those weaknesses in mind , these analysts worry , the South_Korean army might not be able to hold_out for the two full months needed before U.S. reinforcements would finish arriving . American officials contend that those deficiencies stem from the South_Korean belief that the United States provides a strong deterrent to North_Korean aggression and that , in the end , U.S. forces would provide enough power to defeat North_Korea in a war . South_Korea also has limited supplies of ammunition . It has built few military storage facilities , because its politically powerful farmers have demanded all available flatlands for growing rice . And evacuation would be difficult because a war would cause massive traffic_jams . If war breaks_out , says Godwin , &quot; those on the forward edge of the battle area are going_to get chewed_up . Very badly . The reinforcements will have to come_in to take_care of absolutely incredible casualties. &quot; The United States maintains just over 37 # 000 troops in South_Korea . These troops function as a tripwire , to show North_Korea that any invasion of South_Korea would touch_off a war with the United States . The combined American and South_Korean war plan has been updated roughly every 10 years -- most recently by RisCassi , who served as the commander of allied forces in Korea until last year . &quot; RisCassi redid the war plan , and it ' s very realistic now , &quot; says one U.S. source who has seen it . &quot; It ' s no longer hey-diddle-diddle , we push them back across the border and that ' s that . It ' s got a lot of blood and gore to it. &quot; The aim would be initially to contain North_Korean forces north of Seoul , and then eventually launch a counterattack to defeat them there and overrun the rest of North_Korea . Yet some critics say that this strategy is unrealistic . They fear that the North_Korean forces could break_through the South_Korean lines within a week to 10 days . Don Snider , chief military analyst for the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , says that the strategy for defending South_Korea &quot; is considered to be one of the toughest war plans to execute. &quot; &quot; It ' s the cavalry-to-the-rescue strategy , &quot; says Robert W . Gaskin , a former Pentagon planner . &quot; But the cavalry can ' t get there as fast as they think. &quot; Like its air_force , however , North_Korea ' s army is limited by shortages of fuel . &quot; Do they have enough petrol , oil and lubricants to drive to Pusan ? &quot; Godwin asks . &quot; Or are they stuck_with trying to take Seoul and sue for peace ? &quot; North_Korea ' s economic plight means that as time goes_on in a war and American reinforcements arrive , the advantage would increasingly shift to the allies -- provided South_Korean forces could hold their defensive lines . By some worst-case scenarios , in even a short war of several weeks , American forces could suffer enormous casualties of up_to 20 # 000 soldiers killed and wounded . The losses of North and South_Koreans would be much higher . &quot; There will be a lot of significant loss of life on both sides , &quot; says Larson . &quot; But certainly our alliance is very capable of winning that war. &quot;</TEXT>
