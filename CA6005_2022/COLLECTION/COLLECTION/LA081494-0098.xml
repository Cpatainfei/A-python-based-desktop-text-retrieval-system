   <HEADLINE> MEXICO ON THE CUSP ; THE TALE OF A REVOLUTIONARY AND AN ASSASSIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Poor Salinas de Gortari , &quot; goes a recent joke at the expense of Mexico ' s president . &quot; On Dec . 30 , he went_to_bed thinking he was North_American . On Jan . 1 , he woke_up knowing he is Guatemalan. &quot; The New Year ' s Day Zapatista uprising near Mexico ' s Guatemalan border in Chiapas , six days after Mexico ratified the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , and the assassination , 12 weeks later , of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio in Tijuana are two reminders of how far Mexico has yet to travel_to awake as a first-world nation . The proliferating fissures in the Institutional Revolutionary Party have rendered obsolete Mario Vargas Llosa ' s mordant assessment of the PRI as &quot; the perfect dictatorship , &quot; because it was able to maintain an iron hold_on the country behind a carefully orchestrated illusion of democracy . The assassination of Colosio and the uprising of more_than 1 # 000 dispossessed Mayan Indians who make_up the Zapatista Army of National Liberation at the opposite poles of the country have done far more_than crumble Mexico ' s democratic facade : They have exposed the fragility at the core of PRI ' s -- and the country ' s -- post-revolutionary structures and awakened fears of an accelerated drift toward violence and disintegration that could turn Mexico into our hemisphere ' s Yugoslavia . As the dust begins to settle , two men are seen to bear a disproportionate responsibility for this unprecedented reversal in Mexico ' s fortunes -- and in its conception of itself . A preliminary government inquiry has determined that Mario Aburto Martinez acted alone when he assassinated Colosio on March 20 . Fifteen hundred miles south of Tijuana in Chiapas , Mexico ' s poorest state , the enigmatic Subcomandante Marcos has emerged as the architect and guiding genius of the Zapatista uprising . It is hard to imagine two more disparate figures bound by a common resort_to armed violence to achieve political objectives . And while the poker-faced Aburto ' s justifications for shooting Colosio remain mired in murky , self-serving rhetoric , Marcos has exploded on the public arena as a loquacious exponent of revolution , craftily blending Emiliano Zapata ' s passion for social justice with Che Guevara ' s gift for phrases that can appear to alter history . But this only hints at Marcos ' gift for language , which has enthralled Mexico ' s political and intellectual Establishment , along with millions of disaffected peasants and laborers in Oaxaca , Hidalgo , Guerrero , Michoacan and other poor Mexican states . Marcos ' almost daily missives to the press are enlivened by witty asides , Aesopian fables and flights of lyricism that create a sense of intimacy with Mexicans from a wide range of social and economic backgrounds . For all his literary talents , Marcos ' greatest coup may be his success in protecting the mystery of his identity even as he turns_into Mexico ' s most familiar public icon . Chamula Indian vendors here have started a cottage industry of ski-masked Marcos dolls they sell to tourists , and his effigy appears on a brand of condoms marketed as &quot; El Levantamiento , &quot; the Uprising . Marcos ' disguise draws_on a Mexican tradition of masked crusaders from El Zorro to the caped Super Barrios of Mexico_City ' s slums . His mask allows him to claim kinship with homosexuals , college-educated professionals and illiterate peasants , not to mention the millions of Mexicans who have crossed the northern border in search of economic betterment ( one rumor has Marcos living for a time as a gay waiter in San Francisco ) . Behind the black ski_mask and pipe and the bullet belts strapped across his chest , Marcos is continually evolving . Following the bellicose tone of the Zapatistas ' Second Declaration from the Lacandon Jungle , which called_for armed revolution if the government refused to step_down , Marcos has heeded his mentor Carlos Monsivais , as well as Carlos Fuentes and other members of the influential San Angel group , and has begun to move from the &quot; Professional of Violence &quot; to his emerging status as Professional Conciliator . For the national democratic convention celebrated last week in the Zapatistas ' Lacandon jungle outpost , Marcos invited peasant and labor_union delegations from around the country , but he also extended invitations to writers and intellectuals of right , left and center , whom he addressed in graceful epistles published in La Jornada . The polished replies by Monsivais , Fuentes , Enrique Krauze and other prominent writers and shapers of public_opinion have helped revive what Monsivais calls &quot; the nearly extinct &quot; art of epistolary discourse . Another gift of Marcos is his ability to turn the mesmerized media into Zapatista mouthpieces , and supposedly impartial mediators into allies and stalking horses for his initiatives . Not only La Jornada and the prestigious weekly Proceso on the left , but even the staid Financiero -- Mexico ' s rough equivalent of the Wall_Street Journal -- have become sounding boards for Marcos ' political agenda . President Salinas ' special envoy , Luis Camacho Solis , enhanced Marcos ' image as a skillful negotiator far more_than he helped his own reputation , after the peace agreement they signed was rejected by the Zapatista rank_and_file . The mediation of Bishop Samuel Ruiz of Chiapas between the government and the Zapatistas nearly foundered when he and Marcos were discovered to see eye-to-eye on replacing the PRI with a government responsive to the needs of the poor and disenfranchised . Ruiz ' s thinly veiled support for the Zapatista cause has further strained his relations with the Vatican over his espousal of the leftist theology of liberation , and fueled his longstanding feud with Chiapas ' right-wing politicians and cattle ranchers . If Salinas and the PRI make_good on their promise to guarantee a clean and swift election , and declare a winner on the same day , Salinas and Marcos could emerge as unexpected allies , co-protagonists of the country ' s transition to democratic reform . Regardless of which candidate is elected , it is increasingly evident that no party will be able to govern Mexico without the support of the others . Both Cuauhtemoc Cardenas ' left-leaning Democratic Revolutionary Party and the right-of-center National Action Party -- whose candidate , Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , is running second behind the PRI ' s Ernesto Zedillo -- lack infrastructure , and the PRI is morally bankrupt . In the extraordinary climate of distrust prevailing in Mexico , hardly anyone believes the polls that show Zedillo far ahead of his rivals . And the majority of Mexicans remain convinced that the PRI ' s old_guard had a hand in the assassination of Colosio , who was attempting to return PRI to its grass roots . The restraint shown by both Salinas and Marcos during the first days of the Zapatista uprising prevented a much-larger blood bath in the Lacandon jungle , where fewer than 200 combatants and civilians were reported to have been killed . On the other hand , if Cardenas ' prognostication of a massive fraud is borne_out -- he is charging that 5 million ballots have been duplicated by PRI officials -- Mexico could turn_in the direction of Aburto : more magnicidios , and uprisings by armed peasant groups throughout Mexico , as Marcos has predicted , in an ominous preamble to civil_war and Balkanization . There is ample precedent for both options in Mexico ' s 1910 revolution , which produced Zapata and land_reforms , but also led to the assassinations of three presidents and two revolutionary leaders -- Zapata and Pancho Villa -- in fewer than 15 years . In the just-concluded convention in the Lacandon jungle , the 5 # 000 delegates and the Zapatistas called once more for the resignation of Salinas and the dissolution of the PRI . And they threatened to mobilize a general strike that would paralyze the country if the PRI fails to deliver on its pledge to conduct &quot; squeaky clean &quot; elections . A week before the presidential vote , Mexico sits on the cusp , poised on the threshold of peaceful transition to a democratic phase of Mexico ' s uncompleted revolution , or a return to the assassinations , armed insurgency and incipient civil_war of the 1920s , and the first 90 days of 1994. *</TEXT>
