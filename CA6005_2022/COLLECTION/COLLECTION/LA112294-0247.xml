   <TEXT> The children of this town learn early not to smile . When they do , they show a ghastly array of blackened , splintered , rotting stumps where milk-white teeth might have been . An environmental plague has struck this northern land of lakes , no longer pristine , and thinning pine forests . The children of Nadvoitsy are its victims . Their disease is caused by a pollutant that the town ' s main employer , the Nadvoitsy Aluminum factory , dumped in its back yard for three decades . Slowly , the contaminant seeped more_than a mile through the watery soil to the lake that supplies drinking_water to almost all_of the 19 # 000 residents of this little town near the Finnish border . In one of the many cruel ironies bred by environmental indifference in the former Soviet_Union , the substance that has sickened an estimated 4 # 000 children in Nadvoitsy is massive quantities of fluoride . Because it is beneficial in small doses , no one ever bothered to check for its presence . Then , for years after officials discovered the chemical culprit in the mid-1980s , townspeople continued to drink from the poisoned lake . Building a pipeline to a cleaner water source was deemed too expensive . Dreadful as Nadvoitsy ' s story is , its water woes are hardly unique . A new report from the Environment Ministry says half of Russia ' s population is forced to rely_on substandard drinking_water . Nadvoitsy ' s polluters , chastened by the rage and sorrow of the townspeople , are at last committed to cleaning_up -- just when Russia ' s economic tailspin makes_it nearly impossible to raise the money to do so . As this one-factory town and hundreds of other dangerously polluted Russian cities have discovered , environmental safety has become a casualty of the country ' s economic chaos . Forty-three Russian cities are in urgent need of air_pollution relief , 1 # 016 plant and animal species are endangered , and deforestation is widespread , the World_Bank reported recently . Virtually nothing has been done to clean_up the radioactive and toxic_waste_sites that pepper the country . And as a symbol of the environmental calamities here , even the most basic of human needs -- clean drinking_water -- has been put_on hold . Alexei V . Yablokov , the father of Russia ' s environmental movement , recently warned that the dreadful ecological legacy of the former Soviet_Union has only been worsened by five years of economic decline . Between 14 % and 15 % of Russian territory is so polluted that it is unsafe for habitation , but 40 million people live there anyway , Yablokov said . It is not surprising that environmental problems are low on the agenda for a new Russian leadership that has been consumed by the simultaneous struggle to calm violent political strife at_home , squelch ethnic fires near its borders , carry_out fundamental economic reform and cope_with a huge decline in the gross_national_product . But while Moscow ' s mind is elsewhere , ecologists say , Russia ' s far-flung provinces are being ravaged by uncontrolled strip-mining , clear-cutting of forests and surreptitious dumping of hazardous wastes . &quot; The term ecocide is very appropriate , &quot; Yablokov said . When Russian authorities do catch environmental despoilers red-handed , they can mete_out only puny punishment . Inflation has reduced to a pittance the maximum fines that polluters can be forced to pay . For example , in 1993 , Nadvoitsy Aluminum spewed out 8 # 640 tons of pollutants , including airborne fluoride . But it has paid just $ 3 # 500 in fines this quarter for exceeding pollution limits , said Valentin P . Kudryavtsev , the senior environmental inspector who has been tenaciously prodding the aluminum plant and its neighbors to clean_up . The government recently decided against raising the fines to keep_up with inflation , saying to do so would create undue economic hardship , Kudryavtsev said . Some eco-offenders remain as brazen as ever . In June , a chemical plant in Khabarovsk dumped 1 1 / 2 tons of furfural , an oily liquid used to make disinfectants and preservatives , into the Khor River . Local officials said the toxin caused $ 45 million in environmental damage . The plant will be fined and ordered to clean_up the river , but none of the managers responsible_for the dumping was sacked . Eight years after the Chernobyl nuclear accident demonstrated the folly of trying to cover_up or ignore environmental catastrophe , Russian officials still have a tendency to do just that . The massive Siberian oil spill that came_to_light last month began in August , but most Russians learned of it only after Americans blew the whistle . In fact , such oil and chemical spills are so common that they barely make news here . Nevertheless , they have steadily contaminated the nation ' s water_supplies . As rivers in the former Soviet_Union were befouled , planners began tapping underground aquifers for drinking_water . Now , pollutants have seeped into these underground sources , especially in the intensely industrial European part of Russia , according to the Environment Ministry report . It found the quality of 80 aquifers that supply 60 cities with drinking_water had worsened in 1993 . In the cities , aging water treatment plants are inadequately maintained , and authorities simply add more and more chlorine to dull the rising bacteria count . In the spring , Moscow ' s tap_water smells like a public swimming_pool . Elsewhere , it often runs orange or brown . Where there is industrial equipment to control water_pollution , it is often obsolete and overburdened . The ministry found the percentage of industrial waste water that is treated at all declined in 1993 , to 8.7 % of the total outflow . More_than 20 % of the drinking_water samples the ministry studied in 1993 flunked biological or chemical purity tests , and 4.3 % of samples contained such high bacterial counts as_to pose &quot; real epidemiological danger. &quot; Overall , the report concluded that Russia ' s drinking_water problem is now critical and &quot; has a dangerous tendency to deteriorate. &quot; In 1993 , Russia spent about $ 19.25 per citizen on environmental protection , forestry , national_park maintenance and wildlife protection . Of that , $ 2.28 was used for capital investments to protect water resources . Overall environmental spending has shrunk 20 % since 1990 . Most Russians never know whether their water is safe to drink because authorities do not test for many of the most dangerous pollutants , said Alexander Knorre , who heads the Moscow office of Greenpeace . For example , very few Russian laboratories have the sophisticated equipment needed to test for dioxin , a chemical used in paper production that is a proven carcinogen , Knorre said . The test can cost up_to $ 300 , so it is almost never performed , he said . Upstream from Nadvoitsy is the huge Segezha paper plant , which almost surely emits dioxin . &quot; If they can ' t measure it , it ' s not a problem , &quot; Knorre said . Russia ' s economic calamity has somewhat slowed the pace of new pollution . A 25 % slump in industrial production over the last eight months alone has meant fewer toxic gases spewing from factory smokestacks and fewer poisons flowing into rivers and streams . The slump caused Russia ' s 13 largest aluminum plants to release 13 % fewer tons of air pollutants in 1993 than one year earlier . And biologists say the Volga_River has become healthier since many of the huge chemical plants along its banks have shut_down . But these gains are illusory , ecologists warn . Fewer herbicides and pesticides are flowing into Russian waters only because cash-strapped farms cannot afford to buy them . When the economy improves , they say , factories will resume their lethal output . The reckless disregard of the Siberian oil_company Komineft , which continued to pump for two months while thousands of gallons of oil leaked into the watery tundra , shows that the Soviet-era priority for increasing industrial production at all costs has changed little , environmentalists say . Nature is still seen as inexhaustible and indestructible . Human health and safety have a relatively low value . For years , Nadvoitsy officials brushed_off warnings that the town water was not fit to drink , according to Kudryavtsev , an ecologist who was kicked_out of one Communist_Party meeting for insisting that a 24-mile pipeline must be built to provide the town with safe water . &quot; Our country is great at cosmonauts and weapons , &quot; the ecologist said bitterly . &quot; The leadership didn ' t give_a_damn what kind of water we drank . You don ' t understand how this could happen , but I tell you , it ' s very simple : They just didn ' t care. &quot; Officials also ignored the first cases of tooth disease , which began to appear in the 1970s as fluoride replaced the calcium in growing children ' s teeth and bones . Deprived of calcium , victims do not develop tooth_enamel , and their teeth darken and rot , doctors said . Aluminum plant workers have very high rates of occupational illnesses , but adults who lived_in the town were seemingly unaffected by the fluoride . It was not until the early 1980s , when more_than three-quarters of the town ' s children were suffering at least some symptoms of environmental disease , that officials began looking_for a chemical culprit . &quot; Let God himself judge them , &quot; said Yevgenia Misharina , a 16-year-old high_school student who suffers from fluorosis . She has high cheekbones , wide-set blue eyes and an intoxicating grin . So many Nadvoitsy residents have bad teeth that nobody recoils at her smile . But in front of strangers , she tries to keep her lips closed over the wreckage inside . Yevgenia and her friends say their joints often crack and ache in the morning , and they wonder what will happen to them as they age . They do not trust authorities who say their water is now safe to drink . They just want to grow_up and move_out of town as soon as possible . &quot; I don ' t want my kids to have brown teeth and bad bones and be in and out of the hospital all_the time , &quot; said Anna Sidorova , 15 . Besides teeth and bone problems , Nadvoitsy ' s children also suffer from unusually high rates of liver and kidney_disease , chronic hepatitis and respiratory ailments , including pneumonia , said Tatyana V . Tarasyuk , chief physician at Nadvoitsy hospital . Tarasyuk suspects some of these ailments may be exacerbated , if not caused , by the high levels of environmental pollution . Tarasyuk ' s son also suffers from fluorosis . &quot; It ' s not a pretty sight when he laughs , &quot; she said . Nadvoitsy Aluminum officials have tried to make amends for the tragedy they admit they caused . At its own expense , the factory has dug_up hundreds of yards of contaminated soil and sealed it in huge watertight pits to prevent more toxins from flowing into the lake . Gradually , the level of fluoride in the drinking_water has returned to normal . Using profits from aluminum exports , the factory also distributes free juice and vitamins to all_the town ' s children . It has built a modern dentist ' s office with equipment from Germany and will cap the damaged teeth of any Nadvoitsy resident without charge . It is only a cosmetic fix -- some teeth have crumbled so_much that caps won ' t hold -- but one that has earned the factory tremendous goodwill . The factory has also hired Houston-based Kaiser Aluminum to replace a small fraction of its 1954 vintage equipment with more efficient , less-polluting technology . At its Tacoma , Wash. , plant , Kaiser uses a dry-scrubbing system that recycles airborne fluoride and other pollutants right back into the production process and is offering the same technology to Nadvoitsy and other Russian aluminum plants , said Kaiser ' s site manager , Richard Cable . But with inflation driving_up Russian interest_rates to 170 % per year , the Nadvoitsy factory can little afford to borrow the huge sums needed to undo its toxic legacy . &quot; People understand that we are thinking_of their welfare , &quot; said Anatoly V . Bezrukov , the factory ' s new director . &quot; Maybe we can ' t do everything all at once , but we ' re trying . They understand. &quot; Ecologist Kudryavtsev said it is too soon to applaud . The factory ' s airborne emissions are still so corrosive that plant windowpanes turn cloudy within a year of installation . Not a single pine_tree grows within half a mile of its smokestacks , only anemic willows and low-lying shrubs . &quot; It ' s the fluoride , &quot; Kudryavtsev explained . &quot; It kills the pine needles. &quot; And the toxic fallout continues . Last year , public health authorities told Nadvoitsy residents to stop eating green vegetables from their gardens after they discovered unacceptably high levels of fluoride in locally grown lettuce , parsley and dill . Even today , more_than a decade after the fluoride link was conclusively proven , 5 % to 10 % of kindergartners show symptoms of fluorosis , Tarasyuk said . The townspeople continue to drink from the same lake . Nadvoitsy officials insist that the water is now safe , but Kaiser Aluminum did its own analysis and instructed its staff not to drink it . Although the nearby Segezha paper plant has polluted many alternative water sources , there are local springs within driving distance where residents can draw clean water . But few bother . &quot; In the Russian character is a tendency not to take responsibility for his own health , &quot; Kudryavtsev said . &quot; You can tell him it ' s better not to drink the water , better to boil it , but people will continue to drink it from the tap , as they always did . People think , ' I ' ll live as long as I live . It ' s in God ' s hands. ' &quot; This attitude is reinforced by an unfortunate but widespread folk belief that any kind of pollution -- even radioactivity and heavy metals -- is washed_out of the body by a good belt of vodka . Briefly , in the late 1980s , an angry and powerful grass-roots ecology movement sprang_up in Nadvoitsy , as happened across Russia in the aftermath of Chernobyl . Today , the founder of Nadvoitsy ' s green coalition has moved away in search of better medical_care for her ailing child , and the ecology movement has all but died_out . Townspeople say they are grateful that the aluminum factory is still operating , offers high wages in exchange for the dangerous work and pays salaries on_time . &quot; The factory is the only institution that helps us , &quot; Tarasyuk said . &quot; If there is no factory , there is no town. &quot;</TEXT>
