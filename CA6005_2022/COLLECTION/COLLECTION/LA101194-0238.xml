   <HEADLINE> BUILDUP IN THE PERSIAN_GULF ; IRAQI MOVES PUT RUSSIA IN QUANDARY ; DIPLOMACY : MOSCOW HAS SIDED WITH WASHINGTON BUT WANTS TO RENEW PROFITABLE BUSINESS_RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAQ .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Iraq ' s massing of troops near the Kuwaiti border put Russia in a quandary : Moscow has sided with Washington against Baghdad for reasons of politics and regional stability , but at_the_same_time Russia aims to avoid alienating a country it sees as an important business partner . In recent months , Russia has been moving closer to Iraq , eager to renew one of the Soviet_Union ' s most profitable friendships . Last month , the two countries signed a $ 17-billion economic agreement that Russia hopes will allow it to collect at least part of a $ 7-billion debt and to exploit what it sees as a huge and hungry Iraqi market that will open_up as soon as the United Nations lifts the sanctions against Iraq . Even as the Russian Foreign Ministry urged Iraq on Monday to halt its bellicose troop movements and cooperate with the United Nations , Iraqi Oil Minister Safa Jawad Habubi arrived in Moscow to get a joint oil_production deal ready for launch the moment sanctions against Iraq are lifted . The Persian_Gulf crisis apparently had no impact on the previously scheduled visit . Habubi was reportedly to meet the Russian oil minister and four oil_companies to discuss a $ 2.5-billion contract for Russian help in developing Iraqi oil fields , building a petroleum processing plant in northern Iraq and possibly constructing a new pipeline . The Russian and Iraqi officials &quot; are hopeful for a peaceful settlement of the crisis and feel it possible to thrash_out a number of key issues now , &quot; the Itar-Tass news_agency reported . Less than a week ago , Russian officials were still hopeful that the international trade_embargo against Iraq might be lifted in as little as six months . Together with France and China , Russia had been lobbying the U.N. Security_Council to consider setting a timetable for a partial lifting of sanctions if Iraq continued to behave , recognized the legitimacy of Kuwait ' s borders and complied with other U.N. demands . &quot; The Iraqi leadership assures us that the debts will be paid as soon as Iraq gets a chance to resume its oil exports , &quot; said Alexander M . Kalugin , head of the Iraq section of the Russian Foreign Ministry , in an interview before the troop buildup began . The same Russian firms that build Iraqi roads , airports , pipelines and oil facilities want a chance to get_back into that lucrative market , Kalugin said . &quot; Our technology and equipment is not competitive abroad , &quot; he said . &quot; In Iraq , we could still sell it. &quot; Wails of frustration emanated from other Russian politicians and diplomats who saw those hopes evaporating Monday . Many blamed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for destroying his own case . The former Russian ambassador to the United States , lawmaker Vladimir Lukin , complained to the Russian news_agency Interfax that if Hussein ' s military maneuvers were intended to persuade the Security_Council to lift the sanctions , they had the opposite result . &quot; The provocative actions of Hussein have discouraged any desire by Russia to stand_up in his defense , &quot; said an unnamed diplomat in today ' s editions of the newspaper Izvestia . Izvestia said a second Persian_Gulf_war between Iraq and the Western allies would be &quot; the worst possible development for Russia. &quot; Russia was quick to denounce the Iraqi action last week , and when President Clinton telephoned Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin on Monday , Yeltsin reportedly assured him that Moscow was urging Baghdad to stop the brinkmanship , according to Russian news_reports . Until Iraq overran Kuwait in August , 1990 , Saddam Hussein was one of the Soviet_Union ' s best customers . He bought billions of dollars ' worth of weapons , and unlike other Soviet client states that paid in sugar or bananas or not at all , Hussein paid his bills promptly in &quot; black hard currency &quot; -- oil . By the time the Gulf War began , about two-thirds of Iraq ' s aircraft were Soviet-built , as well as more_than 4 # 000 tanks , roughly 4 # 000 other military_vehicles , surface-to-air_missiles , small_ships and between 800 and 1 # 000 Scud missiles , according to Col . Andrew Duncan of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London . Russian nationalists and defense industry managers complain that Moscow ' s compliance with arms embargoes in the former Yugoslav federation , and Yeltsin ' s pledge last month to curtail arms sales to Iran , show that Russian interests are being sacrificed to appease the West . Arms sales to Iraq are out_of_the_question , the Foreign Ministry ' s Kalugin said . But newly privatized civilian industries are lobbying the Russian government to get the sanctions lifted quickly so they can go_back to waging non-military trade with Iraq . And just as American executives staked out Ho Chi Minh City trying to secure chunks of the Vietnamese market long before the U.S. trade sanctions against Vietnam were lifted , these private Russian companies are already forging unofficial trade ties with Baghdad . For example , one newly privatized firm that produces agricultural equipment in the Altai region of Siberia has already agreed to supply about 1 # 000 harvesters to Iraq , according to Vitaly V . Naumkin , president of the Russian Center for Strategic Research and International Studies . The Siberians are so desperate to sell their equipment before it rusts -- and domestic buyers are so scarce -- that the firm has agreed to deliver the harvesters to Baghdad now and accept payment once the trade sanctions are lifted , Naumkin said . The United Nations would have to approve the transaction , but since harvesters are unlikely to have a dual military use , the deal is expected to go_through , he said . &quot; Nobody here wants to turn Saddam Hussein into the leader of the Middle_East , as he wants , &quot; Naumkin said . But neither can economically imperiled Russia afford an indefinite boycott of its neighbors ' markets , he said . &quot; Russia cannot afford to have new enemies , &quot; Naumkin said .</TEXT>
