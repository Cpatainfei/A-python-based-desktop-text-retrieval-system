   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA ; TEACHERS LEARNING SKILLS FOR THE FUTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About 250 teachers and administrators from the Saddleback Valley Unified School District hit the classrooms this week for a symposium about technology and how to use it . Thursday ' s program , held at Rancho Santa Margarita Intermediate School , offered hands-on training in_use of the Internet -- which links computers throughout the nation into an information network accessible to many -- as well as desktop_publishing , multimedia production and several other high-tech tools . &quot; We want to show people how in the past year things have changed , &quot; said Linda Smith , the district ' s technology specialist . &quot; We want to give an idea of what the future looks_like , and which parts we can use now. &quot; At one workshop , three dozen adults , sitting in scaled-down chairs designed for adolescents , looked_into color screens while getting accustomed to terms like &quot; gif , &quot; &quot; fetch &quot; and &quot; gopher. &quot; Mary Ann Olsen , a teacher at Los Alisos Intermediate School , warned her temporary charges to be patient . Olsen said it would take &quot; hundreds of hours &quot; to learn a &quot; moderate &quot; amount about the Internet . In two years , the district hopes to have all_of its schools connected to the Internet , Smith said . The district ' s high_schools will all have access this fall , she said . In one workshop , Duffy Clark , principal of Mission Viejo High_School , steadied his hand on a computer mouse as he prepared to get_on the information highway for the first time . But Clark encountered a little trouble . He never made_it off the computer equivalent of an on-ramp during a brief presentation about the Internet . &quot; It will just take a little time , &quot; Clark said , smiling . &quot; It ' s like learning how to drive. &quot; JEFF BEAN</TEXT>
