   <HEADLINE> PARENTING ; LIFE WITH BABY ; PREPARATION CAN HELP MAKE THE FIRST WEEKS AT_HOME WITH AN INFANT GO MORE SMOOTHLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You ate the healthiest foods , memorized books about pregnancy and childbirth and became a regular Dr. Kildare on labor and delivery procedures . In short , you ' ve never prepared more for a single event than you have for the birth of your baby . But what happens after that ? Are you ready for the transition to life with a little one ? While a car_seat is required for bringing baby home from the hospital , parents should fasten their own seat_belts for the changes that the little bundle of joy will bring . &quot; Those first few weeks are wonderful , but they can also be difficult in ways parents never even thought about , &quot; said Tammy Yazgulian , the New Arrivals consultant at Northridge Hospital Medical_Center . &quot; Fortunately , just like there are ways to prepare_for the birth of a child , there are ways to prepare that can make the transition easier. &quot; Perhaps the classic way to get a jump_on the big change is by preparing the baby ' s home environment in_advance . &quot; Don ' t wait until you ' re nine months along to say , ' Oh , let ' s get the crib up , ' &quot; said Yazgulian , who has two children of_her_own . &quot; I see it happen all_the time -- premature deliveries that come a week , two weeks or three weeks early . &quot; At the same time , &quot; she advised , &quot; you don ' t want to get_it done too early because then you ' re just standing_in the doorway wondering where the baby is. &quot; Lisa and Scott Nickerson of Woodland Hills set_up a baby ' s room and pre-washed infant clothes in the weeks leading_up to the birth of their son , Cale , 2 1 / 2 years ago . &quot; It was really nice in the sense that I didn ' t have to rush around and do that stuff after he was born , &quot; said Lisa , who is also the mother of a 3 1 / 2-month-old daughter , Esme . &quot; The house was ready to have the baby in terms of physical things. &quot; Along with setting_up the crib , Yazgulian recommends that parents use the weeks leading_up to delivery to prepare in other ways . They should start stocking up_on diapers and , if the mother won ' t be breast-feeding , the kind of formula they plan to use . &quot; By doing that , you ' re preparing and also spreading_out some of the expenses you are going_to incur once the baby comes_home , &quot; Yazgulian said . &quot; It ' s also never too early to buy some child-proofing things like cabinet locks and electrical-outlet covers. &quot; In addition to the readiness of the home , there is also the mother ' s post-delivery physical condition to consider . Antoinette Johnson of Northridge laughs when she remembers the weeks following the arrival of her daughter MacKenzie 2 1 / 2 years ago . &quot; I was denied so_much sleep , I eventually started hallucinating , &quot; Johnson said . &quot; I told my husband I was seeing baby faces on the walls. &quot; As a result , she has some pointed advice for other expectant mothers : &quot; Rest now . Because you ' re never going_to rest again. &quot; Yazgulian said women can prepare somewhat for the disruption of their regular sleep pattern by getting_in the practice of catnapping before the baby is born . &quot; Moms should learn to rest when they can , especially during the day , &quot; she said . &quot; Shade the windows , unplug the phone , put_on some music or read . Basically , try and find a method that will help you relax and fall_asleep when you need to. &quot; Aside from the physical changes , parents should also be aware of the emotional transition they are about to experience . The relationship between a woman and her partner is invariably affected once they become parents . Attention once paid exclusively to each other is now focused , sometimes almost entirely , on a third_person . Lisa Nickerson said it is important for Mom and Dad to make time to be alone . &quot; We ' ve gotten a baby-sitter and gone_out once a week since the birth of our first child , &quot; Nickerson said . &quot; We just go_out by ourselves , maybe only for an hour or two , and have a glass of wine or a beer and talk to each other . It ' s helpful to keep that relationship between a husband and wife separate. &quot; Yazgulian adds that all_the organizing and anticipating in the world can ' t fully prepare prospective moms and dads for the magnitude of what ' s ahead . &quot; It sounds overwhelming , and for most parents , no matter how much you prepare_for this transition , it ' s still going_to feel that way , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
