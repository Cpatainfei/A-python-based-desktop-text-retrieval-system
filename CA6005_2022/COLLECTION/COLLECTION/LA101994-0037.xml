   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 184 ; SPONSOR SAYS JUDGES HELPED WRITE ' 3 STRIKES ' ; LEGAL EXPERTS SAY SUCH JURISTS SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM CASES INVOLVING THE SENTENCING MEASURE . MIKE REYNOLDS REFUSES TO IDENTIFY THOSE WHO HELPED HIM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three judges took a leading role in writing the &quot; three strikes &quot; criminal sentencing law passed_by the Legislature and now up for popular vote on the Nov . 8 ballot , according to the sponsor of the measure . Legal experts are questioning the ethics of judges in lending their expertise to the supporters of the measure , saying they should be disqualified from ruling on any &quot; three strikes &quot; cases . Further complicating the situation , Mike Reynolds , the driving force behind the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative , Proposition 184 , has declined to name the judges he says drafted the measure . No judges have come_forward saying they helped write the law . Reynolds said the judges told him they did not want their names to become known , because lawyers appearing before them on &quot; three strikes &quot; cases might question their impartiality . Reynolds , a professional photographer from Fresno , said he never could have drafted &quot; three strikes &quot; without professional help from lawyers , prosecutors and the judges . Although Reynolds , who entered the political_arena after his daughter was murdered in 1992 , seeks to protect judges he says assisted him , attorneys and other legal_experts contacted by The Times say that any judge who took a hand in formulating the initiative has an ethical obligation to come_forward . &quot; Sounds to me the judges recognized they should disqualify themselves from any motion that would require them to rule on the constitutionality , &quot; said Superior_Court Judge Darrel W . Lewis of Sacramento , a former chairman of the ethics committee of the California Judges Assn . &quot; They should voluntarily disqualify themselves from ruling on any constitutional question about it , &quot; Lewis added , &quot; or at the very least , they should disclose to the participants that they actually played a significant role. &quot; The &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative on the Nov . 8 ballot is identical to legislation signed into law by Gov . Pete Wilson in March . Like the legislation already on the books , Proposition 184 doubles sentences for those who commit a second felony after one that is serious or violent . Criminals who have committed two violent or serious felonies such_as murder , rape or burglary face minimum sentences of 25 years , and possibly far more , if they commit a third felony . Some prosecutors have said portions of &quot; three strikes &quot; are poorly worded and ambiguous . Defense_lawyers and other critics say the law will result in thousands of nonviolent criminals being sent to prison for years . The California Judges Assn . and the California Judicial Council commonly take positions on legislation in Sacramento . But helping to draft a measure for a private person such_as Reynolds goes beyond that , said Municipal Judge Julie Conger of Alameda County . Conger , another former chair of the judges association ' s ethics committee , said any judge who helped author the initiative may have violated a specific canon of judicial conduct which precludes judges from practicing law . &quot; You cannot practice law ( if you ' re a judge ) , &quot; Conger said . Conger said she views_as &quot; suspicious &quot; Reynolds ' statement that judges took a lead role in writing the law . A judge who got involved in such an undertaking would come_forward &quot; if they are true_to the code of judicial conduct , &quot; she said . The authorship became an issue during a televised debate on Proposition 184 last week in the Bay Area . &quot; Three strikes &quot; opponent Vincent Schiraldi charged that the initiative was authored by the National Rifle Assn. , although he said in an interview afterward that he had no proof for the claim . &quot; I ' m very suspicious of covert authorship , &quot; said Schiraldi , who runs the Center_on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco . &quot; We can ' t scrutinize the people who wrote this. &quot; After the debate , Reynolds explained the genesis of &quot; three strikes. &quot; He told The Times that judges took a lead role in drafting the measure , which was then circulated to deputies in the attorney_general ' s office , and other judges . &quot; I ' m going_to tell you who was responsible_for this , &quot; Reynolds said . &quot; They were judges that did the actual pen to paper , the initial draft . . . . A nucleus of three judges did the actual framing and pen to paper , and we took that to other judges , blind . They did not know where it came from. &quot; Explaining why he would not name the judges , Reynolds said : &quot; They asked to stay without identity . There could be at some point a need for them to rule on a ' three strikes ' case and they didn ' t want to placed in a position of partiality . It could affect their position on the bench. &quot; Once before , Reynolds made the statement to The Times about the measure being drafted by judges . Early this year , before &quot; three strikes &quot; qualified for the Nov . 8 ballot , Reynolds said in passing that one of the judges who worked_on the initiative lived_in a particular house in Fresno . The Times checked property records , finding that the home belongs_to Municipal Judge William Kent Levis of Fresno . Levis declined to discuss the authorship of &quot; three strikes. &quot; &quot; I apologize , &quot; Levis said in a telephone_interview recently . &quot; We ' re not supposed to get involved in political situations or political campaigns. &quot; Claiming the issue is &quot; pending &quot; before the voters , he maintained that judicial ethics precluded him from commenting -- a statement disputed by law professors familiar_with judicial canons dispute . &quot; There is a lot of relevant information that people don ' t comment on , &quot; Levis said . Although justices on the state courts of appeal and Supreme Court ultimately will determine the constitutionality of many provisions of &quot; three strikes , &quot; all judges who hear criminal matters , including municipal court judges , will have opportunities to rule on aspects of the law . &quot; A municipal court judge decides whether or not to bind someone over for trial , &quot; said James Thomson , president of California Attorneys for Criminal Justice . &quot; Most dispositions are occurring at municipal court. &quot;</TEXT>
