   <HEADLINE> MOSCOW MAY DAY RINGS OF HISTORY AND RHETORIC ; RUSSIA : LAST YEAR ' S SCENES OF RIOT POLICE AND REBELLION ARE REPLACED BY A CELEBRATION OF SPRING AND THE SPIRIT . AT A WORKERS ' MARCH , HARD-LINE COMMUNISTS BLAST YELTSIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The bells of a Kremlin church silenced for 76 years began tolling the advent of Orthodox Easter just before midnight Sunday , heralding a May_Day holiday on which religion and the pleasures of spring triumphed over political strife . Thousands of die-hard Communists celebrated the international workers ' day with red-flag-filled marches and speeches bashing President Boris N . Yeltsin as an ethically bankrupt traitor who has impoverished his people . &quot; Capitalism is dung , &quot; proclaimed the banner carried by one group of hard-liners . But Easter fell on May 1 this year , and millions more Muscovites celebrated midnight Mass , greeted their neighbors by saying , &quot; Christ is risen , &quot; and feasted on dyed eggs and kulich , a round , sweet Easter cake . Many of the secular visited cemeteries or escaped to their country dachas to revel in the sudden , glorious spring . Last year ' s May_Day turned bloody when hard-line Yeltsin foes brawled with riot police in the streets of Moscow , killing one policeman , injuring hundreds of demonstrators and setting the scene for months of street clashes that ended with a tank attack on the Russian Parliament building on Oct . 4 . This year , the political mood was calmer . The mostly aging demonstrators seemed weary and disorganized . Early Sunday , up_to 8 # 000 demonstrators representing 42 Moscow trade_unions , as well as the Communist_Party of Russia and several other smaller left-wing parties , began gathering under the statue of Vladimir Mayakovsky , chief poet of the 1917 Revolution . Students and children joined the demonstration . Last month , the unions had gathered nearly 2.5 million signatures in Moscow alone on a list of demands that the government pay workers a fair wage on_time , prevent mass unemployment and protect against crime . On Sunday , they marched under the slogan &quot; Economic Policies to Help Working People , Not the Moneybags ! &quot; &quot; I would rather have gone_to the dacha with my family , &quot; said Yegor Gritsov , 14 , who attended the march not out of political conviction but because his school sports coach had organized the outing . &quot; But maybe we will still have some fun , because as you can see , our group is followed by the Communists , and that means there might be some head-bashing. &quot; But riot police stayed off the main marching routes , apparently determined to avoid confrontation , and the protest was held without incident . On the other side of the Kremlin , about 6 # 000 people gathered under a giant Lenin statue in October Square for a separate march organized by hard-liners , including Viktor I . Anpilov , a leader of the October rebellion who was released from prison in February . Anpilov called_for a general strike Oct . 3 -- the anniversary of the assault on government buildings by pro-Parliament protesters that precipitated the government ' s counterattack -- in hopes of toppling the Yeltsin government . But the strike idea was immediately shot down by Communist_Party leader Gennady A . Zyuganov , who noted that Russia ' s economic_crisis has already led to widespread work_stoppages . The event brought_together the strange political bedfellows who characterize the new Russian far left . Some people sold anti-Yeltsin and anti-Semitic materials , some held_up portraits of V . I . Lenin and Josef Stalin , and others waved the czarist flag . One banner read &quot; Christians for Communism. &quot; But the march proceeded peacefully for nearly five miles to the Lenin Hills in southwest Moscow . Some elderly people sang songs from the 1930s , accompanied by an accordion . &quot; Today inspired us with hope that we need no longer be afraid of holidays , &quot; said Georgy Satarov , a Yeltsin aide . Clearly , the Russian religious revival is beginning to influence politics . In an Easter eve survey of 1 # 256 Russians by the Public_Opinion_Polling Service , 41 % said they would celebrate both Easter and May_Day , 39 % said they would celebrate only Easter , and 4 % said they would celebrate only May_Day , which just three years ago was the highest_holiday of the Soviet calendar . The Easter festivities began late Saturday with the ringing of 15 bells from the Ivan the Great bell_tower , a 16th-Century masterpiece in the heart of the Kremlin . The bell-ringing so beloved by Muscovites was banned by Lenin in 1918 . Thousands of people , some holding candles , stood_in Red Square to hear the bells for the first time in their lives . Several thousand more Muscovites , mostly young people , waited outside Epiphany Cathedral , where Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexei II celebrated an all-night Easter Mass attended by Yeltsin , Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin , Moscow Mayor Yuri M . Luzhkov and other notables . The tall , graceful cathedral , newly restored to a robin ' s-egg blue topped with gilded onion domes , was spotlighted for the ceremony . Shortly before midnight , Alexei led a resplendent procession of priests in a circle_around the church . The service , like a czarist-era fairy tale of white and silver robes , icons , clouds of incense , golden crucifixes and sublime singing , was carried live_on national television .</TEXT>
