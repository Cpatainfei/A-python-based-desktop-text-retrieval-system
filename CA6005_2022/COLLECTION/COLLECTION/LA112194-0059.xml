   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; RETROSPECTIVE EXAMINES A PHOTOJOURNALIST ' S ART ; PHOTOGRAPHY : ANNIE LEIBOVITZ ' S PICTURES STRIP AWAY THE PERSONAS OF MEDIA CELEBRITIES WITH WIT AND AFFECTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Annie Leibovitz ' s first real photo assignment was a picture of John Lennon for the cover of Rolling Stone . It was 1970 , she was 21 and still a student . A decade later , the former Beatle was the subject of her most memorable image -- that vaguely shocking icon where he straddles Yoko Ono in fetal nudity was taken_on Dec . 8 , 1980 . A few hours later , he was shot to death by a unhinged admirer . Now Leibovitz is 45 and about as well-known as_many of her subjects . She has won a heap of awards as a photojournalist . She ' s the object of a full-scale international traveling retrospective just opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art titled &quot; Annie Leibovitz , Photographs 1970-1990. &quot; In many ways the Lennon portrait with its pathetic childlike exhibitionism is the artist ' s leitmotif . Her pictures provide a study of 20 years when the world became addicted to celebrity . Consumers of media made its actors into presences more vivid than family or friends . The actors came_to feel that mere fame was not enough . They had to transform themselves into that peculiar entity called a &quot; celebrity &quot; -- someone more renown for being constantly on public view than for whatever it is they do . In order to be real in this milieu , one must be transformed into an illusion . Leibovitz helps foster those illusions with an unusual mixture of wit and affection . In the ' 60s , being famous was something fun . Andy Warhol promised we ' d all experience it for 15 minutes . Leibovitz ' s photographs of him remind us that his most dramatic moment of media fame came June 3 , 1968 , when he was shot by a former admirer . The hoopla would have lasted longer but the media were distracted by the assassination of Robert Kennedy . By now the celebrity cult has grown_into a kind of monstrosity that rivets the world ' s attention on a former football_player and television huckster accused of murdering his wife and her friend . And no wonder Leibovitz depicts Roseanne and Tom Arnold as a_couple_of mud-wrestlers . Leibovitz operates like thousands of other graphic_artists -- she ' s slick , stylish , eclectic and witty . She ' s even iconoclastic when it ' s socially acceptable . What makes her special is the way she pushes the envelope just far enough to achieve density . In her hands topical comedy becomes a subtle morality_play . It tells us that the celebrity sphere is a ring of Purgatory reserved for those so insecure they must constantly ask the world for permission to just be themselves . Leibovitz ' s world is a glamorous , painful , hectic , hypocritical , sometimes lethal place . We see the exhaustion and loneliness of show folk on_the_road in the faces of Mick Jagger , Louis Armstrong and Ray Charles , all still bravely playing their parts . Jane Fonda or Joan Baez try to get a moment ' s peace with their men and , bang , somebody turns_up with a camera . Try to smile , Tom . Are we supposed to feel sorry_for these people ? They asked_for this , after all . Their poignancy is all paradox . They wanted to be rich , powerful and famous and that has its price . Two images get close to the bone . In one , Bob Dylan waters a pathetic little lawn in an anonymous apartment court while wearing white satin . The other shows a presidential honor_guard rolling_up the red_carpet as Helicopter One rises . The unseen passenger is Richard Nixon in disgrace . None of this has any resonance unless we assume that inside these public people there is a private one capable of reflection . When we look_at Liberace or the ancient stripper Sally Rand in their sequins and rhinestones it ' s pretty clear there is nobody home but self-delusion . that ' s kind of lovable . Leibovitz finds the most doubt in writers . Authors like Susan Sontag , Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne look distracted -- as if wondering if this kind of notoriety is really necessary . Norman Mailer appears to relish acting macho in the limelight . The most unflattering portrayals are reserved for those -- like Donald Trump -- who are famous only for being ruthlessly rich . Everybody else , notably the movie people , have ironic or authentic fun allowing their complex personalities to be reduced to visual one-liners . Often Leibovitz hits veins of insight by playing against type . Bette Midler was seen as kind of camp female female-impersonator until Leibovitz laid her down and brought_out her sweetness by covering her with roses . Clint Eastwood is the avenging Dirty Harry to most of us , but Leibovitz was right on when she trussed him up like a cowboy about to be burned at the stake . Eastwood appeals_to people who see themselves as victims . Steve Martin appears delighted to do an impersonation of a Franz Kline painting . Impressively organized by the International Center of Photography in conjunction with the Smithsonian ' s National Portrait Gallery , the exhibition ' s curators are Willis Hartshorn and William Stapp . LACMA curator Robert Sobiezek supervised the local installation . A handsome catalogue is more complete than the show itself and in some ways more rewarding . It ' s nice to look_at photographs sitting_down . * &quot; Annie Leibovitz , Photographs 1970-1990 , &quot; L.A. County Museum of Art , 5905 Wilshire Blvd. , to Feb . 26 , closed Mondays and Tuesdays , ( 213 ) 857-6000 .</TEXT>
