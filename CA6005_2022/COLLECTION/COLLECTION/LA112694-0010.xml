   <HEADLINE> FALLING IN LOVE ISN ' T AS BORING AS SCIENCE SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Behavior is ruled largely by genetics , scientists tell us . Our DNA guides whether we are a hard-driving executive or a moon-bedazzled poet , a vigorous athlete or a desk-bound accountant , even whether we bowl or play bridge in our spare_time or go_to church on Sunday . Even our love lives are manipulated by puppet masters in our genes . Who we love and when we love them -- not to mention when we divorce them -- are often as preordained as our height and hair color , researchers say . But perhaps not how we fall_in_love . Whether love comes creeping_up unexpectedly on little cat feet or strikes with the intensity and furor of a spring thunderstorm may be one of the few aspects of our private relationships in which the nurturing influence of our parents outweighs the mandates of hereditary chemicals , according to new research from psychologists at UC Davis . In a study of twins published in the most recent issue of the journal Psychological Science , Niels G . Waller and Phillip R . Shaver have shown that genes play virtually no role in our approach to ardor , a surprising and refreshing exception in an area that is increasingly seen as being ruled by inflexible DNA , researchers say . &quot; Behavioral genetics has basically gotten boring , because you already know the result before you do the study : There is a substantial genetic contribution and family environment doesn ' t count for anything , &quot; said geneticist Michael Bailey of Northwestern University . The new study ' s conclusion is exciting &quot; because it is so different from everything else that has come up. &quot; The genetics of behavior has proved a fertile field for research and publication in recent years . Most studies of personality indicate that about 50 % of variability among individuals is attributed to genes , with a much smaller percentage resulting from parental influence and the remainder arising from individual life experiences . Several recent books , such_as &quot; Evolution of Love &quot; and &quot; Anatomy of Desire , &quot; have explored the genetic imperatives that created the idea of love and romance in the first place and that have honed the nature of relationships between men and women . Evolutionary behaviorists argue that the &quot; trophy wife , &quot; the young and beautiful woman married by a successful businessman after shedding his older , less glamorous spouse , is the logical outgrowth of the primitive chieftain ' s effort to spread his seed by choosing the woman who superficially appears most fertile . By the same token , the woman ' s willingness to marry the older and , perhaps , less attractive male arises from her need for the protection and resources he can devote to her children , so that her own genetic line will endure . These fundamental imperatives drive all_of us in our search for mates , according to psychologist David Buss of the University of Michigan , &quot; but usually we have to settle for what we can get , which is usually something less than ideal. &quot; In the UC Davis study , Waller and Shaver studied 338 female and 107 male twin pairs identified through the California Twin Registry maintained at the university . About three-quarters of the subjects were identical_twins , the rest fraternal . Studying twins is the most common way to sort_out the varying influences of nature and nurture . Identical twins share all_of their genes , while fraternal twins , on average , share only half of them . If a trait is genetic , identical_twins should share that trait much more commonly than fraternal twins . To analyze each twin ' s &quot; love attitudes , &quot; the researchers used a well-established six-part scale devised by sociologist John A . Lee of the University of Toronto more_than 20 years ago . Because of his previous studies of classical literature , Lee assigned Greek names to the six dimensions of love -- Eros , Ludus , Storge , Pragma , Mania and Agape . The contribution of each dimension to an individual ' s overall love attitude is determined by asking subjects how strongly they agree with a series of 50 questions that illustrates the components . Those who score high on Eros place considerable value on love and passion , are self-confident , enjoy intimacy and self-disclosure and fall_in_love fairly quickly . One of the statements measuring Eros was : &quot; My lover and I were attracted to each other immediately after we met. &quot; Those who score high on Ludus value the fun and excitement of romantic relationships , especially with multiple alternate partners . They are generally not interested in self-disclosure , intimacy or &quot; getting serious. &quot; A sample item : &quot; I try to keep my lover a little uncertain about my commitment to him / her. &quot; The Davis researchers analyzed the answers_for each subject_to determine whether the individual profiles were related to genetics or family nurturing . Their overwhelming conclusion was that &quot; individual differences in romantic love are_due almost exclusively to environment &quot; -- how the child was raised . The study , Waller said , is &quot; the first clear case where the environment . . . is playing a much stronger role than genetics in creating a family resemblance . This is the first set of psychological variables that I know of where heritability plays such a small role. &quot; The researchers also interviewed the spouses of 172 of the twins and found that their views on romantic love were quite similar to their mates ' , a refutation of the adage that opposites attract . There were two major exceptions to that finding , however -- those whose profiles fit_in Mania ( an indicator of obsession ) and Ludus . One interpretation , Waller said , is that when both partners avoid commitment ( Ludus ) or when both partners are dependent and jealous ( Mania ) , it is particularly difficult to maintain a relationship . The researchers speculate that love attitudes may_not be the only trait controlled by a person ' s rearing . In a second study , still under way , Shaver is finding that loneliness is also more a product of nurture than nature . &quot; The take-home message here is that there are strong influences that siblings share , &quot; Waller said . &quot; They may possibly be being exposed to the same parents , growing_up in culturally homogeneous neighborhoods , having similar peer_groups , etc. , which shape their love attitudes. &quot; Moreover , he added , &quot; these shared experiences have a lasting impact on interpersonal relationships . The twins in the study ranged_in age from 16 to 90 , and the older twins were no less similar to one another than the younger . Environmental influences , like genetic , have a lasting impact. &quot; More on Science : From the secrets of DNA to volcanoes on Venus , the TimesLink on-line service has a wide-ranging collection of articles on the sciences .

A series of 50 questions helps determine how large an influence each category plays in their love lives . * Type : Eros ( Passion ) * Characteristics : Value love and passion , are self-confident , enjoy intimacy and self-disclosure , fall_in_love fairly quickly * Type : Ludus ( Fun ) * Characteristics : Value the fun and excitement of romantic relationships , especially with multiple partners * Type : Storge ( Family affection ) * Characteristics : Value friendship , companionship and reliable affection * Type : Pragma ( Pragmatic ) * Characteristics : Practical , entering a relationship only if it meets certain criteria * Type : Mania ( Obsession ) * Characteristics : Desperate and conflicted . Yearn intensely for love , but experience pain and jealousy * Type : Agape ( Spiritual love ) * Characteristics : Centered_on what they give to a partner instead of what they receive .
