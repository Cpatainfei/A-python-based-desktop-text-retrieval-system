   <HEADLINE> MANDELA CLEAR VICTOR IN EARLY VOTE COUNT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nelson Mandela ' s ANC steamroller moved relentlessly toward victory in South_Africa ' s historic all-race elections with a clear majority of the votes counted by early this morning . The African National Congress had captured 53 % , although only about one-third of the ballots cast over four days last week had been tallied , nearly two days after counting started . President Frederik W . de Klerk ' s National Party , which created and abolished apartheid , trailed the ANC with about 28 % of the vote , and looked set to win the Western Cape where the white settlement of South_Africa began 342 years ago .</TEXT>
