   <HEADLINE> IRAQ SENDS TROOPS TO KUWAIT BORDER ; U.S. ISSUES THREAT ; MIDEAST : AS WASHINGTON WARNS IT WOULD INTERVENE , OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE UNSURE WHETHER HUSSEIN IS PLANNING INVASION OR IS POSTURING FOR RELIEF FROM U.N. SANCTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Iraq began massing troops near the Kuwaiti border Friday in an apparent effort to pressure the United Nations into lifting its economic sanctions . The action prompted a blunt warning from President Clinton that Washington will intervene militarily if Baghdad does not stop . At a press_conference at the White_House , Clinton warned that it would be &quot; a grave mistake &quot; for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to repeat the miscalculation he made in August , 1990 , when he invaded Kuwait under the assumption that Washington would not be willing to fight for the tiny emirate . A U.S.-led international coalition drove Hussein ' s forces_out of Kuwait in the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War . A few minutes after Clinton spoke Friday , the Pentagon disclosed that the aircraft_carrier George_Washington , which had been steaming in the Adriatic_Sea , had been ordered to the Red_Sea , accompanied by the guided-missile cruiser San Jacinto , which is equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles . Military authorities also began moving toward the area several maritime pre-positioning ships , which are stationed throughout the globe to transport troops , tanks , ammunition and equipment . They placed several Army and Air_Force units on alert for possible deployment . The Navy said the amphibious_assault ship Tripoli and an accompanying amphibious-ready group were preparing to steam toward the Kuwaiti coast after loading_up troops and equipment in Oman , at the foot of the Persian_Gulf . As Middle Eastern neighbors such_as Saudi_Arabia and Egypt expressed support for Kuwait , the emirate called_up its troop reserves , and its Cabinet went_into emergency session . At the United Nations , Security_Council President David Hannay summoned Iraqi U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoun to explain the troop movements and to warn against provocations that could threaten Kuwait and regional security . &quot; Let it be absolutely clear to the Iraqi government that a repetition of its past mistakes will be met by my government with the same resolve as before , &quot; U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright told the U.N. General_Assembly . A government spokesman in Baghdad admonished the world to mind its own business , saying outsiders &quot; have no right whatsoever to discuss Iraqi troop movements within the boundaries of Iraq. &quot; Iraq ' s enemies are looking_for &quot; false pretenses to prolong their aggression on Iraq and the starvation of its people , &quot; he added . U.S. officials cautioned that it is not yet clear whether the Iraqis actually are planning to invade Kuwait , in a reassertion of its longstanding territorial claim , or simply are posturing in an attempt to pressure the United States and its allies into granting them more concessions to provide relief from the U.N. sanctions . Some analysts raised the possibility that Hussein was ordering the movements mainly to quell dissent within his own army . Reports from Baghdad , the Iraqi capital , have suggested that , in part because of the U.N. sanctions , the Iraqi army suffers a shortage of supplies and low morale . One senior Administration official said intelligence reports have suggested that Iraqi forces had been rounding_up dissidents throughout the country recently , cutting_off their left ears and carving Xs into their foreheads . And there were reports of an uprising last week . The Iraqi buildup involves about 40 # 000 to 50 # 000 troops , including two divisions of the elite Republican Guards . The push began Thursday , and the units sped toward the border Friday . Officials said the leading elements were only about 18 or 19 miles from Kuwait . Senior Administration officials said the United States will step_up its reconnaissance of the Persian_Gulf region -- by repositioning spy_satellites and increasing the number of reconnaissance flights -- to enable authorities to track the Iraqi movements more closely . &quot; We are going_to continue to watch this for the next 24 or 48 hours to see how things develop &quot; before finally deciding what action to take , one official said . &quot; We are not overreacting in any way . We are going_to do our best to send an important signal &quot; to Iraq . The mood in Washington was tense . Clinton ' s top national security advisers met in the late afternoon , in part to review the situation , and officials said that further decisions might come sometime this weekend after Washington gets a better idea of Iraqi intentions . But U.S. strategists strongly implied that if the Iraqis continued to pour troops and equipment into the area , the United States would launch heavy attacks -- possibly including both air_power and precision-guided missiles . White_House officials said Friday that Clinton met late in the day with Prince Saud al Faisal , the Saudi_Arabian foreign_minister , and won a pledge that the Saudi government would again cooperate with U.S. forces . And the_British Ministry of Defense announced that it was sending an extra frigate , the Cornwall , to patrol off Kuwait . The United States now has only a_few hundred soldiers in Kuwait , and the border is largely undefended . During the Persian_Gulf_War , U.S. forces used Saudi airfields as staging bases for air strikes and armored operations . Part of the dilemma facing policy-makers is that U.S. troops , aircraft , ships and equipment are stationed so far from the area that it is likely to take several days to deploy U.S. forces in Kuwait . As a result , officials must move quickly to anticipate Iraqi action . At the same time , strategists said Hussein is adept at feigning hostilities and pushing to the edge before pulling_back . If Washington sends a sizable military contingent , it could be tied_up indefinitely . U.S. officials speculated that Iraq launched its troop movements toward the border to help pressure other countries -- particularly Russia and France -- to go_along with its bid to lift the U.N. sanctions . Many Security_Council members want to grant Baghdad ' s request , but the United States , which has veto power in the council , has opposed it . The Security_Council is expected to take_up the issue formally Monday . Senior Administration officials said the push by Iraq is more likely to solidify allied opposition to lifting the sanctions than to split the major_powers further . Officials said Iraq also might have assumed that Washington would be too tied_up militarily in Haiti to send troops to the Middle_East . But Clinton sought to dispel that notion , saying : &quot; Saddam Hussein should be under no illusions . The United States is not otherwise occupied. &quot; However , the move by Iraq did raise questions among some observers about how effectively the United States would be able to mount military operations against Iraq while it has more_than 20 # 000 troops -- and many of its transport aircraft -- tied_up in Haiti . Both Pentagon and private analysts asserted Friday that the United States would have no major difficulties in meeting both challenges . Much of any U.S. operation in Iraq would be carried_out by bombers or missiles . Officials said only 15 # 000 troops might be involved . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry told reporters that U.S. forces are &quot; prepared to make any necessary troop deployments &quot; that Clinton orders . &quot; We have substantial capabilities in the region &quot; already , he noted . Analysts said that Iraq now is much weaker than it was in 1990 . U.S. officials said the force that Iraq has assembled near the Kuwaiti border does not necessarily mean that Iraq is planning to invade . Baghdad often moves its divisions , and carried_out similar moves six months ago , the last time the sanctions issue was_on the table . The United States has 80 warplanes and 800 troops in the region , along with substantial supplies of tanks , ammunition , parts and other equipment stockpiled in Kuwait and Saudi_Arabia since the 1991 war . Times staff writer David Lauter contributed to this report . A White_House Warning As Iraqi Deputy Prime_Minister Tarik Aziz complained to the United Nations about trade curbs imposed during the Persian_Gulf crisis , Iraqi troops amassed at the Kuwait border . President Clinton later warned Baghdad not to repeat the mistake of invading Kuwait . He also put troops on alert . Aziz : &quot; The United States of America is persistently obstructing any steps . . . particularly those provisions relating to lifting sanctions from Iraq , and is conducting itself on the basis of biased political motives. &quot; Clinton : &quot; Saddam Hussein should be under no illusion . . . It would be a grave mistake for ( Him ) to believe for any reason that the United States would have weakened its resolve. &quot; Iraqi Troop Movements Defense_Secretary William J .
