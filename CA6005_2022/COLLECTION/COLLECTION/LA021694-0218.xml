   <HEADLINE> CONGRESSMEN ENDORSE IMMIGRANT INITIATIVE ; POLITICS : MEASURE THAT WOULD DENY SERVICES TO ILLEGAL MIGRANTS NEEDS 385 # 000 SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY . CRITICS CHARGE THE PROPOSAL IS RACIST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two local congressmen on Tuesday endorsed a proposed state initiative to require state and local agencies to report suspected illegal immigrants to the Immigration and Naturalization Service , deny them social_services and access to a public education , and make_it a felony to manufacture or use false citizenship documents . Speaking at a Newport Beach news_conference which also featured the co-authors of the proposed initiative , Reps . Ron Packard ( R-Oceanside ) and Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) said it was time for state and local officials to take a stand on a problem that has aggravated California ' s economic woes . Packard , who succeeded in amending federal disaster relief legislation to deny long-term assistance to illegal immigrants , said that &quot; nothing will stop them &quot; from continuing to stream across the border as long as federal_government policies remain unchanged . &quot; We must cut_off the attraction through cutting funds , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s simply unfair to taxpayers. &quot; Current policies , he said , are &quot; schizophrenic &quot; because federal laws prohibit illegal immigration , yet those who break those laws are entitled to benefits such_as a public education and medical treatment in publicly funded hospitals . The &quot; SOS &quot; ( Save Our State ) initiative , being circulated since January , needs 385 # 000 signatures by April 22 to be placed on the November state ballot , said co-author Harold Ezell , a former western regional commissioner of the INS . Alan Nelson , the initiative ' s other author and head of the INS from 1982 to 1989 , was also present at the news_conference . The organizing committee is seeking to collect a half million signatures , Ezell said . &quot; It is our belief we ' re going to have a landslide on this thing. &quot; So far , about 3 # 000 signatures have been obtained , but Ezell said signatures were now being collected at the rate of 2 # 000 a day . The initiative , if passed , would : * Exclude illegal immigrants from all publicly funded schools in California , from kindergarten through college . Ineligible students already enrolled would be given a transition period to return to their native country . * Exclude illegal immigrants from public health_care except in emergencies . * Make_it a felony , punishable by a $ 750 # 000 fine and five years in prison , to make , sell or use false citizenship documents . * Require law_enforcement officers as well as employees of many state and local agencies to report any suspected illegal immigrants to the state_attorney general and to the INS . Leaders of immigrant rights groups expressed outrage over the proposed initiative . &quot; I would like to know when persecution of the hardest-working and lowest-paid people I know is going_to stop , &quot; said Becky Esparza , former chair of the Orange County Coalition for Immigration Rights . &quot; I understand that the economy is_on the downswing . . . but scapegoating people not responsible_for what is happening , I don ' t understand that. &quot; She said the initiative is &quot; targeting a specific race of people &quot; -- immigrants from Mexico . But Rohrabacher said &quot; those who suggest this is racist are trying to obfuscate honest discussion of the problem . You will find the vast majority of Mexican-Americans will support the initiative. &quot; Msgr . Jaime Soto , the Roman_Catholic Vicar for the Hispanic Community , said , &quot; Anti-immigrant sentiments always accompany -- or is the consequence of -- economic hard times. &quot; Soto acknowledged that some legal immigrants may favor stemming the tide of illegal immigration , but this was because they &quot; suffer from historical amnesia and forget their own past . That doesn ' t justify this initiative . &quot; Political leaders must accept some responsibility for their sins of omission , &quot; he added . &quot; These angry reactions against immigrants . . . are displaced anxiety . Unfortunately , they have chosen to cater to and exploit people ' s fears instead of showing courage and insight. &quot;</TEXT>
