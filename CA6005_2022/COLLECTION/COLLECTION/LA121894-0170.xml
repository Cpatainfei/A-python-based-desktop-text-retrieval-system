   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : SPECIAL REPORT / HOT TIPS ; WHAT ' S COMING , WHEN , AND WHY IT ' S A BIG DEAL ; DIZZYING ARRAY OF NEW VIDEO_GAME PLAYERS DUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Video game buffs who want better , faster , higher-resolution play with cooler graphics will be able to buy machines that offer all that and more in 1995 , a year that ' s shaping_up as an exciting but tumultuous watershed for the industry . A horde of new game consoles will descend on the market next year , creating uncertainty and conceivably slowing overall sales as even the most avid video_game players falter at the sudden range of options displacing what used to be an easy Nintendo-Sega coin toss . Bruce Ryon of Dataquest says his prediction for 1995 is that consumers will become &quot; very , very confused about what video_game player to buy . Sony vs . Atari vs . 3DO vs . Nintendo vs . Sega ? Sixteen-bit vs . 32-bit vs . 64-bit ? &quot; The number of American homes with CD-ROM_drives in their personal_computers is expected to more_than double next year to 10 million as_many consumers opt to invest in PC-based game play instead . Quadruple-speed drives , twice as fast as those now available , will dominate sales by next spring . As the market reaches a critical mass , the price of CD-ROM software will drop , and the budding industry may even figure_out a way to market its products effectively . At the same time , there will be a massive shake-out of the hundreds of small CD-ROM software developers that have sprung_up over the last two years . The quality of titles will improve as the price of entry climbs closer to the 1994 record of $ 5 million spent on producing a CD-ROM game . The much-predicted dominance of Microsoft Corp . in games and other home software -- a new area for the software giant in 1994 -- will likely come_to pass . Taking it month by month : January will likely bring lower prices for the 16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis , as retailers close_out what will be the last big Christmas for the 5-year-old machines . February and March will see the release of Atari ' s CD-ROM adapter for its 64-bit cartridge system currently on the market ( $ 150- $ 200 ) , and perhaps the initial shipments of Sega ' s Saturn and Sony ' s Playstation , both 32-bit systems favorably received in Japan this year . In April , Nintendo promises a semi-portable device called &quot; Virtual Boy , &quot; complete with goggles . By June , the Saturn and the Playstation ( both about $ 350 ) should be widely available , leaving consumers to ponder whether to buy one for the summer months or wait till fall , when Nintendo ' s &quot; Ultra-64 &quot; -- a cartridge game machine developed in collaboration with high-end computer manufacturer Silicon Graphics -- is_due out , with a price_tag of about $ 250 . Apple Computer ' s first consumer entertainment device , a hybrid computer and video_game console based on a modified version of Motorola ' s Power PC microprocessor , is expected in October or November , as is an advanced version of the 3DO console also incorporating the new chip . It will be a make-or-break year for the upstart 3DO , which has offered superior game play_at a higher price for the last year . Sales of the machine have reached 2 million worldwide after a slow start , but its main advantage -- being ahead of the competition -- will disappear next year as deep-pocketed rivals enter the market . Meanwhile , new ways to play games over telephone and cable lines will bring additional competition for game players ' attention . The Sega Channel will become available in many markets , and Catapult Entertainment ' s network , which allows subscribers to play popular Sega and Nintendo games with each other in real time over phone_lines , will be rolled_out across the country . Fujitsu , which purchased on-line game technology developed by George Lucas ' firm this year , is expected to offer a sort of cyberspace Dungeons &amp; Dragons in the first_quarter . Which of the platforms will emerge victorious will depend largely on what games are available to play_on them . The year will see several video_games based on major movies -- and vice-versa , as Hollywood continues to ramp up its investment in the game industry . Despite being the first full year of an industry-wide rating_system , games won ' t be any less violent -- so look_for continued wrangling with Congress and consumer groups as interactive software becomes an increasingly greater cultural force . ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) HOME TECHNOLOGY What : Nintendo Ultra-64 When : Late 1995 Why it ' s important : If it costs as little as Nintendo says , the super-fast cartridge-based game machine could be a bigger hit than any of its CD-ROM competitors .</TEXT>
