   <HEADLINE> WASC DIVERSITY STATEMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * The Western Assn . of Schools and Colleges approved a 20-page &quot; statement on diversity &quot; over the objections of 14 colleges and universities , including USC , Stanford , and Caltech ( Feb . 23 , 24 ) . We objected because we believe WASC is overreaching its legitimate authority and purpose , not because we objected to the diversity statement itself . There is nothing in the document that we could not live with ; in fact , our own commitments and achievements with_respect_to diversity go well beyond the document and well beyond the commitments and achievements of the vast majority of institutions that are accredited by WASC . Over the years accrediting agencies have grown increasingly bureaucratic , and have begun to intrude more and more into the life of established colleges and universities in a misguided effort to &quot; improve &quot; them . The net result has not been an improvement of American higher education , but rather a further restriction of each institution ' s ability to formulate and pursue its own unique goals and objectives . Of course , those of us in academe should be held accountable for our actions . We are in fact held accountable to the law by the courts and by myriad state , federal , and local agencies . We are directly accountable to our board of trustees , who hold the university in trust for the benefit of humanity . And , most important of all , we in private higher education are directly accountable to our students and their parents , who can take their tuition money elsewhere at a moment ' s notice . The United States is universally admired for having the finest system of higher education in the world . No one I ' ve ever met believes this extraordinary level of excellence is_due to increasingly intrusive accrediting bodies or increasingly burdensome governmental regulation . Rather , the excellence of our colleges and universities is attributed to their freedom to be different from each other -- to their ability to take risks and chart their own destinies in a highly competitive environment .
