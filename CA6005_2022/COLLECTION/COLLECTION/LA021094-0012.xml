   <HEADLINE> WINE : YOUNG WINES BUILT TOUGH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the waiter arrives_at your table with that Cabernet Sauvignon you ordered and the bottle is relaxing on its side , nestled in a silver wire basket , can you be sure he didn ' t flip the bottle three times over his head before laying it in its cradle ? And could you tell the difference if he had ? Wine is believed to be a very fragile thing . Snooty collectors swear all wines have to be stored on their sides ( to keep the corks moist ) at precisely 54 degrees with a humidity of 77.34 % , and that any light or vibration is death . They claim that any heat at all ruins the wine . They say they can tell if you cared_for it properly -- ideally , I suppose , by keeping it resting in its original wooden case , top still nailed shut , underneath your house , preferably covered by a mound of earth . Bosh , I say . Wine is a heck of a lot sturdier than that . Coddling it may make you feel better , but likely as not , most wine isn ' t going_to spoil if you leave it on the kitchen counter for three days , or three weeks , or even mistreat it for a day or two . In fact , some torture might actually help a young wine . Not long ago I tried a test that shocked 16 experienced tasters . I took a bottle of a fine 1989 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon and put it in the trunk of my car . I left it there for five weeks , driving all_over the county during one of the hottest parts of the summer . Finally , I pulled the wine out of the trunk and placed it alongside another bottle of the same wine that had been resting_on its side in my wine_cellar , unmoved , undisturbed from its 60-degree home . A week later , I placed both wines in brown paper_bags , removed the foil capsules and the corks , and replaced the branded corks with blanks , so the tasters would have no clue what was up . * I then poured the wine for the 16 and asked only one question : Which wine do you like better ? Everyone said the wines were very close_in aroma , and almost identical in taste , but 12 of the 16 preferred the bottle that spent its summer vacation just north of my transaxle . Why ? I suspect that this wine , being very young and tannic , needed to be handled roughly if it was to be appreciated so early in life . The wine clearly was made to be aged for a long_time , and one way to accelerate its aging a bit and make_it more approachable was to beat it up . Obviously , I ' m not suggesting that everyone store young red_wines in car trunks , but this little exercise was one bit of evidence that wine is far less fragile than some people think . Most young wine benefits from some aeration , so another way to make a young wine taste better is to splash it roughly into a decanter or water pitcher and give it the air that will help open_up the aroma . I was convinced of this the other day after evaluating a group of 1992 Pinot Noirs . Many of the wines were so young ( most had been bottled only months earlier ) they lacked the aroma and character I knew they should have . So after the formal part of the tasting , I dumped the best of them into decanters and allowed them to sit for an hour . Tasting them again , I found two of the wines , both rather inexpensive , had improved markedly . Some of the more expensive wines also were improved , but not as much . The wine I felt improved the most was the 1992 Napa Ridge Pinot Noir , which has a suggested retail price of $ 7 but is occasionally discounted to below $ 6 . The initial aroma had been mildly interesting with a bit of cherry and some simple flavors -- a quaffable little wine . With aeration , however , the wine showed more complexity and actually took_on what seemed to be better body . * Many people worry not only about overheating wine but about freezing it . Take the case of the mysterious floating stuff . A reader once wrote that when she forgot to chill a white_wine for a dinner_party she tossed it into the freezer 90 minutes before the guests arrived . That was too long -- when she was ready to serve the wine , it was frozen nearly solid . Some time later , with most of the bottle thawed , she noticed stuff floating around in the wine , and she thought the wine had been spoiled . She asked what to do . The answer was : Drink around them . The floating stuff was tartrates , which are naturally , but invisibly , present in wine . Most wineries these days chill wine before bottling specifically to cause these tartrates to crystallize , so they can be filtered_out of the wine . The only reason to do this is that if the tartrates are left in , some can eventually crystallize in the bottle and buyers might then complain about the &quot; glass &quot; they found in their wine . This woman had apparently found a winery that doesn ' t chill its wines . But the crystals are harmless and nearly tasteless , so when she feared her frozen wine would be spoiled , she was only partly right . She could drink the wine , but the crystals are no fun to taste . Otherwise , a bottle of wine that has been frozen is not generally spoiled , nor will most people notice much of a difference -- unless they try to drink it while it is still frozen . One thing you should avoid is standing a bottle of wine in bright light , especially ultraviolet_light . White_wine bottled in clear glass ( the bottle companies call this color &quot; flint &quot; ) are susceptible to getting a light-struck character , which smells skunky , like burnt matchsticks . In this sense , light can be far more detrimental than temperature . The worst temperature damage comes from fluctuation , which can harm wine badly . If you walk into a liquor_store in winter and are warmed by its heater and then months later you revel in its wonderful air conditioning , beware the wine storage . Old wine , of course , is a different matter . It is fragile and should be protected from any changes in its storage . It doesn ' t have the constitution to ward_off the changes that are certain to occur from bad storage . But young wine is far more resilient . So don ' t worry about that bottle of Cabernet you left in the trunk for two days . It ' ll be fine .</TEXT>
