   <HEADLINE> PROSECUTORS TARGETING BLACK JURORS , SIMPSON TEAM SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a series of testy exchanges between a prosecutor and a prospective juror in the O.J. Simpson murder trial Thursday , Simpson ' s attorneys accused government lawyers of treating black jury candidates differently than others . It was the latest defense attack in a case in which race has long loomed as an issue , and prosecutors immediately denounced it as a calculated public relations tactic . The defense comments appeared carefully choreographed , with Simpson ' s two lead attorneys simultaneously addressing reporters on different floors of the Downtown Criminal_Courts Building . &quot; If there is a pattern , we ' ll be asking the judge to look_into it , &quot; Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , one of the lawyers , told reporters on the 12th floor . &quot; We ' re really concerned about the tenor of the questions and the way they go_after certain jurors. &quot; Meanwhile , in the lobby , Simpson attorney Robert L . Shapiro was telling the rest of the press corps : &quot; It implies an insidious effort to try to get black jurors removed for cause because they are black , because they have black heroes , and because O.J. Simpson is one of them . There ' s no other reason. &quot; In addition to the issue of how black prospective jurors are being questioned , defense sources accuse prosecutors of using a disproportionate number of their challenges so far to seek the removal of black panelists . Prosecutors have long said that they hope to impanel a racially mixed jury to hear the murder case against Simpson , who has pleaded not_guilty to the June 12 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman . Simpson is black ; both victims were white . Of the 33 panelists who remain in contention after in-depth questioning , 18 are black . Eight are white , three are Latino , two are Native_American and two are of mixed race . On Thursday , prosecutors declined to respond directly to the latest attack by Simpson ' s lawyers , but accused their adversaries of trying to score points with the public . &quot; This appears to be just the latest in a series of efforts to try to manipulate public_opinion , &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . William Hodgman said . &quot; In the midst of jury selection , I think that is very inappropriate and unfair. &quot; Although defense_attorneys have privately been discussing the issue for several days , it flared_up publicly Thursday after an unusually pointed exchange between Hodgman and a 71-year-old black South-Central man who had difficulty remembering the answers he gave on a juror questionnaire last month and who became increasingly defensive as the prosecutor questioned him . When the man said he had heard something about a polygraph , Hodgman asked : &quot; Do you know what a polygraph is ? &quot; The man took offense at that question and others posed by Hodgman , at one point exclaiming : &quot; You ' re pumping me as if I ' m on_trial . You ' re sort of riling me. &quot; Cochran , a longtime admirer of Hodgman , nevertheless sharply criticized his counterpart for the way he treated the man and another prospective juror earlier this week . In the earlier exchange , Hodgman pressed a black_woman with questions about her paranoid schizophrenic brother until she broke_down in tears , prompting Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito to intervene and apologize . &quot; I don ' t think I ' d make a juror cry , &quot; Cochran said Thursday . &quot; I don ' t think I ' d make a juror say : ' I ' m riled up. ' &quot; Defense_attorneys also were angry about the spirited , and ultimately successful , campaign that prosecutors waged to have another black_woman excused from the panel after she expressed doubts about some aspects of the prosecution case but insisted that she could be fair despite those doubts . After that woman was excused , Shapiro was furious , saying : &quot; My blood is boiling. &quot; Cochran said he too was bothered by the prosecutors ' determination to have that panelist removed : &quot; They finally got her excused . She said she could be fair , but they persisted and got her off. &quot; Although he declined to take questions about jury selection , Hodgman said prosecutors were not attacking anyone . &quot; We are proceeding very , very carefully and very , very cautiously , &quot; he said . &quot; From the very beginning , I ' ve sought to have fairness and humanity for our individual jurors. &quot; The man who was at the center of Thursday ' s exchange was allowed to remain on the jury panel , but three others were excused . Since questioning of the prospective jurors began , 63 have been interviewed by the judge and lawyers , and 30 have been excused . Most of those who have been dismissed have admitted violating Judge Ito ' s order that they avoid all television , radio , newspapers and magazines -- and that they not so_much as enter a bookstore . Ito imposed that order Oct . 18 after the release of a salacious book that allegedly tells the story of Nicole Simpson ' s final months . Since imposing that order , Ito has taken a hard line with prospective jurors , dismissing any who have had the slightest contact with media . Among other prospective jurors who have been excused in recent days are a man who watched cartoons with his grandson and a woman who watched a Barbara Stanwyck movie on television . Thursday , a 29-year-old woman from the Santa Clarita Valley said she had watched videotaped episodes of &quot; Beverly Hills 90210 &quot; and &quot; Melrose Place. &quot; Her husband made the tapes , deleting the commercials as he went . But not even those precautions were enough to satisfy Ito . &quot; The order is no TV at this point , &quot; he said . &quot; Watching tapes of TV_programs is a no-no. &quot; Some prospective jurors have been excused for other reasons as well . Thursday , one man said he was bothered by interracial marriage and believed that blacks were responsible_for violent crime in his Harbor Gateway neighborhood . After a brief conference with the lawyers at the bench , Ito excused him . Although jury selection has lasted longer than a month , more_than 20 candidates remain to be questioned from the first group alone . If 12 jurors and eight alternates cannot be found from that group , more_than 200 other prospective jurors have completed detailed questionnaires and could be called_in for interviews and possible service . In the meantime , Ito still is trying to resolve a number of issues that will help establish the parameters for the trial . Thursday , Ito returned to an issue that has surfaced in varying ways for weeks -- the admissibility of evidence seized from Simpson ' s Ford Bronco . The defense has mounted a number of challenges to that evidence , first arguing that the warrant authorizing police to seize the car was improperly drafted , then maintaining that police were wrong to keep re-entering the car for subsequent searches once it was in their custody . Ito rejected both those arguments , but the defense has mounted another attack on some of the Bronco evidence , arguing that a June 15 break-in of the car rendered anything taken from it after that date inadmissible . Among other things , police searched the car after that time with a substance known as Luminol and discovered what investigators say was blood . On Thursday , Simpson ' s lawyers argued that the break-in of the car -- a tow-yard employee acknowledged entering the car and removing receipts signed by O.J. Simpson and his ex-wife -- broke the official chain of custody of the vehicle . They hoped to show that police supervision of the vehicle was so lax that evidence inside the car could now be unreliable . Trying to head_off that argument , prosecutors called Detective Richard Haro , one of the LAPD investigators who worked_on the Simpson case , who testified that he had placed a hold_on the car . The tow-yard manager agreed , saying that the car was stored in a closed facility . Still , Simpson ' s attorneys emphasized that once the car had been broken into , there was no way to guarantee that evidence found after that was untainted . Subsequent searches revealed more bloodstains and other items , including a missing light_bulb that investigators have speculated Simpson removed to avoid illuminating the cab of the car as he was entering or leaving it on the night of the murders . But without clear supervision of the car , there is no way to tell who removed the light_bulb , much less to conclude what that person ' s motive might have been , said Simpson attorney Gerald F . Uelmen . &quot; We are left to speculation , &quot; he argued . Uelmen also used the session to reiterate an essential part of Simpson ' s defense : that investigators and others connected with the case were sloppy and careless in investigating the murders with which Simpson is charged . Under questioning from Uelmen , for instance , Haro acknowledged that he did not check a box on a form used to request a special hold_on vehicles . And the tow-yard manager , Robert B . Jones , admitted that people could have entered the vehicle without his knowledge and that he had failed to promptly notify the LAPD of the break-in despite city regulations requiring that he do so &quot; without delay. &quot; The attacks on the investigators have not succeeded in persuading Ito to disallow much of the evidence in the murder case , but Simpson ' s attorneys hope that the accumulation of those criticisms will undermine the prosecution case in the eyes of jurors . Ito took the latest request under submission , saying he needed to review transcripts of a previous hearing before issuing his ruling . * COURTROOM SCIENCE : Precedent upheld on scientifically acceptable evidence .
