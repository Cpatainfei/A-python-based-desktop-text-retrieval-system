   <HEADLINE> CAMPAIGN ' 94 : ISSUES AND ANSWERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three candidates are running in the Nov . 8 election to represent the 48th Congressional District . They are Democrat Andrei Leschick of Valley Center , Peace and Freedom candidate Donna White of San Diego and Republican Ron Packard , the incumbent , of Carlsbad . Health_Care Leschick : &quot; I support universal national health_insurance , providing consumers a full choice between private providers , financed by a broad-based national sales tax , incorporating cost controls through competition , malpractice law reform , reduction of red_tape , and stiff penalties to prevent fraud and abuse . . . . ( I support ) a system that includes reasonable co-payments for certain services to discourage abuse and to encourage proper individual health maintenance . I also support standardized forms to reduce the cost of paperwork , which now represents 25 % of the total cost of health_care in America . . . . I oppose using employer mandates to finance health_care because they drive_up the cost of American labor , reduce employment and create bureaucracies . . . . ( A national sales tax to finance health_care ) is fair and efficient because it will encourage savings and investment and because it will apply to services and imports as well as American-made products. &quot; White : Did not respond . Packard : &quot; As a former health-care provider , I am anxious to contribute my ideas to the debate about health_care reform . I do not support the Clinton-Mitchell-Gephardt approaches to turning one-seventh of our economy over to the federal_government . One only needs to examine the programs already administered by the federal_government -- Medicare , Medicaid and welfare -- to know that waste , fraud , abuse and escalating costs would replace the efficient market-driven industry we now enjoy in America . I support the reform embodied in the Republicans ' health_care reform bill . . . . It expands access while preserving choice and containing costs . It does so without new taxes , government price_controls , or complex bureaucracies . It also prohibits insurance_companies from refusing coverage for people who switch jobs and allows Americans the luxury of choosing their own family_doctor ; ( it keeps ) intact the patient-doctor relationship that the Clinton-Mitchell-Gephardt plans would destroy. &quot; Education and Health_Care Benefits for Illegal Immigrants Leschick : &quot; I strongly support the efforts of the states and municipalities to seek federal financial assistance for immigrant education and social_service expenses . All of America enjoys the benefits immigrants provide to our work_force and culture ; all_of America should pay the costs . I also support efforts to create and strictly enforce fair and reasonable laws affecting immigrants and guest workers and protect civil_rights , including the establishment of a tamper-proof North_American identification card , a modern expanded guest-worker program and the creation of a guest-worker tax and insurance account to pay_for their health and social_service expenses . I oppose proposals that would deny education and health_care services to any children living_in the U.S. both because of the dangerous and expensive impact to public safety and because these proposals are contrary to fundamental American principles and long-term national interests. &quot; White : Did not respond Packard : &quot; I favor ending taxpayer-financed benefits for illegal aliens . An amendment I authored was passed as part of the earthquake disaster bill in January . My amendment excluded illegal aliens from receiving long-term disaster assistance , with the exception of emergency medical_care . . . . Providing benefits to those who break the law to enter this country undermines our laws and acts_as a magnet , attracting thousands across our borders to take_advantage of free health , education and welfare . Americans are tired_of feeding more and more of their hard-earned dollars to support those who have broken our laws to come_into this country . Shouldn ' t the government make every effort to identify illegal immigrants and exclude them from receiving benefits ? You bet it should . But most Americans would be appalled to know that federal agencies make no attempt to identify a person ' s legal_status . It is absolute hypocrisy that we forbid employers under penalty of law to hire illegal immigrants , while at_the_same_time our federal agencies that dispense benefits are not required to even make an attempt to determine a person ' s legal_status . I intend to end this practice. &quot; Crime Leschick : Platform includes support of &quot; truth-in-sentencing &quot; laws , boot camps for juvenile offenders and work programs &quot; to make criminals pay_back their debt to society and to their victims. &quot; It supports community policing to include crime prevention , substance_abuse and after-school programs and &quot; values-based &quot; education to teach ethics and respect of the law . &quot; I strongly support a ' three strikes ' law , which would assure incorrigible and dangerous felons remain behind bars . However , the current California law as written may inadvertently apply to non-dangerous felons whose incarceration costs may divert funds from truly dangerous criminals and result in increased costs and taxes . . . . The biggest crime problem facing Southern California and America today is unemployment . . . . Building a new economy , creating constructive jobs , putting people to work is the most essential and cost-effective solution to crime in America. &quot; White : Did not respond Packard : &quot; There are many reasons to oppose the $ 33-billion crime bill now before Congress . However , one provision points to the very core of the crime problem and why the Democratic Party leaders controlling our government are incapable of dealing with the crime problem . The bill denies us the right to fill the very spiritual void that is responsible_for our crime crisis . It makes_it virtually impossible to impart to our young people such basic values as the Ten Commandments . The $ 630-million Family and Community Endeavor schools grant program , more commonly known as FACE , funds crime-prevention programs designed to reach the most vulnerable members of our communities -- our kids . The bill ' s language states that none of the money may be used for religious worship or instruction . This means teaching kids the Ten Commandments is prohibited . . . . Our children need to understand that values are important , respect for others is paramount and community participation is vital ( as well as ) being responsible_for and accountable for your actions . . . . If we fail to teach these lessons , we doom the future of this country to the fatal grip of lawlessness and violence -- anarchy. &quot; El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station Leschick : &quot; My plan helps us protect our national security by preserving our defense industrial capability while at_the_same_time utilizing it to produce a clean , fast and efficient high-speed ground transport system for Southern California based on magnetic_levitation ( maglev ) train technology , integrated with automated people-movers and electric station cars . . . . I oppose creation of a commercial airport at El Toro because there is a better alternative , in terms of both community environmental impact ( and ) economic impact and job creation . Rather than construct new airports , Southern California needs an integrated high-speed ground transportation network which puts an international airport -- without runways , noise , or potential crashes -- conveniently close to every community . To create the city of the future for developers and residents , El Toro should be utilized as a maglev station : check your bags , get your boarding pass , catch your first flight -- 250 m.p.h. &quot; magnetic flight &quot; to the runway -- aboard a maglev USA system designed and produced in Southern California. &quot; White : Did not respond Packard : &quot; I oppose the development of an international airport at El Toro . I have studied and participated in the planning and implementation of transportation and aviation projects during my service in Congress . I am convinced that in the long term , an airport that must be built to truly serve Southern California ' s needs will not be at El Toro . Southern California will not have four small , regional airports ; one for Los Angeles County , another for Orange County , another for San Diego County and still another for the Inland Empire . The planning process must seek to find a site for an airport to serve all_of Southern California . Converting El Toro does not solve any of the problems we are already struggling with at John Wayne Airport or ( San Diego ' s ) Lindbergh Field. &quot; * Source : Individual candidates .
