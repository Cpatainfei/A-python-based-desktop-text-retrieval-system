   <HEADLINE> DOCTORS ' DILEMMA ; PHYSICIANS ATTENDING EXECUTIONS ? INCREASINGLY , MANY ARE WRESTLING WITH THEIR CONSCIENCES -- AND SAYING NO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When it was over , the convicted murderer lay lifeless , an intravenous line still plugged into his vein . Ten minutes after William Andrews succumbed to the poisonous concoction injected into his arm , Dr. Robert Jones performed a task from which , he said , he would never quite recover : He entered the chamber of death , checked the condemned man ' s vital signs and confirmed that he was , in fact , dead . The medical director for the Utah State_Prison system did not witness the July , 1992 , execution . But his limited role so troubled him that he decided never again to have anything to do with a state-ordered killing . &quot; It was much more stressful , much more disconcerting than I thought it would be , &quot; Jones says . &quot; I literally slept for a whole day afterward , and I thought , ' that ' s an experience in life that you don ' t want to have to go_through again. ' . . . Physicians usually try to preserve life , not end it. &quot; As a prison doctor , Jones sits at the uncomfortable intersection of medicine and criminal justice . His dilemma highlights an ethical debate that is raging in the medical_community : Should doctors , who take the Hippocratic oath not to harm their patients , take_part in carrying_out the death_penalty ? When state laws and regulations require physicians to be present at executions -- as in California , where doctors watch the heart_monitor that charts the prisoner ' s final moments in the gas_chamber -- should the physician comply ? Long a controversial subject , this issue has attracted renewed attention since 1990 , when Illinois lawmakers voted to protect the privacy of three physicians who assisted in the lethal injection of an inmate by starting an intravenous line . Now , an unlikely alliance of physicians groups and death-penalty foes is pressing state legislators across the country to eliminate laws that call_upon doctors to participate in executions . Four groups -- the American College of Physicians , Physicians for Human_Rights , Human_Rights Watch and the National Coalition to Abolish the Death_Penalty -- made the recommendation recently in the report &quot; Breach of Trust. &quot; Their nationwide survey found that , despite an ethics ban by the American Medical Assn. , doctors play a variety of roles in executions -- including acting_as witnesses and rendering advice to executioners . Yet some prison officials , so accustomed to having doctors on_hand , say the aid of physicians is a must . Says Don Lindsey , a spokesman at the California State_Prison at San Quentin where there have been two executions in the past two years : &quot; How can you certify that it ' s all_over if the doctor is not there ? &quot; Many medical ethicists , as well as the AMA , have concluded that doctors should have no role in executions other_than to arrive afterward to certify that an inmate is dead . ( The AMA shies_away_from the word pronouncing , which implies that the physician is standing_by waiting for the inmate to die. ) But others , including Jones , the Utah physician , say that even certifying death can pose a quandary . They would prefer that the body be taken_to a morgue , where a coroner could make the certification . For instance , what if the inmate isn ' t dead when the doctor comes_in , as was the case in Alabama in 1989 , when convicted rapist and murderer Horace Franklin Dunkins was discovered still breathing_in the electric_chair ? Doctors had to tell the executioner that the job wasn ' t done . &quot; That is deeply problematic , &quot; says Gregg Bloche , a doctor and lawyer who teaches medical ethics at Georgetown University . &quot; If the doctor comes_out and says , ' No , the person is not dead , ' then the executioner administers another jolt and finishes the killing . I think that puts the doctor very close to the killing itself. &quot; Historically , doctors became involved in executions to ensure that the procedures were humane . During the_French Revolution , for instance , Dr. Joseph Guillotin promoted the neck-severing device that now bears his name because he believed that it was less painful than other methods . In the United States , many states have passed laws requiring the presence of doctors , theorizing that with dispassionate medical experts on_hand , condemned prisoners would not suffer unnecessarily . Of the 36 states that have death-penalty statutes , 28 require physicians to be present . Five more have laws saying doctors may be present . ( The issue is not as pressing in the federal prison system . Although federal law permits executions , the last one was in 1963. ) There are an estimated 1 # 500 doctors working in state_prisons nationwide , according to the National Commission on Correctional Health_Care , but this debate does not apply to them alone . Because many prison doctors refuse to become involved in executions , some states have been forced to contract with outside doctors . * But what constitutes involvement ? Clearly , administering lethal drugs or flipping the switch_on an electric_chair is involvement -- and is prohibited by the AMA . Also prohibited are starting IV lines or inspecting veins to prepare_for lethal injection ; reading a heart_monitor or tracking vital signs during an execution ; attending as a physician witness , and rendering technical advice to executioners . Doctors who engage in such activities risk sanction from state licensing boards , although experts know of no one who has been so disciplined . The &quot; Breach_of_Trust &quot; report urges state boards to take strong action against doctors who violate the ethics ban ; because of this threat , the identity of doctors present at executions is often a closely held secret . &quot; We look_at this as a bedrock ethical issue for physicians , &quot; says Dr. M . Roy Schwarz , senior_vice_president of the AMA , &quot; and we don ' t think there is any compromise on it. &quot; In practice , the issues are complex . For instance , despite the AMA policy regarding heart_monitors , Schwarz says , &quot; that ' s kind of a gray zone. &quot; The role of psychiatrists is also controversial and has not been addressed by the AMA . At issue is whether it is acceptable for forensic psychiatrists to determine if an inmate is mentally competent to be executed . And if the inmate is not competent , should the psychiatrist prescribe drugs to make him so ? * For doctors who must choose between state laws and personal ethics , the decision can be agonizing . Dr. Dan Cashman is one who knows . Cashman was the chief medical_examiner at San Quentin during the much publicized April , 1992 , execution of convicted murderer Robert Alton Harris . He refused to become involved . Instead , two unnamed prison doctors watched the heart_monitor attached_to Harris and later took his vital signs . Like many of his colleagues , Cashman believes that it would have ruined his credibility with people he treats -- the inmates -- to be present at an execution . &quot; The state has decided , in its wisdom , that it will proceed with these procedures in dealing with criminals , &quot; Cashman says , &quot; and as a medical provider , it just doesn ' t fit with my goal of having humane treatment of people. &quot; His decision , he says , was not without consequences . After the execution , he felt he had lost credibility with the warden . His proposals for improving treatment were not greeted as enthusiastically as they had been , and he wound_up leaving San Quentin to become chief medical director of the California Youth Authority . There , he does not have to grapple with such sticky matters ; juveniles cannot be sentenced to death . Cashman is not the first doctor at San Quentin to have the death_penalty collide_with his career . In the mid-1980s , Dr. Kim Marie Thorburn applied to become the prison ' s chief medical_officer . Although she was the top-ranked physician on the state ' s civil_service exam , she says she didn ' t get the job after she told the warden that she would n ' t participate in executions . * Others who do get involved , even in a limited way , often wrestle with their consciences for years . In January , 1993 , Dr. Donald T . Reay , Seattle ' s chief medical_examiner , found himself trapped in a legal debate over whether hanging constituted cruel_and_unusual_punishment . At issue was the fate of Westley Allan Dodd , who was to be hanged that month . Reay is an expert on hanging ; he has reviewed more_than 400 cases , all_of them suicides or homicides ( with the exception of Dodd ) during his 20-year career . While the courts weighed the_matter , state lawyers turned_to Reay for an explanation of what happens when someone is hanged . As a death_penalty opponent , Reay considered refusing to talk , but decided that he had an obligation to share his knowledge . Although he was careful to keep the conversation focused_on hanging_in general , refusing to answer such questions as how much rope was optimal , he was required to review military procedures for execution by hanging . &quot; It was uncomfortable , &quot; he says , &quot; because it was clear to me that what I was trying to ( say ) was going_to be used probably in some_other fashion . I did not want to get_into this position of advising them in any way how to kill someone. &quot; The courts approved the hanging , and a doctor was present . But it was not Reay ; he refused to go .</TEXT>
