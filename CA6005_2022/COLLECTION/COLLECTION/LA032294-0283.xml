   <HEADLINE> NEXT STEP ; ITALY / TURNING POINT ; DISGUSTED WITH CORRUPTION , VOTERS LOOK RIGHT AND LEFT FOR A POLITICAL REBIRTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Maria Luisa Boccia , a rookie political candidate puzzling_out campaign tactics in a smoky basement headquarters , symbolizes her expectant and perplexed country . Boccia knows where she wants to go , but isn ' t sure how to get there . Italy heads this weekend into national elections marked by scandal , uncertainty and unlikely alliances , all punctuated by tumult enough for a temperamental diva . But none of the tempest should obscure the significance of the balloting Sunday and Monday : the election marks a traumatic , ground-breaking search for political rebirth in a rich but leaderless country disgusted with its corrupt democracy . A radically re-textured political fabric has divided into forces of the left , center and right , all gathering for a high-stakes leap into an unclear future . Reformers once portrayed the election as a preface to a more open and honest &quot; Second Republic , &quot; a renewed democracy with overhauled and modernized structures of government . Now , it seems unlikely that the voting will produce either a clear-cut winner or the decisive , new-look rule that most Italians say they seek . Nonetheless , it will be pivotal . &quot; People are fed up ; the political_system has collapsed . If we can ' t restore legality and legitimacy to government , democracy itself is at risk , &quot; said Boccia , the first-time candidate who is running under the banner of a left-wing alliance . A philosophy professor , Boccia , 48 , is one of hundreds of newcomers vying for parliamentary seats in the two days of voting . They range from left-wing academics to technocrat engineers , doctors , businessmen and journalists . And they all promise a moral reawakening as the foundation for modern , post-ideological government in Italy . Chief among the debuting candidates is self-professed anti-Communist crusader Silvio Berlusconi , one of the country ' s richest_men and -- suddenly -- Italy ' s most popular politician . He portrays himself as the one figure who could short-circuit chances of a leftist victory . The collapse of international communism had made Italy ' s left less threatening , and the subsequent decimation by scandal of its domestic opponents had elevated it to the position of clear election favorite until Berlusconi jumped into the race . Five former prime_ministers , several Cabinet_ministers and numerous parliamentarians , along with some of the country ' s most prominent industrialists , have been scarred by a two-year investigation that has documented official corruption . More_than 3 # 000 in all have been touched by the probe , which has uncovered millions of dollars of theft and illegal payments to politicians of virtually every party in every part of the country . The scandal has provoked national soul-searching and personal tragedy . Well-known Italian officials and business_leaders were among almost a dozen who took their lives after being implicated in the scandal . &quot; Everyone knew , everyone is guilty , &quot; former Prime_Minister Bettino Craxi , himself under investigation , told a magistrate in Milan who inquired how deeply ran the rot . Known to Italians as Tangentopoli , or &quot; Kickback City , &quot; the expanding scandal centers_on years of payoffs for public contracts , most of them made to political_parties . The Christian Democrats , so_long esteemed by Italians , Washington and the Vatican alike as a bulwark against communism , stand foremost among the major parties painted with ignominy by judicial inquiry . Their principal allies in an unbroken skein of political power that has lasted nearly half a century also have been shamed , including Craxi ' s Socialist_Party . Now , seeking a break_with the past , Italy has fashioned a new electoral_system , scrapping proportional , vote-for-parties rules that have produced 52 weak , look-alike coalition governments since World_War_II , all_of them forged in smoke-filled rooms far from public gaze . Under the reforms , Italians will vote for individual candidates for the first time . Three-quarters of 630 deputies and 315 senators will be elected in the winner-take-all , American style . Probably for the last time , the remaining seats will be distributed proportionally , allowing continued representation by sliver parties . Also for the first time , candidates are campaigning , all ' Americana , in factories , supermarkets , schools and neighborhood coffee_bars to sell themselves and their programs . &quot; When I try to meet people outside a post_office or a hospital , there is a great curiosity about who I am and what I think , &quot; said Boccia , a member of the renamed Italian Communist_Party who is running against a centrist and a rightist in the working class San Giovanni district of Rome . National issues preoccupying Italian voters parallel those in the rest of Europe : recession , employment and job security , social_service , taxes , privatization , government debt and bureaucratic inefficiency . Italy ' s overriding down-home concern , though , is the quest_for moral authority . With institutional credibility hostage to scandal , voters tell pollsters that they are perplexed and mistrusting . &quot; The children of Tangentopoli are confused , lost . They need security and don ' t know where to find it , &quot; said the Rome newspaper La Repubblica in an analysis of a recent opinion poll . &quot; They want a candidate who is innovative , but mature ; who has experience but is honest. &quot; Enter Silvio Berlusconi . At 57 , he is a self-made industrialist , billionaire and media baron whose holdings range from advertising_agencies and magazines to the country ' s three largest private television networks , to red-and-black Milan , which is Italy ' s , and perhaps the world ' s , most famous professional soccer team . In a delicious play_on words in a country where cardinals are referred to as &quot; Sua Eminenza , &quot; ( Your Eminence , ) Italian newspapers call Berlusconi &quot; Sua Emittenza , &quot; ( Your Broadcastship. ) * Surveying the Italian political universe late last year from his entrepreneur ' s perch in Milan , Berlusconi did not like what he saw . With Christian Democrats under Mino Martinazzoli in disarray and about to split , the center was shrinking . Reformer Mario Segni , who was responsible_for the electoral reform , seemed slow and weak in forming a centrist movement called Pact for Italy ( Patto Per L ' Italia ) as focus for a new center -- the traditional home for 30 % to 40 % of Italian voters , most of them conservative Catholics . In the absence of a strong center , Berlusconi concluded , the most likely winner of the election would be the left , led by the former Communist_Party , long Italy ' s second-largest political_movement and since 1991 called the Party of the Democratic Left , PDS for its acronym in Italian . Under bland , self-effacing party leader Achille Occhetto , the former Communists have persuaded most Italians that they are just that : their pro-U.S. , pro-NATO , pro-Europe policies are social democratic , and their pro-privatization economics conservative enough to draw applause for Occhetto on a recent visit to The City , London ' s financial district . &quot; We want to hold together efficiency and solidarity , &quot; he said there , proposing lower taxes for families and businesses and more productive government investments . His party ' s platform calls_for &quot; a government of reconstruction &quot; to continue privatization and the reduction of Italy ' s huge public_debt , a campaign now directed by Prime_Minister Carlo Ciampi . Edging pointedly toward the center , Occhetto said he would even support another prime ministerial term for Ciampi , an apolitical technocrat and widely respected former central_bank president . Washington , which laid on all sail to help keep Communists out of Italian governments during the Cold_War , has given clear signals that it would view a lefist PDS-led government without alarm this time around . * Berlusconi is not sure , arguing that any government led by former Communists would be &quot; an intolerant regime &quot; poisonous for business . Even with a new name , the former Communists have &quot; a mentality and a way of acting that is still pure Stalinist , pure dictatorship , &quot; said the billionaire businessman , whom admirers sometimes compare to Ross Perot . &quot; I do not want to live_in an illiberal country governed by immature forces and men closely tied to a politically and economically bankrupt past , &quot; Berlusconi said in January , announcing that he would personally lead his new right-wing movement , which is called Forza Italia ( Go , Italy ) , a rallying cry of Italian sports fans . At the head of 267 Forza Italia candidates across the country -- all_of them , like their party leader , seeking national office for the first time -- Berlusconi is running_for a parliamentary seat from central Rome . When a ban on further publication of poll results went_into effect 10 days ago , Forza Italia , the newest national political_movement , was also its most popular . The last sounding gave the right 43 % ( 26 % for Forza Italia ) ; the left 38 % ( 20 % for the former Communists ) , and the center , dominated by the Christian Democrats , now called the Italian Peoples ' Party , the remaining 19 % . In search of a parliamentary majority of the right , Berlusconi has acquired two electoral allies : Umberto Bossi , the bumptious head of the populist-federalist Northern League ( 7 % ) and Gianfranco Fini , polished boss of Italian neo-fascists newly renamed the National Alliance ( 10 % ) . The rightist parties have agreed on common candidates in most districts . But candidates are answerable to their own parties , and the prospect of effective governmental collaboration among the three movements is dim . Bossi , who threatens secession of the rich north , will have nothing to do with Fini , whose support is strongest in the south . Bossi also rails publicly against Berlusconi for his ties to the old order and to his friend Craxi . Berlusconi has been personally untouched by Tangentopoli , but his younger brother Paolo and five managers of his Fininvest financial empire are under judicial scrutiny . For their part , the former Communists have forged an eight-party Progressive Alliance that includes Greens , an anti-Mafia party , leftist Catholics and -- embarrass ingly -- a hard-line splinter of the old Communist_Party backed by about one voter in 20 . Called Refounded Communism , it is still loudly Marxist in its rhetoric and program -- and profoundly discomfiting to would-be statesman Occhetto , who dreams of a place in government for his party after almost 50 years in opposition . Confronted with a confusing new political constellation , many voters will not make_up their minds until the last minute , but judging from the last polls Italians will see before they vote , neither left nor right will emerge with a parliamentary majority . That might give a key broker ' s role to the reduced center , itself certain to be pushed from the driver ' s seat for the first time since World_War_II . Post-electoral jockeying could produce a left-center coalition , a right-center coalition , or perhaps a government of &quot; national unity &quot; to continue economic reforms that are common goals of all three alliances . Almost nobody expects Italy to emerge with a definitive &quot; Second Republic &quot; in its first experience with new faces and rules . Rather , this bellwether election is apt to mark the beginning of what could be a long and perhaps unsettling transition toward a simpler , more transparent and ultimately more respected political_system for Italy . Many Contenders Here are the major parties in Italy ' s elections : * RIGHT * Gianfranco Fini Alleanza Nazionale ( National Alliance ) Renamed neo-fascist Italian Social Movement remains glued to the right but offers a more open face and moderated policies , hoping to mute a fascist past . * Umberto Bossi Lega Nord ( Northern League ) Young , ambitious populist-federalist movement aims to capitalize on northern Italians ' disgust with southern corruption and Rome ' s bureaucracy . * Silvio Berlusconi Forza Italia ( Go Italy ) New creation of virulently anti-leftist media czar preaches unfettered free-market capitalism in an uneasy alliance with Fini and Bossi . * CENTER * Mino Martinazzoli Partito Popolare Italiano ( Italian Peoples ' Party ) Newly named , avowedly reformed bulk of Christian Democrats , the party that dominated postwar governments but has lost its grip due_to scandal . * Mario Segni Patto Per L ' Italia ( Pact for Italy ) New party founded by renegade Christian Democrats behind a personally bland reformer responsible_for electoral reform . * LEFT * Achille Occhetto Partito Democratico della Sinistra ( Democratic Party of the Left ) Renamed Italian Communist_party is the largest survivor among old-line parties . As senior partner of an eight-party Progressive Alliance , it is officially social democratic and frightens few beside Berlusconi . * Fausto Bertinotti Rifondazione Communista ( Communist Refoundation ) Small Marxist group that broke from the mainline Communist_Party when it changed its name . * Various leaders Alleanza Democratica ( Democratic Alliance ) A collection of small center-left parties and a_few renegades from scarred major parties . * Ottaviano del Turco Partito Socialista Italiana ( Italian Socialist_Party ) Shreds of the once-burgeoning star of center-left and a major government player under former Prime_Minister Bettino Craxi , now among political_leaders named in corruption inquiries . * Leoluca Orlando La Rete ( The Network ) Anti-Mafia party led by mayor of Palermo is now also growing among voters in the Italian north . * Carlo Ripa di Meana Verdi ( Greens ) Movement led by former European environment commissioner has recently won mayoralty of Rome .
