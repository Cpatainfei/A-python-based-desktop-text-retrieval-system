   <HEADLINE> DINOSAURS AT_SEA ; AIRCRAFT_CARRIERS HAVE RULED THE OCEANS SINCE 1945 . BUT NOW THE FLOATING GIANTS ARE THREATENED BY SHRINKING BUDGETS AND MILITARY OBSOLESCENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 45-knot wind whips along the sprawling flight_deck of the Dwight D . Eisenhower , one of the Navy ' s state-of-the-art supercarriers . As the ship launches and recovers airplanes -- short , squat cargo haulers and sleek fighters -- a rescue helicopter chatters in place a_few hundred yards away , just in case . It ' s hard to imagine a noisier place on planet Earth . Or a place with more stomach-knotting tension . Near the bow of the ship , a pair of steam-driven catapults punches planes into the sky . At the other end , homeward-bound planes glide in , wings wobbling with last-second alignments and -- if all goes well -- use the sturdy hooks suspended from their tails to snag one of four fat arresting cables that extend across the deck . With a slam and a roar , they ' re jerked to a head-snapping stop within 350 feet . This action is the stuff of World_War II-era &quot; Victory at_Sea &quot; flag wavers , and it ' s been a carrier ' s stock in trade for more_than 50 years . Between launchings and recoveries , as the catapults recycle and the arresting cable is retracted , sailors in distinctively colored shirts scurry to get ready for the next round . Yellow shirts are essentially traffic_cops , directing planes toward catapults or to out-of-the way spots on the gently pitching deck where they ' ll be chained in place by blue shirts . The red shirts load and unload bombs and the air-to-air_missiles that , once fired , home_in on a target ' s glowing-hot tail pipe . The purple shirts -- the &quot; grapes &quot; -- top_off the tanks with aviation fuel . Green shirts run the catapults and the arresting gear . Fresh from a pit stop in a Virginia repair yard , the Eisenhower and its crew are cutting wide circles in the Atlantic , about 100 miles east of Norfolk , getting ready for another six-months-long deployment to the Mediterranean that begins this fall . Since the Navy picked_up the keys and drove it away in 1977 , the Eisenhower has also operated in the North_Sea , the Indian_Ocean and the Caribbean . The ship steamed into the Red_Sea not long after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 . On its expeditions to foreign waters , the Eisenhower ' s &quot; battle_group &quot; usually includes nine or so guided-missile cruisers and destroyers and a_couple_of submarines . Carrier battle_groups have been dispatched by American Presidents to show the flag in this or that trouble spot since the end of World_War_II . Between 1946 and 1990 , according to a tally by the Congressional Research Service , carriers were involved in 140 &quot; international incidents. &quot; Planes from two carriers flew in the 1986 raids on Libya . Half a dozen were involved at various times during the Persian_Gulf_War . More recently , carrier-based aircraft have helped enforce a &quot; no fly &quot; zone over southern Iraq . And this spring , jets from the Saratoga -- a 39-year-old carrier that ' s due_to be retired late this summer after its Adriatic cruise -- patrolled over the rubble of the former Yugoslavia . Back in Washington , as Congress thrashes_out the federal budget , attempting to make tight dollars stretch further , a growing armada of critics maintains that these carriers are money-guzzling dinosaurs , vestigial remains of an era when the Navy had to be ever-ready to duke it out with the Soviet fleet . But that ' s light_years away from the scene in the Eisenhower ' s bridge , a penthouse-control room packed with polished brass and glowing digits and dials . Here , junior officers are practicing the routines of steering the ship -- not only getting from point A to point B but also , in the process , avoiding a collision with another ship or a hull-gouging sandbar that would bring a swift end to their ( and their commanding_officer ' s ) career . And so , as Capt . Alan Mark Gemmill , the Eisenhower ' s skipper since March , 1993 , looks_on , young officers work with quiet intensity to sort_out the course and speculate about the intentions of a fishing_boat whose lights have been spotted a mile or two ahead . Command of a high-profile ship like the Eisenhower is a primo assignment for Gemmill ; if he doesn ' t screw_up , he ' s a good bet to make admiral in a year or two . Unlike many other officers who are edging their way to the top of the heap , Gemmill isn ' t a blustering , damn-the-torpedoes kind of guy . He doesn ' t sport one of those five-pound Annapolis rings or a barely disguised contempt for civilians who haven ' t been off to war once or twice . A soft-spoken native of Arizona , where he grew_up on a cattle_ranch , Gemmill isn ' t a graduate of the Naval Academy ( University of Arizona , class of 1968 ) . He didn ' t have his ticket punched_in Vietnam ( by the time he finished flight training , the war was all but over ) . And he hasn ' t risen from dry-land staff jobs in Washington , polishing social skills and schmoozing with members of Congress and lobbyists . Instead , he has dutifully toiled as a test_pilot and run squadrons and , before taking command of the Eisenhower , pulled a wide range of duties on other ships . But to the Navy , whose image is decidedly frayed around the edges these days -- thanks in large measure to lingering questions about its treatment of women -- Gemmill is tailor-made for the Eisenhower : accessible , media-savvy and willing to help shape a positive , &quot; coping-in-the-modern-world &quot; image of the carrier and its crew . Since Congress last year lifted its restrictions on women serving on ships that might fall_into harm ' s way and picked the Eisenhower to be the first warship to which women would be assigned , reporters and photographers have been shuttling out_to capture the sights and sounds of women pilots brushing_up their carrier landing skills and to otherwise poke through the ship for signs of resentment -- or acceptance -- among the crew . Most of the reports include a sound_bite or two from the C.O. Though not the glibbest of people , Gemmill , whose last command was a supply_ship with a &quot; mixed crew &quot; ( women have been assigned to noncombat vessels for years ) -- has been holding his own . &quot; We ' re all grown-ups here , &quot; he says , in tones so soft you sometimes have to strain to hear . &quot; we ' ll do what we have to do. &quot; It ' s the new and adaptive voice of a carrier force that will have to evolve to survive . THE EISENHOWER IS ONE OF THE NAVY ' S NIMITZ-CLASS CARRIERS . SIX ARE already in the fleet , and two other brand-new models will report for duty in a year or two . They ' ve all been modeled on the design for the Nimitz ( named for Adm . Chester W . Nimitz , who helped revive the Pacific Fleet after Pearl_Harbor and then directed its battering of Japan ) that was completed in 1975 . Another Nimitz-class carrier -- perhaps the last of the line -- is at the top of the service ' s shopping list this year . Designated CVN-76 ( it doesn ' t have a more formal name yet ) , it carries a sticker price of nearly $ 4.5 billion and is included in the Clinton_Administration ' s Pentagon budget_for fiscal 1995 . The Navy -- and the country ' s ailing shipyards -- have a big stake in CVN-76 . And it ' s by no means certain that Congress will vote their way . Not many years ago , this wasn ' t how the world worked . Capitol_Hill was four-square behind supercarriers . The bigger the better , it seemed . Why ? Aside from high-sounding patriotic or geopolitical justifications , it was the prospect of several years of steady work for thousands of constituents everywhere . A carrier construction project , which from start to finish takes at least five years , is prime pork wrapped in the stars and stripes . Apart from the tons of metal and vast arrays of electronic_equipment that make_up a supercarrier , each ship comes equipped with 2 # 000 telephones and 30 # 000 light fixtures ; somebody has to make and crate and ship all those ingredients . In the process , money makes_it way to subcontractors in as_many as 35 states . President Carter , an old Navy_man with a radical idea or two , learned that fact of political life the hard way after he asked Congress to approve a smaller , less expensive carrier that would run_on old-fashioned fuel_oil instead of nuclear_power . Capitol_Hill was the target of a 21-gun lobbying campaign . The Navy and the conglomerates that own most of the shipyards maintained that a smaller carrier would n ' t be as cost effective : It would n ' t stand_up to as much battle_damage , would be too slow , and its necessarily reduced load of airplanes would have to shrink further to make room for fuel tanks . In the end , Congress insisted on another Nimitz-class whopper , the Theodore Roosevelt . In the early 1980s , during the you-want-it , you-get-it days of the Ronald Reagan arms buildup , the White_House asked Capitol_Hill for money to spend on replacements for two World_War II-era relics that were nearing retirement age . Congress dutifully rubber-stamped nearly $ 7 billion for the supercarriers Abraham_Lincoln and George_Washington . Later in the decade came a green_light for the John C . Stennis and the United States . Those two are still being assembled at Newport News Shipbuilding near Norfolk . The blueprints for CVN-76 first slid off the drawing boards when George_Bush was commander_in_chief . Last year , after former Defense_Secretary Les Aspin ' s &quot; bottom-up &quot; review -- an attempt to sort_out how extensive an arsenal the United States needs now that it ' s the only superpower left standing -- the Clinton_Administration decided to stay the course with CVN-76 and to maintain 11 active carriers and another in reserve . Not a drastic departure from the 15 carriers that the Navy operated during the twilight years of the Cold_War . But a dozen was the number said to be needed ( once allowances are made_for repair time and crew vacations ) to keep an American carrier near potential flash_points in , say , the Persian_Gulf , the Western Pacific and the Adriatic . More broadly , the carriers would be a part of a slimmed-down military that would still be capable of fighting the equivalent of two Persian_Gulf_Wars at_the_same_time . In many ways , the post-Cold War world is an even riskier place , CVN-76 advocates contend . There are the unfriendly rumbles from North_Korea , armed to the teeth with 55 army divisions and 5 # 000 tanks . And what about the implications of a coup by the_likes_of Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovksy ? &quot; If Congress chooses to cut the carrier , the Navy isn ' t gonna die . But it sure as hell will affect our ability to respond to crises , &quot; says Vice Adm . Leighton W . Smith Jr. , until recently a deputy chief of naval operations . He has presided over much of his service ' s planning for life in the post-Cold War world , a period when &quot; nobody ' s going_to come_after us . We do believe , however , that there will be regional crises that have the potential to impact those things that are important to our economy . I can ' t believe we ' ll always have access to those regions from land bases. &quot; A new carrier isn ' t that much of an extravagance , the Navy ' s top brass maintain , because they ' ve already cut_back so_much else . Since the mid-1980s , the fleet has shrunk_from 546 ships to about 400 ; by the end of the decade , it may number no more_than 330 or so . &quot; This year , the Navy will be decommissioning more ships than most other nations have in their entire navies , &quot; says Smith , who is now NATO ' s commander for southern Europe . But there are plenty of critics on and off Capitol_Hill who say that , as a general point , nearly four years after the Berlin Wall came tumbling down and two years after the former Soviet_Union imploded , America ' s armed_services , and the Navy in particular , are still allotted too fat a share of the steadily shrinking pot of available federal dollars . &quot; The Navy is a force in search of a mission , struggling to hold onto the budgetary and institutional gains made during the 1980s , &quot; defense_policy analyst Christopher A . Preble wrote recently in a report for the Cato Institute , a Washington think_tank . &quot; The Navy should de-emphasize the role of aircraft_carriers , which are relics of a Cold_War strategy. &quot; Several critics -- by no means limited to liberals -- go_on to note the many places where carriers haven ' t been in recent years . Like the 1990 evacuations from Somalia and Liberia that the Navy orchestrated . And the 1989 raid on Panama . These critics would scrap the CVN-76 , retire a handful of other carriers and keep the ones that are left close to home until they ' re needed on some faraway front . America would no longer be the cop on the beat . &quot; Japan and Australia should be expected to assume a larger burden in the Western Pacific , &quot; Preble said . &quot; And Great Britain , France and Germany should be expected to do the same &quot; in their spheres_of_influence . America ' s carriers , proposed and already built , are tempting targets . This year , for the first time since 1990 , defense spending accounts can be raided by members of Congress scrambling to find money for , say , some underfinanced domestic program ; heretofore , &quot; fire walls &quot; kept budget raiders at_bay . A few weeks ago , Robert D . Reischauer , director of the more or less objective , nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , told the House Armed Services Committee that forcing the Navy to get_by with 10 carriers ( and reducing the Army by three divisions ) would produce nearly $ 23 billion in savings over five years . The CBO calculations included money that would n ' t be spent on , say , the 80-odd airplanes that are usually packed by a supercarrier and on the accompanying &quot; battle group. &quot; The carrier fleet could also end_up in the sights of lawmakers who have no qualms about the size of the proposed Pentagon budget -- or in fact assert that it should be larger -- but maintain that much less should be spent on such big-ticket items as the CVN-76 and much more on training troops and keeping their tanks and warplanes up and running . Privately , many in Navy_blue ( and Marine Corps green ) complain that carriers eat_up money that could be more wisely invested in fast troop and cargo_ships or on big new cargo planes . Their concerns were summed_up forcefully in early March , in congressional testimony by Marine Gen . Joseph P . Hoar , who runs the Central Command . Generals and admirals almost never admit out loud that they have enough of anything , but Hoar , whose command extends from eastern Africa to the Persian_Gulf and Iran , has a reputation for blistering forthrightness and thus greater credibility . The Senate Armed Services Committee sat_up and listened when he declared that the American military doesn ' t have enough troop and cargo planes for one good-sized war abroad , much less two . Not so privately , there are growing fears that before long , America ' s military will , as it did after the post-Vietnam cutbacks ( and the sharp reductions that followed World_War_II and the Korean_War ) look good on paper but be unfit to fight . &quot; Readiness -- the ability of forces to fight on short notice -- is an apple-pie issue on Capitol_Hill , &quot; says Andrew F . Krepinevich , an analyst with the private Defense Budget Project . &quot; There ' s a strong aversion on the part of the White_House and senior civilian leadership to expose themselves to charges that the military isn ' t ready to fight. &quot; But he raises questions about whether the United States can afford all that readiness . &quot; We can ' t buy that big a force and keep it ready with the money that ' s available . Something ' s got_to give. &quot; A DECADE AGO , THE DISCUSSION WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER . CVN-76 WOULD be a done deal , because Congress has already approved $ 832 million for its nuclear_power plant . Once upon a time , notwithstanding the grumbles about how several billions could be_better spent , that down_payment would have all but guaranteed that the ship would be built . that ' s not the case now , given Congress ' vote last year to kill the superconducting super collider , in which the federal_government had already invested about $ 2 billion . Clearly , down_payments don ' t mean what they used to . If the CVN-76 project is dropped before it ' s completed -- and under the Navy ' s best-case scenario , which doesn ' t allow_for any shortages of skilled shipyard workers or any labor disputes that could delay construction , it would n ' t join the fleet until 2003 -- the CVN-76 could be cannibalized , its parts used as spares for other carriers . Capitol_Hill takes its time , so the squabble over CVN-76 is likely to extend through much of this year . Even if Congress waves the new carrier through this year , the debate could be revived in the future . One of the first shots was fired in the House Armed Services Committee by the chairman , Ronald V . Dellums , a Democrat from Oakland , whose views count for a lot . Last year , his first as chairman , wasn ' t an easy one for him . The base-closing commission targeted several Navy facilities in his district , one of them a carrier home port , the Alameda Naval Air_Station . He did , however , block an effort by House hawks to speed_up consideration of CVN-76 . This year , the new carrier is clearly on his mind . During a recent session with Navy_Secretary John H . Dalton , Dellums declared : &quot; There is serious doubt whether the muscular battle_group bought for the Cold_War -- centered around nuclear aircraft_carriers -- is necessary or even appropriate. &quot; Dellums ' comments are still reverberating around the nation ' s mostly empty dry-docks ; without CVN-76 , the financial_conditions of many of the nation ' s failing shipyards will drastically worsen . Some may die . Until the 1960s , it was standing-room-only in the yards . Metal was being bent around the clock_in shipyards on both sea coasts , along the Gulf_of_Mexico and all around the Great Lakes . America ' s shipbuilders ruled the waves . The domestic industry ' s decline began after Japan Inc. opened for business . During the Nixon Administration , Washington began propping_up U.S. shipbuilders with financial grants . That helped . So did the oil shocks of the 1970s , when barrels of crude worth their weight in gold sparked a demand for big new tankers . But what one Republican gave , another took_away . The Reagan_Administration killed the grants , and the industry ' s plunge accelerated . The survivors have staggered along on military contracts ; the Navy ' s 1985 budget included money for 29 new ships . Now , that business is drying_up ; this year ' s budget would underwrite , at most , six new vessels . The federal subsidies are gone , but Washington has been helping keep some of the survivors in business by spreading around what are essentially make-work projects . The United States has two yards left with the specialized know-how and equipment to assemble nuclear-powered warships -- Newport News Shipbuilding , a unit of Tenneco Inc. , and the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corp. , in Connecticut . Newport News can build carriers and submarines ; Electric Boat is a subs-only yard . After intense lobbying by General Dynamics , the Clinton_Administration ' s &quot; bottom-up &quot; reviewers decided to keep two &quot; nuclear-construction-capable &quot; shipyards in business . Accordingly , the White_House ' s 1995 budget includes money for a $ 2-billion nuclear submarine that , most specialists say , the Navy doesn ' t need . But it will help keep the lights burning at Electric Boat . Similarly , CVN-76 is considered a capability saver . Says a congressional aide who is a national security specialist : &quot; During the Cold_War , these carriers were justified for military reasons . In the case of CVN-76 , it ' s said to be more a matter of ' industrial policy. ' We have to build it , and right away , or we ' ll lose the capacity to build supercarriers . If we delay it even for a year , laid-off shipyard workers with hard-to-replace skills might be lost for good. &quot; Still , barring a flood of orders for commercial projects , a green_light for CVN-76 could merely postpone an inevitable collapse , according to shipbuilding_industry spokesmen , who reflexively see bad omens everywhere . &quot; Currently , we have about 100 # 000 people in the industry , &quot; says John J . Stocker , president of the Shipbuilders Council of America , a trade association that ' s based in Washington ' s Virginia suburbs . &quot; By 1998 , we ' ll be down to 28 # 000 even if the new carrier is approved . If we lose the carrier , the industry will be wiped_off the map. &quot; That might be a stretch , but Newport News Shipbuilding , Virginia ' s largest employer , would be the biggest corporate loser if plans for the new carrier are scuttled . In 1987 , at the peak of the Reagan_Administration ' s arms binge , the yard had 31 # 000 workers ; now its payroll is nearer 22 # 000 . Without CVN-76 ? Maybe no more_than 5 # 000 after the yard wraps_up other Navy projects it ' s working_on . And it would n ' t be good news for San Diego ' s National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co . The shipyard ' s business was once roughly 50 % Navy , 50 % civilian . It is famous as the place where the Exxon Valdez oil_tanker was built and later repaired . The yard ' s work is now &quot; virtually 100 % military , &quot; says Fred N . Hallett , NASSCO ' s chief financial_officer . NASSCO , which has a payroll of nearly 3 # 500 , is the last yard on the West Coast that builds ships for the Navy ( Long_Beach just repairs them ) . After stumbling through the 1980s , NASSCO landed contracts for four high-speed supply_ships whose gas-turbine engines and exotic transmission gears would make them fast enough to keep_up with supercarriers ( which can bat along at nearly 40 miles an hour ) . Plagued by an array of problems -- some caused by ever-changing Navy specifications , some by shipyard mismanagement -- the first ship was delivered to the Navy in February , three years late and way over budget . The yard says it ' s losing money on the supply_ships . If CVN-76 is shelved , or if the Navy is forced to reduce its carrier fleet further , the yard ' s future could be in jeopardy . AROUND THE NAVY , SOME carrier boosters say it ' s easy to pinpoint when the CVN-76 and the rest of the carrier fleet , along with the Navy in_general , began to lose their luster . Not when Commander_in_Chief Reagan gave_up the Oval Office . Not when Bill_Clinton ( who , during the 1992 presidential campaign , maintained that 10 carriers would be plenty ) took_charge . No , the troubles started with the Persian_Gulf_War . In the view of many analysts , the war provided proof positive that the carriers -- which might have performed admirably in an open-ocean , no-holds-barred war with the Soviet_Union -- aren ' t very well suited for &quot; regional &quot; conflicts . Those analysts claim that supercarriers just aren ' t that super in an era when any Third_World nation with a_few bucks can get a good_deal on ship-crippling cruise missiles or simple but deadly waterborne mines . An especially pointed post-mortem -- the handiwork of Navy Capt . Charles R . Girvin , a 30-year veteran who had a front-row seat during the war -- appeared in a mid-1993 issue of the authoritative Proceedings of the U.S. Naval Institute . &quot; Despite the use of six aircraft_carriers -- with crews totaling more_than 30 # 000 men -- accompanied by extensive cruiser , destroyer and frigate escorts , postwar analysis . . . confirmed that the carrier aviation contribution to the air campaign was minor compared to the land-based air_forces , &quot; he wrote . &quot; The carriers simply were not needed. &quot; All in all , Girvin asserted , the war showcased the effectiveness of relatively inexpensive mines , which forced much of the American Navy to keep its distance , and the &quot; huge success &quot; of Tomahawk cruise missiles . In Washington , Navy officials shrug_off Girvin and other critics as &quot; shortsighted. &quot; They insist that the Navy and its carriers did just fine ; the problem is that the service lost the public relations war . &quot; The Air_Force got the glory , &quot; a senior Navy spin master grumps . &quot; They had better gun-sight cameras ( that provided those extra sharp , video-game-quality shots of targets being destroyed by ' smart ' bombs ) , they provided better access to the news media . The Navy did an awful job . From one half to a third of our ships over there banned reporters ; the ships ' captains didn ' t want to bother. &quot; Now , he continues , ships ' captains everywhere have been ordered to bother . This year , the Navy went_out of its way to accommodate reporters who wanted to ride the carrier Saratoga around the Adriatic ; television crews found smiling sailors ready and willing to transmit their footage back to their home_offices . Same with the Eisenhower and its history-making rendezvous with women in uniform . As a part of what could be called Operation Bounce_Back , the Navy is also experimenting with innovative ways of using its carriers , to show that even dinosaurs can learn new tricks . They don ' t always succeed . Last year , the Navy dabbled_with making the carrier Ranger a troop transport . More_than 500 Marines -- complete with ground-fighting gear and helicopters -- were loaded_up for a cruise to the Mediterranean . When the Marines strapped on their backpacks and other equipment , they could barely maneuver through the carrier ' s narrow passageways and steep ladders . &quot; We might not do that again , &quot; a senior Navy commander says dryly . During its coming deployment , the Eisenhower may be involved in watch-us-adapt experiments . At various times , the ship may take_on Army special forces troops or Air_Force units . Or the carrier and its accompanying cruisers and destroyers , some of them equipped with the most sophisticated radars anywhere , might engage in a little make-believe SCUD busting . Operating 20 miles or so offshore , they ' d go_through the motions of detecting hypothetical enemy missiles fired at a hypothetical Marine landing . Because the ships don ' t carry anti-missile missiles , they would practice relaying radar data to hypothetical batteries of Army Patriot missiles . that ' s all according to Gemmill ' s immediate boss , Rear Adm . Harold W . Gehman Jr. , who commands the Eisenhower ' s battle_group . Gehman is an intense , wiry man who commanded patrol_boats during the Vietnam_War and has held high-level staff jobs in Washington . A high-tech command center is being installed next to his office , where coffee_cups rattle whenever a snagged plane crashes to a stop on the flight_deck , to help ships more quickly pass along what they ' ve learned about an enemy ' s missile firings . Gehman isn ' t an aviator ; his tours at_sea have mostly been_on cruisers and destroyers . But he talks the talk . &quot; Carriers were bought_at the height of the Cold_War for open-ocean conflicts . Now the world has changed . We have to adapt to new international arrangements and to new threats. &quot; He adds , of course , that &quot; we have to have carriers to meet those threats. &quot; But in the increasingly hostile climate facing the carrier fleet , that conclusion , like his exercises , may only be hypothetical .</TEXT>
