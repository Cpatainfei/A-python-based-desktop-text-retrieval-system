   <HEADLINE> REP . TUCKER TO BE INDICTED , SOURCES SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rep . Walter R . Tucker III , a charismatic and controversial congressman who was the youngest_person ever elected mayor of Compton , is expected to be indicted today on 10 counts of violating federal bribery and income_tax laws , sources close to the case said Wednesday . According to those sources , the counts against Tucker include eight violations of the Hobbs Act , the 1951 federal law that makes_it a crime for public officials to solicit or accept bribes . Tucker , the sources added , also is expected to face two counts of violating federal income_tax laws . All income -- whether legally or illegally earned -- is subject_to federal taxes . Failure to report income derived from bribes is a federal offense . Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , the Los Angeles attorney whose clients include entertainer Michael Jackson and O.J. Simpson , is representing Tucker . Tucker has consistently declined to discuss the case , referring all calls to Cochran . Cochran was unavailable for comment Wednesday . If returned as expected , the multi-count indictment would conclude at least one phase of a sweeping federal investigation into Compton city affairs . Tucker and former Councilwoman Patricia Moore were among the targets of the undercover FBI inquiry , which has been under way for more_than two years and has been operated out of the FBI ' s Long_Beach office . According to sources , an FBI_agent posed as a businessman and offered officials bribes to have items placed on Compton City_Council agendas , among other things . The agent met with officials to offer those bribes , and at least some of the meetings were secretly videotaped , sources said . U.S. Atty . Nora Manella said she could not discuss the case or the possibility of indictments . She confirmed that she expects to hold a 2 p.m. news_conference today , but would not disclose its topic . &quot; We can ' t confirm or deny any reports of anticipated indictments , &quot; she said . News of the investigation surfaced in March , when The Times and the Wall_Street Journal published details of the probe . Moore , who has publicly feuded with Tucker in the past , is not expected to be indicted today , and sources would not say whether she is cooperating with authorities . Sources added that the investigation is ongoing , and said other officials still could be targeted . Moore could not be reached for comment . &quot; In such an investigation , it is pretty common that things continue to unfold and leads continue to unfold , &quot; one federal law_enforcement source said . &quot; It ' s not like a bank robbery where you catch the guy and it is over . Nor is it even like a savings and loan failure where it is pretty clear that there is a certain number of people involved. &quot; The undercover phase of the federal investigation was followed by an extensive search of Compton city records . In April , virtually every major city department -- the city_manager , city attorney , treasurer and grants manager , as well as the Community Redevelopment_Authority and the personnel , police , public works and planning departments -- was served with subpoenas for records . Federal prosecutors also served subpoenas seeking campaign disclosure statements for Tucker and Moore , and possibly other politicians , from 1985 to the present , sources said in April . The federal investigation of Tucker is not the first time that the Baptist minister has found himself embroiled in controversy . In 1988 , Tucker , then a deputy district_attorney , was fired from his post with the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office . He later pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges in a case where he was accused of altering an official_document and lying to a judge about it . Tucker rebounded from that setback and launched his political career . In April , 1991 , he followed in his father ' s footsteps as mayor of Compton . He held that post for less than two years . In November , 1992 , he was elected to Congress from the 37th District , beating out the daughter and heir-apparent of Rep . Melvin Dymally in a campaign considered one of the most heated ever in Compton . Tucker ' s career and Compton ' s fierce political environment have left the congressman with loyal allies and determined critics . As news spread late Wednesday of the pending indictment , officials were reluctant to comment at length , saying they preferred to wait for official news about the case . Councilwoman Jane D . Robbins , an 18-year veteran of Compton ' s ruling body , returned from vacation Wednesday and said she had not been officially told of any action against her former council colleague . &quot; I think he was trying to do a good job ( as mayor ) , &quot; Robbins said . &quot; But he was young and inexperienced and trying to follow in his father ' s footsteps and that doesn ' t always happen. &quot; Robbins added that just before going_on vacation 10 days ago , federal authorities asked her to testify before the grand_jury considering the case . She said she did not because of her plans to leave town . Mayor Omar Bradley , who succeeded Tucker in that post , could not be reached Wednesday evening . Associates said he was busy meeting with other city officials to chart Compton ' s response to its latest public relations flare-up -- the videotaped beating of a teen-age , suspect by a Compton police_officer . * Times correspondent Emily Adams contributed to this story .</TEXT>
