   <TEXT> Declaring that &quot; U.S. help is vital , &quot; the leader of the political wing of the_Irish Republican Army called_on the Clinton_Administration on Tuesday to help break the deadlock in negotiating a settlement of the conflict in Northern_Ireland . &quot; There is an urgent need to break the current deadlock and to move the situation forward towards a negotiated settlement and a lasting peace , &quot; Gerry Adams told a conference in Manhattan examining the chances for peace in strife-torn Ulster . &quot; The U.S._government can assist at a wider level by actively seeking to encourage dialogue and agreement. &quot; Adams , head of the Sinn Fein party , proposed that the Administration turn its attention to Northern_Ireland , just as it worked to facilitate peace in the Middle_East . He accused British Prime_Minister John Major ' s government of &quot; bad faith and double-dealing &quot; by declining to clarify its position , put forth in a joint Irish-British peace plan announced in December . In Washington , President Clinton , who approved giving Adams a 48-hour visa to attend the conference in the hopes of hastening the peace process , declined immediately to be drawn into the complex dispute . &quot; The people who have to resolve this are the_Irish and the_British , &quot; the President said . &quot; I think he ( Adams ) should also support the work being done_by the prime_ministers of both Ireland and Britain in pursuing the peace. &quot; British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd , also in Washington , attacked Adams as a &quot; master of ambiguity &quot; who has never renounced violence in Northern_Ireland . &quot; He has the influence to end the violence by the IRA , &quot; Hurd told a news_conference . The decision by the Administration to grant Adams a visa after he was turned_down eight times clearly upset senior British officials , although they reacted mildly in public . &quot; The principles involved are pretty clear , &quot; Hurd said . &quot; It is a contrast between terrorism and democracy . And I think I know which side of that argument the United States is basically on. &quot; Adams , a 45-year-old former member of the_British Parliament , is barred from speaking on radio and television in Britain because of his role with the IRA . His day in New York was one of maximum American media exposure , though minimal , if any , progress on the peace front . He appeared widely on television , stressing that the ball &quot; is very firmly in the_British court. &quot; Adams , whose father was an IRA member who was shot by police in 1939 and imprisoned twice for his activities , emphasized that he wanted Ireland and Britain to agree on the principle of self-determination for all_of Ireland in a time frame to be negotiated . He said that December ' s framework for peace announced by Britain and Ireland was only an initial step . He wanted further clarifications , adding , &quot; the issue of self-determination is central to the resolution of the conflict. &quot; The plan offers Sinn Fein equal treatment with other political_parties in Northern_Ireland , provided it renounces violence and the IRA lays_down its weapons -- a point Hurd once again stressed on Tuesday . &quot; This can ' t be fudged , &quot; the foreign secretary said . &quot; If there is going_to be peace , and if Sinn Fein is going_to take its part among the constitutional parties discussing the future of Northern_Ireland , there has to be a permanent end to the shooting and the bombing . They have to accept the ballot rather than the bullet. &quot; Pressed repeatedly by reporters , Adams said he would not urge the IRA at this time to lay_down its arms . &quot; I lean_on no one , &quot; he said . But at_the_same_time , he said Sinn Fein was committed to a peace settlement and was &quot; anxious &quot; to be persuaded that the Downing Street Declaration signed by Major and Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds could provide the basis for peace . Adams added that , even if this were not the case , &quot; we should all move to bridge the gap. &quot; The National Committee on Foreign Policy , a private group , had hoped major participants in the Northern_Ireland struggle would attend its New York forum and that progress might result . Some 40 members of Congress , spearheaded by Sens . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) and Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) , had urged the Administration to grant Adams a visa . But the conference was not inclusive : Two prominent politicians -- the Rev . Ian Paisley , the extremist Protestant leader , and Ulster Unionist Party head James Molyneaux -- declined , declaring they would not associate with &quot; apologists for terrorism. &quot;</TEXT>
