   <HEADLINE> TINY ST . MATTHEW RATTLES THE ROMAN_CATHOLIC DIOCESE ; RELIGION : AMERICAN CATHOLIC_CHURCH IN ORANGE TARGETS THE DISENFRANCHISED , SPURRING COMPLAINTS OF DECEPTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The local newspaper_advertisements aim at divorced Roman_Catholics who , because they were once married , are barred from remarrying in their church . &quot; Want a Catholic Wedding but Cannot Be Married in Your Roman_Catholic Parish ? Call the Priests of St . Matthew Church . An American Catholic Community. &quot; Such marketing has lured a booming wedding business to St . Matthew , a tiny church in Orange , where priests say they officiate at about 300 marriages a year . But St . Matthew ' s advertising , which targets &quot; unhappy or disenfranchised Roman_Catholics , &quot; its founding pastor says , has spurred an ongoing feud with the Roman_Catholic Diocese of Orange . Msgr . Lawrence J . Baird , the diocesan spokesman , contends that the priests at St . Matthew are trying to deceive Roman_Catholics that theirs is a Roman_Catholic_church when it is not . St . Matthew ' s designation as a Catholic_Church , albeit American rather than Roman_Catholic , in itself is confusing , he said . &quot; It is clear that St . Matthew is being disingenuous in_regard_to appealing_to Roman_Catholics , &quot; Baird said . &quot; The issue is deceptive advertising. &quot; Because of complaints from some Roman_Catholics who were misled , Baird said , the official diocesan newsletter last year ran a warning that marriage attempted before priests or deacons of St . Matthew would be invalid in the eyes of the Roman_Catholic_Church . Baird said that , at the urging of the diocese , most Roman_Catholic parishes in Orange County over the past 12 months have placed similar alerts in the bulletins they distribute at Sunday Mass . The diocese has angered Father Peter E . Hickman , founder of St . Matthew , who said the accusations falsely impugn the reputation of his church . &quot; This has been a campaign to discredit St . Matthew , &quot; he complained . It worries him , he said , because &quot; the Roman_Catholic_Church is a moral_force that carries a big punch. &quot; Hickman said he was insulted by a letter that a Roman_Catholic priest in Riverside sent_in September to the parents of a prospective bride , in which the priest refused to forward her baptismal certificate to St . Matthew in preparation for the marriage . In the letter , the priest alleged those running St . Matthew were &quot; posing &quot; as Roman_Catholic priests . Hickman , whose 400-member congregation meets in a converted office_building close to the Orange Freeway , said he is eager for the church to grow . He attributed his missionary zeal in part to his training as a Southern Baptist minister before his conversion to Catholicism . He is recruiting Roman_Catholics who , because of divorce and remarriage or the practice of artificial birth_control , are no longer welcome to receive the sacraments in the church of their youth , he said . His congregation , Hickman said , consists largely of baby_boomers between 30 and 50 for whom St . Matthew ' s Mass and sacraments offer comfortable familiarity . Diane Troianello , 44 , of north Tustin , said she had been brought_up Catholic but after finishing parochial_school and leaving home only went_to church when her mother would visit her . She sought Hickman six years ago when she wanted to marry a divorced man . &quot; It was really for my mother so she would n ' t be disappointed , &quot; Troianello said . The couple also decided it would be &quot; beyond hypocrisy &quot; to apply to the Roman_Catholic_church to have his former marriage annulled , she said . But the Troianellos said &quot; Father Peter , &quot; as his parishioners call him , never claimed that St . Matthew was Roman_Catholic . Hickman said he tells newcomers that St . Matthew is part of the &quot; Old_Catholic Movement , &quot; which broke_off from Roman_Catholicism more_than a century ago . A brochure describing St . Matthew says that , unlike a Roman_Catholic_church , it does not accept the teaching of Papal infallibility . Among other differences , its priests may marry , divorced parishioners may remarry without having their former marriages annulled , and the use of artificial contraception is not prohibited . But Old Catholicism ' s similarity to Roman_Catholicism also makes_it attractive to fallen-away Roman_Catholics , Hickman said . Most importantly , he said , the ordination of Old_Catholic priests , like the ordination of Roman_Catholic priests , can be traced in unbroken succession to the Apostles . Moreover , he said , some Old_Catholic priests , including two at St . Matthew , were ordained in the Roman_Catholic_Church but left to marry . Father Gregory Coiro , director of public affairs for the Roman_Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles , acknowledged that because the &quot; apostolic succession &quot; has been preserved in some Old_Catholic_Churches , the Roman_Catholic religion would consider their sacraments , such_as holy_communion and penance , to be &quot; valid &quot; in those churches . But he added it would be &quot; sinful &quot; for a Roman_Catholic to knowingly attend a church separated from Rome . Coiro said Roman_Catholics may receive sacraments from an Old_Catholic priest only in an emergency , such_as a last confession when no Roman_Catholic priest is available . Msgr . Daniel Brennan , judicial vicar at the Roman_Catholic Diocese of Orange , added that special church laws governing marriage stipulate that no clergy but the priests of the couple ' s parish may perform a marriage for Roman_Catholics unless the bishop approves . Hickman complained , &quot; The Roman_Catholic_Church seeks to tightly control the lives of its members . By providing an alternative , we are undermining their control. &quot; Patrick Callahan , a bishop in the Old_Catholic_Church who oversees St . Matthew , said he believes an &quot; economic issue &quot; lies at the heart of the diocesan warnings : concern about the prospect of losing income that churches obtain from marriages and other sacraments . Callahan said there are about 20 churches with Old_Catholic roots in Southern California , of which St . Matthew is one of the largest and most active . He said less active churches with &quot; Catholic &quot; in their name have avoided the attention of the Roman_Catholic hierarchy . One such church , St . Francis-by-the-Sea American Catholic_Church , has operated quietly in Laguna Beach since 1933 . &quot; We have not heard anything from the Diocese of Orange , &quot; said Bishop Simon Eugene Talarczyk . He said the church has done very little advertising and performs weddings &quot; by way of referral. &quot; Officials at the Roman_Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles said they became aware of another church in the Old_Catholic tradition , St . Augustine Old Roman_Catholic_Church in East Los Angeles , after news last summer about a scandal involving a priest there . Brenda Anaya-Eckdahl , public affairs officer for the archdiocese , said when stories about the priest ' s conviction for child molestation stated he was not Roman_Catholic , the archdiocese was flooded with calls from St . Augustine parishioners . She said St . Augustine &quot; had been appealing_to newly arrived immigrants , and they thought they were receiving sacraments from the Roman_Catholic Church. &quot; The pastor of St . Augustine , however , contends he tells all his members that the church &quot; is not under the jurisdiction of the Pope. &quot; Baird , the Roman_Catholic diocesan spokesman , said his church is simply trying to prevent its own members from being misguided , to exert a form of &quot; quality control. &quot; He suggested that in Orange County , St . Matthew should reach_out to the &quot; unchurched &quot; people and leave Roman_Catholics alone . &quot; We are very concerned about lapsed Catholics , and both priests and lay people in the parishes have really been trying to do whatever they can to bring people back , &quot; Baird said . &quot; There are heroic people living happy lives as Roman_Catholics , and we don ' t need St . Matthew to assist with the evangelization of those born Roman Catholic. &quot; Catholic Differences St . Matthew Old_Catholic Mission Church in Orange follows the Old_Catholic Movement , started more_than a century ago , and has marked differences from Roman_Catholic teachings .
