   <HEADLINE> can ' t WAIT FOR A FEDERAL ANSWER ; STATE , INDUSTRY MUST FACE INSURANCE PROBLEM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The decision by 20th Century Industries to begin immediately phasing_out its homeowners and earthquake insurance business does not signal a crisis in insurance availability , but it does point_up the possibility of a shortage in coverage for homeowners , especially in Southern California . Within three years , the state ' s eighth-largest insurer plans to stop offering its clients homeowners coverage . Effective immediately , it will write no new policies . At the same time , under a special exemption granted by Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi , the company will stop offering its policyholders quake coverage , beginning with policies up for renewal from July 23 on . The exemption was necessary because companies that sell homeowners coverage must offer earthquake insurance as well . More_than 240 # 000 owners of houses and condominiums are insured with 20th Century . About 90 # 000 carry earthquake insurance , and about 25 # 000 of these live_in the San Fernando Valley . Like nearly every_other large insurer 20th Century was hit hard by quake-related claims , with its losses reaching about $ 600 million . That exposure wiped_out two-thirds of the company ' s surplus and might leave it facing bankruptcy if another large quake were to occur . 20th Century will stay in the automobile_insurance business , but even with newly granted rate increases it says it can ' t afford to continue its homeowner operations . The trouble is that other insurance_companies aren ' t falling all_over themselves right now to sign_up 20th Century ' s customers . In fact , State Farm Insurance Co. , California ' s largest insurer , has frozen most sales of new homeowners policies . Other big insurers are considering similar action . With more_than $ 6 billion in insured quake losses , some insurers are skittish about increasing or in some cases even maintaining their exposure in California . The long-term response to the threat of possible catastrophic losses has to be a national program to insure against natural disasters of all kinds -- floods , quakes , hurricanes and the_like . Legislation to provide_for such coverage has been introduced but has not progressed in Congress . For California specifically , the immediate response has to be effective actions to make_sure that all homeowners who want earthquake coverage are able to find it , at a reasonable cost . If homeowners and earthquake insurance sales are restricted , the housing market would inevitably suffer and the state ' s troubled economy along with it . Here clearly is a problem that demands top-priority attention from the insurance industry and from those in Sacramento who are charged with safeguarding the interests of the industry ' s clients .</TEXT>
