   <TEXT> In an unprecedented merging of pop dynasties , Elvis Presley ' s daughter confirmed Monday through a publicist that she and Michael Jackson were married about 10 weeks ago in a private ceremony outside the United States . Lisa Marie Presley , 26 , announced her wedding to Jackson , 35 , in a statement released through Jackson ' s publicist in Los Angeles . &quot; I am very much in_love with Michael , &quot; she stated . &quot; I dedicate my life to being his wife . I understand and support him . We both look_forward to raising a family and living a happy , healthy life together . We hope friends and fans will understand and respect our privacy. &quot; There was no comment directly from the pop star groom or from Presley . But Bob Jones , his publicist , said Jackson is &quot; very happy . . . like any newlywed. &quot; On Monday , the couple were staying in an apartment at Trump Tower on 5th Avenue in New York City , owner Donald Trump told reporters . A large crowd waited outside the building for a glimpse of the pair after a statement by Trump that the newlyweds appeared happy . The pop world was startled by confirmation of the marriage . &quot; Frankly , I ' m surprised that the rumors were true , and most everybody I talked to in the business has felt the same way , &quot; said Jeffrey Pollack , chairman of Pollack Media Group , a prominent international consulting_firm for radio and film . The ceremony apparently occurred May 26 in the Dominican_Republic -- just as a Dominican judge , Hugo Francisco Alvarez , had been saying for weeks . The marriage comes at a critical time in the singer ' s career -- just months after he spent an estimated $ 15 million to $ 24 million to settle a lawsuit filed on behalf of a 13-year-old Beverly Hills boy who said the pop star sexually molested him in 1993 . The entertainer said the negative publicity surrounding the accusations caused him to become addicted to painkillers and forced the cancellation of his world tour . * Jackson has vehemently denied the allegations but remains the subject of a criminal investigation in Los Angeles . His lawyers demanded on July 6 that Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti either charge the pop star or exonerate him now that a grand_jury investigating the_matter has been disbanded . So far , Jackson has not been charged , nor has the investigation been dropped . Jim Casale , program director at news-talk radio_station WMC in Presley ' s home town of Memphis , said listeners jammed telephone_lines with calls about the marriage during Janis Fullilove ' s popular drive-hour show . &quot; It was like , ' This just can ' t be real , ' &quot; Casale said of listeners ' responses . &quot; Elvis would be turning_over in his grave if he heard the news. &quot; Although the wedding was reported aggressively by tabloid newspapers , other media backed_off the story after the reports at first were heatedly denied by Jackson ' s representatives , including Jones . Contending that the denials hurt his reputation , the Dominican judge offered last month to take a lie_detector test and fly to the United States with copies of wedding documents . In her statement Monday , Elvis Presley ' s daughter , who plans to use the name Presley-Jackson , said the public confirmation was delayed for &quot; several reasons , foremost being we are both very private people living_in the glare of the public media . We both wanted a private marriage_ceremony without the distraction of a media circus. &quot; The couple has been in New York since the wedding , sources said . Jackson has been working there on final details of an album that is scheduled to be released in early November . Titled &quot; History : His Story , &quot; the collection is to include five new songs , as well as 20 of Jackson ' s biggest hits . &quot; As far as his career goes , I don ' t think it will matter one way or the other , &quot; Pollack said . &quot; If the songs on his new album are good , Michael will be a hit . Michael is still widely respected by radio programmers everywhere . Whether he ' s married or has had difficulties , it doesn ' t matter . All that counts is the music. &quot; Priscilla Presley , mother of the bride and former wife of the late rock_star , issued a statement Monday that she was &quot; totally supportive &quot; of the wedding . As for Jackson ' s family , a representative of the singer ' s parents said : &quot; They are not saying a word. &quot; Sources close to Jackson said he and Presley have known each other for about two years . They have been seen in public frequently , including earlier this year in Las Vegas . In April , Presley announced that she was ending her 5 1 / 2-year marriage to rock guitarist Danny Keough , 30 . &quot; Danny and I will always love each other , &quot; Presley said in a statement at the time . &quot; However , friendship was more suitable for us than marriage . We have two wonderful children ( Danielle , 5 , and Benjamin , 18 months ) , and we plan to have joint custody of them. &quot; Like Jackson , Presley has been an extremely private person . Jerry Schilling , a longtime friend of her father ' s and a veteran Los Angeles pop manager , said that he helped her explore a singing career a_few years ago but that she gave_up that pursuit when she became pregnant with her second child . &quot; Lisa Marie is very smart and very strong-willed , &quot; Schilling said . &quot; When she says something , she looks you in the eye and means it . She ' s not someone to do things on a whim or to be easily manipulated . She would n ' t do this unless she believed_in it. &quot; Elvis Presley , the most celebrated figure in modern pop history , died on Aug . 16 , 1977 . He named Lisa Marie , his only child , as his only heir . The estate was put_in trust for her until she turned 25 on Feb . 1 , 1993 . The net value of the trust is believed to be nearly $ 150 million . Times staff writer John Goldman in New York contributed to this story .</TEXT>
