   <HEADLINE> INTEREST_GROUPS FIRING_UP THE ELECTORATE ; POLITICS : ACTIVISTS WORK PHONES , DISTRIBUTE LITERATURE IN UNPRECEDENTED EFFORT TO GET_OUT THE VOTE . THEY ARE MOTIVATED BY HIGH-STAKES RACES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hoping to persuade the cynical and move the faithful to action , activists within the Christian Coalition are passing_out 33 million voter guides to elections from coast to coast and hope to make 2 million phone_calls for their candidates by the Tuesday election . In several states , the AFL-CIO ' s phone banks are now humming day and night and environmental advocates are working side_by_side with favored candidates ' workers in a handful of races considered crucial for their cause . If there is anything more frenzied than the candidates in the final days before this midterm election , it is the bevy of interest_groups that , for a variety of reasons , are investing more , working harder and getting more directly involved than ever before , political experts said . It ' s a &quot; super blitz , &quot; says John Myers , a Philadelphia political organizer . &quot; I ' ve done get-out-the-vote efforts on two other occasions but never to this extent. &quot; One reason for the intense interest is that the stakes are exceptionally high this year -- with the Republicans hoping to capitalize on voter anger and seize an outright majority in the Senate and at least working control , if not a numerical majority , in the House . Those possibilities have given energy to voters on the right far more_than on the left , however , forcing many liberal political organizations to scramble to create interest and boost turnout . In broader terms , many organizations see the 1994 contest as a pivotal point in a struggle for the soul of government and the values of American society . &quot; Attacks on religious conservatives by Democratic candidates and even the Clinton_Administration have been so virulent that it is energizing and driving religious conservatives to the polls , &quot; said Mike Russell , spokesman for the Christian Coalition , which is based in Chesapeake , Va . On the other side , Arthur J . Kropp , president of People for the American Way Action Fund , a Washington-based liberal organization , said that the &quot; Christian Coalition and its allies are working to be the nuts_and_bolts of the Republican_Party . From that position they will shape GOP ideology , strategies and candidate selection for years to come. &quot; For conservative organizations , the election is the payoff for two years of vigorous work that began when President Clinton was elected . &quot; In an off-year election , typically you see a lot of voter apathy , &quot; Russell said . &quot; But this time around our constituency is energized because we have been so insulted and marginalized as a segment of the population that shouldn ' t be heard. &quot; As added insurance , he said , the coalition is spending at least $ 1 million to publish and distribute by hand its voter ' s guide . Another $ 1 million may be spent on its phone banks between now and Election_Day . Many groups on the left are hustling double-time to offset such conservative efforts . Frank Smith , executive_director of Boston-based Green Vote and a longtime liberal political fund-raiser , said that , even before this election cycle , conservative groups like the Christian Coalition have demonstrated a mastery of the political end game by burying the opposition with money and literature in the closing days of campaigns . &quot; Many progressive activists and donors prefer to work_on policy and show disdain for the real work of electing politicians , &quot; he said . &quot; The right_wing understands that politics in the United States is policy &quot; so they work harder in the final day to get their people in office . Interest_groups on the left are fearful because many Democratic voters this year seem less interested in the election . Myers , for example , has expanded the traditional drive to boost voter_turnout . &quot; Usually we did the super blitzes only on Election_Day but , because so many people are apathetic or don ' t seem focused_on the issues or candidates , we felt it was necessary to make our efforts more repetitive , &quot; he said . He said that he has organized 10 teams of 14 people to visit bus_stops and major transit points , knock_on doors and display posters all aimed at persuading people to vote . In several states , AFL-CIO volunteers are telephoning union_members to urge them to support candidates endorsed by their state labor organizations , said Candice Johnson , a spokeswoman in the organization ' s Washington office . Some organizations are lending support directly to individual campaigns . For example , Stephanie H . Sanchez , an environmental fellow for the League of Conservation Voters , has joined the campaign for Jim Maloney , a four-term Democratic state_senator seeking to unseat GOP Rep . Gary Franks in Connecticut ' s 5th Congressional District . &quot; The league placed me in this campaign , &quot; she said . &quot; Our mission is to elect pro-environmental candidates. &quot;</TEXT>
