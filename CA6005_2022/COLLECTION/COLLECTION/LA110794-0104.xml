   <HEADLINE> CROSSED SIGNALS SILENCE LINK TO SHUTTLE ; SCIENCE : MISSION CONTROL REGAINS CONTACT AFTER EIGHT MINUTES OF CONFUSION . NASA REPORTS NO LOSS IN DATA OR DANGER TO ATLANTIS ' CREW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> NASA briefly lost contact with the space shuttle Atlantis and its six astronauts Sunday because of crossed radio_signals . The problem occurred as Atlantis switched from one Tracking and Data Relay Satellite to another , a routine procedure during shuttle flights.Mission Control uses the satellite network to monitor shuttle systems and talk to the crew . About the same time as the switch , a computer failed at the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite station at White Sands , N.M. , and a backup quickly was activated . Communication with Atlantis was restored after eight minutes , but it was an hour before engineers realized crossed signals were to blame for the loss of contact , not the computer . Just before the satellite switch , ground controllers had sent a command to change Atlantis ' radio system from one channel to another . The command never got_through because the shuttle was changing its position . As a result , Mission Control was trying to communicate with Atlantis on one channel while the shuttle was tuned_in to another . Another radio system automatically kicked_in , and communications returned . Neither Atlantis nor its crew was in any danger , and no science data was lost , said Mission Control . A German satellite loaded with infrared and ultraviolet telescopes trailed the shuttle in orbit by less than 60 miles . The astronauts released the satellite Friday so it could measure ozone and atmospheric gases without interference from the shuttle . They ' ll pick it up Saturday for the trip home . Six of the seven atmospheric and solar-energy monitors flying_on Atlantis continued to work well . The seventh -- a German ozone monitor -- remained broken .</TEXT>
