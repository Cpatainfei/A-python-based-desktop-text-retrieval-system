   <HEADLINE> BETTER SAFEGUARDS SOUGHT FOR RESEARCH SUBJECTS ; MEDICINE : ETHICISTS NOTE THAT NEWER REGULATIONS FOCUS HEAVILY ON INFORMED CONSENT , WHICH WAS OFTEN ABSENT IN COLD_WAR RADIATION EXPERIMENTS . BUT SOME WANT MORE SCRUTINY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Each week the ads pop_up in the help-wanted sections of newspapers around this hub for medical research : &quot; Reap the Rewards of Research. &quot; &quot; New Year ' s Cash Flow Low ? &quot; &quot; Earn Up to $ 150. &quot; The ads seek paid volunteers for medical studies , be it a closer look_at toenail fungus or how the elderly sleep . Elsewhere , subjects come from the ranks of the sick ; their payment is the hope of a cure for their illness . Thousands of people take_part each year , and most of them are fully informed of risks involved , unlike the unwitting subjects of radiation research during the Cold_War . But most contemporary research on humans goes_on behind tightly closed doors , with scrutiny mainly by scientists ' peers . &quot; We know more about how many mice , cats , dogs and monkeys are involved in experiments than we do about people , &quot; said Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota . In fact , the federal guidelines on use of laboratory animals are 83 pages long , while its guidelines on human research subjects cover 19 pages . Protecting the right of patient privacy , the medical_community says , is what mitigates against more information being collected on people . Nobody knows exactly how much research is performed on humans . But the federal_Department of Health and Human Services , the biggest single backer of research on humans , funds nearly $ 5 billion worth of projects annually at about 1 # 000 institutions . Who keeps track of the roughly 15 # 000 HHS projects each year ? That and all medical research on humans is guided by the so-called Nuremberg Code , principles of informed consent drawn_up after disclosures about Nazi medical experiments conducted during World_War_II . Under federal regulations enacted only in the 1970s , the Office for Protection from Research Risks is charged with overseeing all research on humans . But the OPRR actually reviews research proposals for 600 of the hospitals , schools and businesses doing HHS research . The 400 other institutions , considered the biggest and best in the country , get approval for research from their own institutional review boards , composed largely of people who work there . &quot; We rely_on the integrity of our investigators , and we have no real reason to believe they would violate the regulations , &quot; said Paula Knudson , coordinator of an institutional review board at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston . &quot; Every hospital or medical_school is like a jungle ; there are drums beating all_the time , &quot; she said . &quot; There are lots of eyes around. &quot; She said that her board checks_out about 1 # 000 research proposals a year , and that in her 17 years on the board the worst violation involved a researcher who failed to get all_of his consent forms signed by participants . Most complaints seem to center_on what is known as &quot; informed consent , &quot; that is , fully telling patients_of the experiment and its risks . For example , paralyzed patients at a Boston hospital contended last year that they were falsely promised they would be able to walk if they underwent an experimental spinal operation . And an independent review last year of a major women ' s health study found that study procedures did not give participants enough information on risks or benefits . The lack of informed consent was at the heart of the controversy over radiation experiments at the Fernald State School for the Mentally Retarded in Waltham after World_War_II . That , and other recently disclosed Cold_War studies with radiation , prompted investigations by the Clinton_Administration and by some members of Congress . Ethicists note that regulations since the 1970s focus heavily on informed consent and make a repeat of the Fernald School experiments highly unlikely . But as recently as a 1992 congressional hearing , questions were raised about whether women in a breast_cancer prevention study were being adequately informed about a drug they would take . And late last month , the National Cancer Institute ordered the University of Pittsburgh to temporarily stop enrolling new patients in 14 cancer studies , including that of tamoxifen , which aims to test whether women susceptible to breast_cancer can avoid developing the disease if they take the drug . Before enrollment can resume , the university and the cancer institute must examine the university ' s oversight procedures and safeguards . The suspension is expected to last at least a month . Gary Ellis , director of the Office for Protection from Research Risks , said his office has investigated 115 complaints about research on humans in the last four years , leading to corrective actions in 90 % of the cases . Most of them related to informed consent of research participants . After the uproar over the post-World War II radiation experiments , some people want even more scrutiny . There are no disclosure regulations for strictly private research , leading some to call_for a law covering all research on humans , just as the Federal Animal Welfare Act does for laboratory animals . Also , drug_company research increasingly is carried_out by companies that specialize in testing , and those tests can escape the scrutiny they might get_in a major teaching hospital , some critics say . Dr. H . Jack Geiger , a past president of Physicians for Social Responsibility , adds that more oversight is needed on human experiments by the military and intelligence agencies , for which there still is no independent review . George Annas , chairman of the health law department at the Boston University Schools_of_Medicine and Public Health , said there should be more protections for experiments on children and the institutionalized disabled . The medical_community resists these pressures . Michelle Scarlatelli , a spokeswoman for Brigham and Women ' s Hospital in Boston , would n ' t list research projects there , saying : &quot; Our obligation is to report to various government_agencies . Our obligation is not to report_out to the press. &quot; &quot; The system is based on trust , &quot; said Ellis , the regulator . &quot; If I told you there were no problems at 1 # 000 institutions and 15 # 000 projects , you would have strong reason to conclude that I was either blind or looking in the wrong place , &quot; he said . But , he said , the complaints his office gets give evidence of &quot; a monitoring_program that is vigorous and healthy. &quot;</TEXT>
