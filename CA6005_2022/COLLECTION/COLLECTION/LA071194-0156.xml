   <TEXT> Let ' s see now . You ' ve gotten_in_touch with your shadow , but it keeps abandoning you . You ' ve reclaimed your inner child , but your inner mom is still nagging you . You ' ve done so many past lives workshops you don ' t know whether you ' re Anne Boleyn or Eleanor Roosevelt or Dr. Quinn , Medicine Woman . Before you start shrieking your truth , is it possible , just possible , you ' ve been overdoing the self-help thing ? That your quest to become whole has become , well . . . an addiction ? Consider these warning signs from Barbara Graham ' s book , &quot; Women Who Run With the Poodles , &quot; published in June by Avon : 1 . You think shopping is a disease . 2 . You ' ve fallen head over heels in_love with yourself and think you make the cutest couple . 3 . Most of the time you feel_like a she-criminal for being too fat , short , smart for your own good , stupid , tall , beautiful , ugly for words . ( Fill_in the blank. ) 4 . You ' re sure happiness is just a Sex-for-One , Ecstatic-Shaman or Hugging-Your-Inner-Werewolf workshop away . &quot; There ' s nothing you can do that ' s OK anymore , &quot; says Graham , a 46-year-old playwright and writer from New York , whose essays and articles have appeared in magazines from Self to New Age Journal . &quot; Everything is a disease . You ' ve got_to exercise , you ' ve got_to go_to yoga , you ' ve got_to have a low-fat_diet . You have to go_to a weekend workshop . Everybody ' s running_around telling us what ' s wrong with us. &quot; &quot; Poodles &quot; is a satirical look_at what Graham calls &quot; the New-Age psychoculture. &quot; For women who have had enough , Graham offers her own brand of self-help in chapters such_as &quot; Reclaiming Your Sacred Inner Bitch &quot; and &quot; Killing the Inner Nazi. &quot; Need to get a handle on that inner Nazi ? Here ' s a sample question from Graham ' s little quiz to see who ' s in_charge : When Mel Gibson got_married , did you A ) feel really bummed and rejected because you knew that if only you had visualized yourself married to Mel , today you would be the much-envied Mrs . G ? B ) think the reason he didn ' t marry any of your friends either is because they ' re lousy at visualizing too ? C ) consider that one reason Mel married the woman he did was because he had actually met her ? If you answered anything but C you ' ve got a problem . &quot; Poodles &quot; has been excerpted in People and reviewed in Entertainment Weekly , and Graham has been appearing on dozens of morning radio and TV talk_shows . With an initial first run of nearly 40 # 000 copies , the book is expected to go_into a second printing soon . Graham conceived &quot; Poodles &quot; as a serious antidote to New-Age excesses -- &quot; these wailing weekends at airport Holiday Inns. &quot; She has done most of the things she parodies in her book -- yoga , dream workshops , growth workshops . She ' s always been interested in self-exploration and the spiritual . &quot; I ' m so_much a product of the ' 60s , &quot; the former hippie says . &quot; I feel I was one of those people searching for the cosmic big bang of healing . Then one day I realized there was no big bang of healing. &quot; Graham , in Los Angeles on a national book tour , is sitting in a posh suite at the Beverly Prescott Hotel . Dressed in a pale green T-shirt , khaki slacks and very expensive Joan and David suede flats , her short hair cut stylishly , she looks nothing like her previous counterculture self . Pinned to her jacket lapel is a poodle decorated with tiny rhinestones , made by a cousin for her book tour . So why poodles and not , say , Persian_cats ? She offers this explanation : &quot; Poodles are descended from wolves , but they progress . They know the importance of a good haircut. &quot; &quot; Poodles &quot; was channeled by Ethel , a lounge singer in Atlantis 50 # 000 years ago , she goes_on . &quot; When I finished a chapter , I never knew what I was going_to write next . My only explanation is Ethel. &quot; What drove Graham over the edge into clarity and the book was one more workshop , she says . In the winter of ' 93 , on a story assignment for Self , Graham attended a past lives workshop . &quot; It was like a scene out of Marat / de_Sade . There were 26 people , and we split into pairs , and we ' re all supposed to relive a death . There ' s all these people lying on the floor , screaming and wailing . On one side this woman is being gang-raped by a pack of 15th-Century infidels . Then across the room a man is vomiting into a white plastic grocery_bag . I was in medieval England , about to be hung . &quot; The woman who ' s leading me is much more caught_up in my story than I am . And she ' s supposed to be leading me but she ' s weeping hysterically. &quot; In the end , the guide was so overcome by emotion she had to be relieved by an assistant . &quot; It was ludicrous , &quot; Graham says . * Graham came_up with her title while joking with an editor from HarperCollins San Francisco , home to many New-Age authors , about Clarissa Pinkola Estes ' best-selling 1992 book , &quot; Women Who Run With the Wolves. &quot; Graham didn ' t have a book in mind , but when the editor asked Graham to submit a proposal , she did , and the book was signed . According to one source at the publisher , when Estes learned about the title of Graham ' s book , she put_in an angry call to Tom Grady , HarperCollins San Francisco ' s publisher . Soon the publishing_house was flooded with faxes and phone_calls from some of its feminist authors . In a voice mail message to one staffer , a writer accused &quot; Poodles &quot; of &quot; undoing the 20 years of work we ' ve spent trying to empower women. &quot; Deena Metzger , a Los Angeles therapist and prominent Harper San Francisco author , was one of the protesters . She says Graham not only ridicules Estes ' book , but women in_general . &quot; You take that title , and you go from wolves to poodles , implying dogs that are very far from wild , that are denied their essential nature in the interest of fashion , you are then talking_about women who are the same. &quot; &quot; I think every movement needs humor , &quot; says Peggy Taylor , editor of the New Age Journal , whose magazine ran a story on the &quot; Poodle &quot; controversy in its June issue . &quot; What I like about Barbara ' s book is it ' s not mean humor . She ' s done all this stuff . She ' s adding some levity to the crazy trips we all go on. &quot; But Harper San Francisco apparently didn ' t see the levity . Under pressure from what a staffer calls &quot; the PC police &quot; and threats that some women authors might bolt , the publisher demanded that Graham change the title . Graham refused , and Avon snapped_up &quot; Poodles &quot; soon after . * Neither Grady nor Estes will discuss the affair . Estes ' agent , Ned Leavitt , says he has nothing to say beyond what he ' d told New Age Journal , which is this : &quot; Why not satirize someone whose work is truly harmful instead of publicly making_fun of a valuable healer like Dr. Estes , whose work needs and deserves our support ? &quot; The flap has only fueled publicity for Graham ' s book . &quot; Clarissa and I have become like the Tonya and Nancy of the New Age , only I ' m not sure who ' s who , &quot; Graham says . But Graham is upset by the negative reaction from Estes and other spirituality authors , whose work she respects . &quot; I see this as a trickster book , &quot; she says , referring to an archetype in Native_American culture , which Estes and many others revere . &quot; They ' re losing sight of the role of the trickster , who keeps things from getting too sanctimonious. &quot; For all its excesses , &quot; the New-Age psychoculture is very valuable . I have personally benefited from it enormously , &quot; she says . &quot; My book is trying to get_across a message that , run with the wolves , bleat with the sheep , but also value yourself the way you are. &quot; ' I ' m so_much a product of the ' 60s . I feel I was one of those people searching for the cosmic big bang of healing . Then one day I realized there was no big bang of healing. '</TEXT>
