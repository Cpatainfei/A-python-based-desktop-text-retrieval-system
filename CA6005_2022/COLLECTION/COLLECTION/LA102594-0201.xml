   <HEADLINE> NATURE STAGES COMEBACK IN FIRE-CHARRED LANDSCAPE ; ECOLOGY : PLANTS AND ANIMALS RE-EMERGE AFTER LAST OCTOBER ' S BLAZES . BUT EXPERTS SAY FULL RECOVERY IS YEARS OFF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If a symbol of hope and renewal has emerged from these fire-ravaged canyons , it is embodied in a modest little shrub called laurel_sumac . Springing from a moonscape of blackened bark and gray ash , knee-high clumps of emerald-green sumac are already dotting the hillsides of Laguna Beach ' s prized Laurel Canyon . Born of autumn fire , weaned on spring rain , the native shrub is one of the first to stage a comeback after last October ' s wind-whipped wildfires scorched about 150 # 000 acres of sage scrub , chaparral and woodlands in five Southern California counties . From Orange County ' s San Joaquin Hills to the Santa Monica and San Gabriel mountains in Los Angeles and Ventura counties , the torched earth had barely cooled when tiny branches of wild sumac began sprouting like clones from the blackened stumps of their predecessors , which everyone but a botanist might assume were hopelessly dead . The rapid regeneration of laurel_sumac and other native plants and animals without human help seems miraculous , but this is one miracle that nature performs routinely in Southern California . Fire is Mother Nature ' s New Year ' s Eve , clearing out the old and ringing in the new . From Thousand Oaks , Malibu and Altadena to Laguna Beach , Temecula and Escondido , thousands of acres of dense , decades-old shrubs and chaparral were incinerated last fall , only to be replaced with small , fresh sprouts and fields of wildflowers by spring . &quot; Fire destroys momentarily but rejuvenates in the long term , &quot; said Mickey Long , director of Altadena ' s Eaton Canyon Nature Center , which burned_down and is yet to be rebuilt . Still , as the first anniversary of the beginning of the firestorms arrives this week , ecology experts say it will take about eight years , perhaps longer , for Southern California to return to the lush , healthy diversity of flora and fauna of a year ago . In the meantime , much of Southern California ' s prime parkland and other wilderness hovers in a fragile , eerie gap between death and resurrection . Forlorn piles of shriveled , fried cactus and raw earth lie next to festive poppies and lilies that rose from the ash in bursts of color last spring . Gnarled , old sycamores and oaks , rendered charcoal black , are sprouting tender green shoots . Some wild animals have survived -- even thrived -- in the aftermath , including burrowing rodents that are vital to the ecosystem as prey for mountain_lions , hawks , eagles and other predators . But the gnatcatcher , a federally protected songbird , has not fared as well . About 14 # 000 acres of some of the bird ' s best habitat was destroyed in the Laguna Canyon fire , and it could be years before the tiny birds return . Just how quickly these animals and their natural habitats recover is almost completely at the mercy of natural forces . The land will fare best if blessed with mild winter rains and spared major fires , at least for awhile . Frequent or ill-timed man-made fires , instead of rejuvenating the wilderness , can permanently denude it of native plants and animals . So far , wildlife biologists and botanists are pleased with the nascent recovery of the wilderness , especially the return of some spectacular , long-dormant wildflowers . Many scorched valley_oaks , sycamores and other trees also survived , including 90 % of 200 oaks burned at Eaton Canyon . Oldest trees fare the best , while some saplings have such thin trunks and bark they cannot survive flames . &quot; It is recovering beautifully , &quot; said Suzanne Good , a state parks associate resource ecologist in the Santa Monica Mountains , who oversees 40 # 000 acres of parkland , most of which burned . &quot; There are certain areas where it is difficult to tell there ever was a fire , especially Malibu Lagoon , where some ( native plants ) are already shoulder high. &quot; One afternoon last week , a full_moon rose on one side of Laguna Beach ' s Laurel Canyon as the sun set_on the other , bathing the chasm in the muted shades of autumn . While most of the wheat-colored ridges were still naked , many were attired in new patches of lemonade berry , sumac and pastel flowers . Hawks and great horned owls , even one rare golden_eagle , soared above . &quot; This looks better than I thought it would , &quot; said botanist Fred Roberts of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , as he toured the area for the first time since the first days after the October fire . &quot; I really thought it would still look dead . I ' m impressed we ' re seeing so_much green. &quot; Before arson-spawned flames fanned by Santa Ana winds whipped across it , this parkland wedged between Laguna Beach , Newport Beach and Irvine had been one of Southern California ' s largest and most biologically diverse wilderness areas . Its thick clumps of sagebrush , lemonade berry and buckwheat attracted gnatcatchers , deer , rare lizards , butterflies and other creatures . After the firestorms , some experts worried that the heat was so intense that the plant roots would be incinerated . Trish Smith , a Nature Conservancy biologist who manages nature reserves owned by Orange County ' s largest landowner , the Irvine Co. , was relieved that the initial fears were wrong . &quot; People were saying it was such an intense wildfire that ( vegetation ) would n ' t come_back very well , so from that perspective , this is better than I expected , &quot; she said . When the flames ignited Oct . 27 , Smith was exploring Laguna Beach ' s lush Boat Canyon , and preparing_for a long-awaited grand opening of the Irvine Co. ' s sprawling reserve the next day . Watching a giant plume of black smoke approach over the ridge , she evacuated . When she returned after the fires were extinguished , about 80 % of the Irvine Co. ' s 6 # 600-acre southern reserve had burned , along with 90 % of adjacent Crystal Cove State Park and Orange County ' s year-old Laguna Coast Wilderness Park . &quot; There was nothing but bare ground and white_ash , &quot; she recalled . &quot; I was in a state of shock. &quot; In the 12 months since then , the expansive area has turned_into what Smith called a botanist ' s dream -- long-dormant flowers such_as California_fuchsia have sprung to life . The public opening of the Irvine Co . reserve was postponed , but the tours are even more popular than expected , Smith said , since nature lovers swarm to the area to watch the rapid changes . Before the fire , flower seeds couldn ' t compete for the sun ' s rays because much of this land was dense with brush . Fertilizer-like nutrients in the ash , sunlight reaching the soil and mild spring rains combined to revive the buried seeds . Other fire-scorched areas -- especially Point Mugu State Park in Ventura County , Leo Carrillo State Beach near Malibu and Caspers Wilderness Park in San Juan Capistrano -- also attracted visitors with striking springtime shows of wildflowers , including many varieties that hadn ' t appeared for years . In the Altadena area , where about 5 # 000 acres of wilderness burned , 20 varieties of flowering plants new_to the area -- including monkey flowers , lilies and phacelia -- and half_a_dozen new species of birds have appeared in Eaton Canyon . Only one local inhabitant -- the acorn woodpecker -- seems to have declined in numbers , apparently because its food supply of acorns was burned . Poppies in burn areas of Leo Carrillo State Beach were more spectacular last spring than the famous annual display in the Antelope Valley . And after Ventura County ' s Green Meadow fire scarred 44 # 000 acres in the Santa Monica Mountains , wildflowers there bloomed in abundance , including two rare types of Mariposa_lilies at the Circle X Ranch . &quot; Circle X was in fact the best display I ' ve ever seen in my life , &quot; said Rick Burgess , a_Thousand Oaks city planner and board_member of a local branch of the California Native Plant Society . &quot; The combination of yellow , lilac and purple was just beautiful. &quot; Some of the flowering plants , dubbed fire followers , require the intense heat of a fire to pop open their tough seed jackets . &quot; I ' m particularly fond of the cream-flowered eardrops , which will bloom profusely the year after a fire , then a little less in subsequent years until they disappear , &quot; Burgess said . The wildflowers , while impressive to human visitors , are not vital to sustaining Southern California ' s ecosystems . Much more critical are California_sagebrush , lemonade berry and other shrubs that native animals use to feed and breed . While the shrubs have begun to re-sprout , they are not nearly mature enough to allow creatures such_as gnatcatchers , a threatened species that resides in Orange , San Diego and Riverside counties , to return . Before the Laguna Canyon fire , 47 pairs and nine single gnatcatchers lived_on 14 # 000 acres of prime sage scrub habitat between Laguna Beach and Newport Beach . After the blaze , none remained , according to spring , 1994 , data accumulated by the Orange County Environmental Management Agency . Also , only three pairs of cactus_wrens -- compared to 101 pairs before the fire -- were found on the burned land . Gnatcatchers , just 4 1 / 2 inches long and feeble flyers , cannot easily flee flames and smoke . Most are presumed dead , although 29 pairs showed_up in the spring on unburned scrub to the northwest , offering hope that they were refugees that escaped the fire . The losses to the gnatcatcher , however , were originally feared to be much worse ; biologists had thought 100 to 200 pairs inhabited the area before the fire , but a review of the data now shows that the birds apparently had been over-counted , said Tim Neely of the environmental management agency . Many gnatcatchers and cactus_wrens also were wiped_out in the firestorms that swept_through Riverside and San Diego counties . &quot; The gnatcatcher took a big beating , &quot; said Bill Wagner , biological resources coordinator at the Metropolitan Water District ' s Riverside County Multi-Species Reserve , two-thirds of which burned . &quot; But over time , they should come_back again. &quot; While the species survived , wildlife biologists warn that it cannot take much more stress -- from either fire or urban development -- before slipping closer toward extinction . Orange County , as a result of the Laguna firestorm , is now reviewing its policies for managing wild land , including new policies for controlled burns . &quot; It was a large amount of habitat that went_up in one fell swoop , &quot; Neely said , &quot; and we are very concerned about the effects of these kinds of catastrophic occurrences , not just on the gnatcatcher but the total biodiversity of the region. &quot; Mice and many other rodents -- important prey for hawks , eagles , coyotes and other predators -- have flourished because thick , tangled brush was burned , leaving more hospitable and nutritious grasses and buds . One endangered species , the Stephens ' kangaroo_rat , might even be better_off now than before the Riverside County fire , which cleared several thousand acres of brush that was becoming too dense to suit the burrowing creatures . &quot; The fire was probably beneficial in the long term , &quot; said John Bradley , a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist . &quot; It opened_up a lot of coastal sage scrub habitat , ( which ) gives the Stephens ' kangaroo_rat a chance to move_into some of those open areas. &quot; Southern California ' s top predator -- the mountain_lion -- also seems to be thriving because of a healthy increase in mule_deer and other prey that feed_on tender sprouts , said state Fish and Game_warden John Wilcox , who patrols the Santa Monica Mountains . Tenacious and destructive weeds , however , such_as mustard and artichoke thistle , are invading and crowding_out some native shrubs and grasses that feed deer , birds and other creatures . Undesirable red brome and wild_oat have grown on slopes in southwestern Riverside County , where more_than 25 # 000 acres burned . Rare grasslands in Point Mugu State Park ' s La Jolla Valley are in particularly poor_shape , since mustard took_hold there after the fires and grew nearly 12 feet tall . &quot; It ( mustard ) gets a head_start on everything else , &quot; said Milt McAuley , author of &quot; Wildflowers of the Santa Monica Mountains , &quot; as he hiked through the valley . &quot; This year there was no competition . It won ' t get quite so high next year. &quot; Some of the responsibility for the appearance of non-native grasses belongs_to the state_Department of Forestry , which sprayed hillsides with seeds to control erosion . Native seed was preferred by forestry officials , but it is difficult to obtain , so a mix containing ryegrass , which can overtake local shrubs and grasses , was sprayed in parts of Altadena , Thousand Oaks and Laguna Beach . Ray Towne , a Pasadena Glen resident involved in reseeding efforts by the Forest Service and the private Forest Preservation Society of Southern California , said cost was a key factor_in choosing seed , leaving them with the choice of spraying ryegrass or risking mudslides in residential_areas . The mix containing ryegrass was considerably less expensive than the native seeds . &quot; Our choices were very pragmatic , &quot; Towne said . &quot; The preservation of life and property and watershed topsoil was what led me to participate in putting ryegrass , a controversial procedure , on the watershed. &quot; Despite such unnatural intrusions , hopeful signs lie_in the return of a vestige of wild California -- the ecologically valuable but mundane shrubs such_as laurel_sumac . &quot; What I like to see is all those little green bushes all_over the_hills , &quot; said McAuley , who hikes in the Santa Monicas several times a week . &quot; That ' ll be a nice forest in five years. &quot; Times staff writer Tom Gorman and correspondents Mary Pols and Deborah Sullivan contributed to this story .</TEXT>
