   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL SCREENINGS : A COLLIE ' S BEST_FRIEND , ' LASSIE COME HOME ' IS LOYAL TO GENRE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every now and then we ' ll hear about a pet that overcomes the impossible to get home . You know , lost in the Rockies , the loyal hound fashions skis from tree_branches , hot-wires a snowmobile parked near an isolated cabin , makes_it to the freeway then hitches a ride back to a worried owner sitting forlornly by the water bowl . That sort of thing . One wonders if these apocryphal tales came_before or after &quot; Lassie Come_Home , &quot; the 1943 MGM flick starring a resourceful collie separated from her loving pal , a 14-year-old played by Roddy McDowall . In the movie , which continues Golden West College ' s &quot; Outdoor Family Film Festival &quot; Friday night , Lassie faces hardship upon hardship before they ' re reunited . No makeshift skis are needed , but the challenges are enough to impress even the most ardent dog worshipers . Lassie displays amazing pluck and ingenuity as she growls down robbers , dogcatchers , storms and rivers to return to grieving Joe , a boy who knows a good canine when he sees one . Yes , &quot; Lassie Come_Home &quot; is straightforward hokum , but as pure-hearted as it is emotionally sappy . Besides , the picture -- like any good family entertainment -- offers all_the proper morals of a child-oriented fable . Devotion , love , responsibility , bravery , gumption , they ' re all there , in big , sentimental strokes . &quot; Lassie Come_Home &quot; also puts the youthful McDowall and a remarkably appealing Elizabeth Taylor ( she was 11 in this , her movie debut ) in the spotlight . They both fly over the top , but who cares ? They ' re only kids , and both know how to work a scene better than the hammiest grown-up . McDowall had practice , starring in &quot; My Friend Flicka &quot; earlier in 1943 . Taylor went_on the next year to play the horse-infatuated heroine in &quot; National Velvet . Up next for the series is &quot; Tom Thumb. &quot; The 1958 movie screens July 22 in the campus amphitheater , as do the rest of the program ' s films . Russ Tamblyn stars as the tiny Tom in this re-creation of the Grimm fairy tale . On July 29 , the recent release &quot; Beethoven ' s 2nd &quot; is scheduled . This film about a_couple_of Saint Bernards , their puppies and the family that digs them stars Charles Grodin and Bonnie Hunt . &quot; Thumbelina &quot; is offered Aug . 5 . Another recent release , this animated feature tells the story of a bite-size dancer born to normal-size parents . Celebrity voices include John Hurt and Gilbert Gottfried . On Aug . 12 , &quot; Snowball Express &quot; checks_in . The 1972 comedy stars Dean Jones as a guy who tries to turn a dilapidated hotel into a booming ski resort . The series ends Aug . 19 with Disney ' s 1964 classic &quot; Mary Poppins , &quot; featuring Julie Andrews as the magical singing nanny .
