   <HEADLINE> IRA PLEDGES 3-DAY TRUCE TO INDUCE BRITISH TO NEGOTIATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Irish_Republican_Army announced late Wednesday that it will observe a three-day cease-fire next week in its long campaign of terrorism against the_British government to force it out of Northern_Ireland . In a statement , the IRA said it hopes the_British will use the truce as a &quot; further opportunity in the spirit in which it is offered. &quot; The implication was that the_British should now negotiate with Sinn Fein , the political arm of the IRA , for a &quot; clarification &quot; of the Dec . 15 Downing Street Declaration , which offered talks with the IRA but only after a three-month cease-fire . Gerry Adams , leader of Sinn Fein , called Wednesday night for immediate talks between the_Irish republican groups and the_British government and said there will be several days in which to make contact . Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds welcomed the cease-fire , which is to begin at midnight Tuesday . But he also called_for a total &quot; cessation of violence. &quot; He did not indicate whether he plans to make any contact with the IRA . But British Prime_Minister John Major , on a previously scheduled trip to Northern_Ireland , said in Belfast that the IRA cease-fire overture was &quot; cynical. &quot; He said the people of Northern_Ireland want a &quot; permanent end to violence , &quot; not a &quot; public relations gesture. &quot; Neither the IRA nor Sinn Fein has accepted the conditions of the Downing Street Declaration , which Adams has insisted London must clarify . He made that demand during a 48-hour trip to New York earlier this year . But Major ' s government has refused , arguing that the declaration is clear and that any further talks would constitute &quot; negotiations , &quot; which cannot take_place until after a three-month cease-fire . The IRA announcement was the first time that the group , which demands that the_British leave Northern_Ireland , has called an Easter cease-fire . It observed a similar truce last Christmas . Earlier this month , IRA mortar attacks on London ' s Heathrow Airport disrupted flights at one of the world ' s busiest airports . The truce announcement was received coolly by Northern_Ireland Protestants , who said that only a permanent end to violence would be meaningful . But John Hume , a moderate Roman_Catholic member_of_Parliament , said Wednesday night that the_British government should &quot; leave no stone unturned , &quot; hinting that the_British should talk with the IRA before or during the cease-fire .</TEXT>
