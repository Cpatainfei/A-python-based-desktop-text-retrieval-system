   <HEADLINE> IMPACT MOUNTS IN TRANSIT STRIKE ; LABOR : MTA WILL NOT MEET AGAIN WITH MECHANICS UNTIL FRIDAY ; NO WEEKEND SERVICE IS PLANNED IF WALKOUT CONTINUES . LONG WAITS , LOST WAGES PLAGUE STRANDED RIDERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Los Angeles ' first transit strike in more_than a decade wore_on , frustration mounted across the region ' s tangled roadways Wednesday with angry freeway drivers bristling over rush-hour delays and anxious bus riders scrambling to keep their daily routines from also screeching to a halt . The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its striking mechanics ended six hours of negotiation late Tuesday night and will not meet again until Friday . If no agreement is reached by then , bus riders face an even tougher time : No weekend service is planned . The full impact of the walkout , now entering its fourth day , is only beginning to register for hundreds of thousands of car-less commuters , who have been forced to put_up with long waits , lost wages and unexpected hardships -- like the Mid-City woman who was denied a job interview after arriving 15 minutes late in a bandit cab , or the stranded Delta Airlines cabin cleaner who had to spend the night curled_up at LAX . &quot; It has totally turned my life upside down , &quot; said Katheryn Marie Smith , 25 , as she waited for a bus in the Westlake district to take her home to Eagle Rock . &quot; I ' m buying a car. &quot; The job action , led by the MTA ' s 1 # 900 mechanics , is also taking a growing toll on those who work for the nation ' s second-largest transit system , which Wednesday put only 18 % of its buses on_the_road . Supervisors -- some of whom have not maneuvered the lumbering vehicles for decades -- rushed to relearn the basics . They were greeted with taunts from mechanics , as well as drivers and clerks who are honoring the picket_lines ; the workers formed human blockades outside some of the MTA ' s 32 bus yards . After hearing claims by transit officials that replacement drivers had been threatened as they crossed the picket_lines , a Superior_Court judge Wednesday ordered the strikers not to come within five feet of a moving bus . Although there were indications that the strikers had backed_off , they remained a vocal presence outside many yards , such_as the South-Central facility , where they chanted , barbecued ribs and hooted at their bosses , who responded from behind the wheels with sheepish shrugs . &quot; C ' mon baby . . . let ' s see what you can do . . . don ' t hurt nobody , &quot; some of the strikers teased , as the rusty drivers hesitantly pulled into the yard . &quot; It ' s not a great feeling to be operating under these conditions , &quot; conceded veteran supervisor Will Ivory , 47 , who was thrust into emergency service despite having last driven a bus when Richard Nixon was President . &quot; I know a lot of these guys . I definitely understand where they ' re coming from. &quot; On Day 3 : * Despite the two-day suspension of negotiations , striking workers and MTA management expressed cautious optimism . Sources close to the talks said the two sides are considering a compromise that would eliminate the major stumbling_block : the issue of subcontracting . Under discussion is a labor-management committee that would set rules on the MTA ' s desire to shift some work from its unionized workers to less expensive private companies . Union leaders fear that the practice could ultimately eliminate their jobs . In a pointed jab at the MTA ' s top brass , strikers leaked a document revealing the salaries of the highest-paid officials -- 40 of whom , according to the list , earn more_than $ 100 # 000 annually . * The strike-crippled agency managed to put another 27 buses on_the_road , bringing the total in_service to 345 , which traversed 30 selected routes . Normally , 1 # 900 buses serve 200 routes . The MTA also boosted from 40 to 56 the number of phone operators assigned to staff an information hot_line , 1-800-COMMUTE . Even so , callers lucky enough to get_through had to wait an average of seven minutes before speaking_to an operator . A new phone_line featuring recorded transit information -- 1-800-870-0MTA -- also was placed into service . * Traffic on freeways remained congested , though the increase Wednesday was gauged at just 2 % , which officials said was the equivalent of adding five minutes to the typical commute . &quot; It ' s the difference of going 50 m.p.h. versus 35 m.p.h. or less , &quot; said Chuck O ' Connell , deputy district director of operations at the local Caltrans office . Those figures represented a decline from Tuesday , when Caltrans had said that extra congestion was adding about 15 minutes to the average commute . Traffic volume was reported as slightly heavier on freeways that buses usually travel , such_as the Hollywood , San Bernardino and Pomona . Vehicles on surface streets continued to flow smoothly -- the result , city officials say , of fewer buses on_the_road . * With hundreds of students unable to attend summer school because of the strike , Los Angeles Unified School District officials adopted a new policy allowing students to make_up class assignments and tests , or to be dropped from the program without a grade . The policy differs from previous summer school rules_in which students who miss more_than three days without valid excuses can be given a failing grade . But district officials said that the bus strike is unusual and that they do not believe the students should be penalized . * Business was booming for taxi companies , as well as for other entrepreneurs , who took_advantage of the chaos by charging stranded straphangers for rides to their destinations . At the same time , many Angelenos were barely aware of the problem -- further evidence of the two-tiered nature of Southern California commuting . &quot; It ' s like a lot of things in the news -- you feel kind of detached unless it directly affects you , &quot; said David Schrader , an attorney with Brobeck , Phleger &amp; Harrison who commutes from Manhattan Beach to his Downtown office in a black Mitsubishi Eclipse . &quot; I don ' t drive past any of the picket_lines . I haven ' t seen anyone waiting endlessly at a bus_stop . I haven ' t even really noticed any increase in the traffic. &quot; As it has from the beginning , the brunt of the strike continued to be felt by the more_than 500 # 000 commuters who rely_on the public_transit system every day . Ever since MTA mechanics , followed by 5 # 000 bus and train drivers and clerks , walked_off the job at 12:01 a.m. Monday , Alfredis Tapia has been forced to spend more_than seven hours a day improvising his way to a hodgepodge of part-time jobs around town . &quot; I ' m depressed , worried , just like everyone , &quot; said Tapia , a Westlake district resident , as he boarded a bus at Alvarado Street and Wilshire Boulevard , hoping to make_it on_time to his job at a dry_cleaner in Pacific Palisades . If the strike goes_on , he said , &quot; I ' ll probably go crazy. &quot; Not far away , Fernando Bangandian fumed , while fingering his monthly bus pass . &quot; I ' m wasting my money like this ! &quot; snapped Bangandian , 27 , as he waited for a bus to take him from his class at the nearby Associated Technical College . He just started classes this month , but said he was thinking_of dropping_out if the bus strike continues to make his commute last several hours . &quot; A lot of people ' s getting mad , &quot; he said . Few have a horror story , however , to compare with that of Paula Smith , who works nights cleaning the cabins of Delta airplanes . To get_to work from her Mid-City home Tuesday afternoon , Smith caught a yellow school_bus , which took her only as far as Slauson Avenue before the driver announced to her surprise that it was the end of the line . She then walked to Century Boulevard and waited at another bus_stop for about 45 minutes before she was spotted by a friend with a car who took her the rest of the way to the airport . But if her journey to work was a pain , it was nothing compared to the return trip . When Smith got_off work_at 12:30 a.m. Wednesday , she discovered that there would be no bus_service until dawn . &quot; Pretty bad , &quot; is how she described her restless night , spent huddled in an LAX passenger terminal . &quot; Tonight will probably be the same thing again. &quot; Scrambling to get more buses on_the_road , MTA officials on Wednesday continued their efforts to train administrators in the finer points of defensive driving . While no MTA personnel were forced to become bus_drivers during the strike , they would not have been paid had they declined to attend the intensive four-week bus_driver program being held at the agency ' s El Monte depot . Gladys Lowe , a grant analyst in the MTA ' s capital planning section , was among several dozen employees who spent the day in class , shoulder to shoulder with many other reluctant but diligent students , who never imagined that they would sit behind the wheel of a bus . &quot; I don ' t like to drive , &quot; the 35-year-old Santa Clarita resident lamented . &quot; It ' s not my cup_of_tea , &quot; added Larry Bates , 51 , who usually conducts seminars on interpersonal skills . He said he was stunned when he first sat in the driver ' s seat . &quot; Seems like a cockpit with all these buttons . It ' s a whole different view of the world. &quot; The striking drivers who stood vigil since 2:30 a.m. outside the MTA ' s South-Central bus yard on 54th Street made_sure to use their replacements ' lack of experience as ammunition . Chanting &quot; Whoomp there it is ! &quot; to a rap beat , they blocked each bus from leaving the facility for four minutes -- a time mutually agreed upon by union leaders and police . Claude Mitchell , a 17-year veteran mechanic , complained Wednesday that one of the supervisors behind the wheel had stared him down and then barreled by , grazing his hip with the bus bumper . &quot; If that had been one of us , we would have been called_in for a drug test , &quot; said Mitchell , who was not injured . But most of the other strikers were remarkably sympathetic to the drivers who had been called_in , explaining that their beef was with the top brass and not mid-level managers , who had no choice in the_matter . The gentle teasing during the four-minute blockades was like a congenial minuet . &quot; The only reason it ' s peaceful is that we know these guys would rather not drive these buses off the yard , &quot; said Willie Haigler , 46 , a driver for the last 10 years . &quot; If these were scab drivers , all hell would break_loose here. &quot; After reading one replacement driver ' s tale , however , Los Angeles Superior_Court Judge William Huss decided to impose some limits . In an affidavit presented to the judge , Andrew Bernstein contended that his life was threatened and his path was blocked as he tried to maneuver a bus out of a Downtown Los Angeles bus yard . &quot; A ( striking ) driver ran to my bus . . . and pulled open my window and tried to get_at me , &quot; Bernstein wrote . &quot; My home was threatened with destruction. &quot; Richard A . Katzman , an attorney for the MTA , also contended that picketers were &quot; endangering themselves by attempting to block or impede the 40-foot , seven-ton buses that enter and exit the divisions . The picketers are causing the buses to delay commencement of service on MTA ' s lines . They are causing the buses to leave the divisions at alternate exits , which creates a danger to the bus operators and to motorists on the public highways. &quot; Huss , in_ordering strikers to keep their distance , said : &quot; This is serious , and it will not be tolerated by this court if it is true. &quot; He set an Aug . 12 hearing on a preliminary injunction . Joe Freitas , a lawyer for the mechanics union , said that the protests at the bus yards have been noisy but have been nonviolent and monitored by Los Angeles city and transit police with no arrests . He added that he did not believe any mechanics had prevented replacement buses or other vehicles from entering or leaving bus yards , but that union_members would abide_by the court_order . &quot; I don ' t anticipate any problems whatsoever , &quot; he said . At the MTA bus yard in Sun Valley on Wednesday , there were not enough strikers to try to block buses anyway . Where about 40 had picketed at the entrance of the yard the previous day -- delaying buses for up_to 15 minutes at times -- only two strikers were out Wednesday afternoon . Everyone else had gone elsewhere to avoid the searing sun . &quot; I don ' t think we ' d be successful in blocking a bus , &quot; said John Crogan , a striking mechanic , sitting in the shade as supervisors pulled buses out of the depot . &quot; Everybody ' s just being real cool today. &quot; San Fernando Valley taxi driver Stephen Kloc has no ill_will toward the strikers or frustrated commuters , but he ' s in no hurry for the strike to end , just the same . &quot; I ' d say business has increased maybe 60-70 % , &quot; said Kloc , an ex-Marine , as he pulled_out of the Checker Cab yard at 7 a.m. on his way to his first fare of the day . &quot; All through the days the calls come , not just during the drive-time hours. &quot; The clientele is by and large pleasant too . Those displaced by the strike might not be big tippers -- after all , they ' re making a major adjustment from the $ 1.10 bus_fare to the cab ' s $ 1.90 pickup fee plus 20 cents for each one-eighth of a mile or 40 seconds waiting time -- but Kloc figures they are not likely to pull a knife on him , as happened once , or to get sick in his cab , which has happened a_few times with fares picked_up at bars . &quot; These are nice people who woke_up Monday morning and realized they . . . would have to find another way to get_to work , or wherever , &quot; said Kloc , who has been driving a cab since January of last year . For Alex Regio , the strike has been a chance to turn a quick buck , albeit illegally , undercutting the prices charged by cabbies like Kloc . First , the 19-year-old unemployed painter had to get his ' 87 Nissan Sentra out of the shop , where it was being serviced for clutch problems . But by Wednesday , even though it shakes and rattles between gears , he was ferrying people in the MacArthur Park area for $ 2 . &quot; I ' m trying to take_advantage of the extra opportunity that the RTD is giving us , &quot; said Regio , who after 2 1 / 2 hours of work had shuttled 10 riders and had $ 20 in his pocket . Already , he had developed a marketing strategy , placing his wife , 24-year-old Miriam Cruz , in the front seat with him . &quot; There ' s people who look_at me , I ' m a man , and they ' re nervous , &quot; he said . &quot; When they look_at my wife , they look her over and say , he doesn ' t look that bad. &quot; Times staff writers Nicholas Riccardi , Beth Shuster , J . Michael Kennedy , Timothy Williams and David Colker contributed to this story .</TEXT>
