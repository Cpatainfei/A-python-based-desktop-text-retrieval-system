   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : COLORADO ; CITY OF OLYMPIC TRIBUTES ; BUT HARDING SCANDAL IRONIC FOOTNOTE AT SKATING MUSEUM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The costume is unremarkable by figure-skating standards : a long-sleeved , conservatively beaded light-aqua dress with a short skirt cut_to resemble the petals of a flower . But it represents a most remarkable moment in figure-skating history : It was the costume worn by Tonya Harding at the 1991 United States National Figure_Skating Championships , when she became the first U.S. woman ever to perform a triple-axel jump in competition . As I stood last summer before the case displaying that costume , at the World Figure_Skating Museum and Hall_of_Fame in Colorado Springs , I could never have imagined that the woman who wore it would soon become the center of a scandal that has turned world attention on the sport . The museum contains nothing of her rival Nancy Kerrigan , whom Harding will duel for Olympic gold this Wednesday and Friday . Kerrigan , of course , is the 1992 Olympic bronze medalist who was whacked in the knee at this year ' s National Championships in Detroit in a plot Harding ' s former husband has admitted to masterminding along with , he alleges , Harding herself . With the media frenzy that the Kerrigan attack has produced , not only die-hard figure-skating fans like myself but people who previously did not know a triple axel from a car axle might find some fascination with this museum . And , for those caught_up in the Olympic spirit after watching the Winter Games in Lillehammer , Norway , the skating museum is only one of a number of sporting sites to see here . Sponsored by the United States Figure_Skating Assn. , the sport ' s governing body , and located on two floors at USFSA headquarters , the museum may be the only institution in the world devoted exclusively to all aspects of the sport . For skating fans , the museum is an &quot; ooh and ah &quot; kind of place . But even visitors not interested in skating may be intrigued . There is interesting history in the museum ' s Skate Gallery where , for example , skates made of cow and sheep bones , dating_back to the 8th Century , are_on view . The World and United States Hall_of_Fame galleries , with their trophies and photographic plaques , detail the accomplishments of skating greats . Also on display are more_than 20 versions of &quot; Hans Brinker and the Silver Skates , &quot; perhaps the best-known skating story in the world , along with an assortment of other novels , magazines and show programs . A video plays skating highlights from ABC continuously . The art exhibits begin with a life-size bronze sculpture of Britain ' s Patricia Dodd , former star of the John Curry Skating Co. , at the entrance . It was donated by its sculptor , Stanley Taub , but the bulk of the artwork on display is from the &quot; Skating in Art &quot; collection of Swedish skater Gillis Grafstrom , a 1920s Olympic champion . Grafstrom ' s extensive assemblage of skating-related art , figurines , porcelain , silver , crystal , antique skates and other historical items is exhibited throughout the museum . Among older holdings are a calendar print , circa 1580 , and a 1784 copper engraving of a Massachusetts River ice sports scene . Several of the world ' s most renowned skaters merit their own sections , with photos and memorabilia . One is Brian Boitano , the 1988 Olympic champion from Northern California who returned to amateur competition this season after six years as a professional . He came_in second at the U.S. Nationals in January , and on Saturday was scheduled to make his second bid for Olympic gold . On display is a mannequin bearing the costume , a scarlet and blue military-style outfit , that Boitano wore at the 1988 games . A tribute to 1984 Olympic gold medal_winner Scott Hamilton features his Olympic and World Championship medals , red-and-blue Olympic skating costume , Olympic team member certificate , a Senate citation and trophies won as an amateur and a professional . Three-time Olympic champion , Norwegian skater Sonja Henie , who won movie stardom in the late 1930s and ' 40s , is represented in a display of Madame Alexander dolls that more closely resemble Shirley Temple . And there are photos galore , plus Henie ' s last pair of skates and final exhibition costume . For me , the highlight of the museum was the costumes , beginning with Boitano ' s . Other favorites were the navy-blue attire of surprise 1992 Olympic silver medalist Paul Wylie , the striking black-and-red &quot; Carmen &quot; dress worn by Debi Thomas when she won the 1988 Olympic bronze , and the simple , powder-blue , rainbow-themed exhibition outfits of Los Angeles ' 1979 World Champions , Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner . In sharp contrast to these happy reminders , one exhibit brought tears . It was the tribute to the 1961 World Figure_Skating Team , whose members , along with coaches , officials , family and friends , died in a plane crash in Brussels en route to the World Championships in Prague . Four were Los Angeles-area skaters . Photos , medals and costumes pay tribute to promises unfulfilled , and a memorial book contains expressions of sympathy from skaters and devotees around the world , beginning with President John F . Kennedy . The museum also hosts changing special exhibits , such_as the one on view through March : a collection tracing Olympic figure_skating from 1908 , when the sport was introduced during the Summer Games in London . Another exhibit , featuring the work of well-known skating photographer Paul Harvath , continues through August . The museum may have been a figure-skating mecca for me , but it was just the first stop on my pilgrimage . From there , I took the 10-minute walk south to the Broadmoor Hotel to check_out the skating at the legendary Broadmoor World Arena . And not a moment too soon : The venerable rink has been the site of six previous U.S. and five World Championship events , and the 1994 World Junior Championships held last December . It was also the training home of 1968 Olympic champion Peggy Fleming . Sadly , the historic rink will close March 15 for demolition to make_way for a new addition to the resort_hotel . Inside , the legacy of more_than 50 years of competitions and training sessions was almost palpable . Practicing on this particular July day were 1994 Olympic contender and 1993 and ' 94 U.S. men ' s champion Scott Davis , who regularly trains here , and this year ' s Olympic silver medalists , pair skaters Natalia Mishkutienok and Artur Dmitriev of Russia . Figure_skating isn ' t the only sport celebrated here . The city , is , after all , the site of the largest of three U.S. Olympic training centers , which , in turn , house the U.S. Olympic Committee , the governing body for the Olympic and Pan American Games . Established in 1978 at the behest of then-President Gerald Ford , who was dismayed by U.S. athletes ' poor showing at the 1976 Olympics , the center hosts about 17 # 000 athletes per year , usually for one or two weeks . I took a one-hour tour of the 36-acre complex , formerly a U.S. Air_Force base and NORAD headquarters . Inside , even I , who despise boxing , was impressed by the pageantry of the brightly colored boxing rings , with their bags and mirrors for shadow boxing . Through a glass wall adjoining the boxing area , I could see a large gymnasium , complete with television lighting , which can be divided into three gyms for any of 13 Olympic events , including gymnastics , volleyball and basketball . Our next stop was the Shooting Center , which claims to be the largest indoor gun-shooting facility in the Western_Hemisphere . In the lobby were shooting-related artworks , among them a bronze sculpture of an arrow-toting goddess , and a Korean crown -- trophies from national competitions . We learned the finer points of the sport while observing junior-level shooters wearing jackets and gloves , we were told , to muffle their heartbeats so they would not be distracted by the sound . The tour ends at the gift_shop , jampacked with Olympic-logo merchandise , with proceeds benefiting athletes . Each tour participant receives a glossy , photo-laden book detailing Olympic history . I had planned the Olympic Training Center as the end of my sports trek , but I was mistaken . At the summit of 14 # 110-foot Pikes Peak , just outside the city , I discovered a granite monument erected by the U.S. Olympic Committee with the names of all Olympic athletes who have trained in Colorado Springs . Seeing this tribute , set against the vistas that in 1893 had inspired Katherine Lee Bates to write the lyrics to &quot; America the Beautiful , &quot; proved a truly grand finale to my pilgrimage .
