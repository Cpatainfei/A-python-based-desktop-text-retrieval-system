   <HEADLINE> U.S.-JAPAN TALKS CONTINUE AS TRADE_GAP GROWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As American and Japanese officials continued discussions Friday on resuming formal trade negotiations , Japan announced that its trade surplus , the source of friction with its trading partners , rose 8.1 % in April . The snowballing surplus reached $ 11.12 billion last month -- the fifth straight month of year-on-year rises in the overall surplus , Japan ' s Finance Ministry said . The surplus with the United States , Japan ' s largest trading partner , rose for the second month in a row , surging 8.9 % to $ 4.38 billion , the ministry said . The growing trade imbalance was central to the &quot; framework &quot; trade negotiations between the United States and Japan , which collapsed in February . Representatives of the two countries met in Washington on Thursday for the first time since the breakdown in an effort to restart the stalled talks . After several hours of discussions Friday , talks were recessed so officials could consult with other members of their respective governments . A spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the talks would continue today . The negotiations broke_down over U.S. demands for numerical benchmarks for measuring progress in opening Japan ' s markets . Japan says numerical targets would violate free-trade principles . The Finance Ministry attributed the increase in the surplus in part to the Japanese yen ' s steep rise in recent months . Ministry officials said that in yen terms , the overall surplus in April fell 1.6 % in its third straight monthly decline . The surplus with the United States dipped 0.9 % . The dollar averaged 104.43 yen in April , down 10 % from a year earlier , they said . Some economists believe a strong yen will cut Japan ' s surplus in the long_run by making Japanese products more expensive and thus less competitive overseas , and by making imports cheaper for Japanese consumers . But Japan ' s sagging economy has restricted consumer spending on both imported and domestic products . Ministry officials said lower crude_oil prices were another factor_in the surplus . With crude_oil prices falling 21.2 % to about $ 14.57 per barrel , oil imports fell 20.4 % in value while the volume remained almost unchanged , they said . Exports in April rose 7.1 % from a year earlier to $ 32.89 billion , while imports increased 6.6 % to $ 21.77 billion , the report said . Among the export gainers in April were semiconductors and other electronics parts , up 31.8 % ; automobile parts , up 28.3 % , and ships , up 62.4 % , the report said . For imports , semiconductors and other electronics parts rose 33.1 % , clothing increased 19.3 % and aircraft surged 140 % , it said .</TEXT>
