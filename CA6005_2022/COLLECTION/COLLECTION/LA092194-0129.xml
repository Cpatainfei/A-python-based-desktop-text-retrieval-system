   <TEXT> Since most homes have only one thermostat , some rooms get too cold while others are too hot . But in the home of the future , tiny sensors may signal when a room is too cold and , in response , tiny heat_pumps embedded in the walls will immediately circulate warmer air . At least that ' s the vision of researchers at the Department_of_Energy ' s Pacific Northwest Laboratory . They ' re developing a heat_pump smaller than a dime -- small enough that they could be fabricated on a single sheet and incorporated into the walls of homes and buildings . Replacing conventional heat_pumps would also save energy . that ' s because micro pumps don ' t need the ducts used to carry heat from room to room , and 20 % to 30 % of the energy produced by a regular heat_pump is lost in such ducts . Another 10 % to 15 % of energy is lost when the pump cycles off and on . A working model of the micro pumps , which are made by the same photo-etching process used to make computer chips , is expected to be ready in about three years . Large-scale commercial development will depend_on the efficiency of the pump and its manufacturing costs . X-Rays From Hollow Atoms : Hollow atoms may provide the breakthrough physicists at the University of Illinois , Chicago have been looking_for in their 10-year effort to build an X-ray laser microscope powerful enough to reveal how viruses attack cells and how cancer_cells grow . Taking pictures of living cells at a microscopic scale requires an extremely bright light_source because the size of the object visible through a microscope is limited by the wavelength of the light_source : The shorter the wavelength , the higher the possible magnification . X-rays lie at the short-wavelength end of the light spectrum , but generally they ' re still not_able to bring molecular-sized objects into view . The solution may lie_in a procedure in which xenon atoms are bombarded with intense ultraviolet_radiation , causing the inner shells of the atoms to be ripped away , creating a &quot; hollow &quot; atom . When electrons rush in from the outer shells to fill the hollow space , X-rays are released . Researchers hope to have an operable X-ray laser by the end of the year . Satellite Golf : Global positioning systems , which use a special network of satellites and miniature satellite_receivers to determine exact geographical locations , are used to track truck fleets and airplanes . But Leading Edge Technologies Inc. , based near Phoenix , wants to use GPS technology to keep track of golf_carts . The company equips its Prolink golf_carts with an on-board GPS system , including a 7.5-inch color monitor , a Rockwell satellite_receiver and an individual information-processing system . Not only do the carts provide duffers with a full-color display of hole layouts and yardage , but they can also get tips from the course ' s golf_pro before playing a hole . Back at the clubhouse , an additional receiving unit helps the course manager keep track of all players and the speed of play of each cart . Leading Edge provides Prolink to courses on a per-round fee basis . Treasury Agents : Some people who have wrestled with the IRS might agree that what the service needs is more smart agents . In lieu of hiring a bunch of doctorates , the IRS has begun using the services of &quot; smart &quot; software agents from Comshare Inc. of Ann Arbor , Mich . The company ' s Commander Exception Monitor &quot; detect and alert &quot; software , co-developed with Anderson Consulting , is being used to help managers with their strategic planning process . These secret software agents will hide_out in the IRS database and monitor whether regional offices are paying their bills on_time , tracking non-filers and processing returns in a timely and accurate manner . When the agent finds data that fits the parameters defined by the IRS , it assembles the information in a report that is downloaded to a manager ' s desk . An office that has fallen below acceptable levels will be immediately visible . Eventually , the IRS hopes to have software agents track other functions such_as accounts receivable and accounts in litigation . Sun to ' Syngas ' : One of the problems with solar_energy is how to deliver the power to users hundreds of miles away . The Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot , Israel , recently inaugurated a novel system for storing and transporting solar_energy in liquid-chemical form . The key element of the system is a solar reformer . Solar radiation is first concentrated and then directed into the reformer through a domed quartz window . The concentrated sunlight produces a chemical_reaction between carbon_dioxide and methane , which in turn produces hydrogen and carbon_monoxide as a mixture known as &quot; syngas. &quot; This mixture can be stored until needed and transported through a pipeline to any destination .</TEXT>
