   <HEADLINE> STUDENTS HIT THE BOOKS FOR MORE THAN AN EDUCATION ; TRENDS : MANY APPEAR TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE CAMPUS ROUTINE , ESPECIALLY IN TROUBLED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL TIMES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Carol Ziehm graduated from Mission Viejo High_School , the effect was like stepping off the curb into oncoming traffic . &quot; The world was confusing , &quot; says Ziehm , of Mission Viejo . &quot; I felt kind of lost . I just wasn ' t sure what I wanted to do. &quot; Buoyed by the A + she had received in a high_school accounting class , right out of high_school she enrolled at Saddleback Community_College in Mission Viejo and in two years received an associate ' s degree in business . But figuring_out how to apply it to the real_world beyond college was daunting . &quot; It didn ' t lead anywhere , so I just kept taking classes , &quot; says Ziehm , 39 , who says she spent many years as a &quot; professional student. &quot; &quot; I figured there had to be something out there that was fulfilling and rewarding. &quot; For many , school provides a certain predictable structure that makes_it a cozy and safe alternative to the real_world with its corporate downsizing , deficit trade imbalance and a shaky Social_Security system . School dictates where to go , what to do , when to do your homework and go_to_bed . It is more_than an education in biology and economics . It teaches organization , discipline , time and money management . Many appear to make a profession of being a student , especially in troubled economic and social times . Like many students , Ziehm recalls her early college years as a time to do some serious thinking about herself . She says the time was right for it : a melancholia surrounded the end of the Vietnam_War , and the president , once a figure of authority and respect , was resigning from the White_House in shame , a cartoonish figure satirized in Mad Magazine . Ziehm says she felt the world was an unsafe and untrustworthy place , and she continued to seek comfort and protection in school . &quot; Saddleback was always there , &quot; Ziehm says . &quot; Education was great no matter how you felt about the world . I felt very lucky to have the community_college available to me . It was a place to take your time and excel and find your niche. &quot; Marian Salzman , president and founder of BKG America , a market research firm based in New York that studies trends of the twentysomething generation , says , &quot; There are so many freeways to becoming a smart , enlightened person . Formal school is only one of them. &quot; Salzman says many young people stay in school because it is an acceptable form of soul-searching in the years after high_school . &quot; We all seem to need a label , &quot; Salzman says . &quot; ' Student ' seems to be more acceptable than perhaps ' slacker. ' &quot; * &quot; A lot of my friends don ' t want to deal with the routine of the real_world , &quot; says Kurt Hueg , public information officer at Saddleback and a 1986 UCLA grad . He admits many of his fellow graduates , though they hold degrees from a competitive school , are underemployed . Rather than committing to a career , Hueg says , &quot; They seem to have spent the last few years just having a good time . School was a lot of fun . But now that they ' re hitting 30 , they ' re beginning to sacrifice their idealism and start dealing with the reality of their careers. &quot; Hueg laments that students fees at the community_college level and tuition at four-year universities are going_up , up , up . &quot; Fees per unit of credit were less than $ 10 . Now they ' re $ 13 , and ( Gov . Pete ) Wilson wants it to go_to $ 20 , &quot; Hueg says . &quot; We may be seeing an end to the professional student -- certainly no one at USC or CSU can afford it. &quot; While community_colleges offer a cheaper opportunity to bide time between high_school and the real_world , four-year universities and graduate_schools also attract the professional student , says Anna Garza , director of the career development center at Chapman University in Orange . &quot; Every time the economy is poor , we see applications to the graduate_school rise , &quot; Garza says . &quot; People don ' t think there are jobs . They are waiting it out until this thing blows over. ' &quot; Garza says many of Chapman ' s 3 # 200 students arrive on campus with a sense of timing , as if their lives were chartered on a narrow course -- bachelor ' s degree by age 22 , graduate_school in two years , then an entry-level position with the right company , marriage , family , et cetera . But , she says , many students are mystified when that first job isn ' t waiting for them as soon as they frame their degree and hang it on the wall . &quot; They ' re not getting jobs right away , and it ' s very stressful , &quot; Garza says . &quot; Parents don ' t understand why it ' s so hard , unless they themselves have been laid off. &quot; Garza says factors such_as the bankruptcy of Orange County may dishearten college_students , who may indeed opt_for more college instead of venturing into an economy they perceive as being depressed . &quot; Many recent grads want to come_back here to work because they see this as a warm , protective environment , &quot; Garza says . Rachel Strong , 23 , of Santa Ana , says : &quot; One of the scariest things is to not go_to school every day . It ' s been my security_blanket for so long. &quot; Strong got her associate ' s degree from Fullerton College and will receive a bachelor ' s in public relations from Chapman University this spring . Her question is not if she should pursue her master ' s degree , but when . &quot; I ' m not in a big hurry to start a family , &quot; says Strong , who married two years ago and just purchased a home with her husband , Robert , an engineer technician for a computer_hardware company . Strong ' s mother was her age when she dropped_out of college to start a family . She never went_back to school , but instead took a job as a cashier with the Automobile Assn . of America , where she has been for 32 years . &quot; I don ' t want to be stuck behind a desk , &quot; says Strong , who dreams of being a public information officer for a police_department . After six years of college , she has had four majors -- beginning with pre-med , she also pursued graphic_arts and something else ( she doesn ' t remember what ) before settling_on public relations . &quot; I may as well keep going , since I ' m in the mode , &quot; Strong says . &quot; But I don ' t want to get too many degrees because I heard the more degrees one has , the harder it is to get a job because employers think then they have to pay you more. &quot; Market researcher Salzman admits well-paying jobs are few and far between , even for those who graduated from the most prestigious universities . &quot; Young people starting_out today know there are no guarantees . They ' ve watched as so many of their parents are laid_off from companies they ' ve worked for for 20 , 30 or 40 years . &quot; I think it ' s important no matter what the climate to get_out there and travel and learn to support oneself , rather than stay in school , &quot; Salzman says . &quot; Personally , I think everyone should spend at least a year as a waitress. &quot;</TEXT>
