   <HEADLINE> CULTURE ; AFTER LE BRAINSTORMING , FRENCH START WAR ON WORDS ; FED UP WITH ' FRANGLAIS , ' PARIS IS IMPOSING PENALTIES FOR NOT USING NATIVE TERMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By day , Prof . Daniel Oster heads a learned team laboring to update the official French dictionary , painstakingly building a final barricade against , among other things , the march of English words and &quot; Franglais &quot; into French . But by night , as Oster digs_into the latest edition of the newspaper Le Monde in his Paris apartment , his 15-year-old daughter frequently exhorts him to &quot; soit cool , Papa . &quot; Be cool , Dad . So what does the professional arbiter and gatekeeper of French do ? &quot; I don ' t punish her , &quot; Oster said , shrugging his shoulders . &quot; She ' s just saying it because the other kids say it . One has to be free to express oneself. &quot; But , he added , &quot; this Franglais , this mixture of English and French , is a completely artificial_language . It ' s made by disc_jockeys , journalists and all sorts of media . When I hear someone speaking that way , I know they ' re just being manipulated. &quot; The French government , for its part , is coolly taking major steps to rid the country of some of these dreaded foreign words . The clear , though unnamed , target is English , especially that language the_French call Americain . For the first time in 19 years , the National Assembly earlier this month approved a new law to protect the_French language . This one is the toughest yet . It will make the use of French obligatory in instruction_manuals , legal contracts , scientific conferences and all advertising . The penalties won ' t be specified until later , but the Culture Ministry has said they will probably include fines of up_to $ 100 per infraction and a six-month jail term and $ 8 # 500 fine for anyone preventing the law from being enforced . The new law probably won ' t change the nature of discourse in the Oster household or on the street , where jeans-wearing French youngsters spice their language with words such_as super ( pronounced soo-PAIR ) , where people in le marketing practice le brainstorming in hopes of hitting le jackpot , and where politicians give le briefing off the record . But it could mean a big change in advertising on billboards , posters , TV and radio , where American slogans have been warmly embraced , especially by companies going_after the youth market . McDonald ' s , purveyor of le fast food , uses the slogan &quot; Say Cheese. &quot; Coca-Cola uses &quot; There ' s Always Coke. &quot; For Pepsi , it ' s &quot; Think Different , Think Pepsi. &quot; Even the new tunnel under the_English Channel ( or , if you prefer , La Manche ) will no longer be Le Shuttle . Instead , it will be La Navette . And Nike , the top sports and fitness company in France , is asking its lawyers whether it will have to change its slogan &quot; Just Do It. &quot; &quot; It won ' t make our life easier , that ' s for_sure , &quot; said Stephan Wahlen , Nike ' s advertising manager in Paris . &quot; We ' ve made a lot of attempts to translate ' Just Do It. ' But it doesn ' t work . If you had a strict translation , it would kill the slogan. &quot; The new law doesn ' t ban all English from advertisements , but it requires advertisers to offer a suitable French translation . &quot; I ' m not sure this is the best way to protect the language , &quot; added Wahlen , who is French . &quot; We have to live with today ' s reality , and today ' s reality is more global than the_French language. &quot; However , Jacques Toubon , the government ' s minister of culture and author of the law , insists it is &quot; not an attack on English . It is an attempt to preserve this language , this irreplaceable capital . If it is not preserved , it will die. &quot; It is also , he added , part of France ' s long and until recently successful effort to assimilate immigrants into one common culture -- to , in_effect , make them French . Let there be no doubt , the_French love their language , and an overwhelming majority believe strongly that it is worth protecting . About 110 million people , 58 million of them in France , speak French as their main language . And 50 million others are fluent . In French schools , students learn to write their mother_tongue properly in countless dictees , in which they take dictation from their teachers . But the learning doesn ' t stop there . Hundreds of thousands of adults tune_in to an annual , nationally televised dictee , a kind of prime-time spelling_bee for grown-ups , to test their spelling , grammar and ear for the language . For 20 years , each government ministry has maintained a &quot; terminology committee , &quot; whose primary purpose is to find French equivalents for English words . The work of those committees led to publication this year of a new Dictionary of Official Terms , which lists 3 # 500 &quot; foreign or improper terms to avoid. &quot; And it helpfully provides French replacements . One no-no is le planning , used even by the_French offices of Berlitz , the language_school . Planification is better , says the tome . E-mail should be messagerie electronique , a drive-in cinema is a cine-parc , and air_bags are les sac gonflables . Fast food should be restauration rapide , and brainstorming is le remue-meninges . User-friendly ? Try convivialite . But , as lexicographer Oster observes : &quot; You can invent words . But whether the_English word will then disappear , you never know. &quot; Walking along the streets of Paris , though , one might wonder whether the battle for French purity already is lost . Many French youths , like young people in the United States , find foreign words appealing and , well , tres cool . And plenty of others think government attempts to protect the language by law are Draconian , at worst , and humorless , at best . As the Sunday Times of London put it recently : &quot; Face it , France , you ' re the shrill nag of Europe. &quot; The new language law and Toubon , its author , have become the butt of many jokes , especially from radio_stations already chafing under another Toubon-inspired law that will require them to devote at least 40 % of their music air time to French songs beginning in 1996 . A French radio commentator , reporting from the Cannes Film Festival last month , helpfully translated the name of the president of the festival jury for his listeners . that ' s how Clint Eastwood became Clint &quot; Bois de l ' Est. &quot; And some disc_jockeys have begun referring to Toubon as &quot; Monsieur All Good &quot; -- his last_name roughly translated into English . One might expect Le Figaro , a government-supporting newspaper , to be kinder . But in a front-page editorial cartoon on the anniversary of D-day , the newspaper showed an American soldier trying to woo a young Frenchwoman , circa 1944 . As the soldier vainly attempted a greeting in French , she interrupted him : &quot; Don ' t be afraid . You can say , ' Hello , baby. ' Jacques Toubon is still only 3 years old ! &quot; In his defense , Toubon says the newspapers don ' t represent the_French silent majority , which he believes supports the law . Whatever they think_of the new law , though , the_French long ago turned debates over their language into a kind of national sport . A 2-year-old group calling itself the Assn . for the Respect of the_French Language has 500 volunteer observers who monitor television , radio , newspapers and magazines for signs of bad French . When they spot an error in usage , the observers fill_out a form and send it to the association , which in most cases forwards a letter to the offender . Earlier this month , during commemorations marking the D-day anniversary , French President Francois Mitterrand was overheard uttering , &quot; OK , let ' s go , &quot; to President Clinton . Le Monde , partly tongue in cheek , suggested the phrase was &quot; sacrilege to the Francophone cause. &quot; The final word on the_French language is determined by the Academie Francaise , a Left_Bank institution founded in 1635 with the sole purpose of raising French to the status of Latin and Greek . The ninth edition of the academy ' s dictionary , which will replace the 1935 edition , is now being created by Oster ' s team . So far , only one volume has been published , from &quot; A &quot; to enzyme , and the academy has finished work_up to filon ( a noun borrowed from Italian that means a vein of minerals ) . Oster said &quot; it ' s not at all impossible &quot; that the dictionary could be completed by the turn_of_the_century . Ironically , the dictionary lists many English words that the academy has decided have become part of the_French language . Among them are best-seller , blazer , blue_jean and cowboy . But just because French_people may use an English word doesn ' t make_it acceptable , Oster said . His rule_of_thumb is that an English word can become part of the_French language only &quot; if it designates something that is not in French. &quot; that ' s why , he said , &quot; cool is not in the dictionary . It will never be in the dictionary . There are at least 20 French words that describe the same thing. &quot; The problem , as Oster sees it , is not that young people use words like cool . He doesn ' t even mind the use of English in newspapers and magazines , just as long as the word is set_apart from good French by quotation_marks . But Oster and many in the government fear that Franglais is creating confusion among young people , who need to be_better educated in proper French and English usage . &quot; When my daughter has to write an essay in French , she knows she can ' t use the word cool , &quot; Oster said . &quot; But what about the kid who doesn ' t have the knowledge ? If we don ' t tell him , he ' ll never know . And what will happen then ? &quot; But can a country really legislate the use of a language ? &quot; We can , and it ' s our firm intention to do so , &quot; Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur said . &quot; The French language is an essential component of our identity and also a major factor_in the unity of our country. &quot; However , Balladur added in a recent interview : &quot; One has to have an open mind about this . Words like le weekend are part of the_French language now . But you shouldn ' t overdo it . When the precise French word exists , there ' s no point in not using it. &quot;</TEXT>
