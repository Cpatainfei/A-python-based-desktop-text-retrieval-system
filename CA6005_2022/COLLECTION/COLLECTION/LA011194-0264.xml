   <HEADLINE> THE MYSTERY OF MEMORY ; WHY DO WE REMEMBER USELESS THINGS FOREVER WHILE IMPORTANT ONES VANISH ? NEW RESEARCH OFFERS SOME CLUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You can recall everything that happened during prom night , but you can ' t remember where you left your keys last night . You check your watch . Fifteen seconds later , you can ' t remember the time . The image of Grandma ' s cute little white_house is vivid in your memory -- until you find a snapshot that shows it was yellow . And just when you figure your memory is shot , you recall with ease where you put the lawn rake three years ago . Human memory is a bewildering marvel , capable of miraculous feats and frustrating failures . But now , after what UC Irvine professor Gary Lynch calls &quot; a bona_fide scientific revolution over the last 10 years , &quot; brain researchers are beginning to understand some of memory ' s most basic workings . Lynch , a psychobiologist at UCI ' s Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory , is among the world ' s leading brain scientists . He and colleagues have discovered what they believe is the process by which memory is stored in the brain , and they have devised an experimental drug , Ampakine , which they say increases learning speed and retention in rats . The university has licensed an Irvine pharmaceuticals firm to develop Ampakine as a possible prescription_drug , hoping it will increase memory in mild cases of dementia , stroke and Alzheimer ' s disease . So far , its effect in people is untested . But this is only the latest development in brain research , Lynch says . A decade of discoveries now allows science to describe &quot; with some degree of confidence things that would have sounded like science_fiction 10 years ago . What we know now compared to just five years ago is incredible. &quot; Why is it you can remember the prom but not where you put your keys ? You are using two physically separate kinds of memory , Lynch says . The prom is engraved in your &quot; episodic_memory , &quot; a very powerful system for preserving the rich details of events . The hormones released when you feel strong emotions intensifies these memories , and your hormones really pumped on prom night . But the location of your keys was recorded in your &quot; scratch-pad memory , &quot; which is separate and notable for two qualities : You can ' t store much information there , and the information evaporates quickly , usually within a_few hours . This also explains why you don ' t remember the time only seconds after looking_at your watch . As soon as the need for the information is gone , scratch-pad memory tosses it overboard . But how could the memory of Grandma ' s white_house be so vivid yet so wrong ? Lynch says it is not known exactly how this happens . There is evidence that new memories can partially override old ones , so seeing a white_house similar to Grandma ' s yellow one might unconsciously tint the original memory . It is also known that newly formed memories are , like unset concrete , vulnerable for a_few hours . During that time , the brain can send a code that erases the new memory . All this is more important than most people realize , Lynch says . Most people think_of memory only as remembering to pick_up milk on the way home . In reality , you use memory constantly . You leave work and recognize your car among the hundreds in the parking_lot . You remember how to open the door , how to start the engine , how to drive_home . You hear a song on the radio and remember the emotions you felt when you first heard it . You see a red_light and unconsciously remember that you ' re supposed to stop . &quot; Memory is the device that organizes the world for you , &quot; Lynch says . &quot; Whatever you encounter , you will relate it to something in your experience -- that is , to something you remember . You have to , because your brain ' s just built that way. &quot; The brain is an unimaginable jumble of electrical_circuits . Each of 10 billion brain_cells connects with 50 # 000 others . One square millimeter of cortex , the crinkly surfaced dome of the brain , contains 80 # 000 brain_cells , making the cortex the most complex electronic circuit_board on Earth . This means the brain ' s memory storage capacity is effectively unlimited . You ' d need many_more than one lifetime to fill it up . The brain can manage such an immense cargo of memories because it breaks the process into smaller jobs . What seems to you to be a single continuous action of remembering is actually many actions occurring in quick , seamless succession . At the most basic level , the brain stores each memory in its own network of brain_cells by changing how those cells behave . An electrical &quot; learning code &quot; is sent telling each cell to remember whatever immediately follows , such_as the impulses from hearing a sound . The cells record by turning themselves into more sensitive receivers . Now the cells have hair_triggers , and when the brain goes looking_for this memory , the network where it ' s stored is much more likely to respond strongly . The process is pure cause and effect -- first comes the code , then the information to be remembered -- and the process depends_on a sense of time . Code pulses spaced too closely or too far apart will fail to turn_on the memory apparatus . Lynch suggests that this is the basic reason we have a sense of cause and effect , that we recognize ( or imagine ) that two things happening at different times can be related . &quot; This is why when a door slams and the light goes_out , you instantly assume the slam shut_off the light . It ' s inescapable , because it ' s built right into our brain organization. &quot; Time has other effects on memory . Say ought , toe and mobile , and they ' re recognized as three words . But the same sounds without pauses are recognized as one word . Show your baby a teddy_bear and he or she will remember the visual_image . Say teddy at_the_same_time and the word association is recorded as well . Then the sound teddy will summon up a visual memory of the teddy_bear , a phenomenon Lynch believes is unique to human_beings . On the next level of memory , the brain is organizing memories according to physical similarities . Lynch says the design of brain circuits causes this to happen automatically , unconsciously and irresistibly . The process produces &quot; phenomenally good categories , &quot; much better than categories we could consciously devise , he says . Until recently , brain scientists did not know this categorizing process was occurring , yet people use memory categories constantly , Lynch says . Example : A friend asks , &quot; What ' s that on the limb ? &quot; You look , see an adolescent male English_sparrow with a band around one leg and an insect in its beak , and you say , &quot; It ' s a bird. &quot; Why are you withholding all that extra information ? Because at first glance , the brain goes only to the category it has made_for such objects , Lynch says . The brain goes_deeper for detail as a second step when detail is needed . This makes more sense than you might think , Lynch says . &quot; It ' s an excellent survival technique . You walk_out in the street and you see an object coming at you on four wheels with someone sitting in it . You ' ve never seen this specific object before , but you instantly know it ' s a car . You don ' t stand there and say , ' I believe that ' s a ' 37 Ford . Or perhaps a Chevy. ' You know it ' s a car and you get_out of the way. &quot; Yet consciously trying to define a car category , for example , is difficult , Lynch says . Try it , then see whether it would exclude a bus , a truck , a golf_cart and a wheelchair . Yet such a sophisticated category was created in your brain , by your brain , without you realizing it . Not only is the human brain capable of forming these categories , it cannot avoid doing so , Lynch says . Every encounter with something new requires the brain to fit it into an existing memory category . You can experience this process any time you want . Stare at fleecy clouds or into a cottage-cheese ceiling , and soon your mind perceives images forming among the random patterns . Your brain is trying to organize the information from your eyes into something that will fit into one of your memory categories . At the next higher level of memory , the cortex reaches outside itself to add emotional and muscular power to memory . All parts of the cortex have electrical connections to other parts of the brain , but there are immense trunk_lines running to specific regions . One destination is the amygdala , which controls emotion . It doesn ' t matter what you ' re doing , smelling , seeing or thinking , if we stimulate one part of your amygdala , you ' ll feel angry . Stimulate another and you ' ll feel happy or sad or hungry or lustful . The emotional effects of memory are stored here . Whenever you recognize or recall something , your cortex checks with the amygdala , which sets_off whatever emotion has been earmarked for that memory or category , Lynch says . This is the reason string_quartets might make you cry and movie_theaters might make you hungry . Other connections reach a region known as the striatum , where we organize our movements . Here recognition can bring fast action . When someone yells &quot; Duck ! &quot; the striatum remembers what you ' re supposed to do and it makes you duck before you can think . So far , &quot; We ' re talking_about circuitry that ' s universal to mammals . It ' s just as well developed in a rat ' s brain as in yours , &quot; Lynch says . But a third region , the hippocampus , is much more developed in human_beings . &quot; You don ' t want to lose your hippocampus , and tragically enough , it ' s probably the most vulnerable part of your brain , &quot; Lynch says . &quot; You have a heart_attack , a stroke , and you can wipe it out . Then you can ' t form any new memories -- or very few . &quot; Actually , you could learn to ride a bicycle , but you ' d never remember where you put it . We still don ' t know why the hippocampus does that. &quot; But Lynch has published a hypothesis that the hippocampus adds additional kinds of memory seemingly needed to form ordinary memories in the cortex . The first , which he calls &quot; recency memory , &quot; records the passage of time . &quot; You run_into someone , it ' s Charlie , and you say , ' Hey , Charlie , haven ' t seen you in years. ' What happened was you recognized this person to be Charlie and then you checked the hippocampus to see how long it ' s been since you saw him . that ' s a powerful effect , and you know it immediately. &quot; The second powerful effect is knowledge of whether you ' ve already been here and already done this . This is the scratch-pad memory at_work , recording , for a short while only , routine matters that you ' re not going_to want to remember tomorrow : &quot; Where did I park my car ? &quot; &quot; Have I already checked the mail ? &quot; &quot; What ' s the phone_number I just looked_up ? &quot; &quot; This is a very imperfect device , and it may be because its memory is actually meant to be thrown_away . The trick is to stay_away_from it when you need long-term_memory , &quot; Lynch says . People who never forget where they put their keys are using tricks , consciously or unconsciously , such_as always putting them in the same place , Lynch says . They depend_on remembering a procedure , a ritual , which is a different , very stable form of memory outside the hippocampus . The hippocampus ' third powerful effect is expectation or anticipation -- memory of what the proper sequence of events should be . You meet Charlie and you say you haven ' t seen him in years . If instead of returning your greeting Charlie starts tap-dancing and yodeling , you will immediately know something ' s screwy . &quot; You instantly detect this prior to making any intellectual judgments or analysis , &quot; Lynch says . &quot; You instantly have a sense that something ' s wrong , and it ' s full_stop , freeze , back_up and what ' s going_on ? &quot; The reaction is unavoidable , Lynch says . If you open your refrigerator and see piles of cash instead of food , your first reaction will be wariness , not joy . &quot; We are now going much deeper into the land of hypothesis , &quot; Lynch says . &quot; Now we ' re into an area that is a little embarrassing for us brain scientists , because what I ' m telling you is this : We don ' t have much of an idea at all about what ' s going_on in 85 % of your brain. &quot; The vast majority of the cells in the cortex do not connect to anything outside , Lynch says . &quot; This seems insane . Where ' s all_the real-world stuff -- information from the eyes and the ears ? that ' s still going_to small parts of the cortex , but the rest of the cortex is just hooked_up to itself . It ' s like a huge city where none of the streets leads to the outside. &quot; At the front of the cortex is an area involved in coordinating physical movement , from climbing a tree to speaking a language . This area must remember incredibly complicated instructions to accomplish these tasks . At the back of the cortex are individual areas involved with vision , smell , sound and other perception . Connections allow these two areas to talk to one another and to form associations . Consequently , hearing the word dog can summon up a mental_picture of a dog , and you can scan it as you would a picture . These connections allowed Beethoven , even though he was deaf , to compose music by remembering the sounds of notes and instruments . Lynch says no other mammal has anywhere near as_many front-to-back connections . In a person , they are gathered_in immense bundles , trunk_lines &quot; as big around as your finger , &quot; Lynch says . He guesses that communication along these trunk_lines was the ultimate evolution of the human brain . Once this link existed , the complicated programs at the front that had been controlling movement could now communicate with the huge store of memories at the rear . The brain no longer needed the eyes to create vision . The memory of images could be coordinated in the same way . You could experience a walk to the store entirely within your imagination , arranging memories of what you saw , smelled , felt and heard on previous trips . There could be language , because the memory of word sounds stored at the back could be arranged into phrases and sentences by programs at the front . There could be foresight and planning , because remembered images , stored at the back , could be arranged into sequences , allowing the brain to preview actions . This is what high divers are doing when they seemingly go_into a trance just before their dives . This is what novelists are doing as they devise a plot . &quot; I suspect it was the growth of this front-to-back thing that led to what we experience as thinking , &quot; Lynch says . &quot; You took those motor programs meant to help you climb trees , but you used it to organize the memory of climbing trees . You turned it inward . Of course , once this thing is clocking along , it never needs to do anything . It can go_on forever . &quot; And here ' s the irony to this argument . You tell me something , and I say to you , ' What are the rules_of_grammar you just used ? I mean , you just used them . You changed the pronunciation of this word because it followed that word , you had this sequence , you used this exception -- what did you experience as you were doing_it ? ' &quot; You ' d have to sit_down and think , but all you can do is analyze it . Because you didn ' t actually experience anything . You just did_it . &quot; So why are we so screwed_up ? Because in_order to think , we run these programs , but our consciousness has no access to those programs . They ' re organizing your memory and coordinating your thinking , but you have no conscious access to them. &quot; Memory at Its Most Basic Level A . Eye : Sees object and sends electrical impulses to brain . B . Visual cortex : On surface of the brain . Receives impulses , sends them to be recognized or recorded . C . Neocortex : Surface of the brain . Stores most memories . At 10 billion brain_cells , the capacity is so large you can ' t fill it in a lifetime . D . Amygdala : Inside the brain . Adds emotional meaning to memories , how you react to spiders or kittens . E . Hippocampus : Inside the brain . Remembers time ( &quot; I haven ' t seen you in years &quot; ) , recognizes incongruities ( &quot; There ' s something different about you &quot; ) and temporarily remembers routine details ( &quot; We parked in the third row &quot; ) . F . Striatum : Inside the brain . Remembers whether action is required , such_as the necessity to duck away from a bee . * To store one memory , the brain sets_aside a network of thousands of brain_cells , called neurons . Above , how simple memory works . Below , how neurons communicate electrically : 1 ) Above , a sending neuron transmits a voltage along its axon to the dendrites of the receiving neuron . 2 ) The gap , or synapse , between sending and receiving neurons , is so small it can be seen only with an electron_microscope . Electrical impulses are sent by squirting a chemical called a neurotransmitter across the synapse . 3 ) If enough neurotransmitter sticks_to the receptor , the receptor opens . Brain fluid and its sodium ions flow through the channel . When enough ions enter through enough receptors , the receiving neuron fires its electrical impulse to another neuron down the network . This occurs throughout the memory network , recalling the memory as quickly as one-fifth of a second . Getting a Quick Reaction The memory system is so finely tuned that sensing an object , sound or circumstance can make you move faster than you can think . 1 ) You see a multicolored , long coiled object . 2 ) Visual cortex queries the neocortex ( &quot; Have you seen anything like this ? &quot; ) and the neocortex replies ( &quot; It looks_like a snake &quot; ) . 3 ) Hippocampus remembers a snake isn ' t normally there . 4 ) Amygdala remembers you hate snakes and switches_on fear . 5 ) Striatum remembers that when startled by a snake , you are supposed to jump back . This message is relayed to your muscles , and you jump . Sources : Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory , UC Irvine ; Researched by STEVE EMMONS / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
