   <HEADLINE> MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ : WILL ' LION ' BAMM BAMM ' FLINTSTONES ' ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fred Flintstone has a lion on his tail . For months , the world ' s most famous caveman has been prepackaged as the summer ' s movie and merchandising hit in the upcoming Universal Pictures film , &quot; The Flintstones. &quot; But there are rumblings from the licensing world that &quot; The Lion King , &quot; an animated Disney film about a lion_cub that becomes king , could give &quot; Flintstones &quot; a rumble in the merchandising jungle . It all comes_down to this : Will kids be more enamored by a product like the Fred Flintstone doll that -- when squeezed -- shouts a raucous &quot; Yabba dabba do ! &quot; Or will they be more enchanted with a plush lion_cub from &quot; Lion King &quot; that -- when petted -- utters a regal roar . &quot; Consumers only have so_much money to buy licensed merchandise , &quot; said Karen Raugust , editor of the Licensing Letter . She expects merchandise sales from one of the films to &quot; rise to the top at the expense of the other. &quot; Because much of the Flintstone merchandise is linked to the live-action film instead of the animated cartoon show , the Flintstone merchandise is &quot; a little bit riskier , &quot; she said . At stake are millions -- and perhaps billions -- of dollars in merchandise sales . Executives at MCA / Universal Merchandising say their goal is for Flintstone merchandise -- from key chains to satin jackets -- to surpass the $ 1 billion in product sales already registered by their recent merchandising hit &quot; Jurassic Park. &quot; Disney executives declined to comment about &quot; Lion King &quot; product sales , but experts say sales could match -- or surpass -- the estimated $ 1 billion that Disney has taken_in for such films as &quot; Little Mermaid &quot; and &quot; Beauty and the Beast. &quot; While &quot; Flintstones &quot; has more_than 100 licensees compared to fewer than 50 for &quot; Lion King , &quot; Raugust said &quot; Lion King &quot; has one important thing in its favor : Disney ' s track record in merchandising its animated films . Of course , Steven Spielberg ' s Amblin Entertainment , which is producing &quot; Flintstones , &quot; also has a long line of merchandising successes . But most kids love cartoons , so products attached_to animated films , such_as &quot; Lion King &quot; often outsell those linked to live-action films , say licensing executives . Sure , there are notable exceptions -- &quot; E.T. &quot; and &quot; Batman , &quot; for instance -- but live-action films such_as &quot; Dick Tracy &quot; and &quot; Popeye &quot; failed to move much product . And while &quot; The Flintstones &quot; is generally expected to be a box_office smash , some question whether that will automatically translate into massive merchandise sales . &quot; I ' m very concerned about Flintstone merchandise , &quot; said Lee Weinblatt , president of the marketing research firm Pretesting Co . &quot; People who favor the Flintstones are mostly older . But do Mom and Dad really want a set of Flintstone place_mats ? &quot; Most of the merchandise from the Flintstone film will look_like the characters from the movie -- and not the cartoon series . Some marketing experts say kids in particular would probably rather have the real Fred Flintstone ' s face on their T-shirt than that of John Goodman -- co-star of the TV_show &quot; Roseanne &quot; -- who plays Fred Flintstone in the upcoming film . &quot; My gut feeling is , John Goodman ' s picture should not be_on the merchandise , &quot; said Harry Clark Noyes , president of the marketing research firm Psychological Motivation . &quot; The movie is soon gone , but the character Fred Flintstone will be around long after that . Besides , not many people are going_to the film to see John Goodman . They are going_to see Fred Flintstone. &quot; But executives at MCA insist Goodman ' s face will make the Flintstone merchandise especially popular . &quot; This is the role John Goodman was born to play , &quot; said Linda Berkeley , senior_vice_president of MCA / Universal Merchandising . &quot; People will see the movie and want to take some of the fun home with them &quot; in the form of merchandise , she said . * If &quot; The Flintstones &quot; has one thing in its favor , it ' s timing . The film opens nationwide May 27 , several weeks before the June 15 premiere of Disney ' s &quot; Lion King. &quot; Two of Southern California ' s largest makers of plush toys and plastic figurines have very different opinions about which film will sell the most merchandise . &quot; I guarantee you , at the retail level this will be the biggest Disney feature of them all , &quot; said Melvin Grossman , chairman of Aurora Hills-based Applause Inc. , which is making merchandise tied to &quot; Lion King. &quot; &quot; Based on orders from retailers , we recently doubled production , &quot; said Grossman . But Bob Solomon , chairman of Woodland Hills-based Dakin Inc. , said he thinks the appeal of &quot; Lion King &quot; is limited to &quot; a very young audience. &quot; So his firm will instead make Flintstone products , which he says will appeal_to people of all ages . Fast-food giants McDonald ' s and Burger King have picked their favorites too . McDonald ' s is betting_on Flintstones with its first-ever worldwide promotion , including Flintstone &quot; Happy Meals &quot; for kids and collector glasses for grown-ups . Burger King is putting its money on &quot; Lion King , &quot; with promotions from &quot; Lion King &quot; kids ' meals to &quot; King-sized &quot; meals targeting adults . Instead of picking sides , some major merchandisers are convinced both will win big . Mattel , for example , is making toy lines tied to both films . &quot; It ' s not like you can point to one film and say , that ' s the one that will come_out on top , &quot; said Jill Barad , president of Mattel Inc. Mattel expects to post combined toy sales exceeding $ 100 million from the two movies , she said . Likewise , Gibson Greetings , a Cincinnati maker of greeting cards and party goods , will make products -- including cards , wrapping paper and paper napkins -- linked to both films . Which will sell better ? &quot; That all depends_on which movie does better at the box_office , &quot; said Steve Kosmalski , senior_vice_president at Gibson . &quot; But longer life spans go_with animated films . They have a longer-lasting sentimentality . Just ask Mickey Mouse. &quot; Briefly . . . The Brentwood agency Stein Robaire Helm has picked_up the estimated $ 1-million ad business for JBL Professional , the Van Nuys speaker maker . . . . Ikea , the Swedish furniture retailer , has begun to air a TV spot featuring a gay couple talking_about a dining_room table they bought_at an Ikea store . . . . Irvine-based Hot ' n Now , a concept being tested by Taco Bell , has placed its estimated $ 3-million ad account at the Costa Mesa agency Bozell / Salvati Montgomery Sakoda . . . . Orkin Exterminating has a new ad_campaign featuring a female exterminator . Up to 70 % of calls to Orkin are made by women .</TEXT>
