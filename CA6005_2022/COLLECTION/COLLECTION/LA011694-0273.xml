   <HEADLINE> HISTORY BRANCHES_OUT WITH PLAN FOR CONEJO TREES ; LANDMARKS : EFFORT SEEKS TO PUBLICIZE THE MOST MAGNIFICENT SPECIMENS , SUCH AS NEWBURY PARK ' S 300-YEAR-OLD SYCAMORE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For a tree , the Hunt olive has a pretty bad rap . Some local history buffs believe the 200-year-old tree at Lynn Road and Hillcrest Drive once served as a gallows , with a hangman ' s noose dangling from its broad boughs . Others believe it marks the spot where a mythical Mr. Hunt took a fatal tumble off his horse as he galloped across the Conejo Valley . Whatever the truth , Bryan Badgett thinks people should know that the Hunt olive has a history much , much older than the city of Thousand Oaks . Picking_up a concept that former city Arts Commissioner Cate Brown proposed several years ago , Badgett is launching a program called Designation of Patriarch Trees . The goal is to identify , map and publicize the Conejo Valley ' s most magnificent trees . &quot; Thousand Oaks has been one of the leaders in protecting oak_trees , but I want to take it one step further , &quot; said Badgett , a landscape_architect and city arts commissioner . &quot; There are a lot of other beautiful trees here worthy of protection. &quot; For instance , there ' s the 300-year-old sycamore on the grounds of Newbury Park ' s Stagecoach Inn . Designated a historical landmark , the tree is famous for one knobby branch that points directly to a brook . Legend has it that when Native_Americans stumbled across the stream centuries ago , they bent the tree ' s bough into a right_angle to signal the presence of water . Just a_few miles from the Stagecoach Inn , another group of sycamores has earned its place in local lore . To preserve the sycamores , which line Hillcrest Drive between Lynn and Ventu Park roads , the Thousand Oaks City_Council had to approve an expensive engineering trick . Instead of paving over the sycamores ' extensive roots -- which might have killed the centuries-old trees -- the city ' s Public Works Department agreed to build Hillcrest Drive about 30 feet above ground_level . Elevating the road left the trees unscathed . And the engineering feat has held_up over time -- the sycamores are thriving , drawing nutrients from an aquifer three stories below the pavement . The Hunt olive_tree wasn ' t so lucky . Circuit City ' s builder could not construct the electronics store around the huge tree , so crews excavated its massive bulk and moved it to the corner of the property . The transplanting , conducted with city approval , was a success and the olive_tree is now flourishing . Other trees have also earned special treatment from Thousand Oaks ' Public Works Department . Hodencamp Road swerves suddenly between Hillcrest Drive and Thousand Oaks Boulevard , for instance , simply to save a stately oak_tree that now stands_in the median . &quot; We have some truly significant trees here , &quot; Councilwoman Judy Lazar said . Badgett and Brown agree wholeheartedly . And they want to spread the word . &quot; All too often our eyes stay_at eye level when we ' re walking , &quot; Brown said . &quot; We never look_at the trees overhead . This program would help people be aware of some of the beautiful trees we have here. &quot; Although she named the program Designation of Patriarch Trees , Brown said she won ' t insist that the trees be identified as father figures . &quot; Patriarch , matriarch , call them whatever you want , &quot; she said . &quot; Just save them. &quot; Once they have identified the most important specimens , Brown and Badgett hope to put_up plaques describing each tree ' s history . They would also like to print a brochure outlining walking tours of Thousand Oaks ' best-looking trees . &quot; School kids can learn that there is age , there is history to this city , &quot; Badgett said . &quot; A lot of kids think trees are always here . We can tell them , ' Hey , these trees have historical value , so let ' s keep them around. ' &quot; The Designation of Patriarch Trees project would supplement efforts by the Ventura County Cultural Heritage Board , which is responsible_for identifying the region ' s most historically significant trees . In the past three decades , the board has designated only 10 trees as historical landmarks , including the Hunt olive , the Stagecoach Inn sycamore and , most recently , the C Street palms in Oxnard . &quot; Trees have to have some age and historical significance for us to recognize them , &quot; said Madeline Miedema , chairwoman of the Cultural Heritage Board . &quot; It seems to me that the ( Thousand Oaks ) program is a worthy project because it could help preserve more of the beautiful trees. &quot;</TEXT>
