   <HEADLINE> DEFENSE CHIEF SEES LITTLE AIR STRIKE RISK ; BALKANS : PERRY IS CONFIDENT THAT SERBIAN WEAPONS POSE ONLY A MINIMAL THREAT TO AMERICAN_PLANES . BOSNIAN SERBS RESUME TURNING IN THEIR BIG GUNS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the United States prepares to take_part in possible air strikes over Bosnia-Herzegovina , Secretary_of_Defense William J . Perry asserted Sunday that &quot; the risks will be minimal &quot; that any American warplane would be shot_down or any pilot taken prisoner . &quot; We ' ve had airplanes flying air cover over Bosnia for some time now , &quot; Perry said in an ABC television interview . &quot; . . . We have a very high-performance aircraft , the best in the world , over there , and there is a minimal air-defense system that we ' re going against. &quot; Perry ' s confidence was echoed by Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , who said in a separate TV interview on NBC ' s &quot; Meet the Press &quot; that &quot; we ' re not talking_about the ( former ) Soviet ( Union ) . We ' re talking_about the Serbs. &quot; The United States is planning to participate in the air strikes as part of a NATO operation that could begin one week from today if the guns around Sarajevo are not pulled_back to at least 12 miles from the city ' s downtown area . A shaky truce prevailed in Sarajevo on Sunday and Bosnian Serbs besieging the city resumed turning_in some of their big guns , the Associated Press reported . The U.S. Embassy spent the day packing the families of 35 diplomats out of Belgrade , capital_of_Yugoslavia . Dutch , British and German officials also have urged their citizens to leave the country . The evacuation of dependents was a precaution against Serbian reprisals in the event of air strikes . Many in the Serb-dominated Yugoslav government and army support the Bosnian Serbs . Perry , appearing on &quot; This Week With David Brinkley &quot; in his first television interview as defense_secretary , described in detail what would happen to Bosnian Serb artillery if it tried to fire during any NATO air strike . &quot; First of all , if the shells come_in , we can deploy artillery-locating radars which will backtrack the position of the guns , &quot; he said . &quot; And , secondly , the air-strike aircraft we have are the most modern and the most precise in the world and with the best sensors . &quot; . . . From the time of the impact ( of the artillery on the ground ) , it ' s a matter of seconds to get the information , the coordinates , to an airplane . Then it ' s a question of where is the airplane relative to the gun ? . . . We are maintaining continuous air cover . So if an airplane is near that area , it can be there in a matter of a minute or two . . . . &quot; No military operation is without risk , &quot; Perry acknowledged . &quot; . . . But the risks , I believe , are minimal in this operation. &quot; If the first air strikes didn ' t work , the defense_secretary said , the Clinton_Administration would consider other military options , including increasing the intensity of air strikes and extending them to areas beyond Sarajevo . Perry emphasized , &quot; We are not looking_at options which involve the commitment of U.S. ground forces to the area. &quot; However , the United States has pledged to provide thousands of peacekeeping troops to help enforce any peace plan agreed to by all warring parties . The Associated Press reported from Sarajevo that U.N. officials over the weekend accepted a compromise plan under which the Bosnian Serbs besieging the city will be allowed to turn_in their heavy_weapons at U.N.-monitored Serbian bases , rather than at the Sarajevo airport as originally planned . The Bosnian army objected . &quot; Those weapons can be returned to combat positions very fast , &quot; Bosnian Gen . Fikret Muslimovic said . &quot; I am afraid that such an approach and an attempt to appease the aggression further would bring a hardening of the Serbian position , &quot; said Haris Silajdzic , the Bosnian prime_minister . The Bosnian Serbs had earlier insisted that they would surrender their guns only if the Muslim-dominated government ' s infantry abandoned its front-line positions . But after heavy lobbying by U.N. officials , the Serbs turned_over 13 heavy_weapons on Sunday , bringing the total to 36 guns : 26 Serbian and 10 Muslim . The Bosnian Serbs are believed to have at least 500 heavy_weapons . The Bosnian army has perhaps a tenth that number . Also Sunday , U.N. officials in Sarajevo made statements suggesting that the NATO deadline for lifting the siege of Sarajevo is not set_in stone , according to a report in the Washington Post . The officials said they told Bosnian Serbs that they were not necessarily concerned that some Serbian guns might remain pointing at the capital after the Feb . 21 deadline . The officials argued that altering terms of the ultimatum is part of the process of lifting the siege by peaceful means . But U.S. and NATO officials have remained adamant about enforcing the ultimatum . In Zagreb on Sunday , U.S. Adm . Jeremy Boorda , NATO ' s southern flank commander , met with Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , commander of U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia , and Yasushi Akashi , special U.N. representative in the former Yugoslav federation , to coordinate action , the Associated Press said . U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has given Akashi the authority to order air strikes . Rose will report on whether Bosnian Serb guns still threaten Sarajevo . Boorda commands the planes that would carry_out any bombing .</TEXT>
