   <HEADLINE> ISSUE OF UNIVERSAL ACCESS SPLITS READERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last week , The Cutting Edge asked_for readers ' thoughts on whether universal access to communications services -- a staple of national communications policy for many decades -- can or should be preserved in an age when competition and new technology are changing the cost structure of basic telephone and television services and making many new services available . Should emerging telecommunications providers give subsidies to low-income consumers , or can the free market be counted_on to make these services available to all ? How should such subsidies be provided ? Should the principle of universal service be extended_to new electronic_information_services , and if so , by what mechanism ? The mail was almost evenly divided between those who favor some kind of support for universal service and those who are opposed . Many respondents singled_out the public_libraries as a logical avenue for providing broad access to electronic_information_services . Below is a sampling of the responses . * Historically , universal service has been defined as minimal , or &quot; lifeline , &quot; service . It has never implied full access to the broad spectrum of available services . It seems inappropriate to isolate the challenge of universal service as it applies to electronic_information_services when non-electronic information services such_as newspapers , books and magazines are not offered to individuals under any type of universal access policy . Perhaps , as public_libraries and schools provide a tax-driven method of accessing non-electronic information at no cost to the end_user , they must take it upon themselves to offer a no-cost method of accessing electronic information . To subsidize access to electronic_information_services on an individual basis is inconsistent with the public policies regarding non-electronic information already in place . JONATHAN STRUM Valencia * Universal service benefits the very young and the very old . Television is the American baby-sitter and the nation ' s companion for the elderly . Telephones are the lifeline of the aged and the comline of teen-agers . Subsidies to provide universal telecommunications service will allow entry of creative ( if penniless ) youngsters and tap the information wellspring of the mature . ANET K . DUNNE West Los Angeles * I am very much opposed to passing the cost of services for the poor along to the rest of the users in the form of higher rates . The true effect of that would be to separate a group of people from access because they are not &quot; poor &quot; enough to qualify for subsidies and not &quot; well off &quot; enough to shoulder someone else ' s bill in addition to their own . If there truly is a need to assist the low-income people in this area , it should come_out of the general tax rolls to which everyone pays a proportion relative to their means . DAVID DOBBS Burbank * The benefits of furnishing universal service far outweigh the costs to all_of us since empowerment of our citizens in our democratic society is vital for its survival . All of us should be willing to share whatever resources we can to enable a general format accessible to every American and possibly all world citizens . ROBERT BLEVITT Los Osos * Subsidies are killing our countries in more ways than one . To provide basic necessities like food , education and shelter is certainly one of my moral imperatives -- subsidized access to electronic info services is not . Why work hard and save money to afford high-tech goodies if the government ( i.e. , taxpayers ) are going_to give them to you anyway ? JOHN ZARCHEN Hollywood * &quot; Can Universal Service Be Preserved in Information Age ? &quot; Yes , it must be or the divide between haves and have-nots will be even more extreme . However , the free market is not likely to help . Even tax_credits would probably not be enough . Possibly a tax on each item ( hardware , software both ) could bring income enough for subsidies . The public_libraries as well as schools must be involved in providing the how-to for the computer illiterate of all ages . LAURA DENNISON Bakersfield * It is obvious that we must guarantee universal access to the information superhighway to everyone regardless of means . We will soon have access to over 500 channels of cable service which will bring us much closer to the universally cherished goal of having reruns of &quot; Gilligan ' s Island , &quot; &quot; The Love Boat &quot; and &quot; I Love Lucy &quot; running 24 hours a day . Who can really say they understand American culture and society unless they ' ve seen every episode of Gilligan ' s Island ? Of course , the Internet will play an increasing role in our lives . Profound discussions are going_on right now in areas such_as alt.sex.bestiality , alt.barney.die.die.die and the numerous Star Trek discussions that permeate the Internet . With other problems , such_as national , state , local and personal debt , crime , the coming bankruptcy of Medicare and Social_Security , drug_addiction , homelessness , crumbling of the family . . . devastation of our inner_cities , etc . -- obviously less important than providing universal access to the information superhighway -- we should focus our resources on that . After all , if the people of our nation are properly entertained , they may_not notice the other problems . MICHAL TODOROVIC Ventura * With the proliferation of new technology and the deregulation of the telecommunications industry , it will be impossible to guarantee universal access . Any attempt at forcing companies to subsidize services will impede the speed of products getting_to the marketplace and will create larger bureaucracies to administer the new laws . Increased competition , not government interference , will lower the prices and open the access to underserved areas . The market is the answer . GEORGE DAVIS Ladera Heights * If the ensuing information age is as revolutionary as suggested , then it is imperative that if I have access , than so should my neighbor , and my neighbor ' s neighbor , etc . There is already too great a gap between the haves and the have-nots without the information age . We cannot allow it to widen . It is the responsibility of the John Malones of the world -- acting_as humans if not businessmen -- to ensure such access . And if they do not have it in their ethical standards , then let the government step_in and demand it . NEAL WEISS Los Angeles</TEXT>
