   <HEADLINE> MOROCCO BECOMES 2ND ARAB NATION TO HAVE FORMAL RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL ; DIPLOMACY : TWENTY YEARS OF CONTACTS CULMINATE IN AGREEMENT ON LOW-LEVEL TIES WITH LIAISON OFFICES . EXPANDED TRADE AND TOURISM ARE PREDICTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel and Morocco established low-level diplomatic relations Thursday , making the North African_country the second Arab nation after Egypt to have formal ties with the Jewish state . After 20 years of contacts that began clandestinely and grew to open visits to Morocco by Israeli ministers , the two countries agreed to establish liaison offices and Israeli officials predicted a rapid broadening of ties , including expanded trade , direct airline service and increased tourism . &quot; It ' s a first_step , an opening of the door , and I imagine there will be a continuation , &quot; said Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , who as prime_minister had visited Morocco ' s King Hassan II in 1986 and who negotiated the agreement over the past three months . &quot; I assume this will influence other countries , and we are working in that direction. &quot; Although expected since Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin stopped in Morocco en route home from signing the peace accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization in Washington a year ago , Thursday ' s move constituted another breakthrough in the Middle_East peace process . Peres called it &quot; the opening of a regional relationship , &quot; different from Israel ' s efforts to make_peace with its immediate Arab neighbors and part of an emerging effort to develop economic ties across the whole of the Middle_East . Under the agreement , Israel will open a liaison office -- an embassy in all but name -- in Rabat , the Moroccan capital ; Morocco will open a similar diplomatic_mission in Tel Aviv , where most countries maintain their embassies . Morocco will also establish a liaison office with the new Palestinian Authority in Gaza City . &quot; I would rather have diplomatic relations immediately , but we must recognize the fact that patience sometimes pays_off , &quot; Rabin said . Peres said the development was made_possible by progress in Israel ' s negotiations with the PLO and by Morocco ' s desire to promote regional economic cooperation . * Hassan will host a major economic conference -- the first with extensive Israeli and Arab participation -- in the palace in Casablanca at the end of October . More_than 1 # 000 political_leaders and business_executives are expected to participate in the session , organized by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum and the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations . Hassan told Peres in a June visit that he was not ready for full diplomatic relations , saying they could be achieved only step by step and urging Israel to make more progress in peace negotiations with Syria and Lebanon . Egypt , which signed a peace_treaty with Israel in 1979 , remains the only Arab state with full diplomatic relations with the 46-year-old Jewish state . Jordan signed an accord with Israel on July 28 , ending the state_of_war between them and pledging to conclude with a peace_treaty . Israel had hoped Morocco and other moderate Arab and Muslim states , including Tunisia , would quickly establish ties after the historic peace accord with the PLO last September . But such moves became politically difficult because of the slowness in moving toward Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip , the stalemate in negotiations with Syria and the massacre of about 29 Palestinians by a Jewish settler while they prayed at a West_Bank mosque six months ago . Hassan has long urged other Arab leaders to accept Israel ' s existence . Rabin , wearing a wig , false mustache and thick glasses , visited Rabat in 1976 during his first term as prime_minister . Hassan later arranged secret meetings between Israeli and Egyptian officials , leading to President Anwar Sadat ' s 1977 visit to Jerusalem . In recent years , the relationship between Israel and Morocco had become increasingly open , and Israeli ministers and envoys regularly traveled_to Rabat for international conferences and political consultations . Trade between the two countries was estimated at $ 100 million in 1993 . Israeli companies operate two experimental farms in Morocco , training farmers and selling Israeli agricultural equipment . Telephone links were established this year , and air service is planned . * Jews of Moroccan origin in Israel now number about 600 # 000 , about 15 % of the Jewish population here , and thousands of them return to Morocco each year on visits , traveling through France and Spain . About 8 # 000 Jews still live_in Morocco , and the current Moroccan Cabinet includes a Jew , Tourism Minister Serge Berdugo . Israeli commentators also speculated that Hassan , a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed , is interested in negotiations over the future of Jerusalem and agreed to establish the liaison offices to ensure that he had a voice .</TEXT>
