   <HEADLINE> REPORT DISCLOSES 2 MCKEON BUSINESS TRIPS IN ' 93 ; SANTA CLARITA : THE LAWMAKER SAYS HE OBTAINED A WAIVER FROM THE ETHICS COMMITTEE FOR THE EXPENSE-PAID WEEKENDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rep . Howard P . ( Buck ) McKeon ( R-Santa Clarita ) , who maintains that he has spent little time on his family_business since his election to Congress in 1992 , took two business-related trips last year , annual financial disclosure reports released Friday show . McKeon said the expense-paid weekend trips to Laguna Nigel and Dallas , sponsored by boot companies , had more to do with personal friendship than business and he obtained a waiver from the House Ethics Committee to accept them . Members are usually prohibited from taking gifts exceeding $ 250 in value . McKeon , who owns a chain of Western clothing_stores with his brothers , received $ 148 # 089 in salary from Howard &amp; Phil ' s Western Wear in 1993 , his report said . But , as required by House rules , he stepped_down as a corporate officer and director . He said the amount_of_time he has spent on the business since his election in 1992 has been &quot; negligible. &quot; Democrat James Gilmartin , a Santa Clarita attorney who is running against McKeon for the second time , has raised questions about McKeon ' s continued involvement with his company . The 1993 financial reports also disclosed that Reps . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) and Carlos J . Moorhead ( R-Glendale ) spoke or appeared before various groups whose interests they oversee as influential members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . Faced with growing public criticism , the House changed its rules several years ago to require lawmakers to give honorariums to charities . &quot; I find it useful to go_out to these groups and explain to them how I see the issues in Washington , and I learn from them as well , &quot; said Waxman , who made 12 appearances for a total of $ 21 # 900 in 1993 to organizations ranging from the American Chiropractic Assn . to the Assn . of National Advertisers . &quot; And I enjoy the fact that , in speaking_to them , I ' m able to donate money to charity. &quot; Moorhead , the ranking Republican on Energy and Commerce , made five appearances for a total of $ 5 # 500 to groups such_as the Snack_Food Assn . and the National Cable_Television Assn . Like Waxman , he said the sponsors of his speeches do not gain any special access to him . &quot; These groups have a right to hear members of Congress talk to them on issues they ' re concerned with , &quot; Moorhead said . &quot; I wish I could do more of them. &quot; Waxman also traveled_to Israel and Hawaii with his wife for conferences . The one-week trip to Hawaii for a session on U.S.-Vietnamese relations was sponsored by the Aspen Institute , a nonpartisan think_tank ; the five-day Israel trip for a conference of worldwide Jewish parliamentarians was funded by United Jewish Appeal . Less active on the trip and speech fronts was Rep . Howard L . Berman ( D-Panorama City ) , who attended a single two-day session held by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in Queenstown , Md. , and gave a single speech to MCA , Inc. Rep . Anthony C . Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills ) took no trips , accepted no gifts and made no appearances , his report shows . McKeon ' s trips were overnight stays with family members paid_for by boot companies whose lines of products are carried by Howard &amp; Phil ' s . McKeon said he was uncertain of the value of the transportation , lodging , food and other costs but he put it above $ 250 on his report . * McKeon and his wife and his brothers and their wives were hosted by the Acme Boot Co . at a luxury hotel in Laguna Nigel , where they played golf . He said this has become an annual event . And McKeon and his brother flew to Dallas for an evening and attended a Dallas Cowboys football game the next day as the guests of the Justin Boot Co . &quot; It ' s more a friendship deal than anything else , &quot; McKeon said . &quot; There ' s lots of companies we can buy boots from . It ' s developing a relationship. &quot; To obtain the ethics waiver , McKeon said he had to &quot; stipulate that ( the companies ) don ' t do any lobbying and had nothing to do with my congressional job. &quot; Gilmartin , McKeon ' s election opponent , has previously seized upon the fact that McKeon and his wife were attending a Western wear convention in Colorado , where they own a condominium , during the holiday weekend when the Northridge earthquake occurred . McKeon said they were in Colorado at their own expense and returned immediately upon learning of the temblor . Gilmartin was out of town Friday and could not be reached . McKeon also participated in a panel_discussion at a meeting of the National Assn . of Home Builders in Las Vegas . He told the group to give his $ 2 # 000 honorarium to the Boy_Scouts of America . McKeon received a $ 1 # 000 campaign contribution from the group ' s PAC since his election , records show . McKeon said he agreed to serve on the panel with two Democratic lawmakers during the Home Builders event at the request of Jack Shine , a friend and political supporter who is_active with the association . Shine contributed $ 1 # 000 to McKeon ' s initial primary campaign in 1992 . &quot; I did_it as a favor to him , &quot; said McKeon , who added that he regarded Shine as &quot; a longtime friend. &quot; And , the lawmaker said , &quot; They wanted a Republican to come. &quot;</TEXT>
