   <HEADLINE> STREET SMART : THE ROADBLOCKS OF RACING TO EMERGENCIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> According to ancient_Greek myth , the music of sirens caused sailors to go mad with desire and wreck their ships on rocky shores . In the modern American version of the tale , the wail of sirens emanates from emergency vehicles , not creatures that are half-woman , half-bird . But the results can be just as chaotic -- especially for the emergency personnel rushing to the scene of an accident , fire or crime . Anxious motorists freeze up and block traffic . Curious pedestrians step into the road . And particularly brazen drivers sometimes end_up crashing into other vehicles -- including the very ambulances , fire_engines and squad_cars answering the call_for help . &quot; It ' s extremely stressful because you have to have 110 % of your focus and attention on everything around you , and an accident can happen in a split_second , &quot; said Los Angeles City Fire Capt . Jack Fry . &quot; It ' s very draining mentally and physically to drive ' emergency. ' &quot; As head of the paramedics bureau for southern Los Angeles , Fry zooms out every day to numerous incidents , his siren blaring , his lights whirling . He has notched his share of roadway headaches , even an accident or two caused by inattentive motorists . Such_as the time he was hit by a &quot; gutter runner &quot; -- someone trying to slip_by the emergency crew by hugging the curb . &quot; Driving one of these emergency ( vehicles ) for 14 years , &quot; he said , &quot; it ' s bound to happen. &quot; * In a perfect world , drivers pull over to the right when an emergency vehicle approaches , clearing a path down the middle , as spelled_out in California Vehicle Code Section 21806 . But the real_world is not perfect . &quot; People will try and race us , &quot; said paramedic Ruthie Rush of Station 46 , which sits at Hoover Street and Vernon Avenue in South-Central Los Angeles . &quot; Or someone will be standing on the side of the street , and all_of a sudden they ' ll dash out_in the street like they ' re playing chicken with us. &quot; Often motorists , their stereos booming , do not even hear the sirens . Others react like a deer in headlights , coming_to a dead stop in the middle of the road and casting uncomprehending glances at impatient ambulance crews as if they are from a different country , said Rush ' s partner , Dave French . &quot; They ' re just ignorant rather than deliberately doing something wrong. &quot; The biggest hazard is cross-traffic . The great majority of the roughly 150 accidents involving emergency vehicles each year in Los Angeles occur at intersections , city fire officials say . Firetruck and ambulance drivers are instructed to stop at all red_lights and stop signs , even though legally they are exempt from most traffic regulations when going &quot; Code 3 &quot; ( emergency mode ) . Rescue workers are also told not to exceed the posted speed_limit by more_than 15 m.p.h. A recent ride with Fry in his Ford Crown Victoria proved the wisdom of these rules . &quot; Incident 784 , &quot; crackled the scanner about 9:30 one night . &quot; Shooting in progress. &quot; A 20-year-old man was reported wounded in the 1600 block of West 59th Street . In a flash , Fry was out of the garage of Station 46 , going Code 3 south on Hoover . At Slauson Avenue , he stopped : Even with his sirens and lights on -- made more noticeable by the evening darkness -- cross-traffic continued to hurtle through the intersection . Along Slauson , motorists for the most part yielded the right_of_way , but some braked in the middle of the street . Fry and the shrieking ambulance barely missed a beat but had to slow_down slightly as they looped around the mess . &quot; When one car does wrong , the others follow_suit , &quot; Fry sighed . Still , he and the paramedic team were able to arrive_at the scene -- a two-mile drive from the station -- within five minutes . That is close to the average response_time departmentwide , which is 5.8 minutes to a fire or medical emergency . And in the business of saving homes or lives , &quot; seconds do matter , &quot; Fry said . Because of that , paramedics familiarize themselves with back routes and less-traveled roads to maximize their time . Rush and French of Station 46 know the secrets : Broadway is a good north-south alternative . Ditto Avalon Boulevard . And , of course , avoid the Harbor Freeway and Figueroa Street during rush_hour . The Harbor can be especially vexing because of major construction under way and the closure of several on- and off-ramps . Rush and French tried it anyway one day but quickly exited to escape the gridlock . They promptly found themselves in a long queue of cars on the off-ramp . The clock was ticking . So , French said with a grin , he simply steered the ambulance down the dirt embankment and barreled right through a construction area . &quot; Hang_on ! &quot; he shouted . &quot; We ' re going four-wheel drive ! &quot; It was not something he learned from the two-inch-thick black binder at the station labeled &quot; Driver ' s Training Manual. &quot; Navigating an embankment also is not part of the obstacle course , or driving &quot; rodeo &quot; ( which paramedics pronounce roh-DAY-oh ) , that ambulance and fire_engine drivers negotiate once a year for practice and evaluation . But when someone needs help , French has to find a way to get there . As long as it is fairly safe . &quot; If I ' m going_to cause an accident , then I ' m not going_to do that person any good , &quot; he said . &quot; But we ' ve gone_up on sidewalks if that ' s the only way. &quot;</TEXT>
