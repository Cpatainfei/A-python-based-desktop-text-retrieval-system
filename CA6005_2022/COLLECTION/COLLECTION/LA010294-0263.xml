   <HEADLINE> THE END OF THE AGE OF EUPHEMISM ; THE GRAPHIC QUALITY OF DAILY LIFE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a young boy , I remember racing through our morning paper , on my way to the sports section , when my eye was caught by a small item . It involved a controversy over the movie , &quot; Anatomy of a Murder. &quot; The film used the word &quot; rape , &quot; thus offending delicate sensibilities and sending local censors into session to determine whether they would allow the film to be shown . I had no idea what &quot; rape &quot; meant , but I recall the item these many years later because whatever the word meant , I knew it was illicit -- a term not permitted in_general discourse . My children , now roughly the same age I was then , will have no such memories . Today , there are no forbidden words because there are no longer any taboos . Virtually every day this past year we were inundated by sexually explicit material -- everything from Michael Jackson ' s alleged child molestation to Amy Fisher ' s affair to Heidi Fleiss ' call-girl ring to John Wayne Bobbitt ' s severed member . For the first time , words like &quot; masturbation , &quot; &quot; anal_intercourse , &quot; &quot; orgasm , &quot; &quot; vagina &quot; and &quot; penis &quot; were appearing regularly in the mainstream press and on prime-time entertainment -- making 1993 the year that the age of euphemism finally came_to an end . Not that the end hadn ' t been coming . For decades , we have been subjected_to ever more graphic depictions of sex on the movie screen , in literature , in music and in art . For nearly as_many years , we have exhibited greater frankness in our public discussions about sexual matters . As nearly everything else in America has become awash in image , sex has been a lonely island of candor . The wider we feel the sea of hypocrisy grows , the more graphic the sexual depictions become . But until recently , certain protocols were still observed in the general media . Sex , especially deviant sex , was treated gingerly , clinically . Some words were just not used . Some actions had to be inferred . Even the tabloid press , which traded freely in sensationalism , spoke in code or rationed its explicit descriptions of sexual conduct . In the last few years the protocols have been falling . Almost every TV talk_show from Sally Jessy Raphael to Geraldo to Donahue to Oprah now features women , and occasionally men , baring their deepest sexual secrets . Syndicated shock jock Howard Stern has pioneered graphic sexual language on the radio . Rap_music is largely dedicated to the raunchiest sexual expressions . Political talk , from President Bill_Clinton to Sen . Bob Packwood , is soaked with sex . But it wasn ' t until 1993 that the protocols fell entirely and we got what seemed a daily diet of sexual stories told in terms once reserved for pornography . Why has this happened ? Though conservatives blame permissiveness for a declining sense of propriety -- as they blame it for every social malfunction -- it is not easy to impute the media ' s obsession with sex to any sudden burst of licentiousness . If anything , the AIDS crisis has curbed promiscuity , so the new explicitness might be partly a product of the new chastity -- denied real sexual gratification , people are driven into vicariousness as the safest_sex of all . There are also powerful pressures within the media that give_vent to explicit sexual coverage . It is strange to think_of the news as titillating -- but newsmen and media mavens are certainly thinking that way . Sex sells , and while that might not have been a consideration for news executives in years past , it has become a consideration as straight news edges into and competes with entertainment . Yet , whatever the impact of AIDS on sexual thinking and whatever the economic imperatives to sell sex in the media , the end of euphemism may ultimately have less to do with our preoccupation with sex itself than it has to do with how we use sex metaphorically . Sex has always been a metaphor . To write_about sex , to discuss sex , to use sexually graphic words and descriptions , as Henry Miller and Anais Nin did , were ways of flaunting what they saw as the calcifying , old social order . Both the provocateurs and the custodians of that social order understood this . They knew that what was at stake in the censorship battle wasn ' t sex at all -- but rather control of the culture . Sex was merely the gauntlet the provocateurs threw down ; it was their metaphor for honesty and free expression in a world governed by what they regarded_as bourgeois hypocrisy . But the literary avant-garde was not alone . While it was hammering at the social order from the top , the foot_soldiers of mass_culture were opening a second front at the grass roots . These warriors weren ' t intellectuals and didn ' t have the imprimatur of art , but they did share the avant-garde ' s distaste for the old cultural commissars who had long determined what was and what was not acceptable . Like the provocateurs , proponents of mass_culture used sex as one of their battering_rams . Movies , popular_music , pulp novels and other mass media introduced sex into the general culture . Gradually , this bombardment of sexual imagery , most largely circumspect and euphemistic , would chip_away_at the old official culture and breach its walls . Still , the protocols held . Even as the general media doted on Mae West or Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield or even Christine Jorgenson -- all walking euphemisms -- the most sexually explicit material was held to the margins , in pornographic magazines and novels . Certainly none ever made its way into the traditional press . For that to happen , as it has now , the metaphor of sex had to acquire a new energy so virulent that the protocols could not withstand it . Over the last few years there have been several sources that have fueled , as well as changed , the sexual metaphor . One of them is our own sense that American society , beset as it is with a host of intractable problems , is now somehow less governable . Explicit reports of sex , especially deviant sex , are a way of reinforcing the idea that no one is really in control anymore . At the same time , sex has become a metaphor for intimacy in an increasingly atomized and mobile society where there is little enough intimacy of any other kind . That may be why sex is a staple of the afternoon talk_shows . By telling us about their sexual fantasies , the pathetic women of the talk-show circuit are trying to create some bond with us , however transient . But finally , the end of euphemism and the new sexual explicitness may really be products of the old metaphor of &quot; sex as honesty &quot; now revived in a different , more urgent context -- one in which honesty is given the highest possible premium . That is because we are more aware of the techniques of duplicity : spin doctoring , infomercials , PR campaigns , dirty tricks . We feel a pervasive lack of authenticity in politics , art , religion , athletics , even human relations . We no longer believe . Amid the fakery , we want something real . And just as the sex_act itself rips through layers of inauthenticity to something fundamental , so , metaphorically speaking , does sexually explicit language rip through the layers of prevarication , manipulation , image and euphemism to something basic , primitive and genuine . Peeking beneath the sheets of some housewife on Geraldo or of Michael Jackson promises us truth . So does Howard Stern telling us in vivid detail about his sex life . So does every new graphic sexual revelation about priests molesting choir boys or fathers abusing daughters . If sex isn ' t hidden , then nothing is . That is why euphemisms finally had to go -- because euphemisms are just another form of concealment . Only the shock_therapy of brutal language , graphic language can shake us from the perfidy of deceit . And so the battering ram of sex now pounds away each day , providing a kind of social ground zero . We know everything . We hear everything . And if it sometimes feels as if we are living within one endless pornographic movie , it is the price we pay_for candor . Anything else would seem dishonest .</TEXT>
