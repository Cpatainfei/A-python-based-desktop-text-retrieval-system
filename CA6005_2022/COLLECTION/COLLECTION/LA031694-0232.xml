   <HEADLINE> BANKER VANISHES ; MEXICAN STOCKS FALL 67.85 POINTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The apparent kidnaping of the chairman of Mexico ' s largest bank caused Mexican stock prices -- which have been sliding since the New Year ' s Day rebellion in Southern Mexico -- to tumble again Tuesday as investors questioned the nation ' s potential as a model for Third_World reform . Amid official silence , Mexican newspapers reported that Alfredo Harp Helu , a billionaire financier who heads Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival , was taken from his car Monday morning by armed men as he was driving near his home_in the fashionable Mexico_City suburb of Coyoacan . &quot; Everything appears to indicate that there was a kidnaping , &quot; said a Mexican law-enforcement official who asked not to be identified . The news comes_after the shock of the bloody peasant uprising in Chiapas and the possible rogue presidential candidacy of Chiapas peace envoy Manuel Camacho Solis . The prospect of a Camacho candidacy has troubled some investors worried both about his commitment to Salinas-style economic reforms and to political continuity . Labor problems also loom , notably a threatened strike by Aeromexico pilots scheduled to begin March 25 . But the disappearance of Harp , 50 , a rising star in Mexican business and closely identified with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s economic_policies , was a particular blow to investors and a reminder of the risks still present in Mexico . Mexico ' s Bolsa stock index closed_down 67.85 points , or 2.8 % , at 2 # 362.03. The Bolsa is down more_than 9 % since the start of the year , and the peso has been sliding against the dollar , chiefly due_to concerns among foreigners . Rafael Bello , a Latin_American markets_analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York , said the apparent kidnaping hurt the Mexican market because Harp is &quot; a very visible businessman and associated with the group of Salinas . . . . It ' s another negative after Chiapas. &quot; Harp ' s company is a financial services giant that operates Banco Nacional de Mexico , or Banamex , the nation ' s largest bank in terms of assets , with about $ 45 billion . Still unclear late Tuesday was whether the kidnaping was politically motivated or one of the growing number of abductions for ransom , a burgeoning industry in Mexico and a source of worry for Mexico ' s colony of foreign executives . About 100 businessmen were kidnaped in Mexico_City alone last year , and scores of abductions were reported in other cities , including Tijuana , Chihuahua and Durango , according to published reports . Unlike U.S. law , victims ' families are not required by Mexican law to report kidnapings and often negotiate secretly with abductors to pay ransoms totaling in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per victim . Neither Banamex officials nor the federal attorney_general ' s office for the federal_district of Mexico_City would comment on the disappearance of Harp , except to quote from a three-paragraph news release issued by Banamex late Monday night . The release confirmed the banker ' s disappearance but stated that the bank would have no further comment so as_to protect Harp ' s physical safety . The bank also said it has asked that the government not intervene in Harp ' s disappearance , a common occurrence when families are negotiating with kidnapers . Mexico ' s Federal Judicial Police have formed a special unit to investigate kidnapings in response to an increase in abductions for ransom during recent years . Times staff writer Tom Petruno contributed to this report .</TEXT>
