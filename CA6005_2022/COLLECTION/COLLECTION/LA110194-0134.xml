   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN WINS PARLIAMENT SEAT AND IMMUNITY ; ELECTION : SERGEI MAVRODI BILKED THOUSANDS WITH HIS MMM PYRAMID SCHEME . BUT VOTERS TOOK HIM AT HIS WORD AGAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Taking his investment_firm ' s you-can-be-rich message to the political_arena , the protagonist of Russia ' s biggest post-Communist financial scandal has won a seat in Parliament and immunity from prosecution as an alleged tax evader , according to election returns Monday . Sergei Mavrodi , whose MMM financial giant provoked panic among millions of investors when its ballooning share prices collapsed in July , was declared the winner over 11 rivals in Sunday ' s special election to select a new representative for a north suburban Moscow district in the Duma , Parliament ' s lower house . The 39-year-old Mavrodi , freed from jail to run but barred by court_order from leaving Moscow , promised in a flood of leaflets and television ads to spend $ 100 million improving the depressed military-industrial district and getting every household there a telephone . Arguing that government meddling had provoked MMM ' s collapse , he also told the estimated 36 # 000 MMM investors in the 489 # 000-voter district that his election and consequent immunity from prosecution would be their best hope for recovering the value of their depressed shares . &quot; Now I have new chances to defend the rights of my shareholders , &quot; Mavrodi said through a spokesman Monday after election officials announced that he had finished first with 27.8 % of the vote , nearly double that of his nearest challenger . No runoffs are held_in races for Parliament . The election , called after the district ' s deputy was gunned_down gangland-style in April , was closely watched as an indicator of the national mood two years before Russians are scheduled to elect a new president . It appeared to show that most people are disillusioned by politics -- fewer than one-third of those eligible voted -- and that any candidate appealing aggressively to their most selfish interests can win , especially in such a divided field . &quot; Most of ( the voters ) were ready to believe anybody who would promise to make them wealthy , &quot; said Alexander Fyodorov , one of the also-rans . &quot; They voted not for a political_program but for a sack of money . . . . It is a Wizard of Oz they elected to Parliament. &quot; Alexander Zharov , Communist mayor of the district town of Solnechnogorsk , finished second with 14.5 % of the vote . Millionaire democrat Konstantin Borovoi , a free-marketeer who promised that his &quot; business contacts &quot; would enrich the district , was third with 13.6 % . Fyodorov finished sixth with 5.9 % . His Russian National Unity party , whose swastika-bearing supporters flashed straight-armed salutes , failed to match the surprising success of neo-fascist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky in last year ' s parliamentary election . In fact , the ultranationalist camp split , as Zhirinovsky backed Mavrodi in hopes of future financial_backing . Mavrodi ' s investment fund became the hottest game in Russia last spring , promising 3 # 000 % annual dividends . Lured by slick , fictional TV ads that showed poor Russians cashing_in MMM shares to buy apartments in Paris and jet to tropical vacations , millions bought_in , and many indeed became wealthy . Government investigators called MMM a classic pyramid scheme that used income from new investors to buy back shares from old investors at ever-rising prices . The price of one share rose from 1 # 000 rubles in February to 125 # 000 rubles ( then more_than $ 60 # 000 ) in July . Then the government announced that MMM was under investigation , investors panicked and soon there was no more new money to buy back old shares . Many Russians lost their savings . Mavrodi was arrested Aug . 4 on charges that another of his companies evaded taxes and that he was obstructing the investigation . MMM suspended trading but did not close_down . Freed from jail Oct . 12 , Mavrodi promised voters that , if elected , he could restore MMM shares , now valued at 13 # 000 rubles each , to their July value within three months . He didn ' t say how . MMM offices received instructions from Mavrodi to reopen today but to keep the trading in old shares suspended until Jan . 1 . Instead , MMM will sell new shares for 1 # 000 rubles each , with promises to raise the price twice a week . Gennady Ponomarev , the Moscow city prosecutor , said the investigation of Mavrodi will continue . If there is enough evidence to bring a criminal case to court , he added , the government will ask the Duma to strip Mavrodi of his immunity .</TEXT>
