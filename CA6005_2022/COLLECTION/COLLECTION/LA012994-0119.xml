   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; SPILL IMPACT WORSE THAN FIRST FEARED ; WILDLIFE : MOST SANTA CLARA RIVER CREATURES THAT DIE FROM OIL INGESTION OR HYPOTHERMIA MAY NEVER BE FOUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An oil spill in the Santa Clara River will have a more devastating effect on wildlife in the ecologically sensitive area than biologists will ever be able to document , state_Department of Fish and Game officials said Friday . Meanwhile , department officials raised the estimated amount of oil spilled from 168 # 000 gallons to 214 # 000 gallons after new studies showed that more oil was in the ruptured pipeline than officials initially believed . Although biologists have recovered only 65 oiled birds , reptiles and mammals , most of the creatures that die from the oil by ingestion or hypothermia will never be found , officials said . Many small birds such_as finches , gnatcatchers , vireos and orioles that become contaminated with oil will fly off into the brush to die where their carcasses cannot be found . Larger animals such_as birds_of_prey that feed_on oiled fish or rodents or become tainted with oiled feathers often fly miles from the site before they are overcome with illness . Turtles , toads and lizards crawl under rocks when ill . And poisoned mice scurry off into the brush to die . &quot; This spill is having a greater effect on wildlife than the numbers ( of dead_animals ) indicate , &quot; said Bob Schlichting , a spokesman for the Department of Fish and Game . &quot; We may never get the numbers of all_the affected birds . And even if they don ' t die outright , their reproduction may be affected when breeding season begins in February. &quot; The endangered least Bell ' s vireo , for instance , nests within the 12- to 15-mile stretch of the river east of Piru that was contaminated when an oil_pipeline ruptured in Valencia during the earthquake . Although the migratory vireos have not yet arrived from their winter habitat in the south , wildlife biologists fear the spill might harm the birds ' food supplies and reproduction . &quot; We ' re hoping now that we will have the oil cleaned_up before they get here in March so there won ' t be any direct effects , &quot; Department of Fish and Game Capt . Roger Reese said . &quot; But we are concerned about indirect effects such_as contamination of the food chain. &quot; The vireos feed_on invertebrate insects , which could become toxic from oil residue in the soil , Reese said . Also , the oil contamination could reduce the quantity of food available for the birds and harm their populations for many years . &quot; We just can ' t get all_the oil , &quot; Reese said . &quot; It ' s impossible. &quot; Reese said the department plans a complete natural_resources damage assessment to study the effects on fish , birds , invertebrates , reptiles and amphibians . &quot; We can only find a small percentage of those affected directly by the oil , &quot; he said . In addition to the wildlife , officials have retrieved 637 dead fish , including three endangered unarmored three-spined_sticklebacks that also live and breed in the area . Of 54 oiled birds found , 27 are dead . The survivors may_not live long , said Lloyd Kiff , director of the Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology and an expert on birds . &quot; People rush to the rescue and spend tens of thousands of dollars saving those few individuals , &quot; he said . &quot; But I ' m told that almost none of those animals survive . The treatment makes the rescuers feel better than it does the birds. &quot; Kiff said the oil-tainted stretch of the river has a thick population of wildlife because of its distance from populated areas . &quot; that ' s a very important stretch of river , &quot; Kiff said . &quot; There is still ecological integrity to the riparian habitat there . Just look_around Southern California and see how many rivers we have with any habitat left. &quot; Although the Department of Fish and Game elevated its spill estimate to 214 # 000 gallons , Atlantic Richfield Co. , the parent company of Four-Corners Pipeline , said it estimates the spill at only 172 # 000 gallons . That is an increase from early company estimates of 147 # 000 gallons . Arco spokesman Albert Greenstein estimated that about 64 # 000 gallons of oil has been retrieved . But he said that does not mean that 150 # 000 gallons -- or 108 # 000 gallons depending_on the estimate -- remain in the river . &quot; A lot has been absorbed into the soil or evaporated , &quot; he said . But Arco will make every effort to see the river is cleaned_up as much as possible , he said . Workers have been cutting_off vegetation just above the roots so it will grow back . They have washed some plants and have removed some soil . And the work will continue for weeks . But the oil has smeared a blackened ring around the willows along the banks , and clumps of oil remain in the watercress and other vegetation in the stream bed . Some isolated pools of the river still showed a heavy sheen . But oil is no longer floating on_the_moving water . Kiff and Reese agreed that the short-term loss of fish and wildlife is not as devastating as development . &quot; It ' s not as bad as having it paved over with asphalt , &quot; Kiff said . &quot; But it is very distressing . It happened at a most unfortunate place. &quot;</TEXT>
