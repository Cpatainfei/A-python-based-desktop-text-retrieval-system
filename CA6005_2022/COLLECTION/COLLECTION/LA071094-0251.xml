   <TEXT> For Italy , it was yet another journey to the edge of the precipice and yet another last-minute escape . And , just as it had been against Nigeria four days earlier , it was Roberto Baggio who rode to the rescue . A goal by the ponytailed Juventus star in the 88th minute earned the Italians a deserved , albeit belabored , 2-1 victory over Spain on Saturday and a berth in the World Cup semifinals . Baggio , who scored the tying goal in the 89th minute against the Nigerians and then the winner in overtime , again will be hailed from one end of Italy to the other for his heroics . But it would be very wrong to suppose that this was a victory due_to the brilliance of a single player . Italy had many heroes Saturday . The first of them was the bald guy in sunglasses and a light blue shirt down by the Italian bench . Coach Arrigo Sacchi has survived a perilous trip through the soccer minefield during the last three weeks , but he has managed to stay one step ahead of disaster all_the while . On Saturday , he took several more risks by tinkering with his lineup for the umpteenth time . He put goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca back in the nets for the first time since Pagliuca had been thrown_out of the game against Norway on June 23 . All Pagliuca did was come_up with a_couple_of critical second-half saves when the Spanish appeared to be getting the upper_hand . He put Dino Baggio into the starting lineup after the midfielder had been used only as a substitute against Nigeria . All Dino did was score the opening goal with a rocketing first-half shot . He put Roberto Signori on the bench , then sent him in_for the second_half . All Signori did was cause panic in the Spanish defense and provide the decisive final pass that resulted in Roberto Baggio ' s game-winning goal . Not a bad afternoon ' s work for Sacchi , who continues to defy the odds and now is only two victories away from joining Vittorio Pozzo ( 1934 , 1938 ) and Enzo Bearzot ( 1982 ) as coaches to win the World Cup for Italy . Saturday ' s game , played in front of 54 # 605 on a hot , muggy , overcast afternoon at Foxboro Stadium , never rose to any great heights . The first_half , in particular , was a largely tedious affair whose lone bright spot was Dino Baggio ' s goal . The 1992 Italian Olympic team star was_on both ends of the goal , initiating the play and finishing it . In perhaps Italy ' s best passing move_in five games , the ball was relayed from Dino Baggio to Roberto Baggio to Daniele Massaro and back to Dino Baggio to Roberto Donadoni to Dino Baggio , who fired a screwball past Spanish goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta . Other_than that , the opening 45 minutes was a stupefying exercise in futility . Things brightened somewhat in the second_half , especially after Spain had tied the score on midfielder Jose Luis Caminero ' s shot that deflected off a defender and into the roof of the net . That instigated a period of Spanish dominance , and Italy was somewhat fortunate to survive without giving_up another goal . The Italians always had the numerical superiority because Spain was reluctant to commit too many players to the offense for fear of exposing itself to the counterattack . Even so , Pagliuca was called_on to make a desperate tackle in front of his goal to deny Julio Salinas a shot and , less than a minute later , tipped a fierce shot by Fernando Hierro over the crossbar . With overtime looking inevitable , the Spanish pressed for the winner , but , as Coach Javier Clemente acknowledged afterward , they made the &quot; lamentable mistake &quot; of leaving their defense momentarily undermanned . One moment was all it took as Signori and Roberto Baggio combined to end Spain ' s World Cup . Why did Italy win when many of the pundits had predicted a Spanish victory ? Courage was one reason . Sacchi said his players were &quot; exhausted &quot; in the second_half after their two-hour battle with Nigeria earlier in the week but endured to the end . Luck was another reason . Hungarian referee Sandor Puhl either did not see or chose to ignore the elbow that Italian defender Mauro Tassotti used to break Spanish forward Luis Enrique ' s nose during a penalty-box scuffle . Tradition is a third reason . Italy is a three-time World Cup winner . Spain has never won the trophy . History might well be_on the Italians ' side in this tournament . They lost their opening game to Ireland , remember , and the last time they failed to win their opening game was in Spain in 1982 . That was the last year they won the World Cup .</TEXT>
