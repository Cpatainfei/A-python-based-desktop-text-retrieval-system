   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; HOOLIGANS , SCHMOOLIGANS : PEACE REIGNS IN ORLANDO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This was to be the hooligan game , Belgium versus the_Netherlands . It was to be , in the paranoia of World Cup security officials , the day the best of times might turn_to the worst of times . There were so many signs of trouble , so many red flags in this sport of red cards . -- Just the day before , there was a game that matched Mexico and Ireland , both of whose fans are volatile . -- Orlando has a central-city area , called Church Street Station , that looked_to be a magnet for soccer gang gathering . -- The Dutch have a history of hooligan activity , and they even have a national law-enforcement agency called the Central Intelligence of Hooliganism . -- And Belgium , while not home to many hooligans , is also known for its soccer fervor and was the ill-fated neutral-site host of the European Cup_final on May 29 , 1985 , when 39 people died in rioting in the stands of Heysel Stadium more_than an hour before Liverpool of England was to play Juventus of Italy . So what happened in Orlando ? On Friday night at Church Street Station , the night after Mexico ' s 2-1 victory over Ireland and the eve of Belgium versus Holland , thousands of soccer fans showed_up . Beer flowed freely . Flags of Ireland , Mexico , Belgium and the_Netherlands were carried around by singing fans . Traffic_jammed . So did sidewalks and parking garages . And three arrests were made . &quot; One was for disorderly intoxication , the other two for trespassing in a bar -- two guys would n ' t leave , &quot; said Mike Holloway , an Orlando Police_Department spokesman . What else happened on Church Street ? According to the Orlando Sentinel , a man waving a Mexican flag verbally baited two Ireland rooters . As police braced for the worst , the_Irish fans crossed the street , approached the Mexican and shook his hand . Later , an Irish fan lamenting the loss , told a reporter , &quot; For penance , I ' m drinking Mexican beer for the rest of the night -- if I can find any. &quot; And what happened Saturday , when a sellout crowd of 62 # 387 showed_up at the Florida Citrus Bowl to watch Belgium beat Holland , 1-0 , in a Group F game filled with missed chances , close_calls and a full 90 minutes of soccer drama ? -- Late in the game , on a day when temperatures hovered near 100 degrees on the field , a Dutch player who had been tossed a cellophane water bag for a quick drink , took a sip and handed the rest to a Belgian player . -- When it ended , the two goalkeepers , who faced an amazing 37 shots between them , met at midfield and embraced . -- The thousands of orange-clad Dutch fans and red-clad Belgian fans stayed for a long_time in the stands , despite the heat . More songs were sung and flags were waved before the stadium emptied -- noisily but slowly and safely . &quot; If we can get_through tonight ( on Church Street ) , we ' ll be home free , &quot; Holloway said . H.D. Hilin of the Jacksonville Police_Department , one of hundreds of law-enforcement officers brought_in from other cities for the World Cup , said at midnight , &quot; There have been no problems tonight ( at Church Street Station ) . In fact , the only problems we have had during the entire World Cup time frame has been some of the local people , and that hasn ' t been too bad. &quot; The peace that reigned was because of the following : -- The English didn ' t qualify for the World Cup , leaving their boorish fans less inclined to fly across the Pond and wreak havoc with the colonies . -- The hooligan potential of the Dutch was overrated : &quot; Those type of people don ' t follow the Dutch National Team , &quot; said Jaap De Groot , a writer for De Telegraaf of Amsterdam . &quot; All our hooligan trouble is with the club teams , and our ticket computers have their names and would n ' t allow ticket sales to them. &quot; -- The security people , including the ever-present Orlando police and Ed Best ' s World Cup security operation , did a good job . Holloway said nine Dutch with criminal_records ranging from armed robbery to kidnaping were identified as they landed in Detroit three days ago and were sent_back to Amsterdam . For World Cup soccer , the best of times continues .</TEXT>
