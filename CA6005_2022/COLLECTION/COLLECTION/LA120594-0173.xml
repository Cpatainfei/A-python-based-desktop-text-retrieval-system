   <HEADLINE> LIBEL SUIT FIGURE TO TEACH NEWS CLASS ; JOURNALISM : SOME UC BERKELEY STUDENTS QUESTION HIRING OF JEFFREY MASSON FOR ETHICS SESSIONS . HE LOST CASE AGAINST NEW YORKER WRITER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For 10 years , Freud scholar Jeffrey Masson waged a futile legal battle to persuade jurors that magazine writer Janet Malcolm violated journalistic ethics in a controversial profile she wrote_about him . A federal_court jury disagreed and exonerated Malcolm last month . But next spring , Masson will get another chance to argue journalism ethics -- from the front of a classroom at UC Berkeley . In an appointment that has stirred protests among journalism school students , Masson has been asked by Tom Goldstein , dean of the graduate_school of journalism , to conduct a five-week portion of Goldstein ' s 15-week course on &quot; Ethical Issues in Journalism. &quot; The controversy -- which pits notions of academic_freedom against questions of professional qualifications -- comes_on the 30th anniversary of the Free Speech Movement ' s inception , which has drawn visitors from all_over the country to the school to commemorate the protest that earned students the right to debate political controversies on campus . Journalism students are challenging Masson ' s standing as a journalist and his qualifications as an ethics instructor . &quot; He hasn ' t worked in daily journalism , &quot; said second-year student Ann Lopez . &quot; Since he hasn ' t been out there facing the deadline pressure -- making quick ethical decisions when reporting -- I don ' t think he should play a major role in this class. &quot; Sandra Madison , a second-year student , said she is trying to organize a boycott of the elective course to protest the appointment . &quot; If ( Masson ) felt he was libeled , he did the right thing to sue , &quot; Madison said . &quot; It doesn ' t mean he has to teach here. &quot; But Goldstein has defended the hiring of Masson in meetings with students and letters to the faculty . Masson will conduct the portions of the class that deal with issues of privacy in profiles and biographies . He will be paid $ 1 # 500 for eight lectures . &quot; He hasn ' t worked in a newsroom , but as the author of half_a_dozen nonfiction books in the last decade , he is certainly a journalist in the broadest and best sense , &quot; Goldstein said . Goldstein said Masson , as a scholar and biographer -- as well as the focus of intense media scrutiny -- has considered the same issues confronting the class . Masson has a Ph.D. in Sanskrit from Harvard_University and taught a course called &quot; Media Harms &quot; at the University of Michigan last year . But he is_best known for his protracted legal battle with New Yorker writer Janet Malcolm over whether she libeled him by using quotes out of context and fabricating incidents in a profile she wrote after he was dismissed from a prestigious job as curator of the Freud Archives in London because of his renegade views about Sigmund Freud . Malcolm argued that she never intentionally misquoted Masson , and a jury found acceptable her practice of stringing together quotations from different times and places without indicating their context . Goldstein is a friend of Masson , and at the time of the verdict called Malcolm ' s compression of quotations into a single monologue &quot; regrettable &quot; because it goes &quot; against what I consider to be good journalism. &quot; But Goldstein said last week that he disagrees_with Masson &quot; on some fundamentals . I do not think he should have brought his case and have told him that for five years . But in his lawsuit . . . he is not the one who admitted to compressing quotations , which I think violates fundamental norms of journalism. &quot; Masson has yet to arrive on campus , but said in a telephone_interview that he is baffled by the strong reaction his appointment has generated . &quot; I don ' t understand the controversy , &quot; he said . &quot; Do they think I will poison the atmosphere or twist their minds ? &quot; The syllabus for Masson ' s section of the course asks students to compare and contrast the biographies of several public figures -- including Franklin Delano Roosevelt , Edward Kennedy , Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton -- to determine how writers treat the intimate details of a subject ' s life . Masson said he hopes the class will define what constitutes a fair and accurate portrayal of a person -- the issue at the heart of his legal battle with Malcolm . Her 48 # 500-word magazine_article used details of Masson ' s sexual exploits to portray him as an egomaniac obsessed with sex . Masson said he plans to address in the course what he sees as a trend in news to illuminate the sensational details of someone ' s life without making a larger point . &quot; We will look_at what does_it take_to know someone , how deep do you have to go , what does_it mean to be fair , &quot; Masson said . Although faculty_members agree that Masson ' s presence will spark discussion , some professors worry that the appointment may suggest that the school has taken a side in the Masson-Malcolm case . &quot; It raises the appearance of impropriety -- as if we were in some way giving a stamp of approval to his quarrel with Janet Malcolm and the New Yorker , &quot; cultural reporting professor David Littlejohn told the San Francisco Chronicle . Susan Rasky , acting associate_professor and former New York Times reporter , said she is also concerned about the school ' s reputation and worried that the choice of Masson &quot; may open the school up_to ridicule. &quot; But , Rasky said , &quot; in the end . . . it comes_down to academic_freedom . I am not prepared to go_to the wall and jeopardize that. &quot; In spite of -- or perhaps because of -- the disagreement over Masson ' s involvement in the course , many other students said they welcome his arrival . &quot; A lot of what goes_on in ethics classes normally is just empty rhetoric , &quot; said Charlie Le Duff , a second-year student . &quot; People say , ' I would n ' t write_about O.J. ' But sure they would . They need to face the reality of the downside of it all and Masson embodies that . I don ' t think we should be afraid of what he has to say. &quot; Another student said the journalism school should invite more people who challenge media practices . &quot; I think it ' s important to hear from people who feel they ' ve been wronged by the press , &quot; said Lisa Weaver . &quot; Once you get_into the job market , there will be pressure to beat the competition . This is the place to hear different views. &quot;</TEXT>
