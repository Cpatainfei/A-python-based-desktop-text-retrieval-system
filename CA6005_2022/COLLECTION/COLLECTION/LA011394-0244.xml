   <HEADLINE> MAHONY CALLS FOR ' TRUE LEADERSHIP ' ON IMMIGRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles Cardinal Roger M . Mahony warned Wednesday that politicians exploiting the immigration issue for votes threaten &quot; to drive an even deeper wedge between people in our communities &quot; in this election year . An outspoken defender of immigrants ' rights , Mahony called_for &quot; true leadership &quot; from those who are willing to address the immigration issue with &quot; creativity and compassion &quot; that he said &quot; has been absent so far. &quot; Mahony also contended that &quot; legislation tends to be piecemeal , and , therefore ineffective &quot; because of the lack of a comprehensive overall immigration policy . &quot; Prophetic vision will emerge when we are willing to include the moral dimension in the discussion , when we are able to recognize the immigrant as a sister or brother , not the enemy ; as an opportunity to strengthen our community , not a problem to be solved , &quot; he said . The cardinal made his remarks in testimony before an Assembly committee on the impact of immigration . Headed by Assemblywoman Grace Napolitano ( D-Norwalk ) , the committee held its fifth and final hearing on the subject . The panel is expected to present its findings and recommendations to the Legislature in coming weeks . Mahony criticized legislation designed to deter illegal immigration as well as two proposed ballot initiatives aimed at cutting public aid to illegal immigrants for health_care and public schooling . &quot; Immigration into this country will not be controlled solely through the measures being proposed ( such_as ) denying basic human services , militarizing our borders , creating tamper-proof identification cards or constructing other obstacles across our borders , &quot; he said . He said several principles based on moral and ethical concerns should be included in an overall immigration policy . First , Mahony said , every person is endowed with a basic and fundamental dignity as a creature created by God -- regardless of their immigration status . &quot; Respect for human dignity and human life is not negotiable , &quot; Mahony said . &quot; Human dignity is not determined by social_class , citizenship , race or ethnicity. &quot;</TEXT>
