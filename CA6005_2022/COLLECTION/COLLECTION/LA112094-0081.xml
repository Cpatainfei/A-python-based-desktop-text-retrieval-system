   <HEADLINE> CRISIS-PLAGUED KARACHI TEETERS ON EDGE OF TOTAL BREAKDOWN OF CONTROL ; PAKISTAN : THE TEEMING CITY IS BESET BY CRIME , UNEMPLOYMENT AND POLITICAL , ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Karachi ' s top official gets_to the office , his sleeves are rolled_up , his phones are ringing furiously and dozens of men are waiting in the sweltering hall to ask urgent favors . There are no easy days for Faheem Khan as he tries to save one of the world ' s most troubled cities . &quot; I ' m surprised myself sometimes how the city carries_on with all its problems , &quot; Khan said in an interview with the Associated Press . &quot; We have unemployment , crime and pollution . People are chasing each other through the streets with guns every day , but the city survives. &quot; Just barely , many people say . The congested , steamy port with 10 million residents has lurched from crisis to crisis in recent years and now a surge in political , ethnic and religious violence is threatening to get_out of control . Karachi ' s woes have scared_away foreign investors at a time when international money is pouring into Asia and fueling booms in much of the region . Karachi , like the rest of Pakistan , has seen little economic_growth . There are gun battles in the streets almost daily . The most serious conflict pits security_forces against the Mohajir Qaumi Movement , a minority group that uses violence , strikes and other confrontational tactics to repeatedly paralyze Karachi , Pakistan ' s business capital and biggest city . The violence has killed hundreds of people the past few months and added_to the general turmoil of a city suffering from frequent power blackouts , high unemployment and dawn-to-dusk traffic_jams . Khan , 33 , was flying a helicopter for an air ambulance service until June , when Prime_Minister Benazir Bhutto picked him as city administrator , the top government post . She had wanted Abdul Sattar Edhi , who heads Pakistan ' s only privately run emergency service and is often compared to India ' s Mother Teresa because of his charity work . Edhi declined and suggested Khan , &quot; one of my most trusted people. &quot; Khan has no government experience . But some say it is appropriate that a man versed in emergency rescues has been put_in charge of Karachi . The army was called_in two years ago to assist Karachi police in trying to curb violence that has killed an estimated 4 # 000 people since 1986 . But the troops have not stopped the bloodshed or dampened the popularity of the Mohajir movement , which represents Muslims who migrated to Pakistan from India when the subcontinent was divided into two nations in 1947 . The Mohajirs account_for a majority of Karachi ' s population , but only about 10 % of Pakistan ' s 120 million people , and they feel shortchanged by fellow Muslims when it comes_to jobs , education and political clout . &quot; The government does not consider Mohajirs to be sons of the soil , &quot; said M.A. Jalil , one of the movement ' s leaders . &quot; They don ' t feel we have the same rights as others. &quot; Security officers repeatedly round_up Mohajir activists , and about 500 are now under some form of detention . The figure includes Jalil ' s wife , Nasreen , a senator in the National Assembly who is under house_arrest . There are other feuds contributing to the city ' s disorder . The Mohajir movement is itself split into two factions whose members often battle each other . Also , followers of the Shiite and Sunni Muslim sects ambush one another with regularity , and criminal gangs battle for turf in a city where underpaid and poorly trained police have little authority . Bhutto , who has a house in Karachi ' s well-to-do Clifton district , expressed shock at conditions when she spent a week in the city in July . She chastised city officials and announced an aid package , but the federal_government in Islamabad is chronically broke and few believe any real help is coming . Karachi was a modest city of about 100 # 000 when Pakistan won independence from Britain 47 years ago . But a relentless inflow of unskilled migrants from the countryside increased the population a hundredfold , overwhelming the city ' s ability to provide services . Several million residents live_in squalid slums that sprouted throughout the city . Social order broke_down over the last decade as a tidal_wave of guns and drugs flowed into Karachi from the civil_war in Afghanistan . The city is burdened by a bloated bureaucracy that many people view_as incompetent and corrupt . Khan said he has been offered bribes as high as $ 300 # 000 for government contracts . He was shocked to discover that only 12 of the city ' s 54 firetrucks were in working order when he took_office . He was dumbfounded when he learned the city was still paying_for 800 full-time firemen -- and many were getting overtime . &quot; This is how irrational our bureaucracy has become , &quot; said Khan . &quot; I don ' t want to stay in this job even one day more_than necessary , &quot; he added . &quot; I just want to get_back to flying my helicopter. &quot;</TEXT>
