   <HEADLINE> ELECTRIC UTILITIES FACE POWER SHIFT WITH NEW RULES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The California Public_Utilities Commission is expected to unveil a proposal Wednesday that could dramatically change how the state ' s electric utilities do business -- an overhaul that could shift billions of dollars in rate payments among residential , small business and industrial customers . The announcement will easily be the most dramatic moment in a deregulation process being watched around the world , as governments attempt to remodel the basic role of electric utilities -- fundamentally unchanged for more_than a century -- largely to promote competition and accommodate new , cheaper technologies . Depending_on the approach favored by the commission , residential customers could see savings of as much as 30 % on their monthly bills , according to one estimate . Other scenarios could boost residential rates in California , already 50 % higher than the U.S. average . For their part , the utilities -- already stressed financially by the state ' s weak economy and other ills -- are concerned that the proposed changes could deal them another blow . Environmentalists , like most other interested parties , favor change . But they worry that the state ' s much-vaunted support for non-fossil fuel energy and environmental protection could be threatened . &quot; We are at a moment of enormous opportunity and enormous risk , &quot; said Ralph Cavanagh , energy program director of the Natural_Resources Defense Council , an environmental group . &quot; This is the most environmentally and economically significant industry in the state of California , &quot; Cavanagh said . &quot; The stakes are very high here. &quot; PUC officials , who have been working_on their secretive deregulation proposal for a year , have declined to reveal details of the plan they will make public Wednesday . But commission President Daniel W . Fessler -- who hopes to hold hearings on the proposal as early as June -- describes it as a response to &quot; very significant changes in the electric service_industry that were being felt not only in California but in other American_states and in a number of other countries. &quot; One big change in the industry has been technical -- particularly , the development of what is known as a natural_gas combined-cycle turbine . &quot; The simple discovery that you could harness a stationary jet_engine and use that to burn natural_gas , &quot; Fessler said , has meant that electricity can now often be made cheaper -- and in small plants scattered throughout a utilities ' service territory -- than it can be generated in a utility ' s big power_plant . Proponents of non-fossil fuels , meanwhile , say that wind_power can now compete with big central plants . And others argue that energy conservation projects -- such_as subsidies for superefficient refrigerators -- can be cheaper to mount than building generating facilities . All this means that one reason big , publicly regulated electric utilities existed in the first place -- that they alone could make electricity -- may no longer apply . Other , smaller companies can do_it now too , and often more cheaply . &quot; This is a challenge to the working assumption that electrical generation was a natural monopoly , &quot; Fessler said . Historically , the basic compact between society and a utility was forged with the earliest electric_companies to avoid the prospect of tangled , competing networks of wires and power_plants . The utilities agreed to provide reliable , low-cost power in exchange for monopolies on their geographical territories and an assured but regulated profit . That profit was based on how much electricity the utilities made and sold -- with no incentives to conserve or to buy from other sources . But with the new economics of power generation , government regulators have been struggling to alter that pattern . Wednesday ' s expected announcement will be the PUC ' s proposal for doing so . &quot; There is a lot of very cheap electricity out there right now , &quot; said Robert Finkelstein , an attorney for Toward Utility Rate Normalization , a San Francisco-based consumer group . &quot; One potential impact of restructuring is that the commission could tell the utilities : ' Thank_you for your efforts in the generation business for the last hundred years , but now it ' s time to capture the benefits that we ' ve already seen in the wholesale ( electricity ) market. ' &quot; Indeed , a robust wholesale market linking utilities with other power generators has developed , spurred by deregulation under several recent federal laws . In turn , lower prices on the wholesale market have attracted the gaze of big industrial users of electricity , some of which -- such_as aluminum smelters -- devote up_to a third of their operating_budgets to buying power . Now these users want to turn the regulatory screw a big notch further , to allow them to buy electricity directly from producers -- whether their local utility or independent producers -- under a system_called retail wheeling . This highly contentious proposal has yet to be fully implemented anywhere , but the utility industry is obsessed with the looming threat of widespread desertion by its business customers . Retail wheeling is one of the range of proposals that the PUC has weighed over the past year . One prospect , known in the industry as the &quot; death spiral , &quot; envisions the utilities losing their biggest customers to independents , being left only as transporters of electricity , much like today ' s natural_gas utilities . Industrial customers -- which are much cheaper to serve than the house-to-house systems for residential users -- might no longer share the cost of the utility ' s infrastructure , driving_up rates to the remaining residential and small business customers . Another uncertainty is what would happen to investments the utilities have made in power_plants , which could be &quot; stranded &quot; -- that is , a cost to the utility without users to pay_for it -- if cheaper power suppliers are allowed to compete for retail customers . This possibility has prompted environmentalists to join the utilities in opposing retail wheeling because that system could favor the cheapest power , whether it was generated in an environmentally benign way or not . Indeed , renewable energy producers have reason to worry because their electricity is not yet as cost-competitive as its proponents believe , according to Edward J . Tirello Jr. , a senior utilities analyst with NatWest Securities in New York . &quot; If you look_at the new order that ' s coming , &quot; Tirello said recently , &quot; the low-cost producer is the producer of choice . It will mean lower rates for everyone . But it will also mean one thing : All these higher-cost renewables . . . are out the window . When you ' re running a business on razor-thin margins , you can ' t do that. &quot;</TEXT>
