   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; OPERATING ANEW ; THE EARTHQUAKE PUT PLANS FOR RESTRUCTURING AT ST . JOHN ' S HOSPITAL ON FAST FORWARD , BUT WORKERS WHO LOST THEIR JOBS QUESTION THE COST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It had become one of the Los Angeles area ' s best-known hospitals : home to the John Wayne Cancer Institute , the Joyce Eisenberg Keefer Breast Center and -- yes , on occasion -- to such celebrity patients as Liz Taylor and Michael Jackson . Then came the Jan . 17 earthquake . Because of what happened in those fateful 31 seconds , St . John ' s Hospital -- Santa Monica ' s biggest employer and arguably among the country ' s highest-profile health centers -- must suddenly reinvent itself . The temblor opened severe structural cracks along the length of the hospital ' s main building and devastated the north wing , prompting the closure of all inpatient services and the furlough of 1 # 750 of St . John ' s 2 # 050 employees . Simply replacing broken buildings isn ' t enough , St . John ' s officials say . With U.S. medicine moving toward a more cost-conscious system of managed care , the hospital has decided it must fundamentally restructure itself , making adjustments immediately that it had planned to phase_in over a decade or more . In some ways , the earthquake has helped St . John ' s administrators in that task , giving them a freer hand , for instance , to make two such changes -- paring the payroll and emphasizing outpatient care . Largely due_to the quake , hospital officials also may consider consolidating certain services -- and perhaps even a merger -- with Santa Monica Hospital Medical_Center . &quot; Aside from the people-pain that is very real and tragic , St . John ' s has been dealt a hand of four aces to better serve the community , &quot; said Bruce Lamoureux , the hospital ' s chief operating officer . * But that ' s small consolation to employees whose jobs have been lost . Because St . John ' s appears likely to rebuild itself in a dramatically different image , many of these workers fear they may never be part of the hospital ' s new health_care plans . Indeed , some employees accuse the hospital of being overzealous in its post-earthquake cost-cutting plans . They question the assurances by administrators that the hospital will rehire as_many former employees as possible to re-create the family spirit and nurturing care that have won St . John ' s a reputation for outstanding inpatient services . &quot; They used this to get_rid_of expensive labor , &quot; said a nurse with more_than 10 years at St . John ' s , who asked to remain anonymous . &quot; I am really upset and angry . Why the hell would they hire me with 10 years ' experience and five weeks of vacation a year over someone at entry-level pay ? &quot; St . John ' s has long been considered a leading hospital , and not just because it has cared_for celebrity patients . Besides serving as home to the John Wayne Cancer Institute and the Joyce Eisenberg Keefer Breast Center , it has highly respected orthopedics , cardiology and obstetrics and gynecological units , among other services . &quot; It is one of the best hospitals in L.A. County and , in fact , in the world , because people come from all_over for treatment , &quot; said David Langness , vice_president of the Hospital Council of Southern California . Still , St . John ' s -- which is operated by the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth , a Kansas-based Roman_Catholic order -- had already begun reshaping itself before the Jan . 17 quake . Hospital occupancy_rates have dropped steadily in California since the 1950s , and St . John ' s 501-bed facility had been operating at 50 % capacity for some time . That trend has accelerated over the years with the increased use of outpatient surgery . And it is expected to continue under the health reform initiatives proposed by the Clinton_Administration . Not long before the earthquake , administrators offered a buyout program through which employees could retire early and receive a severance benefit . Seventy-nine employees signed_up for the program , called the Very Special Person ' s Package . In another cost-cutting move , the hospital had begun &quot; labor_pooling &quot; both licensed and unlicensed staff so they could perform a variety of tasks . Respiratory care therapists were cross-trained in non-licensed nursing functions such_as electrocardiograms and phlebotomy . Laundry and patient transport staff were also cross-trained , with resulting wage increases . And St . John ' s has been at the forefront of efforts to offer outpatient -- rather than more expensive inpatient -- care . As long ago as the late ' 70s , it opened an ambulatory care center -- the first in Los Angeles County -- prompting industry specialists to dub Sister Marie Madeleine Shonka , president and chief_executive_officer of St . John ' s , a health_care &quot; visionary. &quot; To expand such services , the hospital last year proposed building a 1 # 100-square-foot ambulatory care center just across Santa Monica Boulevard that would have featured a surgery center , magnetic_resonance_imaging , radiation oncology , CAT scans and other imaging . * &quot; We , like all other providers , were looking_at how the health_care reform package , the market and the ultimate government-involved product was going_to affect St . John ' s for the future , &quot; Lamoureux said . &quot; We were doing a number of substantial reconfigurations of the way things were being done at the hospital. &quot; The hospital had hoped to make such changes seamlessly over seven to 10 years , but the earthquake has forced an immediate restructuring . The temblor caused an estimated $ 20 million in damage to the hospital , which includes a main building and four wings . The north wing , which housed neonatal intensive care , obstetrics , a nursery , a chemical dependency center , transitional care and medical-surgical beds , has been condemned . The main building , site of administrative offices and the maternity ward , was severely damaged and must be repaired , although the offices remain in_use . The South Wing was damaged but is scheduled to reopen in August , after repairs are complete , with about 150 inpatient beds . The quake forced the evacuation of about 300 patients . About 200 were checked_into nearby hospitals and 100 were sent home . But the harshest effect of St . John ' s closing , all agree , has been_on employees . On Feb . 7 , some 1 # 750 employees lost their jobs -- the vast majority of them nurses , physical_therapists , lab technicians and such support staffers as registry clerks , custodians , food- , laundry- and patient-transport employees and security_guards . The employees were given a graduated severance package , with health benefits through April and wages through Feb . 5 , even though the hospital closed Jan . 20 . A $ 300 cash bonus was paid to those who worked during the earthquake and evacuation . About 250 employees were retained to run the hospital ' s outpatient services in the still-functioning west and east wings . Initially , administrators told employees they would not be given priority over other applicants for future jobs and that , if rehired , they would not retain their seniority . After weeks of employee complaints , however , the administrators backed_down on both counts . * Some of the severed employees have landed on their feet , finding work_at surrounding hospitals including Santa Monica Hospital , UCLA Medical_Center , Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center , Brotman Medical_Center in Culver City and Century City Hospital . Most of those jobs are temporary , however . Intensive-care nurse Mary Tomassini , a 34-year veteran of St . John ' s nicknamed &quot; Big Red , &quot; found temporary work_at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey . &quot; I lost my complete family , &quot; said Tomassini , who has already reapplied for a job at St . John ' s . &quot; It ' s been my whole life . It ' s like a marriage . You go_back to patch things up. &quot; Tomassini now earns $ 1 # 224 for a 50-hour week , just a shade less than her St . John ' s pay of $ 1 # 228.80 for the same hours . But like the other 15 nurses who took temporary jobs at Daniel Freeman Marina , she no longer has benefits such_as a health plan or vacation pay . Some nurses have fared worse . A nursing supervisor , who asked not to be identified , said she now finds herself applying for jobs that pay $ 23 an hour , compared to the $ 30 an hour she received at St . John ' s . &quot; Many hospitals are cutting_back on nurses because of health_care reform . And because of the increase in outpatient services , they are using vocational nurses and nurses ' aides , &quot; she said . &quot; That is what they were doing at St . John ' s . They were using vocational nurses and aides after the buyout . . . . I ' ve been looking_for a job since the earthquake , collecting unemployment and worrying about my mortgage. &quot; About a third of the terminated jobs at St . John ' s belonged_to non-professional staffers . Lamoureux said these workers will probably have the hardest_time finding employment because their jobs revolve largely around inpatient care , which is being reduced as hospitals move to boost outpatient services . After a recent St . John ' s employee meeting in the courtyard , Elia Martinez , a 34-year employee in the hospital ' s laundry , was not heartened by what she had heard . &quot; I am afraid they are going_to hire new employees with no insurance ( and ) no benefits because it is cheaper , &quot; she said . &quot; All of my life I have had only this job . It ' s hard ( for me ) to look_for work someplace else. &quot; * Doctors with privileges at St . John ' s have also been affected . Dr. Michael Lieber , a pulmonary disease and critical-care specialist who is called_in as a consultant by physicians , is part of a group practice whose medical offices are next to St . John ' s . &quot; We used to use four hospitals , &quot; Lieber said . &quot; Now we are operating out of eight . It ' s a lot of driving time and it gets tiring , especially with the freeways still down . St . John ' s is a preferred hospital with good critical-care specialists . I hope it ' s up and running a soon as possible. &quot; Dr. Jon Matsunaga , an obstetrician whose physicians group has a medical office next door to St . John ' s , said he is concerned that the hospital ' s entire obstetrics and gynecological ward might be eliminated . Even if the ward is rebuilt , Matsunaga worries that future cost-cutting might hurt the hospital ' s much-admired nursing_care . &quot; We prefer St . John ' s , &quot; said Matsunaga , a member of the St . John ' s obstetrics and gynecological executive committee . &quot; And one of the reasons , we explain to our patients , is that the nursing_care is exceptional. &quot; Matsunaga also fears a scaled-down St . John ' s could limit local residents ' health_care options . The quake , he said , has underscored the potential for such a problem by interrupting hospital service both at St . John ' s and at nearby Santa Monica Hospital Medical_Center , which is functioning at less than half its capacity . &quot; St . John ' s closing is having a major impact on the community , &quot; he said . &quot; To lose one-and-a-half hospitals is leaving ( the community ) without medical care. &quot; Sister Marie Madeleine said St . John ' s will never again employ the 2 # 050 staff it once had . She said it is unlikely the staff will ever exceed 1 # 000 , but said the downsizing will not compromise care . &quot; This is the challenge of a new life , &quot; she said . &quot; To build the hospital of the future , to meet the community needs and have the flexibility to do_it . It may be smaller . But it will be better. &quot; Although plans for the ambulatory care center have been dashed with the earthquake , administrators have fast-forwarded their once-distant plans to convert some of the hospital ' s towers to outpatient facilities . Also being discussed is construction of a cluster of free-standing outpatient clinics that would offer dentistry , outpatient surgery and radiation oncology , among other services . Whatever the final plan , it will likely be shaped with help from Santa Monica Hospital Medical_Center , once a fierce competitor of St . John ' s . Administrators from the two hospitals have already begun brainstorming about the possibility of joining forces , among other proposals . * Santa Monica Hospital suffered an estimated $ 15 million in quake damage , losing more_than half of its 365 inpatient beds . Repairs are expected to be complete in October . &quot; This is a little touchy in the sense that these two hospitals have had a very long history of being competitive , &quot; said William D . Parente , president and chief_executive_officer of Santa Monica Hospital . &quot; Maybe there can be one grand hospital in the community . I hope we don ' t just rebuild these hospitals to mirror each other . We ' re willing to say , ' OK , we ' ll hold_off doing anything until we see what should be done overall for the community. ' &quot; That process could bring major changes if local hospitals heed Leland Kaiser , a professor of hospital administration at the University of Colorado at Denver and a well-known futurist . &quot; Expect your patient census to drop another 30 % , &quot; Kaiser said in a recent talk to the St . John ' s and Santa Monica Hospital staffs . &quot; Our challenge now is to move_into health education , ambulatory care , prevention and into the neighborhoods to get_to know your community . &quot; Now is the time to think_about a hospital without walls . The Lord just brought the roof down . And a_few years from now , I think you will be saying it was the best thing that happened to you. &quot;</TEXT>
