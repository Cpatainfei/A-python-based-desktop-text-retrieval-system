   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : NETHERLANDS ; ABLE TO SAIL ; THEY WENT FOR THE ADVENTURE AND FOUND SPECIAL PRIDE IN MOMENTS OF INDEPENDENCE AND DISCOVERY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sailing out_to the Waddenzee in the north of Holland and having our vessel fall dry on the sand as the tide went_out had not been my idea of how to spend a vacation . But the morning I slid_down the ramp from our 1890s clipper_ship and walked on the bottom of the sea was one of the highlights of my voyage on the Lutgerdina . The fact that several of the passengers were in wheelchairs , one was legally blind and some of the rest of us had other physical impairments was no obstacle to the crew of this sailing_ship owned by Holland ' s Aquatic Sports Foundation for People With Disabilities . The wheelchairs were tied with ropes to be gently let_down the steep incline . Strolling the sea floor , I looked with curiosity at the anchor that had held our flat-bottomed boat in place that night , studied the wormlike squiggles in the sand and marveled as the tide rolled in . Before the water rose too high on the wheelchairs , the crew got us all safely back on deck . I re-boarded the ship with a pocketful of shells and a memory I will not forget . It had been my brother ' s idea to book this 13-day sailing and sightseeing tour of Holland . A wheelchair user due_to muscular_dystrophy , Richard was looking_for an active vacation . In the early stages of MD myself , I had been asked to accompany him and my niece , Diana , a lively 11-year-old who served as her father ' s attendant on the trip . So last June we three joined 11 Canadians and became the first U.S. citizens to sail the Lutgerdina since a Dutchman named Jan Olijve had dreamed of marketing the accessible cruises in North_America four years earlier . Working with the Ontario March of Dimes , Olijve , the owner of JOS Sailing , had organized the first group of 20 Canadians in September , 1992 . Sailing holidays for the disabled are not new_to the Dutch . The Lutgerdina , a 110-foot , double-masted clipper_ship built_in 1897 , was refitted in 1979 as an accessible teaching sailboat with adapted toilets , roll-in showers and a lift between decks . A hydraulic device allows passengers with limited hand or arm functions to steer the ship , and an electronic gadget instructs blind helmsmen on setting course . Navigation charts also are available in Braille . Our trip to Holland ' s waterways started aboard KLM Royal Dutch Airlines . The seven-hour flight from New York ' s Kennedy International Airport to Amsterdam ' s Central Airport of Schiphol went smoothly enough except for a wait while the flight crew obtained a narrow-aisle wheelchair to transport my brother off the plane . After we encountered the same delay on our return , a KLM employee in New York explained that the airlines have codes to signify which wheelchair passengers can walk short distances by themselves and which cannot , and that it ' s a good idea to check and make_sure passenger status is correctly understood . Met at the airport by a guide from JOS Sailing , we were transported by van to the Lutgerdina , docked near Amsterdam ' s Centraal Station . Although our tour included all transportation , wheelchair users can ride the frequent trains between the airport and this rail-service hub . Except for trips to and from the airport , people with disabilities need to call a day in_advance to obtain the special assistance offered by the national railways . Train timetables in Braille are available for the visually impaired . The first passengers to arrive , we got our choice of the ship ' s tiny sleeping cabins , which were outfitted with bunkbeds , a sink and wall cabinet . Two bathrooms with adapted toilets and roll-in showers were located at one end of the bunk-room area . ( Since our trip , all_of the Lutgerdina ' s cabins have been renovated , and all but one converted to two-person accommodations. ) But even being squeezed three or four to a room somehow did not matter very much . &quot; Who would even think you would n ' t mind living with four people in a little tiny cabin , ' said Dorothy , a 76-year-old widow from Toronto . &quot; Everybody on a boat talks their own life . The group dynamic is a good thing for me. &quot; Young and old , able-bodied and disabled , sailing enthusiasts and inexperienced landlubber , seasoned travelers and first-time visitors to Europe , we would all take_away our own memorable moments from the trip . Independent in her electric-powered scooter , Dorothy came for the sailing and found special pride in boarding one of Amsterdam ' s accessible streetcars by herself . Not all public transportation in Amsterdam is accessible , and one of the best ways to see this compact city of canals , bicycles and outdoor cafes is by walking . But since many of the narrow streets are cobblestone and the sidewalks often brick , it ' s a good idea for wheelchair users to have someone to push them and to stick_to the bike paths that frequently are separated from traffic . On a guided walking tour the morning after our arrival , we passed the palace of Queen Beatrix , snapped pictures of the houseboats lining the canals and lingered at the colorful , floating flower market near the 17th-Century Munttoren ( Mint Tower ) . Not far away , people were buying and selling at Amsterdam ' s well-known flea_market . Our tour took us to the Rijksmuseum , home of Rembrandt ' s &quot; The Night_Watch &quot; and other 17th-Century Dutch masterpieces . Some of the group spent the entire day there and at the nearby Van Gogh Museum . Both museums are wheelchair accessible , as is the nearby Stedelijk Museum , specializing in late 19th- and 20th-Century art . But with an 11-year-old restless with centuries-old paintings , we left the Rijksmuseum to visit one of Amsterdam ' s famed diamond factories across the street . Admission was free , and the visit well worth our time . A diamond cutter interrupted his work to explain to us the painstaking craft he had learned from his father about 40 years before . Like most of the Dutch we met even in small village shops , he spoke English . Late afternoon found us in front of the Amsterdams Historisch Museum . Paintings , models and artifacts trace the history of this city founded as a hamlet on the River Amstel to its emergence as a major European capital . Although parts of the museum were not accessible , our only regret was that we did not have more time to spend there . We ended the evening with an hourlong canal cruise that took us through Amsterdam ' s illuminated bridges and gave us an overview of the city by night . Of the many tour boats available , ours had a lift for wheelchairs . The guide kept_up a steady spiel in Dutch and English , pointing_out such landmarks and curiosities as Amsterdam ' s narrowest house ( barely more_than a yard wide ) and the ornate facades of an earlier age . The next day we set sail for the IJsselmeer , Holland ' s largest lake , which was closed_off from the sea , and is accessible by a series of locks . Our mornings started with a typical Dutch breakfast of assorted breads , cheese , ham or salami , jelly , chocolate strands ( sprinkled on bread ) , fruit and coffee . Lunches were similarly simple fare , but dinners were_full home-cooked meals often topped_off with yogurt or a kind of pudding for dessert . Our sailing tour took us to the medieval castle Muiderslot in the small village of Muiden ; to Hoorn , a thriving harbor town founded in the 14th Century that is a reminder of its boom trading days as the home of the Dutch East India Company ; and through the canals in the flat farmlands of Friesland in the north of the_Netherlands . On our last_day at_sea we anchored at Enkhuizen in North Holland , the home port of the Lutgerdina and one of the most picturesque of cities , with fortified walls and buildings dating_from the 15th to 17th centuries . We spent part of the afternoon touring the Zuiderzee Museum , dedicated to depicting what village life was like on the shores of the Zuiderzee before that body_of_water was closed_off from the sea in 1932 and transformed into the modern IJsselmeer . The outdoor section of the museum is wheelchair-accessible and fascinating , even though the cobblestone streets and steep inclines do not make_it easy to get_around . Costumed guides in this meticulously restored town of 135 shops and homes help give an authentic picture of Dutch life at the turn_of_the_century . On a bus trip the next day , we passed_through polders planted with flowers and potatoes and saw some of the windmills the Dutch built to claim this low-lying farmland from surrounding lakes . After a coffee_break on the dunes of the North_Sea , we entered the stately city of The Hague , the seat of government in the_Netherlands . We had time only to see the parliament buildings with the 13th-Century Knights ' Hall , Queen Beatrix ' s palace and the International_Court_of_Justice , but The Hague offers a number of other attractions , including Holland ' s oldest picture_gallery , and the Madurodam , a miniature Dutch village with exact reproductions of many of the_Netherlands ' most famous buildings . We spent the last three days on Robinson Crusoe Island , which is operated by the Aquatic Sports Foundation for People With Disabilities in the Loosdrecht Lakes district south of Amsterdam . Staff instructed us in the use of accessible canoes , kayaks and sailboats , and helped those wanting to swim or water-ski . We paddled through canals filled with water_lilies and took a tugboat cruise in the rain past manor_houses and castles to Breukelen ( Brooklyn ) . Transported to the Schiphol the next day with time enough to take_advantage of the airport ' s large duty-free shopping area , we were ushered through customs and sent_off with hugs and kisses . My brother asked me what I had thought of the trip . &quot; It wasn ' t what I would have planned , but I ' m glad I came , &quot; I said .
