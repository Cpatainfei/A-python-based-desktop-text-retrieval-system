   <HEADLINE> STUDY FINDS PROGRESS , PROMISE IN FUEL_CELLS ; TRANSPORTATION : THE TECHNOLOGY COULD CREATE 70 # 000 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOBS AND BE USED TO MAKE POLLUTION-FREE CARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As hearings open today on whether auto_makers can put battery-powered vehicles on California highways by 1998 , a new study sponsored by Los Angeles transit officials finds surprising progress -- and the promise of 70 # 000 new Southern California jobs -- in fuel_cells , the technology that many expect is next down the road . The fuel_cell is a still-evolving technology that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electricity without pollution-forming combustion . And while progress has been slower than many hoped in improving electric_batteries for cars , the new study -- sponsored by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- finds rapid progress in fuel_cells . &quot; We ' re bullish , &quot; Rich Davis , MTA director of equipment engineering and advanced technology , said at a technical briefing Wednesday . &quot; There ' s no question that the fuel_cell will come. &quot; * Indeed , many researchers see a hybrid of the two technologies as the best zero-emission vehicle over the long term , though this week ' s California Air Resources Board hearings in Los Angeles will focus largely on batteries . Fuel_cells are still too expensive and heavy for widespread commercial application . In theory , they can provide more range than batteries , while batteries offer better acceleration than fuel_cells alone and can store energy recaptured as vehicles brake . Still , what was once a technology described as a decade or more away now seems much closer . Mercedes-Benz has already equipped a vehicle to run_on fuel_cells . Ballard Power_Systems of Vancouver , British_Columbia , has one operating fuel-cell bus and expects to build 20 more in the next four years . The U.S. Energy and Transportation departments are building three buses , and two European bus projects are under way as well . Meanwhile , fuel_cells are also in_use as power_plants , producing supplementary electricity at more_than a dozen sites in Southern California , ranging from fast-food outlets to hospitals . Last month , ground was broken_in Santa Clara for a utility-scale fuel-cell power_plant . All this could mean a significant infusion of jobs for the region , according to the new report by the Economic Roundtable , a nonprofit economic research group in Los Angeles . The study finds that many of the major industries most likely to build fuel-cell parts already have a foothold in the Los Angeles area . Of 18 industries needed to make fuel_cells , seven are_better represented in Southern California than elsewhere in the country , according to the study . Of those , five that would create 52 % of all_the new jobs -- manufacturers of chemicals , plastics , electronic components , electrical equipment and industrial equipment -- are more competitive than their rivals in other states in terms of labor and productivity . &quot; Our assumption is that these five key industries would likely be key players in a nascent fuel-cell industry , &quot; said David L . Rigby of UCLA ' s Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies , which conducted technical and financial analysis for the study along with UC Davis ' Institute of Transportation Studies and the Union of Concerned Scientists . Rigby acknowledged , however , that &quot; the most difficult thing in a forecast like this is to work_out the level of demand &quot; for new technologies . According to Project California , the blue-ribbon committee charged with developing advanced transportation and communications industries in the state , the world market for fuel_cells could grow to $ 9 billion in transportation by the year 2007 . Los Angeles itself offers an enormous market for what experts say will be the fuel_cell ' s first likely transportation use : buses . Still , the Economic Roundtable study warns that Southern California manufacturers must get_into the game fast , because potential rivals outside the state are already concentrating_on the technology , particularly in Japan . &quot; The first-mover advantages are absolutely critical , &quot; Rigby said . Fueling Job Gains ? Fuel_cells turn hydrogen into electricity -- without combustion and the resulting pollution . The nonprofit Economic Roundtable predicts that as_many as 70 # 000 jobs could be created in the Los Angeles area if a fuel-cell-powered transportation industry can be developed . Its report recommends that officials take several steps to encourage such an industry , including : * Formation of a buyers consortium of bus , waste-collection and other municipal agencies and private fleets to create a market by buying fuel_cells that meet common specifications . * Preferential consideration for Los Angeles-area firms as fuel-cell component suppliers . * Assistance for manufacturers seeking financing for product development . * Streamlined , one-stop permit processing by the South Coast Air Quality Management District and other regulators for fuel-cell component manufacturers .
