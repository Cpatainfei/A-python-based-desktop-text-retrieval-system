   <TEXT> The Pentagon ' s far-flung empire of government and private laboratories guaranteed for decades that American soldiers would fight with the best weapons and that U.S. industry could tap a ready source of technology for commercial products . Those days are gone . Instead , America ' s supremacy has been replaced by a fear here that leadership is passing to foreign competitors in a number of exotic technologies crucial to future national security . The concern was highlighted last week when the Pentagon unveiled a $ 580-million program to subsidize the creation of a viable domestic industry to produce flat-panel displays , a type of screen used on laptop_computers that is expected to play a vital role in future weapons_systems . Japanese producers , which hold 95 % of the $ 5-billion world market , have shown no interest in selling the screens to the Pentagon and have rejected Pentagon requests for producing customized military screens . The United States has only a_few small firms capable of building the screens , and they lack a single major production plant . &quot; It is not the last time we are going_to confront this kind of a problem , &quot; said Julie Gorte , a defense expert at the Office of Technology Assessment . &quot; And we can ' t afford to put a half-billion dollars into everything we want to save. &quot; Although such concerns have been smoldering for a decade , the subsidies for computer_displays clearly illustrate the potential cost to the government -- and ultimately taxpayers -- when domestic firms stumble in global competition . It raises serious questions about the long-term limits of American military power as other nations build their own high-technology industries that have important military applications . In some cases -- nuclear_weapons technology , for example -- the Pentagon ' s labs still have their brainpower in the wrong places for the post-Cold War world . And while government and industry are in many cases still producing leading-edge technology , in other cases they have been eclipsed because foreign competitors often have more focused research programs and can finance research and build production plants at a lower cost . Meanwhile , the U.S. lags foreign rivals in such crucial areas as optical data storage , robotics , composite_materials , ceramics and electronic packaging , according to Daniel Burton , president of the Council on Competitiveness , a private research group in Washington . U.S. industry has clearly improved its competitive position in the world in recent years , but it is unlikely that it will ever again regain its dominance of every field of high_technology , particularly in various electronics sectors , Burton said . So , the Pentagon may face gaps in critical areas , even though U.S. high-technology firms are generally healthy financially . Future wars are expected to be increasingly fought by electronic systems , in which moving data on the battlefield will be just as important as firing artillery rounds . As was the case in the Persian_Gulf_War , victory will be determined in many cases by which side has better electronics . In the case of flat-panel displays , the Pentagon believes the need will become &quot; urgent , &quot; according to Kenneth Flamm , deputy assistant secretary_of_defense . The screens , which are lightweight and show greater detail than traditional television-type displays , will allow soldiers to better absorb the massive data that will flow between high-technology defense_systems . &quot; We think that having advantage in display technology is going_to give us both tactical and strategic advantages , &quot; Flamm said . &quot; It ' s going_to minimize the loss of life in conflicts . It ' s going_to reduce material costs. &quot; But that vision runs smack into Japan ' s virtual monopoly on flat-panel displays . Sharp , Toshiba and NEC dominate the worldwide industry , which is projected to explode into a $ 20-billion market by the end of the decade . Sharp alone accounts_for more_than 50 % of world sales . Defense_Department purchases are unlikely to ever represent more_than 5 % of that market , meaning that the Pentagon could end_up being treated no different than Radio Shack by Japanese suppliers . Richard H . Van Atta , a Pentagon technology expert , said the Defense_Department has no evidence of a Japanese government policy to block sales to U.S. weapons producers , but rather , individual companies have their hands full with the burgeoning commercial market . In addition , Japanese firms do not want to deal with the cumbersome federal acquisition regulations -- the same mind-numbing rules that have driven companies such_as Intel Corp . out of the defense business . Even if Japan ' s firms were willing suppliers , reliance on superior foreign products will never sit well with the American military . &quot; Any case where our technology is not at the forefront gives us pause , &quot; said Christopher Hill , a senior policy analyst at Rand Corp . &quot; It challenges our entire security strategy. &quot; Hill argues that if the Pentagon does not act now , Japan ' s superiority in making flat-panel displays may become so commanding that U.S. firms would never have a chance to re-enter the market . The subsidy program marks the Clinton_Administration ' s deepest plunge into its so-called dual-use industrial policy , in which it seeks to foster technology supported by commercial markets that can also meet military needs . Under the policy , the Pentagon has created an office for economic security , a far throw from the historic limits of military operations . &quot; You do get concerned about national security when all production is so concentrated not only in one country but in one company , &quot; said Katherine Gillman , the White_House ' s top defense-conversion expert . &quot; The policy is to rely_on the commercial sector , except we don ' t have a flat-panel sector in this country. &quot; It is not clear that the Pentagon ' s $ 580 million is going_to fix the problem . The Pentagon has already been pumping about $ 100 million annually in research money into the industry for several years . The new program offers additional research subsidies to firms or joint_ventures that are willing to build production plants . The goal is to encourage the construction of four large-scale plants that would claim 15 % of the world market and create a self-sustaining industry . Flamm believes that a U.S. industry would provide the Pentagon with access to leading technology even before it appears in the commercial market and with suppliers willing to customize products for military use . But the program is costly by any measure . The Pentagon estimates it will buy 15 # 000 flat-panel displays annually by 1998 , worth up_to $ 10 # 000 each , or a total of $ 150 million . The subsidy program in that year will amount to $ 140 million , a subsidy rate of nearly 100 % on sales . Such high subsidies are necessary because just a single production plant costs $ 400 million to build . The Defense_Department projects that in 25 years , it will be buying 90 # 000 of the displays every year . If the subsidies can create a domestic industry to fill that need , the program will be considered a smart investment , according to a number of experts . &quot; They are doing_it creatively , &quot; said Burton of the Council on Competitiveness . &quot; It would be great if we could have a flat-panel display industry here in the United States. &quot;</TEXT>
