   <TEXT> Parents , heed this warning : Some educational computer software programs are extremely addictive . They say right on the package that their aim is to teach children skills in everything from art to finances . But these programs take_up far more time than you could have ever imagined -- regular bedtimes will be resisted , meals will be missed , chores will go undone . We ' re not talking_about your kids here . They ' ve grown_up in the computer age , and although at times they may binge out on a game or some_other computer task , today ' s kids do not look_upon computers as a novelty but as a part of their regular existence . It ' s you we ' re worried about . Some educational_programs are so whimsical and imaginative that they are positively irresistible to grown-ups . Hello , my name is David and I can ' t stop playing Kid Pix . Kid Pix is a drawing / painting program developed by Craig Hickman , who wanted an art program that could be used by his 3-year-old son . Offered by Broderbund , Kid Pix sells for about $ 35 to $ 40 and is available in the DOS , Windows and Mac platforms . Like adult art programs that are far more complex and expensive , Kid Pix has the usual tools that turn your cursor into a pencil , brush or eraser , and it works in a huge range of colors . But what sets Kid Pix apart from the ultra-sophisticated professional programs is that it draws and paints in the way people have since prehistoric artists depicted the hunt on cave walls . Even pros who make their living at graphic design find this comforting . &quot; Let ' s say I have to do something as simple as a curved line , &quot; says Deborah Daly , a Venice-based book designer / illustrator who happily admits to occasionally using Kid Pix to add flourishes to her work . &quot; I have to get_out one of their drafting tools and architecturally create it . &quot; With Kid Pix , it ' s direct . It ' s like you take_out a pen and draw right on paper. &quot; Its simplicity lets those of us with no artistic training and absolutely minimal ability start right in on Kid Pix and have a blast . It ' s the closest thing in the digital world to Crayola heaven . But because it is digital , Kid Pix can do astonishing things far beyond what was possible in kindergarten . In addition to making the expected variety of geometrical shapes , you can adorn your drawing with little rubber_stamps that range from everyday items such_as a wristwatch to dinosaurs and Egyptian goddesses . You can add text in a variety of fonts , &quot; fractel &quot; trees that come_out different every time and even a feature that leaves a wake of stars as you drag the cursor across your digital sky . On the slightly more serious side is The Cruncher , a program from Davidson &amp; Associates ( Mac and Windows versions available for about $ 35 ) that teaches kids about spreadsheets . I have to admit that just the mention of spreadsheets used to quickly move me to the other side of the room . It sounded so , well , corporate . But using a step-by-step tutorial , The Cruncher explains just how a spreadsheet works to organize , edit , display and calculate figures in a table . So what if the examples used are keeping track of candy_bar sales to benefit the school basketball_team , after-school jobs or adjustments to a cookie recipe ? These are easily applied to the adult world without the sometimes painful task of making your way through an adult computer_program manual . And so what if The Cruncher shows you how to set_up a chart to determine how much of your allowance you ' ll have to set_aside to eventually buy a Walkman ? This could easily be used to instead buy adult items , such_as an exercise machine or a hedge trimmer . They ' ll keep you busy during those frustrating times when the kids insist on using the computer .</TEXT>
