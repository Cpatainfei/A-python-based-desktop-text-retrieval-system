   <HEADLINE> THE FAMILY FILE : 90S FAMILY ; LOOKING FOR THE CHILD_CARE MODEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In search of a model to address the &quot; quiet crisis &quot; afflicting this country ' s youngest children , Columbia University family policy experts Sheila B . Kamerman and Alfred J . Kahn have turned their sights toward Europe , where paid and job-protected maternity / paternity leave are universal , and where child_care is not considered the purview solely of &quot; at risk &quot; families . In their report , &quot; A Welcome for Every Child : Care , Education and Family Support for Infants and Toddlers in Europe , &quot; the researchers note that in many European_countries , child_care and family support services are seen as vital to the cognitive and social development of children . Child_care services in these countries are expensive , but heavily subsidized , Kamerman and Kahn report ; parent fees for child_care constitute less than 10 % of the average income of families who use them . ' Work Won ' t Love You Back ' There ' s a new manual for dual-career couples with the chillingly apt title of &quot; Work Won ' t Love You Back &quot; ( W.H. Freeman , 1994 ) . The book , by psychologists Stevan E . and Ivonne H . Hobfoll -- a husband / wife team with three children -- urges parents to make family-centered accommodations , because &quot; no one on their death bed has ever wished they had spent more time at work. &quot; Hints at the Causes of Child Behavior Write what you know , the old axiom goes , and so Cathy Rindner Tempelsman has penned &quot; Child-Wise &quot; ( Morrow , 1994 ) . The book , a &quot; compassionate &quot; guide to parent-child relationships , draws_on Tempelsman ' s own experiences as the working mother of three children to help parents as they react to everyday problems with their children . While no one can explain why children do what they do , this author offers earthy and empathetic insights into the mystery of child behavior . Unmarried-Couple Category Mushrooms A Census_Bureau study , &quot; Marital Status and Living Arrangements : March 1993 , &quot; has found that there were 3.5 million unmarried-couple households in 1993 , up from just 523 # 000 in 1970 . It also found that the median age for first marriage was 26.5 in 1993 for men and 24.5 for women , up from 23.2 and 20.8 respectively in 1970 . The number of women living alone rose 94 % from 7.3 million to 14.2 million between 1970 and 1993 . In the same period men living alone increased 167 % from 3.5 million to 9.4 million .</TEXT>
