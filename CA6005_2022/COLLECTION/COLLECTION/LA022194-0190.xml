   <HEADLINE> MOTOROLA IS A VETERAN OF JAPAN BATTLES ; TRADE : ELECTRONICS GIANT SCORED AN EARLIER VICTORY FOR ITS PAGERS . NOW IT SEEKS A FAIR_DEAL FOR CELLULAR PHONES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It started with pagers . Motorola invented them and by 1978 was the worldwide leader -- except in Japan , where the Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone monopoly refused to buy from anybody outside a cozy circle of Japanese companies such_as NEC Corp . and Fujitsu Ltd . So Motorola launched what turned_into a protracted siege . It borrowed the battering ram of the U.S._government to weaken Japanese resolve , and after tortuous negotiations and the personal intervention of then-Secretary of State George P . Shultz , NTT agreed to let foreign suppliers bid on its business . But that was just the beginning . New pagers had to be designed and built to NTT ' s arcane specifications and stringent quality standards . Undeterred , Motorola built a new American factory line and a special testing facility in Japan . Defect levels in its pagers fell nearly to zero . &quot; We wanted to take_away any excuse for why American companies can ' t be successful in Japan , &quot; says Arnold Brenner , Motorola ' s executive_vice_president in_charge of Japan . Motorola finally managed to capture a large part of the pager market in Japan . Yet despite 16 years of effort and a remarkable record of success practically everywhere else , the company continues to face barriers at every turn_in Japan ' s cellular_telephone market . Such problems have led to a clash between the world ' s two biggest economies over a balance of payments more lopsided in Japan ' s favor than ever before . Should a trade war erupt between Washington and Tokyo , the spark in the powder_keg may very well be Motorola , whose struggle culminated last week in President Clinton ' s announcement that he would level sanctions against Japan for reneging_on promises to give Motorola full access to its cellular-telephone market . But Motorola isn ' t just a catalyst . More_than most companies , it has experienced the full range of the Japanese economic miracle . Thanks to Japanese competition , Motorola has transformed itself . The question now is whether , thanks to Motorola and its influence in Washington , Japan will do likewise . * For Motorola , the transformation was mostly positive . Driven from the television manufacturing_business , Motorola remade itself as a cutting-edge technology company and bounced_back to challenge Japan Inc. in one of its greatest strongholds -- microelectronics . Although Japanese companies like NEC and Fujitsu continue to make inroads into the U.S. market in such key sectors as cellular_phones , Motorola remains the industry leader . It also excels in computer chips . Last year its earnings doubled to $ 1 billion from the year before , while sales climbed 25 % to $ 16.9 billion . But if Motorola has beaten a path into the Japanese market , it is a narrow path not many can follow . Few U.S. companies have the combination of technological leadership , financial muscle and diplomatic clout Motorola has . The company hires experts on Japan , including former U.S. trade officials , to advise it , and the official in the U.S. trade representative ' s office most knowledgeable_about Japan is a former Motorola executive . * In spite of all this , Motorola remains hobbled in Japan . Yet Motorola also knows that it can ' t give_up . Company executives say that unless American companies fight to build positions in the Japanese market , they will eventually face trouble at_home . Motorola was one of the first American companies to recognize this . In 1978 , Bob Galvin , then Motorola ' s chief_executive , led the company ' s senior executives on a retreat to assess the company ' s prospects . Things didn ' t look good . Japan ' s blitzkrieg attack on U.S. television markets in the late 1960s and early 1970s had so devastated the market that Motorola had been forced to sell its last defect-plagued television factory to rival Matsushita in 1974 . Motorola ' s CB radio business was also demolished by Japanese competition . Motorola responded by moving_up into such high-tech sectors as semiconductors , computers and telecommunications . But the Japanese government had targeted the same businesses , and Japan was already pushing American semiconductor firms out of the important computer-memory market . The Motorola executives returned from the retreat with a clear goal : Stop Japan Inc. There would be no more short-term thinking . Investments that would help win market share_in Japan would no longer have to meet the return-on-investment criteria required for investments elsewhere in the world . &quot; We decided that if we allowed Japan to maintain the sanctuary ( of its domestic market ) , they would be able to generate profits at_home to put us out of business , &quot; says Brenner . The strategy paid_off in spades . As a result of pursuing Japan ' s pager market , for example , Motorola learned that its quality wasn ' t what it thought . &quot; They thought their defect levels were world class , &quot; says David Yoffie , who wrote a case study on Motorola for Harvard Business_School . &quot; They discovered Japanese defect levels were lower than they ever thought necessary or even possible. &quot; To catch_up , Motorola launched a corporate-wide quality improvement program . Today Motorola is the leader in Japan in pager sales . Its extensive presence in Japan helped win the customer trust needed to put Motorola microprocessors at the heart of such Japanese products as Sony Camcorders and Canon cameras . * Motorola also strived to shore_up its defenses . In the early 1980s , it moved aggressively to file dumping charges against imports of Japanese pagers and cellular_phones . The moves resulted in duties of up_to 106 % on products from Japanese companies such_as Matsushita . Motorola went_to work_on public_opinion , too . In controversial ads , it boasted of its improved quality and complained about unfair Japanese trade practices . &quot; They recaptured the old ' What ' s good for General Motors is good for America ' feeling , &quot; says Michael Borrus , a researcher at the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy . The most grueling confrontation has been over Motorola ' s efforts to get a fair share of the market for cellular_phones , an area where Japan has already made major inroads in the U.S. market . The first barriers in the early 1980s were testing and certification standards that were designed to favor Japanese products already on the market . * By 1986 , after years of pressure , Motorola ' s cellular standard , which conformed_to systems used in the West , was approved . Coincidentally , the Japanese government chose to allow competition in the cellular market -- competition Japanese style . When Motorola joined with a Japanese partner to offer alternate cellular services , it was only allowed to install its system in western Japan , which represents about 40 % of the Japanese population . NTT ' s system would operate throughout Japan . And a new carrier called IDO , made_up of such well-connected corporations as Toyota Motors and NEC , was given a license to operate in the rest of Japan . The results were even less fair than they appeared . Since IDO adopted the NTT system ( built by NEC ) , its cellular_phones could now be used anywhere in the nation . Motorola ' s phones could not even be used in such key centers of business as Tokyo and Nagoya . Again Motorola complained . Through the intervention of the U.S._government , the company won in 1987 the right to expand its territory . Still , the company could not offer its services in the Tokyo-Nagoya corridor . The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications ( MPT ) insisted there was not enough radio bandwidth for an additional system . The following year , however , when the MPT quietly offered frequencies to a well-connected Japanese firm to offer cellular services on taxis , Motorola shouted foul . This time , Motorola filed an official complaint , taking_advantage of the new 1988 Omnibus Trade_bill . That bill authorized the U.S. trade representative to retaliate against partners with persistent unfair trading practices . Time was of_the_essence . Motorola has just introduced the MicroTac , a cellular_phone smaller and a third lighter than any Japanese product available . It was a rare competitive advantage and Motorola wanted to move while it still held the lead . Responding to Motorola ' s complaint , the U.S. trade representative cited Japan in 1989 for limiting U.S. entry into Japanese markets . Duties of 100 % could be applied on Japanese telecommunications_equipment if negotiations failed to resolve the conflict . Japan finally caved during last-minute negotiations in a Washington , D.C. , hotel_room between Japanese power_broker Ichiro Ozawa and freshman U.S. trade representatives consulting repeatedly over the phone with Motorola executives on how to proceed . IDO reluctantly accepted the compromise . But then the company dragged its feet when it came_to implementation . The Japanese Postal Ministry , which had forced the compromise on IDO , told complaining Motorola officials that it was now a strictly private issue and the ministry could do nothing . By last year , IDO still hadn ' t built enough transmitters to cover even half of the Tokyo region . Few customers wanted to buy phones that could only be used in parts of the city . Consequently , while the Motorola joint_venture in western Japan had a 50 % share of the market , in Tokyo , Motorola ' s share was a skimpy 1 % . After months more of frustrating negotiations the U.S. Trade representative just last week set a Feb . 15 deadline for IDO to offer an acceptable plan . The deadline passed . Coincidentally , it was the day after Clinton ' s failed summit_meeting with Japanese Prime_Minister Hosokawa . Clinton used the opportunity to send Japan a message by threatening sanctions . Meanwhile , Motorola says it is losing both time and money . From April this year , Japan will allow cellular_phone makers to sell their products directly through retail_stores instead of from carriers . &quot; We believe_in April there will be a tremendous rush to purchase cellular_phones , &quot; says Brenner . Since Motorola covers only a small portion of Tokyo , &quot; We will lose much of that initial thrust . Once a subscriber chooses a system it is twice as expensive to get him back. &quot; Motorola is demanding that IDO make the necessary investments to cover the Tokyo area within a year instead of the three years it plans . Motorola ' s decision to put itself once again in the middle of a potential trade war was not an easy one . Last year , Motorola ' s sales in Japan totaled close to $ 1 billion . Many American companies would have chosen not to risk its relationships in Japan by becoming the center of a trade dispute . &quot; There is always the risk of a backlash , &quot; says Brenner . &quot; This is not the Japanese way. &quot; But the upside is also great . Brenner figures the company ' s sales in Japan would be 250 % higher if Motorola ' s share of the Japanese market was as high as its share of other overseas markets . Some U.S. companies &quot; are willing to accept the scraps , &quot; says Brenner . &quot; When the market is this big , the scraps are juicy. &quot; But Motorola ' s brash , in-your-face trade_policies have won it respect , if not universal admiration . &quot; In Japan , cowards die many times over while the valiant get respect , &quot; says John Stern , head of the American Electronic Industry Assn. ' s Asia office in Tokyo . Whatever happens in this latest confrontation , says Stern , Motorola has established itself as a company that can ' t be pushed_around . Said Stern : &quot; Motorola has become someone who has to be included when decisions are made. &quot;</TEXT>
