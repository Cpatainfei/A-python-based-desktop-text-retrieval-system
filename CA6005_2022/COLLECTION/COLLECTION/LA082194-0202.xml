   <TEXT> I t was a cozy coincidence , even by Hollywood standards , a tantalizing partner-swapping involving four of TV ' s hottest stars taking a vacation hiatus to the big screen . &quot; Mad About You &quot; stars Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt , Emmy nominees for best actor and actress in a comedy series , were busy filming feature projects in Los Angeles and New York respectively , opposite fellow nominees Amy Brenneman and David Caruso from &quot; NYPD Blue. &quot; Reiser stars in &quot; Bye Bye , Love , &quot; above , a 20th Century Fox comedy due next year about divorced fathers ; he plays opposite Brenneman , nominated for best supporting actress in a drama for her work in &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; on which she played David Caruso ' s ex-lover . Meanwhile Hunt plays Caruso ' s wife in Barbet Schroeder ' s &quot; Kiss of Death , &quot; right , a crime thriller also for Fox . Caruso , nominated for best actor in a drama for &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; plays a man forced to infiltrate the New York criminal world . Of the apparent mate-swapping , Reiser says , &quot; Actually , it wasn ' t so_much of a coincidence -- first they offered me a nomination ( and ) I said ' No thanks. ' Then they told me Helen Hunt , David Caruso and Amy Brenneman would get one . . . . &quot; Robert Levine</TEXT>
