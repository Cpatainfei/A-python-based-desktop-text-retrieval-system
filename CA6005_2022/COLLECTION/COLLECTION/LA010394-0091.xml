   <TEXT> Led by &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; with Robin Williams and Sally Field , and &quot; The Pelican Brief &quot; with Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington , the motion_picture business ended 1993 with a rousing week at the ticket_windows -- a week that pushed the year ' s box-office gross to a record high . Depending_on which box-office sources one consults , the box-office &quot; year &quot; ended a week ago , ended Friday , or will end in a_few days . But on one point all agree : It was a record year . Veteran analyst A . D . Murphy of the Hollywood Reporter said the 1993 total gross hit $ 5.2 billion , beating the former record of $ 5.03 billion set_in 1989 . The results reversed the downward trend of 1990 , 1991 and 1992 . The final week of 1993 and the New Year ' s Day weekend ending Sunday were among the best of the year , with some analysts saying the total gross of $ 165 million to $ 170 million will be among the best ever for a seven-day period . The 20th Century Fox release of &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire , &quot; which has been in release since late November , scored a huge $ 17 million for the weekend . Warner Bros. ' &quot; The Pelican Brief &quot; earned $ 12.5 million . The year also will be remembered as the year of &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; Steven Spielberg ' s dazzling tale of a dinosaur theme park that goes_out of control . In 1993 , seven movies ( &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; &quot; In the Line_of_Fire , &quot; &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; &quot; The Firm , &quot; &quot; Sleepless in Seattle , &quot; &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; and &quot; Indecent Proposal &quot; ) surpassed the magical $ 100-million mark at the box_office , compared with eight during 1992 . But in 1992 the biggest film was &quot; Batman Returns &quot; with $ 163 million . In 1993 , &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; alone grossed twice that amount . With its $ 339-million gross to date in the United States and Canada , the Spielberg film is the equivalent of at least two blockbusters . ( &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; still has not surpassed Spielberg ' s reigning box-office champ in the United States and Canada , &quot; E.T. , &quot; with an estimated $ 359-million gross in its initial release . But , worldwide , &quot; Jurassic &quot; is the king , with a gross of $ 531.4 million , for a total to date of $ 870.4 million. ) &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; was just the kind of movie that theater owners dream about . It drew huge crowds and played for months . The longer a movie plays , the bigger the share of the gross that goes_to the theaters , the less to the studios . Late last week , veteran Southern California movie exhibitor James Edwards Sr . of the Orange County-based Edwards Cinemas chain was reflecting on 1993 , and he recalled a Hollywood truism : &quot; There ' s nothing wrong with the movie business that a good movie won ' t cure. &quot; At least a dozen popular movies fit that category during the year , Edwards recalled . &quot; In my 60 years in the business , I ' ve never seen a string of strong box-office movies as we had last summer. &quot; * In addition to the blockbusters , there was also robust business in 1993 for a_few specialized titles , said Gary Meyer , president of the Landmark Theater chain that is owned by the Samuel Goldwyn Co . Among the better performing titles were Goldwyn ' s release of Kenneth Branagh ' s widely hailed adaptation of &quot; Much Ado About Nothing , &quot; which grossed $ 23 million , and &quot; The Wedding Banquet &quot; with a gross of $ 6 million . Miramax Films did_well with &quot; Like Water for Chocolate , &quot; with a gross approaching $ 20 million , and &quot; The Piano , &quot; which has accumulated $ 13 million to date . Sony Pictures Classics scored with about a $ 12-million gross on &quot; Howards End , &quot; the 1992 Oscar-nominated movie that played strongly in the first_quarter of 1993 . If 1993 produced some major original hit movies , it was also a year that was unkind to sequels -- with the exception of the current family film &quot; Beethoven ' s 2nd &quot; from Universal . That was a major difference from 1992 . At the end that year , the top three grossing movies were sequels -- &quot; Batman Returns , &quot; &quot; Home Alone 2 &quot; and &quot; Lethal Weapon 3. &quot; At the end of 1993 , there is nary a sequel in the top 10 . Most ' 93 sequels -- including the much-anticipated Disney / Touchstone &quot; Sister Act 2 &quot; and Paramount Pictures ' &quot; Wayne ' s World 2 &quot; and &quot; Addams Family Values &quot; -- didn ' t live_up_to expectations . Only a year ago , &quot; Sister Act &quot; and &quot; Wayne ' s World &quot; were_on the list of the top 10 grossing films of 1992 ; &quot; Addams Family &quot; was a $ 113-million grossing picture from 1991 . &quot; Sister Act 2 , &quot; despite a big New Year ' s weekend , has grossed only $ 40 million to date ; &quot; Wayne ' s World 2 , &quot; $ 39 million ; and &quot; Addams Family Values , &quot; $ 45 million . Successful sequels generally perform about two-thirds as well as the original ; none of these has come_close . It was also a year of some major turkeys -- a year when even box-office champ Arnold Schwarzenegger took a free fall_in the over-hyped dud &quot; Last Action Hero. &quot; That costly , action- and effects-laden movie from Columbia Pictures eventually drew $ 50.2 million but could not overcome the negative rap that it simply did not work and possibly has not even recouped its $ 80 million estimated cost . In international markets the movie eventually grossed about $ 102 million , for a total of $ 150.2 million -- but only about half of which is returned to the studio as film rentals . The current &quot; Geronimo : An American Legend , &quot; also from Columbia , is estimated to have cost at least $ 40 million to produce and has grossed only $ 15.2 million after a month in release and despite the studio ' s pride in the film . &quot; Everyone really liked the picture and we are surprised by the results , &quot; said Columbia ' s Jeff Blake , president of domestic distribution . The Wesley Snipes and Sylvester Stone &quot; Demolition Man &quot; from Warner Bros . also ranks among the year ' s biggest losers . With a costly production estimated by some sources at well_over $ 50 million , the film took_in about $ 56 million -- only about half of which goes_back to the studio . Even such popular stars as Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood appearing together in &quot; A Perfect World &quot; didn ' t fare well , proving that perfect casting doesn ' t necessarily make_for a perfect world at the box_office . The skimpy gross for the Warner Bros . release has been $ 29 million . On the other hand , it was a great_year for Clint Eastwood , the director and star of the 1992 Oscar winning &quot; Unforgiven , &quot; which did big box-office in the first_quarter of 1993 , and his artistic and box-office success in summer ' s &quot; In the Line_of_Fire , &quot; one of Columbia ' s bright spots in a generally slow year for that studio . And Stallone , despite &quot; Demolition Man , &quot; scored what was considered a comeback with TriStar Picture ' s &quot; Cliffhanger , &quot; which ranked among the year ' s top 10 . The year ' s most profitable movie will certainly be &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; with eventual earnings of as much as $ 2 billion , including home video and related products . Other winners include Warner Bros. ' &quot; Free Willy , &quot; with a $ 25-million budget and $ 77 million in domestic gross , and &quot; Sleepless in Seattle &quot; with a budget of $ 25 million to $ 30 million and $ 125.1 million in gross . For all_the talk_of 1993 being the year of family films , the only true &quot; family film &quot; among the top 10 is &quot; Free Willy. &quot; Not a single film on the top 10 was from Disney ; the closest it came was with &quot; Cool Runnings , &quot; which cost under $ 10 million and has grossed $ 59.3 million . * The last week of 1993 , ending with the New Year ' s weekend , was among the best the industry has ever recorded . After &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; and &quot; Pelican Brief &quot; in first and second place , the weekend ' s No . 3 and No . 4 films look_to be in a dead_heat : &quot; Tombstone &quot; and &quot; Sister Act 2 , &quot; with about $ 8.5 million each . &quot; Grumpy Old_Men , &quot; came_in fifth with $ 7.8 million . After that : &quot; Beethoven ' s 2nd , &quot; $ 7.1 million ; &quot; Wayne ' s World 2 , $ 3.9 million ; &quot; The Piano , &quot; $ 2.3 million ; &quot; Geronimo , &quot; $ 2.1 million , and &quot; Ghost in the Machine , &quot; $ 1.5 million . In limited release : &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; did $ 1.4 million on 76 screens ; &quot; Philadelphia , &quot; $ 150 # 000 on four screens ; &quot; Six Degrees of Separation , &quot; $ 210 # 000 on 19 screens ; &quot; Shadowlands , &quot; $ 61 # 000 on three screens ; and &quot; The Summer_House , &quot; $ 300 # 000 on 60 screens . Although ticket prices are somewhat higher than they were in 1989 , the number of tickets sold in 1993 was the highest since 1989 , reversing a three-year decline . In 1989 the number of tickets sold was 1.13 billion . Using Murphy ' s $ 5.2 billion figure , and the Motion_Picture Assn . of America ' s figure on average ticket price of $ 5.09 , the number of tickets sold in 1993 would be about 1.01 billion -- up from 964.2 million in 1992 but still down from 1989 . Daily Variety reports in today ' s editions that the year was a record $ 5.04 billion . Variety analyst Leonard Klady , who uses Dec . 31 as the cutoff date for the year ( rather than a box-office week , which would run_through this coming Thursday ) , said his figures show that 1993 beat the previous record of $ 4.6 billion set_in 1992 . At the Top in ' 93 The top-grossing films in the United States and Canada released last year : 02 # 29 , 19 Movie ( Company ) Gross in millions 1 . &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; $ 339 ( Universal ) 2 . &quot; The Fugitive &quot; $ 179 ( Warner Bros. ) 3 . &quot; The Firm &quot; $ 158.3 ( Paramount ) 4 . &quot; Sleepless in Seattle &quot; $ 126.4 ( Sony / TriStar ) 5 . &quot; Mrs .
