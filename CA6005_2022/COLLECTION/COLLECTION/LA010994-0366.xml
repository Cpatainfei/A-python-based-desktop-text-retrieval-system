   <HEADLINE> LOW-TECH PROBLEMS WITH HIGH-TECH PATENTS ; TECHNOLOGY : INNOVATIONS IN COMPUTER SOFTWARE HAVE CREATED A FLOOD OF APPLICATIONS , PRODUCING STRAIN AND CONTROVERSY AT THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As its technology grows more pervasive and valuable , the computer_industry -- which once largely spurned patents -- is racing to the warrens of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office , where workers still rummage through wooden boxes to find some documents . IBM Corp . -- which once went so far as_to publish a list of several thousand computer discoveries it had not patented -- has won 368 patents for computer digital processing systems in the last three years . That compares to 128 from 1980 through 1982 . Digital Equipment Corp. , which received just three U.S. patents for computer_systems as recently as 1986 , got 64 in that category in 1992 . But the rush of high-technology invention has sometimes produced controversial results at the 203-year-old patent_office , which was established by President George_Washington in 1790 at the urging of James_Madison and Charles Pinckney . Patents give inventors legal protection to profit from their ideas . And by systematically recording new inventions -- then releasing them to the public after the inventors ' limited rights have expired -- the patent_office has also helped foster science and industry . But plowing through the astounding growth in patent_applications has strained the government ' s bureaucracy . As evidence of the burden , critics cite a number of recent computer patent controversies , including the office ' s recent decision to re-examine a broad patent on multimedia technology it had just issued to Compton ' s New Media of Carlsbad , in San Diego County . &quot; A lot of people feel that the patent_office does not have the breadth of information available to them to assess these submissions , &quot; said Alan D . Sugarman , president of Hyperlaw , a computer publisher of federal_court opinions . &quot; A lot of the innovations in the software field are never published in journals , as is the case with other fields , &quot; Sugarman said . &quot; A computer_program either works or it doesn ' t work . You don ' t need the certification of your peers to prove that. &quot; In its 13 nondescript Arlington , Va. , buildings , the patent_office is only slowly shedding the horse-and-buggy technology it has used for more_than two centuries to maintain what amounts to the world ' s biggest filing_cabinets . Direct electronic filing of patent_applications , which the agency has been working_on for nearly a decade to reduce its mountain of paperwork , is still months -- if not years -- away . Even in its paper files , the office has little background on computer software inventions , acknowledges the head of the agency , Patent Commissioner Bruce A . Lehman . &quot; The computer_industry does not have a history of publication , &quot; he said . On the contrary , Lehman noted , inventors have &quot; relied_on trade secrecy &quot; to maintain their competitive advantage in the computer_industry . * But Pryor A . Garnett , a patent attorney for IBM , said that while the patent_office has its work cut_out in understanding any new technology , its struggle to master computer software has been particularly arduous . &quot; Every new technology that has come_along -- from electricity to chemistry , biotechnology and now software -- has created a learning curve in the patent_office in its early stages , &quot; said Garnett , who is also a board_member of the Ann Arbor , Mich.-based Software Patent Institute . &quot; The issues presented by software-related invention have challenged the patent_office to improve its capabilities. &quot; The agency has been working with Software Patent Institute , a private , university-affiliated educational group , to expand its history of patent software invention . It has also been installing dual-screen computers , which examiners can use to view patent drawings and text simultaneously . But the office is still saddled with limited computer searching capability and a staff that is short of experienced software examiners . Potential candidates can earn far more in the private sector than the $ 28 # 000 to $ 60 # 000 annual salary offered by the government . The turmoil at the patent_office comes as the mass merchandising of personal_computers has reached a fever pitch amid talk_of a worldwide &quot; information highway. &quot; Computer software innovation -- which has sprung from the garages of American nerds as well as such outposts as India and Taiwan -- has produced a multibillion-dollar industry that is also helping increase worker productivity . But the industry has moved ahead at such breakneck speed that inventors have had little time or inclination to document their work . Indeed , the patent_office used to reject software claims as unpatentable mathematical algorithms -- until the U.S. Supreme Court in 1981 declared it legal to patent software . The legal protection granted by the court has attracted keen interest from companies around the globe . Securing a patent on a widely used technology -- such_as an essential aspect of a computer_program -- is the financial equivalent of winning the lottery . A U.S. patent gives the holder 17 years of exclusive_rights to sell an innovation in the world ' s largest market . So valuable is the patent_right that 400 applications are contested in court each year , even though legal_fees for such cases can exceed $ 500 # 000 . * Losers can pay dearly . Two years ago , for example , Eastman Kodak Co . paid Polaroid Corp . $ 925 million to settle a 15-year-old legal battle over instant photography patents . &quot; Most patented inventions are never used commercially , &quot; Garnett said . &quot; But for those that are , a patent can be immensely valuable -- upward of tens of millions of dollars. &quot; The patent_office launched its unusual patent re-examination last month after the government was besieged by complaints about the multimedia patent it granted in August to Compton ' s New Media Inc. , a unit of Chicago-based Tribune Co. , and Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc. Critics said the office gave the two companies near-total credit for a technology said to be already widely used in the software business . The decision came only a month after privately owned Online Resources &amp; Communications in McLean , Va. , attracted notice for winning what its president called &quot; a very broad patent &quot; that apparently covers any at-home transaction in which consumers debit their bank_accounts through an automated teller network . Similarly , three years ago , inventor Gilbert Hyatt -- more_than a decade after microprocessors spawned the personal_computer revolution -- won a patent covering &quot; a computer on a chip. &quot; Although Hyatt ' s patent was based on a series of applications dating_back to 1970 , the award sparked a firestorm of criticism . Patent expert Paul Heckel is one of many who blames the lack of extensive documentation of previous discoveries in the field . &quot; Because people didn ' t patent software , little of the prior art is disclosed in patents , &quot; and so the background cannot easily be searched , said Heckel , who has testified before Congress , written several books on the issue and is president of_his_own small Los Altos , Calif. , software company , Hyper Racks . &quot; Without a good library of prior art to refer to , the patent_office has issued many patents that will prove to be invalid or of limited scope , &quot; Heckel said . Patent Commissioner Lehman acknowledges the obstacles his agency faces : &quot; Many of our customers are very unhappy with the present system , and we have an obligation to do something about it. &quot; Besides re-examining Compton ' s controversial multimedia patent , Lehman said , he has launched hearings to determine how the patent_office can best meet the challenge of evaluating new technology . The self-analysis undoubtedly will underscore the fundamental differences between the American patent_system and those overseas . * Under the U.S. system , a patent is awarded to whoever first conceives of an invention . In Japan and Western Europe , a patent is granted to the inventor who files at the patent_office first . What ' s more , pending patent_applications are kept secret in the United States , while in Japan and Europe , applications are disclosed within 18 months to allow others to challenge them . In 1992 , a 15-member advisory commission set_up by President George_Bush recommended modifying U.S. patent laws so they would be more in_line with those of other countries . The recommendations grew out of U.S. negotiations with the World Intellectual Property Organization , a global standards-setting body . Patent law reform was also a heated topic of debate in the recently completed General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations . So far , none of the talks have produced substantial changes in U.S. patent law . But an aide to Sen . Dennis DeConcini ( D-Ariz. ) said DeConcini plans to reintroduce a measure that would grant patent_rights to the first to file . He unsuccessfully introduced a similar measure in 1992 . For his part , Lehman said he will move cautiously to institute reforms , contending that the government &quot; must listen to our clients -- inventors -- better . &quot; We want a system , &quot; he said , &quot; that will help foster creativity , not hinder it. &quot; The Long and Winding Road A bright idea may take only moments to conceive ; the real work comes_in trying to secure patent protection . Here , in outline , are the steps involved : 1 . Spend thousands of dollars -- or more -- to develop an idea . 2 . Spend even more to conduct a search of government and scientific files to find_out if the invention is really unique . 3 . Pay the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office an application fee of $ 355 ( $ 710 for companies employing more_than 500 people ) and submit papers that describe the invention and illustrate of the idea . 4 . Wait . It takes an average of 20 months for overworked government bureaucrats to review each application . During that time , the Patent_Office can ask_for more documentation . On rare occasions , the agency requires an applicant to produce a working model . 5 . The patent is issued , offering 17 years of exclusive_rights to the design , idea or product . 6 . After issuance , the inventor periodically pays so-called patent maintenance fees that total about $ 7 # 000 over the life of the patent .</TEXT>
