   <HEADLINE> EASY RAWLINS , JUST A LITTLE OLDER ; BLACK BETTY , BY WALTER MOSLEY ( W.W. NORTON : $ 19.95 ; 255 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1961 , John F . Kennedy was president of the United States , Martin_Luther_King was leading civil_rights demonstrators in Alabama and Georgia , and Easy Rawlins was searching for Black Betty out of South Central Los Angeles . &quot; Black Betty &quot; is Walter Mosley ' s latest novel , and Easy Rawlins is his private_eye , just as Phillip Marlowe was alter_ego for Raymond Chandler in that same city , and Sam Spade served that purpose for Dashiell Hammet four_hundred and some miles farther north in San Francisco . I mention Chandler and Hammett and their private_detectives , Marlowe and Spade , because I think Mosley and Rawlins fit that mold . The writer and his private_eye are tough , shrewd , and knowledgeable_about their cities , and they know the things , the good and the bad , that makes those cities move . Easy Rawlins is raising two adopted children -- Jesus , a little Mexican boy he rescued from a brothel , and Feather , a little_girl of mixed black_and_white parentage , and Easy is doing all he can as a single parent to bring them up well . Easy is originally from the South and he cooks his children scrambled eggs , grits and bacon for breakfast , and hamburgers at night -- when he is at_home . When he is in the streets searching for Black Betty , an assignment offered him by Saul Lynx , a white private_detective of suspicious honesty ( who thinks Rawlins can get more information than he in black South Central L.A. ) , then Easy Rawlins can be as tough with the bad_guys as he is tender with his children who are always on his mind . He keeps reminding himself that he ought to give_up this line_of_work and get a regular job to support himself and his two children -- but at present he needs the money that Saul Lynx is paying him to find Black Betty . There are two or three stories going_on in the novel , and it can become a little annoying , especially when you can ' t make the connection . But the writing is so good , and the characters that Mosley is constantly introducing are so interesting that you can ' t put the book down . Mosley describes people and things very well , and he has a tremendous ear for dialogue . His description of the homes of the haves and have nots of Los Angeles , and his description of that hot Santa Ana wind , and of the desert ( of a single flower in the desert ) is as_good_as you would find in Chandler at his best . And his dialogue is just as good , whether he is dealing with the hoods in the street , or the police , or children , or matrons in their grand Beverly Hills mansions . In his search for Black Betty , Easy Rawlins comes_up against more bad people than anyone should have to meet . Saul Lynx is a shadowy figure himself , but he is only a shadow compared to some of the others who are real , evil and brutal . The little men all have guns , and the big ones use their muscles . Mouse is small and he is just out of jail . He is looking_for someone to kill , and Easy Rawlins is_on his short_list . Easy has to prove to Mouse that he was not responsible_for sending him to jail . Mouse only half believes him , so Easy has to find the real culprit . Another bad_guy is &quot; Commander &quot; Stiles of the Los Angeles police_department , who likes getting information with his fist when you are not expecting it , and , even if you are , you are surprised at his sudden move . Then there is Calvin Hodge , the Texas lawyer who represents the people who are trying to find Black Betty . Hodge likes to call the 41-year-old black detective &quot; boy , &quot; and he has the size and build to back_up his words . There are others , just as cruel , and they leave enough dead_bodies to prove it . After all this , I was mildly disappointed when I first met Black Betty . Maybe I expected too_much , too many drums and trumpets . She does not sing an aria , nor does she give us a soliquy . But what she does is wrap_up things . There are a couple more little murders on the side after she comes_on stage , but she gives us the answers to the main story , which is why she had to leave the mansion after a sudden_death in the family . But Mosley is not quite satisfied that Black Betty has given us all_the answers . He feels that we need to know more about the remaining characters , and I think he did this hurriedly . He felt that he needed to tell us more about Mouse and some of the others when I don ' t think it was necessary . This novel can be read as a simple detective_story , and it can be seen as a comment on a_people , place and time , as any good piece of fiction should be . Though the civil_rights movement in the South is hardly ever mentioned -- and certainly no character speaks_to prophesy the Watts Riots -- Easy Rawlins and other blacks in South Central suffer many of the same indignities that their / our brothers were suffering in the Southern part of the United States at that same time . Maybe this is what Mosley was doing , using the search for Black Betty as a means to let Easy Rawlins show us the L.A. of 1961 -- while predicting what could happen 30 years later . I would n ' t go so far as_to say that that is the meaning of the book , but all_the undercurrents are there . Blacks play subordinate roles in all cases , unless they are in their own neighborhood . There are lines that separate the poor from the well-off , and there are cops to enforce that rule . The explosion happened in ' 62 , but the pot had been simmering 30 years earlier and more . Easy Rawlins is 41 now after this fourth book , and he is tired . He wishes to spend more time with his two adopted children , and less time beating_up , and being beatened up , by the bad people . But I along with thousands of others hope he doesn ' t give_up the private_eye business altogether . Marlowe was good , but he gave us information from one point_of_view , the white point_of_view . Easy Rawlins has access to places Marlowe would not dare tread . I like Marlowe and I like Spade -- but we need Easy out there . Look_after your children , Easy -- but don ' t forget us . They Leave You Alone in L.A. Here , in an excerpt from Walter Mosley ' s &quot; Black Betty , &quot; is the Los Angeles Easy Rawlins lives in : You could tell by some people ' s houses that they came_to L.A. to live_out their dreams . Home is not a place to dream . At home you had to do like your father did and your mother . Home meant that everybody already knew what you could do and if you did the slightest little thing different they ' d laugh you right down into a hole . You lived_in that hole . Festered in t . After a while you either accepted your hole or you got_out of it . There were all kinds of ways_out . You could get_married , get drunk , get next to somebody ' s wife . You could take a shotgun and eat it for a midnight snack . Or you could move to California . In California they would n ' t laugh_at you , or anybody . In California the sun shone three hundred and more days in the year . In California you could work until you dropped . And when you got_up there was another job waiting for you . In California you could paint the slats of your house like a rainbow and put a smiling face on your front_door . You could have a caged rabbit and chickens right out_in the yard and big granite animals for children to climb_on . You could , like Georgette Harris , put a sign_on your wire gate saying &quot; Little Animals Nursery_School and Day Care. &quot; Nobody cared . Nobody asked you , &quot; What makes you a schoolteacher ? &quot; They ' d just take you at your word . And if the law came_down and asked_for some papers you ' d just move a mile or so further on , hang_up the same sign , and collect children like a crow taking_in glass . * Times Link : 808-8463 To hear Walter Mosley reading from &quot; Black Betty , &quot; call TimesLink and press * 7818 .
