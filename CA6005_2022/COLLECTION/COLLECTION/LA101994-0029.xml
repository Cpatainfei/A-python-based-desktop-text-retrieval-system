   <HEADLINE> INITIATIVE WOULD HASTEN SPREAD OF TB , STUDY SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A study released today predicts that passage of Proposition 187 , the anti-illegal immigrant initiative , will hasten the spread of tuberculosis in California because immigrants will be afraid of contacts with medical authorities . The research , led by a USC team and based on data gathered_in Los Angeles County , already is fueling concerns in the medical_community that Proposition 187 will drive illegal immigrants underground because it would require health-care professionals to report undocumented immigrants to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service . &quot; If we were to try to implement ( Proposition 187 ) , we would decimate our clinics , &quot; said Dr. Shirley Fannin , who leads the public health fight against tuberculosis and other infectious_diseases as chief of disease control programs for Los Angeles County . &quot; The secret of not having these people become a problem to themselves or others is the early discovery and management of the disease . If you scare people away or make them frightened , they aren ' t going_to come_in early. &quot; Fannin said she also fears that passage of Proposition 187 could trigger the revival of other diseases , such_as long dormant strains of syphilis that haven ' t been common in California for 50 years , or lead to a re-emergence of the measles epidemic that peaked in 1990 and killed 41 Californians , 34 of them preschool-aged children . The new study found that under current law most undocumented immigrants with tuberculosis believe that they are safe from deportation when they seek medical_care . Even so , 6 % of those with active tuberculosis who told researchers that they did not have immigration documents said they delayed care because of fear that they would be reported to immigration authorities , said the authors of the study , published today in the Western Journal of Medicine . If a measure such_as Proposition 187 were to pass , that percentage would rise , leading to the spread of the disease , the scientists predicted . The authors said that &quot; any increase in the fear of immigration authorities &quot; by patients &quot; is likely to increase the delay between onset of symptoms and first contact with the medical_care system. &quot; &quot; Because each patient possibly exposes an average of 10 contacts to the disease during the course of delaying care , such an increase would spread tuberculosis beyond those who delay , &quot; the study said . The study , drafted by a team of USC and UCLA researchers led by Dr. Steven Asch , a faculty_member at the USC School_of_Medicine and an internist at County-USC Medical_Center , said that the longer people with active tuberculosis delay treatment , the more likely it is that they will spread the disease . The publication of the report just a_few weeks before the Nov . 8 election landed with a predictable political bang . Dr. Ralph Ocampo , president of the California Medical Assn. , a statewide organization of physicians opposed to Proposition 187 , cited the study in once again criticizing the measure for attempting to put physicians in a conflict_of_interest position with their patients by requiring doctors to report people they even suspect of being illegal immigrants to immigration authorities . &quot; Using health-care facilities at all as a detection site is immoral and flies in the face of what the medical_profession should stand_for all_over the world , which is that we take_care of sick and injured people first , &quot; said Ocampo , a San Diego surgeon . &quot; If there is a question about legal_status , let that be handled by the appropriate authorities but not by health-care professionals. &quot; Gov . Pete Wilson , an active supporter of Proposition 187 , said through a spokesperson that if the measure passes , he will continue to provide those services that are necessary to protect the public health . &quot; This is a problem that exists today and will exist in the future whether or not Proposition 187 passes or fails , &quot; said Leslie Goodman , an assistant chief_of_staff for Wilson . &quot; We don ' t know what the potential consequences might be. &quot; Goodman , who in the past has criticized opponents of the initiative for using scare tactics , said , &quot; You have to question the motivation of this group in putting_out this study. &quot; The journal is published by the California Medical Assn . and represents a consortium of 10 western states . Paul Moreno , a spokesman for the CMA , said the study was started 2 1 / 2 years ago , before Proposition 187 got_on the ballot . The report ' s authors do not cite Proposition 187 by name , but instead refer in the report to &quot; legislation &quot; and the &quot; immigration initiative. &quot; Among the questions researchers asked of the people they interviewed who had active tuberculosis was : &quot; Were you afraid going to the doctor might cause trouble with immigration authorities ? &quot; The researchers found that &quot; few patients feared that seeking care would result in difficulties with immigration authorities &quot; and that most seemed aware that health-care professionals did not report information on residency status to the Immigration and Naturalization Service . Fannin and other health-care professionals say they have spent years cultivating that trust . In the arena of public health , they say the reason for that is to protect society at_large as well as the individual . &quot; Disease does not check on someone ' s immigration status and the disease controller had better not , &quot; Fannin said . The issue is important because the study found that 71 % of the 313 patients who agreed to be interviewed reported that physicians discovered their tuberculosis when they sought care_for one of the classic TB symptoms : coughing , fatigue , fever , swollen glands or weight loss . The study examined 526 active cases of tuberculosis reported to the county ' s Tuberculosis Control Registry between April and September , 1993 . Researchers said the county was an ideal target for such a study because it &quot; lies at one of the epicenters of the tuberculosis epidemic -- second only to New York City. &quot; They said further that &quot; unlike the nation as_a_whole , immigrants make_up most of the active tuberculosis cases in Los Angeles. &quot; In its latest update , the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services said that 1 # 940 active cases of tuberculosis were reported in the county in 1993 . That figure is down from 1992 , when 2 # 198 cases were reported , but up dramatically from the 1 # 190 cases discovered in 1988 . Using phone_numbers and addresses from the county ' s Tuberculosis Control Registry , the researchers wrote and phoned people with TB . Because many are transients , efforts were made to track them down in soup_kitchens , shelters and a special clinic for the homeless . Ultimately , the researchers got the cooperation of 313 people , 69 % of whom were immigrants . One-fifth of the respondents said they were in the country illegally . &quot; Tuberculosis in Los Angeles County is definitely a disease of immigration , &quot; Asch said . Whether they came_into the country with the disease or picked it up here was unclear , he said .</TEXT>
