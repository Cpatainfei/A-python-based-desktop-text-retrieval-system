   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : LOS ANGELES COUNTY ; BLOCK URGES ILLEGAL RESIDENTS TO KEEP REPORTING CRIMES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Saying that &quot; a great_deal of uncertainty &quot; exists in immigrant communities because of the passage of Proposition 187 , Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block on Friday urged illegal immigrants to continue stepping forward if they are witnesses to or victims of crime . Those who are victims or witnesses are in no danger of investigation for possible deportation , Block said at a news_conference . Living_in the United States illegally remains a civil violation that is enforceable only by the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service , Block explained . Proposition 187 , which was overwhelmingly approved , does call_for people who are arrested on other offenses and cannot prove their legal residency to be reported to immigration authorities . But that section of the initiative , and most others , are enjoined by state and federal_courts . The Sheriff ' s Department does make available to the INS the names of those arrested who say they were born outside the United States . &quot; The procedures in place are the things we ' ve been doing forever , &quot; Block said . The sheriff said the one portion of Proposition 187 that has taken_effect -- new state statutes against the manufacture and use of fraudulent citizenship documents -- will be enforced &quot; on a uniform basis by all law_enforcement agencies in this county. &quot; Earlier this week , the county district_attorney ' s office filed felony charges against five Huntington Park-area men accused of manufacturing fake papers .</TEXT>
