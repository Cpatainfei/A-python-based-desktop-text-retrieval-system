   <HEADLINE> REPORT IS CRITICAL OF BERNSON USE OF FUNDS ; GOVERNMENT : AUDIT BY CITY ETHICS STAFF FINDS $ 158 # 000 IN QUESTIONABLE EXPENDITURES . COUNCILMAN BLAMES PROBLEM ON CONFUSION CREATED BY EMBEZZLEMENT BY A FORMER BOOKKEEPER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson used campaign funds to make more_than $ 158 # 000 in questionable expenditures , including tens of thousands of dollars spent for foreign travel and expensive dinners , according to a highly critical audit released Monday . The audit by the staff of the city Ethics Commission also could not find checks , receipts or other supporting documents to verify how at least another $ 700 # 000 in campaign funds was spent by two of seven campaign committees controlled by Bernson . &quot; You and the treasurer failed in your duty to exercise reasonable diligence &quot; in preparing accurate and complete campaign finance disclosure reports , the auditors concluded in a rebuke aimed at Bernson , who has represented the northwest San Fernando Valley since 1979 . The findings are being reported to the Ethics Commission enforcement staff , to the city attorney ' s office and to the state Fair Political Practices Commission , all_of which have responsibilities for enforcing campaign finance reform laws . Rebecca Avila , deputy director of the Ethics Commission , refused to speculate on what those agencies might do with the information . &quot; We ' re making no recommendation about what they should do , only providing them with our findings_of_facts , &quot; Avila said . &quot; It ' s up_to those agencies to determine if there ' s been violations of law. &quot; State and local campaign finance reform laws require accurate disclosure of contributions and expenditures and adherence to certain record-keeping standards , and prohibit funds from being spent for the personal , and in some instances political , benefit of the candidate . City law requires routine audits of candidates ' finance_committees . Meanwhile , Bernson and his staff complained that the audit findings largely ignored their explanations for many of the questionable expenditures . They blamed many of the financial gaps and fiscal confusion on the fact that Bernson ' s political bookkeeper embezzled $ 126 # 000 from three of his committees and then destroyed records to cover_up the theft . They also criticized the Ethics Commission for not giving Bernson more time to respond to the audit . &quot; They have been biased , hostile and antagonistic because I won ' t knuckle_under to ( Benjamin ) Bycel ( executive_director of the Ethics Commission ) and his dictatorial tactics , &quot; Bernson said . &quot; We had 45 days to respond to an audit that took them two years to do , &quot; said Grieg Smith , Bernson ' s chief deputy . The findings of this latest round of audits covered some ground previously explored by a state_attorney general ' s investigation that cleared Bernson of using campaign funds for personal benefit . However , Bernson acknowledged that the attorney_general ' s investigation did not cover three of the committees audited by the Ethics Commission that were found to have problems . Smith acknowledged that he and Bernson were unable to completely reply to the auditors findings regarding the two committees Bernson used to finance his 1991 reelection campaign because of a lack of time . Despite Bernson ' s claims that many of the problems can be traced to the embezzlement , the auditors noted that two committees were formed after that case had ended . &quot; Furthermore , for the committees which were embezzled , auditors found no discernible improvement in the committee ' s record-keeping after the embezzlement activity ceased , &quot; they added . In 1991 , Toni Lee Corpuel , a former bookkeeper for the accounting_firm Bernson used , was sentenced to a year in jail after being convicted of embezzling more_than $ 126 # 000 from Bernson ' s committees . The auditors ' report concluded that five of the seven committees they examined &quot; did not substantially comply &quot; with city and state campaign finance and reporting laws . Some of the key findings : * The audit of the Bernson Political Action Committee found that of the $ 521 # 475 spent , only $ 11 # 225 was spent to support other candidates or ballot measures . Political action committees , while not bound by any obligation to do so , are generally established by candidates to finance other candidates or causes . * The audit found $ 126 # 537 in expenditures by the Bernson PAC that were not readily explained in its campaign disclosure reports as meeting a governmental , legislative or political purpose , as required by law . The audit cited the brief explanations later offered by Bernson for each of the 82 questioned expenditures involved . Many of these expenditures were for meals or trips , including travel_to Rome , China and Hawaii to meet with emergency operations personnel in those areas and to Israel , according to Bernson . Some of the trips were made with Bernson ' s wife and children . In addition to the $ 8 # 079 in air-fare costs to China , including the cost of one staff_member , Bernson also charged this committee $ 106.45 for a &quot; tux for China trip &quot; and $ 105.97 to buy a &quot; luggage carrying case for governmental related travel. &quot; Bernson also tapped this account to pay $ 141.67 to &quot; repair VCR used in recording TV_programs about councilman or legislative activities. &quot; * Another audit noted that it could not determine if $ 30 # 905 spent by Bernson ' s officeholder committee was related to a legislative or governmental purpose , as required by law . Many of the questioned expenditures reported by this committee were for gifts and tickets to sporting events given to Bernson ' s staff , City_Hall personnel or constituents . In his official response to the audit , Bernson identified 30 of the 69 questioned expenditures as politically related although the Ethics Commission said money from such committees cannot be legally spent on such activities . In eight instances , Bernson offered no explanation for the expenditures , including ones for $ 2 # 680 at the Hollywood Bowl and $ 2 # 917 at Northridge Hill Liquor . * The audit of Bernson ' s two 1991 reelection committees concluded that the committee received $ 15 # 912 from 30 people or companies who gave more_than the $ 500-per-person limit allowed under the city law .</TEXT>
