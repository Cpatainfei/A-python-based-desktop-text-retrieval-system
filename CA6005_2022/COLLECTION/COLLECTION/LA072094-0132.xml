   <HEADLINE> BLOODY CROWBAR FOUND IN FAMALARO ' S HOUSE ; EVIDENCE : POLICE CONSIDER TOOL A POSSIBLE WEAPON IN DEATH OF DENISE HUBER . SEARCH EXPANDED IN ORANGE COUNTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A search of the country_club home of John Joseph Famalaro -- who has been charged with the murder of Denise A . Huber -- turned_up a bloodied crowbar that police consider a possible murder weapon as authorities expanded their search Tuesday in Orange County seeking further evidence . Still fearing other victims , authorities were successful in tracking_down at least five of nine women in Southern California and Phoenix whose names appeared on a list developed following a search at Famalaro ' s home . Detectives planned to appeal for the public ' s help Wednesday in locating the remaining people on the list , which included Huber ' s . Court documents filed Tuesday in Arizona indicated that police have seized numerous suspicious items from Famalaro ' s home , including articles of women ' s clothing , some of which appear to be stained with blood , a blood-tainted tarp and what police suspect might be the murder weapon . At the request of the prosecution , a judge on Tuesday agreed to hold Famalaro , 37 , without bond . He was previously held_in lieu of $ 250 # 000 bail . As the investigation continues , police are trying to determine whether the house_painter is connected with two murders in Phoenix and one in Sedona . &quot; The more we have delved into it , the stranger and more likely the aggravating factors , &quot; said Yavapai County Deputy Atty . Tom Lindberg . Robert Shoults , whose wife , Gloria , was_on the list , expressed surprise because their only connection with Famalaro was that they had sold him a van two years ago . The police , who called to check on Gloria ' s well-being , &quot; said that her name had turned_up on some papers they had found , &quot; said Shoults , of Dewey , Ariz . &quot; Having somebody like that in your neighborhood I guess does make your hair stand_up a little bit , because this is generally a quiet area. &quot; The revelations came days after the body of Huber , 23 at the time of her disappearance , was found in a freezer in the back of a stolen rental truck parked in Famalaro ' s driveway . The Newport Beach woman vanished three years ago after she became stranded on the Corona del Mar Freeway with a flat_tire . Huber was believed to have been bludgeoned to death , and a crowbar would be consistent with the type of weapon used , authorities said . In other developments Tuesday : * Authorities , who have not ruled_out additional suspects , said they want to question Famalaro ' s brother-in-law , Duane Thobe , and Famalaro ' s brother , Warren , in connection with the case . Warren Famalaro is a convicted child_molester . Two days before Huber ' s body was discovered , Thobe went_to the Arizona Public_Service and asked that the power to John Famalaro ' s home be shut_off , according to court documents . The next day , Famalaro ' s mother , Anne , requested that power be restored . * Police concluded a comprehensive search of Famalaro ' s home . Using axes , rakes and shovels , authorities Tuesday dug as far down as 10 feet below the surface in three areas of Famalaro ' s home where cadaver-sniffing dogs had &quot; alerted , &quot; but no new bodies were discovered . Investigators also expanded the search to other locations , including Sedona , where Famalaro once ran a handyman business . * In Orange County , police began visiting several storage_lockers Famalaro had rented and had stored the deep freezer in before moving to Arizona . Police went_to at least three local storage facilities Tuesday -- Trabuco Self Storage and Lake Forest Storage , among them , and an office in an industrial_park in Laguna Hills that Famalaro used for his painting business . Costa Mesa Detective Sgt . Jerry Holloway said investigators &quot; are finding some items of evidence that we can use , &quot; but he declined to elaborate . Investigators have also learned that people had been curious about the Ryder truck and the extension_cord running to it , but that when neighbors and acquaintances of Famalaro asked what was in the the freezer , he would reply , &quot; Meat. &quot; * Investigators are focusing_on reconstructing how Famalaro and Huber may have come_into contact the night of her disappearance , June 3 , 1991 , and his movements since . Although police said Tuesday they believe she was killed in Orange County shortly after her abduction and then transported via freezer , it may be difficult to fix a time and place of death because of the condition of her body . The freezer was purchased June 10 , 1991 , a week after Huber disappeared , at a Montgomery Ward &amp; Co . store in Orange County , according to documents filed by the Yavapai County attorney ' s office . Investigators also have not been able to explain why the corpse would have been carted around for years after the crime . &quot; that ' s what makes this case bizarre -- the way he moves a body around like this , &quot; said Costa Mesa Police Lt . Ron Smith . &quot; It doesn ' t make any sense. &quot; * Law_enforcement sources alternately discounted and were intrigued by the theory that Famalaro may have lured Huber to her death by posing as a law_enforcement officer . Two phony Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department shirts were among the numerous items seized from his home . Both shirts had handmade replicas of the Los Angeles County sheriff ' s official patches sewn on them . Costa Mesa ' s Lt . Smith said he thought Huber was &quot; too smart to fall_for such a thing. &quot; &quot; One thing that weighs against that theory is that it ' s very unusual to have a uniformed officer with long hair and a beard , &quot; Smith said , adding that everyone police have interviewed said Famalaro has sported a beard and mustache for years . Other law_enforcement sources found the bogus-police theory credible , as did Huber ' s family . &quot; I couldn ' t believe that Denise would get_in a car with a stranger , &quot; Ione Huber , Denise ' s mother , said . &quot; This makes_sense . She would trust someone in a uniform. &quot; Discovery of the list of names initially fueled speculation that the murder of Huber could be one in a string of multiple killings . &quot; This case is far from over , &quot; said Yavapai County sheriff ' s spokeswoman Laurie Berra . &quot; We have to make_sure we don ' t have additional victims. &quot; Famalaro ' s attorney , Lawrence William Katz , attacked the strength of the case against his client and the media coverage . &quot; We don ' t have a serial_killer here , &quot; Katz said . &quot; This coverage has been completely overdone. &quot; Katz said he fully expects a grand_jury to indict Famalaro by Thursday . He vowed that he would immediately seek to overturn the indictment on the basis that excessive publicity has compromised the grand_jury -- the same tactic used by O.J. Simpson ' s lawyers in his murder case . If a grand_jury does not issue an indictment Thursday , as expected , Famalaro is scheduled to appear at a preliminary hearing on Friday . Search_warrant papers filed_in Arizona on Tuesday revealed that police confiscated an extensive array of potentially incriminating items from Famalaro ' s home during an exhaustive search last week . Besides the bloody crowbar , a number of seized items had crimson stains , including strips of white cloth , a tarp , tissue , a &quot; yellow paper bodysuit , &quot; a sweatshirt and articles of women ' s clothing . Authorities are awaiting the results of blood and fingerprint tests . Also found were purses , handcuffs , keys to handcuffs , numerous rolls of duct tape and masking tape , drug paraphernalia and other items of women ' s clothing that were not soiled with blood . They included a white blouse , a &quot; teddy &quot; and pantyhose , along with feminine napkins . Police also seized videotapes and photographs , which they declined to describe the content of , as well as directions on how to use the freezer Huber ' s body was found in ; two Rolodexes ; an answering machine ; hair samples ; numerous spent . 38-caliber cartridges ; and plastic bags . At least initially , the list of names -- including that of one man -- caused a scare , because police feared that Huber , whose name was_on the list , might have been just one victim . In the case of one woman , Susan Rose Baylard , police found her credit_cards and identification . They also found credit_cards belonging_to Deborah Clark . Both women , as have others on the list , have since been contacted by authorities and appear to be alive and well , authorities said . Police would not say what relationship , if any , the women had with Famalaro . In a_few cases , police have only a first_name -- &quot; Donna &quot; and &quot; Mary ' -- and are planning to solicit the public ' s help in identifying and locating the women . Robert Shoults , whose wife , Gloria , was_on the list , said in an interview Tuesday evening that they had had no contact with Famalaro since they sold him a van in 1992 . &quot; We didn ' t know him , &quot; Shoults said . &quot; When he bought the van from me he was new in town. &quot; When news broke of Famalaro ' s arrest , Shoults said &quot; it didn ' t ring a bell at all. &quot; But shortly thereafter , someone from the sheriff ' s department telephoned to check on his wife ' s well-being . As more details emerged about Famalaro , court documents released Tuesday also spelled_out how investigators made the grisly discovery last Wednesday . According to court records , a suspicious Elaine Canalia alerted authorities about the Ryder rental truck parked at Famalaro ' s home last Wednesday . Canalia told Phoenix police that on the afternoon of July 9 she was at the Prescott Valley Flea_Market where she met Famalaro , who was peddling paint . When Famalaro took her to his house , she became suspicious of the truck , in part , because it was covered with a tarp . She jotted_down the truck ' s license_plate number and vehicle identification_number and gave it to the Phoenix police , who turned the information over to the Yavapai County Sheriff ' s Office . When sheriff ' s officials responded to his house , they noticed a number of paint cans around the truck and suspected that the location might be a &quot; clandestine drug laboratory. &quot; After narcotics officers searched , they concluded it wasn ' t a drug lab , but planned to seize the truck because it had been reported stolen from a Ryder outlet in San Clemente . Attempts to contact Famalaro at the house were unsuccessful , so authorities contacted a locksmith to open the truck and the trailer . When they saw the 23-cubic-foot freezer , which was locked and taped shut , they decided it should be opened_to make_sure nothing valuable would perish when the power was turned_off . &quot; When the lid was opened , &quot; court documents say , &quot; a strong odor of a decomposed body struck Detective Mark Garcia . He then noticed in the freezer what was a large bundle of black plastic . Garcia then felt that plastic and felt what he determined was an arm to a body. &quot; Huber ' s body lay frozen in a semi-fetal position with the hands handcuffed behind her back . Detectives immediately quizzed neighbors , who said Famalaro had moved_into the house 1 1 / 2 years ago and that the Ryder truck had first appeared in January . At 3:30 p.m. that afternoon , Famalaro was stopped in a red 1994 Jeep Cherokee and was taken into custody for possession of the stolen truck . That day , police also recovered a white van with a bullet_hole that belongs_to Famalaro . According to investigators , the Ryder truck was rented Jan . 28 for one-day service . Ironically , it was reported stolen to the Orange County Sheriff ' s Department on July 12 , the day before Huber ' s body was discovered , due_to a &quot; foul-up &quot; in paperwork by Ryder . Piecing together what little they have , police suspect that Huber was killed , stored in the freezer in a Laguna Hills storage bin for a year , then moved to a San Clemente storage facility , where it was kept_in about a year and a half before being transported to Famalaro ' s Prescott Country_Club home . It remains unclear whether a trial , should there be one , would be held_in Orange County or Arizona . As prosecutors prepared_for a secret grand_jury proceeding or a possible preliminary hearing , they too expressed concern about the amount of attention the case had garnered , and possible tainting of the jury pool in this county of 120 # 000 people . Also unclear is how soon the family will be able to bury Huber in South_Dakota next to her grandfather . Her parents , Ione and Dennis Huber , said medical_examiners in Arizona told them Tuesday that they cannot release their daughter ' s body until they complete tested on two items believed to be the murder weapons , one of which is believed to be the bloody crowbar . &quot; Our funeral plans are up_in_the_air , but we don ' t want to pressure them , &quot; Ione Huber said . Throughout the day , the Hubers granted interviews to several television_stations , saying they were still trying keep their daughter ' s case , which has attracted national attention from the beginning , alive , and encouraging people with possible information about the suspect to come_forward . Famalaro ' s parents , meanwhile , paid a visit to their son in jail late Tuesday . Also listed as visiting him was a local bail bondsman . But late Tuesday he was still incarcerated . A jail official said Famalaro attended a religious &quot; rap_session &quot; Saturday night along with about two_dozen other inmates . The official said he did not talk_about himself but participated in the program by singing songs and hymns , which included &quot; Rock of Ages. &quot; He also asked_for a Catholic Bible . The official said he did not seem depressed , as he has been described by his attorney . Nick Faicchio Sr. , Famalaro ' s former roommate in Lake Forest , said Tuesday , &quot; I really think he just flipped . . . . &quot; One never knows anybody really , &quot; he said . &quot; How could you truly ? Be a mind_reader or something ? &quot; Times staff writers Anna Cekola , Leslie Berkman , Michael Granberry , Greg Hernandez , Matt Lait , Mark Landsbaum , David Reyes , Rebecca Trounson and Jodi Wilgoren , and correspondents Bob Elston , Shelby Grad and Jeffrey Bean contributed to this report . * MOMENT OF INTUITION : A decision to note a license_number was crucial to case .
