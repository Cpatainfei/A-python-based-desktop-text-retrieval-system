   <HEADLINE> HOMES ON-LINE -- CALL IT VIRTUAL REALTY ; TECHNOLOGY : THANKS TO ADVANCES IN ORANGE COUNTY AND THE VALLEY , MORE AND MORE CONSUMERS ARE REAL_ESTATE SHOPPING BY COMPUTER -- WITHOUT ALL THAT DRIVING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I want this one ! &quot; says 3-year-old Evan Donnelly , pointing to the color photograph of a tile-roofed house scrolling up_on his parents ' computer_screen . &quot; No , this house is too small -- I can tell , &quot; said Mary Donnelly , sitting with her son in their Yorba Linda bedroom and turning toward her husband , Brian . &quot; Go_to the next one , &quot; she said . With a click of the mouse , the computer brings_up another house matching the Donnellys ' list of preferences . The routine is a familiar one for the family , which spends its evenings shopping for their dream home -- without ever leaving Yorba Linda . Not keen on spending their weekends driving aimlessly through unfamiliar neighborhoods , the Donnellys use time after work &quot; visiting &quot; properties via computer , weeding_out obviously unsuitable houses . Using a CD-ROM program developed by a company in Brea , the couple say they have found a high-tech way to eliminate some of the tedium , frustration and stress from home buying . &quot; With two children , looking_for a home can be an exhausting process , &quot; Mary Donnelly said . &quot; This makes_it easy. &quot; The Donnellys aren ' t alone in turning_to computers for help in home shopping . When more_than 17 # 000 real_estate_brokers gathered_in Anaheim in November for their annual national conference , the group focused_on how to give clients more electronically packaged information . Computers anchored almost every booth as attendees gathered to buzz about the latest high-tech marketing tools . The reason : Most agents have come_to realize that colorful yard signs , open_houses and a smiling realtor are no longer the best way to sell a home . Now using sophisticated data sources to compete , realtors from the San Fernando Valley to Fountain Valley are among the first in the nation to use on-line systems . And as major real_estate companies rush to travel the so-called information superhighway , yesterday ' s real_estate_broker could be left rolling behind like a fallen hubcap . Realtors are betting that , like the Donnellys , their clients will demand more and better information before they begin shopping for a home . Though some brokers are nervous about giving_up some control , most predict that shoppers will one day work only with brokers who provide the most complete and current information . &quot; The floodgates are about to open , &quot; said Mark Surfas , director of on-line communications at Coldwell Banker Residential Real_Estate in Mission Viejo , one of the nation ' s largest real_estate brokerages with more_than 2 # 300 offices . &quot; We ' re blending a lot of different technologies together and turning this into a real_estate information Disneyland. &quot; * These days , shoppers can select their next dwelling on computer kiosks located in seven California malls , including one in Mission Viejo . A kiosk is slated to be installed in the Glendale Galleria and five other malls next year . Computers have replaced model homes_in Aliso Viejo , where buyers instead look_at computerized images of home designs developed by two Orange County companies . And for the ultimate home-buying experience , consumers may one day use virtual_reality centers -- with computer-generated , three-dimensional house designs -- to &quot; walk through &quot; rooms of houses or even entire neighborhoods without ever going outdoors . While on-line networks aren ' t yet available in most of Southern California , the San Fernando Valley Assn . of Realtors has unveiled a new system where buyers can use a computer_network to choose a home , electronically fill_out escrow and title information , and get preliminary mortgage approval in a single visit . &quot; They are the only board in the country doing this . I take my hat off to them , &quot; said Almon R . Smith , executive_vice_president of National Assn . of Realtors , which is developing a nationwide system based on the Valley model . &quot; It is sweeping the entire industry . When you get_down to it , real_estate -- more_than anything else -- is about the flow of information . Everyone ' s trying to figure_out how to link things together. &quot; With 7 # 500 members , the San Fernando board is the nation ' s third largest realty board and the largest in California . It is also the first to offer its members a network that stores up_to 10 color photographs of each home listing , full descriptions of the house , recent home improvements and information on local schools . Designed by Pacific Bell , the system can also create a list of properties tailored to a buyer ' s specifications and print out maps showing the location of every home . At a Century 21 office located just up the street from the Northridge Meadows apartment complex where 16 tenants died in the Jan . 17 earthquake , Lisa and Bill Smith are shopping for their &quot; first real home. &quot; The couple saw their condo damaged in the earthquake , but neither are willing to give_up on the Northridge area . They admit , though , that neighborhoods littered with earthquake-damaged homes add a special challenge to home buying . &quot; You can see right here , the chimney is gone , &quot; said their realtor Marc D . Schwartz pointing to a picture of a Northridge home on the computer . &quot; On your typical listing , it would just say , ' needs some TLC ' or ' slight earthquake damage. ' With the computer listing we can tell right away we don ' t want it , &quot; he said . * Schwartz plugs_in the Smiths ' specifications -- three bedrooms , maximum price of $ 160 # 000 , favorite neighborhoods -- into the computer and pulls_up 75 properties . The couple quickly scans through computerized photos of the homes , discarding the undesirables , especially those with serious earthquake damage . &quot; She wants a big house , and I want a big garage , &quot; said Bill Smith , 30 , who owns a window cleaning company . &quot; This saves us so_much time because we discuss it right here . Especially when you have kids , you don ' t want to spend the day driving around. &quot; &quot; Things are changing so rapidly , we had to change or we ' d be left_behind , &quot; said Alice McCain , president of the Valley realtor board . &quot; We wanted to be_on the forefront. &quot; At the Mission Viejo Mall , a computer kiosk designed by New Home Search offers buyers photographs and floor_plans of homes . Using CD-ROM technology , buyers tour both new and resale homes just by touching a computer_screen . &quot; Looking_for a home is a grueling process , &quot; said John Giamo , head of Visual Listings Inc. in Brea , who joined with Jeff Meyers of the Meyers Group , a Newport Beach real_estate data company , to create New Home Search in 1991 . &quot; Now in the comfort of your home or in your broker ' s office , you preview the homes . For someone who wants to cut_down on the problems , this is perfect , &quot; he said . Visual Listings also produces a real_estate CD-ROM , packed with up_to 25 # 000 listings . About 30 consumers , including the Donnellys , receive the disc free in their homes each week as part of a test program and about 100 brokerages subscribe_to the CD-ROM service for $ 35 a disc . The company charges about $ 20 to brokers to place a listing for a resale home_in the database and charges $ 150 to builders for new properties . Critics of the service say the cost of manufacturing a CD-ROM is prohibitive -- though the company said each disc costs only about $ 6 to make and could go lower -- and point_out that listings can expire quickly . Giamo admits that the program is still developing , but said computer users will be able to access the company ' s listings on the Internet by next spring . Giamo said the system developed in the San Fernando Valley is tailored to meet brokers ' needs , not those of consumers . His system , he said , is designed specifically for home_buyers . And that , he says , makes Orange County realtors a little nervous . &quot; It ' s been a very frustrating situation with Orange County brokers ; they have not embraced the technology , but consumers love it , &quot; Giamo said . &quot; There is some fear of them being out of a job -- that is not the intent . We ' re just a marketing tool. &quot; Chuck Smith , executive_vice_president of the East Orange County Assn . of Realtors , which with 2 # 100 members covers Santa Ana , Orange , Anaheim Hills and Tustin , acknowledged a certain resistance to change . But his group ' s agents can now put home listings on the Prodigy on-line service and said eventually all brokers will be on-line . &quot; We have been looking_at similar things to what San Fernando Valley has done . We find our members are very receptive to some of the new high-tech innovations , &quot; Smith said . &quot; But there is always some resistance to anything new. &quot; Smith , a realtor for 25 years , predicts that Orange County brokers , despite initial reluctance , will eventually all be on-line . * The Internet , a global connection of computer_networks and databases , will help provide a more intimate place to shop for a home . Offers and listings are already appearing on the World Wide Web , a subdivision of the Internet where members can advertise . The system allows_for text to be combined with sound and even video , providing an opportunity to show many features of a home . One is those companies is BayNet Co . in Palo Alto , which uses the World Wide Web to offer listings of houses for_sale in the San Francisco area . Formed in July , BayNet contracts with listing companies to provide details on new and resale homes . It charges agents $ 35 for each listing and charges real_estate brokerages $ 1 # 000 a month for up_to 15 # 000 listings . It also contracts with the San Mateo Times to reproduce its real_estate section and other news_articles on-line . &quot; Our home listings are being accessed by 1 # 500 viewers a day -- some as far away as Japan and Hong Kong , &quot; according to Gabriel Gross , founder of BayNet . &quot; Our next target is Southern California , where the Internet culture is not as strong as it is here. &quot; Some of America ' s largest real_estate brokerage_firms -- Coldwell Banker Residential Real_Estate and Century 21 Real_Estate Corp. , both based in Orange County -- are taking_note , spending millions of dollars to get their hundreds of thousands of brokers wired with the latest high-tech sales gadgets . Coldwell Banker is expanding its fledgling Scoop software program so that by early next year , consumers can walk into a Coldwell Banker office to look_at pictures of various homes , check_out schools and shop for a mortgage loan on the computer . Prudential Real_Estate Affiliates of Costa Mesa is building a $ 1-million center_on the East Coast with interactive television to view homes -- virtual_reality centers where potential buyers will &quot; walk &quot; through dozens of homes without leaving the office . The only thing missing are sales agents . &quot; There will be no salespeople there -- but you can find_out about everything : homes for_sale , mortgages and escrows , &quot; Prudential spokesman Ron Tepper said . &quot; The real_estate transaction is the most barbaric thing there is . We want to change that and give consumers what they want. &quot; * Not all brokers embrace multimedia home shopping . Realtors , through their local realtor boards , are used to controlling the information available regarding local homes for_sale , and don ' t like the idea that listings could be accessed directly by a consumer . Some especially challenge the theory that one day a broker may no longer be needed . &quot; This is still a lot of electronic sizzle , &quot; said Dick Rafferty , a broker with Electronic Realty Associates in Fountain Valley . &quot; People don ' t buy homes off the computer . They have to go look_at it. &quot; Many realtors say that while computers can provide buyers with more information , buyers will still need a professional real_estate_broker to guide them during the sale . One of those is Garden Grove realtor Pat Neal , past president of California Assn . of Realtors . &quot; While it ' s going_to be difficult getting the brokers to accept letting buyers have more control , we have to change because the clients have already jumped ahead and are demanding it , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
