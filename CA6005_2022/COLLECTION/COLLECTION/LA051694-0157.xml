   <HEADLINE> RICH NOTEBOOKS OF POET PUSHKIN BROUGHT TO LIFE ; RUSSIA : BRITAIN ' S PRINCE CHARLES SPONSORS PUBLISHING . MANUSCRIPTS ARE WINDOW ON WRITER ' S MIND , SCHOLARS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Notebooks in which Alexander Pushkin doodled , daydreamed and scratched_out epic_poems with a goose-feather quill will be published for the first time this year in a charitable venture sponsored by Britain ' s Prince Charles . Scholars say the rarely seen manuscripts will provide a glimpse into the mind behind the myth of Pushkin , the poet revered as the richest_in the Russian language . &quot; More_than all others , he has pushed_back the boundaries of the Russian language and shown all its spaciousness , &quot; fellow writer Nikolai Gogol said of Pushkin in 1834 . Eighteen large notebooks , about 2 # 000 pages in all , will be photographically reproduced and published in London in an eight-volume set , with financial_backing from the Prince of Wales ' charity , the Business_Leaders Forum . Private philanthropists have pledged $ 450 # 000 in contributions for the project , which will be announced when Prince Charles visits Pushkin House on Wednesday as part of a two-day visit to St . Petersburg . Charles will be the first Prince of Wales to visit Russia since 1894 . Queen Elizabeth_II never set foot in the Soviet_Union , whose founding Bolsheviks murdered her relatives , Czar Nicholas II and his wife , Alexandra , but President Boris N . Yeltsin has invited her to visit Russia . Charles ' visit to St . Petersburg is intended to promote foreign investment and aid to the arts , health_care and tourism in the elegant but somewhat neglected former capital . Pushkin ' s papers are stored in St . Petersburg , where he died after a duel in 1837 . Pushkin ' s verses can be found on most Russian bookshelves -- 35 million copies of his works were printed from 1917 to 1947 alone -- but only a handful of scholars with access to the Institute of Russian Literature have set eyes on the raw stuff those books are made of . The institute stores nearly all_of his original writings : 12 # 000 pages , letters and scraps . &quot; There are about another 10 pages of Pushkin manuscripts in museums and libraries around the world , &quot; said Sergei Fomichev , a scholar at the Pushkin House , as the St . Petersburg institute is known . &quot; The rest is here. &quot; The papers are largely intact because of a 1930s decree by Josef Stalin that all Pushkin manuscripts be kept at the institute -- a decree that sent Pushkin House scholars scurrying about the Soviet_Union and even abroad to round_up the works . Many had made their way into private hands despite a similar ukase issued by Czar Nicholas I immediately after Pushkin ' s death impounding the poet ' s papers as state property . The eight-volume set will be published with an initial print run of 500 copies , each set selling for $ 3 # 000 . Volumes one and eight -- with an index and commentary -- will be available by December , 1994 ; volumes two , three and four by December , 1995 ; and volumes five , six and seven by June , 1996 . Despite the price_tag , Fomichev said , interest is strong . &quot; ( Washington ' s National Symphony_Orchestra Conductor Mstislav ) Rostropovich was here to look the notebooks over . He said they were charming and promised he ' d be the first to buy one , &quot; he said . &quot; There are several excellent American Pushkin scholars who are interested , and we ' ve had feelers from the Japanese . &quot; We even got a letter from a woman in Bermuda whom none of us had ever heard of , &quot; Fomichev said . Some of the profits will go toward fixing_up the decrepit Institute of Russian Literature , a 160-year-old building that houses letters of Napoleon and manuscripts of Feodor Dostoevsky , Mark Twain and Honore de Balzac , in addition to the Pushkin notebooks . Roof leaks threaten these literary treasures , and the book-choked building is such a firetrap that off-duty firefighters have been hired to wander the halls and sniff for smoke . The notebooks , which contain such beloved Pushkin works as the fairy tale &quot; Ruslan and Lyudmila &quot; and the poet ' s seminal epic , &quot; Yevgeny Onegin , &quot; are stored in cardboard folders in a red wooden filing_cabinet -- in a room where humidity is controlled by placing wet rags on the radiators . Pushkin crossed_out as much as he wrote , and the notebooks reveal the mind-bending toil that produced his ethereal lyrics . &quot; With what labor he wrote his light , flying verses , &quot; poet Vasily Zhukovsky remarked after seeing some of the agonized-over drafts . &quot; There is no line that has not been scribbled several times over. &quot; In the early 19th Century -- the golden_age of Russian literature that Pushkin himself ushered_in -- artists customarily tried their hands at various media . Painters dabbled_in poetry , and Pushkin wove sketches both dreamy and draftsman-like around the text of his notebooks . Some verses take_on new meaning in the light of accompanying illustrations . One poem-drawing , for example , begins , &quot; I could ( also ) have . . . &quot; A sketch shows young_men hanging from gallows , and then the line resumes , &quot; like a fool. &quot; The reference is to the Decembrists , a group of radicals who tried to overthrow the czar in 1825 . They failed and were executed or exiled to Siberia . Although Pushkin was a sympathizer , the revolutionaries deemed him too volatile to be trusted with their secret plot and too valuable a literary figure to endanger . The passionate Pushkin died in a duel 12 years later , at the age of 37 . Lionized in his lifetime , the writer was elevated to a national hero after his romantic death . In the hungry 1920s , the cash-starved Soviet government allowed publication of Pushkin letters revealing details of the dispute that led to the fatal duel , sparking lively interest in the century-old scandal . &quot; They provided a great_deal of entertainment in a very bleak time , &quot; said Paul Debreczeny , a co-founder of the North_American Pushkin Society . Pushkin remains the undisputed father of Russian literature , but his works recently have been replaced on sidewalk and subway booksellers ' tables by pornography and pulp novels . &quot; Pushkin is not popular ; ' Santa Barbara ' is popular , &quot; said Valentin Nepomnyashchy , chairman of the Pushkin Commission at the Institute of World Literature in Moscow , referring to the defunct U.S. soap_opera now shown on Russian TV . &quot; But Pushkin is the poet of the Russian people. &quot; Yet it is unclear whether this edition will make Pushkin ' s notebooks any more accessible to the average Russian -- or even to scholars in the provinces . &quot; I ' m sure universities in cities like Saratov , Rostov and Tver would dearly love to have them , &quot; Debreczeny said of the $ 3 # 000 tomes . &quot; Unfortunately , Russian universities are in a very dire financial condition. &quot; Colin Byrne , a spokesman for the Business_Leaders Forum , said he hoped some of the proceeds could be used to donate editions to Russian universities and libraries . But the main goal of the project is to show Russian cultural institutions how to use their treasures to support themselves as Soviet-era state subsidies dry_up , Byrne said . Dmitry S . Likhachev , the Pushkin House director , said that what matters most is that &quot; in case of a disaster , a copy -- at the very least a copy -- will be left in the world. &quot;</TEXT>
