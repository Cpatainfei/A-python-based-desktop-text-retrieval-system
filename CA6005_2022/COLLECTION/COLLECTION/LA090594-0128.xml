   <HEADLINE> COUNTERPUNCH : HOW INDUSTRY CAN DO ITS SHARE FOR AMERICAN SOCIETY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The American family is in_trouble . This is obvious . The figures speak_for themselves . Not just the divorce rate , but the skyrocketing number of babies being born to unmarried_women , 30 % in the general population , 62 % in the black community ; and the exploding percentage of our children being raised in single-parent homes . According to the 1991 figures just released ( &quot; Traditional Family Nearly the Exception , Census Finds , &quot; Part A , Aug . 30 ) , almost 50 % of American children are growing_up without one or both of their parents . In no other society on the face of this planet has the percentage been so high . Does_it make any difference ? According to the recent Carnegie study , it makes a huge difference . Children from single-parent homes are statistically much more likely to have problems in school , drop_out before graduation , be abused and become abusers , run_afoul of the criminal justice system , have serious psychological problems , attempt suicide , get hooked on drugs and alcohol , and , in later life , fail in_love and work . There is no denying we have a problem , a big one . Some people point their fingers at those of us who work in the entertainment community and say it is our motion_pictures and television_shows that are the primary cause of the problem . I remain unconvinced . Too often it is true , we have copped_out and catered to the lowest common_denominator but I think the schools , the government , the churches and the business_community must also accept their share of the responsibility . * But if we producers , writers , directors and actors have not totally caused the problem , I do think there is much we can do to solve it . How ? * Sex : First , in our shows , we can present human sexuality as the beautiful and wholesome facet of the human personality that God made_it to be . Sex is special . Important . Significant . It says something : It says , &quot; I belong_to you , only to you , forever. &quot; To perform that act and not mean what it says -- to make_love casually -- without commitment , without deep caring -- is to reduce one ' s partner to an object . It ' s to use and exploit that person . The temptation for us in the industry is to tell our viewers what they want to hear rather than what they need to hear . What they need to hear is that good things are worth waiting for , that delaying gratification is the test of the maturely loving person , that self-giving rather than self-indulgence is the purpose of the sexual act . * Relationship : Second , we can illumine and support in our shows those qualities that make marriage work -- self-acceptance ; realistic expectations ; honesty and trust in communication ; a readiness to grow , to transcend one ' s ego and leave one ' s narcissism behind . Some people enter marriage thinking it a state of guaranteed intimacy . Automatically they think they will live happily ever after . That is an illusion we should not reinforce . The reality is marriage is a state where you struggle for intimacy and that struggle is a rigorous and scary one . The determination to hang_in there , to build the relationship one brick at a time , in good times and in bad , in sickness and in health , to give and give and give until it hurts and then some , this is how you become a mature person , learn to love and make a marriage work . Our shows should make that clear . * Parenting : Third , I think we can illumine and encourage the whole process of parenting . The kids need so_much , emotionally as well as physically . It sometimes seems a bottomless pit . And the pressures on parents are colossal . Economic pressures . Social pressures . Educational pressures . Media pressures . Pressures from the kids ' peers . Single parents have an especially tough time of it . I don ' t know how some of them do_it . In our shows , I think we can help parents understand their kids and we can help kids understand their parents . We can help them realize that all relationships are two-way_streets , that parents have needs too , that each side must be prepared to learn from the other , to give as well as receive . And we can celebrate the fulfillment that flows_from good parenting and unconditionally affirm the selflessness that it entails . It is not easy to be a good parent . But nothing is more important . The future of American society is in the hands of today ' s parents .</TEXT>
