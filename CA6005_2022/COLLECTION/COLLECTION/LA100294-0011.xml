   <TEXT> Disney has reworked Jack London ' s White Fang ( KTLA Sunday at 6 p.m. ) , a social parable of a wolf-dog transfored by love , into a sometimes gooey but overall likable 1991 film of a boy and his dog . A new character ( Ethan Hawke ) is introduced , obviously modeled on London himself . A TV movie that aired earlier this year , Vanishing Son II ( KTLA Sunday at 8 p.m. , Saturday at 1 p.m. ) is about two brothers ( Russell Wong , Chi Muoi Lo ) from China who go their separate ways in America . Martin Campbell ' s notable 1991 suspense-thriller Defenseless ( KCAL Sunday at 10 p.m. ) is a satisfying genre film , set_in Los Angeles and enlivened by a splendid cast headed by Barbara Hershey as an attorney suspected of murder -- and stalked by a killer . The real violence in the 1991 V.I. Warshawski ( KTLA Monday at 8 p.m. ) is directed not toward anyone on the screen but rather against Sara Paretsky ' s popular novels , which are the nominal inspiration for this tepid thriller . A well-cast Kathleen Turner is mired in a mishmash of a plot having to do with the Chicago private_eye trying to find_out who murdered an ex-hockey great with whom she had been flirting . The 1990 Narrow Margin ( KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m. ) , despite Gene Hackman ' s reliably strong presence and some good action sequences , is a textbook example of how not to remake a classic -- in this case Richard Fleischer ' s 1952 film noir set aboard a train and starring Charles McGraw and Marie Windsor . As the dutiful son of a New York slumlord , Joe Pesci has the title_role in the good-natured yet pertinent 1992 comedy The Super ( KTTV Tuesday at 8 p.m. ) , in which Pesci is sentenced to living 120 days in his own derelict East Village apartment_building . Whoopi Goldberg is fun as a flashy , sassy undercover cop , but the ultra-bloody 1987 Fatal Beauty ( KTLA Wednesday at 8 p.m. ) succumbs to hypocrisy in trying to preach against drugs while exploiting violence to the hilt . Not helping matters is the emasculation of the romance between Goldberg and Sam Elliott , head of security for a bad_guy . Peter Hyams ' 1986 Running Scared ( KTLA Thursday at 8 p.m. ) stars Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines as undercover Chicago cops dreaming of opening a bar in Key West but waylaid by plenty of exploits in the Windy City . It ' s a stylish genre film enlivened by the stars ' exceptional rapport . KCET is offering a memorable Marlene Dietrich Saturday night double_feature , The Blue_Angel ( at 9 p.m. ) and A Foreign Affair ( at 10:45 p.m. ) .</TEXT>
