   <HEADLINE> VALLEY INTERVIEW : LEE LOOKING_FORWARD TO CHALLENGES AS PIERCE COLLEGE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After 13 years as president of Valley College in Van Nuys , Mary Lee recently was named acting president of Pierce College in Woodland Hills effective Monday . When Lee replaces Pierce President Lowell Erickson , who is taking a one-year leave_of_absence before perhaps returning to teaching , she will inherit a campus facing an estimated $ 1.5-million budget_deficit this year and declining enrollments . Lee , 55 , a Chatsworth resident who gained a reputation at Valley College as an efficient and hard-charging administrator , hopes to bring those qualities to bear at Pierce . Both colleges are in the nine-campus Los Angeles Community_College District . Lee was interviewed by staff writer John Chandler . * Question : You ' ve been president at Valley College for 13 years . Your new job at Pierce College will last at least two years , but with no guarantee you will be able to stay beyond that . Why accept that kind of change ? Answer : There are several reasons . First , I enjoy a good challenge . Pierce is $ 1.5 million in deficit for this year . They are currently fourth in enrollment of the nine colleges . The development of the campus , not in a building sense , has such potential to be a unique place for the community to visit . The people at Pierce are doing an outstanding job in their particular areas . What Pierce needs is for all_of their talents to be packaged and sold to the community . That hasn ' t been done . Q . What kind of approach will you bring_to Pierce and what can people expect from you . A . I will talk with people . I will listen . But I also will expect that whatever group talks with me will have its homework done . First I ' m working_on enrollment and the budget_deficit . I appreciate people who are not yes people , because if I have a person who always says yes to me , then one of us doesn ' t need to be paid . Q . Shortly after the announcement you were moving to Pierce , you went there and spent about two hours walking_around the campus . In terms of potential for the institution , what did you see ? A . I saw greater potential for utilizing the college for the community . For example , walking through the orange groves , the blossoms were out and it was absolutely beautiful . To put a jogging track around the horticultural area would be wonderful . I would like to see the chain-link fence that circles the campus and makes_it look very unwelcome disappear and have a 50-foot setback with trees and plantings like industry does so when you drive by Pierce College , you are attracted to the campus . Q . For a college president , you have been involved in some rather unusual activities . You went_to truck driving school and got a commercial license and you ' re going to law_school now . What drives someone who ' s already a college president to do those kinds of things ? A . First of all , you have to have outside activities in_order to keep your mind clear to do your work . If anyone lives a job 24 hours a day , that person is going_to burn_out . I have always been interested in doing things I didn ' t know about . Q . You ' ve worked in the district in various capacities since 1977 . What kind of places were community_colleges then ? A . In the late 1970s , community_colleges had it made . There were no budget problems . The budget was increased relatively 10 % every year . There were no problems with how many people you hired . Enrollments were high . Students were coming_to the colleges , so there was no need to recruit . They could offer anything they wanted to , and the budget was there from the state . Then Proposition 13 came_in 1978 . The whole political scene changed from a local-tax-based system to more of a state system . As the budgets declined and students disappeared , community_colleges had to realize that they had to recruit . Q . So how different , better or worse , is today ' s environment than when you came_into the system ? A . When community_colleges were being created in this state , the programs were new . Every program had new equipment ; the faculty were new , and it was a great time . Now you have the same faculty close to retirement , and there is very little money for equipment replacement or new equipment . To create a new program , it is very difficult because the cost is so high for equipment and ( because of ) the difficulty of finding trained personnel . So I think program renewal is one of the greatest difficulties we have today . Q . There have been indications in recent days that the state ' s economy is beginning to turn_around . Yet the budget process in Sacramento is focusing_on non-higher education things such_as prison construction . How are community_colleges likely to fare financially over the next three to five years ? A . I think the budget will continue to be tight for community_colleges . The funds for community_colleges are not going_to catch_up in a hurry . And in_order to convince the Legislature and the governor that community_colleges need those funds , community_colleges are going_to have to make_sure that students are reaching their educational objectives . Q . Traditionally , community_colleges have had a number of designated roles : transferring students to four-year universities , vocational_education and basic skills instruction . Are there likely to be any structural changes in that approach in the coming years ? A . Until the state ' s master_plan is changed , transfer education and occupational education remain the primary missions of the community_colleges . Continuing education , counseling , English as a second language and basic skills -- those are also missions , but not the primary missions . One of the misconceptions about community_colleges is that they are two-year transfer institutions . Many students come_to the community_colleges assuming that ' s what they want to do . But they really end_up doing something else . Q . There is a lot of discussion about programs and classes being offered that are obsolete by subject or have equipment and facilities that are obsolete . Yet the district meanwhile is not_able to offer enough basic math , English and other core classes . Is that a problem at Valley and at Pierce , throughout the district , or even on a broader basis ? A . I believe it ' s a problem probably in almost any community_college , some more and some less . We have programs that have very low average class sizes ; the instructors are close to retirement ; the equipment is outdated , and the students who are in the program are there not to reach an educational objective but for their own interest . Community_colleges can ' t afford that kind of program any more . We need to offer programs that are beneficial to business and industry that allow students to get the skills to go_out into the workplace today , and at_the_same_time give them the basic skills in math and English . Q . So what does that say about the future of traditional vocational_education offerings in the community_college setting ? A . I believe traditional vocational offerings will eventually disappear . Community_colleges will need to work more closely with business and industry , use the equipment in business and industry and relate more to on-the-job training for the student in conjunction with the more academic courses . Q . Can you outline your plans for what needs to happen with the agriculture operation and the farm at Pierce College ? A . The farm is a unique asset that Pierce College has . It ' s underutilized . The farm used to attract 6 # 000 elementary_school children per year . that ' s recruitment for future students . Many people come onto the farm . However , those people really are not given any information on Pierce College and why Pierce College is there . It ' s not enough to get people onto the campus for a swap meet or any other kind of activity without giving people brochures and information about the college . Q . Could you see a day when the farm and the agricultural program would cease to exist ? A . I would not like to see it cease to exist . And while I ' m president , I will do what I can to make_sure the farm is utilized for instructional programs and for the community , and as a recruitment device .</TEXT>
