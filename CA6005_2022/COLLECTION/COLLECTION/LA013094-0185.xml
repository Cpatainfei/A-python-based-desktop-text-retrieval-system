   <HEADLINE> THE WAR INSIDE THE PENTAGON ; DEFENSE-BUDGET AX MEN RUN INTO ANGER , REPRISALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What began for Col . Sandy Mangold as a prestigious Pentagon assignment to recommend cuts_in the Air_Force ' s $ 20-billion spacecraft and nuclear forces budget ended_up a rancorous odyssey through an institution trying to come_to grips with an austere future . Mangold thought the need for huge spending_cuts was compelling , but when he advocated canceling programs favored by senior Air_Force officials -- such_as the Milstar satellite system and the Titan IV rocket -- an angry general told him : &quot; You are not one of us. &quot; The world crashed down on the 45-year-old colonel last year , when Air_Force investigators received anonymous allegations that he had pressured a contractor to give a friend a job , and had forced a subordinate to house-sit for him . In a suit recently filed_in Virginia state courts , Mangold charged that he was the victim of a conspiracy of Air_Force officials and defense_contractors attempting to use phony accusations to displace him and thwart his proposed budget reductions . After the allegations were made , Mangold was reassigned , derailing a career that had received high marks . The Air_Force formally reprimanded Mangold earlier this month , but the Pentagon inspector_general and Congress have begun looking_into countercharges that he was framed . No matter who prevails , Mangold ' s case -- and others like it -- may signal an unsettling road ahead for an institution some critics say is wracked by enmity and fear . A sharp budget ax is going_to fall on sacred programs that escaped earlier , undermining military careers , damaging major industrial corporations and eliminating thousands of civilian jobs . The stresses of making those cutbacks in programs made obsolete by the end of the Cold_War are creating an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust never before seen in the defense business . The venomous nature of these budget battles is leading some experts and critics to say that rational decisions will be harder to reach , especially at a time crucial to the nation ' s defense posture . &quot; The procurement system has always resisted nonconforming opinions , but in today ' s very harsh environment , nonconformists are getting their heads handed to them , &quot; said Loren Thompson , a Georgetown University defense expert . &quot; The system has a way of making you shut up. &quot; Many officials defend the procurement system . They say the reductions have not diminished its integrity . Darleen Dryun , the Air_Force ' s deputy assistant secretary for acquisition , said the formal budget process is handling the task of cutbacks well . &quot; We have a pretty open system within the Defense_Department and within the Air_Force , &quot; Dryun said . &quot; If somebody doesn ' t feel that something is being presented in the right fashion , there is plenty of opportunity to raise that issue. &quot; Ever since Defense_Secretary Caspar W . Weinberger refused to concede one dollar of defense spending after the Pentagon budget peaked in 1985 , the agency has been loath to make its own cutbacks . And within each service , officials have staunchly defended their turf . But the tendency to defend every large program could backfire and force the Pentagon to make even deeper cuts , because so_much money will have been spent on designing unaffordable weapons . A recent study conducted by Pentagon analyst Franklin C . Spinney , a frequent acquisition critic , substantiated this risk . The study found that so_much money is flowing into developing big-ticket weapons for the future that just 2 % of current aircraft inventories are being replaced each year . As a result , the average combat aircraft , in the long_run , could be 50 years old before it is replaced , he said . When the Pentagon conducted a &quot; bottom-up &quot; review last year to adjust its planning for the post-Cold War era , analysts noted how few major systems were cut and how minor were the adjustments to military_forces . In December , however , Clinton_Administration officials discovered a $ 50-billion gap between defense spending and planned funding over the next five years . The gap resulted from overly optimistic assumptions about inflation and a pay raise Congress had granted enlisted personnel . To many experts , the episode showed that the Defense_Department has yet to confront the reality of smaller future budgets . &quot; There has been a complete administrative breakdown in this building , &quot; said Spinney , an Air_Force analyst for tactical aircraft . &quot; The budget has been predicated on continued growth , but now it is coming unglued. &quot; While civilian employees such_as Spinney have freedom to express such candid views , a military_officer such_as Mangold can quickly fall from grace for expressing similar opinions . In a memo last year , Lt . Gen . John Jacquish , a top Air_Force acquisition official , railed at those who break ranks . &quot; I suggest it is timely and appropriate to remind our people that there is a time to argue a different approach and a time to accept and support the decisions made within the corporate process by those charged with that responsibility , &quot; Jacquish wrote to his subordinates . &quot; It is only destructive of our process if Air_Force people or support contractors advocate their personal opinions outside the corporate process , simply because the decision was not the one they wanted. &quot; * Jacquish was responding to a report leaked to Congress . It had asserted that the Air_Force could save $ 10 billion by updating the Defense Support Program satellite system rather than continuing to develop a new generation of spacecraft that would warn of missile attacks . The primary advocate of the lower-cost approach was Col . Edward Dietz , the Defense Support Program manager in Los Angeles . Amid the controversy , Dietz was removed from his job and reassigned another with less responsibility . Engineers at Aerospace Corp. , who assisted in writing the report , received unfavorable job evaluations as well . The Air_Force investigated allegations by industry executives and Air_Force_officers that Dietz ' s report was discredited and squelched by senior Air_Force officials intent_on preserving their new-generation program . That investigation found no wrongdoing , but it revealed serious problems in military acquisition . In his report , Lt . Gen . Marcus A . Anderson , the Air_Force inspector_general , wrote that the intense competition for future defense funds &quot; is producing distrust , suspicion , breakdowns in communications and ultimately allegations of impropriety , both from within the Air_Force and from defense contractors. &quot; Capt . Timothy L . Rude can attest to that . Rude , an engineer , was the Air_Force manager for advanced guidance systems for intercontinental_ballistic_missiles in San Bernardino . Rude figured that the end of the Cold_War had diminished the need for sophisticated guidance devices . However , when Rude suggested that less sophisticated systems might suffice , at a savings of $ 150 million , he rankled his bosses . He further angered them when he claimed they had shifted funds for missile programs in violation of federal law , a charge later substantiated by a General Accounting Office audit . Rude was drummed_out of the service a year ago , he said , on charges that he had sexually harassed a female junior officer , which he denies . Rude claims that senior officers coerced the woman into filing the complaint , which said he had sat too close to her in a restaurant booth , touched her knee and asked her for a date . &quot; In my opinion , this was a convoluted form of reprisal , &quot; he said . &quot; This whole_thing came_up a year after I reported the waste , fraud and abuse here . The system has gotten pretty corrupt. &quot; To outsiders , the idea that military officials and private contractors would resort_to making phony allegations may seem far fetched . But when billions of dollars are at stake , players in defense procurement &quot; know how to play hardball , &quot; says RAND Corp . vice_president George Donohue . As a young program manager , Donohue recalled discovering that a contractor was altering test data to conceal problems in a weapon . When Donohue disclosed the falsifications , the contractor used its congressional contacts to brand Donohue as an incompetent novice and a menace to national security , he said . While he survived the incident , he said he learned that &quot; people in this business are always skating on thin ice . When I hear about these things , I don ' t find it terribly surprising that people would make false allegations. &quot; * Donohue doesn ' t suggest that lying is widespread , but he says the pressure is becoming more and more intense . Any government or private organization would have a tough time coping_with the depth of cutbacks the Defense_Department faces . Pentagon budgets dropped 17 % from their peak in 1985 to 1992 , and are projected to decline 27 % further between 1992 and 1997 . Procurement spending has fallen_off even more sharply . Mangold described the system in a recent interview as being &quot; affected by a cancer. &quot; In August , 1992 , two months after he was appointed chief of resource allocation for space and nuclear forces , Mangold dropped his first bombshell : He suggested canceling the $ 27.4-billion Milstar communications satellite . He argued that it was fraught with inadequacies and unnecessary in the post-Cold War era . Mangold did not have direct authority to cut any program , but his recommendations went_to the most senior Air_Force officials and carried significant weight . He managed a staff of 38 colonels and lower-ranking officers who examined 250 programs . Mangold also questioned the Air_Force ' s increasing use of nonprofit federal research corporations , such_as Aerospace Corp . and RAND , which was costing the service upward of $ 1 billion annually . The abrupt end came last June , just days after Mangold had been assigned a second tour_of_duty as team chief . The Air_Force ' s inspector_general opened a probe into whether Mangold had threatened to cut the contracts of Anser Corp. , a nonprofit Arlington , Va.-based consulting_firm , unless it hired one of his personal friends , according to interviews with Pentagon officials , confidential Pentagon documents and Mangold . Mangold ' s lawsuit alleges that Anser would have been hurt badly by the cuts recommended . He accuses Anser President John Fabian , Vice_President Paul Adler and Lt . Col . James Rooney , a former subordinate on Mangold ' s staff , of conspiring to file the false allegations , court records show . Anser officials would not comment . In legal papers responding to Mangold ' s suit , the firm denied his allegations and said its officials had made no allegations against Mangold . It was Rooney who made the allegation that he was ordered to house-sit , according to Mangold , who denies the charge . Rooney ' s apparent motive was his allegiance to the Air_Force ' s space community , which had targeted Mangold as an adversary , Mangold said . Rooney did not return calls asking_for his comments . Mangold denies that he ever coerced Anser , though he acknowledges that he gave Anser officials the resume of a woman he considered to be qualified for a special job . The woman was never hired , and Mangold said he continued to award contracts to the firm until he was reassigned as a planner in June . * Pentagon investigators say military officials are not barred from recommending an individual for a job . An ethical breach would have occurred only if he had threatened Anser , something Mangold ' s friends called unlikely . &quot; When he worked for me , he was totally honest and loyal and dedicated , &quot; said retired Air_Force Gen . Richard Henry , a former commander of the Los Angeles Space and Missile Systems Center . Mangold was Henry ' s aide in the 1980s . Mangold ' s case is also under investigation by Rep . John Conyers Jr . ( D-Mich ) , chairman of the House Government Operations Committee , which expects to hold hearings next month into the Mangold and Dietz cases . &quot; I was viewed_as a pariah , &quot; Mangold said . &quot; I said if we really want to take massive cuts , we all have to take our share . There aren ' t any team chiefs coming_forward now with radical proposals after they have seen what happened to me . My career has been ruined. &quot; WHAT THE COLONEL WANTED TO CUT The Milstar satellite system . The Titan IV rocket project . The use of nonprofit research firms .</TEXT>
