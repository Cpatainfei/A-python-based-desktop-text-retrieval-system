   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES : ' TO WONG FOO , ' TOO ; SURE HE CAN WEAR A DRESS , BUT CAN HE LOOK CUTE IN IT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Robin Williams made such a convincing woman playing the divorcee who goes undercover as an elderly British nanny in last year ' s $ 218-million-grossing comedy &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; that it ' s not surprising he would consider playing a drag queen as his next major screen role . Apparently , that ' s exactly what the actor thought after reading Douglas Carter Beane ' s comedy &quot; To Wong Foo , Thanks for Everything , Julie Newmar. &quot; The hot script is about three New York City transvestites who get stranded in a Midwestern town , where they spice_up the otherwise quiet lives of the locals . But after doing his own make-up test for the role of Vida Boheme -- winner of the Drag Queen of the Year contest -- sources say Williams called_up his close pal Steven Spielberg , whose Amblin Productions is producing the movie for Universal Pictures , and conceded that he wasn ' t pretty enough to pull it off . The role in the movie -- which began filming Monday in New York under the direction of Beeban Kidron ( &quot; Used People &quot; ) -- ultimately went_to Patrick Swayze after being coveted by dozens of established Hollywood actors including Robert Downey Jr. , Billy Baldwin , Gary Oldman , Matthew Broderick , James Spader and John Cusack , among many others . Wesley Snipes also stars in the ensemble piece as drag queen Noxeema Jackson , and John Leguizamo portrays Chi Chi Rodriguez . But audiences shouldn ' t fret . Though Williams won ' t be seen in a dress this time_out , the star will have an unbilled cameo in the movie . His character , John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt , is described as an eccentric &quot; jack of all trades &quot; or &quot; a walking pawn shop who buys and sells things , &quot; who hangs_out at a kitschy New York restaurant called the China Bowl . Williams is reportedly in just one scene , in which he brokers a deal for Swayze and Snipes , who want to cash_in their winning beauty contest airline tickets to buy a car . According to screenwriter Beane ' s agent , Mary Meagher of the William Morris Agency in New York , Williams is one of the first actors Spielberg showed the &quot; To Wong Foo &quot; script . &quot; He thought it would amuse him , &quot; she said . Williams could not be reached for comment and Amblin officials declined comment . Because his is an uncredited , minor_role , Williams has reportedly instructed the movie company and Universal not to use his name to publicize their film . Surely they won ' t . This , after all , is the guy who still refuses to work again at Disney ( where he made the hits &quot; Good_Morning , Vietnam &quot; and &quot; Dead Poets Society &quot; ) because he ' s still angry over the studio ' s use of his voice as the wisecracking Genie in &quot; Aladdin &quot; to promote the animated blockbuster . As for other cameos , Williams also had an unbilled quickie in Kenneth Branagh ' s 1991 movie &quot; Dead Again , &quot; a past-lives thriller in which he played the sinister Dr. Cozy Carlisle . Universal plans an early 1995 release for &quot; To Wong Foo , Thanks for Everything , Julie Newmar , &quot; whose title refers to the autograph inscription on a celebrity photo of the real-life B-movie actress , which the drag queens carry with them as a good-luck charm .</TEXT>
