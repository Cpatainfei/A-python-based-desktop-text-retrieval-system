   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS : CINEWOMEN ; SCHMOOZE , NETWORK , SHOWCASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About six months ago , two women working in the film_industry found themselves musing over cocktails at the Dresden Room in Los Angeles , wondering why it was that so many of their peers were excluded from the Hollywood Boys Club . When , they asked each other , would female filmmakers finally get the break they deserved ? What had happened to the Year of the Woman , anyway ? Rather than wallowing in the injustice of it all , Elizabeth Cunningham , 31 , and Jennifer Johnson , 25 , decided to take action in their own lives . The result ? A regular film series devoted to showcasing new films by women , the Cinewomen Screening Series , which begins Wednesday at the American Film Institute Armed with the notion that , as Cunningham puts it , &quot; there are a lot of talented women out there , they ' re just under-represented , &quot; the duo had no trouble persuading Cinewomen , a nonprofit 400- member organization dedicated to the advancement of women in the entertainment_industry , to donate its support . &quot; We ' re advocates of women helping each other , &quot; says Elisa Rothstein , one of Cinewomen ' s founders and its current president , on why the group lent its name and resources to the program . &quot; This series gives us a broader arena in which to be supportive. &quot; With the help of Cinewomen and sponsor Panavision , Cunningham and Johnson next set_out to gather films , eventually screening more_than 50 . They wound_up with five films , a mix of animated and live-action , documentary and narrative work , all directed , written and produced by women . At least one film is by an established filmmaker , Tamra Davis ( &quot; Gun Crazy , &quot; &quot; CB4 &quot; ) , while most are by those who have toiled in obscurity . Lisa Udelson , whose 20-minute comedy &quot; The Party_Favor &quot; made the cut , says that it ' s enough just to have her film screened . Udelson ' s film , which she describes as a &quot; non-traditional subject handled in a traditional way , &quot; tells the story of a lesbian couple who find themselves at a hyper-suburban bridal shower . &quot; My film was being ignored at the bigger film festivals , &quot; she says , &quot; so I ' m happy to have more people see it . It ' s no different than being a painter who wants an exhibition for their work. &quot; Davis , currently in post-production on &quot; Billy Madison &quot; for Universal , may_not need the exposure for her independently made documentary video &quot; No Alternative Girls , &quot; which recently aired on MTV . Yet she sees the series as offering her a chance to feel a part of a filmmaking community . &quot; I really don ' t know that many people in the film_industry , &quot; she confesses . Udelson , a former editor in TriStar ' s advertising_department , says , &quot; I ' m not schmoozy , I ' m not hooked in , I don ' t hang_around with other filmmakers . This gives me a pool of filmmakers to commiserate with. &quot; But both Cunningham and Johnson stress that they ' re not out_to create a Hollywood Girls Club . &quot; We want Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs to become extinct , &quot; Johnson says . &quot; This is about bringing the industry to see the work of struggling independent filmmakers. &quot; The two say they plan to offer a series three times a year . &quot; We wish this wasn ' t necessary , &quot; Johnson adds , &quot; but we have a sense_of_humor about the fact that it is. &quot; * The Cinewomen Screening Series begins Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. at the American Film Institute , at the Mark Goodson Theatre , 2021 N . Western Ave. , Los Angeles , ( 213 ) 856-7600 . Reservations : ( 310 ) 855-8720 . Tickets are $ 5 and can be purchased at the door .
