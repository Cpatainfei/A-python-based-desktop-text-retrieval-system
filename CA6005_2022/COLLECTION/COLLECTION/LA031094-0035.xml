   <TEXT> Like a traveling carnival act , an old Asian man works his magic , entrancing a crowd of children outside the T &amp; T Market in Diamond Square . He rolls a small mound of sweet , taffy-like dough between his palms and then , mimicking the technique of a Chinese noodle maker , flicks and twists the dough , snapping it into a_thousand filaments of lion ' s mane candy . His &quot; act &quot; isn ' t the only attraction at Diamond Square this Saturday afternoon . Next to T &amp; T , in the mall ' s food court , an electronic band warms_up , competing with a chattering battalion of video_games in the amusement arcade . People are busily getting film developed , buying children ' s clothes , shopping for jewelry or checking out karaoke video cassettes . But mostly they are shopping for food or eating_in the square ' s polyglot assortment of Asian restaurants . As the stylized neon logos above the food court ' s shops affirm , Diamond Square is San Gabriel Valley ' s new pan-Asian outpost . Signs advertise Pho Diamond , a Vietnamese noodle soup shop ; Dennies Canteen , with a menu of northern Chinese breakfast items ; and Fortune House , selling Taiwanese-style dried meats and snacks . My favorite place , Yee Shun Deli of Macao , makes delicious Chinese-style steamed milk desserts and Indonesian sate . Inquiring epicures will want to investigate Ledo , a Hong Kong-style coffee_shop . Its &quot; international &quot; menu is typical of such places -- French_toast and five-flavor beef_stew lo mein are listed on the same page , and a section entitled Fountain Beverages suggests a Hawaiian sundae and longan ice . Next door to Ledo is a Japanese shabu shabu restaurant . And across the parking_lot are a Vietnamese place , a Shanghainese restaurant and Diamond Seafood , which serves dim sum from carts and fish from Cantonese-style live tanks . The mixed Asian population in Diamond Square ' s neighborhood , which not so_long ago was primarily Anglo and Latino , burgeoned incredibly between the 1980 and 1990 censuses . The number of Asian residents in El Monte was up a stunning 456 % , in Rosemead and San Gabriel about 370 % , while most other groups declined . Just slightly east of the well-established Chinese enclave in Monterey Park , this neighborhood ' s new Asian pluralism becomes instantly clear as you peruse the merchandise in the coolers and on the shelves at T &amp; T Market . In the sauce department are jars and bottles of Filipino banana ketchup , Indonesian sambal oelek , Vietnamese tuong ot toi and Malay-style Maggi chili_sauce -- packed by Nestle ' s in Kuala Lumpur . There is Pantainorasingh-brand saus prik , the garlicky , hot-sweet dipping sauce for Thai barbecued chicken , and Indonesian instant rendang mix for making a special beef curry . The fish sauces and fish pastes used as seasonings also run the gamut from Thai nam pla and Vietnamese nuoc mam to Malaysian belachan , Kampuchean prahok and Indonesian terasi . If the sauces and condiments at T &amp; T are often suited to a specific cuisine , the basic fresh ingredients , such_as lemon grass , plantains , taro and water spinach are common to the whole Southeast Asian region and parts of China -- which is why T &amp; T can so easily cater to so many nationalities . The store is equipped with all_the modern-day supermarket amenities that Asian shoppers have come_to expect . You can use your ATM card at the check-out stand , where cashiers wear smart green jackets or vests with the T &amp; T logo . And you ' ll see the usual array of live fish and seafood in big , gurgling tanks . T &amp; T is a little smaller than several other massive-sized Asian markets in the area , but it ' s clear that its managers know exactly who ' s doing the shopping . SHOPPING LIST PRODUCE * A huge mound of freshly picked herbs and lettuces is a wonderful fixture on the Southeast Asian table . People eat the leaves with finger_foods or they toss a_few into their soup . In Eastern Thailand and Kampuchea , where the food is similar , and also in Southern Thailand and neighboring Malaysia , all sorts of locally grown herbs comprise this mealtime fixture . Until recently , Southeast Asians here had to make_do with fresh coriander , basil and mint . But now , herbs unfamiliar to Americans are starting to appear in Asian markets . Two of the most popular are rau ram and ngo gai ( to use their Vietnamese names ) . * * Rau Ram : Known in English as polygonum , rau ram has a bold , spicy taste akin to a concentrated blend of Asian basil and mint . You can easily identify it by the slight pink tinge of its stems and its small , pointy , green leaves . Rau ram is sold in bunches with about half_a_dozen leaves on a stem . * * Ngo Gai : Sometimes called saw-tooth herb because its long slender leaves have serrated edges , ngo gai tastes like an intense version of cilantro , to which it is botanically related . Sold in bunches of single leaves on a plastic tray covered in shrink-wrap , ngo gai will wind_up being served alongside the Vietnamese pho and Southeast Asian hot-and-sour fish soups . I ' ve been told that Caribbean cooks use the herb and that it is also known as Puerto Rican coriander . * * Shredded Green Papaya and Carrot : For the convenience-food-minded , T &amp; T sells pre-shredded carrot and papaya in bulk . These are actually shredded , not grated ; they come_in long , thin , curly strands . Green papaya is the main ingredient in som tam , the spicy Thai salad dressed with a chile-lime juice dressing , sometimes seasoned with crushed small crabs . A similar Kampuchean salad has fermented fish condiment in its dressing . In Vietnam , the green papaya ' s most popular use is in goi du du , a salad topped with sliced or julienned dried beef ( or water_buffalo , if you ' re up-country ) . Many love to serve goi du du with puffy shrimp chips , which you can buy here ready to eat . In Laos , tam som , a shredded carrot salad made with lots of garlic , chiles and ( sometimes ) pork stomach , is a fixture at meals served for social_occasions . * * Mixed Vegetables for Hot-and-Sour Soup : Each country in Southeast_Asia has its own version of hot-and-sour soup . In the Philippines it ' s sinigang , made tart with tamarind ; in Thailand it ' s tom yam , with lemon grass and fragrant kaffir lime leaves . One Kampuchean version is samla michou banle ; the Vietnamese make canh chua ca and the Laotian kaeng som or kaeng tom yum . * * Pomelo , Pummelo or Shaddock : The pomelo looks_like an inflated grapefruit ( no surprise -- grapefruit is descended from it ) but has a marvelous sweet , slightly tart taste that lacks the bitterness of grapefruit . Its botanical name is Citrus maxima , befitting the largest fruit of the citrus family . The Dutch discovered the pomelo in the Malaya-Indonesia area ( our word pomelo comes from the Dutch pompelmoes ) , where it grows abundantly , as it does throughout the humid areas of Southeast_Asia and China . In recent centuries it has made its way to tropical regions of the Americas and now grows even in California . I ' ve discovered it ' s easiest to peel a pomelo if you score the very thick_skin lengthwise about six times and peel it off in segments . You then must remove the juicy meat from its inedible membrane , which easily zips open like a little package after you score the inner edge of each segment . * * Pea Shoots : These curly little tendrils and tender shoots are getting_to be a staple in chic Chinese restaurants . They taste like new spring peas , and the plants are grown as creepers rather than upright vines . Pinching off the buds prevents fruiting and flowering , which sends the pea flavor into the young leaves . Because they are scarce and expensive in China , pea shoots are likely to be a special-occasion food . Restaurants like to serve them with crab meat or fresh shrimp roe as a delicacy . But the shoots are delicious just plain , stir-fried with a minimum amount of oil and slashed with a_few teaspoons of Chinese rice wine or dry Sherry , a pinch of sugar and a little salt . NOODLE PRODUCTS * Banh Hoi : In their package , these &quot; noodle cakes &quot; look_like a mound of extra-fine fresh rice vermicelli , but when you unwrap the package , you find the noodles stuck_together into a little pancake that you can peel_off the pile . The cakes look similar to Sri Lankan string hoppers . Banh hoi often substitute for rice_papers in a Vietnamese meal . You use them topped with a piece of lettuce and some fresh herbs to wrap around bites of barbecued meat , meat ball or grilled fish . A dipping sauce always goes_with this . T &amp; T ' s manager , James Lee , suggests that the rice cakes are_best served slightly warm . Heat them over steam or for just a_few seconds in a microwave_oven on the &quot; defrost &quot; setting . * * Banh Cuon : Almost as basic as bread in Vietnam , banh cuon are related to the stuffed Chinese rice noodle sheets that you get_at a dim sum meal , but they are a much lighter and finer version . T &amp; T stocks freshly made rice noodle sheets beside the many other kinds of fresh rice noodles near the produce section . You will see banh cuon sold unrolled in a flat package , where they are called banh pho uot . The rice sheets have all sorts of uses : Eaten sprinkled with a_few fried shallots they go_by the name banh cuon thanh tri . These are accompanied by a fresh herb such_as mint , cucumber slices and a dipping sauce . One particularly popular way to eat banh cuon in Vietnam is with slices of the cold cuts cha lua , gio lua or cha chien on the side . Banh cuon may also be filled with ground pork and tree ears or crushed , dried shrimp . VIETNAMESE COLD CUTS One thing that distinguishes Vietnam from most of Asia is its taste for European-style charcuterie such_as pate , cold sausage , head cheese and ham , which it adapted from the_French colonists . Cold cuts fill banh mi , the Hoagie-like sandwich made on a French roll and garnished with marinated vegetables and herbs . They ' re also popular for appetizers and as luncheon_meats , eaten with fresh rice_paper sheets ( banh cuon ) . I ' ve included instructions for banh mi so you can try Vietnamese cold cuts at_home . T &amp; T offers cold cuts from several companies , including Tay Ho , which are manufactured in a USDA-inspected plant in Garden Grove . * * Gio Lua : Also known as cha lua ( and usually labeled as pork meat_loaf in English ) , this smooth , bologna-like sausage is seasoned very slightly with fish sauce . It is steamed wrapped in banana leaves , which lends a special flavor to the meat . Whether in sandwiches or as an appetizer , gio lua should always be very thinly sliced after its leafy covering is removed . When serving gio lua with banh cuon ( sold in the noodle section of the market ) , cut the meat slices_into halves . These are then easy to eat with a morsel of banh cuon in a single bite . To go_with these you need the basic Vietnamese dipping sauce , nuoc cham . * * Cha Chien : Basically , cha chien is the same as gio lua , but instead of being formed into a sausage shape and steamed in a banana leaf , cha chien is shaped into a square patty and deep-fried . Like gio lua , the meat is offered in sandwiches and on an assorted cold-cut appetizer plate called seven-course appetizer . One young Vietnamese says she ' s found a new way to eat cha chien : &quot; Cut a half-inch piece , warm it in a microwave about 30 seconds and put it in a hot dog bun with a little barbecue_sauce . It ' s delicious. &quot; * * Cha Bi : Cha bi uses the basic meat mixture as for gio lua except that it is blended with a_few fine slivers of seasoned and cooked pork skin . The Vietnamese love the skin ' s slightly resilient texture . While pork skin may sound less than appealing , it is barely detectable in this flavorful cold cut . * * Doi Gio Heo : Made from pork hock that has been cured in a manner similar to ham , the sausage-like doi gio heo is wrapped in a thin , translucent covering of pork skin . When it ' s thinly sliced it has a beautiful pattern . * * Pate Gan : A liver pate like the old-fashioned , home-made country variety found in France , pate gan is usually eaten spread on French_bread . It is also a popular , but optional , ingredient in the Vietnamese hoagie . * * Gio Thu : Quite simply , gio thu is head cheese , almost identical to a European head cheese . It is made the classical way from pork snout and ears formed in a square mold . Thinly sliced , gio thu is light and refreshing on a French roll garnished with Vietnamese marinated vegetables . MISCELLANEOUS * Vietnamese Meatball Mix : In addition to cold cuts , Tay Ho makes a well-seasoned , garlic-laced Southeast Asian-style meatball mixture . It ' s labeled with the Vietnamese name nem nuong , but it ' s popular_with Laotians and Kampucheans too . The mixture is formed into one-inch balls , threaded onto a skewer several at a time and cooked over charcoal . A popular accompaniment for the meatballs is banh hoi , the rice noodle cake described above . But rice_paper or even plain rice do nicely too . As with all grilled dishes , the herb and lettuce tray and nuoc cham dipping sauce are standard . To eat nem nuong , wrap a meatball in a piece of rice_paper or noodle cake topped with lettuce and herbs and dip in the sauce . * * Flours and Flour Product Mixes : T &amp; T carries all those exotic flours such_as sweet_potato starch , tapioca flour , taro starch and wheat starch ( not flour ) that are seldom seen in Western cooking . Besides these are prepared mixes -- the Asian equivalent of biscuit or blueberry muffin mix -- used for Asian specialty dishes . Most are manufactured here in California and packed in heavy plastic bags . Nowadays the_English instructions are better than they used to be ( although the syntax could still use some work ) . * * Banh Xeo Mix : Banh xeo mix comes_with a pouch of turmeric , which you add along with water and coconut_milk . The resulting banh xeo , made primarily of rice starch , is an egg-yellow pancake that looks exactly like a folded omelet . The filling for these cakes is made of ground pork and vegetables . Directions may be found in &quot; The Classic Cuisine of Vietnam &quot; by Bach Ngo and Gloria Zimmerman and in &quot; The Simple Art of Vietnamese Cooking &quot; by Binh Duong and Marsha Kiesel . A quickie filling is julienne of Chinese barbecue pork , a_few cooked shrimp , and a_few bean_sprouts , sprinkled with garlic-seasoned fish sauce , minced scallion and fresh coriander leaves . * * Shrimp Chips : These airy chips , made from tapioca starch and ground shrimp , show_up as a delightful , crunchy garnish on all sorts of Southeast Asian dishes . Known as krupuk udang in Indonesia , they are served there with just about everything . In Vietnam , where they ' re called banh phong tom , they often accompany salads . The chips accompany drinks as an appetizer or can simply be a snack . You can buy the Indonesian or Vietnamese variety uncooked . These need to be deep-fried about 12 seconds in two or more inches of 350-degree oil . But T &amp; T carries ready-to-eat shrimp chips made by Golden Pacific Foods in the City of Industry , and they ' ve captured the American marketplace style . The chips come_in several flavors : onion and garlic , sour_cream and onion , and barbecue shrimp . Their snack food-style bags carry the suggestion : &quot; Don ' t be a litter bug ; keep America beautiful. &quot; * Banh Mi , the Vietnamese French_bread sandwiches , must always include a thin smear of mayonnaise , the cold cuts of your choice , a_few sprigs of fresh coriander and a layer of these marinated vegetables . Some people like to add a_few thin slices of jalapeno chile . MARINATED VEGETABLES FOR VIETNAMESE-STYLE SANDWICHES 2 large carrots , cut_into medium julienne or into strips with serrated vegetable cutter 1 piece daikon or jicama equal_to amount of carrots , cut_into medium julienne or into strips with serrated vegetable cutter 4 cloves garlic , sliced lengthwise 2 cups water 3 tablespoons white vinegar 3 tablespoons sugar 1 / 8 teaspoon salt Dipping Sauce Place carrots , daikon and garlic in ceramic or glass bowl .
