   <HEADLINE> O.C. SEN . HURTT PRESSES ON TOWARD CONSERVATIVE GOALS ; POLITICS : BRASH REPUBLICAN MAKES IT HIS BUSINESS TO PUT MORE LIKE-MINDED CANDIDATES IN THE LEGISLATURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He burst into the staid chambers of the state Senate a year ago , a political outsider crashing the most exclusive of clubs . Life in the Capitol hasn ' t been quite the same since . Legislative rookies are expected to quietly find their spot on a back bench , but Rob Hurtt -- Orange County businessman , conservative Republican , evangelical Christian -- would have none of that . Hurtt had just spent $ 300 # 000 to win a state Senate seat . Like any good capitalist , he wanted his money ' s worth . The upstart lawmaker , who had never before held elected office , spent his first year testing the traditions of the political establishment . He talked precociously of becoming Senate Republican leader and griped about his party ' s complacency . Occasionally , Hurtt brashly questioned GOP veterans about floor votes he felt were anti-Republican . Democratic leaders quickly labeled him a bully . But his biggest splash has come_with the huge sums of campaign cash Hurtt funnels to like-minded candidates . If bloody election-year battles seem a throwback to the Jurassic epoch , then Hurtt is the Republican T-Rex . In the past two years , the senator has joined with three other Christian businessmen to contribute a whopping $ 3.6 million to conservative candidates and causes . Now come the elections of 1994 , and for Rob Hurtt the future could be just a_few precinct victories away . He is the GOP ' s Senate point_man on campaign strategy , and arguably the chief architect of the Republican_Party ' s grand design to recapture the Legislature . If all goes according to GOP plans , the party will gain_ground in the Assembly and Senate during this year ' s races , then seize power in one or both houses in 1996 . Should that scenario unfold , the junior senator from Orange County could probably script whatever political future he wants . That is a pretty heady possibility for a lifelong industrialist who , until recently , had never tinkered with California ' s political machinery . Before campaigns , Hurtt was into cans , building a fortune with his Garden Grove company that manufactures decorative tins and plastic containers . By most accounts , the hard-driving new senator has nimbly switched hats from businessman to politician , using money and unbridled gumption to acquire a position of influence that many lawmakers never achieve . &quot; I think Rob is the best thing that has happened to the Republican_Party in many , many years , &quot; said state Sen . John Lewis ( R-Orange ) , a conservative ally from Orange County . &quot; For years we ' ve been outmanned and outspent by the Democrats . Rob is the great equalizer. &quot; ' Religious Oligarchy ' While many conservatives look_to the 49-year-old senator as a political messiah , Democrats are alternately bemused and bewildered , irritated and incensed . And worried . As they mobilize to defend the Capitol turf they have controlled for decades , Democratic leaders point to Hurtt as the prime threat -- and not just because of the money he commands . Hurtt may promote himself as a &quot; citizen legislator &quot; and champion of business , but Democratic chiefs contend that the public facade masks the Bible-based platform of the religious right . Sen . Bill Lockyer ( D-Hayward ) , the Senate leader , suggests that the Republican freshman and the Allied Business PAC , the political_action_committee Hurtt formed with Orange County savings-and-loan heir Howard Ahmanson , are bent_on creating a &quot; religious oligarchy. &quot; If conservative Republicans sweep into power , an era of New Testament intolerance would follow , Lockyer warns . &quot; Our democratic institutions are threatened , &quot; he said . Hurtt is weary of the dire rhetoric , saying Democrats are &quot; trying to make me into a bogyman. &quot; Yes , he believes_in traditional two-parent families , is staunchly anti-abortion , opposes special rights for gays and supports conservative goals such_as school vouchers . He insists , however , that he has no desire to see California become a religious theocracy . For now he is content to vote against taxes , sponsor legislation to fight unions and work to slash regulations hampering industry . The conservative social issues are important , Hurtt concedes , but they can wait until California ' s recession-racked economy rebounds . In any case , Hurtt assures doubters , &quot; there ' s no reason for alarm . Our agenda is pretty much America and apple pie. &quot; The man himself , friends say , is hardly puritanical . He drinks_in social settings and laments that he has taken_up smoking again after more_than a dozen years of abstinence ( he vows to quit ) . To pass evenings away from home , Hurtt often invites Republican allies over for low-stakes poker in his suite at the Capitol Hyatt Regency . And while many of his legislative cohorts tool_around town in tax-subsidized Buicks and Lincolns , Hurtt pilots a sports_car he bought with his own cash . Conservative colleagues say he is glib and quick-witted , principled and competitive , a hard charger and a fast learner . Not everyone is so kind . Some moderate Republicans contend that Hurtt is a politician with an attitude , flaunting an imperious nature developed during years as a boss in the business world . They also grumble about his freshman mistakes and occasional cantankerous confrontations . Groused one veteran lawmaker : &quot; He can tell you off with a smile on his face. &quot; Prospering Business But get Hurtt talking_about his boyhood and he can be downright charming . A product of Pasadena public_schools , the 5-foot-8 senator tells of getting knocked unconscious in a high_school football game and wobbling to the sidelines . &quot; The coach spun me around and said , ' No , son , the other sideline. ' &quot; Hurtt also played tennis with future Wimbledon champ Stan Smith . &quot; He was two years younger than I was , &quot; Hurtt recalled . &quot; Whipped his butt. &quot; After college , Hurtt went_to work for his dad ' s can manufacturing firm , Container Supply Co . The firm prospered , with sales of $ 23 million in 1990 . Underlying that success is his father ' s simple philosophy : Don ' t operate_on borrowed money . It ' s a law Hurtt wishes the deficit-spending state of California would follow . The impetus for Hurtt ' s political mission can be found in part at his Garden Grove factory , a bustling maze of assembly_lines and punch_presses . That sound and fury of free_enterprise has drawn the scrutiny of regulatory_agencies , notably the South Coast Air Quality Management District . &quot; This is what the AQMD hates , this great big ugly thing , &quot; Hurtt said one recent afternoon , waving a hand at a huge oven that bakes ink labels onto aluminum cans -- and produces the building_blocks of smog . Hurtt has been battling the AQMD for years over how much the oven can be used , a spat that has put a crimp in his business . Hurtt was also prodded toward politics by watching his four children grow_up in a world much changed from that of his youth . The watershed came when he talked with a high_school counselor about his eldest son ' s mediocre grades . The counselor told Hurtt not to worry . His boy was a good kid , never got_into trouble . &quot; A light_bulb went_on , &quot; Hurtt recalls . &quot; They didn ' t care if he wasn ' t learning anything . As long as he wasn ' t causing problems , they thought he was great. &quot; The spiritual element played a role in his political conversion . Hurtt began attending a men ' s Bible study group in the mid-1980s and joined an evangelical church in Santa Ana . He also drew inspiration from the work of James Dobson , whose evangelical operation in Colorado Springs , Colo. , produces books , tapes , videos and the nationwide radio program &quot; Focus_on the Family. &quot; In addition , Hurtt became a booster of the Family Research Council , a conservative Washington think-tank run_by Gary Bauer , a former Reagan_Administration domestic policy adviser . In the late 1980s , Hurtt decided to put his money where his convictions were . He founded Capitol Resource Institute , a conservative Sacramento group that specializes in family issues . But the businessman quickly learned the limits of lobbying for conservative causes in the Democrat-dominated state Capitol . Hurtt turned_to trying to remake the Legislature in a conservative image . He began in 1990 by donating modestly to a_few Orange County candidates . But the campaign contributions skyrocketed with the creation of Allied Business PAC before the 1992 elections . Hurtt and his three cohorts quickly became a force , helping elect 12 of the more_than two_dozen conservatives they supported that year . Cruising to Victory Hurtt took the plunge himself when a central Orange County Senate seat was vacated , saying he feared a Democrat might swoop down and defeat a weak field of GOP contenders . He cruised to victory in March , 1993 , with 76 % of the vote . He arrived in the state Capitol and immediately made waves . A newspaper quoted Hurtt as saying he had come_to Sacramento to keep_an_eye_on the candidates Allied helped elect . Later he offended backers of a bill to raise cigarette levies to fund breast-cancer research by suggesting it was part of a &quot; stream of ticky-tack &quot; demands for higher taxes . In another episode , senators blanched after he voted_in committee for a jail construction bond , then joked loudly to a prison_guards lobbyist to remember it when Hurtt came calling_for a campaign contribution . If his freshman year was spent rubbing some politicos the wrong way , Hurtt has smoothed a_few rough edges for 1994 . &quot; I ' m not going_to be a basher , &quot; he said , &quot; but I ' m not going_to be afraid to talk . I think I ' m asking the things the common constituent wants to know. &quot; Some colleagues , however , contend that Hurtt ' s first-year difficulties went beyond snippy rhetoric . They say he failed miserably to heed advice from legislative graybeards , as if oblivious to the Capitol ' s cardinal rules : Experience and knowledge count , and political friendships are based almost as much upon personality as on ideology and money . Those facts smacked Hurtt in the face after he made_noises about challenging Sen . Ken Maddy ( R-Fresno ) for Senate GOP leader . Despite his campaign clout , Hurtt fell far short of the support he needed when the leadership fight came_to a head last fall . &quot; I was quite honest with him and told Rob he needs to pay his dues , &quot; said Sen . Cathie Wright ( R-Simi Valley ) . &quot; Being leader doesn ' t just mean you get Republicans elected. &quot; Hurtt still earned a plum . In a conciliatory gesture , Maddy named him chairman of the Senate ' s new elections committee . Some see it as a shrewd tactical ploy by Maddy -- the leader can take credit for election victories , but blame Hurtt if the GOP stumbles this year . On the legislative front , Hurtt has proven willing to buck the status_quo . He broke from tradition and was the only lawmaker from either party who didn ' t support Lockyer ' s nomination in January for president pro_tem of the Senate . In early March , Hurtt was one of only three Senate Republicans to join in overriding the governor ' s veto of a Democratic illegal immigration bill . Democrats Need Him Despite his impressive victory last year , Hurtt is hardly_a household name in his own district . Democrats , citing their own polling data , say he could be vulnerable in this year ' s election . Hurtt concedes it won ' t be a cakewalk , but remains confident of returning to Sacramento . In some ways the Democrats need Hurtt . That fact was vividly illustrated a_few weeks ago when all 40 senators gathered for an annual photograph . Sen . Tom Hayden , the liberal from Santa Monica best known for his Vietnam-era activism and marriage to actress Jane Fonda , arrived late . Finding his spot , Hayden paused to shake hands with Hurtt . &quot; Photo opportunity ! &quot; one of the senators quipped . &quot; Yeah , but which one will it hurt more ? &quot; remarked another , prompting laughter . It may have been a joke , but therein lies a political truth : Rob Hurtt has become the poster boy for the Democratic fund-raising machine . Just as Republicans for years blackballed competitors by linking them to Hayden , now the Democratic Party is turning the tables by using Hurtt . Never mind if perception might be eclipsing reality . For Democratic candidates eager to stay in power , Hurtt is being portrayed as the champion of religious judgmental ideas . When visiting potential donors , Lockyer totes charts warning of a &quot; theocratic &quot; threat posed by Hurtt and his moneyed allies . The pitch is_well received . &quot; Voters , &quot; Lockyer said , &quot; don ' t want to be governed by extremists. &quot; Hurtt says Lockyer and other critics have it all wrong . Given his way , Hurtt would n ' t force-feed religion , he maintains . Rather , he has a vision of society flipping back the calendar . &quot; I think we ' d all be a lot healthier for it , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t think you ' ll find anyone who feels the country or the people are better_off than they were 10 , 20 , 30 years ago. &quot; Profile : Rob Hurtt 32nd Senate District , R-Garden Grove Personal History * Born : May 19 , 1944 * Family : Wife Nancy and four children , youngest 17 * Education : Claremont McKenna College * Job : Owner of Garden Grove container manufacturing firm Political History * Elected March , 1993 , to seat vacated when former Sen .
