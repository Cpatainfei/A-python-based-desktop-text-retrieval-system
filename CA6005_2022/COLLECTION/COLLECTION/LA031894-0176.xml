   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA TO JOIN NATO ' S PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE PROGRAM ; EUROPE : THE MOVE IS ANNOUNCED AS THE MOSCOW AND WASHINGTON DEFENSE CHIEFS MEET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia said Thursday that it will join NATO ' s Partnership for Peace by the month ' s end and was assured by Defense_Secretary William J . Perry of a major role in the post-Cold War military cooperation program . Gen . Pavel S . Grachev , Russia ' s defense minister , made the announcement after meeting with his American counterpart . Grachev said Russia will sign_up as soon as it prepares a detailed proposal for how it wants to collaborate with the 16-nation North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization . &quot; Since we are a great_power , we have a large amount of tasks to work_out , &quot; Grachev told reporters . U.S. officials welcomed the decision as a sign that Russia , despite friction with NATO over the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the recent exposure of an alleged Russian mole inside the CIA , remains committed to working with the West . &quot; Secretary Perry repeated ( in the meeting ) that Partnership for Peace is something different countries will participate in to different extents depending_upon their resources , their fundamental importance , &quot; a senior U.S. defense official told Reuters news_agency . Perry told Grachev that &quot; he expected , in_view of the size and importance of Russia , that they would have a large and important role in the Partnership for Peace , &quot; the official was quoted as saying . Partnership for Peace emerged last year as a U.S. formula to enable countries of the former Soviet Bloc to engage in joint exercises , training and defense planning with NATO without gaining full membership . Twelve nations have joined so far . The formula is a compromise . Former Soviet satellites -- particularly the Czech Republic , Hungary and Poland -- seek NATO membership as a shield against future Russian aggression . Russia objects to an eastward expansion by NATO , which it views_as a Cold_War alliance that should be weakened . Russian officials made_it clear Thursday that they are joining Partnership for Peace not so_much as a step toward embracing NATO as one toward redefining Europe ' s security arrangements under a broader umbrella with a new identity . &quot; Our accession to this program will enable us to sway its future evolution according to Russia ' s national interests , &quot; Yuri K . Nazarkin , chief of Russia ' s security_council , told a hearing of the Duma , the lower house of Parliament . One of Grachev ' s deputies , Gen . Pavel Zolotarev , said Russia hopes by joining the partnership to obtain &quot; official recognition &quot; from NATO nations of Moscow ' s &quot; special responsibility &quot; to police neighboring countries of the former Soviet_Union . So far , no Western leader has been willing to give Moscow such carte_blanche . Zolotarev said Russia also hopes to develop a new &quot; pan-European security_system &quot; that would effectively supplant NATO . Meanwhile , he said Russia wants to work with NATO to train combat troops for peacekeeping operations , keep terrorists from stealing nuclear or chemical weapons and divide up conventional arms markets in the rest of the world . Government officials testified at the hearing that Russia risks isolation and even the loss of its arms market in Eastern Europe if it delays joining the partnership . &quot; We would be playing a role of outside observer of the political processes in Europe , &quot; Gen . Zolotarev said . &quot; Our opinion would be given less and less heed. &quot; Several lawmakers objected to Partnership for Peace because NATO will set the terms of cooperation by each new partner . &quot; It can only be described as dictating conditions to others , &quot; said Vladimir P . Lukin , chairman of the Duma ' s Foreign Affairs Commission and a former ambassador to the United States . &quot; It reminds me of a compromise of a rapist &quot; who offers his victim a choice between cooperation and violence . The Duma , led by an alliance of Communists and nationalists , has no power to block Russia ' s entry into the partnership or its growing cooperation with NATO . The Russian navy announced Thursday that it will take_part for the first time in large-scale naval maneuvers with other European_nations starting next Monday in the Sea of Norway . After their meeting , Perry said he and Grachev agreed to &quot; work together as equal partners &quot; for peace in Bosnia , despite Russia ' s objections to NATO threats of force against the Bosnian Serbs . The talks with Grachev launched a weeklong visit by Perry to Russia , Kazakhstan , Ukraine and Belarus -- the inheritors of the Soviet nuclear arsenal -- with an agenda of arms control and defense conversion . Having spoken with Grachev on a hot_line linking Washington and Moscow , he said he wanted to forge closer ties between the two defense establishments . &quot; It is not an exaggeration to say that many important national security relationships in the entire world will be influenced by this relationship , &quot; Perry said . &quot; All of the important substantive problems with which we have to work will go much better if we have a close personal understanding. &quot; After the defense chiefs of the former superpower rivals had shaken hands , about 5 # 000 Russians still pining over the breakup of the Soviet_Union held an outdoor rally in central Moscow to mark the third anniversary of the last referendum held_in that country . In it , 74 % of the voters endorsed the idea of keeping the union together ; within nine months it was dead . People at the rally , mostly middle-aged and retired , had mixed views about the partnership . &quot; It is like a surrender ! &quot; exclaimed Anna S . Plyukhina , 64 . &quot; First it is this thing , then it will come_to German generals coming_to Russia , once again ordering us around. &quot; Noting the poor financial state of Russia ' s army , a demonstrator named Vladimir D . Fedotov , 61 , said : &quot; If ( the government ) doesn ' t want to give enough money to the army , then it is quite reasonable to join this partnership . Maybe there our army will get some badly needed dollars. &quot;</TEXT>
