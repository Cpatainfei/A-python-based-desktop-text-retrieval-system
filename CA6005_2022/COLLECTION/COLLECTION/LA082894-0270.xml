BUT WHATEVER THE ODDS OF MAKING IT TO THE TOP , THE SPORT SERVES A LARGER PURPOSE AS A REFUGE FOR YOUTH , WHO DISCOVER A SENSE OF DEDICATION AND PURPOSE IN THE RING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> THE DREAM : A Latino teen-ager wants to help support his impoverished family . He believes he can earn money quickly with his fists . He walks into a gym in East Los Angeles to pursue fame and fortune that others from his neighborhood have found : Paul Gonzales , Genaro ( Chicanito ) Hernandez and Oscar De La Hoya . He has been a successful street_fighter . Now he learns to box . &quot; You ' ll have to work very , very hard if you want to win , &quot; he is told , over and over . His confidence grows as he trains for his first fight . He thinks he is ready . The reality : In his first bout , the teen-ager is getting badly beaten , but refuses to lie_down . By the third round , his face turns cherry , his knees buckle and he drops his hands to his sides when the referee stops the bout . &quot; Why did they stop the fight ? ' &quot; he asks his trainer , who wipes blood from the boy ' s face . &quot; Because you were not punching back , &quot; says the trainer . &quot; You didn ' t train hard enough . Come_back and try again. &quot; * Dreams do come true -- at a cost -- in East Los Angeles , home to some of the best fighters in the world and where boxing has become a way_of_life for thousands , regardless of professional aspirations . East Los Angeles has earned a deserved reputation as a producer of top-flight boxing talent . Many of the nation ' s most talented amateurs come from there , which has also produced two Olympic gold medalists and a handful of world professional champions . Since the days of lightweight contender Art Aragon in the 1940s and ' 50s , boxing has been a force in the Latino community of East Los Angeles , where longtime residents still speak_of the rough-and-tumble tradition of street fights going_back to the ' 20s and ' 30s . Beyond tradition , its appeal owes to a variety of reasons , including economics : gloves , protective gear and a place to train are minimal requirements for a sport and usually available on a loan basis . And with boxing ' s many divisions , an athlete of average or even less than average height and weight can become a champion , whereas other sports demand great size or bulk . At 5-foot-1 and 108 pounds , Humberto ( Chiquita ) Gonzalez is one such champion . &quot; For kids in East L.A. , boxing is still the last_frontier to get_out of the barrio , &quot; said Andy Stanke , boxing trainer at Hollenbeck Youth Center . Helping to perpetuate the dream are professionals such_as Chicanito Hernandez , the World Boxing Assn . junior_lightweight champion who trains at Brooklyn Gym in East Los Angeles . Youths seeking inspiration from a local hero also get_it from the walls themselves . At the Sheriff ' s Department East Los Angeles Community_Center , the image of Gonzalez gazes steadily toward the ring from a portrait painted as part of a mural . Gonzalez , the International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Council light-flyweight champion , trains at the center before he fights at the Forum . Beyond the fame and fortune , boxing is a popular , entrenched form of recreation . Whatever the odds of making_it as a champion , boxing has taken_on a larger purpose . In East Los Angeles , boxing gyms are a refuge for troubled youths . &quot; You see the aggression in them , the way they hit the bags , &quot; said Ray Morales , 33 , a postal worker and a former Golden Gloves champion , as he pointed to a boxer hitting the heavy bag . &quot; They have troubles at school or they don ' t have a father at_home to be a role model. &quot; From Hollenbeck Youth Center and Los Angeles Youth Athletic Club in Boyle Heights , Lincoln Heights Youth Club , Eddie Heredia Boxing Club and East Los Angeles Community_Center in East Los Angeles , dedicated youths train up_to five hours a day , five days a week even when temperatures soar above 90 degrees . Two other gyms -- Cache Boxing in Vernon and Resurrection Boxing Club in East Los Angeles -- train a mixture of amateurs and professionals , while Brooklyn Gym , also in East Los Angeles , is strictly for professionals . There are 1 # 291 amateur boxers formally registered with the Southern California branch of USA Boxing , according to Melanie Ley , Junior Olympic chairwoman . Of those , 85 % have Latino surnames , including about 15 % who live_in the East Los Angeles . Thousands more box or follow the sport avidly . And many in the community are pleased that they do . &quot; It ' s a way to keep them off the streets , &quot; said Morales , head boxing coach at the Sheriff ' s Department community_center . &quot; Most of my kids box for recreational purposes . Right now we ' re fortunate to have a De La Hoya because kids look_at him as a role_model . They want to be the next De La Hoya because they come from poverty-stricken areas. &quot; Councilman Mike Hernandez , who represents District 1 , points_out that Latinos have always been part of boxing history . &quot; It ' s not like baseball , where we ' ve recently become part of the tradition , or football , where we struggle to get Hispanics recruited by even college teams , &quot; Hernandez said . &quot; Latinos have been part of boxing history since the Golden Boy days of Art Aragon , &quot; a lightweight contender during the 1940s and ' 50s . When he was 4 , Hernandez watched his father , Paul , train boxers in a gym in Tijuana . &quot; I ' ve always seen boxing as a very positive sport , &quot; Hernandez said . &quot; It ' s a clean sport with rules . It ' s not street fighting . And there is a certain status that comes_with being a boxer. &quot; From a boxing promoter ' s standpoint , Latino fight fans are &quot; the backbone of the boxing industry , &quot; according to Olympic Auditorium promoter Dan Goossen . &quot; It ' s been proven at the pay-per-view level that they are the biggest boxing fans , &quot; said Goossen , who is also a vice_president of the Top Rank boxing promotion company . &quot; They ' re loyal , devoted and knowledgeable_about the sport . It ' s also a very heavily populated area to find fighters . We don ' t get too many fighters , if any , from the Westside. &quot; One of Top Rank ' s biggest drawing cards is former East Los Angeles resident De La Hoya , a gold medal_winner in the 1992 Olympics . De La Hoya , the World Boxing Organization lightweight champion , was the headliner during the reopening of the Olympic Auditorium in March . &quot; If you want to become an Olympic champion , if you want to become a professional champion , you ' ve got_to dedicate yourself and really train hard , &quot; De La Hoya said . &quot; When I go_to schools and talk to kids , I tell them you ' ve got_to work hard . Nobody can stop you but yourself. &quot; Still , even the hardest-working boxers fail to achieve De La Hoya ' s Golden Boy status . Paul Gonzales became a hero in the community and in the United States when he won the Olympic gold medal in 1984 -- the first Mexican American to win any Olympic medal . But though he achieved tremendous international fame as an amateur , his professional career was beset by false starts and injuries . He recently retired from boxing 10 years after winning his gold medal . Morales estimates the odds to be &quot; one in a_thousand &quot; that one of his boxers will become a world titleholder . But , he says , they will still come_away with a valuable lesson . &quot; We teach them how to box , but we also stress education , &quot; he says . &quot; If they don ' t have the grades , they don ' t box. &quot; Boxers are required to present their report_cards on a quarterly basis . If they fail to meet the grade , they cannot compete , according to Morales . Those that show improvement or have outstanding grades are awarded gym bags and T-shirts . &quot; Few make_it to the top without worrying about getting an education first , &quot; Stanke said . Boxing itself is an education in which athletes learn discipline and motivation that they apply to their classroom studies . At Eddie Heredia Gym , director Chuck Rios shouts instructions to 12-year-old Mario Miranda of Montebello , who is sparring with Mike Anchondo of Norwalk . Anchondo , also 12 , has fought 80 more fights than his opponent and his experience is evident in the ring . &quot; What are you waiting for , Mario ? &quot; Rios said . &quot; Throw more punches . You will connect . You ' re as strong as him. &quot; Heredia Gym specializes in training junior boxers , ages 8 to 15 . &quot; We ' re here to keep kids off drugs and away from the gangs , &quot; Rios said . &quot; These kids are tougher than gang members because they know how to train . The hardest part of boxing is training and that ' s what drives_away the gangbangers. &quot; Miranda shows promise as a boxer , but it ' s in the classroom where he has started to excel . He said he had a straight-A report_card during the past two quarters at Montebello Intermediate School . &quot; My grades were OK until I started boxing , &quot; Miranda said . Now &quot; I don ' t go outside and play . I go_to school and I train . that ' s all I have time for. &quot; Like many Latino youths , Miranda became indoctrinated into boxing through Spanish-language newspapers such_as La Opinion , which covers boxing with the same fervor that the English-language press devotes to the Super Bowl . &quot; I learned about boxing by reading the papers and watching old videos , &quot; he said . Joe Morales of East Los Angeles , the father of 9-year-old boxer Ricardo , said he takes his two sons to the Forum twice a month to watch boxing . He also collects newspaper_articles about boxing and shows them to his sons . &quot; I feel good to have my son out of the streets doing something fun , &quot; said Morales , who also has another son . &quot; I like my children to be professionals , but that will be their decision when the time comes. &quot; Salvador Garcia Jr. , 15 , of East Los Angeles is the nation ' s top-ranked Junior Olympic amateur in the 90-pound weight class for 15- and 16-year-olds . He took the gold medal in the Elite Junior Olympic program box-offs Aug . 5 in Colorado Springs , Colo. , and was scheduled to compete Friday and Saturday in the USA-Ireland Junior Olympic duals in Dublin , Ireland . Garcia ' s grandfather was an amateur fighter in Mexico and his father fought professionally in Tijuana . &quot; My father was a professional boxer for four months , &quot; Garcia said . &quot; And my mother likes the sport too . She pushes me because she knows I have a chance to be a champion. &quot; Said Irma Garcia , Salvador ' s mother : &quot; I like boxing because I feel something inside . When I see my son box , I get excited because it ' s in my blood. &quot; Salvador , a sophomore at Roosevelt High , said he struggled in school until he took_up boxing 1 1 / 2 years ago . Now he has a 3.5 grade-point average . &quot; Before I used to hang_out in the streets with my friends , &quot; Garcia said . &quot; Now it ' s boxing , homework and that ' s it. &quot; Ley , of the Junior Olympics program , said that parents for the most part support their children in boxing . &quot; You will hardly ever find a mother who covers her eyes when Junior is boxing , &quot; Ley said . &quot; There have been some mothers who object to boxing , but not recently and I can ' t think_of anybody from East L.A. &quot; Death is a fact of life , though , in a violent sport , no matter how skilled the participants . Critics point to the recent ring death of Wangila Napunyi , who died after suffering major head injuries during a welterweight fight with David Gonzalez in Las Vegas . Dr. Robert O . Voy , USA Boxing Sports Medicine Committee chairman , countered that youths have a greater chance of getting killed in a car accident than in a boxing ring . In his 1992 article &quot; ' Boxing Bashers ' on the Bandwagon . . . Again , &quot; Voy estimated the odds of a youth dying in a ring to be 1 in 100 # 000 while his chances of getting killed by a car are 6 in 100 # 000 . Still , getting knocked_down is a painful experience . During his workout at the community_center , Garcia ' s neighbor , 10-year-old Bobby Dominguez , took a hard shot to the chin . Dominguez , who said he has been knocked_down in three fights , said he gave_up karate to become a boxer after watching Julio Cesar Chavez of Mexico fight Pernell Whitaker to draw_in a World Boxing Council welterweight title fight last year . &quot; I want to be a world champion like Chavez , &quot; Dominguez said . Hernandez said East L.A. youth centers that provide boxing have already paid dividends . &quot; We ' re seeing teen-agers who were once gang members coming_into the gyms to settle their differences , &quot; Hernandez said . Some former gang members have become Explorer Scouts with law_enforcement agencies after boxing at East L.A. police divisions . &quot; We ' re also seeing fighters like Paul Gonzales and Oscar De La Hoya becoming bigger role_models because they once fought in these gyms , &quot; he said . As part of the Hollenbeck boxing program , Stanke helps his prized pupils get part-time jobs with local businesses while they train . &quot; We believe it ' s important that kids touch hands with community leaders , &quot; Stanke said . &quot; Some continue working with the same business years after they quit boxing . &quot; Although boxing is a tool , we utilize this tool to turn kids into good citizens . Boxing is a hard game and only a select few make_it to the top. &quot; Times staff writer David Avila contributed to this report . On the Cover Boxing instructor David Aguayo spars with Jamie Cuevas , 11 , at the Sheriff ' s Department East Los Angeles Community_Center . For more_than 50 years , boxing has been a cultural phenomenon in East Los Angeles , producing top-ranked contenders and champions and teaching youths about discipline and commitment . &quot; In East L.A. , you learn to fight before you learn to cry , &quot; said Eddie ( The Animal ) Lopez , a former heavyweight contender .</TEXT>
