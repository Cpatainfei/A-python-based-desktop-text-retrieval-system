   <HEADLINE> EAST VALLEY FOCUS : SUN VALLEY ; PLAY AIMS TO SNUFF_OUT KIDS ' DESIRE TO SMOKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fairy tales have come a long way , baby . Cinderella ' s evil stepsisters are not only mean and nasty , but they smoke cigarettes . Jack , formerly associated with a certain beanstalk , traded_in his beloved bovine for a share of the tobacco_industry . These stories are told in the form of an anti-smoking and anti-tobacco play put_on by members of the Valley Community Clinic for schoolchildren , to teach them the dangers of smoking and how to overcome peer pressure . Loosely modeled after Stephen Sondheim ' s musical &quot; Into the Woods , &quot; the play is called &quot; Into the Smoke , &quot; and was performed in front of the students at Fernangeles Elementary School in Sun Valley on Tuesday . Intertwining the stories of Jack and Cinderella , the play touches_on issues of peer pressure , nicotine_addiction and self-esteem to give children the tools to make educated decisions about smoking later in life . &quot; If we can get them now to have enough information , then they won ' t indulge ( in smoking ) , &quot; said Reasie Flagg , the director of the clinic ' s Tobacco Education Project . The play opens with Jack en route to the market to sell his cow when he is stopped by a sneaky tobacco dealer . The dealer pressures Jack into trading the cow in_for tobacco seeds by telling him he ' s a &quot; mama ' s boy &quot; if he doesn ' t agree . Meanwhile , Cinderella ' s -- or rather Cindy ' s -- sisters , Bronchitis , Emphysema and Leukoplakia , have decided to start smoking and chewing tobacco to make them look beautiful and cool so they can win the attention of the bachelor prince . &quot; If we can get a cigarette , the prince would surely marry one of us , &quot; they conclude . &quot; We ' re doing exactly what the billboards and magazine ads have been telling us to do ! &quot; Jack ' s tobacco seeds grow_into an enormous stalk and Cindy ' s sisters buy leaves from him . As Jack grows rich , he wonders why people keep coming_back for more tobacco when a magic fairy godmother explains what nicotine_addiction is . Cindy starts to consider smoking too , when the same fairy godmother appears and tells her that smoking and chewing tobacco can cause cancer . Eventually , the prince , who ends_up being Jack in a bizarre twist of the plot , declares that he only wants a nonsmoker for a wife and chooses Cindy , and they start an anti-smoking organization together to educate the people around them . At least one member of the audience got the message . Fred Figueroa , 8 , said he will never smoke even if his friends try to pressure him into starting . &quot; I ' ll just say , ' I don ' t smoke . It might kill you , ' &quot; Fred declared . MAKI BECKER</TEXT>
