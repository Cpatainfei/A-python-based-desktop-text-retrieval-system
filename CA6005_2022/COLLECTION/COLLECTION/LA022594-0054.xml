   <TEXT> In the true Canadian tradition of &quot; Tape an aspirin to it and get_back out there , &quot; Canadian center Greg Johnson proved his toughness the other night . Johnson was hit in the face by a shot from teammate Brian Savage 1:45 into overtime and had to be helped off the ice for treatment.He needed stitches to close the cut and stop the bleeding , and was ready to take his next shift , but he never made_it back . &quot; The guy put_in two stitches and then we scored the ( game-winning ) goal , and he said , ' Oh , we ' re done , ' &quot; Johnson said . &quot; I had to go_back inside so he could finish it later. &quot; Johnson ended_up with six stitches and a new bend in his nose . &quot; It ' s my first broken nose , &quot; he said . &quot; But I ' m sure it won ' t be my last. &quot; * Finland is a 3-2 favorite over Canada in today ' s hockey semifinal , but Finnish Coach Curt Lindstrom , who owns a betting parlor , disagrees . &quot; It should be more even , maybe 2-2 , &quot; he said . &quot; I think it ' s 50-50 . Canada has now beaten Sweden and Czechoslovakia and they have a strong team. &quot; * U.S. goaltender Mike Dunham , who started in Thursday ' s 5-3 loss to the Czech Republic , criticized Coach Tim Taylor . &quot; I really wasn ' t given the chance to become what I could have been , &quot; said Dunham , who played in the tournament-opening 4-4 tie with France and the team ' s 6-4 loss to Sweden . &quot; I ' m a little down . I wanted to come_out and show I could play . &quot; I don ' t think it mattered who was in there ( Wednesday ) night ( in a 6-1 loss to Finland ) . But it was tough watching , tough coming_back for another Olympics and not being able to do what I wanted to do . I don ' t feel_like I reached my potential. &quot; HELENE ELLIOTT</TEXT>
