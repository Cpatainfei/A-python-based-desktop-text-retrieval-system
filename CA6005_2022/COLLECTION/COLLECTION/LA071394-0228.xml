   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; ANTITRUST PROBE OF SONY , PHILIPS FOCUSES ON LICENSING PRACTICES ; MUSIC : THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS FIRMS JOINTLY CHARGED FEES FOR USE OF COMPACT_DISC TECHNOLOGY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Justice_Department has launched an antitrust investigation into an arrangement between Sony Corp . and Philips Electronics that has helped the two consumer electronics_companies dominate the compact_disc business for more_than a decade . The two companies agreed in the 1970s to cross-license each other ' s patents on CD technology , enabling them to jointly charge patent licensing_fees to dozens of disc manufacturers . That has enabled them to exert control over innovations in the manufacturing process . Spokeswomen from both Sony and Philips declined to comment on the investigation , first reported in the Wall_Street Journal on Tuesday . A Justice_Department spokeswoman confirmed that it has &quot; opened an investigation into licensing practices in the optical disc area. &quot; Quixote Corp. , which presses 70 million discs a year for recording companies and CD-ROM publishers , is one of several companies to have received subpoenas from the Justice_Department in recent weeks requesting documents about their agreements with Sony and Philips . Like every_other U.S. disc manufacturer , the firm pays Sony and Philips a 6-cent royalty fee for each disc . &quot; that ' s not an insubstantial sum , &quot; said James DeVries , executive_vice_president of the Chicago-based firm , which is in the midst of expanding its Anaheim plant . &quot; And it ' s the consumer that pays it in the end. &quot; It ' s also the record companies . Retail sales of music compact_discs in the United States totaled $ 6.5 billion last year . Music industry executives declined to comment Tuesday but said they are watching the investigation carefully . Most troubling to some industry executives is the hold Sony and Philips have exercised over the design of the discs . Under the terms of the license , Sony and Philips require some companies to follow detailed specifications regarding size , thickness and other characteristics . With the emergence of CD-ROMs -- compact_discs that hold images , video and text as well as music -- dozens of companies have been experimenting with methods to squeeze more data onto the shiny discs . &quot; It ' s really a negative if Philips and Sony are using this to stifle new technologies on the disc , &quot; said Norman Bastins , executive_vice_president of Compton ' s New Media . But he added , &quot; On the positive side , without this patent setting some standards , we ' d have players all_over the board. &quot; Antitrust experts said the investigation reflects the agenda of the Justice_Department ' s new antitrust chief , Anne Bingaman , who announced in April that high-technology would be a focus of the her department ' s work . &quot; The antitrust division recognizes that in the 1990s , control of technology and intellectual property , patents , licenses is key to controlling market share_in an industry , &quot; said Barbara Reeves , a partner with Morrison &amp; Foerster in Los Angeles . &quot; The reason you ' re given a patent is to reward and encourage your innovation , but when people misuse that legal monopoly to make_it reach further -- such_as by cross-licensing -- that raises competitive concerns. &quot; DiscoVision Associates , an Irvine-based subsidiary of Pioneer Electronics that owns several patents on compact_disc technology , was also subpoenaed in the investigation . Ronald Clark , the company ' s senior_vice_president , said the firm has no joint licensing_agreements with Sony and Philips . &quot; We do not have any difficulty with Sony . We do not have any difficulty with Philips . We are independently licensing our patents , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
