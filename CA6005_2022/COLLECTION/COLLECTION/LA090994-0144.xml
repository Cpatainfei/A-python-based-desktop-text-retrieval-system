   <HEADLINE> SHUTTLE SET FOR LAUNCH AFTER PROBLEMS SOLVED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> NASA said its countdown was back on track for a mission in which six astronauts and a laser laboratory will be carried into orbit today by space shuttle Discovery . Launch is scheduled at 1:30 p.m. PDT today . Ground_crews had been several hours behind on critical countdown chores earlier Thursday . But late in the day , NASA said all technical concerns had been resolved and that nothing stood_in Discovery ' s way . Even Florida ' s persistently fickle weather seemed willing to yield . Forecasters said there was an 80 % chance of good_conditions during the launch period . Technicians are to begin filling the shuttle ' s big external tank with fuel at 5:10 a.m. PDT . A highlight of the 64th shuttle mission will be a spacewalk -- the first in 10 years in which astronauts will float entirely free_of their spaceship . Two crewmen will forsake tethers to test a new jet backpack intended as a rescue aid for astronauts who will construct a future space_station .</TEXT>
