   <TEXT> Bavarian-born filmmaker Percy Adlon has a special knack for making believable and engaging the seemingly most unlikely friendships and romances . In &quot; Celeste &quot; he explored a loving bond between the ailing Marcel Proust and his sturdy , unsophisticated but unswervingly devoted housekeeper . In &quot; Sugarbaby &quot; he delved into a romance between a zaftig and confident mortuary worker and a handsome subway_train driver , and in &quot; Bagdad Cafe &quot; he established a devoted , mutually supportive tie between an unresourceful stranded German woman and the overworked African American proprietor of a ramshackle motel and restaurant . Now in the endearing , remarkably assured and stunning-looking &quot; Salmonberries , &quot; a kind of serious -- yet humor-spiked -- counterpart of &quot; Bagdad Cafe , &quot; Adlon takes_on his greatest challenge yet , letting us wonder whether a friendship forged against all odds can turn_into a romance . To tell his offbeat story -- and just as unexpectedly evoke the need for reconciliation between the reunited Germanys -- Adlon has selected a locale even more remote than the desert roadside compound of &quot; Bagdad Cafe. &quot; It ' s the actual northwestern Alaskan outpost of Kotzebue , a tiny community of utilitarian tar_paper houses , converted barracks and house_trailers . For 21 years it has been home to the local librarian , Roswitha ( Rosel Zech ) , now 45 , an elegant , formal East_German emigre who has suddenly become the object of the attentions of a youth inarticulate to_the_point of rage . Not until the youth stops knocking books off shelves and instead abruptly disrobes does Roswitha realize that her suitor is a woman , played by k.d lang ( whose haunting song &quot; Barefoot &quot; is heard on the soundtrack ) . Abandoned in Kotzebue as a baby , she bears the name of the town itself . Craving friendship , love and a sense of identity , Kotzebue is so doggedly persistent that she breaks_down the severe Roswitha ' s resistance to the extent that she actually enables this remote woman to confront a tragic past that has had her in its thrall the entire time she ' s been in Alaska . Roswitha ' s only joy has come_in gathering salmonberries , but her increasing reclusiveness means that her shelf-lined bedroom is now crowded with jars of the preserved berries that she had intended to give_away . With the utmost sensitivity , Adlon raises crucial questions of cultural and sexual identity . There are a_couple_of deft moments from the late Chuck Connors as Kotzebue ' s seedy foster_father and a wrenching scene played almost wordlessly by German actor Wolfgang Steinberg , but &quot; Salmonberries , &quot; gorgeously photographed by Tom Sigel , is by and large a two-character story , and novice actress lang is as impressive as the veteran Zech . After lang asked Adlon to direct a music video for her , he wrote the script of &quot; Salmonberries &quot; especially for her . Unaccountably , this prize-winning film has had to wait for more_than two years for a theatrical release . * MPAA rating : Unrated .
