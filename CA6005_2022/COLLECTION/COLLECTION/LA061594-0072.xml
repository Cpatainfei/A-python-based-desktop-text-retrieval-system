   <HEADLINE> FUTURE OF COUNTY ' S TRANSIT IS RIDING_ON FISCAL SOLUTIONS ; FINANCE : SHORTFALL IS EXPECTED TO REACH $ 1 BILLION OVER NEXT 20 YEARS . VOTERS MAY BE ASKED TO CONSIDER A HALF-CENT SALES TAX .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the battle pitting Ventura County advocates for roads and buses against defenders of commuter_train service , both sides agree on one thing : There is not enough transportation money to go_around . California ' s budget problems have forced funding cutbacks and project delays in transportation programs throughout the state . And as cities and counties implement strict federal mandates to cut_down on traffic and smog , gas tax_revenues that make_up the lion ' s share of transportation budgets are dwindling . Strapped for cash and hoping to stave_off choosing between buses , trains and roads , Ventura County is scrambling to come_up with new funds for transportation . And county residents are being asked to fork over a larger share of the cost . In Ventura County alone , the transportation funding shortfall is expected to reach $ 1 billion over the next 20 years . As the county spends an increasing amount_of_money on Metrolink trains and countywide buses , and as the cost of road repairs returns to pre-recession levels , that funding will continue to shrink . &quot; We ' re in a situation where we just don ' t have the money to support all_the transportation services in this county , &quot; said Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo , who also serves on the county ' s Transportation Commission . &quot; The whole lineup is like dominoes. &quot; Chris Stephens , planner for the Ventura County Transportation Commission , agreed . &quot; Financially we are in a very tight spot right now , &quot; Stephens said . &quot; We ' re down to the basic programs and , without more funding , we ' re looking_at not being able to fill potholes or run buses. &quot; Ginger Gherardi , executive_director of the Ventura County Transportation Commission , said unless residents shoulder more of the financial burden , transportation services will be lost . In November , voters may be asked to consider a half-cent sales tax that would raise more_than $ 500 million for transportation projects over the next 20 years . The Transportation Commission later this month will decide whether to recommend that the measure be placed on the ballot . The final_decision is up_to the Board of Supervisors and the cities . At least half the cities representing half the county ' s population must agree to place the measure on the ballot . * If approved , the measure would boost the county ' s current sales tax from 7 1 / 4 cents to 7 3 / 4 cents . &quot; We need to somehow get the message across , &quot; Gherardi said . &quot; Either we are going_to take_charge of these things ourselves or continue to be at the mercy of state and federal sources that are out of our control. &quot; But while transportation leaders agree that more funding is needed , many doubt that residents still reeling from the recession will agree to pay more taxes . &quot; This is not the right time to be asking people to pay more , &quot; said Bill Davis , a transportation commissioner and Simi Valley city councilman . &quot; Yes , we need the dollars , but we ' ve yet to show people that we ' re going to put them to good use. &quot; If last week ' s election is any indication , however , voters may be reluctant to spend more money on transportation . Voters rejected Proposition 1A , a statewide , $ 750-million bond measure to pay_for seismic retrofitting of bridges throughout California , including 27 bridges in Ventura County . Voters did approve a countywide initiative that will allow Ventura County to dip_into a state transit fund worth up_to $ 1.5 million a year and more . * But passage of Measure X does not require the expenditure of any additional funds . Rather , money from an existing statewide gas tax fund will now be available for transit projects in Ventura County . Those funds can be tapped only if they are matched by local money , but county transit leaders say without a new source of revenue the county will not be able to gain access to the money . Supporters of the sales tax measure say the tax would provide those needed matching funds and make the county more competitive for a host of statewide funding programs . &quot; The biggest problem with not having the sales tax is that we ' re not on a_level playing_field with all_the other counties who have them , &quot; said Ken Gilbert , Moorpark ' s public works director . &quot; We pay_out money in gas taxes , but when grants come_up , we don ' t have the matching funds to go_out and compete for them. &quot; Ventura County is the largest county in the state and the only county in Southern California without a local transportation sales tax . More_than 80 % of the state ' s population lives in the 17 counties that have approved such a tax , and Los Angeles County has approved two such taxes . But Ventura County ' s voters overwhelmingly rejected a similar measure placed on the ballot in 1990 . * Besides Los Angeles County , other counties with a half-cent sales tax are : Orange , Riverside , San Bernardino , San Diego , Santa Barbara , Sacramento , San Francisco , Contra Costa , Alameda , Santa Clara , Fresno , San Joaquin , San Benito , San Mateo , Imperial and Madera . The first such tax was enacted by state legislation in 1969 to help complete the commuter_train system in the Bay Area . But it wasn ' t until the mid-1980s that counties began seeking voter approval for local sales tax increases for transportation . Counties saw the local tax as a reliable source of locally controlled funding , without the restrictions that usually come_with state and federal money , said William Fulton , an independent Ventura-based urban planner . &quot; The transportation tax has become the most politically acceptable way to finance major transportation improvement projects , &quot; Fulton said . &quot; The key to making_it work is to put the tax into a larger planning context. &quot; Supervisor John K . Flynn , who supports the tax measure , said he hopes its advocates in Ventura County have learned from mistakes they made in the last campaign . &quot; It was a terrible campaign that really turned people off , &quot; Flynn said . &quot; All they could see was more money for more roads , more housing and more development. &quot; Some local leaders oppose placing the tax on the ballot in November because there is not enough time to prepare a successful campaign . &quot; The shrinking funding pot is an old story that ' s not going_to go_away anytime soon , &quot; Ventura City_Manager John Baker said . &quot; This sales tax is going_to fail because there is no time to put_together a comprehensive transportation plan for the county. &quot; * Steven B . Colman ) , a Bay Area consultant who has worked_on several transportation tax campaigns in California , said that lack of preparation time may_not be Ventura County ' s biggest hurdle in trying to pass the tax . &quot; I used to think a lot of lead time would help , but I ' ve seen these things passed with very little time to prepare , &quot; Colman said . &quot; The real problem , the reason why nobody else is looking seriously at a tax right now , is the economy. &quot; Gaining support for any sales tax measure in the fall would be difficult , Colman said , not only because of the lingering recession but because just last November voters passed Proposition 172 , approving the use of a statewide half-cent sales tax for police and other safety services . &quot; There comes a point when people reach a threshold and say , ' Enough , ' &quot; Colman said . &quot; I think it might be wise_to hold_off and wait for a better time. &quot; But supporters of the measure say the county needs more money now . They also point_out that many of the counties that have gained voter approval for a transportation sales tax have succeeded on the second or third try . &quot; After the tax was defeated here in 1990 , an editorial ran in the local paper that said ' try again , ' &quot; commission Director Gherardi said . &quot; I think that ' s a good message for today. &quot; If the sales tax measure is placed on the November ballot , there will be little the commission can do to promote it . Legally , the commission , which is a government body , cannot take an active role in any campaign . * Gherardi said she hopes local businesses that need to meet smog control mandates will support the measure as a way to help pay_for improved public_transit . But even if the half-cent sales tax passes in November , it would not necessarily solve all_of Ventura County ' s transportation woes . &quot; If the tax is approved , it isn ' t going_to fix every street in every city , &quot; transportation Commissioner Michael Wooten said . &quot; The money will more likely go_to pay_for Metrolink and other countywide services. &quot; Indeed , every_other Southern California county has both a sales tax and a transportation budget problem . A governmental planning consortium that compiles planning data for Ventura County and four other Southern California counties projects a $ 5-billion transportation funding shortfall for the five-county area over the next 15 years . In addition to Ventura County , the area includes the counties of Los Angeles , Riverside , Orange and San Bernardino . But city and county leaders say a new funding source would ease the pressure on cities facing the prospect of spending local bus and road money on Metrolink . &quot; There is no doubt that a sales tax would go_a_long_way in helping us hang_on to our local transportation services , &quot; said Samia Maximous , Oxnard transportation manager . &quot; Without it , we are really going_to face some hard times. &quot; Local leaders are counting_on other possible funding sources to either complement a sales tax or help the county limp along without one . In November , voters throughout the state will consider a $ 1-billion rail bond initiative . It is the third of three $ 1-billion measures designed to pay_for rail and highway projects . In 1990 , voters approved the first bond measure . In 1992 , they rejected the second one . By turning_back the second of the three measures , voters prompted a restructuring of the state ' s transportation improvement program that delayed or scaled_down dozens of highway projects . * Highways are affected by the rail bond measures because the state Legislature has mandated that funding for all transportation projects be divided equitably throughout the state based on complicated fund-sharing formulas . But because projects are planned years in_advance , residents have yet to witness the worst of the effects of their decision to reject the bond measure . &quot; In a way it ' s too_bad , &quot; Gherardi said . &quot; Because if people could see what damage it is doing not to have the funding , they might be more willing to vote for the third bond measure in the fall. &quot; Whatever the outcome of the November election , the county and some cities are raising money for road projects another way : by charging developers fees based on the effect they predict new homes and business will have_on traffic . Thousand Oaks , Simi Valley , Oxnard , Ventura and Camarillo already charge traffic impact fees . The fee for a single-family house ranges from $ 224 in Simi Valley to $ 5 # 200 in Ventura . A proposed countywide program would levy a fee in unincorporated areas , ranging from $ 1 # 500 to $ 21 # 000 per house , depending_on the extent of road improvements county officials decide is needed . The county is also seeking to work_out agreements with each of its cities to come_up with a standardized countywide fee formula . But transit officials said it is not likely that such a fee would come_close to covering the costs of maintaining and upgrading roads and public_transit in Ventura County . &quot; Unless we get some more money in here one way or another , there are going_to be some very unhappy people , &quot; Gherardi said . &quot; Everyone is going_to suffer. &quot; Where Transportation Money Comes From . . . Each year , Ventura County receives about $ 64 million in state and federal funding for transportation . Contributions from each source varies from year to yea , but totals remain the same . State gas tax : 31 % State &amp; federal gas tax : 28 % Federal gas tax : 19 % State sales tax : 22 % . . . and where it goes Streets and roads : 53 % Planning * * : 2 % Public_transit : 17 % Highways : 28 % * Includes Metrolink , VISTA , city bus_services * * Includes studies etc .
