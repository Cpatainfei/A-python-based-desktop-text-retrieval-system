   <HEADLINE> GRAIN COOKING ; TALES FROM THE BULGUR BELT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bulgur is more_than just something to make tabbouleh with . It ' s also more_than a quick-cooking rice substitute . In its Near Eastern home , bulgur ' s special qualities -- the sweet earthiness of wheat , the textural possibilities of its graininess , the fact that it can be mixed with other ingredients without further cooking -- make_it the basis of a wide variety of soups and stews and snacks , both meaty and vegetarian . Its quick-cooking qualities are certainly appreciated in the Near_East , of course . Bulgur has replaced raw wheat grains in a number of ancient dishes that once upon a time had to cook all night . And tabbouleh isn ' t a health-food cliche there ; it ' s a light , refreshing treat . Bulgur is the sort of thing that couldn ' t have been invented in a cold climate . These days , bulgur is usually made in factories , but the traditional technique ( still used in small villages ) depends_on the fact that in the Near_East , wheat is harvested in July or August , when the weather is still hot , rather than in the fall . When the crop is in , people boil the wheat grains in huge pots a yard or two across , a job that requires somebody to stay_up all night_watching the fire and stirring the pot from time to time . When the wheat grains swell and are thoroughly cooked , they are spread_out to dry on the flat rooftops . Traditionally the wheat is carried upstairs by children , who are paid in spoonfuls of the tasty brown crust that has formed on the bottom of the pot . When the summer sun has dried the wheat and the grains have shriveled and hardened , the wheat is hulled . Then a traveling artisan comes_around to grind the bulgur in a portable , hand-turned mill . He doesn ' t grind it to the fineness of flour , because it ' s made from a hard_wheat , which resists grinding fine ; like durum semolina , it comes_out more or less as grits . The ground bulgur is sieved into three or four size grades , ranging from coarse , for soups and stews , to very fine , for particular uses such_as certain delicate pilafs . * The essence of bulgur is that it is precooked . As anybody who has made tabbouleh knows , just soaking it in water is enough to make_it ready to eat ( although perhaps in need of some flavoring ) . Unlike raw grain , it can be chewed and digested without further cooking . This is obviously a great convenience , but nobody seems to know exactly when or where this clever idea arose . Near Eastern cookbooks from the 10th and 13th centuries don ' t say anything about bulgur . The reason might be that medieval books mostly described haute cuisine and ignored many everyday foods , but their silence might also mean that bulgur was simply invented later than the 13th Century . Unfortunately , all_the theories about the origin of bulgur tend to fizzle_out at some point . A lot of people believe the Turks invented it , and the word bulgur is often confidently said to be Turkish , but there ' s no linguistic reason to think so . Nothing like the word is found in any language related to Turkish -- not even in Azerbaijani , which is practically a dialect of the language spoken in Turkey . The likeliest candidate for the origin of the word appears to be palkhurd , which is a Kurdish word for &quot; crushed , &quot; referring to crushed grain ; its basic meaning is something like &quot; small pebbles &quot; or maybe &quot; crushed with stones. &quot; The word bulghur has the same meaning ( &quot; crushed grain &quot; ) in Persian -- in the 14th Century a wisecracking Persian poet wrote , &quot; I obtained a_thousand bulghur : one spoonful of grits from the rounded soup pot &quot; -- and it ' s conceivable that palkhurd , or something like it , might have become bulghur in Persian . This theory would be a bit more convincing if the unique thing about bulgur were that it was crushed , but raw cracked wheat has always been around . Unfortunately , we can ' t tell whether the 14th-Century bulghur was precooked , and modern Iranian cooks rarely use bulgur . To add_to the confusion , Kurds themselves actually call bulgur sawar , a word they borrowed from their Armenian neighbors , who call it tsavar . At any rate , it ' s clear where bulgur arose : somewhere around the southern border of present-day Turkey . A lot of nationalities rub shoulders here -- Arabs , Armenians , Turks , Kurds and the Aramaic-speaking Christians known as Assyrians . Whichever group it originated among , the Turks were the ones who spread bulgur to places within their empire such_as Egypt , Yemen , Cyprus and Tunisia . In these new homes , bulgur gained only a relatively small foothold . It ' s still in Syria , Lebanon , northern Iraq and Turkey and among the Armenians -- in the Armenian republic , and even more so among the western Armenians who escaped the massacres in Turkey at the beginning of this century -- that bulgur is most used . * So what do they make from it ? Tabbouleh , of course , the Lebanese and Syrian appetizer that spread widely in the Near_East and beyond during this century . The original version is a parsley and mint salad given a little heft with bulgur , not the green-flecked porridge a lot of health_food restaurants make . It also has a heartier Turkish cousin called kisir , made with hot_peppers in place of mint . The most obvious use of bulgur is as_a_whole grain like rice . Cooks everywhere stuff vegetables with it and make_it into pilaf . Burghul bi-dfin is a rich Syrian pilaf loaded with garbanzos , tiny onions and chunks of stewed lamb . This , like keshkek -- a sort of meat porridge known to Armenian , Kurdish , Turkish , Iraqi and ( in ancient times ) Iranian cooks -- may be one of the dishes that was made with whole wheat before bulgur was invented . Like rice , bulgur goes_into soups , above all_in Armenia , a bulgur-oriented land known for very hearty soups . In spas and its more substantial cousin tanabur , the flavoring is yogurt , and kirchik gets a little sourness from sauerkraut . But the major use of bulgur is kibbeh -- also known as kubba ( Iraq ) , kobeiba ( Egypt ) , bulgur koftesi ( Turkey ) and kuefte ( western Armenia ) . One Arabic cookbook gives altogether 30 kibbeh recipes , including a couple made from gazelle meat . Kibbeh could be described as a glorified meatloaf / meatball mixture , made by moistening a cup or two of bulgur and then pounding or grinding it with a chopped onion and a pound of meat until it ' s a smooth paste . ( Using a very fine grade of bulgur and a food_processor , this can take a minute or so , not all afternoon , as it does with a mortar and pestle. ) Kibbeh can be grilled on a skewer , baked in a pan ( like a sort of meat baklava ) , deep-fried or poached in liquid -- broth , yogurt sauce , tahineh sauce , tomato_sauce , or even a hearty vegetable_soup , which is preferred in northern Iraq . For both frying or poaching , the mixture is usually made into a sort of torpedo-shaped meatball with a stuffing of fried meat , onions , nuts , raisins and the_like . In some places , such_as the northern Iraqi city of Mosul , the meatball is large and rather flat , made by joining two thin patties of meat around the filling . Christians form a near majority in Lebanon and a sizable minority in Syria and northern Iraq . To observe their fast_days , they have invented meatless forms of kibbeh , such_as kibbet al-rahib ( &quot; monk ' s kibbeh &quot; : balls of bulgur cooked with fried onions ) and kibbet al-hileh ( &quot; trick kibbeh , &quot; where the balls of bulgur are stewed with lentils ) . * During Lent , Armenians make topik , a larger bulgur ball that includes ground garbanzos , with a walnut and currant stuffing . The Armenian vospov kuefteh is balls of bulgur and lentils flavored with chiles , parsley and mint . In fact , bulgur and lentils often go together in the Near_East , both in pilafs and in stews . In Syria , marshusha is bulgur cooked with spinach , black-eyed_peas and lots of onions fried in olive_oil . Shalbatu is bulgur with fried onions and eggplants and abu shalhub is a stew of bulgur with fried eggplants and cabbage , flavored with garlic and cilantro . In Turkey , moistened bulgur is mixed with tomatoes , onions , walnuts , peppers and herbs and made into patties called batirik that are served raw . The Assyrian Christians make bread_dough with flour and bulgur that ' s been soaked in water overnight and bake it into little pizzas with a topping of tahineh . The part of the world where bulgur originated is also the general area where wheat was domesticated in the first place , and it makes uses of wheat that aren ' t found elsewhere , such_as kishk and tarkhana . There are innumerable recipes for these products , but typically you soak bulgur with yeast or yogurt and let it sit for a_couple_of days . Some versions are eaten raw , others are dried and added_to soup , and still others are squeezed_for their sour juices , which flavor soups . In Egypt , yogurt and bulgur are kneaded together , formed into balls and dried into the sun to make little balls of kishk that are eaten as a sour , chewy snack . All these traditional fermented or semi-fermented foods have a combination of sharp flavor and pungent aroma that doesn ' t seem likely to sweep this nation off its feet the way tabbouleh did . Of course , you never know . Finally , there are some sweet bulgur dishes , such_as the Armenian bulghurapur , a soup of bulgur , grape syrup and walnuts . The Turks make a similar dish called kesme bulamac , adding sesame and spices . Oddly , despite the sweet , earthy wheat flavor of of bulgur , people in Syria and Iraq often claim to prefer rice . Rice is both milder and more aromatic that bulgur , it ' s famously easy to digest , and it cooks_up whiter , making_for a more striking appearance on the table . Perhaps most important , it doesn ' t grow in the bulgur belt , so it ' s an expensive import , a prestige grain . So a Lebanese proverb goes , &quot; Honor to rice -- and bulgur can hang itself. &quot; In an Iraqi folk_song , somebody asks , &quot; O people of heaven , o people of hell , what do you eat ? &quot; and the people in heaven turn_out to live_on rice and apricots , while the people in hell eat bulgur and tomatoes . But hey , that doesn ' t sound so bad . Armenian cuisine is rich_in soups , many of them made tart with yogurt and thickened with bulgur . This version is flavored with sauerkraut .
