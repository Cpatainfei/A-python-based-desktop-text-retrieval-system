   <HEADLINE> IN BELGIUM , DOLE PRAISES EUROPE ' S BOSNIA EFFORTS ; DIPLOMACY : REPUBLICAN LEADER ATTEMPTS TO BLUNT THE IMPACT OF EARLIER REMARKS CRITICAL OF ALLIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Attempting to ease deepening tensions between the United States and its European allies over how to resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina , Sen . Bob Dole on Tuesday praised the courage of French and British forces serving in the region as U.N. peacekeepers and said he understood the difficulties of their job . The Kansas Republican , who will become the Senate majority_leader in January , also expressed strong support for the 16-nation Atlantic Alliance that has bound the United States and Canada with 14 European_countries for nearly half a century . &quot; I know we ' ve got a big corner to turn ( in Bosnia ) . . . but I ' m a strong supporter of NATO and continue to be a strong supporter , &quot; Dole told reporters here after a day of meetings at North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization headquarters . &quot; We ' ve made an investment in NATO , and it ' s paid_off for Americans , we believe , &quot; he said at another point . In both tone and content , Dole ' s remarks stood_in sharp contrast to those he made Sunday on NBC-TV ' s &quot; Meet the Press , &quot; in which he blamed French and British faintheartedness for the fiasco in Bosnia and for creating conditions &quot; where NATO has been tied_in knots &quot; and has &quot; almost become irrelevant. &quot; An angry response by British Defense_Secretary Malcolm Rifkind , who denounced Dole ' s comments as &quot; disgraceful , &quot; seemed to drag the transatlantic rift over Bosnia to dangerously new lows . Dole ' s trip here was planned in_advance of his controversial weekend remarks . He met privately with new alliance Secretary_General Willy Claes and with NATO ' s national representatives . Later in the day , he also saw Russia ' s former deputy foreign_minister , Vitaly S . Churkin , who is now ambassador in Brussels . Today , he is scheduled to meet British Prime_Minister John Major in London . U.S.-European tensions over Bosnia built quietly for several months on the issue of how much military_force should be used in the search for peace . The United States , which sees the Bosnian Serbs as the war ' s clear aggressors , has urged greater use of NATO air_power as a way to pressure them into a settlement . The Europeans , who supply the majority of the 24 # 000 U.N. peacekeepers in the country , have urged caution for fear that such tactics would put their troops at risk . The United States has no ground forces in the country . Differences between the allies came_to a boil in recent weeks as the international community watched the world ' s most powerful military alliance do virtually nothing to stop a ragtag army of Bosnian Serbs as it flouted U.N.-designated safe areas and prepared to capture the strategic city of Bihac . Although using softer language , Dole on Tuesday still stressed the need for military pressure against Serbian forces . &quot; If you listed on a blackboard all_of NATO ' s military_actions , it would n ' t be a very long list , &quot; he said . &quot; What we have had is irrelevant to the Bosnia conflict . We ' ve had pinpricks . We haven ' t had robust air strikes . &quot; Until there is some pressure , until there ' s some leverage ( against the Bosnian Serbs ) , it ' s going_to be very difficult to stop the fighting and reach some settlement , &quot; he said . &quot; We understand the problems some of our allies and friends have -- the_British and French and others who are directly on the ground -- but I don ' t see any resolution possible otherwise. &quot; THE BLAME GAME As the situation in the Bihac enclave of Bosnia-Herzegovina worsened steadily this week , leaders on both sides of the Atlantic and at the United Nations have let_fly with recriminations about the international community ' s powerlessness . Some samples : &quot; Now I think we have a complete breakdown of NATO ; we have the UN vetoing targets , driven by the_British and the_French -- I must say , primarily the_British . The United Nations protection forces are supposed to be there to protect the civilians , and they ' re not doing it. &quot; Senate Majority leader-designate Bob Dole ( R.-Kan. ) . &quot; I think when we have thousands of brave British soldiers , some of whom have lost their lives , in Bosnia ... it ill becomes people in countries who have not provided a single soldier on the ground to make that kind of criticism. &quot; British Defense Minister Malcolm Rifkind . &quot; The tragic events in Bihac show that any encouragement given to the reconquest of territory by force -- and notably the prospect of lifting the arms embargo -- is vain and dangerous . It only fuels the cycle of violence to the detriment of the search for a negotiated peace settlement. &quot; French President Francois Mitterrand and Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur . &quot; I told President Clinton in June that it is unwise to lift the embargo ( on arms to Bosnia ) at this time . It will not create peace there , it will just accelerate war . And this ( U.S. ) indication that the embargo might be lifted has just created that situation . The war started again. &quot; Canadian Prime_Minister Jean Chretien . &quot; I believe the U.N. is being made a scapegoat . It is absolutely unfair when member states do not want to take the risks , when they do not want to commit the resources , but blame the U.N. for failure to act. &quot; U.N. Undersecretary for Peace-keeping Kofi Annan .</TEXT>
