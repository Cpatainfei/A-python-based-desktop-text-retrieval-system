   <HEADLINE> A MODERN STONE-AGE VEGETABLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Proposed cartoon for our times : A fire burns in a circle of stones . A hefty , bearskin-clad caveman crouches over it , carefully roasting his dinner -- not a leg of deer , not a chunk of dinosaur , but a humongous carrot . These days , no chic restaurant worth its olive_oil would dream of being without grilled vegetables , and back-yard chefs across the nation have been following_suit . The only wonder is that it took us so_long . As shish-kebab lovers have always known , the browning reactions and smoke flavoring that make grilled meat so appealing have much the same effect on the vegetable kingdom , where they not only heighten the flavor of fresh things but also hide a multitude of out-of-season sins . Sweet fresh asparagus , for example , gets new depth from grilling , while elderly spears that have lost their savor borrow tastiness from the smoke . Deep grain-flavored corn in season is enhanced by the technique , which gives it an almost meaty taste . The over-sweet shippers ' corn in markets now is saved by fire , which tenderizes those tough kernals and turns the excess of sugar into a whole complex of caramelized appeal . TIPS FOR GRILLING VEGETABLES The two key_words are careful and covered . Vegetables lack the fat that keeps meat moist ; and the high heat that browns things so well can easily burn foods that are high in sugar , such_as onions and beets . It ' s a balancing act : too slow and the stuff dries_up , too fast and it burns . A good general rule_of_thumb is five minutes to eight minutes total per inch of thickness , in a covered grill . Coals should be at medium heat -- test with an onion slice , which should start to brown in about a minute and a half . Turn vegetables with tongs or a spatula to avoid juice-loss . TO OIL OR NOT TO OIL Olive_oil , with or without herbs and garlic , is almost always called_for in grilled vegetable recipes . It does add flavor and prevents sticking , but it can flare_up and give charred tastes . And many grilled vegetables -- onions and eggplant come at once to mind -- taste just as good without the added fat . Better to add it after grilling , except where absolutely necessary to prevent sticking . VEGETABLES TO PRE-COOK The variable heat of most back-yard grills forbids long cooking . For best results , steam , microwave or oven-roast the following before finishing on the grill : Carrots , beets ( leave the skin on , grill whole and then peel ) , potatoes ( either prepare as beets or grill oiled slices ) , artichokes ( peel_off all coarse outer leaves , halve or quarter , remove choke and trim thorns ) . VEGETABLES TO COOK DIRECTLY Asparagus -- Use thick spears ; the thin ones tend to dry_out and get_tough . Cabbage -- Remove tough outer leaves , cut_into 1 1 / 2-inch wedges , grill with the core in so they don ' t fall_apart and remove after they ' re cooked . Corn -- Remove tough outer husks . Peel back inner ones , remove silk and replace husks . Soak in cold water for 10 to 15 minutes before cooking . ( Don ' t water-log or the corn will steam instead of grill. ) Eggplant -- Leave peel on , cut crosswise into inch slabs . Taste peel before serving and remove , if bitter . Greens -- Heading greens such_as endive , radicchio and lettuce hearts all work well . Oil lightly to prevent desication of outer leaves . Onions -- Peel and cut_into 1 / 2-inch slabs . Peppers -- Leave standard waxed ones whole , char skins , then peel and seed . Wax-free peppers can be halved and seeded before grilling and enjoyed with the skins on . Summer_squash and zucchini -- Cut large ones into inch-thick circles or halve lengthwise . Leave small ones whole and keep turning_to ensure even cooking . Tomatoes -- They tend to fall_apart , but whole ones roasted over low heat until browned and semi-collapsed are delicious ground into sauce . * This salad is rich with assertive flavors , smokey and sweet , hot , sharp and citrusy all at once . And it ' s filling enough to be a main dish , especially on a hot day . Yet it ' s very low in fat , thanks to the buttermilk dressing . ( Yes , I know there ' s avocado , but only a little . . . . ) GRILLED CORN AND JICAMA SALAD WITH BUTTERMILK DRESSING 1 large tangerine , preferably Minneola 1 / 2 cup buttermilk 1 tablespoon lemon_juice , or more taste 1 tablespoon peanut_oil 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1 / 2 teaspoon salt , or more to taste Dash ground clove 6 ears corn 1 large sweet onion , such_as Vidalia or Maui , cut_into 1 / 2-inch slices 1 medium jicama , about 3 / 4 pound 2 jalapeno chiles , cut_into small dice 1 / 2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro , plus extra leaves for garnishing 3 cups shredded iceberg or other crisp head_lettuce 1 avocado , cut_into thin lengthwise slices Cut_off top 1 / 3 of tangerine . Squeeze_out top 1 / 3 of juice . There should be about 2 tablespoons . Set remaining tangerine aside . In small , nonreactive bowl , whisk tangerine juice with buttermilk , lemon_juice , peanut_oil , Worcestershire , salt and clove . Set dressing aside . Grill corn and onion slices . Cut kernels from cobs . There should be about 4 cups . Place into large , nonreactive bowl . Cut onion into thin slivers and add bowl . Slice jicama 1 / 4-inch thick , then peel slices . Cut_into 1 / 4-inch-wide matchsticks , then slice across to make 1 / 4-inch dice . Add jicama , jalapenos and chopped cilantro to corn mixture . Recombine dressing . Add_to vegetables and stir well . Taste and adjust salt and lemon . Peel and section reserved tangerine . Divide shredded lettuce among serving plates and top with corn_salad . Garnish with avocado slices , tangerine sections and cilantro leaves . Makes 4 main dish servings , or 6 side_dish servings .</TEXT>
