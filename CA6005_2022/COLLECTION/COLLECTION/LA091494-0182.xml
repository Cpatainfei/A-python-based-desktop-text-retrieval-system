   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; INFLATION REPORT PUSHES DOW UP 19.52 ; BOND YIELDS DROP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reassuring inflation statistics gave stocks a boost Tuesday , and the Dow Jones industrial average finished 19.52 points ahead at 3 # 879.86. The yield on the 30-year Treasury_bond slipped to 7.68 % from 7.71 % on Monday . The dollar was generally mixed , but the Canadian_dollar rose dramatically against all currencies after a weaker-than-expected showing by Quebec separatists in elections Monday . In the morning , the Dow gained more_than 30 points_after the government said consumer prices rose a moderate 0.3 % in August . Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about a 10-9 margin on the New York Stock_Exchange , with 1 # 142 up , 998 down and 729 unchanged . The consumer price report was a calming influence after a worrisome report last Friday on wholesale prices that caused a steep selloff in_stocks and bonds . The consumer_price_index is considered a broader_gauge of inflation because it covers services , which are not included in the wholesale price report . Rao Chalasani , chief strategist at Kemper Securities Group in Chicago , said the CPI numbers suggest inflation isn ' t translating readily from producer to consumer prices . However , he said investor caution is high because of upcoming statistics . The government reports retail sales and regional economic activity today , business inventories Thursday and industrial production Friday . Any of those numbers could reignite inflation fears . &quot; I don ' t think too many people are buying_into the optimism &quot; after the CPI report , said Guy Truicko , equity portfolio manager at Unity Management . &quot; Inflation is back and people are worried. &quot; The Dow sank almost 34 points Friday after the August producer_price_index rose 0.6 % , well above expectations . The blue_chip index lost another 14 points Monday . &quot; A little better market , a little more confidence , and the money returns to the former leaders , &quot; said Bill Allyn , director of listed equity trading at Jefferies &amp; Co . Meanwhile , gasoline on the New York Mercantile Exchange tumbled to its lowest price in five months , as refiners sold stocks that won ' t meet new environmental regulations . On Dec . 1 , gasoline destined for certain regions must have a higher oxygen content to meet the emissions standards in the federal Clean Air Act of 1990 . &quot; People are dumping gasoline in front of this new specification , &quot; said Michael Busby , manager of crude and refined products trading at Northville Industries Corp . in Melville , N.Y. Gasoline for October delivery tumbled 2.18 cents to settle at 44.94 cents a gallon , the lowest price since March 30 . The plunge pushed October crude down 27 cents to $ 17.12 a barrel , and heating_oil fell 0.95 cent to 48.12 cents a gallon . After the new regulations go_into effect , gasoline prices could shoot_up , Busby said , because refiners are having difficulty making the reformulated grades . Among Tuesday ' s market highlights : * Basic materials and technology stocks rose . The two groups had led the market ' s recent rally but had been hit by profit taking_in the past two sessions . Aluminum Co . of America rose 1 3 / 8 to 84 , International Paper gained 1 5 / 8 to 74 1 / 2 and Microsoft rose 1-7 / 16 to 57-9 / 16 . Georgia Pacific rose 1 1 / 4 to 73 . * Semiconductor stocks benefited from release of the latest book-to-bill ratio , a measure of new orders for semiconductors compared to existing shipments . August ' s 1.04 reading meant that for every $ 100 of products shipped , companies got $ 104 in new orders . Texas Instruments gained 1 to 75 1 / 8 , Intel finished_up 3 / 4 to 65 1 / 4 and Micron Technology gained 3 / 4 to 39 7 / 8 . IBM rose 1 3 / 8 to 69 1 / 4 after Merrill Lynch said IBM ' s new mainframe product launch represents a significant revenue opportunity . * CBS dropped 11 3 / 8 to 337 3 / 4 .

A Merrill Lynch analyst cut her earnings forecast on the company . * The Canadian_dollar advanced broadly after Quebec separatists won a key election by a slimmer-than-expected margin , easing near-term worries about the province ' s quest_for independence . In late New York trading , the U.S. dollar was worth 1.3488 Canadian_dollars -- the lowest level since early March -- down from 1.3680 on Monday . The vote also prompted a rally in Canadian bond prices . * Gold closed_in London at $ 389.25 an ounce , down from $ 390.80 on Monday . * Tokyo stocks ended higher as index-linked buying by investment_trusts , coupled with public fund buying in late afternoon , boosted prices in thin trading . The German 30-share DAX index closed the session lower as DAX futures prices slid and players awaited U.S. inflation data . The key indicator shed 18.52 points to end at 2 # 136.09. But in post-bourse trading after the U.S. data came_in better than expected , it rose 21 points to 2 # 157.15 .</TEXT>
