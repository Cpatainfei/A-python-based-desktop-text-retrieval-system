   <HEADLINE> MIKE PENNER : MILLER can ' t FIND BIRD OF PARADISE IN DOME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The last time he saw these fans , he flipped them the bird . Upon his return visit , for the first time as an ex-Atlanta Falcon , he flipped , in his own words , a &quot; couple wounded ducks. &quot; So , yes , if you ' re asking , Chris Miller has changed his approach to playing quarterback inside the Georgia Dome . Chuck Knox kept looking_at Miller float the ball_up there Sunday afternoon and kept thinking_back to the playbook he handed to the players in July . All the new guys did get a copy , right ? But there was Troy Drayton , down and out and open for the first time all season . . . and there goes the football , soaring over Drayton ' s head and into the arms of Falcon cornerback D.J. Johnson for an interception at the Atlanta four-yard line . And there was Flipper Anderson a_few minutes later , streaking into the end zone a step ahead of Johnson . . . and there goes the football again , its animation suspended in the air long enough for Johnson to leap in front of Anderson and pick it off again . By the time Knox could corner Miller on the sideline and remind him that throwing to the guys in the black shirts was advisable in 1993 but not such a good idea in 1994 , it was too late . Falcon defenders intercepted Miller ' s passes three times , combining for nine fewer catches than Andre Rison , and just like that , it was 31-13 , Atlanta , and a proud Ram winning streak had come_to an end . That wasn ' t me on those floaters , Miller told reporters , scanning the crowd for familiar faces . Surely , they could vouch for him . &quot; You ' ve seen me throw deep before , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t throw ducks . I throw good , tight spirals . &quot; But two balls today just got_away from me . The deep ball to Flipper and the ball that sailed on Troy . They looked_like they came_out of a ball machine . Punts . A couple wounded ducks . I don ' t throw the ball like that. &quot; Miller seemed to be trying to convince himself . He mentioned that he talked with June Jones , his old offensive coordinator and the Falcons ' new head coach , after the game and Jones told him , &quot; You still throw the best deep ball in the game. &quot; Miller said he shook Jones ' hand and replied , &quot; Thanks , I appreciate it. &quot; So what happened to those passes that fluttered and quivered and will never be confused , in any league , for the best deep ball in the game ? Moisture was the best response Miller could muster . &quot; The ball was wet , &quot; Miller claimed . &quot; It slipped out of my hands. &quot; Wet ? Inside the plastic carpeted , hermetically sealed , climate-controlled , always-69-degrees-and-bright Georgia Dome ? How does that happen ? &quot; You figure it out , &quot; Miller snapped as he spun on his heel and slipped into the shower . So that ' s it . The Falcons must store their footballs in the shower . This , however , fails to explain how the football dried itself in between punts , enabling Atlanta ' s quarterback , Jeff George , to complete 29 of 38 passes for three touchdowns and throw no interceptions . No , must be something else . Maybe the Falcon defensive linemen are sneaking oil cans onto the field in their hip_pads . Or maybe they spit on the ball just as Miller is winding_up . Miller returned from the shower_stalls . &quot; You figure it out yet ? &quot; Miller said to a writer . Sorry , still working_on it . A stab in the dark is taken . Perspiration , perhaps ? Miller smiled and continued to finish dressing . But , if it was perspiration , how did_it get there ? &quot; I don ' t want to get_into it , &quot; Miller said as he stood_up . Then , he lowered himself into a center ' s position and mimicked someone snapping the ball against a sweaty right calf . And he winked . There it is , then : The problem with the Ram offense Sunday was between Bern Brostek ' s legs . Drayton would have liked to have testified on Miller ' s behalf , but , as usual , he didn ' t touch the football . Drayton never does . He remains the most physically imposing and impressive decoy in the NFL -- to be seen , not targeted -- and the only football that came his way in Atlanta flew over his head like a 747 lifting off the runway . &quot; He just overthrew it , &quot; Drayton said . &quot; Nothing you can really do about that . Chris said it slipped_on him a little bit . Nothing you can do about it. &quot; Same thing the boos , which followed Miller everywhere he went . Falcon fans booed him before his first play and after his last , cursing him as he walked into the tunnel after the final gun . &quot; I ' ve heard worse , believe me , &quot; Miller said , shrugging . &quot; Fans are fans . They ' ve got the right . I ' m a visitor now . And I didn ' t please everybody while I was here . We had a couple good years , but things went downhill after that. &quot; On the bright_side , however , Miller noted that he escaped serious injury on the field that reached up and chomped on his knee twice during his five seasons with the Falcons . &quot; It is a relief to come_off that field healthy , &quot; he observed . The next time Miller returns , be sure to remind him : Bring a towel .</TEXT>
