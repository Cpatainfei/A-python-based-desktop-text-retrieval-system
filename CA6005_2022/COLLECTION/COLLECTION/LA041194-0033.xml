   <TEXT> It never occurred to me a decade ago when I was writing_about the roles parenting and sexual selection play in evolution that these theories would one day be adapted by a different group of researchers -- people interested in building machines that think . Nor did_it occur to me then that building such machines would be possible . I was living_in a world apart from men such_as MIT ' s Marvin Minsky , who were already devoting their careers to the idea that artificial_intelligence ( usually called AI ) was not only possible but desirable . That was the ' 80s . Since then , I have been inundated by a veritable tidal_wave of books , articles and TV specials describing computers that can not only direct industrial robots -- machines that repeat the same action -- but can , it is hoped , learn to adapt to new situations . Theoretically , such autonomous machines will be able to navigate the craters of distant moons and make independent decisions in ways analogous to human thought . In &quot; Brainmakers , &quot; Boston-based science writer David Freedman sums_up the facts and hopes surrounding what he sees as two generations of AI research . The first generation , he explains -- which was led by Minsky , among others -- got_off to a swift start , then lost momentum and ground to a halt when it became clear that abstract logical computer_programs could not approach the flexibility and speed of the human brain . Computers could play excellent chess , but they could not initiate projects . The first generation , Freedman says , struck_out . The next generation , what Freedman calls &quot; nature-based &quot; researchers , includes molecular biologists , neuroscientists and physicists , as well as computer_scientists . They base their efforts , in part , on the model of neural networks -- the way individual neurons fire multiple connections inside the brain . Freedman believes that they will succeed where their predecessors failed because they acknowledge complexity as the key to how nature works and use what they believe is natural ( an interpretation open_to debate ) as their model . Fleshing out these new approaches , Freedman describes the work of several varied research projects in New England , California and Japan . In lean prose , he provides vivid descriptions of the major players -- their biographies , their laboratories , their machines . Profiling scientists trying to build a microelectronic brain on the scale of quantum mechanics , Freedman explains : &quot; The main motivation for moving to the molecular scale is not merely to speed_up existing approaches , but to be able to create new approaches using the same building_blocks that nature does . . . biomolecules. &quot; Freedman introduces us to UCLA ' s Chuck Taylor , a biologist doing nature-based research on a larger scale . Taylor is using the tenets of Darwinian evolution to &quot; breed &quot; robots . His aim is to bridge the gap between what Freedman calls the idealized world of the computer and the hopelessly complex world of real-life animals . Taylor and his colleague David Jefferson , a computer_scientist , have started with a herd of 20 robots which , they hope , will grow to 100 in the next year after they follow the model of biological evolution , &quot; killing &quot; off those that perform poorly and mixing the best traits of the brightest . All of this leads to some pretty basic questions . How smart will these artificial brains become ? If they evolve as predicted , will they develop a sense of_their_own identity and mortality , as the late Isaac Asimov projected in his fiction ( and demand a code of ethics and perhaps civil_rights protection ) ? Freedman does not tackle this . But he does pose the question : Why build artificial brains at all , when we have so many good human brains around ? The practical reasons are obvious . Autonomous robots will be able to work where humans cannot -- in radioactive infernos or on distant moons . And in the laboratory , artificial brains can provide models for studying natural ones . But scientists seldom work with practical goals in mind . Freedman understands this and offers an explanation akin to what climbers say about Mt . Everest : They scale it because it is there . Brainmakers build artificial minds because they can . Where this will lead , they acknowledge , is unpredictable . that ' s what makes_it so exciting .</TEXT>
