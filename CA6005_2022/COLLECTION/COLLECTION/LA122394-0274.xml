   <HEADLINE> BOND FUND RULING ALLOWS EMERGENCY PAYMENTS ; COURTS : JUDGE SAYS $ 1 BILLION CAN BE TAKEN FROM TROUBLED INVESTMENT POOL BY ORANGE COUNTY AND OTHERS TO COVER PAYROLLS AND BILLS UNTIL JAN . 31 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John E . Ryan approved an interim plan Thursday that will give Orange County and more_than 180 cities and districts access to $ 1 billion to pay emergency bills and payrolls through Jan . 31 . The plan , which should help cities and other investors stave_off potentially disastrous shortfalls , limits each investor to 30 % of their individual investments in the county ' s troubled bond fund . It also puts an overall cap of $ 1 billion on the investors . Ryan called the plan fair . &quot; It is not based on fears about what might happen , it ' s based on hopes about trying to resolve this terrible situation. &quot; Attorneys for the county promised that the county will abide_by the same rules governing other investors when it makes its request for emergency funds over the next 30 days . Orange County bankruptcy attorney Bruce Bennett said the county will probably ask_for far less than $ 300 million . It was unknown how much other cash-strapped municipalities and government_agencies would demand . Few of the more_than 100 attorneys in court objected to the agreement , which also requires that emergency disbursement requests be reviewed by a creditors committee , a second committee representing pool investors and the county . Ryan said that municipalities could begin filling_out the two-page emergency withdrawal request forms Thursday afternoon , and that cash could begin flowing within days . He said he will be available next Thursday to rule on disputes . But that quick pace is barely fast enough for some cash-strapped cities . Montebello said it must withdraw $ 14 million , or 30 % of its investment , to make a partial payment on a debt that is_due next Friday . Unless the $ 14 million is paid , debt holders are unlikely to roll the debt over and &quot; if the city defaults , ( it ) faces the same problem that the county faces now , &quot; said Montebello ' s attorney , John Lapinski . But Lapinski said the new procedure at least gives the city a chance to make its payment . &quot; I ' m cautiously optimistic that things will work_out , &quot; he said . Bennett also made several important disclosures during the hearing for cities and districts that rely_upon the county to collect and disburse property_taxes . Some property_tax payments that Orange County collected before the county declared bankruptcy Dec . 6 were pumped into the troubled investment fund , he said . Bennett did not give a figure for the tax money now entangled in the complicated bankruptcy proceeding . But Bennett balanced that dose of bad news by saying that the county today will start disbursing to the cities property_taxes that were collected after the bankruptcy filing . Bennett did not say whether the county ' s fiscal woes would result in smaller checks being mailed . In an apparent split between the county and other investors that could widen , several attorneys raised questions about who should be forced to bear the brunt of the $ 2-billion loss suffered by the county ' s troubled bond fund . The arguments provided a glimpse into the complex legal question of what role the county played in the fund ' s losses . Attorneys for two community_colleges and a city objected to the plan because it did not limit more strictly the county ' s ability to make withdrawals . Huntington Beach City Atty . Gail Hutton argued that the county should not be able to withdraw any funds until it guarantees that all other investors will be reimbursed 100 % . Hutton said her &quot; fiscally responsible &quot; city should be given_back its entire $ 43-million bond pool investment because the county violated its role as a &quot; trustee &quot; by speculating with investors ' money . She said the county had no authority to impound the funds . If the county will not agree to the city ' s terms , Hutton threatened to take the_matter to Superior_Court . &quot; The monies in the pool fund are sacrosanct , &quot; Hutton told Ryan . &quot; We are not unmindful of the county ' s dire straits , but unless the county can guarantee it will protect our interests , the city cannot agree to the county ' s invasion of the city ' s money. &quot; County bankruptcy attorney Bennett stressed that the county has taken no stand on how the loss should be absorbed . He did suggest that pool participants attempt a negotiated solution . The other option : &quot; Build a courtroom with roughly 200 attorneys ' tables and take no money out of the pool for several years. &quot; Both the county and the Official Investment Pools Participants Committee , which represents investors , will meet over the next two weeks to come_up with a proposal about how to handle the remaining funds in the pool , said committee attorney Patrick Shea .
