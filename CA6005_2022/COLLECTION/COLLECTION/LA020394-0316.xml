   <HEADLINE> THE COST OF A CURE ; AIDS-RESEARCH INVESTING FALLS AS OPTIMISM DROPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Richard J . Trauger , chief scientist at Immune_Response Corp. , went_to the international AIDS conference in Berlin last June to deliver what he thought was good news : promising results from clinical trials of the company ' s anti-AIDS therapy . Speaking with scientists and investors , he described how the Carlsbad , Calif. , firm co-founded by Dr. Jonas Salk had achieved some success with a treatment that aims to boost the immune_system of people infected with the HIV virus . He was mystified when people seemed discouraged by what they heard . &quot; People had such overly optimistic expectations about our research , &quot; Trauger said , &quot; that when we presented our results , they couldn ' t help but be disappointed. &quot; Immune_Response is one of dozens of biotechnology companies -- many of them in California -- facing tough times in their drive to discover effective treatments for the disease . Several years ago , investors rushed to companies like Immune_Response in the hope that science would soon find a vaccine or cure for the fatal disease . But that optimism has waned as some promising avenues of research have hit dead-ends amid a growing realization that the battle to conquer AIDS will be a long one . Start-up biotechnology companies involved in AIDS research are having a hard_time raising capital . Many more established firms have formed joint_ventures with major pharmaceutical firms -- also heavily involved in AIDS research -- to help finance their research efforts . Some biotech executives warn that if the investment climate does not improve soon , some companies will be forced to cut_back or even abandon AIDS-related research . There are numerous reasons why investor interest in AIDS is softening , company officials and others say . After a decade of research , only a_few drugs have reached the market , and there is growing disenchantment about the effectiveness of once-promising treatments like AZT . Also , the biotechnology industry in_general has suffered as the hype about potential wonder_drugs has often exceeded the reality . Further , many say , the threat of federal health_care reform is throwing a wet_blanket over the ability of all biotech companies to raise private capital . The biotechnology industry has complained bitterly about aspects of President Clinton ' s reform plan that would give the government more leverage to control prices of &quot; breakthrough &quot; drugs . &quot; There is a great_deal of hesitancy to invest &quot; in AIDS research , says Martin Delaney , founding director of Project Inform , an AIDS treatment information and lobbying organization in San Francisco . &quot; The promise of quick profits is not as realistic as everyone once thought. &quot; Charles J . Cashion , Immune_Response ' s chief financial_officer , says bluntly : &quot; HIV treatment companies have fallen_out of favor. &quot; In response , many companies have stopped using AIDS as an investment-stalking horse and instead are emphasizing how their products can be used to treat cancer or other diseases . Immune_Response , for example , is also working_on treatments for liver_disease , hepatitis and rheumatoid_arthritis , among others . Frustration over the lack of progress in fighting AIDS prompted 15 pharmaceutical companies , led by giant Merck &amp; Co. , to announce last year that they would pool research in the field to help speed the drug-development process . The frustration grew more acute at the AIDS conference in Berlin last June . Just before the meeting , a research report based on studies in England , France and Ireland found that AZT , manufactured by Burroughs Wellcome Co. , did not necessarily prolong life when used prior to the onset of AIDS symptoms . &quot; The leading drugs are waning , and there is a lack of unanimity on the next round of promising drugs , &quot; said Dr. Brandon Fradd , senior biotechnology analyst at Montgomery Securities , a San Francisco investment_firm . Fradd and others say financiers have already poured millions into AIDS research companies and are reluctant to do more until they see the fruits of that investment . &quot; If you came_to me today and said ' I ' ve found a new way to go_after the AIDS virus , ' I ' d have a hard_time funding your company , &quot; said Richard Schneider , a general partner with Domain Associates , a biotech investment_firm in Costa Mesa . The companies most likely to be affected by the chill in the investment climate are start-up firms with a good idea but little money , experts say . &quot; If you are a bright company and have ideas , you would have a very difficult time , &quot; said one Washington consultant for biotechnology firms . Only three antiviral drugs -- AZT , DDI and DDC -- have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration . All are expensive and have toxic side_effects . Many other treatments that use different approaches for fighting the virus are in various stages of development . Seventy-four companies now have 103 AIDS medicines either in human clinical trials or awaiting FDA approval , according to the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn . Of that number , 11 medicines are in review at the FDA , and 23 are in the last stage of clinical trials , known as Phase III . The HIV therapy under joint development by Immune_Response and its partner , French drug maker Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. , is one of the furthest along of the potential vaccines . It involves a vaccine that is actually an AIDS virus whose outer , protective &quot; envelope &quot; has been stripped away with chemicals and whose inner core has been inactivated with radiation . The approach , originally proposed by polio vaccine inventor Salk , is designed to enhance a person ' s natural immune_system to help combat the infection without using drugs . Immune_Response ' s Cashion said his company -- whose stock hit a high of $ 62 in November , 1991 -- may_not have been able to afford the high cost of bringing its HIV treatment through clinical trials without the help of Rhone-Poulenc , a company with $ 4 billion in annual sales . It can cost up_to $ 200 million to get a drug through the federal approval process . Fradd , the Montgomery Securities analyst , said investor interest in AIDS-research companies will probably perk_up if a new treatment is approved by the FDA . The last big boost in the stock prices of AIDS-research companies came_in late 1991 , after basketball star Magic Johnson announced that he was infected with the HIV virus . Reacting to the News Immune_Response ' s stock fluctuated sharply since the company went public in May , 1990 , reflecting the general volatility among biotechnology stocks , particularly those of AIDS research firms . Monthly highs , except latest : May , 1990 : Immune_Response goes public Nov. , 1991 : Basketball star Magic Johnson announces he has virus believed to cause AIDS June , 1993 : Immune_Response reports on clinical trials of its HIV therapy at International AIDS Conference in Berlin Wednesday close : $ 13.375 , up 75 cents Source : Dow Jones ; Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
