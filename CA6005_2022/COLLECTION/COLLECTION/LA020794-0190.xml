   <HEADLINE> AS IRE FADES , PEROT GROUP IS A SPOTLIGHT IN SEARCH OF A FOCUS ; POLITICS : UNITED WE STAND PLANS TO ISSUE SCORE CARDS ON MIDTERM CANDIDATES . BUT WITH VOTER OPTIMISM ON THE RISE , THE TEXAS TYCOON MUST FIND A RALLYING POINT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Both political_parties are doing everything they can to see that you ' ll go_away , &quot; Ross Perot told leaders of United We Stand , America , Inc. as they gathered for their first national strategy session . &quot; But we are not going_to go_away . We ' re going to grow. &quot; But one central question remained unanswered when the meeting concluded Sunday : Can the organization Perot founded a year ago find a message strong and clear enough to stir voters in this fall ' s midterm election and fulfill the Texas billionaire ' s bright hopes for its future ? It is a formidable challenge . But Perot and his followers demonstrated in 1992 that they can exceed conventional political expectations when they found a place on the ballot for his presidential candidacy and helped him get 20 % of the vote . United We Stand officials hope to match that achievement this year by following a blueprint released Sunday after three days of workshops and pep talks for the group ' s 100 state chairmen and directors , two from each state . Banned from directly endorsing candidates for office because of its tax-exempt status , United We Stand will instead concentrate_on informing voters of the views of office-seekers on 11 issues : a proposed balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution , campaign-finance reform , health_care reform , the line-item veto , term limits , budget reform , congressional accountability , welfare reform , foreign lobbyists , government waste and education . But to have any real effect on voters , the organization must overcome a number of obstacles , including a noticeable improvement in the mood of the American public since Perot entered national politics in 1992 . Perot was able to exploit voter distress about the recession and frustration with the gridlock that froze the Democratic Congress and the Republican President . Now the economy is surging , and Capitol_Hill and the White_House are bustling with activity . &quot; Perot is good at stirring_up people about the failure of government to solve problems , &quot; Vanderbilt University political_scientist Erwin Hargrove said . &quot; But if the political_system seems to be working and at least to be trying to address problems , he doesn ' t have much to go on. &quot; Still another problem for United We Stand is Perot himself . While the tycoon is the group ' s chief asset , providing not only the resources of his bank_account but the celebrity of his name , the other side of the coin is that it still seems to be heavily influenced by Perot ' s personal inclinations and quirks . &quot; Mr. Perot is like the weather , &quot; said Russell Verney , a former Democratic Party state director who signed_on with Perot to help develop issues . &quot; It ' s not safe to predict what he is going_to do until after he does it. &quot; Some of the state leaders assembled here say that Perot ' s control of the organization is exaggerated . &quot; The reason it ' s misunderstood is that people get their information from the media , &quot; said Dan Miller , a Los Angeles real_estate operator who is United We Stand ' s state director for California . Fair or not , the organization seems to be stuck_with the public perception that Perot calls most of the shots . For that reason , its fortunes are heavily dependent_on public perceptions of Perot , whose image took a battering after his performance last fall_in a televised debate with Vice_President Al Gore over the merits of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . &quot; I think the NAFTA debate showed Perot ' s weakness on facts and the pettiness of his personality , &quot; said George Shipley , a Democratic political consultant from Texas . He predicted that Perot will drift into the Republican_Party , taking his followers with him , in an effort to win the 1996 GOP presidential nomination . Some analysts speculate that Perot might seize upon the health_care issue , as a substitute for NAFTA , to get juices flowing among the electorate . At the weekend meeting , Perot cited health_care as a high priority for United We Stand , derided Clinton ' s plan and warmly praised Rep . Jim Cooper ( D-Tenn. ) , author of an alternative to the White_House initiative . But Perot ' s inherent mistrust of any form of federal health_care reform would have to be overcome before he would get_behind any of the competing proposals now before Congress , including Cooper ' s plan . In addition , Cooper ' s bill has been endorsed by the Business Roundtable , just the sort of economic power group Perot often inveighs against . Another challenge for United We Stand , because it is limited to providing information about issues rather than nominating or endorsing candidates , is to find a niche for itself in a political_system dominated by partisan loyalties and personality preferences . The campaign battle_plan for United We Stand &quot; makes_it sound something like the League of Women Voters , &quot; said Micah L . Sifry , editor of the Perot Periodical , a quarterly newsletter devoted to news of Perot and his movement . &quot; If you are going_to have a League of Women Voters agenda , you may just wind_up with nothing more_than League of Women Voters clout. &quot; But United We Stand leaders say they can confound the skeptics by blazing a new trail . &quot; We will follow our own pattern , making_it as we go_along , &quot; said Connie Smith , a state director . Meanwhile , the group decided to keep the size of its membership to itself , reportedly because a majority believed that whatever figure was released would detract attention from more serious concerns . &quot; We feel this is the number we should focus_on , &quot; said Kentucky Chairwoman Debi Berberich as she pointed to a chart pegging the national_debt at $ 4 # 522 , 736 # 000 , 000 . &quot; United We Stand America will be present until that number is zero. &quot;</TEXT>
