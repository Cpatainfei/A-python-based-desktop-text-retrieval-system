   <HEADLINE> A QUESTION OF HONOR ; SURVIVORS OF A 1944 NAVAL TRAGEDY SAY THEY WERE WRONGED BY COURTS-MARTIAL -- AND RACISM OF THE ERA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The mutineers are all old_men now . Until recently , most of them have said little about their ordeal 50 years ago : the deadly explosion , the bigotry , and the time they spent in prison . But now , these survivors of the tragedy at Port Chicago -- the deadliest stateside disaster of World_War_II -- are part of a growing movement to repudiate the racism of the era and clear their names . &quot; What we were charged with was just phony , &quot; Los Angeles resident Freddie Meeks , 74 , one of 50 African American sailors convicted of mutiny , said bitterly . &quot; We did not even commit mutiny. &quot; Today is the 50th anniversary of the explosion at Port Chicago , the naval munitions base on Suisun Bay near Concord where black sailors in segregated units were assigned to load explosives onto ships around the clock . The blast killed 320 people -- including more_than 200 African American seamen -- and injured 390 . It was so powerful that it destroyed two ships , maimed sailors in their barracks and broke windows in the St . Francis Hotel 35 miles away in San Francisco . Afterward , 258 surviving African American seamen refused to resume loading munitions , seeking safer working conditions and leave to visit their families like white sailors had received . Fifty black seamen were convicted of mutiny and sentenced to prison_terms of up_to 15 years . The rest were court-martialed for disobeying orders and sentenced to short terms in the stockade . After the war , under pressure from NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall , the Navy reduced the sentences . Now , six Democratic members of Congress from California , contending that the convictions were tainted by prejudice , are calling_on President Clinton to clear the names of the convicted men . &quot; We should put this sorry chapter in racial relations behind us , and allow these remaining men to complete their lives knowing that they have the esteem and regard of their countrymen for their service during World_War_II , &quot; the elected officials said in a letter to the President last month . Among those signing the letter were Sens . Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ronald V . Dellums ( D-Oakland ) . House Natural_Resources Chairman George Miller ( D-Martinez ) , who is leading the drive to expunge the convictions from the seamen ' s records , said the 258 men were the victims of bigotry and were unjustly found guilty . &quot; The court-martials would never have occurred if not for the issue of race , &quot; Miller said . &quot; These men have lived with this scar on their record throughout their lives . They have been viewed_as having less than honorable service , which they clearly did not. &quot; Today , survivors of the disaster , Miller , Navy officials and the National_Park_Service will dedicate a memorial to the dead at Port Chicago , now a part of the Concord Naval Weapons Station . A new monument lists all_of those who died in alphabetical order -- black_and_white side_by_side as they never were in life . A rusty , bent piece of metal recovered from one ship is mounted nearby , not far from the chunks of concrete and wood pilings that remain from the blast . During World_War_II , the Port Chicago Naval Magazine was the biggest munitions depot on the West Coast . Crews of African American seamen , supervised by white officers , served as stevedores loading the explosives on ships bound for the Pacific Theater . The seamen never received training on how to handle munitions but were under heavy pressure to load the ships as quickly as possible . Munitions ranging from rifle rounds to 2 # 000-lb . shells were loaded by winch , slid_down ramps or rolled on dollies . Some officers bet_on which crew would load the fastest , and losing crews were punished with reduced liberty . * On the night of July 17 , 1944 , there were two explosions five seconds apart at the loading pier . The first was small . The second demolished two ships and the pier , killing everyone within 1 # 000 feet of the blast . Both ships , the Bryan and the 11 # 000-ton Quinault Victory , were thrown into the air and broken_into small pieces . Arms , legs , heads and other body_parts were strewn among the rubble . Many of the dead were never found . With more_than 4 # 600 tons of explosives packed into the Bryan , the blast was more_than a third as large as the explosion caused by the atomic_bomb dropped on Hiroshima a year later . The detonation measured 3.4 on the Richter scale and was felt as far away as Nevada . It caused heavy damage in the nearby town of Port Chicago and for miles around , prompting the filing of 10 # 000 claims by civilians . No one ever determined what caused the explosion , but some survivors believe the rush to load the ships contributed to the disaster . With the loading pier destroyed , the surviving seamen were assigned to clear the debris and collect the body_parts of their fellow seamen . While white officers and seamen were given leave to visit their families , the African American seamen were shipped to nearby Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo . At the time of the explosion , Seaman Percy Robinson was in his bunk . He suffered lacerations on his face and arm and was hospitalized for a week . Less than a month after the explosion , he was among a group of 258 men told they would resume loading munitions . &quot; I was upset because I wasn ' t allowed to come_home on_leave after I got wounded , &quot; said Robinson , now 70 and living_in Los Angeles . &quot; I was still bandaged at the time I was ordered to go_back to work . I knew other sailors on our base who got wounded and they went_home . None of the blacks who were wounded were allowed to go home. &quot; Robinson and the other 257 men all refused to load munitions . But after the admiral in_charge of the depot warned them they would be shot if they continued to refuse , he was among 208 seamen who agreed to go_back to work . Instead of loading ships , however , they were sent to the stockade and court-martialed for disobeying orders . Robinson was sentenced to three months in the stockade and served 71 days . * Afterward , he received an honorable discharge and went_on to become a senior staff research engineer at Hughes Aircraft , but he could never be rid_of the stain on his record . Until recently , he never mentioned it to his wife or children , but every time he applied for a security clearance he had to explain his conviction . &quot; It ' s always there , &quot; he said , &quot; but you learn to live with it. &quot; Seaman Meeks was_on liberty in San Francisco when the blast occurred . He heard on the radio that he was supposed to return to the base , but did not go_back immediately . On his return , he was put_in the brig and then assigned to guard the bodies . Weeks later , ordered to go_back to work and facing the admiral ' s threat , Meeks joined 49 others and refused to budge . &quot; We decided we would not go_back and load the ships under those conditions , &quot; recalled Meeks , who went_on to work for Los Angeles County and is now retired . &quot; They only had the blacks loading and unloading the ammunition . The whites didn ' t have to touch it . It would scare you to death the way we had to handle it. &quot; At their mutiny trial -- the Navy ' s largest ever -- the prosecutor argued that in time of war , the seamen ' s concern over unsafe conditions and fear of another explosion were not sufficient grounds for refusing to obey an order . After more_than a month of testimony , the Navy judges took 80 minutes to reach their verdict : All 50 were guilty of mutiny . The mutineers were sentenced to hard labor and imprisoned on Terminal Island in San Pedro . Thurgood Marshall , an NAACP attorney who was later appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court , spent weeks observing the trial and protested that the men were charged &quot; solely because of their race and color. &quot; &quot; I can ' t understand why whenever more_than one Negro disobeys an order it is mutiny , &quot; Marshall said . Eleanor Roosevelt joined with Marshall in urging the Navy to be more lenient . In 1946 , the Navy reduced the mutineers ' sentences and released them after they had served about 16 months in prison . Nearly all_the men were reassigned to other Navy duties and given a chance to redeem themselves . Most of the mutineers received a discharge &quot; under honorable conditions , &quot; which gave them some veterans benefits but fell_short_of the coveted honorable discharge . The Port Chicago case prompted the Navy to overhaul its procedures for handling ammunition -- and to begin ending segregation even before President Harry S . Truman ordered the military ' s integration in 1948 . Five years ago , a book by Robert Allen titled &quot; The Port Chicago Mutiny &quot; and a subsequent documentary by KRON-TV in San Francisco revived the memory of the mutiny and called into question the treatment the men received . * Under orders from Congress to review the case , the Navy issued a report this year concluding that racial discrimination played a part in the seamen ' s work assignments and living conditions . But the Navy found that racial prejudice did not affect the courts-martial , convictions or sentences . &quot; The ( review ) panel concluded that there was nothing unfair or unjust in the final outcome of any of the Port Chicago court-martials , &quot; the Navy said in a statement . Now , the effort to expunge the record of the mutineers has the backing of Port Chicago survivors who obeyed orders and went_back to work , such_as Morris Soublet , then a second-class bosun ' s mate who supervised loading of the ships . Most of the men had signed_up to fight the enemy and found themselves working as laborers without proper training and in unsafe conditions , he said . &quot; They weren ' t afraid of getting_on a ship and getting shot at , &quot; said Soublet , 73 , who lives_in Oakland . &quot; They just didn ' t want to handle ammunition. &quot;</TEXT>
