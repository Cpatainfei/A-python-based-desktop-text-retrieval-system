   <HEADLINE> CIGARETTE SMOKE CONTRIBUTES TO VISIBLE SMOG , SCIENTISTS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although car exhausts , fireplaces and smoky restaurant grills emit much of the visible smog that envelops Los Angeles , researchers have found that cigarette_smokers also leave a mark in the air . Tobacco smoke makes_up about 1 % of the area ' s visible pollution , a group of environmental scientists found . &quot; The smog in L.A. is a complicated mixture of chemical substances , &quot; Glen R . Cass of Caltech said Tuesday . &quot; What you hear about mostly are the daily ozone concentrations -- a transparent gas that ' s a respiratory irritant . What we ' re working on is a different part of the problem : the airborne particle complex -- solid particles and liquid droplets in the atmosphere. &quot; Cass said fine particles in the air create most of the visibility problem and are the &quot; most likely to get_in the bottom of your lungs , as opposed to large dirt particles that probably won ' t make_it past your nose. &quot; To look_for traces of cigarettes , Cass and a group of fellow scientists tracked two hydrocarbon compounds -- isoalkanes and anteisoalkanes -- found in the surface waxes of tobacco leaves . &quot; They were the best tracers because they were chemically stable in the atmosphere and , at_the_same_time , they could be distinguished in the atmospheric samples from other contributing sources , &quot; said Cass . He and his team have been analyzing Los Angeles pollution for a dozen years . The team calculated that cigarette smoke particles constituted 1 % to 1.3 % of the fine particles in Los Angeles ' atmosphere , as recorded by air monitoring stations in 1982 . Other comparable particle polluters included automobile brake_linings and tires as they wear_down and emissions from roofing tar pots .</TEXT>
