   <HEADLINE> TEENS AT RISK FOR STDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shari Roan ' s excellent Column One report ( Oct . 26 ) on the alarming growth of sexually transmitted diseases among adolescents sadly mirrors the findings of Planned Parenthood in working with teens . Last year in our clinics , we saw nearly 15 # 000 teens , some of whom made the decision to have_sex without condoms for such reasons as &quot; I ' m on the pill , &quot; or &quot; He worked for ( a local company ) , so he must be clean , &quot; or &quot; You can ' t get AIDS from a woman. &quot; In the classroom , we urged more_than 37 # 000 teens to act responsibly -- either postpone sexuality or heed the dangers of unprotected sex . Should we be surprised that our educational efforts aren ' t more successful ? Hardly , not when our message is competing with the media ' s far more exciting message that sex is OK . And not when so many adults , uncomfortable with their own sexuality , believe silence to be the best teacher . Open and honest discussion of sexuality in the home needs to be an essential part of family life , along with age-appropriate , reality-based comprehensive sexuality education curriculum in the schools . It is the responsibility of all_of us -- parents , educators , clergy and health_care professionals -- to provide young people with the facts and the nurturing they need to make wise decisions about their sexuality . SUELLEN B . WOOD Executive_Director Planned Parenthood , Los Angeles * Thank_you for your excellent piece on STDs among adolescents . At the Los Angeles Free Clinic Hollywood Center , where we see thousands of these young people every year , we know that the problem is serious . We also know that there are ways to treat adolescents and help them make more healthful and responsible choices . We provide free , non-judgmental care . It ' s hard to tell the staff from the clients , and young people feel safe discussing their problems with people who speak their language . We also know what questions to ask to determine whether a young_person is at risk for STDs . Sadly , most internists and pediatricians don ' t ask the right questions , and young people are either too ashamed or too ignorant to volunteer that they are at risk . We also know that we cannot wait for a young_person to come_to us . The ones at highest risk simply don ' t come_in_for help until they are already infected -- and have infected others . We send outreach teams of youth educators to places where young people are most at risk : the streets of Hollywood , homeless shelters and continuation schools , to educate and counsel them about HIV , STDs , substance_abuse , smoking and other health_problems . We work very closely with a network of youth agencies to provide comprehensive care to adolescents . We know that substance_abuse , domestic violence and homelessness all increase the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases , and you cannot treat the symptoms without addressing the complicating lifestyle factors . MARY L . RAINWATER Executive_Director SUSAN MANDEL MD Medical Director , Los Angeles Free Clinic * Re &quot; Hemet Schools Sued Over Sex Curriculum , &quot; Oct . 26 : Kudos to Hemet for adhering to state law mandating abstinence in sex education ! Interesting that Planned Parenthood ( the largest abortion provider in the world ) is a plaintiff ! MARY MARGARET CASSIDY Port Hueneme * Looking through The Times , I notice on the front page that teens are more at risk than ever from sexually transmitted diseases . Inside I see our civil_liberties organizations fighting to prevent the teaching of abstinence . Isn ' t something wrong here ? ALAN S . MAZER Pasadena</TEXT>
