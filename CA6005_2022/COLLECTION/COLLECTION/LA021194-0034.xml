   <HEADLINE> RELUCTANT NOVICE : STAMP OF CREATIVITY ; A CRAFTS CLASS OFFERS TIPS ON USE OF INK PADS AND HOW TO ' CARESS THE PAPER. ' NON-TRADITIONAL DESIGNS INSPIRE THE TEACHER ' S REMARK OF ' INTERESTING. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Some guys are born with the craft gene , some aren ' t . I got mine from my mother ' s side . So did my sister , who has done enough crafts to stock a chain of Moskatels from here to Kentucky . So when I heard of a stamping class held at Stamp Into Burbank , I felt my DNA whir at the prospect of getting my fingernails inked . I took along my friend Larry Nichols , an artist who makes jewelry . My stamping experience is limited to stamping &quot; Third Notice Past Due &quot; on invoices for magazines I write for . Larry once stamped his footprints on a birth_certificate . &quot; Ooooh ! A couple of stamp virgins ! &quot; Shop owner Lynne Lacy is eyeing Larry and me with the sort of look that tells us we ' ll be buying $ 287 worth of stamps before the night is over . Lacy seats us at a cramped table with six other virgins , and the stamping begins . First we make a border of leaf stamps around blank postcards . I look_around the room , imagining that the home down the street has given us passes to attend this craft class -- along with making us take our medicine , of course . Then Lacy bursts_out with a chipper , &quot; Clean rubber is happy rubber ! &quot; to explain how to clean our stamps . Fantasy quickly turns_into reality . Lacy explains that it ' s OK to &quot; beat your pad to death &quot; with the stamp to get_it really inked up . &quot; But you must caress the paper lovingly with the stamp , &quot; she says . &quot; Besides , what ' s the worst thing it ever did to you ? Give you a paper cut ? &quot; I look over at Larry , who ' s not caressing his paper . &quot; Caress your paper ! &quot; I hiss . Rubber_stamping , I later learn , has been around for about 100 years , back when Goodyear discovered a technique for stabilizing rubber . A quick check_in the phone_book reveals that there are six art stamping stores in the Valley . Lacy stocks a selection of 5 # 000 stamps and manufactures about 900 of_her_own designs at another location . The store carries seasonal stamps , including valentines , baby chicks , flags , turkeys , Santas and menorahs . Lacy also stocks the most popular designs -- paw prints and cat stamps . Stamping postcards and envelopes is quite popular , I ' m told . Stamps also are used on invitations , fabric , T-shirts , tote_bags , greeting cards , place cards , gift bags , place_mats -- the list is endless . Stamp Into Burbank even sells stamped birdhouses . Lacy tells me that stamps also can be made into 3-D cut-outs and worked into pop-up designs . She also gives stamp parties at people ' s homes , sort of a craft version of Tupperware gatherings . Back at the craft table , Larry has created a collage of black , gray and green valentines that belong in a David Lynch flick . &quot; Aaaah . that ' s interesting , &quot; says Lacy . &quot; that ' s really different. &quot; ( Read : Who let you out of the home ? ) I ' ve moved_on to making a collage out of raffia , cardboard and netting as the background for a multicolored stamp of Edvard Munch ' s &quot; The Scream. &quot; It ' s for a gift bag . To put the hundreds of valentines I ' ll no doubt receive . I think the women at the table think Larry and I are gathering material for the next &quot; Addams Family &quot; sequel . But I ' ve taken Lacy ' s advice of &quot; the less you plan it , the better &quot; to heart . She says people pay $ 8 to $ 10 for these kinds of gift bags in the stores . I grow frustrated because there is one glue gun among the eight of us and Larry is hogging it . But I ' m patient as I rub colored markers onto stamps to prepare other designs . It ' s OK if the ink dries because you can spritz it with water to bring it back to life . And the water can add a watercolor effect that looks arty . Then I lose my cool : &quot; Larry ! Give me the damn glue gun ! You ' ve been hogging it for the last 20 minutes ! &quot; Larry shoots me the kind of look that says he ' s ready to pound a huge cat stamp on my forehead ( I hate cats ) if I don ' t pipe_down . He finally hands it over . I forget why I needed it . We also learn how to make embossed stamps by rubbing a special embossing pigment onto a stamp and then cooking the stamped design with a dryer . The finished product is shiny and can be colored_in . Larry says mine looks a bit girlish . I tell him that sometimes the craft gene mutates at birth , creating a class of people that are despised simply because they are unable to hold glue guns properly . Such people , I add , often criticize the gifted . Where and When What : Stamp class . Location : Stamp Into Burbank , 3009 W . Magnolia Blvd. , Burbank . Hours : 6 p.m. Mondays . Price : $ 16 for one class . Call : ( 818 ) 845-8180 .</TEXT>
