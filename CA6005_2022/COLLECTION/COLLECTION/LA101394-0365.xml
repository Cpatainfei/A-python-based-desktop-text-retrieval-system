   <HEADLINE> DEPLOYMENT HAS BACKFIRED , IRAQ ENVOY SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Iraq ' s decision to deploy thousands of troops near its border with Kuwait backfired and has dealt &quot; a big -- but not insurmountable -- setback &quot; to Baghdad ' s effort to get_out from under the United Nations ' crushing economic embargo , Nizar Hamdoun , Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations , said Wednesday . Hamdoun said that President Saddam Hussein acted without informing his top foreign_policy adviser , Deputy Prime_Minister Tarik Aziz , who was in New York at the time trying to negotiate an end to the sanctions that have all but devastated Iraq ' s economy . Hamdoun ' s remarks represented an extraordinarily candid assessment for a senior Iraqi official , as Hussein is a ruthless dictator who has repeatedly stamped_out all dissent . But U.S. experts said that the U.N. ambassador ' s statements , made in an interview Wednesday , reflect increasingly visible tension between hard-liners in Baghdad , who apparently urged Hussein to move the troops south , and the Foreign Ministry , which has been trying to end the embargo through negotiations . Aziz and Hamdoun were at the U.N. ambassador ' s Manhattan apartment last Friday when they were shocked to see a report of the deployment on Cable News Network , Hamdoun said . The two had been working with Russian and French diplomats to try to shape an embargo proposal that would win U.N. support , and neither of them had any idea that the troops were_on the move , he said . Aziz was &quot; livid &quot; that the deployment had undermined their efforts at the United Nations , according to an American source who is in frequent contact with Iraqi officials . The next day Aziz left for Baghdad , stopping briefly in Amman , Jordan , to confer_with King Hussein . During the Persian_Gulf_War , the king sided with Baghdad , but in the current confrontation he has vowed to join in defending Kuwait . In Baghdad , Aziz told Hussein that the United States was mounting a massive military buildup and was serious about confronting any Iraqi threat . The Iraqi leader , apparently persuaded , ordered the troops withdrawn . State_Department officials refused to comment on Hamdoun ' s account . But a leading U.S. expert on Iraq , Phebe Marr of the National Defense University , said that increasingly visible disagreements have emerged between hard-liners in Baghdad and Foreign Ministry officials such_as Hamdoun and Aziz . &quot; There is clearly a split between doves and hawks , &quot; she said . &quot; The divide has been in the press in Baghdad for weeks. &quot; Although Hussein apparently remains in firm control , she said , &quot; there is more debate going_on , and more cracks in the regime than there used to be. &quot; Hamdoun and Aziz have been the most visible &quot; doves , &quot; working for the last year to get the U.N. sanctions lifted and , now that &quot; it has blown_up in their faces , it ' s understandable that they might be upset , &quot; Marr said . Most prominent among the &quot; hawks , &quot; she said , is Hussein ' s son Uday , who publishes Babel , a daily newspaper . &quot; Babel has attacked Tarik Aziz directly , &quot; she said . &quot; Uday is saying that the Foreign Ministry is wrong , that the negotiations can ' t work because the United States is not going_to lift the sanctions and that the only correct strategy for Iraq is to raise the costs to the West of maintaining the sanctions. &quot; Aziz , a veteran foreign_policy adviser , and Hamdoun , former Iraqi ambassador to the United States , both had extensive dealings with U.S. officials before Washington broke_off relations with Baghdad in 1990 as a result of Iraq ' s invasion of Kuwait and the war . Hamdoun , in an interview over lunch at a New York restaurant near his office , said Hussein ' s deployment of the troops was designed to get the attention of the U.N. Security_Council , which has been monitoring Iraq ' s progress in meeting U.N. disarmament demands . Iraq , he insisted , is in full compliance with U.N. disarmament demands dealing with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons . And until the deployment of the troops , he said , Russian and French diplomats had reacted positively to Iraq ' s efforts . But he pointed_out that U.S. and British officials had adamantly opposed lifting the sanctions . The United States and Britain maintain that Iraq has not fulfilled several of the conditions for lifting the embargo , including recognition of Kuwait ' s sovereignty and resolution of a dispute over the border . France and Russia acknowledge that , but argue that some relaxation of the embargo would encourage Hussein to meet the rest of the U.N. terms . They also argue that the suffering of Iraqi citizens , unable to affect their regime , is too great . Hamdoun indicated that Iraq was also prepared to deal with the issues of Kuwait ' s border and its sovereignty rights and that he had received information that the Kuwaitis were interested in negotiating but that Washington had rejected the idea . At one point as Hamdoun spoke , his cellular_telephone rang . The Iraqi foreign_minister , Mohammed Said Sahaf , was calling . After a brief conversation , Hamdoun put_down the phone . He looked relieved . &quot; He said all_the Iraqi troops have been withdrawn from the area near Kuwait , &quot; Hamdoun said . &quot; The Russian and Chinese military_attaches are in the area seeing the troops removed and will report back to their governments. &quot; Hamdoun indicated that , with the massive U.S. military buildup , Baghdad is bracing for a punitive strike even though the Iraqi troops have withdrawn . He said his course will be to &quot; just continue working with the_French and Russians to try to get the sanctions lifted. &quot; Hamdoun served as Iraq ' s ambassador to Washington from 1983 to 1987 , which he called the heyday of the two countries ' relations . At that time , Washington was backing Iraq in its war with Iran . Returning to Iraq , he served as deputy foreign_minister until 1992 when he was named Iraq ' s ambassador to the United Nations . He now lives_in New York with his wife and two daughters , 11 and 10 years old , both born in Washington . Hamdoun expressed frustration over the fact that American officials refuse to deal with Iraqi officials even at the United Nations . He said that Aziz had called_on U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright , but she had refused to see him . Nelson reported from New York and McManus from Washington .</TEXT>
