   <HEADLINE> CRITIC ' S PICK : ' THE WAR ROOM '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With his impish grin and the personality of a sardonic Ichabod Crane , James Carville ( pictured ) , Bill_Clinton ' s preeminent campaign strategist , is a natural actor . And this 1993 D.A. Pennebaker-Chris Hegedus documentary gives him the starring role he thoroughly deserved.Carville shares screen time with George Stephanopoulos , Clinton ' s director of communications at the time . As the Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside of the Arkansas governor ' s presidential campaign , they light_up Clinton ' s drive to the White_House and turn this film into a tiptop political documentary . The film is most notable for offering a candid and entertaining backstage look_at a most unlikely electoral juggernaut ( Disney Channel , Sunday at 9 p.m. , Monday at 3:30 a.m. , Saturday at 11 p.m. ) .
