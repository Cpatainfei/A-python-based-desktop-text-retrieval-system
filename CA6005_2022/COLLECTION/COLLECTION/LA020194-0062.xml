   <HEADLINE> CHANCES OF A WET YEAR EVAPORATING ; WEATHER : THE PATTERN OF DRY WINDS AND LITTLE RAINFALL CONTINUES , RAISING FEARS OF ANOTHER LONG ARID SPELL . BUT RESERVOIRS ARE STILL IN GOOD_SHAPE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As dry winds swept across Ventura County on Monday , hydrologists marked the end of another month with below-average rainfall , raising fears that the county and state may be entering another dry year . Rainfall totals countywide are only 36 % of normal for this point in the rainy_season , and no rain is_on the horizon at least through Sunday , meteorologists say . The statewide snowpack , which helps determine how much water can be shipped to Southern California , measured only 45 % of normal , the state hydrologist said . In addition , the National Weather Service ' s long-range forecast through April calls_for a 51 % chance that rainfall will be below normal . But the picture is not all gloomy , officials said . Reservoirs throughout the county and state are still in good_shape from the previous two years , when rainfall was 125 % and 180 % of normal , respectively . Ground-water basins are still relatively full as well , said John Weikel , senior engineer in the county ' s Flood_Control Department . &quot; But if this dry weather persists for any amount_of_time , we ' ll be back into water_conservation measures , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re still hopeful of getting some significant rain in February and March , &quot; he said , noting that the rain year that began in October has three months to go . &quot; Back in 1991 , we had even less rainfall at this time_of_year and February and March brought us back to normal. &quot; Statewide , the rainfall picture is similar to that in Ventura County , said Maurice Roos , the state hydrologist . Roos said the best months for snow are December , January and February , followed by November and March . And with two of the three most productive months already past , Roos said the outlook is for a drier-than-normal year . &quot; It was drier in 1991 than it is this year , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s not as bad as the worst , but it would sure be nice if it were better. &quot; * Reservoirs throughout the State Water_Project ' s network are still in good_shape with the carry-over from last year , Roos said . Overall , the reservoirs are at 95 % of their normal levels . Meanwhile , Ventura County is stuck_in a pattern of no rainfall and dry winds . Although the winds that gusted up_to 40 m.p.h. in Camarillo on Monday caused no notable damage in the county , they are a headache to farmers , said Rex Laird , executive_director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau . The dry winds batter tree fruit and lower the price they bring_on the market . And the lack of rain is forcing farmers to irrigate during a period when they can usually count_on rain . &quot; If it ' s not raining , they ' re having to turn_on their pumps , and that costs them money , &quot; Laird said . And irrigation is a poor substitute for a good , drenching rain , which washes the leaves and forces salts in the soil below the root zones of the trees . * But Laird hasn ' t heard many complaints . &quot; Farmers have so many adversities that they are just kind of used_to this , &quot; he said . &quot; It comes_with the territory. &quot; And for the time being , at least , there is plenty of water to pump . Ground-water basins are in excellent condition , said Frank Royer , assistant general_manager of the United Water_Conservation District . Lake Piru is about half-full , after the district released its water_down Piru Creek and into the Santa Clara River to help replenish ground-water basins . That also makes room for runoff this year , Royer said . In the past two years , United has diverted 225 # 000 acre-feet of water from the river into underground basins . &quot; We ' re in as good a shape as we were at the beginning of the drought last time around , &quot; Royer said , referring to the six-year drought that ended in 1991 . The dry winter thus far has not affected Lake Casitas , the county ' s largest reservoir , said John Johnson , manager of the Casitas Municipal Water District . The lake is only down about 12 # 000 acre-feet from its capacity of 254 # 000 acre-feet , which it reached during last year ' s storms . &quot; We work_on a 20-year cycle , so we ' re in good_shape for a long_time , &quot; Johnson said . &quot; At the end of the 1986-1991 drought , we still had half a lake . So a dry spell that lasts for one year is relatively insignificant. &quot; * The reservoir levels in the State Water_Project bode well for a good supply this year for Southern California users like the Calleguas Municipal Water District , said Donald Kendall , district general_manager . The district , which supplies Simi Valley , Moorpark , Thousand Oaks , Camarillo and Oxnard with all or some of their water , is now buying water to inject into the ground for storage , where it can be pumped out during dry months . &quot; The whole idea is that the water gets you through the dry years without having to ration , &quot; Kendall said . &quot; You take_advantage of the water when it ' s available. &quot; Rainfall Comparison A look_at monthly rainfall for 1993-94 compared to normal levels ( averaged over 35 years ) : 03 # 07 , 08 # 08 ' 93-94 Normal Oct . . 21 . 30 Nov . . 74 2.08 Dec . 1.56 2.33 Jan . . 41 3.78 Feb .
