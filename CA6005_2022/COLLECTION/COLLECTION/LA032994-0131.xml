   <HEADLINE> HEALTH WATCH ; A BLOOD_BANK WITH ONLY ONE ACCOUNT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Want to donate blood . . . to yourself ? Studies indicate that an estimated 10 % of patients scheduled for elective surgery show_up several weeks before surgery and give blood that is then earmarked for them . Two or more units of autologous -- your own -- blood can be donated in many cases . The trend toward self-donation is driven by several forces , primarily safety -- despite the fact that the American blood supply has never been safer because of careful screening that can detect infectious agents , most notably the viruses for hepatitis and AIDS . While AIDS gets the most publicity , the risk of hepatitis is higher . But that danger has been reduced by routine testing for the most widespread hepatitis viruses . Autologous blood also eliminates the small risk that a patient may have a damaging reaction to blood from a different donor . And autologous blood reduces the overall demand in the community blood supply . One study showed that only 13 % of surgery patients who donated blood in_advance required blood from other donors , compared to 74 % of patients who did not . And what if you don ' t need all your blood during surgery ? Well , you ' ll end_up doing a good deed -- the blood will be donated to others . * Nothing to Sneeze At : Birds are tweeting , flowers are blooming and you are blowing your nose , rubbing those eyes , sneezing big_time and wishing you were anywhere but in Allergyville .
