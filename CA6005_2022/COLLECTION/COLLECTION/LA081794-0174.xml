   <HEADLINE> FORECASTING ; WEATHER SERVICE RETOOLS , SETS ITS SIGHTS ON GREATER ACCURACY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Television weatherman Bob Ryan has heard all_the jokes . He ' s heard all_the whining about off-the-mark predictions and unreliability . &quot; If we get 90 out of 100 , we missed 10 . If we get 99 out of 100 , we missed one , &quot; says Ryan , a meteorologist at local NBC affiliate WRC-TV . But weather_forecasters and the National Weather Service , which provides them with information to develop forecasts , may_not be the butt of jokes for much longer . The NWS is updating its measurement equipment with a cutting-edge radar , supercomputer and satellite as part of a $ 4.2-billion modernization -- a move the agency , which has come under_fire for failing to give early warnings of tornadoes and hurricanes in addition to botching everyday predictions , acknowledges is long overdue . Using the high-tech system , parts of which are already operating in Los Angeles and many other major cities , forecasters will be able to see everything from clear skies to summer squalls more quickly and more clearly , weather officials say . NWS forecasts are the basis for newspaper weather_maps and television weather reports . In the United States , weather can be a dangerous business . In a typical year , the mainland sees 10 # 000 violent thunderstorms , some 1 # 000 tornadoes and several hurricanes . And the United States experiences more severe flooding than any other nation , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which oversees the NWS . In meteorology , accuracy is everything , weather-watchers say . And every little bit helps . With the new NEXRAD Doppler radar , forecasters will be able to peer inside storms for the first time and examine wind rotation , which can indicate when maelstroms or tornadoes are in their early stages . NWS storm experts expect that the system will give them about 30 minutes extra notice of approaching tornadoes . In cold climates , the Doppler system allows forecasters to measure snowfall intensity , something conventional radar cannot do , and issue warnings &quot; with more confidence , &quot; said Bob Thompson , an NWS meteorologist in Taunton , Mass . The weather service also bought an advanced supercomputer , the $ 45-million Cray Research Inc. C90 mainframe , which can process 15 billion math operations per second . The computer will use mathematical formulas to copy the movement of the atmosphere . Using those formulas as models , forecasters try to determine what weather systems will do next . The computer also provides information for more precise areas , analyzing conditions in zones of just 25 square_miles -- or one-fourth the size of the former system . Jack Williams , who has compiled data for USA Today ' s weather page since the newspaper started publishing 12 years ago , said he is &quot; looking_forward to the Cray , which can run more localized computer models. &quot; With the power to process six times as much data as the old system in one-fifth the time , the mainframe will &quot; help Americans in all walks_of_life make better daily decisions where weather is concerned , &quot; said Elbert W . Friday Jr. , assistant administrator for weather services for the NOAA . The supercomputer will oversee data processing from radar , satellites and a new automated measurement system . In May , the NWS launched its own weather_satellite , GOES-1 , giving U.S. forecasters more_than one working satellite in space for the first time since 1986 . For the last eight years , NWS meteorologists have had to borrow the services of a European satellite . The NWS is also installing automated weather-measuring stations across the country . Each station will collect data ranging from wind speeds to barometric_pressure and send it to one of the service ' s weather_forecasting offices situated in each state . Weather officials say the new system will be more accurate than human data collectors , although the NWS union is protesting because several field offices are being relocated .</TEXT>
