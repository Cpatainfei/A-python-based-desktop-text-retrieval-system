   <TEXT> The Air Quality Management District appreciates your article , &quot; Area ' s Smog Year Almost as Clean as Record 1993 &quot; ( Nov . 1 ) , showing that our region ' s air quality programs are paying_off in healthier air for all to breathe . Glendora has demonstrated leadership in showing how local_governments can contribute to the clean air effort by funding a number of creative programs to reduce emissions and promote air quality . As part of this commitment , Glendora voluntarily hosts the AQMD monitoring station serving the cities of the East San Gabriel Valley . Thus , we at AQMD believe it is a disservice to Glendora to single it out as &quot; the nation ' s smog capital. &quot; Readings at this monitoring station are representative of air quality levels in an area that includes the cities of Arcadia , Azusa , Baldwin Park , Bradbury , Covina , El Monte , Monrovia , San Dimas , Sierra Madre and Temple City . Air quality levels in Glendora and the surrounding area are showing dramatic improvement . The only way we at AQMD can continue to document this progress is through the continued hospitality of cities like Glendora . Glendora should be commended for this contribution to clean air .
