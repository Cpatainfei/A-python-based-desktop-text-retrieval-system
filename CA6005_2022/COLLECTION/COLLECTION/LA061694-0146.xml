   <HEADLINE> GRAY_WHALE REMOVED FROM ENDANGERED LIST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With its population approaching historic high levels , the California gray_whale , the beast of prey that became a majestic icon of the deep , was removed Wednesday from the endangered species list , making_it the first marine creature to be delisted . Estimated at 21 # 000 , gray_whales may be as numerous today as they were before an American whaling ship discovered their breeding_grounds off the Baja California peninsula in 1855 and began the commercial slaughter that decimated the species . Commercial whaling wiped_out two other gray_whale populations in the Atlantic during Colonial times , and later in the western Pacific . Although the gray_whales will remain under the jurisdiction of the Marine Mammal Protection Act , which shields them from hunting in U.S. waters , several environmental groups warn that the whales will be more vulnerable to a variety of hazards -- such_as oil drilling , sea mining , salt extraction and tourism -- than they were as an officially endangered species . Environmentalists say such commercial_activities will no longer require the stringent reviews mandated by the endangered species list . &quot; Delisting from the Endangered Species Act removes a protection that has been vital to recovery , &quot; said Maxine McCloskey of the Sierra Club . &quot; It will leave them more vulnerable to pollution and other environmental hazards. &quot; Right now , the environmental pressures appear greatest in Mexico , where ambitious plans for seaside resort development as well as salt mining could disturb the tranquillity of the bays and lagoons that have been safe_harbors for newborn whales for hundreds of years . Although Endangered Species Act jurisdiction does not extend_to foreign waters , critics of delisting argue that it will make_it harder for Mexican environmentalists to resist pressure for intense development along the Baja coast . The gray_whale ' s recovery is attributed to a variety of factors , beginning in the 1930s with a series of international whaling bans . However , exemptions continued to permit subsistence hunting of nearly 170 whales each year by native peoples in Alaska and Siberia . In the early 1970s , the National Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act established procedures for safeguarding the whale ' s long migration corridor and feeding grounds . Around the same time , the Mexican government gave sanctuary status to the Baja lagoons where the whales migrate in winter . In the 1980s , concerns about oil spills along the whales ' migratory route contributed to the decision to place a moratorium on oil and gas leasing off the California coast . For the past two decades , at least , the gray_whales have been multiplying at a rate of about 3 % a year , more_than doubling their population since the 1930s , according to the National Marine Fisheries Service , the agency responsible_for taking the whale off the endangered species list . Thirty-five to 50 feet long , the gray is by no means the largest whale , but it is unique in ways that have endeared it to humans . Unlike other whales that mate and give_birth in the solitude of the deep ocean , the sociable gray_whales clump together in shallow lagoons to breed and calve . They tend to be bottom feeders whose diet of crustaceans brings them close to shore , and their epic , 1 # 300-mile migration from Alaska to Baja California has made them the most visible of whales . Ultimately , their proximity to their old nemesis , the human_being , has helped save them , as generations of Pacific Coast residents and visitors have come_to know the rambunctious gray_whales , and commercial whale-watching has become a bread-and-butter industry to towns up and down the Pacific Coast . The gray_whale is the 22nd species to be delisted since the Endangered Species Act was enacted in 1973 . The last big animal to come_off the list was the American_alligator in the late 1980s . The 892 plants and animals that remain listed as either endangered or threatened include 13 marine mammals , seven of which are whale species . Still under the jurisdiction of the Marine Mammal Recovery Act , the gray_whales will be monitored under a five-year plan , according to David Hollingshead , a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service . Hollingshead said the monitoring will involve watching for any changes in the whales ' migratory habits as well as measuring the level of water-borne contaminants , including pesticides and hydrocarbons , that have been known to harm smaller marine mammals . David Phillips , executive_director of Earth Island Institute , a San Francisco-based environmental group opposed to delisting the gray_whale , contends that the action was prompted , in part , by mounting pressure in Congress to show that the Endangered Species Act is not &quot; a one-way_street &quot; that never acknowledges that a species has regained its health . Although Phillips acknowledges that the whales have made a substantial recovery , he said that without the Endangered Species Act it will be harder to regulate any number of activities , ranging from the explosions used in seismic exploration to the sea bed disruption caused by oil drilling operations . &quot; Before oil_companies were allowed to drill , they had to do extensive environmental impact reviews , &quot; Phillips said . &quot; The degree of protection won ' t be required under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. &quot; Phillips also contends that delisting will send a signal to the International Whaling Commission that a limited resumption of whale hunting by interested nations such_as Norway and Japan will not hurt the species . &quot; It means that there would be a greater chance for open season on gray_whales outside of U.S. waters , &quot; he said . And the critics also worry that delisting could send the wrong message to foreign governments regarding coastal economic development that could harm whale habitats . Much of that concern is now focused_on the west coast of Baja . &quot; Two of the three critical lagoons are under enormous pressure for development , &quot; said Bruce Mate , a professor of fishing and wildlife at Oregon State University and a member of the federal Marine Mammal Commission . &quot; At San Ignacio Lagoon there are plans for a saltworks 2 1 / 2 times larger than the world ' s largest facility , &quot; Mate said . It would mean the creation of a town of 5 # 000 to 10 # 000 people and the combined pressures of sewage and recreational fishing as well as barge traffic . Meanwhile , on Magdalena Bay , he said , Japanese developers have planned eight &quot; Club Med-sized resorts with all_the marinas , para-sailing , motor boats and jet skis that go_with those sorts of places. &quot; &quot; The Mexicans have been world leaders in whale conservation , &quot; said Mate , &quot; but they are under tremendous pressure to approve a totally inappropriate level of economic development. &quot;</TEXT>
