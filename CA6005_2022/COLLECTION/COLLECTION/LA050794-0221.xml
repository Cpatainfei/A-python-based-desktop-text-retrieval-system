   <TEXT> Ferdinando ( Nando ) Scarfiotti , the production designer who won an Academy Award for art direction of the epic 1987 film &quot; The Last Emperor , &quot; has died . He was 53 . Scarfiotti died April 30 in Los Angeles after a brief illness , spokesman Henry Penner said . The Italian designer was responsible_for the look of such stylish films as &quot; Last Tango in Paris , &quot; &quot; Scarface , &quot; &quot; The Sheltering Sky &quot; and 1992 ' s &quot; Toys , &quot; for which he was also nominated for an Oscar . &quot; Scarfiotti was the most influential film designer of the last three decades , &quot; said director Paul Schrader , who worked with him on &quot; American Gigolo &quot; and other films . &quot; His work has influenced an entire generation of directors and designers. &quot; Legendary producer David O . Selznick coined the hazy term &quot; production designer &quot; in the 1930s to describe the tasks of William Cameron Menzies on &quot; Gone With the Wind. &quot; The job is both conceptual and practical , involving coordination of art draftsmen , set designers and decorators to make color , light , locations and props reinforce a script . &quot; I thought ( Scarfiotti ) was one of the best production designers that ever was , &quot; said director Barry Levinson , who had worked with Scarfiotti on &quot; Toys. &quot; Although he won his Oscar for &quot; The Last Emperor , &quot; a period_piece filmed in Beijing ' s historic Forbidden City , Scarfiotti championed work_on modern settings . &quot; The past is there to be studied and seen , &quot; he told The Times in 1990 , &quot; but the present is a changing reality . The challenge is to make a statement and look_at it with a fresh eye. &quot; Scarfiotti ' s most recent work was_on the not-yet-released film &quot; Love_Affair , &quot; starring Warren Beatty and his wife , Annette Bening . Born near Rome , Scarfiotti studied architecture at the University of Rome . Encouraged by Italian director and family friend Luchino Visconti , he combined his interests in theater and architecture to become a production designer . He worked with Visconti on several operas , including &quot; La Traviata &quot; in Spoleto , Italy , and &quot; Der Rosenkavalier &quot; at London ' s Covent Garden , and on the film &quot; Death in Venice. &quot; The film won him Britain ' s equivalent of an Academy Award . In 1969 , Scarfiotti began working with director Bernardo Bertolucci on such films as &quot; The Conformist , &quot; &quot; Last Tango in Paris &quot; and ultimately &quot; The Last Emperor , &quot; which won nine Academy Awards . The tall and elegant Scarfiotti , known for his wit and personal style , also put his visual stamp on films for Billy Wilder , Peter Bogdanovich , Brian De Palma and Michael Apted . Scarfiotti is survived by his mother , Luisa of Rome ; his longtime companion , Nicolas Valle ; a brother , Emanuele ; a sister , Giovanna DeVergottini , and a niece and nephew . The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Jeffrey Goodman Special Care Clinic .</TEXT>
