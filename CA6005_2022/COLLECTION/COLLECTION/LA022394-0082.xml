   <HEADLINE> SIMI PROPOSAL TO TEACH BIRTH_CONTROL DEBATED ; EDUCATION : OPPONENTS SAY ABSTINENCE ALONE MUST BE TAUGHT . SUPPORTERS ARGUE THAT STUDENTS NEED COMPLETE INFORMATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dozens of Simi Valley parents , students and residents took_part in an emotional and sometimes heated debate Tuesday over whether to allow schools to teach birth_control methods to seventh- and 10th-graders . More_than 70 opponents and supporters of the proposed sex education program testified before the board of the Simi Valley Unified School District , which was scheduled to decide the issue late Tuesday . The debate over whether to include birth_control information in student course work has been at the center of increasing controversy ever since school_board member Debbie Sandland first proposed the idea in the spring . Opponents said abstinence alone should be taught as the only sure way to protect against pregnancy and disease . &quot; You ' ve got_to start thinking_of the root , not the symptoms , &quot; said Ginny Murray , one of several dozen parents who have spoken out at board_meetings since last year . Supporters of the plan to add birth_control information to the sex education curriculum argued that students need to be given complete information to make_good choices based on_their_own values . Programs that stress only abstinence promote &quot; fear and shame of premarital sex because , bottom_line , sex before marriage is viewed_as immoral , period , &quot; said Paige Moser , a coordinator for the Simi Valley chapter of the National Organization for Women . Before Tuesday ' s board_meeting , about a dozen students held a candlelight vigil outside City_Hall to honor those who have died from AIDS and to show their support for the proposed curriculum . &quot; The wisest person on the Earth couldn ' t make a wise decision without all_the facts , &quot; Katie Hall , a sophomore at Royal High_School who participated in the demonstration , said later in her testimony before the school_board . However , Father John Love , a priest at St . Rose of Lima Church , said educators should not assume that students will become sexually active . Instead , he said abstinence should be raised as the ideal for students to seek . &quot; Is abstinence possible ? &quot; Love said . &quot; I ' m 31 years old . I ' m celibate . I ' ve lived a celibate life all my life and I have not exploded. &quot; The ideological clash over the district ' s sex education curriculum first began when the idea was proposed in April by Sandland . After the board had conducted a routine review of the curriculum , the first-term board_member said she found the lack of birth_control information disturbing . A 25-member committee was convened to discuss when and what kind of information students should receive about birth_control . However , the diverse committee was not charged with deciding whether to add the information to the courses . In December , the committee unanimously recommended introducing basic birth_control information to the seventh-grade sex education class and expanding the discussion for high_school sophomores . The committee also recommended delving more into how students can develop skills for staying abstinent , such_as learning how to resist peer pressure and boost self-esteem .</TEXT>
