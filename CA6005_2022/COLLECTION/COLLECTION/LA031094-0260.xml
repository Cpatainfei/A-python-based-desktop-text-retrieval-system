   <HEADLINE> NISSAN , FTC SETTLE CASE INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS OF FALSE ADVERTISING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nissan Motor Corp . U.S.A. agreed Wednesday to settle false-advertising charges involving a 1990 promotional campaign . The Federal Trade Commission said Nissan had promised $ 100 , &quot; no catch , &quot; to consumers who bought a Toyota or Honda after test-driving a Nissan Stanza.The FTC said the ads falsely implied consumers could readily receive the payment . The FTC said the offer involved significant restrictions , requiring consumers to buy the new car , take delivery of it and present the paperwork to Nissan within seven days of the test_drive . Failure to disclose those conditions was deceptive , the commission said . The settlement requires Nissan to disclose restrictions in future promotions . Nissan said it believes the promotion was fair and accurate but that it agreed to settle the_matter &quot; in the interest of consumers. &quot; No monetary settlement is involved . Nissan said it paid_out &quot; hundreds of thousands of dollars &quot; as a result of the promotion . It no longer makes the Stanza . The FTC approved the settlement 3 to 2 , with Chairwoman Janet D . Steiger and Commissioner Dennis A . Yao dissenting . In a joint statement , they expressed concern that the settlement &quot; may give implicit approval to the use of seemingly attractive promotional offers that many consumers simply cannot utilize because of limitations. &quot; They also said the settlement could be interpreted to mean that advertisers need not disclose restrictions unless they make a &quot; no catches &quot; claim .</TEXT>
