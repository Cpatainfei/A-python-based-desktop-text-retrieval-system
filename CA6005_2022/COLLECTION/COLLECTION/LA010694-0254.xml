   <HEADLINE> COMPUTER_FILE : HERE ' S HOW TO GOPHER A GLOBAL RIDE ON THE INTERNET ; LAWRENCE J . MAGID</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A lot of people talk and write_about the Internet , but far fewer actually use it on a regular basis . that ' s because it ' s no picnic . Even experienced users of on-line information services such_as America On-Line , Compuserve and Prodigy often find the Internet daunting . To begin with , the Internet isn ' t a single computer service . It ' s a worldwide network of thousands of computers located on every continent . Once you ' re connected to the Internet , you can &quot; cruise the digital highways &quot; to other connected machines . You don ' t have to pay any extra fee or phone charges , because many libraries , universities , companies and government_agencies allow guests to browse through their data banks , even if they don ' t have accounts on their systems . You can probably get a free or low-cost account if you ' re affiliated with a college or university . Some government_agencies and companies also offer employees access to the service . Commercial Internet carriers include Delphi , The Well , Portal and Netcom . Netcom ( ( 800 ) 501-8649 ) , whose prices start at $ 17.50 a month for unlimited access , is the least expensive option for people who want to spend a lot of time on line . Delphi ( ( 800 ) 695-4005 ) offers a plan for $ 10 a month that includes four free hours . Additional access is $ 4 an hour . There are some Mac and Windows programs that make the Internet easier to use , but these require a special type of account called a SLIP ( Serial Line Interface Protocol ) or PP ( Point to Point ) . Programs include Mosaic ( Mac , Windows and Unix ) , which you can download for free , and Air Navigator ( Windows ) , a commercial program for local_area_networks from Spry Communications of Seattle . * The Internet will get easier to use later this year . America On-Line , a service for Mac , Windows and DOS users , has announced that it will offer limited Internet access starting this month . Several current Internet carriers , including Delphi and Netcom , reportedly are working_on software for Windows and Mac users . In the meantime , there are some tools to make life easier for people who want to start exploring the Internet right away . These work with just about all Internet services and require no special software to use them . Once you get an account , you can access the service and these programs with any terminal program , including the one that comes free with Microsoft Windows . One of the most useful tools is Gopher , a menu system that links you to other Internet sites around the world . You don ' t have to buy or even download Gopher . It ' s available from most Internet systems just by typing the word gopher . The best known of all Gophers , developed at the University of Minnesota , is available from most Internet providers . It can be accessed by typing &quot; gopher gopher.tc.umn.edu &quot; from any prompt . There are lots of other Gopher systems , such_as the one at University of California , Santa Cruz ( type &quot; gopher scilibx.ucsc.edu &quot; ) , which give quick access to weather information , electronic books and other interesting material . Gopher , by the way , is a triple metaphor for ( 1 ) a rodent that does its work by tunneling underground and out_of_sight , ( 2 ) go_for as in &quot; go_for some information &quot; and ( 3 ) the mascot of the University of Minnesota . When you access Gopher , you get a series of menus , one of which lets you connect with other Gophers in Africa , Asia , Europe , North_America and elsewhere around the world . After logging_on to Netcom , I was able to use Gopher ' s various menus to log_on to computer_systems at Harvard and Oxford_universities and other campuses around the world . I was also able to tap the University of California library system , which provides information on just about all UC library holdings , even those that have been around since long before the catalogue was kept_on a computer . Another Gopher option through the Library of Congress Information_System makes_it possible to peruse the library ' s catalogues of books , periodicals ( serials ) , maps and other items . Federal legislation from past sessions of Congress ( back to 1973 ) and the current one can also be obtained .</TEXT>
