   <HEADLINE> A DREAM IS DRY-DOCKED ; DEJECTED MERCHANT MARINERS RETURN TO L.A. AS D-DAY VOYAGE IS SCRAPPED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A restored World_War_II cargo_ship and its crew of gray-haired former merchant_marine seamen made a somber return to Los Angeles Harbor on Sunday , a week after their planned 9 # 000-mile voyage to France was scrapped because of engine trouble . It was not the triumphant return many expected when the Lane Victory and its crew -- almost all_of them in their 60s and 70s -- steamed out of Los Angeles Harbor on April 29 bound for celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the D-day landing on the Normandy coast of France . As hundreds of friends and family members gathered under cloudy skies at Berth 53 in San Pedro to welcome the returning merchant_marines , many of the Lane Victory ' s dejected crew_members moped about the deck or leaned gloomily against the ship ' s railings . &quot; I feel horrible , &quot; said 3rd Mate Allen Thronson , 71 , who hugged his daughter , Jennifer Underwood , after she marched up the ship ' s gangway to greet him Sunday morning . &quot; That ship runs beautifully , and I don ' t see why we couldn ' t continue the trip. &quot; The Lane Victory developed engine trouble five days after leaving Los Angeles and limped into port in Acapulco , Mexico , on May 4 . Several days later , the board of directors of the U.S. Merchant_Marine Veterans of World_War_II , which owns the 455-foot ship , voted 4-1 to scuttle the trip and order the crew to return home to San Pedro . The ship returned under its own power . Delays caused by mechanical problems would have made_it nearly impossible for the crew to arrive in France in time for the June 6 ceremonies , said Joe Vernick , president of the veterans group . Also , the ship needed a custom-made part for the evaporator that converts salt water into fresh_water , said chief engineer Pete Jacobelly , who flew back to Los Angeles from Acapulco . &quot; Prudence demanded that it come_back , &quot; said John O . Smith , 83 , a member of the merchant_marine veterans board who stood at the berth to welcome the crew back to San Pedro . But many of the ship ' s volunteer crew , including Capt . Bill Tilgh m an , disagreed . Last week , 34 of the 54 crew_members signed a petition stating they wanted to continue the trip . In addition , two of the veterans group ' s board_members who were aboard the Lane Victory said they were excluded from the vote . &quot; We felt let_down , &quot; said former merchant_marine John Struyk , 72 . He and his wife , Maryanne , both were aboard the Lane Victory when the trip was canceled . Had all gone as planned , the Lane Victory would have steamed south through the Panama_Canal to rendezvous near Bermuda with the Liberty_ship Jeremiah O ' Brien out of San Francisco . The Coast Guard required that the Lane Victory cross the Atlantic with another ship . But oil leaked into one of the Lane Victory ' s two boilers as the ship neared Acapulco , and the trip was delayed . Although the leak was repaired at_sea , the boiler needed to be cleaned with chemicals that were available only in port . By the time the work was completed , the rendezvous with the Jeremiah O ' Brien would have been impossible . As late as Tuesday , crew_members were hoping that the Lane Victory could be escorted across the Atlantic by one of 14 Navy ships expected to make the voyage , said Clint Johnson , a member of the merchant_marine veterans board . But those hopes were dashed when the Lane Victory -- following the board ' s orders -- left port in Acapulco on Wednesday to steam back to Los Angeles . &quot; We ' re glad they ' ve returned , &quot; said Tina Richardson , 27 , of Buena Park , who worried about the safety of her grandfather , Lee Chamberlain , and the rest of the ship ' s crew . * Although the trip to France has been scrapped , the merchant_marines might yet make a voyage to celebrate the D-day anniversary . The ship has been invited to take_part in a re-enactment of the Normandy invasion on the beaches of Santa Monica on June 1 with three other ships . The ship will see other action , as well . The Lane Victory will be transformed into a Hollywood movie set for three days of filming later this month , said Smith . The new plans are small solace for the grizzled merchant mariners who began dreaming of making the voyage to Normandy back in 1992 after they restored the Lane Victory , and it took about 700 passengers on a daylong cruise to Santa Catalina Island . All told , the ship ' s crew_members needed more_than $ 1 million in fuel , equipment , supplies and cash to make the Normandy trip . After numerous delays , a $ 250 # 000 contribution by the Norris Foundation of Long_Beach put the crew over the top .</TEXT>
