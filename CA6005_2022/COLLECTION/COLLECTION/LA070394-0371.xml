   <HEADLINE> MIDYEAR INVESTMENT REVIEW AND OUTLOOK ; A GLOBAL QUEST FOR CASH ; GROWTH : IS THERE ENOUGH CAPITAL TO GO AROUND ? SOME THINK NOT -- AND SAY A LOOMING SHORTAGE EXPLAINS A GREAT_DEAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Before so_much of the world decided to go capitalist , someone should have asked a simple question : Is there enough capital to go_around ? With 1994 half over , financial markets are already fixated on next year . And the global economy that some investors now envision in 1995 is one that will be trying to fire on all cylinders , only to find that the necessary fuel -- capital -- is in woefully short supply . The prospect of a planet full of eager entrepreneurs and road-and-bridge-building governments all bidding for scarce resources -- including money -- to realize their dreams of growth is the dark cloud overhanging world financial markets today , these analysts say . A looming capital shortage , this school argues , explains why long-term interest_rates remain absurdly high relative to current low inflation . It also explains why prices of &quot; hard &quot; resources ( in the form of many commodities ) are rising , and why investors are fleeing the currencies of some of the most capital-needy countries , such_as the United States , which could be most vulnerable in a time of short funds . The issue is not so_much whether money and resources will be available to fund a global economic expansion in 1995 , these experts say , but at what price , and therefore with what consequences . &quot; Any given price ( for capital ) will clear the market , but it ' s not at ' any price ' that economies can grow , &quot; warns Kenneth S . Courtis , senior economist for Deutsche Bank Capital Markets in Tokyo . If too many would-be capital users are priced out of the market , the great promise of the post-Cold War world -- that free markets would raise living standards for all -- may vaporize . More important for the average American , a global capital shortage could finally bring_home the painful cost of the nation ' s towering budget and trade_deficits -- and significantly change the outlook for investing here and abroad . * The idea of a global capital shortage first surfaced when the Berlin Wall fell_in 1989 , heralding the breakup of the Soviet_Union and the beginning of the end of rigid communism worldwide . Some economists wondered aloud about the cost of suddenly integrating the so-called First , Second and Third_worlds under the capitalist-consumerist banner . But before the world economy could lift_off in the new era -- and with it , the worldwide demand for money -- Iraq invaded Kuwait in August , 1990 . The subsequent Gulf War , coupled with a bursting of the real_estate and financial bubbles in Japan and a massive corporate restructuring campaign by American companies , produced recessions so deep and long lasting in the United States , Europe and Japan that the developed world ' s need for capital was significantly muted . In the United States , for example , private credit demand dwindled so markedly that the Federal_Reserve_Board was able to cut short-term interest_rates to 30-year lows by last year , pulling long-term rates down as well . Those lower rates , in turn , helped businesses and consumers rebuild their balance_sheets and set the stage for a new economic expansion . Now that expansion is in_full_swing in the United States . And to the surprise of many economists , Europe too is rebounding , and Japan appears ready to follow . In the meantime , the bulk of the developing world -- China , India , Southeast_Asia and Latin_America -- has been growing at a brisk pace since 1991 and is counting_on new growth in the industrialized nations to further its own economic advance . Even in troubled Africa , the emergence of a free South_Africa is expected to provide a catalyst for economic improvement . David Hale , economist at Kemper Corp . in Chicago , points_out that the world ' s capitalists have waited 80 years for this . &quot; For the first time since 1914 , practically all_of the nations on this planet have market-oriented economic_systems , &quot; he says . And in 1995 , virtually all_of those individual economies should be growing synchronously for the first time . Or trying . * Hence the capital-shortage conundrum : A planet swarming with capitalists will require money and resources at a_level never before witnessed . Some of that increased demand is already visible ; much is admittedly theoretical , if quite logical : * In the United States , outstanding commercial and industrial loans at banks , which plunged from $ 640 billion in early 1991 to $ 585 billion by the end of 1993 as businesses paid down debt , have been rising almost nonstop this year . With corporate borrowers again stepping_up to the window , the loan total has already climbed back to $ 609 billion . * Privatization of state-owned enterprises -- through stock offerings that suck_up available capital -- continues in_full_swing in China , the former Soviet_Union , Eastern Europe and Latin_America . And those developing nations now have been joined by capital-short Western governments struggling to streamline their own economies . France , for example , is in the midst of a five-year plan to raise $ 78 billion through stock offerings in state-owned firms such_as drug giant Rhone-Poulenc . A privatization program is also under way in Italy , where the government raised $ 3.1 billion just last week by selling a 51 % stake in insurance_company INA to public investors . * In East Asia , the money needed to develop the fast-growing region ' s inadequate infrastructure alone could total a stunning $ 1 trillion over the next six years , according to John Lonski , economist at Moody ' s Investors Service in New York . For instance , Taiwan is in dire need of more power_plants , Lonski says . &quot; Electric_power now must be rationed during the summer months because of ( power-generating ) reserve margins that border_on the anorexic &quot; -- typically , a mere 5 % over normal usage , he says . * In one of the biggest market surprises this year , the prices of many commodities have surged as rising demand from growing economies has suddenly revealed relative shortages of worldwide staples such_as coffee and cocoa . William Gross , managing director of Pacific Investment Management Co . in Newport Beach , sees the commodity revival as a byproduct of the developing world ' s rapid ascendance as an economic force . &quot; The developing world was known in previous decades as the provider of commodities for Japan , Europe and the United States , &quot; Gross says . &quot; Now they will be using an increasing amount for their own growth , and prices will have upward momentum. &quot; * It is that accelerating competition between the developed world and the developing world that is the root cause of the coming capital shortage , analysts say . The mature economies of the Western world should be at a stage where they are supplying capital to the developing world , where growth is faster -- and where , therefore , investment returns should be higher . In fact , the West has exported vast amounts of capital to developing countries . In the 1970s , for example , there was massive ( and ultimately disastrous ) lending to Latin_America by U.S. banks . Today , Western investment in developing countries is booming again , and this time it is more direct , often in the form of equity . Nowhere was that more evident than in the frenzy U.S. investors demonstrated for &quot; emerging market &quot; foreign stocks last year . In the 12 months ended March 31 , assets in the emerging-market category of stock mutual_funds skyrocketed from $ 918 million to $ 6.7 billion , according to fund tracker Lipper Analytical Services in New York . While the West was growing slowly or not at all between 1990 and 1993 , capital exports to the developing world were no great concern , and even were encouraged . Now , however , the question increasingly being asked is whether the West can retain enough capital to finance its own needs in 1995 , as the United States , Europe and Japan grow . What troubles many experts is that the West ' s propensity to generate savings and investment capital is dwindling , even as the demand for money within its own economies -- let alone those of the developing world -- is set to soar . Deutsche Bank ' s Courtis , who has lectured extensively on global capital flows , calculates that the so-called G-6 Western economies ( those of the United States , Germany , Britain , France , Italy and Canada ) saved a net 13.8 % of their gross_domestic_product during the 1960s . The G-6 savings rate fell to 12.7 % in the ' 70s , 8.1 % in the ' 80s and now is 7.8 % , Courtis says . At the same time , a chorus of critics say , the West has been spending too_much . The monuments to that imbalance , of course , have been America ' s twin deficits -- budget and trade -- which have ballooned for two decades . So far in the ' 90s , Germany and Japan , among other developed nations , have also found themselves increasingly preoccupied with burdensome internal spending issues . In Germany , the absorption of the former East_Germany caused the federal_government to run a budget_deficit equal_to 4.8 % of GDP last year , compared to a 0.1 % surplus in 1989 . In Japan -- long the world ' s most important net capital exporter -- the bursting of the bubble economy has forced many institutions to repatriate foreign-held wealth in_order to deal with a liquidity squeeze at_home . In effect , the plunge in Japanese real_estate and stock values has acted_as a giant margin_call . Combine a global economic expansion in 1995 with a declining Western savings rate and unprecedented financial needs in the capitalist developing world , Courtis argues , and the result is likely to be &quot; sharply increased tensions in world financial markets. &quot; * The first tangible sign of those tensions may have appeared on Feb . 4 , when the Federal_Reserve_Board began to tighten credit for the first time in five years . Ostensibly , the Fed has raised short-term interest_rates to slow the U.S. economy and thus keep inflation under_control . What higher short-term interest_rates also do , however , is encourage Americans to keep more of their money at_home instead of sending it abroad -- and to keep it in short-term savings accounts rather than in true long-term investment vehicles such_as stocks and bonds . Had the Fed deliberately wanted to husband liquidity that would be readily available to fund a growing U.S. economy , it could make no better move than to raise short rates . Not surprisingly , global stock and bond markets have been in turmoil ever since the Fed acted . Perhaps the biggest shock to markets worldwide has been the rise in &quot; real &quot; interest_rates , as measured by long-term bond yields . In the United States , the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury_bond has soared to 7.6 % from 6.35 % on Feb . 4 . Yet the prospects for inflation , which theoretically determine long yields , have remained tame by virtually all accounts ; U.S. consumer prices are expected to rise only about 3 % this year . That means the after-inflation yield on long-term bonds now is about 4.5 % , a historically gigantic premium . What is causing such high real interest_rates ? The unwinding of excessive speculation in bonds last year is part of the answer , many analysts say ; speculators who had bought bonds with borrowed money last year , betting_on a continuing slide in yields , have been forced to bail_out of their bets this year . That has increased the supply of bonds for_sale , forcing prices down ( and thus yields_up ) . But some experts see something more fundamental at_work : The markets , they say , are recognizing that demand for money will be rising powerfully worldwide in 1995 , so the price of that &quot; commodity &quot; is going_up . Pacific Investment Management ' s Gross , among others , has been warning his clients that the world economic outlook &quot; suggests a higher level of real interest_rates ( ahead ) than in prior decades. &quot; Edward Leamer , professor of economics at UCLA ' s Anderson business_school , cautions against viewing the concept of a global capital shortage as an instantaneous event , but he nevertheless draws the same long-term conclusion as Gross : &quot; I see a slow , general increasing trend in real interest_rates , &quot; he says , as more borrowers compete for scarce dollars -- or yen or marks or pesos . * If the idea of a global capital shortage is hard to grasp , the pain of high real interest_rates is not . Should long-term yields stay high worldwide , the effect will be similar for the home_buyer in Anaheim , the entrepreneur in Bangkok and the multinational corporation in Berlin : All will have to work harder to meet debt payments and make ends meet . High real rates also change the equation for world stock_markets -- which is a large part of what is troubling the markets this year , many analysts say . Higher interest_rates are a natural depressant on stock prices and inevitably make investors far choosier about the stocks they will buy , because expected returns must be high enough to compete with better yields on bonds and bank CDs . Ironically for the West , increased discretion on the part of its well-heeled investors may exacerbate the impact of any capital shortage in the developed world , for a simple reason : If the developing world continues to grow at a faster pace , investment returns there should follow , which should keep money flowing into those markets . that ' s an argument for American investors to own more emerging-market stocks in the ' 90s , not fewer . Indeed , the most surprising aspect of a global capital shortage in the ' 90s may be who wins and who loses -- that is , which countries wind_up less short than others . Deutsche Bank ' s Courtis contends that the clear winner will be East Asia , for a very simple reason : If capital creation becomes paramount , the countries that have the highest savings rates and the lowest labor costs will find it easier to fund their own growth . And no countries generate more internal savings than the nations of East Asia , including China , Taiwan , South_Korea and Thailand . Consider : In 1981 , just 14 % of global central_bank reserves were in Asia , including Japan , according to Courtis . By 1992 , that figure had reached 43 % . In contrast , the United States -- with its dismally low savings rate and monolithic deficits -- is in increasing danger of losing its post-World War II ability to dictate the terms of its growth , and the world ' s , Courtis warns . The latest battle to prop_up the dollar , he and other economists say , is merely a symptom of a larger problem , which is that America is already beholden to too many foreign creditors . Foreign and increasingly powerful creditors . The inevitable result of the ' 90s capital shortage , Courtis contends , is that &quot; the money that North_America and Europe need will increasingly be set_on terms and conditions determined in Asia . I think this is going_to be the story in the markets over the next few years. &quot; The Case for a Capital Shortage Some analysts say a shortage of capital -- the result of economies growing on almost every continent -- explains much of what is ailing financial markets worldwide . That includes stubbornly high interest_rates , soaring commodities prices and the weak U.S. dollar . * THE DEVELOPING WORLD ' S HUNGER FOR CAPITAL IS VORACIOUS . . . Net capital inflow into developing countries , average annual sum in billions of dollars : * 1976-1980 : $ 15.8 1981-1985 : 40.9 1986-1990 : 37.4 1991 : 126.4 1992 : 143.0 1993 : 159.5 * . . .

AND THE WESTERN WORLD ' S SAVINGS RATE -- AND HENCE ITS AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL -- IS PLUNGING . * Net Savings rate , as a percentage of gross_domestic_product , for G-6 countries : * 1960s : 13.8 % 1970s : 12.7 % 1980s : 8.1 % 1990s : 7.8 % * Note : G-6 includes the United States , Germany , Britain , France , Canada and Italy .
