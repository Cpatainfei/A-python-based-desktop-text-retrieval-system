   <TEXT> Hola ! . . . puff puff , puff . . . Como esta usted ? . . . puff , puff , puff . . . Only five more miles to go ! Bueno ! . . . puff . I made_it -- logged nearly 15 miles on an exercise_bike and at_the_same_time expanded my knowledge of a foreign tongue . Education and exercise ? Surely this is what living_in the ' 90s is all about . By the end of this seven-week class I will have terrific language skills , not to mention great thighs . I ' m enrolled in Cyclearning Conversational Spanish at a local gym , Corner on Health . There are six of us , all adults . We face the chalkboard and our teacher ( the only person actually standing ) in a half-circle of stationary bicycles . She teaches ; we pedal . And we learn , possibly more efficiently than if we weren ' t simultaneously burning fat . that ' s the theory of gym owner Ellie Hodder , a former music_teacher . She once observed that kids learned faster if their bodies were working along with their minds . To test her theory , she added Exercycle French and Spanish to the gym ' s schedule . Now , nearly five years later , she has a faithful band of cycle learners . It seems they ' re game for just about any class on wheels . There have been nutrition classes , film appreciation classes , even a Perry Mason fan club that pedaled through the TV reruns . Then there ' s the highbrow stuff . This month , Hodder is bringing_in a director from the Portland Repertory Theatre , who will discuss this season ' s offerings over the whir of culture-seekers ' pedaling . The price of that class includes opening-night play tickets , but wearing bicycle shorts at the gala is discouraged . I ' m looking_forward to the fall film series . One feature-length film , plus group_discussion after the credits , can burn_up a lot of calories . &quot; Thelma and Louise &quot; is the one I don ' t want to miss . We will be pedaling away , with the long-range goal of improving our male-female relations , while on the screen T &amp; L are handling it in a different way . But for the moment , I ' m in Spanish class . It ' s a relief to see that other students are also saddle_sore and occasionally have to stand_up on the pedals to restore circulation . At least Spanish class doesn ' t dehydrate me ; like all_the other students , I keep my water_bottle handy . I had originally signed_up for French but attended only one class . You see , some time ago I ' d had four years of high_school French . It soon became clear that my rather elementary French was miles beyond that of my fellow_travelers . After just a_few laps of class , the teacher observed that my French was coming_back . &quot; Yes , &quot; I agreed . &quot; It ' s like riding a bicycle. &quot; I dropped_out -- dismounted , actually -- with some regret because the_French students had devised a fun way to motivate their feet . They kept track of their mileage and then mapped their progress on the route of the Tour de France . A few veterans of the_French class -- those students with the slim thighs -- remarked that they ' d already circled France several times . Somebody suggested Tahiti for a change , until they realized that their total mileage from the first_class alone already had exceeded Tahiti ' s circumference . Oh , well . Back to France . I said au_revoir and transferred to Spanish . Our teacher ( or pedalgogue , if you will ) had lived_in Mexico for five years and was working_at a Portland preschool when she landed this job . She said it was the oddest way of teaching Spanish she ' d ever seen , but she liked the method . &quot; I ' ve always taught with games and a lot of moving_around , &quot; she said . In this class , of course , it ' s only our feet that are moving_around . But because we ' re constantly clutching the handlebars , we can ' t refer to notes or dictionaries . The teacher gets our rapt attention . She teaches us snippets of Spanish conversation and we practice among ourselves , turning_to speak_to neighboring cyclists . Among the questions already in our repertoire : &quot; Where are you going ? &quot; . . . puff , puff , puff . . . &quot; Do you like to bicycle ? &quot; By the end of the hour , I know it ' s been a good class if my shirt is sopping wet . I wipe my brow and slip_off the saddle . I do stretches for my quads , calves and hamstrings . Someday I ' ll be able to say those words in Spanish . Already we ' ve learned a children ' s song about touching our head , neck and shoulders , but we didn ' t dare do the hand movements for fear of falling_off our bikes . It was hard enough adjusting the rhythm of the song to the rhythm of our pedaling . Everybody ' s raring to go before the next class begins . We ' re doing warm-ups and stretches while greeting each other in Spanish : &quot; Hola ! &quot; But our teacher is a_few minutes late . She rushes in , apologetic . She lost track of the time , she says . She was at_home , riding her Exercycle . Everybody ' s doing_it . Muy bien ! PHYSICAL FITNESS</TEXT>
