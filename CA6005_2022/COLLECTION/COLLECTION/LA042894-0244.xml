   <HEADLINE> FROM YELTSIN , PROFILES IN COURAGE , DOUBT , DESPAIR ; RUSSIA : THE PRESIDENT STRESSES HIS SENSITIVE SIDE IN A VOLUME OF MEMOIRS . ITS CANDOR ASTOUNDS INITIAL READERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To the strains of a pianist in gold lame , diplomatic applause and the clink of champagne glasses , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin on Wednesday formally presented to the world a cry from the heart for understanding . Much maligned by his compatriots and with his popularity at a new low , Yeltsin chose this moment to bring_out &quot; Notes of a President &quot; -- known in its American edition as &quot; The Struggle for Russia &quot; -- in an initial Russian print run of 100 # 000 copies . &quot; Many facts , many examples and decisions in this period . . . were known only to the president , &quot; Yeltsin , solemn but bright-eyed , told an exclusive reception in his honor . &quot; No one else could ever write or remember them. &quot; And so the 63-year-old Russian president , during sleepless nights or long_plane rides , dictated and wrote what he called &quot; the live truth , written today when all this happened and is still happening. &quot; It may or may_not contain the whole truth , but the book astounded its first Russian readers with the level of its candor -- including on Yeltsin ' s continuing uncertainty as_to whether many of his actions have been correct . &quot; Here is not just a president but a person with all his sufferings and problems , which he brings onto the page without trying to hide anything , &quot; said Omsk Gov . Leonid K . Polezhayev . &quot; What in some eyes would seem weakness actually makes people empathize. &quot; Prominent theater director Mark A . Zakharov said he had stayed_up until 3 a.m. the night before devouring the book . He said he had decided that &quot; this is the truth -- and that , today , is a very valuable item. &quot; From his family life and Kremlin infighting to his depressions and agonizing , the Russian president bares much of his internal life to his readers in a seeming attempt to do away in one blow with his image as remote , ailing and ill advised . He wanted in part , he writes , &quot; to destroy the stereotype of the hard-boiled , rigid leader. &quot; Some of the book ' s more sensational revelations had already been leaked , particularly tales of how the Russian government hung by a thread during the October fight for the White_House in Moscow . But for Russian readers who are likely to enjoy the simple style that Zakharov compared to Leo_Tolstoy ' s , the book offers one jaw-dropper after another , from Yeltsin ' s assessment of who his real friends are to his description of how his aides cheer him up when he sinks into gloomy passivity . The millions who have been baffled by many of their president ' s moves are likely to feel , after digesting his writings , that they at least have a solid sense of him as a person far more multidimensional than the Russian muzhik , or macho peasant , he often portrays himself to be . Yeltsin lingers in detail on his emotions , describing the &quot; agonizing process of decision-making &quot; when he contemplated dissolving Parliament last September , or how he hates &quot; public beating , when everyone gangs_up on you and pounds you from every side. &quot; His account of the harrowing trials of office could fail to win sympathy only from the most disillusioned of voters . &quot; The debilitating bouts of depression , &quot; he writes , &quot; the grave second_thoughts , the insomnia and headaches in the middle of the night , the tears and despair , the sadness at the appearance of Moscow and other Russian cities , the flood of criticism from the newspapers and television every day , the harassment campaign at the Congress sessions , the entire burden of the decisions made , the hurt from people close to me who did not support me at the last minute , who didn ' t hold_up , who deceived me -- I have had to bear all_of this. &quot; Yeltsin also writes openly on a wide range of Kremlin tangles and snafus , doing little to dispel the impression that his government suffers from a chronic lack of coordination and professionalism . He even mentions how the TelePrompTer broke_down when he was taping his critical speech last September dissolving the Parliament . He talks_about his car accident , his plane accident , former Vice_President Alexander V . Rutskoi ' s criticism of his poor clothes style , a minister ' s attempts to link him to a Western businessman suspected of corrupting Russian officials . He admits to a great many mistakes but sounds convincing when he attributes them to circumstance . On government disorder , for example , he writes : &quot; We had to figure_out everything from the start . What was a vice_president ? How should a Russian constitutional court look ? There was nothing but blank_space because no such institution had previously existed in Russia . . . . We had to proceed not from how people did things somewhere else , but from our own experience . But we didn ' t have any. &quot; Kremlinologists will have a field_day with Yeltsin ' s detailed descriptions of how his close aide Viktor Ilyushin plans the president ' s days and overburdens his schedule . And history will surely make much of Yeltsin ' s description of the political intuition that moved him to sign the Russian-Ukrainian-Belarussian treaty that effectively dissolved the Soviet_Union in December , 1991 . &quot; Perhaps I didn ' t completely fathom the prospects opening_up before me , but I felt in my heart that such major decisions had to be taken easily , &quot; he writes . His candor includes leaks from KGB documents he inherited in the Kremlin , including a report alleging that three Texas oil_tycoons ordered the assassination of President John F . Kennedy . Yeltsin acknowledges that he does not always take_care of himself , but he offers no confirmation at all_of widespread reports that he is ailing . &quot; The main problem with being president is the constant sense that you are inside a glass bowl for everyone to see , or in a kind of barometric chamber with an artificial atmosphere where you must stay all_the time , &quot; he notes . &quot; Soon you have the sensation that you are swathed in cotton. &quot; Overall , Yeltsin says as he ends the opus , &quot; the chief goal of this restless president is Russia ' s tranquillity. &quot; His latest push for peace has come_in the form of his campaign for all_of Russia ' s parties and social_groups to sign a political truce , agreeing to refrain_from strikes , violent protests and demands for early presidential elections for two years . The pact ' s signing was scheduled for today , but the going looked rocky after the Duma , the lower house of Parliament , demanded Wednesday that Yeltsin fire his interior minister in the wake of the apparently mob-related slaying of a 36-year-old Duma deputy who had published a list of top crime leaders . Some factions asked_for the truce signing to be postponed because of the murder or rejected it altogether . Deputies also demanded a decisive crackdown by Yeltsin on crime . Yeltsin expressed his condolences and promised an investigation but appeared unlikely to fire his loyal interior minister .</TEXT>
