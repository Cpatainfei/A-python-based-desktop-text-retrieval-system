   <HEADLINE> LIN ' S CASE ATTRACTS CONSPIRACY THEORIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Military hero , commander of the People ' s Liberation Army , compiler of Mao ' s &quot; Little Red Book &quot; of quotations , Lin Piao was China ' s second most powerful man when , according to the official Chinese government version , he fled China on a British-built Trident jet on Sept . 12 , 1971 . The official version , released months after Lin Piao ' s disappearance , was that the Chinese leader and his powerful wife , Ye Qun -- who was also a Politburo member -- and their playboy son , Lin Liguo , were killed in the crash after their plane ran_out of fuel over the Mongolian steppe . In the haste to depart from the airport near the beach resort town of Beidaihe , there had not been time to refuel the aircraft . According to other accounts , however , Lin was never on the plane that fateful night . This theory was supported by reports in the Soviet press that none of the nine charred bodies found in the wreckage was more_than 50 years old ; Lin was 64 . Some conspiracy theorists claimed Lin had already been assassinated by Mao Tse-tung loyalists in an ambush and never made_it on the plane . The most prominent of these accounts is the 1983 book &quot; The Conspiracy and Murder of Mao ' s Heir , &quot; supposedly written by a Chinese official under the pseudonym Yao Ming-le and published first in the United States by Alfred A . Knopf Co . According to the Yao Ming-le version , after uncovering an assassination plot against him by Lin and his family , Mao invited Lin Piao and his wife to a sumptuous dinner on Sept . 12 , 1971 , at Mao ' s Jade Tower Mountain villa outside Beijing . Along with Chinese Premier Chou En-lai and Mao ' s wife , Jiang Qing , Lin and wife reportedly feasted on meat from freshly killed Manchurian tigers and sipped 482-year-old wine from a Ming porcelain vessel . Afterward , Mao had the couple ' s car blasted with ground-to-ground missiles on_the_road leaving the villa . Some even claim that Lin survived the air crash , only to die years later in a Soviet safehouse . A fictionalized account featuring the Lin Piao case , &quot; Chinese Assassin , &quot; by British novelist Anthony Grey , is what Peter Hannam said first inspired him to investigate Lin ' s death after a year struggling to survive as a free-lance journalist in Ulan Bator , Mongolia ' s bleak capital city .</TEXT>
