   <HEADLINE> WHERE WAS THE OVERSIGHT ? THERE ' S AMPLE BLAME FOR O.C. BANKRUPTCY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a retired banking executive , I find it appalling that one person could have had such control over the investments of such a large pool as in Orange County . Preservation of principal should be the conservative investment approach for any entity entrusted with public funds . While I was aware of ( Robert ) Citron ' s repo investments , I presumed they were a very small piece of the county ' s funds . I find it somewhat ironic that the various municipality and agency treasurers are now running_for cover when they knew what type of investments Mr. Citron was making . He made no secret of these , as ( John ) Moorlach touted during his campaign . There was an element of greed connected with these investments that these various treasurers seem to now want to disavow . I really question the oversight process in our county . The grand_jury has the responsibility of investigating the various county agencies . In reviewing the summary of Orange County Grand_Jury reports for the past 14 years , I find that the treasurer-tax collector entity has not been examined since 1985 ! How could this be given the recession we ' ve experienced and the notoriety Mr. Citron ' s investments drew during his reelection bid ? Where was our Board of Supervisors ? Why would n ' t they have raised the question about the prudence of his investments and had this looked_at by an independent body ? BOB REED Santa Ana * Advice to the higher-ups hunting for scapegoats in the bankruptcy debacle : Just blame it on the illegal ( immigrants ) . A significant number of Orange County ( residents ) would buy that . MONA DAVIS Cypress * As Orange County property_owners pay $ 1 billion for the property_tax installment this week , it is an especially bitter experience . We are merely replacing a portion of what was lost this year by the county government gambling with our hard-earned money . The $ 1.5-billion loss has implications far beyond Orange County , as it raises yet another question about the ability and efficiency of any government bureaucracy . Citron unwittingly provided another reason why many voters want government to do less whenever possible . WILLIAM L . STRONG San Clemente * Our county treasurer-tax collector has to my knowledge been given no mandate to gamble or risk any taxpayer ' s money for a potential &quot; higher than average yield. &quot; Derivatives are guaranteed to make money only for the bank or financial_institution that puts it together , the broker that brokers it , and the lawyers that later on will argue the legality of the transaction . It is a sophisticated and clever way of siphoning money out of the general economy where the payee ultimately becomes the taxpayer . The pathetic part to the story is that I see no one willing to assume responsibility for this mess . When a bridge collapsed in Seoul , South_Korea , recently , the engineers that designed it were sent to jail . What Robert Citron has done is no less criminal than what former junk_bond king Michael Milken did , and will cost the county more_than the sum_total of all burglaries committed in 1994 . IVAR SCHOENMEYR Anaheim * Orange County is down $ 1.5 billion because our county treasurer , Bob Citron , made risky investments . The ramifications of this disaster are yet to be determined -- but it is safe to say we are in big financial trouble . Citron and his staff must accept the blame . But there are others who should be feeling uncomfortable -- for instance The L.A. Times . This might have been avoided if voters would have taken John Moorlach seriously when he ran against Citron in the June elections . Moorlach exposed this problem and predicted the disaster . Why didn ' t the voters take Moorlach more seriously ? We trusted The Times ! When The Times endorsed Citron , so did its readers . I think you owe the citizens of Orange County an apology . B . O ' NEIL Newport Beach * Your editorial , &quot; The Risk of Living_in Investment ' s Fast_Lane ( Dec . 3 ) , &quot; made me wonder if there shouldn ' t be a law that prevents the state from gambling with the public ' s money -- ever . In too many instances the word &quot; investment &quot; is but a euphemism for the word gambling . If the state wants interest on its money , it should be &quot; investing &quot; in federal bonds or putting the money in federally insured banks . So all we may get is 3 % . So what ? At least we can all sleep at night . The worst part is that they invested money they didn ' t have . They borrowed money on credit . Now that ' s got_to be a no-no when dealing with the public ' s money . BENNY WASSERMAN La Palma</TEXT>
