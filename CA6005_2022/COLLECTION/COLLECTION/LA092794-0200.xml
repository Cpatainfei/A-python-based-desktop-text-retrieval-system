   <HEADLINE> BODY WATCH ; WAIST AWAY ; A NEW GENERATION OF DIET DRUGS IS GAINING FAVOR AMONG OBESITY EXPERTS . THE LONG-TERM AIDS SEEM TO BE EFFECTIVE -- AND NOT ADDICTIVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No matter which diet Iris Golden tried , success was short-lived . Soon after shedding pounds , the 5-foot-2 owner of a Chicago executive search firm would return to her pre-diet weight of 250 pounds . Michael Heald , 41 , of West Hollywood , understands . At 30 , his weight began to increase , topping out at 258 pounds and sticking like glue to his 5-foot-7 frame . Today , Heald and Golden are both trimmer and , they say , happier . Golden , 57 , is a Size 10 or 12 and no longer shops for pants with 44-inch waists . Heald , who works for a Los Angeles law_firm , has dropped more_than 50 pounds . Both are disciples of an investigational new treatment approach that views obesity as a chronic medical problem , not a willpower deficit . Every day , Golden and Heald take medication to control their weight . They also eat a healthful low-fat_diet and exercise moderately . &quot; It ' s becoming apparent that obesity is a regulatory problem of body fat , just like hypertension is a regulatory problem of blood_pressure or diabetes is a regulatory problem of sugar , &quot; says Dr. Frank Greenway , a UCLA associate clinical professor of medicine and a leading national obesity researcher . Like many hypertensives and diabetics , obese people need chronic medication , Greenway and others contend , not the traditional 12-week regimen of appetite suppressants usually prescribed . Not everyone agrees with this new pill-a-day approach , but it is gaining favor , especially among obesity experts . At the 7th International Congress on Obesity last month in Toronto , many research papers focused_on these so-called new generation diet drugs . Among the medicines under study are a new combination of two old appetite suppressants , antidepressants and a drug that lets some fat from foods pass right through the body . Some drugs under study could be approved as obesity treatments in three years or less , researchers estimate . Traditional diet drugs have a bad reputation , Greenway says , based on older generation medicines that could be addictive and cause people to get &quot; jittery. &quot; But the newer medications are not addictive , he says , and have been studied for longer terms . * This interest in long-term diet medications is peaking at a time when obesity is rampant and failure is the norm in weight maintenance . About 30 million Americans are obese , defined roughly as being 20 % or more above ideal weight . Obesity may increase risk for heart_disease , diabetes , osteoarthritis and other ailments . About 95 % of those who enroll in organized weight loss programs regain the weight , according to the National Institutes of Health , most within one to three years . The pill-a-day approach received a big boost two years ago when a University of Rochester study of appetite suppressants , published in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics , was picked_up by the press . In short order , 5 # 000 requests for more information flooded the university , recalls spokesman Robert Loeb . In the study , a new combination of two old appetite suppressants , phentermine ( Ionamin ) and fenfluramine ( Pondimin ) , helped some of the 121 subjects lose_weight when they also followed a program of dieting , exercise and behavior_modification , found Dr. Michael Weintraub , formerly at the University of Rochester and now director of the Food and Drug Administration ' s Office of OTC Drug Evaluation . During one 34-week phase , subjects assigned randomly to appetite suppressants lost 32 pounds on average while those assigned to placebo pills lost only 9 pounds . Then doses and regimens were varied . Taking suppressants intermittently didn ' t work as well as taking them continuously . Some on the suppressants maintained the loss for as long as they remained on the regimen , which was up_to 3 1 / 2 years . Not all patients lost_weight and there were some side_effects -- most common in the early months -- such_as dry mouth , nausea and diarrhea . Fenfluramine affects a brain chemical called serotonin ; phentermine affects chemicals called catecholamines . &quot; They both cause people to eat less and to lose_weight , &quot; explains Dr. Richard Atkinson , professor of medicine and nutritional sciences at the University of Wisconsin , Madison . During the last 20 weeks of the four-year study , when everyone discontinued the medication but kept dieting and exercising , &quot; almost everyone regained all_the weight , &quot; Weintraub found . For the past two years , Dr. Roy Blank , an internist in Charlotte , N.C. , has supervised more_than 1 # 200 people on the same regimen used by Weintraub , getting government approval to do so . ( In many states , use of these drugs for more_than 12 weeks is illegal. ) At the one-year mark , his subjects -- the vast majority women -- have lost on average about 15 % to 20 % of their beginning body_weight . Besides taking the daily medication , his subjects follow a 1 # 200 to 1 # 500 calorie diet and exercise moderately for about two hours a week . &quot; The key point is , these medicines are a supplement to what else we are doing , &quot; Blank says . The drugs cost his patients about $ 50 a month . ( Other researchers can ' t say for_sure what their regimens will cost once approved. ) Blank warns potential subjects about the possibility of gallbladder problems , associated not with the medicines per se but with the weight loss . &quot; In the last two years , 22 people have had to have their gallbladders removed , &quot; he says . In addition , depression became so severe in about 30 patients , he says , that they were taken_off the diet drugs and placed on antidepressants . Blank is collaborating on the analysis of his data with Atkinson , of the University of Wisconsin and a well-known obesity researcher . * Meanwhile , others are studying sibutramine , originally developed as an antidepressant . A two-year study , involving 1 # 050 patients , is now entering the second year at seven sites , says Greenway , one of the investigators . The highest sibutramine dose given -- 30 milligrams a day -- has resulted in a 20-pound weight loss at the six-month mark , says Greenway , with weight loss continuing after that time . The sibutramine , he adds , &quot; might work like a combination of fenfluramine and phentermine. &quot; Insomnia is often reported as a side_effect . Another antidepressant , Prozac ( fluoxetine ) , might also suppress appetite . After studies suggesting its value as a weight control aid , Prozac ' s manufacturer , Eli Lilly and Co. , sought Food and Drug Administration approval in 1988 to market it under the brand name Lovan as an obesity treatment , a representative says . But the request has not yet been approved , says FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan . The Lilly request is controversial because some who took the drug for depression have sued , claiming it can lead to violent behavior and even suicide attempts . But physicians who prescribe it regularly claim that those reactions are in the minority . Lilly contends that violent behavior does not increase with the drug ' s use . Another drug , orlistat , works by minimizing the amount of fat absorbed from food , says a representative for Hoffmann-La Roche , the developer . Orlistat binds to pancreatic lipase , an enzyme secreted by the pancreas to help break_down fat . As a result , about a third of a dieter ' s fat intake passes undigested through the body . Studies are continuing . * Not everyone believes long-term medication is the answer . Treating obesity can do more harm than good , psychologist Janet Polivy of the University of Toronto told participants at the Congress on Obesity . &quot; Because we do not know how to define which sorts of obesity are medically dangerous , decisions to treat are based more on weight than on actual risk , &quot; she says . The obese should obtain a physical exam to rule_out other causes of excess weight , Polivy says , and then should &quot; evaluate their eating and their exercise and find a weight appropriate for them. &quot; Even advocates of the approach urge caution . The regimens are all considered investigational , Greenway points_out . &quot; If you want in on this , &quot; he suggests , &quot; get involved in a trial &quot; -- in which patients are closely monitored for progress or side_effects . Agrees Atkinson : &quot; These drugs should be used as part of a research project . This does not mean private practice doctors can ' t prescribe ( them ) . &quot; Rather , Atkinson urges obese patients to find doctors well-acquainted with the new approach and who work with researchers to document findings and patient progress . * For a five-page summary and update of the original 68-page University of Rochester Diet Study , send a self-addressed , stamped , business-size envelope and $ 2 cash or check to Diet Study , University of Rochester Medical_Center , P.O.
