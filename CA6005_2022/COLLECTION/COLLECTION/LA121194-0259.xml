   <HEADLINE> MOVIES ; THE WARTS HAVE IT ; REMEMBER THE DAYS WHEN HOLLYWOOD GAVE US THOSE LOVING PORTRAYALS OF OUR HEROES ? GOOD , BECAUSE THOSE DAYS ARE HISTORY . GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Time was , if you were seeking some uplift , perhaps a smidgen of real-life inspiration , Hollywood could help you out with an ennobling film biography : Selfless scientist Louis Pasteur finds the cure for anthrax , makes milk safe for the world and still finds the time to rescue his infant during childbirth ! Swing king Glenn Miller gets the world ' s feet a-tapping ! Courageous Charles Lindbergh braves the elements and befriends a housefly while crossing the Atlantic ! More recently , however , bio-pics have portrayed less heroic lives : Pampered harridan Joan Crawford traumatizes her kids by revealing her hang-up about wire hangers ! Psychotic boxer Jake LaMotta beats his wife and winds_up a pathetic mound of flop sweat ! Hopeless case Sid Vicious -- well , Sid ' s just flat-out beyond hope . One could argue that they don ' t make role_models the way they used to , but the truth is , they don ' t make bio-pics the way they used to . This season could be seen as the Fall of the Legends , as four recent or upcoming films explore the darker , more personal aspects of heretofore celebrated historical heroes : * Ron Shelton ' s &quot; Cobb &quot; takes filmgoers on a dark , disturbing journey through the last few months of the life of baseball immortal Ty Cobb , as seen_through the eyes of his biographer , who witnesses Cobb ' s propensity for violence , racism and misogyny . * Alan Rudolph ' s &quot; Mrs . Parker and the Vicious_Circle &quot; bathes writer Dorothy Parker in a haze of booze , botched affairs and suicide attempts . * &quot; Tom &amp; Viv &quot; examines the tormented relationship between poet T . S . Eliot and his wife , Vivienne Haigh-Wood , depicting him as a sop who couldn ' t cope_with her mood swings and dealt with her in a most unfeeling manner . * &quot; Immortal Beloved &quot; rummages through Beethoven ' s little black_book , offering a speculative history of the composer ' s possible mistresses . &quot; The traditional Hollywood bio was a predetermined entertainment with the facts grafted on afterward , &quot; says writer-director Rudolph . &quot; Whether it was about an opera singer or an astronaut , it was the same old story . Those same films today are looking a lot more closely at their subjects , like the media in general. &quot; Says Larry Karaszewski , co-screenwriter of &quot; Ed Wood &quot; and the upcoming &quot; Larry Flynt , &quot; a portrait of the iconoclastic pornographer that Oliver Stone will produce for Columbia : &quot; Any genre goes_through an evolution . First there were the classical bio-pics , and now we ' re deconstructing them . People don ' t buy that ( naivete ) nowadays . You have to show what goes_on behind the scenes . &quot; Hollywood is largely formula stuff , and the way around that is to find some weird true story or person to make a movie about , a story you could never make as a fictional work . It helps you to break the rules -- the writer can say , ' Hey , it really happened. ' A guy who was a terrible movie-maker who was also a transvestite ? A pornographer who ran_for president ? You ' d be thrown_out of the ( studio executive ' s ) office if you just made that up. &quot; Brian Gibson agrees . &quot; Real-life scenarios are so_much more inventive than anything from the fiction writer ' s pen , &quot; says Gibson , who directed the Tina Turner bio &quot; What ' s Love Got to Do With It &quot; and &quot; The Josephine Baker Story &quot; and is producing an upcoming Frida Kahlo film for HBO . &quot; Audiences have become too sophisticated . They understand and want to see the shadow sides , the dark sides. &quot; But can sophisticated be a euphemism for nosy ? With the proliferation of tabloid-style journalism , morning talk_shows designed largely to get former lovers and friends screaming at one another and quickie TV movies torn , however messily , from current headlines , has our society just become addicted to dirt ? &quot; I think we are more nosy nowadays , &quot; says Miranda Richardson , who stars in &quot; Tom &amp; Viv &quot; and first made her mark as Ruth Ellis , the last woman to be executed in Britain , in the 1985 docudrama &quot; Dance With a Stranger. &quot; &quot; People would like to hear the truth sometimes , or as near as you can get . Looking_into this privileged territory helps make the story accessible to more people. &quot; Says Tommy Lee Jones , star of &quot; Cobb &quot; : &quot; We have grown_up and we have gotten nosy , both . It ' s easier to be nosy these days . that ' s why public figures are no longer required by the leadership and the press to be saints . We now acknowledge people can be both heroic and . . . &quot; He searches for the right word . Human ? &quot; Or worse. &quot; Film historian Leonard Maltin calls &quot; Cobb &quot; a first : &quot; I can ' t think_of another bio-pic that covers such a reprehensible character with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. &quot; Maltin , of course , recalls Martin Scorsese ' s 1980 epic &quot; Raging Bull , &quot; the damning saga of boxer LaMotta , one of the bellwethers of the current bio-pic trend and widely considered the finest film of the 1980s . &quot; that ' s an extraordinary film by any standard , &quot; Maltin says . &quot; It ' s a warts-and-all portrait that is intriguing in that regard , a turning point in the film biography. &quot; Before &quot; Raging Bull , &quot; Bob Fosse ' s 1974 film &quot; Lenny &quot; examined , darkly , the life of controversial comic Lenny Bruce . And Robert Altman ' s bicentennial satire &quot; Buffalo Bill and the Indians &quot; excoriated the Wild_West legend of Bill Cody . It included a memorable line that could justify many_a bio-pic : &quot; Truth is whatever gets the most applause. &quot; Shelton had &quot; Raging Bull &quot; in particular looming large in his mind while working_on &quot; Cobb &quot; but says that his film is intended to ask larger questions pertaining to the nature of celebrity in America . &quot; This is my version of ( biographer Al ) Stump ' s version of Cobb ' s version of himself , &quot; says Shelton , who also brought the story of Louisiana Gov . Earl Long and his lover , Blaze Starr , to the big screen in &quot; Blaze &quot; ( 1989 ) . That film , like &quot; Cobb , &quot; meditated on the role of the media in bringing public figures ' private lives into public purview . &quot; What should we know about celebrities ? My concern is not that we know too_much but that we get confused about what we know , that we pretend that because this man is a very good right_fielder or point guard that he is therefore a role_model , &quot; Shelton says . &quot; But that man is , whether he wants it or not , a role_model , by nature of his working in the public eye. &quot; Still , despite the wealth of public_knowledge about Cobb ' s epic unpleasantness , Shelton is sensitive to the idea that he has publicly taken_down a legend and that some will find his film off-putting : &quot; Cobb ' s grandchildren are not gonna like this movie , or his children . I had to make_peace with the fact that the family probably would n ' t approve of the movie . But he ' s been dead for 34 years , and for most of the previous 20 years he had little contact with his family . So I don ' t think I ' m doing damage to the family . If anything , we ' re trying to come_to terms with him . &quot; I would n ' t like a movie about my grandfather . And so be it . As a storyteller , I have to stay true_to what is the heart and the essence of these people . &quot; All the poetic_license is available to you , and yet you have to be rigorous ( in balanced research ) at_the_same_time . It ' s a tough subject . Obviously we ' ve come a long way from ' The Glenn Miller Story. ' &quot; Shelton poses the question bedeviling every maker of a film biography : &quot; If you ' re going to write_about someone in the spotlight , does that mean you are in the spotlight too ? If you accept that responsibility , are you willing to expose yourself the way you ' re exposing your subject ? I suggest the answer is ' no ' in almost every case. &quot; The crux of &quot; Cobb &quot; is an issue that filmmakers always face : What do you leave in a biography ? What do you omit ? More to_the_point , when does artistic license become flat-out misrepresentation of a human_being ? &quot; The danger is , when these films are good , you do believe them , &quot; Maltin says . &quot; You don ' t get a study guide when you walk into the theater . Moviegoers don ' t have to take an entrance exam to see a movie . For many in the audience , this will be their only exposure to a subject , and when something says it ' s a biography , when it says it ' s based on a true story , that ' s a certain cross to bear . You leave yourself open for attack if you take liberties with the facts . It ' s tricky -- filmmakers should take responsibility. &quot; This autumn saw &quot; Ed Wood , &quot; the misadventures of America ' s most inept movie-maker , and &quot; Quiz Show , &quot; based on the memoirs of Richard Goodwin , which revealed the fast-and-loose attitudes of some executives in television ' s early days . Both came under_attack , the former for its depiction of Bela Lugosi as a profane lech and the latter for its misrepresentation of major players in the game-show scandals . &quot; When the theme of your film is that you shouldn ' t lie for entertainment ' s sake , it leaves you a little susceptible to criticism , &quot; &quot; Ed Wood &quot; co-screenwriter Karaszewski deadpans about &quot; Quiz Show. &quot; His film ' s depiction of Lugosi was referenced , he adds , though he says : &quot; We later eventually realized that the source we were using was a little crazy . So instead of the story being about Bela going_off , it was just the source going off. &quot; Says Shelton : &quot; One has to make distinctions . We ' re in an age of television and tabloids , and newspapers are all kind of going mad . I don ' t think the rules are very clear , and I think they need to be clarified . We ' re asking people to think and make choices. &quot; Shelton ' s star disagrees . &quot; Bottom_line is , you ' re making a movie ; movies are , at their best , works_of_art , &quot; Jones says . &quot; They have no responsibility to anything , other_than themselves , so it ' s OK to exaggerate or change history to fit your story . And it ' s even OK to claim that it ' s history . And that ' s the approach I take. &quot; Jones recalls his Emmy-winning turn as Gary Gilmore in &quot; The Executioner ' s Song &quot; ( 1982 ) : &quot; The screenplay was by Norman Mailer , based on his book , which was supposed to be based on reality . There was somewhat of a difference between the real Gary Gilmore and the one in his book . There was a difference between the one in the book and the one in the teleplay . The idea was not to reproduce Gary ; it was to play a Gary Gilmore . It ' s impossible to come_up with a rule_of_thumb when playing a character from real life. &quot; Richardson , describing &quot; Tom &amp; Viv &quot; as &quot; faction &quot; and &quot; an imaginative reconstruction of events , &quot; acknowledges that the film fudges the truth on a key plot element that casts Eliot in a more critical light . &quot; I hope that people like to be challenged , and make_up their own minds about the characters , &quot; she says . &quot; Being sympathetic toward those characters doesn ' t mean glossing_over slightly less noble points. &quot; Rudolph likewise acknowledges that &quot; Mrs . Parker , &quot; starring Jennifer Jason Leigh as the writer , is hardly constructed like the ordinary bio-pic and that he takes some artistic liberties , but he insists that they are necessary to evoke the essence of his characters ' lives in a two-hour movie . &quot; It ' s presumptuous to think you can gather a whole person ' s life and put it in a two-hour movie , &quot; says Rudolph , who adds that his film &quot; would hold_up to factual scrutiny . But we ' re finding that the most picky audiences are people with a smattering of knowledge or ( who ) have gone_with the myths surrounding her . They ' ve taken a little information and determined that what they know is more important than what we know . &quot; Most of the scenes play_out uneventfully . I constructed the film that way on purpose . I didn ' t want to do the headlines of Dorothy Parker ' s life or compile a list of her greatest hits or quips . When you do that , you get brief scenes that don ' t go beneath the surface . Truth doesn ' t come_out in the content of a life . I ' m interested in the context , not just the content. &quot; Hence , Rudolph created a scene he acknowledges is fictional in which Parker and Robert Benchley ( Campbell Scott ) emotionally discuss their tormented platonic relationship . &quot; Yet people say that scene is one of the most realistic scenes in the film , &quot; he says . Rudolph doesn ' t think he has done Parker ' s memory a disservice by revealing her inner torment . &quot; I think it ' s a loving portrait of survival , &quot; he says . &quot; I call her a ' self-destructive survivor. ' You have to respect her enigmatic qualities instead of expose or simplify them for audiences. &quot; Those enigmatic qualities -- the essential information that puts an audience in communion with the film ' s subject_matter -- are often what is missing in film biographies , Maltin says . &quot; In doing biographies of creative , artistic people , it ' s tough to get inside a person , to dramatize the creative spirit , the muse that causes them to produce great works_of_art , &quot; Maltin says . &quot; ' Bird ' ( Clint Eastwood ' s 1988 Charlie Parker bio-pic ) is a film done_by a genuine jazz lover , yet it gives no indication of how much music really meant to Charlie . You would never know by seeing it how music was a driving force in his life and what an influence he had_on others . It was very disappointing. &quot; &quot; ' Chaplin ' never found what its hook was , what its main question was , &quot; filmmaker Gibson says . &quot; It ' s not enough to say he was a fascinating , successful man . You have to ask : ' What is it about him that interests me ? ' &quot; For Gibson , that muse that Maltin finds elusive in film biographies can lie_in the dark side of their subjects ' personalities . &quot; You have to look_at what it was about him that made him compulsive and ambitious and wanting to transcend the ordinary , &quot; he says . &quot; You have to establish a hole in a person ' s spirit , some damage from which that talent springs . They need that special motor , a fuel that pushes them to greatness , that pushes them in doing ordinary , everyday work to the extent that they become extraordinary . &quot; You have to approach film biographies in a fashion that you ' re doing more_than a bio-pic . It ' s not a National Geographic tour through someone ' s life , like she ' s the Grand Canyon. &quot; &quot; What ' s Love Got to Do With It &quot; is a special case because it painted a painfully unflattering portrait of someone still alive who did not cooperate with the production : Ike Turner is routinely shown abusing both drugs and Tina . Gibson says despite Ike ' s protestations after the film ' s release , there was never any legal trouble , largely because &quot; there was an infinite number of witnesses , from taxi drivers to choreographers -- I ' d run_into them after the movie was out and they ' d say , ' Oh , yes , I saw him when he used to knock her about. ' In Ike ' s case , if anything , we strayed on the generous side. &quot; Part of that may have been_due to an unexpected visit from Ike during location shooting . &quot; I was setting_up a scene and turned_around , and all_the crew had disappeared , &quot; Gibson recalls . &quot; I half-expected fireworks , but he was very mild , very sweet . He went_over to his car and opened the trunk and pulled_out photos and signed autographs for the whole cast and crew . We were influenced by that encounter with him in some scenes in the film. &quot; In the case of the upcoming &quot; Larry Flynt &quot; movie , one might expect a little protestation from the Hustler magazine_publisher -- the film ' s basic gist will be , &quot; Sure , he ' s a pig , but he has every right to say what he thinks , &quot; screenwriter Karaszewski says -- but , in fact , he has decided to cooperate with the project . &quot; One of the major points of the film is the court case with Jerry Falwell , which Flynt won when the court decided you could parody a public figure , &quot; Karaszewski says of the 1988 ruling in which the U.S. Supreme Court said that Flynt and his magazine Hustler did not violate libel laws in a vicious cartoon of Falwell . &quot; Because Flynt won that case , it gives us free_rein to do what we want with him. &quot; With &quot; Ed Wood &quot; and &quot; Larry Flynt , &quot; Karaszewski and writing partner Scott Alexander may be redefining the bio-pic in another fashion altogether , creating playful , postmodern pastiches that exalt the extraordinarily mediocre . &quot; What we do are anti-bio-pics , what people in a traditionally just society would not ordinarily get , &quot; Karaszewski says . &quot; They ' re not the Great Man bio-pic , which is two hours of being noble , or the Underbelly of the Great Man , which is , ' Here ' s what he was like in real life. ' With our characters , people hate them already , and we have to figure_out how to present our case for them. &quot; But until the campy bio-pic becomes the vogue , the muckraking film bio seems to be the form of choice . And Shelton , for one , has long pondered what is ethical and just when turning the lives of real human_beings into slick entertainments . &quot; What is discretion ? &quot; he muses . &quot; If a man is a womanizer , is that an issue ? It ' s only an issue if he ' s Gary Hart and dares you to prove he ' s not . If a man is a wife-beater , is that an issue ? Of course : It ' s criminal , felonious behavior . If a man is homosexual -- I don ' t understand ' outing ' people . If a man chooses to stay in the closet , that ' s his responsibility . &quot; I wish we could come_up with a simple rule that would apply in every case . The more we talk , the more difficult it is to come_up with a set of rules. &quot; Interestingly , the same actors who bring the lives of others to the public often cling tenaciously to their own private lives . For example : Is there a bio-pic in the story of a Texas actor who entered manhood as a rough-and-tumble football_player , who appeared in four stage plays before seeing one , who became much celebrated for his on-screen versatility as well as his prickly personality and eventually won an Oscar ? &quot; No , there isn ' t , &quot; Jones says with a grin . &quot; The subject_matter would sue you naked. &quot; For Shelton , his film bios must have intellectual and historical honesty , and it certainly doesn ' t hurt if they ' re entertaining . &quot; Why does ' Raging Bull ' stick_in people ' s minds ? &quot; he asks . &quot; Because it ' s well-made and we feel something of_the_essence of this man , LaMotta , captured . Artistic license ( was ) taken everywhere , and I don ' t care , because Scorsese captured something about human behavior . &quot; No one lives their lives in three neat acts . My job is to shape it . that ' s a matter of trust . Either I ' m talented and honorable at it , or I ' m not . &quot; There ' s no rules , I guess , no rules . It ' s all discretion , and we ' re not living_in an age of discretion. &quot;</TEXT>
