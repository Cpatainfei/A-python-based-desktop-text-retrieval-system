   <HEADLINE> BRIEFING PAPER ; FOREIGN ' VISITORS ' TO KEEP EYES FIXED ON MEXICO ' S ELECTION ; INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY IS SEEN AS PART OF AN EFFORT TO CONFER LEGITIMACY ON A PROCESS THAT TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN HEAVILY TAINTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Background : The Aug . 21 Mexican presidential election promises to be historic for a variety of reasons , not the least of which is the presence of officially acknowledged foreign &quot; visitors , &quot; in_effect , election observers . This will mark the first time Mexico has invited international scrutiny of its elections and is generally seen as part of an effort to confer legitimacy on a process that traditionally has been tainted by vote-rigging and back-room deals . &quot; There will be more international focus_on Mexican elections than ever , &quot; U.S. Ambassador James R . Jones told a small group of foreign reporters recently . &quot; What private investors in the United States and elsewhere will be looking_for is the transparency of the election . It will affect investment decisions. &quot; Earlier this month , Mexican officials asked U.N. advisers to review the vote-counting computer_system and to counsel Mexican poll watchers . The review is important because a computer crash in the 1988 vote count led many Mexicans to suspect that the presidential election was stolen by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) . In addition , the government is taking bids -- open_to foreign companies -- for an audit of the voter registration lists . Recently passed electoral reforms permit the government_agency in_charge of elections to invite foreign visitors to attend the polling . The reforms also outlined an extensive role for Mexican citizen-observers . Acting informally , citizen observers and poll watchers from political_parties have played an increasingly important role over the six years since the last presidential race in detecting irregularities and fraud in state and local elections . The Parties : The Federal Electoral Institute , a government_agency that runs elections in Mexico , is charged with inviting foreign visitors and deciding the basis and criteria for their attendance . Foreigners may be authorized to witness any phase of the election process , which would presumably include vote-counting . Controversy within the government over foreign poll watchers was resolved by a compromise that made the United Nations the outside organizing agent , avoiding the Organization of American_States , which is perceived to be heavily influenced by Washington . Besides evaluating the computer_system , the United Nations plans to work with Mexican civic groups that are organizing citizen-observers . The program will be overseen by the National Civic Alliance , an umbrella agency for about 400 organizations nationwide that has coordinated poll watchers in recent state elections . Mexico ' s nine political_parties will also have their own poll watchers . The opposition National Action Party -- a pioneer in election observing -- expects to cover about 95 % of the country ' s precincts , while the governing PRI is shooting_for 100 % . The third major political force , the Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) , currently has observers committed to all Mexico_City precincts and two-thirds of those nationwide . By election_day , party officials say they expect to have 100 % coverage . The Issues : Protests accusing the ruling party of vote fraud in state elections reached levels in recent years that forced the government to negotiate with opposition leaders to restore order , often by naming interim governors . To avoid such unrest in August -- a development that would be certain to upset foreign investors and jeopardize the country ' s economic program -- the government is promising &quot; squeaky clean &quot; elections . However , opposition parties , notably the PRD , are already questioning the reliability of the upcoming vote . &quot; The electoral process is being conducted based on the partiality of the electoral authority , an unreliable voter registration role , illegal and inequitable financing and access to the media and the lack of an effective judicial resource to make voting effective , &quot; PRD presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas wrote in a letter to U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali . The letter was sent the day after the government requested U.N. help . Such comments anger PRI officials , who say the country has made major strides in electoral reform . &quot; It would be understandable from people who had not been involved in the process , but they know better , &quot; charged Jose Angel Gurria , director of international affairs for the campaign of PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo . The Process : Mexican poll watchers will apply for nationwide accreditation at their local or district election offices . They must attend courses approved by the Federal Electoral Institute . The United Nations is expected to offer such courses . On election_day , the poll watchers will have the right to observe the installation of voting apparatus at the precinct , the voting , vote counting , posting of results outside the precinct , closure of the precinct and the report of precinct officers to district officials . They will have the right to report on what they observe to the Federal Electoral Institute . The rules for foreign visitors are less clear because the Mexican Congress has left the details to the electoral institute . The Mexican Constitution does not permit foreigners a formal role in Mexican elections . However , international groups have routinely attended state and mid-term congressional elections in recent years , commenting freely on any irregularities they saw . Even if the only foreign visitors formally invited are the U.N. advisers , they will see the voting and will undoubtedly comment on it , Mexican political analysts say . The 1988 Race Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari won the 1988 election with by far the weakest showing in the six-decade history of the Institutional Revolutionary Party . Opposition groups claimed fraud in 1988 returns . Here are the results of that election : * Carlos Salinas de Gortari , Institutional Revolutionary Party : 50.36 % Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , National Action Front : 31.12 % Manuel J . Clouthier , National Action Party : 17.07 % JUANITA DARLING</TEXT>
