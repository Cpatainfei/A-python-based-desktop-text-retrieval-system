   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / ' WAR ' HUNT : DIRECTOR REALLY OUT ON A LIMB</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Auditioning humans is grueling enough , but director Jon Avnet and his crew found themselves auditioning trees -- 272 of them -- for a central role in his forthcoming film , &quot; The War. &quot; The Universal film tells the story of the children of two poor Georgia families in the ' 60s feuding over a fort built from refuse in the most perfect tree imaginable -- an 800-year-old angel oak , 60 feet tall , with limbs that swoop down to the ground 100 feet on either side like open , inviting arms . The children ' s feud , in Avnet ' s words , &quot; is a war over junk and that becomes the perfect metaphor for what are we fighting for &quot; -- the &quot; we &quot; in this case being Americans who are waging a losing battle in Vietnam . Another key plot_line centers_on Vietnam veteran Jim Simmons ( Kevin Costner ) , father of two of the children involved , grappling with that question and counseling his children ( Elijah Wood and Lexi Randall ) over the senselessness of fighting over things that don ' t matter . Aside from telling a compelling story in the film ( which is to be released Nov . 11 ) , what did matter_to Avnet and associate producer Martin Huberty was laying_claim to just the right tree -- based on a drawing by Avnet ' s wife , Barbara , which ran in an ad in the Atlanta Constitution with these words : &quot; The Makers of ' Fried Green Tomatoes ' Are Back in Georgia : Make Your Tree a Star. &quot; Letters and Polaroid snapshots poured in from Georgia , Mississippi , the Carolinas and Florida . &quot; There were 90 gazillion resumes , &quot; laughed Huberty . &quot; People would take these pictures of trees in their back yard and put their wives and kids in them , like that would convince us to give them a part in the film. &quot; One of Huberty ' s favorites : a tree that had grown around a metal lawn_chair . Another favor ite was what some of the crew called the Charlie Brown tree : a 20-foot tall tree in the middle of a packed parking_lot that looked_like a stick_with a green ball on top -- &quot; exactly those kind of trees you drew_in the first grade. &quot; It met at least one criterion : There wasn ' t a building in_sight -- just 100 cars . Still , the selections were not exactly the arboreal ideal for the ultimate treefort that would inspire its inhabitants to defend it with life and limb . The winner , ultimately , was a tree in Beaufort , S.C. , actually located at the end of a Marine airbase runway with a road running_around it . Avnet had been hesitant to even go see it , since he had wanted a tree near Senoia , Ga. , where the movie was being filmed , and where &quot; Fried Green Tomatoes , &quot; his sleeper hit of 1991 , had also been filmed . But the South Carolina Film Commission was insistent on Avnet ' s flying to their state for a day . Scout Linda Lee had stopped by a convenience_store on the way to the airport to pick_up Avnet when she told the clerk about her search . &quot; He told her to drive down the road a mile and she ' d find her tree -- and there it was , &quot; said Maida Morgan , another location scout . It matched pictures of the angel oaks Avnet had seen in books , trees native to South Carolina that grow huge over the centuries because their branches twist so_much they broke blades when sawed , says Huberty . After sleeping_in the tree three nights , Avnet had a fort designed by Kristi Zea that didn ' t use a single nail but was mounted by planks in the four crotches of the tree . The road around the tree was ripped_up and the earth was prepped to handle the heavy movie equipment , cranes and trampling by the crew . &quot; There were other trees that were larger , but there was such a sense of awe about this one , &quot; notes Avnet . &quot; When I was a kid and grew_up in Brooklyn , we didn ' t have trees like this . . . a world like this to live_in . This film is literally about kids trying to build a house of their own. &quot; And that , he says , is something worth defending. *</TEXT>
