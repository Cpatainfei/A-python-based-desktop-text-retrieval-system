   <HEADLINE> OUTDOOR NOTES / RICH ROBERTS : FAULTY MEXICAN PLAN FOILS SAN DIEGO FLEET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A misguided plan to protect the threatened giant manta_rays might be why Mexico has ignored applications from San Diego ' s long-range fleet for permits to fish the Revillagigedo Islands this winter . After months of seeking a response , Bob Fletcher , president of the Sportfishing Assn . of California , said he was finally made aware of the manta_ray concerns while meeting before Christmas with government officials in Mexico_City . &quot; They have created a special protected area six miles out from each island for species that are listed as threatened or endangered , including near-shore tropical reef fishes -- one example is the Clarion angel fish -- and also the giant manta_ray , &quot; Fletcher said Tuesday . &quot; We said we couldn ' t live with staying six miles outside those islands. &quot; The four-island group is 220 miles south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas and holds the world ' s best population of yellowfin_tuna . Fletcher said the problem might have started in 1993 , when videos of Mexican gill-netters taking manta_rays were shown on TV in Mexico . Outraged environmentalists apparently persuaded the government to impose the six-mile limit -- but nobody was inclined to tell the American sportfishermen until new President Ernesto Zedillo took_office Dec . 1 . Fletcher said Mexico is continuing a process started by previous President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to develop a new sportfishing plan . A representative of the sportfishing association -- probably long-time consultant Barney Thompson , who is bilingual -- will be allowed to sit in . The deadline is June 5 , which worries Fletcher that nothing will happen before this season dissolves in the spring . Meanwhile , he hopes to return to Mexico_City next month to appeal the six-mile limit . &quot; We could make a very solid argument that we in no way impact giant manta_rays , &quot; Fletcher said . &quot; Our hook-and-line fishing_gear is not like nets . In this appeal , we also will suggest as an alternative a quarter-mile closure , or that we could stay outside 25 fathoms , which is deeper than any of those tropical fish live . Our target species are yellowfin_tuna and wahoo , and both species are in excellent health. &quot; Fletcher said that , with customers bailing_out , the long-range fleet already has lost 15 of its 43 scheduled trips to the Revillagigedos , &quot; and every day that goes_by is the potential for losing another. &quot; * Starting Sunday , a California angler can use two rods at once on lakes and reservoirs -- if he has a special $ 7.90 stamp on the back of the regular fishing_license . The purpose is to enhance catching opportunities and Department of Fish and Game revenue . &quot; Trout are often near the surface during these cold months in pursuit of shad , and anglers owning a two-rod stamp will be able to put bait on one rod and work a lure with the other to see what brings the most action , &quot; said Neil Manji , a Department of Fish and Game fishery biologist in Redding . As before , only one rod will be allowed on rivers and streams , and the daily trout limit remains at five per person . * Trevor Oudin was catching fish almost before he could walk or talk , and now he really has something to talk_about . Oudin , the 13-year-old son of Doug Oudin , the harbor master at Two Harbors on Santa Catalina Island , was_on his first fishing trip to Cabo San Lucas this month when he hooked into a 383-pound blue_marlin . Oudin , who weighs 95 pounds , fought the fish for 2 1 / 2 hours as it came_to leader three times before the line snagged on either the propeller or rudder . However , the line continued to run , so it was retrieved with a gaff hook , cut and retied onto the reel as Trevor ' s father and uncle , Dave Oudin , took_over for the next two hours until the fish came alongside for the last time and rolled belly up . Past the point of being released , it was donated to the Ponga fleet . Ten minutes after docking , Trevor , ignoring blisters and aching muscles , was catching and releasing small jack and permit fish from the pier . Briefly SLED-DOG RACING -- Snow conditions appear good for the second annual Mammoth Mushing Classic at Sierra Meadows Ranch near Mammoth Lakes Saturday and Sunday . Races start at 9:30 a.m. , weight-pulling contests at 12:30 both days . Admission is free . HUNTING -- California ' s black_bear season , initially scheduled to run until Christmas_Day , was closed Dec . 21 , when the limit of 1 # 500 was reported . The total was expected to reach about 1 # 700 before word reached hunters in the field , the Department of Fish and Game said . BOATING -- BOAT / U.S. warns boaters to be careful in January , the most dangerous month . While accidents are down because of less boating activity , statistics from 1993 show that 32 % of the accidents in January resulted in one or more fatalities , compared to 6-7 % in June , July and August . The critical factor is cold water that induces hypothermia .</TEXT>
