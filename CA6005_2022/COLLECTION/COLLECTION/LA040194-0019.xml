   <HEADLINE> NHL ROUNDUP ; SHARK LEAD OVER DUCKS IS EXTENDED TO 10 POINTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The timing is perfect for the San Jose Sharks , who won their fifth game in a row , 5-3 , over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday night in San Jose . The winning streak is a franchise record , and it has generated 10 points in the standings , exactly the number of points by which the Sharks lead the Mighty Ducks in the parade -- it can no longer be called a race with only six games to play -- to the final Western Conference spot in the playoffs . The Ducks lost , 3-2 to Edmonton in overtime . Ulf Dahlen scored for the Sharks to break a 3-3 tie_in the third_period . They had fallen_behind Toronto , 3-1 , in the second_period and won despite being outshot , 24-16 . Dahlen ' s goal came 12:01 into the final_period after Todd Elik dumped a pass to him just inside the Toronto zone . Ray Whitney added a breakaway goal at 13:33 , eluding Maple Leaf defenseman Todd Gill at the blue line and beating Felix Potvin to the glove side . Dallas 2 , Boston 2 -- Boston showed its historical bent , welcoming the past in Andy Moog and ridiculing the present in Jon Casey . Moog , traded to Dallas last June for Casey , came_home to the Boston Garden , but he stopped 27 Bruin shots for the Stars . No matter . &quot; Welcome home , Andy , &quot; the sign read , and &quot; Moooooog , &quot; the crowd said . Casey stopped 26 Dallas shots in front of the home fans . No matter . &quot; Casey ' s a Bum , &quot; the sign said . Dave Gagner and Mike Modano scored for the Stars , who set a club record for points on_the_road in a season with 41 . Steve Heinze and Glen Murray scored for Boston . Quebec 4 , Detroit 2 -- Iain Fraser had a goal and an assist in the third_period to lead the Nordiques at Detroit , where Quebec goaltender Jacques Cloutier made 39 saves in his first start since Nov . 20 . It was the Red Wings ' sixth game in March against teams that aren ' t in playoff positions and their fifth loss . Calgary 4 , Philadelphia 1 -- Theoren Fleury scored three goals for the Flames at Philadelphia . The Pacific Division-leading Flames are 4-1-1 in their last six games .
