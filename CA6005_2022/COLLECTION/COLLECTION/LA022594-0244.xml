   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; YELTSIN SHOWS HARD EDGE ON FOREIGN_POLICY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s State of the Nation speech on Thursday took a distinctly harder line on foreign_policy , promising that Russia will pursue its national interests more vigorously and is prepared to get_tough when necessary . Though the speech was crafted for domestic consumption , its assertive stance signals Moscow ' s independence from the West at a time when Russia is suffering from superpower nostalgia and wounded national pride . In the six weeks since President Clinton met with Yeltsin in Moscow in January , Russia has objected to Eastern European_countries being admitted to NATO , launched its own peace-making gambit in Bosnia and shrugged_off American outrage over the Ames espionage case . And on Wednesday , Yeltsin proposed that the leaders of France , Germany , Britain and the United States meet in Moscow to work_on a settlement of the Bosnian conflict , a strategy that would draw diplomatic focus away from NATO , to which Russia does not belong . Yeltsin rarely speaks about foreign_policy issues while at_home , but in his first address to the new Parliament on Thursday , he said Russia ' s foreign_policy has in the past been &quot; short on initiative and creativity , &quot; with Russia ' s dramatic diplomatic intervention in the Bosnian crisis an exception to this passivity . &quot; We are fond of saying that Russia is a great country . That is so . But then our foreign_policy thinking should match this high standard , &quot; Yeltsin said . Yeltsin said Russia ' s first priority is preventing global war , including a new Cold_War . &quot; That is why we fully support strengthening the program of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the latest military technologies , &quot; he said . But he pointedly added that the principle &quot; is binding on all ( nations ) and not only on Russia , as some people seem to believe. &quot; The president vowed to make no more &quot; unilateral concessions , &quot; especially on defense . He stressed the need to help Russian companies and defense_contractors market their wares abroad , to take_charge of peacekeeping on the territory of the former Soviet_Union and to defend ethnic Russians living_in the former republics . Yeltsin also made_it clear that Russia will not tolerate being ignored -- in Bosnia or elsewhere . &quot; Russia is not a guest in Europe , but a full participant in the European community , with an interest in its well-being , &quot; he said . Russian politicians hailed Yeltsin ' s speech , and foreign_policy analysts said it was &quot; high_time &quot; for Russia , preoccupied with its wrenching domestic upheavals , to reassert its international interests . Since the collapse of the totalitarian system , Russia has neither defined nor asserted its national interests , said Alexander A . Konovalov , a defense expert at Moscow ' s U.S.A.-Canada Institute . &quot; Our foreign_policy for some time has been largely based on the declaration of biblical and universal humanitarian values , &quot; Konovalov said . &quot; that ' s fine , but every country has its own national interests to pursue , and Russia is no exception. &quot; Russia ' s interests &quot; cannot always coincide with the interests of other major democracies , &quot; Konovalov said . &quot; But that is no tragedy . It ' s a normal process. &quot; Yeltsin ' s speech was short on specifics about where Russia ' s national interests begin and end . But his pledge to defend Russians living abroad was a clear message to the Baltic_states , where up_to 20 # 000 Russian troops are still stationed , and to Kazakhstan , which also has a large ethnic Russian minority . The tougher rhetoric seemed to please Parliament and could help defuse the appeal of neo-fascist lawmaker Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , who has accused Yeltsin of groveling to the West . Nikonov said relations between Washington and Moscow &quot; are already not as warm as they used to be. &quot; Whether a new chill develops , he said , will depend_on how both sides behave in Bosnia , the outcome of the spying case against CIA operations officer Aldrich Hazen Ames , and the willingness of Parliament to ratify such international treaties as START II , a new chemical weapons pact and the NATO-sponsored Partnership for Peace program that Yeltsin has endorsed . Other analysts said the Kremlin ' s more assertive mood does not necessarily mean chilly relations with the United States . &quot; The West needs a good , strong , assertive government in Russia which will control the country , prevent disintegration and be a pillar of the international community , &quot; said Viktor A . Kremenyuk , deputy director of the U.S.A.-Canada Institute .</TEXT>
