   <HEADLINE> GOP CANDIDATES FOR BEILENSON SEAT SPLIT ON GUN BAN , ABORTION PROTESTS ; FORUM : BUT THE TRIO ALSO SHOWS A GREAT_DEAL OF UNANIMITY ON SEVERAL OTHER FEDERAL ISSUES DURING A DEBATE IN WOODLAND HILLS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The same day U . S . Rep . Anthony Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills ) was voting Thursday for an assault-weapons ban and for making_it a federal crime to block access to abortion clinics , three GOP candidates seeking his job in the 24th Congressional District were splitting over how they would have voted on the same issues . But in their remarks at a candidates ' forum sponsored by United We Stand America , the Ross Perot group , GOP candidates Richard Sybert , Mark Boos Benhard and Robert Hammer also showed a great_deal of unanimity on several federal issues . All three favored term limits for congressional lawmakers , supported the repeal of language in the U . S . Constitution that automatically grants citizenship to people born in the United States of illegal immigrants , backed a balanced_budget amendment and were gravely skeptical of President Clinton ' s health_care reform plan . Such positions drew strong applause from the audience of about 100 local residents . Also joining the three at the United We Stand forum were candidates Scott Gaulke , a Democrat , John Koehler , a Libertarian , and Rhett Wooden , an independent . Beilenson , who declined to appear , saying he would not attend primary_election debates , is virtually assured of winning the Democratic nomination in the June 7 election . The Republican nomination is a tougher affair , with several relatively well-financed and active candidates in the running . In addition to the three at Thursday ' s event , Emery Shane , a realtor , and businessman Sang Korman are also in the GOP primary . Thursday ' s forum at Parkman Junior_High_School in Woodland Hills came against a backdrop of the controversial votes being cast only hours earlier in Washington , by Beilenson . Beilenson joined the House majority to support a measure to ban 19 military-style , semiautomatic weapons . The measure was approved by the narrowest of margins , 216 to 214 , meaning that a change of one vote would have killed the measure . Later in the day , Beilenson voted to make_it a federal crime to block access to abortion clinics , a measure prompted by recent anti-abortion protesters ' attempts to blockade clinics . A first-time conviction for blocking access to the clinics without violence would carry a maximum fine of $ 10 # 000 and six months in jail , a second conviction a $ 25 # 000 fine and one year in jail . Beilenson had previously backed even stiffer penalties . At Thursday ' s forum , Benhard staked out the most conservative position , telling the audience that he opposed any ban on assault weapons . &quot; People are kidding themselves if they think banning assault weapons will solve the crime problem , &quot; Benhard told a cheering crowd . Benhard also said he opposed singling_out abortion protesters for a new federal law and would thus have voted against the measure to make such protests a crime . Meanwhile , Hammer said he too would have opposed the assault weapons ban while Sybert took the opposite tack . &quot; I was impressed by the testimony of the police_chiefs ( who urged the ban ) , &quot; Sybert said . &quot; No one can feel comfortable that 14- and 15-year-olds are riding around with these weapons. &quot; On making_it a federal crime to block access to abortion clinics , Sybert said that while he was pro-choice he was &quot; concerned about discriminating against pro-life persons in the exercise of their 1st Amendment rights. &quot; Finally , Hammer , who is pro-choice but opposes federal funding of abortions , said he would support such legislation to ensure &quot; free access to the facilities. &quot; Of the three at Thursday ' s forum , Sybert has the best-financed campaign , having pumped more_than $ 400 # 000 of_his_own money into the race . The former Wilson cabinet member has also been endorsed by dozens of local Republican elected officials . Benhard , who owns a public relations firm and was an aide to former Congressman William Dannemeyer , has staked out a position as the most conservative candidate on a number of issues and recently won the support of the California Republican Assembly , a longtime conservative organization . Hammer , a banking consultant , has also shown some fund-raising ability as he has attempted to establish himself as a moderate Republican who can bring a strong business background to managing the federal_government . In balloting after the debate , United We Stand members picked Hammer as their favorite with Benhard coming_in second and Sybert tying with Wooden for third .</TEXT>
