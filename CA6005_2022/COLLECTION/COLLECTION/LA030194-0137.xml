   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; COWBOY FESTIVAL MOVES TO MELODY RANCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even an earthquake could not hamper the frontier spirit of the cowboy festival , which city officials announced Monday would move to the historic Melody Ranch Motion_Picture Studio in Newhall . The three-day Cowboy Poetry , Music and Film Festival , which begins March 25 , originally was to be held_in the Hart High_School auditorium , which was severely damaged in the Northridge quake . The city will pay $ 15 # 000 to rent the ranch studio , which was owned by singing cowboy actor Gene Autry until 1990 and has been the set of hundreds of Westerns , including films_starring Gary Cooper , Roy Rogers and John Wayne . The set burned_down when fire swept_through Placerita Canyon in 1962 , but has since been restored by brothers Renaud and Andre Veluzat , who purchased the ranch from Autry . The announcement of a new festival site came as a relief to Cecilia Burda , the city ' s special projects manager , who had faced the difficult chore of promoting an event without a location . She said the new venue actually will add an air of authenticity to Santa Clarita ' s first-ever regional event . &quot; This is perfect because it gives us the chance to show_off the Old West through the sets of the TV_shows and movies that really brought the cowboy to the American home. &quot; Although the $ 15 # 000 cost of renting the studio is considerably more_than the $ 2 # 000 that the city would have paid_for the high_school auditorium , the total cost of the event still should not exceed its $ 83 # 000 budget , said city spokeswoman Gail Foy . She noted that corporate sponsorships and ticket and merchandise sales would greatly offset the cost to the city . Tickets for the three-day festival of Western poetry , music and films range from $ 10 for a poetry pass to $ 50 for a special weekend package .</TEXT>
