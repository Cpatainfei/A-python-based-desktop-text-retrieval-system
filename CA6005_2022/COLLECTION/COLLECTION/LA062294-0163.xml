   <HEADLINE> DOLLAR PLUNGES ; MARKETS FOLLOW ; ECONOMY : CURRENCY ' S POST-WORLD WAR II LOW AGAINST YEN REVIVES INFLATION CONCERNS AND MAY PUSH FED TO RAISE INTEREST_RATES AGAIN . TRADE_DEFICIT TAKES UNEXPECTED JUMP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In another blow to world financial markets , the dollar ' s value sank on Tuesday below the psychologically key level of 100 Japanese yen , triggering a global selloff in_stocks and bonds . The dollar ' s decline to a post-World War II low against the mighty yen took Wall_Street by surprise and revived worries about higher inflation and interest_rates , the global economy ' s recovery and Americans ' living standard -- all_of which can be affected by swings in the huge but often-arcane world currency markets . &quot; It ' s just a pervasive nervousness about developments all_over the world , with inflation fears underlying it all , &quot; said Robert D . Hormats , vice_chairman of brokerage Goldman , Sachs International . The sharp drop_in the dollar ' s value is likely to pressure the Federal_Reserve_Board to raise interest_rates for a fifth time this year , perhaps as early as next month , in an attempt to support the currency . However , another increase in rates may further threaten the fragile economic recovery in California . In New York on Tuesday , the dollar ' s value fell as low as 99.5 yen from Monday ' s close of 101.9 yen , though it rebounded slightly to finish at 100.35 yen . Early today in Tokyo the dollar rose further , to 101.2 yen , as the Bank_of_Japan bought dollars and sold yen . Japan ' s economic ministers , including Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata , were to hold an emergency meeting at midday that was expected to focus_on the currency turmoil . In Tokyo , the Nikkei stock index was down 175 points to 20 # 637 at midday today , after falling 338 points on Tuesday . A rising yen could batter Japan ' s depressed economy by further raising the cost of its exports to the United States and other countries . Though the dollar has weakened in recent weeks -- from 105 yen in early June -- as the U.S. economy has shown signs of slowing and as tensions with North_Korea have flared , few experts had expected a break below 100 yen . But on Tuesday , the government ' s report that the nation ' s trade_deficit jumped 22 % to $ 8.4 billion in April , far exceeding analysts ' estimates , fueled new concerns about the U.S. economy ' s long-term trend of consuming more_than it produces . Because a nation ' s currency essentially is a gauge of investors ' underlying confidence in the economy , the selloff in the dollar reflected fears that the U.S. economy ' s expansion is not sustainable , some analysts said . Moreover , because a falling dollar can automatically boost prices of goods imported into the United States , the dive below 100 yen magnified inflation jitters that have rattled U.S. markets all year . The negative sentiment spilled into the stock_market Tuesday , where the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 33.93 points to 3 # 707.97 , bringing its loss over the past three sessions to more_than 100 points . Meanwhile , U.S. interest_rates rose broadly Tuesday on concerns that the Federal_Reserve will be forced to raise short-term rates again soon , in an attempt to defend the dollar . Higher rates tend to attract investment to a country ' s fixed-income securities , thereby strengthening its currency . The Fed , which has tightened credit four times this year to moderate the economy ' s growth and thus keep inflation at_bay , had signaled in recent weeks that it was content to leave rates alone this summer , confident that the economy was slowing . But the dollar ' s sudden collapse could force the Fed to act_as early as its July 5 policy meeting , analysts said Tuesday . Any additional Fed-induced increase in interest_rates would have widespread effects , economists say . Mortgage rates could jump again , hurting the housing market . And any general increase in rates would be especially harmful to California , which still is struggling to emerge from recession . In addition , higher U.S. interest_rates -- and a subsequent further slowdown in the U.S. economy -- would compound Europe ' s economic problems , threatening the Continent ' s nascent recovery from a very deep recession in 1993 . Some analysts , however , said they doubted that the Fed will feel compelled to defend the dollar with higher interest_rates because the dollar ' s problems are viewed_as long-term in nature . &quot; It would be very unusual for the Fed to raise rates to help the dollar , because that is a structural problem &quot; in the economy , said Marshall Acuff , investment strategist at brokerage Smith Barney in New York . The effect of a Fed rate hike &quot; would last two days , and then the speculators selling the dollar would be back at it , &quot; he said . The Fed could , however , buy dollars on the open market to help stave_off a downward spiral . Although the Fed intervened in currency markets last month to push the dollar higher -- at the U.S. Treasury ' s request -- the central_bank apparently was absent from the market Tuesday . The Clinton_Administration in recent months has sought to talk up the dollar , a reversal of what many experts viewed_as the White_House ' s previous policy of allowing the dollar to gradually decline as a way of making U.S. exports more competitive , especially in Japan . But on Tuesday , Administration officials only repeated their insistence that the economy ' s condition did not justify the dollar ' s fall , and they withheld action . Some Wall_Street experts have sought to pin the dollar ' s latest slide on what they perceive as the White_House ' s naivete on economic issues . By talking the dollar lower earlier in the year -- effectively making the currency a trade weapon against Japan -- the Administration may have set the stage for the current plunge , some investment pros say . Also , some currency traders said the weakness in the dollar reflects investors ' lack of confidence that the Administration is up_to the task of handling the political problems it faces , from North_Korea to Bosnia . Still , Lothar Klausing , an economist with the Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt , said the dollar ' s slide might prove to be an overreaction by currency speculators . Hormats , of Goldman Sachs , said the dollar ' s turbulence reflects in part the enormous growth of dollar holdings abroad . During the 1980s , about $ 170 billion flowed to foreign investors annually because of large trade_deficits . In this decade , those levels have been swollen by foreign direct investment and other factors , so that now the annual outflow is closer to $ 250 billion a year . &quot; And if foreigners start seeing that they can ' t hold those dollars at a stable currency rate , they can get nervous -- and start to sell , &quot; Hormats said . Each decline in the dollar devalues foreigners ' holdings in the United States .
