   <HEADLINE> UP TO $ 50 MILLION LOST IN HOUSING SCHEME , U.S. SAYS ; CRIME : SOUTHLAND BUSINESSMAN ACCUSED OF DIVERTING FUNDS FROM INVESTORS , FEDERAL TREASURY . HE PLEADS NOT GUILTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Developer John Goodin hoped the rushed real_estate deal he made on New Year ' s Eve 1990 would straighten_out his shaky business affairs . Instead , it became a legal quagmire that soon pushed Goodin -- and several partners -- close to financial ruin . A year and a half later , the 47-year-old father of three found a way_out . On the afternoon of June 10 , 1992 , Goodin walked into the bathroom of his Columbus home , put a 12-gauge shotgun to his face and pulled the trigger . Goodin ' s wife blames his suicide on distress over the ill-fated sale of two low-income apartment complexes in Ohio to Gary W . Lefkowitz , a mercurial Southern Californian who sold limited partnerships in low-income housing funded by federal tax_credits . &quot; It put a lot of pressure on him , &quot; said Judy Goodin . &quot; He felt guilty having got his friends involved. &quot; In May , a federal grand_jury in Minneapolis indicted Lefkowitz , a lawyer who lives_in Beverly Hills , on 45 counts of fraud , embezzlement , obstruction of justice and filing false tax_returns . Federal authorities allege that Lefkowitz , owner of Citi Equity Group in Culver City , masterminded a sophisticated scheme to divert up_to $ 50 million from dozens of developers , thousands of investors and the federal treasury to support his extravagant lifestyle . He has pleaded not_guilty and is free on $ 1-million bail . With his company in Chapter 11 bankruptcy , Lefkowitz is being represented by a public_defender and has told the court that he is contemplating insanity as a defense . Lefkowitz , 41 , declined several requests for interviews . But a review of court records involving Lefkowitz and interviews with former employees and associates lay out a story that reads like a portrait of a con_artist as a young_man . Even in Southern California ' s caldron of white-collar crime , the Lefkowitz saga -- as set_forth in the federal indictment -- stands_out as a tale of extraordinary greed . While presenting himself as a do-gooder providing shelter for the nation ' s poor , Lefkowitz lived a high life with mansions in Beverly Hills and Colorado and a stable of luxury cars and corporate jets at his call . For his 40th birthday , he threw himself a $ 500 # 000 bash on the ski slopes of Vail , Colo . Lefkowitz and his wife spent up_to $ 48 # 000 a month on artwork ; meanwhile , he lavished gifts on a girlfriend . Along the way , developers insist that he pushed them to the edge of bankruptcy , investors say he bilked them out of retirement nest_eggs , and government officials claim that he deprived hundreds of poor people of the chance to live_in affordable housing . Said one federal investigator : &quot; This guy ' s a made-for-TV movie. &quot; * Gary Wayne Lefkowitz is a product of the San Fernando Valley , where his Midwestern-bred parents migrated to raise their son and three daughters . As Lefkowitz described it to associates , his was not a happy childhood . Money came and went from the family ' s Granada Hills home with the swiftness of a Santa Ana wind . In 1979 , his father , Albert Lefkowitz , was convicted of income_tax evasion and served a year in federal prison . Young Gary rarely looked_back . But one bitter story that Lefkowitz repeatedly shared with friends was that he was given a new car by his father only to have it repossessed a_few months later . Albert Lefkowitz could not be located for comment . A graduate of Granada Hills High_School , Gary entered the University of Southern California in 1970 , earning a degree in business administration . In 1974 , he went_on to Loyola University law_school . After graduating , Lefkowitz opened a public interest law clinic in West Hollywood and had some success representing elderly tenants fighting evictions as their apartments were being converted to condominiums . He raised money for then-Gov . Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr. , creating ties to the liberal Democrat that earned Lefkowitz a two-year appointment in 1980 as a member of the California Department of Real_Estate ' s advisory commission . Despite the professional success , his personal life was a mess . By his early 30s , Lefkowitz had been married four times . His third marriage lasted just nine months . Business partnerships also were short-lived . When a former law partner sued him in 1985 , an employee testified that Lefkowitz habitually avoided process servers and &quot; doesn ' t like to pay bills unless he absolutely , positively has to. &quot; Richard Chier , a Los Angeles criminal defense_attorney who shared an office with Lefkowitz in the early ' 80s , recalls him as &quot; the crudest , rudest man I ever met. &quot; Adds Chier : &quot; He was always beating people out of things. &quot; * Just ask Edith Beck and her son Donald . In 1981 , the Becks hired Lefkowitz , a family friend , to represent them in a real_estate lawsuit . He advised Donald to turn_over four properties to his mother in case of an adverse court decision . Lefkowitz prepared and held onto four quitclaim_deeds . When the deeds later were recorded , Edith ' s name had been replaced with that of another Lefkowitz client . He also brought the Becks into a deal with several other investors , who together purchased a City of Commerce property for $ 800 # 000 -- most of it provided by the Becks . When the partners had a falling_out , the property was sold in early 1982 without the Becks ' knowledge . Edith held a $ 150 # 000 deed_of_trust on the property . But she was never paid , because someone had forged her name on a request for reconveyance held for her by Lefkowitz . A complaint was lodged against Lefkowitz with the State Bar of California . After prolonged proceedings , the State Bar Court ruled that it &quot; was not proved by clear and convincing evidence &quot; that Lefkowitz forged the documents . But the court recommended that he be suspended for a year for acts of &quot; moral turpitude and dishonesty. &quot; The Supreme Court approved the suspension in 1989 , with one justice dissenting that &quot; a more severe discipline &quot; should have been imposed . &quot; It was sad to me how he had conned these people , &quot; said Erica Tabachnick , the State Bar examiner in the case . &quot; He destroyed them , but was cavalier about it. &quot; * In 1984 , Lefkowitz opened an office in Beverly Hills and through a law partner met several successful syndicators -- individuals who form partnerships to raise money for real_estate projects . One of them was A . Bruce Rozet of Brentwood . By the late ' 80s , Rozet was the nation ' s largest operator of subsidized low-income housing , controlling 350 projects with 45 # 000 units in 40 states . A major contributor to California Democratic politicians , he often testified in Congress about low-income housing issues . Rozet became wealthy buying and managing projects subsidized by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development . But in 1990 , HUD accused him of operating slum properties and charging excessive fees . He was barred from doing business with the department for a year , though Rozet denied any wrongdoing . Lefkowitz was awed by the real_estate empire that Rozet commanded and often sought his counsel . &quot; Rozet was Gary ' s mentor , &quot; said Paul Schwartz , a former Citi Equity property manager who for a time was a close friend of Lefkowitz and later testified against him before the federal grand_jury in Minneapolis . Rozet , however , said his relationship with Lefkowitz was never intimate . &quot; A lot of people claim they have learned something from me , &quot; he said . The first successful syndications that Lefkowitz performed in 1985 were of properties owned by Rozet affiliates . But problems arose ; New Mexico regulators issued a cease-and-desist order against Lefkowitz , Citi Equity , Rozet and others for selling unregistered securities . The order was in place until 1987 . * As Lefkowitz was struggling to build Citi Equity , the bottom fell_out of the real_estate syndication business . The reason : the Tax Reform Act of 1986 , which eliminated most tax_shelters , sharply curtailing investor interest in real_estate partnerships . But Congress approved one new tax_shelter to encourage the development of affordable housing . Instead of providing budget-busting direct subsidies , the Low-Income Housing Tax_Credit grants credits to developers of affordable housing projects . The developers sell the tax_credits to investors , who use them to offset federal income_tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis . Individual investors can claim tax_credits of $ 3 # 750 to $ 9 # 900 annually -- depending_on their tax_bracket -- for 10 years . For instance , a high-income investor in the 31 % tax_bracket who makes a $ 45 # 000 investment in a qualifying low-income housing project can claim tax_credits of $ 7 # 750 yearly for a decade . Seeing an opportunity , Lefkowitz moved quickly . Initially , he scoured the country for apartment complexes to purchase and convert into low-income housing . He soon was one of the nation ' s most active low-income housing syndicators . Lefkowitz ' s enthusiasm could be contagious , his spiel convincing . Former employees say his eyes would fill with tears as he sought to convince developers and others of the need for affordable housing . &quot; He would tell them that they would be providing housing to people who otherwise might not have any , &quot; said Schwartz . &quot; They could make money and also do some good. &quot; Citi Equity adopted the slogan &quot; Good Happens. &quot; The company focused its early activity on the Midwest , particularly Minnesota and Ohio , where higher allowable monthly rents and low building costs made projects most feasible . Lefkowitz cut an impressive figure to many small-town developers . Arriving in a Learjet and wearing expensive suits , he could dazzle with his photographic memory and knowledge of real_estate , housing and finance . &quot; He was a very personable , persuasive guy , &quot; said Ohio developer Paul Bouman . &quot; He was confident , a very good salesman. &quot; Mostly he promised what builders badly needed -- financing . Lefkowitz said he had money -- a 1990 financial_statement put his net worth at $ 18 million -- and lived like he did . He and his fourth wife , Frann , moved to Beverly Hills in the mid- ' 80s , living_in a home tastefully decorated with Alex Katz paintings . They soon relocated to a mansion with marble floors in the city ' s older , more exclusive section . Regular patrons of Rodeo Drive , Lefkowitz and his wife spent more_than $ 2 million on clothing , jewelry and art at Fred Hayman , Hermes , Maxfield , Merletto and other exclusive stores , according to the federal indictment . In 1993 alone , the couple was spending as much as $ 48 # 000 a month on various art objects , according to bankruptcy court filings . Among their prized possessions was a large collection of antique kaleidoscopes . &quot; Spending_money was an obsession with him , &quot; said Wayne Laner , a former Citi Equity pilot . The company ' s fleet of aircraft grew to three , and Lefkowitz used the planes for vacations in France or skiing weekends in Colorado , where he acquired a $ 2-million mountainside home with a five-story elevator . He gave a girlfriend a $ 17 # 000 Jeep and a fur_coat , according to prosecution filings in the criminal case . And Citi Equity acquired more_than 20 cars , many of which were kept at Lefkowitz ' s disposal . He often drove a Porsche or Jaguar , his wife a Mercedes . For his 40th birthday , Frann gave him a custom-built 1993 Morgan . But the indictment alleges that Lefkowitz ' s lavish lifestyle was paid_for with funds embezzled from Citi Equity . He is accused of commingling funds of various partnerships and taking_out loans that he never intended to repay . In one civil case , Schwartz testified that Lefkowitz had boasted about having two checking_accounts . &quot; He had one called OPM , which stood_for ' other people ' s money ' and one called TMR , for ' take the money and run , ' &quot; Schwartz recounted in an interview . Citi Equity employees describe Lefkowitz as a manipulator who insisted on total control . With an explosive temper , he could be verbally and physically intimidating . He surrounded himself with employees with questionable backgrounds who asked few questions . Schwartz once was charged with forgery , though the case was dropped when he made restitution . Lefkowitz ' s most trusted aide , Laurie Egan , served jail time for heroin possession . The head of his mortgage unit was fired by a Texas thrift for fraud . Only Lefkowitz , though , had a full picture of Citi Equity ' s operations , employees said . The company ' s offices were spread_over three buildings , and there was little interaction among Citi Equity ' s small staff . &quot; Forget the right_hand not knowing what the left was doing , &quot; said one employee . &quot; The index_finger didn ' t know what the pinky was doing. &quot; * Lefkowitz built_in a decade what appeared to be an impressive real_estate empire . He was the general partner in more_than 300 limited partnerships and an officer of more_than 50 companies . He obtained tax_credits in 22 states for 100 low-income housing projects and syndicated 80 limited partnerships for those projects , raising $ 100 million from investors . Citi Equity raised an additional $ 30 million in mortgage pools that provided short-term construction financing . But federal authorities allege that the firm was built_on a mountain of deceit . Central to the scam , they allege , was Lefkowitz ' s claim that he could offer developers permanent financing . To obtain property , Lefkowitz had to convince builders that Citi Equity had permanent , or &quot; take_out , &quot; financing . Such funds are used to take builders out of projects by repaying their construction loans . Lefkowitz showed developers what purported to be financing commitment letters , primarily from Axon Associates and Jericho State_Capital Corp . The two New York firms arrange financing for investments in real_estate limited partnerships . But the indictment alleges that Axon and Jericho had an agreement with Lefkowitz that the commitments never would be exercised . The letters ' purpose , prosecutors charge , was solely to induce builders to turn their projects over to Citi Equity . An Axon official said the firm , which does not face any charges in the case , is cooperating with authorities . Officials of Jericho could not be reached for comment . The commitment letters also were used to convince brokers to sell the limited partnerships and mortgage pool units to investors , prosecutors say . Prospectuses , however , failed to disclose information about Lefkowitz ' s background , including his Bar suspension . Lefkowitz also used deception to delay closings on properties , the indictment charges , filing numerous frivolous lawsuits against developers that alleged construction defects that did not exist . * In March , 1989 , John Goodin and several partners bought 24 acres on the western edge of Sandusky , a small Ohio town on the shores of Lake Erie . They planned to build 200 units of luxury apartments . The group originally intended to keep and operate the project . But with permanent financing difficult to find and Goodin facing other financial pressures , the partners agreed to sell in 1990 . They decided that the project would be more attractive if converted to low-income housing . Goodin applied for tax_credits from the Ohio Housing Finance Agency and went looking_for a buyer . Two Southern California syndicators surfaced . First , Goodin negotiated with Michael Leone of San Diego , but their deal was never finalized . With time running_out late in 1990 -- the tax_credits would expire by year ' s end -- he turned_to Lefkowitz . On Dec . 30 , Lefkowitz flew to Columbus . He quickly agreed to buy the project and another in Delaware , Ohio . But Goodin ' s partners , Les Compson and Paul and Ray Bouman , soon learned of one peculiarity of the sale : Citi Equity would take_over the project and collect $ 80 # 000 a month in rent for several months before the closing . They had good reason to worry . The sale was not closed on schedule , and Leone filed suit alleging that he had a valid contract on the property . The suit , though later dismissed , clouded the property ' s title . Meanwhile , Goodin and his partners were personally on_the_hook for $ 5.8 million in loans . But with no access to the property and its cash flow , they could not pay the bank and their subcontractors . Unable to raise capital , the Boumans were forced to sell a Chevrolet dealership that they had owned for 20 years . They also were forced to sell another property and fight_off foreclosure on their homes . &quot; This put a big , black cloud_over our lives , &quot; said Paul Bouman . The partners sued Lefkowitz ; in early 1992 , an Ohio judge gave Citi Equity 120 days to complete the sale . The afternoon before the deadline , Goodin killed himself . The sale did not close as scheduled , and the Bouman group later filed another suit . Although the property had been occupied by tenants for two years , Lefkowitz replied that he did not complete the purchase because the property was shoddy . &quot; What they built is a piece of junk and that ' s the problem , &quot; Lefkowitz testified in a deposition in January . But in his deposition , Schwartz said that claim was just a ruse by Lefkowitz to delay closing because he lacked financing . &quot; Mr. Lefkowitz was proud_of the property , &quot; Schwartz testified . &quot; He kept referring to it as a brochure property -- to take a picture of it , put it on a brochure. &quot; In March , an Erie County jury ruled_in favor of the Boumans , awarding them a $ 7.2-million judgment against Citi Equity and Lefkowitz . They still are trying to collect ; Citi Equity was forced into bankruptcy reorganization the day after Lefkowitz ' s indictment . * When an FBI_agent contacted Paul Bouman in May , 1993 , the developer learned that he was not alone in fighting Lefkowitz . According to Bouman , the agent told him that Citi Equity had left a trail of ruined developers across the country . Roger Johnson , owner of Citadel Construction of Spokane , Wash. , was not paid_for work_on projects in Spokane and Boise , Idaho . The company recently won a $ 2-million award from Citi Equity in arbitration hearings -- an award that the firm hopes to collect by foreclosing on the projects . &quot; Lefkowitz came_close to driving Citadel out of business , &quot; said the firm ' s attorney , Lyn Rassmussen . In Elk River , Minn. , developer John Welcht built and sold the 51-unit Park Pointe Apartments to Citi Equity , but despite a court judgment , he never collected the $ 1.3 million that he was owed on the sale . Citi Equity avoided foreclosure on the project by putting its operating limited partnership in bankruptcy reorganization . In all , 21 Citi Equity projects have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy . All together , about 25 properties that Lefkowitz syndicated were not completed , according to bankruptcy court records . In Maumee , Ohio , a suburb of Toledo , developer Ken Minichiello said he boarded_up a project that was 80 % complete because Citi Equity owed him $ 3 million . &quot; We are in a very tenuous situation , &quot; said Minichiello , owner of Commonwealth Construction . &quot; I could be forced into bankruptcy. &quot; The stalled project means that 160 needy Toledo-area families are being denied affordable housing in an area where several thousand are_on waiting lists for public housing or subsidized rental units . &quot; The demand for low-income housing is overwhelming , &quot; said Donald Troendle , executive_director of the Lucas ( Co. ) Metropolitan Housing Authority . Investors in the Maumee project also are in jeopardy . The indictment alleges that Lefkowitz improperly dispensed tax_credits before the project was finished . An Internal Revenue Service spokesman said investors could be forced to repay any credits taken , along with interest and penalties . Barbara Batman , a retired piano_teacher from Hudson , Ohio , invested $ 60 # 000 in three Citi Equity projects . Interest payments on all three projects stopped in March . While Batman ' s financial security is not dependent_on these investments , their loss would be painful . &quot; I ' m hoping it will work_out all_right , &quot; she said . &quot; I don ' t like to give my money away. &quot; The First Presbyterian_Church in Mankato , Minn. , invested $ 78 # 000 from the sale of a parsonage in three Lefkowitz developments . A church_member who was a broker for a Minneapolis securities firm recommended the investment . Pastor Steve Minnema fears that a $ 50 # 000 investment in a part-finished project is lost because Citi Equity never filed the mortgage_deed securing the investment . &quot; We were assured it was a safe investment , &quot; said Minnema . &quot; We felt we were doing some good , putting it in low-income housing. &quot; The Alleged Lefkowitz Scheme The 45-count federal indictment against Gary W . Lefkowitz , owner and president of Citi Equity Group , alleges that he used a complex scheme to illegally divert up_to $ 50 million from developers , investors and the U.S._government for his own personal and business use . Here is how the scheme allegedly worked : THE DEVELOPERS * Lefkowitz entered agreements to acquire apartment complexes or to have developers build projects that were converted to low-income housing . The projects would be partly financed using federal tax_credits obtained from state housing agencies . * The sales contracts called_for closings six months or more from the date of the purchase_agreements . Contracts typically included &quot; benefit and burden &quot; clauses that allowed Citi Equity to take_over management and collect rents before the closings . * Lefkowitz induced developers to sell projects by fraudulently representing that the permanent financing was in place . He produced bogus commitment letters for permanent financing . * Closings were often delayed because of a lack of financing . Lefkowitz filed &quot; frivolous lawsuits &quot; against developers that said construction defects existed that prevented completion of the sales . He presented phony letters saying financing was being withdrawn because of shoddy construction . * When judgments were issued against him or foreclosure actions begun , he placed projects in bankruptcy , further frustrating developers ' efforts to collect debts . Twenty-one projects are in bankruptcy . * Lefkowitz improperly transferred funds from profitable to unprofitable projects , and diverted money to pay_for personal_expenses . The diversions meant that some developers were not paid and projects not completed . THE INVESTORS * Citi Equity raised about $ 100 million from investors in more_than 80 limited partnerships to purchase and develop more_than 100 low-income housing projects . Lefkowitz also obtained $ 30 million from investors in mortgage pools that provided short-term construction financing for the projects . About 7 # 000 individuals nationwide invested money in Citi Equity properties . * Lefkowitz recruited about 100 securities brokers and dealers nationwide to sell his limited partnerships and mortgage investments . He misrepresented to the brokers how the partnership and mortgage funds would be used . * He violated his fiduciary_duty as general partner by embezzling partnership funds and diverting them for personal use . From 1989 to 1993 , Lefkowitz spent $ 4.2 million in partnership and mortgage funds on clothes , jewelry and his homes . He misrepresented the diverted funds as loans . * Funds were transferred from profitable partnerships to unprofitable ones at Lefkowitz ' s direction . As a result , some projects were not built and tax_credits sold to investors rescinded . * Lefkowitz violated mortgage loan agreements by using investor funds to pay_for personal and business_expenses . In some cases , he failed to record mortgage_deeds , providing investors no security in case of default . * In disclosure statements to investors , he failed to provide vital information , including his 1989 Bar suspension . He also misrepresented his background to brokers and financiers . THE GOVERNMENT * Lefkowitz filed tax_credit applications in at least five states that falsely said a New York nonprofit group was a general partner in Citi Equity-sponsored partnerships . States set_aside certain tax_credits for nonprofit groups . As a result , $ 8 million in tax_credits were improperly reserved for Citi Equity . * Lefkowitz falsely presented dates that properties were placed in_service to claim tax_credits not awarded . He directed false partnership tax_returns to be prepared . City Equity thus obtained $ 5 million in tax_credits in at least eight states . * Lefkowitz improperly claimed $ 3 million in tax_credits that Citi Equity did not own . * He fraudulently classified as loans millions of dollars in compensation not reported as income on his federal personal_income tax_returns .
