   <HEADLINE> GRAND ILLUSIONS ; HANDMADE CARNEVALE MASKS ARE MODESTLY PRICED COLLECTORS ' ITEMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I ' m standing in La Bottega dei Mascareri , a tiny mask-making studio in the shadow of Venice ' s Rialto Bridge . The proprietor , Sergio Boldrin , is chatting amiably with customers as he applies a wash of white tempera to a cartapesta ( papier-mache ) face that will , by week ' s end , join the staggering cavalcade of creatures looking down at me from walls , shelves and cases . High above , a gold-faced and green-haired Medusa hangs just far enough away that I feel safe from her glare . A row of black_and_white Jokers gazes pleasantly at the crescent moons , gilt unicorns and elaborately coiffed , resplendent ladies across the way . Brightly painted commedia dell ' arte characters ( Pantaloon , Harlequin and company ) parade across the shelf to my left , providing an illustrated history of the well-known Italian masked comedy from which so many of the popular masks are derived . Every surface in the shop -- less than 10 feet square -- is taken_up with finished products or tools of the trade : stacks of paper , glue pots , a variety of paintbrushes and watercolors . There are an estimated 200 shops selling masks in Venice but only about 15 mask-makers use the traditional techniques . Of the 10 or so mask artists and , perhaps , 100 shops I have visited , there are three that I enjoy revisiting because of the beauty of their work , their reasonable prices and because the mask-makers seem to like to discuss their work , endowing me , for my efforts , with an education , as well as a mask . Fortunately , I speak Italian but there almost always seems to be someone in each of the shops who speaks English . Though I am here in the fall of 1993 and the annual carnevale is still four months away -- this year , Feb . 5-15 -- production is already in high_gear . For a Venetian , the mask-maker assumes prime importance as February blows in and brings carnevale ( carnival ) with it . Yet for the average tourist -- and especially for a devotee of the art like me -- mask shopping is a year-round delight . When I leave La Bottega dei Mascareri , I ' ll catch a vaporetto and cruise to the Ca ' Rezzonico stop for a visit to Ca ' Macana , another of my favorite mask-making workshops . After that I will probably take the 20-minute stroll through the tiny alleys near Campo San Polo to another shop -- the endlessly fascinating Tragicomica , where the selection of fine handiwork is so overwhelming that I sometimes spend half the afternoon trying to make a selection . For now , I look_around La Bottega dei Mascareri as Boldrin holds forth in his charming and knowledgeable way , his paintbrush in constant motion as he speaks , and I try to decide which mask to buy . I finally settle_on one of the commedia figures : Boldrin insists that I choose Pantaloon , for &quot; he is one of the most important characters. &quot; The character -- a pompous , beak-nosed merchant , clad in the pantaloons that got their name from him -- will soon join his cohorts on my wall at_home . . . relics of past visits to Venice and the Bottega : Coviello , dancing boldly , his cape billowing from outstretched arms , and Zanni , the servant / clown ( and origin of the word zany ) , whose mischievous gaze and feathered turban are a delightful contrast to Pantaloon ' s vain attempt at dignity . I have a great fondness for these three particular masks that show the entire costumed character portrayed in colorful relief across their faces , but they ' re certainly not alone on the wall of my New York apartment . In fact , as a result of the four trips I ' ve made to Venice in as_many years , my living room has begun to take_on the look of a carnevale outpost . There ' s the mask of the round-faced woman I bought_in Ca ' Macana four years ago , a $ 25 wonder almost a foot in diameter . Bold flowers cascade over the slices of yellow , red , pink and blue that intersect across her hair ; her crimson lips are outlined in gold , while silver sequins trace the contours of her almond eyes . A delicate orange , gold and black butterfly -- elegant far beyond its $ 25 price_tag -- floats above a hook-nosed , stunningly three-dimensional Pulcinella I picked_up at Tragicomica two years ago for $ 40 . A graceful silver-faced Persian lady , swathed in a cloud of pink , glances up at a psychedelic sunburst from which dangle thick black ribbons ( both under $ 30 ) . While none of my masks set me back more_than $ 40 , and some purchased last fall were as little as $ 12 , a mask-lover with boundless imagination and limitless funds could easily spend a_hundred dollars , or several hundred , for a custom-designed creation . I ' m certainly not alone in my admiration for ( and acquisition of ) these uniquely Venetian products . The masks are the products of an artistic heritage that has prospered for centuries . &quot; Only papier-mache in Venice is the real mask , &quot; Boldrin says . The craftsperson creates art in the time-honored manner , shaping the glue and paper mixture in a clay mold before giving it its tempera wash , watercolor embellishment and final sealing coat of hot wax . The technique has survived for centuries and achieved great expression in the commedia dell ' arte , which thrived for 200 years , beginning in the 16th Century . Many February revelers still cloak themselves in the garb of the 400-year-old characters , whose names evoke a colorful world of comedic tradition : Brighella , Pulcinella , Arlecchino , Capitano , Pantaloon , Balanzone . . . . But disguise flourished even after the commedia declined and the theater began to abandon masks for a greater realism . It was at this time , in the mid-to-late 1700s , that the annual pre-Lenten carnival reached its height , drawing incognito revelers from all regions . For the merchant frequenting Venice ' s ubiquitous gambling_dens , or the lawmaker slipping_off to a nocturnal liaison , the protection of the tricorno ( three-cornered hat ) , tabarro ( cape ) and above all , the cloaking bautta ( mask ) was indispensable . Modern-day visitors can imagine the mask-maker of yesteryear , when Venice was the party capital of Europe and its licentious carnevale a six-month affair , culminating , as it does today , with Fat_Tuesday , the last_day before Lent . The 18th-Century fetes began in October and featured sword_dances , bear-baitings , beheadings of bulls and pigs , immense human pyramids , flower-bearing tightrope walkers and , in 1751 , the sensational presentation of the first live rhinoceros to appear in Venice . So famous was the event that Pietro Longhi painted a rendering of the rhino presentation , which now hangs_in the Museo del Settecento Veneziano in Ca ' Rezzonico ( although it is_on loan to the Museo Correr through April 4 ) . Today ' s carnevale was revived in the early 1980s by the local tourist board , which -- after an absence of any official celebration for nearly 200 years -- embraced the smaller parties that had always occurred and elaborated on them with a program of events . Though it is perhaps less known in North_America than carnivals in New Orleans or Rio , Venice ' s carnevale attracts more_than 100 # 000 people -- many of them Europeans -- according to official estimates . In the weeks just before Lent , the city is turned_over to revelry as locals and visitors fill the town , clad in outrageous costumes and luxuriant masks . Dances , competitions , masked balls , theatrical presentations and other spectacles are presented day and night , though the real delights lie_in the spontaneous and free-wheeling displays by masked celebrators on every corner . The idea of disguise still appeals , and the range of possibilities is unlimited , as I realize on my annual pilgrimage to Ca ' Macana , a lively workshop run_by Carlo Brassesco who , with his partner , Mario , employs about 10 young artisans year-round for the making of masks . Several craftspeople are always at_work in the shop ' s two rooms , and the merchandise is as varied as the prices . The simple masks in white , black and red run as little as $ 12 , with most pieces in the vast inventory between $ 30 and $ 50 . Brassesco describes with relish the wide selection : &quot; All kinds of masks , large and small , theatrical masks , traditional carnival masks , styles popular in the Middle_Ages , and also masks of fantasia . We can make anything to order. &quot; The shop hums with the bustle of the young artists , and it ' s fun to whisk_away a newly dry piece that has just been placed on the shelf . At Tragicomica , the affable and accomplished Gualtiero Dall ' Osto creates not only masks but complete costumes , as well . &quot; Historical , traditional , fantasy masks , &quot; Dall ' Osto recites the litany with infectious enthusiasm , as a stunning parade of noblemen , grand ladies , zodiac-inspired figures and mythical beasts nod their mute approval , &quot; la bautta , la dama , commedia characters , masks with feathers , any individual idea that a person wants to present. &quot; Shall I choose a simple , white bautta ( $ 15 ) , or a jazzier gold-leafed version of this traditional mask ( $ 40 ) ? Maybe I ' ll impersonate the pompous Dottore or the mustachioed braggart Capitano . Like most of Dall ' Osto ' s lovingly re-created commedia masks , these range from $ 30 to $ 55 . Visiting Tragicomica ' s studios ( there are now two ) puts me in the company of such illustrious clients as Venice ' s opera_house La Fenice and famed Belgian choreographer Maurice Bejart . For me , the sign_in Tragicomica ' s window says it as well as the scowling , grinning , plumed and florid faces that peer out from the shop . Fabbrica Trasformazioni , it ' s called : &quot; Factory of Transformations. &quot; GUIDEBOOK Finding Mask-Makers La Bottega dei Mascareri , San Polo 80 , a_few steps from the Rialto Bridge ; in Venice , telephone 522-3857 .
