   <HEADLINE> THE JURY IS BACK ; A MURDER CASE INVOLVING TWO GYPSIES TESTS THE WATERS OF CIVIL LIBERTIES IN RUSSIA , WHERE JURIES HAVE BEEN BANNED FOR 75 YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A train pulls_out of Moscow ' s Paveletsky Station in a swirl of snow and steam . It is a wintry afternoon , Election_Day for Russia ' s new Parliament . Settling into his overnight compartment , Sergei Pashin , a lawyer on President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s legal team , stows his fur_hat , puts_on his slippers and makes room for his traveling companions -- boxes full of courtroom computer equipment . Pashin has already voted , for the &quot; Russia ' s Choice &quot; slate that supports radical reform . Now he ' s headed for Saratov , a city on the Volga_River about 450 miles and 18 hours away . A team traveling with Pashin from the American Bar Assn. ' s Moscow office debates the best way to guard the boxes , which spill_over into the group ' s sleeping quarters . Pashin picks_up his book , a Russian edition of &quot; The Name of the Rose. &quot; Later he will turn_to his other reading material : Criminal Case No . 6391 . Scholarly , soft-spoken and barely into his 30s , Pashin heads the reform unit of Russia ' s State Legal Agency , which works_at the president ' s behest . His job , he says , is &quot; to sell new ideas to the public. &quot; The one taking him on this trip is borrowed from Russia ' s pre-Revolutionary days : trial by jury . Pashin is Russia ' s chief crusader for jury trial , and his message is simple : True democracy isn ' t possible without criminal justice . And after decades of abuse , criminal justice isn ' t possible without juries . Pashin also likes to say that jury duty is a way to help raise the low level of legal awareness , &quot; a way to help turn people into citizens. &quot; It ' s a tough sell in today ' s Russia , where crime is sharply up and liberal reform is generally beating_a_retreat . Newspapers are packed with stories about Mafia schemes , murdered bankers and street brawls that turn_into shootouts -- not exactly the perfect time for citizens to be learning about the link between democracy and civil_liberties for defendants . But thanks to Pashin ' s quiet persistence , the jury project is still on track . By the time the train pulls into Saratov the next day , the election tallies are showing a trend . Russia ' s new State Duma will be dominated by conservatives , Communists and the ultranationalists led by Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , a lawyer who has suggested on-the-spot death sentences for suspected organized-crime kingpins . For Pashin , the Dec . 12 election news isn ' t good , but the timing is significant . The criminal matter in his briefcase will come_to Saratov ' s court in a_few days . &quot; So , while the election is deciding who will take what seat at the top , &quot; he says , &quot; down below , a real event is happening -- a demonstration of adherence to a democratic ideal. &quot; Russia ' s first jury trial in more_than 75 years . Judge : &quot; State your full name. &quot; Defendant : &quot; Artur Martynov. &quot; Judge : &quot; Date of birth ? &quot; Defendant : &quot; 25 of April , 1972. &quot; Judge : &quot; Nationality ? &quot; Defendant : &quot; Gypsy. &quot; Judge : &quot; Criminal_record ? &quot; Defendant : &quot; None. &quot; In a third-floor courtroom of the Saratov Regional Court , Artur Martynov and his brother Alexander rise to hear Chief Judge Alexander Galkin read the charges against them . Around midnight on Jan . 25 , 1993 , the indictment says , the brothers wantonly murdered three acquaintances after a night of heavy drinking and card-playing . The motive : robbery . The weapon : an ax handle . If convicted , the two face_up to 15 years in prison or even the death_penalty . The violence erupted in Artur ' s rented shack in the dreary factory town of Engels , across the river from Saratov . The 21-year-old Artur is pleading innocent . Alexander , 23 , admits using the ax handle , but only in self-defense . Both deny robbing the victims , who , they say , threatened them with deadly force . Pale and slight , with dark , close-cropped hair , the two have spent the past year behind bars . Normally , they ' d be placed in a metal cage during the trial , but in deference to the jury , the cage has been removed . By Russian standards , in fact , the renovated courtroom is elegant : freshly paneled and painted , with a new jury_box and rows of public seating . The Russian tricolor hangs_on the wall behind Galkin , who is wearing , for the first time , a judicial robe . When the Martynovs were arrested , juries didn ' t exist in Russia . But by the time prosecutors were ready to go_to trial , Pashin and company had pushed their jury bill through the old Russian Parliament . The law , which took_effect last November , says that felony defendants in nine of Russia ' s 88 oblasts , or regions , from suburban Moscow to Siberia , can opt_for jury trial over the usual judge tribunal . Informed in jail of his new right , Artur Martynov immediately decided that with a jury , he had &quot; a chance. &quot; His court-appointed lawyer , Svetlana Romanova , tried to talk him out of it . &quot; I said , ' There ' s a certain risk ; it ' ll be the first jury trial , and it ' s your case , ' &quot; she recalls . There was also the danger of drawing jurors who disliked Gypsies . But the Martynovs computed the odds differently . Barely literate ( Artur signed his pretrial statements with an X ) , they easily grasped what their fate would be in a traditional court before a judge and two &quot; people ' s assessors. &quot; Defendants call the lay assessors &quot; nodders &quot; because they almost always vote with the judge , who , more_than 99 % of the time , issues a guilty verdict . To prepare_for the case , Romanova and Vera Afanasyeva , Alexander ' s lawyer , met with their clients a_few times . But they didn ' t investigate the events surrounding the killings or interview anyone on the court ' s witness list . Those are the prosecutor ' s exclusive_rights . &quot; Russian defense_attorneys don ' t know how to investigate a case ; they ' ve been prohibited from doing_it , &quot; says Stephen Thaman , a former Oakland public_defender who now runs the ABA program to aid jury trial in Russia . &quot; In the past , some have even been arrested for tampering with witnesses for interviewing them. &quot; The jury ensures an independent verdict , but it hasn ' t changed any of this . Nor will it alter the trial ' s non-adversarial nature , which allows the court wide latitude with witnesses . &quot; You have the right . . . , &quot; Galkin begins , addressing the defendants in a speech he knows by heart after 20 years on the bench . He tells the Martynovs that they can personally question witnesses and object to motions . So can the victims ' survivors , who sit near the prosecutor . The judge then turns_to the potential jurors who fill the courtroom ' s first four rows . The 30 people have been randomly chosen from local voting lists . ( The U.S.-provided computer gear lugged from Moscow is meant to expedite that. ) Galkin thanks them for coming , adding that they will be paid ( about $ 2.50 a day ) . &quot; Today is a historic event in the life of Russia , the rebirth of jury trial , &quot; he says . &quot; I understand your anxiety . I ' m anxious myself. &quot; Actually , Galkin is poised and assured . He has been studying up_on jury trials since returning from a Harvard_University jury seminar a year earlier , though he likes to tell reporters that his know-how comes from watching courtroom scenes on &quot; Santa Barbara &quot; reruns . Voir dire of the jurors is next , though it doesn ' t reveal much about the panel . Even the prosecutor ' s telling question -- &quot; Are any of you not happy with the work of the prosecutor ' s office or the court because you think your rights have been violated ? &quot; -- fails to elicit a raised hand . Ninety minutes into the trial , Elizabeta Dunayevskaya , a 45-year-old piano_teacher , becomes Russia ' s first modern juror . When the jury_box is_full , Galkin administers the oath . One by one , the nine women and three men stand and say , &quot; I swear. &quot; * Juries first appeared in Russia in 1864 , as part of the Great Legal Reforms of Czar Alexander II , who liberated the serfs three years earlier . Then , as now , juries were phased_in gradually . Then , as now , potential jurors had to be 25 to 70 years old and free_of criminal charges . In fact , the new jury law closely resembles its 19th-Century predecessor . Jury trial flourished during the next 50 years , &quot; and between 1864 and 1917 , we had a whole constellation of brilliant defense_lawyers , &quot; says Alexei Galoganov , a prominent Moscow lawyer . In two famous trials , one near the beginning of this great experiment and one at the end , juries handed_down acquittals that flew in the face of the czar ' s authority . In 1878 , a jury cleared Vera Zasulich , a young radical who admitted taking a shot at St . Petersburg ' s governor . And in 1913 , a Kiev jury made_up mostly of uneducated peasants acquitted a Jewish merchant , Mendel Beilis , of ritually murdering a Christian child -- a charge trumped_up by the anti-Semitic Black Hundreds group . But the Bolsheviks banned jury trial as &quot; bourgeois &quot; shortly after taking power in 1917 . Instead , they set_up the courts that essentially survive today . Once controlled by the Communist_Party , most judges today remain rubber_stamps for prosecutors . &quot; Why would a defense_lawyer spend his talent and ardor on the judge and those assessors ? &quot; asks Galoganov . &quot; He knows no one is listening . The judge doesn ' t listen , because he ' s busy putting_down the verdict. &quot; The move to bring_back the jury began in 1991 , when Russia was still part of the Soviet_Union . &quot; The Concept of Judicial Reform &quot; was a clarion call issued by the old Russian Parliament ' s Legal Reform subcommittee , a hotbed of liberal thinking in the Mikhail Gorbachev years . Astonishingly frank , the subcommittee ' s document described Russia ' s courts as &quot; inherited from a totalitarian regime , &quot; &quot; merciless &quot; and as a place where prosecutors won unearned convictions with &quot; mediocre or even bad &quot; investigations . It recommended the return of jury trials . Pashin was a committee consultant at the time and wrote part of the document . For that , at the age of 29 , he was awarded the title of Honored Lawyer of the Russian Federation -- the youngest ever to receive it . That same year , he drafted the law that created Russia ' s Constitutional Court . ( For that he got a bonus of two months ' pay . A new father at the time , he bought a washing machine. ) He joined Yeltsin ' s State Legal Agency when it was established in 1992 to study legal issues . Among the reforms he pushed_through was a long-overdue law on habeas_corpus , which allows arrestees to appeal their detentions through the courts . Then he worked_on the jury bill . &quot; Pashin ' s very bright , very quick-witted , &quot; says Valery Rudnev , a leading legal writer for the daily Izvestia , who calls the agency &quot; a mighty mobile machine for reforms. &quot; Pashin studied jury trial at Moscow State University Law_School , where he took courses called &quot; Bourgeois Public_Law &quot; and &quot; The Reactionary Substance of the Bourgeois Criminal Process. &quot; The classes often taught the concepts -- presumption of innocence and trial by jury -- that they were meant to criticize . &quot; There were layers of text , and we were skilled at taking them apart , &quot; Pashin says , adding that for students , &quot; some things were just ritualistic , like uttering a prayer . We ' d say , ' The capitalists deluded their people with the help of their reactionary criminal process. ' And then we could go_on with the discussion. &quot; Other Russian reformers besides Pashin have worked to bring_back the jury , but by now , jury trial is linked to Pashin ' s name . &quot; He ' s the real gray_matter behind the project , &quot; says the ABA ' s Thaman . Political savvy was another matter . Pashin twice failed to pass the jury bill through the old Parliament last year , largely because of fierce opposition from Russia ' s then-Chief Prosecutor , Valentin Stepankov . From the dais , Stepankov pronounced the idea &quot; foreign &quot; and the work of &quot; armchair legal scientists. &quot; One of Pashin ' s colleagues in Parliament , Mikhail Paleev , helped to horse-trade with Stepankov ' s office to reach a compromise bill . Though it kept the crucial new preliminary hearing to exclude any illegal evidence at the trial , it retained many familiar features of the old court system . &quot; It ' s not going_to work , &quot; predicts Izvestia ' s Rudnev . &quot; Personally , I am in_love with the idea of jury trial . But we are trying to squeeze the jury into the framework of the former Soviet court procedure. &quot; Pashin prefers to think_of it as merely a first_step . &quot; The new law , &quot; he says , &quot; belongs_to the transitional period. &quot; After the law passed in Parliament last July , Pashin stepped_up his own training sessions at the Russian Legal Academy , a brushup college run_by the Justice Ministry . His classes stretched into the fall and continued through October ' s bloody White_House uprising and the crackdown that followed . At mock trial after mock trial , he coached hundreds of judges and lawyers through the new jury trial procedure . Not surprisingly , their skills were pretty appalling . ( A devoted viewer of &quot; L.A. Law &quot; probably could have mustered more poise. ) &quot; It ' s very new ; I feel_like an idiot , &quot; a longtime defense_lawyer complained , grappling with the notions of excluded evidence , juror selection and the simple act of leaving his chair to question a witness . In November , officials began scrambling as the jury law went_into effect in the first five regions involved -- suburban Moscow , Ivanov , Ryazan , Saratov and Stavropol ( Moscow and St . Petersburg are excluded for now , because their chief judges haven ' t as yet supported jury trial ) . The Justice Ministry had to intervene in Ryazan when reports filtered back that the juries were being handpicked by the court . Saratov , however , was ready . By mid-November , its court put the first jury trial on the calendar for Dec . 15 and assigned the case to its chief judge , Alexander Galkin . * With the jury in the box , Judge Galkin delivers an eloquent discourse on presumption of innocence , the nature of evidence and jurors ' responsibilities . He has adapted much of this from a jury trial Bench Book being prepared by the ABA and a team of Russian scholars . When he finishes , prosecutor Vyacheslav Simshin , wearing the quasi-military blue uniform of his profession , rises to elaborate on the indictment . Simshin has been practicing his speeches for weeks and rereading his Dale Carnegie self-help books . Standing squarely in front of the jurors , he maintains that on the night of Jan . 25 , 1993 , the Martynovs planned to rob and murder their three drinking buddies . The Martynovs struck them with the ax handle , he says , and &quot; with exceptional cruelty &quot; finished the job by stomping on the fallen men . The two then grabbed a denim jacket , a mink hat , a gold chain and other items altogether worth about 40 # 000 rubles , roughly $ 60 at the time . Finally , Simshin says , Alexander tried to set the victims aflame . Simshin must prove exceptional cruelty -- stomping and burning -- as well as the intended robbery , to get a conviction on the aggravated murder_charges . Seated near the jury , the victims ' survivors sob . The jurors remain impassive . The defendants testify that the three men attacked them for their privatization investment vouchers and some jewelry . &quot; One of them said , ' I ' m such a dangerous person in Engels , I ' ll burn your house , ' &quot; Artur testifies . At the time , Artur was so drunk he was passing_out on the couch , the brothers testify . Alexander thought the men were trying to strangle Artur , and he struck_out with the ax handle . The men fell , but were still alive . Alexander dragged Artur out of the house , and the brothers fled . There are problems for the Martynovs with this version . For one thing , at the preliminary hearing , evidence that could have helped them was ruled inadmissible . Another friend was with them that night -- a man , they say , who might have gone_back into the house to kill and burn the victims . But this witness was deemed too &quot; mentally_ill &quot; to testify . ( After the trial , defense_attorney Romanova reflects that perhaps she should have opposed the exclusion. ) For another , the Martynovs told a different story when they were arrested . Artur initially confessed to attacking the victims , but now he says he was only trying to take_on his brother ' s responsibility . Alexander confessed to setting the fires -- because police beat him , he maintains . The jury must decide which version to believe . As prosecutor , Simshin gets first crack at the defendants . &quot; How did you make money ? &quot; he begins . Artur : How do people live now ? I was unloading things in the railway_station . Simshin : Why do you have no permanent place of employment ? Artur : Nobody was hiring me . Where should I go ? Simshin : What was your brother Alexander doing_in Engels ? Artur : He just came_to visit me . Simshin : Were there times when you drank together ? Artur : When I had the chance . Simshin : When did your wife leave ? What was the reason ? Artur : I drank at her sister ' s birthday_party and she quarreled with me . Not a quarrel , she just decided to leave me . Simshin : Were there occasions when you used violence toward her ? Artur : ( Silence ) . Simshin : Did you beat your wife ? Artur : Well , sometimes . Maybe slap her a little bit . Simshin ' s initial salvo is aimed at establishing the defendant ' s poor character . Then he asks the brothers -- and a string of witnesses -- to describe the boots , jeans and jackets they were wearing as they fled Engels . He hopes this will corroborate the circumstantial case assembled by investigators : that robbery was the motive for the alleged crime . But the testimony doesn ' t support this allegation . Returning to his earlier strategy , he calls an Engels resident as a witness and asks : &quot; Are these the people who live next door to you ? &quot; After some shrugging and peering at the Martynovs ( Gypsies &quot; all look alike , &quot; the neighbor complains ) , the man says yes . &quot; And how did they behave ? &quot; Simshin asks . The witness answers this one immediately . &quot; They behaved , &quot; he says , &quot; like Gypsies. &quot; Judge Galkin adjourns for the day . JUDGE : ARTUR MARTYNOV , please explain where you gave truthful testimony . Artur : Here in the courtroom . Judge : Why did you give other testimony at the time of the preliminary investigation ? Artur : I wanted to help my brother . But first they beat me , made me sign my first testimony -- I didn ' t sign , I just put a cross there . Simshin : You had pressure from the police or investigators ? Artur : When I started telling the truth , they didn ' t believe me . They started beating me , saying , &quot; Tell us the truth. &quot; Simshin : You told someone ? A doctor or nurse ? Artur : There isn ' t any treatment there . They treat you like a dog . Go there at night sometime , you ' ll hear people crying . Please explain , where could I complain ? Trying to point_out that the Martynovs could be lying_in court , Simshin only elicits this potentially damaging testimony ( which jurors later say they believed . Coerced confessions , after all , are part of Communism ' s legacy ) . Simshin : Why did you give testimony at the preliminary investigation that you burned the house ? Alexander : Because I was scared . The police brought me to a little yard , they blindfolded me and asked me to run . I refused . They started beating me , made me kneel , told me to crawl and they were firing shots . I gave this wrong testimony so they would stop . Simshin calls more witnesses to testify about what the Martynovs were wearing after that night of violence . But they say the two were dressed as poorly as usual and that they had no extra money or jewels . The police who arrested the Martynovs can ' t recall anything about their jeans or boots . Simshin ' s forensic evidence is no clearer . Tests conducted on traces of blood found on the defendants ' clothing are not inconsistent with his theory that blood burst from the victims as they were stomped on . But defense_attorneys , gaining confidence as the trial progresses , point_out that the tests are not conclusive , either . Simshin then reads aloud a pretrial report on the Martynovs ' poor &quot; character &quot; -- their drinking and divorces . Romanova and Afanasyeva counter with a reading of the victims ' past convictions for violent crimes . Finally , out of ammunition , Simshin makes a dramatic motion . In light of the shoddy investigation , he moves to lower the charges . &quot; The materials were not compiled in the right way , &quot; he says . He will drop the robbery and &quot; wanton &quot; murder_charges altogether . ( The victims ' relatives , who might have objected at this point , were not in court . They stopped coming_after the first day. ) The new indictment accuses Artur of killing just one man , and Alexander of the murder of the other two , &quot; while exceeding the limits of necessary self-defense. &quot; The possible punishment : work-camp sentences of up_to 10 years . Closing arguments the next day , Judge Galkin says , will be based on the softened indictment . Out in the corridor , Pashin looks extremely pleased . Is he certain that Simshin ' s hand was forced by the presence of the jury ? &quot; I ' m completely sure , &quot; he says . * &quot; Distinguished jurors , an investigator restores a picture piece by piece , &quot; Simshin says . &quot; It ' s like when a little boy takes sugar from the jar without his mother ' s permission . The next day , he learns that his mother knew . How ? Because his mother was washing the floor carefully , and found the tiny grains . . . . &quot; The jury hears closing arguments for about an hour . By now , both sides are wielding the time-honored courtroom weapons : folksy wisdom , patriotism , platitudes about the simple life of poor people . Simshin ' s sugar story comes not from his Dale Carnegie book , but from a textbook for foreign lawyers written by William Burnham , a specialist in Russian court reform at Wayne State University Law_School in Michigan . ( An excerpt in Russian has been floating around legal circles. ) &quot; It ' s well-known , that sugar_bowl story , &quot; laughs Burnham , an ABA observer in Saratov . &quot; I first heard it 15 years ago in Chicago . It ' s used where there ' s a great_deal of circumstantial evidence. &quot; Asked_for their last words , the defendants , too , make their appeals . Artur Martynov : guilty . &quot; Citizens , please believe me . I was drunk . I didn ' t do anything , &quot; Artur says . Alexander adds : &quot; I didn ' t kill . I just hit and we left. &quot; Galkin reminds the jurors that their ultimate decision need not be unanimous , although they must try_for unanimity during their first three hours of deliberation . After that , a majority_rules . A 6-6 vote results in acquittal . Two hours later they are back , with a unanimous decision . Artur Martynov : guilty . But it is &quot; probable &quot; that his actions were committed in self-defense . Alexander Martynov : guilty , but in defense of his brother . The jury recommends leniency for him . The case has essentially been reduced to manslaughter . Galkin reads the sentence : For Artur , a year and a half in a work_camp . For Alexander , a year . Both are to include time served . The Martynovs smile for the first time , and embrace . &quot; It was a good , just verdict , based on evidence and the honest work of the jury process , &quot; Pashin says afterward , in his usual measured phrases . Then with uncharacteristic euphoria , he breaks_into a grin . &quot; It ' s a real holiday , &quot; he says . &quot; And tomorrow is my birthday. &quot; He ' ll be 31 . * &quot; It takes a long_time to change a system , it doesn ' t happen overnight , &quot; Burnham says on the phone a_few weeks after the trial . &quot; But the way to judge if the Russian jury_system is working is if it re-instills confidence in the judicial system. &quot; More_than a dozen jury trials later , it ' s still too early to know . Already , there has been one outright acquittal , and slowly , defendants in the targeted regions are opting for jury trials . But decades of judicial abuse have embittered Russia ' s citizens and left them without a notion of their rights or their power as jurors . After the Martynov trial , one juror , Dunayevskaya , the piano_teacher , said that she had been put_off by the defense_attorneys ' desire to acquit their clients , &quot; because one can ' t start declaring the murderer to be fully innocent. &quot; Another juror , unhappy with the light sentence , is more cynical . &quot; Everything was decided beforehand by the judge , &quot; he says , adding , &quot; It ' s not time to start jury trial in Russia . What ' s necessary at the moment is a tough , cruel law . We have to get_rid_of criminals , to have a civilized country. &quot; The new Constitution approved by Russian voters in December calls_for juries , and to Pashin this means that jury trial &quot; will be hard to undo &quot; despite the outcry against crime . It may take 10 to 15 years , he says , but eventually juries will be phased_in all_over Russia , as they were in the 19th Century . But the Saratov jurors ' sentiments show just how far Russia is from creating the enlightened citizens that Pashin hopes for , and legal reformers know it . &quot; You know , the economic calamities have told_on the population , &quot; says Alexei Galoganov , the defense_lawyer . &quot; They have many bitter feelings . Envy . Greed . A feeling about the unfairness of fate . And you need to fight all those feelings to make jury trial work . To make a person forget all his personal hardships and put all his attention to deciding fairly on the fate of the person in the dock. &quot;</TEXT>
