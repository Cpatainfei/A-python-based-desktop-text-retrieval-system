   <HEADLINE> JAZZ REVIEW ; VERVE ANNIVERSARY BASH A CELEBRATION OF THE PRESENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No company in the jazz business packages its records as smartly as Verve . So it made_sense that Wednesday ' s gala celebration of the label ' s storied history should have come as tightly wrapped and as colorfully arranged as a box of assorted sweets . Some of the offerings were gooey . Others were tart . But a_few more mixed nuts here and there would have been welcome . From the jump , it was clear that this made-for-TV event ( scheduled for broadcast May 18 on PBS , as part of the Great Performance Series ) would serve just enough of the 30-plus artists assembled for the bash . Despite the cavalcade of historic tributes , &quot; Verve at 50 &quot; was less a celebration of the label ' s past than a creamy-dreamy salute to its glittering present . Within such limitations , there were a_few pleasures to be had . It was nice , for instance , to see Dee Dee Bridgewater make a rare appearance , and nicer still to see her coming_into her own as a vocalist . Organist Jimmy Smith glowed within the frame of Oliver Nelson ' s classic arrangement of &quot; Walk on the Wild Side , &quot; re-enacted with the proper sense of fun by the Carnegie Hall Jazz_Band . Smith milked the formal-garbed audience so shamelessly that he gave the evening ' s somewhat self-conscious toniness a welcome jolt . Overall , the design of the show -- tributes to Ella Fitzgerald , Stan Getz , Oscar Peterson , Dizzy Gillespie , Bill Evans and other Verve icons -- was intelligently crafted . But some of the details were bewildering . Why , for instance , was Miles Davis one of the honorees ? His only direct connection with Verve have been_on a_couple_of sessions with Charlie Parker . * It became clear that Davis ' ghost was summoned for no other purpose than to bless the fusion artists who opened the second_half . Co-host Herbie Hancock , now a full-fledged Verve guy , also used his former boss ' spirit to advance his own forthcoming work for the label , billed as a &quot; synthesis of jazz hip-hop and African music. &quot; You like to root for someone who knows and loves the music as well as Hancock , but the groove-infested piece he trundled out only served to constrain such vital young voices as trumpeter Roy Hargrove and saxophonist Gary Thomas . Indeed , one was hoping that Hargrove , the latest and most promising addition to Verve ' s roster , would have had the chance to shine_at this event -- as he often has in similar settings . But his high-altitude fluidity seemed checked by the program ' s brisk pace . Indeed , there seemed just enough time for each of the stars to make an impression and leave . Trombonist J . J . Johnson and singer Betty Carter made the best of the situation . Carter ' s lively performance of &quot; How High the Moon &quot; showed her to be not only the best scat singer of the night , but the best bandleader as well .</TEXT>
