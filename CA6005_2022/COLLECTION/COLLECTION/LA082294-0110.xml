   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / JULIE CART ; FOCUS_ON ROTHENBERG AFTER UGLY REELECTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The recent U.S. Soccer Federation elections did little to support the claim advanced by soccer insiders that the sport ' s national governing body has finally risen above petty politics and factional infighting . Quite the contrary : The politics of deal-making and manipulation only rose to a more sophisticated level . Soccer America magazine devoted an unprecedented amount of space to the election , calling it soccer ' s &quot; quadrennial weekend of bloodletting. &quot; It turned_out to be an apt description of the activities at a resort_hotel in San Diego . The issue at_hand : Would the delegates reelect Alan Rothenberg to another four-year term , thus affirming his stewardship of both the federation and the World Cup , or would they choose USSF treasurer Richard Groff and steer clear of Rothenberg ' s apparent conflict_of_interest as president of the USSF and head of the proposed new professional league ? Both candidates bludgeoned voters with literature filled with personal attacks and charges of impropriety , utilizing the now-standard technique of leaving reams of position papers on hotel tables and in hallways . Much was made of each man ' s refusal to shake the other ' s hand . It was all silly except that it was so important to the future of the game in this country and the question of whether soccer ' s leaders will be able to capitalize on whatever exposure and momentum remains from last month ' s World Cup . Things got_out of hand when FIFA President Joao Havelange showed_up to throw his considerable weight behind Rothenberg . It was difficult to determine if , for example , the director of youth soccer in central Oklahoma was impressed or offended by the blatant electioneering and FIFA ' s bald attempt to influence the election of a member federation . Rothenberg said FIFA asked to attend and his camp debated whether Havelange ' s heavy hand would be an asset or liability . As it had been in 1990 , FIFA ' s interference in the USSF election was wrong . As messed_up as the USSF is , it at least has a right to self determination . * Rothenberg ' s campaign rhetoric took an interesting turn during the weekend , and the focus was Major_League Soccer . The issue of conflict_of_interest between his potential positions as head of the USSF and MLS was often raised and Rothenberg always noted that while MLS needed the support of the federation , the two entities were separate and independent . Yet , many times during his last-minute campaigning in San Diego , Rothenberg suggested that if not reelected , MLS would fail . Suddenly the connection between the USSF and the pro league was wholly necessary for the future of professional soccer in the United States . After that thinly veiled threat was tossed into play , delegates who might not have otherwise been disposed to vote for Rothenberg had to set_aside their dislike for the candidate and give primacy to the need to support the proposed pro league . Faced with that kind of choice , they cast their votes for MLS , not Rothenberg . Hardly_a ringing endorsement . There is another problem with the MLS-election connection : When the USSF awarded Rothenberg ' s group the right to organize a first-division outdoor league , it presumably did so in good_faith , with an expectation that the group would make every effort to make MLS a viable league . The USSF turned_down other earnest bidders and entrusted the pro league to Rothenberg ' s group . No doubt the other bidding groups would be dismayed to hear Rothenberg ' s attitude toward that trust . It seems that the MLS group ' s first obligation is to go_about finding investors and getting the league off the ground , thus confirming U.S. Soccer ' s trust and World Cup ' s $ 5-million &quot; loan. &quot; MLS has no business getting involved in USSF politics . Many in San Diego viewed the connection inappropriate , at best . * Conflict and alienation are not minor concerns for the USSF . It is important for Rothenberg to act to heal the wounds from the last four years and whatever injury caused by the recent campaign . Also , Rothenberg needs to be more sensitive to conflict-of-interest concerns and to hold himself to a high standard of conduct whenever the USSF considers MLS matters . Ultimately , the membership of the USSF made the right choice . Rothenberg argued that , for his organization of the World Cup alone , he should have been reelected . He ' s right . World Cup ' s organizational know-how left a legacy of international respect that should accrue to the U.S. federation . Rothenberg and his staff are responsible_for that . But without the goal of the World Cup , can Rothenberg maintain interest in the mundane chores of running soccer in the United States ? Will he have time to devote to anything other_than getting his league running ? Can he work fairly with the other pro leagues ? What will he do for player development , the issue that most soccer insiders believe is the most pressing .</TEXT>
