   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES : SCHOOL_BOARD JOB DESCRIPTION IS A CHALLENGING ONE INDEED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Nov . 8 , voters throughout California will be electing thousands of school_board members to lead their communities ' most important enterprise -- their neighborhood school districts . As multimillion-dollar corporations , school districts are often the largest employer in a community , with the largest transportation and food service operations , and the greatest number of facilities to maintain . These corporations are headed by boards of directors -- local school_board members . In California there are over 5 # 000 school_board members governing more_than 1 # 000 local school districts in which 5.3 million children are educated . This is the largest and most diverse public_school system in the nation -- and 40 % of California ' s state budget goes_to support it . It ' s vitally important for voters to pay close attention to the citizens they select to oversee their schools -- the lay governing board_members to whom they entrust their children and their tax dollars . In fact , voters hold their schools accountable through the board_members they elect . But first they have a responsibility to elect the best possible people to serve on their local governing boards . What does a board_member do ? There are certain core decision-making functions so fundamental to a school_system ' s accountability to the public that , in our system of democracy , they can be performed only by an elected governing body . Therefore , locally elected board_members are responsible_for : * Establishing a long-term vision for their school_system . * Establishing and maintaining a basic organizational structure for their school_system , including hiring a superintendent , adopting an annual budget and governance policies , and creating a climate that promotes excellence . * Establishing systems and processes to ensure accountability to the community , including fiscal accountability , accountability for programs and student performance , staff accountability and collective_bargaining . * Advocacy in behalf of children and public education at the community , state and national levels . What kind of person do you need to fill such a position ? Obviously , you need board_members who represent the community , possess a variety of styles and backgrounds and have a diversity of views . There is no perfect school_board member model , but there are a number of basic characteristics that effective board_members have in common : * Effective board_members have a clear understanding of their leadership duties and of their central , powerful role in providing quality education . They are also aware that power flows_from the community , through them , to the school_system and that they are accountable to the community and to society at_large . * They understand the importance of teamwork . They know they need to work with their board colleagues and staff . They know schools don ' t operate in a vacuum , so they need to collaborate with other public agencies and form partnerships with business to make_sure we have created communities healthy for children and schools that elicit the best from all students . * They have a positive attitude and are able to engender an atmosphere of creative , high-energy productivity . * They are respectful -- able to listen well to colleagues and constituents and to mobilize the best efforts of their staff . * They have integrity and are worthy of the community ' s trust . * They communicate openly and honestly . * They behave with a high level of professionalism , setting a tone for the entire district that communicates the importance and seriousness of the endeavor for which they are responsible . * They operate with fairness , firmness , stability , sustained effort and consistency . In addition , board_members must dedicate the necessary time to perform their duties well . An effective board_member can easily spend up_to 20 hours a week in meetings , taking phone_calls , talking with students , parents , teachers , school personnel and constituents , visiting schools , and reading or attending workshops and seminars to continually expand their capacity to understand and support education reform issues . Being a board_member is a major commitment and sacrifice of family , career and leisure_time to public_service . The candidate you vote for should not be making that commitment lightly . Board_members must be resilient . They must be able to maintain their focus_on making a positive difference even under_fire . In a democracy , you cannot please everyone , but you make_sure the greater good for the most people is served . Even if you receive criticism from some , while acknowledging their right to feel as they do , you must have the fortitude to lead systems forward in response to the wishes of the majority . Effective board_members are future-focused change agents who have patience . They know change is an ongoing process , and to move school_systems forward more rapidly than ever before means taking the time to engender public understanding , support and participation . Most of all , the board_members you elect must have a passionate commitment to public_schools and to educating all children . They must have a passion for democracy , with a true understanding that their role is to implement the will of the majority , not to impose their own will on other people ' s children . Every single voter has the ability to move the schools of their communities and this state forward . The first_step ? Vote wisely on Nov . 8 .</TEXT>
