   <HEADLINE> AROUND TOWN : IS THERE A GHOST OF A CHANCE HE ' S RIGHT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> My interview with the vampire takes_place in a peach-colored house on a tree-shaded street in Redondo Beach . Just home , sweet home , save for the doormat that goes &quot; Boooo ! &quot; when stepped upon . But , it is almost Halloween . The man who lives here , however , is no average suburbanite . The first clue ? A mop of improbably blue-black hair , which he swears is home-grown . Wiglike , it all but obscures his green eyes . Sea-green , he explains : &quot; All Gorfs had sea-green eyes. &quot; Then there are the canine teeth ( his own , he swears ) , long and pointy . And that voice : Is it British or ghoulish ? &quot; Some people say I ' m a cross between Vincent Price and Elvis Presley , &quot; says Albert Ryan -- Sir Albert , if you will . He ' s entitled to a title , he claims , as a descendant of &quot; Lord Gorf , &quot; an Irish nobleman burned at the stake in 1706 for Satanic savagery . &quot; He supposedly tortured and murdered people and drank their blood -- men , women and children . Very vicious . We don ' t like to talk_about it , &quot; says Sir Albert , proceeding to talk_about it . As he tells it , his Gorf ancestor had a fancy burial in Tipperary but , two years later , was exhumed by a pair of grave robbers . The corpse &quot; bolted upright in his coffin and opened his eyes , which blazed like live coals. &quot; His horrifying scream , and the fresh blood on his face and hands , sent the intruders fleeing . &quot; One died of a heart_attack , &quot; Ryan says , and &quot; the other died in an asylum. &quot; Throughout the village , people turned_up dead with small bite marks on their throats and wrists . It was_on Halloween about 40 years ago that 8-year-old Albert was told by his Irish-born parents of this legacy . He hoped they were joking ; still , he ' d had his suspicions . &quot; All the males in the family seemed to have large canine teeth . My father ' s literally stuck_out of his mouth. &quot; And his Irish uncle was a &quot; dead-ringer ( so to speak ) for Bela Lugosi. &quot; It was inevitable he would search for his roots in Ireland . &quot; I found_out it was no joke , &quot; he says . He makes vague reference_to some library documents . Always , he was bent_on being an actor and , like bats to a belfry , was drawn to macabre and sinister roles , beginning at Bishop Montgomery High in Torrance , where he played the homicidal maniac in &quot; Arsenic and Old Lace. &quot; Perhaps , he muses , he was a bit weird even then . On Irish and British stages , he gravitated to ghostly roles . Perhaps it was only a short leap into a second profession : vampirologist and ghoulologist . &quot; It ' s a very secret branch of parapsychology , &quot; he explains . So secret , he adds , that , in all_of California , there are but five vampirologists . As demand is limited , he has a day job as a speech_therapist at a facility for the developmentally disabled . Vampires preferring darkness , vampirology is no 9-to-5 gig . Among his clients , he mentions assorted police_departments , Metropol and Scotland_Yard . Could we , uh , verify that ? &quot; Oh , no . It ' s very secretive . Nobody will divulge any knowledge of having anything to do with it . . . . They ' ll say , ' We don ' t know you , we never had this conversation , it never happened . . . . ' &quot; He dismisses the skeptical as being as unenlightened as those who don ' t believe_in UFOs . Deadpan , he ' ll tell you , &quot; I have myself authenticated 40 vampire cases , &quot; among them two &quot; terrifying close encounters &quot; that convinced him of the existence of blood-sucking vampires and flesh-nibbling ghouls . Just how does a vampirologist do his thing ? Well , he explains , a hunt typically begins with the spotting of a tombstone riddled with holes . Should a vampire lie below , flowers placed there will wilt at once . &quot; And there will be an aura . If you happen to be psychic , which I am , you will detect it immediately. &quot; Ryan describes a memorable sighting , that of Ubour the vampire in Bulgaria : &quot; We saw the vampire literally rise_up out of the grave , jellylike , bloated , its skin like leather , its eyes bulging_out of its head . And it had only one nostril . It glided across the ground . There were spurts of hair sticking_out of his head . It was ghastly , absolutely ghastly. &quot; Now , lest you think Ryan has been nipping at the elderberry wine , he wishes to go_on record : &quot; I don ' t believe somebody bites somebody and turns them into a vampire. &quot; * His sister , Marie , who lives with him , says : &quot; I think he ' s done some of these things. &quot; The police_investigations ? &quot; I ' ll be honest , I don ' t know. &quot; The vampirology ? &quot; I look_at every bit of that very lightheartedly . . . but there are a lot of things in the world you can ' t explain. &quot; Is it possible Sir Albert ' s vampire character and reality have somehow fused in his mind ? &quot; I hope not , &quot; Marie Ryan says . To become a vampire , &quot; You must lead a very evil and wicked life and die in an unredemptive state , &quot; Ryan says . In short , one makes a pact with the_devil to become &quot; a full-fledged vampire in good standing. &quot; Now , L.A. has survived riot , floods , quakes . Are vampires next ? &quot; There ' s more reason than you can imagine to be afraid , &quot; Ryan says . &quot; I ' ve investigated 12 cases of absolute vampirism in 10 years. &quot; And , he adds , vampires &quot; seek blood indiscriminately , &quot; selecting victims at random . His snooping , he ' ll tell you , has brought threats on his life . &quot; There are sects , cults of vampires , we know now. &quot; Once , a voodoo doll appeared on his doorstep . There was a phone threat in a voice that &quot; I knew was not human. &quot; * OK , we ' ve got_to ask : How about Tom Cruise in that other &quot; Interview With the Vampire &quot; ? &quot; He really stumped me , &quot; says Ryan , who saw an advance screening hosted by the Count Dracula Society . &quot; He does amazingly well. &quot; And the film ? &quot; One side of me liked it -- the dark side. &quot; ( Not as scary , though , as his all-time favorite , a low-budget ' 60s thriller , &quot; Carnival of Souls. &quot; ) As for his lighter side , there ' s Lord Gorf , the_Irish vampire . In a sparkly green cape , he becomes a cartoon vampire , entertaining at parties and charity events . &quot; Children love me. &quot; But he ' s a bachelor vampire . &quot; I ' ve come_close , but usually when they find_out my background , well , ' It ' s been nice knowing you . . . . ' &quot; Have you been putting us on , Sir Albert ? Well , &quot; Of course a lot of this is handed_down . . . . &quot; And it ' s a long way to Tipperary .</TEXT>
