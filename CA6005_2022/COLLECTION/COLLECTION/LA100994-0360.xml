   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A ; WHEN THE BOTTOM_LINE IS PERSONAL HONOR ; AUTHOR BACKS COEXISTENCE OF BUSINESS , ETHICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rabbi Wayne Dosick must have struck_a_chord with his book &quot; The Business Bible : Ten New Commandments for Creating an Ethical Workplace &quot; ( William Morrow &amp; Co. ) . It sold_out its 15 # 000-copy hardcover run last year and has just been released in paperback by HarperBusiness . Using contemporary examples and ancient parables , Dosick , 47 , structured his book around 10 chapters on 10 ethical commandments . Among them : Honesty is the best management policy , whether dealing with employees or customers . And : Managers have a responsibility to treat employees and customers as they would prefer to be treated . Dosick , who lives_in La Costa , Calif. , is an adjunct professor of Jewish studies at the University of San Diego . * Q : Why is a book linking business and ethics timely ? A : There ' s an upheaval going_on . The &quot; Me Decade &quot; of the ' 70s and the &quot; Greed Is Good &quot; decade of the ' 80s led to all these excesses -- the Wall_Street scandals , the S &amp; L failures . Suddenly , business_leaders are beginning to talk_about business in an entirely new way as &quot; a trust &quot; and &quot; a calling &quot; and &quot; a covenant &quot; and as &quot; love. &quot; I said to myself , I have a unique perspective to offer this discussion . These guys come from , if you will , the failure of the business world to live_up_to good ethical standards , and they are calling the business world to task for that . I come from the perspective of bringing the ethical standards to the business world . Not just Judaism , but all_the spiritual traditions have something to say about how we live decently in our everyday lives . The Bible and Talmud are not just holy books out there for sacred moments , but nitty-gritty books teaching how we are to behave with each other in everyday relationships and which over and over again talk_about issues of commerce and business . * Q : So your book is a compendium of business lessons to be drawn from holy texts ? A : After I started writing , I looked_around and knew I needed real-life examples , that I couldn ' t talk on an esoteric plane as if I ' d gotten the word off the mountain and you guys better listen . I knew I ' d need to find companies that do this kind of stuff . So I went looking_for businesses that do_it right -- that do_well by doing_good -- and I found some . Tom ' s of Maine , the toothpaste maker , and Ben and Jerry ' s ice_cream people are_well known for sharing their profits and for social consciousness . Then I ran_into this company called Fel-Pro , an automotive gasket manufacturer in Skokie , Ill. , whose managers were invited to the White_House for Clinton ' s signing of the family leave bill . Fel-Pro has been giving family leave for the past 12 years . They have on-site legal and psychological counseling , summer_camps and scholarships for employees ' kids . I asked around and it turned_out , by sheer coincidence and luck , that Fel-Pro ' s co-chairman , Lewis Weinberg , has a retirement house in Ramona ( a San Diego suburb ) . So I got introduced to and had dinner with him and I asked Mr. Weinberg : &quot; How can you do all this ? &quot; He looked_at me and said , &quot; How can we not do_it ? For 54 straight years , we have had increasing profit , and there is only one reason : We take_care of our employees and our employees take_care of us. &quot; * Q : One of your main themes is the value of treating employees and customers humanely . A : Ethics go_across the board -- internally with employees , externally with consumers . When I did book signings and people would pass me by , I ' d call them over , and they ' d say , &quot; I ' m retired , I don ' t need a book on business ethics. &quot; But every one of us is involved in business if we do nothing more_than buy a 29-cent stamp or a tube of toothpaste . I ' ve been collecting business stories -- the good , the bad and the ugly of how people behave out there . You probably have your own litany . If you just recorded how you were treated in various business settings in the course of one week , you ' d be blown away at how poorly you ' re treated , and we don ' t really give it much thought . But then you jump hoops and get happy when you ' re treated well . that ' s why there will always be a place for Nordstrom , no matter what Wal-Mart does to a downtown shopping district . When you think_of Nordstrom , you think_of quality and service , not that the prices are high . The bottom_line is that we ' ll go_back again and again to a place where we ' re treated well , and we ' ll stay_away_from places where we are not treated well . * Q : You quote the prophet Micah to define a true business_leader as someone who &quot; does justly , loves mercy and walks humbly. &quot; What did you mean ? A : Those are the exact three qualities that a good leader has to have . In the Israeli army , the generals are at the head of the line and they say , &quot; Follow me. &quot; They ' re not sitting in some bunker saying , &quot; Charge ! &quot; People don ' t become leaders in some office coup , but from engendering the loyalty of the people they are to lead , the same way when you ' re a 15-year-old kid playing football or in your college fraternity . You treat people decently , give them good_examples , you show them the way , and you do the job with them . You have to be fair , have to have compassion and walk humbly . Anyone who walks too high on a pedestal gets knocked_off one of these days . * Q : Why is truth important in a business setting ? A : Because everything depends_on it -- your honor , your word , your reputation and eventually your business . If you lie to me , you may get_away with it this time and the next time and the time after . But if I catch you in that lie , that ' s it , we ' re done , because I can never trust you again . And I have to be able to do my business based on trust . From my point_of_view , everything depends_on honesty . The worst that happens is the shuttle blows_up , or the airplane mechanic doesn ' t tighten a bolt tight enough and a plane crashes , or people get hurt or people ' s lives are ruined . You value truth with a wife or husband , because you know what lack of trust can do to a marriage . You value it with_children , because you know what a broken promise can do to a six- year old . And you value it when you walk into a church or mosque or synagogue , because you aren ' t going_to lie to the pastor . The only thing going_on in the business world that ' s not going_on in our other worlds is that we are trying to make money , trying to make a profit , trying to acquire more and more . And so something happens that profit and acquisition become so important to us ( that ) we are willing to give_up our personal honor for it . * Q : Any sign that a more ethical , humane approach to work is coming_to realization ? A : IBM used to stand_for &quot; I ' ve Been Moved. &quot; People are saying , finally : &quot; I have a job that I like . I will sacrifice the promotion , prestige and money that goes_with it for being where I am -- to keep the kids in the good schools , where the family is tied to the community. &quot; that ' s happening a lot these days . The Centers_for_Disease_Control in Atlanta came_out and said that for every $ 1 that a company spends in preventive health_care and exercise programs for employees , the company saves $ 7 in future health costs . So now we ' re getting firm data , statistical research , that doing_good benefits the bottom_line . Employees are finding_out that success is not measured in dollars but in creativity , personal satisfaction , how one touches the life of another person . Maybe touching the lives of youngsters whom he can help mold and shape is in the end far more satisfying for an MBA or an engineer . It may turn_out that an MBA ' s real calling is to be a high_school coach . As hard as it is to say , the American_dream we thought we were going_to have isn ' t going_to be . Instead of lamenting that , we ' ve got_to begin to deal with that reality , and we have to dig deep into our souls -- our creatvity and beings -- to know that there are other things to do than the jobs we ' ve been doing . * Q : If greed was good_enough 10 years ago , why not now ? A : Reality set_in . Once you have it all -- the house in the suburbs , the condo at the beach , the fancy cars in the driveway , kids in private_school -- you turn_around and say : &quot; So what ? What now ? &quot; It ' s not material things that count , and people are finding that out . It ' s the heart ' s satisfaction , the soul ' s satisfaction of making your contribution to the ongoing process of the universe , toward touching the hearts and souls of other people , to being a decent , kind and humane human_being , by making your life on earth make a difference in the lives of others . * Q : But how does that relate to managers ? A : By understanding that the bottom_line is not necessarily measured in dollar_signs , that you can do_good stuff with your business as well . When you share what you have earned with the people who helped you earn it -- the employees and the customers who paid the bills -- you get what you give . * Q : Doesn ' t a company have to ration its humanity in tough times like these when survival is at_issue ? Isn ' t a company justified in giving less slack to problem employees , for example ? A : Well , the first thing I want to know is : Why is the problem employee a problem ? Why is the problem child in kindergarten a problem child ? Fel-Pro , for example , has on-site psychological counseling to help find_out what ' s going_on here . Maybe the worker is having trouble at_home -- his father is_sick , his child is having problems . Maybe he ' s a creative_person who feels punched down by the system or the boss or whatever . Let ' s find_out . People are not problems inherently ; people have problems because of something that ' s going_on in their lives . If we are going_to help that person as a human_being , let ' s help him the best we can to solve it . To say everyone is going_to fit and will be fabulous and wonderful for the company -- obviously there are mismatches . But before I dismiss someone as a problem employee , I ' m going_to try to find_out the best I can what is going_on in their lives .</TEXT>
