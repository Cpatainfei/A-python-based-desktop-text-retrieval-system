   <HEADLINE> COLOMBIAN COCAINE PROSECUTOR CALLS WORLDWIDE DRUG WAR FUTILE ; NARCOTICS : LEGALIZATION WOULD REDUCE CARTELS ' PROFITS , DE GREIFF TELLS FORUM . HE SAYS U.S. HAS BEEN TRYING TO DISCREDIT HIM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The message is that the worldwide war on drugs should be abandoned , and the man responsible_for prosecuting Colombian cocaine cartels brought that controversial view here on Sunday . The remarks by Gustavo de Greiff were the highlight of a forum on the subject sponsored by local business and entertainment leaders . De Greiff , for the past two years the point_man for the Colombian government ' s anti-drug campaign , has been bluntly criticized by the U.S. Justice_Department for negotiating plea bargains with traffickers , and for arguing that legalization would deny the cartels billions of dollars in profits . &quot; The war as it has been conducted is a failure , &quot; said de Greiff . &quot; Narco-trafficking is a big business and business stops being good business when it stops profiting. &quot; He told a Beverly Hills audience of several hundred at a drug policy forum that more land than ever is being cultivated with coca , the plant from which cocaine is derived -- despite U.S.-assisted efforts to crack_down on drug kingpins and to stanch the flow of the narcotic into the United States . Moreover , he said , less than 15 % of the cocaine shipped out of Colombia is seized before it reaches markets in the United States and elsewhere . Striking back at his critics , de Greiff accused the U.S._government of trying to discredit him by pressuring convicted drug_traffickers to claim him as an ally in their illicit trade . He also charged that the United States was behind a campaign to smear Colombia ' s newly elected president , Ernesto Samper , orchestrating the release of audiocassettes of a conversation in which a top drug kingpin discusses plans to contribute to Samper ' s election campaign . As a result , de Greiff said , Samper will not be able to reach plea bargains that require traffickers to dismantle their operations , without seeming like he has been corrupted by the cartels . &quot; The new president will not be able to move_in any way but repression , &quot; said de Greiff , who will soon leave_office . &quot; That is stupid. &quot; De Greiff was one of seven panelists at the forum sponsored by Town_Hall of Los Angeles , a business group , and Show Coalition , an entertainment_industry public affairs group . One of its leaders , actor Richard Dreyfuss , who acknowledged his own past cocaine problems Sunday , moderated the program . The panelists included high-profile professors , researchers , policy experts and writers who all agreed that America ' s drug war -- like the Prohibition-era campaign against alcohol -- is misguided and creates more misery than it eliminates . Event organizers said they invited U.S. Surgeon_General Joycelyn Elders and other Clinton_Administration officials to participate , but none accepted . Last fall , Elders said that legalizing drugs would &quot; markedly reduce our crime_rate , &quot; and she called_for further study of the idea . Republicans and Democrats alike immediately criticized Elders for that view , and the Administration quickly distanced itself from her remarks . The Administration ' s strategy has been to emphasize treatment for hard-core drug_users , and to target drug producers in countries such_as Colombia . But panelists said the Administration hasn ' t budgeted enough funds for treatment and education . An Orange County Superior_Court judge who in 1992 suggested legalizing the use of marijuana , cocaine and heroin appeared on the panel Sunday . James P . Gray called de Greiff a hero for his stand on the issue . Gray said his support for legalization does not mean he condones drug use . Rather , he said , it recognizes that &quot; we have never had a drug-free society and we never will. &quot; Instead of treating drug_users like criminals , he said , they deserve compassion and help_out of their addictions . Gray joined the others in calling_for an independent commission to re-examine the nation ' s drug strategy . Mike Gray , an author and screenwriter who is finishing a book on Prohibition , said that like Prohibition , the drug war has created massive police corruption , an exploding prison population and a rise in street violence , with no noticeable drop_in drug use .</TEXT>
