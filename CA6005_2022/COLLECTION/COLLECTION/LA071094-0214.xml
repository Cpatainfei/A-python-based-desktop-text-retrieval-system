   <HEADLINE> GIVING TAIWAN AN EVEN BREAK ; ONE-CHINA POLICY , SURE ; BUT LET ' S NOT FORGET A VALUABLE TRADING PARTNER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration ' s reported interest in warming_up U.S. relations with Taiwan is yet another reminder that in foreign relations even the most apparently settled policies are sometimes -- and quite properly -- subject_to revision . In this case the changes being considered , as Times staff writer Jim Mann reported the other day , fall well short of being radical . Basically , they aim at making more convenient and effective the conduct of a continuing if deliberately understated relationship . Among the ideas being considered is to allow Cabinet officers from the two governments to visit each other ' s country , something that has pretty much been banned ever since Washington officially extended diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1979 and ended its formal ties with Taipei . Additionally , Taiwan ' s liaison offices in Washington and other U.S. cities would be allowed to identify themselves more precisely . For the last 15 years those offices have been designated the Coordination Council for North_American Affairs , a name so semantically insipid and politically neutered as_to leave all but specialists baffled about what it is they do . U.S. officials emphasize that the modest upgrading in Taiwan ' s status that is being pondered doesn ' t affect Washington ' s one-China policy . Since 1972 , when President Richard Nixon ' s visit to China ended a 23-year freeze in bilateral relations , U.S. policy has accepted that Taiwan is part of China , and that it is up_to the Chinese to work_out their political future . In fact , in recent years Taiwan and the mainland have greatly expanded relations in such areas as trade and tourism , though their political differences remain unresolved . The United States has become Taiwan ' s foremost trading partner , while Taiwan is now the sixth-biggest market for American products , including hundreds of millions of dollars a year in military supplies . Putting relations on a more open basis certainly is worthwhile and can be done without downgrading relations with Beijing or compromising previous agreements . China may_not like it , but the question is what kind of policy best serves overall U.S. interests . The answer in this instance is a policy whose chief purpose is to make_it easier to carry_on regular business with a key trading partner . The see-no-Taiwan , speak-no-Taiwan policy of the last 15 years has sometimes been carried to self-humiliating lengths . Thus when Taiwan ' s President Lee Teng-hui two months ago asked permission to rest for a night in Honolulu while on a flight to Central_America the State_Department refused , fearing that to grant permission might upset Beijing . If a new approach to Taiwan does nothing else than put an end to such indefensibly craven behavior , it would have to be considered a plus .</TEXT>
