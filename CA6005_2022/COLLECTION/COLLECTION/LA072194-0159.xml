   <HEADLINE> KIA MOTORS ANNOUNCES RECALL TO REPLACE SPEEDOMETER SENSORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Less than six months after beginning sales in the United States , Kia Motors America has announced a voluntary recall of nearly 7 # 000 cars to replace sensors that control speedometers and cruise_controls . Only about half the 6 # 945 cars subject_to the recall have actually been sold to private buyers , the company indicated.The others are still on dealers ' lots or waiting to be shipped to dealers . Industry_analysts say the recall is not likely to hurt Irvine-based Kia , which advertises its vehicles as well-built cars for everyone . About 13 # 000 cars , which are built_in South_Korea and known as the Sephia , have been imported into the United States so far . The starting price is roughly $ 9 # 000 . &quot; Recalls don ' t have the negative connotations they used to have &quot; when most repairs were forced on reluctant auto_makers by federal regulators , said Christopher Cedargren , an analyst with AutoPacific Group in Santa Ana . &quot; Most recalls these days are voluntary , and they tell people that the car_companies care about quality. &quot; Kia Motors America , which imports and distributes the cars through 67 dealerships in the United States , said the cars subject_to its recall were equipped with an electronic speed sensor that has developed an &quot; unacceptable &quot; malfunction rate . The problems have been identified over time in the Sephias that have been used by rental fleets since last fall . Kia began a &quot; rolling &quot; retail introduction of its cars in Washington in February . The first dealerships in Southern California opened in May .</TEXT>
