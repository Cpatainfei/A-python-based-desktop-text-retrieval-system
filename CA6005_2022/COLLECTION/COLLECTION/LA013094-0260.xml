   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; FIRST INDICATIONS OF ' NEW POLITICS ' APPEAR IN JAPAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For years , politicians and scholars have been talking_about the need for &quot; new politics &quot; in Japan . On Saturday , the first signs of its arrival took_shape as both houses of Parliament committed themselves to launching an overhaul of Japan ' s electoral_system and implementing new controls on political funds to eradicate corruption . Even as the Japanese themselves had become convinced that their scandal-ridden political_system was incapable of cleansing itself , each chamber of Parliament approved a last-minute compromise designed to uproot the causes of corruption . And they did_it without tactics used so many times in the past : shouting , brawling , pushing or resorting_to the now famous &quot; cow walk , &quot; a slow shuffle that prolongs by hours the trip to the parliamentary ballot_box . Just nine days ago , when the upper house defeated an initial reform package , Tetsundo Iwakuni , mayor of the city of Izumo and a former Merrill Lynch executive , declared that Japan had proved it could not reform itself . And just two days ago , Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa , hinting that he might resign , warned that the country was about to lose its last chance for reform . A penchant for finding legal loopholes may yet turn the grand experiment to eradicate corruption into a failure . And the effect of a new electoral_system of single-seat ( instead of multiple-seat ) lower-house districts , which Japan has not experienced in the last 75 years , remains to be tested . But whatever the outcome , at least the attempt at reform is now an established fact . And it was carried_out by a breed of politicians never before seen in the post-World War II era , in which factional powerbrokers have nearly always made the deals . On one side was Hosokawa , 56 , a son of aristocrats . He began his career in the Liberal Democratic Party that dominated politics until a mass of defectors walked_out last summer and deprived it of its majority in the lower house . But it was not as a factional kingpin that he rose_to_power . Rather , it was as head of a still-fragile grass-roots political_party dedicated solely to change , which he founded just two years ago . When the Liberal Democrats fell , seven parties patched together a coalition and offered him the mantle . On the other side was Yohei Kono , 57 , the Liberal Democrats ' leader . Although the son of a deceased Liberal Democratic powerbroker himself , Kono lost patience with the party ' s inability to uproot corruption nearly two decades ago . He walked_out to establish his own reform party in 1976 , in the aftermath of the Lockheed bribery scandal . Ten years later , however , he admitted failure and rejoined the conservative Liberal Democrats . Last summer , the Liberal Democrats picked Kono over a traditional powerbroker as their leader . And early Saturday , memories of his reform-minded youth came_back as he and Hosokawa averted a political crisis by hammering_out a 10-point agreement on reform . Later in the day , Parliament sealed the agreement by acting to keep the political reform bills alive as its extraordinary session ended . Final revisions -- possibly in February -- may be enacted in a new session that starts Monday . Kono acted despite the fact that an estimated 70 % of his party ' s Parliament representatives remained unenthusiastic about reforms . In the past , the opposition usually opposed by rote , without offering realistic alternatives , but this time the Liberal Democrats had presented detailed proposals of_their_own -- a turn of events that made the compromise possible . Although Parliament failed to break the stalemate -- once again leaving the real decision-making to an arena outside its chambers -- four months of deliberations on the reform package gave air to the opinions of its members as seldom before . Coming_after more_than five years of haggling over reform that brought_about the resignations of two prime_ministers , the debate precipitated a new phenomenon in Japanese politics : the intraparty rebellion . No longer can Japan ' s leaders count_on party discipline or powerbrokers ' orders to whip supporters into line . Dozens of representatives on both sides of the aisle served notice that from now on , they will act_on their own convictions -- a dramatic turnabout from the days when individual politicians dared not speak out against the opinions of the powerbroker bosses . Indeed , 21 Liberal Democrats and 28 Socialists in both houses again rebelled against party orders in the vote Saturday . Earlier , a Liberal Democratic uprising helped pass the original package in the lower house , while a Socialist protest brought_about its defeat in the upper house . More changes appeared virtually certain . With the multi-seat districts that nurtured a plethora of small parties about to disappear , a political structure dominated by two parties , both capable of assuming control of the government , is expected to emerge . NEXT STEP Following its eleventh-hour passage of a package of political reforms , Japan ' s Parliament will recess for just one day before beginning a new session Monday . Final revisions to the package could come as early as February . But legislators are expected to move beyond reform issues and concentrate_on both short-term economic stimulus measures and the state budget bill for the 1994 fiscal_year beginning April 1 . An economic stimulus package could be unveiled as early as this week . Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa , meanwhile , has cleared the decks at_home before a scheduled trip to Washington , where he will hold trade talks on Feb . 11 with President Clinton .</TEXT>
