   <HEADLINE> VALLEY COMMENTARY ; CONTROLLED BURNING IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO PREVENT LETHAL FIRES ; IT ' S NATURE ' S METHOD AND IT WORKS . A DECISION NOT TO DO IT IS A DECISION TO ALLOW A HOLOCAUST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The fires that killed three people and destroyed 390 homes_in Topanga alone were not preventable -- but the damage that they did was . The fire was routine . The disaster was human-caused . The starting of fires , whether by arsonists , cigarette throwers or lightning , is inevitable , a routine event . We cannot prevent fires . But we can prevent a fire from developing_into a holocaust . A holocaust cannot develop unless large amounts of fuel are available . To prevent disaster , we must continually reduce the long-term accumulation of fuel on the ground . Mechanically removing the brush is infeasible because of the enormous cost . Mother Nature ' s method is the only one that works . It ' s called controlled burning . The safe and economical way to remove the lethal brush is to burn it under conditions when it is impossible for a fire to propagate itself , that is , when the ground and vegetation are wet . At first , firebreaks should be burned through the heavy brush mass . Then the areas between the breaks can be burned at times when a fire will barely sustain itself . The result will be a checkerboard in which some sections have burned more recently than others . A natural fire_control_system is compatible with both populated and wild areas and highly likely to work . In effect , it is the system nature used for millions of years to control the fire process and make_it useful . A three-phase program is needed : 1 . A scientific investigation to prepare the way for the fire-control system . 2 . A test to assure it works . 3 . Operation . Once the protective mosaic has been established , the system is completely self-maintaining and very low in cost , providing that fires occur often enough in all areas of the mosaic . If they do not , fires must be started as needed . The result will be the complete elimination of the lethal brush_fire and mudslide danger that now has California in thrall . If you want to see a modern-day example of how Mother Nature handles the brush problem if left alone , you need only fly over Mexico . It has many areas of chaparral similar to ours . You will see the mosaic pattern of natural protective burns , and one must ask why we so rarely hear of disastrous firestorms in Mexico . In the past , controlled burns have worked until one gets_out of control and creates some damage . Then the whole idea is dropped . No one seems to realize that a decision not to do controlled burning is , in_effect , a decision to allow a holocaust . Controlled burning under this system should be exempt from air-pollution regulations . Stopping disasters is far more important to our health than any problems from a small amount of natural fire emissions . The burning would be done_in the wet season when air quality is higher . Nor should individual property_owners be able to prevent controlled burning by withholding their permission . Politicians have ignored this lethal problem . It ' s time to let them know that we expect them to solve it , either as I am proposing or in some_other way .</TEXT>
