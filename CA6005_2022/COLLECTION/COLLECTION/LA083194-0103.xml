   <HEADLINE> AUCTION_HOUSE BANKRUPTCY FILING IS LATEST OF MCNALL ' S PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Superior Stamp &amp; Coin Co. , Inc. , an international auction_house of which Bruce McNall was majority owner , became the latest enterprise to fail the Kings ' president when it filed for bankruptcy in federal_court last week . The action came as the firm ' s debts exceeded assets by about $ 9 million . Andrew Goodman , an Encino tax attorney representing Superior , said the company ' s failure was not a result of McNall ' s financial and legal problems . McNall was sole owner of the Kings until May , when he sold 72 % of the franchise for $ 60 million as part of a plan to pay_off a $ 92-million business loan . Shortly thereafter , he filed for bankruptcy . He recently reached a plea agreement in a federal investigation into bank fraud involving his chief holding company , McNall Sports and Entertainment . &quot; ( Superior has ) suffered operating losses due_to downturn in the collectible business , &quot; Goodman said Tuesday . Other factors_in the demise of the 64-year old Beverly Hills company that handled rare stamps , coins and other collectibles were its debt load and mounting lawsuits . &quot; It ' s like every_other industry in this economy , it ' s just not what it used to be , &quot; Goodman said . Superior also filed a motion seeking authority to transfer consignment and auction portions of its business to A-Mark Auction Galleries . The firm is seeking to sell its assets to A-Mark . The motion will be heard Sept . 20 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles . ELLIOTT ALMOND</TEXT>
