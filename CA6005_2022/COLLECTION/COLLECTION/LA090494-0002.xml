   <TEXT> Anthropologists generally agree that before the arrival of Europeans , California , as now , was the most heavily populated area of America north of the Rio Grande . There was no single dominant Native_American nation -- no League of the Iroquois or Huron Confederacy -- but rather a mosaic of distinct and coexistent small cultures , each with its own language and tradition , religion and cosmology . From the Yurok in the north , whose social and economic_systems were intricately entwined , to the tiny bands of kin-based bands in the south , indigenous California societies were as diverse as they were numerous , as creatively adaptive to their particular environments as they were artistically and philosophically experimental . Viewed collectively , they constitute a marvelous microcosm for the wide range of human possibility . Over the last four centuries their numbers have been decimated . Tens of thousands perished from the Old_World diseases contracted at Spanish missions ; countless others , especially those unfortunate enough to live near the gold fields , were hunted_down for sport . A few men and women became famous , like Ishi , for being the last representatives of their cultures , but a great portion of those who managed to survive became virtually invisible , dwarfed by booming Anglo cities , relegated to the role of migrant farm laborers in huge agribusinesses . Dwelling as they do on small , remote reservations and rancherias , outside access to their contemporary stories has been limited to the stuff of dry doctoral dissertations and scholarly articles . Until now . In among the most dramatic one-two literary_genre punches_in recent memory ( Toni Morrison ' s simultaneous 1992 publication of &quot; Jazz &quot; and &quot; Playing in the Dark &quot; comes_to_mind ) , Greg Sarris , a professor of English at UCLA and himself a mixture of California ethnicities ( Filipino , Jewish , Miwok ) , has written a dazzling pair of books , one superb fiction , the other a mesmerizing interplay of biography and autobiography . Read individually , each is a spotlight trained on the complexity , sadness , humor and strength of modern Pomo people ; read in tandem , they vault Sarris ' subjects -- and the author himself -- into brilliant , enduring relief . &quot; Grand Avenue &quot; is a thematically linked collection of 10 stories , each one complete and startling in itself , that moves_back and forward in time as it gives eloquent and searing voice to the interacting Pomo , Portuguese , and African American communities of Santa Rosa in Northern California . In a vivid blend of street-smart toughness and traditional spirituality , we hear the varying perspectives of men and women , old and young , on the ways that poverty disrupts relationships , does violence to every social institution , forges an anger that , unchecked , can erode even the impulse of kindness . &quot; Grand Avenue &quot; is a gritty , power-filled book , unsparing and unapologetic . Sarris has too_much respect for his characters to feel sorry_for them , but is too sympathetic to the grim and inexorable realities of their situations to be dispassionate . It is a book to read once for story , a second time to better understand how the pieces perfectly fit together and illuminate each other , a third time for the sheer pleasure of fine writing . &quot; Grand Avenue &quot; is not only one of the very best works of fiction by and about Native_Americans , it ' s one of the most important imaginative books of the year , period . Listen , for instance , to a young_girl just moved to unexpected violence describe the staged scene when the police respond to a report of gunfire . &quot; I looked_at Justine . She was lifting a neat piece of chocolate_cake to her mouth with a plastic fork . Her I ' d have to reckon with on account I upset her show . I looked_at mom and the boys . They was eating cake , too . Auntie was still talking , painting that picture of us not capable of nothing . I seen the cops looking_at the table while she talked . I seen what they seen , what Auntie was saying . But I seen more . I seen everything. &quot; Or a mother , dealing with the fact of her daughter ' s terminal diagnosis : &quot; I took myself to the library , read books , learned so_much about the disease I came_to speak its language , which is a hollow tongue of numbers and strange words . that ' s why Doctor Kriesel goes_on with me about counts and cells . But I moved beyond her . I read about Laetrile , coffee enemas , diets of brown_rice and sprouts , support groups . None of which I had time or money for . Visualization seemed the ticket . It ' s free for the effort . Picture the body healthy . See flowers and things . Green is a good color. &quot; Where , we wonder , does Sarris find this acute insider ' s ear , so precise in its cadence ? The answer -- that he is a master listener -- is amply provided in his simultaneously published , equally amazing nonfiction work . Ostensibly the &quot; as told to &quot; biography of the eponymous late , world-renowned Pomo basket weaver , &quot; Mabel McKay &quot; is an honest , heartfelt testament comparable in its authenticity and grace to such standard texts as Paul Radin ' s &quot; Crashing Thunder &quot; and , especially , to Nancy Lurie ' s &quot; Mountain Wolf Woman. &quot; Mabel McKay is a character in every sense of the term : wise , iconoclastic , demanding , a self-conscious author to the story of_her_own life . Born in a Pomo community and raised by her very traditional grandmother , she held a variety of jobs , from Charleston dancer in a carnival to university lecturer on native California crafts . Through it all , however , she was primarily shaped and informed by the Dream -- her vocation as a medicine woman and healer . She chose astutely in selecting Greg Sarris as her chronicler , picking him out first as a confused young boy in Santa Rosa and then maintaining close contact as he went_to university and became an academic . One has the sense that she kept him grounded , taught him sense while he learned facts , and indeed Sarris takes the great risk of relating his own unfolding journey in counterpart to recounting Mabel ' s -- a decision that enriches and personalizes the whole . While Mabel McKay is undeniably an individual like no other , her experience is emblematic of the transition of_her_own and similar tribes . She bridges chasms of paradox and technology , of intuitive and science-based methods of understanding , with the easy aplomb of a person secure in her own identity and capable of absorbing without being absorbed by the disparate events of her experience . She is confident , funny , domineering and indelible , an internationally acclaimed designer of exquisite feather baskets who still toiled almost every day in a cannery . She is a worker of miracles who is practical enough to prescribe calamine_lotion for poison_ivy . She ' s the irreverent , revered elder , the preserver and expander of culture , the heart and the soul of the modern Native_American dynamic . To say that Greg Sarris does Mabel McKay justice is to say a great_deal . He renders her story with respect and candor in a novelist ' s prose . She comes_to_life in all her complexity , a woman as compelling and full-bodied as any of the fictional creations of &quot; Grand Avenue &quot; -- a book , I ' d bet , she ' d display on her kitchen_table , to brag about .</TEXT>
