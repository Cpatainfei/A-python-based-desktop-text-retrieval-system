   <HEADLINE> WORLD IN BRIEF ; BRITAIN ; LONDON CLARIFIES PEACE OFFER TO IRA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Britain issued clarifications to the IRA ' s political ally , Sinn Fein , on the Northern_Ireland peace plan and said the changes mean there is now no excuse for further violence or &quot; playing for time. &quot; Sinn Fein said parts of the response , the first public document from British ministers to the Sinn Fein leadership , were encouraging . The document gave a substantive point-by-point reply -- but little ground -- to 20 questions sent last week by Sinn Fein . The symbolic concession of replying to Sinn Fein ' s questions makes_it harder for the_Irish Republican Army to say that the peace declaration agreed to Dec . 15 by the_British and Irish governments is unclear and contradictory .</TEXT>
