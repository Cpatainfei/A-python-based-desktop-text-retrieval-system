   <HEADLINE> BOSNIA SERB LEADER WARNS ON DANGERS OF PEACE PLAN ; BALKANS : THE MUSLIM-CROATIAN PARLIAMENT BACKS THE INTERNATIONAL PROPOSAL THAT WOULD SPLIT THE COUNTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Bosnian Serb officials met Monday in their mountain stronghold of Pale to debate whether to accept an international peace plan to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina among the warring parties , their leader , Radovan Karadzic , warned that the take-it-or-else proposal could be disastrous for the whole Serbian nation . In his opening address to the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb assembly , Karadzic denounced the peace plan , saying that &quot; this was now or never for the whole Serbian nation. &quot; Meantime , in Sarajevo , the rival Bosnian Parliament -- made_up of Muslims and Croats -- endorsed the peace proposal , which would give them 51 % of Bosnia , leaving Serbs with the rest . A separate , Muslim Parliament backed the plan earlier Monday . But the Bosnian Serbs , who in more_than two years of war have captured more_than 70 % of Bosnia , have indicated they are unwilling to relinquish their military gains . Bosnian Serb forces , backed by the Yugoslav army , launched their war against Bosnian independence in April , 1992 , declaring that they hoped to join with their Serbian kin in the Balkans to create a Greater Serbia . &quot; If we reject the plan , we must prepare ourselves to reject all attacks by our enemies , but also to move_into enemy territory in the shortest possible time to completely and utterly defeat our foes , &quot; Karadzic told the Bosnian Serbs . He added that if they rebuff international peace efforts , &quot; we are threatened with the continuation of the war in far more difficult circumstances for us in which Muslims would be better-armed . There will be a battle for life and death . We will have blood , sweat and tears and we will be alone in the world. &quot; Indeed , the powerful nations that put_forward the present plan -- dubbed the &quot; last chance for peace &quot; -- have told all_the Bosnian warring parties they will face punitive international steps if they reject this latest effort to end the war , which has claimed about 200 # 000 lives . The United Nations already has imposed some sanctions in the Balkans , especially against the rump Yugoslavia , now made_up of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro . The United States , Russia , Germany , France and Britain have said the Bosnian Serbs would see even tougher measures if they rejected the latest peace plan . The Muslim-led Bosnian government also would have been subject_to further international steps had its president , Alija Izetbegovic , not recommended that his assembly back the plan -- &quot; not because it is good or will end the war &quot; but because it would give the Muslim-led government troops a better chance to &quot; end the war successfully , &quot; he said . The lawmakers agreed , with only 17 of 160 deputies in the Sarajevo Parliament rejecting the plan . The United States and its North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization partners have indicated that if the Bosnian Serbs balk at the peace proposal , the West may be prepared to lift its weapons embargo on the Muslim-Croatian alliance and give it logistics support in its attempt to recapture Serb-held territory . As for Karadzic , he reportedly was summoned here on the eve of his session with other Bosnian Serbs for a last-ditch effort by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to persuade his former proteges to endorse the peace plan . Milosevic wants to get international sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia lifted . But this will not happen as long as the Bosnian war drags_on and his regime supports Karadzic . But in a clear indication that the rift between Karadzic and his erstwhile mentor is widening , Bosnian Serb officials scorned the peace plan Monday . &quot; We want more_than we have now , &quot; said Dragan Milanovic , a Bosnian Serb official . &quot; We want more ( land ) than we hold now . We cannot live like this . . . . The Muslims would hold too_much under the plan. &quot; Milan Ninkovic , another Bosnian Serb , said he and other officials might seek a referendum on the peace plan -- a delaying tactic Karadzic has been criticized for suggesting before in response to other peace plans . But &quot; if the world does not accept this ( referendum ) , the Serbs are ready for a big war , &quot; Ninkovic said .</TEXT>
