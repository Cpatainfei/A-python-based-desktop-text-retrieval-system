   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES / LILLEHAMMER ; U.S. COMES BACK TO TIE FRANCE , 4-4 ; HOCKEY : TWO GOALS IN THE THIRD_PERIOD MAKE_UP FOR TWO EARLIER REPLAY CALLS A GAINST THE AMERICANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They saw their 4-4 tie with France as a form of justice , that by scoring two late and improbable goals against goaltender Petri Ylonen on Sunday , they were rewarded for their tenacity and granted retribution for calls that had gone_against them . Yet no one on the U.S. Olympic hockey_team acknowledged how lucky it was that Ylonen fanned on Peter Laviolette ' s 60-foot flip shot with 8:37 to play in their tournament opener , or how doubly blessed they were when Ylonen misjudged Brian Rolston ' s wrist shot from deep on the left side with 6:02 to play . Tenacious ? Maybe . A lesser team might have given_up after a short-handed breakaway by Pierrick Maia put France ahead , 4-2 , at 7:48 of the third_period before 8 # 145 at Hakon Hall . Nervous , tentative and utterly ineffective on seven consecutive power_plays ? Absolutely . Without Ylonen ' s shaky play , the U.S. team , seeded sixth in the 12-team field , would be near the bottom of its group . Thanks to Ylonen , the U.S. stands_in a cluster of four teams tied for second behind Group_B leader Canada . &quot; I guess he was letting_in goals he should have let_in in the first and second_period , &quot; Rolston said of Ylonen . &quot; That goalie , I take my hat off to him . He played a great game in the first two periods . You definitely question yourself when you dominate the first two periods and you ' re not ahead . You definitely shake your head. &quot; Said defenseman Brett Hauer , whose holding penalty with 1:56 to play made the final minutes tense : &quot; People ask me how upset and disappointed we are . You ' ve got_to realize we were two goals down . We ' re not jumping up and down , but we showed a lot of character to come_back and get the tie . &quot; I think we played a good game . At times we ' re going to get running_around . This is a huge ice surface and European teams are good at holding onto the puck and delaying it and chipping it in . . . . We fought through the tough replay decisions , whether right or wrong , and we showed a lot of character. &quot; They needed character and resilience to pull even with the 10th-seeded French team , which had only 14 shots on Mike Dunham compared to 32 at Ylonen . They also needed resilience to overcome their disappointment when an apparent goal by Peter Ciavaglia was disallowed at 8:22 of the second_period . Referee Marko Lepaus of Finland , after consulting replays , ruled Ciavaglia used his right foot to direct a shot by Ted Crowley into the net , waving_off a goal that would have given the United States a 3-1 lead . France , which had benefited from a replay on its first goal -- a shot by Christophe Ville that bounced off Frank Saunier ' s skate -- tied the score in the second_period and surged ahead in the third . &quot; To come from behind as we did , from being down two goals , was somewhat of a moral victory for our young team , &quot; U.S. Coach Tim Taylor said . &quot; For the most part , we played the kind of game we wanted to play . We had a lot of pressure in the_French end . Unfortunately , we were ineffective on the power_play , and that was our downfall tonight . Five on five we had a huge edge_in shots and chances. &quot; At 5:04 of the first_period , John Lilley converted Mark Beaufait ' s pass-out from behind the net . France pulled even at 15:16 , but the United States regained the lead when Peter Ferraro ' s shot dribbled through Ylonen ' s pads . Hauer ' s turnover in the neutral zone led to France ' s second goal , at 18:07 of the second_period . Franck Pajonkowski broke_away from Hauer and Ferraro for a shot that ticked_off Dunham ' s pad . &quot; I should have had that one and the third one , &quot; Dunham said of Banjamin Agnel ' s wrist shot at 2:36 of the third_period . &quot; It ' s tough to get_into the game when they have only four shots in the first_period . I felt_like I was back at ( the University of ) Maine , where I ' d get only five , six , seven shots a period because we were down at the other end. &quot; Maia ' s shorthanded goal from the right circle let Dunham and the other U.S. players know they were in a tougher game than they had expected even though they had played a 4-4 tie with France on Feb . 5 in a pre-Olympic tournament in Rouen . &quot; We have to take the positive out of it , &quot; Dunham said . &quot; I know I feel a lot better now with one game behind me . You can prepare all you want , but I finally got_out there and realized what was going_on and what was at stake and I was a little nervous . It was a game I was playing not to lose . &quot; We know we ' re a good team and we should have won tonight . They played a solid game , but I think if we keep playing the way we did offensively , we ' ll be all right. &quot;</TEXT>
