   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : ITALY ; TROTTING THROUGH TUSCANY ; A RIDER FROM THE BIG CITY DISCOVERS THE RUSTIC PLEASURES OF THE CHIANTI REGION , EXPLORED AT THE SPEED OF ONE HORSEPOWER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The brochure promised breathtaking scenery , exquisite home-cooked meals and willing , courageous horses -- but nobody warned me about saddle_sores . When my friend Diane Cooper suggested I come_along with her on a horseback ride through Italy ' s Tuscan countryside for one week last October , her enthusiasm was so catching that the inevitable consequence of such a long stint in the saddle was the furthest thing from my mind . So I called Equitour , a Wyoming-based riding company that was organizing her trip , only to be told participants needed at least one year of English-style riding experience . Living_in a big city , I don ' t get many opportunities to ride a horse , but I swiftly swept aside their concerns that I might not be qualified , regaling them with tales of learning to ride during summer_camp as a kid . Suitably convinced , they added me on , and I spent the next couple of weeks in a frenzy of preparation , gathering_up all_the gear I thought I would need for the challenge ahead . After arriving in Florence and touring the city for three days , Diane and I headed to the Florence train_station , where we had arranged to meet Jenny Bawtree , founder of Rendola Riding and host of our upcoming adventure . Our fears that we would n ' t spot her in the busy station crowd quickly proved unfounded when we saw a woman standing alone , waving a horseshoe enthusiastically in the air . We introduced ourselves , handed_over our bags and boarded the train for Montevarchi , a town about 20 miles south of Florence . Along the way , Jenny , who is originally from England , told us how she came_to this part of Italy for a visit more_than 20 years ago -- and never left . She impressed me at once as both serious and passionate about her horses , and it was plain to see that they were her primary concern , with the riders coming_in a distant second , at best . Clearly , I would be expected to hold my own . Pushing all thoughts of cowardice and injury aside , I silently vowed that I would not let her down . As our train pulled into the Montevarchi station , we could see Pietro Pinti -- driver , cook and guardian_angel for our journey -- quietly waiting alongside the cherry-red company van that would take us to our new home . Twenty minutes over winding , narrow roads , through the tiny village of Rendola , population 49 , brought us to Jenny ' s beautiful 17th-Century farmhouse and stables . We were given our rooms -- nicely furnished in a country style and with a private bath -- and left alone to wash_up , unpack our things and meet with the other riders as they drifted in . The dinner_bell rang , and all nine of us sat_down to a typical Tuscan spread : fettuccine in a fresh tomato and cream_sauce , a delicious veal dish cooked with wild mushrooms picked earlier that day from the surrounding woods , fresh green_salad , crusty bread and as much of the local Chianti wine as we could handle . It was a fabulous feast , and as I reached for yet another helping of everything , I wondered whether by the end of this week I would be trimmer from all_the exercise or as wide as my horse from all_the good food . The next morning we gathered at the stables , eager to embark_on our first ride . After much initial checking on Jenny ' s part to ensure the safety of both horse and rider , we set_off . The first day we rode near Rendola so everyone could get used to the horses and , I suspect , allow Jenny to make_sure we all knew what we were doing . We worked our way through the olive groves , tangled vineyards and lush , green woodlands of the Arno valley . Although it was all quite beautiful , I must confess that the bulk of my attention was dedicated to staying_on top of my horse . As my muscles made hundreds of tiny adjustments in an attempt to find peace with all this new pain , I wondered if my illustrious summer-camp riding experience was ever going_to kick_in and help get me through the long week ahead . After nearly five hours of riding , we returned to Rendola for hot showers and clean clothes . Feeling pretty good about myself for having survived such a long day in the saddle , dignity intact , I was soon brought_down a_few notches when Jenny pointed_out over dinner that much longer , tougher days lay ahead . Turning my attention to the other riders , I asked what had led each of them to sign_up for this trip . I was most intrigued by Stanley Craddock , a slight , gray-haired Englishman with a deceptively non-athletic style who , at 72 , was the oldest member of our group . He seemed kind of shy at first , but when I asked him why he came_on this trip he turned_to me with a grin like the Cheshire Cat and said , &quot; I always wanted to be a singing cowboy when I grew up. &quot; The others were all from the United States , which I ' m told is unusual ; typically the tour groups are a mix of Americans , English and Europeans . Despite bouts of jet_lag and the weariness of our first long ride , the dinner conversation became a whole_lot livelier as the Chianti continued to flow . It was the perfect opportunity to get_to know more about my ad-hoc family , including Stanley , a retired schoolteacher and skilled horseman who has taken numerous other pack trips internationally . He would serve as our unofficial guide during the trip -- offering advice about our horses and background on places we visited . After that first day , we set_off on the route that would wind through three provinces and eight villages in the Chianti Classico wine region -- a distance of roughly 100 miles traveling on dirt paths , on an occasional paved road and cross-country through fields and forest . Any traveler passing_through would be hard-pressed not to see the commitment and passion the Tuscan people have for their wines . It was harvest_time , and everywhere we went we saw people working their vineyards and presses , and when we stopped , they offered us samples of their wines with great pride . Each day became another breathtaking variation of the last , as we steadily worked our way through vineyards and olive groves , up the forested slopes of Monte San Michele , the highest point in the Chianti Mountains , and back_down through the wooded hills and ancient villages visited so_long ago by Dante , Boccaccio , Machiavelli and da Vinci . We passed so many medieval castles , churches and abbeys that I soon began to feel almost hypnotized , as if the scenery was swirling all around me and I was standing perfectly still . Every now and then we would take short breaks to enjoy the views and learn a little of the history and traditions of Tuscany . We stopped at the ancient village of Volpaia , with its castle , medieval hostel and famous wine shop . The horses took a break while we stretched our legs and counted the cats that seemed to be posted at virtually every window and doorway . One night our horses were put_up in the stables of a long-abandoned medieval villa called Torricella , where the renowned astronomer , Galileo was welcomed in his exile by the Baron Ricasoli , descendant of a famous powerful family who owned all_the surrounding land . I looked_up at the million or two tiny stars , imagining what he might have seen from the same spot . The next day we rode_on , passing endless rows of grapevines . All around us were the remnants of an era long gone -- ruins of homes , farmhouses and castles built when Florence and Siena were bitter feuding city-states that played_out their battles on Chianti soil and where horses carried well-armed soldiers , not camera-wielding tourists . We encircled the 800-year-old Castle Brolio , home of the Ricasoli family , whose ancestor Baron Bettino Ricasoli invented the method for producing Chianti wine in the early 19th Century . The woods of Tuscany are thick_with wild_boar , the evidence of which we saw not only in cloven-hoof tracks but also in the unending stream of hunters , rifles at their sides , who closely followed them . Jenny had effectively quelled our fears about trekking through this area during hunting_season by instructing us to sing loudly as we passed_through the more popular hunting_grounds . Because it had rained a_few weeks earlier and the roads were muddy , our pace was slowed , preventing the frequent canters promised by Equitour ' s brochure . Indeed , Jenny ' s usual route had to be altered on a_couple_of occasions to circumvent washed-out bridges and knee-deep mud . Luckily , most of the rain had passed_through by the time our trip began , and the one afternoon that found us riding straight through an unavoidable cluster of rain_clouds also brought with it some of the most breathtaking landscapes we had witnessed all week . Our usual routine was to ride for three or four hours in the morning , by which time we would be quite hungry -- and sorely ( literally ) in need of a rest . Just when I thought I couldn ' t possibly go another step , we would spot white-haired Pietro standing proudly beside yet another grilled lunch or picnic spread , red-checkered tablecloth laid_out , Chianti uncorked and espresso pot steaming . One day when the temperature had dropped fairly suddenly , leaving us unprepared and shivering around the fire , Pietro rummaged through the van and pulled_out a big bag of woolen sweaters , which he silently , almost paternally , distributed all around . Evenings found us at various inns along the way . We stayed for two nights near the town of Radda at Podere Terreno , an Italian-style bed and breakfast built around a magnificent 400-year-old farmhouse . Our hosts , Roberto Melosi and Sylvie Haniez , excelled_at both cooking and conversation . Meals were served family-style at one long table in front of a gigantic fireplace , surrounded by paintings , antiques and the many different types of wine made on their farm . Riding_on , we spent the next two nights on the outskirts of Siena at Il Poderaccio , a private villa with apartments offering spectacular views of that ancient medieval city . One morning had been set_aside for strolling , horseless , through the walled confines of Siena . Although I had been looking_forward to the change in our routine , I found myself growing impatient with all_the other tourists and missing the pace that only riding along fields and trails on horseback can deliver . On our last night back at Rendola I felt a mixture of melancholy and relief : The former because the trip seemed to end too quickly , the latter , saddle_sores aside , because I had lived to tell the tale . We spent a busy evening swapping anecdotes and addresses with the other riders and writing last-minute postcards . Back home , where friends check their date books before committing to a cup of coffee , it ' s easy to lose sight of how the rest of the world lives . In Tuscany , with its more relaxed pace , there was time to get_to know the the local people , eat_at their tables , drink their wines and weave our way , at one-horsepower speed , in and around their turf .
