   <HEADLINE> ARABS SAY SOLDIERS KILLED AT LEAST 1 AT HEBRON MOSQUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Arab judges and lawyers investigating the Hebron massacre for the PLO said Wednesday that they believe soldiers fired at people and caused at least one death at the mosque , despite denials by Israeli officers . Abdel Ghani Awawi , a lawyer on the 11-member Palestine Liberation Organization panel looking_into the massacre , said the PLO panel agrees with the Israeli army that 34 Arabs were shot dead in Hebron on Feb . 25 . The PLO panel , which is boycotting the Israeli government inquiry into the massacre , counted 28 people killed by an Israeli settler inside the mosque . It said army gunfire killed one Arab outside the mosque , one in the nearby cemetery and four outside Ahli Hospital . Israeli military_officers testified at an official Israeli inquiry last week that the settler killed 29 people inside the mosque and that soldiers killed four outside the hospital and one in a neighborhood behind the mosque . They denied reports that soldiers shot at people trying to flee the mosque . But three Palestinian witnesses said Diab Karaki , 23 , was shot dead by soldiers as he fled the mosque . Amin Khalil Joulani , 17 , said he was shot in the legs by soldiers at the mosque entrance .</TEXT>
