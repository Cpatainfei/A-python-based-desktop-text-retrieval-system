   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; SHELLED MARKET NOT SOLE SPUR TO INTERVENTION ; BOSNIA : FORCES HAVE ERODED THE WEST ' S LARGELY PASSIVE POSITION AND PUSHED IT CLOSER TO A NEW , MORE ACTIVE ROLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For months , as snipers picked_off pedestrians and artillerymen cut_down children at play in Sarajevo , the United States and its European allies seemed paralyzed -- their vaunted power unused , their diplomacy wasted in empty threats and sterile bickering over whose fault it was . Now , finally , the great_powers of the West say they are getting serious about lifting the siege of Sarajevo . They are preparing a demand for the removal of artillery from the mountains around the city , and threatening air strikes to enforce the order . What has brought Washington and its allies to the brink of action after blinking away so_much violence , brutality and death ? Was it really just the happenstance of a single mortar shell that fell_into a crowded outdoor market last Saturday , killing 68 shoppers near the old stone bridge where World_War I began ? &quot; Don ' t underestimate the impact of that , &quot; a White_House official said . &quot; We all saw it . It killed more people than had been killed in any one incident . And it came exactly three weeks after the President of the United States told NATO that it shouldn ' t threaten air strikes if it didn ' t mean it. &quot; Yet much as the grisly scene served as a catalyst , other forces were already at_work eroding the West ' s largely passive position and pushing it closer to a new , more active role . The tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina has refused to yield to rhetoric or simple diplomacy . And it has relentlessly exposed the inability of the West ' s humanitarian efforts to achieve anything like humane results . At a tactical level , there has been a growing recognition that Sarajevo could not hold_out forever . Added_to that is the slow deterioration of the U.N. forces ' capacity to deliver relief aid , accompanied by escalating attacks on peacekeeping troops by all three Bosnian factions . And there was the sinking realization , as one U.S. diplomat put it , that &quot; whatever we did , we couldn ' t do much worse. &quot; Whether the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization will actually carry_out its new threat to take military_action after failing to back_up earlier warnings , and whether air strikes can succeed in deterring further attacks on the civilians of Sarajevo , remain to be seen . Even less certain is whether relieving the city ' s punishing siege will do much to end the war that has killed more_than 200 # 000 people in less than two years . Some diplomats even worry that saving Sarajevo could have an unintended side_effect : encouraging the Muslim-led Bosnian government to harden its stand_in peace negotiations and further slow the snail ' s-pace progress toward compromise . Still , as NATO meets today in Brussels to consider a new strategy , the alliance ' s key members have already moved several steps closer to military intervention against the Bosnian Serbs -- an act that would be a watershed in the sad history of halfhearted Western attempts to stop the killing . &quot; We have moved , the_British have moved , the_French have moved , &quot; a senior State_Department official said . &quot; We still hope air strikes won ' t be necessary . But if you took a poll , four out of five officials working_on this think we will end_up using force. &quot; The proposed NATO plan , a combination of U.S. , British and French ideas , would order the Bosnian Serbs to move all artillery and other heavy_weapons at least 20 kilometers from Sarajevo -- about 13 miles , a distance intended to put the city out of range . They would be given seven to 10 days to comply , officials said . At the same time , NATO would order the Bosnian government to turn_over to U.N. peacekeepers all heavy_weapons inside the city . NATO would threaten to destroy any armored vehicle , mortar or artillery piece found inside the 20-kilometer zone after the deadline , the officials said . &quot; We have been ready for this kind of use of force for some time , but this time we think the Europeans are ready too , &quot; a U.S. official said . Along with the ultimatum in Sarajevo , the Clinton_Administration has agreed to European pleas to work more actively for a negotiated settlement in the war , officials said . Until now , the United States attended the negotiations as an observer , but refused to give any real support to the Europeans ' peace plan , which would divide Bosnia into Serbian , Croatian and Muslim republics -- accepting , in the process , Serbian forces ' conquest of large segments of what was formerly Muslim land . Even before Saturday ' s attack , the United States and its allies had been moving toward a more energetic effort to relieve the siege of Sarajevo and restart the peace talks , officials said . That work began in_earnest Feb . 1 , when British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher that Europe wanted more U.S. leadership on the issue , U.S. and British officials said . Hurd also convinced Christopher that the European Union was willing to agree to a U.S. demand that the peace talks avoid putting pressure on the Bosnian Muslims . But the weekend massacre gave both sides a mighty push , officials said . It stepped_up pressure from Congress , European parliaments and the public for action . A CNN / USA Today poll released Tuesday found that 48 % of Americans favored allied air strikes in Bosnia , against 43 % opposed -- a switch from before the massacre , when a Los Angeles Times poll found 33 % in favor and 48 % opposed . U.S. diplomats were still seeking agreement from two countries reluctant to sign_on : Russia , a U.N. Security_Council member with historic and cultural ties to Serbs , and Canada , a NATO member that fears its 2 # 000 peacekeeping troops in Bosnia might become targets for retaliation if air strikes occur . Many in Congress remained skeptical too . &quot; If you embark_on this policy , you had better be able to tell the American people what you do if it fails -- what is the other option if this doesn ' t work , &quot; said Sen . John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) , a conservative member of the Senate Armed Services Committee . But Gen . John Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , said that air strikes could be counted as a success even if they merely reduced the shelling . &quot; Air_power alone cannot bomb someone into a peace agreement , &quot; Shalikashvili told the Armed Services Committee . Times staff writers Stanley Meisler at the United Nations and Art Pine in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
