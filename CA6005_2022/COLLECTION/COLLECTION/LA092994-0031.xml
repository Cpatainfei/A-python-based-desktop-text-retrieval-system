   <HEADLINE> ONE OF THE DUMBER IDEAS AROUND ; LET RUSSIA SELL CHEAP HANDGUNS IN THE UNITED STATES ? PLEASE . . .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Looming just over the horizon as a potential threat to regional peace and security is Iran , which has been spending a lot of money buying military weapons and technology , including the stuff that could one day help produce nuclear arms . As it happens , Russia has been one of Iran ' s major suppliers , selling Tehran ' s theocratic regime warplanes , tanks , submarines and missile technology . These sales are worth about $ 1 billion a year , no mean amount to a country whose export earnings have fallen precipitately . The Clinton_Administration , alert to the possible dangers posed by a still aggressively radical Iran , has been urging Moscow to end or severely reduce these sales . President Boris N . Yeltsin said in Washington Wednesday that Russia would . The United States , in compensation , is thinking_about letting Russia export to the United States a number , perhaps a large_number , of one of the few products its factories make besides vodka that seem sure to find eager customers in the American market : semiautomatic_pistols . Here , surely , is one of the dumber ideas in recent memory . That it is even being seriously considered is a disheartening comment on the quality of creative thinking within the Clinton_Administration . One U.S. importer has applied to sell as_many as 7 million Russian firearms . The Treasury_Department ' s Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms is less than enthusiastic . The State_Department , however , thinks that allowing some measure of arms imports is a reasonable way to offset Russian hard currency losses if arms sales to Iran are in fact cut_back . As one official rationalized it to The Times , &quot; if we want them to listen to us on issues like Iran , we have to let them compete on the world market with products they can sell. &quot; Well , yes . But with handguns , in our market ? No , thank_you . With an estimated 212 million firearms now extant in the United States -- one-third of them handguns -- and with violent crime at the apex of public concerns , surely it ' s evident that the U.S. arms market is saturated and that opening the gates to yet more cheaply priced weapons is emphatically not in the national interest . Those in the Clinton_Administration who are sympathetic to this bizarre idea because they are eager to do Moscow a favor have looked_at Russian trade figures and asked , &quot; Why not ? &quot; What they really ought to be doing is taking another look_at American homicide figures and asking , &quot; Why ? &quot;</TEXT>
