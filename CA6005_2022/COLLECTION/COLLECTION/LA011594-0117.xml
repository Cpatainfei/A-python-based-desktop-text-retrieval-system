   <HEADLINE> IN JAPAN , PARENTS PLAY DEVIL ' S ADVOCATE IN NAMING CHILD ; CONTROVERSY : COUPLE FIGHTS AUTHORITIES ' BAN ON SATANIC MONIKER . NOW THE CABINET HAS GOTTEN INVOLVED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; A Boy Named Sue , &quot; the American country_music classic , plays the name game for laughs . But in Japan , a real boy , who really is named Devil , has become a serious matter for bureaucrats . And Friday , the case -- which has turned_into a battle over whether parents have the inalienable right to name their children or whether the government can intervene -- reached the attention of Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ' s Cabinet . The bedeviling case began when Shigeharu Sato , 30 , and his wife , Ayako , 22 , went_to register their first-born son as Akuma ( Devil ) last August . Authorities in Akishima , a town within Tokyo , initially agreed to list the name in the family register , a move that gives it official recognition in Japan . But two months later , higher officials , citing fears the boy would be subjected_to ridicule and discrimination , overruled the judgment and asked the couple to choose another name . These officials called the Satos ' selection &quot; an abuse of the right of parents to name a child &quot; and said the earlier decision to allow it ran against &quot; healthy social concepts. &quot; The Satos , intent_on their choice , have taken the case to Family Court , which will decide the_matter , possibly next week . But in an indicator of Japanese sensitivities on the issue , Justice Minister Akira Mikazuki , in a Cabinet meeting Friday , spoke out about Devil , opposing the official intervention in the boy ' s naming via an &quot; administrative guidance , &quot; a ruling made without specific legal basis . &quot; It is not appropriate to instruct parents to change children ' s names without legal basis , &quot; Mikazuki said . But Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato defended the ruling , calling_for new legislation to empower such decisions explicitly . The two ministers agreed on one point : Devil is not a good name for a child . Naming a child in Japan is considered one of the biggest decisions parents make . Fortune-tellers are often consulted to ensure that lucky choices are made ; even the average bookstore has a special section jammed with do-it-yourself instruction_books on choosing a fortuitous name . The Satos made their decision without help . The father , who runs a snack restaurant , said he picked the name to show he wants his son , whatever he became in the future , to &quot; stand at the top. &quot; He also wanted his son to have a name different from other boys and was sure that &quot; there will be only one Japanese with this name , &quot; he told Japanese reporters . &quot; If you hear it once , you ' ll never forget the name . . . . It is the best possible name , &quot; Sato said , adding he intended to raise Devil in a way to overcome any bullying that he might suffer . His wife , he admitted , was &quot; surprised &quot; but agreed to the name . The couple call Devil , who was born July 30 , by the nickname Aku , the equivalent of &quot; Dev &quot; in English . The baby , still officially nameless , already responds to that name . Children in Japan officially may_not change their given names until they reach age 15 . Sato told reporters he has already chosen a name for a second son : Teio ( Emperor ) . He said he would choose &quot; an ordinary cute name &quot; for a daughter .</TEXT>
