   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON : GRAMERCY SHINES AS CINDERELLA OF SUNDANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If past Sundance Film Festivals are remembered for launching individual careers , this one may become equally well known for helping to launch an entire company . Gramercy Pictures has emerged as a Cinderella of Sundance , thanks to two high-profile films . &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral , &quot; an offbeat comedy starring Andie MacDowell , got the prized opening-night slot . And &quot; Backbeat , &quot; which traces the formative years of the Beatles , is so_much in_demand that the festival has scheduled a rare extra screening . With both movies opening in the spring , the independent marketing and distribution company hopes the positive buzz from Sundance will translate into financial success . &quot; You never know which movies are going_to click , but festivals can be pretty good gauges , &quot; said Russell Schwartz , Gramercy ' s president . Eighteen-month-old Gramercy , a joint_venture of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Universal Pictures , is still looking_for its first breakaway hit in the specialized film market . Last year ' s &quot; Posse &quot; did modestly well , taking_in $ 18 million at domestic box_offices . But &quot; King of the_Hill , &quot; &quot; A Dangerous Woman &quot; and &quot; Dazed and Confused &quot; got cool receptions . People who follow the rough-and-tumble world of independent film distribution see better potential in this year ' s 13-picture slate from Gramercy , which also includes the controversial comedy-thriller &quot; Romeo Is Bleeding. &quot; Gramercy celebrated its Sundance success Sunday with a dinner at Adolph ' s , one of the most exotic restaurants in this snow-ringed ski resort -- with entree offerings such_as pheasant , bison , venison and medallion of elk . On hand was Michael Kuhn , president of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment , as well as executives from other PolyGram film labels and the producers of &quot; Backbeat &quot; -- the same team responsible_for last year ' s surprise hit &quot; The Crying Game. &quot; In a show of support , London-based PolyGram Chairman Alain Levy even dropped_in on the festival after taking the Concorde to New York . Kuhn said PolyGram is optimistic that its investment in Gramercy will begin to pay_off this year . &quot; It ' s hard to judge a company based on so few movies , &quot; Kuhn said , &quot; but they ' ve certainly got some good stuff in the can. &quot; Schwartz avoided making any predictions . He said the past year taught him a lot about the vagaries of the business . In the case of &quot; Dazed and Confused , &quot; a look_at the drug-hazy lives of high_school students in the 1970s , Schwartz said he learned that young people no longer necessarily respond to antiheroes . One marketing ploy aimed at the young , however , has the industry buzzing : a decision to recruit members of cutting-edge bands such_as Nirvana , Soul Asylum , R.E.M. and Afghan Wigs for the &quot; Backbeat &quot; soundtrack , under the direction of music producer Don Was . &quot; We ' re still honing the process , &quot; Schwartz said , &quot; but we ' ve learned a lot. &quot; * Fears that last week ' s earthquake might cut_into business at the festival appear to be unfounded . While many Hollywood deal makers won ' t arrive until the second_half of the 10-day event , business is already well under way . Sony Pictures Classics got things rolling Friday , the second day of the festival , when it acquired domestic and other rights to &quot; Martha and Ethel. &quot; Marcie Bloom , co-president of the company , said she first heard about director Jyl Johnstone ' s look_at former nannies while it was being processed at the lab . She attended the first screening Friday morning , before her partners arrived , and made the deal later in the day -- before she had even picked_up her festival credentials . &quot; It ' s just terrific ! &quot; Bloom said of the movie . &quot; It ' s really a sly social commentary on the family . Once people start talking_about the movie , the rest will take_care of itself. &quot; Samuel Goldwyn Co . followed on Saturday by acquiring worldwide rights to &quot; Go_Fish , &quot; an inside view of lesbian life shot in black_and_white by director Rose Troche . Goldwyn ' s Tom Rothman said the company moved quickly to preempt other bids . &quot; It ' s the old expression , ' You snooze , you lose , ' &quot; said Rothman , who had to fly back to Los Angeles when aftershocks threatened his home . &quot; This gives us the entire festival to publicize the movie. &quot; Rothman called &quot; Go_Fish &quot; one of the liveliest pictures at the festival . He said it also poses &quot; an exciting marketing challenge. &quot; The buying continued Monday , as I.R.S. picked_up the rights to the Canadian film &quot; I Love a Man in Uniform. &quot; Many films have come_to the festival with distributors attached , but deal makers are still_hunting for fresh directing and writing talent . Said one : &quot; They like to play_up the artsy aspects of the festival , but what everyone is looking_for is people with commercial potential. &quot; * Sundance also acknowledged technology ' s growing influence on film , with a seminar on Sunday called &quot; Interactivity and Cinema. &quot; Panelists Joe Miller , head of production for Sega America , noted that the domestic video_game business last year caught_up to the domestic box_office business , with about $ 5 billion in revenue . At the same time , Miller extended an olive_branch to the entertainment community by saying the video_game industry desperately needs Hollywood ' s storytelling skills . That brought an icy response from producer Sean Daniel . He said advancing technologies threaten to make second-class citizens of conventional filmmakers . &quot; The rebels of the future are going_to be those struggling to make linear movies -- that ' s going_to be the fringe , &quot; Daniel said . Referring to all_the options offered by interactive technology , Daniel added , &quot; I don ' t want an interactive ' Grand Illusion ' or ' Godfather. ' &quot;</TEXT>
