   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : QUESTIONS TO ASK AS THE NEW YEAR DAWNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s 1994 . Do you know where your investment plan is ? While Wall_Street is racking its collective brain trying to divine where stock prices and interest_rates are heading this year , your task should be much simpler : Making_sure you ' re positioned for any eventuality . That may be far less difficult than you might initially suspect . If you stop worrying about what you don ' t know and just take_care of the basics , investing -- at least , long-term investing -- becomes a fairly simple game . In his new book , &quot; Bogle on Mutual_Funds , &quot; John Bogle , head of mutual_fund giant Vanguard Group and a longtime champion of individual investors ' rights , lists 12 commandments of investing . The first one : &quot; Never forget that investing is easier than it looks. &quot; The second : &quot; When all else fails , fall_back on simplicity. &quot; Whether you ' re investing for the first time or looking_to improve your existing portfolio ' s prospects , here are some basic questions to ask yourself as the new year begins : * Do you have a plan ? Rather than lose sleep worrying whether stock and bond markets are going_up or down over the next 12 months , focus_on your long-term goals . You should have some kind of investment plan for the future mapped_out , either on paper or in your head . If you have a plan , the market ' s inevitable short-term gyrations won ' t freeze you into inaction . For example , have you thought_about how much you will be able to save and invest this year , realistically ? Have you nailed_down which investments you might like to buy ( or buy more of ) ? Are you prepared to make those investments -- in other words , have you done the necessary research ? In the case of mutual_funds , have you called the funds for applications and prospectuses so you have them on_hand ? Assuming you are a long-term investor , probably the smartest thing you can do is to get_on a dollar-cost-averaging plan , whereby you ' re investing small amounts on a monthly basis . That way , you needn ' t be concerned about market timing , and you ' re never at risk of investing too_much at what turns_out to be a market top . If you ' re investing via your company ' s 401 ( k ) retirement savings plan , you are already dollar-cost-averaging . Increase what you save via the plan , if possible . If you don ' t have a 401 ( k ) , many mutual_fund companies will help you set_up a regular investing plan . * Do you know what you own ? Sounds simple . Yet many people accumulate investments over time , without thinking_about how their entire portfolio fits together . Tally up your financial assets ( including retirement accounts , but not including your home ' s value ) , then calculate what percentage is invested in_stocks , in bonds , in short-term accounts ( CDs , money funds ) and in other investments . Does the mix make_sense for you ? Generally , the younger you are , the higher the percentage of your financial assets that should be invested in_stocks at any given time -- because stocks offer the best long-term returns . As you age , more of your portfolio should be shifted to fixed-income investments , because those securities offer more stability along with regular income . A simple rule_of_thumb is to subtract your age from 100 . The resulting number is the percentage of your financial assets that should be in_stocks ; the rest should be either in bonds , short-term accounts or other assets , or a combination of them . ( Note , however , that your personal situation may dictate having more or less in_stocks than what the rule_of_thumb would suggest. ) * How diversified are your stock investments ? With the U.S. market overall near record highs , you aren ' t diversified if your stock assets consist primarily of your employer ' s shares , or if you own just a single &quot; growth-stock &quot; mutual_fund . If you ' re a fund investor , many experts say you should own at least three distinctly different funds : one that invests primarily in_stocks of major U.S. companies ; one that invests mostly in smaller U.S. stocks , and one that invests in_stocks overseas . There ' s virtually no excuse not to have at least three funds ; nearly every major fund company offers those options , and minimum fund investments are mostly under $ 2 # 500 . How you should allocate money among those three categories depends_on how much risk you ' re willing to take . Aggressive investors might split that mix_in thirds ; more conservative types would probably limit the small-company and international funds each to 10 % or 15 % of their total portfolio . What if you ' re only beginning to diversify your stock fund dollars ? Do_it slowly , not all at once . For example , given the surge in international stock funds last year , they are vulnerable to a short-term selloff at some point this year , many pros agree . If you buy_in slowly and regularly , you ' ll be assured of picking_up shares during any selloff ; if those markets keep rising all year , you ' ll be investing all_the way up . * Do you have a hedge , should things go_wrong ? The U.S. bull_market is 38 months old , which is aged by historical standards . Likewise , interest_rates are near 20- to 30-year lows , which suggests there is as good a chance of them rising this year as falling further , especially if the economy is robust . So let ' s assume that rates move_up , and that that sparks a selloff in U.S. stocks . Do you have a hedge -- an investment that might rise even as stocks and bonds slide , offsetting some of your loss ? For small investors , a hedge might be as simple as having 5 % of your total portfolio in gold bullion ( because gold , up 17 % in price last year , could continue to benefit if investors take profits in_stocks and bonds and look_for an alternative. ) Scott Black , money manager at Delphi Capital in Boston , likes small U.S. energy stocks as a hedge . Oil sank_in price last year , but if the economy is stronger than expected this year -- bad for interest_rates , and possibly bad for many stocks -- energy prices could get a lift . Black likes such small exploration firms as Basin Exploration ( $ 11.375 on Nasdaq ) and Wiser Oil ( $ 17.50 , New York Stock_Exchange ) . ( Note also that many mutual_fund companies offer funds that invest exclusively in natural_resources companies . that ' s a way to bet_on higher commodity prices in a strong economy. ) David Shulman , investment strategist at Salomon Bros . in New York , says that for most investors , &quot; the best hedge is probably just to hold more cash than normal this year. &quot; That doesn ' t mean keeping 80 % of your assets in a money fund . But it may mean holding 20 % cash instead of 10 % . A bigger cash hedge would offset a market decline -- and would assure that you have the money available to invest if stock and bond prices suddenly dive to bargain levels . * Could you live with a worst-case scenario ? There are many reasons to think that 1994 will work_out just fine for Wall_Street -- that interest_rates will rise slowly if at all , and that stock prices can advance ( if fitfully ) as the economy and corporate profits improve . But what if the optimists are wrong ? Could you sit through a classic bear_market in_stocks ? Count up the money you now have in_stocks . If that sum suddenly lost 20 % of its value , would it change your life ? What about a 30 % or 40 % drop ? There have been 24 bear_markets since 1897 , and the average one has lasted 14.5 months and sliced 34 % off the Dow Jones industrial average , from peak to trough , according to the Chartist newsletter in Seal Beach . If you couldn ' t afford to see that percentage of your stock assets evaporate , then you should adjust your portfolio accordingly . Maybe you sell some stocks and move the proceeds into cash . Maybe you don ' t want to invest more in the market until prices come_down again , which they almost certainly will at some point . Maureen Tsu , a certified financial planner at Professional Financial Advisors in San Juan Capistrano , reminds her clients that investors who bought_at the stock_market peak in August , 1987 , waited two years to break_even . &quot; We talk to them and make_sure they have at least that kind of time frame , &quot; Tsu says . Similarly , bond investors should ask themselves how much of their principal value they ' re willing to sacrifice , should interest_rates rise . Consider : A long-term Treasury_bond that now yields 6.35 % would lose about 10 % of its value if market interest_rates on new bonds rise to 7.35 % . You would still be earning your 6.35 % on the older bond , regardless of what ' s happening with market rates . But if you can ' t stomach the idea of the bond itself being worth 10 % less in price , then you should devise a plan to exit that investment well before it loses that much of its value . Indeed , the smart investor never buys a security without first asking : &quot; How long am I planning to hold this ? And what would cause me to sell ? &quot; A Checklist for Paranoid Investors Is it time to sell stocks ? Not yet , says market_analyst Richard Eakle of Eakle Associates in Fair Haven , N.J. He has compiled a checklist of 20 indicators that tend to signal market tops . Of the 20 , only two currently suggest a top is here , Eakle says . Here are 12 of his indicators ( the other eight are more technical in nature ) . * Does economic evidence indicate an approaching peak in the business_cycle ? NO * Is inflation accelerating ? NO * Are corporate profits rising at an unsustainable rate ? NO * Are short-term interest_rates on the increase ? YES * Has the Federal_Reserve begun a more restrictive monetary policy ? NO * Is the stock_market ' s aggregate price-to-earnings ratio near that of its previous cyclical peak ? NO * Are mutual_fund cash reserves nearing historic lows ? NO * Have financial stocks peaked , only to fall_off during successive rallies in recent months ? YES * Have markets exhibited successive rallies to previous highs , only to retreat without making substantive additional gains ? NO * Have corporate_executives ( &quot; insiders &quot; ) begun selling vs . buying their own stocks at a ratio exceeding 3 to 1 ? NO * Is the number of NYSE issues trading above their 200-day moving averages nearing the historical danger level of 80 % ? NO * Is private and / or professional investor sentiment markedly over-optimistic ? NO Source : Eakle Associates</TEXT>
