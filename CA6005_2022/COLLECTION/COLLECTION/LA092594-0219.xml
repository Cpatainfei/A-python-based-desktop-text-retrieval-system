   <HEADLINE> LEARN AIMS TO INVOLVE PARENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Congratulations to teacher Adrienne Mack for her personal decision to vote for LEARN ( Valley Commentary , Sept . 18 ) . She correctly cited LEARN ' s objective as being that &quot; individual schools be given the opportunity to develop their own educational_programs , according to the needs of the community and the students they serve. &quot; Ms . Mack ' s article , however , missed LEARN ' s emphasis on the importance of actively supporting the participation of interested parents in the education of their children . U.S. Education_Secretary William Riley recently announced his national initiative in family involvement . The Washington Post has editorially commended Riley for his new parent-involvement initiative , saying parents can best shape their children ' s ability to benefit from formal schooling . The independent , nonprofit Parent Knowledge Network , whose policy research and demonstration programs are cited by Riley , found significant improvement in student achievement where informed parents work with teachers . LEARN was an early pioneer in advocating parent involvement and fully supports the national education goal embodied in federal law : that by 2000 every school promote programs that increase the participation of parents in the social , emotional and academic growth of their children . LEARN ' s programs include materials to inform parents about what their children should be learning at each grade level and guidelines on how parents can help . Ms . Mack also made reference_to LEARN as possibly another &quot; paper tiger &quot; whose &quot; faddish project &quot; will soon pass . This will come as a surprise to those community volunteers who have invested many thousands of hours developing grass-roots plans and action steps that empower parents and teachers to participate directly in the reform of their schools . We hope teachers will work just as diligently in their volunteer and paid efforts on behalf of all children in the Los Angeles city schools . WAYNE M .
