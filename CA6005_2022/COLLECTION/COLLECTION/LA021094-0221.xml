   <HEADLINE> STUDY SEES BENEFITS IN SMOG CHECK OVERHAUL ; POLLUTION : TEST-ONLY CENTERS ORDERED BY THE EPA WOULD CREATE 8 # 378 JOBS , ECONOMIC REPORT SAYS . OPPONENTS OF THE FEDERAL PLAN DISPUTE THE CLAIMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Overhauling California ' s Smog Check program as ordered by the Clinton_Administration would boost the state ' s economy by $ 2.1 billion and create 8 # 378 full-time jobs by 2002 , economic consultants claim in a new report . Funded by the American Lung Assn. , the economic study contradicts the fears of Gov . Pete Wilson and state lawmakers who oppose the federal effort , which would create a new network of test-only centers for checking California cars for excess emissions . State leaders have long argued that such a program would put thousands of people out_of_work at 9 # 000 private Smog Check stations that currently both conduct tests and repair vehicles that fail . The consultants , with SRI International of Menlo Park , concluded that 598 of the nearly 1 # 600 Smog Check mechanics and technicians would lose jobs under the federal proposal . But they maintain that the loss would be more_than offset because 2 # 575 new inspectors and 1 # 634 mechanics would be needed to conduct &quot; more stringent and thorough &quot; tests and repairs under the federal plan . The study is to be released at a Sacramento press_conference today . The consultants also conclude that 4 # 561 jobs would be created to construct the inspection stations . The net gain to the economy between 1994 and 2002 would reach $ 2.1 billion , including $ 805 million in construction and start-up of the new test stations , the report says . &quot; Building the network of inspection stations . . . would have an immediate positive economic impact in California , &quot; the consultants say . &quot; Operation of the 130-station network would create ongoing employment and economic activity. &quot; The group ' s findings are certain to be controversial because the battle , which pits the Clinton_Administration against a bipartisan group of California lawmakers and Wilson , still is being waged over how to overhaul the state program . Opponents of the federal plan on Wednesday had not yet seen the study , but said they remain dubious about its claims . They say separating tests from repairs not only would harm the car-testing industry but also would inconvenience motorists . As proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , the new Smog Check system would have California motorists take their cars to privately owned emissions testing centers that are overseen by state contracts . Vehicles needing repairs then would be taken_to regular mechanics . The EPA says the change is necessary to cut_down on fraud in the repair business . But service_station owners vehemently oppose that proposal , and state legislators and Wilson defied the EPA by passing a law to keep the test and repair stations intact and crack_down on fraud with extra policing of mechanics and random roadside testing of cars . The new program is supposed to begin next January . For months , the EPA has threatened to impose economic sanctions on the state for defying its order and violating the federal Clean Air Act . The EPA started -- and then abruptly stopped -- the process of freezing millions of dollars in federal highway funds . Clinton_Administration officials say they stopped the sanctions process because it would hurt Los Angeles ' earthquake recovery efforts . In the meantime , several other states with auto inspection programs , including Nevada and New York , also have defied the EPA order because they are awaiting resolution of the California debate . Representatives of the lung association , who support the EPA approach , say they hired SRI International a_few months ago to try to settle the debate over the economic impact . &quot; There has been so_much misinformation floating around in Sacramento in terms of whether this ( EPA proposal ) is really a dreadful thing for the small gas_station or whether it is opening_up a whole new_world of test and repair of vehicles . This shows the latter is true -- that it is a boon to the economy , &quot; said Gladys Meade , a clean-air activist with the lung association . But Charlie Peters , who represents an association of mechanics , said the test-only centers would hurt the overall industry and only generate revenue for the few government contractors who would operate them . Peters opposes both the EPA plan and the new state law , saying the emphasis should not be_on where the tests occur but on establishing standards for the repairs . &quot; Tell me about all_the jobs it will create , because I have difficulty in picturing those . It ' s a 30-second test and it won ' t lead to increased repairs . The repair industry just gets a huge nothing , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
