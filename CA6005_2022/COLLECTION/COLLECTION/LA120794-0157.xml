   <HEADLINE> MEXICO ' S ZEDILLO OFFERS TO SHARE POWER ; POLITICS : FIVE DAYS IN OFFICE , THE PRESIDENT REACHES_OUT TO CONGRESS IN SHARP BREAK WITH TRADITION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Breaking_with seven decades of authoritarian rule , President Ernesto Zedillo formally dined with 500 elected members of Congress on Tuesday and offered what no Mexican president before him ever has : to share the monolithic power of Mexico ' s chief_of_state . In Tuesday ' s unprecedented luncheon at Mexico ' s Chamber of Deputies , billed by independent analysts as a cornerstone of Zedillo ' s proposed new era of democracy , the 42-year-old Yale-educated economist dramatically and decisively shed the traditional arrogance and aloofness of the Mexican presidency just five days after taking_office . Zedillo was criticized , questioned , challenged and praised as he sat , riveted at his lunch table , through eight consecutive speeches -- six of them stern lectures from opposition lawmakers -- in what historians said was the first direct dialogue between the country ' s president and its congress in 65 years of continuous rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party . For more_than an hour , legislators blasted Zedillo ' s party , known as the PRI , for abusing and monopolizing power and widening the gap between Mexico ' s rich and poor . They appealed_to the reformist new president to formulate solutions to an array of national crises -- from endemic illiteracy , poverty , injustice and crime to a threatened insurgency in the southernmost state of Chiapas . As the crisis continued to build_in Chiapas , and thousands of Indians and peasants arrived in the state_capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez for massive demonstrations for and against the inauguration of a PRI governor scheduled for Thursday , legislators from the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party charged that the smoldering rebellion in Chiapas is the result of years of rule by the privileged over the poor . Subcommander Marcos , a rebel spokesman , said late Tuesday that his group will consider a cease-fire with the government broken if the PRI candidate is sworn_in . The rebels and the opposition party say the PRI stole the governor ' s race in August through fraud . To the applause of all 500 deputies , many standing and shouting approval , Zedillo brought a clear end to the tradition of his 11 PRI predecessors . They had shunned a succession of legislatures and ruled with unchallenged authority , reporting only once a year in state-of-the-nation speeches to deputies whose power rested only on paper . But Zedillo declared firmly : &quot; I have decided that the power of the presidency cannot and should not be an omnipotent power , an omniscient power , nor an omnipresent power. &quot; Zedillo stressed the historic importance of the moment . &quot; With this act , &quot; he said of the luncheon , &quot; we start a new , different relationship between the legislative and executive powers of this country . . . . I have the conviction that we all share the commitment to forge a new balance of powers. &quot; Zedillo then challenged the deputies to assert their constitutional legislative authority as never before , inviting them to stand_watch over his presidency , reform the nation ' s electoral_system and help solve conflicts such_as the one in Chiapas . He also used the occasion to appeal for the legislators -- 300 representatives of the PRI and 200 from three major opposition parties -- to approve a revolutionary judicial reform package that he unveiled in a nationally televised speech late Monday night . The judicial reforms , rooted in constitutional amendments that must be approved by both houses of Congress , are aimed at rooting_out the official corruption and inefficiency that saturate the nation ' s police and lower courts . Zedillo said his proposals for a major overhaul of the police , independent vetting of judges and a powerful special prosecutor ' s office to respond to citizens ' complaints of corruption are critical building_blocks for a &quot; new rule_of_law &quot; at a time of national insecurity . Both the reform plan and Zedillo ' s historic meeting with the legislature met with rave reviews from intellectual and opposition circles . &quot; Ernesto Zedillo is a man in a hurry , &quot; declared prominent Mexico_City columnist Sergio Sarmiento under a quotation from Aristotle -- &quot; The man separated from law and justice is the poorest of animals. &quot; Writing in the often irreverent daily newspaper Reforma , Sarmiento praised the president for presenting urgent , concrete proposals on so complex and fundamental a problem as the judicial_system before meeting Congress , because &quot; the reform is seeking to give congress major responsibility in this process. &quot;</TEXT>
