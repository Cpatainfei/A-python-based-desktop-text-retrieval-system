   <TEXT> Robert Manning ' s article ( Opinion , May 22 ) expresses alarm that North_Korea , because of &quot; the pattern of empty U.S. threats , &quot; may feel &quot; emboldened &quot; to develop nuclear_weapons . Manning proffers several plausible explanations why U.S. admonishments concerning the development of nuclear_weapons languish , not considered seriously by other countries . However , Manning omits mentioning the one country that is the source of the United States ' lack of credibility over the issue of nuclear non-proliferation : Israel . Bosnia , Serbia , Somalia and Haiti have nothing to do with the paucity of U.S. credibility over nuclear_weapons . ( Do they possess nuclear_weapons ? ) U.S. lack of credibility extends back to the 1950s and 1960s when Israel clandestinely began to develop nuclear_weapons . The U.S. neither ordered nor threatened Israel to desist_from its development of nuclear_weapons . Now , the U.S. is paying the price of that complicity . Currently , the U.S._government pretends that Israel does not have nuclear_weapons . Countries such_as Iraq , Iran , India , Pakistan , South_Africa and North_Korea know better . Thus , it is with incredible duplicity and hypocrisy that the U.S. demands that those countries abide_by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty while it allows Israel to refuse to sign the treaty and to refuse to permit international inspections of Dimona . FRANK E . TEEPLE III Sierra Madre * In your May 21 article , &quot; N . Korea Crisis Eases as Inspectors Report No Nuclear Fuel Diversion , &quot; your reporter neglects to report the response from the Pyongyang regime as_to why blatant violations against the International Atomic Energy Agency policy were committed . There is no doubt with the tense stalemate of diplomatic talks between the U.S. and North_Korea that both should be walking on eggshells . For North_Korea to continue to disregard and even impede the U.N. ' s IAEA inspection is certainly an egregious act , but to impose sanctions on a country whose tattered economy is_on its last limb would not effect the changes witnessed in its sister country of South_Korea . To do so would elicit a crisis from which there is no return . The United States and United Nations must continue to work_through diplomatic channels to expand economic and higher level talks . In spite of differences , it is the same end result wished by both countries . LAWRENCE KIM Irvine</TEXT>
