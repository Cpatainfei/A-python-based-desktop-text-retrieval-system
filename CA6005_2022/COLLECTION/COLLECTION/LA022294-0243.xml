   <HEADLINE> MORE FRICTION SEEN AS MEXICO TALKS BEGIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Peace talks between southern Mexican rebels and the government began Monday as local antipathy toward the Indian guerrillas showed itself in threats toward nuns in a nearby town occupied during a New Year ' s uprising . About 200 demonstrators in Altamirano , a county_seat about 60 miles from the talks here , on Sunday had given the St . Vincent de Paul nurse nuns a 2 p.m. Monday deadline to evacuate their hospital , threatening to burn it down if they did not . When reporters arrived_at the hospital Monday afternoon , the nuns said the demonstrators had not returned . &quot; They accuse us of being guerrillas , of supporting the Zapatista ( National Liberation ) Army , &quot; said Sister Bertha , one of 10 nuns who care_for patients at the hospital . She was referring to the guerrillas ' name for themselves . Townspeople said they were angry that the nuns had treated nine rebels injured in fighting when the town was invaded on Jan . 1 . Sister Bertha said the nuns also treated three police_officers . &quot; We give the same treatment to everyone , &quot; she said . The confrontation is the most open example yet of local frictions arising from the rebellion . Many people in Chiapas , the state where the uprising took_place , are resentful of the trouble the rebels have brought and worry about what will happen as a result of it . Government officials , such_as State Rep . Juan Jose Reuda , are already making public statements about redistributing local wealth -- one of the rebels ' causes . &quot; Those in Chiapas who have the most must understand that inequality leads to serious social problems , &quot; Reuda told reporters Monday in San Cristobal . Many people blame the church for the uprising because , early in the rebellion , Interior Ministry reports said that priests were leading the guerrillas . The government had to back_down from such statements when it accepted an offer from Samuel Ruiz , bishop of San Cristobal , to mediate the peace talks . During a joint press statement , government peace negotiator Manuel Camacho Solis on Monday also retracted early government accusations that the movement was led by foreigners . Subcommander Marcos , the Zapatista spokesman , said negotiators had discussed the agenda for the talks , dividing it into national , state and Indian-peasant issues .</TEXT>
