   <TEXT> Creator of asphyxiant worlds in which characters moved about the everyday emptiness , Uruguayan author Juan Carlos Onetti , who died at 85 on May 30 , was an atypical participant of the Latin_American &quot; boom &quot; of the Sixties . Away from the media attention given to other writers such_as Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Mario Vargas Llosa , Onetti , born in Montevideo in 1909 , for years preferred to avoid public appearances in_order to remain in bed with his two inseparable companions -- his wife and a bottle . Onetti , remembered by his generation colleagues as an almost crude being , who , in his youth , used to stroll aimlessly through the city , began generating almost religious followers after his first short_story published in 1932 and his first novel , &quot; El Pozo , &quot; in 1939 . Journalistic and mostly sparing in his literary descriptions , Onetti utilized a detached language that achieved something critics couldn ' t stop praising -- the creation of an oppressive yet captivating atmosphere that produced a strange mix of fascination and desperation in the reader . The author of other books such_as &quot; El Astillero &quot; and &quot; Juntacadaveres , &quot; which transformed him in a sort of living myth , Onetti abandoned Uruguay in 1974 , soon after the military took_over , changing his residence to Madrid . He refused to return to his birthplace . In a famous controversy among writers , Onetti himself defined what he considered his essential method of approaching literary creation . &quot; Some are married to literature , but I ' m only her lover , &quot; he said in one of the rare interviews he gave . Even before the colorful appearance of Gabriel Garcia Marquez ' s Macondo in the collective Latin_American literary imagination , Onetti had founded the imaginary city of Santa Maria , in which he mixed the fogs , panoramic views and low passions of the inhabitants of Montevideo and Buenos Aires . Honored in 1980 with the Premio Cervantes , the maximum prize given for Hispanic literature , in occasional articles Onetti liked to remember his stint as editor of prestigious Uruguayan weekly Marcha and as a staff writer for the Reuter news_agency . With his slow and complex style , impenetrable for most , the old surly &quot; el viejo hurano , &quot; as he was affectionately called by Uruguayan writers , finally achieved something that ironically seems taken from his own stories -- he was much more respected than read . &quot; Body_Snatcher , &quot; translated by Alfred M . Adam , is available from Pantheon . &quot; Goodbyes and Stories , &quot; translated by Daniel Balderston , is available from the Texas University Press , &quot; Shipyard &quot; and &quot; Juan Carlos Onetti : A Brief Life &quot; are available from Serpent ' s Tail .
