   <HEADLINE> LEE A . DUBRIDGE ; LED CALTECH FOR 22 YEARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lee A . DuBridge , president of Caltech for 22 years and science adviser to President Richard Nixon , died Sunday , Caltech officials said . He was 92 . DuBridge , who had retired to Laguna Hills , headed the Pasadena institution -- known for scientific education and research including space exploration -- from 1946 until 1968 . He then worked for Nixon from early 1969 until shortly before his 69th birthday in 1970 . In reluctantly accepting the resignation , Nixon praised DuBridge for his &quot; skill , wisdom , and seasoned judgment , &quot; traits the scientist and administrator used throughout his career to apply science to overall human endeavor . &quot; The world is sorely in need of young_men understanding the place of science in the world at_large -- leaders who will see that science serves mankind rather than contributing to destruction , &quot; DuBridge said shortly after he was named Caltech president in 1946 . His initial task was to move Caltech -- and himself -- from a World_War_II orientation of secret military projects toward fundamental scientific education and research . As a nuclear physicist , DuBridge had supervised the construction and installation of an atom-smashing cyclotron , which soon produced the highest energy proton beam of the time , at the University of Rochester in 1938 . From 1940 to 1946 , he headed the Massachusetts Institute of Technology radiation laboratory set_up by the National Defense Research Committee . The unit was then considered the largest research and development laboratory ever assembled and was credited with giving Allied forces supremacy in radar during World_War_II . As scientist and administrator , DuBridge helped bring_together science and government , setting the pattern for the Manhattan_Project , which developed the atomic_bomb . Much later , he played a role in space exploration by supervising the development of the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory for the new National Aeronautics and Space Administration . Yet he stressed adapting atomic_energy for peaceful purposes and saw little need for sending people into space . &quot; All I hope is that we don ' t let the glamour of the term ' space science ' confuse us , &quot; he said in 1963 . &quot; There is a lot we can learn about the moon , for example , by just using earthbound astronomical_telescopes . Let ' s not be seduced into sending expeditions to the moon just to look_for things we can see perfectly well from Palomar Mountain. &quot; A strong advocate of academic_freedom even during the McCarthy era , DuBridge publicly spoke out on behalf of Caltech chemist Linus Pauling when he was denied a passport because of suspicion that he was a Communist , and on behalf of his nuclear physics colleague Robert Oppenheimer , whose security clearance concerning atomic information was revoked . DuBridge adhered to a concept of Caltech as a small , select institution of excellence with carefully controlled growth . During his tenure , Caltech expanded from 30 acres to 90 , a $ 17-million endowment to $ 100 million , 260 faculty_members to 550 , 20 buildings to 64 , and an $ 8-million budget to $ 30 million . He supervised construction of the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar as well as guiding the development of JPL . Nationally sought by Democratic and Republican administrations , DuBridge was named to the original national Science Advisory Committee by President Harry S . Truman in 1951 , and made chairman a year later by President Dwight D . Eisenhower . He served on several other governmental advisory committees and as adviser to more_than 20 private organizations . In Los Angeles , DuBridge helped to found public television_station KCET and to establish the California Museum of Science and Industry . He had honorary_degrees from 29 universities and colleges and earned more_than 20 professional awards , including the_British King ' s Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom , in 1946 ; the United States Medal for Merit , in 1948 , and the Vannevar Award from the National Science Foundation , in 1982 . Born Sept . 21 , 1901 , in Terre Haute , Ind. , DuBridge studied physics at Cornell College in Mount Vernon , Iowa , and at the University of Wisconsin , where he began his teaching career . After conducting research in physics at Caltech from 1926 to 1928 , he taught at Washington University in St . Louis and then went_to the University of Rochester as Harris Professor of Physics in 1934 . DuBridge ' s first wife , Doris , died in 1973 ; they had been married 48 years . He is survived by his second wife , the former Arrola Bush Cole ; two children , Barbara Lee MacLeod of Simi Valley and Richard A . DuBridge of Saratoga , Calif. ; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren . The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to Caltech . Services are pending .</TEXT>
