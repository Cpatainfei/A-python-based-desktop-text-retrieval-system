   <HEADLINE> GERMAN ADMITS FIREBOMBING THAT KILLED 5 IMMIGRANT WOMEN , CHILDREN ; COURTS : UNEMPLOYED RIGHTIST APOLOGIZES TO FAMILY AS TRIAL BEGINS . CO-DEFENDANTS SNICKER DURING CONFESSION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the opening day of his murder trial Wednesday , an unemployed German rightist confessed to a firebombing that killed five Turkish immigrant women and girls last year in the worst of a wave of hate crimes since German reunification . Markus Gartmann , one of four defendants in the arson and murder trial , told his victims ' family in a halting voice that he was &quot; very sorry &quot; and &quot; infinitely ashamed &quot; for the attack in Solingen , a western German city whose name has since become synonymous with racist violence . Gartmann ' s co-defendants shook their heads and snickered during his confession . Gartmann , a 24-year-old former member of the extreme-right German People ' s Union , added that &quot; the slogans of the right lead to hate and inhumanity , and all_of us ( defendants ) here are the result. &quot; The long-awaited trial began amid heavy security in a packed courtroom in the western city of Duesseldorf . The defendants were flanked by guards , and observers were frisked and combed with metal detectors upon entering the windowless court . Outside , demonstrators held banners saying &quot; Ban All Neo-Fascist Groups &quot; and &quot; Don ' t Forget Solingen , &quot; but although officials had feared violence , none was reported . Extra police units had been put_on alert . Near Bonn , however , unknown assailants tossed another firebomb at the home of asylum seekers from Africa , Afghanistan and Turkey shortly after midnight Wednesday . The bottle of gasoline exploded on the steps of the home_in the town of Windeck , but no one was injured in what police presumed was a racist attack . The Solingen killings on May 29 , 1993 , set_off protests by thousands of Turks in Germany and brought international condemnation to a country still struggling with its Nazi history . Anti-foreigner sentiment festered into a rash of attacks after reunification in 1990 . Solingen was a copy of an attack in the northern city of Moelln the previous November in which a Turkish grandmother and two girls died when their home was torched . Prosecutors assert that the four Solingen defendants set fire to the Genc family home after they had attended a party in town and fought with foreigners whom they mistook for Turks . Two women and three girls , ages 4 , 9 and 13 , died in the fire . Three others , including a 6-month-old baby , were hospitalized with serious burns . About two_dozen relatives of the victims watched the beginning of the trial , often on the verge of tears . The Genc family had lived_in Solingen for decades before the attack . Gartmann , shaken in court , cut_off his testimony before giving details of the assault and is scheduled to continue today . He already had confessed in a letter to the Genc family in January and faces life in prison if convicted . Another defendant , Christian Reher , 17 , earlier had confessed to the attack , but he refused to testify in court . He said he would give his name but not answer any questions . Reher and Felix Koehnen , 16 , who maintains his innocence , are charged as juveniles and face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison . The fourth defendant , Christian Buchholz , 20 , also has denied he took_part in the attack . Prosecutor Dirk Fernholz told the panel of judges that the defendants were rightists who committed the crime out of &quot; hatred for foreigners , particularly Turks. &quot; In his opening statement , Fernholz said the defendants &quot; saw themselves as rightists and associated with slogans such_as ' Get Rid of Foreigners ' and ' Germany for Germans. ' &quot; He said they were drunk when they made the attack .</TEXT>
