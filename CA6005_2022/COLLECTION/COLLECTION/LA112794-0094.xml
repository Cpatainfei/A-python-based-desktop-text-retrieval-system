   <HEADLINE> TRAVEL INSIDER : AVOIDING AN ODD COUPLE ODYSSEY WITH FRIENDS ; VACATIONS : BEFORE PLANNING A TRIP WITH YOUR BEST BUDDIES , KNOW THEIR QUIRKY HABITS AND SPENDING AND SLEEPING PATTERNS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Few things are as critical to successful travel as good companions . You may_not have the option of leaving_behind a grumpy spouse , but when you can pick someone to accompany you on vacation , choose with care . Even best_friends may make the worst of travel companions . A vacation , remember , is not the same as having dinner with the neighbors . Odd personality quirks that can be tolerated for a_few hours can loom large when you ' re together for days or weeks under stressful circumstances -- and minor differences_of_opinion can fester into grievances . Once you have found compatible traveling partners , you don ' t want to lose them . I ' ve run_into people who travel together regularly because their interests and habits blend , but who go their separate ways at_home . On the other hand , my wife and I are very close friends with a couple with whom we never would travel for more_than a day or so . It would kill our friendship . Probably anybody who has traveled much has a tale of mismatched companions . Years ago my wife and I , who are frequent travelers , invited a couple from her hometown to join us for a_couple_of weeks in Europe . We were the experts who would introduce the first-time visitors to a part of the world we like very much . Unknown to us , the husband was the enthusiast pushing for the trip ; his wife agreed to come_along reluctantly . She thought the cost of the trip could be_better spent on furnishing their house . And so , amid the splendor of the_Swiss Alps and the whimsy of Copenhagen ' s Tivoli Gardens , they quarreled again and again . My wife and I share a delight for exotic foods , and eating as an adventure is a significant part of a trip for us . So if we travel with others , we want them to like unusual menu choices too . Good , well-chosen companions can add zest to a holiday . And I say this as someone who , over the years , has become quite comfortable traveling alone , as I often do . Last spring , my wife and I took another first-timer to Italy for two weeks -- my wife ' s sister , in fact . As we all recognize , there is something obligatory about traveling with family members -- you can ' t say no easily . I had no intention of saying no in this case , and as it turned_out my sister-in-law , Pam , proved to be a very good companion . The three of us explored Northern Italy by train for two weeks , which meant we spent a lot of time in railway_stations buying tickets in a language none of us speaks . Rather than let my wife and I , the old-timers , assume such everyday travel chores as ticket buying , Pam pitched_in to help . And she did so eagerly and without prompting , as a way of getting more involved in Italy . Based on experiences both good and bad , I ' ve compiled a list of qualities to look_for in traveling companions -- that is , outsiders with whom you agree to travel . Look_for someone who : * Expects to spend about as much or as little as you do on the vacation . Budgetary differences can quickly erupt into bitter arguments . Decide which you will do or agree to compromise 50-50 before you leave home , or don ' t travel together . * Knows and tolerates your personal habits , and whose foibles you are comfortable with . I am an early riser every day of the week.My wife isn ' t . So we have worked_out a compromise : I run , walk or swim at dawn , and she arises in time to allow us a full day of vacation activities . * Shares your idea of fun . I travel_to learn , which is how I have fun . A day spent idling on a beach is my idea of torture . If I were looking_for a travel companion to the Caribbean , for example , it would have to be someone who realized I would spend much of my time exploring back roads and remote villages . * Enjoys the same tastes in food . I once traveled in Europe with a guy who figured cheapest was best . He carried a guide to budget eateries and refused to dine elsewhere . Once his book steered us to a place that can only be described as a tourist feeding trough . Every 30 minutes , a new group of young American vagabonds -- us among them -- was seated at communal tables . I stood as much of this as I could and then started eating better on my own . * Matches you in stamina . My wife and I like to walk , so we spend lots of time exploring cities in this country and abroad on foot . In Paris a_few years ago , we met_up_with an old friend for several days . Invariably , she wanted to get_to museums and other attractions using the Metro . We preferred to walk , arguing that there is a lot to see along the way . Ultimately we agreed to walk one way and ride the other . * Is as adventurous or cautious as you . Once an old friend told me , &quot; I like it when you are along because you ' re always willing to do things. &quot; I took this as quite a compliment . * Can manage quite nicely on_their_own , when circumstances require . * Doesn ' t leave the dirty work to you . Let my sister-in-law Pam be the guide here . As much as my wife and I enjoy plotting our own sightseeing itineraries , it proved a relief to have Pam take her turn as the instigator of activities . When she was in_charge , she led us to places that interested her but that we might have skipped -- and vice versa . Everybody learned something more_than they might have , which is what you hope for from good companions . * Times travel writer Christopher Reynolds is_on assignment .</TEXT>
