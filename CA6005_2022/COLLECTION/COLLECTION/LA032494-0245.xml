   <HEADLINE> LOST IN O.C. : TURNING 39 GIVES A GUY PLENTY TO CHEW ON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I have lived to see the self-adhesive postage_stamp . Progress like that I can understand , as opposed to grasping whether the computer I ' m buying has &quot; Pentium upgradability. &quot; But it is all_of this progress that is starting to make me feel really old . &quot; Say , Sonny , we used to lick them stamps. &quot; &quot; Yeah , sure , Gramps. &quot; I just had a birthday and turned the Jack Benny age , and I really don ' t care . So I ' m old . Give me a discount coupon and shut_up . I think mine might be the first generation to go straight to being old without bothering to stop first at adulthood . I look_back at parents like mine and all previous generations and wonder : How the hell did they ever get so responsible ? They actually got pleasure out of getting a new patio laid or understanding their finances . They knew which fork to use and how to compose a business_letter . I ' m 39 , and my chief expenditures are still breakfast cereal and electric_guitars . I don ' t have a checking_account and only got a credit_card so I could rent videos , which I wind_up not doing anyway because I become genuinely furious every time I ' m handed a rental form loaded with needless prying questions . I determined not to do certain things until I was 40 . Hence , at 39 , I still don ' t know how to tie a tie . This leads to occasions like one time some years back when I happened to be getting sued by Bruce Springsteen and CBS for $ 1.5 million , which sounds a whole_lot more interesting than it actually was , not that I won ' t write_about it in some future column when I ' m desperate . At any rate , I had to be at a deposition hearing upon which my future , or at least $ 1.5 mil of it , hinged , and found myself standing_in CBS ' s prestigious Century City law_firm ' s prestigious parking garage , putting my tie on . But since I couldn ' t put it on myself , it was accomplished by a friend , who had to stand behind me awkwardly pretending my neck was his in_order to figure_out how to do_it . At best , we looked_like Ray Milland and Rosie Grier in &quot; The Thing With Two Heads. &quot; Several high-powered lawyers walked by looking_at us , their ties knotted perfectly . There ' s really not much you can say in situations like that , except &quot; Hi. &quot; * So I forgot to grow_up . Given that we now have a President who likes to amble around the White_House blatting_out &quot; Night Train &quot; on a tenor sax , I ' m not going_to apologize for clinging_to my adolescence . There ' s lots of us . Just the other day I was talking on the phone to my guitar repairman friend Steve Soest . Steve is in his 40s and about as respected as one can be in a profession where they use terms like &quot; Stratocaster jack-plate. &quot; Yet , right when we were in the middle of some important guy-chat about old amplifiers , he suddenly exclaimed &quot; Ow ! ! ! That really hurt ! &quot; It turns_out that concurrent with talking to me , he and his wife were trying_out a vintage BB_gun , and she shot him . Not intentionally ; it was a ricochet , she claimed . Whatever the circumstance , I can ' t tell you what a warm feeling it was to find that someone I look_up_to is still catching BBs . I should make a distinction here : I ' m not especially in favor of the party-hardy kegger consciousness that some adults sustain their whole lives through . Rather , I just don ' t want to become grown-up in the manner that so many adults presume grown-up means they have no more growing to do . I want to stay open_to things , and that often requires a willingness to land on your ass . Maintaining a sense of play is serious business . I think the crucial inner battle in life is the choice between living fully or letting your world be proscribed by fear . It ' s scary to let_go_of life ' s handrails and see what happens next . For all_the years -- between water-balloon fights -- that I spent studying philosophy and religion , my personal credo has finally been pared_down to this : Let ' s see what happens next . That means facing life without so many presumptions ; letting things happen ; making things happen , and paying_attention when they do . That should all be the easiest stuff in the world , and it was back when we were all 5 years old . As I age , though , I have to admit that worry places a widening gap between knowing something and living it . When playing music , for example , I can get so uptight worrying what the audience thinks that it ' s guaranteed the only thing they are going_to think is &quot; Hey , does this stuff ever sound uptight ! &quot; Knowing that music is supposed to be fun , flowing , adventurous and all that good stuff doesn ' t always help you make_it so . My girlfriend recently got me out on a pair of cross-country skis , and I wound_up having a blast , but not before I worried about it in every direction . You know the way skis point_up in the front ? I was convinced that if I fell those points were precisely positioned to be right where my eyes would land . I did finally relax into it , which is more_than I can say about recent attempts to learn how to roller-skate . There , despite any metaphorical maxims about letting_go_of handrails , that was hard concrete down there , and I was clinging like a drowning man to any handy surface . If thought is flight , fear is surely gravity , and if there is anything that is sure to make you old , it is to worry about getting old . ( Feel welcome to stuff a fortune_cookie with this sentence. ) If I might offer one small piece of advice gleaned from my ski trip : Do not Armor-All the soles of your snow boots , unless you really prefer a zero-traction lifestyle . I do recommend the stuff for most other uses , to_the_point where I ' m sometimes tempted to Armor-All my teeth . And it is teeth I would finally like to discuss today . More_than most things , it ' s my molars that make me aware of my mortality . Teeth , at least my own , give me the creeps . Maybe it ' s because they ' re the only part of the skeleton that shows . Maybe it ' s because , unlike hair , you tend to notice more when teeth fall_out . Maybe it ' s because dentists exult in pointing_out the thousands of dollars ' worth of things that can go_wrong with them . And if something as dense and simple as teeth are so besieged , what about the hundreds of weird-named glands and organs squishing around inside us ? My most recent dentist once stuck a newfangled fiber optic video camera in my mouth , and , blown_up hideously on a TV screen , my teeth exhibited the kind of rot one usually associates with New Orleans graveyards . I have to admit , though , that with the jiggling camera making the teeth look as if they were dancing in a sea of pink flesh and saliva , my mouth makes a hell of a rock video .</TEXT>
