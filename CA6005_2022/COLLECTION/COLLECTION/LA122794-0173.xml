   <TEXT> A week ago , President Ernesto Zedillo was_on a roll . Just 18 days into his six-year term , the 42-year-old Yale-educated economist had charmed the opposition into passing a radical judicial reform package by overwhelming margins in both houses of Congress . He had won the confidence of bankers , business people and brokers through a new budget package that projected 4 % growth and 4 % inflation in 1995 . And he had won_over the Mexican public , less than half of whom had voted for him in August . Polls showed that almost two-thirds of all Mexicans approved of Zedillo ' s new administration . Then the bottom fell_out . Zedillo ' s roll became a tumble , then an avalanche , of seeming missteps and bad_luck . Rebels rose_up in the southern state of Chiapas . The Mexican stock_exchange plummeted . Zedillo and his economic team reacted with harsh measures that cut the value of the nation ' s currency by 20 % in a day . International and domestic economists questioned Zedillo ' s competence . And finally , a volcano on the outskirts of the capital threatened to erupt . On Monday , as Zedillo and his government began the climb back to credibility with encouraging new signs of peace in Chiapas , the toll of this one terrible week was clear : The president ' s popular support had been cut almost in half , according to one poll ; headlines declared , &quot; The Romance Is Over , &quot; and Zedillo ' s traumatized nation was deep into what an investigation by the Mexico_City economic daily El Financiero called &quot; a severe economic and financial crisis. &quot; In an accompanying editorial on &quot; the virtual collapse suffered by the economy &quot; last week , El Financiero disclosed that the government ' s foreign-exchange reserves are insufficient to meet even its most immediate needs ; it stressed that Zedillo now bears &quot; maximum responsibility &quot; to take the lead in rescuing the nation from its many crises . But as they took_stock after one of Mexico ' s bleakest Christmases in recent memory , analysts here also speculated widely on Zedillo ' s strategy -- past and present -- and the extent of the blame he must bear for last week ' s crises , which he largely inherited from his predecessor , Carlos Salinas de Gortari . At the heart of those crises is Chiapas . Analysts agree that Zedillo had few options to deal with the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army when he took_office . Even before Zedillo ' s Dec . 1 inauguration , the Zapatistas were threatening to break the truce they declared with the Mexican army Jan . 12 after a two-week shooting war left at least 145 people dead . Once in power , Zedillo spoke often of his commitment to negotiation , a unilateral cease-fire and a solution that would address the Indian rebels ' demands for equal treatment and authentic democratic reform . But even as he did this , Zapatista leader Subcommander Marcos was quietly ordering his fighters to slip out of their rain-forest stronghold , through a cordon of 40 # 000 Mexican troops and into dozens of villages and towns in the north of the state . Analysts said they were certain that Zedillo ' s security advisers had told him , in_advance , that the Zapatistas would stage a major &quot; event &quot; before the anniversary of their New Year ' s Day uprising . At the same time , they said , Zedillo ' s economic team had determined that Salinas had left_behind a dangerously overvalued peso , which needed big adjustment if Mexico was to remain competitive in international markets . In what some then saw as a master stroke , Zedillo combined the two : He deliberately waited to move_on the peso until after the Zapatistas ' Dec . 19 peaceful insurrection -- a day of commandeering highways and town_halls as &quot; liberated territory. &quot; Zedillo was prepared . The next day , he ordered Finance Secretary Jaime Serra Puche to publicly blame a &quot; climate of insecurity &quot; spawned by the rebels for the need to widen the trading band on the peso , allowing it to slide to four to the dollar from 3.34. &quot; It was brilliant . With a single act , he satanized the Zapatistas and administered the bitter economic medicine he would have had to apply in any case , &quot; said one Mexico_City political analyst . But it was Zedillo ' s next step that few analysts can explain . Less than 24 hours after allowing the peso to devalue 12 % , with a public promise to take no further action on the currency , Zedillo ' s administration suddenly announced it would let the peso float . Within hours , the peso lost a fifth of its value , U.S. investors in Mexico lost billions of dollars and some of the most prestigious financial analysts in New York declared a &quot; crisis of confidence &quot; in Zedillo and his new , young government . Zedillo moved quickly into damage_control . Having lost the initiative to the Zapatistas , he ordered his most trusted aide , Interior_Secretary Esteban Moctezuma , to offer Marcos an olive_branch while ordering the army to prepare a stick . On Saturday , as tanks and armored personnel_carriers nudged into the Zapatistas ' jungle zone , Moctezuma announced that the government was relenting on one of Marcos ' major demands -- allowing a Roman_Catholic bishop sympathetic to the rebels to help negotiate an end to the conflict . Bishop Samuel Ruiz , in the second week of a hunger_strike , filled his Christmas sermon with joy and hope on Sunday . Within 24 hours , members of his ecumenical commission were en route to meet Marcos on the government ' s behalf for the first time in months . As they met in the Lacandon rain_forest Monday , Zedillo appeared to be having better luck with nature , as well . With more_than 50 # 000 villagers in evacuation centers , scientists said the threat of an imminent eruption of the Popocapetl volcano -- an event that could shower a city of 20 million with dangerous ash and mud -- appeared to be receding . Yet the imagery of Zedillo ' s tough , first month in office endured . A political cartoon in the daily Jornada on Monday morning showed two peasants walking away from the volcano . &quot; At least this isn ' t like the devaluation , &quot; one peasant tells the other . &quot; Popo warns us in advance. &quot;</TEXT>
