   <HEADLINE> SUMMER ' S STAR SHOWER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The annual Perseid meteor_shower may be unusually intense this year . A meteor storm could occur Thursday night and Friday morning , climaxing about 3 a.m. Friday , Pacific_time . Astronomers are predicting that viewers in dark locations with a good view of the sky could see at least one meteor per minute -- or up_to several hundred per hour . The Makings of Meteors * Often called &quot; shooting stars , &quot; meteors are particles of dust shed by comets . Streaks of light are produced as the particles fall_through the atmosphere and are burned_up by friction when they collide_with air molecules . * Meteors fall every night , but when the Earth passes_through the orbit of an active comet , meteors fall_in a shower of up_to a_few dozen meteors per hour . The Comet Swift-Tuttle * Every August the Earth passes near the orbit of the comet Swift-Tuttle and we see the so-called Perseid meteors , which radiate from the direction of the constellation Perseus . * This comet reached its closest point to Earth in 1992 , as it does once every 130 years . For several years before and after its return , showers can be intense because the Earth is passing_through the part of the comet ' s orbit where a lot of dust was recently shed . * The August shower was especially brilliant in 1991 and 1992 , and less so in 1993 because it peaked before dark on the West Coast . For the next two years there are still chances for bright August fireworks . Tips for Sky-Watchers * The best time for viewing will be late Thursday night until 3 a.m. Friday . Meteors will also fall tonight and Friday , but with less intensity . * If possible , get_away from city lights . Griffith Observatory is too close to Downtown Los Angeles ' bright lights for good visibility and will not be open late for the event . * For more information on celestial events , call the observatory ' s Sky Report at ( 213 ) 663-8171 .
