   <HEADLINE> FOR PBS AT LEAST , ' BASEBALL ' IS A HIT -- BUT IT ' S NO ' CIVIL WAR ' ; TELEVISION : KEN BURNS ' EPIC IS ATTRACTING A LARGE AUDIENCE BY THE NETWORK ' S STANDARDS , BUT NOT AS LARGE AS HIS PREVIOUS MINISERIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is &quot; Baseball , &quot; Ken Burns ' epic PBS miniseries following his landmark work &quot; The Civil War , &quot; a ratings hit or a miss ? It ' s a question akin to the classic inquiry about whether the glass is half empty or half full . By PBS standards , the first week of &quot; Baseball &quot; was outstanding , attracting an audience 2 1 / 2 times larger than the average public-television program . But by commercial network standards , its ratings so far would probably be dubbed a disaster -- especially because $ 2 million was spent by General Motors alone on advertising , promotion and educational projects . And that doesn ' t begin to encompass the mounds of free publicity &quot; Baseball &quot; acquired through splashy magazine and newspaper_articles and countless TV appearances by Burns -- a clear media home_run . In its first five nights last week , the nine-part &quot; Baseball &quot; averaged a 5.1 rating in 32 major markets ( national ratings for PBS are not yet available ) , attracting about 7 % of the available viewers . * Assuming the national rating is about the same , that would make &quot; Baseball &quot; one of the least-watched programs on television last week when compared with the fare on ABC , CBS , NBC and Fox . The 5.1 rating that the first episode got_on Sept . 18 would have ranked 84th out of 85 prime-time programs on the A.C. Nielsen weekly ratings list . Moreover , &quot; Baseball &quot; didn ' t perform nearly as well as &quot; The Civil War &quot; did_in September , 1990 . Matching the 24 markets that were measured then , the five nights of &quot; Civil War &quot; had an average 8.9 rating and 13 % share of the audience vs . &quot; Baseball ' s &quot; 5.5 rating and 8 % of the audience . &quot; Civil War &quot; was 11 hours ; altogether when its &quot; game &quot; is over , &quot; Baseball &quot; will have aired 18 1 / 2 hours . It cost $ 8 million to produce . In &quot; Baseball ' s &quot; win column , however , is the fact that the 5.1 rating in 32 markets is 155 % better than public television normally does_in prime_time . PBS averages a 2 rating and a 3 % share of audience . &quot; We ' re thrilled with that , &quot; said John Fuller , director of PBS research . Did &quot; Baseball &quot; do as well as it was supposed to , or did the stunning performance of &quot; Civil War &quot; unreasonably enhance expectations ? And what role did the Major_League Baseball strike play -- enlarging audiences who missed seeing men run_around the bases , or turning fans off in anger ? Fuller insisted that he didn ' t think &quot; anybody in their right mind expected ' Baseball ' to do what ' Civil War ' did . It ' s different subject_matter -- it ' s about a sport . ' The Civil War ' was one of those shows like ABC ' s ( 1977 miniseries ) ' Roots ' that touched a national nerve . While ' Baseball ' certainly has plenty of emotional elements ( but they didn ' t ) drive the series , like slavery did. &quot; Asked why , then , &quot; Baseball &quot; got 7 1 / 2 hours more_than &quot; Civil War , &quot; Fuller replied : &quot; that ' s Ken Burns . We weren ' t the ones who decided how long to make it. &quot; He added that the ratings changed each night of &quot; Baseball &quot; -- &quot; one a little lower , one a little higher , and all_in all it ' s holding up. &quot; Its best night last week was Wednesday -- a 5.6 rating and 9 % share when it concentrated_on Babe_Ruth . The other four nights drew a 7 % share . The worst ratings were_on Tuesday , at 4.6 , which dealt with baseball ' s first decade of the 20th Century . Commercial network executives tended to dodge the question of whether they would be disappointed with &quot; Baseball ' s &quot; ratings based on what was spent to promote it . Some opted not to discuss the_matter at all . * Larry Hyams , ABC ' s vice_president of audience analysis , also used the &quot; Roots &quot; analogy , saying that &quot; Civil War &quot; was in a class by itself . So , if he were at PBS , he said , &quot; I ' d be quite happy &quot; that &quot; Baseball &quot; is &quot; doubling and tripling its audience levels. &quot; But Hyams also noted that &quot; 18 1 / 2 hours is an awful lot. &quot; &quot; Not everybody is a baseball fan , &quot; he said . &quot; The Civil War was a turning point in the country ' s history . Maybe not that many people care about what happened in the 1860s with baseball. &quot; He added that &quot; the topic ( of baseball ) is somewhat narrow &quot; -- skewed to an older , male audience . &quot; It doesn ' t have that much female appeal. &quot; And , he said , &quot; the strike hurt , &quot; creating &quot; a backlash against watching anything like ' Baseball. ' &quot; George Schweitzer , CBS ' executive_vice_president for marketing and communications , agreed . &quot; I guess the real issue is , is there an appetite for baseball ? It doesn ' t knock the quality of the show. &quot; Baseball has &quot; a narrower appeal &quot; than did &quot; The Civil War , &quot; Schweitzer noted . &quot; A documentary on baseball is not as_good_as a baseball_game . . . . There is no baseball and no interest in baseball , and people are finding other things to do without baseball. &quot; PBS ' Fuller said he was waiting for the ratings for the final installments , which began Sunday and conclude Wednesday night : &quot; We must wait and see how many people come back. &quot; John Maciarz , a public relations and marketing executive for General Motors , the major corporate backer of &quot; Baseball , &quot; said last Friday that he was happy with the results thus far . &quot; We still have the week to go , and we still have some powerful episodes . Bottom_line -- we ' re not disappointed. &quot;</TEXT>
