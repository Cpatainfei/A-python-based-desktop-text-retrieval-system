   <TEXT> A grenade attack on a pro-democracy demonstration Thursday killed at least five people and wounded more_than 40 in a bloody act of apparent resistance by Haiti ' s military dictatorship and its supporters . The killings came_on the eve of the third anniversary of the violent overthrow of the country ' s only democratically elected president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide , whose impending return has been marked repeatedly in recent days by sneak attacks , beatings and shootings of his supporters . Witnesses said that hundreds of demonstrators marching between downtown and the city ' s airport were passing a warehouse owned by Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois , Haiti ' s feared police_chief and a leader of the ruling military junta , when at least one grenade was thrown from a car that may have emerged from the building . At the same time , Francois , one of the three Haitian officers who have ruled Haiti with violence and corruption since the coup , was reported by friends and U.S. military sources to have packed up things from his office and was preparing to leave the country within days . Francois would be the first of the three Haitian military_leaders to accede_to U.S. and U.N. demands that they leave power . Witnesses said Thursday ' s grenade or grenades were thrown by known members of a civilian wing of the Haitian army , at least one of whom was later tracked by a U.S. military_police team using dogs and led away in handcuffs . The final death toll from the second attack on peaceful demonstrators in two days was incomplete by dusk Thursday , but eyewitnesses , hospitals , the Haitian Red_Cross and U.S. officials agreed that the total killed or wounded was more_than 40 . A passing U.S. Army patrol came_upon the scene and opened_fire just moments after the explosions . It was unclear whether the American gunfire hit any of the demonstrators or any of the attackers , but at least one of the attackers was reported among the dead . U.S. Army Col . John Ryneska , who also happened by the scene soon after the attack , said none of the American troops were injured , and he confirmed that at least one Haitian had been detained . * Reacting to the incident , U.S. Ambassador William Lacey Swing told reporters that the U.S._government &quot; condemns in the strongest terms the explosions which took_place this afternoon. &quot; With Haiti &quot; undergoing fundamental , watershed change . . . such brutal acts of violence are not totally surprising , &quot; Swing said . He issued a stern appeal for calm today , saying , &quot; We would simply urge everyone to avoid violence. &quot; Tension and violence have been building since a mission led by former President Jimmy_Carter , backed by the threat of an imminent U.S. invasion , forged an agreement Sept . 18 under which the Haitian military leadership is to resign no later than Oct . 15 and allow Aristide ' s return in exchange for immunity from prosecution for its role in the coup . The agreement was followed by the peaceful arrival of U.S. troops , who have taken increasing but not yet total control of the country . U.S. officials said Thursday that about 19 # 000 U.S. troops are now in Haiti -- including some brought_in to replace soldiers who are about to depart -- and the number &quot; may go a little higher. &quot; Pentagon officials initially estimated that about 15 # 000 would be deployed here . Haitian military_leaders and the civilians who often do their bidding say they are abiding_by the Sept . 18 accord , but they apparently have engaged in various acts of violent resistance . One person was fatally wounded Wednesday , and several others were also hurt , when men fired from a car at demonstrators . As Francois prepared to leave and some of his followers apparently were engaged in Thursday ' s attack , thousands of Haitians swarmed outside City_Hall , listening through loudspeakers installed by U.S. forces as Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul reclaimed the office taken from him during the coup . The last time Paul tried to enter City_Hall , on Aug . 8 , 1993 , a mob summoned by the military stormed the building and killed eight people . Paul , a 38-year-old former radio newscaster and playwright with an immense public following , had been in hiding ever since . Paul , whose popularity and anti-military stance have brought several beatings and near-fatal torture in 1988 , called_on each ruling general -- and on Francois by name -- to depart . &quot; No law says you must leave the country . . . . but for the sake of peace , you should do_it , &quot; Paul said to deafening applause . &quot; Leave the country for a time . When peace is restored , you can come back. &quot; The mayor , who many Haitians believe could succeed Aristide in presidential elections scheduled for next year , punctuated his speech with the trademark chant of Haiti ' s pro-democracy struggle : &quot; The cock has crowed ! Get_up ! Stand_up ! &quot; He also announced a new battle_cry : &quot; Justice ! Democracy ! Progress ! &quot; And the crowd outside chanted with him as he shouted the words more_than a dozen times . Paul also appealed several times during his half-hour speech for peaceful change and called_on all Haitians to shun revenge . &quot; A true democrat does not seek vengeance , &quot; he said . &quot; A democrat does not seek violence . A democrat seeks only peace , democracy , justice , unity and progress . . . . &quot; We wish that no one will fear anyone or anything , &quot; he said as dozens of U.S. troops stood_guard outside . &quot; If someone does not believe what we believe , leave them in peace . We are all Haitians . We should live together in the same country in peace , even if we disagree. &quot; Thursday ' s pro-democracy marchers did not heed Paul ' s call . They sacked the warehouse at the site of the grenade attack , hauling out thousands of bags of cement that Francois had obtained while still in control . Francois , who used his position to earn millions in businesses ranging from auto towing to smuggling to cement importing , will retire and go_into exile in the neighboring Dominican_Republic , where he has a home and huge investments , sources said Thursday . The 36-year-old Francois was the backbone of the Sept . 30 , 1991 , coup that drove Haiti into the bloody spiral of violent chaos that brought_on a devastating economic embargo and climaxed with the U.S. military intervention . &quot; He was in his office yesterday and packed up his things , &quot; said a friend who accompanied the shadowy , almost mythical head of Haiti ' s corrupt and brutal police_force to his headquarters in the center of the capital . * &quot; I expect him to turn_in his papers for an early retirement and leave for the DR within 24 to 72 hours , &quot; the friend said . A U.S. military source confirmed the account , adding that Francois may have left by the end of the day Thursday . Military commander Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras and his chief_of_staff , Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby , have repeatedly denied that they will leave the country , although both are expected to resign their positions before the Oct . 15 deadline . Bloody as it was , Thursday ' s violence could be only a prelude to future horror , observers here said . Diplomats and U.S. military officials expressed deep fear that the grenade attack and the earlier bloodshed will be dwarfed by conflicts today as huge pro-Aristide demonstrations collide_with opponents who have threatened , and now have acted , to exact revenge for their impending loss of power . U.S. officials said they took Thursday ' s grenade attack &quot; extremely seriously &quot; and indicated that Lt . Gen . Hugh Shelton , commander of the American forces that began arriving here Sept . 19 to guarantee Aristide ' s eventual safe return , will meet urgently with Cedras in an effort to stop the violence . &quot; These attacks are the last , desperate acts of a dying regime , &quot; one Haitian political expert said . &quot; They are so filled with hatred and fear that they are giving_in to barbarism . They know they are dying , and they want to make certain that others die with them. &quot; U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager indicated that the U.S. military will beef_up its forces and has a detailed plan to handle any violence today . But U.S. troops will try to remain as much in the background as possible , Schrager said . &quot; We will have a significant deterrent presence at this march and at these demonstrations , &quot; he said . But he too urged restraint . &quot; What we ' re after . . . is a safe , peaceful demonstration with no provocation , no incidents and no injuries , &quot; he said . &quot; This is a chance for peaceful expression and a chance to demonstrate discipline as well. &quot;</TEXT>
