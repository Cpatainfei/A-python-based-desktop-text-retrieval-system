   <TEXT> City_Council members have rejected a $ 125-million claim filed by a witness in a murder case who said his mother was killed as a result of his scheduled testimony . Calvin Cooksey , the key witness in the murders of two Compton police_officers , said authorities ignored a July 24 note threatening his mother and other family members.On Aug . 6 , his mother , Viola Pirtle Woods , was shot to death as she pushed her shopping_cart near the Nickerson Gardens housing project in Los Angeles . Cooksey contends that his mother was killed in revenge for his scheduled testimony against Regis Thomas , who has been charged in the deaths of Compton Police_Officers Kevin Michael Burrell and James Wayne MacDonald . Police said they believe a street gang to which Thomas belonged was involved in Woods ' death , but that her death was an accident rather than an act of vengeance . Woods was caught in a cross-fire and was not the intended target , according to Los Angeles Police Detective Otis Marlow , who is investigating the case . PSYCHE PASCUAL</TEXT>
