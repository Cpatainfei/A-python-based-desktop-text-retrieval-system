   <HEADLINE> BLUE CROSS PLANS TO USE $ 2 BILLION FOR FOUNDATION ; HEALTH_CARE : THE PROPOSAL WOULD CREATE ONE OF THE NATION ' S 10 LARGEST FOUNDATIONS . BUT CONSUMER GROUPS HAVE DOUBTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Under pressure from the state and consumer advocates , Blue Cross of California announced plans Thursday to create a new public_charity with assets of more_than $ 2 billion to fund health programs throughout the state . The proposed California HealthCare Foundation would be the largest health foundation in California and one of the 10 largest foundations of any kind in the United States . The plan , which must be approved by state regulators , would initially focus_on funding primary and preventive care_for children of uninsured families , mobile health screening clinics and poison control_centers . Woodland Hills-based Blue Cross has been under considerable pressure to disclose its charitable plan since last year , when it spun_off most of its nonprofit health_insurance programs into a new for-profit subsidiary , WellPoint Health Networks . Blue Cross retained an 80 % ownership stake in WellPoint , one of the nation ' s largest publicly traded health insurers . That move set_off a flurry of criticism from state regulators , legislators and consumer advocates who said nonprofit Blue Cross was obligated to compensate the public for the tax-exempt status it had enjoyed while it built its health_insurance business . Blue Cross initially proposed to contribute $ 100 million to charity over 20 years , but state regulators said the amount was far too low . Consumer advocates on Thursday said they approve of some aspects of the new Blue Cross plan , but they expressed concern about certain details . &quot; We are very skeptical , &quot; said Maryann O ' Sullivan , project attorney for Consumers Union in San Francisco . Under the plan , Blue Cross said , it will transfer all_of its assets and public benefit activities to the new charitable foundation , separating it from the for-profit WellPoint unit . The Blue Cross name and trademark would go_over to WellPoint , whose health plans cover about 2.5 million Californians . Blue Cross ' main asset is 80 million shares of WellPoint stock -- valued at $ 2.2 billion , based on Thursday ' s closing_price of $ 27.625 , which was unchanged in New York Stock_Exchange trading . The move means that Blue Cross , one of the oldest nonprofit insurance organizations in the nation , would cease to exist as a nonprofit company under the Blue Cross name . If the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Assn . approves the transfer of the name to a for-profit entity , the California organization would be the first of the association ' s nearly 70 members to make such a switch . &quot; We believe establishing and endowing this foundation is the best way for Blue Cross to fulfill its mission to improve the quality of health_care and improve access for everyone , &quot; said Leonard D . Schaeffer , Blue Cross chairman and chief_executive . Department of Corporations Commissioner Gary Mendoza said his agency will review the Blue Cross plan . &quot; This is a significant issue for the state of California , and it ' s important that we treat it with appropriate deliberation , &quot; he said . Mendoza said he is concerned about one aspect of the plan , noting that the same 19-member board of Blue Cross would become the new directors of the California HealthCare Foundation . The new board would be chaired by Schaeffer , who also sits on the board of WellPoint . He said that could create a conflict_of_interest between what Blue Cross is calling an independent charitable foundation and WellPoint . &quot; We have previously raised the issue with Blue Cross , &quot; he said , &quot; and it remains an issue. &quot; Consumer Union ' s Sullivan put it more strongly : &quot; Leonard Schaeffer will be influential , and it ' s inappropriate for him to be there &quot; on the foundation board . J . Patrick Garner , a Blue Cross senior_vice_president , said he sees no potential conflicts with the foundation ' s board . &quot; I think there ' s almost no person you could put_on a board that would n ' t have an ax to grind , &quot; he said . The consumer group also said Blue Cross should not be responsible_for deciding which organizations are worthy of receiving charity funds , as set_out in its proposal . &quot; This is the public ' s money , not Blue Cross ' , &quot; O ' Sullivan said .</TEXT>
