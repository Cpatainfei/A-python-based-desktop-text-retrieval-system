   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; KOHL ' S REAL CHALLENGE COMES AFTER ELECTION WIN ; GERMANY : WITH SLIGHT 10-SEAT ADVANTAGE IN PARLIAMENT , HE FACES AN UPHILL BATTLE AGAINST A TOUGHENED OPPOSITION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s winning coalition government was_on the defensive Monday as political commentators pondered how long it could survive with weak allies and a toughened opposition . ARD public television drew a black_eye on a picture of the smiling Kohl , whose stubborn optimism put him first across the finish_line in Sunday ' s federal election to claim a skimpy majority of 48.4 % of the popular vote to 48.1 % for the combined opposition . That was a big loss from 54.8 % of the vote_in 1990 -- reunified Germany ' s first federal election -- and gives the government a bare 10-seat advantage in a newly expanded 672-seat Parliament . Ten seats do not leave the government much leeway -- not much room for its members_of_Parliament to opt_out of a vote or even miss a day of work , let alone defect from the coalition . At the very least , such a slim majority in a coalition government means Kohl will have a tough time implementing his political agenda -- to complete the process of German reunification and the forging of a European Union , to &quot; modernize &quot; the German economy and to trim the social_welfare state . At worst , his coalition eventually unravels at its tender seams . &quot; This majority will have to be defended for four years from one parliamentary vote to the next , &quot; said ARD commentator Nikolaus Brender . The 64-year-old Kohl waves_off naysayers , vowing to finish_out a fourth four-year term that would make him Germany ' s longest-reigning leader since 19th-Century Chancellor Otto von_Bismarck . &quot; A majority is a majority , &quot; Kohl said Monday , quoting former Chancellor Willy Brandt , a Social Democrat who governed with a 12-seat advantage in Parliament . Kohl said his predecessor , Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , had a 10-seat majority like his own , &quot; and it still took us ( six years ) to take_over the government. &quot; Kohl ' s political enemies are not wasting any time . The Social Democrats prepared to take_advantage of tensions already evident in the chancellor ' s three-party coalition and predicted Kohl would fall before the end of his term . As the Bundesbank on Monday urged Kohl to carry_out promised cuts_in federal budget_deficits , defeated Social Democratic leader Rudolf Scharping vowed to be an opposition watchdog on jobs , social_welfare and the ecology . His party was strengthened in Parliament ' s lower house , or Bundestag , and most likely increased its majority in the upper house , or Bundesrat . Leaders of the leftist Greens Party , which made its way back into Parliament with 7.3 % of the vote , said they hope the opposition can force Kohl into new elections in two years . Kohl faces challenges within his own Christian Democratic Union and his coalition , as well . The CDU , together with its Bavarian sister party , the Christian Social Union , remains the largest political bloc in the country , but their coalition partner , the liberal Free Democratic Party , saw its vote plummet to 6.9 % from 11 % in 1990 . The liberal_party , which has shared power with most post-war governments , also has lost seats in the last nine state legislative elections , including three on Sunday . On Monday , Christian Democratic leaders complained that the liberal_party had survived only by usurping the votes of their supporters , who wanted to save the small party -- and the coalition -- from extinction . The more conservative CSU , meanwhile , said it had grown stronger than the liberals in the election and should have a greater voice in policy-making . CSU leaders said the Free Democrats should give_up at least one of their five Cabinet posts -- possibly the Justice Ministry -- and give ground on law-and-order issues . They have blocked a government measure to allow the bugging of private telephones for criminal investigations . Free Democrat leaders , however , made_it clear that they plan to flex their weakened muscles even more now that Kohl needs their every vote_in Parliament . They acknowledge that they can rebuild themselves and forge a new identity only if they are seen as independent of the Christian Democrats . The Free Democrats ' ace is the possibility that they could abandon the coalition to support a Social Democratic government . The two parties formed a government in 1969 , making Brandt chancellor . The party denies any interest in joining the Social Democrats again , although FDP floor_leader Hermann Otto Solms noted that &quot; now we have an alternative. &quot; The Social Democrats , Greens and liberals would have enough votes_in the new Parliament to form a government if they should choose to do so . The new Parliament is to meet before Nov . 15 with an inaugural speech by its eldest member , in this case Stefan Heym , an eastern German writer who won as part of the reformed Communist_Party of Democratic Socialism . The PDS won 30 seats in the new Parliament and promises to &quot; engage in debate &quot; with the traditional parties led by westerners . They are likely to vote with the Social Democrats on major social and economic issues , even though the Social Democrats insist they would never form a federal_government with the former Communists . The PDS vote_in the East , like the increased vote for Social Democrats across the country , is seen by the German press as a sign that many voters are tired_of Kohl ' s 12-year government and of the recession that has hit Germany in recent years . Kohl ' s slim victory , they say , is not so_much a confirmation of a job well done as nervousness about change . Before Sunday ' s vote , Kohl announced that he would not run_for a fifth term in 1998 , feeding speculation about his successor and intensifying the jockeying between centrists and conservatives in the party . After the vote , a politically weakened Kohl can no longer expect to name his own replacement .</TEXT>
