   <TEXT> Giggles . that ' s what she gets for uttering the F-word . Naturally . Hands on the hips of her faded jeans , her lipsticked smile starting to crack , Lucy Swindell is perched casually at the podium , calling the swim coach &quot; a damn , picky bastard , &quot; making snide comments about the new girl ' s butt . She saunters around , ticking_off a string of forbidden phrases -- words that rhyme with &quot; class , &quot; &quot; spit , &quot; &quot; witch &quot; and , of course , &quot; luck. &quot; Now the teen-agers are laughing out loud , trying to swallow nervous snickers as this 51-year-old woman -- their teacher , for God ' s sake -- forges ahead : &quot; It wasn ' t exactly an orgy of pleasure for me , you dumb . . . . &quot; * Not exactly the vocabulary expected from a high_school English_teacher , but Swindell is just reading aloud from the assigned text , Judith Guest ' s novel &quot; Ordinary People. &quot; Swindell has been teaching from this book at Kennedy High in La Palma , an Orange County suburb , for more_than a decade . For just as long , people have been telling her -- and teachers across the nation -- not to . &quot; Ordinary People &quot; is among the most frequently challenged books nationwide , says the Washington-based constitutional liberties defense group People for the American Way . Last year , California led the nation with more censorship struggles than any other state -- one of them concerning &quot; Ordinary People &quot; occurred in the Anaheim Union High_School District . To delve beneath the political debate , The Times spent a month studying the book alongside Swindell ' s students . A reporter watched classroom sessions , then read students ' personal reflections in daily journals , formal essays , and poems exploring the characters ' feelings . Published in 1976 and later made into a film that won an Academy Award for best picture , &quot; Ordinary People &quot; is a 263-page bestseller about 17-year-old Conrad Jarrett , who grew_up pampered in suburban Chicago then lost his big_brother , Buck , in a boating accident . Racked with guilt over Buck ' s death , the teen-ager slits his wrist and is committed to a psychiatric_hospital . Despite problems in communicating with his harried tax attorney father and self-centered socialite mother , the boy survives . But it remains unclear whether the family will . So what ' s the big fuss ? Well , there ' s the frank talk_about suicide . Fights between parent and child , including some harsh back talk ; musings about masturbation and premarital intercourse between Con and his girlfriend . Plus , the teen-agers in the book talk like teen-agers , which means slang and swearing . Swindell says she teaches the book to help build cross-generational discussion of dysfunctional families and teen-age estrangement . that ' s just what keeps it on the firing_line . Critics dislike Guest ' s portrayal of teen-age and family life and fear that reading about the Jarretts ' inability to communicate will stifle dialogue between teen-agers and parents rather than foster it . &quot; It has no place in a teen-ager ' s hands in an English_class , &quot; said Treva Brown of Anaheim , a single mother of four who led the local protest against the novel . Brown lists 26 reasons &quot; Ordinary People &quot; doesn ' t belong on district- and state-approved reading lists . Language , sexuality and suicide are her top concerns , but she also contends that the story is boring , the author is unimportant and the vocabulary is too simple to merit inclusion in the curriculum . &quot; I raised ( my ) kid to be a fine young_man who doesn ' t curse , who doesn ' t swear , who believes that sex before marriage is wrong , &quot; Brown said . &quot; I put him in the public_school system expecting them to go beyond what I had given him , and they give him this nonsense . It was a slap in my face and a slap in my son ' s face. &quot; The Anaheim school_board and the state_Department of Education have rejected Brown ' s request to ban the book , and a recall movement against several Anaheim school_board members failed in April . But the controversy continues , with Brown promising to revive the issue in next fall ' s election . Meanwhile , &quot; Ordinary People &quot; is still being taught . * Swindell ' s sophomore English_classes sit in a four-row horseshoe , surrounded by posters praising racial unity , world peace and environmentalism . One front-row seat contains Sean Temple , a hockey lover whose writing shows sharp wit and intellect . Nearby is Mike Caira , who flirts a lot with the girls behind him , then flirts_with Swindell to escape punishment by detention . Then there ' s Brian Castles , a bright boy whose father also teaches English at Kennedy . Kristen Vetica is_quiet and seems unmoved by &quot; Ordinary People , &quot; but her journal reveals something else . Swindell ' s yearlong syllabus includes the requisite Shakespeare , &quot; Julius Caesar &quot; ; the classic English-class tomes &quot; To Kill a Mockingbird &quot; and &quot; Lord of the Flies &quot; ; &quot; Fahrenheit 451 , &quot; Ray Bradbury ' s futuristic tale of book burning ; Lorraine Hansbury ' s play &quot; A Raisin in the Sun &quot; ; and &quot; Ordinary People. &quot; Some books are there for lessons in literary structure , vocabulary , character development , metaphor and narrative style . &quot; Ordinary People , &quot; she says , provides life lessons . They begin with the title . &quot; One of the things we ' re going to determine in this novel is that there is no such thing as ordinary people , &quot; the teacher says . &quot; We ' re all ordinary , but we ' re all extraordinary in one way. &quot; Swindell knows that relatively few teen-agers will lose a sibling to tragedy , but that most have trouble talking to their parents . Only a handful ever step inside a psychiatric_hospital , but all_of them shudder before their first date and stress out over extracurricular_activities . Some , like Conrad , are in therapy . Even more , like Conrad , have fistfights with former friends . They ' ve lied to their parents , kept secrets and worried about the changes in their bodies . One morning , Swindell takes a poll : What are teen-agers ' biggest problems ? Of 33 students in one class , 17 name drugs as their No . 1 worry . Eleven say sex . Five : parents . Three : violence . Four : depression . &quot; Peer pressure ? &quot; Swindell suggests . They all nod . Later , writing in the journals Swindell requires them to keep all year , the students list their personal troubles . Too young to drive ; too poor to afford auto insurance . There are divorce survivors , and veterans of switching schools -- or switching countries . One boy lives here ; his parents work in Taiwan . A girl has an alcoholic stepfather . Another ' s mother &quot; works two jobs and when she comes_home she sleeps . We don ' t have time for each other. &quot; A white student ' s mother won ' t allow her to date blacks . Another student ' s father doesn ' t allow dating at all . * The students are lost in the opening pages . To have a reason to get_up in the morning , it is necessary to posses s a guiding principle . A belief of some kind . A bumper sticker , if you will . People in cars on busy freeways call to each other Boycott Grapes , comfort each other Honk If You Love Jesus , joke with each other Be Kind to Animals -- Kiss a Beaver . They identify , they summarize , they antagonize with statements of faith . Guest confuses them by alternating narrators , switching between Conrad and his father from one chapter to the next . They hate Conrad ' s stream-of-consciousness blabber . Many of the cultural references seem dated -- they don ' t get_it . A week passes , and half the class hasn ' t cracked a page ; the assignment calendar says they should be through Chapter 15 , but the students admit they are_on Chapter 3 , maybe Chapter 4 . There aren ' t enough books for everyone , so Swindell offers 25 bonus points to people who bring their own , and keeps begging the district for more copies . She keeps reading aloud , and devotes a class to silent reading . Arms folded across his book_bag , Sean is silent , but not reading . Sean is an &quot; A &quot; student , but &quot; Ordinary People &quot; strikes him as , well , kind of ordinary . &quot; I guess it ' s worth reading , but I don ' t know if anybody in this class really wants to read ( anything ) , &quot; he said . &quot; Most people are probably thinking it ' s kind of lame. &quot; In the book , Con is a very troubled boy , stuck_in a complicated life . He missed final_exams getting shock_therapy in the hospital , so now he ' s stuck_in junior_classes -- his friends are all seniors . He can ' t stand his once-beloved swim team ; it reminds him of his dead brother . Worst of all , Conrad thinks his mother wishes he had died instead of Buck when the boys got caught in a storm while sailing . In class , Swindell focuses_on the family_relationships . One morning , the students sit with markers and white_paper , brainstorming in groups , making lists of &quot; things that tear us apart as a family &quot; and &quot; what holds us together. &quot; Another day , the groups prepare skits depicting a typical day in the life of various stereotypical families . For the first major writing project in connection with the novel , each student interviews a relative , then writes an autobiographical family history . &quot; I want to learn more about your family , &quot; Swindell says . &quot; I want you to learn more about your family. &quot; For many , it is the first time in a while they have spoken_to their parents about school -- or about anything , really , beyond negotiating curfew or borrowing the car . A boy who failed English in the fall is the first to turn_in the essay ; his mother calls Swindell , jubilant , saying : &quot; My son actually talked to me about an assignment ! &quot; Another student writes 28 pages . Kristin Jondle and Ronnie Ellison usually stride into class together , sometimes grab a smooch before the bell rings , then sit side_by_side in the back row . As the teacher talks , they hold hands across desks . She leans her head on his shoulder and fiddles_with his fingers . Their smiling eyes lock whenever Swindell talks_about Conrad and his girlfriend , Jeanine , whenever the classroom discussion turns_to dating and romance and sex . Conrad ' s head is_on his arm , one hand curved around her breast . . . . His heart floats inside his chest . His skin feels branded everywhere that she has touched him . . . . Swindell reads from Chapter 30 as the nervous laughter and snickers begin anew . Gently , he asks her , because now he is her protector against the world , &quot; Did I hurt you ? &quot; Kristin and Ronnie have been dating about a year , and have not gone all_the way . Since reading &quot; Ordinary People , &quot; they ' ve been bugging Swindell and her boyfriend to join them on a double date . And the book has helped the young couple discuss sex in a new way , Kristin says . &quot; You need sex out_in the open . Teen-agers these days are more explorative , &quot; she writes in her journal . &quot; Parents don ' t want to talk_about it , so books or magazines are teen-agers ' only source. &quot; * &quot; Suicide , &quot; a student calls_out , &quot; is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. &quot; They ' ve finished the book , and psychologist Sharon Garrett is visiting class for the day , trying to debunk some common myths . Like the notion that if somebody says they want to commit suicide , they ' re probably not serious . Or that once people try to kill themselves , they never get_over suicidal feelings . Or that suicide is random , arising without warning . &quot; I tried so many different things . Starvation , a blade , and other stuff , too , &quot; one student writes in her journal , recalling her own suicide attempts several years before . &quot; I even tried to overdose on Tylenol . I guess I just wanted attention and I couldn ' t get any because of my attitude problem . &quot; To even think_about it now I feel so stupid . I ' m glad I didn ' t kill myself. &quot; Conrad seems glad , too , until he reads in the newspaper that a friend from the psychiatric_hospital has actually killed herself . Reeling with pain , the boy ' s thoughts race back to the boat accident , his bloody suicide attempt , and his long hospital stay . He walks swiftly , without direction . To calm himself . To get_away from dreams , because there are worse ones and he doesn ' t want to remember them , doesn ' t want to think at all , less intense , less intense , but how to do_it ? Kristen Vetica , a 15-year-old basketball star , gets glassy-eyed as Swindell reads the frightful passage . She ' s thinking_of her own friend , who shot himself to death while Kristen was reading the novel . &quot; There will always be somebody that was going_to commit suicide and there ' s nothing that anybody can do about it , &quot; she sighs . &quot; If you don ' t talk to anyone and tell what ' s going_on then no one ' s ever going_to know how you ' re feeling inside. &quot; All of a sudden , the students have gotten_into it . They bring_in anecdotes of_their_own family life , their own alienation , their own curiosities about growing_up . &quot; Finally a book we can relate to , &quot; one girl says . &quot; A book to help us understand we ' re not alone. &quot; Still , things get sticky . Mike , a precocious student who gets good grades but doesn ' t like to pay_attention , asks permission one morning to use profanity for a classroom exercise about family . &quot; We need to , &quot; the boy says . &quot; Just a little bit , to get our point across. &quot; Holding up the book , Mike reminds the teacher how Guest employs racy language to make her characters more real , her story come_alive . &quot; How come they can but we can ' t ? &quot; Now Swindell is giggling , like the class did that first day when she read the text aloud . &quot; There ' s a difference , &quot; she says , shaking her head in a firm &quot; no &quot; to Mike ' s request , &quot; between using it in a literary piece_of_work and using profanity to put people down. &quot; Nearly 20 years after it was published , author Guest is surprised &quot; Ordinary People &quot; is still making headlines , especially for the language . &quot; The themes in the book are way more threatening than the language , &quot; Guest said of the book that earned an award for best first novel of 1976 . &quot; The process of ( Conrad ' s ) recovery is also the story of his autonomy , learning that neither of his parents are perfect , and learning that he can ' t keep living_by these rules that he doesn ' t believe_in , &quot; Guest said . &quot; That is the kind of material that some people think is subversive and threatening -- you can cover that all by complaining about the language. &quot;</TEXT>
