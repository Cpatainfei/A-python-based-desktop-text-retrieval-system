   <HEADLINE> ON-LINE MICE AREN ' T STIRRING ; CYBER SHOPPING LACKS APPEAL OF TRIP TO MALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When buying things for himself , Rob Lingelbach is a cutting-edge consumer who would rather head for his computer than the mall . The technically adept Lingelbach can order his choices from a computer_screen in a flash . But when it comes_to buying gifts , not even Lingelbach shops from the on-line shopping services . Instead , the computer-savvy Angeleno becomes the old-fashioned mall maven who wants a shopping experience that is touchy-feely and filled with scents . &quot; I have a specific product in mind when I shop for myself , &quot; Lingelbach explained . &quot; But I browse when I ' m looking_for a gift , and it ' s easier to browse in a store because you can see and touch the product. &quot; On the computer , he notes , &quot; you can ' t use your nose to shop for cologne. &quot; This is hardly the sort of customer the on-line shopping services have_in_mind at this time_of_year as they scramble to become players in the holiday retailing sweepstakes . And Lingelbach is the rule , not the exception . Confronted with limits even devotees acknowledge andplagued by the coolness of the all-important female shopper , on-line retailing has proven a disappointment . Though it has evolved from a novelty in the early 1980s to a retail alternative that offers products from hundreds of major store chains and catalogue operators , computer shopping remains a distant also-ran to its prime competitors : mail-order catalogues and television shopping networks . While computer-based retailing is expected to generate a paltry $ 136 million in sales this year , cataloguers will take_in a whopping $ 40 billion , industry_analysts say . And TV shopping channels such_as QVC and Home Shopping Network will realize more_than $ 2 billion . Of course , television retailers and catalogue operators can ' t offer consumers the feel , touch and scent of products , either . But they succeed largely because they get the attention and holiday season dollars of women . On the other hand , only about 14 % of on-line shoppers are women , industry_analysts say . &quot; On-line shoppers are primarily men who have a lot of experience with computers on_the_job , &quot; said Ethel Klein , publisher of EDK Associates , which specializes in market research on female consumers . &quot; On-line shopping is not very user-friendly to women because they have less experience with computers . That situation is changing because young_girls are getting early exposure to computers. &quot; But on-line retailers have also had difficulty attracting those who already use computer services . Only 25 % of those subscribing_to cyber services such_as Prodigy , America Online and CompuServe shop in the virtual malls those companies provide , according to some industry estimates . More of those companies ' subscribers use the electronic_mail feature or other menu items available on line . Undaunted by the disappointing response to past appeals , on-line services are now responding with bolder marketing and new products designed to make computer-assisted shopping more interactive and interesting . Among the new products are electronic &quot; catalogues &quot; on CD-ROM , which offer clearer color images of merchandise than those found on traditional on-line services . Some of these disks also offer stereo sound and faster product-search capability . 2Market , a computer-based shopping service launched this month , is among the entrants to this brave newer_world of retailing . The company offers a single CD-ROM containing thousands of brand-name products from more_than two_dozen retailers , for a subscription price of $ 19.95. The 2Market disk features such big retailing names as Spiegel , Sharper Image and Nature Company . It also includes software programming that comes_up with gift ideas when the shopper provides criteria such_as a cost range and the age , gender and special_interests of the recipient . But some analysts are dubious whether many shoppers -- accustomed to no-cost browsing in_stores and in the dozens of catalogues that come_in the mail -- are prepared to pay money for a catalogue of catalogues on a disk . &quot; A subscription price for the disk is ludicrous , &quot; said Joshua Harris , president of New York-based Jupiter Interactive Productions Inc. , an on-line consulting_company . &quot; Can you imagine the Beverly Center charging an admission_price ? &quot; Many retailers are also cautious about the immediate prospects . Lands ' End , the big catalogue merchandiser , has been_on line on Prodigy and CompuServe for two years . Lands ' End opted for space on the new 2Market product because it -- like other retailers on the CD-ROM -- was given the opportunity to design its own presentation . &quot; What we ' ve seen on line is very primitive , and the presentation is very flat , &quot; said Michael Atkin , vice_president of marketing at Lands ' End . &quot; We ' re involved because we want to find_out if people want to shop this way. &quot; But 2Market ' s founders -- Apple Computer Inc. and America Online -- argue that CD-ROM technology ' s superior graphics will help overcome the drawbacks to cyber shopping that have so far overwhelmed its advantages of convenience . &quot; In the 1980s , shoppers expressed a big need for convenience , and consumers want even more of it in the 1990s because they have even less free_time , &quot; said Thomas Burt , chief operating officer of 2Market . 2Market ' s marketing studies indicate that its potential customer base is a time-conscious upscale household in which each spouse works , generating a combined average income of about $ 75 # 000 . Of course , 2Market is aiming at households with computers -- and that market is growing steadily . An estimated 37 million U.S. households have computers , and about 10 million of those computers have the CD-ROM_drive needed to generate interactive pictures and sound from a disk . There should be computers in at least 40 million homes by 1995 -- and 17 million will have CD-ROM technology , according to industry projections . Other companies are also exploring this retailing frontier . Contentware Inc. in White Plains , N.Y. , produces a CD-ROM that carries catalogue items from retailers such_as J.C. Penney , Spiegel and Marshall Field . The Canadian firm Magellan recently introduced CD-ROM-based shopping software called the Merchant . And CompuServe , one of the on-line services giants , last summer introduced a CD-ROM that includes Brooks Bros . and 11 other merchandisers . &quot; On-line retailing is still in its early stages , and some retailers have been disappointed with the results , &quot; said Lorraine Sileo , an industry_analyst at Simba Information , a market research firm in Wilton , Conn . &quot; But CD-ROM-based shopping is an attractive alternative to traditional on-line shopping , and it ' s part of the effort to find the right formula. &quot; Meanwhile , in cyberspace just as in real malls , the last-minute holiday fever is at a high_pitch . Just this week , CompuServe is rushing_out a special holiday disk . And its Electronic Mall , with more_than 130 merchants , is pushing discounted merchandise and featuring contests to lure customers . One of CompuServe ' s electronic merchants -- a company called the Gift Sender -- is sponsoring a &quot; We Believe in Fruitcake &quot; contest in which shoppers are asked to describe ways to make use of a fruitcake without eating it .</TEXT>
