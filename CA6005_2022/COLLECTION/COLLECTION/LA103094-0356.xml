   <HEADLINE> PROP . 187 BACKERS COUNTING_ON MESSAGE , NOT STRATEGY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For months , the California ballot measure known as Proposition 187 -- which has focused attention nationwide on the divisive issue of illegal immigration -- enjoyed runaway support in spite of an official campaign that is ill-financed , loosely organized and at times seemingly adrift . Pro-187 forces , unable to hire a big-name consultant or mount an effective advertising effort , instead relied_on Gov . Pete Wilson and others to carry their message on the airwaves . In the critical days before the election , the movement ' s most colorful advocate is touring South_Africa and its enigmatic , secretive chairman is so uncomfortable with the press that he flees from some journalists , refuses to talk to others and barely conceals his disdain for most of the rest . Initiative proponents are often unavailable for public forums or stay away to avoid hostile opponents . In the face of such shortcomings , however , proponents have banked on The Message : the widely held perception that an &quot; invasion &quot; of illegal immigrants is causing economic hardship and eroding the lifestyles of U.S. citizens and authorized immigrants . This no-strategy strategy seemed destined to produce an extraordinary electoral success -- until now . Abruptly the scenario anti-187 activists have long predicted , that voter approval would fall as Election_Day nears , appears to be coming_to pass . The latest Los Angeles Times Poll shows that support for the initiative has dropped dramatically -- from a comfortable 26-point cushion earlier this month to a 10-point margin last week . The Field Poll records a parallel decline in approval rates for Proposition 187 , which would bar illegal immigrants from receiving public_school education and any of the limited publicly funded non-emergency health_care programs they now qualify for , including immunizations and prenatal care . In another campaign , experts say , such a surge in opposition might prompt a brisk counter-response by advocates . A barrage of commercials would serve to reinforce the all-important central message , quell growing doubts and reassure the elderly and other core backers . &quot; Right now I would think they would need to recap what ' s going_on , assess the damages , and see what direction they want to take the campaign , &quot; said Donna Lucas , a Sacramento-based political consultant . &quot; They need to be going_into the last two weeks with a proactive strategy. &quot; But Ron S . Prince , the Tustin accountant who is chairman of the pro-187 forces , almost bristles_at the suggestion of a tactical rethinking , stressing the &quot; grass-roots &quot; origins of an initiative placed on the ballot with more_than 600 # 000 signatures . &quot; We ' re just going_to keep_on doing what we ' re doing , and then we ' ll all wait and see on Election_Day how it works , &quot; Prince said in his characteristically hushed voice after a public meeting of pro-187 forces in a Garden Grove bank_building last week . &quot; We ' re down so close to the election that there really isn ' t a lot of time to worry. &quot; In reality , the pro-187 campaign and its allies are switching gears , calling_in volunteers , accelerating fund-raising_efforts and hitting the airwaves . &quot; For us to let_up and coast to a victory is something we really don ' t know how to do , &quot; said Prince , who leaped from obscurity to become a kind of Howard Jarvis of the contentious immigration debate . Whether the slippage now evident in the polls will continue remains to be seen . Though a landslide now seems unlikely , the measure still appears destined for passage . &quot; I ' d rather be in our shoes than in our opponents ' shoes , &quot; said Alan C . Nelson , former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner who is a co-author of the measure . Whatever happens on Nov . 8 , proponents have indisputably scored a tremendous success . Their ill-funded movement , born in suburban living_rooms throughout California , has helped shift the terms of the nation ' s great debate on immigration , possibly for a generation or longer . And it has put pressure on the Clinton_Administration to take action , including bolstering enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border . &quot; We ' ve already won , &quot; said Robert R . Kiley , the Yorba Linda-based consultant who is managing the campaign . &quot; After this passes in November , it ' s going from state to state to state. &quot; Despite backers ' clear accomplishments and still-comfortable lead in the polls , voter surveys show that opponents ' aggressive campaign tactics have managed to engender the kernel of doubt essential for any &quot; No &quot; campaign . &quot; Generally speaking , if you give someone a reason to vote ' no ' on something they ' ll do_it , &quot; said Arnold Steinberg , a political strategist who usually works with Republicans . It is a fact not lost on the measure ' s supporters . With barely a week left until Election_Day , the California Republican_Party -- already a major financial contributor -- is touting Proposition 187 with 2 million &quot; door-hangers , &quot; urging residents to vote &quot; yes , &quot; as well as in slate mailers addressed to targeted households . GOP volunteers are also working the telephones to help overcome the fund-raising lag . On the media front , Wilson -- who has made Proposition 187 a mainstay of his reelection campaign -- began airing two new television commercials last week reaffirming his support . This week , a series of pro-187 radio spots is scheduled to hit the airwaves statewide . The ads , analysts agree , will help . But , already trailing in fund-raising by almost 3 to 1 , pro-187 forces acknowledge that a shortage of cash is making_it increasingly difficult to disseminate their message -- just as the other side has bolstered its campaign against the proposition . &quot; It ' s very frustrating , &quot; said Barbara A . Coe , who heads the California Coalition for Immigration Reform . The Huntington Beach-based umbrella organization is a co-sponsor of Proposition 187 and is among those bankrolling the radio campaign . Although the official initiative committee is lagging in fund raising , assists from Wilson and other allies have provided a considerable boost , giving the measure much more exposure than the opposition . The campaign recently solicited contributions from hundreds of supporters who previously donated an average of $ 23 . On Friday , supporters held their first major fund-raiser at an Anaheim eatery . Along with generating much-needed cash , the $ 20-per-person event was also designed to attract media attention to the pro-187 effort . Seeking_out journalists is a novel step for a campaign unusually wary about the press . In fact , Prince himself once fled from reporters and has refused to speak_to several whose articles he disliked . Organizers were so outraged when the Orange County Register recently printed the address of the pro-187 campaign headquarters -- along with a photograph of the building -- that supporters accused the newspaper of endangering lives . &quot; All they omitted was a map and a loaded . 45 handgun ! &quot; the California Coalition for Immigration Reform declared in its newsletter . Normally routine press etiquette -- such_as returning reporters ' telephone messages and providing information packets -- has proved problematic for the pro-187 leadership , making_it more difficult for journalists to report advocates ' viewpoints . By contrast , the comparatively well-financed opposition has eagerly courted the media . At the pro-187 session in Garden Grove last week , a pervasive dread of the press prevailed . Speakers and members of the audience alike spoke_of the &quot; liberal media &quot; being engaged in an orchestrated &quot; smear &quot; campaign . Beyond what they perceive as biased news accounts , many are outraged about attempts by anti-proposition forces to confront and shout_down 187 representatives and link the measure to a New York foundation that critics call white_supremacist . The allegation is heatedly denied by the foundation and assailed by proposition backers . &quot; Not only is the opposition better financed , but they ' re ruthless , and they ' ve tried to shut people up , &quot; said Rep . Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) , who spoke at the meeting here and has made a name for himself as a hard-liner on illegal immigration . &quot; I think people are being confused by this incredible propaganda barrage that is being unleashed on them. &quot; Unlawful immigrants , Rohrabacher told the audience , represent the &quot; liberal / left foot_soldiers in the next decade. &quot; The crowd of 100 or so who came_to listen to an array of pro-187 pitches provides a window of sorts into the core support for Proposition 187 . Participants were overwhelmingly white suburbanites , including many elderly . Most of them are clearly troubled by population_shifts that , they said , have rapidly transformed their once-familiar communities into strange and dangerous places where English is heard less and less . Illegal immigration is to blame , they all agreed . &quot; We are becoming a Third_World state , &quot; said Robert Lacey , a computer executive who traveled from Riverside County to attend . Many of his neighbors have opted to leave California , he noted , adding that his home ' s value had plummeted and his wife had found it difficult to find work because she could not speak Spanish . Expressing skepticism about the latest poll results , proponents theorize that respondents are hesitant to show their real feelings about the volatile issue and may be deliberately misleading pollsters . &quot; Supporters are going underground , declining to state their intention , &quot; said Barbara Kiley , the mayor of Yorba Linda and state co-chairwoman of Proposition 187 . ( She is also the wife of Robert Kiley , the campaign consultant. ) &quot; They get intimidated. &quot; Yet outside consultants who watch the polls closely say pro-187 organizers can blame themselves in part for the measure ' s apparent nose-dive in popularity , faulting a contradictory campaign strategy . In attempting to counter near-apocalyptic charges that the passage of Proposition 187 will spread disease and crime , Wilson and other adherents have themselves downplayed short-term impacts should the measure pass . The proposal to ban illegal immigrants from public_schools and other major provisions will inevitably face court challenges that will delay implementation for years , they stress . &quot; As much as I ' d like to see services to the undocumented stopped immediately , &quot; Barbara Kiley said , &quot; I don ' t believe that ' s going_to happen. &quot; Although reassuring to some , such statements inevitably dilute the point , observers say . &quot; that ' s a weak message , &quot; said Allan Hoffenblum , a Los Angeles Republican political consultant . &quot; They need something stronger. &quot; Also narrowing Proposition 187 ' s once-commanding lead , observers agree , is the broadening base of opposition . Recent denunciations by Jack F . Kemp and William J . Bennett , both prominent Republicans , may have provided conservatives and moderates in both parties with right-wing &quot; cover &quot; for their opposition . A general lack of cohesion within the pro-187 camp is testament to the unwieldy nature of the campaign , which was born in neighborhood meetings and quickly mushroomed into a loose-knit , statewide coalition . Often , members in different regions and positions have varying agendas and largely call their own shots . One major faction consists_of a group of seasoned political veterans headed by two proposition co-authors : ex-immigration commissioner Nelson and his former West Coast lieutenant , Harold W . Ezell . The pair broke_away from the principal group this year to form Americans Against Illegal Immigration , which is focusing_on the fight at the national level . The central &quot; Save Our State &quot; campaign committee is composed of a separate , less experienced nucleus of supporters led by Prince . His two state co-chairpersons are Yorba Linda Mayor Kiley and Assemblyman Richard L . Mountjoy ( R-Arcadia ) . A group of Bay Area supporters directs the Northern California front . Although united by the cause , the coalition has splintered on personality issues , most notably between Prince and Ezell , two men with vastly different styles . Prince ' s reticent , press-shy comportment stands_in stark contrast to the hail-fellow-well-met demeanor of the gregarious Ezell , who has been known to return reporters ' calls from the other side of the world , even about stories critical of his often-provocative behavior . Initiative backers have turned_down some requests for appearances , Prince acknowledged , citing a limited number of volunteers to participate . And some sponsors seemed biased , he added . The pro-187 committee is also avoiding forums &quot; where there are combative situations , &quot; noted Kiley , the campaign consultant . &quot; We don ' t want to put our people in jeopardy. &quot; Such selective appearances , observers said , reflect a strategy based on a belief in the inevitability of victory . &quot; The pro side didn ' t really have a strategy , &quot; said Steinberg , the political consultant . &quot; The pro side took passage as fait_accompli . &quot; Although proposition organizers have endeavored to keep their public focus_on illegal immigration , the lack of cohesiveness among pro-187 forces has sometimes led to mixed messages between Prince ' s measured pronouncements and the more incendiary rhetoric from his allies in a movement that has clearly tapped into a popular vein of discontent . &quot; Multiculturalism &quot; is the favored target of Ruth Coffey , a pro-187 activist who runs Stop Immigration Now -- a member organization of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform , the initiative co-sponsor -- from her cluttered Long_Beach apartment . &quot; I have no intention of being the object of ' conquest , ' peaceful or otherwise , by Latinos , Asians , blacks , Arabs or any other group of individuals who have claimed my country , &quot; Coffey wrote recently . Another outspoken Proposition 187 supporter , Glenn Spencer , who heads a Sherman Oaks-based group called the Voice of Citizens Together , has characterized illegal immigration as &quot; part of a reconquest of the American Southwest by foreign Hispanics. &quot; Spencer added : &quot; Someone is going_to be leaving the state . It will either be them or us. &quot; Times staff writers Doreen Carvajal and Paul Feldman contributed to this story .</TEXT>
