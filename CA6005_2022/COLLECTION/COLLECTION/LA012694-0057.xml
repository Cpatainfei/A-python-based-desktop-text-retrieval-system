   <HEADLINE> HIGH_SCHOOL NOTEBOOK : DEPARTING GRANT CENTER GETS MORE THAN HANDSHAKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the first phone_calls made by Grant High basketball_Coach Howie Levine shortly after last week ' s earthquake was to former player Rick Forscutt . Forscutt , a 6-8 senior center , played his last game for Grant on Jan . 14 -- the same day escrow closed on his parents ' home . The Forscutts were set to move to Provo , Utah , the following Monday . Before the sun rose Monday , however , Levine was tempted to flee the shaken area with the Forscutts . &quot; I called_up over there to see if there was any space in the back of the car , &quot; Levine said . &quot; I was ready to go. &quot; Despite the chaos and horror that engulfed the area hours after the earthquake , the moving vans arrived on schedule at the Forscutts ' house in Van Nuys on Monday morning , and the Forscutts left the state as planned . Levine was left_behind to pick_up the pieces . * Levine is certain to miss Forscutt , who was the top rebounder and one of the leading scorers for the Lancers . Forscutt , who set a school record last season for shooting percentage ( 68.3 % ) , averaged 10.9 points and eight rebounds in 15 games this season , helping Grant ( 12-3 ) rebound from a 9-14 season a year ago . MID-VALLEY LEAGUE Sylmar Shakes ' Em Up Sylmar Athletic Director Bob Miller should have known something like this would happen . Miller , who coached the Sylmar basketball_team many years ago , should have warned Coach Jose Fernandez that the earth shakes when Sylmar is successful on the basketball_court . &quot; He said the best season he ever had was in 1971 , &quot; Fernandez said , &quot; I said , ' So , how come you didn ' t warn me this would happen. ' &quot; Sylmar has a 9-7 record and is in first place by one game in the East Valley League . Sylmar was 21-72 over the past five seasons . &quot; Someone told me when I took this job that the day Sylmar is in first place is the day the earth will end , &quot; Fernandez said . CAMINO REAL LEAGUE Dear Dan So , how do you shoot free_throws in the wind ? And how do you avoid dribbling through puddles ? Some area basketball_teams were forced by the earthquake to practice outdoors . If advice on how to do_it is needed , St . Genevieve Coach Dan Donovan is volunteering his services . Because there is no gym at St . Genevieve , Donovan is an expert on playing against the elements . &quot; I ' ve been ( practicing outdoors ) for three years , &quot; Donovan said . &quot; They should call me for advice . I feel_like I should be a consultant and make some money. &quot; NORTHWEST VALLEY In Search of . . . a Gym What ' s a guy to do ? With a majority of the gyms in the San Fernando Valley either damaged or being used as emergency relief centers , finding a place to play basketball is difficult . For the second consecutive week , all City Section games were postponed , leaving players to find ways to avoid getting rusty . Fact is , there aren ' t many options . El Camino Real swingman Charles Adams , an All-City player who lives_in the Valley , said he has been shooting around at Sherman Oaks CES High , a City school that didn ' t sustain major damage . &quot; Sometimes they let me in , &quot; Adams said . After he received word that this week ' s games also had been postponed , Adams said he planned to round_up some friends for a pick-up game . Somewhere . . . . GOLDEN LEAGUE Rolling in Palmdale Palmdale is_on a roll . Why ? Its players can spell role . The Falcons entered the week with a 9-0 record in_league play and 15-3 overall thanks to each player ' s acceptance of performing a specific task . In a 69-61 victory over Antelope Valley earlier this month , three key contributors were unavailable : Rocque Sandoval was_on a football recruiting trip to New Mexico , Maurice Wright was sidelined because of a knee injury and Shad Martin was suffering the effects of food_poisoning . Off-guard Mike Hamelin stepped_forward with his biggest night of the season , finishing with 11 points , 11 rebounds and nine assists . &quot; Having a bunch of guys who can come_off the bench has really helped , &quot; Coach Garry Phelps said . &quot; Depth has been important to us. &quot; Palmdale defeated second-place Highland , 63-57 , Friday night , with four Falcon players scoring between nine and 16 points . Staff writers Steve Elling , Jeff Fletcher , Mike Lazarus and Paige A . Leech contributed to this notebook .
