   <HEADLINE> DESPITE PROTESTS , TURKISH COURT JAILS KURDISH LEADERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Turkish court sentenced eight elected ethnic Kurdish leaders to between 3 1 / 2 and 15 years in prison Thursday , ignoring concerns expressed in the United States and the West that they were being jailed merely for expressing their views on Kurdish rights . The military-dominated state security court in the capital , Ankara , accepted secret wiretaps and speeches to find six of the defendants guilty of working for the rebel guerrillas of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party , or PKK.Two others were sentenced to 3 1 / 2 years in jail for making separatist statements . They were the only two to be released pending an appeal . U.S. State_Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the Clinton_Administration is &quot; deeply concerned &quot; about the verdicts . &quot; These heavy sentences are shocking , incomprehensible . These sentences will not help Turkey ' s image abroad or its integration with Europe , &quot; one Western ambassador in Ankara said . Diplomats said the trial will probably not divert European Union governments from concluding negotiations on a 1996 customs union with Turkey . But the European Parliament has already suspended ties with Turkey over the issue .</TEXT>
