   <HEADLINE> MOYNIHAN SEES HEALTH ALLIANCES ' DEMISE ; INSURANCE : HEAD OF POWERFUL SENATE PANEL HAS HOPE FOR OTHER KEY ELEMENTS OF CLINTON PLAN . MORE SMALL BUSINESSES MAY ESCAPE EMPLOYER MANDATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In another sign that Congress plans major changes in President Clinton ' s health_care reform proposal , the chairman of the Senate Finance_Committee on Sunday almost completely wrote_off the prospects for a major component of the initiative : the requirement that virtually all Americans join government-organized purchasing cooperatives . But Sen . Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) said the Senate could still pass revised versions of two other pillars of Clinton ' s plan : the requirement that employers contribute to health_insurance for their employees and price_controls on health_insurance premiums . And Moynihan again endorsed Clinton ' s contention that the final legislation must provide health_care coverage for all Americans -- though he signaled that it might take years to phase_in . &quot; that ' s non-negotiable as far as I ' m concerned , &quot; Moynihan said on the CBS-TV ' s &quot; Face the Nation. &quot; &quot; But it doesn ' t have to happen on July 1 of next year. &quot; Moynihan ' s comments came three days after House Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) told reporters that the Clinton plan faced major revisions . Like Moynihan , Gephardt indicated that Congress was unlikely to accept Clinton ' s proposal for the cooperatives , known as health alliances . The alliances are the centerpiece of the Administration ' s reform plan . They are intended to reduce the cost of health_care insurance by allowing consumers to pool their purchasing power , but critics maintain that they would diminish consumer choice and create a vast new bureaucracy . Asked on the CBS program if the Administration ' s health alliance proposal &quot; is probably dead , &quot; Moynihan replied : &quot; I think so. &quot; Moynihan cited the analysis of a private group of health_care experts that the alliances were &quot; too big , too_much government &quot; and created too_much uncertainty . Moynihan ' s opposite_number in the House of Representatives , Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D-Ill. ) , struck a contrasting note in a separate interview . On ABC-TV ' s &quot; This Week With David Brinkley , &quot; Rostenkowski said he was &quot; not going_to concede &quot; that the alliances would have to be dropped from the legislation -- and if that point arrives , &quot; I ' m going_to try to get something for it. &quot; Meanwhile , Vice_President Al Gore repeated the Administration ' s support for the alliances but , as the President did_in other interviews last week , also signaled flexibility on the point . &quot; If you say you ' re not going_to allow discrimination against people with pre-existing medical conditions or discrimination against small-business owners , then we think that leads you inevitably toward a kind of purchasing alliance , &quot; he said on NBC-TV ' s &quot; Meet The Press. &quot; &quot; We ' ve said that if you have a better way to do that , let ' s hear it . We don ' t think there is a better way to do it. &quot; Moynihan suggested that despite intense opposition from much of the business_community , a mandate that employers contribute to the health_insurance of their employees is not dead , as Republicans have recently suggested . But , he indicated , the legislation might exempt more small businesses from that requirement than Clinton ' s plan . Moynihan also said reports of the demise of the President ' s proposal to place price_controls on health_insurance premiums were premature . &quot; They may have to be a little bit more flexible than the first_appearance , &quot; he said , &quot; but you want to have some . . . downward pressure on prices. &quot; Sen . Phil Gramm ( R-Tex. ) , appearing on ABC , predicted that the Senate will reject the employer mandate and premium caps , as well as the health alliances . &quot; I believe that the Democrats do not have enough votes to pass a bill , &quot; he said . But Rostenkowski was more upbeat about the legislation ' s ultimate prospects , comparing the travails of Clinton ' s plan to the struggle to pass the sweeping tax reform bill of 1986 . &quot; You know , I went , in 1986 , to about 25 wakes on the ' 86 tax_bill , &quot; he said . &quot; But I never went_to a funeral. &quot; On another subject , Moynihan offered encouraging words for two ideas expected to be included in the Administration ' s welfare reform package , which also falls_under his committee ' s jurisdiction . He endorsed a plan to phase_in Clinton ' s proposed two-year benefit limit beginning with welfare recipients 25 and younger , as the task_force drafting the Administration ' s plan is likely to recommend . &quot; I like to hear that we ' re going to take the young mothers first and maybe phase into a system where everybody will be covered. &quot;</TEXT>
