   <TEXT> Calgene to Sell Genetically Engineered Cotton : The Davis , Calif.-based agricultural biotechnology company said it has received approval from the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture to sell without restriction its genetically engineered cottonseed.Calgene said its gene-altered cotton , known as BXN , is resistant to the effects of the herbicide bromoxynil , used by farmers to control morning_glory and other broadleaf weeds . Such weeds reduce the country ' s $ 4-billion cotton crop by 15 % annually , Calgene said . It said use of BXN should reduce the use of herbicides because chemicals could be used in lower doses . But the Union of Concerned Scientists issued a statement criticizing approval of Calgene ' s BXN , saying the creation of herbicide-tolerant crops will &quot; deepen U.S. farmers ' dependence on toxic chemicals. &quot;</TEXT>
