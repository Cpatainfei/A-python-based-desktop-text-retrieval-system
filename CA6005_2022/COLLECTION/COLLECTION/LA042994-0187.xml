   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ' S HATA FORMS MINORITY CABINET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bracing himself for what he called &quot; many extremely difficult problems , &quot; Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata on Thursday appointed Japan ' s first minority Cabinet in 39 years to run what was widely expected to be a short-lived government . Hata , 58 , vowed to resolve economic frictions with the United States by June , including fixing an outline for a major revision of Japan ' s tax_system . Part of that reform will be needed to meet U.S. requests to extend a single-year income_tax cut over several years to stimulate Japan ' s stagnant economy and pull_in imports . &quot; If economic issues between Japan and the United States aren ' t handled smoothly , frustrations will build_up among the two peoples , such_as ( mutual ) feelings of dislike that occurred before , &quot; Hata said . Not once during a nationally televised news_conference did the usually cheerful Hata smile . And when asked about a statement he once made describing himself as &quot; an actor &quot; to &quot; scenarios &quot; written by Ichiro Ozawa , his chief strategist , he scowled . &quot; An actor himself chooses his scripts and sometimes orders them rewritten , &quot; he said . Deserted by the Socialists in the middle of the night earlier this week , Hata ' s coalition holds only 37 % of the seats in the lower house of Parliament and 24 % in the upper chamber . But Hata insisted that the Socialists and the Liberal Democratic Party agree with many of the coalition ' s policies and said he will appeal_to them , bill by bill , for support in reform legislation . &quot; I haven ' t given_up &quot; on the Socialists returning to the Cabinet , he added . In separate news_conferences , all_of Hata ' s new ministers said they will work to see_to_it that the Cabinet will not be short-lived . But Megumu Sato , National Land Agency director , slipped from the script , saying , &quot; I don ' t know how long I will be serving. &quot; Most bets were_on late June , when Parliament is finally expected to enact the long-delayed 1994 budget , or after the July 8-10 summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in Naples , Italy , which Japan ' s prime_minister is obliged to attend . Socialists promised to cooperate to pass the budget , which they helped compile -- but nothing else . Although parliamentary deliberations on the budget normally begin earlier , the process is now scheduled to get under way May 17 . The Hata Cabinet , including eight ex-LDP members from the prime_minister ' s Renewal Party and six from the long-established , Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party , &quot; looks_like a poor_man ' s LDP government , &quot; said Tomiichi Murayama , the Socialists ' chairman . Morihiro Hosokawa , the former prime_minister who announced his resignation 20 days ago , won the nation ' s top political job last August just after his first-ever election to the lower house . Hata moved Hiroshi Kumagai from head of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry , where he had acted_as a major opponent of U.S. demands for &quot; measurable progress &quot; in market-opening , to the position of chief Cabinet secretary , in which he will coordinate Cabinet actions and serve as chief government spokesman . Eijiro Hata traded his job at the Agriculture Ministry for the MITI post . Hirohisa Fujii , a tight-fisted budget-balancer , was retained as finance_minister . And Koji Kakizawa , who defected from the LDP eight days ago , was picked as foreign_minister . Earlier , he had served as vice foreign_minister . Both Kumagai and Fujii led the bureaucracy in fruitless , often hostile trade negotiations with the United States . Utilizing &quot; Golden Week , &quot; a chain of holidays starting today and running_through May 8 , both Hata and Kakizawa immediately announced plans for trips abroad . Hata will visit Italy , France , Germany and Belgium on May 2-7 ; the new foreign_minister will tour Egypt , Israel , the Israeli-occupied territories , Jordan and Syria on May 2-8 .</TEXT>
