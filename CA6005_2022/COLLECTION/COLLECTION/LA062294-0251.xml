   <HEADLINE> MAN ARRESTED IN SALE OF BOGUS AUTOGRAPHED PHOTOS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Luftwaffe flying ace ' s signature was worth a lot of money to a Newport Beach man , police said Tuesday -- enough for him to sell hundreds of forgeries of it to unwary autograph collectors in Thousand Oaks . Thomas Shutt II , 48 , now faces charges of grand theft by fraud , they said , for selling bogus autographed photos of German World_War_II flier Erich Hartmann , the most successful fighter_pilot of all time . Shutt ' s arrest could lead to the discovery of other forgeries in the lucrative autograph trade , Ventura County Sheriff ' s Detective Stanley Weber said . &quot; We can ' t prove yet that he ' s the one who actually signed them , &quot; Weber said . &quot; We may have to start calling other dealers and see if they have dealt with Mr. Shutt before. &quot; Shutt could not be reached Tuesday for comment . He was released Monday on_his_own recognizance . The Shutt case sheds_light_on the musty world of World_War_II memorabilia dealers , who hire veterans of Allied and Axis fighting forces to sign thick stacks of photos that can sell for $ 75 to $ 100 each . Hartmann , credited with shooting_down 352 Allied warplanes -- most of them Russian -- signed dozens of photos and lithographs before his death in October . And when Shutt offered a box of Hartmann photos to Thousand Oaks-based autograph dealers Terry and Angelika Kinsella , they said they were interested . For nearly 20 years , the Kinsellas had been dealing in autographs and photos of famous and notorious historical figures under the name A Piece of History International . They had worked with the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Holocaust Museum in Los Angeles , helping to procure a document signed by Auschwitz concentration_camp Dr. Josef Mengele and overseeing preservation of letters by Jewish diarist Anne Frank . They recently published a biography of Grace Kelly , titled as she often signed her letters , &quot; With Love , Gracie. &quot; And the Kinsellas had developed a taste for &quot; militaria &quot; -- the photos , documents and autographs left_behind by famous wartime personalities , particularly from World_War_II . They even sold some of those items to Shutt over the years -- including the signature of Nazi architect Albert Speer -- for use in his own autograph business in Tustin , called King ' s Crown Gallery , Terry Kinsella said . So when Shutt announced in April that he was closing shop and offered to sell_off his inventory , the Kinsellas met him in the lush lobby of the Westlake Hyatt Regency . Showing them photocopies of letters Hartmann had written to him , Shutt offered to sell the Kinsellas a box of photographs , police said . The Kinsellas said the box contained 140 Hartmann glossies and 10 signed photos of Hans Baur , Adolf Hitler ' s personal pilot . * When Shutt opened his car trunk in the parking_lot , the couple glanced at the top of the pile and hurriedly paid him $ 1 # 500 for the lot because they were rushing_off on a publicity tour for the Kelly biography , Terry Kinsella said . But after talking_about Shutt with a fellow dealer , Kinsella says he grew suspicious . &quot; I went_to the safes , took the photos out and spread them out on the desk , and said , ' Uh-oh , definite forgeries , ' &quot; he said . Police confirm that the signatures were forged . Ink had pooled along the signature ' s looping lines , indicating the stop-and-start drawing of someone tracing an original Hartmann autograph , Kinsella said . And when he held a thin stack of photos up_to the light , Kinsella said , the signatures all stacked perfectly atop each other as if they were one . On advice of the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department , Kinsella took the photos to another autograph dealer , who also concluded that they were forged . Then the couple called Ventura County detectives . They arranged to talk to Shutt about buying his whole collection and steered him again to the Hyatt lobby , where Weber sat nearby in plainclothes , police said . &quot; I said , ' Bring everything you have , we ' ll settle_on a price , ' &quot; Kinsella said . * After a little haggling , the Kinsellas agreed to buy some of the items , including more signed Hartmann photos , for $ 4 # 200 , and took Shutt outside to consummate the deal , police said . There , he was arrested by Weber and Detectives William Gentry and Hal Sullivan . Weber said the detectives confiscated the rest of Shutt ' s collection , which includes forged signatures of at least eight to 10 other famous war figures , including renowned American fighter_pilot Joe Foss . On Tuesday , the Kinsellas said they take the blame for falling_for the alleged forgeries . &quot; We have been taken before , and every major dealer in the nation has at one time or another , &quot; Kinsella said . &quot; Our fallacy is we were really in a hurry. &quot;</TEXT>
