   <HEADLINE> TRAINS WELCOME BUT SUCCESS NO CERTAINTY ; * METROLINK EXPANSION GIVES COMMUTERS NEW OPTIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The sentiment of traffic-weary Orange County residents was evident back in 1992 when a UC Irvine survey found that people had warmed significantly to the idea of mass transit . A whopping 69 % of those surveyed said they favored a commuter rail system . While that survey was being taken , plans were underway to expand commuter rail service in Orange County . The morning and evening train operated by Amtrak crews under contract with the Orange County Transportation Authority already was operating as a supplement to regular Amtrak service , which is designed primarily as an intercity service but also happened to serve commuters . And now , last week , a new milestone : two more commuter_trains were added_to the existing one to inaugurate Metrolink service in Orange County . Metrolink is the commuter rail network that is serving an expanding part of Southern California . The question of the moment is : Will it take ? The jury for now will have to remain out . The new service certainly is welcome and encouraging , but there should be no illusions about the hard task facing those wishing to make rail commuting an important fixture . Grafting commuter rail on a region that developed around the automobile is no easy task . The evidence from the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake was not encouraging in this regard ; commuters rushed to ride Metrolink trains after the quake damaged freeways but very soon began returning to cars . But the public in Orange County certainly seems interested in the idea of rail commuting , and well it should . The county has the dubious distinction of having about the worst traffic congestion in California . This month , another poll conducted by J . Moore Methods of Sacramento for the Orange County Transportation Authority found that Orange County voters favored even further development in commuter rail : the proposed Fullerton to Irvine line that would include stops near Disneyland in Anaheim and South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa . But one of the big question_marks about the viability of commuter rail service is money . And the strong public support in that survey fell_back to about 50 % when cold fiscal reality set_in . That is , a mention of the anticipated $ 2.1-billion cost of such a line , a signal of lingering fiscal questions . Indeed , there have been persistent concerns raised by critics that passenger service won ' t ever make_up the subsidies now needed to keep it running . As for the inaugural Metrolink trains in Orange County , transportation officials were hoping eventually for more business people who might make_up the backbone of a regular ridership as several thousands of commuters and other riders rode the rails on the first day . The presence of more trains can provide such commuters with an extra cushion and ease fears that they will be late to work , or out of luck , if they miss an earlier train . Metrolink officials were wise_to offer free service through most of the week and might want to consider other enticements . Clearly , there is much work to do and many unanswered questions , but the hoopla of last week was clearly justified . The arrival of Metrolink ought to be an important moment in the annals of transportation history in Orange County .</TEXT>
