   <TEXT> What ' s On : &quot; Frasier , &quot; a half-hour comedy broadcast Thursday nights at 9:30 on NBC . Family Portrait : Frasier Crane is a Seattle psychiatrist who hosts a radio call-in show . His live-in family consists_of his father , a crotchety cop retired on disability , and his father ' s eccentric , possibly psychic caretaker , Daphne . Also living_in Seattle is Frasier ' s younger brother , Niles , a jittery little package of neuroses who ' s also a psychiatrist . Back Story : The brothers fancy themselves very different : Frasier is a Freudian , Niles a Jungian . Frasier is unhappily divorced , Niles is enmeshed in a marriage to a bizarre but wealthy woman . Yet the two men are virtual twins : Supercilious , high-strung intellectuals who banter in bon mots about their Italian shoes , knowledge of German opera and appreciation of African art . Fuse Time : The brothers are fiercely competitive . When Niles , desperate to fulfill his dream of being published , persuades Frasier to help him write a book about sibling relationships , their lifelong rivalry is laid bare . And it isn ' t pretty . Telling Quote : &quot; I ' m just fed up with being second all_the time , &quot; Niles screams just before the fisticuffs begin . &quot; I wanted to be a psychiatrist like Mom way before you did . But because you were older , you got there first . . . . By the time I get_around_to doing anything , it ' s all chewed meat ! &quot; Prescription Pad : &quot; Frasier &quot; plays the Crane brothers ' hostility for laughs , but that hostility is rooted in a real issue . The feeling of competition and resentment develops in childhood as siblings vie for their parents ' love , said Dr. Rosalyn Laudati , a psychologist who practices in Brea and Newport Beach . that ' s not where it ends , however . &quot; Sibling rivalry never dies , &quot; she said . The Crane brothers have intensified the rivalry by taking_up the same profession , a situation Laudati sees frequently . Sometimes , sibling rivalry dissipates as people grow_up , she said . &quot; If people have achieved their goals and are satisfied with their lives , there ' s less chance that sibling rivalry will get_worse , &quot; she said . &quot; But if they ' re at midlife , and they ' re unhappy . . . that can breed more resentment toward the other. &quot; With their training , the Cranes could try to undo the knot of brotherly envy . But they would be a rare case , Laudati said : &quot; Adults are rarely motivated to work_on this with their sibs unless there ' s a crisis. &quot; * Media Monitor examines the family issues raised in current films , books and television_shows .
