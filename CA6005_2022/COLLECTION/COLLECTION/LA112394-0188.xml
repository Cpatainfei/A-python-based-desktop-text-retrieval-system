   <HEADLINE> NATIVE DISHES ; PROFESSOR NOTES THAT THANKSGIVING FEASTS PRECEDED THE PILGRIMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As families prepare_for their Thanksgiving feasts , a Chapman University sociology professor reminds celebrants that one of today ' s most popular American holidays was founded on the blood , land and history of Native_American peoples . &quot; Thanksgiving is a happy time for sharing . But we need to remember there is a dual reality . . . when reflecting upon the origins of this holiday , &quot; said Professor Paul Apodaca , himself of Navajo , Mexican and Spanish descent . During the earliest colonial encounters , Apodaca said , there was both a willingness to give and the determination to conquer . Today ' s Thanksgiving dinner traces its origins to the Iroquois ' annual Green_Corn Dance , which the pilgrims joined in celebration of the harvest . It was a tradition established long before the settlers began to observe a Thanksgiving ritual in 1621 , and is still practiced in some Native_American communities . But there was also the often ignored Pequote War at Block Island , R.I. , where 600 to 700 Pequote Indians were massacred in 1637 by colonists , who marked the conquest with a victory feast that colonial leader John Endicott decreed the official Thanksgiving_Day in Massachusetts . As traditions evolve through generations , Apodaca said , the bad is frequently forgotten . &quot; We Native_Americans are usually the only ones who remember the tragedies , &quot; Apodaca said . Margaret Sarracino , a member of the Creek Seminole tribe , spent the lunch hour Tuesday teaching Newport Beach elementary_school pupils about what types of food that actually graced the tables at the first Thanksgiving dinner . Speaking_to 35 Mariners Elementary third-graders dressed in beaded T-shirts and feathered headdresses , Sarracino explained that food was the crucial link between the newly arrived settlers and agriculturally rich indigenous peoples during the colonial period . While children tasted dishes cooked with venison , duck and leeks , ingredients used in the original Thanksgiving meal , Sarracino debunked the widely held idea that roasted turkey and mashed potatoes were served at the 1621 dinner . The culinary experience was quite a surprise for some youngsters . &quot; I didn ' t know they didn ' t have glasses and Sprite back then , &quot; said 8-year-old Jennifer Grummerman . Wearing traditional Indian garb , Sarracino told the children her family sometimes cooks turkey for Thanksgiving , but stews and breads commonly used by all 500 Indian nations usually adorn the table . Referring to the Green_Corn Dance , which takes its name from the light green husks of the newly harvested corn , Sarracino said corn was a native_American foodstuff that was a very important staple in the diet of Native_Americans , and remains an important element of the world ' s food consumption . Apodaca said that because many European foods were based on cereals such_as wheat and barley , plants vulnerable to wind and hail , the European continent was frequently stricken by famine . But foods native to the Americas , such_as potatoes , chilies and beans , are heartier and have higher nutritional value , Apodaca said . &quot; Native_American foods created the Europe that we think_of , &quot; said Apodaca , attributing Europe ' s population growth during the 17th to the 20th centuries to foods imported from the New World . Comparing European and African population growth during that 300-year span , Apodaca said the better nourished Europeans increased sixfold in number , while population growth in Africa only doubled . With the largest Native_American population in the country ( more_than 242 # 000 according to the 1990 U.S. Census ) , California has a special reason to cherish Native_American history , Apodaca said . &quot; Native_Americans are true patriots , carrying alone both negative and positive memories in American history , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
