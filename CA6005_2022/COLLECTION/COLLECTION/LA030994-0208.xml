   <TEXT> On cold winter days , the blue-gray haze that hangs over this mountain town is sometimes so thick you can taste it . It wafts up from the chimneys of residents who , in the best pioneer tradition , heat their homes with wood they cut themselves . This is smog season in the Sierra_Nevada , a time when the romantic ideal of a blazing hearth gives_way to the reality of burning eyes , respiratory illness and even premature death from wood smoke pollution . Wood fires -- long a cheap source of heat -- are increasingly under challenge in Northern California as government_agencies begin to regulate when people can light fires and what kind of wood stoves they can use . In this working-class hamlet 75 miles northwest of Lake Tahoe , the issue of smoke pollution has split the community , pitting residents who fear for their health against neighbors who insist on their God-given right to burn . Banning barbecue lighter fluid in Los Angeles is one thing . But prohibiting wood fires in the mountains is another . &quot; It would be like taking a person ' s gun away , &quot; said Quincy air_pollution control specialist George Ozanich . For some mountain inhabitants , wood stove heaters are a matter of survival . Many depend_on wood as their sole source of warmth in regions where natural_gas is unavailable , conversion to propane is costly and electric heating would be more expensive than the rent . But for others , wood smoke is a source of discomfort and disease that can force them to stay indoors for days . &quot; I don ' t go_out of my house unless I have to , &quot; said Janet Glover , a 52-year-old Quincy native who blames her emphysema and asthma in part on a lifetime of breathing wood smoke . &quot; If I open the door , it hits me . I feel_like I ' m imprisoned in my own home. &quot; Wood smoke pollution , largely a winter phenomenon in Western states , has plagued mountain dwellers for decades , mirroring the summer smog of Los Angeles . In small mountain valleys on cold , calm days , smoke from wood fires is trapped by inversion layers that are sometimes just 50 to 100 feet above ground_level . Without wind or stormy weather , the smoke can hang like a thick fog for days at a time between October and March . In California , the problem is greatest in such mountain communities as Quincy , Mammoth Lakes and Truckee , which are nestled in valleys in the Sierra_Nevada . But wood burning is also a major source of airborne particles in larger air basins such_as the San Francisco Bay Area , the San Joaquin Valley , northern Sonoma County and the lower Salinas Valley . In downtown San Jose , as much as 40 % of particle pollution on a winter day can come from wood smoke . Scientists say they are only now beginning to understand the dangers of inhaling the tiny particles in wood smoke , which can become lodged deep in the lungs . Some say it is an underrated health threat that could be as dangerous as breathing secondhand tobacco smoke . Recent studies show that children regularly exposed to wood smoke suffer diminished lung function . And some research suggests that even at levels deemed safe by the federal_government , prolonged exposure to wood smoke particles can be fatal , especially for elderly people who already have respiratory problems . No one can say for_sure how many people die each year from breathing wood smoke . But some researchers are coming_to the conclusion that particle pollution is more hazardous than ozone pollution , which is one of the major components of smog in Los Angeles . One study estimated that 60 # 000 people die annually from inhaling airborne particles that come from wood smoke and other sources , including road dust , diesel exhaust and emissions from manufacturing , mining and construction . &quot; The studies that have been done suggest to me that what we have is a very much underappreciated health hazard , &quot; said Dr. Michael J . Lipsett , a public health physician with Cal-EPA . Mary Rozenberg , a onetime concert cellist who suffers from lupus , lives in Los Altos , about 10 miles northwest of San Jose . She said she is forced to flee her home each winter for the cleaner air of the North Coast because wood smoke pollution in her neighborhood makes her so sick . With $ 20 # 000 of_her_own money , she has formed an advocacy group called Burning Issues to fight the use of wood as fuel , which she believes should be outlawed everywhere in California . &quot; This stuff is really nasty and people are treating it as if it is not , &quot; Rozenberg said . &quot; The victims are elderly , they are not mobile , they don ' t have enough money to move , and these dangerous levels of pollutants are entering their homes. &quot; But mountain dwellers are as attached_to their wood stoves as Southland residents are to their cars . And few are able to afford the new generation of fancy stoves that come_with catalytic_converters as standard equipment . In Quincy , going_into the forest to collect firewood is a time-honored ritual , usually involving a pickup , a chain_saw and a six-pack of beer . A permit to cut wood in the National Forest costs only $ 5 , and some people store as much as two years ' worth of wood so they can weather any cold_spell . Around Quincy , winter temperatures can dip well below freezing . Virginia Bresciani , who moved here 70 years ago at the age of 3 , has kept warm with wood all her life . She is a staunch defender of burning wood because it is the only economical way to heat the house in winter -- and she thinks people who don ' t like it should try breathing smog in Los Angeles 12 months a year . She blames the smoke problem on people who don ' t know how to burn properly -- they use wood that is not dry enough and damp the fire down so low it does not get sufficient air . &quot; We ' ve used wood stoves since I was a toddler and we never had a problem , &quot; she said . &quot; If the smoke bothers them this much , they shouldn ' t live up here. &quot; A cattle rancher and insurance_agent , she opposes any restrictions on burning , saying : &quot; We ' ve got too_much government intervention right now . If you had to listen to the government every day you ' d never get anything done. &quot; She dismissed those who worry about the health hazards of wood smoke , saying , &quot; People look_for something to holler about. &quot; Wood smoke opponents began focusing_on the problem in the late 1980s , when pollution was heightened by the same climatic conditions that produced California ' s six-year drought . But federal , state and local agencies have been slow to regulate the Stone_Age technology of wood fires . The federal Environmental Protection Agency requires that all new wood stove heaters meet specific emission standards , which can cut particle pollution by 90 % . But the agency does not require replacement of the older stoves , which can keep_on polluting for decades . The EPA is also more_than three years behind schedule in evaluating whether its safety threshold is adequate for airborne particles 10 microns or smaller -- specks so small that more_than 10 # 000 of them could fit on the dot over this i . Last fall , the American Lung Assn . sued the EPA in a bid to force the agency to update its standard of 150 micrograms per cubic_meter in a 24-hour period . &quot; The evidence is growing that particulate pollution can kill , &quot; said association President Alfred Munzer . California , meanwhile , has set a safety standard for particle pollution three times as strict as the EPA threshold , but it has been left up_to local agencies to decide how to reduce wood smoke . &quot; Let ' s face it , &quot; said George Erdman , an air_pollution specialist with the Northern Sonoma County Air_Pollution Control District . &quot; Air_pollution control issues really come_down to the individual : The way you heat your home , the way you commute , the way you use cosmetics , the way you light your barbecue. &quot; Places such_as Quincy , Truckee , Mammoth Lakes , Cloverdale and Petaluma have moved to curb pollution by requiring that any new wood-burning stove meet EPA standards . Mammoth Lakes , the most aggressive California town in tackling wood smoke , goes even further , prohibiting burning on winter days when conditions are worst . In the San Francisco Bay Area and the San Joaquin Valley , air quality districts have adopted voluntary programs asking citizens not to burn when the air quality is bad . But these measures fall_short_of what some cities outside California are doing . Reno , for example , not only prohibits burning on bad days but also has banned the installation of any wood-burning appliance -- including EPA-approved stoves -- in the most polluted parts of the city . Debate over wood smoke pollution arose in Quincy when school district employee Joyce Scroggs made_it an issue in her successful 1989 campaign for Plumas County supervisor . People from the flatlands were moving to Quincy for its clean mountain air and found instead that they were choking on smoke . With the steadily growing population , even some longtime residents were annoyed by the thick blanket of smoke hanging over their valley on some winter days . &quot; The history of living in these rural_areas is that everyone loves the smell of wood smoke and it ' s part of the ambience , &quot; Scroggs said . &quot; But it became clear it was a real pollution problem. &quot; Local air monitoring showed that at its worst , Quincy ' s particle pollution was more_than double the federal standard and seven times higher than the state standard , she said . Even without scientific studies , it was obvious to health experts in Quincy that some residents were suffering a variety of illnesses from wood smoke , including bronchitis , asthma and sinusitis . But the options were limited . At least two-thirds of Quincy ' s 5 # 000 inhabitants depend_on wood stoves for their heat . &quot; You can ' t tell people you can ' t burn a wood stove , &quot; Scroggs said . And requiring them to spend $ 2 # 000 or so to install new stoves also was out_of_the_question . In the end , Quincy decided to require installation of clean-burning stoves when homes are sold -- a policy that will have little direct effect on most residents and could take decades to clear the air . The town also has tried to limit open burning of leaves and debris to certain times_of_year , but with mixed results . Many old-timers resent the idea of government telling them when they can burn . For Scroggs , even such modest steps proved too controversial . She lost her bid for reelection last year , she said , in part because of her efforts to reduce wood smoke pollution . Even with the new rules , nurse practitioner Kathleen Price said patients with respiratory problems start filling her office as soon as the weather turns cold and the fires start_up . &quot; You can set your clock by it , &quot; she said . &quot; We see a lot of people who are just miserable all winter. &quot; John Crouch , a Sacramento spokesman for wood stove manufacturers , encourages towns to adopt regulations requiring cleaner-burning stoves . Tougher rules would mean more sales for the companies he represents -- and could stave_off burning bans sought by activists such_as Mary Rozenberg . When the issue has come_up in some communities , Crouch has been known to set_up an EPA-certified stove outside the town_hall to demonstrate how little visible pollution it produces . Smoke is merely unburned fuel , he notes , and with the new stoves , most of it is trapped and burned , increasing fuel efficiency as well as reducing pollution . &quot; There are thousands of tons of wood smoke emitted in this state every day that don ' t need to be , &quot; he says . But Rozenberg argues that even the cleanest-burning stoves are far more polluting than natural_gas or propane . She points_out that after the London smog of 1952 killed 4 # 000 people , Great Britain banned the burning of solid fuels in metropolitan areas and subsidized conversion to cleaner energy . This , she said , is something the United States could do too . She cites the case of Rosemary Fox , a Bay Area widow in her mid-60s and Burning Issues member whose ill_health was made worse by her neighbor ' s wood fires . Her doctor concluded that her exposure to smoke particles was life threatening , and Fox desperately sought intervention from lawmakers and government officials without success . Shortly before her death from heart_disease last year , Fox pleaded for help in a letter to then-EPA Administrator William Reilly : &quot; All those long hours of gasping for oxygen with increasing chest_pains , coughing and wheezing from particulate matter , and persistent bleeding from the nose . . . have taken a toll on my health and ruined my ability to enjoy my retirement years. &quot; Rozenberg said wood smoke particles are so fine that they can remain in the air for three weeks and travel 700 miles . Scientists have found that many constituents of tobacco smoke are also produced by burning wood ; some are known to cause cancer , such_as formaldehyde and benzopyrene . &quot; If you knew how dangerous wood smoke is , would you want to expose yourself or your children ? &quot; she asked . &quot; In this state , this Wild_West attitude is insane. &quot; Stove Standards In addition to requiring that newly installed wood stoves meet EPA standards , these communities have adopted other measures to curb their wood-smoke pollution . * Mammoth Lakes : Fires prohibited on days when high levels of wood-smoke pollution are expected . Any wood stove or fireplace that does not meet EPA standards must be removed or replaced when a home is sold . New homes limited to one EPA-approved wood-burning appliance . * Quincy : Wood stoves that do not meet EPA standards must be removed when a home is sold . * Lake Tahoe : Wood stoves that fail EPA standards must be removed when a home is sold . New multiunit projects are restricted to one wood-burning appliance per building . * Truckee : Housing developers can be required to pay a fee or remove high-polluting wood stoves elsewhere in town to offset the effect of wood burning . * Cloverdale : Construction of any wood-burning masonry fireplace is prohibited . Note : Stoves certified by the EPA as clean burning emit no more_than 7.5 grams of particulate matter an hour . This can reduce emissions as much as 90 % over wood stoves and fireplaces manufactured before 1988 .</TEXT>
