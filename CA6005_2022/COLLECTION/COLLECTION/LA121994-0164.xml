   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG : ISOLATIONIST TV : VIEWERS PAY THE PRICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s curious the things that pique your interest when you have a videotape universe at your fingertips . Here , for example , is a video that former NBC foreign correspondent Arthur Kent mailed a short time ago . Available only in video stores , his 30-minute documentary is titled &quot; Return to Afghanistan. &quot; Long a preferred invasion route for outsiders , Afghanistan is where violent history plays_out again and again . Network newscasts paid relatively close attention from time to time when occupation forces from the former Soviet_Union and U.S.-backed guerrillas battled it out there during the 1980s . But when the battered Soviets withdrew from the land they and their Afghan allies had ravaged , &quot; the world turned_away , distracted by other wars and disasters , &quot; Kent says from a serene village that was aflame with war when he last visited in 1986 . Come_to think_of it , when did you last see anything about Afghanistan on ABC , CBS or NBC ? Did the Afghans topple into China ? Slashed budgets and narrowed ambitions have gripped the once-nightly network news divisions in a bear_hug of provincialism . When it comes_to international news , these days it ' s hard getting them to venture beyond Trafalgar Square . So are the Kents of TV journalism a future lane of the information superhighway ? One that will lead directly to the video store for the only electronic source of news ( with the exception of occasional pieces on CNN and &quot; The MacNeil / Lehrer NewsHour &quot; ) about hot spots and even lukewarm ones that have since vanished from regular newscasts like blips from a radar screen ? Will privately bankrolled independents like the Canadian Kent , working via the home-video market , be the only alternative for in-depth global perspective on TV as the networks largely preoccupy themselves with all_the news that ' s fit to sensationalize and reduce to headlines ? And putting aside Kent ' s highly worthy documentary for the moment , what is this ? The face , the voice . Like a trusted ghost of Yule past , it ' s Wooly Walter filling the screen in &quot; The Cronkite Report , &quot; Wednesday ' s 60-minute documentary on the Discovery Channel exploring &quot; Christianity Reborn : Prayer and Politics. &quot; Cronkite has worked_on TV sporadically since ending his long reign as the Mt . Rushmore of CBS News . He has been doing these quarterly programs for The Discovery Channel since May , 1993 , and getting_even this small whiff of him turns you into an instant nostalgianik . Beyond that , however , is the deep imprint of fairness and civility he puts_on this hour as narrator and reporter , just as Kent does on his documentary . The program is somehow meticulously balanced without being wimpy , as Cronkite visits numerous venues of Christianity , from the user-friendly WillowCreek Community Church -- a vast edifice of soft-sell evangelism -- to the First Iconium Baptist_Church , where hard-preaching Rev . Tim McDonald rails against the &quot; family values &quot; of &quot; right-wing religious folk. &quot; * No agenda is favored here , and even when Cronkite gathers some of these polar-opposite Christians around a table for a brief chat , the debate is calm and free_of the emotional &quot; Crossfire &quot; harangue that we ' ve come_to expect from such televised disagreements about religion . &quot; Christianity , &quot; Cronkite says early in the program , &quot; is thriving and as prosperous as it ' s ever been in the United States. &quot; He adds that &quot; religion is alive and well in America. &quot; If he ' s right on both counts , then shame on mainstream TV for virtually ignoring Christianity and just about all religion outside of Sunday mornings , except for the anti-abortion screamers and hard-right political ideologues who regularly capture the attention of newscasts . And shame on mainstream TV news for playing the role of isolationist and doing so little to widen its landscape beyond the United States . Like &quot; Christianity Reborn , &quot; Kent ' s documentary is also about renewal , at least in the rebuilding community that he initially revisits , a now-quiet village just 50 miles from bloody civil strife still raging in the Afghan capital of Kabul -- a lingering torture , featuring competing warlords , that probably few Americans are aware of . Kent juxtaposes his footage from 1986 with his latest pictures . He finds familiar faces , including a man who embodies the spirit of the surviving guerrillas who resisted the Soviets . &quot; The time you took our picture after the jets bombed us , &quot; the man says through an interpreter , &quot; we came_back to rebuild . And then they bombed us again . Again we went_to the mountains and returned , only to have our houses bombed again. &quot; No quitter , the man recalls this standing_in front of his new house . In Kabul , though , death and suffering cover the city like a shroud . Kent revisits the now-barren killing fields where a thriving bazaar once stood . And &quot; the avenue with style &quot; that he shot in 1986 is now an unrecognizable ruin . At a Kabul hospital , foreign_aid workers in a crowded operating_room face the same dangers as their patients , evidenced by the rocket attack that forces them into a basement shelter . The scenes recall the Bosnia-Herzogovina massacres on today ' s slender network news agenda . &quot; The fighting is just for power , &quot; Kent is told by a gritty and determined young_man who is head of his family despite being only 19 . His body a stump , he has lost his legs in the explosion of a mine left behind by the departed Soviets . Members of his family help him into his wheelchair . * &quot; Christianity Reborn : Prayer and Politics &quot; airs at 10 p.m. Wednesday on the Discovery Channel .</TEXT>
