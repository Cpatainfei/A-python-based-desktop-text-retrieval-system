   <HEADLINE> IS THIS A FAIR TRADE ? ; MARKET MAKERS DRAW CRITICISM , LAWSUITS FOR IGNORING CUSTOMER ORDERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One day in late June , options trader Steven I . Malitz was poised to buy 1 # 200 shares of American Colloid stock at $ 13 a share -- a quarter of a point more_than any of the Nasdaq-listed stock ' s market makers were offering to pay . Small investors certainly would have done better to sell to Malitz at his price . But they never got the chance . Instead , market makers ignored Malitz ' s order -- &quot; traded through &quot; it , in market parlance -- and continued to sell at $ 12.75 , a price better for themselves and worse for their customers . After three minutes , as a reporter watched , Malitz ' s order automatically expired -- unfilled . A cornerstone of the nation ' s securities laws is the &quot; best execution &quot; rule , meant to guarantee that brokerage customers get_the_best price available when they put_in orders to buy or sell stock . But much of the time on Nasdaq they don ' t . &quot; I get traded through all_the time , &quot; says Malitz , a veteran floor trader at the Chicago Board Options Exchange . Throughout the day , by telephone from his trading_post , Malitz buys and sells Nasdaq shares to limit the risks of his dealings in options on Nasdaq stocks . The National Assn . of Securities Dealers , which owns and operates Nasdaq -- the nation ' s busiest stock_market -- says the market could not operate without trading through . The NASD insists it carefully balances the interests of both market makers and its customers . Still , in one 15-minute span on the raucous floor of the Chicago options exchange that day , a reporter witnessed two other apparent instances of Malitz ' s better-priced offers being traded through by Nasdaq market makers . Longtime investors and securities professionals say that on any given day , thousands of better-priced orders never get executed . Another Chicago trader , Mark Shaprow , says he quit trading options on Nasdaq stocks out of frustration with getting traded through . Now he deals only in options on IBM , a stock_listed on the New York Stock_Exchange , where trading through is banned . &quot; We ' re professionals and we see it happen , &quot; says Shaprow . &quot; Then we think_about the people who aren ' t professionals . They get cheated the same way , and they don ' t even know it. &quot; Trading through is just one of the ways the vast Nasdaq trading system produces big profits for market makers at the expense of millions of investors , small retail customers and professionals alike . The practice , long banned on most exchanges , helps maintain Nasdaq ' s wide &quot; spreads , &quot; the gap between the price at which market makers offer to buy from sellers and the price at which they will sell to buyers . By ignoring better-priced offers from the public that are &quot; inside the spread &quot; -- offers either to sell shares for less than the market maker is demanding or buy them for more -- the firms protect their own interests while slighting those of their customers . The Justice_Department said this week that its antitrust division has launched an investigation into allegations that market makers , rather than competing , work together to keep spreads wide and increase their profits . The NASD and many large market makers insist the allegations are baseless . The Securities and Exchange Commission , too , is beginning to apply strong pressure on Nasdaq to address some parts of the problem . But many believe that the proposed reforms , though they have provoked strong complaints from the market makers , fall_short . Richard G . Ketchum , the NASD ' s chief operating officer , says trading through is justifiable because of the nature of the over-the-counter market . If it were banned , he says , some market makers who deal in Nasdaq stocks might lose money and decide to leave the business . The NASD says competition between market makers is at the core of Nasdaq ' s structure , leading to better prices for customers . There are no signs that the profits of Nasdaq market makers are precarious . Indeed , with Nasdaq ' s steady growth , the number of firms making markets in its stocks has risen . There are now 510 , up 21 % from 1990 . They include the big , well-known , Wall_Street investment houses , such_as Merrill Lynch , PaineWebber and Morgan Stanley , as well as lesser-known firms that do little besides make markets in Nasdaq stocks , such_as Troster Singer Corp . and Herzog , Heine , Geduld Inc. The NASD says it has no data on its member firms ' profits from market making . But using the NASD ' s own figures -- average daily volume of 299 million shares multiplied by an average spread of 34.3 cents -- indicates that the market makers ' revenue each day from spreads comes_to $ 102.6 million , or more_than $ 26 billion a year . ( They also make additional trading profits , or losses , on the stocks they hold_in their own inventory. ) At the heart of trading through is something called a &quot; limit order. &quot; On Nasdaq , as on the New York and other stock_exchanges , customers can place limit orders to buy or sell stock at a specified price , as opposed to &quot; market_orders &quot; to buy or sell at the current market_price . But the way limit orders are handled is dramatically different on the NYSE or American_Stock_Exchange than on Nasdaq . On Nasdaq , market makers may continue to trade at their quoted bid and asked prices while limit orders sit unfilled . Despite a recent rule change , small investors who put_in limit orders are most affected : Their limit orders often have to wait until the market_price happens to hit the price they specified . This occurs in part because Nasdaq has set_up no centralized mechanism for handling limit orders . Not only are there multiple market makers for each stock , but on Nasdaq , limit orders may go_into one of many different computer trading systems without appearing on the others . Some of the systems are owned by the NASD , while others are operated by independent companies such_as Reuters or Los Angeles-based Jefferies &amp; Co . Still others are in-house systems for giant brokerage_firms such_as Merrill and PaineWebber that execute most of their customers ' Nasdaq stock orders themselves . So orders sitting in one computer_system are likely never to be seen by market participants not using that system . And even those who use a particular system might not see an order ; the typical trader at a market-making firm may be responsible_for watching 40 or 50 stocks at a time . As a result , unlike on the NYSE , there is no true &quot; price discovery &quot; on Nasdaq : The quoted market_prices do not reflect the prices at which all market participants at any given moment are willing to buy or sell . &quot; My frank opinion after 37 years in this business is that I ' d rather trade on the New York Stock_Exchange , for one basic reason : You really do have ' price discovery , ' &quot; says Benjamin L . Lubin , a former member of the NASD ' s board of governors and president of Securities Industry Management Corp. , a Connecticut consulting_firm . Indeed , the way trading works_on the NYSE is a sharp contrast to the fragmented Nasdaq system . On the NYSE , in most cases , customers trade with other customers . A &quot; specialist &quot; on the floor is the exchange ' s only market maker for each stock . All customer limit orders are recorded in one centralized list , the specialist ' s &quot; book. &quot; Mostly , the specialist matches up customer orders ( for a commission ) and generally buys and sells stock for his own account only when there is a shortage of public buyers or sellers . There is no trading through on NYSE or the Amex ; their rules require that if an investor is offering a better price than the market maker , that order must be filled before the specialist is allowed to trade for his own account at the same or a worse price . Assume , for example , that the specialist in Exxon stock is offering to buy shares at $ 60 and sell at $ 60.125. If an investor comes_along who is willing to sell the stock at $ 60 , the investor ' s order will be filled before the specialist is allowed to sell anyone stock at $ 60.125. The specialist ' s only revenue from the transaction is his commission . Ketchum , the NASD ' s chief operating officer , says having no central limit-order book is basic to the way Nasdaq operates . &quot; Market makers handle their own limit orders and provide the quality of execution they want to , &quot; he says . Without the freedom to trade through , he says , market makers would leave the business , drying_up liquidity and harming the Nasdaq market : &quot; The net result is you ' re going to eliminate market making as you know it. &quot; The extent of trading through on Nasdaq has so irked Malitz and a group of fellow options traders in Chicago that several filed a federal class-action lawsuit in May . Their suit accuses major Nasdaq market makers of deliberately trading through better offers , conspiring to fix prices , colluding to maintain -- even widen -- spreads and restraining competition by punishing fellow market makers who break the spreads . The Justice_Department investigation covers many of the same alleged abuses . The market makers deny the allegations . NASD officials say they are unaware of the options traders ' complaints and have no comment on this and other class-action lawsuits . The SEC , meanwhile , says it is concerned about trading through on Nasdaq . &quot; I don ' t think we ' re resigned to any pricing inefficiency , &quot; says Brandon Becker , director of the SEC ' s division of market regulation . But Becker says the agency has no immediate plans to crack_down on the practice . Yet options traders are not the only people complaining . In a letter last month to the SEC , Jeffrey P . Ricker -- a San Francisco-based consultant to institutional investors and an individual investor himself -- recounted what happened last year when he put_in a limit order to sell shares of a Nasdaq stock . &quot; While I was unsuccessfully trying to sell 1 # 500 shares of MTC Electronics at $ 19 a share , other hapless investors were buying_at 19 1 / 4 , &quot; he wrote . &quot; They were cheated , and I was cheated. &quot; * Series Reprints : A compilation of this six-part series on Nasdaq will be available from Times on Demand upon completion of the series ' publication next week .

Nasdaq ' s Dramatic Growth Nasdaq emerged this year as the nation ' s busiest stock_market , with a larger daily volume of shares traded than the New York Stock_Exchange . The number of companies listed on Nasdaq has shot_up , as has the number of dealers making markets in Nasdaq stocks . SHARE VOLUME ( In billions ) : ' 94 * : 49.4 DOLLAR_VOLUME ( In billions ) : ' 94 * : $ 979.6 COMPANIES LISTED ( In thousands ) : ' 94 * : 4.849 DEALERS ' 94 * : 510 Source : National Assn . of Securities Dealers NASD Chief Expresses Support Joseph R . Hardiman , president of the National Assn . of Securities Dealers , sent a memo Thursday to Nasdaq market makers expressing confidence that the Justice_Department will conclude that allegations of price fixing and other misconduct in the market are baseless . &quot; As you well know , the Nasdaq stock_market is stringently overseen by both the ( Securities and Exchange Commission ) and the NASD , and neither we nor the SEC have ever found anti-competitive practices to exist in our market , &quot; Hardiman wrote . The Justice_Department said this week that its antitrust division is investigating Nasdaq trading practices . A Glossary of Market Terms * Bid : The posted price at which a market maker is willing to buy a stock . * Asked : The posted price at which a market maker is willing to sell a stock . * Spread : The gap between the bid and asked prices . This is essentially the market maker ' s profit_margin for acting_as a dealer in the stock . Market makers buy from investors at the bid and sell at the higher , asked price . * Limit order : An order to buy or sell a stock at a specified price . * Market_order : An order to buy or sell a stock at the current market_price . * Market makers : Firms that put_up their own capital to &quot; make a market &quot; in particular Nasdaq stocks , acting_as dealers by continuously posting prices for the stocks on Nasdaq ' s computer and standing ready to buy or sell . Unlike the New York Stock_Exchange , where a single &quot; specialist &quot; is the sole market maker for each stock , each Nasdaq stock has multiple market makers . * Trading ahead : Also known as front-running , the practice of a market maker buying or selling for the firm ' s profit ahead of an order from the firm ' s own customer . * Trading through : Practice of market makers continuing to trade with the investing public at their quoted bid or asked prices , ignoring offers that are better for customers . The customer who puts_in the better-priced order often does not get_it filled . Other investors never know about these pending orders and thereby miss out on opportunities to buy stock at less than the quoted asking_price or to sell at more_than the quoted bid_price . About This Series The electronic Nasdaq market has grown_into the nation ' s busiest marketplace for buying and selling stocks , with higher trading volume than the better-known New York Stock_Exchange .
