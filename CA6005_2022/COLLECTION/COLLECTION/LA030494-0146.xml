   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; TURBULENT MARKETS SEEN MASKING HEALTHY ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For millions of Americans , something scary is happening . For three years , they have poured record amounts of their savings into stock and bond mutual_funds , in_effect betting_on a healthy U.S economy . But now that the economy is finally rolling along , they are seeing sudden and serious declines in the value of the investments they have made_for retirement , college tuition and other long-term goals . At the same time , rising interest_rates have made mortgages more expensive , cutting_into one of the great benefits for U.S. homeowners and buyers . What is going_on ? Markets in part are responding to fears that things are too good , analysts say . The fear is that economic_growth will surge at such a pace that it brings_back the corrosive inflation of the 1970s . But there are new and different forces at_work . High-rolling global speculators , who also have pumped vast amounts_of_money into stocks and bonds worldwide over the past year , have been forced by sudden turns_in the markets to stampede for the exits . The situation may look perilous , but many financial and economic_experts say the markets ' reaction in recent weeks is overblown and does not threaten the healthy long-term outlook for the economy , inflation and investments . They advise ordinary investors and mortgage holders to keep_an_eye_on the underlying strength of the U.S. economy and not be diverted by short-term swings . &quot; There ' s way too_much concern , &quot; says Charles Clough , chief investment strategist for the giant brokerage Merrill Lynch . &quot; The story remains that U.S. industry is increasingly efficient and competitive worldwide. &quot; Federal_Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said as much last month when he surprised Wall_Street by raising short-term interest_rates slightly , the first official hike in five years . Greenspan , who described the U.S. economy as being in its best shape in 30 years , made clear that his intention was to keep a moderating hand on the expansion while countering speculative excesses -- two goals that Wall_Street normally would cheer . But the Fed ' s action has had dramatic unintended consequences , sending mortgage rates surging and stock prices tumbling worldwide . One reason for those consequences was the extent of speculation in global markets , where mega-investors like London-based George Soros have placed massive amounts of borrowed capital in international securities and currency markets . These so-called &quot; hedge_funds &quot; made huge bets early this year in Europe and Japan . But their investments , more_than $ 300 billion by some estimates , have gone sour as a result of Greenspan ' s action to raise interest_rates and defuse the speculative threat . This selloff has been a major cause of the market gyrations and led to fears that the U.S. economy and financial markets are now on the brink of a long decline , reminiscent_of the crash of 1987 and the bear_market of 1973 . But most financial experts say the current environment is not at all like those earlier times . On the contrary , the U.S. economy has turned the corner from recovery to expansion . Economists now predict growth of 3.6 % this year , or an additional $ 216 billion worth of economic activity . California may_not join fully in such good times until early next year , although a better national economy could quicken the pace here . That kind of economic_growth creates jobs . In the latest surveys , companies throughout the economy say they plan to hire more people in the second quarter of 1994 . Corporate profits are rising , especially for companies that supply machinery and services to industry overseas , such_as Caterpillar Inc. and General Electric . This is the basis for sustained economic_growth that will produce rising profits and ultimately a return of rising stock prices . Meanwhile , increased inflation is not seen as a real threat because productivity -- output per hour of labor or dollar of investment -- is rising more_than it has in years . It is increasing across the board , in both manufacturing and service_industries . And that means low or decreasing inflation . At the same time , the economies of Europe and Asia are adjusting to the post-Cold War period , as the U.S. economy has been doing since 1990 . Though the effort to change Japan ' s has led to a very public dispute , it is not likely to upset an increasingly interdependent and growing world economy , most economists agree . The contrast with earlier periods of economic change and market swings is dramatic . In 1973 , the start of a major market downturn saw a quadrupling in the price of oil and the instability of Watergate in the U.S._government . In 1980 , then Federal_Reserve Chairman Paul A . Volcker was forced to bail_out U.S. and international banks that had become overextended in the inflation-driven speculations in silver , oil and other commodities . He also had to take stern action , and trigger a recession , to break the back of double-digit inflation . Greenspan , who acted quickly to curb the market slide in 1987 , may have made a timely move again . He stepped_in to curb the threat of inflation and speculation before the system was pushed to the brink . Still , even the fact that the nest_eggs of the average American investor could be threatened by excesses of esoteric financial concepts like &quot; interest_rate swaps &quot; and &quot; currency futures &quot; will infuriate and puzzle most people . If such things are a threat , why are they allowed at all ? The answer is that hedge_funds and other financial exotica are part of a new and still-emerging global financial system in which more_than $ 1 trillion of securities , currencies and all manner of financial instruments are traded every day , with many benefits . &quot; The trading is maximizing the efficiency of capital movements , bringing_together money that is available in one spot but required in another , &quot; says Dennis Weatherstone , chairman of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. , one of the world ' s leading_banks and a leader in these markets . For example , he notes that such markets make loans and other capital much more available for building factories and power_plants in countries like Mexico , China and Indonesia -- developments that bring profits and jobs to American companies . In fact , these markets are a reflection of how American money has become so tightly linked to other countries and economies around the world . And this is why average mutual_fund holders in the United States find their savings affected by hedge_fund investments gone awry . There are dangers in this system and the consequence of bad investment decisions could mean the failure of a developing country ' s loan or the bankruptcy of a speculative fund . But most experts accept such risks for the benefits that a global market brings , so_long as the bankruptcies don ' t get too_large and their consequences spread too far . * RELATED STORIES : D1 , D2</TEXT>
