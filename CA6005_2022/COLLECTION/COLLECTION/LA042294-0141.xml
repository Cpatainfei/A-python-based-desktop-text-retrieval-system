   <HEADLINE> HOUSE APPROVES CRIME BILL , 285-141 ; CONGRESS : $ 28-BILLION MEASURE WOULD ADD MORE POLICE , BUILD MORE PRISONS , EXPAND DEATH_PENALTY . THE VOTE SENDS THE LEGISLATION TO BE RECONCILED WITH SENATE VERSION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a major step toward final passage of anti-crime legislation , the House on Thursday overwhelmingly approved the most expensive and far-reaching crime bill ever considered by Congress . The $ 28-billion measure , which has President Clinton ' s blessing , is designed to put more police on the street , build more prisons , get_tough on violent offenders , spend billions for crime-prevention programs and expand the federal death_penalty to 66 new offenses , although it also would open the door to more appeals of death sentences . Adopted on a 285-141 roll_call , the measure will now be sent to a Senate-House conference committee , which must work_out the differences between it and a crime bill approved in November by the Senate . Rep . Jack Brooks ( D-Tex. ) , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and floor manager of the bill , called the House action a major victory . &quot; This is a breakthrough to achieve a balance between hard-nosed punishment and forward-looking prevention , &quot; he said . While the future of specific provisions is uncertain -- and the funding is subject_to additional appropriation votes -- the House action virtually guarantees that sweeping crime legislation will be approved by Congress this year . In large part , the outcome has been driven by a public outcry over crime and the perception -- accurate or not -- that it is rampant in the streets of the United States . Since last fall , Clinton has pledged to work for passage of a crime bill , and even though members of Congress differ sharply over crime-fighting philosophy , opponents of the bill -- mostly Republicans -- were loath to oppose it for fear of disappointing constituents in an election year . Clinton and the Democrats are expected to reap large political benefits if the final bill is passed -- especially if it fulfills Clinton ' s pledge to put 100 # 000 more police_officers on the streets and includes multibillion-dollar crime-prevention programs . That the Democrats would lead the charge on anti-crime legislation heavy on punishment marks a sizable political turnabout . Some months ago , they began a serious effort to adopt for themselves an issue that has long been considered the province of the GOP . &quot; Politically , I think Democrats have recaptured the crime issue , &quot; said Rep . Charles E . Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , a major architect of the bill . &quot; For years , Republicans attacked Democrats as soft and mushy-headed on crime . That won ' t work anymore. &quot; But Republican leaders complained that the bill is too soft_on career criminals and undercuts the death_penalty by allowing defendants in capital cases to allege racial bias in the imposition of death sentences . Even so , 65 GOP lawmakers joined with 219 Democrats and one independent to adopt the measure ; 107 Republicans and 34 Democrats voted against it . The President , who stayed out of the Senate ' s crime-bill debate , intervened in the House , endorsing a popular provision -- known as &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; -- that would require life imprisonment without parole for repeat offenders who commit violent crimes . Congressional leaders said the President would now take the offensive on behalf of an assault-weapons ban , which was approved by the Senate but excluded from the House measure . Speaker Thomas S . Foley has promised that the House will consider the issue in a separate bill to be brought_to the floor within the next few weeks . GOP leaders also were expected to oppose that measure , which would prohibit the possession , sale or future manufacture of assault weapons . The Senate-House conference , scheduled to start early in May , is expected to be hard-fought but not particularly prolonged . Key lawmakers said they hoped to get a bill on the President ' s desk by the end of next month , before members of Congress leave on a Memorial_Day recess . The committee was expected to go_along with the Senate provision that would provide_for 100 # 000 more police_officers at a cost of $ 9 billion . The House version called_for only 50 # 000 officers at a cost of $ 5.3 billion . Major differences were anticipated , however , on whether to retain the Senate-passed assault-weapons ban and on how to allocate the remainder of the funds . The House , for example , authorized a total of $ 13.5 billion for states to build and operate prisons , more_than double the $ 6.5 billion voted by the Senate for prisons and alternatives such_as &quot; boot camps &quot; for youthful offenders . In another major difference , the House bill includes an unprecedented $ 8 billion for a variety of crime-prevention programs , including $ 2 billion in grants to local_governments in high-crime areas and $ 525 million for job training . Rep . John Conyers Jr . ( D-Mich. ) , who will be one of the House conferees in the negotiating session with the Senate , said : &quot; There must be a better balance than exists in the Senate crime bill between federal spending for incarceration and federal spending for prevention of crime. &quot; Conyers also criticized some of the get-tough provisions in the measure , saying : &quot; Bumper-sticker slogans like ' Three strikes , you ' re out ' make great copy but will only overload an already overburdened criminal-justice system and further reduce a judge ' s discretion. &quot; There will also be pressure to allocate funds for prison construction because of the repeated emphasis during the weeklong House debate on the need to keep violent criminals behind bars . Marc Klaas , father of slain 12-year-old Polly Klaas of Petaluma , for example , urged Congress to authorize the $ 13.5 billion included in the House bill for the construction and operation of prisons . This provision would earmark 25 % of the money to states that increase the prison time served by repeated violent offenders . &quot; Every day one of these guys is away is a day he can ' t commit a crime against an innocent citizen , &quot; Klaas said at a press_conference . &quot; This is the one law that could have made a difference in my daughter ' s case. &quot; It appeared likely , however , that the allocation for prisons would be closer to the lower Senate figure because of other demands on the available funds . Schumer , chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on crime , described the House bill as a &quot; centrist &quot; measure that responds to the public ' s demand to stop political squabbling and pass an effective crime bill . &quot; We tried to do things that work and not things that ring our bells or press our ideological buttons , &quot; he told reporters . &quot; This is one of the few times that Washington listened to what ' s going_on in the streets. &quot; Only 34 Democrats -- mostly liberals , but some conservatives -- voted against the bill . Twenty-four of the 38 members of the Congressional Black Caucus voted for passage despite the traditional opposition of its members to expansion of the death_penalty . That concern was counterbalanced by the provision allowing death-penalty appeals_to be based on statistical evidence of racial bias in such sentences . The 65 Republicans who broke_with their leadership included moderate GOP lawmakers . In California , for example , eight of the 22-member Republican delegation voted for the bill , along with 27 of the 30 Democrats from the state . The outcome indicated that a final version of the bill emerging from the conference committee would be approved easily in both chambers . The Senate legislation passed_by a 95-4 vote . The House also voted , 402 to 22 , to remove weight-training equipment from federal prisons on grounds that it would prevent prisoners from increasing their fighting abilities . The House also voted to bar prisoners from receiving Pell grants for college education by a vote of 312 to 116 . Rep . Bart Gordon ( D-Tenn. ) contended that the $ 36 million spent on 28 # 000 prisoners would be_better spent on students not behind bars . On a related issue , the House decided , 347 to 82 , to require federal prisoners who have not graduated from high_school to earn a general equivalency diploma before becoming eligible for early release . Exceptions could be made , however , by the director of the Bureau of Prisons . Crime Bill Comparisons Here are major provisions of the $ 28-billion crime bill passed_by the House , and comparisons with the Senate measure . The two versions must be reconciled by a conference committee : * Life imprisonment for three-time violent-crime and drug offenders . The Senate bill is similar , although the House measure has an early-out provision the Senate did not pass . * Expansion from two to nearly 70 the number of crimes eligible for the death_penalty , including drive-by killings and fatal carjackings . Drug kingpins could also face execution , even when no death is involved . The Senate bill adds about 50 death_penalty crimes . * Defendants facing the death_penalty would be allowed to use racial statistics on capital_punishment as evidence of discrimination . The Senate bill does not include this provision . * Authorization of $ 7 billion for crime prevention and $ 2 billion for rehabilitation , such_as drug treatment , in prisons . The Senate bill devotes far less money to such efforts . * Authorization of $ 3.45 billion for 50 # 000 more community police_officers . The Senate bill authorizes $ 8.9 billion for 100 # 000 such police_officers . * Unlike the Senate bill , the House measure contains no ban on assault weapons .
