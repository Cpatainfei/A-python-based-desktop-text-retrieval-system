   <HEADLINE> U.S. WANTS AIRLINE RULES EASED GLOBALLY ; TRANSPORTATION : REVISED REGULATIONS WOULD ALLOW CARRIERS TO ESTABLISH AN INTERNATIONAL HUB-AND-SPOKE SYSTEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the first major attempt to change international aviation policy since the late 1970s , the Clinton_Administration announced plans Tuesday to begin talks with nine European_nations in an effort to remove obstacles to development of a truly global air transport system . In addition , Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena announced an agreement between the United States , Canada and Australia that will ban smoking on flights operated by their airlines among the three countries . The aim of the talks , as outlined by Pena , is to allow commercial airlines to establish international &quot; hub-and-spoke &quot; systems much like those adopted by many U.S. carriers after the industry was deregulated . It would allow U.S. carriers to use these destinations as stopping points to other cities worldwide , a practice currently discouraged in some countries . Lifting current barriers would allow U.S. airlines to offer more competitive prices , fly to more cities and increase the frequency of flights , according to a report released on the policy aims . The Administration did not release the names of the nine countries but included are nations within and outside of the European Union , said Patrick Murphy , acting assistant secretary for aviation and international affairs . &quot; Taken together , the accords we seek with this group of European partners will provide important benefits for travelers , cities , airlines and their employees , both in the U.S. and in Europe , &quot; Pena said Tuesday in Chicago . Acknowledging that some countries might be hesitant to swiftly relax restrictions on U.S. air traffic , the policy statement allows_for transitional agreements that would ultimately result in completely open airline markets . It would also consider agreements that would eliminate restrictions in several exclusive areas , such_as air cargo or charter services . &quot; A lot of progress can be made incrementally , &quot; said Stephen Kaplan , general counsel for the Department_of_Transportation . Countries that refuse to participate in the effort , however , may face a less flexible United States . The report suggests limiting access to the U.S. market for those countries ' airlines and restricting the airlines ' commercial relations with the United States . The Administration also intends to encourage other countries to turn_over state-owned airlines to private owners . The policy statement also warns countries that protect their airlines from competitive pressures that they will be left_behind in the expanding global economy , depriving consumers of greater cost efficiency . The report cites intentions to make air trade agreements with other countries as well , including those in Asia , South_America and Central Europe . In addition , it says , the Administration wishes to further free up air trade with Canada and the United Kingdom . The smoking ban , which is part of Pena ' s goal of making all American public travel smoke-free , will affect nonstop_flights and will become effective in early March . Pena said that the agreement is part of a U.S.-supported effort by the International Civil Aviation Organization to ban smoking on international_flights by July 1 , 1996 . The ban applies to flights operated for paying passengers , not flights chartered by a person , company or organization .</TEXT>
