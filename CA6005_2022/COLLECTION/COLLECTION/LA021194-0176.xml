   <HEADLINE> ASIA ; JAPANESE PREMIER STUMBLES ON ROCKY POLITICAL LANDSCAPE ; HOSOKAWA ' S PUBLIC SUPPORT IS DOWN 37 % ON EVE OF SUMMIT WITH CLINTON . EVEN A REBOUND IN THE POLLS MIGHT NOT BRING HIM THE AUTHORITY HE NEEDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He is the &quot; war_criminal of the 7 % tax , &quot; one magazine blared . An &quot; alien prime_minister &quot; masquerading as Mr. Clean who actually gives_and_takes sweetheart deals to favored firms , trumpeted another . He uses &quot; Hitler-like tactics &quot; and back-room bargaining despite pledges to usher_in a new era of open government . And , in one poll , his public support had plunged a whopping 37 % in the last week . Can this be Morihiro Hosokawa , Japan ' s fresh-faced prime_minister who was supposed to be an agent of change and voice for reform ? Is this the man blessed with public approval ratings in the 70 % range despite taking controversial action to open Japan ' s rice market , squarely apologize for the nation ' s wartime misdeeds and tackle political reform ? As Hosokawa meets President Clinton today , it is clear his public standing has , at least temporarily , taken a steep dive . This month ' s political snafu , in which he abruptly announced a new 7 % tax increase , then was forced to renounce it by the ensuing public uproar , shook public_trust and prompted a stream of unflattering headlines . &quot; The honeymoon between Mr. Hosokawa and the public is ending , &quot; said Seizaburo Sato , a Tokyo University professor emeritus affiliated with a think_tank established by former Prime_Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of the Liberal Democratic Party . &quot; Most Americans have too rosy a picture of his abilities . He looks young and fresh . But he is not so talented or smart . He lacks experience . And his political base is weak , so he ' s an easy target to be manipulated by the bureaucrats. &quot; Not that the redoubtable Hosokawa can ' t spring back . His support ratings , ranging from 52 % to 59 % , may be his lowest . But that is still considerably higher than past prime_ministers enjoyed : The popular Toshiki Kaifu drew an average 48 % ; Noboru Takeshita ' s plunged to 3 % just before his resignation in the money-for-stocks Recruit scandal . With his telegenic appeal and aristocratic elegance , Hosokawa has somehow weathered not only policy snafus , but also negative coverage of his &quot; women problem &quot; and alleged sweetheart deals with the giant Seibu group and the gangster-linked Sagawa Kyubin transport firm . &quot; His administration has proven more resilient than most people anticipated , &quot; said Kuniko Inoguchi , a political_science professor at Tokyo ' s Sophia University . &quot; People forgive him because he ' s young , inexperienced and because they think he ' s trying to do something new in a very traditional setting. &quot; In any case , she said , &quot; Clinton has no alternative to Hosokawa. &quot; But how effectively Hosokawa can manage his end of the U.S.-Japan relationship may ultimately have little to do with his public standing at_home . For the United States , the more important questions are : Do Hosokawa ' s decisions carry final authority ? Not necessarily , as his tax fiasco starkly illustrated . Whatever summit agreements may or may_not be reached today , does Hosokawa have the power to force the mighty bureaucracy to implement them as the United States expects ? Almost certainly not . Although Hosokawa pledged to curtail the power of the bureaucrats when he became prime_minister last August , in fact , say many analysts , they have become stronger because the inexperienced coalition government has had to rely more on their expertise . So far , bureaucrats have resisted other Hosokawa pledges , such_as far-ranging deregulation . And is Hosokawa -- or his seven-party coalition -- likely to be in power beyond the year ? Perhaps not . As Yomiuri newspaper political editor Shoichi Oikawa put it : &quot; The critical_point is not whether the ( tax ) affair will undermine his popularity . What matters most is that it has caused a deep crack in his political power base. &quot; Many analysts here see an inevitable split in the coalition between the forces of Ichiro Ozawa , the Japan Renewal Party official who wants Japan to take a more aggressive international role , and those of Masayoshi Takemura , the New Party Harbinger leader who urges a more circumspect role for Japan as a &quot; small but shining nation. &quot; For the United States , that will make the political landscape even more difficult to fathom .</TEXT>
