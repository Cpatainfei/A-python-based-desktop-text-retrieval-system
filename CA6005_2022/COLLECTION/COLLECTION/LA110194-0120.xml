   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; TRACKING THE MYSTICAL TRAVELER ; THE CHURCH FOUNDED BY JOHN-ROGER HAS SPARKED CONTROVERSY OVER SOME OF ITS TEACHINGS , NOW-DEFUNCT GALA AWARDS AND A PEACE RETREAT NEAR SANTA BARBARA . NOW IT IS IN THE NEWS BECAUSE OF ARIANNA HUFFINGTON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even the Mystical Traveler had to admit : Oct . 5 was a particularly trying day in a trying season . Earlier in the fall , California ' s Senate_race had taken a weird hop , with national media and Democratic spin_doctors suddenly blasting Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington , wife of Republican candidate Mike Huffington , for her involvement with spiritual teacher John-Roger and his Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness , or MSIA . All week the Doonesbury comic_strip lampooned Arianna Huffington , calling MSIA &quot; a cult. &quot; That morning , though , the jokes took_on a sinister edge when 53 members of a Swiss-Canadian sect called the Order of the Solar Temple were found dead in a murder-suicide . Abruptly , commentators ' snide slaps at MSIA , which teaches that &quot; the Mystical Traveler Consciousness &quot; can help achieve &quot; Soul Transcendence , &quot; turned more serious . By evening , longtime minister and staff_member John Morton , to whom John-Roger passed &quot; the keys &quot; to the Mystical Traveler Consciousness in 1988 , was countering what he termed media &quot; witch hunts &quot; that threatened MSIA ' s religious freedom , and trying to rebut those who &quot; mocked and . . . persecuted &quot; the movement he loves . Later , in a lengthy interview , Morton said there is enough of a &quot; track record &quot; so that the issue of Arianna Huffington ' s involvement with John-Roger and MSIA will &quot; take_care of itself. &quot; He also said that if she would defend MSIA , it might dispel the notion that &quot; this is ' a cult ' that only stupid fools would get involved in. &quot; The public , he continued , might then see that &quot; maybe Arianna is_on to something that is profound and deep and real. &quot; He added , though , that given her recent efforts to distance herself from MSIA , he felt obliged to describe her involvement &quot; in the past tense. &quot; Arianna Huffington , who declined to be interviewed for this story , has said MSIA is not a cult , that she is a member of the Greek Orthodox Church and that John-Roger , whom she first met in 1973 , is merely a friend . Current or not , her ties to MSIA have put the movement and its 4 # 000 to 5 # 000 participants worldwide back in_the_public_eye . * John-Roger , 60 , was born Roger Delano Hinkins , to Mormon parents , in Rains , Utah . After working_at various jobs and obtaining a psychology degree he moved to California . As a Rosemead High_School English_teacher , Hinkins was , by most accounts , well-liked . Students enjoyed his propensity for turning_out the lights and leading intense &quot; guided imagery &quot; excursions so vivid that some were literally knocked_out of their chairs . In 1963 , Hinkins awoke from a coma caused by a kidney_stone operation , possessed , he said , by the spirit of &quot; John the Beloved. &quot; Hinkins started calling himself John-Roger -- J-R to some . He said he anchored the Mystical Traveler Consciousness , a spiritual mantle that had been assumed by others including Moses and Christ . He spoke_of his communications with &quot; beings of light &quot; and his &quot; special dispensation &quot; to serve humanity . In 1970 , he and the school parted ways , but at least one teacher and one of his former students stuck_with him , and remain involved in MSIA , which was incorporated as a tax-exempt church in 1971 . Over time , the teachings expanded , and J-R -- who said he also anchored a rare force called the Preceptor Consciousness , which comes_to the planet only once every 25 # 000 years -- began offering , for a fee , &quot; aura balancings , &quot; &quot; polarity balancings &quot; and &quot; inner phasings &quot; -- services still integral to MSIA . * On Oct . 5 , about 200 people gathered_in a rented Santa Barbara hall to hear a scheduled &quot; open seminar &quot; by John Morton . Children skittered between pews and folding_chairs . Adults , some of whom had participated in MSIA for 25 years or longer , chatted and expressed amused disbelief that a group that teaches &quot; Don ' t hurt yourself and don ' t hurt others , &quot; was being mentioned in the same breath as Jonestown and Waco . A few longtime followers wore the purple clothes once said to be the Traveler ' s color , and others wore MSIA ' s insignia jewelry . Otherwise , the diverse group could have blended seamlessly into a Lutheran or Catholic congregation . The seminar began with a ritual known as &quot; calling_in the Light. &quot; Then , as &quot; a means of moving farther into the higher realms of consciousness , &quot; the group chanted soothingly what MSIA literature calls the sacred names for empathy and God , Ani-Hu . Finally , with John-Roger , now Traveler emeritus , sitting in the back receiving a neck massage from a smiling woman , Morton strode onstage in a stylish olive suit , looking more junior executive than Mystical Traveler . Morton ' s monologue , like those of John-Roger that run_on public access stations nationwide , came_across to an outsider like stream_of_consciousness . A minister later explained that the Traveler was simply &quot; picking_up &quot; and commenting on the audience ' s thoughts . If so , then some folks were pondering God and soul transcendence , others donations ( &quot; Somebody ' s got this thing about money , &quot; Morton said ) ; banking practices ( &quot; I have no knowledge whatsoever that there are any Swiss bank_accounts or any other secret bank_accounts &quot; ) , and MSIA ' s relations with the Internal Revenue Service ( &quot; In actuality , we ' ve had very good relations with the IRS. &quot; ) Afterward , the hostess returned to the stage , and in the same cheerful PTA president voice in which she announced that cookies and punch would be served , she advised the audience to remain seated and not touch John Morton or John-Roger as they left . &quot; For those people who are new , part of the reason that we ask_for that is that during the seminar , John and John-Roger also work with a spiritual consciousness , and here in the seminar some imbalances from the physical , the emotional , or the mental may be released . . . and then they ' re held around the energy fields of John Morton and John-Roger . . . . If you touch them , then that could get more anchored into their body , and it ' s a little more difficult for them to clear that. &quot; Earlier , Morton had noted in his talk that sometimes the church can strike outsiders as &quot; weird or kooky. &quot; But , he added , &quot; we also appear as very beautiful , loving , joyful people . If you miss that part of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness , you ' re blind. &quot; * Participants have said they were initially attracted to the familial warmth of the early seminars , for which seekers paid $ 3 . But quickly the movement ' s fortunes grew . In 1973 , MSIA purchased a large home_in Mandeville Canyon where John-Roger , who has taken a vow of poverty , lived with his young male staff . The next year , the church purchased the elegant Busby Berkeley mansion on West Adams Boulevard , and renamed it Prana -- the Purple Rose Ashram of the New Age . It later acquired an office_building in Santa Monica and a Lake Arrowhead retreat . In 1978 , John-Roger launched Insight Transformational Seminars , which , according to tax records , brought_in more_than $ 1 million in the first full year . In the 1980s , a handful of ranking ministers left the church , portraying John-Roger as a Svengali . Numerous former ministers said that he used the lure of his awesome cosmic connections to garner wealth and worldly power . Victor Toso was one of three men who had served on John-Roger ' s personal staff who contended that J-R had sexually seduced them under spiritual pretense . Several former members , including Wendell and Susan Whitmore , claimed that when they left MSIA ( previously pronounced &quot; messiah &quot; ) John-Roger or his staff_members had harassed them and vandalized their cars . No one was ever charged in those incidents . John-Roger , who declined to be interviewed for this story , has previously denied allegations of sexual_relations with his staff under spiritual pretense and intimidation . After The Times published a series of articles on the movement in 1988 , John-Roger ' s bad press subsided , and he went_on to launch the best-selling &quot; Life 101 &quot; series of books with author Peter McWilliams . But in March , McWilliams , MSIA ' s 1990 &quot; minister of the year , &quot; left the movement . In June , MSIA sued him , demanding more_than $ 400 # 000 in unpaid royalties and past-due promissory_notes . Williams has said in interviews with The Times and other media that John-Roger &quot; programmed &quot; him to believe that J-R was more powerful than Jesus , then duped him into putting his name on the books . McWilliams says he has paid or donated more_than $ 1 million to the church . Church officials say that McWilliams ' accusations -- which are spelled_out in his speedily self-published book &quot; Life 102 -- What to Do When Your Guru Sues You &quot; -- are simply the author making_good on &quot; blackmail &quot; he threatened when MSIA tried to collect money he had agreed to pay . In any case , McWilliams ' collaboration with John-Roger had brought the movement good publicity after the collapse of its most high-profile effort , the John-Roger Foundation ' s International Integrity Awards . From 1983 to 1987 , media swarmed as the awards were presented to South_Africa ' s Bishop Desmond Tutu , polio researcher Dr. Jonas Salk , then-Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley , consumer activist Ralph Nader and director Oliver Stone , among others , usually at black-tie galas . In 1985 , J-R appeared in Interview magazine , awkwardly posed beside award recipient Mother Teresa . Author Arianna Stassinopoulos , who was ordained an MSIA minister in 1978 , had gone_with J-R to present the prize . In the preface to her interview with him for the magazine , Stassinopoulos wrote that her first encounter with her &quot; way-shower and friend &quot; was a pivotal moment in her long spiritual quest , and that she had studied with him ever since . In 1988 , Jim and Dodie Brady , then MSIA ministers , were in the midst of bringing the annual gala to Washington when they spoke_to staffers and ministers who had left the movement . They began to question the integrity of the man who inspired the awards , they say . Amid considerable turmoil , the event was canceled . Dodie Brady , now a critic of the way Arianna Huffington has represented her relationship with MSIA , says that she is still &quot; embarrassed &quot; that she had helped persuade then-Sen . Alan Cranston and other lawmakers to introduce national legislation that would have declared Sept . 24 -- John-Roger ' s birthday -- an annual Integrity Day . Forty-seven states and 200 cities had already approved such a proclamation . In 1988 , after the cancellation of the Integrity Awards , the MSIA faithful organized a celebration for John-Roger . Led by Morton , the church threw a black-tie bash and presented him with &quot; the symbolic gift &quot; of a $ 752 # 000 house near the John-Roger Foundation ' s Santa Barbara-area ranch , although he still spends most of his time at the Mandeville Canyon home . Morton now lives with wife , printing heiress and MSIA supporter Laura Donnelley-Morton . In July , Architectural Digest featured the couple in their remodeled Brentwood-area &quot; Spanish-Passadian-Oriental-Ranch &quot; style home , which boasts views &quot; from Downtown to Palos Verdes. &quot; Meanwhile , John-Roger ' s teachings continue to spread through MSIA and its aligned organizations . The once-lucrative Insight has gone_through financial travails and is now independently owned by three MSIA participants . MSIA seminars , retreats , trips , Peace Awareness Trainings , Spiritual Warrior workshops and other events are held across the United States and in Canada , Chile , Mexico , Uruguay , Spain and other nations . The focus at the moment , however , is the Institute for Individual and World Peace ' s Windermere ranch , 140 acres of stunning boulder-strewn chaparral overlooking Santa Barbara and the Channel Islands . Katherine Hall , vice_president of the institute ( of which John-Roger is president ) , said the plan for Windermere is to create a peace retreat to help realize the institute slogan : &quot; Peace in the world will result when we take responsibility for peace in our lives. &quot; Many of John-Roger ' s and John Morton ' s movement activities now go toward raising money for Windermere , where events for the aligned organizations would be held . Wealthy donors have also been generous . Carl Wilson of the Beach Boys and Donnelley-Morton have each contributed more_than $ 200 # 000 to the institute , according to tax records . Arianna Huffington contributed $ 35 # 000 between September , 1990 , and November , 1992 , and McWilliams contributed more_than $ 54 # 000 before parting ways with John-Roger . The Peace Institute has also donated to several &quot; designated charities &quot; in the past five years . The largest amounts have gone_to MSIA , with smaller checks written to other John-Roger-aligned organizations , including the University of Santa Monica , Peace Theological Seminary and the Educare Foundation , which teaches the Achievement and Commitment to Excellence self-esteem program in some public_schools . John-Roger defines &quot; peace &quot; as &quot; the cessation of againstness. &quot; And the institute -- previously the John-Roger Foundation -- has faced plenty of againstness regarding Windermere . The most recent plans shown to neighbors , scaled back from the original drawings , include a 3 # 600-square-foot dining facility , a 3 # 000-square-foot community building , a new hay barn , a basketball_court as well as 10 one- and two-story cabins and campsites . But neighbors in the remote community with its narrow winding roads cite fire danger and traffic , noise , water and environmental concerns . They complain , too , that the Peace Institute plays hardball . In 1987 , the John-Roger Foundation sued resident Helen Larsen for $ 1 million to gain access to a small road on her property . The suit was dismissed three years later , and Larsen said the institute reimbursed her legal_fees . &quot; From the moment the John-Roger Foundation came_into this community , &quot; Larsen said , &quot; I have known no peaceful enjoyment ; instead I have felt harassed and invaded. &quot; Hall says she is confident that consensus can be reached in the community . The institute has worked closely with the neighbors , and a team of top consultants has offered assurance that the uses the institute envisions are harmonious with the environment and the community ' s needs , she said . For neighbors Craig and Judy Jennings , though , the problem with Windermere is symbolized by the 8 # 000-square-foot barn the institute built_in 1992 , while the site was still zoned for agriculture but then used for institute events . The barn was necessary , said ranch manager and MSIA minister Jack Espey , to keep the ranch ' s 46 horses warm on cold nights . Indeed , about half the cavernous space has a dirt floor and paddocks . But another large section is carpeted and paneled , has ceiling fans , insulation , a massive air-conditioning system and a panel of switches controlling various functions , including stage lights . A placard on one wall sports a roster of people who contributed to the &quot; tree fund &quot; in 1991 and 1992 . &quot; I can ' t help but think_of it as a ' compound , ' &quot; Craig Jennings said , smiling . * Morton , MSIA President Paul Kaye and other participants are frustrated by renewed suggestions that their ecumenical church , which encourages the spreading of &quot; Light and Love , &quot; is a cult . What keeps people working with MSIA , Morton and Kaye say , is the value they get from the Traveler ' s teachings -- that God is within everyone , that &quot; no soul shall be lost. &quot; &quot; This is a brilliant teaching , &quot; Kaye said . But John-Roger ' s words , recorded in more_than 24 books , 5 # 000 tapes and 144 monthly &quot; soul awareness discourses , &quot; are open_to interpretation . And to complicate matters , his supporters say that much of what happens in seminars is not necessarily meant to be grasped on &quot; the word level. &quot; Students of the Traveler -- J-R used to call them &quot; votaries &quot; -- negotiate a labyrinth of his cosmic insight on working with the Light , overcoming karma , reincarnation , the negative &quot; kal power , &quot; and moving through the lower realms -- physical , astral , causal , mental , etheric -- toward Soul Transcendence . Admirers have no problem shrugging_off the more unusual aspects of the teachings , and seem baffled that outsiders see anything in J-R but love and selfless commitment to serving others . Heide Banks , 38 , first attended a John-Roger seminar 16 years ago . She continues to study the teachings , but adds that MSIA is only a part of a life that is rich with friends and activities outside the movement . Of John-Roger , she said : &quot; I think he has a tremendous loving energy around him , that really encourages people to be the best that they can be. &quot; Kaye and Banks said that most people who study with MSIA never &quot; put J-R on a pedestal &quot; and those who move_on do so without bitterness . Both independently suggested nine-year participant Victoria Marine as an example . From October , 1990 , until November , 1992 , Marine lived at Prana and edited the movement ' s New Day Herald newspaper , with John-Roger as her editor-in-chief . When she left MSIA early last month , she wrote letters saying she did so with no &quot; againstness &quot; toward anyone . But since then , she said , &quot; my eyes have opened a little . . . it ' s like I put my glasses on and started seeing clearly . . . The more I go_along now , the more I think , ' My God , I was manipulated and used. ' &quot; Marine , 35 , now attends First Presbyterian_Church of Hollywood , which she said seems &quot; open &quot; and &quot; inexpensive. &quot; In contrast , MSIA &quot; charges for everything , &quot; she said , from seminars to polarity balancings ; MSIA initiates are discouraged from sharing their thoughts with each other , she said , and many ministers were so obedient to J-R that they abided_by the most offbeat rules . Marine said many staffers would not eat pork or garlic before conducting services such_as aura balancings because J-R is allergic to those foods and could be affected , even though he participates only &quot; spiritually &quot; from afar . Marine said her recent questioning of MSIA was in part inspired by the &quot; suspicious &quot; call she got from Banks , who wanted to know if she would talk to a reporter . &quot; She asked , would I be OK if ( the reporter ) asked me about Arianna ? The question seemed strange : Would I be OK ? What does that mean ? Will I have a seizure , start crying ? &quot; Banks later said she never mentioned Arianna Huffington . Marine said that she had talked to Huffington and attended several seminars and a retreat open only to ministers and initiates with her in recent years . Once , she wanted to publish some &quot; excellent &quot; photographs of J-R holding Arianna ' s daughter , but the answer was no . With J-R ' s permission , Marine said she sent the photos and the negatives to Arianna ' s sister , Agapi Stassinopoulos , a longtime MSIA participant . Huffington campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Grossman said Friday that Arianna Huffington has spent too_much time &quot; trying to rebut malicious lies and rumors &quot; and will let her &quot; six books and countless speeches speak_for themselves . . . . She will not participate in a witch hunt by association. &quot; * Morton , Kaye and others say that the teachings of the Traveler are compatible with mainstream Christianity ; that John-Roger frequently says : &quot; Jesus is my boss. &quot; Morton provides a folder of J-R ' s quotes that mention the teachings of Jesus . But it is easy to thumb through movement literature and find passages where John-Roger or supporters portray the Traveler as Christlike , or state that the positions J-R &quot; anchors &quot; are of greater cosmic importance than Jesus ' . For example , in &quot; The Path to Mastership , &quot; a book updated in 1982 , John-Roger writes : &quot; Buddha said , ' I am the Light of Asia. ' Christ said , ' I am the Light of the world. ' The Traveler says , ' I am the Light of the universe ' ; And the Preceptor says , ' I am the Light of all universes. ' This is not a spiritual promise . It is reality. &quot; For a church apparently intent_on establishing its credentials for Christian-compatibility , the iconography of Western religion is conspicuously scarce . A tour of Prana reveals the estate as a pleasant place for spiritual study . There is a statue of the_Buddha on one table and a Hindu sculpture in a nook . One resident ' s room does display a half-dozen or so portraits of Christ , but they are surrounded by a reverential display of even more images of John-Roger , which are everywhere in Prana , now called the Peace Theological Seminary and College of Philosophy . Marine said simply : &quot; You have all these normal , nice , intelligent people repeating what J-R says , even bizarre things , and if enough say it you start to accept it yourself. &quot; In August , anticipating McWilliams ' book , MSIA ' s Kaye wrote a letter to discourse subscribers urging them to &quot; look within &quot; for answers to the coming questions : &quot; Is MSIA a strange cult ? Is this the real_thing or some money-making scheme ? &quot; He pointed_out that in 1988 , when The Times and other publications reported &quot; rumors &quot; about John-Roger and MSIA , discourse subscriptions dropped . &quot; But ironically , &quot; he added , &quot; it impacted positively in terms of income flowing to the church , because the people still involved upped their involvement and commitment . &quot; Many of you are probably wondering how J-R is doing with all_of this . The answer is , just fine. &quot; Times researcher Peter Johnson and Times staff writer Kenneth R . Weiss contributed to this story .</TEXT>
