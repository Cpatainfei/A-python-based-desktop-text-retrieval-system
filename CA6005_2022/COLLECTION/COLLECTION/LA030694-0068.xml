   <HEADLINE> RECORD RACK : IN BRIEF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * 1 / 2 Hammer , &quot; The Funky Headhunter , &quot; Giant . Hammer the gangsta rapper.Sounds silly , doesn ' t it ? About as silly as most of this album . Hammer has opportunistically shifted genres now that pop rap , which he rode to superstardom , is_on the skids . The problem is that Hammer has zero feel_for gangsta rap . The album is not a total disaster , thanks to some smashing beats and the unbelievably funky &quot; Don ' t Stop &quot; -- but it ' s close . New albums are rated on a scale of one star ( poor ) , two stars ( fair ) , three stars ( good ) and four stars ( excellent ) . DENNIS HUNT</TEXT>
