   <HEADLINE> A LIFE_STORY WOVEN OF TRUTH AND FICTION ; ONCE UPON A TIME BY JOHN BARTH ; LITTLE BROWN $ 23.95 , 398 PAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It must be an uneasy thing for a fiction writer to attempt a memoir . Suddenly , the same life on which imaginary cattle have been grazing is stampeded by ravenous fact-bent goats who will leave no clod untrampled nor grass blade unchewed . Unease masters John Barth ' s talky hybrid , &quot; Once Upon a Time. &quot; An autobiographical story is gingerly conducted through its verbal fireworks but it is given no peace and not much scope . Like a penitent switching from confessional to confessional lest any one particular priest get a fix on him , Barth keeps shifting narrative modes from real to fictional to hyper-real to metafictional . There is the Barth who gets reviewed : the author of 11 books , starting with &quot; The Floating Opera &quot; and running_through &quot; The Sotweed Factor , &quot; &quot; Giles Goatboy &quot; and &quot; The Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor. &quot; He is a retired Johns Hopkins professor , a literary lecturer long in_demand around the United States and abroad , and a graybeard living a long and happy second marriage on the Chesapeake Bay shore and cruising overnight on a well-appointed sloop . There is the Barth who , with his wife , takes a realistic but fictional sail . After some argument -- how splendidly he portrays the pains and strengths of a long marriage -- he insists upon pressing_on , despite an approaching hurricane . They are blown all around the bay -- a splendid amateur ' s ordeal -- and shelter in a marshy labyrinth of canals . Putt-putting through the canals by dinghy to find a way_out , he gets lost -- again , splendidly . The lostness turns emblematic , like Dante ' s ; and , like the middle-aged Dante , Barth comes_upon two guides with whom he will explore , debate , fantasize and turn inside-out the story and meaning of his life and art . One is his twin sister , Jill ; the other an imaginary , preachy , irritable &quot; counter-self &quot; named Jay Wordsworth Scribner . ( At other times he is called Schreiber , which is German for writer ; and Scribner , of course , comes from scrivener . ) Every step of the way is a battle between what is told and the author ' s commentary on how he is telling it . He tells , he conducts -- and he tells us how he is conducting . There is a play_on narrative time so elaborate that I lost its thread ; something about the author simultaneously speaking at the start of the book and the finish , several years later . Threads are essential to labyrinths , but so is wanting to get_through them ; if the wanting flags , losing the thread matters less . Certainly , Barth has a story to tell and much of what he tells is provocative . But as one of the earliest of our postmodernists -- his first novel was published in 1956 -- he had a young_man ' s quarrel with straight narration , and today he has the veteran ' s loyalty to his old war . You write and you write_of yourself writing , and of the possibility of writing differently . When it works -- how well it worked with &quot; The Floating Opera &quot; -- it gives a complex and haunting resonance to the narrative ; overtones on a mute string . But in a number of Barth ' s later works , and for much of this one , it is a mechanical contrivance that all too often draws attention toward the speaker ' s effort and away from his speech . The sections about his childhood in Tidewater , Md. , his gentle , incompetent parents , his early explorations of jazz , are interesting but distracted . He doesn ' t give himself to them ; he is too busy inflecting them . He tells us something about his first marriage , which eroded gradually over 20 years , but his reticence is such_that we are spared not merely indiscretions but any sense whatever of his wife . There is a brief , beautifully rendered account of falling_in_love with the former student who became his second wife , and reticence settles in again . We don ' t require the memorialist ' s details ; we do require his commitment . There are flashes of Barth ' s prestidigitator ingenuity ; and why quarrel with the hat if a rabbit does indeed come_out of it ? Too often none does . The author ' s quarrelsome dialogues with Scribner , his counter-self , hardly differ from someone talking to himself , in fact , and at great length . On the other hand there is a memorable running account of the pain , phobias and manias that attend the writer ' s life . Barth writes a bravura passage about his fountain_pens ; an even better one about the 40-year-old college binder in which all his first drafts have been written . His struggle to get &quot; The Floating Opera &quot; published -- six publishers rejected it and at one point his agent , a kindly Alabamian who loved to hunt , offered to send 600 pounds of frozen moose to keep him and his family going -- is a memorable mix of comedy and agony . It is the glimpses of real_things , surviving Barth ' s insistence on spinning them , that give this book its value . Postmodernist devices don ' t suit a memoir . The past , after all , is a shadow ; it needs constructing , not the reverse .</TEXT>
