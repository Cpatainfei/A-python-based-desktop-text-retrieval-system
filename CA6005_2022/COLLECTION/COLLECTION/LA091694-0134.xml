   <HEADLINE> JAPAN SAYS IT WILL MAKE_GOOD ON VOW TO PAY FOR U.S. TROOP SUPPORT ; ASIA : STATEMENT MAY SETTLE DISPUTE OVER $ 300-MILLION INCREASE PROMISED FOR COSTS OF UTILITIES , CIVILIANS WORKING_ON AMERICAN BASES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an attempt to head_off a contretemps between Washington and Tokyo , Japanese Defense Minister Tokuichiro Tamazawa said Thursday that Japan will make a &quot; maximum effort &quot; to pay the United States the additional money it earlier had promised for the support of American troops stationed in Japan . So far , to the consternation of American military planners , the Japanese Defense Agency has budgeted_for only half of the $ 300-million increase it was scheduled to pay the United States next year as &quot; host-nation support &quot; for American forces . Under an agreement worked_out in 1991 , Japan was supposed to assume the full costs next year of more_than 22 # 000 Japanese civilians who work_on American military bases , as well as the bases ' utility bills . The issue is important , because any dispute over the costs of the bases could affect the close security relationship between the United States and Japan . Despite the frequent economic frictions between the two countries and the recent political upheavals in Japan , Washington and Tokyo have managed to avoid any major change in the military alliance that prevailed during the Cold_War . Tamazawa , who met in Washington on Thursday with Defense_Secretary William J . Perry and Vice_President Al Gore , insisted that the new Japanese government headed by Socialist Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama eventually will be able to pay more for the U.S. troops than is now earmarked for the budget . Japanese government ministries will be reviewing the issue during the next few months , he said . &quot; We would like to ask the United States to please watch and see what will happen , &quot; he explained in an interview with The Times and with the Yomiuri Shimbun , one of Japan ' s leading newspapers . He did not specify how much more Japan will pay and did not say whether it will contribute all_the money originally promised . This year , Japan is spending about $ 2.5 billion in host-nation support to offset the costs of the 44 # 000 American troops on its soil . That sum includes 75 % of both the utility bills on the bases and the salaries of Japanese workers there . Under the earlier agreement , Japan ' s share of these costs was supposed to go_up to 100 % in the next fiscal_year , which begins in April , 1995 . But the Japanese Defense Agency was told this summer that its overall budget , which is about $ 47 billion this year , can increase by no more_than 0.9 % next year . And defense officials decided that the scheduled payments to the Americans might have to be scaled back along with Japan ' s other defense costs . &quot; We were of course very concerned about not lowering the level of ( Japanese ) defense , &quot; Tamazawa said Thursday . &quot; And at_the_same_time we were interested in paying ( the United States ) for the labor costs &quot; of Japanese workers . The suggestion that Japan ' s payments to the United States might be as much as $ 150 million lower than expected raised some fears about how U.S. military_forces in Asia might be affected . Richard Macke , the commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific , visited Tokyo for top-level meetings last month . In the interview , Tamazawa also contended that Japan should be granted a permanent seat on the United Nations Security_Council , without taking_part in any U.N. peacekeeping operations that would involve military conflict . Japan recently agreed to send Japanese troops to provide humanitarian aid to Rwandan refugees in Zaire . But it did so only after repeatedly delaying the departure of the troops and forbidding them to enter Rwanda because there is no cease-fire there . Some American officials have argued that it is unfair for Japan to insist on terms for Security_Council membership in which U.S. forces might be forced to shed_blood in U.N. peacekeeping operations , while Japanese forces would be freed from any similar danger . But the defense minister said that Japan is worried about being forced to comply with a U.N. resolution in which it would be required to send its troops for a peacekeeping operation somewhere in Asia . He noted that Russia and China , which now have two of the five permanent seats on the Security_Council , have not sent their forces abroad on peacekeeping missions .</TEXT>
