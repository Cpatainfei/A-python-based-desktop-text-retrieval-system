   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; MICROSOFT UNVEILS SOFTWARE FOR INTERACTIVE VIDEO USE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Microsoft Corp . unveiled a computer_program code-named Tiger on Tuesday , calling it the first major element in its strategic thrust into the emerging world of interactive television . Tiger , which relies_on low-cost personal_computer hardware to deliver audio and video information , will compete with more expensive offerings by companies such_as IBM and Oracle , whose software depends_on larger and costlier computers . Microsoft ' s goal is to become a dominant supplier of software for video servers . But some analysts said Microsoft ' s offering , which may_not be available in its fully configured form for years , could prove to be a paper tiger , another example of Microsoft ' s well-known strategy of announcing products long before they are available . Critics said the announcement could be designed to dissuade customers from buying a competing product that is already on the market . Either way , the stakes are high . The market for such video servers is expected to grow from just $ 50 million this year to anywhere from $ 1 billion to $ 5 billion by 1998 , depending_on how fast cable and telephone_companies roll_out their promised interactive systems . At a hotel conference_room , Microsoft demonstrated how a single $ 2 # 000 Compaq computer outfitted with Tiger could simultaneously send different movies to 16 television monitors , each of which could be fast-forwarded or reversed . Craig Mundie , vice_president of advanced consumer technology at Microsoft , said the same computer could &quot; easily support 100 video streams , &quot; a claim that brought looks of disbelief from some engineers in the audience . A key obstacle in the spread of interactive television has been the high cost of video servers . Most of those used in ongoing trials cost nearly $ 3 # 000 per subscriber . Microsoft ' s claims suggest costs dramatically lower . Tiger will be tested in Seattle beginning next year , with full-scale deployment in 1996 . A fault-tolerant , &quot; self-healing &quot; function in the system will give it the reliability necessary for large-scale systems , the company said . Microsoft said Tiger will be available from Intel and Compaq later this year . But the company concedes that early systems will be used for lower-end applications such_as hotel video services . Skeptics suggested Microsoft may have been premature in its announcement . &quot; Whenever something new comes_out , they say they will come_out with their own product soon , &quot; said Richard Shaffer , editor of Technologic Partners ' industry newsletters . &quot; A little cage rattling can chill the market for competitors. &quot; But competitors aren ' t shaking in their boots . &quot; They have a long way to go from their roots ( in personal_computers ) to providing everything that is necessary &quot; for large-scale interactive television , said Jerry Held , senior_vice_president for Interactive Multimedia Products at Oracle . Oracle , whose system is being used by British Telecom and will be tested by Bell Atlantic and U.S. West , announced Tuesday that its software is available on Hewlett-Packard video servers , as well as its own parallel computer_systems .</TEXT>
