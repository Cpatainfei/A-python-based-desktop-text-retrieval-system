   <HEADLINE> ' 90S FAMILY ; PARENTING CENTERS GIVE FAMILIES PLACE TO HEAL ; SOCIAL_SERVICES : TROUBLED ADULTS LEARN HOW TO BE BETTER PARENTS . BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY , CHILDREN CAN SPEND TIME WITH MOM OR DAD WITHOUT FEAR OF NEGLECT OR ABUSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There were days when the young mother , a manic-depressive , never left her bedroom . Her three children , ages 2 to 9 , were left to fend_for themselves . When she tried to commit suicide almost two years ago , her children were placed in foster care by the Los Angeles County Department of Children ' s Services . But the woman has been reunited with her children and says her worst days are behind her . She gives credit for keeping connected with them to the Family Visitation / Parent Learning Center in North Hollywood , a new type of social_service center that has gained popularity nationally . Located on a quiet street shaded by lush sycamore trees , the ranch-style home provides a safe environment where at-risk children can spend time with their families without fear of additional neglect or abuse . Sponsored by the nonprofit Children ' s Bureau of Southern California , it is one of eight visitation centers in Southern California and about 100 nationwide . It offers parent-education classes and support groups for abuse prevention . Other supervised visitation centers provide a neutral site for the children of parents caught in custody_battles . Through her experiences at the North Hollywood facility , the woman said she learned to &quot; parent like an adult. &quot; The guidance she received from the staff &quot; helped get my children home by helping me gain confidence as a parent , &quot; she added . &quot; I still bonded with my children , because I was able to care_for them like at my own home. &quot; Such centers are becoming the &quot; social_service of the future , &quot; said Joanne Karolzak , president of the nonprofit Visitation Network in Tucson . &quot; There is a greater understanding -- on the part of judges , family-law attorneys and psychologists -- of children needing to maintain relations with their birth parents , &quot; she said . The visitation centers &quot; provide a safe place so the parent and child can maintain contact. &quot; When children are separated from their parents , no matter what the reason , they experience loss , Karolzak said . &quot; In order for them to go_through the grieving and healing process , they must maintain contact with both their parents . Otherwise , they can become emotionally stunted. &quot; Foster children , she continued , are at a greater risk , because they are separated from both parents . But children separated from a parent through divorce face the same sense of loss . &quot; Children need ongoing relationships with their non-custodial parent . But sometimes it is not safe for children , so supervised visits become necessary. &quot; Visitation centers received a boost -- at least temporarily -- in September when Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law the $ 30-billion crime bill . Part of that bill was the Child Safety Act , which called_for $ 15 million to fund up_to 50 supervised visitation centers for &quot; the protection of children from the trauma of witnessing or experiencing death during parental / child visitations or visitation exchanges. &quot; In spite of recent Republican victories in Congress , Karolzak does not think visitation centers will suffer . &quot; Supervised visitation is law-and-order oriented . If they see supervised visitation as an enforcement agency , it should fare well &quot; in the debate over spending , she said . Bridge Focus , a nonprofit agency in Burbank , provides supervised visitation for 35 families per year involved in custody disputes . Family-law attorneys and judges refer clients to the agency for monitoring in cases of allegations of physical or mental abuse . In spite of the degree of abuse , said Richard Hill , director of Bridge Focus , &quot; the child wants to maintain the relationship with his ( estranged ) parent , but they want the hurting to stop . They don ' t want the bad stuff to continue . So we protect them for their own well-being. &quot; Bridge Focus offers fees on a sliding scale to its clients , which is an advantage to most parents who are deluged with legal_fees during a divorce , Hill said . But because of a cut_in county funds to $ 14 # 000 annually -- down from $ 25 # 000 -- visitations are being reduced to three per week . The North Hollywood visitation center , opened July 1 , allows 12 children , from infants to 5 years old , to meet weekly with their birth parents . These children are referred by the Children ' s Services because of their families ' involvement in substance_abuse , mental_illness or other forms of abuse or neglect . Beginning in 1983 , the Children ' s Bureau placed at-risk children younger than 5 in residential group homes . But running a group home cost the taxpayer nearly $ 50 # 000 a year per child , said Alex Morales , executive_director of the Children ' s Bureau . The agency now serves 12 children each year for the same money it used to spend serving one , Morales said . At the visitation center , foster-care children meet with their birth parents up_to three times a week from two to 10 hours per visit . The staff does more_than monitor visits , said Penelope Katz , visitation center social_worker . &quot; They try to coach parents on how to play with their child , how to fix a child a nutritious meal or how to discipline the child. &quot; Many parents of abused or neglected children do not know how to parent , Katz added . &quot; This program allows them the opportunity to learn practical skills in a safe place . &quot; When a child is removed from a home , the parent-child bond is broken . If parents have the opportunity to bond with their child , the tendency toward abuse decreases , &quot; Katz said . The soft-spoken woman with the three children agreed . &quot; The ( parenting ) classes give me a place to talk_about what I need to do , &quot; she said . &quot; They help me to hear what other parents are going_through with their children. &quot;</TEXT>
