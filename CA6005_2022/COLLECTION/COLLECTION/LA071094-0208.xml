   <HEADLINE> THE NATION ; CONFRONTING THE MATTER OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> America ' s elites have decided that personal responsibility ' s time has come . Major print and electronic media feature virtue as the subject of cover articles and lead_stories . In the political_arena , Democrats from the President on down , long reluctant to embrace an issue more often associated with Republicans , can hardly step to a podium without invoking values . This public focus is welcome , as well as overdue . But , in truth , personal responsibility ' s time never went . The vast majority of Americans of all faiths , races and political persuasions try today , just as they always have , to live according to standards of behavior as old as civilization . They obey the law , work hard , respect their neighbors and raise their children to do the same . For five years or more , almost unnoticed by the media , local communities have been working to return character to our schools and streets . The reason is simple : According to a recent poll , 73 % of Americans worry that the nation is experiencing a moral decline . They are right to be concerned . The symptoms of America ' s social decay hardly bear repeating . The explosive rise of illegitimacy since 1960 has plunged millions into material poverty and moral dependence . An epidemic of crime has created a climate of fear in many neighborhoods and schools . Much of our popular culture is dominated by promiscuity , violence -- or both . Worse yet , our judicial and education systems often seem helpless to stem the rising tide of social decay . The manifestations of America ' s crisis in values may be complex . But its cause is clear . It embodies the idea that somebody else is responsible_for our actions and reflects a rejection of personal responsibility . The price of this denial of personal responsibility is staggering . By some estimates , crime alone costs the American economy more_than $ 600 billion a year . Substance_abuse and illegitimacy add countless billions more . But the human cost paid in death , ruined lives and dashed hopes is far higher . And it falls , in cruel disproportion , on our most vulnerable . It would be folly , however , to identify today ' s crisis in values solely with America ' s most disadvantaged , the &quot; underclass. &quot; Whatever the outcome of the O.J. Simpson case -- and it is important to recall his presumption of innocence under law -- Nicole Brown Simpson ' s history of abuse at her husband ' s hands reminds us that domestic violence crosses economic lines . Denial of responsibility has tainted all levels of American society , especially its young . Teen-age drug and alcohol_abuse are major problems in the poshest of suburbs . Sexual promiscuity is not limited to the inner_city -- nor is the disease and illegitimacy that go_with it . America ' s crisis in values is so pervasive that no single approach can address it . Public policy can and indeed must play a part . But so , too , must community action and individual engagement . At the government level , statehouses are leading the way . Legislatures across the nation have passed measures -- including mandatory sentencing and &quot; three strikes , you ' re out &quot; provisions for repeat violent offenders -- that will help put the onus of crime where it belongs : on the criminal . Republican governors in Massachusetts , Wisconsin and New Jersey are pushing innovative welfare reforms designed to return responsibility to the system through strict work requirements . Typically , Washington ' s record is more mixed . A tough crime bill has still not received congressional approval , because of efforts by liberal House Democrats to scuttle it . The President ' s much-touted plan to &quot; end welfare as we know it &quot; is short on both details and teeth -- it won ' t even apply to two-thirds of the 5 million American families now on welfare . The Administration ' s health-care plan -- with employer mandates , price_controls and a huge bureaucracy -- marks a step away from personal responsibility and toward the &quot; government knows best &quot; philosophy that landed America in so_much trouble in the first place . But communities are not waiting for Washington . Groups like the Character Counts Coalition , representing 27 organizations and led by actor Tom Selleck and former Rep . Barbara Jordan , are working to put personal responsibility back where it belongs : at the top of the nation ' s youth agenda . School_boards are considering ways to strengthen curricula , with a new emphasis on old virtues like trustworthiness , respect and citizenship . These local efforts don ' t begin and end in the classroom . The idea of community service for young people -- of giving to , as well as taking from , society -- is being put into practice around the country . So , too , are innovative programs aimed at preventing teen-age pregnancy through responsible behavior , before it produces more fatherless families and poverty . Still , more_than legislation and community action will be needed if the slide in American morals and morale is to be stopped -- much less reversed . Here , the individual as role_model remains key . This must begin at the top , with public figures . True , scandal among the elite , whether in sports , the arts or politics , is nothing new . Nor is the general public ' s fascination with it . If scandal becomes widespread enough , however , it can begin to fray a society ' s moral fabric . This is what the &quot; character &quot; question is all about : not so_much the character of a single individual , but the standard of laxity -- whether in terms of individual integrity or personal veracity -- that he or she sets for society at_large . Yes , public figures have a right_to_privacy . But they also have a responsibility to serve as models of personal conduct . The current crisis in values reaches back to the 1960s , when cultural relativism , moral permissiveness and a willingness to blame society for individual behavior began to shape elite opinion and undermine the concept of personal responsibility . In the years since , there were those who recognized these trends and called_for remedial action . These critics , usually conservative , were condemned for what liberals called their intolerance , alarmism and , above all , lack of compassion . Nothing could be farther from the truth . Now as then , the conservative critique of American society is grounded in a profound sympathy for society ' s less fortunate . But that sympathy is tempered by two truths . The first is the demonstrable inability of government programs to serve as cure-alls for social ills . Indeed , some of the most ambitious Great Society programs of the 1960s , most notably in welfare , actually hurt those they intended to help . The second is the link between personal responsibility and individual opportunity . The &quot; American_dream &quot; -- of a rewarding job , a home and a family and community to take_pride in -- cannot be conferred by government fiat . It must be earned , as it has been by generations of Americans , through diligence and honesty -- in short , by personal responsibility . America began its disastrous experiment in social permissiveness 30 years ago . It may take another three decades to reverse the process . One thing , however , will ensure that we fail in this endeavor : a general retreat from the public sphere . Faced with societal decline , there is a great urge to withdraw into family and career . Ironically , this temptation is felt most strongly by the majority of Americans for whom personal responsibility is an important part of their lives . We often hear the question , &quot; Where are America ' s role_models ? &quot; &quot; Behind locked doors and barred windows , &quot; is too often the answer . Signs of a turn_away from civic life remain strong . Voter participation , despite its upturn in the 1992 election , continues down . Disillusion with public institutions is at an all-time high . Washington , in particular , has become a byword for feckless action and fatuous rhetoric . Ultimately , however , attempts to escape the moral crisis confronting America will be futile . Social decay is intruding_on our streets , in our schools and on our TV screens . Engagement by individual Americans remains crucial . And it must be_on the widest possible front : in local communities , church groups , civic organizations and the broader political_arena . Without sustained engagement by Americans , the current focus_on virtue and values could prove just this month ' s media cause_celebre . America cannot allow this . Personal responsibility is what made us a strong nation . A continuing crisis in values will reduce us to a weak one. *</TEXT>
