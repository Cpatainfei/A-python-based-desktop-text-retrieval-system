   <HEADLINE> HOW SOME U.S. UNIVERSITIES OPERATE IN THE INFORMATION AGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four out of five of the nation ' s colleges and universities are connected to the Internet , allowing students , faculty and administrators to talk to each other and share resources worldwide . Many schools now automatically give students an electronic_mail account when they register . Some go much further by providing computers , accepting applications and class registration electronically or even holding &quot; paperless &quot; classes . Some examples , gathered chiefly through e-mail conversations with students , faculty and administrators across the country : * Cedarville College , Cedarville , Ohio : Wes Baker , a communications professor at this private 2 # 300-student school , teaches a class in_person for a_few weeks , then over the campus e-mail network and then by video conferencing . His discovery : &quot; Students who don ' t feel comfortable particularly in class are much more likely to make comments during the e-mail sessions. &quot; But those who are most outgoing in_person don ' t like the e-mail and video conferencing as much . That could be a sign of how people will choose their favorite communication method in the future . &quot; You go_with whatever fits your personality , &quot; Baker said . * Dartmouth College , Hanover , N.H. : Widely acknowledged as a pioneer in the move by colleges toward pervasive use of electronic_communication . Student organizations paid to put computers in dining halls and other public locations so messages can be accessed nearly everywhere . &quot; It ' s part of the culture here , &quot; said Larry Levine , director of computing . For three years , Dartmouth has required first-year students to own a personal_computer . The machine of choice : the Apple Macintosh . * Drew University , Madison , N.J. : In 1984 , Drew began issuing personal_computers , printers and software to incoming students . The school prorates the cost into its tuition so students can take the machines with them at graduation . * Rochester Institute of Technology , Rochester , N.Y. : More_than 750 of the school ' s residence_hall rooms have computer_network connections and the remaining 1 # 000 will be wired during the next year . The campus network has become a key tool for 2 # 700 students in 120 &quot; distance learning &quot; courses . A popular feature of the system is a discussion area where students and faculty debate topics such_as media coverage of O.J. Simpson or the U.S. role in Haiti . * University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Mich. : Home to a key computer on the Internet , Michigan also has one of the largest networks for students and faculty , used by about 50 # 000 people . About one-third of school ' s residence_hall rooms and apartments have networking connections . Its system also supports video signals that are compressed to fit through normal phone_lines . Officials believe phone_calls to the university ' s main information number are declining because more of the information that people seek , including how to reach students and faculty , is available on-line . * University of Minnesota-Crookston , Crookston , Minn. : The 850-student school got the nickname &quot; ThinkPad U &quot; after it began providing each student with an IBM laptop_computer last year . The school bought more advanced models for this year ' s students and , in 12 of its classrooms , has equipped each desk with a network connection .</TEXT>
