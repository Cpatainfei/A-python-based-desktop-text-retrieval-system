   <HEADLINE> MONARCH VIEWS PEACE AS HIS GREATEST LEGACY ; JORDAN : KING HUSSEIN IS REPORTED TO BE THINKING ABOUT MORTALITY . BUT ADVISERS SAY NO DECISION HAS LEFT HIM AS CONFIDENT AS THE TREATY WITH ISRAEL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> King Hussein calls the peace_treaty to be ceremoniously signed with Israel today his gift to the Jordanian people , the greatest legacy of his more_than four decades on the throne . Although voices of opposition from both the left and the right are getting loud enough here that the king felt compelled to urge restraint Monday in a televised speech to the army , his advisers say the monarch has never projected more certainty and confidence about a political decision . &quot; The king is thinking_about his own mortality , and about what will happen to Jordan after he is gone , &quot; said a senior official at the royal court , speaking on condition of anonymity . &quot; He wants to leave Jordan stable and with a chance for a good future. &quot; As thousands of dignitaries and reporters descended on Jordan for the signing ceremony , Hussein appeared to be reveling in the moment . In every public appearance , the king seemed relaxed , even ebullient . Only on Monday did the carping of Arab leaders that he made an agreement too soon , and the criticism from some of_his_own subjects that he did not wrest enough concessions from Israel , provoke a response . &quot; A minority among the people has attacked it ( the treaty ) , &quot; Hussein told a gathering of army_officers , &quot; and part of our democratic life and our respect for the people ' s rights is to allow them to express their views . But I would like to remind them of the . . . need for the minority to respect the views of the majority. &quot; Hussein intends to make the most of President Clinton ' s one-day stay here , the first presidential visit since Richard Nixon came_in 1974 . After Clinton attends the signing ceremony in southern Jordan , Hussein will accompany him on a tour of Petra , an ancient city carved in red rock . The two then will fly to Amman , where Clinton will address Parliament and be feted at a state banquet in the king ' s hilltop palace . Hussein was particularly eager for Clinton to address the 80-member Parliament , Western diplomats said , because it is the symbol of his efforts to build institutions that will outlive him . But the king was said to be distressed by the announced intention of 16 militant Islamic legislators to boycott the President ' s speech . Members of the Islamic Action Front said they will walk_out to protest the peace_treaty and U.S. policy in the region . Some leftist parliamentarians have also threatened to disrupt the President ' s speech to voice their opposition to the treaty and the U.S. role in brokering it . &quot; There is anxiety at the palace that the parliamentarians will hurt the king ' s credibility , &quot; said one senior Western diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity . But Parliament ' s rambunctiousness is an embarrassment to Hussein , not a threat , analysts here agree . His decision to sign a peace_treaty with Israel without waiting for Syria to go first startled some Jordanians and angered others , but it has not aroused any significant opposition . &quot; I think there is a sense of realism , a sense that somehow the Arab-Israeli conflict must come_to an end , &quot; said Mustafa Hamarneh , director of the University of Jordan ' s Center for Strategic Studies . The king remains enormously popular_with the vast majority of Jordanians , said Hamarneh , who regularly conducts public_opinion_polls on the peace process . Hussein is counting_on that personal popularity to win at least grudging acceptance of peace with Israel from most Jordanians , Hamarneh said . &quot; The whole_thing is based on the king ' s popularity , &quot; said the bearded professor , who said he supports signing a peace_treaty with Israel . &quot; In our subconscious , we know that we lost , that the Zionists won . So there is nothing joyous about ( the signing ceremony ) . For me and my peers , it was a noble cause , fighting for Jerusalem and for Palestine . And so there will be sadness tomorrow , because it is over. &quot; Hamarneh agreed with those who said that Hussein ' s thoughts of his mortality helped push him toward making_peace with Israel . More_than two years ago , the king , now 58 , was found to have cancer of the ureter . He was treated in the United States and has since been declared cancer-free . But in his addresses to the nation since then , he has seemed preoccupied with the prospect that he will soon pass from the scene . If the experience of surviving a life-threatening illness gave Hussein a new sense of urgency about the negotiations that began with Israel in October , 1991 , political developments surrounding the talks soon combined with a deteriorating economic situation inside Jordan to convince the king that the time had come_to act . In the summer of 1993 , Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization revealed that they had secretly negotiated a framework for Palestinian self-rule in the occupied West_Bank and Gaza Strip , outside the formal talks going on in Washington among Israel , the Arab states and the Palestinians . After years of quietly cooperating with successive Israeli governments to keep Palestinian nationalist aspirations in check , the king suddenly saw the PLO replacing him as Israel ' s partner , and doing_it in the open . On Sept . 14 , 1993 -- one day after the Israelis and the PLO signed their agreement on the White_House lawn granting limited self-rule to the Palestinians of the territories -- Jordan and Israel signed an agenda that served as the basis of today ' s treaty . At the time , most Jordanians believed a formal peace_treaty with Israel was probably still years away . Hussein had said repeatedly that Jordan would not sign a separate agreement but would wait for a &quot; comprehensive &quot; settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict . In essence , that meant that Jordan would wait until Syria -- its much more powerful northern neighbor -- was ready to sign a treaty . But Western diplomats and Jordanians say that Hussein decided in June , after talks with Clinton , that the time had come_to sign a treaty . &quot; People ask , ' Why now ? ' My immediate response is , why not now ? &quot; said Jordanian Information Minister Jawad Anani . &quot; You ' re going to see a new , proactive Jordan from now on , &quot; said Marwan Mouasher , spokesman for the Jordanian negotiating team . &quot; Jordan has always been a moderate state politically and has always had a market_economy , but it has not been able to make use of this fact in a turbulent region . This is a new era , where Jordan can finally take decisions that are based on Jordan ' s interests. &quot; Mouasher and other officials emphasized , however , the importance of the international community -- led by the United States -- responding to the peace_treaty by offering Jordan desperately needed aid . On the eve of Clinton ' s arrival here , Jordanian Information Minister Jawad Anani said flatly that he hopes the President will announce more U.S. aid for Jordan during his stay . So far , Washington has agreed to write_off Jordan ' s $ 700-million debt over a three-year period and to increase military cooperation .</TEXT>
