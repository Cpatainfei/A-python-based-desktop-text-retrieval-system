   <HEADLINE> BOUNTIFUL SALINAS VALLEY HAS BUMPER CROP OF WOES ; FARMS : PROBLEMS INCLUDE OVERPRODUCTION , SEAWATER INTRUSION . SOME PIN HOPES ON QUEST FOR TASTIER LETTUCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> People in these parts still think_of Floyd Griffin as a bit of an outsider , a Johnny-come-lately to the Kingdom of the Crispheads . He ' s only lived_in the Salad_Bowl of America since 1968 -- the kind of place where you sure can grow vegetables but you sure can ' t buy land . His &quot; recent &quot; arrival in itself is a minor black mark in this tight little fraternity of four-generation farm families . And then there ' s the way he feels about iceberg , the king of crops in the land of lettuce : He eats it . He likes it . But he ' s spending good money to change it . &quot; We ' re working toward taste , truly we are , &quot; promises the secretary-treasurer of Mission Packing , a multi-state farm firm that is using genetic_engineering to breed next-generation iceberg with the help of a major seed company from Holland . &quot; We ' re only a_couple_of years away. &quot; Too_bad they can ' t speed things up , for these are grim days in the Salinas Valley , site of the richest farmland in America . A yearlong iceberg glut has driven prices to historical lows . Frustrated farmers are willing to try most anything to improve their ailing market . In fact , when iceberg_lettuce turned 100 this year , the only party was in Pennsylvania , where seed giant W . Atlee Burpee &amp; Co . threw an August birthday bash complete with Creme de la Creme Iceberg Soup With Mint , and Light Iceberg Latkes With Chives . Lettuce growers here spent the summer grappling with overproduction that caused losses of up_to $ 1 # 500 an acre in a region that plants about 72 # 000 acres of iceberg each year . Now they ' re digging in_for the nastiest water war in California today , a battle that pits farmers against each other instead of their urban counterparts . The Salinas Valley water war is among the most crucial in California , says Edward C . Anton , chief of the division of water_rights at the state Water Resources Control_Board . And its current remedy is among the rarest : The state has just begun the lengthy process of stepping_in and taking_over . &quot; The Salinas Valley has a unique combination of climate and soil that allows it to produce a lot of very valuable produce , &quot; says Anton , who testified about the controversy last month at legislative hearings in the tiny Salinas Valley town of Spreckles . &quot; that ' s among the reasons why it ( water ) is such a concern. &quot; The water war threatens a 90-mile swath of farmland that is both bountiful and beautiful . Salinas native John Steinbeck took an entire chapter in &quot; East of Eden &quot; to describe the valley that gave him plots and poetry . &quot; I remember that the Gabilan Mountains to the east of the valley were light gay mountains full of sun and loveliness and a kind of invitation , so that you wanted to climb into their warm foothills almost as you want to climb into the lap of a beloved mother , &quot; he wrote in the 1952 novel . &quot; They were beckoning mountains with a brown grass love . The Santa Lucias stood_up against the sky to the west and kept the valley from the open sea , and they were dark and brooding -- unfriendly and dangerous. &quot; George Ball , Burpee chairman and chief_executive , is neither Nobel laureate nor California native , but he , too , finds it easy to muster_up a shred of the poet when he speaks_of the land that made his company ' s product a household name . While he might not speak_of &quot; brown grass love &quot; when contemplating the verdant swath from San Ardo in the south to Castroville in the north , he will rhapsodize about &quot; those beautiful , sharp , sunlit days &quot; that make the Salinas Valley the iceberg capital of the world . But iceberg is far from the only crop , as is easily seen at Art Manzoni ' s farms just outside of Greenfield , the self-proclaimed broccoli capital of the world . Manzoni has been growing crops in the southern Salinas Valley for 47 years , from his high_school days as the Carrot King of King City High to this , iceberg ' s centenary . Today , his fields are a constant patchwork of growth and cultivation . Climate , he says , is the Salinas Valley ' s secret weapon , the thing that lets him , his son and his brother plant spinach in chill November , iceberg seven months out of 12 and hardy broccoli all year ' round . &quot; When I was a junior in high_school , my dad gave me 15 acres of land here for Future Farmers of America , &quot; he said as he maneuvered his mud-splashed pickup through the fields . &quot; I gambled and grew carrots on the open market . I made $ 30 # 000 . In 1947 , that was a lot of money . It ' s still the talk_of the town. &quot; Today , however , is a different story . The $ 2 # 000-an-acre carrots of Manzoni ' s youth pale beside the $ 11 # 000-an-acre strawberries grown in Monterey County and the $ 11 # 000 an acre that lettuce can bring_in here in a good year -- a year unlike this last one . Monterey County -- basically the Salinas Valley , for there is little agriculture in the county outside the valley -- grossed $ 1.85 billion in agricultural receipts in 1993 , the most it has raked_in since early Spanish farmers began cultivating corn , wheat and sheep here in the late 1700s . Although three counties in the nation -- Fresno , Tulare and Kern -- brought_in more agricultural dollars last year than Monterey , the numbers are deceiving . Sure , Fresno County pulled_in $ 3.01 billion , about 60 % more_than Monterey . But it accomplished that feat on 1.23 million acres -- nearly five times the acreage of its agricultural neighbor to the west . The Salinas Valley grows more_than 50 % of the nation ' s share of five pricey vegetables : head_lettuce , artichokes , broccoli , cauliflower and leaf_lettuce . In short , says Gerry Willey , deputy Monterey County agricultural commissioner , Salinas Valley farmland is the most fruitful in the nation . But instead of making money on their lactuca_sativa this year , most farmers here and in the nation ' s seven other lettuce-growing states are losing_it -- up_to $ 1 # 500 an acre for most of the past 13 months , Willey says . &quot; You ' ve got_to have a certain character to grow lettuce , &quot; marvels Willey , who likens the lettuce field to the craps table and the stock_exchange . Lettuce farmers &quot; can make a lot of money . It ' s almost like Reno . You can go_in there and lose your shirt continually . Or you ' re just lucky. &quot; Or , as with many lettuce farmers this past year , you ' re actually part of the problem , unable as yet to manage the changes caused by the biggest agricultural innovation to hit the Salinas Valley since the ' 50s , the so-called &quot; value added product. &quot; You ' ve seen them take_up increasing shelf space in the produce section of your favorite market , those bright new bags of chopped and washed lettuce leaves -- some with dressing and croutons tossed_in -- for which harried urban shoppers are willing to pay extra . Dole Fresh Vegetables thinks such products are here to stay and has built a multimillion-dollar packaging plant in the Salinas Valley . Tanimura &amp; Antle , the biggest independent lettuce grower in the country , has a full line of products , from fresh spinach to Caesar_salad . And the latest Monterey County agricultural report notes that such products grew by more_than 50 % between 1992 and 1993 . But are they any good and will they last ? Most growers acknowledge that they smell sort of swampy when you open_up a bag , that they last maybe three days as opposed to three weeks . Bob Nunes , Jr. , whose family firm is just now building a processing plant on the East Coast to chop and pack their Tubby brand lettuce , says he and his wife , well , used to eat them . &quot; It was a phase , &quot; Nunes says . &quot; We don ' t do_it anymore. &quot; And then there ' s that little math problem that has dogged lettuce growers throughout the country for the past year . Instead of acknowledging that consumers eat a finite amount of lettuce and bagging some of their existing crop , they planted extra . Compounding the problem was perfect weather and an abundant harvest . What consumers haven ' t eaten , farmers have . It ' s called oversupply , and it hurts . Add_to that scenario the state of California stepping_in to solve what farmers insist is &quot; just a local water problem &quot; and you get a large group of very independent , very annoyed men and women in work boots stomping up and down the valley . At issue is seawater intrusion -- ocean water contaminating the underground water_supply . It was first noticed in 1944 in the north county city of Castroville , the artichoke capital of the country . Farmers and water districts in the Salinas Valley get their water by pumping it from the underground aquifer . Under normal circumstances , that water is replenished , generally by rain . By the 1960s , two dams had been built_in the south county to help replenish the aquifer . But since those dams were built , two things have happened to strain the underground water_supply . The population of the area ' s cities , from Salinas to Soledad , has grown . The greatest impact , however , has been the nearly 60 # 000 acres of new irrigated farmland -- most in the southern part of the county . As a result , more water has been pulled_out of the aquifer than has been replenished . The imbalance in pressure has caused seawater to be sucked into the aquifer in coastal Salinas Valley . Last year , seawater contamination was discovered within a mile of the city of Salinas . In its simplest form , the water fight can be looked_at as artichokes against the world . Farmers in Castroville -- home of the Giant Artichoke Restaurant with its artichoke quiche and artichoke soup -- have been most affected by the seawater intrusion . They are the ones who most want a series of costly remedies that farmers and residents throughout the county would be forced to pay_for . Says Pat Hopper , marketing director for the California Artichoke and Vegetable Growers Corp. , &quot; If this acreage goes_out , where will we go ? Your quality_of_life will go_down . We need the climate here to grow artichokes. &quot; In the south county , where farmers are 50 miles from the direct effects of the seawater , the feeling is that north county growers are reaping what they sowed , that the problem is not the south county ' s to suffer or solve . &quot; It turns_out that 97 % to 98 % of the seawater intrusion is directly related to the pumping in the exact vicinity ( where ) the saltwater intrusion is occurring , &quot; insists Ralph Riva , chairman of the Salinas Valley Water Coalition . &quot; I can ' t do much for them . They have to accept the responsibility and make the hard calls. &quot; Because they have endured but not solved the intrusion problem , Monterey County farmers are about to receive letters from the state water board telling them to get their records ready . The state is embarking_on the lengthy investigation that could precede an official weighing of interests and parceling_out of the ground_water supply . All bets are off on whether the state will actually go_through with such a severe process -- one that has been initiated but never before completed . In the interim , a small army of Salinas Valley lettuce breeders is working fast and furiously to improve the crop that drives the region ' s agricultural engine . People like Floyd Griffin ' s son , David , a genetic engineer , and Edward J . Ryder , the last of the great government lettuce breeders , are hard at_work on a hardier -- and tastier -- head . &quot; Certainly I would hope that ( seawater intrusion ) would not be so_much of a deterrent that we would willingly give_away the agricultural industry , &quot; says Ryder , a staunch iceberg defender . &quot; But the possibility of doing some breeding work to enable lettuce to grow even in a higher salt environment is a real one. &quot; The Billion-Dollar Club Based on the dollar value of the crops it produces , Monterey County is the No . 4 agricultural county in California , more_than a_billion dollars behind Fresno County , the nation ' s agricultural powerhouse . However , Monterey County has about 250 # 000 acres in production -- most in the Salinas Valley -- while Fresno has nearly five times that amount . That makes the Salinas Valley the richest farmland in the nation . This chart shows that state ' s top-grossing agricultural counties and the acreage in production .
