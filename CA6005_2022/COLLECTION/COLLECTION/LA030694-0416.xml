   <TEXT> As I stood over the putt , my caddie said : &quot; There ' s a little bump just before the hole . And , oh , by the way , don ' t take too long . I ' m wet , my feet hurt and I ' m starving. &quot; Needless to say , this wasn ' t a regular caddie with lots of experience . She was ( is ) my wife . Also , this wasn ' t my annual round at one of the Pinehurst , N.C. courses . Rather , it was at the Machrihanish Golf_Club , at the southern end of Scotland ' s Kintyre Peninsula . I ' d ended_up over that putt , watched by my wife , because I had convinced her it would be rewarding to spend a week in the Argyll and Isles region of the Western Highlands . Why the Argyll and Isles ? Partly because the area is so accessible from Glasgow , and my wife had just finished a conference there ; partly because of the area ' s scenic beauty , and partly because I reckoned it would be a modest-cost trip . Oh , and partly because it just happens to have 30 golf_courses . My intention was to construct an alternative to the high-priced guided tours of the great names in Scottish courses , such_as St . Andrews and Troon . These excursions obviously have a place in a serious golfer ' s experiences . But , they are hardly the way ordinary Scots , in their small_towns , take their beloved game . So , instead of an excursion , I wanted to golf the way the locals do : with frugality , easy access and a willingness to fit the game to what the terrain and local resources afford . I picked clubs that were accessible to the public . There would be no expansion clubhouses , no umbrella ' d verandas , no constricting golf_carts and cart paths . No , it would simply be : walk the round , carry the bag to the ball , pick a club and hit away . Just as the inventors of the game intended . The focus of our journey would be the Machrihanish Club , near Campbeltown . I had heard about this course during an earlier business trip to Scotland and vowed that I would play there . Getting_to Machrihanish and back in a week meant it was possible to play five or six other courses , several of them modest nine-hole designs that are known to fit imaginatively into their available terrain . Among those are Tarbert Golf_Club , Lochgilphead Golf_Club , and Inellan Golf_Club , near Dunoon . Their pars range_in the low 30s , but none are pushovers . In fact , at Lochgilphead Golf_Club the course record for 18 holes is only two under its par 64 . In this slice of Scotland , modest doesn ' t mean easy . These small village courses have one endearing feature : the honor_system . There is no pro shop , no caddiemaster or starter . The visitor is simply directed to place the green fee ( usually $ 7.50- $ 10.50 ) in a designated box with a slot in the top . So , our week-long tour would take us in a 400-mile loop from Glasgow , across the Firth of Clyde to the Island of Arran , thence to the Kintyre Peninsula . Next , a drive north would take us around the top of Loch Fyne , Scotland ' s largest lake , and down to Dunoon , on the Cowal Peninsula . Then , our route would go further south to the Isle of Bute , after which we ' d close the loop by recrossing the Firth of Clyde back to Glasgow . I picked_up our rental car , an English Rover compact sedan , last August in Glasgow . With our gear loaded , we consulted our map and set_out on Route A73 for the ferry terminal at Ardrossan , about 35 miles southwest of Glasgow . At Ardrossan our boarding of the ferry that makes the hour run to Brodick , on the Island of Arran , was a close_call . We ' d neglected to make a &quot; booking , &quot; and the waiting area was_full of cars whose owners had had more foresight . So , we had to queue in the somewhat forlorn &quot; wait list &quot; line . We got_on the one or two spaces to spare . The ferry holds about 80 cars and 800 passengers and has a snack_bar and lounge . Beyond us drivers , we observed lots of backpackers and bicyclists on board . Most were fitted with some kind of rainwear . A clue that they knew something we didn ' t ? Arran has been described as Scotland in miniature . In an area about 12 miles long and eight miles wide it has all_the features of the mainland : mountains , rocky coastlines , valleys and glens , lakes , farms and small villages . It also produces some of the finest wool sweaters in the world , which is why sheep are everywhere : in the fields , alongside the roads . Road-kill natural_selection evidently works . The unfenced survivors either grazed or reclined within inches of the road edges , blinking benignly as cars and trucks whizzed by . * We stayed in Brodick , the largest of several resort villages on the island , with a picturesque bay to the east . Across the bay is a clear view of 2 # 800-foot Goat Fell , the island ' s tallest mountain and frequent destination of climbers . A clear view , that is , when it isn ' t raining . The weather in mid-August proved highly changeable ; one minute clear skies , then dark clouds , then a misty rain , then clear again . This variability didn ' t seem to trouble the locals , so we decided it would n ' t trouble us either . On our first day in Brodick , I set_out for the nearby Brodick Golf_Club . My wife , who is an avid amateur photographer , explored Brodick Castle , the ancestral home for more_than 500 years of the Dukes of Hamilton . The course turned_out to be a medium-interest , somewhat flat bayside layout , wet from lots of rain . An engaging featureis that the first three holes , all par three , are in a field across the road from the clubhouse , completely separated from the rest of the course . These holes crisscross one another , so they can fit into the limited space . Not only that , parts of the fairways serve as a football_field . So , golfers sometimes have to make_way . I wondered , would my shriek of &quot; fore ! &quot; mean anything to a bunch of sweaty soccer players ? Luckily , there was no game in_progress when I teed_off . The next day , though , the three-par sector was closed and turned_over to the annual Brodick Highland Games . Bagpipe competitions , hammer_throws , caber tossing , foot_races , and tug of wars all proceeded apace . All this competition was limited to the &quot; Arran-born , &quot; with the homey touch that lots of contests were arranged for the children . Out on the remainder of the course , play sometimes adjusted for elderly dog-walkers , youthful horseback_riders , and individuals and families just out for a stroll . At the outset , this struck me as something of a nuisance . It didn ' t take long to realize , however , that it really was no big imposition . Golfing life and other leisure activities could coexist , and gentle tolerance for one another ' s needs marked a civilized way to spend a Scottish Sunday . Aye . Canny Scots ! Our hotel , the Arran , was in the three-point category ( under the Scottish Tourist Board ' s four-point rating_system ) . This meant it had most amenities , including an indoor pool . We had made reservations at hotels and guest houses listed in catalogues prepared by the Scottish Tourist Board , prefering the three-pointers at about $ 40 per person per night for bed and breakfast . And breakfasts were so substantial that we could skip lunches . As for dinner , at the Arran Hotel , the dining_room offered a good three-course dinner with a half-carafe of wine for about $ 18 . With genuinely friendly guests , smiling care by the staff and an enthusiastic proprietor , holding easygoing views about golf and world politics , it didn ' t take long to get comfortable . This experience proved to be the norm for the rest of our trip . The next day , while my wife pursued photo opportunities , I drove across the island to play_at a links-type course , the Shiskine Golf and Tennis_Club . Here , the terrain was generally left as wind , erosion , animals and other forces had shaped it . Apart from being transfixed by splendid views of Kilbrannan Sound and the Kintyre Peninsula to the west , the golfer confronts lots of uneven lies , wild dunes of unkempt rough and a dazzling array of blind shots . Shiskine ' s most unusual feature , though , is that it has only 12 holes , something unheard of in the States . Twelve tough holes were all that could be fitted into the available land . If that meant golfers had to repeat six of the holes to reach the full 18 , so be it . The golfing challenge of par 65 was none the less for that . The insouciance of this unusual layout was paralleled by that of the pro shop attendant . When I inquired the green fee and possible starting_time , the ruddy-faced Scotsman said , &quot; Aye . Nae problem . Aught pounds. &quot; Whereupon he put_down the glass of whisky he had been sipping , took my money and wrote my name down opposite 10:08 on the starting_time sheet . He pointed me toward the first tee , observing that &quot; yer second shot ' s oop o ' er tha ' tall fairway boonker . Th ' hole ' s hid beyont it. &quot; With that , he picked_up his glass and resumed sipping . * Early the next morning we had breakfast and then set_out on A841 around the western side of Arran to Lochranza , and a 30-minute ferry ride to the Kintyre Peninsula , whose southern end is about 18 miles from the coast of Northern_Ireland . Our destination was seaside Campbeltown , where we were to stay in an elegantly restored manor_house owned by two retired teachers . Getting there , however , involved another aspect of Scottish frugality -- the &quot; single track road with passing places , &quot; as the maps quaintly described it . These roads have enough room for only one vehicle , except every so often there ' s a wide spot where two can pass . Striped black-and-white poles mark these points . The local driving strategy seemed to be : Get_to a wide spot ; look ahead ; if nothing ' s coming , race like the wind to the next pole . It appeared to all work , since we didn ' t see any evidence of head-on crashes . Campbeltown is a resort and fishing village of 6 # 000 . At one time it had 34 whisky distilleries ; now there are two . Local lore has it that in the distilleries ' heyday the aroma from them was so strong that sailors could find their way back to port in dense fogs just by the smell . Campbeltown has seven hotels , a large_number of bed-and-breakfast houses , and several trailer ( caravan ) sites . It also has 13 pubs . My reason for coming_to Campbeltown , however , was not to imbibe . It was to play_at the Machrihanish Golf_Club , located a_few miles outside the village . This much-acclaimed course lies alongside Machrihanish Bay . It is flat , treeless , full of mounds and hollows , and left generally in the land ' s original contours . But it has been judged the equal of any of the more famous Scottish links courses , including the Old Course at St . Andrews . Legend has it that &quot; Old &quot; Tom Morris , who won the_British Open four times between 1861 and 1867 , declared that the land on which the course lies &quot; was designed by The Almighty for playing golf. &quot; I settled my green free_of about $ 20 and went_out to what has been described as one of the finest starting holes anywhere . It ' s a stalwart 423-yard par four that follows the gentle curve of Machrihanish Bay and is a challenge for the brave . But No . 1 also protects the innocent . Just below it , on the beach , is a sign , simple and direct , like much else in Scotland : &quot; DANGER . 1st Tee Above . Sitters Move Along Beach Clear of Golf Danger Area. &quot; Since I was alone , I teed_up and hit . ( My wife would meet me on No . 18. ) I could see a_few other players at the far reaches of the course , but I felt as if the whole wonderful place was mine alone . Machrihanish confirmed everything I ' d heard about it . I played in sunshine , wind , drizzle , and driving rain . The sandy soil quickly drained the downpours . The winds and rain called_for every kind of shotmaking : bump-and-runs , low knockdowns , fades and draws . The greens were in excellent shape , but with deep and sweeping undulations that made putting a world-class test . At 6 # 228 yards the course was not long . The front nine has only one par three ; the back nine has three , along with two par fives . But even so , it was all serious golfing work to stay within its par-70 reach . Needless to say , I didn ' t . On one hole I teed_off into a deluge , sensing I ' d hit the ball dead , solid , perfect . I never found it . I blamed my fogged-up glasses . From Campbeltown , we drove_back up A83 on the peninsula ' s western coast . Each turn_in the highway gave another spectacular view of sea , mountains , and ever-changing clouds and skies . We stopped overnight in the small_town of Tarbert perched between West Tarbert Loch and Loch Fyne . Our hotel , the Columba , was right on Tarbert ' s busy harbor and just a short walk from the compact town center . Costs in Tarbert were about the same as in Brodick . My golfing target was the Tarbert Golf_Club , a hilly , tough little nine-hole course . The green fee here was $ 7.50. I sloshed_around in many strokes over the par 33 , but despite my sorry score , I was taken with the splendid views from holes that worked_up and down and along some quite steep hillsides . From Tarbert we drove further along the A83 toward the top of Loch Fyne to the resort town of Lochgolphead , where I played another nine-holer , the Lochgilphead Golf_Club . * From Lochgilphead , our route on A83 took us around the top of Loch Fyne , past Inveraray . Here is Inveraray Castle , home of the Duke of Argyll and traditional head of the Campbell Clan , one of the most powerful families for better than 700 years of Scottish history . We then turned south to follow A815 along the eastern shore of Loch Fyne and then Loch Eck to our destination in Dunoon . I intended to play_at the Cowal Golf_Club in Dunoon . But heavy rains had closed the course . With Cowal rained_out , I substituted Inellan Golf_Club , about four miles south . The final stop on our tour was the resort and fishing village of Rothesay on the Isle of Bute . This entailed one more jaw-clenching drive over the dreaded &quot; single-tracker &quot; to reach the ferry that crosses the Kyles ( a narrow inlet ) of Bute at Colintrave . The short ride let us out on A886 and , thence , for about 12 miles into the charming town . Five hundred years ago , Scotland ' s ruling dynasty picked Rothesay as a hunting and vacation_spot . The partly restored Rothesay Castle testifies to their presence . An active harbor , a conventional tourist strand and well-gardened esplanade serve the frequent day-trippers and conducted-tour vacationers . My golfing target here was the Rothesay Golf_Club , founded in 1892 . This course overlooks Rothesay Bay and the Firth of Clyde . Overlooks , that is , once you reclaim your breath after climbing several hundred feet in elevation in_order to complete the four-par , 251-yard first hole . From this hilltop are magnificent views of the Cowal Peninsula , Firth of Clyde , Arran , the Cumbrae Islands to the east , and beyond them the Ayrshire Coast . I joined two local club_members in my round . They evidently played every day and traveled light : a_few , well-worn clubs , small bags and some rain gear . We played each hole in about six minutes , except when I slowed things down with a lost ball and a snapshot on No . 8 tee . Why No . 8 ? It was one of the flamboyant American golfer Walter Hagen ' s favorites . According to the pro shop attendant , at some time during one of Hagen ' s visits to the United Kingdom , he decided to play the course . When he got_to No . 8 , he assessed the challenge of the severe downhill , 204-yard par three , with little fairway and pronounced slopes from left-to-right feeding off into a similarly-sloped green . He turned_to take_in the broad scene of water , sky , hills , fields , houses , and then back to the hole and said : &quot; If God gave me one last hole to play , this would be it. &quot; We ended our week with an early-morning 30-minute ferry ride to Wemyss Bay and then about a 50-mile drive on A78 and M-8 straight to Glasgow Airport . The airport , albeit an international hub , is modest in scale and uncongested . Our cost for two people for this eight days and about 400 miles of driving ? Excluding airfares , lodgings came_to $ 549 for double rooms , bed and breakfast ; other meals $ 168 ; golf ( for me ) $ 88 ; car rental $ 454 ; gas $ 64 ; ferry charges $ 118 . Total : $ 1 # 441 . All costs included the U.K. ' s 17 % Value Added Tax ( VAT ) , and with a rate_of_exchange at 1 to $ 1.50. Scotland left many marks on us . I saw the other side of Scottish golfing life that I ' d wondered about . Beyond that , Scotland ' s scenic grandeur and the openness and charm of its people drew us in . My wife remarked on one moment of particular meaning . As she was walking along a back_street high above Brodick , she heard a faint bagpipe melody . The sounds came from a band marching to the day ' s Highland Games from the ferry pier . Out of sight , but with the colorful vista of Brodick Bay before her , the band ' s plaintive tune marked something poignant and touching . In its innocent way , that song encircled the gentle admonition we had seen on a sign beside the road as we were leaving Tarbert : &quot; Haste Ye Back. &quot; And so we shall .
