   <HEADLINE> ENERGY OF SALONEN , L.A. PHILHARMONIC WINS_OVER N.Y. ; MUSIC : THE ORCHESTRA RECEIVES CHEERING AUDIENCES AND FAVORABLE REVIEWS ON ITS FIRST VISIT SINCE ESA-PEKKA SALONEN BECAME MUSIC_DIRECTOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I ' m here to see what all_the fuss is about , &quot; a member of the New York Philharmonic staff said Monday night as she entered Avery Fisher Hall to hear the Los Angeles Philharmonic perform under Esa-Pekka Salonen . She was not alone . Indeed , New York made a genuine fuss over the Los Angeles Philharmonic ' s first tour here since Salonen became music_director two seasons ago . Its programs Sunday afternoon and Monday at Lincoln Center had large , exuberantly cheering audiences . The power-mongers of New York ' s musical community were there , a couple from competing institutions looking fairly unhappy . Salonen was feted by the Finnish consulate , and his record company , Sony , introduced him to the local press at a lavish sushi lunch in a glamorous setting high atop its landmark building . And , at all_of these events , the same remark was heard over and over : &quot; Do you believe the New York Times piece ? &quot; Last Sunday Salonen and the Philharmonic won cultural New York ' s most_desirable piece of journalistic real_estate -- the front-page lead feature in the Arts &amp; Leisure section of the New York Times . But , more_than that , the headline read &quot; Becoming the Next Bernstein ? ( Or Boulez ? ) , &quot; and above it was a large color picture of Leonard Bernstein conducting , late in his life , with a smaller insert of Salonen rehearsing in his Izod polo_shirt . As any streetwise New York music_lover will insist , it is simply not possible to combine the charisma that Bernstein exerted over audiences here with the audience-discouraging contemporary music advocacy Pierre Boulez displayed when he succeeded Bernstein as music_director of the New York Philharmonic . Alex Ross ' rosy feature_article , however , implied that just such an unbelievable miracle is taking_place in Los Angeles . Such comparisons always have their dangerous side here , where one writer ' s acclaim will prompt others to counteract perceived puffery . But , while none of the first reviews to appear has gone so far as_to concede that Bernstein has been reborn as a Boulez , the critical response has been glowing , nonetheless , with energy and energized being the operative words . Reviewing both programs ( which , except for one Beethoven overture , remained in the 20th Century ) for the Times , Allan Kozinn wrote that the orchestra &quot; responded with a_level of energy and excitement that one hears too rarely at orchestral performances. &quot; Kozinn found that Bartok ' s Concerto for Orchestra concluding Sunday ' s program ( which also included Schoenberg ' s Five Pieces for Orchestra and Ravel ' s Piano Concerto in G , with Olli Mustonen as soloist ) &quot; the most breathtaking of the orchestra ' s performances &quot; but thought that its playing of Lutoslawski ' s Fourth Symphony , a New York premiere , came_close . &quot; Both works were given taut , suitably virtuosic readings , but more interestingly , the performances had a transparency that illuminated subsidiary musical lines and clarified structural details , &quot; he wrote . Similar praise came from Anthony Tommasini in New York Newsday who contended that &quot; energized by Salonen ' s arresting conception of the ( Lutoslawski ) , the orchestra played with purposefulness and communicative power. &quot; Shirley Fleming in the New York Post summed_up the Lutoslawski as a work whose &quot; prevailing spirit is one of almost unremitting intensity , &quot; and she found that &quot; Salonen and his orchestra consumed it , massive outbursts and all. &quot; More controversial was Salonen ' s performance of Sibelius ' Second Symphony , which closed Monday ' s program , although certainly not with the audience , which gave what surely must be the most ecstatic ovation to an orchestral concert here all season . Tommasini found the Sibelius &quot; clearheaded and illuminating , &quot; for him the passion and sweep was always at the service of structure . Kozinn , on the other hand , thought that , on this occasion , &quot; in his quest_for expansive tempos and a big , thrilling sound , Mr. Salonen sacrificed some of the drama that should enliven the work ' s first and last movements. &quot; In the minority , dissenting camp , was Sedgwick Clark , the influential editor of the annual directory Musical America and one of the more outspoken and passionate longtime observers of the New York music scene . He left the concert calling Salonen ' s interpretation of Sibelius &quot; stodgy and shapeless , the way I find all_of the symphonic conducting I ' ve heard him do . He has no vision of the final page. &quot; But even Clark said he was &quot; very , very impressed with the Lutoslawski , &quot; and in it , as well as in an encore from Sibelius ' &quot; Lemminkainen &quot; Suite , he thought the orchestra played &quot; smashingly , with everything under control. &quot; The Los Angeles Philharmonic has played beautifully in New York before , under both Carlo Maria Giulini and Andre Previn , as Kozinn reminded readers in his review . But clearly the orchestra has achieved a swift and remarkable image change with this tour . Some of that may be_due to lucky timing -- the New York season has been somewhat lackluster thus far . And there are still the reviews in the weekly publications to weigh in . Moreover , it remains to be seen how well the Los Angeles Philharmonic will be remembered at season ' s end , since such great orchestras as Cleveland , the Concert-gebouw , the London Symphony and the Vienna Philharmonic are_on their way with significant offerings . But , for the moment , Los Angeles and Salonen are the musical talk_of a town that probably respects energy more_than any other quality , and their return next year to Lincoln Center is already eagerly anticipated .</TEXT>
