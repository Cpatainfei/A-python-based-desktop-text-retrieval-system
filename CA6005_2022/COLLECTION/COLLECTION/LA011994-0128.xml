   <HEADLINE> EARNINGS : CHRYSLER ANNOUNCES RECORD QUARTERLY PROFIT OF $ 777 MILLION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chrysler Corp. , adding an exclamation_point to the resurgence of the U.S. automobile_industry , reported record fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday , as vehicle sales soared and operating_costs declined . The company , which was_on the brink of bankruptcy four years ago , reported net_income of $ 777 million for the last three months of 1993 . Before taxes and special charges , Chrysler earned $ 3.8 billion in 1993 . &quot; It was an exceptional year , &quot; Chairman Robert Eaton said . Chrysler is the smallest of the Big Three but also the hottest . Its market share is now nearly 15 % -- the highest proportion in 23 years . The company was the star of the recent auto show in Detroit , where it unveiled several new models . The U.S. auto industry is emerging as the world ' s strongest . The restructuring of the last few years is beginning to pay_off with improved product quality and world-class manufacturing efficiency , factors that are showing_up on the bottom_line . Chrysler ' s fourth-quarter earnings translate into $ 2.11 a share , far more_than Wall_Street ' s consensus estimate of $ 1.61 a share . The company earned $ 1.12 a share , or $ 356 million , in the equivalent period of 1992 . While Chrysler had a net loss of $ 2.6 billion , or $ 7.62 a share , in 1993 , that reflected accounting charges of $ 4.7 billion for retirees ' medical benefits and $ 283 million for post-employment benefits . Chrysler earned $ 2.4 billion , or $ 6.77 a share , without the accounting charges . In 1992 , it earned $ 723 million , or $ 2.21 a share . &quot; They are phenomenal earnings , &quot; said Maryann Keller , an analyst for Furman Selz of New York . &quot; Part of it is product-related and part of it is the economy. &quot; Chrysler rose 75 cents , to an all-time high of $ 62.50 a share , on the New York Stock_Exchange . With revenue of $ 43.6 billion , the company sold 19 % more vehicles last year than in 1992 . Sales of minivans , LH mid-size sedans and Dodge Ram pickups were particularly strong . It has high hopes for new 1994 models aimed at import buyers : the low-priced Neon , the Cirrus and Dodge Stratus . With sales up , Chrysler ' s profit_margins have improved sharply . The company said its pretax earnings per car was $ 1 # 335 in 1993 , compared to $ 325 in 1992 . In the fourth-quarter , its profit_margin was $ 1 # 727 . The main reason for the higher profit was lower cash rebates and other enticements given to buyers . The average incentive per car was $ 650 in the last_quarter , compared to $ 1 # 020 a year ago . Incentives are likely to drop further if the economy remains strong and consumers stay in a buying mood . Chrysler can also keep rebates to a minimum on new products coming_to showrooms . Unlike Ford and General Motors , Chrysler has not been a major force internationally . But that may change in the coming years as it makes a push to export popular models to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region . Last year , Chrysler ' s international sales totaled 105 # 849 vehicles , up 45 % from 1992 . In Europe , it sold nearly 61 # 000 vehicles and could top 100 # 000 this year . Chrysler also is trying to improve its quality rankings . Company officials acknowledge that this is their No . 1 priority .</TEXT>
