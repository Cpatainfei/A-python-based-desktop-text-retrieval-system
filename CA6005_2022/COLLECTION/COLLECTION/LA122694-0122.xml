   <HEADLINE> TV ' S ' YOU LIKE ME , YOU REALLY LIKE ME ' FACTOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The biggest new hit on television , &quot; ER , &quot; does not have a single major household name in its regular cast . TV ' s Tim Allen was a relative unknown before &quot; Home Improvement , &quot; except on the comedy circuit . Same for Roseanne . Same for Jerry Seinfeld . Same for Brett Butler . Television has a history of creating its own stars , and coming from motion_pictures is rarely a qualification . The few onetime film headliners succeeding in television today include Candice Bergen of &quot; Murphy Brown , &quot; Angela Lansbury of &quot; Murder , She Wrote , &quot; Chuck Norris of &quot; Walker , Texas_Ranger &quot; and Sam Waterston of &quot; Law &amp; Order. &quot; Veteran executives and producers Aaron Spelling , Grant Tinker and Fred Silverman , say performer likability and comfort are all-important requirements for television stardom . But several younger executives , ABC Entertainment President Ted Harbert and his NBC counterpart , Warren Littlefield , think other significant factors have come_into play . Roseanne , for instance , may_not be all that likable or a comfortable refuge to many viewers , but her outstanding series , Harbert notes , has &quot; relatability . There ' s a ton of people out there she really talks to. &quot; It ' s an edgier era , from sensational newscasts to tougher entertainment series . Even commercials , such_as the slashing rivalry between AT &amp; T and MCI , have that edge ; and &quot; Roseanne &quot; fittingly broke ground in depicting blue-collar worries over money and other social matters . While Harbert thinks &quot; relatability &quot; is critical for such current stars as Roseanne and Butler , Littlefield adds that the proliferation of TV alternatives also makes_it important &quot; to look_for a uniqueness &quot; in performers . &quot; The best way to describe it , &quot; he says , &quot; is a signature style , a presence , that makes performers stand_out . Jerry Seinfeld brings that . So does Tim Allen . &quot; Once upon a time , TV was thought of as a baby-sitter , and comfort was a key ingredient . Today , I think it ' s distinctiveness and originality ( that make the difference ) because of the many choices. &quot; * The difficulty of succeeding in today ' s TV competition , even if you ' re a top movie figure , was made apparent again Sunday when Woody Allen , whose new film &quot; Bullets Over Broadway , &quot; is getting raves , appeared in an ABC remake of his play , &quot; Don ' t Drink the Water , &quot; and it finished 85th among 96 network shows last week . While reality TV series and a loss of innocence -- this is hardly the age of &quot; Father Knows Best &quot; or even &quot; The Cosby Show &quot; -- have sharply changed the tone of TV , there are certain constants in the creation of television_stars . And those constants , which include likability perhaps above all , become obvious when you scan the ratings and network lineups and see all_the home-grown headliners . Many , of course , including Robin Williams , Danny DeVito and Bruce Willis , have gone_on to films , but the TV factory keeps churning_out what it hopes are hot new faces with its special chemistry . &quot; What we are aware of , &quot; says Littlefield , &quot; is that an unknown is your biggest upside . You can fail , but I don ' t think there ' s anything as powerful for a TV_audience as discovering an unknown and making him or her into a star . It ' s a very personal discovery , and you can ' t get that with established stars. &quot; Spelling , whose company produces the &quot; Beverly Hills , 90210 &quot; and &quot; Melrose Place &quot; series , says , &quot; A TV_star has to come_into your bedroom , your kitchen . . . . Is the audience comfortable with that person in your bedroom ? You ' re divorced when you go_to a movie -- you see the stars and you like them or you don ' t . But seeing somebody in two movies a year is different from seeing somebody 26 or 34 weeks a year . &quot; In all_the research we do , we don ' t ask : ' Tell us if you liked him in the show. ' We ask : ' Do you like him or her ? ' &quot; * Says Tinker , former head of NBC and MTM Enterprises : &quot; I think likability is very high up there . I remember when it came_down to two finalists to host ' The Hollywood Squares. ' Dan Rowan was one and Peter Marshall was the other . Rowan did_it perfectly . Marshall made more mistakes , but he was just so likable and human making the mistakes that we gave him the job. &quot; Tinker and Silverman -- who ran programming at ABC , CBS and NBC -- say that the number of movie_stars who succeeded big in a television series is comparatively small . &quot; I think the crossover is easier for TV_stars than movie_stars , &quot; says Spelling . Among the latest to try are David Caruso , formerly of &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; and Rob Morrow of &quot; Northern Exposure. &quot; However , Caruso ' s replacement in &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; Jimmy Smits , was a star in television ' s &quot; L.A. Law &quot; but didn ' t break_through in a major way in his film attempts . Movie_stars , Silverman maintains , are usually popular_with an audience that is smaller than &quot; what we think_of ( as large ) in television . that ' s why a lot of movie_stars don ' t draw flies ( on TV ) . &quot; I think it ' s much easier for a broad-based TV_star like Tim Allen ( whose film ' The Santa Clause ' is a smash ) to score in a movie than for a movie_star to score in television . There are some exceptions . Clint Eastwood would probably draw a very large television audience . And probably Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks . But I don ' t know whether Charlie Sheen and his brother ( Emilio Estevez ) would draw . &quot; Arnold Schwarzenegger could be in the Top 10 ( TV series ) tomorrow in an action show . Danny DeVito ( formerly of ' Taxi ' ) could come back. &quot; Silverman adds that &quot; Candice Bergen surprised a lot of people , but it was just the perfect marriage of performer and character. &quot; And he predicts that &quot; Tim Allen in four or five years would never consider doing another television_show , &quot; what with top movie_stars getting astonishing multimillion-dollar salaries . No matter . There ' s always someone waiting in the wings . Says Steve Warner , senior_vice_president of program planning for CBS : &quot; What does attract people to television is the freshness of the faces. &quot; True . that ' s certainly the case with shows like the freshly minted &quot; ER. &quot; But , alas , there are those other fine TV attractions as well , like the creepy daytime talk_shows where the human_race seems to sink to its deepest depths , and where likability and comfort seem like words from a distant , civilized planet .</TEXT>
