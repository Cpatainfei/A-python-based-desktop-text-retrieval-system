   <HEADLINE> SCREENING ROOM : ' MUSTANG ' EXAMINES THE TIBETAN PLIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tony Miller ' s beautiful and stirring documentary &quot; Mustang : The Hidden Kingdom &quot; ( at the Sunset 5 , starting Wednesday at 12:45 p.m. daily for one week only ) follows the Dalai Lama ' s elderly emissary , Rinpoche Khampuet , and his small entourage on an arduous journey in the summer of 1993 . They travel from Dharamsala , India , site of the Tibetan government-in-exile , to Lo Manthang , the capital of Mustang , a tiny Himalayan kingdom geographically and culturally part of Tibet but long under the jurisdiction of Nepal , which until recently had sealed its border under pressure from China , effectively cutting it off from the world . The gentle Rinpoche ' s mission is to re-establish ties with this medieval country , a veritable but primitive Shangri-La , the one place where authentic Tibetan ways have continued undisturbed , yet are endangered due_to a shortage of teachers to preserve literacy . While offering a message of tentative hope the film ' s narrator , Harrison Ford , points_out that Mustang may yet be engulfed by Nepalese Hindu nationalism . This fine documentary is but the latest to call attention to the terrible and ongoing plight of Tibet , where under decades of genocidal Chinese rule , 1 million of its 6 million citizens have been killed , almost all_of its 6 # 000 monasteries destroyed , its rivers polluted and its unique animal species brought close to extinction . The documentary will premiere on the Discovery Channel on Sept . 11 at 9 p.m. Information : ( 213 ) 848-3500 . The Monica 4-Plex ' s Hong Kong series continues Wednesday with a one-week run of Tsui Hark ' s rousing , gorgeous-looking &quot; Once Upon a Time in China III &quot; ( 1993 ) , in which martial_arts star Jet Lee returns as Wong Fei Hong , an actual turn-of-the-century Cantonese surgeon and proponent for Chinese independence who in the series emerges as a folk hero of legendary kung_fu skills . We ' re now in the early 20th Century , with the Russo-Japanese War looming and the Empress Dowager calling_for a martial_arts competition to instill a nationalist spirit in the face of extensive foreign incursions . The plot proceeds along two parallel lines : Wong tackles a local Beijing martial_arts team determined to keep him and his teammates from competing , and he finds himself resenting the attentions of a young Russian officer ( John Wakefield ) toward a beautiful relative by marriage , Aunt Yee ( Rosamund Kwan ) , with whom he has fallen_in_love . A superb period_piece shot on location in Beijing , &quot; III &quot; is more elaborate than its predecessors but not as coherent ; its political subtext , involving the Empress ' role in the Russo-Japanese War , is none too clear . Even so , martial_arts fans shouldn ' t be disappointed . Information : ( 310 ) 394-9741 . The Nuart is reviving on Friday for a six-day run &quot; The Queen , &quot; Frank Simon ' s graceful and compassionate 1968 documentary that offers a behind-the-scenes look_at a national drag contest , held_in Manhattan ' s Town_Hall . It ' s a lively mix of humor , bitchiness and all but hair-pulling competitiveness and ego . Playing with it is Ellen Turk ' s and Andrew Weeks ' fascinating &quot; Split -- William to International Chrysis : Portrait of a Drag Queen , &quot; which introduces us to one of New York ' s fabled gender-benders , a poor Brooklyn gay kid ( glimpsed in &quot; The Queen &quot; ) who via hormones and silicone -- but not transsexual surgery -- transformed himself into a lush beauty who became a cabaret performer , sometime call_girl and a fascination of Salvador Dali . Information : ( 310 ) 478-6379 . The New Beverly Cinema will be presenting on Friday and Saturday an Orson Welles thriller double_feature , &quot; Touch of Evil &quot; ( 1958 ) and &quot; Lady from Shanghai &quot; ( 1948 ) . Information : ( 213 ) 938-4038 .</TEXT>
