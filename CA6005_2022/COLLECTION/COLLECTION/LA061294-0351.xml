   <HEADLINE> FOR MULTIMEDIA ' S EMERGING SUPERSTARS , ARE HOLLYWOOD TALENT_AGENTS . . . ; THE 10 % SOLUTION ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When International Creative Management agents Bill Block and Steve Stanford arrived_at the Medford , Ore. , airport last month to find a white limousine awaiting them , they were mortified . Expensive cars are not generally a source of anxiety for talent_agents . But the only reason Block and Stanford had ventured a visit to the depressed logging town was to persuade the ponytailed computer_game programmers at Trilobyte , a start-up multimedia firm housed in an old schoolhouse , to let ICM represent them . They feared the customary limo might be , well , inappropriate . Hollywood agents want a cut of the multimedia revolution . But to get_it , they must breach a cultural gap as wide as the distance from Sunset Boulevard to the information superhighway . Most of the software developers and techno-entrepreneurs who are pioneering new forms of interactive entertainment have never had an agent -- and aren ' t at all sure they want one now . Ten percent of the deal -- the agent ' s traditional fee -- seems rather costly to many start-ups working_out of their kitchens . And if your idea of a star is Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates , an agent isn ' t the obvious key to fame and fortune . &quot; You don ' t hear a lot of positive stuff about them , &quot; observes Rand Miller , co-creator with his brother , Robyn , of the popular CD-ROM game &quot; Myst. &quot; Still , each of the major agencies has set_up &quot; interactive &quot; teams to seek_out deals in the new arena , and each has had some success . They were_on the job at the annual Digital World conference in Los Angeles last week , schmoozing with people who often looked_like they ' d rather be reading their electronic_mail . ICM chief Jeff Berg was_on a keynote panel . The Agency for the Performing Arts even held a news_conference to announce it had signed Greg Roach of HyperBole Studios , a CD-ROM developer in Bellevue , Wash . But as the agencies jockey for multimedia domination , the main battle turns_out to be not so_much persuading prospective clients that they can cut a better deal than the others as persuading them that agents really do serve a useful function in life . Really . &quot; People definitely have preconceived notions about agents , &quot; concedes ICM ' s Stanford , whose previous work in the computer_industry lends him more credibility than most in the eyes of the programming community . &quot; It comes from a lack of understanding of what we do -- that we ' re on their side , we ' re the guys who fight for them. &quot; Or , as William Morris ' Lee Rosenberg puts it : &quot; They need to understand that we add value. &quot; Agents argue that their traditional role as catalysts -- bringing people together to package deals -- is essential in an industry as amorphous as new media , where no one is quite sure who is right for which job , or where to find them . Programmers , they note , often fancy themselves &quot; artists &quot; and can be just as temperamental and in need of ego-stroking as any Hollywood client -- though Rosenberg says they &quot; probably need less hand-holding. &quot; Indeed , as the industry evolves , some new media mavens concede that agents may unavoidably have a role to play . But for now , the agents frequently find themselves running_up against what one calls multimedia ' s &quot; carpetbagger reaction &quot; to their advances . Hence the ironically self-conscious attention to details such_as cars and clothes . &quot; They leave their Armani suits in the closet when they come_up here , &quot; says Drew Hoffman , a CD-ROM developer in San Francisco . &quot; They wear their ' new-media wardrobe ' -- Gap shirts and slacks. &quot; As it turned_out , it wasn ' t the ICM visitors ' vehicle that most annoyed Trilobyte co-founder Graeme Devine , recent winner of New Media magazine ' s Programmer of the Year award for the CD-ROM title &quot; 7th Guest. &quot; Devine is a dedicated comic_book reader who moved his family to the mountains of southern Oregon to escape Southern California ' s frenetic pace and high cost_of_living . And he had trouble relating to Block , who is known as a particularly relentless Type_A in a profession that measures aggression on a scale far transcending that of normal mortals . For one thing , says Devine , he ignored a request to stay away while the 25-person Trilobyte team was in the midst of finishing its second title . For another , &quot; he ' s a different breed of human , &quot; Devine says . &quot; I really believe it ' s not an act with him . that ' s the way he is . He might as well be from a different planet for all we have in common. &quot; It ' s not that Trilobyte won ' t use ICM ' s services . It ' s just that Devine expects ICM ' s clients to pay_for the privilege -- not the other way around . His logic : The advances in technology that have so vastly expanded the market for computer software by making_it possible to incorporate video , high-quality audio and sophisticated graphics have also opened_up a new market for traditional Hollywood writers , actors and musicians . Devine and many other developers see themselves more as studio chiefs than as artists needing to be marketed . &quot; They came_to our door ; we didn ' t go_to theirs , &quot; Devine says . &quot; So if we ' d like to use the voice of Patrick Stewart or someone , we ' ll call them -- but we don ' t want to pay the 10 % . They wanted to represent Trilobyte . We said , ' We want it to go the other way . we ' ll call you. ' &quot; &quot; 7th Guest &quot; cost $ 466 # 000 to make , sold 1 million copies and so far has recorded retail sales of about $ 45 million . Those numbers -- for a game that , not unlike a movie , employed a screenwriter , a director and several actors -- are what make the agents salivate . They ' re also what make CD-ROM developers wary of people who claim they can &quot; add value. &quot; &quot; If you are calling to discuss some great idea you have_on how you can make money with our product , please press five now , &quot; recites the voice mail recording at Id Software , the Mesquite , Tex.-based creators of another popular CD-ROM game called &quot; Doom. &quot; Yet Id Chief_Executive Jay Wilbur says ICM ' s dynamic duo -- Block and Stanford have covered a lot of ground -- knocked_down a_few of his stereotypes : &quot; They weren ' t sipping on Perrier when they walked in the door , and their cellular . . . phones were at least in their pockets . They didn ' t even say ' babe ' a lot. &quot; Wilbur ' s ideas for the merchandising of &quot; Doom &quot; range from a movie version of the game to mouse pads and Doom GI Joe action figures . Talent_agents , he concedes , might be able to strike better deals than he can . But at_the_same_time , &quot; 10 % is a hard pill to swallow . It ' s not like we ' re a one-man shop . We ' re a well-oiled , 10-person machine , and we have someone whose job it is to oversee these opportunities. &quot; That attitude gets_to the heart of why multimedia firms have proven such a hard_sell for agents . The stars of high-technology have traditionally been born in dorm-room obscurity and risen to greatness by building their companies ' stock value . So , unlike some Hollywood creative types who depend_on agents to handle their business arrangements , would-be tech phenoms see business acumen and deal making as part of the job . And despite the much-talked-of &quot; convergence &quot; with Hollywood , most multimedia entrepreneurs are following that Silicon_Valley model . &quot; Most of the artists in the new-technology area are not looking_for employment by others at the highest possible price , which is what agents are so good at finding for their clients , &quot; notes Stan Coleman , an attorney specializing in multimedia at Beverly Hills-based Weissmann , Wolff , Bergman , Coleman &amp; Silverman . &quot; Bill Gates is the archetype , not Steven Spielberg. &quot; All is not lost , though . Spielberg ' s agent , Creative Artists Agency chief Michael Ovitz , has also been hanging_out with Gates lately , when he ' s not discussing deals with companies like AT &amp; T . Microsoft and AT &amp; T are in a slightly different category from start-up CD-ROM developers , and CAA ' s recent talks with the two Fortune 500 firms reflect the agency ' s strategy for multimedia : Concentrate_on the bigger strategic alliances between entertainment and technology firms . Indeed , the rivalry between CAA , ICM , William Morris and the smaller agencies has taken a new form in a field where everyone is starting from ground zero and long-held strengths may_not apply . &quot; It has been difficult for a lot of the agencies to find the innovators in this area , because their network of sources isn ' t as sophisticated as it is in the other mediums , &quot; says Hollywood-Silicon Valley crossover Mike Bacches , who co-wrote the &quot; Rising Sun &quot; screenplay and is a founder of Palo Alto start-up Rocket Science Games . &quot; A few really smart agents have done really well , but the rest of the pack isn ' t even around the first turn yet. &quot; ICM chief Berg , who has been featured in the ultra-hip magazine Wired and plans to open an office in San Francisco , has been carefully building an image for ICM as the &quot; interactive agency. &quot; In a recent interview , Berg ' s comments on how the agency is &quot; platform agnostic &quot; and on the lucrative potential of Hughes satellites as an alternative to cable TV were punctuated by phone_calls involving Julia Roberts ' latest deal with Warner Bros . The firm recently orchestrated a deal between Random House , Broderbund Software and Theodore Geisel ' s widow for the electronic rights to the Dr. Seuss books . William Morris has kept a lower profile , although it is working with several multimedia firms in New York and Los Angeles . The agency put_together a video-game deal for the comic team Penn &amp; Teller , for instance , that is expected to be released this winter . CAA is working_on deals that would create ways to link some of its clients who have expressed interest in interactive projects -- John Singleton , Oliver Stone and Francis Ford Coppola among them -- into the technology world . Unlike William Morris and ICM , the agency appears less interested in representing a large stable of small start-ups . &quot; We ' ve always kept a very small client list in every area of the agency , &quot; says Dan Adler , CAA ' s point_man on new media . &quot; We don ' t intend to sign hundreds of young developers and see which become successful . When we work with developers , we ' ll look_for people we believe are making a difference in the landscape and help them reach their goals. &quot; One reason may be that there ' s not a whole_lot of money in interactive deals at the moment . Video_games are a $ 6-billion-a-year business , but the bulk of that is still in cartridge games , which do not hold the sophisticated graphics of CD-ROM software . &quot; We don ' t go_to Spago or the Ivy with these guys , &quot; concedes Louis Henderson , a member of William Morris ' new-media team . The actors and directors who have ventured into multimedia productions have done so either out of personal interest in the trendy world of interactivity or a lack of more lucrative job offers in TV and film ; stock_options are not an unusual form of payment for both the talent and their agents . Still , Berg , along with other industry_analysts , believes the interactive software business will become big enough to warrant an investment in time and labor now . &quot; We ' re looking_to broaden this end of the agency , &quot; he said . &quot; We think a significant part of our future representation base will be people who work in the software development and digital creation area. &quot; Will ICM win the business ? With developers who don ' t know the difference , &quot; it ' s a lot of times just a matter of who gets there first , &quot; one agent says . &quot; Creative Artists ? The name doesn ' t mean a whole_lot to me , &quot; says Chris Brandkamp , who spearheaded the recent search for an agent at the Miller brothers ' firm , Cyan . They want &quot; Myst &quot; turned_into a movie , and recently signed with Harvey Harrison of the Jim Preminger Agency ( &quot; Does everybody know Harvey ? Is he a pretty well-known guy down there ? &quot; Brandkamp wants to know ) in part because they failed to make_it through the bureaucracy of the better-known firms . &quot; It was like , ' Who do you know ? Nobody ? OK , bye , ' &quot; Brandkamp remembers . A few agents he talked with had never heard of &quot; Myst. &quot; &quot; It ' s an interactive CD-ROM , &quot; he would explain . Came the response : &quot; What ' s a CD-ROM ? &quot; The Cyan team thinks it will be_better represented by a smaller firm , where the odds of being overshadowed by the traditional clients of a higher-profile agency seem lower . But regardless of the agency , certain parts of the interactive pitch are essentially the same . The name dropping , for one . &quot; They come_in and they tell us how big they are , how powerful . They rattle_off a bunch of their big stars , and they say , ' Oh , we could reach that person for you , noooo problem , ' &quot; says Drew Hoffman , the San Francisco software developer who created the CD-ROM &quot; Iron Helix. &quot; And even the hardest-core programmers are not immune to the dazzle . The guys at Id were wowed by the idea of working with &quot; Evil Dead &quot; director Sam Raimi . Dinner with Kevin Costner sounded awfully nice to Cyan . And Devine at Trilobyte would love to team_up with &quot; Twin Peaks ' &quot; David Lynch . Robert Kotick , chairman of Los Angeles-based video_game developer Activision , has assigned two employees to working with agents . &quot; I love the agencies , &quot; he says . &quot; I want all_the agents in Hollywood to bring us people and ideas . And unlike my counterparts in Silicon_Valley , I do not begrudge them a single dollar. &quot; Still , all_the attention is somewhat overwhelming for programmers to whom &quot; agent &quot; is more likely to mean the computer_programs being developed to sift through and personalize the reams of information and entertainment coming soon to a TV or PC near you . &quot; Who knows how it will work_out ? &quot; says Pepe Moreno , the Los Angeles programmer who created the best-selling &quot; Hell Cab &quot; for Time Warner Interactive and is currently in negotiations with CAA about making an equity investment in his firm . &quot; The relations between the talent agencies and multimedia talent might not follow traditional patterns . But two years ago , I could never have talked to CAA . It ' s all changing very fast. &quot;</TEXT>
