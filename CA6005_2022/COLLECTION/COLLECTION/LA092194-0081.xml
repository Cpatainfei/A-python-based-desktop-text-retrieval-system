   <HEADLINE> A GLAMOROUS HOTHOUSE VIOLET ; COMMENTARY : JESSICA LANGE ' S STRIKING PERFORMANCE IN &quot; BLUE_SKY &quot; IS BELATEDLY RELEASED . HOW COME THIS SUPERB ACTRESS ISN ' T WORKING MORE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jessica Lange ' s acting in &quot; Blue_Sky &quot; leaves you awe-struck . It ' s a great performance . Because the film , which was shot in 1990 , is just now being released -- it ' s yet another foundling from the pre-bankrupt Orion Pictures era -- its appearance is like a gift . It ' s an especially welcome gift because Lange hasn ' t been acting much in the movies lately . ( She ' ll appear in &quot; Losing Isaiah &quot; in November. ) She starred on TV in 1992 in &quot; O Pioneers ! &quot; and , later that year , on Broadway as Blanche DuBois in &quot; A Streetcar Named Desire. &quot; But her two most recent movies are &quot; Cape Fear &quot; ( 1991 ) and &quot; Night and the City &quot; ( 1992 ) . You have to wonder how it is that Lange could give the performance she gave_in &quot; Blue_Sky &quot; -- it ' s probably her best , even better than her Frances Farmer in &quot; Frances &quot; or her Patsy Cline in &quot; Sweet Dreams &quot; -- and keep_away from the cameras for so_long . The lack of good roles for actresses is no excuse . Lange is the kind of actress film artists write great roles for . * Lange ' s role in &quot; Blue_Sky &quot; as Carly , a manic-depressive Army wife , is , at least superficially , one of those life-force sexpot vamps who periodically turn_up in the movies in_order to reduce stalwart men to foaming fumblers . She ' s conceived as a sort of cross between a Tennessee Williams hothouse violet -- a deranged , damaged maiden -- and a late ' 50s / early ' 60s glamorpuss in the Marilyn Monroe style . ( The action is set_in 1962. ) Part of what Lange accomplishes with Carly is to demonstrate how close_in neurotic temperament these two female incarnations really are . They both rise and fall on the fragilities of beauty . The loss of beauty -- or at least its illusion -- becomes the loss of self . Carly knows she is still beautiful , and she exults in her own good_fortune . She sashays with the humor of a woman who believes herself blessed -- the gods must want her to entertain them too . Carly models her look_on the reigning movie queens : Monroe , Elizabeth Taylor , Bardot . She has seized_on movie-star glamour for its power to transpose her life into a swoony , scandalous fantasy . The irony is that Carly is an original -- the more she mimics her fanzine idols the more she emerges in all her ravaged singularity . When she ' s manic she ' s too_much for herself -- too ferociously pent-up and passionate -- and that ' s exactly the state she craves . She needs the fix of delirium . She ' s a trial to her two daughters , who indulge her episodes with a mixture of horror and annoyance . ( They ' re like abused seraphim. ) She ' s a trial to her husband , Hank , an Army radiation scientist , played by Tommy Lee Jones , who decided a long_time ago just to love her unconditionally . ( The felt , underplayed graciousness of his performance helps make Lange ' s possible . And , of course , few directors could work more wonders with actors than Tony Richardson -- this was his last film. ) But , on some essential level , Carly ' s deliriums have so_much more romantic feeling , so_much more danger , than anything else in her family ' s life that she has become indispensable to their will . She ' s a maddening creature in full swoon but , when she ' s in a generous mood , she transforms their dullsville life into a high-spirited casbah . ( The black comedy of the piece is that Carly makes her husband and children miserable so she can commiserate with them in their misery and make them whole. ) * Carly ' s high spirits lift her way off the ground , but she can ' t stay_up there forever . It ' s when she comes_down with a crash that she terrifies . When Hank -- partly because of Carly ' s take-it-all-off high_jinks -- is transferred at the start of the film from Hawaii to a military base in Alabama , Carly ' s sensual , dolled-up funniness inflames to a full-scale rage . Her baby_talk and sweet smiles , so transparently protective , burn away , and she flees her run-down new home until Hank tracks her down in a supply store like a cornered animal . &quot; I can see that radiation just coming_off you , &quot; she wails at Hank , who talks her down with an infinitely comforting patience . He rescues her again , and , yet again , she will betray him . But as she approaches her in this scene , Carly ' s eyes shine in admiration for her rescuer . The harridan has turned_into a supplicant . Carly ' s rages are scary because they don ' t have the self-dramatizing play-act quality of her swoony , rapt episodes . When she ' s dancing her flamenco for a bunch of wide-eyed soldiers at the base in Hawaii , or even when she ' s just dancing sinuously by herself , she has a dreamy , comic quality that lets us know she ' s in on_her_own self-delusion . She plays to an audience even if that audience is herself . ( In a sense , the role is all about the illusionary , crazy-making art of acting. ) But , when she feels trapped and cornered , her voice drops from a hushed Southern breathiness to a hard , low-slung rasp . ( The vocal shifts are reminiscent_of Vivien Leigh ' s Blanche in the movie version of &quot; Streetcar. &quot; ) Her movements becomes jagged . She ' s not self-dramatizing in these moments ; there ' s no bravura , no studied self-awareness , nothing to distance her ( or us ) from her pain . You can see why she avoids the pain -- it strips away her camouflage and leaves her ragged and illusionless . When she ' s high , she ' s hellbent to stay that way . She has a split-second sensuality ; she can turn it on in an instant -- before the despair crowds in . When she thinks Hank is losing his love for her , she sits_up at night while he sleeps ; when he wakes_up and sees her , she asks him if he still loves her and then , before he can answer , advances upon him like an uncoiled dream walker . As the distressed Frances Farmer in &quot; Frances , &quot; Lange sometimes had the lurid , scary , powder-burned look of a figure in a Weegee photograph . In &quot; Blue_Sky , &quot; Lange ' s Carly , at low ebb , sometimes has the bereft , denuded look of a woman in an Edward Hopper painting . Carly can appear so languorously sad -- it ' s not the way we want to see her . ( Sadness doesn ' t make her soulful ; it saps her. ) You can almost forgive her hurtful sprees -- like the way she carries_on with the base commander in_full_view of everybody -- because it ' s her way of murdering despair . Carly ' s seductions hurt everyone around her , but , for her , they ' re not quite real . She doesn ' t want to be &quot; real. &quot; She wants to retreat into her own movie-glamour authenticity , and the men she seduces are just play-actors in her pageant . Carly ends_up a heroine by rescuing Hank from a nasty military double-cross . After saving her so many times , she saves him . It ' s a supreme act of love , and Lange has prepared us for Carly ' s strength by already showing us , in flashes , the depth of that love and the mettle in her mania . Without this last-inning righteousness , Carly might seem too overpoweringly deluded , too neurotically &quot; womanly &quot; for modern audiences . But she ' d be a great character even without this final triumph . Her greatness is in not holding anything back . The real heroism in &quot; Blue_Sky &quot; is the way Jessica Lange doesn ' t hold anything back . She has so_much to give . It ' s a fierce display .</TEXT>
