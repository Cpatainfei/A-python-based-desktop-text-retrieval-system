   <HEADLINE> MCI , 2 BABY BELLS REPORTEDLY IN TALKS FOR JOINT WIRELESS BIDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> MCI Communications Corp . is in talks with regional Bell companies Bell Atlantic Corp . and Nynex Corp . about joint bids for wireless licenses being auctioned in December , sources said Thursday . Though talks with MCI were &quot; substantive , &quot; it would be premature to rule_out Sprint Corp . as an ally of the two Baby Bells as well , said the sources , who declined to be identified . &quot; Things are moving so rapidly , the talks are turning_on dimes , &quot; one of the sources said . Spokesmen at each company declined to comment . The federal_government will hold the &quot; personal communications_systems &quot; auction in December to sell_off frequencies now used for taxi dispatch and similar purposes . With modern technology , these frequencies can be used to build networks of mobile phones , which have the features of cellular_phones . For both MCI and Sprint , each of which has little in the way of mobile communications assets , this will be a vital opportunity to build a national network to rival AT &amp; T Co. ' s following its $ 11.5-billion takeover of McCaw Cellular Communications . But with industry estimates that up_to $ 30 billion may be thrown into the ring to win the available frequencies , even the big long-distance carriers need deep-pocketed allies to share the cost . Bell Atlantic and Nynex are already in the process of merging their wireless licenses , which run_along an essentially unbroken corridor from Boston to Washington in an area with 25 % of the nation ' s population . For MCI , an alliance would mean access to the Baby Bells ' substantial cash reserves and would allow that money to be targeted at less expensive , less densely populated areas outside existing license areas .</TEXT>
