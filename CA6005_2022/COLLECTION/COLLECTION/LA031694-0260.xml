   <HEADLINE> GUILTY VERDICT IN MANISCALCO TRIAL ; COURTS : LONGEST CRIMINAL CASE IN O.C. HISTORY ENDS IN SECOND-DEGREE MURDER_CONVICTION FOR 1980 TRIPLE KILLING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ten years to the day after his arrest , a Westminster attorney who co-founded the Hessians motorcycle gang was convicted Tuesday of second-degree murder for ordering the executions of three people , ending Orange County ' s longest-running murder case . This was the second trial for Thomas F . Maniscalco , 49 , who authorities say plotted the killings in a dispute over counterfeit money and drug profits skimmed from his gang . The victims were another biker gang member , along with his girlfriend and the biker ' s bodyguard , who were shot repeatedly in a Westminster ranch home on Memorial_Day , 1980 . &quot; I don ' t understand the verdicts . It ' s very bizarre , &quot; Maniscalco whispered to his attorney as the verdicts were read . He joked with the bailiff and chuckled loudly as he was led from the courtroom . A Superior_Court jury deliberated 24 days -- two days short of matching the state record set by Maniscalco ' s previous jury in 1990 -- before finding him guilty of three counts of second-degree murder . More_than a week ago , jurors had indicated they were deadlocked , but the judge ordered them to resume deliberating . &quot; I ' m just delighted that the jury reached a verdict , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Rick King , who has been assigned to the case since 1988 . &quot; This case has been a nightmare for the criminal justice system -- the length of the proceedings , the numbers of trial , the delays. &quot; The defense , however , countered with an emotional condemnation . &quot; Ours is a wonderful system , but innocent men are arrested , innocent men are convicted , and innocent men are executed . . . . But I still believe_in the system , &quot; said attorney Joanne Harrold , one of Maniscalco ' s former law professors , who has defended him for free . &quot; He ' s innocent and ( the verdict ) will never be right to me. &quot; Maniscalco , who holds the record for the longest stay in the Orange County Men ' s Central Jail , has denied any involvement in the killings . He faces a possible prison sentence of 16 years to life for each count . Orange County Superior_Court Judge Kathleen E . O ' Leary is scheduled to set a sentencing date today . The prosecution alleged that Maniscalco ordered the deaths of Richard ( Rabbit ) Rizzone , 36 ; Rizzone ' s bodyguard , Thomas Monahan , 28 , and Rizzone ' s girlfriend , Rena Miley , 19 . They were shot repeatedly in Rizzone ' s Westminster home . Miley -- the daughter of a now-retired Los Alamitos police_officer -- also was raped . Prosecutors said Maniscalco , as co-founder of the biker gang , ordered Rizzone killed because he suspected Rizzone was skimming proceeds from the Hessians ' drug and counterfeiting business . Monahan and Miley were killed to eliminate witnesses , prosecutors believed . Defense_attorneys say Maniscalco was framed by an admitted gunman who stole drugs and money from the victims and then tried to finger Maniscalco in exchange for immunity from prosecution . &quot; I know that he is innocent . I will always assist and do what I can , &quot; Harrold said . Maniscalco ' s mother , who has stood firmly by her son , expressed horror when she learned of the verdict . &quot; Oh no ! Oh my God ! How could they have done that ? &quot; said Grace Maniscalco , a 72-year-old retiree from Woodland Hills . Harrold , a former Westminster municipal judge , said the fact that Maniscalco has sat behind bars for a decade biased jurors against him . &quot; If you believe_in the system , it is very difficult to believe_in an innocent man who has been held for 10 years . There is an automatic bias -- if a person is in custody he must have done something wrong , &quot; she said . The prosecution had urged first-degree murder_convictions , alleging that the killings were premeditated . Jurors began hearing testimony in November and started their deliberations Feb . 7 . They logged 15 days behind closed doors before indicating to the judge they were having trouble reaching a verdict . &quot; There was a lot of tension , trying to convince other jurors we were right , &quot; said juror June Hunter , 71 . &quot; There was a reasonable doubt . On first degree , you have to be positive . It wasn ' t difficult at all to go_with second degree , &quot; she added . &quot; I don ' t think he should spend the rest of his life in jail because he wasn ' t there , but he was involved . We finally got_down to that , that he was involved. &quot; Hunter said the jury was first deadlocked 9-3 in favor of conviction , then 10-2 , then 11-1 . &quot; There was so_much involved . It was the most difficult thing I ' ve ever been a part of , &quot; she said . &quot; We had 102 pages of jury instructions. &quot; Hunter said she has &quot; a lot of empathy &quot; for Maniscalco . &quot; He talked_about his childhood . He made me think_of him in a different way . He ' s a real-life person . . . not just an object , &quot; she said . Another juror , who identified himself only as juror No . 6 , praised the group as &quot; 12 wonderful people with open minds. &quot; During breaks , and on their lunch hour , jurors played cards -- crazy eights and king ' s corners -- to try and maintain an air of normalcy and sanity , he said . But the deliberations were far from harmonious . &quot; You put 12 people in a room for 24 days -- nobody threw punches , but there were ups and there were downs , &quot; juror No . 6 said . &quot; Sometimes I felt that we could have used a break . We could have used a day or two off. &quot; Jurors took a long_time weighing whether Maniscalco was part of a conspiracy to kill , the juror said . Once everyone agreed on that , they then moved_on to decide whether to convict him of first- or second-degree murder . &quot; There is some discomfort &quot; about the verdict , the juror said . &quot; I was one of the people who took a longer_time to come_to a decision . I felt in my heart and in my mind that I hadn ' t turned_over every rock . &quot; I ' m happy with myself that I went_through every piece of evidence . . . but if there was more evidence , something that could have taken me down a different road , maybe it would have. &quot; Maniscalco co-founded a group of motorcyclists who called themselves the Hessians -- alternatively described as a biker gang by prosecutors and a biker club by Maniscalco ' s defense_attorneys . The bodies of the victims were found one week after the murders in 1980 . Maniscalco and fellow biker Daniel M . Duffy of Long_Beach were considered key suspects from the start , but investigators said it took four years to gather enough evidence to charge them . Prosecutors determined to bring Maniscalco and Duffy to justice offered Robert Robbins , an admitted accomplice to the murders , immunity in exchange for his testimony that Maniscalco had organized the killings and was in Rizzone ' s home the night of the murders . That agreement became a rallying point for defense_attorneys , who argued that Robbins would have implicated anyone to save his own skin . A separate jury in 1992 convicted Duffy of the slayings , but could not reach a unanimous verdict on whether Duffy should be sentenced to death for his crimes . Prosecutors decided to drop the death_penalty against Duffy rather than retry the penalty portion of the trial , and also stopped seeking a death sentence for Maniscalco . Maniscalco ' s first trial lasted 17 months and was followed by jury deliberations that spanned 26 days -- a state record -- before jurors deadlocked 10-2 for conviction in November , 1990 . The case against Maniscalco and Duffy has proved among the costliest in Orange County history , although a financial breakdown is not available , said Alan Slater , chief administrative officer of the Orange County Superior_Court . Over the years , Maniscalco has become an advocate for inmate rights , filing lawsuits to improve jail conditions . &quot; Wherever Tom Maniscalco is , he ' s going_to be a positive influence . He ' s demonstrated that in his 10 years in County Jail , &quot; said defense_attorney Curt Livesay . &quot; He ' s disappointed ( with the verdict ) , &quot; Livesay said of his client . &quot; But he ' s been in pretrial confinement for 10 years , and it ' s remarkable that anyone who ' s been in Orange County jail conditions for 10 years would show any emotion at all. &quot; The marathon legal drama has been dogged by so many legal maneuverings , delays and freak mishaps that the case has overshadowed the crimes themselves . Over the years , both prosecutors and defense_attorneys have blamed each other for postponements in Maniscalco ' s case . At one point last year , King , who is the county ' s top homicide prosecutor , and defense_attorney Livesay questioned each other on the witness_stand to lay blame for case delays . On Tuesday , King praised district_attorney ' s investigator Don Null who he said &quot; kept this case together &quot; since 1981 . &quot; The credit to this finality goes_to him , &quot; King said . &quot; The people involved in this case -- the judges , the prosecutors , the witnesses , and even the defendant himself -- can go_on and do other things in their lives , &quot; he said . Times staff writers Brian Ray Ballou and Rene Lynch contributed to this report .
