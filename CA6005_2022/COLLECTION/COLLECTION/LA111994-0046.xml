   <TEXT> Rush ' s World : Looking_for someplace to spend your next vacation ? Forget Disney World . Take a trip to Limbaugh Land . The southeast Missouri town of Cape Girardeau is aiming to lure tourists by pitching its connection to hometown boy Rush Limbaugh . Beginning early next year , excursion buses ( making mostly right turns , no doubt ) will pass the hospital where the conservative talk-show host was born , the house where he lived , the barbershop where he shined shoes and the radio_station where he got his start . Postcards and souvenir magnets will be available . * ' Eye ' ing Stability : CBS ' &quot; Eye to Eye With Connie Chung &quot; is apparently staying_put , at least for now , in its tough Thursday 10 p.m. time_slot against NBC ' s powerhouse drama &quot; ER. &quot; Earlier this week , &quot; Eye &quot; executive producer Susan Zirinsky told a reporter that meetings have been held about either revamping or moving the show , and rumors have been circulating about &quot; Eye ' s &quot; future all week . But on Thursday , CBS News president Eric Ober said there were no &quot; current &quot; plans for changes on the show or its time_period . &quot; The only thing we have planned for ' Eye to Eye ' right now , &quot; Ober said , &quot; is to keep_on doing really good , really interesting shows and spending less time on talking in public about it. &quot; So far this fall , &quot; Eye &quot; is in a tie for 69th place among prime-time shows . * ' Party ' Time : Fox is switching the time_periods for two of its low-rated dramas , the critically praised &quot; Party of Five &quot; and the Aaron Spelling show &quot; Models Inc. &quot; Starting Jan . 2 , &quot; Models &quot; will follow &quot; Melrose Place &quot; on Monday nights at 9 , while &quot; Party , &quot; about five siblings struggling to keep their family together after the deaths of their parents , will air after another teen-oriented show , &quot; Beverly Hills , 90210 , &quot; on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. Both &quot; Party &quot; and &quot; Models &quot; have had trouble in the ratings ; &quot; Party &quot; ranks 97th out of 101 prime-time shows while &quot; Models &quot; is in 84th place . In a vote_of_confidence , however , Fox announced Friday that it had ordered four more episodes of &quot; Party , &quot; bringing the season ' s total to 20 , and will rebroadcast its pilot episode on Dec . 28 at 9 p.m. MOVIES &amp; VIDEO Video Is as Video Does : The year ' s box-office champ , &quot; Forrest Gump , &quot; will be released on video April 28 , Paramount Pictures announced Friday .

As part of an extortion attempt , six real Triads turned_up on the set , threatening to disrupt work_on the film unless they were paid_off . Police arrested the would-be gangsters , ages 16 to 20 . Since the Chinese communist revolution of 1949 , the_British colony has been the world headquarters of the Triad gangs . Hong Kong police have identified 57 different Triad societies in the crowded territory .

However , the band is only playing two dates ( including tonight ) in a small venue -- a 110-seat theater at Pittsburgh ' s Andy Warhol Museum . John Cale , Sterling Morrison and Moe Tucker planned to improvise 90-minute sets while images from Warhol ' s early silent films were projected upon them . In the band ' s early days , Reed and other members worked with Warhol on several of his avant-garde projects . It was Warhol ' s idea for them to record and he was listed as co-producer on their first album , for which he also provided the cover design . * Tribute to Bakersfield : Buck Owens , who helped popularize country_music ' s Bakersfield Sound , is creating a museum honoring the genre -- in the San Joaquin Valley town , of course . Construction on the museum and a restaurant , bar , stage and dance area should begin within a_few weeks , said Owens ' spokesman .
