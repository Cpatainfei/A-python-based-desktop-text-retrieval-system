   <HEADLINE> BRIEFCASE : REAL_ESTATE ; BUILDING_PERMITS FOR NEW HOUSING ALMOST DOUBLE IN JANUARY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The number of building_permits issued for new housing in Orange County almost doubled in January , according to the state Construction_Industry Research Board . The number of permits totaled 591 , up from 338 issued in January , 1993 . &quot; It ' s hard to read too_much into January . I don ' t want to discount the increase , but I don ' t want to say it ' s a turn-around , &quot; said Ben Bartolotto , research_director for the board . Because permits are an indicator of builders ' intention to start construction , they usually go_up after home sales start to increase , Bartolotto said . More important , he said , is that home-building permits for last year totaled 6 # 409 , compared to 5 # 943 for 1992 . For all_of Southern California , he said , only Orange and San Diego counties showed a year-to-year increase.ORANGE COUN</TEXT>
