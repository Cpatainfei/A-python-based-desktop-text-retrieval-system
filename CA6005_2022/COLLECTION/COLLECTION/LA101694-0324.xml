   <HEADLINE> INNOVATIVE PRODUCE COMPANY TAKES FINANCIAL BATTERING ; SUN WORLD ' S SETBACKS BLAMED ON UNTIMELY DEATHS , MEXICAN TOMATO COSTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Think_of Sun World , the California produce giant now in deep financial trouble , as a beautiful piece of fruit that got bruised on the way to market . The company has taken a series of hits in the past three years , ranging from a disastrous year for California vegetables and the high cost of growing a tomato in Mexico to the untimely deaths or departures of key executives and a reluctant French lender who has moved to shut_off its credit . The setbacks forced the heavily indebted firm to file for protection from its creditors early this month under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws . &quot; We ' ve lost a lot of money , &quot; acknowledged Sun World Chairman Howard P . Marguleas , a part owner of Irvine Co . in Orange County and a widely respected figure in California agriculture and public life . Yet the ambitious firm , which Marguleas says has every intention of continuing scaled-back operations , has also made a lot of money in the past 18 years , while carving out a unique position in the high-risk industry that brings fresh fruits and vegetables to supermarket shelves . The idea behind Sun World -- which introduced to consumers such popular items as the Red Flame seedless grape and the seedless watermelon -- has been to grow and ship one-of-a-kind , user-friendly fruits and vegetables , particularly during seasons when no one else is growing similar produce . &quot; Bigger , redder , blacker , sweeter -- and off-season , &quot; Marguleas said during an interview in Century City days after the bankruptcy petition was filed_in San Bernardino . Though Sun World has marketed as_many as 75 produce varieties at a time , it has been most aggressive in promoting fruits with those features , many of which are patented . It also has one of the most elaborate research and development operations of any in agribusiness , every year scrutinizing 35 # 000 new varieties of fruit_trees and 100 # 000 new grapes at a facility in Bakersfield , where the firm is based . &quot; They ' ve been very strong marketers , &quot; said David L . Moore , president of the Western Growers Assn . &quot; They ' re one of the top produce companies in the country , for quality and for quantity. ' But Sun World also is bogged down with only interim financing for working capital -- and with $ 182 million in long-term debt and other liabilities , compared to $ 188 million in assets . The company maintains that much of its assets are in real_estate with a market_value higher than its book_value . Sun World was formed in 1976 by three of California ' s best-known produce men , who together still own more_than 85 % of the stock . A former board chairman of the California Chamber_of_Commerce , Marguleas has been the dominant partner , whose strong suits are marketing and promotion as well as citrus and date production . He owns more_than 65 % of Sun World . Marguleas was one of the wealthy investors , led by Donald Bren , who in 1977 bought a 35 % interest in Irvine Co . for $ 337 million after a furious bidding war . Now Marguleas is in the process of selling his 5 % of the Orange County real_estate giant for an estimated $ 94 million . The other Sun World founders were Domenick T . ( Cookie ) Bianco , with 7 % of the company , a well-respected table grapes grower , and Carl Sam Maggio , an experienced vegetable farmer and marketer who owns more_than 12 % of the privately held_firm . Sun World ' s first project in uncommon produce was a big success for the fruit but an expensive lesson to the company . In 1977 , Sun World spent millions of dollars on full-page newspaper_ads and other promotions to market Red Flame seedless grapes , a crisp , tasty variety developed by the University of California . Consumers loved it . But the Red Flame was unpatented , public_property . Sun World ' s competitors planted hundreds of acres of the same grape -- and the price dropped through the floor . &quot; It became too generic a commodity &quot; to bring the premium price that Sun World ' s promotion and development costs required , Marguleas recalled . &quot; That really focused us. &quot; In 1978 , Sun World bought a 50 % interest in Interharvest , the big Salinas Valley lettuce grower that long had been a focus of angry labor strikes by the United Farm_Workers of America . Renaming the company Sun Harvest , Sun World eventually shut it down after six more years of labor complaints . The kind of niche-market success the partners had_in_mind came_in 1983 , when Sun World delivered its first branded specialty product : the Le Rouge Royale sweet red_pepper . Yellow and orange patented peppers followed . The Sun World seedless watermelon debuted in 1988 , and the DiVine Ripe tomato -- a variety that can be ripened in the field -- arrived in 1990 . The next year , the Star Sweet deep_red grapefruit hit the market , the Black_Diamond plum arrived one year later . This year , despite the distractions of its business problems , Sun World is promoting the first California-grown mango , an off-season version of the world ' s most popular fruit . In Tokyo , Sun World mangoes are selling for as much as $ 18 each . But it has also cost the company an enormous amount to get them into Japanese shopping_baskets . Developing a mango ( a fruit normally grown in the tropics ) that could be produced in the Southern California desert during a part of the year when the rest of the world was mango-less was a multimillion-dollar research effort that began more_than a decade ago . The experimental mangoes , planted on a secret plot near Indio , survived a 1990 freeze only because Sun World used a helicopter to circulate warm air over the field . The effort was set_back when armed intruders scaled a 12-foot razor-wire fence and killed a guard_dog to steal a row of the trees in an apparent act of commercial espionage . Then the company had to familiarize Japanese consumers with a mango that was big and tasty but green-skinned even when ripe . Sun World set_up sample tables in Japanese supermarkets , offering slices of the fruit to shoppers . Each mango now bears a Japanese decal that translates , &quot; I ' m green , but I ' m sweet and ready to eat. &quot; In 1989 , Sun World bought Bakersfield-based Superior Farming Co. , with 25 # 000 acres of farmland and what many believe is the largest tree fruit and grape research_center in the world . At the same time , the company was expanding its operations overseas , particularly in Mexico and Japan as well as 28 other countries . By 1992 , however , some of the company ' s projects began to unravel . In December of that year , Sun World says , its working capital financier -- Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole , France ' s largest bank -- told the company it was pulling_out of its investments in the western United States . This has left the company without permanent working capital for the past year , though Credit Agricole has agreed to provide interim financing until a bankruptcy lender can be found . &quot; If any farmer ' s bank pulled their line_of_credit midseason , the financial consequences would be terrible , &quot; said Don Johnston , senior partner in Johnston Farms , a Bakersfield grower . John R . Zivnuska , a Credit Agricole executive , denied that the bank is pulling_out of its U.S. loans and says the Sun World decision was &quot; based on facts the bank became aware of. &quot; He declined to elaborate . However , like other international banks , Credit Agricole has been hit hard by soured foreign loans since 1990 . In the fallout , heads have rolled at the bank ' s Paris headquarters . The Los Angeles office has been closed , and the San Francisco staff cut_to four . By all accounts , the already-conservative bank has tightened its loan policies even further . &quot; Credit Agricole was part of all_the mess , &quot; said Katharine Rossow , a senior analyst at Salomon Bros . Since then , all_the international banks are more conservative in their lending policies , she said . No matter what caused Credit Agricole to withdraw , the bank would soon have more &quot; facts &quot; to be concerned about . The most expensive project to go_bad was one involving tomatoes in Mexico . Though fertilizer and other essentials cost the same or more there as in California , transportation , border-crossing and labor costs were far higher than Sun World expected . &quot; When you get done , the unit-per-acre cost is higher in Mexico than in the United States -- with labor costing seven times higher , &quot; Marguleas said . Turnover at Sun World became an issue in the industry . By most reports , the inevitable differences_of_opinion between three strong-minded founders had always made Sun World a challenging place to work . &quot; They had some real knock-down battles , &quot; one industry executive said . Carl Sam Maggio quit to start his own business in December , 1992 , though he remains an owner . President James R . Rinella then 57 , retired in 1992 . His successor , Robert V . Igleheartthen 52 , resigned in April , 1993 , saying he wanted to spend more time with his family . Steve Poindexter , vice_president of sales , resigned last January after 11 years with the company . In early April , Marguleas himself stepped_down to concentrate_on the sale of his holdings in Irvine Co. , though he has since returned to active leadership . Sending more jitters through the produce world , Sun World ' s longtime controller , Jo A . Horning , known for keeping her work close to the vest , died of a heart_attack after a medical_examination at a Rancho Mirage hospital in June , 1993 . After the company ' s books were turned_over to a new controller , the company began to send -- and is still updating -- a series of financial &quot; adjustments , &quot; with less optimistic numbers , to its lenders and others . This summer , in a haunting if apparently coincidental development , the new controller , Gary A . Winters , died of a heart_attack on a Bakersfield golf_course . Meanwhile , California ' s cauliflower , broccoli , celery and iceberg_lettuce harvest , crops that Sun World also markets , had a terrible season in 1993 . Produce on the West Coast couldn ' t be trucked past the Midwest floods to customers who were storm-besieged themselves on the East Coast . &quot; The last 11 months have been about the worst that I have ever seen in the fresh vegetable business , &quot; said Moore of the Western Growers Assn . &quot; We had a lot of production , but we didn ' t have anyone to take the product . And produce is a special business . If you don ' t eat a salad today , it doesn ' t mean you ' ll eat two tomorrow. &quot; As word of Sun World ' s troubles quietly spread in the industry , growers that had marketed their crops through the company began to turn elsewhere . In May , even Irvine Co . shipped 500 # 000 boxes of avocados through Mission Produce Inc. of Oxnard , instead of through Sun World . It sent a_million cartons of Valencia_oranges and grapefruit to Dole Citrus for marketing . Last month , Sun World brought_in a new chief_executive , turnaround expert John P . Brincko , who quickly persuaded the company to file for bankruptcy protection . Because the firm operates year-round , Brincko doesn ' t expect to have his restructuring plan complete for another year . But some elements are already clear . Plantings will be reduced for the DiVine Ripe tomato . It faces increasing competition from two gene-altered varieties that claim the same vine-ripened tastiness and long shelf_life . The Mexico operation will be cut_back , and some farmland and other assets will be sold . But the mangoes are a big hit in Tokyo , Marguleas says . His Japanese buyers expect to take 100 # 000 boxes next year , up from 5 # 000 at the beginning of the promotion just two years ago . Sun World At-a-Glance * Founded : 1976 , by Howard P .
