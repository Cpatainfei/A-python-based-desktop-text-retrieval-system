   <HEADLINE> DO-IT-YOURSELF ; TAPPING THE SOURCE FOR HOT WATER OUTSIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Have you ever wondered , maybe while washing the car , filling the kiddie pool or handling any of a dozen other outdoor water chores , why someone hasn ' t designed a hot-and-cold-water outdoor faucet ? Actually , such faucets do exist , and have been used at the commercial level for years . But for some reason , they ' ve seldom made the trip to the residential side of the street . It could be because they ' re a bit pricey ( $ 225 to $ 250 ) , but more likely , it ' s because few of us know that they exist . If you decide you would benefit from having an outdoor hot water_faucet , installing one in a typically framed house is relatively easy for a confident do-it-yourselfer . Begin by choosing a joist space convenient to both outdoor watering tasks and indoor plumbing lines . Because the body of the valve must fit through a sizable opening in the rim joist , you ' ll need to cut ( not drill ) the siding and joist . Position the faucet in a convenient location , then mark the siding for the faucet body cutout using a_level . Once the cutout is marked , bore saw blade entry holes at the four corners . Use a one-quarter-inch bit for good clearance . Then , cut between the holes by using a reciprocating saw or sabre saw . Once the opening is cut , check the faucet for fit . Apply a bead of caulk to the rim of the opening and press the faucet in place . Before fitting any piping to the faucet , install the check valves in the hot and cold mixing-valve ports . With the water shut_off at the meter and the piping system drained , cut_into your home ' s hot and cold water_supply lines . ( Most likely , these lines will be made of copper. ) To make the connection between the water_supply lines and the new faucet , splice tees into the trunk_lines and continue piping toward the faucet . With connections made , solder all fittings with lead-free solder and support the piping at least every six feet with pipe hangers . Like many chores , sweat soldering plumbing fittings looks more complicated than it is . The basic requirements are simple : Cut the tubing cleanly and squarely , and clean all mating surfaces so they are free_of dirt and contaminants . To get a good cut , use a high-quality tubing cutter . And to make_sure everything is clean , rigorously rub all mating surfaces with steel_wool , then coat them with flux before joining them . Also keep_in mind that lead-free solder requires more heat to melt than older solders . Just hold your propane torch on each joint longer before applying the solder .</TEXT>
