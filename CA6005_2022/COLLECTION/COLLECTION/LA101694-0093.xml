   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN EMIGRE COMMUNITY ACCUSES NEW YORK POLICE OF HARASSMENT ; CRIME : SOME IN BRIGHTON BEACH , DISPUTING CRIMINAL IMAGE , HAVE LAUNCHED A NEW MISSION TO COUNTERACT WHAT THEY SEE AS RISING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST NEWCOMERS FROM THE FORMER SOVIET_UNION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Michael Gotlibovsky and his family , the parking dispute should have been a shouting match at worst . But when Gotlibovsky ' s nephew started exchanging angry words with a man in red shorts and a T-shirt in a Brighton Beach parking_lot , the man pulled_out a police badge and a hip-pocket radio . Within minutes , police flooded the area . Gotlibovsky , his son and his nephew were thrown to the ground , handcuffed and arrested for disorderly_conduct , resisting arrest and obstructing justice . &quot; How can they do this ? &quot; asked Gotlibovsky as he stood_in the battered hallway of Brooklyn ' s criminal_court recently . The 54-year-old Ukrainian , who opened his shoe repair_shop in Brighton Beach when he arrived 18 years ago , spent two days in court to have his record cleared . After the charges were dismissed , Gotlibovsky said he planned to file an official complaint against the officers who arrested him . The incident came_after a similar fracas in early August that resulted in the arrest of five people , including a Russian-speaking man who has run an auto repair_shop in Brighton Beach for more a decade . The sum of these two incidents , plus a number of less dramatic ones , has left many longtime residents of this Russian emigre stronghold stunned and bitter about what they believe is unfair treatment by police and city officials . &quot; There are a lot of problems now in Brighton Beach , &quot; said Felix Gotlibovsky , Michael ' s 30-year-old son , who was arrested with his father . &quot; Because there are criminals coming here now from Russia , they think that all Russians are criminals. &quot; With Russian crime becoming a hot topic in the media and a steadily increasing Russian emigre community , law-abiding Russians have begun to feel that America ' s welcome_mat is unraveling . A Russian accent -- like an Italian name in past eras -- seems to give people the instant label as &quot; Mafia , &quot; several Russians said . Now some prominent Russians have launched a new group whose mission is in part to oppose what they see as rising discrimination against emigres from the former Soviet_Union . &quot; We were not getting our phone_calls to the city answered , &quot; said Valery Weinberg , chairman of the group , which calls itself the First North American-Russian Council . The group started off with a protest early last month that included Soviet veterans wearing their World_War_II medals , much as they do at similar rallies in Moscow . The rally also brought_out a_few angry participants who were ready to chant &quot; American police are KGB. &quot; Leaders persuaded the firebrands to carry less explosive placards : &quot; We are for police but against police brutality. &quot; The council showed another dimension of its growing clout when it hosted an opening , which featured violins , ice sculptures and speeches by a variety of cultural and political figures such_as Sen . Alfonse M . D ' Amato ( R-N.Y. ) . The reception , which drew about 500 people , was held at the council ' s posh new headquarters , a well-appointed townhouse near Fifth_Avenue that was once owned by Andrew_Carnegie . The council will share the site with the Women ' s National Republican Club . Memberships run $ 3 # 000 for corporations and $ 1 # 500 for families . Weinberg , who is also publisher of the Russian-language newspaper Novoye Russkoye Slovo , said the Russians want to make_it clear they are in the United States to stay , not just to tap into the country ' s economic largess and return home with their savings . When there are problems , he said , his group wants the city to respond quickly . Lou Carbonetti , director of community assistance in the mayor ' s office , said he has begun working with the First North_American Russian Council . &quot; We are trying to find_out what is going_on there and how to remedy this , &quot; Carbonetti said . &quot; We are all concerned about proper treatment of them , and we will make_sure we will help any way possible , as we would in any community. &quot; Like many other immigrant groups coming_to America , the more established emigres in the Russian-speaking community in Brooklyn and other areas around New York City are suffering in part from the problems brought by the newer ones . The Soviet_Union has disintegrated , and with its demise the status of the Russian immigrant seems to have changed . After years of being viewed_as brave refugees from a brutal totalitarian system , the older immigrants have been supplanted by a newer_wave with a far less savory reputation . Police officials , federal authorities and the media have begun to focus_on the sudden appearance of violent Russian mobsters here with connections to gangs in the former Soviet states . FBI Director Louis J . Freeh went_to Russia earlier this year to help set_up an FBI office in Moscow and start a working relationship with Russian police to catch mobsters moving_over the borders into Europe and to the United States . At the same time , the FBI office in New York has set_up a Russian crime unit with 10 to 20 members , some of them Russian speakers . The FBI says it is working_on about 40 cases involving Russians here . &quot; The kinds of criminals who are coming here now are directly related to the economic chaos after the end of communism , &quot; said Stephen Handelman , author of a new book , &quot; Comrade Criminal : The Theft of the Second Russian Revolution. &quot; &quot; This new_wave includes people who are members of the classic Soviet underworld as well as people who are heavily involved in white-collar crime and the drug syndicates . Now , they are free to travel. &quot; One Russian emigre , who asked to remain anonymous , said Russian criminals are often more of a problem for fellow Russians than for Americans . He cited the case of a friend who set_up business , paid his taxes and felt the &quot; pleasure &quot; of being &quot; perfectly legal. &quot; Then one day last year , a Russian gangster demanded a monthly cut . Either the businessman paid or he &quot; must worry about his family back home_in Russia , &quot; the mobster warned . The businessman closed_down . &quot; We don ' t want them , these Russians . But are we the ones who let them into the country ? &quot; asked Boris Smirnov , Gotlibovsky ' s nephew , a 33-year-old taxi driver who arrived 18 years ago and was arrested with the Gotlibovskys Aug . 28 . There are by rough estimate 300 # 000 to 350 # 000 legal emigres from the former Soviet_Union in the greater New York area and perhaps another 150 # 000 who came_on student or tourist visas and have remained here illegally . &quot; There are good people and bad people , and you cannot judge a whole community by a_few people , &quot; Weinberg said . &quot; Yes , there are criminal elements here , but I guarantee you that this is not the Cosa Nostra. &quot;</TEXT>
