   <HEADLINE> THEATER SCENE ; ' OTHELLO ' HAS DIFFERENT OUTLOOK AT OJAI FESTIVAL ; AS A FOLLOWER OF ISLAM , ACTOR SHRIFF HASAM BRINGS AN UNUSUAL PERSPECTIVE TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE MOOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shriff Hasam , who stars in the Ojai Shakespeare Festival ' s production of &quot; Othello , &quot; has a limited background in Shakespeare . But , as a practitioner of Islam , the 41-year-old actor brings a relatively unusual perspective to his interpretation of the noble Moor . Hasam -- who , as a youth , shuttled back and forth between his mother in New Orleans and his father in Houston -- was introduced to Shakespeare while attending a performance of &quot; Macbeth &quot; in New Orleans . Later , while attending Tuskegee University in Alabama , he became seriously involved in the theater -- and Islam . His classmates included Lionel Richie and other members of the band that would evolve into the Commodores . And there was a young_man named Keenen Ivory Wayans , the future creator of the film &quot; I ' m Gonna Git You Sucka &quot; and the comedy series &quot; In Living Color. &quot; &quot; He and I were among the people who helped get students interested in theater , &quot; Hasam recalled in a recent interview . &quot; We got some_other students together , hired a director and started doing plays. &quot; Hasam discovered Islam after hearing about it from other students . &quot; I didn ' t come_into Islam because of Malcolm X , &quot; he stressed , &quot; but through my own study . Everybody ' s looking_for something , and I found what I was looking_for when I became a Muslim. &quot; While in Alabama , Hasam appeared in the film &quot; Norma Rae , &quot; which starred Sally Field . He then moved to Los Angeles and won a role on the soap_opera &quot; Rituals. &quot; But a drunk driver ruined Hasam ' s prospects for soap stardom : After one episode , he was struck_down and suffered a broken pelvis . While recuperating , he enrolled in Los Angeles City College , subsequently earning his master ' s in theater from CalArts . Hasam took teaching positions in Houston and , last year , was back at Tuskegee , where he started a theater program . He left after his one-year contract expired . &quot; They didn ' t want to spend money , &quot; he said ruefully . &quot; They wanted to concentrate_on the sciences. &quot; Now , Hasam is seeking a teaching position in Southern California , &quot; although at the moment , I ' m concentrating all_of my attention on the role of Othello . Of the many roles I ' ve performed , Othello is the role that I ' ve always wanted ; it ' s a dream come true. &quot; Ojai Shakespeare Festival Artistic Director Paul Backer , who ' d known Hasam since the Los Angeles City College days , had no trouble choosing him for the role . &quot; Of the six people who auditioned , &quot; Backer said , &quot; a lot of them were pretty good , but I was looking_for a bit more age and gravity . Because a lot of the plays that he has done are contemporary African American or African , Hasam taps into the ferocity that is contained in Othello ' s dignity . &quot; When Laurence Olivier or Anthony Hopkins or even classically trained black actors have played the role , Othello is more uptight , because he ' s a military_leader . Hasam brings anger to the role. &quot; Although his religion has made him more accepting of other cultures and beliefs , Hasam said he relates to Othello ' s anger . &quot; The fact that Othello is a Moor , who had to convert to Christianity in_order to become acceptable to Venice society , is something I can understand , &quot; he said . &quot; I had to give_up a certain amount of my lifestyle when I became a Muslim. &quot; * There ' s plenty more Shakespeare in the works for this and next year , with no duplication scheduled -- so far . Look_for the Ojai Shakespeare Company ' s &quot; Much Ado About Nothing &quot; later this month and the Tour_de_Force Repertory_Company production of &quot; The Taming of the Shrew &quot; at Thousand Oaks ' Civic Arts Plaza in November . The Moorpark-based California Shakespeare Company has just announced its schedule : &quot; Love ' s Labours Lost &quot; ( September ) , &quot; Anthony and Cleopatra &quot; ( November ) , &quot; Henry_V &quot; ( February ) and &quot; Twelfth_Night &quot; ( April ) . All are performed in the area infrequently , with the exception of &quot; Much Ado , &quot; &quot; Shrew &quot; and &quot; Twelfth_Night , &quot; which seem to pop_up every couple of weeks . And , so far , nobody ' s announced a production of the really overdone &quot; A Midsummer_Night ' s Dream &quot; or &quot; Romeo and Juliet. &quot;</TEXT>
