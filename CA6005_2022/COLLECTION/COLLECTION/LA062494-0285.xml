   <HEADLINE> INSIGHT FROM MAVEN OF THE MIND ; STAGE : THE MENTALIST , WHO WILL PERFORM IN SANTA ANA , SAYS HE GETS HINTS FROM BODY_LANGUAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What ' s the last thing a reporter expects the man who bills himself as a mind_reader to do during an interview ? Demystify his act . But that ' s precisely what Max Maven did recently while sipping coffee at Hamburger Hamlet and looking almost like any regular Joe : A widow ' s peak , braided ponytail , goatee and two hoop earrings dangling from one ear don ' t necessarily spell eccentric in the ' 90s . &quot; If you put any faith in IQ_tests , I ' m brighter than most people , fair enough , &quot; said Maven , who opens his one-man mind-reading act at the Way Off Broadway Playhouse in Santa Ana tonight . &quot; I would hope that I have a certain theatrical flair that makes me interesting . OK , fine . But as far as having some sort of psychic power or sixth_sense ? I doubt it. &quot; A practicing mentalist for 25 years , Maven performs live and on television , here and overseas , often in Japan ( he speaks Japanese ) and Europe ( where he uses interpreters ) . He recently starred in a 12-part series for British TV , &quot; Something Strange , &quot; in which , blindfolded , he selected a designated balloon from among several hovering above his TV studio audience and performed other mysterious acts . &quot; Max Maven : Thinking in_Person , &quot; his Santa Ana show , ran_for two months in 1988 at the Beverly Hills Playhouse . The essence of what he does , he explained while chatting amiably at the restaurant near his home , involves nonverbal communication or body_language . During one performance , he said he told a stunned L.A. Reader newspaper reporter in his audience that the journalist , who wrote_up the account , had within the past three years visited a remote village in Fiji , how long the vacation lasted , and what the reporter did there -- with perfect accuracy . And without the reporter having uttered a word . &quot; I get some information from the timing of someone ' s speech , how quickly or slowly they respond to the specific things I ' m saying at a given moment , &quot; Maven said . Other insights come from &quot; watching their pupils or watching the behavior of their lips perhaps . In some cases , I might be talking to someone else about what that person ' s thinking , but watching the other person react to that. &quot; Maven uses the analogy of musical ability to further explain it . &quot; Ninety-nine percent of the population has some sort of musical ability , they can carry a tune , they can remember a melody , and maybe 1 % are tone deaf , &quot; he said . &quot; Now imagine there are two people and one has a grade-A musical ability and one has a grade-B ability . Let ' s say the person with the grade-A ability does nothing with it , but the person with the grade-B ability learns how to read music , to play instruments , to develop their vocal ability . &quot; After a period_of_time , we sit the two people down and say , ' OK , show me your musical talent. ' Which one of them is going_to come_across as being the better musician ? The one who worked_at it , of course . &quot; So , when I ' m asked , ' Do you have this special talent ? ' or whatever , well I think there ' s a latent ability of this sort in everyone . Maybe there ' s the 1 % who is the equivalent of tone deaf , but we all communicate nonverbally all_the time . It ' s just that I ' ve been exercising this stuff for years. &quot; Of course , Maven won ' t give it all away . He won ' t reveal exactly how or why he chose Fiji , for instance , from a lip curl or the way the reporter ' s pupils dilated . Nor would he fully explain the demonstration he executed for this reporter , which , he said , showed his ability to influence as well as_to read people ' s thinking . After putting a rubber_band around my wrist , he asked me to draw any geometrical shape on a piece_of_paper . I drew a triangle . When I removed the rubber_band and placed it on the table , it formed a perfect triangle . All he would say is that &quot; somehow , through some nonverbal means I was able to influence you into drawing that shape as opposed to any other shape. &quot; Still , why explain so_much of what he does ? Because , said Maven , &quot; I think what ' s left over is so mystifying . . . . I feel no need to make exorbitant claims , to tell you I ' m in communication with entities from outer space or from 1 # 000 years in the past who are channeling through me , because I feel what I do is inherently fascinating. &quot; * An erstwhile radio deejay , singer and actor , Maven , who won ' t give his age , became fascinated with the paranormal at age 7 through playing the old_maid card_game . &quot; You ' re picking cards from the person on one side of you , &quot; he said , &quot; and the person on the other side is picking from you . What you ' re hoping is that if you have the old_maid card , you get_to unload it , whereas if you don ' t have it , you ' re hoping you don ' t pluck it out of the hand of the person next to you . &quot; Well , I found that if the person next to me had the old_maid card , I didn ' t usually take it , and if I got the old_maid card , I would sort of wish the person would take it from me . They didn ' t always take it , but it happened enough times that I thought , ' Wait a minute , there ' s something going_on here -- this is better than luck. ' I was becoming aware on a gut level that people were giving me information or receiving information from me &quot; in a nonverbal way . Through the years , he ' s made plenty of mistakes , misreading someone ' s mind , for instance . &quot; There ' s nothing in my main repertory that hasn ' t gone_wrong , &quot; he said with a chuckle , &quot; not a single thing . What do you do ? You pick yourself up , you dust yourself off , and that ' s it . But I like that aspect , I like the risk , it gives an edge to the performance , and it makes_it genuinely exciting for me because I don ' t know if everything is going_to go right . &quot; Look , I ' ve been doing this for a long_time , I ' m good at what I do . In any given show , it ' s rare that I get much wrong . I don ' t put a piece into my repertory unless my batting_average is ( extremely high ) . But none of it is guaranteed . The minute I say , ' How about the person over here , choose this , think_of that , come_on stage , ' the minute that happens , all_the bets are off. &quot; * &quot; Max Maven : Thinking in_Person &quot; previews today and Saturday at Way Off Broadway Playhouse , 1058 E . 1st St. , No . 007 , Santa Ana . 8 p.m. $ 10 .
