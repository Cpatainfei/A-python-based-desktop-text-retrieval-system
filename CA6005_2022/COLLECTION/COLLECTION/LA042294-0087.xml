   <HEADLINE> 6 SUSPECTED GANG MEMBERS HELD IN THOUSAND OAKS SWEEP ; CRIME : RAIDS AT 10 HOMES CAME AFTER STREET FIGHTS BY RIVAL GROUPS OUTSIDE A NEWBURY PARK HOUSE LAST WEEK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sheriff ' s deputies swept_through a_Thousand Oaks neighborhood Thursday arresting six suspected gang members in the aftermath of a series of gang-related street fights . The gang sweep was a part of a follow-up investigation of some fights that erupted between rival gangs in front of a Newbury Park house last week , authorities said . Two suspected gang members were arrested in connection with the fights , and four others were arrested on probation violations , authorities said . &quot; We ' ve been having a problem with increasing gang activity , &quot; said Ventura County Sheriff ' s Cmdr . Kathy Kemp , who acts_as the chief of police for Thousand Oaks . &quot; Sooner or later one of these kids is going_to get killed . We have to send a message that that level of conflict and resolution is not going_to be tolerated in Thousand Oaks. &quot; About 50 deputies , probation_officers and police_officers from Ventura and Oxnard police_departments divided into teams and raided 10 homes at 7 a.m. as residents were getting_out of bed . No search_warrants were necessary because all_of the suspected gang members were_on probation , said Sheriff ' s Sgt . Bruce Hansen . As a condition of their probation , they must agree to be searched at any time by probation_officers or police_officers , Hansen said . No one resisted arrest , Hansen said , and the raids in the quiet residential neighborhoods took_place simultaneously so that no suspected gang members could warn others . Gang sweeps are part of a regional push by area police agencies that began in 1992 to crack_down on the growing strength of street gangs in Ventura County . Most of the sweeps have historically occurred in western Ventura County , where the gangs tend to be more numerous and violent , Kemp said . But even white-collar communities like Thousand Oaks are not immune to gang activity , said Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo . He noted that the multi-agency task_force has conducted several similar neighborhood sweeps since 1987 . &quot; Thousand Oaks does have a gang problem , and you have to make people see that this won ' t be tolerated , &quot; said Schillo , who has tagged_along to witness a gang sweep in 1987 . Schillo said he believes a rude morning awakening and unexpected arrests send a strong message to gang members . And he said Thousand Oaks residents strongly support gang sweeps because they want to see gang activity curtailed , he said . &quot; A lot of people move here from the San Fernando Valley and they want to get_away from crime , &quot; Schillo said . &quot; When they hear about gang activity , it ' s the start of something they don ' t want to deal with again . There is no such thing as a slight bit of gang activity. &quot; Thursday ' s gang sweep followed several fights that broke_out April 14 on Wendy Drive_in Newbury Park . The fights involved three different rival gangs , and occurred within 30 minutes of each other , authorities said . The first quarrel started when a carload of suspected gang members drove past the Newbury Park house and saw some rival gang members loitering in front . They exchanged words and shouted at each other before the carload of gang members drove_away . Then another group of rival gang members happened to drive by and got_out of their van to confront the gang members in front of the house , authorities said . After a brief scuffle , the rival gang members climbed back into their van and drove_away . Meanwhile , the first group of rival gang members returned with a gun and fired at least one_shot at the group in front of the house . No one was hurt by the gunfire , but some gang members suffered minor injuries during the scuffle , authorities said . A few hours after the fight , deputies arrested Brady Willmon , 18 , and a 16-year-old , both of Thousand Oaks . Willmon was arraigned Thursday in Ventura County Superior_Court on charges of conspiracy to commit assault stemming from the Newbury Park fight last week . He had been free in lieu of the $ 5 # 000 bail , but was rearrested Wednesday and accused of bursting into into a teen-ager ' s home and beating him . No charges in that second case have been filed , but a judge set bail at $ 60 # 000 for both cases . Willmon ' s attorney , Richard T . Ferko , denied his client has any gang affiliations , saying his client spurned the gang efforts to recruit him and had been targeted by them because of that . &quot; Gang members like to go_after big guys and get them to join their gang , &quot; Ferko said of Willmon , a former football_player at Westlake High_School . The 16-year-old suspect is at Juvenile Hall awaiting a court hearing , authorities said . The two other suspects in the gang_fights who were picked_up during Thursday morning ' s raids , were Tam Nguyen , 22 , and Michael Jay , 18 , both of Thousand Oaks . They were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon . Nguyen is also suspected of shooting at an inhabited dwelling . Jay made bail at Ventura County Jail on Thursday afternoon and Nguyen was being held_on $ 5 # 000 bail . Other suspected Thousand Oaks gang members arrested during the sweep for probation violations were : Caesar Roldan , 18 , on suspicion of felony battery and burglary ; James Balch , 21 , on suspicion of possessing marijuana ; David Hernandez , 24 , on suspicion of possessing of a dangerous weapon , and one juvenile for violation of probation .
