   <HEADLINE> DEFENSE ; NATO TURNS TO TASK OF FILLING WOERNER ' S SHOES ; THERE IS NO CLEAR SUCCESSOR TO THE ALLIANCE ' S LATE SECRETARY_GENERAL , WHO HAD TRANSFORMED THE POST . OFFICIALS SAY AN ACTIVE , INNOVATIVE LEADER IS NEEDED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As senior ministers from NATO ' s 16 member nations gather here today at a commemorative service for the alliance ' s late secretary_general , Manfred Woerner , they will start to address the crucial issue of succession . Although Woerner , who died here Saturday , had been fighting a losing battle against cancer for more_than two years , there has been little thought given to a successor . In part , ambassadors to the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization wanted to believe Woerner ' s own conviction that he had defeated the disease and would resume his full schedule next month . And with no obvious candidate , such debate was avoided as potentially divisive . For several reasons , the choice of a successor has never been more important to the future of NATO -- America ' s most successful and enduring military alliance : * During his six years as secretary_general , Woerner transformed the job from one dominated largely by thankless administrative tasks to one of genuine power . He laid_out a new agenda for NATO in the post-Cold War era , then lobbied effectively to get the backing of member states . * While Woerner was instrumental in defining NATO ' s new direction -- one that calls_for changed relations with the former enemy nations of Central and Eastern Europe , a strengthening of the European role in alliance actions and a new job as a U.N.-endorsed peacekeeper -- the alliance has taken only initial , tentative steps_in all three areas . &quot; We ' ve got a clear idea of what ' s to be done , but it ' s all just started , &quot; an alliance diplomat said . &quot; This is no time for a caretaker . We ' ve got_to keep moving forward. &quot; * With defense no longer the compelling issue it was during the four decades when a nuclear-laden Soviet_Union threatened the West ' s very existence , NATO governments today tend to be far less focused_on alliance affairs -- a fact that generates a power vacuum that can only be filled by an active , innovative secretary_general . Woerner used this new environment to develop and then effectively sell his agenda . If his successor fails to do the same , the alliance itself could flounder . &quot; Woerner made the job much bigger than it was , &quot; said a senior NATO official here , who declined to be identified by name or nationality . &quot; Whether this is sustained depends mainly on who takes over. &quot; The real search for a successor is expected to get under way next week after Woerner is laid_to_rest following a private ceremony in his home region of southwestern Germany . At present , more_than a dozen names float through informal chats at NATO headquarters , but doubt surrounds them all . Those most frequently mentioned include former Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg , who is currently attempting to mediate the war in the former Yugoslav federation ; former Dutch Prime_Minister Ruud Lubbers ; the European Union External Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek , and former Italian Prime_Minister Giuliano Amato . &quot; The right choice has to be a convinced Atlanticist , have a good feel_for the needs of Eastern Europe and be close to the European Union ' s attempts to build a defense profile , &quot; said Uwe Nehrlich , deputy director of a German defense think_tank near Munich known as the Ebenhausen Institute . &quot; None of these have all three. &quot; Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes ; his British counterpart , Douglas Hurd ; and former Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen are also discussed , but their interest in the job is unclear . Certainly , nationality will play a role . An American is ruled_out because the United States already holds the alliance ' s most senior military_posts . Luxembourg and Iceland carry too_little weight . The Turkish-Greek dispute over Cyprus would appear to rule_out anyone from those two countries , and another German is highly unlikely to succeed Woerner . NATO officials anticipate southern European_nations may stake a claim to the job on grounds that only one of NATO ' s seven secretaries_general has come from south of the Alps ( Italy ' s Manlio Brosio , who served 1965-71 ) , but this alone will not be enough , they insist . &quot; The job has become too important to go_to someone just because he ' s the right caste , &quot; noted one official . While opinions differ on candidates , there is unanimity on one issue : that a divisive debate resulting in a weak , ineffectual compromise choice must be avoided . &quot; The Woerner legacy is fragile , &quot; summed_up a senior NATO source . &quot; We desperately need someone with the perseverance and drive to keep us on our way. &quot; In the Running Ruud Lubbers , Former prime_minister , the_Netherlands Hans van den Broek , External affairs commissioner , European Union Giuliano Amato , Former prime_minister , Italy Thorvald Stoltenberg , Former foreign_minister , Norway</TEXT>
