   <HEADLINE> CAUGHT ON THE BORDERLINE ; SAN DIEGO MEN SAY THEY WERE FRAMED FOR CARDINAL ' S MURDER , BUT EXTRADITION TO MEXICO IS IMMINENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Any day now , the U.S. marshals will come for Tarzan and Cougar , two gang members imprisoned in the high-rise federal jail here on charges of killing a Roman_Catholic cardinal in Guadalajara . The homeboys from the Logan Heights barrio will be shackled , turned_over to Mexican police in a top-security operation at the border and then flown to a Mexican prison to stand trial . Recruited in an unprecedented alliance between a Mexican drug cartel and a U.S. street gang , prosecutors say , the suspects embarked_on an odyssey that is the stuff of gangster melodrama . It culminated last year in the airport gunfight in Guadalajara that left the cardinal and six others dead . Nine gang members have been arrested , all_of them young foot_soldiers in the Arellano cartel of Tijuana . They allegedly plunged into a gunslinging , high-rolling drug war with political dimensions far beyond the narrow universe of the San Diego gang known as 30th Street . The death of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo -- police say the Arellano gunmen shot him by mistake while trying to kill a rival -- shocked Mexicans . But 18 months later , the case has been eclipsed by raging political violence and intrigue . Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari did not mention the cardinal ' s death in his final speech to the country ' s congress recently , an omission lamented by critics who allege a cover-up of the killing . And the well-connected Arellanos have eluded capture , even traveling_to Mexico_City to proclaim their innocence at meetings with the Vatican ' s ambassador to Mexico . The murky political elements may never be clarified , but at the street level , there is no mystery : The popular wisdom has it that the alleged masterminds are at_large while the pawns are taking the rap . &quot; I didn ' t think I was going_to get involved in anything like this , &quot; said Jesus ( Cougar ) Zamora Salas , a melancholy 21-year-old . &quot; There ' s no evidence whatsoever that I shot the cardinal or that I attempted to shoot anyone at the airport . . . . I know they are going_to torture me . I know that . And they are going_to want me to confess to something , anything. &quot; In appealing their extradition as high as the U.S. Supreme Court , Zamora and Carlos ( Tarzan ) Enrique Garcia insist that they are scapegoats . They said during recent interviews that authorities are sending them to their potential doom using weak evidence extracted through torture of fellow suspects in Mexico . &quot; It ' s because of the neighborhood , &quot; said the muscular Garcia , 24 , whose shaved head and quick grin give him a cheerfully menacing air . &quot; We are all from the same neighborhood , so they picked me out of a crowd . I feel_like this whole_thing is a joke . The day I go_down there , it won ' t be a joke no more. &quot; Garcia and Zamora are products of a cross-border culture . Garcia was born in Tijuana and Zamora in San Diego ; both grew_up in working-class immigrant families in the hardscrabble Logan Heights enclave hemmed_in by freeways , warehouses and docks . Both earned high_school diplomas while running with the city ' s most violent Latino gang , police say . Garcia worked as a welder amid intermittent stints behind bars for drug possession , assault and traffic violations . Unlike Zamora , he denies gang affiliation . But he admits friendship with die-hard gang members such_as Ramon ( Spooky ) Torres Mendez . Torres , 25 , was arrested in Tijuana and admitted taking_part in the shootout . He died in a Guadalajara prison_cell last fall . Police first declared it a homicide , then ruled the death accidental , a bizarre reversal met with disbelief by the press and the public . &quot; I think he was beaten to death , &quot; Garcia said . &quot; It had to be the police who killed him . I guess he thought he could handle it . He was the type that thought he was tougher than everybody. &quot; Most of the evidence for Garcia and Zamora ' s extradition came from the statements of Torres and three others to Mexican authorities shortly after the cardinal ' s murder . Defense_lawyers presented testimony from family members that Mexican police tortured those suspects into implicating two_dozen gang members , many by street names . However , human_rights questions are beyond the limited scope of the extradition procedure , which focuses_on whether probable_cause exists for the defendant to be tried in another nation . Prosecutors responded to the allegations of torture by citing non-coercive interviews conducted in Guadalajara by FBI_agents , in which the suspects again identified fellow gang members . The Mexican attorney_general ' s attache in Los Angeles says Zamora and Garcia have nothing to fear in Mexican custody . &quot; They are going_to be very well guarded , &quot; said the attache , Miguel Ponce Edmonson . &quot; The Mexican state must respond for their physical integrity , especially in a case as important as this . We want to make_sure they don ' t even catch cold. &quot; Up to 30 Logan Heights homeboys were allegedly recruited by the Arellanos , three Sinaloan brothers fighting for control of northwest Mexico ' s drug empire . Some gang members were as young as 14 , but most were in their 20s . They drifted inexorably into organized_crime , police say , after outgrowing teen-age turf wars . The connection to the barrio was David Barron Corona , 31 , a gang veterano known by the deferential moniker &quot; Honorable Citizen. &quot; After serving time for a fatal 1979 shooting in San Diego , Barron resurfaced in Tijuana and became a trusted cartel lieutenant . He demonstrated his ferocity under_fire in October , 1992 , when two truckloads of gangsters dispatched by rival kingpin Joaquin ( Chapo ) Guzman stormed a Puerto Vallarta nightclub . The Arellanos fled as Barron fended off attackers , scooping_up the weapons of fallen gunmen . &quot; After that , they were making_up songs about him , &quot; a federal_agent said . A bodyguard told FBI_agents about accompanying Barron on an outing last year to a children ' s entertainment_center in downtown Tijuana . &quot; The center was reserved for the entire day only for David and about 40 of his family members , including grandparents , to celebrate the birthday of his 1-year-old boy , also called David. &quot; In contrast , Tarzan , Cougar and the others remained subservient henchmen , according to court documents . Barron and another veterano , Alfredo ( Popeye ) Araujo , recruited them in the barrio or at raucous Tijuana dance clubs . Their south-of-the-border duties allegedly ranged from contract murders to buying groceries to guarding palatial safe houses . Hired in February of last year , Zamora says he and about 10 friends earned $ 500 a week working a wealthy hillside area of Tijuana . He admits seeing rifles in the homes and carrying a . 38-caliber pistol , but says his only job was to clean_up houses and cars . He says he did not know his bosses were drug_traffickers . &quot; I had kind of an idea , but I was not sure , &quot; he said . &quot; They just said , ' You ' re going to make some money , easy money. ' &quot; A San Diego police_detective said the gang members were caught_up in an almost cinematic whirl of cash , violence and luxury . &quot; I think if they had known the predicament they were going_to get_into , they would n ' t have done_it , &quot; he said . &quot; But maybe it was like a big_game to them . You get people throwing money at you , you start thinking you ' re invincible. &quot; Curiously , the hit squad that went_after Chapo Guzman in May included gang members recruited only weeks earlier . Ramon Arellano , the youngest of the drug lords , allegedly led a dozen young_men to Guadalajara , where they were issued assault_rifles . Torres , the since-deceased gang member , told FBI_agents that it would have been the first time in his life that he fired an AK-47 . Garcia denies ever going_to Guadalajara , though he provides no alibi . Zamora admits making the trip and staying_at houses stocked with weapons . But he denies an informant ' s statement to the FBI that places him among gunmen who cruised the city in a pickup_truck , hunting for Guzman . &quot; Nobody said anything about anything , what we were going_to do or anything . We were there for a week and a half . Very quiet days . Then we got_word , somebody at the house says , ' I got tickets to go_back to Tijuana ' &quot; Zamora says he never heard of the Arellanos or Guzman and never imagined that the group planned to kill anyone . He said his lack of knowledge &quot; seems kind of weird , but it ' s true . It ' s like they want to keep you ignorant about it , like not to know_nothing , not to know any names. &quot; On the afternoon of May 24 , police say , Cardinal Posadas arrived in the airport parking_lot in a Ford Grand Marquis just as the Arellano gang attacked Guzman ' s entourage . The gunmen mistook the cardinal for Guzman and mowed him down in the front passenger seat , authorities said . A federal report described a &quot; maximum-security , well-organized &quot; ambush in which five carloads of weapons were strategically located in the parking_lot and a federal police_officer was enlisted to keep other police out of the way . Defense_attorneys question the official version ; they maintain that their clients are merely fall_guys . The confessions of suspects in Guadalajara indicate no plan for an airport ambush : They said that the mission to kill Guzman was called_off , that they were given cash to go shopping before the flight to Tijuana , and that the gunfire caught them off_guard . One henchman showed_up at the airport falling-down drunk . Another , Juan Carlos Mendoza Castillo , described seeing Barron and another gunman running toward the parking_lot carrying AK-47s , but none admitted witnessing the actual shooting of the cardinal . When the mayhem broke_out , Zamora says , he was already on the plane , which authorities -- in_league with the gangsters -- delayed on the runway to aid the escape . The idea that the rival gangs and the cardinal crossed paths by coincidence strains credulity . Many Mexicans reject the conclusion that assailants shot the bespectacled , 64-year-old Posadas , who was wearing black clerical garb , 14 times at point-blank range by mistake . &quot; It is infantile to believe that a professional gunman could confuse a priest with a drug_trafficker , &quot; editor Jesus Blancornelas of the Tijuana weekly Zeta wrote last year , suggesting that the slaying was a &quot; political crime. &quot; Guadalajara ' s new archbishop , Juan Sandoval Iniguez , has declared publicly that several eyewitnesses say the murder appeared intentional . He told Zeta recently that the probe has bogged down and demanded a credible explanation . Zamora ' s attorney , David Cohen , points_out that this year ' s assassinations of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and ruling party leader Francisco Ruiz Massieu bear resemblances to the cardinal ' s death . Young , working-class triggermen were arrested against a backdrop of drugs and politics in all three crimes , he said . &quot; The bottom_line is that someone must be held responsible_for the shooting and that someone ( is ) a number of gang members from San Diego , &quot; he wrote in an appeal of a federal judge ' s extradition order . Although authorities blame the Colosio murder on a lone gunman , critics allege a conspiracy of drug lords and politicians . In the Ruiz case , investigators have accused corrupt politicians with drug ties , but are still searching for the alleged masterminds . As for a motive , Cohen subscribes to the conspiracy theory that the cardinal was slain because he favored political reform and suggests that the young gang members were kept_in the dark about the real target . Conversely , others say the cardinal was somehow involved with traffickers . Barron and Araujo , the highest-ranking 30th Street members in the cartel , have not been arrested . The Byzantine conspiracy theories are largely irrelevant to Tarzan and Cougar , whose last hope is a long-shot humanitarian appeal_to the U.S. State_Department . They have steadfastly refused to cooperate with U.S. investigators . &quot; When you get arrested , you keep quiet , &quot; Garcia shrugged . &quot; There ' s no reason why I should be afraid as long as I ' m right here . I ' ll deal with it when I get_down there. &quot;</TEXT>
