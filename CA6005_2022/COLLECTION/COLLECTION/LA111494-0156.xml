   <HEADLINE> COUNTERPUNCH LETTER ; QUESTIONING PBS ' RIGHTS ' REVISIONISM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ervin S . Duggan ' s Counterpunch , &quot; Rosenberg Errs in PBS Criticism &quot; ( Nov . 7 ) , takes TV critic Howard Rosenberg to task for challenging public television ' s priorities in providing air time for &quot; Quiz Show &quot; while refusing to fund or distribute Charlayne Hunter-Gault ' s acclaimed human_rights series &quot; Rights &amp; Wrongs. &quot; The Public Broadcasting Service determined before we even went_into production that , according to PBS programming chief Jennifer Lawson ' s now-infamous decision , human_rights is an &quot; insufficient organizing principle &quot; for a series . Now Duggan has come_up with a revised explanation . He asserts that PBS ' &quot; programming professionals &quot; judged that our series &quot; did not treat the issues of human_rights as skillfully &quot; as we believed we had . This revisionism conflicts with what we were told . Those programming professionals displayed a persistent bias against human_rights as a subject , declaring it programma non grata from the outset . Only after a growing chorus of viewers , station heads and politicians -- 10 % of the U.S. Congress has written Duggan in support of &quot; Rights &amp; Wrongs &quot; -- were joined by respected critics such_as Rosenberg in ridiculing the PBS stance did Duggan come_up with his new rationalization . Obviously we have a disagreement with Duggan and his programmers . But so do many programmers within PBS . Earlier this year , more_than 80 PBS stations ( including KCET Channel 28 ) carried our series . And the MacArthur Foundation , George Soros ' Open Society Fund , the Aaron Diamond Foundation and others will renew support for a third season . We agree that &quot; reasonable people &quot; can disagree about PBS programming decisions . But it is unreasonable to invent new reasons for those programming decisions after the fact .
