   <HEADLINE> CYBURBIA : THE JOLLY GUY IS NOW ON LINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Having trouble getting your modern-day kids to believe that Santa comes_down the chimney ? Maybe you ' d be better_off telling them the jolly fellow gains access to the house through the computer modem . You better not cry , you better not fret . Santa ' s coming_to you , on the Internet . So it won ' t replace &quot; White Christmas &quot; any time soon . But your kids in this digital age might be more comfortable E-mailing Santa , rather than going the old-fashioned analog route of taking pen in_hand to write a letter . Yes , Virginia , this year you can write to Santa Claus on the Internet at three different addresses . They are santa.north.pole.org , santa.newslink13.com and santa.northpole.net. All three are supposed to reply promptly with a dispatch from the North_Pole . If you have access through your Internet connection to the World Wide Web -- which allows you to browse full-color graphics , sounds and even videos on the ' Net -- you can go another digital step further . Because the WWW offers so_much more_than plain text and makes the Internet far easier to navigate , it has become hugely popular this year . The big online services , such_as America On Line and CompuServe , provide only limited access to the Internet and don ' t yet offer WWW . But you can try it out if you use an Internet provider with a more direct connection , such_as the popular Netcom service or the Los Angeles-based Earthlink , which offers relatively simple-to-use Macintosh and Windows interfaces ( Earthlink ' s information line is ( 213 ) 664-9500 ) . The most entertaining and worthy WWW Santa site is sponsored by the Internet Multicasting Service , a nonprofit group that uploads public interest radio programs onto the Internet . At that address -- http : / / north.pole.org -- you can fill_out a form to send a letter to Santa , Rudolph or the elves . But the site goes much further , allowing you to click into little sound_bites of &quot; Jingle Bells &quot; or a reading of &quot; ' Twas the Night Before Christmas. &quot; You can also click into holiday texts by such notables as Shakespeare , Tennyson and Wordsworth , and learn about vegetation at the frozen north by moving_into &quot; Rudolph ' s Kitchen &quot; and reading whimsical recipes for such reindeer delights as algae newtons and moss snaps . Best of all , this site features a Cyberspace Christmas campaign that allows you to painlessly help several charities at this most appropriate time_of_year . All you have to do is click on one of the groups -- such_as Plugged In , an organization that provides educational and other technological services to low-income youth in the Silicon_Valley area -- and one of the campaign ' s corporate sponsors will automatically contribute 10 cents to the organization . Those small contributions can add_up to a significant donation . One of the sponsors , Sun Microsystems , has pledged to give_up to $ 25 # 000 to the campaign . So , click on the groups you like early and often . The other two WWW Santa sites are more commercial . At the Canadian-based http : / / northpole.net , you can post a letter to Santa and get various messages from the elves , but you are also given information on how you can get your very own &quot; I E-Mailed Santa &quot; button for $ 5 . And at http : / / www.neosoft.com / citylink , you are invited to browse the &quot; Santa ' s Christmas Favorites &quot; area where you can order such items as silk scarves and glass dome-covered clocks . ( Remember those from your Aunt ' s house ? ) Finally , if you don ' t have an Internet hookup and still want to have a bit of digital fun at Christmas , there is a new children ' s CD-ROM for the holiday called &quot; Follow That Sleigh ! &quot; It is compatible with both the Macintosh and Windows formats . This CD-ROM , with clay animation sequences , does not feature any breakthrough technology and is not particularly striking , graphically . But the rapping reindeer , backed by an enthusiastic chorus of penguins ( OK , so they do not exist at the North_Pole , but bah humbug if you care ) is charming , as are several other features on this games and activities disc . * Cyburbia ' s Internet address is Colker.news.latimes.com .</TEXT>
