   <HEADLINE> THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY AFTER THE SETTLEMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Saturday ' s settlement of the Microsoft antitrust_case , under which the software power agreed to alter some business practices , is not expected to have a dramatic impact on the software business in the short term . But even if Microsoft retains dominance in desktop PC software , it may have trouble extending its success to a number of new , fast-growing markets . Desktop : Microsoft DOS and Windows have more_than 80 % of the market for PC operating systems , which control basic computer functions . New Windows release -- Chicago -- likely to solidify Microsoft ' s dominance . Apple , with the Macintosh , has not succeeded in breaking_out of a narrow niche , despite superior technology . Novell ' s DR-DOS , a competitors to MS-DOS , could be aided by the settlement , but still viewed_as a minor player . In mainstream &quot; applications &quot; such_as word_processors and spreadsheets , Microsoft gaining_ground , but Lotus Development ( 1-2-3 spreadsheet ) and Novell ( Wordperfect word_processor ) still strong . Main battleground now in consumer applications , including education and personal finance software . Incumbents such_as Broderbund and Intuit -- and many small companies developing CD-ROM software -- face tough challenge from Microsoft . High-end Corporate Server Market : Microsoft trying to crack the IBM-dominated corporate computing world with Windows NT , advanced operating system for corporate computing and controlling networks of PCs . Sales disappointing thus far , but company has high hopes for new release , dubbed Daytona . Big Blue still pushing OS / 2 as a high-end operating_system for corporate PCs , and offers a range of specialized software for its large mainframes and minicomputer systems . Novell attacking here with new versions of Unix . Hewlett-Packard , Sun Microsystems , DEC , and Silicon Graphics have highly regarded server hardware , and mostly support some version of Unix along with proprietary software . All have high hopes for emerging &quot; video server &quot; business as well , where Microsoft is pushing PC-based Tiger system . Oracle , a database software company , also a player in video servers . Networking : Microsoft hopes NT will be its answer_for linking PCs , but faces an uphill battle against entrenched Novell Netware . Lotus ' s Notes product has defined a new category , groupware , for software that makes_it easy to collaborate across networks -- Microsoft yet to come_up with a reposte . Hand-held Computing : Microsoft hopes to set standard with WinPad software for pocket-sized , pen-operated computers . But Apple ' s Newton , though widely criticized , has thus far defined the category . AT &amp; T a big player here thorough acquisition of Eo and Go . Market slow to develop . Interactive TV : Battle for &quot; set-top box &quot; , computerized device that will control consumer access to interactive TV networks , has just begun . Microsoft ' s Modular Windows considered an inadequate solution , but company is working with Intel , General Instruments and others to build something better . Silicon Graphics developing set-top software for Time Warner cable trial . Apple / IBM joint_venture , Kaleida Labs , and game company 3DO also aspire to set standard on the set-top . Cable TV and other media companies have key role in selecting technology , many are suspicious of Microsoft . On-line Information Services : Microsoft plans to launch its own online service in competition with America Online , Prodigy , Compuserve and others . Will also attempt to provide much of its own &quot; content , &quot; -- news and other information , games , educational services . Every major media conglomerate and thousands of small companies have big plans here . Source : Windows Watcher newsletter ; Dataquest ; wire and company reports .</TEXT>
