   <HEADLINE> FIGHTING THE GIANT ; AS SCION OF THE WEALTHY TOBACCO CLAN , PATRICK REYNOLDS COULD HAVE HAD A LIFE OF EASE . BUT WHEN HIS FAMILY OF SMOKERS BEGAN TO DIE , HE HAD TO TAKE A STAND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Patrick Reynolds , tobacco heir , easily explains himself : &quot; I fight the tobacco_industry . That is who I am , and what I do. &quot; At a Town_Hall lecture last Thursday night , Reynolds , 45 , proves he has few peers in his chosen role of biting the hand that used to feed him . Casually , as if among friends , Reynolds straightens the jacket of his pearl gray suit , stands before 100 members of the prestigious current affairs group , and quietly starts to reminisce : &quot; My parents divorced when I was 3 . I didn ' t see my father again . At 9 , I was so desperate for his hugs and love that I wrote him a letter : ' Dear Dad , Where are you ? I want to meet you . Your loving son , Patrick. ' &quot; The letter reached R.J. Reynolds Jr . on a yacht in the South_Seas . The father eventually sent_for his son . Patrick flew in one of his father ' s private planes to an island estate off the coast of Georgia , where he was ushered into a darkened room . There , his father lay flat in bed , gasping for breath . Richard Joshua Reynolds Jr. , son and namesake of the founder of the great tobacco firm , was suffering from emphysema -- the result of a life spent smoking the Camels and Winstons on which the family fortune was made . Reynolds died slowly and painfully six years later , when Patrick was 15 . In the interim , there were a_few more visits , of increasingly shorter duration . Since then , Patrick has lost four more close relatives from smoking-related causes . His half-brother R.J. Reynolds III -- Joshua -- whom Patrick called a &quot; good buddy , &quot; died June 28 in North Carolina of emphysema and heart_failure . He was a heavy smoker of Winstons , Patrick told friends at a small memorial service he conducted in Santa Monica . * Reynolds has told his story repeatedly at universities , health groups , youth groups and corporate meetings around the country -- lectures for which his average fee is $ 3 # 000 . Immediately after last Thursday ' s talk , for example , he flew to address 10 # 000 teen-agers in Denver at an annual Seventh-Day Adventist gathering . He ' s a compelling speaker , partly because each time he talks the anguish is so apparent and sincere . And partly because he is , after all , a Reynolds -- scion of one of America ' s great fortune-building clans . His patrician profile , blond good looks -- the elegant , soft-voiced , delivery of a tale that could be straight out of &quot; Dallas &quot; or &quot; Dynasty &quot; -- are the stuff to make audiences gaze in wonder at what this man ' s gilded , turbulent life must be like . that ' s when Reynolds zaps them with reality . One out of every five deaths in the United States is_due to smoking . It causes more deaths annually than cocaine , alcohol , heroin , fire , suicide , homicide , AIDS and auto accidents combined . It is the single most preventable cause of death , disease and addiction in our era , and tobacco is the only product sold legally in the world that has a harmful effect when used as intended . The direct medical cost for each pack of cigarettes smoked is about $ 2 , he says . His information is from the American Cancer Society , the American Lung Assn . and studies by various government and prestigious private institutions . The statistics he quotes are not even controversial , says Joseph Cherner of Smoke-Free Educational Services , a New York-based volunteer group . Yet our elected officials refuse to do much about stopping the plague , he says . Reynolds wants action . For starters , he ' d like higher cigarette taxes , a ban on cigarette ads , and prohibition of the sale of cigarettes to people under 21 . &quot; Sixty percent of all smokers start by age 14 . Ninety percent are addicted by age 19 , &quot; he tells the group , citing figures from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services . Why the apathy , he asks ? It ' s easy to blame only the tobacco_industry , he says . But he believes that there are even more dastardly culprits . They are the elected officials who accept hefty campaign contributions from the tobacco lobby -- funds that give them a tremendous financial advantage over challengers at election time . Reynolds believes these officials won ' t ever vote willingly against tobacco interests because they would lose the contributions the industry provides . It ' s as ugly and simple as that , Reynolds says . And he ' s trying to gather citizens on his side to help stop it . The tobacco_industry is not amused . DeeDee Whitt , representative for R.J. Reynolds , says : &quot; Adults don ' t want to be told what to do , but Patrick wants to tell them anyway. &quot; Thomas Lauria , spokesman for the Tobacco Institute , says the lobbying group &quot; declines comment on Mr. Reynolds ' activities. &quot; Rep . Scotty Baesler ( D-Ky. ) , who debated Reynolds on &quot; Night-line &quot; last week , says , &quot; I represent the farmers out_in the fields . Tobacco provides 60 % of their income in our state . That can ' t be changed or eliminated without great hardship -- something Reynolds mightn ' t understand. &quot; * In 1979 , Reynolds divested himself of $ 2.5 million worth of tobacco stock inherited from his grandmother . His mother , a lifetime smoker , had recently died of emphysema and heart_disease ; his favorite aunt , Nancy , of lung_cancer and emphysema . He was fighting his own pack-a-day habit of 10 years , which he finally conquered in 1986 . One year later , he notified his brothers that he was about to testify on Capitol_Hill in favor of a ban on cigarette ads . &quot; You ' re gonna do what , boy ? &quot; asked his half-brother Will , worried that the publicity would make Reynolds stock drop_in value . Half-brother John , when told the news , worried that their father and grandfather would &quot; spin in their graves. &quot; And brother Michael told the press that although he didn ' t agree with his brother , &quot; Patrick is sincere. &quot; Patrick says that until his half-brother Joshua died in June , they maintained a good relationship by &quot; agreeing to disagree &quot; about tobacco . Reynolds ' first anti-smoking testimony in Washington catapulted him to a kind of national fame that has been more enduring than his sporadic attempts at an acting career , which he never pursued with as much vigor . He has appeared on virtually all_the major network and cable TV news and talk_shows , from &quot; Good_Morning America &quot; to &quot; Oprah , &quot; &quot; Larry King Live &quot; and &quot; Nightline. &quot; His dossier includes raves from media hosts , who frequently invite him back for more . And his numerous humanitarian awards come from the World_Health_Organization , hospitals , schools and civic groups . In 1989 , he started a nonprofit , charitable organization , &quot; Citizens for a Smoke-Free America , &quot; which he runs from his combined home and office on the eastern fringe of Beverly Hills . &quot; Our mission is to educate , &quot; he tells the Town_Hall gathering , and to eventually &quot; create a society that is totally smoke-free. &quot; But the shocker of the evening comes_after Reynolds ' talk , during a lively period of questions . &quot; Could you tell us how your organization works , &quot; asks a woman who wants to know how many employees he has , what they do , how they go_about trying to rid the world of tobacco . Reynolds pauses . Smiles . Rubs his forehead . Then divulges that he &quot; has no money &quot; for employees , that he can afford a secretary only on Friday afternoons , that he works alone out of his small house -- and that he is in need of funds to continue his crusade . &quot; I earn my living from giving these lectures , &quot; he says . Reynolds is not exactly poor by most people ' s standards , but he might have been much richer if he ' d kept his stock . He says he has spent about half his inheritance on the anti-smoking crusade , and he lives_off the interest on the remainder along with earnings from his lectures and various other projects . He never inherited a cent from his father , who left an estate valued &quot; anywhere from the tens of millions to the hundreds of millions , &quot; Reynolds says . His father , a pioneer in the airline and shipping industries and a onetime treasurer of the National Democratic Party , married four times . The first marriage produced four sons and lasted until he set eyes on Patrick ' s mother , Marianne O ' Brien -- a Warner Bros . starlet described by Patrick as &quot; an extraordinary beauty. &quot; R.J. Reynolds Jr . left his first wife and sons for O ' Brien , after a divorce settlement that was the largest in U.S. history at that time . Patrick was one of two sons born during their seven-year marriage , after which his father married a third time -- a union that produced no offspring . R.J. Reynolds Jr. ' s fourth wife bore him a daughter 36 hours after he died in 1964 . The daughter of that union , Irene Reynolds , lives &quot; somewhere in Europe , &quot; Patrick says . Patrick ' s father did pay_for his young son ' s summers at sailing camp in North Carolina . And for elite boarding_schools from the age of 9 , and for Hotchkiss preparatory_school in Connecticut , after which Patrick entered the University of California , Berkeley . He was raised like a prince but had no realm . A few , uncommunicative visits with his dad , from the ages of 9 to 15 . And one weekend a month with his mother , when he came_home from boarding school . &quot; There was no mirror for me to look_into , to ever know who I really was , &quot; Reynolds says . He has undergone psychotherapy , attended Adult Children of Alcoholics for two years and participates in a men ' s group where he can unload the accumulated grief . &quot; Once you grieve , you can heal , &quot; he says . He readily admits to scads of broken romances and a two-year marriage that ended in divorce . He wants nothing more_than to marry someone &quot; from a nice family &quot; with whom he can have children , he says . He would like to be the father he never had . Meanwhile , he says , he ' ll continue to battle against the industry that gave him so_much -- and then took it away .</TEXT>
