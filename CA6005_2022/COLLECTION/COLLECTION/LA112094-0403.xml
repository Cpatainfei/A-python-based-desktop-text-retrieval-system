   <HEADLINE> CLINTON READIES CENTRIST STRATEGY ; LEGISLATION : A RIGHTWARD SHIFT IS PLANNED TO RECLAIM LOST VOTERS , STAVE OFF HOSTILE CONGRESS . HEALTH REFORM WILL BE CUT TO THE BONE , ANTI-CRIME SOCIAL SPENDING REDIRECTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration will jettison , soften or delay a number of its more controversial proposals in an effort to respond to the election results and present a more conservative public image , officials throughout the Administration said this week . White_House officials insist that the changes are a shift in emphasis and a return to longstanding Clinton policies , rather than a fire_sale on Clinton ' s principles . But it is evident that the Clinton of the next two years will be much more centrist in his language and legislative goals than that of the first two years . Among the changes : * A sweeping immigration reform proposal , which was to have been delivered to Congress in January , is now being reworked and will be delayed . * Officials are willing to see some of the $ 6.9 billion for social programs in the recently passed anti-crime legislation redirected to fund more prisons and police or to give block_grants to cities to spend as they wish . * Whatever health_care reform plan is eventually presented to the new Republican Congress will be vastly narrower in scope than Clinton ' s initial proposal and much more incremental in its approach . * A bill to ban the replacement of striking workers , once a high priority of the White_House and Labor_Department , will be abandoned as a sure loser in the new Congress . These moves appear to mark a sharp veer to the right as Clinton tries to reclaim conservative and independent voters who have abandoned the Democrats in overwhelming numbers . A senior White_House official said a big emphasis for the remainder of Clinton ' s term would be the devolution of federal authority to local_governments , whether in crime prevention , job , education or public health projects . &quot; The election was really about the role of government and the voters ' feeling that Washington had gotten too big and too powerful , &quot; the official said . &quot; You ' ll hear the President speaking a lot about federal partnerships with localities , getting money and power right into local hands. &quot; The revised agenda alarms many Democratic liberals , who say they fear that the President will try to &quot; out-Republican the Republicans &quot; on a variety of social and fiscal issues . &quot; I don ' t have a problem with wanting to broaden the debate and wanting to reassess where you go as an Administration , &quot; said Rep . Kweisi Mfume ( D-Md. ) , chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and an outspoken advocate of liberal social_policies . &quot; But I fear that in their effort to gain the world , they will lose their soul . The last thing we need in this country is two Republican parties. &quot; Top White_House officials , under the direction of Chief_of_Staff Leon E . Panetta , are carrying_out an emergency all-hands drill to right the listing Clinton ship , a project some have dubbed &quot; reinventing Clinton , &quot; although it doesn ' t have an official title . One top aide involved in the effort said the recommendations of the group don ' t add_up to a sharp rightward tilt -- though some unpopular initiatives , such_as the initial health_care proposal , have already been tossed overboard . &quot; A lot of what we ' ve done is centrist , &quot; the official said , citing the deficit-reduction plan , efforts to streamline the federal_government and a redesigned school-aid program . &quot; A few high-profile items have been perceived as big government , like the health_care plan , even though the portrayals are not accurate . I don ' t deny that there have been some issues that allow our critics to paint with a broader brush the nature of this Administration , &quot; the aide said . &quot; Shame on us. &quot; The new Clinton , he said , would put added emphasis on already-passed programs that reduce the size and reach of the federal_government , as well as on initiatives with which he could reach some compromise with Republican leaders , such_as welfare and political reform . But the second_half of the Clinton_Administration will be defined as much by what it doesn ' t do as by what it does . White_House and Justice_Department officials have shelved a broad proposal to deal with illegal immigration , which was to have been introduced in January . The Clinton plan , while taking steps to reduce the flow of illegal immigrants and scale back the public benefits provided them , would not have gone as far as California ' s Proposition 187 , which would deny to illegal immigrants all benefits except emergency medical_care . Now Administration officials are rethinking their plan but have not decided whether to make the legislation more punitive or to wait and see what the Republicans propose . The likely House Judiciary Committee chairman , Rep . Henry J . Hyde ( R-Ill. ) , has already said he plans to introduce a national version of Proposition 187 , and there is already a bill , written by Sen . Alan K . Simpson ( R-Wyo. ) , to make_it easier to deport criminal immigrants , toughen employer sanctions and provide_for a nationwide system of verification of immigration status . Instead of moving forward with a new immigration plan , the Administration expects to be in a defensive position in January , a top Justice_Department official said . &quot; We ' ve shifted our thinking and planning to what ' s in the ' contract with America , ' &quot; the official said , referring to the Republican agenda to cut taxes , reform government and boost defense spending . &quot; We ' ve put immigration off. &quot; Administration officials also say they are willing to consider shifting some of the anti-crime measure ' s $ 6.9 billion in crime prevention money -- the most contentious element of the legislation approved in September -- to build more prisons , hire more police_officers and extend federal grants to cities . The officials are concerned that if they do not yield on the crime prevention money -- which Republicans said amounted to wasteful social spending in some instances and pure congressional pork in others -- the new GOP leadership might respond by reopening the entire crime measure , including its ban on assault-style weapons . Comprehensive health_care coverage has also evaporated in the hot wind of Republican ascendancy . Responsibility for drafting a new Administration plan has been taken_away from First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Ira Magaziner , the Administration ' s senior adviser for policy development , and given to White_House domestic policy adviser Carol Rasco and National Economic Council Chairman Robert E . Rubin , both considered market-oriented moderates . Most White_House officials expect that health_care reform ' 95 will be , at most , a modest package of health_insurance industry reforms -- which have already been endorsed by Senate Majority Leader-to-be Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) . On welfare reform , after spending the better part of two years painstakingly crafting a plan that would require welfare recipients to work after two years yet keep as_many of the strands of the safety net intact , Administration officials indicated that they are unwilling to start again and write a new plan . Instead , the Administration plans to reintroduce a bill very similar to the one it put_forward earlier this year , said Bruce Reed , the presidential adviser who has shepherded the Administration ' s welfare reform efforts . He acknowledged that the bill won ' t survive as written , given the new GOP majorities , but he said Administration officials decided not to change their proposal preemptively . &quot; we ' ll wait and see what Republicans . . . put_on table , &quot; he said . &quot; Some on the far right have philosophical reasons to want the Republican_Party to be the party of orphanages . I don ' t think that ' s the mainstream Republican view . . . . There will be considerable resistance to broadly unpopular and unworkable ideas. &quot; Labor_Secretary Robert B . Reich conceded that many of his legislative priorities -- such_as the provision to ban the replacement of striking workers -- will not be worth pushing_forward given the leanings of the new Congress . He said his emphasis will be_on implementing initiatives passed during the last two years and to consolidate existing worker-training programs . He also said his agency would strive to return money and autonomy to local_governments to craft their own job-training programs . At the Department of Health and Human Services , officials said they are not planning any controversial new initiatives , but sources said that in some areas -- such_as AIDS education and family_planning programs -- &quot; the tone may change &quot; to make them more palatable to conservative lawmakers . AIDS education has always been a hot-button issue in Congress , where conservatives have long opposed spending federal money on programs that they view_as promoting sexual_activity outside marriage . This may mean that the Administration will have to go_along with less graphic approaches that stress sexual abstinence rather than the use of condoms to reduce the risk of HIV transmission . &quot; We have to find approaches that are acceptable to a wide array of people , &quot; said Patricia ( Patsy ) Fleming , the Administration ' s director of AIDS policy . Food and Drug Administration sources indicated that they would push ahead with efforts to label nicotine as a drug , while admitting that new tobacco regulations will almost certainly be more difficult to achieve under the new Congress . The likely new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , Rep . Thomas J . Bliley Jr . ( R-Va. ) , has vowed to shut_down Congress ' investigations of the tobacco_industry , the chief economic force in his district . Top officials of the Department of Housing and Urban Development described the mood there as near despair , with the Administration unable to get major programs for cities and the homeless through even a Democratic Congress . One senior HUD official joked that the political appointees in the agency , Democratic activists who came_into government hoping to make a difference , are considering &quot; mass suicide. &quot; Times staff writers Ronald J . Ostrow , Elizabeth Shogren and Marlene Cimons contributed to this story .</TEXT>
