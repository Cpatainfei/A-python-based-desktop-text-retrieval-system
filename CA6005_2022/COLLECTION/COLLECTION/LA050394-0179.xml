   <HEADLINE> PROSECUTORS SEEK DEATH_PENALTY FOR PANAH ; VIOLENCE : ATTORNEY FOR WOODLAND HILLS MAN ACCUSED OF MURDERING 8-YEAR-OLD NICOLE PARKER ASSAILS THE DECISION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The attorney defending a Woodland Hills man accused of murdering an 8-year-old girl , whose body was found in the man ' s closet , on Monday assailed a decision by prosecutors to seek the death_penalty against his client . Deputy Dist . Atty . Peter S . Berman announced his plans to seek capital_punishment for Hooman Ashkan Panah , 22 , during a hearing in Los Angeles Superior_Court . Panah has pleaded not_guilty to seven charges , including murder , kidnaping and sodomy in the Nov . 20 death of Nicole Parker . Panah ' s attorney , Robert Sheahen , described the prosecutor ' s decision as &quot; insidious &quot; and &quot; evil &quot; during an interview after the hearing . Sheahen has said he will present a psychological defense . &quot; You have people in this county with lengthy criminal_records who are basically horrible criminals who are not subject_to the death_penalty , &quot; Sheahen said . &quot; For this young_man with no criminal_record and a history of mental hospitalization , it ' s outrageous. &quot; Berman disagreed , noting the nature of the crime and saying he views Panah ' s &quot; history of mental_illness &quot; differently than Sheahen . Berman said a committee of senior prosecutors reviewed the case and agreed with his recommendation to pursue the death_penalty . Police found Nicole Parker ' s nude body in a suitcase hidden in Panah ' s bedroom closet under a pile of clothes on Nov . 21 , one day after dozens of volunteers searched for her after she disappeared from the courtyard of the Ventura Boulevard apartment complex where her father and Panah lived . A grand_jury also charged Panah , who on Monday was clad in a blue jail jumper with his hair in a ponytail , with four special-circumstance allegations , including murder in conjunction with kidnaping , sodomy , child molestation and oral copulation . If convicted of any of the special circumstances , Panah could face death or life imprisonment without parole . A May 27 trial-setting date has been scheduled , when reports by two court-appointed psychologists assigned to evaluate Panah should be complete . Berman said a plea agreement in the case is possible , but unlikely . &quot; I ' m not that sure they ' re going to make us an offer we ' ll entertain . . . . This is a very serious case , &quot; he said . If a plea agreement is not reached by the May 27 hearing , the case is scheduled to be sent_back to Van Nuys Superior Courthouse for trial .</TEXT>
