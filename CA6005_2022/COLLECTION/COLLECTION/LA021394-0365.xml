   <TEXT> Aerial skier Trace Worthington of Park City , Utah , whose sport is an Olympic event for the first time here , is among those few athletes who don ' t think the Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya Harding story is overshadowing all else going_on here . &quot; I ' ve never been in this situation , so I don ' t know how it ' s supposed to be , &quot; he said. &quot; I think this is great . This is the first press_conference I ' ve ever been at. &quot; * Ski_jumper Jim Holland of Norwich , Vt. , has the highest regard for Norwegian Stein Gruben , the jumper who sailed off the big hill carrying the Olympic torch in Saturday ' s opening ceremony . &quot; that ' s a tough thing to do , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s tough enough just to do_it , but with the whole world watching ? I ' m not sure how big they would be , but the consequences of dropping it would make_for quite a scene. &quot; MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
