   <HEADLINE> OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS &amp; VIEWS ; MY TURN ; ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO ADVERTISEMENTS ARE BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLES OF HYPOCRISY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On flashes a commercial , with beautiful young_men and women having the time of their lives at a poolside party , each holding a can of beer . Every day in the media we are shown situations promoting the use of legal drugs , whether it ' s alcohol or tobacco . This glamorization of drugs is everywhere : on billboards , in magazines , on TV , on radio . The media are extremely powerful influences in our society , and we must stop their support of drug use if we ever hope to win the war on drugs . People get the message that using drugs can change their image by making them more attractive or popular . In women ' s fashion magazines , there are Virginia Slims and Capri advertisements with beautiful models elegantly holding cigarettes . This widespread promotion of tobacco becomes even more ridiculous in ads that actually portray athletic smokers ! One cigarette ad shows a group of men white-water rafting . The ad is extremely hypocritical : Smoking actually inhibits athletic activity by damaging the lungs , and leading to diseases such_as lung_cancer and emphysema . The &quot; Alive With Pleasure ! &quot; slogan by cigarette manufacturer Newport tops them all . It flies in the face of the well-documented facts about the hazards of smoking and how it shortens lives . And , as if nothing else in the world matters if you have your favorite beer , a commercial on TV_shows a man stranded on a desert island who is unconcerned because he has his Keystone Light . These ad writers are experts at their art . They know exactly what to do to make us remember their product . How many times have you caught yourself unconsciously singing that familiar &quot; Nothing Beats a Bud &quot; jingle ? What ' s even worse about all this advertising of legal drugs is that a lot of it is targeted toward children and young adults . The ads for Camel cigarettes have used an animated character , Joe Camel , that appeals_to young children . Even in the popular TV_show &quot; Beverly Hills 90210 , &quot; one of the main characters , Brenda , smokes . However , there is still hope to end this blatant support of drug use . Many commercials now promote a drug-free America by urging parents to talk to their kids about drugs . TV_shows such_as &quot; Family Matters &quot; and &quot; Roseanne &quot; address the importance of staying off drugs . Cigarette commercials have already been banned from television . It may take a lot of time and hard work , but if we are truly willing to abolish the media ' s support of drug_abuse , it can be done .</TEXT>
