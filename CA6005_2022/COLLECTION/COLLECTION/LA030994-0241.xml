   <HEADLINE> EAST VALLEY FOCUS : SAN FERNANDO ; OWNER ASKS ABOUT ABANDONING PIPELINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Four Corners Pipeline Co. , which owns an oil_pipeline that burst and caught_fire during the Northridge earthquake , has asked the city of San Fernando about its policies on pipeline abandonment , city officials said . San Fernando Public Works Director Mike Drake said the company inquired this week about abandoning the line . Although a company spokesman said there are currently no plans to abandon the line , the request for a copy of the city policy is the first indication that the company would consider shutting_down the line . Politicians in Los Angeles and San Fernando have urged closing the pipeline , which burst in eight places during the quake . The fire that followed the rupture burned just outside O ' Melveny Elementary School in San Fernando , injuring a man and charring 17 cars on Wolfskill Street . &quot; We routinely examine all options , but abandoning ( this ) line . . . is not a real option at this time , &quot; said Scott Loll , a spokesman for Arco , Four Corners ' parent company . &quot; However , we ' ll see what happens down the line. &quot; The pipeline , which runs_for 130 miles from Kern County oil fields through San Fernando to South Bay refineries , traverses just a mile of the city , but the line has become one of the hottest_issues in the San Fernando City_Council campaign . The election is April 12 . &quot; I ' m hoping that they are seriously considering abandoning the line , &quot; said Councilman Jose Hernandez at the council ' s regular meeting on Monday . &quot; That would solve the whole problem. &quot; Some of the groups opposed to the line are not satisfied with abandonment as a solution , however . &quot; If you abandon the line , it should be removed , because you have problems with old lines even when they are capped , &quot; said Michelle Grumet of Citizens Against the Pipeline and Pollution , a Los Angeles-based group . At its meeting Monday , the council approved a letter of recommendation to the state fire_marshal suggesting additional safety tests for pipelines . The fire_marshal has jurisdiction over oil and chemical pipeline safety , according to San Fernando city officials . Regulations suggested by the council include replacing pipelines over 50 years old and requiring yearly tests on those lines , instead of every two years . In addition , the council asked that Four Corners Pipeline Co . replace the ruptured pipeline with new pipe and that the line be buried at least 5 feet below the surface . MIGUEL BUSTILLO</TEXT>
