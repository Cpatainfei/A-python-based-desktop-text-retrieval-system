   <TEXT> &quot; Survey of Political Leanings Sees Third_Party Idea Gaining &quot; ( Sept . 21 ) not only shows that the theoretical base of the two major parties is weakening . It shows that the current &quot; left-right &quot; spectrum of the political map is hopelessly inaccurate . How else could it speculate that there exists potential for a new &quot; third &quot; political_party consisting_of &quot; seculars &quot; ( from the left ) , &quot; new independents &quot; and &quot; embittered &quot; ( from the center ) , and &quot; Libertarians &quot; ( from the right ) ? Would that third_party be &quot; leftist &quot; or &quot; rightist &quot; ? To be more accurate , political attitudes must also be measured by their slant toward more government control versus less government control . For example , most so-called &quot; rightists &quot; prefer less government control over economic matters and social issues but more government control over matters of personal morality . Most leftists tend to be the reverse . I must therefore object to your characterization of Libertarians as part of the &quot; divided right. &quot; Libertarians are neither &quot; left &quot; nor &quot; right &quot; because we prefer less government control not only in economic and social issues but in matters of personal morality as well . The Libertarian Party is already the third largest political_party in the United States , and growing , because it attracts increasing numbers of voters from all segments of the &quot; left-right &quot; spectrum . Instead of a new party being formed , a probable trend is that more Libertarian candidates will be elected . The reason is simple . More_than any other political_party , we stand_for the basic_principles of individual freedom and strictly limited government , eloquently defined by the Founding Fathers in the Declaration_of_Independence and the Constitution . These principles are neither &quot; left &quot; nor &quot; right. &quot; They are just basic . LAWRENCE D . GOLDBERG Executive Committee Libertarian Party , Burbank * In your Times Poll , didn ' t you forget the most important group -- the &quot; control &quot; group -- the top 1 % that runs this country ? This is the group that owns 90 % of the stock_market value and influences 90 % of the politicians , state and federal . Perhaps at one time this group had a paternal feeling for the poor and average citizen , but that seems to have dissipated . Now it ' s call_in the MBAs and to hell with social or distributive justice . JIM WRIGHT San Pedro * While I applaud The Times for an article on the possibility of the emergence of a third_party , I am as bewildered as ever about your consistent refusal to cover the candidates of alternative parties -- Green , American Independent , Peace and Freedom and Libertarian . The news media and the League of Women Voters do a great disservice in presenting to voters only one-third of their choices on the ballot . The voters ' media-induced misperception that Republicans and Democrats are the only game in town has caused the two major parties to become arrogant , unproductive and unresponsive to the concerns of their constituents . The usual excuse for this non-coverage and exclusion from debates is that the alternative party candidates get so few votes that they do not deserve to be seen or heard , but this lack of exposure is the main reason for their inability to get votes . Disaffected Republicans and Democrats already have alternatives that have been hidden from them for years . The Times should begin taking seriously its responsibility to inform the public about all candidates running_for public office . FRANCES LONGMIRE Los Angeles * Finally ! You guys are beginning to figure_out that the phenomenon of Ross Perot was not about Ross Perot ( &quot; Tired Political System Looks_for a Tonic , &quot; editorial , Sept . 25 ) . The scoop of the decade and you almost missed it . A relatively unknown man leads the polls for President after entering the race by popular mandate in only a 12-week period_of_time . That demonstrates a state of dissatisfaction by the electorate that is unprecedented . However you still hold to your conviction that most of us out here are incapable of dealing with our own destiny by posing the question &quot; Will Americans ' fundamental common_sense keep it in check ? &quot; Who better to keep our political_systems in check than us ? Please give us credit for at least a modicum of intelligence and responsibility . We , the people , are perfectly capable of directing our own destiny . However , I do commend you on finally seeing how large_numbers of citizens have had it and , in the words of Perot , are going_to take_back our country . We are not mindlessly going_to kick_out only incumbents but rather we are going_to replace the arrogant politicians who do not serve us and see us as only sheep to be manipulated at their will . Watch_out , boys , democracy is coming ! BILL GIORGI Brea</TEXT>
