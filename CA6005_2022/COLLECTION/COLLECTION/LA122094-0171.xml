   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA STEPS UP BOMBING NEAR CHECHEN CAPITAL ; CAUCASUS : KREMLIN IGNORES NEW APPEAL FOR TALKS . SEPARATIST ARMY ASKS NEIGHBORING REPUBLICS FOR AID .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian troops edged toward the capital of breakaway Chechnya and pounded its outskirts with almost continuous bombing Monday in a sharply escalating assault on the heavily armed republic as it pressed its bid for independence . Some bombs struck near the city_center . In the 24 hours after Chechen President Dzhokar M . Dudayev spurned Moscow ' s last offer of peace talks Sunday evening , the thunder of artillery and the crunch of bombs audible in Grozny , the Chechen capital , grew from an occasional explosion to regular booming . Dudayev issued a terse new appeal for peace talks , but the Kremlin ignored it . As the mighty Russian army and this tiny Muslim republic braced for intense combat , the Chechen military command appealed_to neighboring republics in the Caucasus Mountains to &quot; rise_up and repel the aggressor. &quot; One armored column pushed to within five miles of Grozny from the north after capturing the armed village of Petropavlovskaya , while a second column was bogged down in tank and small-arms battles in Dolinskoye on the city ' s western outskirts . As a heavy snow blanketed this oil-refining city , it was not clear whether those troops had received orders to move_in for what would certainly be a caldron of urban_guerrilla warfare . But after deliberately sparing Grozny ' s 200 # 000 people from air assaults , warplanes swooped low over the city Monday night and dropped at least two bombs , briefly knocking Chechen television off the air , setting four houses ablaze and destroying at least six others . Hospital officials said two people were killed and eight injured . Scattered bombs and artillery began falling on Grozny ' s outskirts early Sunday within minutes after the Kremlin ' s midnight deadline for the surrender of Dudayev ' s several-thousand-strong irregular forces . Russian officials in Moscow said Sunday ' s shelling crippled 16 rebel tanks and armored personnel_carriers , five aircraft , two artillery guns , a missile launcher and an ammunition depot . Warplanes and artillery also targeted Dudayev ' s family compound in the suburb of Tashkala and Grozny ' s electricity plant Sunday but missed . Instead , they scored direct hits on such objects as the muddy back yard of pensioner Yevgenya Pogosian . &quot; They don ' t know where they ' re shooting , &quot; said Pogosian ' s neighbor , Tamara Idriseva , whose two-story home had the post-earthquake look of shattered windows and cracked ceilings . &quot; They should just fight among themselves . They should leave us alone. &quot; Pogosian ' s home , where she had lived since 1984 , was broken_open like a dollhouse . Although Moscow has said it was not targeting civilian sites , the general fear that Russian raids have sown among Chechnya ' s population also had a tactical effect . &quot; What could be more strategic than demoralizing the people ? &quot; asked Musa Mirzhuyev , Dudayev ' s liaison with the Chechen armed forces . He said Russia ' s military aim was clearly the conquest of Grozny but warned that even if the capital falls to Moscow ' s superior might , that will not be the end of the war . &quot; Classical military thinking says that once you capture the capital , the war is over , &quot; Mirzhuyev said . &quot; But the Chechens have fought Russia for 300 years , and we don ' t plan to sign any surrender. &quot; Russian military analysts have predicted that Moscow will use special commandos in a pinpoint operation against Dudayev ' s nine-story presidential palace in central Grozny . But Mirzhuyev scoffed , &quot; The Russian empire never was capable of using a scalpel -- it always barged into other people ' s gardens with a bear ' s paws. &quot; The Russian escalation , launched after a government decision to &quot; activize &quot; its operations in Chechnya , was formally aimed at disarming Dudayev ' s forces , which the Kremlin refers to as &quot; illegal armed bands &quot; and &quot; bandit formations. &quot; But the Russian troops that poured into Chechnya on Dec . 11 had a clearly political goal : to bring the breakaway republic of about 1.2 million people to heel and break its bid for independence once and for all . Chechnya broke_away from Russia in November , 1991 , and played a dangerous game of brinkmanship with the Kremlin for the next three years -- until Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s patience ended and he instructed his Cabinet to do whatever it took_to impose Moscow ' s control in the North Caucasus republic . The mass entry of troops , Moscow ' s biggest military operation since the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 1980s , has united most of the Russian political spectrum and public_opinion against Yeltsin . On Monday , Lt . Gen . Valery Vostrokin , an Afghan War veteran who is Yeltsin ' s deputy minister for emergency situations , joined in urging the president to call_off the Chechnya campaign . &quot; To be the aggressor , a policeman on our own territory is not a good job for the military , &quot; Vostrokin told reporters in the Caucasus republic of Ingushetia , where he was coordinating relief efforts for an estimated 100 # 000 refugees from Chechnya . &quot; I think it is possible to solve this problem by taking_out the troops and letting Chechnya solve its own problems , &quot; he added . In Moscow , authorities prepared_for possible retaliatory strikes by Chechen guerrillas by parking armored personnel_carriers along Moscow ' s six-lane outer Ring Highway to reinforce police checkpoints . The offensive in Chechnya hit major snags at first when people in neighboring Caucasus states tried to block the passage of Russia ' s armored columns toward Chechnya ' s borders . One Russian column bogged down inside Chechnya when its commander refused to advance if that meant clashing with civilians . But by Monday night , Russian troops were closing in on Grozny from the north and west . Grozny residents , already weary from repeated nights of sleep broken by the thumps of bombing , had been informed of the locations of the nearest air-raid_shelters . Some were already spending the nights in their basements . At Dudayev ' s presidential headquarters , whole sides_of_beef and giant bags of onions along with the usual rows of bread loaves were stacked in the downstairs lobby , ready for a siege . One defender of the headquarters said Dudayev had run_out of guns to give his soldiers . Dudayev is known to possess several Russian tanks captured in an attempted storming of Grozny on Nov . 26 by anti-Dudayev Chechen forces_backed by Russian troops and planes . The Chechens are also reported to have large arsenals taken_over after the Soviet army fell_apart . But the typical Chechen unit probably resembles the small squad of bearded , red-eyed men sitting around a smoking campfire Monday 10 miles east of Grozny in the hamlet of Shaami-Yurt . Armed with a grenade launcher along with their personal semiautomatics , the Chechen fighters had finished digging their trenches and turned_to the more pleasant task of boiling a caldron of lamb meat . They had no official ranks , said Khusan Isabayev , the 34-year-old commander . And the squad had no real name or number except for its classification as a scouting and diversionary unit . For the last two weeks , they had been guarding this stretch of the Moscow-Baku road and had managed to shoot_down a Russian helicopter . What bothered them most , Isabayev said , was that Russian planes and helicopters would fly over them and go_on to bomb people ' s houses in neighboring villages instead of engaging head-on . &quot; The military site is here , &quot; he said . &quot; Kill me , OK ? But they send rockets and kill the villagers . They killed four people here. &quot; Times staff writer Richard Boudreaux contributed to this report from Moscow .</TEXT>
