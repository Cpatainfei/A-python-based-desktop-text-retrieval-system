   <HEADLINE> GETTING RID OF THE FAT ; ENCINO-TARZANA MEDICAL_CENTER ' S WEIGHT TREATMENT PROGRAM DOWNPLAYS DIETING , STRESSES MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS BASED ON EDUCATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Name a diet and Jody Keeler , a Van Nuys legal_assistant , has tried it . She loaded her shopping_cart with pineapples on the Beverly Hills diet , dined on little boxed meals on Jenny Craig , sipped &quot; shakes &quot; on a liquid fast , mixed and matched menu items on the food combination diet and selected from &quot; exchange lists &quot; on Weight Watchers . With each fad_diet and commercial program , Keeler quickly dropped 10 or 15 pounds -- and gained them back even faster . The dial on her bathroom scale inched past 300 pounds -- and at one point reached 350 . Then two years ago , a co-worker told Keeler about Encino-Tarzana Medical_Center ' s Weight Treatment Program . It didn ' t sound much like a diet . For one thing , participants are told it ' s OK to snack on an occasional Snickers bar , ice_cream cone or piece of pie . No one gets_on a scale . And , get this -- the group often holds meetings at delis , pancake houses and fast-food places . Keeler signed_up . Within a year she dropped more_than 160 pounds . Her dress size shrunk_from a 26 to a 10 . &quot; I have never weighed this low in my life , &quot; she said . Although Keeler ' s situation was extreme , she has plenty of good company in her struggles with weight . Experts estimate 65 million people in the United States -- including 60 % of all women -- are constantly dieting . American consumers spend more_than $ 30 billion a year on weight-loss products and programs . But despite the nation ' s dieting obsession , about one in five Americans is overweight . Diets fail , according to psychotherapist Debbie Rehman Lux , program director of the Weight Treatment Program , because they are usually restrictive and impractical . &quot; Diets try to change the location , time and quantity of food you eat , &quot; she said . &quot; But there is nothing wrong with volume eating , eating dinner standing over a sink or eating mashed potatoes or bagels at 2 a.m. You don ' t have to depend_on frozen foods or grapefruit and lettuce. &quot; Rather than advocating a particular diet , Rehman Lux teaches participants about fat and calories , so they can make their own decisions about what to eat . &quot; We learn how to fill_up with stuff we like , &quot; said Edward Scott , executive producer of the &quot; The Young and the Restless &quot; daytime TV serial , who dropped 20 pounds since joining the program last year . &quot; I like barbecue , so now I have barbecued chicken instead of steak , and I put fat-free ranch dressing on my baked potato . If I want pie , I scoop the fruit filling_out and don ' t eat the crust . I am_full , I am happy , and I am losing weight. &quot; Since dining out is a fact of life for many people , Rehman Lux teaches participants to analyze menus , and meetings are often held at local restaurants . At a recent gathering at an Italian eatery , the group chatted about hobbies , jobs and kids , while they munched on pizza and twirled spaghetti around their forks . They looked_like any after-work crowd -- except for the food scales , calorie books and measuring cups strewn around the table . Rehman Lux flitted among the diners , challenging them to guess the number of calories in a bread stick or glass of wine . She held_up a small dinner salad and pointed_out that it packs a walloping 350 calories when topped with a_few tablespoons of dressing , but the hearty vegetable_soup contains only about 75 calories a cup . Even pasta is a pretty good_deal with about 400 calories for a typical restaurant serving . No food is off-limits . &quot; There is no such thing as a ' bad ' food , &quot; Rehman Lux said . &quot; Many dieters feel so bad if they eat a cookie that they say , ' I already blew it ; I might as well keep eating. ' But a cookie is not_bad , it is just a cookie . We remove the shame and embarrassment associated with eating. &quot; Getting_rid_of the guilt was the most important factor_in Keeler ' s success . &quot; I learned to take the emotions out of food , &quot; she said . &quot; Before , if I didn ' t stick_to my diet 100 % , I would think I failed . Here , no one puts any judgments on me , no one weighs me . . . . But they did educate me . I still eat everything on my plate , but I learned to eat low-fat choices . And if I want a piece_of_cake or an ice_cream cone , I have one , and I don ' t feel bad. &quot; Where and When What : The Weight Treatment Program .
