   <HEADLINE> SHUTTLE IS OFF ON SPACEWALK , SCIENCE FLIGHT ; DISCOVERY : LAUNCH IS BRIEFLY DELAYED BY STORMS . LASER PULSES WILL BE BEAMED TO EARTH TO LEARN MORE ABOUT GLOBAL CLIMATE AND HOW IT IS CHANGING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The space shuttle Discovery and its six astronauts rocketed into orbit Friday on a mission that includes a laser show , the release and capture of a satellite and the first free-flying spacewalk in 10 years . The space shuttle lifted_off nearly two hours late because of thunderstorms , rising from the launch_pad at 3:23 p.m. PDT and piercing high wispy clouds as it arced out over the Atlantic . &quot; It ' s time to fly , &quot; said launch controller Jeff Lauffer . Discovery ' s commander , Navy Capt . Richard ( Dick ) Richards responded : &quot; we ' ll see y ' all_in about a week or so. &quot; Applause and cheers erupted from the launch control_center a_few miles away from the launch_pad when Discovery took_off . &quot; What you saw there was some relief from the frustrations we experienced over the past few weeks , &quot; launch director Robert Sieck said in a news_conference after Discovery was safely in orbit . Sieck attributed workers ' relief to the long wait this afternoon , uncertain weather and frustration over the previous launch attempt , which ended in the engine shutdown of another shuttle . &quot; It took some patience and it took some time , &quot; Sieck said . &quot; But like most launches , the harder they are to achieve , the better they feel when they finally go. &quot; Richards admitted he ' d had his doubts . &quot; We didn ' t think for a while we were going_to do_it , but you all came_through for us , &quot; he told Mission Control . During the nine-day mission , a $ 25-million laser aboard Discovery will beam pulses down to Earth and measure the light bounced_back from clouds , atmospheric particles and the planet ' s surface . Scientists hope to learn more about global climate and how it ' s changing . Long-term warming and cooling trends are linked to the amount of radiation trapped beneath or reflected off airborne particles called aerosols , and the pulses will help scientists measure the radiation . Each of the laser pulses emitted from the shuttle will be the width of a finger when it leaves Discovery but will spread to the size of three football_fields by the time it hits Earth . The round_trip -- 320 miles from Discovery to Earth and back -- will take just one-thousandth of a second . NASA said the fluorescent green lasers may be visible from the ground and will pose no danger if viewed by the naked eye or with binoculars or small telescopes . But amateur astronomers have been warned not to aim telescopes larger than six inches in diameter at the lasers because of the possibility of eye damage . The shuttle ' s crew of five men and one woman is also scheduled to drop_off a $ 14-million satellite Tuesday and retrieve it two days later . The satellite has two telescopes that will focus_on the sun ' s corona , the outer part of the solar atmosphere . Next Friday , astronauts Mark Lee and Carl Meade , both Air_Force colonels , are scheduled to test a new jet pack by venturing out into space without a lifeline to the shuttle .</TEXT>
