   <HEADLINE> SUMMER SNEAKS ' 94 ; THESE GUYS BLOW US AWAY ; WITH EXPENSIVE BLOW- ' EM-UPS RUNNING_OUT OF NEW TRICKS , SOME MOVIE_MAKERS FEAR THE GENRE FACES A TRAGIC ENDING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Renny Harlin , director of such adventure films as &quot; Cliffhanger &quot; and &quot; Die Hard 2 : Die Harder , &quot; has less than encouraging words for his line_of_work . &quot; Action movies are sort of the bastard child of Hollywood , &quot; he says . &quot; All the studios want them , yet somehow they appear to be somewhat disrespectful of them . Serious writers won ' t seem to touch them. &quot; Harlin ' s words are delivered without anger or bitterness ; he just speaks matter-of-factly , because , truth be told , he shares that ambivalence . &quot; It was a lot of fun to make , and it was exciting , &quot; Harlin says of last summer ' s hit &quot; Cliffhanger , &quot; &quot; but , ultimately , it ' s not a very satisfying way to live my life and my career. &quot; Perhaps surprisingly , that disdain for big-budget blow- ' em-ups is shared by many of his peers . This may be a pivotal year in the evolution of the action film . The Times spoke_to five leading action directors and one producer about the art of making action movies and other attendant issues , and all agree : The mega-budgeted , mega-noisy , mega-violent action film is about to meet an ending as tragic and predictable as that of a sidekick cop who loves his family and is mere days from retirement . In recent years , the same movie has been made dozens of times : Brawny , laconic hero , quick with a quip but likely haunted by some past tragedy , must fight villain ( s ) with an arsenal rivaling North_Korea ' s , an ethnically diverse army of ne ' er-do-wells , a prescient knowledge of hero ' s Achilles ' heel and a female hostage of psychological importance to hero . Things get blown_up for 105 minutes ; evil is vanquished as the chief villain is disposed_of in a particularly ghastly yet cathartic manner ; a chaste kiss from the woman is the hero ' s reward . &quot; Action films travel_to foreign countries well , &quot; explains Andrew Davis ( &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; &quot; Under Siege &quot; ) , &quot; because you don ' t have a problem with translating the humor , you know , the dumb one-liners they try to put_in these things ; there are no problems with nuance ( imitating an average moviegoer ) : ' Someone ' s scared , someone ' s bad , someone ' s good -- got_it ! ' &quot; But the formula appears to be wearing_thin . Last summer ' s high-profile and perhaps presciently titled &quot; Last Action Hero &quot; did a high-profile belly-flop at the box_office , and four action movies released this year -- &quot; On Deadly Ground , &quot; &quot; The Getaway , &quot; &quot; The Chase &quot; and &quot; No Escape &quot; -- have all performed well below expectations . Meanwhile , Davis ' &quot; The Fugitive &quot; and Wolfgang Petersen ' s &quot; In the Line_of_Fire , &quot; action films driven more by character and plot than by special_effects and stunt work , were among 1993 ' s biggest critical and financial successes . Judging by some of the action releases due this summer , filmmakers are trying to put a spin on familiar material . A strong female character , played by Susan Sarandon , will take_on the bad_guys in the thriller &quot; The Client , &quot; and Jamie Lee Curtis will battle evil side-by-side with Arnold Schwarzenegger in &quot; True Lies. &quot; Summer films by two first-time directors hope to evoke two of the best action films of the ' 80s : Alex Proyas ' &quot; The Crow , &quot; opening this week , is perhaps the most stylishly nihilistic thriller since 1982 ' s &quot; Blade Runner , &quot; while Jan DeBont ' s &quot; Speed &quot; will endeavor to mount the longest sustained kinetic sequence since 1981 ' s &quot; The Road Warrior. &quot; Even some of the typical boy ' s club adventure movies are aiming for something beyond the thrills . Richard Donner ' s &quot; Maverick , &quot; starring Mel Gibson , Jodie Foster and Jim Garner , offers more comedy than choas ; &quot; Clear_and_Present_Danger &quot; with Harrison Ford continues the sophisticated series of Jack Ryan films ; &quot; Blown Away , &quot; starring Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones , aims for some of the same character-driven cat-and-mouse appeal of &quot; The Fugitive. &quot; James Cameron ' s &quot; True Lies &quot; is also expected to capitalize -- like Steven Spielberg ' s &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; and Cameron ' s &quot; Terminator 2 : Judgment_Day &quot; before it -- on the advent of computer_technology so sophisticated that literally anything can be brought_to the screen . But none of this comes cheaply , and with budgets_for these films typically weighing in at $ 60 million to $ 70 million , before marketing and distribution -- &quot; True Lies &quot; is expected to weigh in at about $ 100 million -- they ' re no longer the sure-fire money machines that , say , &quot; Last Action Hero &quot; was touted as being . &quot; The problem is that while the studios want and need them , it ' s different today , &quot; says producer Mace Neufeld ( &quot; Patriot Games , &quot; &quot; Clear_and_Present_Danger &quot; and &quot; Beverly Hills Cop III &quot; ) . &quot; You have to face the actual costs of making them . We ' re constantly engaged in dialogues with the studio and the budget department on how to effectively control the costs in big-action sequences. &quot; In the last few years , arsenals in action flicks have grown increasingly larger and more sophisticated , explosions have erupted in an ever-more-extravagant fashion and , thanks to the improved clarity of Dolby-stereo sound_systems , all_the mayhem has become ear-piercingly louder . But there ' s something called the law of diminishing returns , which states that there is a point at which bigger and noisier simply won ' t mean better , and filmmakers feel that point has not just been reached but long passed . &quot; I hate it , &quot; states Donner ( &quot; Superman , &quot; the &quot; Lethal Weapon &quot; series ) flatly about the trend of effects one-upmanship . &quot; If it ' s gonna go_on , it ' s gonna go_on without me. &quot; Davis wryly suggests that the end result of the competitive trend should be a James Cameron-meets-William Castle scenario : &quot; The ultimate would be , the theater in which you watch the movie blows_up . &quot; There ' s a cap on violent movies , &quot; he adds , growing serious , &quot; and I don ' t want to be a part of it personally . How many car chases can you have ? I don ' t think it ' s a growth_industry , to tell you the truth. &quot; Says Harlin : &quot; Big effects and stunts are not the thing . That makes movies more exciting , but audiences have seen it all . In the future , story and characters are going_to be the key . &quot; In the ' 70s action movies , characters were very complicated , &quot; Harlin continues . &quot; In the ' 80s , though , things got_out of hand . It was all super-heroes , all muscle and gun power . There were loads of super-heroes . The Reaganite period created that , but that ' s dead now. &quot; Donner offers a metaphor to explain the action movie ' s own recent story arc . &quot; Years ago , stuntmen started to organize ( into unions ) and rightly so , &quot; explains Donner . &quot; They organized into two guilds , the Stuntman ' s Association and Stunts Unlimited . They vied against one another by being more daring , to_the_point where they did stupid things . People were hurt , and the situation mellowed out . In a strange way , that ' s what ' s happening with action pictures. &quot; Directors best known for their action films prefer not to think_of themselves in that fashion , nor to speak much about their peers . Few , for example , wanted to share their impressions of &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; preferring instead to discuss Stanley Kubrick or Federico Fellini ( Davis admits to having seen only one &quot; Indiana Jones &quot; movie ) . But they will discuss what they consider the most historically influential action sequences . &quot; The chariot_race in ' Ben-Hur ' uses an enormous amount of shots -- it ' s extremely artistic , there ' s competent editing , there ' s a very precise feeling , &quot; says Paul Verhoeven ( &quot; Robocop , &quot; &quot; Total Recall , &quot; &quot; Basic Instinct &quot; ) . &quot; That scene is one of the most fascinating ever made , one of the most musical -- though there ' s no music , with its rhythms , it ' s more like music than drama. &quot; Verhoeven and Davis also cite the car-and-subway chase sequence from &quot; The French Connection. &quot; &quot; ' French Connection ' was an important film for me , &quot; says Davis . &quot; I think Bill Friedkin was a gifted young director to make that movie at that time . It set a standard for reality in action films. &quot; &quot; I tried to work with rhythm that way in ' Basic Instinct , ' says Verhoeven , &quot; when the cars were following each other on the curvy road . It ' s not that spectacular if you analyze the shots , but what I was doing was bringing_in a certain kind of rhythm , getting the audience used to that rhythm , and then 40 seconds into the sequence , the autobus comes_in , and the rhythm changes abruptly . that ' s what makes_good action films effective. &quot; The filmmakers concede that at this point , Cameron ( who also has &quot; Aliens , &quot; and the &quot; Terminator &quot; movies to his credit ) has set the standard in combining computer_technology with breathless action and that &quot; T2 &quot; represents a pinnacle in action films that will be very difficult to surpass . Says Donner , &quot; James Cameron is brilliant . I would n ' t compete with him in a_million years . He ' s a provocateur in this industry , designing computer_programs I can ' t even comprehend. &quot; Several also offer accolades to John Woo , whose Hong Kong films &quot; Hard-Boiled &quot; and &quot; A Better Tomorrow &quot; are considered classics of the genre , and whose first Hollywood project , &quot; Hard Target , &quot; met with modest success . &quot; John Woo ' s movies have become a genre unto themselves -- the audience escapes into seeing over-the-top action , &quot; says Neufeld . &quot; Then , the gloves are off , you can do anything you want to do. &quot; Similarly , all who spoke had nothing but awe and respect for Davis ' exhilarating work in &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; particularly its spectacular train wreck . &quot; I ' ll never do a train stunt , &quot; says Donner . &quot; It ' ll invariably be compared to Andrew. &quot; Davis is clearly the man whose star rose the most in 1993 . He made a name for himself by converting 1992 ' s &quot; Under Siege &quot; from a typical Steven Seagal vehicle into a stylish and witty thriller , and followed that with &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; the second highest grossing film in the history of Warner Bros . ( following 1989 ' s &quot; Batman &quot; ) . The film received seven Oscar nominations , including best picture , and Tommy Lee Jones won the trophy for best supporting actor ( another impressive feat -- action films rarely reap such rewards ) . Davis parlayed that film ' s success into a financially and artistically rewarding exclusive deal with Savoy Pictures . Jones , a close friend of Davis ' who has appeared in several of his films , says : &quot; A great virtue is his versatility . He ' ll have scenes that have been planned for months , with a 15-camera setup , as smooth and as organized as any military operation . The next day , he ' ll kick you out on the street in the middle of the St . Patrick ' s Day parade with a Steadicam , and say , ' See you later , boys. ' It ' s a very energetic approach , and that ' s good for cinema. &quot; Davis says such flexibility is the key to making exciting action movies . Despite the precise conditions under which &quot; The Fugitive ' s &quot; memorable train wreck was shot , he says , &quot; You still leave a certain amount of room there . If something gets a little out of control there , which will create some spontaneity , it ' s important to be able to improvise . that ' s what gives it an energy and a freshness , because it doesn ' t seem so perfectly planned . If you storyboard a film and shoot just the storyboard , it ' ll feel that way . It ' ll feel too tailored and not spontaneous . Especially if things are supposed to be out of control , you don ' t want things to feel too in-control. &quot; Working as a cinematographer on documentaries in the late ' 60s and early ' 70s helped to imbue Davis ' work with an edge of gritty reality . &quot; Several times now , I ' ve taken real events like the St . Patrick ' s Day parade ( which wasn ' t in the original script ) and put them into movies as part of the story , &quot; Davis says . &quot; Because you can ' t buy that stuff , you can ' t re-create it , you can ' t capture it . I figured if we could get our two characters lost in the fabric of Chicago , it would really feel_like this guy was being hunted , and the frustration , the cat-and-mouse game would be that much more interesting. &quot; Of course , smashing_up a real live train -- or even crashing a parade -- doesn ' t come cheap ; few things do when it comes_to the blockbuster action movie . And while the filmmakers are unapologetic about the bloated budgets , they acknowledge some belt-tightening is in_order . &quot; For an event action movie , it ' s important to have a big enough budget to do things the right way , &quot; says Harlin , whose &quot; Cliffhanger &quot; is said to have cost more_than $ 70 million . &quot; The audience is quite sophisticated these days , they ' ve seen pretty much everything . So , to impress them , things have to be bigger , better and more surprising . &quot; Also , big budgets are often the function of big stars -- they ' re the ones who help make the tent-pole , or event , movies . Stars are extremely expensive , and machinery comes_with those stars , and that machine doesn ' t work without a high-octane fuel. &quot; &quot; I imagine there was a huge conversation over the train crash , &quot; Neufeld says of &quot; The Fugitive. &quot; &quot; It was likely bid out 10 different ways . Had they decided it was too expensive , they might have said , ' So , let ' s not do the sequence. ' And that decision would have meant that there would n ' t have been a point in the movie at which the audience breaks_out in spontaneous applause and walked_out_of the movie saying , ' Wow. ' It ' s that bite-the-bullet , let ' s-do-it sort of decision that can make or break movies. &quot; But Verhoeven says studios have become cost-conscious and may balk at certain extravagances . &quot; Jim ( Cameron ) reached the last possible balance ( on &quot; T2 &quot; ) -- spending a lot of money but making more back . If you want to do something as good , it would be extremely expensive to_the_point of being economically inconceivable . The motorcycle-and-truck chase in that film , the shots are so fantastic , and they ' re not done_in an easy way ; it ' s very complicated . The time to set them up and to get so many of them -- it ' s one difficult shot after another . In economic terms , if you were able to surpass that sequence if you spent another $ 10 million on top of your budget , you would not be allowed to today. &quot; Neufeld recalls a similar occasion when the price indeed was too high : &quot; We were_on a very fast track to do ' Beverly Hills Cop III ' a year ago . The budget was a horrendous number . We came_in , looked_at the budget , the screenplay and the release date and decided this was not a script we wanted to do . Sherry Lansing ( head of Paramount ) had just come_in , and we had lunch with her , and said , ' we ' ll do this , but we don ' t think the franchise or Paramount would be best-served by trying to shoot a release date rather than a film. ' &quot; The film was postponed . &quot; There was no margin for error , &quot; Neufeld explains . &quot; There was a lot of action , a lot of night shooting , on a tight schedule . One misstep could have turned it into a major disaster . Movie making and budget making are nowhere near an exact science . You have to give yourself breathing room , thinking room . Invariably , preparation and adequate post-production time make better movies and save money. &quot; Neufeld suggests that the cost of special_effects is becoming cost-prohibitive , but those vast expenses are necessary today to bring_down computer animation costs in the future . &quot; We cost out an action sequence both ways , &quot; Neufeld says . &quot; It ' s still very expensive . Are we really going_to blow_up a house ? A miniature is not really satisfactory . A computer can do_it very efficiently , but it ' s not cost-effective yet . But that could signify a renaissance of fantastic action , which is exciting in the future. &quot; But , Harlin warns , &quot; We ' ve had the breakthrough with technology . We ' re being able to create things in computers . I think now , audiences get the gimmick -- anything can be done_in a computer . You have the guy changing_shapes in ' T2 , ' you have dinosaurs , you have ( Sylvester ) Stallone hanging off a mountain . &quot; When you know almost anything is possible , things can get less interesting. &quot; A key aspect that can dictate the success or failure of an action film is the degree and tone of its violence . Each director has his own opinion regarding violence ( Donner , in particular , says , &quot; I hate those movies where you see gore and dismemberment &quot; ) , but even though Hollywood is now in an era when violence in entertainment is coming under_fire from Washington , each agrees that the director should have the freedom to create as bloody or as sanitary a film as he wants . &quot; ( When I ' m working ) , I ' m not thinking_about the violence offending or upsetting them , or causing copycats , like the Disney case ( in which revised versions of the the film &quot; The Program &quot; deleted a scene that had inspired fatal copycat incidents ) , &quot; says Verhoeven . &quot; The moment we say we can ' t do this in a movie , because someone might copy it , then we have failed as filmmakers . We should not engage in self-censorship. &quot; &quot; The tone ( for the violence ) usually comes_with the star , and what works best for them , &quot; says Harlin . &quot; With Bruce Willis , the best movie winks_at you . For Stallone , it ' s better if you ' re more serious , truly emotional . Action stars seem to have an aura , or an image , that the movie consequently inherits. &quot; Harlin says finding the right degree of blood and guts can be a crap shoot . &quot; I ' ve had interesting results at test screenings . We interviewed a core_group after a ' Cliffhanger ' screening , and asked them who thought it was too violent , and about half the group raised their hands . Then we asked who thought it wasn ' t violent enough , and the other half of the group raised their hands. &quot; Two directors from foreign soil , the_Netherlands ' Verhoeven and Hong Kong ' s Woo , have found that unique sensibilities that serve them well in their homelands can get them into trouble with the Motion_Picture Assn . of America , which has slapped several of their films with Xs or NC-17s . &quot; It ' s frustrating ; they don ' t care what the real purpose of your film is , &quot; says Woo . &quot; They look_at everybody all_the same . We fought so hard for an R . My kind of action -- that cartoon , comic-book violence -- amuses and appeases audiences . You try to make them understand that my kind of action is pretty artistic , like dancing . But they just don ' t care. &quot; &quot; It ' s a horrible process ; no director would like to go_through it , &quot; agrees Verhoeven . And even though his films &quot; Total Recall &quot; and &quot; Basic Instinct &quot; pushed the MPAA ' s R rating to its absolute limits with their violence and sexual material , he insists , &quot; I haven ' t been trying to test the MPAA ' s boundaries , this just started when I began working in the American market . I just shoot it , and that ' s what I get . My European upbringing gives me a certain sensibility regarding sex and violence that simply is not corresponding with the MPAA ' s guidelines on movie content . &quot; People think I ' m pushing the envelope on purpose , but , really , it ' s by accident. &quot; Woo admits , however , that he doesn ' t consider the tone of a violent sequence when shooting it . &quot; They ' re based on feeling , like a painter . I usually put myself into the character ' s mood , walk through it like the character would , and choreograph it myself . If , in a scene , the character is fighting for his life , he will fight very hard . &quot; I ' m concerned with beauty , the camera movement , the body movement , the editing and the rhythm . If I feel the whole scene , in perfect timing , when I feel right , I go_for it . There ' s so_much to think_about -- I see myself like a wild_horse running here and there , out of control. &quot; Showing a poster in his office , signed by fans at a premiere of one of his films ( one of the messages reads , &quot; I never saw a film w / so many people getting killed ! &quot; ) , Woo admits that his hard-core fans are afraid that the one-two punch of Hollywood and the MPAA may dilute his -- or any filmmaker ' s -- style . Woo says , &quot; In Hong Kong , I wrote my own scripts and put my own feelings into them . In Hollywood , in ' Hard Target , ' it wasn ' t my script . It ' s complicated -- the original script was good , but so many people at the studio got involved , and the script was changing , changing , changing . ( The end result ) wasn ' t as_good_as it was originally . &quot; I have to be more patient , &quot; Woo admits . &quot; The system won ' t change , and the studio invests a lot of money in these projects , so they must be careful . So , so many people try to control the proceedings . But in the meantime , you waste a lot of time and energy. &quot; The degree of violence , it should never be forgotten , is also dictated by the viability of the stunts described in the script . Safety on the set , tragically , again became an issue last year when Brandon Lee was killed by a prop gun while performing what should have been a routine stunt in &quot; The Crow. &quot; Scripts can become problematic with their lurid descriptions of action , according to Neufeld . &quot; The writer is basically trying to please the producer and the studio . He ' s making what ' s on the page exciting and will most often describe action that ' s virtually impossible or foolhardy to execute. &quot; &quot; A lot of stunt people don ' t like me , &quot; says Donner . &quot; I think we ' re illusionists , I like to create the magic steeped in total safety and trickery . I pull ( stunt people ) back . I don ' t believe_in hurting animals or people for a movie . &quot; Action films are more about disciplining other people more_than yourself . On ' ( Lethal Weapon ) 3 , ' on the very first shot , there was a lack of communication between two stunt_men in the car chase , and I heard this terrible ( expletive ) explosion , &quot; Donner recalls . &quot; Two cars hit one another head-on , right at the beginning . Thank God no one was hurt ; there was a sprained ankle . But that was lucky -- lucky not because of the accident , but because it set the tone for the movie immediately . Once I saw everyone was OK , I went ballistic . That changed the attitude for the whole film . It was important , because they all knew if something else happened , I ' d kill ' em if they didn ' t do_it themselves. &quot; On the other hand , Woo likes testing the boundaries of his performers . &quot; For example , in ' Hard-Boiled , ' Chow Yun-Fat is holding a baby and running_through a narrow corridor in the final sequence , and there are seven , eight bombs going_off beside and behind him . He ' s running toward the camera . On the first take , the stunt coordinator tried to stop me -- he didn ' t want the actor to get hurt . But I thought if it happened close to the actor , it would be more exciting , the audience would feel the danger more . The special_effects guy said , ' No , it ' s too dangerous. ' &quot; But I prevailed , and I cued the special_effects guy when to set_off the explosions , and the actor didn ' t know that they were going_to be so close , &quot; Woo recalls . &quot; His hair got a little singed , it looked_like he was really running_for his life in that situation . It looked realistic , and that ' s important to get the audience to feel the same way , to worry about him . &quot; He said , ' Jesus ! ' afterward , because of his hair , but he wasn ' t mad at me . He just asked , ' Was the shot OK ? ' &quot; &quot; Generally , our action has got_to be motivated by the story , &quot; Neufeld says . &quot; We ' re currently in the middle of discussions over whether to eliminate or include an action sequence in ' Clear and Present Danger. ' We ' re asking ourselves , ' Does_it push the story forward ? Can we do_it in a way that has not been done or seen before ? And if not , why do_it ? ' &quot; The most dangerous thing when developing a script is to look_at it and say , ' There haven ' t been any action sequences for 20 pages , ' and then go plunk one in , &quot; Neufeld concludes . &quot; Action should be the icing on the cake rather than the heart and soul of the movie . Because if that icing turns sour , it ruins the whole cake. &quot; All agree that what making quality action flicks boils_down to is -- surprise -- finding decent scripts with interesting characters . This summer ' s schedule suggests that , in some areas , it ' s testosterone-laced business as usual : Jeff Bridges will hunt_down mad bomber Tommy Lee Jones in &quot; Blown Away &quot; ( which is also the plot for the upcoming &quot; Die Hard 3 &quot; ) ; at least two action flicks will concern themselves with vengeful sky diving ( &quot; Terminal_Velocity &quot; and &quot; Drop_Zone &quot; ) , and Eddie Murphy is back in a &quot; Die Hard &quot; -in-an-amusement-park scenario with &quot; Beverly Hills Cop III. &quot; Harlin says he turned_down &quot; Cliffhanger &quot; twice before finally relenting and doing the picture . &quot; The script was originally very simple -- the dialogue was all along the lines of ' Let ' s go ! ' and ' Look_out ! ' &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s frustrating when you have the tools and money to make a movie -- and if you just had the material , it could be really great. &quot; ( Harlin ' s dissatisfaction with the action genre seems sincere -- the only movie poster up in his office is for &quot; Rambling Rose , &quot; which he produced -- but days after he was interviewed , it was announced that his next project would be producing &quot; American Gladiators : The Movie. &quot; ) Donner says , &quot; With the first ' Lethal , ' the relationship was what the movie was all about . With the second , the buddy / action movie had all been done before , so we gave it a wild sense_of_humor , we decided to have fun with it . . . . Any action has to surround Mel and Danny ( Glover ) , it has to complement them . If you do lots of action , you ' re ignoring them , you ' re not using them to their greatest advantage. &quot; &quot; No matter how imaginative you are with the action , if you ' re not invested with the characters and the stories , it doesn ' t mean anything , &quot; Davis concurs . &quot; There ' s probably some incredible sequences that you have never seen in B-action movies that are really good , the explosions , the danger , but no one talks_about them because the rest of the movie is junk. &quot; &quot; Excitement doesn ' t come from money , it comes from an idea , emotions and feeling , &quot; says Woo . &quot; Sometimes you ' ll put a lot of money into an action scene , but the audience feels nothing -- ' Oh , another car blew_up . Hmm. ' You sort of get numb to it . And I won ' t do that . It ' s not worth it . Action films need to emphasize character , heart and soul. &quot; Fast Action Heroes If you want adventure , who you gonna call ?
