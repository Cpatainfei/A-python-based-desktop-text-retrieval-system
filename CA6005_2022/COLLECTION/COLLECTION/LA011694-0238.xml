   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CLINTON TRIP HELPS YELTSIN ' S IMAGE , HURTS ZHIRINOVSKY ; RUSSIA : BUT UNLESS THE COUNTRY ' S PRESIDENT ACTS_OUT HIS ROLE MORE CONVINCINGLY , THE IMPACT OF THE SUMMIT COULD BE SHORT-LIVED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A month ago , Russia ' s image as a fledgling democracy and partner with the West was shattered . Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , having stunned the world with a strong finish in parliamentary elections , was venting militarist dreams of a restored Russian empire . President Boris N . Yeltsin was in seclusion . Last week , Yeltsin was back in the spotlight , appearing with President Clinton at the Kremlin . Clinton was_on Russian television , praising his summit host as a leader &quot; willing to wade into the tides of history and make decisions. &quot; Zhirinovsky was off camera , his face bloodied from a fistfight over a place in_line at the Parliament cafeteria . Clinton ' s three-day visit , which ended Saturday , gave the Russian president what he needed badly : a restored picture , at_home and abroad , that Yeltsin is the one in_charge here , a reformist ally valued by the world ' s remaining superpower , and that Zhirinovsky is little more_than a neo-fascist pest . Yet unless Yeltsin manages to act_out that role more convincingly , the impact of the summit could be short-lived . The help Clinton offered -- U.S. markets opening_up to Russian uranium , a faster flow of Western credits already promised -- is modest . Neither side expects fast relief from the economic pain that helped Zhirinovsky ' s party sway 23 % of the voters . &quot; Clinton ' s visit diminished the role of Zhirinovsky , &quot; said Irina G . Popova , a social_anthropologist and historian at the Russian Academy of Sciences . &quot; The summit was arranged to look very businesslike , so that Boris would be viewed differently , not as a weak man but as one respected by world leaders. &quot; If presidential elections were held now instead of 1996 , when they are scheduled , &quot; Yeltsin would certainly get more votes than Zhirinovsky , &quot; she said . &quot; But two years is an eternity here. &quot; The suddenly imaginable scenario of an aggressive nationalist in control of Russia ' s nuclear codes has intensified debate over what , if anything , the West can do to diminish his appeal . After two years of tumultuous unraveling of Russia ' s militarized command economy , the politically correct answer here is that only Russians can decide what kind of country they want . &quot; Zhirinovsky is a typically Russian phenomenon , &quot; Yeltsin spokesman Vyacheslav V . Kostikov said in an interview . &quot; Foreign political remedies to inoculate Russia from this disease will not help . Russia will take_care of itself. &quot; But without once mentioning the &quot; Z-word &quot; in public , Clinton moved_on several fronts during the summit to help Yeltsin isolate his rival . The summit featured an agreement among Russia , Ukraine and the United States to transfer all former Soviet nuclear_warheads on Ukraine ' s territory to Russia within seven years . The deal , brokered by the Clinton_Administration , would satisfy the Russian nationalist aim of making Russia the sole nuclear_power among the former Soviet republics . Russia and the United States also agreed , along with Ukraine , to redirect their nuclear missiles away from any country by May 30 . Together the two accords conjured_up an image -- nostalgic for Russian nationalists , healthy for Yeltsin -- of two great military powers meeting to decide the fate of the world . To answer Zhirinovsky ' s complaint that Moscow is being bled by economic subsidies to Ukraine and other new states of its former empire , Yeltsin won Clinton ' s pledge to direct part of a Western aid package to help those &quot; near abroad &quot; countries buy Russian oil and gas at world prices . Clinton carefully indulged Yeltsin ' s effort to portray Russia as an equal . He nodded while the Russian leader used the words partnership and partner six times in a five-minute statement at the start of Friday ' s joint news_conference . And he listened passively while Yeltsin stressed Russia ' s independent foreign_policy -- notably its sharp disagreement with Clinton ' s goal to admit East European_nations into the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization . Clinton ' s most dramatic and apparently effective weapon was a campaign-style &quot; town_hall &quot; meeting in which he defended Yeltsin ' s reforms and answered audience questions on live Russian television . Expressing empathy for the many Russians hurt by inflation , crime and joblessness on the uncharted course to a free market , he promised &quot; light at the end of this long tunnel. &quot; But Clinton came_with no new money to finance the &quot; social safety net &quot; of unemployment insurance , subsidized health_care and job retraining programs that Russian reformers now say is crucial . Without such efforts , they cannot overcome resistance from Zhirinovsky , Communists and centrist political forces to the idea of shutting_down big money-losing factories as a way to combat inflation . Yeltsin ' s refurbished post-summit image could help , however , by coaxing some funds from international lending agencies and Western nations . Yeltsin ' s government is divided over how hard to squeeze the ruble supply in_order to qualify for their aid . But Yeltsin ' s rhetorical commitment to Clinton last week to maintain the pace of reform could free up a long-delayed $ 1.5-billion credit from the International Monetary Fund . Confident of more hard_times , Zhirinovsky predicted last week that Clinton ' s diplomacy was doomed . He said the American President had done him a favor by refusing to meet him in Moscow . But Zhirinovsky ' s influence may already be waning . Before his fistfight , he threw a temper tantrum in the Duma , the lower house of Parliament , that apparently cost him a chance to become Speaker . Even so , Yeltsin will have a hard_time with the Duma . It is split about 50-50 between reform and anti-reform forces , but the anti-reformers have been more adept at alliances . As Yeltsin was assuring Clinton on Friday that economic reform would continue , the Duma elected a Communist as its Speaker .
