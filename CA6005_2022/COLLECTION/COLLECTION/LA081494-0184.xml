   <HEADLINE> THOM GUNN ' S SENSE OF MOVEMENT ; HE LEFT ENGLAND A GENERATION AGO TO SEEK A NEW LIFE IN THE BAY AREA . TODAY HIS AUSTERE POEMS OF LOVE AND DEATH HAVE PUT HIM IN THE FOREFRONT OF AMERICAN POETRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I got the idea for these poems from Patricia Highsmith ' s wonderful article about Jeffrey Dahmer . What fascinated me -- this stood_out in the article -- was that Dahmer got this feeling , ' I ' m never going_to see him again , the most important_person in my life , ' about the guy he had known for only 20 minutes , who was getting ready to leave . So he came_up behind him and killed him . I mean , if you want to possess somebody , what better way than to kill them ? &quot; Thom Gunn and I are sitting in a San Francisco restaurant , talking_about his Jeffrey Dahmer poems , a sequence of four published under the title &quot; Troubadour. &quot; The poems , in somewhat gruesome detail , contemplate Dahmer ' s murderous acts from the killer ' s point_of_view . &quot; I rather like upsetting people , &quot; Gunn admits . &quot; I ' ve always had a childish desire to shock . But I didn ' t really think those poems would upset people as much as they did . They weren ' t conceived_of as being about somebody crazy , but about someone who experiences the things we do , only in more extreme form . I think_of them as love poems. &quot; He published the Dahmer poems shortly after winning a MacArthur Fellowship in 1993 . Perhaps , I suggest , he wanted to show that he was still allied_with the &quot; undesirables &quot; ( as he titled a book of poems about street people , derelicts and other marginal types ) . Perhaps he felt guilty about winning America ' s biggest literary prize . &quot; No , &quot; he says flatly . &quot; I don ' t feel at all guilty about the MacArthur . I do feel guilty about having a house whenever I pass_by street people . But doesn ' t everyone feel that way ? &quot; There is something boyishly charming about Thom Gunn ' s assumption that everyone is exactly like him . But then , there is something boyishly charming about Thom Gunn in_general . Though he will be 65 on his next birthday , he is still thin and energetic , bounding_up and down two flights of stairs at a moment ' s notice to retrieve a forgotten jacket or fetch a spare copy of a poem . His face is strongly lined , and his hair is in transition from black to gray ( about the stage of Richard Gere ' s in &quot; Internal Affairs , &quot; a movie Gunn much admires ) , but with his earring , tattoo , T-shirts and jeans , he conveys the impression of someone who has never really aged . Even his laugh is sudden , open , childishly joyful -- as well as loud enough to triumph over the din at any restaurant in San Francisco , his home since 1961 . Thom Gunn has always had a big , loud laugh . Karl Miller , a classmate at Cambridge_University in the early 1950s ( later the founder of the London Review of Books ) , wrote_of those Cambridge days : &quot; A great pleasure of the place was to watch Thom Gunn , of the sounding , crashing laugh and lumberjack shirts , become a poet. &quot; The lumberjack shirts have long since been discarded , and the process of becoming a poet has been satisfyingly , definitively accomplished , but the laugh remains . And these days , with the recent MacArthur fellowship and his &quot; Collected Poems &quot; just out , Gunn has a lot to laugh about . The level of fame is new , but the spotlight has been_on Thom Gunn from a relatively early age . By the time he was 25 , he had published his first book , &quot; Fighting Terms , &quot; and had been welcomed into the company of a new generation of British poets that included Philip Larkin , Donald Davie and Britain ' s current poet_laureate , Ted Hughes . In 1989 , a prominent critic putting_together a book about British poetry since 1960 kept noticing &quot; how insistently Thom Gunn shouldered to centre stage. &quot; At least a_few Gunn poems made_it into virtually every anthology of contemporary British verse , and some were even included in the standard O-level and A-level tests that determined a student ' s passage from secondary_school to university . If you know a privately educated Englishman of a certain age -- say , 35 to 60 -- he will likely be able to recite from memory at least a_few lines by Thom Gunn , the likeliest being a passage from the famous &quot; On the Move. &quot; The lead poem in his second collection , &quot; The Sense_of_Movement &quot; ( 1957 ) , &quot; On the Move &quot; describes an alluringly ominous group of Hells-Angels-like bikers : &quot; On motorcycles , up the road , they come : Small , black , as flies hanging_in heat , the Boys . . . . &quot; As if to signal that he too was_on the move , Gunn himself briefly rode a motorcycle ( though not until after he ' d written this reputation-making poem ) . &quot; I rode it to show_off , &quot; he now says , &quot; and I had it less than three months . I shouldn ' t be trusted on_the_road . that ' s why I don ' t drive a car . I think my reflexes are funny. &quot; One Englishman who has been a fan of Gunn since the 1950s is neurologist-writer Oliver Sacks . &quot; My battered copy of ' The Sense_of_Movement ' goes_back to -- let ' s see , 1958 , &quot; he notes . &quot; Jonathan Miller , who was a friend of mine , said , ' You must read this. ' &quot; Sacks subsequently ventured to San Francisco for a_couple_of years of medical training , choosing the location in part because Thom Gunn was already there . &quot; I met him in 1961 , &quot; recalls Sacks , who now lives_in New York , &quot; and I saw a fair amount of him during my brief San Francisco days , which ended in 1962 . But I ' ve kept_in touch with him since . And whether as a grand poet or the best of friends , he ' s someone I very much love and admire. &quot; But during these same decades , most literate Americans -- even most American fans of poetry , which is a far smaller group -- had barely heard of Gunn . Poet Elizabeth Bishop , writing to her mentor , Marianne Moore , from San Francisco in 1968 , felt obliged to explain who he was , even though by this time he had already published five books ( &quot; My Sad Captains &quot; came_out in 1961 , &quot; Touch &quot; and &quot; Positives &quot; in the mid-1960s ) . &quot; One poet I ' ve met here , almost a neighbor , I like very much , Thom Gunn , &quot; she wrote . &quot; His poetry is usually very good , I think ; he ' s English but has lived here for a long time. &quot; Gunn ' s opinion of Bishop was equally enthusiastic . &quot; She was jolly and hearty and liked a good joke , &quot; he remembers . &quot; And she gave the only really good literary party I ever went to. &quot; FROM 1972 ON , THOM GUNN HAS EKED OUT A LIVING AS A PART-TIME LECTURER in UC Berkeley ' s English_department , having given_up a tenured position there because he couldn ' t stand going_to department meetings . He had no health_insurance , no retirement_plan , not even a single credit_card ( until , in the 1980s , he finally acquired one so he could purchase airline tickets over the phone ) . He lived frugally , almost never buying new clothing or hardcover books . His only tangible asset , a house in the Haight-Ashbury district , had been purchased in 1971 with a $ 3 # 300 down_payment carved from his $ 10 # 000 Guggenheim grant ; he shared the mortgage costs among several rent-paying housemates . This is not , however , a tale of penurious merit ultimately rewarded , of ascetic renunciation for the good of Art . This is the tale of choices consciously made on the basis of immediate as well as lasting desires ; of pleasures experienced and enjoyed ; of a life explored and inhabited so as_to render up its manifold possibilities . During all those years , Thom Gunn was having a ball -- particularly in the late ' 60s and early ' 70s , San Francisco ' s hippie heyday . &quot; I liked LSD because it broke_down categories , &quot; Gunn says now . &quot; But that was what I liked so_much about the ' 60s anyway . By your mid-30s , you can get a bit smug , and the ' 60s -- and by this I mean the drugs , the concerts in the park , all_of it -- turned_over my assumptions , delayed my middle-aged smugness a little. &quot; The poems that came_out of this period of discovery and self-discovery -- poems about LSD , communal orgies , gay bath houses , rock-star deaths , fragmentary memories , nightmarish visions and the Northern California landscape , urban and rural -- took_up much of the space in Gunn ' s next three books , &quot; Moly &quot; ( 1971 ) , &quot; Jack Straw ' s Castle &amp; Other Poems &quot; ( 1976 ) and &quot; The Passages of Joy &quot; ( 1982 ) . These books did not endear him to his English public . The prevailing sense ( as wittily summarized by Glyn Maxwell , a younger British poet ) was that here was &quot; a man of decorous , skillful , metrical verse who had for his own reasons become absorbed into an alien culture that gave him alien subjects ( like sex ) , alien backdrops ( like sunshine ) and , most vexing of all , made his strict forms melt on the page . No longer could he be Our Man Out There like , say , Auden in New York or James Fenton in the Far East , because he seemed to have become Their Man Out There. &quot; To an extent , this was the point of the whole endeavor : to escape being English . The freedom Gunn gained in 1960s San Francisco was in part the freedom to stop being what he had been brought_up to be and become something else , something far less easily defined . He says as much in the last few lines of &quot; The Geysers &quot; : &quot; torn from the self in which I breathed and trod I am I am raw_meat I am a god &quot; Or , if not a god , then at any rate a Californian ; at the very least an &quot; Anglo American , &quot; as he now calls himself , in imitation of the models of ethnic immigration -- Italian American , Hispanic_American , Asian American -- that can be found so profusely in California . It ' s not true , however , that California made all_of Gunn ' s British strictness melt away . As a teacher at UC Berkeley , for instance , &quot; he was extremely rigorous , &quot; says dance critic Joan Acocella , who took Gunn ' s undergraduate English 100 in 1965 . &quot; He made us write a two-page paper every week -- he was very strict about the two-page limit -- and he always expected from us more sophistication than the other professors did . He gave us idiosyncratic material -- more difficult , less lovable than the usual -- and then he gave us his reasons for liking it , which were bound up with his moral personality : his reserve , his distance . I ' ll never forget what he taught me . He was great. &quot; The students also found Gunn himself idiosyncratic , and that too appealed_to them . Unlike the other professors , Acocella remembers , &quot; He wore leather , he was a poet , we had heard that he was gay , and we knew that he took the bus back to San Francisco every day. &quot; ( To this day , Gunn takes the bus back and forth one semester each year to teach at Berkeley . He hasn ' t allowed any of his recent fellowships to interfere with his scrupulous , devoted teaching ; once , in fact , he nearly turned_down a three-year fellowship when it seemed he would have to stop teaching to accept it. ) The rigor that characterized his teaching was also there , if less obviously , in his California-influenced poetry . He may have ceased to be wholly British , but he could still produce &quot; decorous , skilled , metrical verse. &quot; Though the three books of the ' 70 and ' 80s contain a great_deal of free-verse experimentation , they also contain a substantially higher proportion of rhyme and meter than most American poets were using at that time . Even in the lines I ' ve quoted from &quot; The Geysers , &quot; you can hear both the rhyme ( of &quot; trod &quot; and &quot; god &quot; ) and the old-fashioned , Shakespearean iambic pentameter ( &quot; I am I am raw_meat I am a god &quot; ) . Explaining why he chose to use meter when writing_about his LSD experiences , Gunn has written , &quot; The acid trip is unstructured , it opens you up_to countless possibilities , you hanker after the infinite . The only way I could give myself any control over the presentation of these experiences , and so could be true_to them , was by trying to render the infinite through the finite , the unstructured through the structured. &quot; But this particular use of structure did not appeal_to those who had formerly praised Gunn ' s energy and adventurousness when similar metrical forms were applied to subjects like soldiers , bikers and figures from Greek myth . What really bugged the_British critics was Gunn ' s unashamed focus_on pleasure and enjoyment ; &quot; good news is no news , &quot; as one reviewer in the Times Literary Supplement wryly put it . It was not until Thom Gunn ' s next book , &quot; The Man with Night Sweats &quot; ( which came_out in England in 1992 ) , that the_British wanted to hear what he had to report . &quot; Now that HIV and AIDS have turned Gunn ' s home into a place to which we do send correspondents , at least when we feel up_to it , &quot; the TLS review continues , &quot; there he still is , an exceptional and fascinating poet with a formal range to rival Auden ' s , a sensuality equal_to Ginsberg ' s and a profound yet daily humanity that surely surpasses that of any other poet of our times. &quot; That ringing endorsement was sounded in March of this year , in a review of Thom Gunn ' s &quot; Collected Poems. &quot; When I read the praise aloud to fiction writer Leonard Michaels , who has taught with Gunn at UC Berkeley for almost three decades , he shrugs with disdainful pity for the previously unenlightened . &quot; Haven ' t I been saying exactly that all along ? &quot; he says with his characteristic Lower East_Side inflections . Another shrug , as if to say , who could miss it ? Nobody , at the moment . Since 1990 , when he was in the first round to receive the generous ( $ 105 # 000 over three years ) Lila Wallace-Reader ' s Digest Writers ' Awards , Gunn has been reaping the rewards of fame . In late 1992 , a British jury awarded him the first Forward Prize , which is now England ' s largest poetry prize . In 1993 , he won not only the Lenore Marshall-Nation Magazine Prize for Poetry for &quot; The Man with Night Sweats &quot; but also a five-year , $ 369 # 000 MacArthur Fellowship for a lifetime of achievement in poetry . The word &quot; genius , &quot; in large , boldfaced type , appeared next to his picture in several Bay Area newspapers , while the Observer in London headlined its interview with him &quot; A poet who ' s still firing on all cylinders &quot; ( a reference , no doubt , to those everlasting bikers ) . The Manhattan-based novelist and critic Susan Sontag , who serves on the board of a San Francisco literary organization called City Arts &amp; Lectures Inc. , lately advised its director to draw_on local talent : &quot; You know who you should get_to speak ? Thom Gunn . He ' s one of the two or three best poets writing anywhere in America right now. &quot; And now , in 1994 , the publication of his &quot; Collected Poems &quot; has already resulted in that rave review in the TLS , a public reading with U.S. poet_laureate Rita Dove at Grand Central Station in New York , respectful notices in Sunday book sections across the country and -- to Gunn ' s great delight -- a one-page profile in Spin magazine , featuring a photograph that Robert Mapplethorpe took of him in 1980 . Gunn is particularly pleased by the attention from Spin because he has long been an aficionado of rock_music and an avid watcher of MTV . &quot; The people at Spin thought I was terribly old-fashioned because I read Rolling Stone , &quot; he reports with typical self-deprecation . But by anyone else ' s standards , Thom Gunn is frighteningly up_to date . When he ' s not rereading Victorian novels or discovering Darwin ' s &quot; Voyage of the Beagle &quot; ( the best book he read in 1991 , Gunn alleges ) , he ' s spotting the latest good television_show . &quot; ' NYPD Blue , ' of course , I adore , &quot; he says of the most recent season . &quot; It doesn ' t worry me that it ' s violent any more_than that ' King Lear ' is violent . I love the way it preaches -- it preaches so well. &quot; He also watches &quot; Seinfeld &quot; ( &quot; like everybody else &quot; ) and &quot; Beavis &amp; Butt-head &quot; ( &quot; I really do -- I ' m not just pretending &quot; ) but feels that &quot; The Simpsons , &quot; which he once admired , has &quot; lost its edge. &quot; Gunn habitually ferrets_out the best in every genre , from Philip K . Dick to Thomas Hardy , and eagerly recommends a movie like the Harvey Keitel sleaze fest &quot; Bad Lieutenant , &quot; praising its &quot; hilarious Dostoyevskian humor. &quot; He refuses to distinguish between a 19th-Century novel and a recent potboiler , between a pop song and a classical composition . &quot; I hate the distinction between high art and low art , and I have since I was in my teens . Dickens had the audience of Judith Krantz in his time -- Trollope held him in rather low esteem because he was too crude and too popular , &quot; he gleefully points_out . THE MACARTHUR FELLOWSHIP and all_the accompanying hoopla have not much changed Thom Gunn ' s essential existence , though the money will come_in_handy for retirement . &quot; I always said , when people asked how I would support myself in my old_age , that my public would take_care of me . And now it has ! &quot; he beams . The unexpected windfall also paid_for him and his lover , Mike Kitay , to take a special trip to Venice , where they hadn ' t been since they were in their 20s , and to Prague , which they saw for the first time and loved . Remarking on his good_fortune to a British journalist who interviewed him after he won the Forward Prize , Thom Gunn said , &quot; I ' ve traveled , I ' ve been happily in_love for 40 years , and I ' ve read ' The Brothers Karamazov ' three times. &quot; The joke at the end ( which is only partly a joke : Gunn takes his reading very seriously ) undercuts the sentiment a bit , but it is true that he has been in_love for more_than 40 years . He met Mike Kitay , an American studying at Cambridge , in 1952 . After Kitay returned to America , Gunn went_to Stanford for graduate work in 1954 . The two of them eventually settled in San Francisco , where Kitay had a job scriptwriting for television . &quot; It is not easy to speak_of a relationship so long-lasting , so deep and so complex , nor of the changes it has gone_through , let alone of the effect it has had_on my writing , &quot; Gunn has written_about his life with Kitay . &quot; But his was , from the start , the example of the searching , worrying , improvising intelligence playing upon the emotions , which in turn reflect back on the intelligence . It was an example at times as rawly passionate as only Henry_James can dare to be. &quot; ( He ' s not kidding about Henry_James . Gunn rereads &quot; The Wings of the Dove &quot; every few years , and &quot; The Awkward Age &quot; is one of his two favorite novels from the turn_of_the_century ; the other is Rudyard Kipling ' s &quot; Kim. &quot; ) A number of Gunn ' s poems are love poems to Kitay , including &quot; Thoughts on Unpacking , &quot; &quot; The Separation , &quot; &quot; Touch , &quot; &quot; The Hug &quot; and a new one , &quot; In Trust. &quot; I heard &quot; In Trust &quot; for the first time at a poetry reading in March in Berkeley ( it ' s too recent even to be in the &quot; Collected Poems &quot; ) and was extremely moved by it -- partly , I imagine , because I was sitting next to Mike Kitay during the reading . Mike , who still looks very much as he did when Thom described him in &quot; To a Friend in Time of Trouble &quot; ( &quot; A handsome gray-haired , gray-eyed man , tight-knit &quot; ) had been giving me hints about who or what was being referred to in each of the previous poems . When this poem began , he fell silent . &quot; You go from me In June for months on end To study equanimity Among high trees alone ; I go_out with a new boyfriend And stay all summer in the city where Home mostly on my own I watch the sunflowers flare . &quot; But if the poem begins with separation , it ends with a powerful coming_together : &quot; As you began You ' ll end the year with me . we ' ll hug each other while we can , Work or stray while we must . Nothing is , or will ever be , Mine , I suppose . No one can hold a heart , But what we hold_in trust We do hold , even apart . &quot; Gunn and Kitay ' s complicated history is reflected in their domestic arrangement , which includes other people who have entered their lives along the way -- Gunn ' s family , or &quot; household. &quot; And this communal group is in turn embedded within the larger community of San Francisco , which Gunn also considers his home . Gunn ' s two &quot; obsessions , &quot; as he self-consciously calls them , are both connected to this feeling of living within the larger civic society . &quot; I don ' t like people getting movies in their own homes , and I don ' t like people driving_around in cars , &quot; he announces . &quot; I think people should take public transportation and be with other people in movie_theaters . Merely sitting near another person on a bus or in a movie_theater is good for the sense of community. &quot; Thom Gunn ' s household -- where , as he says in one poem , &quot; Each cooks one night , and each cooks well &quot; -- consists , at this point , of himself , Mike Kitay , Bob Bair , Bill Schuessler and Joseph Batiste . Another roommate , Jim Lay , died of AIDS on Christmas_Day , 1986 . &quot; Four of my friends died in one month , &quot; Gunn says of the epidemic that stimulated him to write the central poems in &quot; The Man With Night Sweats. &quot; He himself is HIV-negative , a fortuitously exempted bystander to the mass tragedy , as he suggests in the poem &quot; Courtesies of the Interregnum &quot; : &quot; Excluded from the invitation list To the largest gathering of the decade , missed From membership as if the club were_full . It is not that I am not eligible . . . . &quot; In the notes at the back of &quot; Collected Poems , &quot; Thom Gunn lists the names of the dead friends referred to in his poems about AIDS . &quot; For the record -- for my record if for no one else ' s , because they were not famous people -- I wish to name them here . . . . &quot; He has always had strong feelings about names , about the specific , individual identity assigned to one person and no other . &quot; Poor girl , poor girl , what was your name ? &quot; he asks_in the last line of &quot; The Victim , &quot; his poem about Sid Vicious ' murder of his girlfriend , and in the notes he supplies the answer . The actual , historical_record , the particulars of an individual personality , matter_to Gunn , which is one reason his memorial poems have such power . The same passion for specificity also explains another , very different aspect of Thom Gunn ' s character : his enormous congeniality as a gossip . He remembers every tidbit of information ever passed_on to him , every remark ever made to him , and by whom , and he can retrieve it at exactly the pertinent moment in a conversation . &quot; I ' m the soul of indiscretion , &quot; he confides , and then listens eagerly to the next gossipy secret . That is one side of Thom Gunn . The other side is just the opposite : a man who deeply believes_in the virtues of impersonality . In an essay called &quot; My Life up_to Now , &quot; Gunn comments on the fact that he is very consciously &quot; a rather derivative poet &quot; and then goes_on to say that &quot; it has not been of primary interest to develop a unique poetic personality , and I rejoice in Eliot ' s lovely remark that art is the escape_from personality. &quot; The same idea informs his poem &quot; Expression , &quot; which complains about &quot; the poetry of my juniors , &quot; in which &quot; Mother doesn ' t understand , / and they hate Daddy , the noted alcoholic. &quot; Tired of this confessional mode ( the mode of much contemporary American poetry , from Robert Lowell and Sylvia Plath onward ) , the poem ' s speaker goes_to an art museum , where he seeks_out a medieval Italian painting of the_Virgin and Child . The poem ends : &quot; The sight quenches , like water after too_much birthday_cake . Solidly there , mother and child stare outward , two pairs of matching eyes void_of expression . ON THE ASSEMBLAGE-STYLE WALL of Thom Gunn ' s second-floor study , amid cutout pictures of River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves , antique postcards of nude bodybuilders and assorted posters , clippings and visual paraphernalia , is a photograph that doesn ' t go_with the rest . In it , a beautiful dark-haired woman holds a pretty blond baby , both of them staring outward at the camera . I have been in the study before , to pick_up a book or admire the view out the back window , but I have never before noticed the photograph . Now , however , we are spending longer than usual here , because Thom Gunn is giving a tour of the house to Tony Kushner . ( Kushner , in town to give a lecture following the great success of &quot; Angels in America , &quot; told me that the person he most wanted to meet was Thom Gunn , so I arranged a lunch . In Kushner ' s view , &quot; He is certainly one of the greatest poets in the_English language . I find his work very scary and disturbing and sexy and beautiful. &quot; ) &quot; Who ' s that ? &quot; I say , pointing at the photograph . &quot; that ' s my mother , &quot; says Thom . &quot; With me , as a baby. &quot; Thom Gunn was born in 1929 in Gravesend , a town in Kent . His father , the son of a Scottish merchant seaman , was a journalist who became quite successful , eventually editing a newspaper , the Daily Sketch . Gunn ' s parents were divorced when he was 8 or 9 , and he was_on fairly distant terms with his father after that , but even before the divorce he was closer to his mother . His given name , Thomson , was the name of his mother ' s family , and he identified with that side of his heritage . &quot; My mother was one of seven children , all girls , &quot; Gunn has written , &quot; and all_of a very independent turn of mind. &quot; One of Thom ' s childhood memories is of his mother &quot; wearing an orchid pinned by a brooch in the shape of a hammer_and_sickle . From this distance the combination sounds like a cliche of the ' 30s , but it wasn ' t : Other women would n ' t have done something so outrageous. &quot; He also recalls being lost at the age of about 4 in Kensington Gardens ( by this time , the family had moved to London ) , and being asked by a policeman to describe his mother . &quot; A proud woman , &quot; the little boy answered . When Thom was 15 , his mother committed suicide ; he and his younger brother found the body . For most of his writing life , he could not directly address this fact . In his one published fragment of autobiography , the tragedy takes_place between sentences , as it would in an E.M. Forster novel . Then , in 1992 , Gunn published a poem called &quot; The Gas-Poker , &quot; which begins : &quot; Forty-eight years ago -- Can it be forty-eight Since then ? -- they forced the door Which she had barricaded With a full bureau ' s weight Lest anyone find , as they did , What she had blocked it for . The two boys who are the poem ' s &quot; they &quot; -- &quot; Elder and younger brother &quot; -- go outside to walk and cry and try to understand what has happened to them . Then : Coming_back off the grass To the room of her release They who had been her treasures Knew to turn_off the gas , Take the appropriate measures , Telephone the police . Borrowing the strategy he used in the poems about LSD , Gunn has relied_on rhyme and meter to organize an experience that would otherwise be incomprehensibly , uncontrollably painful . &quot; Take appropriate measures &quot; : It ' s in the very impersonality of the phrase ( echoing , as it does , the expressive &quot; who had been her treasures &quot; ) that the sense of personal loss comes_through most strongly . &quot; The surprising thing about one ' s dead , &quot; Thom Gunn said to me many years ago , &quot; is that your relationship with them can change_over time . Even after they ' ve been dead for years , you still find your feelings about them changing , or growing . And that makes them seem to alter , too. &quot; I ask him recently if he still feels that way . &quot; Yes , &quot; he says . &quot; Yes . Exactly . The longer people are dead , the more your relationship with them changes. &quot;</TEXT>
