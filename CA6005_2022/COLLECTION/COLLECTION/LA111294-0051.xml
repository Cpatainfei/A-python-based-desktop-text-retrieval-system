   <HEADLINE> NEW HOPE IN BLOODY SRI LANKA ; PRESIDENT-ELECT EXTENDS OLIVE_BRANCH TO REBELS IN SEEKING TO END LONG CONFLICT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The savagery of Bosnia and the carnage in countries like Rwanda and Somalia make_it easy to forget the troubles of the island nation of Sri Lanka . Yet in that country , off the southern tip of India , a decade of ethnic clashes has killed more_than 35 # 000 people . This week ' s election of Prime_Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga as president offers hope that the slaughter will end . Kumaratunga has wisely and courageously vowed to &quot; forge ahead &quot; with the peace process , probably in the form of peace talks with Tamil guerrillas , who started the warfare in an attempt to carve out an independent nation in the north . Her foe in the election , Srima Dissanayake , campaigned on a platform of no talks . That was understandable ; Dissanayake ' s husband , his party ' s presidential candidate , was assassinated last month . Police blamed Tamil guerrillas for the suicide bomb attack , which also killed 50 others . Dissanayake ' s United National Party used mob violence and murder to help it maintain power for 17 years , during which the nation formerly known as Ceylon went steadily downhill . Once an outpost of prosperity and literacy in South Asia , Sri Lanka was overdue for a change of government . Voters , recognizing this , made Kumaratunga prime_minister in August . Kumaratunga herself is no stranger to violence . Her father was prime_minister until his assassination in 1959 by a dissident Buddhist monk ; six years ago Sinhalese militants killed her politician husband out of anger over the olive_branches he and she had extended_to the Tamils . The new president is the first national officeholder in years who has reached_out to minorities . She will have to walk a tightrope between the Tamils , who make_up only a small minority of the nation of 17 million people , and the majority Sinhalese . Religion complicates the issue , with the Tamils mostly Hindu and the Sinhalese mostly Buddhist . For their part , the Tamil guerrillas should recognize that this is their best chance in years to stanch the blood , and perhaps to gain some autonomy , if not independence , after a decade of tragedy .</TEXT>
