   <HEADLINE> SPILLOVER ; THE FUTURE ; MCGRATH LEAK REVEALS HOLES IN RESPONSE EFFORTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A week after state and federal teams responded with textbook efficiency to Ventura County ' s worst oil spill in decades , officials at three government levels are deciding how to patch holes the leak exposed in local emergency_procedures and in oil-field regulations . While cleanup crews skimmed the remains of 84 # 000 gallons of crude_oil from a lake at McGrath State Beach in Oxnard , state and federal lawmakers joined county officials in vowing that the lessons of last week are not quickly forgotten . &quot; One of the problems -- and it ' s been a problem for years in the beach area -- is confusion about jurisdictional responsibility , &quot; said Oxnard-area county Supervisor John K . Flynn . &quot; We need to make_sure the ( county ) fire_chief knows that an emergency is an emergency and -- regardless of where it is -- we have to respond. &quot; A top county Fire_Department official admitted last week that oil continued to leak from a Bush Oil Co . pipeline an extra day because fire dispatchers botched their response to a beachcomber ' s spill report Christmas_Eve morning . But at least six other local agencies also failed to dispatch investigators , including the city of Oxnard , in whose jurisdiction most of the spilled oil was discovered . Oxnard officials said Friday that they had not completed their review to determine responsibility . U.S. Rep . Elton Gallegly ( R-Simi Valley ) said he plans to call a meeting of city and county officials within three weeks to review local response to oil spills . An elaborate countywide plan for responding to toxic hazards was apparently ignored after the Christmas_Eve sighting . At the state level , Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Jack O ' Connell ( D-Carpinteria ) said he will sponsor legislation needed to strengthen oil field regulations and to clarify which state agencies are responsible_for the safety of tens of thousands of miles of oil_pipeline in California -- on and off oil fields . &quot; We have an aging infrastructure ( of ) pipeline transportation , &quot; O ' Connell said . &quot; And the concern here is that with the aging network , more spills could occur. &quot; The chairman of the Assembly Natural_Resources committee has agreed to hold fact-finding hearings in Ventura County if local officials want them , O ' Connell said . Authorities estimate that Ventura County , which produces 4 % of the state ' s oil , has hundreds of miles of large transportation pipelines . The county ' s 37 oil fields contain thousands of miles more of low-pressure lines , including the ruptured Bush Oil_pipeline . The locations of many of those pipelines are unmapped , officials said . Recognizing the threat posed by old pipelines , the state oil and gas agency is drafting rules to force pressure tests and anti-corrosion devices on many buried oil field pipelines . Such lines , including the ruptured Oxnard line , are supposed to be operated at low_pressures and now are virtually unregulated . The new regulations should be in place within a year , officials said . Officials at the division of oil and gas in the state_Department of Conservation have also requested an attorney_general ' s opinion about whether the broken Oxnard line qualifies as a low-pressure oil field gathering line or should be considered a transportation line and more stringently regulated . In the aftermath of the Oxnard oil spill , government officials said numerous changes should result . * Assistant County Fire_Chief David Festerling said his agency , which runs the principal hazardous materials unit in the county , will change its procedures to guarantee that every reported spill is responded to , regardless of jurisdiction . * The county Fire_Department will begin reporting all oil spill sightings promptly to the state Office of Emergency Services in Sacramento by calling a 24-hour hot_line , Festerling said . All local agencies are required by law to make such calls , but none did on Christmas_Eve . * Oxnard Police_Chief Harold Hurtt , whose police and fire dispatchers thought another agency was responding to the early oil sighting at McGrath Lake , said he will resolve any confusion over Oxnard ' s jurisdiction and make_sure the state hot_line is called . His dispatchers said last week that they did not have the hot_line number . They also said that McGrath Lake was outside their jurisdiction -- an assertion other agencies disputed . * A top state parks official , in response to a McGrath State Park ranger ' s failure to check_out another early spill tip , said his agency will now require rangers to telephone emergency agencies with such tips . Rangers will also be required to notify any nearby oil_company . * Several state officials , including the state ' s top oil-spill response officer , have pledged to press Gov . Pete Wilson and the Legislature for new regulations to make_sure pipeline-testing responsibilities are clear and that oil-field operators are forced to more carefully account_for oil transferred through pipelines . A key question in the week-old oil-spill investigation is why Bush Oil Co . failed to detect a leak of about 600 barrels of crude_oil per day for at least three days . Company officials have said they measured the amount of oil_pumped through the ruptured line from one storage_tank to another each day . * Pete Bontadelli , administrator of state Fish and Game ' s oil spill prevention and response unit , said he will push to make such daily accounting a state requirement . Beyond lessons learned and solutions proposed , the Oxnard spill showed how effectively state and federal_governments can respond to a major coastal oil spill -- especially when luck is_on their side . &quot; It seems to me to be a textbook response , &quot; said O ' Connell who walked along the spill site two days after the spill ' s official discovery on Christmas_Day . &quot; And it couldn ' t have happened on a worse day. &quot; Following procedures established in 1991 in response to a new federal law on marine oil spills , state Fish and Game ' s special oil spill unit was the lead agency in Oxnard . It joined the U.S. Coast Guard , the federal_government ' s principal representative , to map strategies for response and cleanup . Both agencies are conducting investigations into the cause of the spill and responsibility for it . They have been joined by more_than a dozen other state , federal and local agencies with responsibilities in areas of emergency services , public health , fish and wildlife , tideland leases , wetlands restoration , ground_water , ocean mammals and oil field supervision . Along with Bush Oil parent company Berry Petroleum , whose insurance is responsible_for the estimated $ 10-million cleanup , the Coast Guard and state Fish and Game have contracted with private companies to clean the ocean , shovel tar from seven miles of beach , skim oil from McGrath Lake and chop soiled reeds and willows in the brushy marshland . Bush officials said Saturday that 138 birds had died in the spill , and an additional 48 were injured . By all accounts , state and federal response and cleanup have gone well . Carpinteria-based contractor Clean Seas was mobilized within an hour after a U.S. Minerals Management Service helicopter spotted an oil_slick of McGrath State Beach at 7:30 Christmas morning . Minerals Management employees contacted both the state Office of Emergency Services and Fish and Game ' s oil spill unit by 9:20 and the Coast Guard by 9:40 . Clean Seas began corralling oil_slicks off McGrath beach by 10 a.m. and Bush Oil employees -- notified at 9:30 a.m. -- closed_down the broken line by 10:15 , shut_off a lake-leveling pump that was funneling oil to the ocean by 10:45 and began cleanup by 11 o ' clock . By 3 p.m. , eight boats and 80 workers were_on the scene . Ocean cleanup lasted two days , and the beach cleanup is nearing completion . About 63 # 000 of the 84 # 000 gallons that spilled had been recovered by Saturday . Coast Guard Cmdr . Jim Rutkovsky , chief of port operations in a five-county Los Angeles region , said fate had a hand in how well the cleanup has gone . Nearly all_of the leaked oil flowed down a farmland drainage channel to McGrath Lake , he said . &quot; I haven ' t dealt with a spill before that had a containment lake waiting for it , &quot; Rutkovsky said . &quot; It is good_luck . ( Otherwise ) we would probably have 40 or 50 miles of beach to deal with rather than seven or eight. &quot; Rutkovsky said there have been minor glitches in cleanup , but he would n ' t cite any . &quot; Given the fact we have had to respond in almost every environment -- some ocean skimming , beach cleanup , the lake contamination , a marsh and a creek and some hydrological impacts , I ' m very happy , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s gone very well. &quot; Rutkovsky said he still expects estimates of the amount of oil leaked to rise somewhat . &quot; My gut keeps telling me there ' s got_to be a higher number , &quot; he said . The Coast Guard ' s work_at the spill site will be done_in a week or two , Rutkovsky said . But first his investigators must be sure that oil is no longer a threat to navigable waters , that all surface oil is removed from the water and that the source of the spill has been positively identified and any further threat eliminated . On Saturday , white-suited workers cleared brush along the west_side of Harbor Boulevard , just north of Gonzales Road , in preparation for excavation of the ruptured pipeline , scheduled to begin today . State officials have said corrosion is the most likely cause of the break_in the pipeline , which is 30 to 40 years old . State Fish and Game officials will stay_on much longer , continuing to clean and test marshland and McGrath Lake and plotting a strategy for long-term restoration of wetlands once rich_in birds . The bottom of McGrath Lake may have to be mechanically scraped if contamination is severe . The lake was home to egrets , sandpipers and the endangered California brown pelican and snowy plover . It is also a wintering spot to as_many as 30 species of ducks . Fish and Game lawyers also must decide whether to ask the district_attorney ' s office to file criminal negligence charges against Bush Oil or its employees . In addition , Fish and Game lawyers could seek civil penalties of up_to $ 250 # 000 through the state_attorney general . The company might also be charged an administrative penalty of $ 10 for each gallon of oil spilled and not recovered . State water quality_control officials said they may also seek stiff fines under different laws . As state and federal_officials continued to investigate the spill , local officials said they plan to shore_up their end of the statewide emergency network . Ventura County spent years charting plans and procedures for responding to hazardous material spills , even establishing a four-person office of emergency services as a liaison in the Sheriff ' s Department . Wendy Haddock , the office ' s assistant director , said the plans would have worked had they been followed . &quot; It sounds like everybody and their mother was notified , &quot; Haddock said , &quot; so it ' s just a question of , ' Are you going_to send somebody out ? ' &quot; At least seven local public safety agencies were contacted about a beachcomber ' s report of an oil spill a day before the formal alarm was sounded Christmas morning . None sent an investigator to check_out the report , allowing hundreds more barrels of oil to escape . The U.S. Coast Guard , which was also in the loop , dispatched a ship , but seamen saw no oil on the ocean . According to officials , the local response was botched because each agency assumed -- or was told -- that another agency would follow up . Ventura electrician Bruce Fincher , whose dog walked into oily McGrath Lake just north of the Edison power_plant , said he called the Channel Islands Harbor Patrol about 10 a.m. Christmas_Eve day . * Fincher said he was referred to a sheriff ' s dispatcher , who subsequently notified an Oxnard police and fire dispatcher and the California Highway Patrol . The CHP serves as state Fish and Game ' s dispatcher on holidays . However , Christmas_Eve was not a Fish and Game holiday , so the call could have gone directly to Fish and Game , officials said . The Oxnard dispatcher said she was told that the sheriff ' s dispatcher was calling as a courtesy because the spill was near Oxnard but that Fish and Game would respond to it . As it turned_out , the oil spill was in both Oxnard and county jurisdictions , and apparently no one ever reached a Fish and Game representative . The CHP dispatcher , meanwhile , notified the county Fire_Department , as is routine when that agency discovers toxic spills . The county Fire_Department dispatcher notified the Coast Guard and dispatchers in Port Hueneme and Oxnard . * Assistant County Fire_Chief Festerling said his dispatchers assumed Oxnard would cover the call , because McGrath Lake is their jurisdiction . Still , Festerling said his agency should have made_sure Oxnard was responding . Oxnard police routinely respond to calls from the McGrath State Beach campground , and an officer patrols the beach itself , which is only about 100 yards from McGrath Lake . Oxnard officials said Friday that they were not certain about jurisdiction . But both an Oxnard dispatcher and a police watch commander said Friday that they are still convinced McGrath Lake is not their jurisdiction . However , maps show that nearly all_of the soiled lake is within the city of Oxnard . &quot; What we have to do is make_it very clear who is responsible_for what and to make_sure it gets done , &quot; Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said late Friday . &quot; We will do whatever we can to prevent this sort of thing from ever occurring again , &quot; Lopez said .
