   <HEADLINE> IS IT A MOSQUE OR A STATE ? A BOY FORCES PAKISTAN TO DEBATE IDENTITY ; POLITICIANS ARE HOLDING THEIR TONGUES , LEST THEY ANTAGONIZE THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Not since the Salman Rushdie protests in 1989 has this Pakistani city been gripped by such an emotional religious case . The signs plastered throughout the town of Gujranwala read : &quot; Any one who blasphemes against the prophet should be hanged_in public. &quot; For months , dozens of Muslim fundamentalists staged angry protests outside the town ' s courthouse , and now they have set_upon this ancient walled city . The maulvis of Gujranwala are demanding that a 12-year-old boy and two others be hanged for allegedly defiling the name of the prophet and writing derogatory phrases on the wall of a mosque . At the center of the protests is Salamat Masih , a gangly young Christian accused of blasphemy -- a charge that carries a mandatory death sentence . None of Salamat ' s accusers has yet to say what he wrote , and , in any case , they have since erased the evidence . Defense_lawyers deny the boy could have written anything : Salamat is totally illiterate . The case was recently transferred to Lahore , where his lawyers think Salamat will receive a fairer trial . But when charges against the three were framed , 35 maulvis protested outside the courthouse in an attempt to scare the judge . The trial is set to begin Monday . Until recently , politicians , including Prime_Minister Benazir Bhutto , withheld comment on the case , lest they antagonize the religious right . The country ' s law minister has sent the blasphemy law to the Islamic Ideology Council for review , concerned that it has been used to prevent the expression of religious_beliefs . A spokesman for Bhutto said it ' s likely the law will be modified . A decision is expected in less than a month . During preliminary hearings , Salamat needed a police escort to repel hostilecrowds and safely enter the court in Gujranwala , where protesters had crowded the galleries to intimidate the judge . In the past two years , three people accused of blasphemy have been killed by fanatics while awaiting trial . Since its founding in 1947 , Pakistan has struggled to define what it means to be a Muslim state . &quot; Father of the Nation &quot; Mohammed Ali Jinnah was not particularly religious , but it was he more_than anyone who insisted on the creation of Muslim Pakistan . Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , Pakistan ' s first elected leader , was known for his modernism -- a practicing Muslim , his political outlook was secular . Nonetheless , while he was prime_minister , from 1973 to 1977 , he caved_in to the mullahs and banned alcohol . The man who toppled him , Gen . Mohammad Zia ul-Haq , completely changed the 1973 constitution to accord with the Sharia ( Islamic Law ) -- something many politicians are still trying to undo . Pakistan ' s blasphemy laws are as extreme as those in Iran and Saudi_Arabia . In 1991 , Nawaz Sharif ' s government conceded to Pakistan ' s religious parties and made death the mandatory punishment for blasphemy , though there is no mention of such a punishment in the Koran . Ironically , Muslim religious parties have always done poorly in Pakistani elections . In last October ' s elections , they won only 3 % of the vote and fewer than 10 of the 217 seats in the National Assembly . But these Islamic parties continue to have a disproportionate influence on public perceptions . They are extremely well-organized , often using the mullahs to whip_up emotional support for a cause by preaching in mosques across the country . Politicians fear they will be labeled un-Islamic if they don ' t agree . For this reason , only human-rights activists have come_to Salamat ' s aid . The Human_Rights Commission of Pakistan took_up the boy ' s cause after his appointed lawyer , a Muslim , received threats from right-wing religious groups and quit the case . Hundreds of Pakistanis , most of them religious minorities , have been jailed on charges of blasphemy since 1986 , when Zia increased the punishment to life imprisonment or death . In the past two years , two people have been found guilty of blasphemy and sentenced to death . They are awaiting their appeals . At the root of most of these cases are land disputes or personal jealousies . Evidence is often circumstantial , and the prosecutors rely_on one person ' s word against another ' s -- often all it takes_to get a conviction in blasphemy cases . After spending six months behind bars , Salamat was released on bail late last year . Sitting in his lawyer ' s office , Salamat said he had been accused of blasphemy because the Muslims from his village want to force the Christians to leave the area . In Pakistan , there are an estimated 5 million Christians , who make_up less than 1 % of the population . Generally , they represent the poorest class and are looked down on by local Muslims . &quot; We already had some enmity with those people , &quot; said Salamat , who used to herd buffalo for his family . &quot; They just wanted an excuse to get_back at us. &quot; Salamat , who appears oblivious to the punishment he might face , was accused of blasphemy last May after he had a fight with the 8-year-old son of a prominent Muslim family living near his village . &quot; It started over some pigeons . The boys caught my pigeons , and they didn ' t want to give them back to me , &quot; he recalled . &quot; The little boy with whom I had a fight said he saw me write_on the mosque. &quot; True or not , Salamat Masih may become another victim of Pakistan ' s inability to find a working relationship between mosque and state .</TEXT>
