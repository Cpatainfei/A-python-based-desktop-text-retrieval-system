   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; THE VALLEY ' S TOP 20 RESTAURANTS ; DESPITE A DAMAGING EARTHQUAKE AND A TOUGH ECONOMY , DINING CHOICES ARE MORE ECLECTIC THAN EVER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s been a tough year for Valley restaurants and restaurant-goers , what with the earthquake , a down economy and a perceived dip in creativity and enthusiasm . Many of our favorite restaurants -- Il Mito , East India Grill ( renamed Akbar Grill this week ) , Art ' s and Cafe Cordiale -- suffered severe damage . ( Art ' s , a perennial member of this list , reopened just last week , and Cafe Cordiale has yet to reopen. ) There are bright spots . Posto and Pinot remain exemplars ; they should become honorary members of this list . And a_few more successful Westside restaurants -- Tribeca , Delmonico ' s and the Ca ' Brea spinoff Ca ' del Sole -- crossed Mulholland and joined the community . For this , the third annual Top 20 Restaurants in the Valley , I ' ve changed the list considerably from last year , partly because I ' ve been disappointed in a_few of the places included on the previous list , partly because a_few new restaurants inched their way in . I ' m delighted to say that the Valley has not one but two excellent Chinese restaurants now , both included here , and more eclecticism than ever . There ' s also more good Italian food than ever , as evidenced by the presence of La Pergola , and an absolutely top-notch sushi from the hand of a man named Nozawa . Who knows what 1995 will bring ? ( Inexpensive is less than $ 10 per person , moderate is less than $ 22 a person and expensive is more_than $ 23 a person. ) 1 . Posto It ' s been a very tough year for Posto owner Piero Selvaggio . The man lost a house in the Malibu fire and a staggering amount of wines from his Valentino restaurant during the earthquake . This hasn ' t prevented Posto from making further strides . Luciano Pellegrini ' s rustic cooking is_better than ever ; he has added an incredible pasta menu to complement the wonderful , bargain-priced list of Italian wines . I ' d come_back any time for the addictive Parmesan chips called frico , even if Pellegrini didn ' t craft miracles out of wheat_flour , olive_oil and salt . See if you can talk him into making you his crab pancake . 14928 Ventura Blvd. , Sherman Oaks . ( 818 ) 784-4400 ; reservation recommended . Expensive . 2 . Pinot Bistro At present , this is the Valley ' s only polished bistro . Chefs Octavio Becerra and Michael Otsuka were trained by the masterful Joachim Splichal , owner of Pinot , Patina and downtown ' s Patinette ; their menu is a symphony of Mediterranean , California and creative elements . Come for items like spiced seafood cakes or brioche French_toast at the exquisite Sunday brunch , original sandwiches or light spa cuisine at lunch . Dinner can be an epiphany : crispy whitefish , beef_tongue with bone_marrow or carmelized onion tart with marinated salmon . 12969 Ventura Blvd. , Studio City . ( 818 ) 990-0500 ; reservations recommended . Expensive . 3 . Ca ' del Sole Our brightest new entry , a modern bastion of Italian cooking , occupies the site that once housed the legendary Maison Gerard . You won ' t recognize the place now , with all soft yellow brick , Venetian carnival masks , richly hued woods . Chef Antonio Tommasi has proved himself on the other side of the_hill at such restaurants as Locanda Veneta and Ca ' Brea . Here , he ' s added Venetian rarities to his resume , baccala di San Pietro , fish hash with potato and capers ; pomodori appassiti , baked San Marzano tomatoes ; a cuff link-shaped pasta called gemelli , and a magnificent stewed duck . Beats paying a gondolier . 4100 Cahuenga Blvd. , North Hollywood . ( 818 ) 985-4669 ; reservations recommended . Moderate to expensive . 4 . Cinnabar Glendale ' s best restaurant is a blend of Pacific Rim and California , filtered through ' 90s elegance . The bar ' s centerpiece is a Chinese antique that once graced L . A . Chinatown ' s Yee Mee Loo ; the dining_areas have pastel colors and lots of Asian art . Proprietor Alvin Simon is an old pro , head chef Hisashi Yoshiara an artist with a strong sense of the visual . Taste Yoshiara ' s sea_scallops wrapped in shredded potato , free-range veal in a classically rich brown_sauce , applewood-smoked salmon and wonderful vegetarian creations . 933 S . Brand Blvd. , Glendale . ( 818 ) 551-1155 ; reservations recommended . Expensive . 5 . Cha Cha Cha The quake never slowed the pace at Encino ' s lively Cha Cha Cha . Two days after the Jan . 17 temblor , many locals were acting like party animals on the Titanic , downing tropical drinks , platters of Jamaican jerk pork and black_bean tamales as if nothing had ever happened . Mambo gumbo is a great soup of okra , shredded chicken and spices ; camarones negroes are jumbo shrimp in a dark , spicy sauce . Desserts alone are worth a visit -- the best banana cream pie in the Valley , and an ice_cream flying saucer made from a coconut macadamia_nut cookie and rich vanilla_bean ice_cream . 17499 Ventura Blvd. , Encino . ( 818 ) 789-3600 ; reservations recommended . Expensive . 6 . Sushi Nozawa The legendary impatience of sushi master Kazunori Nozawa , of Studio City ' s Sushi Nozawa , is one reason to position yourself at one of the restaurant ' s glass-topped tables , instead of directly under his scrutiny at the bar . ( Nozawa once bounced a friend of mine because she wasn ' t eating fast enough. ) Still , no one can deny that the man ' s a terrific talent , or that the fresh , clean-tasting sushi -- the killer yellowtail , finely marbled fatty tuna belly , for instance -- he serves is the equal of any in town , save perhaps the phenomenally expensive Ginza Sushi-Ko in Beverly Hills . Nozawa ' s gracious wife performs the table_service . 11288 Ventura Blvd. , Unit C , Studio City . ( 818 ) 508-7017 . Moderate . 7 . Dos Arbolitos Chef Yayo is a master of the stewpot and the corn tortilla . At Dos Arbolitos , a food stand / patio in a quiet North Hills neighborhood , he puts_out the Valley ' s best and most authentic Mexican dishes . Nothing here is more_than $ 5 -- a grainy , murky turkey mole ; costillitas , baby pork riblets in three-alarm red sauce , and wonderful po z ole , a hearty soup thick_with pieces of hominy and lightly fried pork . Great rice , wonderful beans a la olla , out-sized tortas drooling avocado , turkey and complex salsas . 16208 Parthenia St. , North Hills . ( 818 ) 891-6661 . Inexpensive . 8 . East India Grill After being closed for about six months due_to earthquake damage , Encino ' s East India Grill reopened in early July with a new chef , Mohammed Ashraf Ali , and a spate of colorful new dishes . ( Last week it was renamed Akbar Grill. ) This is still a restaurant that breaks the monotony of our cookie-cutter similar Indian restaurants , relying_on such condiments as mustard_seed oil , green coconut , cilantro and tamarind to do so . Try such snacks as potato bhaji , delicious , savory potato croquettes full of chopped onion , and main dishes such_as saffron chicken tandoori , hot from the clay oven with a cashew infused crust . 18003 Ventura Blvd. , Encino . ( 818 ) 343-1838 . Moderate . 9 . Downtown Bistro and Cafe Mitchell Frieder and his baker wife , Susan , change the menu constantly at their homey little high desert restaurant , formerly called Cakes and Company . This fall , Frieder has added such dishes as braised whole lamb shank cooked with cinnamon and lavender , honey-marinated pork_tenderloin with a touch of Dijon and tasso ( Cajun-spiced ham ) to complement his exemplary duck confit and traditional Louisiana-style gumbo . Pancakes are killers at breakfast ; fluffy , sour cream-based Heavenly Hots , corn-based , Rhode Island-inspired Johnny_cakes to go_with the good homemade breads and preserves . A truck_stop , this ain ' t . 858 W . Lancaster Blvd. , Lancaster . ( 805 ) 948-2253 ; reservations recommended . Moderate to expensive . 10 . Daily Grill The experts have announced that we ' re all retreating back to the safety of American comfort foods ; the Daily Grill , in its many Southland locations , is cashing_in_on the trend . No one makes a better BLT , better french fries or better plain American fare like meatloaf . The casual , comfortable ambience is a throwback to homey small-town grills of the post-Depression era . Excellent sourdough_bread to start off a meal here ; good , simple desserts such_as rice pudding to finish one . 12050 Ventura Blvd. , Studio City . ( 818 ) 769-6336 . Also , 16101 Ventura Blvd. , Encino . ( 818 ) 986-4111 . Reservations taken_for parties of six or more . Moderate . 11 . Talesai Talesai is an offshoot of a successful Sunset Boulevard Thai restaurant , and it has been designed with timeless beauty -- a sleek serving bar , a dose of modern art , spare , metallic colors that add a cool hipness . This is modern , authentic Thai food , the only rub being that dishes sometimes lack the sharp flavors and pungency that they would have when Thais cook for themselves . Standouts include hor mok , a delicate , coconut-rich fish_mousse served on red_clay , coriander-crusted lamb and the city ' s best sate . 11744 Ventura Blvd. , Studio City , ( 818 ) 753-1001 ; reservations recommended . Moderate . 12 . Dr. Hogly Wogly ' s Tyler , Texas Barbecue This Valley roadhouse barbecue hasn ' t changed since the ' 60s , so expect to come walking into a time warp . Meats are slow-smoked over hardwoods like hickory , oak and cherry and usually fall_off the bone tender . Pork ribs are a specialty ; the restaurant recently took top honors in a citywide rib cook-off . I ' m a fan of the flaky , complex brisket , served sloppy in a bland sauce with two slices of retro bland white_bread . 8136 Sepulveda Blvd. , Van Nuys . ( 818 ) 782-2480 . Moderate . 13 . Il Mito Il Mito closed briefly during the earthquake , then gaudily announced that it had been reborn . I can ' t say all_the hype was necessary , but I can say that food here is still top-notch . Chef-owner Michael Fekr is a protege of Antonio Tommasi , and he cooks with a steady hand . The casual Art Nouveau style makes the restaurant a favorite with industry types and New Agers . They come for such dishes as risotto with beets , duck with blueberries and incredible minced shrimp ravioli , not only to discuss their latest scripts . 11801 Ventura Blvd. , Studio City . ( 818 ) 762-1818 ; reservations recommended . Moderate to expensive . 14 . Moonlight Tango Cafe Forties atavism rules at this square , glass-ceilinged supper_club , where owner Vicki Criezis regularly books big_bands and other anachronistic entertainment forms . Criezis , formerly associated with good Greek restaurants such_as the Great Greek and Cafe Athens , has a menu here that is a mix of New Orleans , California and the Mediterranean . Don ' t miss Texas Gulf crab cakes with red Apache sauce , Opelousas black roux seafood gumbo , great Italian-style scampi or the caviar roe whipped with avocado puree . Shhhh . We won ' t tell anybody this is a fancied_up Greek dish called taramo . 13730 Ventura Blvd. , Sherman Oaks . ( 818 ) 788-2000 ; reservations recommended . Expensive . 15 . La Pergola The ebullient Tino Pettignano raises his own produce -- pumpkin , squash , peppers , green_beans , artichokes -- in 6 # 000 square_feet of gardens behind his restaurant . For that alone , he deserves some kind of award . His restaurant is also loaded with charm -- a beamed ceiling , white brick walls , gorgeous Italian pottery , all_of which makes La Pergola a compelling destination . Try stuffed zucchini flowers ; good , fresh pastas such_as panzerotti , a giant pocket filled with white corn and prosciutto , and the sumptuous fettuccine del giardino , made with spring fennel , Maui onions and pine_nuts . 15005 Ventura Blvd. , Sherman Oaks . ( 818 ) 905-8402 ; reservations recommended . Expensive . 16 . Jin Hung Won Chinese cuisine takes chameleonic shapes throughout Asia ; perhaps nowhere is it more immediately appealing than in Korea . This modest North Hills restaurant serves the Valley ' s best Chinese cooking , in part because it hasn ' t yet learned to be insincere , in part because of the pervasive Korean influences . Ask_for cha jiang min , sticky wheat noodles in brown_sauce , the exemplary steamed dumplings , an irresistible thing called spicy crispy chicken and stewed meatballs -- fine , fatty pork meatballs with heavily browned crusts . Bring a healthy appetite . 9102 Sepulveda Blvd. , North Hills . ( 818 ) 893-6656 . Inexpensive to moderate . 17 . Barcelona Spanish food is but a distant cousin of Mexican , robust Mediterranean fare dependent_on olives , rice , tomato and seafood . Jose Maria Companys is from Spain ' s Catalonia ; his modest grill is decorated in rustic appointments . Foods are straightforward , grilled meats or the tiny appetizers known as tapas . Try a blood_sausage called morcilla or chorizo , a fatty Spanish sausage ; saffron-rich paella chock full of lobster , sausage and large prawns ; the peasant-style , charcoal-grilled chicken , and the wonderfully eggy dessert , crema Catalana . 14054 Burbank Blvd. , Van Nuys , ( 818 ) 997-6604 ; reservations recommended . Inexpensive to moderate . 18 . Montana ' s Bar and Grill Another new addition that has made a reasonably big splash , this quasi-American bistro , which occupies a former L ' Express , succeeds on sheer energy . The decor in here is Late Grunge , the food mostly American comfort . Montana ' s makes some of the best Buffalo_wings in the city ; chewy interesting pastas , and good , solid American entrees such_as meatloaf , pork chops and a crusty , smooth turkey pot pie . One more selling point is the sensible half portions , available on all but a_few items . 3575 Cahuenga Blvd . West , Universal City . ( 213 ) 850-6220 ; reservations recommended . Moderate . 19 . Vegetable Delight This remarkable Chinese restaurant fashions wonders out of gluten , tofu , mushrooms , yam paste and nuts , the handiwork of a shy Chinese chef who learned his craft among Buddhists on the island of Taiwan . Don ' t be put_off by a name like &quot; smoked veggie fish. &quot; It ' s made from pressed tofu sheets , looks exactly like real fish and tastes terrific . The only thing the chef has failed to reproduce are the bones . Among the many delights are onion pancakes , hot pot with Napa cabbage , assorted mushrooms and mock meat balls , and an amazing &quot; squid &quot; made from yam paste . 17823 Chatsworth St. , Granada Hills . ( 818 ) 360-3997 . Moderate . 20 . Tribeca One more restaurant that came traipsing over the_hill in 1994 was Tribeca . The restaurant makes this list on chutzpah and enthusiasm . The bar is a scene , packed with attractive young_men and women ; the dining_area is problematic with undersized tables , hard-backed chairs . The kitchen can be erratic . Solid American cooking is the saving grace -- terrific swordfish with olive_oil , basil and capers ; good blackened prime rib , encrusted with pepper . Desserts are a treat -- pear shortcake , a tart plum cobbler , the bittersweet cappuccino creme_brulee . 17401 Ventura Blvd. , Encino . ( 818 ) 386-1339 ; reservations recommended . Moderate to expensive .</TEXT>
