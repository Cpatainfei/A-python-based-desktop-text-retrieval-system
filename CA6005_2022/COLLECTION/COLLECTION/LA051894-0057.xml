   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : STATUS REPORT ON PIPELINES DELAYED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A status report on risks associated with oil and gas pipelines crisscrossing beneath county soil was postponed Tuesday by Ventura County supervisors at the request of John K . Flynn , who was absent from the board_meeting . The Board of Supervisors was also scheduled to discuss applying for a federal grant to pay_for a costly inventory of the network of pipes to help prevent future leaks.Four serious oil spills have occurred in the past five months . No such map exists , state and local officials concede . An aide to Flynn said Tuesday that the supervisor , who represents the Oxnard area , was in Agoura Hills attending a water forum . The risk assessment was ordered by supervisors within days of an 84 # 000-gallon oil spill at McGrath Lake near Oxnard in December in which hundreds of migratory birds and other species were killed . Since then , three other pipeline-related spills have been discovered in the county . The matter is scheduled to be considered next week . JEFF McDONALD</TEXT>
