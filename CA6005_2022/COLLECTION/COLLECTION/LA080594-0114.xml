   <HEADLINE> 8 CIVILIANS KILLED IN ISRAELI AIR STRIKE ON LEBANON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eight Lebanese civilians were killed Thursday when Israel conducted its first strike against the militant Islamic group Hezbollah since the government accused it of attacking Jewish and Israeli institutions abroad , south Lebanese security sources said . An Israeli army spokeswoman apologized for what she said was the mistaken bombing of a home_in the village of Deir Zahrani . The spokeswoman said that &quot; innocent civilians are not a target &quot; and that the army &quot; expresses sorrow for the casualties. &quot; Israel Radio reported that the incident is under investigation by the army . The air_raid came one day before U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher is_due to arrive in Damascus , Syria , for another attempt at breaking the deadlock in peace negotiations between the Israelis and Syrians . Thursday ' s incident is likely to heighten the already tense atmosphere in southern Lebanon , where Israel and Iranian-backed Hezbollah are engaged in deadly tit-for-tat strikes against each other . Hezbollah has threatened to fire rockets into northern Israel if Israel strikes at it in southern Lebanon . South Lebanese security sources said eight people were killed and up_to 15 injured in the attack on Deir Zahrani . The sources said a home and adjacent shop were flattened in a direct hit from a missile fired from an Israeli jet . A husband and wife and their two children were among the dead . Two other adults and two children were also reportedly killed . The sources said two earlier air_raids struck at a Hezbollah base in the village of Ein Bouswar , located midway between the Mediterranean port of Sidon , southern Lebanon ' s largest city , and the inland town of Nabatiyeh . Nabatiyeh borders Israel ' s 440-square-mile , self-proclaimed security zone above its northern border . The Israelis have occupied the strip since 1985 , contending they must secure the border from Katyusha rocket attacks and terrorist incursions . Lebanese sources said four Israeli jet fighters first fired four missiles on Ein Bouswar , then returned and fired a fifth missile an hour later , reportedly as guerrillas were picking through the rubble of the first strike . Three jets then reportedly attacked Deir Zahrani . There were no reports of casualties among guerrillas in Ein Bouswar . Thousands of Lebanese began fleeing their villages in the south last month , seeking safety in the north after Israel threatened to make Hezbollah pay_for bomb attacks on a Jewish community_center in Buenos Aires and on the Israeli Embassy and another Jewish community_center in London . Up to 100 people died in the Buenos Aires blast . Villagers had begun coming_home recently , according to Lebanese news_reports , believing that the Israelis had decided not to strike . Israel accused Hezbollah and Iran of carrying_out last month ' s attacks , which Jerusalem said were meant to derail the peace process . Iran has denied involvement in the bombings , as have prominent Hezbollah sheiks . Hezbollah is funded and armed by Iran , and has vowed to sabotage Israel ' s peace negotiations with the Palestinians and Arab states . After the Buenos Aires attack , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin called_for cooperation among Western governments and intelligence organizations to thwart Hezbollah violence .</TEXT>
