   <TEXT> In a city known for environmental righteousness , Carl and Anya Woestwin are among the most righteous of all . Anya hoards plastic produce bags , washing and reusing them until they fall_apart . Carl urinates into a milk carton , then uses it to fertilize their organic garden . What ' s more , Carl and Anya insist , they enjoy every minute of their low-impact lifestyle . &quot; This is not privation , &quot; Anya said . &quot; The basic goal is to use as few external resource inputs as possible , produce as much as possible -- and have a really good time. &quot; Good time ? Environmentalism ? Not many people would mention those ideas in the same breath . Environmental responsibility , once a comfortable enough notion when the villains were corporate polluters with belching smokestacks , has become more personal . Pollution control increasingly focuses not on the_likes_of Acme Slag &amp; Sludge but on small excesses committed daily by ordinary citizens . Do you know anybody , like maybe yourself , who can ' t be bothered to sort trash into recycling bins ? Or who uses a smoke-billowing lawn_mower that ' s been kicking_around the garage since the 1960s ? Or who , when nobody ' s looking , dumps the black ick from an oil_change in the back yard ? Such penny-ante polluters have become the environmental scoundrels of the 1990s , judging from all_the new rules cracking_down on them : * The federal Environmental Protection Agency last spring proposed new air-pollution standards for lawn_mowers , then followed up in October by clamping_down on recreational motorboats . * Last winter in Denver , residents were ordered not to use fireplaces or wood stoves 132 times , or nearly half the days that anyone would want a fire , in an effort to clear_up the city ' s infamous Brown Cloud . * More_than 6 # 600 communities nationwide now have curbside recycling programs , up from about 1 # 000 just five years ago . Many are mandatory , requiring households to use separate bins for glass , cans and paper . * Smog-control officials in the San Francisco area urged residents in September not to use aerosol deodorants , barbecue lighter fluid or even alcohol-based perfumes , all_in the name of reducing gases that create smog . &quot; As we have gotten the biggies under_control , the smaller sources of pollution become more important , &quot; said Jerry Martin , spokesman for the California Air Resources Board . &quot; We cracked_down on industry , and the cheap and easy things have been done , &quot; agreed Carol Piening , an air quality planner with the Washington state_Department of Ecology . &quot; If we want the air to continue to get cleaner , it ' s time for people to take personal responsibility. &quot; How to promote that responsibility , and how much responsibility is really necessary , are matters of fierce debate -- a debate that ' s sure to continue as the new Republican-controlled Congress takes a hard look_at the proliferation of environmental regulations . Should government mandate environmental consciousness , with stiff fines for violators ? Should it try to shame people into less-polluting lifestyles with education campaigns ? Either way , some conservatives say , environmentalists and their allies in government are threatening the economy by forcing an excuse-me-for-living mentality on Americans . &quot; It ' s a deliberate , calculated , longstanding agenda to gain control over people ' s personal lives , &quot; said Ron Arnold , executive_vice_president of the Center for the Defense of Free_Enterprise and a leader of the anti-environmentalist Wise Use movement . People would revolt if they were told &quot; you have to do these things because you must obey us , &quot; Arnold said . &quot; But if you catch them in this green guilt , then they go_along with it like sheep . They beg for regimentation . They say , ' Enslave me , please , ' and America begins to look_like a bondage movie. &quot; Not surprisingly , Carl and Anya Woestwin disagree . They believe the new environmental laws are a needed antidote for Americans ' wasteful ways . But what is surprising is that Arnold and the Woestwins agree at all , which they do . After railing for 45 minutes against liberal , anti-business tree-worshippers , Arnold caught his breath by boasting how he and his family recycle their trash at_home in Bellevue , across Lake Washington from Seattle . Like Seattle , the city of Bellevue provides recycling bins and curbside pick-up , then charges for unsorted trash by the can . The more a family recycles , the less trash it produces and the less it pays . Arnold is proud that his family uses the smallest trash_can allowed . But rather than call it environmental responsibility , he considers it old-fashioned frugality . The economic incentive is the key , Arnold said . &quot; There is some genuine personal benefit &quot; to voluntary recycling , he said . &quot; If a person wants to be a wastrel and a spendthrift , there shouldn ' t be a law against it. &quot; Frugality is something the Woestwins appreciate . Nearly all_of what they do to live lightly on the earth also happens to save them money . They buy their clothes secondhand , and they own one car , a Honda Civic that they drive about 6 # 000 miles each year . Carl , 49 , bicycles to work_at the Seattle Solid Waste Utility , where he manages waste-reduction programs . He totes his lunch in a nylon bag , returning at night with a newspaper scrounged from the employee lunchroom . Their modest two-story house sits on a 52-by-110-foot city lot that they ' ve filled with fruit_trees and edible shrubs . Chickens scratch beneath their deck , laying organic eggs . Anya , 42 , never goes_to the natural foods store without her shopping kit of three canvas bags , old bottles for bulk purchases , reused plastic bags and a little bundle of frayed twist ties . In the fall , while neighbors raked their leaves into the street to be picked_up by city crews , Carl raked them back into his yard to mulch his blueberry_bushes and garden . While Arnold complains about feeling hemmed_in by the new , more intimate brand of environmentalism , the Woestwins say their trimmed-down lifestyle feels liberating . They say they ' re not into guilt , either . &quot; I don ' t feel_like I ' m wearing a hair_shirt at all , &quot; said Carl . &quot; This is sort of a hobby for us . There ' s a learning curve , but there ' s no pain in doing_it -- and there ' s a lot of satisfaction. &quot; Purists would find_fault even with the Woestwins , especially now that there ' s a toddler in their house . The thermostat has crept_up from 60 degrees . And Carl uneasily confesses that they use disposable diapers on 3-year-old Sam , because cloth diapers give the boy a rash . &quot; If some people see this article , they ' ll think I ' m a real traitor , &quot; Carl said . An anti-green activist who recycles religiously ? Environmental zealots who use Pampers ? Perhaps it was inevitable , as the environmental movement grew more personal , that ideological lines would blur . &quot; I think that ' s good , &quot; Carl said . For him and Anya , the essence of environmental responsibility lies not in the details , not in a_thousand thou-shalt-nots , but in the spirit of living less destructively . &quot; If you ' re mindful about your life and the choices you want to make , you keep finding little ways to move_in that direction , &quot; Anya said .</TEXT>
