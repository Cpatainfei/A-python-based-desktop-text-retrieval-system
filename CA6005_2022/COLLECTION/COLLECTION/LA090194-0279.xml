   <HEADLINE> SCIENTISTS FIND DEFECTIVE GENE LINKED TO SKIN_CANCER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scientists have identified a defective gene that appears to cause an inherited tendency to the deadly skin_cancer melanoma and may also play a role in non-inherited melanoma . In its normal state , the gene acts_as a brake on cancer . But people who inherit a defective version apparently lose part of the protection , making them unusually vulnerable to melanoma , the researchers said . About 32 # 000 melanoma cases and nearly 7 # 000 melanoma deaths are expected in the United States this year . Only about 10 % of melanoma occurs in people with an inherited tendency and it is unclear what percentage of inherited cases are because of the gene . Defective versions of the gene may also be involved in many , or maybe even most , cases of non-inherited melanoma , researchers said . In those cases , the gene would be inherited in normal form but later damaged by sunlight or other causes . Studying the gene may eventually lead to better treatments for the non-inherited disease , researchers said . More immediately , the discovery of a susceptibility gene could be used to screen for people at risk for melanoma . They could be counseled to take steps such_as limiting exposure to the sun , keeping track of possibly precancerous moles and using sunscreen , researchers said . The normal gene tells the body how to make a protein called p16 , which helps regulate cell_division . Prior studies suggested the p16 gene discourages tumors . Previous studies also indicated defective versions play a role in cancer . The new work is reported in the September issue of the journal Nature Genetics by two independent teams of researchers . One study was done_by Nicholas Dracopoli of the National Center for Human Genome Research , part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Md. , and colleagues at NIH and elsewhere . They found nine of 18 melanoma-prone families they screened showed defects in the p16 gene that appeared related to the disease . In the nine families , the gene was defective in 33 out of 36 people with melanoma . The second study was done_by Alexander Kamb of Myriad Genetics Inc. in Salt_Lake_City with scientists at the University of Utah and elsewhere . They studied 13 families who already appeared to have a predisposition to melanoma from some abnormality in the neighborhood of the p16 gene . The researchers found a defective p16 gene in two of the families . They found no evidence of a defective p16 gene in 38 other melanoma-prone families . Nonetheless , the Utah and NIH studies &quot; really support each other , fundamentally , &quot; Kamb said , noting that two types of p16 gene defects appeared in both studies .</TEXT>
