   <HEADLINE> INTEL SEEKS TO BLOCK SHIPMENT OF CLONE CHIPS BY RIVAL AMD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Intel Corp . said it will ask a judge to block rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. from shipping clones of 486 microprocessors containing an obscure software code . Intel , the world ' s largest maker of microprocessors , or chips , also plans to seek compensation from AMD for the millions of AMD 486 chips already sold , said Jim Jarrett , a spokesman for Santa Clara-based Intel . The announcements follow U.S. District Judge Patricia Trumbull ' s ruling that AMD , the fifth-largest maker of computer chips , violated copyright laws by including a proprietary Intel code in the chips . The 486 is currently the most popular type of microprocessor , controlling the logic functions in about 30 million personal_computers in_use . AMD has sold more_than 4 million of the chips , but claims only about 100 # 000 of them are affected by the ruling . Those chips will be altered or destroyed with no material effect on company earnings , said Jerry Sanders , AMD ' s chairman and chief_executive . &quot; Our main concern is being sure that we can continue our product supply to our customer base , and we ' re confident we can do that , &quot; said Sanders , who claimed Intel wants to shut AMD out of the lucrative 486 market . AMD shares closed_down 62.5 cents at $ 24.625 on the New York Stock_Exchange . Intel , which traded on the Nasdaq , closed_up 6.25 cents at $ 60.50. The ruling , the latest in a decade of legal battles between the one-time allies , came_in a lawsuit filed four years ago over so-called in-circuit emulation , or ICE , code that is contained in software embedded on the chip . The code is used typically by chip designers , but was used by AMD to help manage power in about 100 # 000 chips . Sanders noted most computer users don ' t even know the code is there , and couldn ' t access it if they did know about it .</TEXT>
