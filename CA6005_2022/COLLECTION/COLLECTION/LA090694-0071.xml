   <HEADLINE> NEW CANCER SURGERY MODE IS DEVELOPED ; HEALTH : THE DYE TECHNIQUE MAY PREVENT UNNECESSARY REMOVAL OF LYMPH_GLANDS IN BREAST MALIGNANCIES . ITS APPLICATION IN OTHER PROCEDURES IS ALSO UNDER STUDY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new procedure that could minimize unnecessary surgery for breast_cancer patients and help guide their therapy has been developed by surgeons at the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica . The new technique , which involves injection of a blue dye into a tumor before it is surgically removed , makes_it easier for surgeons to determine whether the cancer has metastasized -- or spread into the lymph_glands -- Dr. Armando Giuliano and his colleagues report today in the journal Annals of Surgery . If the dye-mapping procedure shows that cancer has not spread , the patient is spared the painful removal of her lymph_glands , speeding her recovery and reducing costs , Giuliano said . &quot; This is a very worthy piece of research . . . that has the potential of simplifying the surgical treatment of this disease , &quot; said Dr. Bernard Gardner of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey . &quot; If his ( Giuliano ' s ) preliminary work holds_up , it may allow us to be much more selective in who undergoes that particular part of the operative procedure , &quot; added Dr. Walter Laurence , a surgical oncologist at the Medical College of Virginia . &quot; I think the early results look very promising. &quot; The technique is already the subject of an international study examining its use against melanoma , the most deadly form of skin_cancer , and Giuliani is planning a similar trial against breast_cancer , he said . He and his colleagues are also studying the potential for using the technique with other types of cancer . Breast_cancer is the leading form of cancer in women , striking an estimated 182 # 000 each year and killing 46 # 000 , according to the American Cancer Society . Experts predict that one woman out of every nine will develop breast_cancer at some point in their lives . The standard treatment for breast_cancer is the surgical removal of either the tumor itself or the entire affected breast . Surgeons also routinely remove all_of the 25 to 30 lymph_glands that are associated with the affected breast and inspect them for signs of spread . If metastasis has occurred , the patient generally receives chemotherapy , radiation or both . Removal of the lymph_glands does not generally provoke life-threatening complications , Giuliano said , but it can be uncomfortable and irritating . Typical problems include potential nerve injury , a swollen arm and limited arm motion , all_of which can impede recovery from the breast surgery itself . The lymph_glands are also part of the body ' s immune_system , and their removal produces a small impairment of immunity , he added . Ideally , then , recovery of the patient is most rapid if lymph_gland removal can be avoided , but leaving_behind lymph_glands with cancer_cells in them can be fatal . Giuliano ' s approach , originally developed by his colleague Dr. Donald L . Morton , is to find the single lymph_gland that is most likely to contain a cancer_cell -- what he terms a &quot; sentinel &quot; gland . That approach is possible because individual lymph_glands in a region are strung together like a series of lakes connected by rivers . Each lake is fed by its own tributary system , and anything that enters a lake through its tributaries is then spread to other lakes through the larger waterways . In the same fashion , each lymph_node is fed by its own &quot; tributaries &quot; -- tiny , almost invisible axilla that drain a specific region of tissue . The sentinel gland is the particular lymph_gland whose axilla drain the region where the tumor is located . Unfortunately , the sentinel gland cannot be identified by sight . Morton reasoned that if he injected a dye into the tumor , it would quickly show_up in the sentinel gland . &quot; It ' s so simple that everyone asks , ' Why didn ' t somebody think_of it a long_time ago ? ' &quot; Giuliano said . In the current procedure , the researchers inject 3 to 5 milliliters of a dark_blue dye into the tumor itself , or , if it has already been removed , into the tissue at the site . Within five minutes , the dye travels_to the sentinel lymph_gland . The surgeons then dissect the tissue at the site to follow the axilla and locate and remove the sentinel gland . Theoretically , then , if the sentinel gland contains no cancer_cells , the remaining glands would be left intact . If it does contain tumor cells , all glands would be removed . In today ' s paper , the team reports on the examination of 174 women who were undergoing conventional breast_cancer surgery and who had all their glands removed . In 114 of them , doctors were able to identify the sentinel gland before the glands were removed . In 109 of those 114 cases , the presence or absence of tumor cells in the sentinel gland correctly showed whether the cancer had metastasized . Giuliano pointed_out that all_of the mistakes occurred early in the study while the researchers were developing the procedure . &quot; There ' s a very real learning curve , &quot; he said . He and his colleagues are currently organizing a large-scale trial of the technique to determine its reliability . If the procedure is validated there , he concluded , surgeons would have a valuable tool to determine whether a women would have to suffer the pain and inconvenience of having her lymph_nodes removed along with her breast .</TEXT>
