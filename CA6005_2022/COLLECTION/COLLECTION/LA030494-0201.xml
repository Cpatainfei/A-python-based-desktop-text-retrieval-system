   <HEADLINE> QUAKE RENEWS DEBATE OVER VERTICAL THRUST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Of all_the brutal surprises of the Northridge earthquake , its intense vertical motion has been one of the most discussed . The quake ' s strong upward heaving has become a popular explanation for the failure of parking garages and other structures that were fortified only against lateral force . To underscore the unexpected power of the quake ' s upward motion , some owners and designers of trashed buildings have noted that the Uniform Building_Code , adopted as law by California cities and counties , does not significantly address vertical thrust as a cause of structural failure . But more_than two decades ago , an official with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote that the Sylmar earthquake of 1971 &quot; produced evidence of vertical accelerations far in excess of any ever recorded instrumentally. &quot; And a committee of the Oakland-based Earthquake Engineering Research Institute , discussing the effects of the Sylmar quake , cited &quot; strong evidences of severe vertical accelerations which could contribute to increased damage. &quot; Similar descriptions of the Northridge quake may be a case of &quot; short-term engineering memory , &quot; as one government seismologist put it . In the wake of the Northridge temblor , engineers involved in the code-revision process say the significance of vertical motion -- on the back burner since the Sylmar quake -- deserves another look . But as if to illustrate that little about an earthquake is simple , some experts still doubt that vertical thrust played a primary role in structural failures . These authorities fear the vertical explanation is being oversold and may divert attention from what they consider to be a more pervasive problem -- strong cost-cutting pressures that can lead to inadequate designs . &quot; It ' s always nice to blame Mother Nature , &quot; but blame is &quot; as much on the human side as the nature side , &quot; said Helmut Krawinkler , co-director of the John A . Blume Earthquake Engineering Center at Stanford_University . &quot; I ' m not in the group that ' s ready to jump_on the vertical bandwagon , &quot; said Wilfred D . Iwan , director of Caltech ' s Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory and chairman of the state Seismic Safety Commission . &quot; But everywhere I go I hear people using this to explain the poor performance of certain structures. &quot; As currently written , the building_code reflects the prevailing view that the risk of structural collapse in a big quake stems from sideways shaking . That consensus survived the Sylmar quake , at least partly because the significance -- and even the accuracy -- of its high vertical-thrust recordings were a matter of dispute . Centered beneath the San Gabriel Mountains , the Sylmar quake had a magnitude of 6.4. At the time , only a_few strong-motion accelerographs were deployed in the immediate quake area . These instruments measure the lateral and vertical ground motion at specific points as a fraction of the force of gravity -- expressed as 1.0g. One instrument at Pacoima Dam above Sylmar recorded extraordinarily sharp vertical peaks of . 5g to . 75g . But many experts were not impressed , and when the code was strengthened in 1974 , the revisions did not reflect this finding . &quot; People tended to discard that record ( at Pacoima Dam ) as unrepresentative , &quot; said Filip Filippou of the Earthquake Engineering Research_Center at UC Berkeley . It &quot; always had some kind of aura of unbelievability to it because it was just one . . . . Maybe it explains a little bit why we haven ' t done anything , if you want to call it that. &quot; Some questioned the accuracy of the reading , believing that the instrument ' s perch atop a steep ridge above the dam made_it vulnerable to topographic effects . Debate continued for years on whether the readings were valid or &quot; aberrations due_to instrumental error . . . because the strong-motion recording instruments don ' t always work , &quot; said Bob Chittendon , chairman of the seismology committee of the Structural Engineers Assn . of California . Chittendon ' s organization is largely responsible_for the code updates published every three years , drafting changes for the International Conference of Building Officials , which administers the code . Chittendon and others described code revision as a ponderous , consensus-building process in which changes often take years to effect . &quot; There is a tremendous inertia in the profession , &quot; said Vitelmo Bertero , a research engineer with the Earthquake Engineering Research_Center in Berkeley . Engineers , like other people , tend &quot; to forget very soon the bad things , &quot; so that &quot; if something is not done after two or three years after an earthquake , they forget about it , &quot; Bertero said . &quot; This is the real problem. &quot; Bertero and others said vertical motion deserves a new look based on the record of the Northridge quake . Still , several experts noted that the temblor ' s vertical thrust was not as remarkable as the intensity of its ground motion generally . &quot; This earthquake stands_out , both in its horizontals and verticals , as being high , &quot; said Paul Somerville , an engineering seismologist with Woodward-Clyde Consultants in Pasadena . &quot; It looks_like ground motion you ' d expect from a larger ( than magnitude 6.8 ) earthquake. &quot; However , Somerville and others said that the vertical accelerations at most sites were about two-thirds of the horizontal thrust , as is typical . &quot; I don ' t see anything unusual about the vertical ground motion , &quot; Somerville said . &quot; In relation_to the horizontal motions , the vertical motions weren ' t exceptional. &quot; At one site in Tarzana , an accelerograph recorded an extraordinarily high peak horizontal force of 1.8g -- nearly twice the force of gravity -- and a vertical acceleration of 1.2g. Pacoima Dam again recorded the highest readings , including horizontal and vertical accelerations as strong as 2.01g and 1.6g respectively . At least three other sites in the quake area -- in Newhall , Sylmar and Arleta -- experienced vertical thrust of more_than . 5g , according to data from the state Division of Mines and Geology ' s strong-motion instrumentation program . Nearly silent on the question of vertical motion , the building_code assumes that the ability of structures to hold their own weight , with a margin of safety , is sufficient to prevent collapse from upward earthquake thrust . In post-mortems on the collapsed parking structures at Cal State Northridge and the Northridge Fashion Center , engineers involved in designing those projects suggested that the blind_spot in the code accounted_for the failures . Some experts said long-span structures such_as parking garages , bridges and roadways may be particularly vulnerable to vertical thrust . &quot; Personally , I think we need to address the vertical accelerations , &quot; Chittendon said . Others , however , including Ron Hamburger , a member of the seismology committee of the structural engineers association , believe the vertical explanation may be diverting attention from poor design . &quot; It may eventually be found that vertical ground motion was a factor_in some collapses , &quot; Hamburger said . &quot; But based on my own observations , the structures which performed poorly generally had significant problems in their lateral load-resisting systems and would probably have done poorly even if no vertical ground motion had occurred. &quot; With respect_to sideways motion , experts said the code requires structures to successfully resist earthquakes with lateral accelerations of . 4g , but they said well-designed buildings should stand_up to considerably greater loads . &quot; There should be almost no chance of collapse at . 4g , &quot; Hamburger said . &quot; The ( code ' s ) intent is that you will not collapse for any earthquake you will ever see. &quot; In fact , accelerograph recordings during the Northridge earthquake show that peak horizontal motion was_well above . 4g at some locations . &quot; This is probably the first event . . . that really tested the code at probably the upper_limit , &quot; said Bill Holmes , a member of an Earthquake Engineering Research Institute reconnaissance team that inspected quake damage . There was &quot; very intense shaking right under a populated area , so many code-designed structures were tested , and with the exception of parking structures that collapsed , one could make the argument . . . that most of the structures were successful , &quot; Holmes said . Holmes and others noted that earthquake stress on buildings is more complex than what is reflected in ground-motion readings . Both seismic waves and buildings have frequencies , and the building will not take the full wallop of energy unless the frequency of the strongest waves are roughly matched with the frequency of the building . Thus , large peak ground motion , if carried_on high-frequency waves , may trigger little shaking in a building of much lower_frequency . Because the Northridge quake came within months of a scheduled code update , most major revisions will have to wait until 1997 . As has been the case in the past , the aim of code improvements will not be to prevent building damage -- which is forecast in major quakes -- but to avert life-threatening collapses . But code improvements are only half the battle , some experts say , due_to a tendency to design buildings to the raw edge of the code . &quot; The code is not the maximum . The code is the minimum , &quot; Chittendon said . &quot; You need to do things in addition to the code. &quot; But as Krawinkler put it : &quot; If you provide more safety . . . it doesn ' t come for free . &quot; If you tell me money is no object , I could guarantee you that I can design a building so that it will not collapse in any conceivable earthquake , &quot; he said . But &quot; money is always an object. &quot; * RELATED STORIES : B1 Earth ' s Moves Faults are fractures in the earth ' s crust along which vertical and horizontal movements have taken_place . The Northridge quake occurred on a thrust_fault , causing more vertical movement than it would have_on a strike slip fault . Strike Slip Fault Movement is along adjacent horizontal planes and the fault plane , the rocks affected by faulting , is nearly vertical . The two sides slide past each other horizontally during a quake , causing sideways movement . The San Andreas fault is the largest such fault in California . Thrust_Fault Movement is characterized by upward motion and the fault is inclined , usually dipping between 25 and 60 degrees . The block sitting on top of the plane moves_up and past the block below the plane , causing both horizontal and vertical motion . Vertical motion during the Northridge quake was six to nine feet at the depth of the fault , about 11 miles below the surface , according to experts . A fault at a 45-degree angle would produce about equal horizontal and vertical movement ; one at more_than 45 degrees would produce more vertical and less horizontal movement . The previously unknown fault that caused the Northridge quake is believed to be about 35 degrees , producing a bit more horizontal than vertical movement .
