   <HEADLINE> VIETNAM DELEGATION OPTIMISTIC ; TRADE : ORANGE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES SEE BRIGHT PROSPECTS FOR BUSINESS IN COMMUNIST NATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Newly arrived to this communist country , an American trade delegation including Orange County Vietnamese expatriates is finding signs of budding capitalism . About a dozen of the Americans on Monday were surprised by an aggressive street vendor who thrust a T-shirt through an open window of their parked van . But before the vendor could complete the deal , the van sped away . Determined to make a sale , the Vietnamese woman hopped_on a nearby motorbike and tailed the van about two miles back to the hotel . She closed the deal . &quot; would n ' t you like to have a sales force like that ? &quot; said Richard Elliott , 54 , a regional director of Sherwin-Williams , the paint manufacturer . &quot; I am amazed by the people here . They are always working and very resourceful. &quot; In their first full day in Vietnam , most of the 24 American delegates expressed optimism about the business prospects in Vietnam . On Monday , the group met with high-ranking leaders of government and business who may soon become willing partners in helping American businesses ease into the Vietnamese marketplace . &quot; We hope the presence of all_of us here will build a bridge between the U.S. and Vietnam , &quot; said Co Pham , president of the Vietnamese Chamber_of_Commerce in Orange County . Today the group is scheduled to meet with Vietnamese Vice_President Nguyen Thi Binh . And on Thursday the group will travel_to Ho Chi Minh City for another round of meetings with business and government heads . In addition to Pham , two other Orange County delegates have emerged as the group heavyweights -- Kenneth Moore , president of Orange County Chamber_of_Commerce , and Dunson Cheng , chairman of Cathay Bank . Cheng , head of Little Saigon ' s largest Asian-American-run bank , and Moore were given special treatment , including a private car and audiences with the Vietnamese deputy premier , the country ' s deputy foreign_minister , and the general secretary of the Vietnamese Chamber_of_Commerce . At each stop Monday , Moore impressed upon local officials that Orange County ' s 80 # 000 businesses and 2.5 million people could serve as an important boost to the fledgling local economy . Orange County has the largest population of Vietnamese outside Vietnam . &quot; I hope we ( the countywide chamber ) are a valued , added component to the trade mission , &quot; said Moore , 51 , who has been the organization ' s president for two years . &quot; Interest in Vietnam is wider than just the overseas Vietnamese . In fact , there is a broad-based interest in Orange County to do business with Vietnam. &quot; This year , international trade and investment with Vietnam is expected to total about $ 9 billion , according to the United States-Vietnamese Trade Council in Washington . Moore said the county chamber officials considered the trade mission so important that they scraped together $ 5 # 000 from their depleted budget to send him . Cheng , 50 , is also encouraged about the business outlook between Orange County and the Southeast Asian_country . Cheng is evaluating whether Cathay Bank can become a major player in connecting Southern California and Vietnamese businesses . &quot; For the rest of the stay here , I would like to meet local bankers to understand the banking_industry , &quot; Cheng said . Cheng is most concerned about the stability of the Vietnamese economy and ensuring that foreign investments are not wasted . He asked deputy foreign_minister Le Mai about Vietnam ' s chances in gaining most-favored nation status with the United States . Similarly , Pham asked government officials to consider proposals that would allow overseas Vietnamese to claim or buy back property lost when they fled the war-torn country . Pham also asked officials to relax their policies so that foreigners -- and especially overseas Vietnamese -- could own property in Vietnam . According to deputy foreign_minister Mai , Vietnam is striving to rebuild its economy and cannot commit to the group ' s requests as yet . He said Vietnam must first commit itself to upgrading the country ' s infrastructure -- especially roads , bridges and its communications network . &quot; We are still a developing a nation , &quot; Mai said . &quot; Many things require patience. &quot; However , Mai said the Vietnamese economy is improving , pointing to an annual growth_rate that could reach 9 % next year . He added that Vietnam would like to send thousands of college_students to the United States for an education . While Vietnamese leaders have welcomed the American trade mission , some Orange County Vietnamese strongly opposed the delegation ' s direct contact with the communist regime . Before the delegates ' departure , several hundred protesters converged on Pham ' s office to denounce the impending visit . But the American delegates seemed pleased with what they ' ve heard and seen of the business climate thus far . The trade delegation really consists_of 24 smaller missions , with each person advancing a particular business agenda . Some want to export aviation equipment , others are promoting food processing systems or laundry_detergents . Another delegate is a real_estate developer . &quot; There are still a lot questions to get answered , &quot; Elliott said . &quot; We want to come here and make a buck and not to lose_it . So how do we deal with the communists ? &quot;</TEXT>
