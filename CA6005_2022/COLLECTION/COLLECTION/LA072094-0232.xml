   <HEADLINE> HONDA PLANS MAJOR EXPANSION IN U.S. , CANADA ; AUTOS : NEW PRODUCTION GOALS MEAN MORE THAN 1 # 000 JOBS . CURRENCY VALUES FIGURE IN THE MOVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Honda Motor Co . said Tuesday that it will hire 1 # 100 workers and invest $ 310 million to expand its automobile manufacturing , research and development and export activities in North_America . The action gives Honda ' s top officials in Torrance more autonomy in decisions affecting the North_American market . It also gives those officials control over the development of markets in Central and South_America . &quot; Honda in North_America will expand its capabilities to become a self-reliant , globally integrated company , &quot; Koichi Amemiya , president of American Honda Motor Co. , told a news_conference . The expansion comes as Japanese auto_makers have been hurt by the rise of the yen against the dollar . By moving more manufacturing to North_America , Honda can minimize the impact of currency fluctuations . &quot; It makes a lot of sense for Honda , &quot; said Chris Cedergren , an analyst with Auto Pacific Group , a Santa Ana-based consultant . &quot; Other Japanese manufacturers are following the same plan. &quot; Honda ' s North_American expansion is part of a broader reorganization , announced in May , that focuses the company ' s operations on four regions : North and South_America , Europe and Africa , Asia and the Pacific and Japan . * It is the largest investment Honda has made in North_America since 1987 , when the auto_maker decided to build a second assembly_plant in Ohio and expand its U.S. research and development efforts . Honda plans to expand the capacity of assembly_plants in Ohio and Canada by 18 % to 720 # 000 vehicles a year . It will also increase the capacity of its Ohio engine factory by 50 % to 750 # 000 units annually . Most of the expansion will take_place at Honda ' s East Liberty plant in Ohio , which turns_out Civic sedans and coupes . The plant ' s capacity will be raised to 230 # 000 vehicles a year from 150 # 000 . &quot; This will be done without ( enlarging ) the physical plant , &quot; said Takeski Yamada , president of Honda ' s U.S. manufacturing unit . However , about 400 workers will be added , he said . Production capacity will be increased by 20 # 000 vehicles yearly at both the Marysville plant in Ohio and the Alliston facility in Ontario , Canada . Marysville can turn_out 360 # 000 cars annually now ; Alliston ' s capacity is 100 # 000 . Honda also plans to increase the capacity of its engine plant in Anna , Ohio , by 50 % by 1998 . The plant will be able to produce 750 # 000 engines a year , among them a new V-6 to be produced beginning in 1996 . The expansion will cost $ 200 million and require 200 additional employees . In research and development , the company will greatly increase its ability to design vehicles for North_America and other markets . Its research and development effort is to be expanded to 750 employees from 500 in the next five years . This will allow the company to develop two Acura models for production in 1996 -- one for the U.S. and Canadian markets and one solely for Canada . The new Acuras will be the first Japanese luxury cars built_in North_America . Honda also plans to step_up exports of U.S. and Canadian vehicles to more_than 150 # 000 vehicles a year , including components sent to other countries for assembly . The company said it expects to export about 75 # 000 vehicles , excluding the component kits , to 35 countries this year . * Cedergren said that with Honda ' s partnership with British-based Rover Group ( acquired by BMW earlier this year ) coming_to an end , the Japanese auto_maker is looking_to export cars from North_America to Europe and South_America . With the Rover link dissolving , he said , Honda will not be building an assembly_plant in Europe . &quot; They will leverage what they have in North_America , &quot; he said . &quot; That means exporting to Europe and South America. &quot;</TEXT>
