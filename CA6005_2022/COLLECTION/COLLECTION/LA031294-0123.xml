Mann , a member of the Richmond Howitzers unit of the Ft.Tejon Historical Assn . in Castaic , said this weekend ' s war_games should be great entertainment for anyone attending . &quot; If the weather holds it should be perfect , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re usually cursed by geography with our brown hillsides , but I ' ve seen the field and it ' s a perfect green making it much more like the East where the battles were fought. &quot; Organizers of this weekends Civil War re-enactment are hoping a lot of people come_out and see the two days of battle play . Both days will begin with a flag-raising ceremony and a parade of players in their Union and Confederate uniforms . The major battles are scheduled for noon , 2 and 3 p.m. &quot; I was out here for their rehearsal about three weeks ago , and it ' s quite impressive . The ground shakes when those cannons_fire , &quot; said Dick Wixon of Gold_Coast Productions , which is organizing the event with the owners of Lake Casitas Park . During breaks_in the skirmishes , people can investigate both camps . Along with the guns from the Richmond Howitzers and authentic-looking muskets , visitors will be treated to cavalry charges by some of the riders at the event . &quot; Of course , this is good theater , &quot; Mann said . &quot; There ' s also a whole fantasy aspect to the whole event . You ' re out there playing army and it ' s a lot of fun. &quot; The event runs from 10 a.m. to sundown . Admission is $ 5 for adults , $ 3 for children and $ 4 for seniors . Children under 3 years are admitted free . SCOTT HADLY</TEXT>
