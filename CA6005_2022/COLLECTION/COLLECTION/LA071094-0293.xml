   <TEXT> About 300 people packed an auditorium Saturday at Santa Monica College in a show of support for a war-torn country thousands of miles away . The Rwandan benefit_concert , organized by a Rwandan student and members of Operation USA , a local relief organization , took_in about $ 2 # 500 from the $ 10 admission and additional donations . &quot; I ' m surprised . This is a very good turnout , &quot; said Richard Walden , president of Operation USA . The Santa Monica fund-raiser for Rwanda was the first held_in Los Angeles since the war began in April , Walden said . In the two months since reports that an estimated 200 # 000 to 500 # 000 people have been killed in the country , Walden said , donations for Rwanda have been few . &quot; We realized we had to do grass-roots organizing to raise money , &quot; he said . A group of dancers from Rwanda , Uganda and Malawi performed , as did the choir from Brookins A.M.E. Church in Los Angeles . Actors Mike Farrell and Danny Glover spoke about the urgency of the situation in Rwanda . &quot; We are all_in pain , and feel powerless in a sense , when assessing what is going_on in Rwanda , &quot; said Glover . He encouraged the audience to write letters to local congressional representatives , saying , &quot; We must let our voices be heard. &quot; The audience was visibly moved when dancer Laetitia Rwiyegura , who lives_in Long_Beach , spoke about her 17 family members who were murdered back home . &quot; I lost my younger brother , two sisters and their families , &quot; said Rwiyegura , 36 . &quot; The more I talk_about it , the more I want to cry. &quot; Sharon Ostreicher of Hollywood said that while she isn ' t an activist , she wanted to come_down and donate money . She said the program was educational , and she could relate to the suffering of the young_woman who spoke about losing her family . &quot; My father is a concentration_camp survivor , &quot; Ostreicher said . &quot; I could relate to what it means to be threatened with death because of the race and religion you belong to. &quot; Another descendant of Holocaust survivors , Esther Krisman of West Los Angeles , said she was bothered that more isn ' t being done to help the people in Rwanda . She added that she feels a sense of helplessness . &quot; I started crying when I heard that girl ( Rwiyegura ) speak , &quot; said Krisman . &quot; But I don ' t know what else can be done about this . There are so many similar tragedies going_on in Bosnia and Haiti . It ' s all so overwhelming. &quot;</TEXT>
