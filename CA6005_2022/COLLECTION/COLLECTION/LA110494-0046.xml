   <HEADLINE> U.S. SENATE ; HUFFINGTON USES DISPUTED STORY TO ATTACK FEINSTEIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new controversy over illegal immigration engulfed the U.S. Senate_race Thursday as GOP candidate Mike Huffington seized_on a disputed and unverified news_report claiming that Sen . Dianne Feinstein hired an illegal immigrant as a housekeeper in the early 1980s . By late Thursday the striking San Francisco newspaper reporters responsible_for the report said they were revising their story because they had received incomplete information from the Immigration and Naturalization Service . INS officials said they had no proof that Feinstein had employed an illegal immigrant and were rechecking their records . In a crowded news_conference in San Francisco , Feinstein told reporters that she employed a Guatemalan woman but that the woman provided documentation showing that she was in the country legally . Feinstein pointed_out that in any case , the woman worked for her years before a 1986 federal law made the employment of illegal immigrants a crime . Asked if she believes the woman was in the country illegally , Feinstein told reporters : &quot; No , and I don ' t believe she was. &quot; Throughout the day there was continuing uncertainty about the housekeeper ' s legal_status , with Feinstein saying she was legally in the country and Republican challenger Huffington insisting otherwise . The first report about the housekeeper was prepared Thursday morning by striking San Francisco newspaper reporters and sent_out over the Internet computer_system . But the reporters said they were revising their story to reflect that the INS had given them incorrect information . INS officials late Thursday said they were rechecking their records . Even as Huffington ' s top campaign officials acknowledged they had no proof the housekeeper was illegally in the country , the candidate accused Feinstein of deception and an attempted cover-up . His campaign said it was preparing television commercials to run today . &quot; She is a liar . And she is a hypocrite . And she has purposefully and blatantly attempted to mislead you and the people of California . She is unworthy to serve in the United States Senate , &quot; Huffington told reporters at a news_conference in Century City . The day ' s furor erupted exactly one week after the Santa Barbara congressman acknowledged that he and his wife had hired an illegal immigrant as a nanny for more_than four years , beginning in 1989 -- well after federal immigration law made such hiring a crime . The revelation convulsed Huffington ' s campaign and has dominated the race since . Feinstein on Thursday drove_home the distinctions between Huffington ' s action and her own . Most notably , she said , she hired the woman only after asking_for documentation and employed the woman years before the federal law was enacted . Unlike Huffington , Feinstein opposes Proposition 187 , the ballot measure that would deny health and education services to illegal immigrants . The political impact of Thursday ' s events was unclear . &quot; I think , from what I understand , it is does not appear to be the smoking gun . On the other hand , to the extent that Huffington can obfuscate the issue -- as he has done with some success in terms of wealth and campaign spending and residency -- it is . . . helpful &quot; to Huffington , said Arnold Steinberg , a GOP consultant not associated with the Senate_campaign . Republican consultant Edward J . Rollins , one of several top GOP advisers to Huffington ' s $ 27-million campaign , told reporters that television ads on Feinstein could be aired beginning today . Said one campaign official : &quot; We need a ( newspaper ) headline &quot; to run with the ad . Huffington ' s unverified accusations already took_away a day of campaigning for Feinstein , whose support from a variety of women ' s groups and abortion rights advocates was eclipsed by the questioning about her housekeeper . In a teleconference with reporters , Rollins and senior campaign strategist Ken Khachigian not only called Feinstein a hypocrite but suggested that federal agencies were attempting to protect her by withholding information . &quot; Worse than her lies , worse than her hypocrisy is the disturbing appearance that her campaign may have actively tried to mislead you and the voters by attempting to cover_up this story , &quot; said Khachigian . Federal_officials said there was no effort to keep information from the Huffington campaign . Late Thursday , Ron Rogers , an INS spokesman at the regional office in Laguna Niguel , said there was confusion over whether the woman in_question actually was here illegally . &quot; I can ' t confirm the status of the person in_question , &quot; said Rogers . &quot; What happened is that a similar name was given , and the INS ran a check on a person with a name similar in nature. &quot; Subsequently , Rogers said , the INS received a different name and was running that person through the agency data bank . He could not definitively say , however , that the latest name was the woman who worked for Feinstein , or what that person ' s status was . The Department_of_Labor ' s San Francisco office released an interim response that indicated they were making a good-faith attempt to the answer the Huffington campaign ' s request . Officials there also pointed_out the Huffington campaign ' s request for information was very broad , covering a 24-year period and every office of the Department_of_Labor across the country . &quot; The request was so broad that it was beyond the scope of this office to respond to , &quot; said Department_of_Labor spokesman Joe Kirkbride . Documents released by the agency indicated that from 1984 to the present , there was never an attempt by Feinstein , her husband , Richard Blum , or her daughter to certify any household employees who did not have legal_status to work in the U.S. All records prior to 1984 were destroyed , under a routine policy to discard older files . Earlier this year , documents also show , Blum ' s company , Richard C . Blum and Associates , began the process of getting a work_permit for a financial analyst -- a routine process for companies attempting to fill specific positions with non-U.S. workers . Documents do not indicate where that person lives . Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata said the Guatemalan woman worked for Feinstein from 1980 to 1982 as a housekeeper while Feinstein was mayor of San Francisco . At the time she was hired , the woman showed Feinstein documents making_it appear she was legally able to work , he said . Feinstein said she believed the woman had a proper work_permit and has not seen any evidence to the contrary . The former housekeeper also said she had legal permission to work_at the time , according to the San Francisco Free Press , a newspaper put_out by striking reporters from the San Francisco Chronicle and Examiner . The woman told the Free Press that she had a work visa from a prior job working for a Guatemalan official in Los Angeles . At the time of the hiring , it was not against the law for an employer to hire an undocumented worker . Although the law did not require it , Feinstein asked the woman to show her documentation of a work_permit and the woman complied , Kuwata said . Kuwata said Feinstein did not learn that her housekeeper had immigration problems until after the woman was no longer working for her . By 1983 , however , the mayor knew there was a problem because sometime between 1982 and 1983 , the housekeeper had returned to Guatemala and was unable to re-enter the United States . Feinstein and her husband arranged for the housekeeper ' s son , Josue , to come from Guatemala and live_in their household so he could continue his schooling . A 1984 profile of Feinstein in the San Francisco Examiner reported this : &quot; Without any publicity , the couple opened their home last year to 9-year-old Josue Paiz , the son of their former Guatemalan housekeeper , who was stuck_in her native country with immigration problems . Feinstein said they sent_for Josue so that he could continue in school . &quot; She loves him like her own , &quot; says daughter Kathy . He was supposed to join Feinstein at the beach but his mother , at last , returned to San Francisco . Kuwata said that before the woman went_back to Guatemala , Feinstein warned her she might have difficulty getting_back into the United States . While the former housekeeper was stuck_in Guatemala , Feinstein wrote a letter on her behalf to authorities , Kuwata said . He said he did not know what the letter said , or to whom the mayor sent it . &quot; She ( Feinstein ) did not learn of the immigration problems while she ( the housekeeper ) was employed , &quot; Kuwata said . &quot; While she was in her employ , she understood she was here legally and she could legally hire her. &quot; Kuwata said Feinstein paid all applicable taxes and Social_Security for the housekeeper . Kuwata sought to differentiate Feinstein ' s actions from Huffington ' s , noting that the law prohibiting the hiring of an illegal immigrant was not enacted until 1986 . &quot; Michael Huffington broke the law and Dianne Feinstein did not break the law , &quot; Kuwata said . &quot; What law did she break ? She wasn ' t required then even to ask_for the papers . &quot; The law was clear . He broke it . Dianne did not . He knowingly hired an illegal immigrant . Dianne never knowingly hired someone illegally. &quot; Also contributing to this report were Times staff writers Jim Rainey , Patrick J . McDonnell and Richard Paddock in San Francisco .</TEXT>
