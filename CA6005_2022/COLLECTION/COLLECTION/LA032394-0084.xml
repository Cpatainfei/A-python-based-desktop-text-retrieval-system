   <HEADLINE> ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH : EXECUTIVE TRAVEL ; SPOTLIGHT ON MALAYSIA ; MALAYSIA IS MODERN , USER-FRIENDLY ; ASIA : BUSINESS CUSTOMS IN THE PACIFIC RIM NATION ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With its modern highway_system , burgeoning industry and British-based system of laws , Malaysia is one Southeast Asian_country that offers few impediments to the business_traveler . &quot; Doing business there is very much similar to the United States , &quot; said Wan Hashim , vice consul of investments for the Malaysian Consulate in Los Angeles . Business is conducted from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Business lunches are as common as they are in the United States . And there are no special customs to observe , such_as bowing or gift giving . Keeping religious customs in mind , however , is vital . Islam is the state religion , and you shouldn ' t plan a business trip that coincides with Islamic holidays , because most business people will not be in their offices . Also , many Malaysians fast during daylight hours throughout March in observance of Ramadan , making midday business meals inappropriate for that period . Travel is also relatively safe in Malaysia . According to the U.S. State_Department , major crimes against tourists are uncommon . However , petty crimes , including pickpocketing and purse snatching , are common in tourist areas , and credit_card fraud rates are among the highest in the world . Foreigners traveling in Malaysia are subject_to the country ' s strict laws . For example , Malaysia has a mandatory death_penalty for convicted drug_traffickers . For more information on laws and traveling in Malaysia , you can contact the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur at ( 011-603 ) 248-9011 . Getting Around Malaysia is bordered by Thailand to the north and Singapore to the south . A modern highway runs the length of its western coast . The country ' s major airline , Malaysian Airlines , offers international and domestic_flights . Departures from Los Angeles to Kuala Lumpur , the capital , are scheduled every day except Wednesday and Friday . There are two flights on Thursday . If you are traveling in other parts of Southeast_Asia , the country is also accessible by train , bus or car from Thailand and Singapore . The road system is modern , and all major international car rental firms have offices in Malaysia . ( Although U.S. driver ' s licenses are acceptable , having an international license is advisable. ) Before taking the wheel , you should familiarize yourself with the road customs . For maps and information , visit the Tourist Development Corp . offices in major cities . The best way to get_around in large cities is by taxi . &quot; It ' s busy , congested and very hard to drive , &quot; said Hashim , the vice consul . Taxis are cheap and readily available . Most of the major business destinations are along the well-developed west coast . Major industrial destinations north of Kuala Lumpur include Ipoh , Alor Setar and Penang , each of which is about 45 minutes by air from Kuala Lumpur . Penang is the Malaysian equivalent of Silicon_Valley , and many electronics firms based in the San Jose area have plants or offices in Penang . Flights for Penang , Ipoh and Alor Setar leave Kuala Lumpur every hour or so . Major business destinations south of Kuala Lumpur include Malacca and Johor Baru . There are no flights to Malacca , but Johor Baru is about 45 minutes by air . The latter , across the border from Singapore and one of the country ' s most Westernized cities , is a frequent meeting_place for Singaporean business people because food and lodging are less expensive . Money You can exchange the Malaysian currency , the ringgit , at taxi and bus stands , airports , banks and hotels . The exchange_rate is set by the central_bank , and the best rate is usually available at banks . There is no currency black_market . Most large department_stores accept traveler ' s checks . Lodging Luxury business hotels in Kuala Lumpur include the Shangri La and the Regent Hilton . In Johor Baru , there is a Holiday Inn , and in Malacca , the Ramada Renaissance caters to business_travelers .

For more information on investing in Malaysia , the Malaysian government is sponsoring a one-day seminar on investment opportunities June 7 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose .
