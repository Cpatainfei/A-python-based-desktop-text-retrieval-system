   <HEADLINE> PROFILE ; COLOMBIAN TACKLES MALARIA AND SKEPTICS ; MAVERICK SCIENTIST HAS HAD TO CONVINCE CRITICS WORLDWIDE THAT HIS SYNTHETIC VACCINE CAN DETER THE DEADLY DISEASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a stately 19th-Century building of marble and gold trim , young Colombian scientists are splitting molecules , deciphering DNA and creating chemically synthesized proteins in a battle against one of the world ' s most deadly diseases : malaria . The wizard directing this project on the grounds of the San Juan de Dios Hospital is Dr. Manuel Elkin Patarroyo . The 46-year-old biochemist is developing a synthetic vaccine that for the first time could successfully slow the spread of the stubborn tropical disease , which kills about 3 million people each year . In tests on more_than 20 # 000 people in Africa , Thailand and Latin_America , the vaccine is showing promise and , after considerable skepticism , it is finally receiving international attention and some acceptance . &quot; These are no longer dreams , &quot; Patarroyo said . &quot; These are facts. &quot; Patarroyo is director of the Colombian National University ' s Immunology Institute , housed on the edge of the hospital compound . He is refurbishing several buildings to create a complex of laboratories where he hopes to produce the vaccine in bulk . A man of seemingly endless energy -- and confidence -- Patarroyo has become a celebrity in his homeland , a violent country known more for drug_traffickers and car_bombs . As the vaccine gradually passes scientific muster , Patarroyo is regularly solicited for international conferences and is racking_up awards the world over . For Patarroyo , there is a touch of national pride : This is the first vaccine created in a developing country without commercial funding , according to the United Nations ' Research and Training in Tropical Diseases program . Malaria is a treacherous , mosquito-borne disease that causes fevers and severe headaches and can recur numerous times . Tens of millions of people come_down with it every year . If final testing , under way now , proves successful , the vaccine could become available to the public in a_few years at an incredibly cheap price : Patarroyo estimates he can give a child the three-dose regimen for less than 50 cents . Because malaria is most prevalent and most deadly in the impoverished Third_World , the implications are far-reaching . Perhaps most remarkable , Patarroyo donated the vaccine patent to the World_Health_Organization for $ 1 , saying it was &quot; Colombia ' s gift to the world. &quot; Consequently , he will not profit from its production . Patarroyo ' s road to scientific acceptance has been a long one . Reared in a family of doctors and trained in chemistry at Yale and Rockefeller universities , Patarroyo says he always dreamed of serving his country in science or medicine . He saw his opening during a visit to Colombia ' s malaria-infested Pacific Coast , and from there he began studying the composition of the malaria_parasite , Plasmodium falciparum . Most conventional vaccines are produced from the germ that causes the disease . A weakened form of the germ is introduced into the body , triggering antibodies that fight the disease . Patarroyo identified proteins carried by the malaria_parasite . Then his real breakthrough came when he decided he could chemically synthesize those proteins en masse and produce the vaccine by attaching the proteins to a carrier molecule . &quot; Making a chemical vaccine has been considered a breakthrough , &quot; he said . &quot; You don ' t have to wait for it to be born in nature , biologically . You make_it chemically. &quot; But the unorthodox Patarroyo was seen in the scientific community as a maverick , and worse . At first , his work was dismissed . His field tests were seen as sloppy , he was producing the vaccine in his own laboratory and not under international standards , and he did not submit his data to the scrutiny of fellow investigators . His enthusiastic , showboat style turned_off a lot of scientists . He came under_attack for moving too quickly from experimenting with Amazonian monkeys to injecting humans -- Colombian soldiers . When the Centers_for_Disease_Control in Atlanta sought to reproduce his work in 1990 , they did not get the same results , compounding the doubts . Finally , Patarroyo made the push for international acceptance . He began to bring his work in_line with guidelines his colleagues could accept . He had the vaccine , which is named SPf66 , produced at a San Diego laboratory and then he conducted internationally supervised tests on 1 # 548 Pacific Coast Colombians . In March , 1993 , the international medical journal Lancet published the results . The trials showed a nearly 40 % reduction in the incidence of malaria among vaccinated subjects and a 77 % reduction in children younger than 4 , a particularly vulnerable group . In some parts of the world , up_to 25 % of children die from malaria . A 67 % reduction was reported in adults over 45 . Even though the 40 % rate was lower than what Patarroyo had earlier claimed , reaction was positive . The Pan-American Health Organization called the vaccine a &quot; potential , fantastic lifesaver. &quot; &quot; I think he ' s got a good vaccine , &quot; Dr. Trenton Ruebush , chief of the malaria section of the CDC ' s parasitic disease division , said in a telephone_interview . &quot; I don ' t think he has a great vaccine . It ' s certainly not as_good_as he wants to think . But he ' s gone a lot further than anyone else . He ' s clearly far ahead of the other groups &quot; developing vaccines . The once-skeptical WHO was impressed enough to contract with Patarroyo for more tests . Most of the research had been financed by the Colombian government . Patarroyo was determined to continue his efforts to perfect the vaccine . A central question remained about how effective the vaccine would be in areas like sub-Saharan Africa where malaria is endemic . Studies on 600 Tanzanian children are seen as a key test , and the United Kingdom ' s Medical Research Council , after first rejecting requests , has approved trials in Gambia . No one is suggesting that the vaccine will end malaria . The parasite is known for its adaptability and can evolve to become more resistant . But even if only half the likely victims of the disease can be protected , hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved annually . Patarroyo , a slightly built , gregarious man , relishes the attention his work is receiving . He has just won the Prince of Asturias award from Spain and the Medal of Edinburgh , and in October he will be presented with the Robert Koch Prize in Bonn , citing his &quot; pioneering work. &quot; To visitors , he distributes a page from Parasitology Today with a timeline of &quot; Milestones in Parasitology. &quot; It begins with Hippocrates and Aristotle in the 4th and 5th Centuries B.C. discovering worms and the seasonal nature of disease , and ends with last year ' s report of Patarroyo ' s first large-scale successful vaccine trials . As for those who doubted , and continue to doubt , Patarroyo says he does not begrudge them . &quot; It is difficult to understand an achievement like this in the middle of nowhere and , scientifically , Colombia is the middle of nowhere , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t blame them . &quot; The worst thing they said was that I was making_up lies . They said I was a charlatan . But I understand them and I have no negative feelings . Colombia has no history of scientific development . . . . &quot; Patarroyo ' s institute has the busy feel of a bus_station , his 60-plus white-coated researchers scurrying about with vials of cloned protein segments . Patarroyo is hiring 40 more researchers and beginning to turn the institute ' s attention to tuberculosis and other infectious_diseases that he is convinced can be fought with chemically synthesized vaccines . &quot; The concept is that every single vaccine can be made chemically , and with each batch you can vaccinate thousands and thousands of people , &quot; he said . &quot; That is the beauty of it. &quot; Biography Name : Manuel Elkin Patarroyo Title : Director of the Colombian National University ' s Immunology Institute .
