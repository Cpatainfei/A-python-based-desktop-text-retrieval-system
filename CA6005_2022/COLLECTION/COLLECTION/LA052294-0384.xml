   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / JONATHAN FREEDMAN ; A DEAL THAT EVEN A GNAT CAN APPLAUD ; DEVELOPERS , ENVIRONMENTALISTS HATCH A COMPROMISE FOR SAVING ENDANGERED SPECIES AND JOBS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal_court ' s decision to remove the California gnatcatcher from the endangered species list once again puts Southern California ' s fragile coastal sage habitat at risk . Developers are poised to unleash herds of bulldozers , the Feds to step_in with tougher regulation . Already , Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt is appealing the ruling . Hold_on a minute . . . . Southern California , reeling from natural disasters and record unemployment , can ill afford an eco-civil war that could make the Pacific Northwest ' s fight over the spotted owl look_like a schoolyard skirmish . There ' s a better way , now in the hatching stage in San Diego County . There , the Multiple-Habitat , Multiple-Species Conservation Program has joined landowners , environmentalists , builders and government_agencies in an effort to protect rare species and jobs . San Diego has the painful distinction of being home to 130 species , ranging from the celebrated California least tern to the modest thorn mint , that are candidates for the endangered list . that ' s more imperiled breeds than any other region in the lower 48 states . Meanwhile , development is stymied by recession , and the county ' s bruised economy has lost 60 # 000 jobs . Within this disaster zone , enemies have found common_ground in the struggle for survival . Initiated by the 1991 California Natural Community Conservation Planning Act , San Diego ' s three-year , $ 3-million program has identified 93 threatened species holding_on for survival in 565 # 917 acres of land patchworked across 12 jurisdictions . Its ambitious goal is to preserve tens of thousands of those acres and dozens of resident species . By defining permanent areas of protection and clear areas for development , it also seeks to restore and protect the economic vitality of the region , and to bring_back thousands of jobs . This is an evolutionary step_forward from the single-species preservation efforts -- and court battles . Success here could be a model for the whole country . The program ' s interlocking principles are simple : You can ' t protect a single species in isolation ; you also have to protect the web of animal and plant_life in which it lives . You can ' t save a natural habitat that crosses jurisdictional boundaries without bringing all government_agencies -- city , county , regional -- to the bargaining table . And to accomplish all this , you have to persuade avowed enemies that their survival depends_on one another . A working group of about 30 landowners , environmentalists , bureaucrats and politicians began meeting three years ago . That was before the gnatcatcher -- a small bird with a call like a mewing kitten -- was even on the endangered species list . The plan they came_up with is unique : Set_aside contiguous swaths of habitat in which many species will be protected , instead of trying to save every creature everywhere . This trade-off poses risks and sacrifices on all sides : Environmentalists must give_up the romance of waging a guerrilla war , species by species , habitat by habitat , until developers are pushed into the sea . Developers must give_up half of their land -- 35 # 000 acres of prime real_estate valued at $ 700 million . State and federal agencies must be willing to turn_over thousands of acres of parkland . Finally , local elected officials must find the courage to ask taxpayers for millions of dollars to acquire private lands for preservation . The scope of the proposal is immense . Between 85 # 000 and 167 # 000 acres of terrain would become a connected system of habitat preserves , from the Pacific to the edge of the Laguna Mountains . With so_much at stake , it ' s no surprise that the process often bogged down . But it was revived every time . When the gnatcatcher was abruptly &quot; delisted &quot; on May 2 , partisans on all sides held their breath wondering whether the fragile ecosystem of compromise could survive . So far , the consensus is holding together . &quot; Here ' s a sterling opportunity to show good_faith , &quot; says developer Jim Whalen of the Alliance for Habitat Conservation , a group of builders who collectively own 70 # 000 acres . In a letter to Babbitt , the alliance pleaded for restraint in defending the gnatcatcher , so that the multispecies conservation program can be completed . Environmentalists welcome the opportunity to move from planning to implementation . &quot; This is a watershed moment , &quot; says Michael Beck , San Diego director of the Endangered Habitats League . The multispecies , multihabitat approach is a practical , feasible alternative to waging case-by-case battles in court during which vulnerable creatures and jobs are lost . If developers , environmentalists and public agencies can build a habitat for compromise , there may still be a home for endangered species in Southern California .</TEXT>
