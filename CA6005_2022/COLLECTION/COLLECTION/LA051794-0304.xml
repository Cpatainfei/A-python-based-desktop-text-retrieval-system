   <HEADLINE> BRIT CRACKDOWN ON ' VIDEO NASTIES ' ; REGULATIONS TRY TO CURB FILMS DEEMED HARMFUL TO KIDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new film from the producers of the award-winning &quot; Leon the Pig Farmer &quot; appears to be the first casualty of the_British government ' s move to impose tougher censorship regulations on the nation ' s $ 1.75-billion video industry , the world ' s second-largest after the U.S. &quot; Beyond Bedlam , &quot; described by its makers as a &quot; tongue-in-cheek , action-horror film &quot; has been denied video certification , meaning it cannot be released on video in the U.K. &quot; The implications for the industry are horrendous , &quot; says &quot; Bedlam &quot; producer Paul Brooks . &quot; It ' s just insane. &quot; Reluctantly bending to public and political pressures , the government recently announced it will crack_down on so-called &quot; video nasties &quot; -- videos containing violence or other images that could be harmful to children . But vague wording of the proposed regulations have thrown the video industry into confusion . Meanwhile , a number of films , including the critically acclaimed &quot; Reservoir Dogs , &quot; are waiting in limbo while officials decide whether they are suitable for video release . The new regulations are considered unnecessary by many in Britain , which already has the strictest film and video censorship laws in the Western world . And videos undergo tougher censorship than films in the U.K. because they are considered more likely to be seen by children . A number of movies -- including &quot; The Exorcist &quot; -- have never been certified for video release in Britain . But despite their own public pronouncements that the existing regulations are strong enough , government officials are making them tougher anyway as an apparent matter of political expediency . &quot; Video nasties , &quot; as the_British call them , have remained a hot-button issue since last November ' s trial of two 11-year-old boys who kidnaped and murdered toddler James Bulger . At the end of the trial , the presiding judge wondered aloud whether watching violent videos may have prompted the boys ' actions . Although police and prosecutors stated that violent videos played no role in the case , the judge ' s comments unleashed a torrent of stories in the tabloid press calling_for stronger laws against violent and sexually explicit tapes . Liberal Democrat MP David Alton then proposed an amendment to a criminal justice bill , currently wending its way through Parliament , that sought to ban the sale or rental of all videos that &quot; present an inappropriate model for children or are likely to cause psychological harm to children. &quot; In other words , every film , no matter what its rating or intended audience , would have to be suitable for children to obtain certification for video release . &quot; We were absolutely appalled , &quot; says Lavinia Carey , director general of the_British Video Assn. , which represents distributors and rights-holders in the U.K. , including the Hollywood studios . &quot; It was a ludicrous piece of legislation . It would effectively mean the whole video industry would be destroyed. &quot; About 70 % of the videos rented in Britain are rated &quot; 15 &quot; ( meaning they should not be shown to anyone under age 15 ) or &quot; 18 &quot; ( not for view to those under 18 ) and most , if not all_of them , would be banned under Alton ' s proposal , she said . The rest of the videos rented in Britain are rated for view by all age_groups . Even the head of the_British Board of Film Classification -- the censorship office -- complained that the measure would outlaw award-winning films such_as &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; and &quot; Dances With Wolves. &quot; * The Conservative government opposed the idea , calling it unworkable and unenforceable . But when 80 Conservative MPs said they would support Alton ' s amendment , government_ministers quickly came_back with their own proposal . &quot; The government was going_to be defeated , so they panicked and reached a compromise , &quot; says Carey . Under the government ' s plan , retailers renting or selling videos rated &quot; 18 &quot; to minors will face_up to six months in jail , while those renting or selling videos that have not been given any classification -- and are therefore illegal -- will face_up to two years imprisonment . That seems clear enough . But what is causing confusion are the proposed new guidelines under which the censorship board is to classify and certify videos . &quot; What we ' re telling the BBFC , &quot; says a spokesman at the government Home_Office , which handles domestic affairs , &quot; is to consider the psychological effect of videos on children. &quot; Exactly what that means and how it will be interpreted is not clear . James Ferman , chairman of the_British Board of Film Classification , did not return calls from The Times seeking comment . Says Carey of the_British Video Assn. , &quot; We feel we ' ll survive this with no noticeable effect on the industry. &quot; But she predicts that more films will have to undergo censorships cuts , more will be given a higher rating classification than they would have previously and that a greater number of films will be denied video certification . Although the government ' s proposal is part of a larger criminal justice bill that is still under_consideration in Parliament , and therefore has not gone_into effect , the film censorship board may already be applying the new regulations preemptively . At least that ' s the feeling of &quot; Beyond Bedlam &quot; producer Brooks . He said he originally was told by the BBFC that his film was being granted certification . But after a tabloid newspaper ran an article citing three graphic scenes in his film -- which has just been released in British theaters -- the BBFC announced it was denying it a video certificate . The scenes cited by the tabloid involved a dream sequence of a young_man making_love with an elderly woman , a syringe injected into an open wound and a big fight at the end of the movie . Brooks says the film is a parody of American horror films and features &quot; comic-strip violence -- Tom_and_Jerry violence . The film is nowhere near a video nasty . It ' s a joke . &quot; The fact that we were passed uncut previously does suggest political and tabloid hysteria . It ' s repressive censorship if it continues. &quot;</TEXT>
