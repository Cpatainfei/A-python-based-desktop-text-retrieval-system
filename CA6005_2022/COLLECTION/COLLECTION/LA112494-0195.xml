   <HEADLINE> NATO HITS SERB MISSILE SITES ; SIEGE OF BIHAC GROWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Allied warplanes launched another series of bombing raids against Serbian-held positions near the Bosnian Muslim enclave of Bihac on Wednesday , but Serbian nationalist ground forces intensified their siege of the U.N. &quot; safe area , &quot; raising fears that it may fall soon . Warplanes of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization hit in three separate strikes , targeting two Serbian nationalist antiaircraft missile sites that had threatened allied fighter jets , as well as a Serbian air-defense battery that fired at British jets Tuesday . The Clinton_Administration continued to press U.S. allies to widen NATO ' s military involvement in an effort to prevent the fall of Bihac but again met resistance from France and Britain , which are fearful that their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina will come under_fire . Washington also is considering launching a major U.S.-led airdrop to deliver humanitarian relief supplies to the Bihac region . The area , which contains 170 # 000 people , has been denied support from U.N. aid convoys since last May . The developments came as Bosnian Serb forces set_up blockades at key points around the capital of Sarajevo , apparently in retaliation for NATO air strikes Monday , penning in U.N. peacekeeping forces stationed there . The flurry of activity left the situation much as it has been for days -- with a diplomatic stalemate in the face of increasing urgency on the military front -- as the Serbs press_on toward complete control of Bihac . Analysts said that the outcome could be important because Bosnian government officials have hinted that if Bihac falls to the Serbian nationalists , the Muslim-Croatian confederation will pull_out of the Western-led peace process . Some policy-makers also fear that a Serbian takeover of Bihac might prompt Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to launch a new war in Croatia , which borders_on the Bihac enclave and has a substantial Serbian nationalist population . It was not immediately clear how quickly the United States and its European allies might be able to reach any consensus on what to do about the deteriorating situation in Bihac . NATO ' s policy-setting North Atlantic Council met Wednesday but deferred action . Foreign ministers of the United States , Russia and the European allies plan to gather Dec . 2 for a meeting of the so-called Contact Group , which oversees negotiations for a Bosnian peace pact , but the outlook for the session is uncertain . U.S. officials have been pressing for NATO to declare the Bihac enclave a weapons-exclusion zone -- a move that would bar Serbian tanks , artillery and other heavy_weapons from the area and permit allied warplanes to attack them . Washington also has suggested launching direct air strikes against the Serbian nationalist forces -- both in Bosnia and in neighboring Croatia -- that currently are attacking Bihac . And it wants to allow NATO warplanes to pursue Serbian aircraft into Croatia to shoot them down . The Clinton_Administration ' s hope in pushing such proposals is to pose a big enough military threat to the nationalist Serbs to discourage them from completing their takeover of Bihac and possibly even push them into signing a peace accord with the Bosnian Muslims . But European governments fear that intensifying the fight against the Serbs will only provoke them into retaliating by attacking U.N. peacekeeping troops , particularly the_French , British and Dutch forces now stationed in the Sarajevo area . Clinton has been under growing pressure from Congress to lift the arms embargo against the Muslim-led Bosnian government . The lawmakers contend that the Muslims would then be able to force the Serbs to come_to some sort of terms . Under a congressional compromise , the Administration last week announced that U.S. forces would no longer help to enforce the U.N. embargo , setting_off a vigorous protest from European allies . European officials argue that the Serbs would retaliate by attacking the U.N. peacekeeping troops if the arms embargo were lifted , obliging the United States to send American troops to help evacuate the U.N. forces , which it has promised to do_in case of an emergency . Wednesday ' s air strikes were the second set of attacks by NATO warplanes against Serbian nationalist targets this week . On Monday , Western warplanes launched a limited attack on a Serbian nationalist air_base and on missile and antiaircraft artillery sites in south-central Croatia , destroying the air_defenses and making the runways and taxiways unusable . Wednesday ' s air assault was carried_out by more_than two_dozen American , British , French and Dutch planes against Serbian antiaircraft missile batteries at Otoka and Bosanska Krupa in northwestern Bosnia and Dvor in the Serbian-held Krajina area of Croatia . One of the Serbian missile sites had fired at British Harrier jets Tuesday . Others had &quot; illuminated &quot; NATO planes with radar -- an action that often signals that an antiaircraft missile is about to be fired . Allied planes also fired several air-to-ground_missiles to knock_out other radar sites in the area . Separately , Yasushi Akashi , who heads the U.N. Protection Force in the former Yugoslav federation , claimed to have negotiated a temporary cease-fire with Serbian nationalist leaders that would ease tensions in Bihac , but U.S. officials were skeptical . Analysts noted that previous deals have fallen_through soon after Akashi announced them . Times staff writer Carol J . Williams in Vienna contributed to this article . NATO Strikes NATO planes attacked three Serbian antiaircraft sites Wednesday , striking at one target twice to make_sure it ceased threatening allied aircraft . Source : Associated Press</TEXT>
