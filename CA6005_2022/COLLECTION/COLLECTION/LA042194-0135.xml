   <HEADLINE> THEATER REVIEW ; A SLICE OF SUBURBAN WARFARE ; DESPITE BUILT-IN SETBACKS , IRVINE COMMUNITY TROUPE CREATES TENSION IN A WORK ABOUT A WOULD-BE RAPE VICTIM IN A ' SAFE ' TOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s more_than a little eerie passing through the safe , quiet suburban streets of Irvine ' s Turtle Rock neighborhood and walking into the community recreation center to watch William Mastrosimone ' s play about a man trying to rape a woman who lives . . . on a suburban street . The unspoken message underlying the Irvine Community Theatre ' s production of &quot; Extremities &quot; is that it can happen here . To be sure , Mastrosimone ' s highly orchestrated and sometimes arch drama is also about how the woman , Marjorie ( Sydney Thorton-Smith ) , fights_back . But as when fire threatened Turtle Rock last autumn , fear is in the air in director Lenore Stjerne ' s pressurized staging . The pressure comes mostly from Stjerne ' s actors , who have more_than a_few strikes against them going_in . One is the theater ' s fairly ridiculous stage in the community hall , a shallow space fit for a band or lecturer , but not for an intense four-character drama . Further , the raised stage is so far from the non-raked audience seating that , without actors committed to putting the play across , no play has a chance in this hall . The program , with extreme understatement , refers to &quot; less than ideal conditions. &quot; The second strike against the actors , oddly enough , is Mastrosimone ' s play . On one hand , he ' s concocted a can ' t-miss situation . Marjorie , alone , finds Raul ( Michael Hebler ) in the home she shares with two female roommates . She foils his attempted rape , hogties him , and tortures him into such submission that her roommates actually begin to sympathize_with the guy . Alas , just as Mastrosimone can ' t hide the natural conflicts here , he also can ' t hide crude plot and character manipulations and a bewildering inability to maintain a tone . It ' s one thing for Chekhov to inject laughs into his play ' s tragically absurd incidents , but quite another for Mastrosimone to eke_out guffaws when the stench of rape and pain is thick on stage . Marjorie ' s roomies are stick figures and plot servants -- Terry ( Valerie Ludwig ) is all weakness and indecision , while Patricia ( Terra Shelman ) is official spokeswoman for the liberal , social-worker set . She ' s also the voice of law and reason compared to Marjorie ' s law-of-the-jungle revenge ethic . * But what kinds of friends are these ? Patricia , liberal feminist though she may be , comes very close to accusing Marjorie of asking_for_it by puttering_around the house in her nightie . At times like this , &quot; Extremities &quot; feels lost in an orgy of pseudo-dramatics . Lost , though , becomes found at Irvine . This is partly because Mastrosimone remains very clear about Marjorie ' s and Raul ' s characters . But it ' s largely because Thorton-Smith and Hebler are very serious about their assignments . Thorton-Smith never , ever , lapses into victim mode and suggests Marjorie ' s fear that she may be capable of matching Raul ' s ruthlessness . Hebler is a revelation , a trapeze-wire actor if there ever was one , forever daring to make Raul a smart , winning guy . Raul is always trying to spread charisma around the room . Hebler indicates that , given other conditions , his Raul might have his own talk_show , or even a play . Mastrosimone has described &quot; Extremities &quot; as &quot; revenge at its peak , &quot; but a performance like Hebler ' s considerably complicates the revenge factor . Even with this unsightly stage , the secondhand nature of the ( uncredited ) set and the play ' s forced ending , the victim-oppressor equation is something to mull_over as you walk_out into the suburban night . * &quot; Extremities , &quot; Irvine Community Theatre , Turtle Rock Community Park , 1 Sunnyhill , Irvine .
