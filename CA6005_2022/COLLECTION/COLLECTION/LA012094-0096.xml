   <HEADLINE> COMEDY : O ' BRIEN AND VALDEZ : FROM BREAKING GROUND TO BREAKING_UP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jim O ' Brien is a gregarious and brash Irish Catholic raised in Chicago . Alex Valdez is a blind , sharp-dressing Latino who grew_up in Santa Ana , where he still lives . Together , despite growing_up miles and worlds apart , the comedy team of O ' Brien and Valdez probably does more to break_down stereotypes than any stand-up act working today . So it comes as distressing news , just a week before the duo performs at Centerfield in Huntington Beach , that the team is going_to break_up . &quot; Come August of 1994 , we ' ll be taking a hiatus , &quot; Valdez said Tuesday night . &quot; It ' s time to explore other avenues in our careers . It ' s also time to get_off the road . I ' m gonna be 40 this year , and I don ' t want to be out on_the_road in small condos and hotel_rooms any more. &quot; The good news is , the split could be rescinded . &quot; It was a friendly breakup , &quot; explained Valdez , who wants to keep a hand in stand-up , expand into giving motivational seminars and look_into a possible TV role . &quot; We looked_at the pros and cons , and we both agreed it was time . that ' s not to say we ' ll never perform again . But we know we need to take a hiatus. &quot; Valdez said the seed was planted three years ago when he bucked the boozy trappings of life on_the_road and sobered_up . &quot; I ' m no longer the wild party animal I was . Do you know what I used to do ? I ' d get drunk and look_for someone who would let me drive their car . And there were a_few people who did. &quot; For O ' Brien , the hiatus will mean looking_at possible voice-over work with his impressions and sound_effects as well as continuing some stand-up , Valdez said , adding that his partner will also try TV and commercial areas . But until the break , the veteran performers will continue their tandem effort to break_down stereotypes and push for the disabled . The pair reject , however , any label of being crusaders . They just want the world to wake_up . They find it stunning that the disabled are still looked_at and treated differently . &quot; Even in the ' 90s , people are afraid to take chances with the disabled . . . unless they ' re sitting behind a piano , where they can ' t hurt themselves , &quot; Valdez , who has been blind since age 7 , once lamented to The Times after a show . &quot; We just want to be funny with a unique hook , &quot; O ' Brien added . And though some people might feel awkward laughing at a blind_person , Valdez addresses that concern from the stage . &quot; People ask me why I don ' t wear sunglasses or shades , &quot; he typically tells the crowd . &quot; I tell them I ' ve never seen a deaf_person wearing earmuffs. &quot; With that situation defused , the pair ' s funny , musical and intelligent routine continually pokes_fun at Valdez ' s blindness and Latino origins as well as O ' Brien ' s less-than-opulent roots , including a rousing &quot; White_Trash Blues , &quot; featuring Valdez on guitar and his partner on harmonica . O ' Brien , however , insists the song is not about his family , but the families he grew_up with . Part of O ' Brien ' s job is to make_sure Valdez doesn ' t fall_off the stage . Most of Valdez ' s job is to make_sure O ' Brien doesn ' t take_over the stage . After nearly 10 years together , they both do their jobs well . They perform Tuesday at 8 p.m. * If you missed one of the top comics working the stand-up circuit when he played Irvine in November , Dennis Wolfberg brings his bug-eyed humor back to the Irvine Improv tonight through Sunday . The veteran funnyman , who stretches and accents key_words as if someone ' s performing the Heimlich maneuver on him , just keeps rolling along as his fame grows , sort of . &quot; People recognize me on the street now , &quot; he said before the November shows . &quot; Not all_of them know my name , though . Some come_up and say , ' Aren ' t you the guy with the eyes ? ' . . . Like some comedians have O-C-U-L-A-R voids. &quot; But that slight annoyance aside , Wolfberg has it pretty good . He has regularly been selling_out clubs and has signed a deal with Castle Rock Entertainment to do a sitcom for the Fox Network . And if he does any more late nights with Arsenio Hall , the show could be renamed &quot; Arsenio and Dennis. &quot; The former teacher mines his humor from personal experiences , leaving the observational and topic areas to others . &quot; I ' m an old-fashioned storyteller ; it ' s personalized comedy . It behooves my audience for my life to be interesting. &quot; Elsewhere , John Bowman is headlining at the Brea Improv through Sunday , while Roger Rittenhouse is the closer at Standing Room Only in Fullerton through Sunday .</TEXT>
