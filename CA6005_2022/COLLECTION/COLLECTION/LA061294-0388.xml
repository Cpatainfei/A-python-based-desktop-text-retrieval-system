   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 ; WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / GROUP_A PREVIEW ; PLAYING IT FAST AND LOOSE ; COLOMBIA GOES AGAINST THE NORM WITH AN ATTACKING OFFENSE THAT MAKES IT ONE OF THE FAVORITES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; The best team from South_America is Colombia . There ' s no doubt about that . They have a chance to be in the final. &quot; The rose-colored view of a Colombian fan ? The bold prediction of a Colombian player ? The optimistic hope of a Colombian coach ? No . That glowing tribute to South_America ' s newest soccer power came from Pele . If anyone can recognize talent , Pele can . After all , he inspired Brazil to three World Cup triumphs . So when Pele says Colombia is good , it ' s good . The team created and crafted by Coach Francisco Maturana is almost everyone ' s favorite dark_horse to win the World Cup . If it does , it will be the first to break the monopoly of Brazil , Germany , Italy , Argentina , Uruguay and England , the only Cup winners . There is a worldwide feeling that it is time a new name was engraved on the trophy , and the field has two legitimate candidates -- the_Netherlands and Colombia . Strangely enough , Maturana has tried to downplay Colombia ' s chances . He has purposely diverted attention , indicating there are more important items on Colombia ' s agenda than simply success . He wants nothing less than to change Colombia ' s international image . &quot; All Colombian sportsmen , not just soccer players , have to try to show the world that our country is not all bad , &quot; Maturana said last year in reference_to Colombia ' s reputation as a haven for drug_traffickers . &quot; Of course we have problems , but there is a lot more_than just the negative side. &quot; More recently , as the players have started to believe the World Cup is not beyond their reach even though Colombia never has advanced beyond the second round , Maturana has simply smiled . &quot; There ' s no sin in dreaming , &quot; he said . Colombia ' s worldwide popularity is_due to its style of play . Not for Colombia , the dour , defend-at-all-costs strategy of some_other teams . Attack is the name of the game ; attack and entertain . &quot; We are going_to the World Cup to enjoy ourselves , &quot; Maturana said . &quot; If we win , that will be a bonus . I would rather we play well and make a good impression than win with the competition playing badly. &quot; Since finishing third in last summer ' s Copa America , or South_American Championship , in Ecuador , Colombia has been virtually unbeatable . Its biggest victory was the 5-0 rout of Argentina in Buenos Aires in World Cup qualifying play . That result rocked the soccer world and suddenly caused it to take_notice of the Colombians . Just as important and impressive , however , was an earlier 2-1 victory over Argentina in Baranquilla that snapped Argentina ' s 31-game unbeaten streak . Small wonder , then , that since arriving in the United States , Colombia has attracted record crowds -- 57 # 000 in Miami to see it defeat Italian and European champion AC Milan , 2-1 ; 21 # 153 at Foxboro Stadium to see it beat Northern_Ireland , 2-0 ; 73 # 511 at Giants Stadium to see it defeat Greece , 2-0 . Clearly , Colombia is the hot team of the moment , a fact not lost on its three first-round opponents : Romania , the United States and Switzerland . &quot; We try to be a balanced team , &quot; Maturana said . &quot; We view soccer not as offensive or defensive . We have to create when we have the ball and recover when we don ' t. &quot; It helps , of course , to have a nucleus of world-class players , as Maturana does , and reserves who would be starting on most national teams . Talent in_depth is one key to Colombia ' s success . The pivotal player is midfielder Carlos Valderrama , South_America ' s player of the year in 1987 and again in 1993 . With a startling mop of hair , an apparently easy-going attitude and skills polished to perfection , Valderrama is , in the words of U.S. assistant coach Sigi Schmid , &quot; worth the price_of_admission all by himself. &quot; The action flows all around Valderrama , who casually strolls the midfield distributing perfect passes or opening_up space for teammates such_as fellow midfielder Freddy Rincon to exploit . Much of the media attention around the Colombian team centers_on striker Faustino Asprilla , a brilliant forward nicknamed &quot; the Gazelle &quot; by Colombian fans . But Rincon scored five of Colombia ' s goals in qualifying play while Asprilla netted only a couple . Not that Colombia lacks for top-class forwards . In addition to Asprilla , who scored 10 goals this season for his Italian club , Parma , there is Adolfo ( Train ) Valencia , whose nickname says it all . He has power and speed and already has won one championship this year , helping Bayern Munich capture the Bundesliga title in Germany by scoring 11 goals . In addition , Victor_Hugo Aristizabal has proved his goal-scoring prowess during the run-in to the tournament , as has Ivan Valenciano . Other likely starters include defenders Luis Carlos Perea , who was impressive in the Copa America but was slowed by injury after that and is only now getting_back to top form , Andres Escobar , Wilson Perez and Luis Herrera . Colombia ' s most famous player from World Cup ' 90 , goalkeeper Rene Higuita , is not on the team . He fell afoul of the law in Colombia because of his involvement in helping negotiate the release of a kidnap victim for a fee and spent half a year in jail . He faces further charges and no longer is considered in the national-team picture . His replacement is Oscar Cordoba , a less adventurous , less spectacular but more reliable goalkeeper . He also has the confidence to predict that &quot; Colombia is going_to go_far in the World Cup. &quot; The one team likely to stand_in Colombia ' s way is Brazil , and already the psychological games have begun . &quot; Colombia ' s players like to show_off , but in a World Cup you have to play seriously , &quot; said Tele Santana , Brazil ' s former national-team coach . &quot; Colombia is a fine team and it has been playing together for a long_time , &quot; said Brazil ' s current coach , Carlos Alberto Parreira . &quot; But it is not used to playing under pressure and there will be a lot of pressure at the World Cup. &quot; Maturana , of course , has heard this all before , but he ' s still smiling . He knows his players . The pressure will be_on the other teams .</TEXT>
