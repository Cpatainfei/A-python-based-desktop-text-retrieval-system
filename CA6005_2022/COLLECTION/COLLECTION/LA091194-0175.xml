   <HEADLINE> WILLIAMSTOWN , MASSACHUSETTS ; ' A VILLAGE BEAUTIFUL ' ; that ' s WHAT LOCALS CALL THIS HISTORIC NEW ENGLAND TOWN , WHERE THE FALL LEAF SHOW WILL SOON BEGIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Come stomping into this town looking_for trouble , I dare you . The Berkshire hills will roll pleasantly beneath you , Mt . Greylock will rise gently on the horizon and the landscapewill enfold you in springtime greens , winter-white flocking or , now that fall approaches , a super-saturated leaf scene of reds and oranges . Steeples , porches , red bricks , Colonial columns and clapboard walls will arrange themselves around you . The streets will be neat , the lawns trimmed , the 90-odd buildings of Williams College handsomely historic . You can ' t even count_on the students for disorder . During my three-night visit to this northwestern corner of Massachusetts last spring , I hiked out_to the college ' s Cole Field and watched the graceful and fierce women of the Middlebury College lacrosse team destroy ateam of Williams women , 16-7 . After the clock ran_out , the vanquished Williams women lay_down their sticks , gathered_in a circle and raised their voices . Here it comes , I thought , a little enmity , a little nastiness , a little . . . &quot; Nice game , Middlebury ! &quot; they chanted . &quot; Good job , officials ! Good_luck , J.V. ! &quot; Good job , officials ! ? So goes life in Billsville , as its roughly 8 # 400 residents sometimes refer to it . The energy and menace of Manhattan lie just 155 miles to the south , and the traffic-packed side streets and dense neighborhoods of Boston boil about 140 miles to the east . Williamstown endures at a point three hours ' drive from each -- culture and nature its twin themes , its commercial core occupying a single city_block . To travelers from west of the Mississippi , Williamstown remains largely unknown , and is easily confused with Williamsburg , another town dating_back to Colonial days . ( For the record , Williams burg is a Virginia village near Washington , D.C. Williams town stands four states northeast of there , in the northwest corner of Massachusetts. ) To travelers from the east , Williamstown is a well-known retreat . Some roll in_for a_few days of fall foliage admiration -- a normally spectacular show that has the added advantage of being off more crowded leaf-peeper routes -- or for visits to the community ' s pair of top-flight art museums , or for summertime music at nearby Tanglewood . ( Though Tanglewood -- a 200-acre estate in Lenox -- is_best known as the summer home of the Boston Symphony_Orchestra and music_director Seiji Ozawa , its schedule this year in a new concert_hall included Frank Sinatra , Raffi , Wynton Marsalis and James Taylor. ) The main performing arts attraction in Williamstown proper is the Williamstown Theatre Festival , a 40-year-old series of summer productions headquartered behind the white columns and red brick walls of Williams College ' s Adams Memorial Theater . Since 1959 , when playwright Thornton Wilder played the stage_manager in a production here of_his_own &quot; Our Town , &quot; the festival has commanded great attention from New York theater folk and now draws about 50 # 000 playgoers each summer , about 90 % of them from New York , New Jersey , Massachusetts and Connecticut . The past summer ' s program of 10 productions at three sites included Julie Harris , James Whitmore ( who played the stage_manager in a revival of &quot; Our Town &quot; ) , Blythe Danner , Christopher Walken , Christopher Reeve , Paxton Whitehead , Stephanie Powers , Robert Wagner , Richard Benjamin , Stockard Channing , Julie Hagerty , Helen Hunt , Maureen O ' Sullivan and Richard Thomas . The season runs from late June to late August . Tickets usually go_on sale in early June , run $ 11- $ 30 for most shows and sell_out quickly . Workaday Williamstown is impressive too , largely for its lack of real-life drama . In the town ' s last annual report , which covered the year ended June 30 , 1992 , Williamstown ' s various local agencies logged just one case of vehicular homicide and 17 cases of assault_and_battery , against 39 # 388 library books circulated , 1 # 144 hunting and fishing permits issued , 30 reports of barking dogs , six stray cats and one raccoon tested for rabies . ( The paperwork came_back negative. ) With such high culture , low crime and splendid scenery around , Williamstown has grown a bit proud_of itself . Though Williamstown is essentially contiguous with the down-at-the-heels , blue-collar burg of North Adams , white-collar Williamstown people seem to view that town at the other end of Main_Street as merely a distant acquaintance . The official Williamstown motto , inscribed boldly on a white sign at the end of Spring Street , is &quot; the Village Beautiful. &quot; It ' s true , the village is beautiful ; even the Mobil station is a handsome brick building . But if all this civic_pride gets difficult to take , a cynical city visitor can find some comfort in local history : Williamstown owes its distinguished existence to an old soldier ' s well-founded pessimism , and if the world were only a slightly different place , city boosters today would be begging drama_critics to please come see the West Hoosuck Theatre Festival . In 1755 , a wealthy Yankee colonel named Ephraim Williams Jr. , doubtfully facing a campaign against French and Indian troops , was inspired to update his will . In the updated document , Williams earmarked funds for establishment of a town and a &quot; free school &quot; west of Fort Massachusetts , but only if those enterprises would bear his name . Sure enough , the colonel was killed in battle a month later . By 1791 , the township of Williamstown ( formerly known as West Hoosuck ) had been incorporated and the Williamstown Free School was newly established . Strangers may notice that the university cites 1793 , not 1791 , as its founding date . It was 1793 when Massachusetts judicial officials approved the conversion of the school into a college , thereby advancing the cause of higher education and laying the groundwork for the assessing of tuition fees . Thus private Williams College , former free school , is now able to charge its students 1994-95 tuition and room-and-board fees of $ 25 # 560 . But why dwell_on footnotes when so_much history stands here so tangibly ? In the center of town , most of the oldest buildings belong_to Williams College , which serves its 2 # 000 students on 450 acres . On Main_Street alone , the college offers_up the stolid gray tower of Thompson Memorial Chapel ( 1903 ) , the piercing white steeple of the First Congregational Church ( 1869 ) , the white columns of Chapin Hall ( 1912 ) and Adams Memorial Theater , and the red bricks and white clapboard of just about everything else . On the same street , the city ' s public_library sits in an 1815 building and , a_few blocks west of the main_drag , the city ' s first burial_ground occupies a hillside . Westlawn Cemetery , home to scores of 18th- and 19th-Century gravestones , sprawls above a broad view of the town and distant hills . The logical place to sleep_in such a town is someplace drenched in tradition , and there are many options . Beginning in the middle of town with the Colonial Williams Inn and radiating out into the_hills , there are more_than 30 hotels , motels , inns and bed and breakfastoperations in greater Williamstown , most of them assembled with traditional New England architectural sensibilities . At least three Victorian B &amp; Bs date to the 19th Century . I admired them all , and might well seek them out on another trip , but this time I stayed away . Instead , I lodged at Field Farm , a strikingly modern home on a 254-acre farm about six miles outside town . It ' s a fascinating structure , full of picture_windows , stark planes , rakish angles , blondish woods and modern art . Outside is a tennis_court on one side and a big pond on the other . With its metallic door handles and window_frames , the house seems very efficient , forward-thinking and respectful of nature , the kind of place Frank Lloyd Wright would put_up next to Walden Pond . In fact , the architect ' s name was Edward Gooddell , and the home ' s five bedrooms , each with private bath , are unusually expensive to heat . The home began in 1948 as a residence for millionaire , art collector , furniture maker and Williams College alumnus Lawrence H . Bloedel and his wife , Eleanor . But in 1984 , the Bloedels donated the home , its custom furniture and the surrounding acreage to the Trustees of Reservations , a Massachusetts nonprofit land-preservation group . Then it stood idle for a_few years , while hands were wrung . * Finally , local innkeepers Dave and Judy Loomis volunteered to take_over the building and operate it for the organization as a five-room guest house . The trustees said yes , and Field Farm has now been a guest house for seven years . Rooms run $ 90 nightly and breakfast is included . If you ' re willing to do without a phone in your room or free shampoo , it ' s a great opportunity to wake_up in a sort of hypothetical 21st-Century room and look_out_over an old New England landscape . During my visit in May , the cold wind rippled the pond , and every morning a grove of densely grown trees stood dew-soaked and surging with spring sap . In fall , the picture_windows frame vast expanses of leafy red , oranges and yellows . On my second morning at the farm , I got a specialist ' s perspective on the trees , the sap and the dew . Three other guests had come_to town from the Boston area for a wildflower walk , and one of them was Russell Cohen , a spectacled , bearded , pony-tailed lecturer on edible plants . He was a big fan of the flora around Williamstown , he said . Then he ticked_off a long list of flowers commonly found in the area , describing their looks and assessing their edibility . Some , he said , would be tasty on toast ; others were poisonous when eaten raw but harmless after a boiling or two . Since I wasn ' t confident in my ability to remember which was which , I refrained_from snacking during my hikes across farmlands and into the_hills . The view , the woodsy sounds and the clear air were enough . Besides , I had this further observation of Cohen ' s to comfort me : &quot; You know how all_of these wild meats , like rattlesnake , taste like chicken ? Well , wild plants tend to taste like spinach. &quot; Onward , then , to urban and indoor Williamstown . Spring Street , the town ' s principal shopping street , is lined with two-story buildings and handsome storefronts . There ' s a post_office , an antique store , a college casual-wear shop , a pizza place , Pappa Charlie ' s sandwich shop , a pottery shop , the Berkshire Hills Market , sporting goods and stationery stores , a coffeehouse . Set_back from the street , on Bank Street , is the Purple Pub , a student hangout . A block east on Water Street is Water Street Books , the best bookstore in town . Midway between Spring and Water streets stands the neo-Colonial Williams College Museum of Art , whose collection is strong on American art of this century . ( Admission is free. ) But the most prominent museum in town is the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute , a short drive from the campus and Spring Street area . The Clark , also free , was founded in 1955 , thanks largely to family funds that came from the Singer sewing machine fortune . The museum ' s collection , much of it acquired in the 1920s , ' 30s and ' 40s by Robert Sterling Clark for his own enjoyment , is dominated by French Impressionists , including more_than 30 Renoirs and some Degas , although works from Americans John Singer Sargent and Winslow Homer are_on hand as well . Among the campus buildings , one of the most popular_with visitors is the Chapin Library of Rare Books , where I found a white-haired man in conversation with a librarian amid marble flooring and elaborate wooden shelving . If I eavesdropped accurately , he was a 1933 Williams alumnus , contemplating a bequest and troubled by the fact that kids today don ' t seem to know who Paul Whiteman was . ( Paul Whiteman : New York-based band leader , jazz pioneer , commissioner of George Gershwin ' s &quot; Rhapsody in Blue , &quot; and donor of scores , recordings and other memorabilia to the Williams College library ' s special collections department. ) The Chapin Library ' s main attraction is its collection of Revolutionary-era documents , including a 1776 printed version of the Declaration_of_Independence , a 1777 copy of the Articles of Confederation and Union , a 1789 draft version of the Bill of Rights , George_Washington ' s copy of the Federalist Papers and , my favorite , a 1787 letter in which Virginia Constitutional Convention delegate George Mason complains vigorously about &quot; fatal &quot; flaws in the newly drafted U.S. Constitution . By Mason ' s reading , the Constitution gave too_little power to the president , created an unnecessary executive office ( the vice presidency ) , failed to preserve liberty of the press , gave too_much power to the Senate ( allowing senators &quot; to accomplish what usurpations they please upon the rights and liberty of the people &quot; ) and too_much power to the judiciary ( &quot; enabling the rich to oppress &amp; ruin the poor &quot; ) . A government based on such a document , Mason warned , could &quot; produce a monarchy , or a corrupt tyrannical aristocracy ; it will most probably vibrate some years between the two , and then terminate in the one or the other. &quot; Later the Bill of Rights came_along and dealt with some of Mason ' s complaints , but many of them have gone unanswered . In fact , the best measure of Williamstown ' s pleasant and becalming nature may be this : Even with all that goes_on these days in the world beyond Williamstown ' s boundaries , it is possible to step_out of the Chapin Library into a sunny day , look_out at this orderly land of trees and hillocks and steeples and well-scrubbed undergraduates , and decide that George Mason was probably wrong .
