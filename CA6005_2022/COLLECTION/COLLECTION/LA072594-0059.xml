   <TEXT> Crime ' s pressure is mounting for office workers and juveniles , according to two studies released by the Justice_Department on Sunday . A study by the department ' s Bureau of Justice Statistics , found that one of every six violent crimes occurs at_work , affecting nearly 1 million victims nationwide each year . It said 16 % of all assaults , 8 % of all rapes and 7 % of all robberies take_place at_work . The department also reported that the number of juvenile_court cases involving serious offenses such_as murders and aggravated assaults grew 68 % from 1988 to 1992 . Of the 118 # 700 serious crimes committed by youngsters , aggravated assault cases increased the most , up 80 % , or 77 # 900 cases in 1992 , the study showed . &quot; The workplace is the scene of almost 1 million violent crimes every year , &quot; said Lawrence A . Greenfeld , acting director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics . &quot; About 10 % -- or 100 # 000 -- of these violent workplace crimes involve offenders armed with handguns. &quot; The survey does not include information on homicides . But data from other sources indicate that 4 % of all homicides also occur in the workplace . Jack Levin , Northeastern University professor of sociology and criminology , said some data show the number of bosses killed at_work has doubled_over the past 10 years , with three to four a month slain by a disgruntled worker or ex-worker . More_than half of the crimes at_work were not reported to the police , the agency said . Of those not reporting the crimes , 40 % said they believed the_matter was minor or too personal while 27 % said they disclosed the incident to another official , such_as a company security_guard . In the study on juvenile_courts , cases increased by 26 % , to nearly 1.5 million , according to the study by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention . Homicides increased by 55 % , to 2 # 500 ; robberies went_up by 52 % , to 32 # 900 ; and forcible rape cases rose by 27 % , to 5 # 400 . &quot; Criminals are getting younger , victims are getting younger , &quot; said Wesley Skogan , a political_science and urban affairs professor at Northwestern University . &quot; It ' s a combination of bravado , hopelessness , access to firepower and the allures of the drug market. &quot; Part of the overall increase in juvenile_court cases , Skogan said , comes from an increasing willingness to prosecute young people . The report also found an increased willingness to transfer cases from juvenile_court to adult criminal_court , based usually on the seriousness of the offense , the juvenile ' s record and the juvenile ' s amenability to treatment . Atty . Gen . Janet Reno said the statistics on escalating youth crime and significant crime at_work show the need for Congress to adopt anti-crime legislation as quickly as possible .</TEXT>
