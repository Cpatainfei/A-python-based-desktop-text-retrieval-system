   <HEADLINE> IRISH PREMIER IGNITES NEW CONTROVERSY ON N . IRELAND ; BRITAIN : REYNOLDS ' CALL FOR ' DEMILITARIZATION ' PROMPTS CHARGES THAT HE SUPPORTS CONCESSIONS TO SEPARATISTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The confusion over British-Irish government attempts to set_up peace talks to end violence in Northern_Ireland deepened Monday when Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds called_for &quot; demilitarization &quot; of the troubled province . Reynolds ' remark sparked a new controversy when it was interpreted by Ulster Unionists , who want to maintain British rule_in Northern_Ireland , as a hint of possible concessions to separatists who want to join Ireland . On Dec . 15 , Reynolds and British Prime_Minister John Major issued a framework for peace negotiations , called the Downing Street Declaration , that would include supporters of the outlawed Irish_Republican_Army if the group would lay_down its weapons . &quot; The time has come_to start a process of demilitarization of the Northern conflict , &quot; Reynolds said in a statement published in a Dublin newspaper . The statement came_after Major said that neither he nor the_Irish prime_minister would discuss the declaration further until they received an official response from Sinn Fein , the political arm of the IRA . John Bruton , leader of the opposition in Ireland ' s Parliament , complained that Reynolds should have chosen his words more carefully . &quot; Anything that is said that is not immediately clear as_to what it means is something that should not be said in a situation as delicate and difficult as this , &quot; he said . &quot; Unfortunately , the ( prime_minister ) had used a phrase which could have a double meaning -- and that is not a very wise thing for him to have done. &quot; The Rev . Ian Paisley , militant leader of the Democratic Unionist Party , said Reynolds ' comments showed that he had &quot; come_out in his true colors , &quot; adding that the peace plan had_on it &quot; the bloody thumbprint of the IRA. &quot; In the past Sinn Fein has called_for &quot; demilitarization &quot; of the province , signifying a British withdrawal . And David Trimble , an Ulster Unionist member_of_Parliament , warned that Reynolds was &quot; trying to pull the declaration closer to the IRA position . He signed the declaration and he is going beyond it . I hope Downing Street will proceed to rein him in as he goes_off on a bit of frolic on his own. &quot; But a parliamentary supporter of the_Irish government , Dermot Ahern , tried to explain Reynolds ' remarks by indicating that the prime_minister was trying to get a message through to the IRA . &quot; I think Mr. Reynolds was trying to suggest yet again , &quot; he said , &quot; that if we had a peaceful atmosphere , if there was a lack of military presence -- both from a paramilitary point_of_view and indeed , consequently , a British security point_of_view -- things would be a lot easier for people on the island to sit together and attempt to sort_out our differences. &quot; Ahern said the first_step would be for the Catholic republican and Protestant Unionist paramilitary forces to put_down their arms . &quot; Obviously , if that was the case , and if the security_forces and the_British government were aware of the fact this had taken_place , then it would be possible for them , in_effect , to go_back to their barracks. &quot; Meanwhile , Martin McGuinness , a leading Sinn Fein figure , demanded clarification of the Downing Street Declaration and asked whether &quot; this signaled the beginning of the process of bringing_about an end to British rule_in Ireland. &quot;</TEXT>
