   <TEXT> 65 YEARS OF THE OSCAR : The Official History of the Academy Awards by Robert Osborne ( Abbeville Press : $ 59.95 ; 352 pp. ) . No sooner does a film reference_book establish itself as essential than , more often than not , it either becomes outdated or goes_out of print.So it is a special pleasure to welcome the up-to-the-minute third edition of this handsome volume by Hollywood Reporter columnist Osborne . Not only does_it list every nominee and winner from 1927 through last year ( all included as well in a massive 27-page , 7 # 000 item index ) , it is unique among inclusive Oscar reference_books by virtue of the number and quality of its hundreds of illustrations , including reproductions of the poster for each year ' s Best Picture winner . Turning these pages is easier than fighting the traffic to Monday night ' s awards ceremony , and even more rewarding . Kenneth Turan</TEXT>
