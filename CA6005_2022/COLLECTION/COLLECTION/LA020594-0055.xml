   <TEXT> At high_noon on a hazy day last fall , Sheriff ' s Department Detective Larry Thompson pulled his unmarked car onto a freeway on-ramp in Long_Beach and ran_into a cop ' s bad dream . Just ahead of him , a big-rig truck was stopped . As Thompson started to pass , a man with a semiautomatic_pistol sprang from behind the truck ' s fender , bolted to the cab and aimed the pistol at the driver ' s head . &quot; Do I stop , jump_out of the car and draw down on the guy ? Or run him down ? &quot; Thompson thought . Deciding to play it smart , he radioed for help . By then the gunman and an accomplice had forced their way into the cab , and the big-rig was heading into traffic . As the deputy followed , broadcasting his location , a pickup with three accomplices pulled alongside . &quot; They probably thought I was some John_Doe citizen calling the police and they tried to run me off the freeway , &quot; said Thompson , who was running an errand when he happened_upon the brazen hijacking . Finally , Thompson and the backup deputies managed to corner the truck at an off-ramp and arrest the hijackers , who later confessed that they had planned to park the rig somewhere and peddle its contents -- $ 116 # 000 worth of camcorders and compact_disc players . Although the scene resembled something out of a movie , it was cold reality . And , ironically , no one knew that better than Thompson and the deputies who joined the chase : They are members of a specialized , multi-agency team created to crack_down on truck hijackings , a crime that has reached epidemic proportions in Southern California . &quot; This is really the cargo theft capital of the world , &quot; said Sheriff ' s Sgt . Dewayne Shackelford , one of a dozen members of the Cargo Criminal Apprehension Team . &quot; There are so many , we can ' t keep track . There are weekends when we come_back to work ( and ) get reports that we have had 20 trailers stolen. &quot; Members of the so-called Cargo CATs estimate that thieves in Southern California are raking_in more_than $ 1 million in merchandise every night -- half a_billion dollars annually -- by commandeering trucks at gunpoint , by stealing them off streets and from storage yards and by bribing truckers to give_up their loads . Police say that cargo thefts are becoming increasingly violent , leading to the death of at least two people last year . In October , a truck_driver was shot to death during an attempted hijacking at a freeway on-ramp in Carson . A month earlier , a security_guard was shot in the head , execution-style , during the robbery of a La Mirada storage yard from which two truckloads of clothing and other merchandise were taken . There have been numerous abductions and at least one rape connected with cargo thefts . The reason that the Los Angeles area has become a hijacker ' s paradise , authorities say , is simple : The pickings are plentiful . More freight moves through the Los Angeles and Long_Beach harbors than anywhere in the nation , an estimated $ 83 billion worth each year . What ' s more , a conviction for stealing a load of televisions from a storage yard may_not bring a stiffer penalty than stealing a single TV from a store . Most of the thieves do not seem to be overly discriminating , ripping_off a mind-numbing variety of goods , including computers , frozen pastries , motorcycles , hay , fax machines , dog_food , light_bulbs , prune juice , in-line skates , frozen shrimp , hair_spray and anything else that can be moved_on the street or sold in volume at cut-rate prices to independent stores . But then there are choosy hijackers such_as Jiles Byron Gray , who owned two Mercedeses , three new vans and a $ 500 # 000 house in the_hills above Pomona before he was arrested by the special team and sentenced to 21 years in federal prison in 1992 . Gray and his gang would don ski_masks , tie_up security_guards at truck storage yards , cut the locks off big-rig trailers with bolt_cutters and place a sample of merchandise behind each one . Gray would make his selections , and the thieves would steal the trucks , leaving the rest of the big-rigs behind with the samples on the ground . Because of the growing severity of the problem , the Legislature passed a bill , which took_effect last month , authorizing the California Public_Utilities Commission to pay $ 3 million a year for cargo security and truck_driver safety programs . In addition , because of the regional nature of the crime , Cargo CATs was formed , combining officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department , the Los Angeles and Vernon police_departments , California Highway Patrol , Los Angeles Port Police and the FBI . Created in 1990 , the team made 367 arrests and recovered nearly $ 52 million in stolen property during its first two years . More recently , the team was instrumental in the indictments of 31 people and the recovery of nearly $ 14 million in stolen goods in a sting operation that lasted for more_than a year . The team ' s efforts are directed not only at the thieves -- who steal trucks at gunpoint or plunder them in storage yards -- but also the so-called brokers . Like drug kingpins , the brokers keep themselves isolated and above the fray , setting_up deals to store and sell stolen goods to independent retailers or ship them to Mexico . A couple of years ago , Cargo CATs set its sights on a veteran broker named Jose Oliberio Garcia , 37 . Like most brokers , Oliberio let flunkies do the stealing . He frequently provided warehouse space for cargo thieves and , if they were unable to find a buyer for their loot and pay a storage fee during a specified period , he would take possession of the goods , according to police . Operating in much the same way as undercover narcotics officers , members of the team used one informant to introduce Oliberio to a second informant , who posed as the owner of a warehouse in Carson . Using hidden audio devices and cameras , the team recorded hours of conversations between the warehouse &quot; owner &quot; and Oliberio , who agreed to rent the building for $ 2 # 000 a week per truckload of stored merchandise . During the tape-recorded conversations , the savvy Oliberio avoided using such incriminating words as &quot; stolen goods. &quot; What unfolded next was testimony to the magnitude of the cargo theft problem . The Carson warehouse that Oliberio rented from the undercover operatives started filling_up , beginning with toilet_paper , clothing , food and Christmas ornaments . As more stolen goods arrived , the hijackers began quarreling among themselves . &quot; There ' s a lot of thievery between thieves , &quot; sheriff ' s Detective John Langley said . &quot; They were taking each other ' s samples and running_off to find buyers. &quot; Before long , the warehouse was out of control . &quot; They were trying to bring_in more stuff , &quot; Langley said . &quot; We couldn ' t handle it . We were_on overload. &quot; Obtaining the incriminating information they needed , the officers arrested Oliberio , who pleaded guilty to grand theft and receiving stolen property . He was sentenced to three years in state_prison . Many brokers , however , treat prison time not as a deterrent but as a price of doing business . Pokey Eddie White , for one , has been in and out of custody for 25 years , several times for receiving stolen property . Police describe White , 44 , as one of the biggest brokers in Southern California and allege that he uses members of the Crips gang to pull jobs for his well-organized theft ring . Here is an example of how he and his cohorts did business . Early on Aug . 20 , 1992 , two long-distance truckers backed a $ 250 # 000 load of CDs up_to the platform of a Chatsworth warehouse . The exhausted truckers settled_down in the cab to sleep , but about 5:30 a.m. , two gunmen rousted them , locked them in a trailer and drove_away with their rig . What the thieves did not know was that the truck had been equipped by the freight company with a &quot; satellite responder , &quot; enabling authorities to track its general location . Later that morning , LAPD investigators using a helicopter saw the truck in a warehouse storage yard at 87th Place and Mettler Street in Los Angeles . Police found the load of stolen CDs stacked in the warehouse . The owner of the building told officers that White had rented the warehouse . The two long-distance truckers identified Gary Villand Harris as one of the men who robbed them . White , Harris and a third man , Willie Lee Beamon , were charged with receiving stolen property . Harris also was charged with armed robbery . But White was soon out on $ 20 # 000 bail . Three months later , two cargo thefts occurred in the South Bay -- a trailer load of computers was taken from the Unisys Corp . storage yard in Compton and a truckload of Sony compact_disc players was hijacked at gunpoint in Carson . Augustin Enriquez was hauling the load of CD_players . It is a night he will never forget . After leaving the Sony warehouse , he pulled to a stop at a traffic_light at an on-ramp of the San Diego Freeway . &quot; that ' s normally the place to get hijacked if you ' re pulling a Sony load , &quot; Thompson said . &quot; We have frequent thefts there. &quot; As Enriquez waited for the light to change , the door to his cab flew_open and a man in a black ski_mask shoved a gun in his face . &quot; Roll_over , &quot; the gunman said as another hijacker climbed in the passenger door . * The hijackers threatened to kill the terrified trucker if he did not tell them what he was hauling . &quot; I told them I didn ' t know , &quot; Enriquez said . &quot; I was sweating and my heart was beating so fast I thought it was going_to fly out of my chest. &quot; Finally , the gunmen pulled a ski_cap over Enriquez ' s eyes , drove the truck to Santa Fe Street in Carson , dumped him out and drove_off with the CD_players . A month or so after the Thanksgiving weekend thefts , computer_dealer William Narkunas was asked by a stranger if he wanted to buy several hundred Unisys computer monitors . The price was reasonable enough , but Narkunas got suspicious when the seller insisted on being paid in cash . &quot; The alarm went_off when he said he wanted to be paid in dead Presidents , &quot; said Narkunas , who called the sheriff ' s office . &quot; Five minutes later I got a call from Cargo CATs . They asked me if I would participate and we set_up a buy for cash. &quot; Within days , a jittery Narkunas was standing in the rain , waiting to meet the thieves in a parking_lot in an unfamiliar neighborhood of Los Angeles . He had $ 30 # 000 in cash provided by police stuffed in his pockets and second_thoughts running_through his head . An undercover CHP officer was with Narkunas and had brought along a truck for the thieves to use . Finally , two strangers showed_up and took the truck . The deal was that the thieves would return it with computer monitors and collect the $ 30 # 000 . The team followed the suspects to a cellular_phone business in Los Angeles . At an apartment_house garage in Norwalk , they began loading the truck with Unisys monitors . The team swooped in and put three men under arrest . A search_warrant was issued for the cellular_phone business , which turned_out to be operated by none other_than White , who was out on bail . Inside , officers discovered 171 computer monitors stolen from the Unisys yard and nine Sony CD_players taken from Enriquez ' s truck . White insisted that the merchandise had been left at his business by a son who went_to the East Coast , and a Superior_Court judge dismissed the charges of receiving stolen property , infuriating the team . &quot; He takes the word of a crook , &quot; Thompson said of the judge , &quot; instead of letting us testify. &quot; But White did not escape prison . He was convicted in September of receiving stolen property in connection with the load of CDs hijacked from truckers in Chatsworth . White was sentenced to four years in prison . With good behavior , he will be out_in two .</TEXT>
