   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; NOT JUST AN EXERCISE IN FUTILITY ; PUBLIC ART IS ALMOST ALWAYS CONTROVERSIAL , BUT SOMETIMES IT ' S EVEN POPULAR . AS IT BECOMES MORE COMMONPLACE , ISN ' T IT WORTH CONSIDERING A FEW PIECES THAT REALLY WORK ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The &quot; Great Wall of L.A. , &quot; unfurling for nearly half a mile along an unlovely concrete flood channel that slices_through Van Nuys and North Hollywood , must surely rank among the largest paintings anywhere in the United States . The mural , a loosely linked sequence of 41 scenes painted intermittently between 1976 and 1983 , tells an almost cinematic history of California from the prehistoric era to the present day . Aside from the oddity of its mammoth size , the mural also ranks as a significant and compelling work of public art -- a standing that is no small achievement in that typically beleaguered realm . Notable successes in the public-art genre are less than abundant , even though the field is increasing in visibility throughout Los Angeles . What is it that makes some public art echo and resound in the imagination , while most of it just sort of sits there , looking variously pompous or forlorn , annoying or indifferent , in the way or out_of_place ? Why do some works_of_art seem born to vividly inhabit the public realm , rather than to require the more enclosed world of the gallery and museum ? The question is worth considering , in part because public art is becoming commonplace in L.A. and in part because the genre is itself of great significance . Art is necessary to a civilized world . Throughout history , governments of all kinds have been principal patrons for art ; in_order to achieve a civilized democracy , public patronage needs to generate art in the public realm . The proliferation of public art locally is a result of the cumulative effects of federal , state and city laws , which began with the National Endowment for the Arts ' Art in Public Places program of the late 1960s . Today , more_than half the states and dozens of cities mandate percent-for-art commitments from a mix of public and private developers . Santa Monica , Culver City and Los Angeles are among local_governments that require a portion of redevelopment or city construction funds to be devoted to the commissioning or acquisition of public works_of_art . A big boost has come from Metro Rail , with its highly visible $ 10-million Art for Rail Transit project , which has involved artists in subway_station design . In addition to government , a_few private local entities also have become involved . Foundations and independent real-estate developers commission art intended not for private consumption but for the public realm . Controversies certainly aren ' t alien to the subject . Sometimes a specific work causes a flap , as happened in 1991 when a congressman and a federal judge objected to a new sculptural ensemble by Tom Otterness at the Roybal Federal Building downtown . ( Their objections did not prevail. ) Other times , as in a recent storm in Culver City over whether or not the quality of newly built architecture could legitimately satisfy a percent-for-art requirement , it is the larger philosophy of public art that takes the heat . ( That stew still simmers. ) Producing public art is becoming so familiar an activity in Los Angeles , while issues surrounding the topic remain not unexpectedly blurred , that a four-day conference , including two days of panel_discussions Friday and Saturday at the Biltmore Hotel , was hatched to explore its many facets . &quot; Public Art : Realities , Theories and Issues , &quot; with backing from the California Arts Council , the Community Redevelopment Agency and the city ' s Cultural Affairs Department , will attempt to address the subject from as_many angles as possible . There is , of course , no single magic-bullet answer to the question of why some public art works and most doesn ' t . The &quot; Great Wall of L.A. &quot; was collectively produced by scores of muralists drawn from various communities -- a sampling of the public , you could say , engaged in making public art -- but other , similarly conceived and executed murals don ' t come_close to exerting the imaginative pull of the &quot; Great Wall. &quot; Systematic formulas just don ' t work for art -- which is not to say they don ' t get tried . For instance , a ruling convention of public art today is that a thorough understanding of the public site in which the work will exist is crucial to the art ' s success . So some artists try to comprehend a site by becoming researchers -- an amateur historian , sociologist , demographer , anthropologist . The art they produce illustrates what has been discovered during the investigation . Some of the dullest , most tediously academic public art gets made that way . Still , not only does the method flourish , it ' s even taught in art_schools . One reason it thrives is that it makes_for an art that ' s easy to explain . And public art , unlike art made in the privacy of the studio , usually needs explaining -- lots of it , even before it ever gets made . The plan needs to be explained to patrons and committees of bureaucrats and review boards and politicians and funding agencies -- any or all_of whom may regard modern art with suspicion . The show-and-tell school eases doubts by giving everyone a comfortable little story to embrace . Conventional wisdom also has it that abstract_art is_best avoided in public places , since abstraction is supposedly incompatible with the interests of a wider public . If that ' s true , why is it that Maya Lin ' s breathtaking Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington , the single greatest -- and most widely beloved -- work of contemporary public art in the United States , is an abstract sculpture ? * Neither a brilliant artistic form , by itself , nor a rich public site , by itself , is enough to galvanize a work of public art . Necessary instead is a sparkling dialogue between them . And the dialogue , as with any public conversation , won ' t be worth much unless there are plenty of openings for an eavesdropping public to pipe_in . Sculptor Siah Armajani , who has designed several successful works of public art around the country , once explained the crucial importance of coaxing forth the hidden parameters of context when making public art . It demands something other_than the inert illustrated research so prominent today . &quot; In public art , &quot; Armajani told interviewer Calvin Tomkins in 1990 , &quot; there is no room for focus_on the ego . You have to get lost in the context of the work. &quot; Conventional wisdom has long held that the free reign of artistic ego can wreak havoc with art destined for the public realm . Conventional wisdom has been right . Yet it hasn ' t gone the full distance . Notice that Armajani did not specify whose intrusive ego could pose problems . Nor did he limit the identity of who it is that finally needs to be released , able &quot; to get lost in the context of the work. &quot; The often disregarded fact is this : It isn ' t only the artist ' s ego that must be consciously set_aside for successful public art , because there are two sides in the public art equation . The bumptious ego of the patron can inflict just as much havoc as the intrusive ego of the artist . When the public or its representatives -- the patrons for public art -- demand that its prideful vision of itself be put_on perpetual display , there is no more room for viewers &quot; to get lost in the context &quot; than there is when an artist ' s bloated sense of self is grandly filling_up the space . For evidence , look_around town . Although the numbers are modest -- Los Angeles has lagged somewhat behind cities such_as New York , Chicago and even Seattle in generating public art -- some exceptional work has indeed been completed here in the last 10 or 12 years . Its variety offers a sense of the scope to which the genre aspires , as well as the range of commissioning mechanisms through which it comes_into being . What follows is a selection , by no means comprehensive , of five well-known works of public art . The list was assembled to reflect a variety of types of projects , commissioned in a variety of ways . Two were made by a relatively new class of American painters and sculptors who regard themselves specifically as public artists ; three were not . If this diverse group can be said to have anything in common , it is not just the creation of an interesting object , image or place to be looked_at or used -- although of course they have all done that . Critical to their success is the uncanny power those objects and places have to galvanize the environment where they appear . For public art , context is crucial . ' Great Wall of L.A. ' Judy Baca and the Mural Makers A n African aphorism asserts that it ' s the lions who get_to tell the story of the lambs . In the &quot; Great Wall of L.A. , &quot; the lambs assertively take their place at the podium . The painting , formally titled the &quot; Tujunga Wash Mural : History of California , &quot; begins with a bit of dinosaur-studded prehistory , quickly jumps ahead to the early migration of settlers from Asia in the first millennium and then gets right to its main purpose : telling episodic stories of the struggles between repression and liberation for ethnic minorities , women , Jews , gay_men and lesbians , Dust_Bowl refugees , labor organizers , political_dissidents and more . Other events do get chronicled along the way , such_as the development of the movie_industry and the mobilization of citizen troops in World_Wars I and II . But , with rare exception , this is not a history of the state as told through the lives of Establishment figures . As such , it is also a monument to the expansiveness of the civil_rights movement during the fateful period in which the mural was made , as well as_to the muralists who made_it . The painting was executed in five big chunks -- 1976 , 1978 , 1980 , 1981 and 1983 -- by five groups of mural makers , mostly young people and principally led by artist Judy Baca , who conceived the project and found the funds to do_it . Altogether , the names of 187 muralists are listed on the wall , while a shifting array of government , corporate and private sponsors is also identified . The &quot; Great Wall &quot; builds_on an important Chicano tradition of assembling fluid , multifaceted yet structured groups of people in_order to establish a vital interaction between aesthetic goals and social engagement . The mural ' s makers would research and select historical episodes for depiction , and these would be developed_into pictorial form under the supervision of Baca and other lead artists . That organizational sense of &quot; structured fluidity &quot; is bracingly reflected in the mural ' s composition , which unspools as a continuous narrative . Its 41 scenes are not isolated , independent events , rendered like discrete panels in a comic_strip . Instead , symbolically charged , sometimes witty episodes flow in and out of one another , across the wall ' s horizontal expanse . T he visual effect is to endow the imagery of sociopolitical striv ing with a sense of both timelessness and presentness . The human struggle for independence is shown to have a long history , while every episode reverberates against every_other . Stylistically , a sharp break occurs in 1980 . The two earlier mural segments speak with the untrained visual eloquence of folk_art ; the three subsequent ones suddenly pump up the volume , evolving into a highly sophisticated graphic montage with a distinctly Pop sensibility -- Jose Clemente Orozco meets Madison Avenue . The shift suggests a new status and strategy for the mural ' s subject . In an extraordinary metaphorical engagement of its physical context , the huge mural unfolds along a half-mile stretch of the Tujunga Wash , which is part of the San Fernando Valley ' s flood-control system feeding into the Los Angeles River . The mural runs parallel to Coldwater Canyon Avenue , stretching_along the western wall from Burbank Boulevard to Oxnard Street . The Tujunga Wash flood channel is a concrete scar , an ugly waste space necessitated by the water-management system pivotal to L.A. ' s history . The broad , deep channel cuts_through middle-class suburban neighborhoods on its way from Hansen Dam to the river . Where the channel passes Grant High_School , the mural suddenly appears . The mural ' s content , celebratory and defiant , sends an electric_current through a trash-strewn no-man ' s-land , which stands as silent testimony to a complex web of civic power relations in L.A. ' s history . That the chronological pageant unfolds northward against the flood-channel ' s southward flow adds a subtle grace_note to its imagery of struggle against the tide . * Judy Baca and the Mural Makers , The &quot; Great Wall of L.A. , &quot; Tujunga Wash , Coldwater Canyon Avenue between Burbank Boulevard and Oxnard Street , Van Nuys . ' Corporate Head ' Terry Allen and Philip Levine ' Corporate Head &quot; is that rare accomplishment , a laugh- out-loud-funny sculpture backed by a percussive resonance that lingers long after the smile wanes . Immediately accessible as an image -- watch for a_few minutes as passersby instinctively engage with the playful work_of_art -- the sculpture peels back in provocative layers . Terry Allen ' s bronze figure of an anonymous businessman , nattily dressed in suit and tie and carrying a trim briefcase at his side , bends at the waist before the entrance to downtown ' s towering Citicorp Plaza . The familiar pose suggests a simple act of homage at the gates of a royal palace of modern American life . Simultaneously , it presents the figure ' s ignominious backside to the bustling crowds who hurriedly ascend the steps behind him . One more thing : The bronze businessman has no head . Or , rather , his neck disappears into the pinkish granite slab of the office tower that rises before him , just beneath the polished-brass numbers that announce , &quot; 725 South Figueroa. &quot; Suddenly , the urban environment for blocks around takes_on the vivid glow of a gargantuan Conceptual art project : the businessman ' s brain made manifest . Yikes ! The slightly larger-than-life-size figure , who would be about 7 feet tall if he could stand upright , is at once funny , threatening and poignant . He is part blockhead , part uniformed automaton , part human fly trapped in modern amber ; we instantly recognize him as -- us . A brass plaque embedded in the ground at the sculpture ' s feet carries Philip Levine ' s brief poem : They said / I had a head / for business . / They said / to get_ahead / I had to lose / my head . / They said / be concrete / &amp; I became concrete . / They said / go , my son / multiply , / divide , conquer . / I did my best . As you bend to read the wingtip-warrior ' s words , you assume the bowed position of the businessman , and take your place in_line behind him . &quot; Corporate Head , &quot; a 1991 collaboration between a poet and an artist , writer and musician , is the outstanding commission for Citicorp Plaza ' s Poets ' Walk , a group of half_a_dozen collaborative projects between artists and poets scattered about the building ' s ground-floor public spaces . In this devastatingly concise and thoughtful sculpture , the Western civic tradition of the hero rendered in bronze is brought with conviction and humanity into the contemporary_world , after having languished for nearly a century . * Terry Allen and Philip Levine , &quot; Corporate Head , &quot; Poets ' Walk , Citicorp Plaza , 725 S . Figueroa St . ' Ballerina Clown ' Jonathan Borofsky E veryone is comfortably famil iar with the gesturing giants that provide eccentric signage for commercial businesses , like the friendly genies that loom over Carpeteria stores or the grinning Big Boys that gleefully offer a gigantic burger to passing motorists . The colossuses of roadside America are pop-public sculptures , put_to_work by private enterprise . They are also ancestors for Jonathan Borofsky ' s wildly imaginative , wonderfully poignant &quot; Ballerina Clown , &quot; a cartoonish 30-foot-tall figure of an eye-popping performer . Since the moment it was erected in late 1989 , the sculpture has been a landmark at the busy Venice intersection of Rose Avenue and Main_Street . Commissioned independently by a private developer for the facade of a mixed-use building of shops , restaurants and upscale condominiums , Borofsky ' s magnificently idiosyncratic sculpture is nonetheless pointed in addressing the public realm . In fact , one source of its stunning significance is the way it speaks_to the modern dilemma of public art itself . &quot; Ballerina Clown &quot; is an image of the gentle soul who wants nothing more_than to add some pleasure and beauty to the world but who is pitilessly being made a laughingstock . In these brutish times , sounds like an artist to me . The brightly painted female figure of a ballet_dancer in a fluffy tutu is perched on a soapbox high atop an architectural pedestal ; it sports huge , oversize gloves and the big , bulb-nosed mask of a sentimental circus clown , whose hobo style recalls Emmett Kelly or Red Skelton . Behind the dancer balancing precariously on pointe , a spotlighted curtain provides a jaunty theatrical backdrop . The sculpture is a modern version of the artist cast as clown or ignoble entertainer , subject_to the volatile tastes of whatever forms of social and political power happen to hold_sway . This image is at least as old as Watteau ' s 18th-Century paintings of the melancholic mime , &quot; Gilles , &quot; or Velazquez ' s pungent portraits of the dwarfs at the 17th-Century Spanish court . In the raucous circus of contemporary life , Borofsky ' s &quot; Ballerina Clown &quot; steps_forward to take its place at center stage . The sculpture has received its share of rotten tomatoes from the passing audience too . A few neighbors -- who would likely have paid little attention if a Carpeteria genie had been put_up on the block -- howled loudly when Borofsky ' s dancer was first erected . It has since become a distinctive landmark , although still the occasional target of dimwitted vandals . The hostility that some viewers feel toward Borofsky ' s sculpture is emblematic of the larger public suspicion toward modern art . But &quot; Ballerina Clown &quot; is brilliant precisely because it gives stunning visual form to the otherwise invisible social stresses and strains of art in our time . Borofsky lays_out the artist ' s modern dilemma in all its playful tawdriness and hopeful pathos . His sculpture is an unlikely civic symbol for the estrangement between artists and audiences , both of whom are bound by deeply human desire and equally human failing . * Jonathan Borofsky , &quot; Ballerina Clown , &quot; Rose Avenue and Main_Street , Venice . ' Unity ' Komar and Melamid I n the bureaucratic labyrinths of city government , peculiar ideas regularly get hatched . One of the most outlandish was an option provided to major L.A. developers , who are required by city ordinance to commit a percentage of their building costs to public art . A developer , if he or she wishes , can exercise the option to choose the project and the artist to execute it , without any participation whatever by representatives of the public . This is a Postmodern variant of aristocratic noblesse_oblige , in which a corporate oligarchy is required to behave nobly toward the huddled masses . It has brought us lots of tired stuff , including an actual dime-store knickknack blown_up to monumental scale ( in Little Tokyo ) and a sculptural metaphor for a skyscraper ' s high-tech air-conditioning system ( near the financial district ) . One magnificent exception proves the general looniness of the rule . that ' s because the artists , Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid , have an unusually good grasp of the internal workings of political bureaucracy , power relationships and glorious , civic-minded odes to The People . Emigres from the Soviet_Union well_over a decade before its collapse , they were steeped from a young age in the officious , pictorial rhetoric of social uplift demanded by their government . They know how to turn it on its head . On the ground_floor of downtown ' s First Interstate World Center , Komar and Melamid ' s painted 1993 relief-mural &quot; Unity &quot; is a beautifully executed , wildly funny satire on that rhetoric ' s hardy American cousin . Its subject is the predicament of multiculturalism in a capitalist_economy , as packaged for consumption by the public . If Americans of every moralistic stripe seem convinced that the only good art is art that is good_for_you , then it follows that corporate interests will champion only art that seems good for business . &quot; Unity &quot; is a big , undulating triptych whose form is extrapolated from 13th-Century paintings of angels found in the Porciuncula Chapel near Assisi , Italy -- the church from which Los Angeles takes its name . The triptych centers_on an exuberant relief of a skyward-gazing angel , who is rendered with a vaguely bathetic demeanor . The androgyne has the moony look of saintliness typical of Baroque paintings by Guido Reni . The chromatic lushness of the symbol-laden figure is reminiscent_of a Russian icon . It ' s cloaked in exquisitely articulated symbols : a red-and-yellow Buddhist banner , a golden halo borrowed from pre-Columbian images of an Aztec deity and a mahogany headpiece derived from Nigerian masks . The angel ' s spreading silver wings are poised to whisk the celestial creature heavenward , much as the bank of elevators in the lobby below stands ready to send you up , up , up -- to the ethereal realms of the skyscraper ' s 73rd floor . These grand wings claim a rather different source than the angel ' s other assorted parts , one that is considerably closer to home : They ' re copied exactly from the wings of an American_eagle , as depicted on the back of an ordinary quarter directly beneath the motto E pluribus unum . In &quot; Unity , &quot; Komar and Melamid have managed a double-edged achievement , at once celebratory and sobering . While the beauty of the relief-mural pays aesthetic tribute to a multicultural mingling of Euro- , African- , Latino- and Asian-American cultures , the idealized image of social harmony is finally being driven by , and subject_to , the commercial prerogatives of business . At the base of the tallest bank_building in town , &quot; Unity &quot; nimbly clarifies the context within which so_much social dialogue today takes_place . * Komar and Melamid , &quot; Unity , &quot; First Interstate World Center , 633 W . 5th St . ' The Poetry Garden ' Siah Armajani Neither a painting nor a sculp ture , &quot; The Poetry Garden &quot; ( 1992 ) is instead a functional environment designed as an inviting outdoor room in which visitors can sit and talk and read . The garden , privately commissioned for an existing 50-foot-by-70-foot courtyard adjacent to the offices and galleries of the Lannan Foundation , was intended as a kind of vest-pocket park open_to the public in an otherwise bleak light-industrial neighborhood near Marina del Rey . Iran-born , Minnesota-based American artist Siah Armajani created a place that aspires to be a living metaphor of nothing less than the democratic ideal . It works . Among its dazzling array of simple yet elegant elements , &quot; The Poetry Garden &quot; deftly merges a host of conflicting forms : Shaker-style benches of golden-hued wood slatted like the clapboards of an old New England house ; a garden-within-a-garden reminiscent_of Persian miniatures ; a dramatic , monumental gateway whose style recalls early-20th-Century Russian Constructivist plans for public information kiosks ; a double row of anthropomorphic ceramic jars stacked suggestively one atop another , lip to lip ; the hand-hewn enclosure of a Spanish Mission-style courtyard ; ecologically sound plants , capped by a magnificent California_live_oak , appropriate to its semi-arid desert setting , and more . Lots more . Two inspirations seem pivotal to the design . One is &quot; The Anecdote of the Jar , &quot; a poem by American poet Wallace Stevens , which the artist prominently printed on ceramic tiles above the backs of the benches . The other is the general layout of a classical Islamic paradise-garden , which Armajani knew from childhood . The Stevens poem addresses the relationship between nature and culture . Through the magical metaphor of a jar placed in the wilderness of Tennessee , the civilizing function of art is deftly asserted . An Islamic paradise-garden , enclosed by high walls and carefully planted according to custom , is meant as a refreshing sanctuary from the brutal desert environment beyond its fortifications . The connection between this ancient Middle Eastern form and Stevens ' ode to a ceramic jar taking dominion over the American wilderness links two disparate cultures . They are , of course , the two cultures shared by an Iranian immigrant to America . Armajani explores and memorializes his own history in &quot; The Poetry Garden , &quot; but he does so in ways that subsume the merely personal into a larger celebration of democratic principle , in which all can share . * Siah Armajani , &quot; The Poetry Garden , &quot; Lannan Foundation , 5401 MacConnell Ave . * There are other noteworthy examples of public art in town , such_as the Otterness sculptural ensemble at the Roybal Building and a magnificent pair of maps -- one of the Pacific Rim , the other of starry constellations -- in an expansive terrazzo floor designed by Alexis Smith at the new Los Angeles Convention Center . The artists responsible_for all these remarkable projects have made works in which the social background and physical environment of art -- its context -- have been profoundly engaged . That engagement is key to their exceptional level of accomplishment . Yet it ' s worth emphasizing that considerations of context do not stop at the physical , geographic , social , political , historical or any other academically researchable condition of the site . For the context of any work_of_art , public or otherwise , is profoundly shaped by our assumptions about art itself . These stellar examples of public art distinguish themselves -- in no small way -- by boring deeply into the conventional subjects , functions and expectations we hold for art and for artists , and for their relationship to the social realm . Discovering what art itself might be is the most basic job description for any artist who means to be a citizen of the world , which is what public art demands. * * For information on the conference &quot; Public Art : Realities , Theories and Issues , &quot; Thursday to next Sunday at the Biltmore Hotel , call ( 213 ) 258-4924 .</TEXT>
