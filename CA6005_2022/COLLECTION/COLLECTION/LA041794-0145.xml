   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT / THOMAS J . DUESTERBERG : BST IS NOT THE ' ANDROMEDA STRAIN ' ; FEAR OF BIOTECHNOLOGY , NOT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE , IS BEHIND THE OPPOSITION TO BOVINE HORMONE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new chapter has been opened in the debate between self-styled environmental advocates and proponents of high-yield American agriculture . Only this time , the debate is more_than academic . The environmental lobby ' s actions pose a threat not only to American agriculture but also to one of our fastest-growing high-technology industries and to consumers . They also threaten the global environment . The event signaling a new era in this decades-old debate was the decision by several of the nation ' s largest food retailers to restrict sales of milk produced with the help of bovine somatotropin ( BST ) , a genetically engineered hormone given to cows to increase their production of milk by 20 % or more . Many of the large supermarket chains indicated that the pressure brought by environmental activists was a key element in their decision . Environmentalists variously argue that BST poses a threat to human health , that it is an environmental hazard because it is genetically engineered and that it continues a pattern of overproduction of milk in the United States that hurts farmers and leads to environmental degradation . One argument that can easily be disposed_of is the central one of safety . The Food and Drug Administration has thoroughly investigated BST for more_than 10 years . It has approved the growth_hormone with no reservations , and a review of all known studies about BST recently completed by the federal_government found &quot; there is no evidence that BST poses a health threat to humans or animals. &quot; The opponents of BST see it as a test_case for halting the broad use of genetically engineered products . With a vision inspired by movies like &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; and &quot; The Andromeda Strain , &quot; scientific evidence and experience plays no part in their opposition to BST . In addition to the fact that BST poses no health threat to man or animals , the eleventh-hour attempt to restrict its use would have severe consequences for industry , consumers , the environment and the standard_of_living of billions of people . The assault on one of the premier products of the modern biotechnology revolution has economic consequences for both consumers and producers . First , increasing milk production would lower prices in the United States , while allowing increased exports to dynamic new markets like Mexico . Countries such_as India , which is increasing milk consumption at the rate of 2 million tons per year in_order to increase protein intake , could also use the new technology or import products from the United States . A more narrow concern is that the biotechnology industry is one of the most dynamic , successful and rapidly growing high-technology industries in the United States . We routinely create new products in health_care and food technology that are exported around the world . Because of the debate over health-care reform , that industry is currently under siege . Entrepreneurs and investors are no longer sure that they will get their products approved and be able to make a profit sufficient to justify investment risks . In 1993 , the biotechnology industry saw its market_value fall by 40 % and the value of new capital flowing to the industry fall by two-thirds . BST has the promise to be one of the stars of the biotechnology industry . If the restrictions on BST by the supermarkets hold , then this product could just be another nail in the coffin of one of America ' s most promising industries . Finally , there is a consequence of the assault on BST and other high-technology products to enhance food production that should trouble any true friend of the environment . By increasing the efficiency of production , we can produce more food on less land . The promise of BST , genetically engineered plants like the new high-yielding rice strains or the longer-lasting tomato , is to produce more high_quality food on less land in the future . If all_the world ' s farmers switched to the organic methods favored by the enviro-Luddites , to feed the current population would require bringing forest and virgin lands the size of all_of South_America into production and suffering a degradation in the qualities of freshness and appearance in food that most American consumers have come_to expect . Furthermore , only the United States , Argentina , Brazil and a_few other countries could hope to be self-sufficient . Deploying BST and other innovative biotechnology products is a major part of the answer to this dilemma . That is all_the more reason to have a rational debate on its merits , one that is based on solid fact instead of destructive nostalgia .</TEXT>
