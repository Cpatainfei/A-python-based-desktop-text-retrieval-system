   <HEADLINE> WEST VALLEY FOCUS : NORTH HILLS ; GROUP PLANTS SEEDS OF VEGETARIANISM WITH TOFU TACOS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you think a tofu-filled taco would be anathema to those fond of the traditional meat-filled staple , think again . &quot; It was very good , &quot; said Rosario Palomares , who had her first taste at a home cooking class sponsored by the Vegetarian Society . In gatherings reminiscent_of neighborhood Tupperware parties , the Vegetarian Society is attempting to deliver its meatless message to the Valley ' s Latino community . Although the society has staged food booths at Latino events in Los Angeles County for many years , it has only recently begun to host cooking classes in predominantly Latino communities . In February , the society held its first cooking class in a North Hills apartment complex where the majority of the residents are Mexican and Salvadoran . Eight people showed_up , said host Victor Forsythe , executive_director of the group since 1990 . &quot; We ' re reaching out_to the most marginal sectors of the community here in the Valley to help them reduce their daily food cost and to better their nutrition , &quot; Forsythe said . The classes , conducted in Spanish , teach participants how to make tacos and enchiladas using soy products as meat substitutes . Since the meeting , several of the attendees told Forsythe that they had given_up red meat and were showing their families the benefits of a vegetarian diet . Forsythe kicked_off his campaign last fall at the Granada Hills Branch Library with an hourlong slide presentation critical of the meat industry and a discussion of the history of vegetarianism . This week , Forsythe and volunteers are cooking vegetarian tacos in support of a march from Delano to Sacramento by members of the United Farm_Workers union . UFW founder Cesar Chavez was a longtime member of the Vegetarian Society . &quot; We ' re trying to tie into the struggle of that famous vegetarian , &quot; Forsythe said . TERESA ANN WILLIS</TEXT>
