   <HEADLINE> BUS RIDERS GIVE METROLINK A TRY ; TRANSIT : NEW PASSENGERS STRANDED BY STRIKE ARE ENAMORED WITH THE TRAINS . BUT FOR MANY , THE COMFORT IS A LUXURY THEY CAN HARDLY AFFORD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Up and down Van Nuys Boulevard , the corners were knotted with people waiting for buses that never came , but aboard the quiet , almost antiseptic cars of Metrolink Line 104 , the third day of a citywide bus strike passed Wednesday with hardly_a mention . To regular passengers -- with their crisp collars and Wall_Street Journals , their knitting_needles and Walkmans -- the bus strike meant simply a_few new faces at the station , a_few more people fumbling with the ticket machines . But to dozens of stranded bus riders , a trip on the Downtown-bound Metrolink was a first glimpse at a transit system where the windows are not scratched by graffiti , the seats don ' t smell and the ride is not quite so bumpy . &quot; I rode the bus , but I am not going_back , &quot; said John Stephens of Panorama City as he waited at the Van Nuys Metrolink station for the 7:23 a.m. train . &quot; I am_sick and tired_of hitting every ( bus ) stop . Sometimes the air conditioner works , sometimes it doesn ' t . But this is slick . There are two stops between here and Downtown. &quot; Stephens ' employer pays_for most of his bus pass and would put the same amount toward a train pass . The few extra dollars he would have to kick_in might well be worth the cost , he said . Yet for many of the regular bus riders , the comfort of a Metrolink ride is a luxury they can hardly afford . The round-trip ride between Van Nuys and Downtown , for instance , costs $ 8 -- compared to about $ 3 for the bus . &quot; Oh , it ' s wonderful , but the cost is prohibitive , &quot; said Jacqueline Spoonts of Panorama City , explaining that she will return to the buses when the strike is over . Metrolink officials said ridership on the Ventura County-Los Angeles line has increased 20 % since the bus strike began Monday . The Santa Clarita-Los Angeles line increased about 6 % . Other lines from San Bernardino , Riverside and Orange County were not affected by the strike . Whether Metrolink will be able to maintain those gains after the strike remains to be seen . The demographics of Metrolink ridership differ sharply from those of bus riders . Metrolink riders tend to be affluent suburban professionals while bus riders tend to be poorer workers , according to surveys conducted by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority . For nearly all Metrolink riders , taking public_transit is a choice . For most bus riders , it is a necessity . Metrolink riders praise the train ' s efficiency , but say they do not consider themselves dependent_on transit . Those survey results were validated as Line 104 hurtled silently past the warehouses and factories north of Downtown , when several riders were asked what they would do if Metrolink locomotive engineers went_on strike . &quot; I would have to drive_in , &quot; said Steve Maggi , who lives_in Oxnard and works in Burbank . &quot; Then I would just drive , &quot; said Melanie Polk , who also lives_in Oxnard and works in Los Angeles . &quot; It would be miserable , but I guess I would drive , &quot; said Tim Trombly , who lives_in Panorama City and works Downtown . &quot; You could call_in sick , &quot; volunteered Stephens , the regular bus rider from Panorama City . But for Stephens and other bus riders , like Michael Taylor of South-Central Los Angeles , transit strikes are a real concern . &quot; I ' ve been stuck all week , &quot; said Taylor , riding a special train between Downtown and his job in Burbank , added during the strike . &quot; It ' s been a problem , but you have to deal with it. &quot; Marta Rodriguez was trying to deal with it , but she kept shaking her head at the cost . &quot; This is comfortable , but the price is too_much , &quot; said Rodriguez , on her way to Van Nuys to visit a friend . &quot; You would end_up working just for train fare. &quot;</TEXT>
