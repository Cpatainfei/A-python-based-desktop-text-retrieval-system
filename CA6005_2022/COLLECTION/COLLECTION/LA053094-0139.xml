   <HEADLINE> TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL ; 6 OF 10 OPPOSE EL TORO COMMERCIAL AIRPORT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About six out of 10 Orange County voters say they are opposed to a measure proposed for the November ballot to require conversion of the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station into a commercial airport , according to a new Times Orange County Poll . If the election was held today , the poll showed , 58 % of the county ' s registered voters would vote against an El Toro airport , while only 39 % would support the non-binding measure . Opposition to the airport has remained constant over the past year , and actually increased slightly . An April , 1993 , Times Orange County Poll showed that 54 % of the county ' s voters were opposed to a commercial airport at El Toro , while 39 % favored it . The latest Times Orange County Poll , conducted from May 19 to May 22 , showed that opposition to the airport is solid in both northern and southern areas of the county . When the measure was filed with the registrar of voters in March , most observers thought it would generate a regional battle , with residents in the northern cities favoring the new airport and South County residents opposing it . But a telephone survey of 600 registered voters found that a majority in both regions oppose the airport -- 54 % of North County voters and 68 % in the south . When presented with various alternatives for the reuse of the base , scheduled to close by 1999 , only 28 % of those polled favored a commercial airport at the site , just slightly ahead of the 20 % who want to see it converted into an industrial-commercial zone . When voters were offered similar alternatives in the 1993 poll , they favored an industrial-commercial zone at El Toro by 22 % , followed closely by 21 % who wanted a commercial airport there . The recent Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates and included several questions about the proposal to build a new airport at El Toro . Cheryl Katz , who co-directed the poll , said voters are not convinced the airport would become the &quot; job machine &quot; promised by proponents of the ballot measure , called the Orange County / El Toro Economic Stimulus Initiative . &quot; People don ' t see the clear benefits of a second major airport in Orange County , &quot; said Katz . &quot; They are reluctant to approve something they think will end_up costing taxpayers money. &quot; Even though the airport was the top choice in the recent poll when voters were offered several alternatives for developing El Toro , Katz said support for it is still soft . &quot; There isn ' t a significant consensus on the airport . Proponents can say that it remains the top choice , but 28 % ( support ) is really a low number , &quot; Katz said . Backers of the airport initiative , including several influential business and political_leaders in the county , have until Wednesday to collect at least 66 # 703 signatures on a petition to place the measure on the Nov . 8 ballot . Business groups favoring the airport claim it would create 21 # 000 new jobs in the county . However , Katz said backers of the initiative have not succeeded in convincing voters that the airport would be a boost to the local economy . She said that county residents &quot; are still very concerned about jobs. &quot; The proposed initiative asks voters to approve an amendment to the county ' s General Plan to authorize a civilian airport on about 2 # 000 acres of the 4 # 700-acre base . In addition , the measure seeks permission from the military for use of the base runways by commercial air cargo carriers while the Marines go_ahead with plans to leave the base by 1999 . But the initiative is an advisory measure , and even if it is approved by voters , the Marines have said they do not favor joint use of the El Toro base . Mary Maguire , a Lake Forest resident , said she intends to vote against the initiative and does not believe a new airport would have a positive impact on the county ' s economy or the quality_of_life in surrounding cities . &quot; It ' s a two-edge sword . I don ' t think we would see that many new jobs , &quot; said Maguire , 40 . &quot; But even if it did improve the economy , it would be done at the expense of the communities around El Toro . We would be giving_up our quality_of_life . This area could become like the communities around Los Angeles ( International ) Airport. &quot; Garden Grove resident Charles Lamourex , 57 , supports the initiative and believes a new airport would improve the county ' s economy . &quot; Even if El Toro became just a cargo airport , there would be a number of new jobs that would be created . The demand for cargo handlers alone would be significant , &quot; said Lamourex , an environmental consultant . Poll respondents expressed little confidence that the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority -- the county agency sanctioned to study redevelopment options for the base -- can come_up with a development plan for the base that would stimulate the economy and create jobs . Only 9 % of the registered voters polled said they have &quot; a lot of confidence &quot; in the agency ' s ability to do the job , while 37 % said they have &quot; some confidence. &quot; An almost equal number , 35 % , said they have &quot; not much confidence &quot; in the county planning authority ' s ability to develop a plan for El Toro that could help the local economy . Greg Higgins , a 21-year-old sales representative from Fullerton , said that county officials have &quot; demonstrated they can ' t do much more_than talk &quot; about what to do with the Marine base . &quot; They need to wake_up and do what needs to be done , and that ' s put an airport there , &quot; said Higgins . &quot; We ' re all tired_of sitting around waiting for things to happen. &quot; Katz said that Higgins ' complaint echoed the frustration of many voters who are growing impatient with the process . How the Poll Was Done The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates . The telephone survey of 600 Orange County registered voters was conducted May 19-22 on weekday nights and weekend days . The margin of error for the total sample is plus or minus 4 % . For subgroups , such_as Democrats or Republicans , the margin of error would be larger . Times Orange County Poll / What to Do With El Toro Six out of 10 Orange County voters say they would oppose an initiative that would convert the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station into an airport .
