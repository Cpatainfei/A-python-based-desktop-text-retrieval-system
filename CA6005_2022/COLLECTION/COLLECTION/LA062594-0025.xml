   <TEXT> Seventeen years ago , huge sums of development money pouring into Sudan were going_to transform this vast land into a breadbasket for the Middle_East . A conciliatory Sudanese president was in the process of forging a lasting peace with the rebellious south . A Sudanese union with Egypt was to ensure that moderate Arabs controlled the Nile . But none of that happened . Today , Sudan instead finds itself cut adrift by old Western and Arab friends , a renegade that last August was placed on the U.S. State_Department ' s list of nations supporting international terrorism . The $ 800 million that once gushed into Sudan from the Middle_East , Japan and the West -- and made_up 55 % of the national budget -- has dried to a trickle ( maybe $ 50 million ) , and the Sudanese are left to ponder if all that has gone_wrong can perhaps be righted by the fundamental Islamic course their government now follows . Sudan has fought a civil_war for 28 of its 38 years of independence from Britain and Egypt . In those 38 years , it has had 30 governments . Sudan has trod every conceivable political path : Marxism , socialism , democracy , military dictatorship and now a populist style of Islamic fundamentalism . It has at various times made alliances with the West , the Communist bloc , the moderate Arabs , the radical Arabs . Everything has failed . Year after year Sudan -- Africa ' s largest country , a quarter the size of the U.S. mainland -- has slipped further backward politically and economically . Now , with inflation running about 200 % annually , Khartoum ' s furnace-like heat , swirling desert dust and sense of futility seem to have hammered the Sudanese into a somnolent state of lethargy . Islam has become the last refuge for a_people captive to quiet desperation . The young , disfranchised men who have flocked to Islam are the same ones who 20 years ago in Africa would have become Communists . For them , the marriage of politics and religion finds expression as a form of nationalism that views_as irrelevant -- or untrue -- charges that their government harbors terrorists , violates human_rights and wants to impose Islam on the Christian and pagan south . Both publicly and privately , government officials deny the existence of &quot; ghost houses &quot; -- little security offices tucked_away in Khartoum ' s labyrinth of dirt streets where Amnesty International has chronicled , by victims ' names and dates , a constant pattern of human_rights abuses . Nor do they acknowledge any link to terrorism or any presence of terrorists , contending that such charges are fabrications of American policy-makers intent_on thwarting the spread of Islam . &quot; that ' s simply not true , &quot; said Donald Petterson , the U.S. ambassador , who has spent most of his 30-year diplomatic career in Africa . &quot; Hamas , Hezbollah , Islamic Jihad , Abu Nidal -- these ( extremist ) organizations have offices here , and there is a relationship between them and elements of the government that is undeniable . We also have credible information that activities such_as the training of terrorists go_on here. &quot; Petterson -- the West ' s point_man in attempts to bring Sudan ' s behavior more into line with accepted international practices -- also said the U.S. Embassy has documented evidence of detention , torture and summary executions . &quot; The government ' s standard reply when I bring_up human_rights , &quot; he said , &quot; is , ' that ' s a pack of lies. ' To which I say , baloney. &quot; The United States has not publicly linked Sudan with any specific act of terrorism , as it has Libya , but few Sudanese outside the government refute the assessment of one non-American diplomat : &quot; This is a place that welcomes people no one else wants. &quot; Petterson said firm evidence of Sudan ' s involvement in terrorism came_to_light last summer from sensitive sources he will not discuss . To travel in Sudan today is to return to the Africa of a generation ago . The security apparatus is pervasive , and people choose their words carefully . Everything appears to be in an accelerated state of decay . Mounds of paperwork -- usually in triplicate with no carbon_paper provided -- are required for the simplest task . Checking_into a hotel , for example , visitors must provide a photograph and fill_out a form that will be sent to the government for inspection . Multi-party democracy is not even in the national vocabulary . While much of Africa has become more relaxed and democratic in the 1990s , Sudan seems caught in a time warp , its development retarded by ethnic discord -- the 26 million Sudanese speak 100 languages and the Arab north is at war with the African south -- by former President Jaafar Numeiri ' s neglect of the economy and infrastructure , by an absence of foreign investors who once packed the Khartoum Hilton but would now find a mostly empty hotel . Numeiri was a conciliator who made_peace with his political enemies and a treaty with the embattled south . But in 1983 , needing a new alliance , he reached_out to the Muslim Brotherhood , became devout and made the Sharia ( Islamic law ) the law_of_the_land , even in the non-Muslim south . The partnership bought him an additional two years of power , until 1985 , when he was overthrown in the only African coup ever led by the middle and professional classes . Sadek Mahdi , Numeiri ' s democratically elected successor , was toppled in 1989 , bringing_to power the current military regime of President Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir . His is not a government of wild-eyed mullahs . Many of his subordinates are articulate , Western-educated , dedicated to making the country work and as gracious as the Sudanese people themselves . In private they do not speak piously , and they are candid about the country ' s immense problems and the government ' s inability to solve them . But all indications are that Bashir is free to govern only as long as his policies do not run counter to the aims of the National Islamic Front . Publicly espousing tolerance and moderation , the NIF has taken_control of key ministries , crippled trade_unions , purged the military of non-Muslim commanders and orchestrated Sudan ' s increasingly rigid observance of Islamic dictates : All women are veiled and , as passengers , segregated in the rear of buses . Anyone caught drinking alcohol is flogged . Zakat , the Islamic tax for charity , is mandatory ( a man who owns 40 camels is taxed one camel a year ) . The leader of the NIF , Hassan Turabi , a soft-spoken , erudite , Sorbonne-educated sheik , is widely seen as an architect of the Islamic revival that has spread from Algeria to Afghanistan . He is not a junior partner to Iran , Sudan watchers say , and the Islam he espouses contains large doses of capitalism , an emphasis on nationalism and considerable equality of women ( who are allowed to serve in the militia and work side_by_side with men ) . Though Iran views Sudan as a useful avenue into Africa , particularly neighboring Egypt , Turabi and Bashir ' s positions are frequently at_odds with those of Tehran . Sudan , for instance , was critical of the allied coalition in the Persian_Gulf_War -- and of Iraq ' s invasion of Kuwait . Sudan has not denounced the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement , saying it is up_to the Palestinians to decide what is best for them . And in public statements it has been decidedly conciliatory to Washington lately , referring to the United States in the government-controlled press as a &quot; friendly &quot; country and welcoming the recent arrival in Khartoum of Ambassador Melissa Wells , President Clinton ' s special envoy . Washington , however , has been clear that relations will not improve until Khartoum cleanses its human_rights record and severs terrorist links . By all accounts , the terms for repaired relations that would enable Ambassador Petterson to forsake his bodyguards and armored vehicle have fallen on deaf ears . &quot; Eventually all this will work_out , &quot; a senior official said , expressing a view that does not square with reality . &quot; I think we ' re already seeing a softening in the White_House ' s position . They ' re starting to realize the importance the Sudan has to the West. &quot; In the barren offices outside his door , cobwebs clung_to the ceiling corners , and a legion of government workers sat at empty desks . Why , the man was asked , is Sudan important to the West ? He sipped his tea , thought awhile and did not answer .</TEXT>
