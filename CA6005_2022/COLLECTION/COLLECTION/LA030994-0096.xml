   <HEADLINE> ENTERTAINMENT ; DISNEY UNSURE HOW IT WILL ORGANIZE NEW THEME PARK ; DEVELOPMENT : OFFICIALS DEBATE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT OVERSIMPLIFYING U.S. HISTORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Walt Disney Co . is moving away from organizing its proposed park in Prince William County , Va. , around nine history-themed &quot; territories , &quot; such_as the Civil War and slavery , prompted in part by historians ' concern that the familiar Disney theme park concept could oversimplify the past . Instead of being built around topics including the family farm and Ellis Island immigrants , for example , the park could instead stress a handful of American values or cultural themes , which might include diversity , how conflicts have united the country or how Americans have responded to technological change , company executives say . The shift underscores the complexity and risk involved as the company prepares to invest at least $ 650 million in Disney ' s America , intended to package fun with education for families on vacation . Since November , when the project was unveiled , Disney executives , from Chairman Michael Eisner down , have stressed that its content remains undecided and that they expected debate over their handling of American history . Critics attacked the company ' s plans for portraying slavery after one official said the park would allow visitors to feel what it was like to be a slave . Eisner later called that statement presumptuous . Robert Weis , head of the park design team and senior_vice_president of Walt Disney Imagineering , would not give specific examples of potential changes to the park concept Tuesday . However , he said Disney is studying how Americans face the same issues time and again . &quot; One of the things I ' ve started to gravitate to is that no American story has a beginning or an end , &quot; he said . &quot; They have roots in an early period , they have dynamic points and . . . a lot of themes run_through our history. &quot; Though he said he does not believe the company is abandoning its original concept of the park , Weis said , &quot; I ' m not sure we have a certain direction yet . . . . Our thoughts are evolving. &quot; A Disney consultant said his intent is to avoid letting the company ' s talent for popularizing fantasy stories simplify or compartmentalize the American past , which might lead to stereotyping . &quot; One of the things I ' ve been concerned with is that the history they tell is a serious history , &quot; said James Oliver Horton , a professor of history at George_Washington University who was hired to advise Disney . &quot; I ' m not interested in a fantasy history , &quot; he said . In its first promotional_materials last fall , Disney outlined a 185-acre park that would bring_up to 30 # 000 visitors a day to &quot; recall the past , live the present , dream the future. &quot; Conceptually , it included nine areas , from &quot; Native America , 1600-1800 , &quot; which would describe earlier American_Indian civilizations , to &quot; Victory Field , 1930-1945 , &quot; based on the nation ' s response to World_War_II . Other areas included &quot; We the People , 1870-1930 , &quot; an Ellis Island re-creation that would tell the tale of immigrants ; &quot; Civil War Fort , 1850-1870 , &quot; which would tackle American slavery and the war that ended it , and &quot; Enterprise , 1870-1930 , &quot; which would describe industrialization . Company executives had described possible rides , such_as a virtual-reality World_War_II fighter_pilot flight and a Lewis and Clark river expedition . Now Disney designers are considering exhibits in which visitors can see the process of history being made , said Robin Reardon , a show producer for Disney ' s America . &quot; What if we had graduate_students doing research on some aspects of American history &quot; who would become part of the display ? Reardon asked .</TEXT>
