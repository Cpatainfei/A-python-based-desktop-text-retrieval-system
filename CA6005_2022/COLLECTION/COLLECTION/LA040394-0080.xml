   <TEXT> Robert K . Tanenbaum , a former New York prosecutor who touts himself as one of Beverly Hills ' staunchest law-and-order council_members , has come_to an ironic parting of ways with most of his competitors in the City_Council race . He is the only one of eight candidates in the April 12 election who has not enthusiastically proposed hiring more police_officers to stem the city ' s rising crime , most of it robberies and thefts . Tanenbaum , who is seeking a third four-year term , instead suggests that the department could be more efficient in its deployment of officers -- perhaps even putting lieutenants and captains on the streets instead of behind desks . In a remark that angered the police union , which has broken from its tradition of endorsing the incumbent , he urged that the city &quot; not add more police desk jockeys in suits. &quot; Debate over crime has dominated the race for two seats . According to police statistics , crime last year increased 15.4 % over 1992 . The city recorded 2 # 825 crimes in 1993 , an increase of 377 over the previous year , according to the report by Chief Marvin D . Iannone . Thefts of valuables from vehicles , the largest crime category , posted the biggest jump , rising from 574 to 849 incidents , while residential burglaries declined . Robberies rose from 212 to 281 . Violent crime remains low , with one homicide last year and few rapes . The force this year dropped to 128 officers from its authorized quota of 132 because of recent retirements and a hiring freeze that was only recently lifted , Lt . Joe Lombardi said . The number of officers , however , is considered by experts to be above average for a city of Beverly Hills ' size and population ( 31 # 971 residents in 5.5 square_miles ) , Lombardi said . The city has four officers per 1 # 000 residents , according to city statistics . In neighboring Santa Monica , the ratio is about 2.25 officers per 1 # 000 residents . &quot; We constantly have been told ( by consultants ) that we have as_many police as we need , &quot; Tanenbaum said in a recent interview . &quot; My concern is . . . we need to make_sure we ' re maximizing the number of police on the street , &quot; he said . Tanenbaum and his competitors , however , question how many officers are_on patrol . Of the 128 sworn officers , Lombardi said , 81 are assigned to street patrol . Tanenbaum said the city has commissioned a study to evaluate police deployment , including whether the city has too many ranking officers off street patrol . Some of Tanenbaum ' s remarks about police deployment have drawn criticism from the Beverly Hills Police_Officers Assn . as well as candidates . The police union , in a letter to residents , said it is supporting candidates MeraLee Goldman and Les Bronte , who favor beefing_up the force . Candidates Alan Robert Block , an attorney ; Mary Levin Cutler , an investor ; Bernie Hecht , a retired business_executive ; Trisha Roth , a pediatrician ; and Herm Shultz , a retired business_executive , all support increasing the force to varying degrees . The average annual cost for a new police_officer is $ 75 # 000 , which includes salary and benefits ( the city generally hires only experienced officers ) . Goldman , a planner , said she would like to see 10 more officers added to the force to beef_up residential patrols . She contends a volunteer panel of financial experts from the community could find the money for the officers in the city ' s $ 74-million budget . Block says he thinks the council should reconsider its practice of contracting for legal services , which cost the city $ 1.4 million last year , to free up money for more officers . &quot; The city has to have detectives following_up_on crimes . Everybody can ' t be_on the street patrolling , &quot; he said . &quot; We need more_than just a better allocation of officers. &quot; Shultz , who is president of a renters coalition group , said Tanenbaum ' s idea of deploying lieutenants and captains won ' t work . &quot; It ' s like asking Bill_Clinton to get_out on the street and asking all_of his staff to do the same , &quot; Shultz said . &quot; Somebody has to mind the store. &quot; He and Bronte , a business_executive and former Chamber_of_Commerce president , urged the city to encourage new business to locate in Beverly Hills as a way of bringing_in more tax_revenue . Cutler , who is endorsed by the Municipal League of Beverly Hills along with Tanenbaum , contends the city should use the projected $ 1.2 million in annual revenue from a recently passed increase in the hotel bed tax to hire more officers . Hecht said he ' d like more civilian volunteers trained to handle clerical duties in the Police_Department , and changes made in budget priorities to pay_for more police . Roth said the city can always use more police , but residents need to take a more proactive approach in protecting themselves and their homes such_as by forming Neighborhood Watch groups . &quot; We are a victim of our publicity , &quot; Roth said . &quot; We advertise our city as elegant , luxurious and wealthy . It ' s like asking a bank robber , ' Why do you rob banks ? ' Because that ' s where the money is. &quot;</TEXT>
