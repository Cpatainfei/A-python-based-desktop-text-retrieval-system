   <HEADLINE> ON THE DRAWING BOARD ; * SYLMAR ' S CENTURY GALLERY IS DISPLAYING FIVE ARTISTS ' INITIAL SKETCHES ALONGSIDE THEIR FINISHED WORKS . ' SKETCHY BEGINNINGS ' OFFERS THE PUBLIC A RARE INSIGHT INTO INSPIRATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an art_gallery , we are usually treated solely to the finished work of an artist . Yet , regardless of the medium , an artist ' s completed image has often evolved from the merest of sketches . At Century Gallery in Sylmar , viewers can see five artists ' fully realized works , accompanied by their initial sketches and other inspirations . &quot; When I go_to artists ' studios , this is what they always show me . They always have things taped and thumbtacked up -- what inspired them , &quot; said gallery director Lee Musgrave . &quot; I ' ve always wanted to show that material . Most artists are hesitant to show it . They don ' t want people to know . The material is increasingly valuable to scholars and museums. &quot; The exhibit , called &quot; Sketchy Beginnings , &quot; provides some insight into the varied stages artists go_through . Some sketches serve only as a point of departure for the final work . In others , one can see all_of the nuance and detail ; the sketches stand as accomplished works_of_art in and of themselves . Richard Shelton ' s very large triptych , &quot; Good Doggie , &quot; in oil and encaustic on canvas , begins with a pencil-on-paper drawing of the central painting , &quot; Composition Study. &quot; In a biting commentary on the corporate structure and its minions , the main image is of a corporate soldier walking into headquarters . A rather mangy dog is passing_by . In the left panel is a dead cockroach on its back . The right one contains symbols of money and greed . Between the pencil study and the finished triptych , Shelton also did a small oil-on-canvas &quot; Dog Study , &quot; which depicts only the dog ; an oil-on-canvas &quot; Architectural Study &quot; of the building in the central image without man or dog ; and a small &quot; Oil Study &quot; of the triptych . All of these studies are_on view . The mixed-media sketch on paper for &quot; Landscape of Dishonor &quot; by Frank Gutierrez conveys a good_sense of the finished work ' s composition , but not of the bodies that ooze_out of an open pipeline in a virtual sea of oil . The fully realized figures and the drama of the final work are not evident in the first , streamlined version . Eleanore Rembaum ' s photographs of architectural elements capture aspects of the complex urban environment that fascinate her . Here , her pictures form a mixed-media &quot; Study &quot; for abstract , geometric monoprints such_as &quot; Spatial Concepts &quot; and &quot; Spatial Design Panes. &quot; Pictures in newspapers and magazines are the catalyst for Richard Beck ' s abstract , surrealistic oil_paintings . &quot; Landscape With White Eruption &quot; is rooted in a newspaper photo of an F-4 Phantom jet slamming into a wall at 480 m.p.h. &quot; Southwestern Landscape with Crater &quot; developed from images of a bomb crater and a tanker explosion . Richard Valdes ' studies consist_of simple blue ink on notebook paper drawings . His oil on canvas , &quot; Singing , Some Say Somewhere Someday , &quot; depicts two women joyously strumming guitars in an appealing outdoor environment . One wears a peace symbol around her neck . Both have angels ' wings . Valdes states : &quot; I picture such a place . Where friendly songs can be heard so high up in the mountains , the last place where man hasn ' t built or paved a parking_lot . Like summer breezes , and easy lazy days that we all remember. &quot; One could never see that vision in Valdes ' sketch . That sketch , and the photographic images that have inspired these artists , &quot; have no identifiable texture or quality , &quot; Musgrave said . But the completed works have a quality specific to the artist . For Musgrave , it is a pleasure to present insight into the process of how artists take images around us and make them their own . WHERE AND WHEN What : &quot; Sketchy Beginnings. &quot; Location : Century Gallery , 13000 Sayre St. , Sylmar . Hours : 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Fridays . Ends April 8 . Call : ( 818 ) 362-3220 .</TEXT>
