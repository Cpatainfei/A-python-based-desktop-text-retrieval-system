   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO ; UNINTENDED REVOLUTION IN CHIAPAS ; PASSED_OVER BY SALINAS , CAMACHO IS TEMPTED TO RIDE HIS NEW IMAGE INTO AN INDEPENDENT RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As peace talks evolve in a cathedral in Chiapas , another political drama with far-reaching consequences is unfolding in Mexico . It is becoming increasingly clear that the government ' s representative , Manuel Camacho Solis , while negotiating with the Zapatista National Liberation Front is also testing a behind-the-scenes campaign to become Mexico ' s next president . If he proceeds , Mexico may soon witness the unraveling of the ruling party and the end of the political_system that has governed the country for more_than 60 years . As President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s &quot; commissioner for peace , &quot; Camacho has spent the past few weeks negotiating and ingratiating himself with the masked leaders of Mexico ' s peasant rebellion -- and getting voluminous coverage in the media . In the meantime , his top aides have organized dinners for their boss with Mexico ' s most powerful businessmen , rented a large office_building ( presumably for campaign headquarters ) in Mexico_City , leaked Camacho ' s presidential aspirations to the foreign press and conducted nationwide polls to measure his popularity . The &quot; Magnificent Seven &quot; -- as the Camacho team is jokingly referred to -- are playing hard ball and high politics . Many people , including Camacho himself , thought that he would be Salinas ' choice to head the PRI ( Institutional Revolutionary Party ) ticket in August . Instead , Salinas chose a protege , Luis Donaldo Colosio , whose campaign officially began on Jan . 1 , the day the rebellion broke_out in Chiapas . Burdened by Camacho ' s growing popularity and the anti-government sentiments awakened by Chiapas , Colosio is running a clumsy and ineffectual campaign . Camacho might try to persuade Salinas that Colosio has become a political liability and should be removed . While this might appeal_to Salinas ' well-known pragmatism , the president may_not be willing to risk unleashing political havoc in the name of democracy . In that case , Camacho could run as the candidate of one of Mexico ' s smaller parties that may be willing to support his candidacy in return for future power and prestige . Camacho would portray himself as Mexico ' s modernizing yet moderate alternative ; as more of a democrat than the PRI-tainted candidate and as less of a radical than the leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas . Yet it would be a mistake to view Camacho as the beacon of democracy in Mexico . He has played by the PRI ' s rules for more_than 15 years . As mayor of Mexico_City , he was recognized as a political broker , not as an apostle of substantive political reform . His considerable mediating skills helped Salinas save face after the turbulent and widely questioned presidential elections in 1988 . And several of his top aides are young dinosaurs , known for their less than modern political practices . Camacho is a Mexican version of Japan ' s Morihiro Hosokawa -- a pragmatic tactician using a crisis and the attendant outcry for reform to further his political standing . Like Hosokawa , he can be viewed_as a modernizer but also as an opportunist , seeking to transform the political_system so that he can lead it . Once in power , however , like most politicians , he would have to be pushed and prodded to loosen the reins . Would a Camacho candidacy spur political change in Mexico ? Initially it would split an already divided and bewildered PRI . Ever since the Chiapas uprising , members of Mexico ' s ruling party no longer know whether to gamble on Salinas the lame_duck , Colosio the dazed and confused or Camacho the loose cannon . Colosio ' s removal would certainly lead his supporters to revolt , and a period of instability and political cannibalism would ensue . Yet a Camacho candidacy would mean the end of the PRI as Mexico has known it , opening windows of opportunity for the kind of competitive politics Mexico so desperately needs . Whether that is worth the climate of uncertainty that his experimental challenge to PRI would create is something only Camacho can calculate . Mexican politics were in a state of flux before the Chiapas crisis erupted , but Camacho may consider the gravity of that complication reason enough to put his presidential ambitions on the back burner for six years . If Colosio miraculously recovers in the polls , or if the negotiations in Chiapas get bogged down , Camacho may retrench and wait until after the August election to build his own political base , a Mexican social_democratic_party , from which to run_for the presidency in 2000 . In any event , it will be a great irony if Camacho the rejected uses his role as commissioner of peace to springboard back into the political wars .</TEXT>
