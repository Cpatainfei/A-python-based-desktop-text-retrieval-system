   <HEADLINE> CAPITOL JOURNAL : FOR BROWN , AN ISSUE WITH A HISTORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Decades ago , former Gov . Pat Brown advised his son Jerry : &quot; In California , you don ' t mess with a man ' s guns. &quot; When Jerry became governor , he amended that counsel to include &quot; a man ' s car. &quot; Now , daughter Kathleen seems to have quietly adopted this paternal guidance for &quot; the death penalty. &quot; You don ' t mess with something that ' s favored by three-fourths of all voters and two-thirds of_your_own party , even if you find it morally repugnant . You try hard not to even talk_about it . This is why Treasurer Kathleen Brown , the Democratic front-runner for governor , says only that she ' ll enforce the death_penalty and insists that ' s really all voters want or need to know . Her reasons for opposing it -- on religious grounds as a Catholic and its questionable value as a deterrent -- are &quot; irrelevant , &quot; she contends . What is not irrelevant , she knows from close-up observation , is the firestorm this issue can ignite if it is not handled delicately . She was a young teen-ager when her father briefly stayed the execution of &quot; Red_Light Bandit &quot; Caryl Chessman -- at Jerry ' s urging -- and then led an unsuccessful fight to abolish capital_punishment . &quot; My family was booed in public , &quot; Pat Brown later wrote in his autobiography . &quot; My political stock fell so low that there was talk_of a recall. &quot; During her father ' s two terms , Kathleen watched him agonize as he sent 36 people to the gas_chamber and commuted the sentences of 23 others to life imprisonment . The issue &quot; seriously damaged my political future , &quot; he recalled . * Kathleen Brown later saw her brother irreparably injure his career by appointing Rose Elizabeth Bird as chief_justice of the California Supreme Court . Bird ' s continual overturning of death_penalty sentences prompted her ouster by angry voters . So , based on_her_own family ' s experience , Brown believes this is an issue to avoid . If she ' s upfront and says it ' s her belief that the state doesn ' t have a moral right to kill , then -- she suspects -- some reporter next will ask about the morality of government waging war or financing abortions . If she asserts that capital_punishment is not a deterrent to violent crime or maintains -- as her father did -- that it also clogs the courts and is enforced unfairly , this will provide ammunition for her political opponents , she figures . And she ' s probably right . But there is no escaping this issue , especially for a Brown . By stonewalling when pressed by reporters to be more forthcoming about her views , she may be aggravating the damage already caused by being_on the &quot; wrong side &quot; politically . She is adding_to the debate an unnecessary aura of mystery . She is licensing political adversaries such_as Darry Sragow , campaign manager for Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi , to proclaim : &quot; Refusing to say why she ' s opposed to the death_penalty makes this a character issue . Voters don ' t expect to always agree with elected officials , but they expect them to have the courage to deal with an issue straight-on. &quot; Character and courage are premium political buzzwords . * After last week ' s televised debates , Sragow conducted a poll and concluded that Brown is most vulnerable on the death_penalty . So he is staking Garamendi ' s slim chance for victory in the Democratic primary on a TV ad attacking Brown ' s position . What happened next puzzled many political pros . Brown ' s campaign manager , Clint Reilly , countered with a TV ad bashing Garamendi for his handling of the failed Executive Life_Insurance Co . Brown had virtually ignored Garamendi until this point , targeting instead Republican Gov . Pete Wilson . She had been playing a &quot; November strategy. &quot; And the question was : Why now use_up $ 500 # 000 to attack Garamendi when she ' s comfortably ahead by 12 points among likely voters , according to the latest Times poll . The conventional wisdom is that Reilly is taking no chances ; an upset loss could end Brown ' s career and certainly play havoc with his . But this ad strategy has as much to do with November as with Tuesday ' s election . Reilly sees Wilson and Garamendi as surrogates . The governor ' s TV ads attacking Brown have benefited Garamendi , who stands to reap the benefit in votes . Wilson was a surrogate campaigner for Garamendi , Reilly theorizes , and on Tuesday Garamendi will be a surrogate recipient of potential Wilson votes_in November . Reilly doesn ' t want Democratic voters to get_into the habit of voting for any gubernatorial candidate except Brown . There also are two other reasons for hitting Garamendi , in Reilly ' s view : He deserves it for beating_up on Brown , and it sends a message to Wilson that any attacks will be returned . Now Wilson is waiting his turn_to attack Brown on the death_penalty . She may find that her best remedy is a dose of candor .</TEXT>
