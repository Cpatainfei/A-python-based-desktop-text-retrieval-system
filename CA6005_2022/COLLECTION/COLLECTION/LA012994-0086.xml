   <TEXT> Economist Karoly Soos strikes a pensive pose when asked if this nation has lost its leading edge to the Czech Republic or Poland in the regional quest to overcome communism . He removes his musty spectacles , polishes them with the wider end of his tie , inspects a shirt_button and ponders the ceiling before offering an answer . &quot; Don ' t forget Slovenia , &quot; the Parliament ' s chief budget analyst finally replies . &quot; Their economy is performing quite well too. &quot; While Soos is only half-serious in lengthening the list of Hungary ' s post-Communist betters , this nation -- the unquestioned front-runner only three years ago -- has witnessed such a miserable downturn in recent months that even optimists are frowning . Almost five years after Hungary triggered the wave of East European anti-Communist revolutions , the economic expansion that was supposed to follow political restructuring still looms out_of_reach . Privatization is stagnant , Western investors are looking elsewhere , and 20 % inflation and 15 % unemployment are both on the rise . True , this former Hapsburg capital rarely passes a day without some new hamburger franchise or shoe_store compounding the crowds and neon glitz of the traffic-clogged center . And Hungary tallied another record year for foreign investment by attracting $ 2.2 billion in 1993 , thanks to an $ 875-million telecommunications deal ramrodded through just under the New Year ' s wire . But beneath Budapest ' s veneer of prosperity , and despite Hungary ' s head_start with the 1970s-era reforms known as &quot; goulash communism , &quot; this nation of 10 million has failed to exploit its advantages , and officials both in and out of the government admit it . Due in part to a controversial bank &quot; consolidation &quot; last month , Hungary ' s combined domestic and foreign debt has increased to a disastrous 80 % of gross_national_product , Soos says . Recession in Western Europe also contributed to a 25 % drop_in Hungarian exports last year , resulting in the first negative trade_balance in the country ' s short capitalist history , a staggering $ 3-billion deficit . &quot; Somehow there hasn ' t been enough willingness of the government to achieve important results . Everyone was happy believing the role this government had when it came_into power , &quot; says Soos , a leading figure in the opposition Alliance of Free Democrats . It is one of several parties expected to benefit in May elections from the current government ' s lackluster performance . The center-right ruling coalition , led until last month by the late prime_minister , Jozsef Antall , has prided itself on being the only freely elected government in Eastern Europe to survive a full_term without being toppled by popular disenchantment . But as the end of the first four-year parliamentary term approaches , boasts of longevity by Antall ' s Hungarian Democratic Forum are providing little solace for a ruling party that commands less than 10 % support . Antall died Dec . 12 after a long battle with cancer . He was swiftly replaced by a handpicked successor , former Interior Minister Peter Boross , who has vowed to uphold Antall ' s policies and values in serving out the last months of his term . Antall ' s death deepened Hungarians ' gloom over their deteriorating circumstances . But the Forum ' s popularity -- or lack of it -- has been little affected by his passing . Two liberal political factions , and even the successor party to the once-reviled Communists , have for months been getting more support in opinion polls than the Forum . &quot; You can ' t find any sober person in Hungary who thinks this government will remain in power , &quot; says Peter Szirmai , president of the National Assn . of Entrepreneurs . &quot; It is impossible . There will definitely be a change . We just don ' t know who or how. &quot; Szirmai ' s group , which operates like a chamber_of_commerce in looking_out for interests of private business , would be a natural power base for the purportedly right-leaning Forum , if Hungarian political forces would abide_by their labels . But in the uncertain world that has unfolded since one-party Communist rule was thrown_off , Antall ' s Forum has shown itself to be more protective of social_welfare than some socialist factions . It has pumped expensive subsidies into doomed industries to save jobs , pushing the national budget deep into the red to keep a bankrupt social_welfare system afloat . Most damaging to the Forum ' s image and to the nation ' s political balance_sheet has been what both government and opposition politicians describe as a snail ' s pace in privatization . Other East European_countries executed a rapid transfer from state to private ownership by distributing shares of public assets to citizens . That has allowed the Czech Republic , where unemployment and inflation are both in impressively low single digits , to convert almost all_of its property to private ownership . Even in Poland , which now has a Socialist-led government , the private sector accounts_for more_than half of the economy , while in Hungary the share has stalled around 40 % . In contrast with the distributive approach , Hungary sought to sell state-owned property to local or foreign investors . Many economists here still argue they were right to do so . &quot; If you are given a dog , you don ' t have the same attitude toward it as when you buy a dog , &quot; says Erno Racz , director of privatization for the State Property Agency . He and others who are dismissive of the practice of changing ownership by giving people something for nothing contend that only owners willing to plunk_down their hard-earned money can provide the kind of self-interested management necessary for success . The problem , they now concede , is that there were far more enterprises on offer than there were interested and responsible owners . The most promising companies sold early , especially those where former Communist_Party bureaucrats were able to cash_in_on connections with investors abroad . More_than a_few former deputy ministers now earn handsome salaries managing private companies that were once part of the government_offices they directed . Privatization through sale or public stock offerings worked for state-owned firms accounting_for about one-third of state assets , creating the foundation of a stable , if not thriving , Budapest stock_market . But toward the middle of the four-year term to which Antall was elected , the government decided to hold_back 160 of the more profitable state operations from public offer in hopes of earning money for the state ' s empty coffers . They include most public_utilities , transportation and other vital services . Despite that move , state-owned businesses performed abysmally in 1993 , posting an overall loss and compelling the government to rethink its approach to privatization . &quot; A bureaucracy is not_able to act_as a private owner . Never , &quot; says Racz , who concedes that clinging_to so_much property was probably the government ' s biggest mistake . That left only the least attractive factories , like steel plants and other antiquated heavy industries , on the market for potential foreign or Hungarian investors . Most of the industrial white_elephants have yet to be sold . As much as 30 % of the Hungarian labor_force is still employed at the doomed enterprises -- a colossal drain on the national budget as well as an unemployment time_bomb set to go_off as soon as this government or the next one is forced to closed them . Critics of Hungary ' s first post-Communist government also lament its formula for land privatization , which broke_up agricultural cooperatives that had been the one sector of the socialist_economy that performed well . Farm output tumbled by an estimated 40 % last year . To be fair , say opposition leaders poised to inherit control of Hungary ' s flagging fortunes , much of the difficulty is the consequence of history rather than government bungling . &quot; All former Communist countries have problems with their economies , &quot; says Tamas Deutsch , 28 , a lawyer and vice_president of the Alliance of Young Democrats , which tops the popularity polls and is widely expected to be part of the next government . &quot; The previous 40 years of communism was more responsible_for these problems than the last three or four years. &quot; Nevertheless , says Deutsch -- whose jeans , pierced ear and fashionable stubble are almost a uniform among the party ' s counterculture activists and yuppies -- the Forum and its conservative partners must shoulder blame for fiscal indiscipline , putting brakes on privatization and tolerating wide-scale corruption . The Young Democrats and their elders in the Alliance of Free Democrats have already worked_out a political_program that identifies economic_growth as the highest priority for any government they might become part of . Elections are still more_than three months away -- May 8 is the date considered most likely -- and the vote distribution is far from certain . But the trading of coalition talks is already under way . Fast on the heels of the Young Democrats is the greatly reformed former Communist_Party , which renamed itself the Hungarian Socialist_Party in the transition to multi-party rule that culminated in a March , 1990 , election . The Socialists , led by former Foreign Minister Gyula Horn , have been rising in the esteem of Hungarian workers nostalgic for the days when jobs were certain and prices were low . Because at least nine parties are believed to have good chances of clearing the 5 % minimum of voter support needed to win seats in Parliament , a coalition of at least three parties is likely if the current splintering continues . Viktor Orban , the Young Democrats ' leader and likely candidate for prime_minister , has loudly refused to take_part in any coalition with the Socialists , saying that his liberal_party , which only recently dropped a requirement that members be younger than 35 , would rather join forces with the Forum than with the party that bequeathed Hungary its present crises . But the Socialists ' early campaign theme of soothing transitional hardships is steadily winning support among those eager to hear that there might be one choice that would end their pain . Their growing popularity raises the prospect of repeating last year ' s electoral results in Poland , where a reform-minded Socialist_Party now heads the government . Fears of such a popular retreat on market-oriented reforms explain part of the chill in Western investment here , which would have dropped_by nearly half last year if not for the hurried selloff of 49 % of the state telecommunications_system to U.S. and German investors . The late-December deal , announced only two days after the bidding deadline , was pulled from the previously untouchable state property pool . While Hungary is down after a year of disappointments , politicians from all sides say it is far from out . The Czech Republic , most concede , has outperformed Hungary in revamping industry . But they argue that they have nothing to be ashamed of in comparison with any other country in the former East Bloc . &quot; It would have taken any government more_than four years to sweep_away the ruins of 40 years &quot; of Communist mismanagement , says Forum spokesman Karoly Herenyi . &quot; Hungary has carried_out much of the political and legislative reform yet to be tackled in Poland or the Czech Republic. &quot; Herenyi contends that the Forum is still in the running for partnership in the next government , and like most political forecasters he holds_out the possibility of a grand coalition uniting the current ruling party with the allied Young and Free Democrats . While alliances of such unlike factions in other countries often lead to parliamentary paralysis , Western diplomats here note that all leading parties have similar programs for economic recovery . &quot; Whatever the election outcome , the policies will have to get better , &quot; says Szirmai , who has low expectations for this year but predicts economic_growth in 1995 . &quot; Everyone , especially those in power , realizes it is time for change. &quot;</TEXT>
