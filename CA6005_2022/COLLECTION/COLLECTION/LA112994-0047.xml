   <HEADLINE> THE ASIA BOOM ; PACIFIC RIM MOVERS AND SHAKERS ; ' OUR COMPANY DOESN ' T WANT TO OPERATE HOTELS AND OWN OFFICE_BUILDINGS . WE JUST WANT TO DO CONSTRUCTION WORK. ' KAZUTOSHI TORIKAI , MANAGER OF OVERSEAS PLANNING AND STRATEGY , KUMAGAI GUMI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In Hong Kong , when you think_of tunnels , you think_of Japan ' s Kumagai Gumi company . Although the colony ' s British rulers gave the contract for the first tunnel under Hong Kong harbor -- a subway -- to a British firm , Kumagai established a foothold for itself when it led construction of the second tunnel -- for automobiles . Working on a &quot; build-operate-transfer &quot; basis , the tunnel builders were given 30 years to recoup their investment and reap a profit before transferring ownership to the Chinese government , which will take_over Hong Kong in 1997 . Plans called_for construction to be completed in 42 months , but Kumagai did_it in 38 months . &quot; Time is money , &quot; said Yukio Fujishima , a Kumagai spokesperson . And in this case , the four extra months the joint_venture tunnel company got_through the quick construction translated directly into extra toll revenue . Since then , Kumagai hasn ' t been left_out of any of three subsequent harbor tunnel projects . It also won contracts to build two of Hong Kong ' s new landmarks -- the 70-story Bank of China Tower and the city ' s Cultural Center at the tip of Kowloon Peninsula . Kumagai , which also has built an extensive business network in Taiwan , Indonesia , Thailand , Malaysia and China , is not plunging headlong into construction in Asia . But it does expect its foreign -- especially Asian -- business to increase by 35 % , to about $ 770 million annually within the next three years , said Kazutoshi Torikai , manager of overseas planning and strategy . That sum will amount to only about 7 % of the company ' s total , he said . Burned badly by a collapse of the real_estate markets in the United States and Australia in the late 1980s , Japan ' s sixth largest construction giant , with 8 # 000 employees and $ 8.4 billion in sales last year , is &quot; suppressing &quot; its involvement in real_estate development -- one of the major growth sectors in Asia construction , Torikai said . &quot; Our company doesn ' t want to operate hotels and own office_buildings , &quot; he said . &quot; We just want to do construction work. &quot; From the mid-1980s until the early 1990s , Kumagai ' s overseas business soared to 30 % of its total revenues as it constructed such buildings as the financially troubled 50-story Americas Tower in New York . Last year , however , foreign contracts fell to only 6 % of its total . Losses incurred through sales of overseas and domestic real_estate investments helped drive down Kumagai ' s profits to $ 10.8 million in 1993 from $ 90.5 million in 1992 . Including its subsidiaries , the firm suffered a deficit of $ 65.1 million last year . The company remains wary of investing its own money in development projects in China because of the legal_system , which Torikai described as &quot; not yet fitted out. &quot; &quot; In China , we don ' t know what the law is . There are things we can ' t see . The risk is too big , &quot; he said . Overseas Chinese , relying_upon personal_relations with mainlanders , are investing their own money in construction projects in China , but &quot; we are not as aggressive as they , &quot; Torikai said . Already working_on one tunnel 330 feet underground in Yokohama , the firm has developed computer-controlled drilling devices and robots to such a degree that humans barely need to enter a tunnel construction project . Research is now being conducted to enable the firm to go as deep as 450 feet , Torikai added .</TEXT>
