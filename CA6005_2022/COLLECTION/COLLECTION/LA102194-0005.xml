   <HEADLINE> MTA SHAKE-UP PROPOSAL IS OF LIMITED SCOPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A proposed reorganization of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ' s management of Los Angeles subway construction calls_for a handful of limited changes , but avoids more sweeping measures that had been under_consideration . Prepared by MTA Chief_Executive_Officer Franklin E . White and aides , the proposal drew immediate criticism from two state legislators with jurisdiction over transportation spending . The plan drafted by the local transit officials proposes a series of management and engineering changes designed to prevent a repeat of the kinds of problems that have plagued the project . White ' s proposal calls_for shifting , over a seven-month period , a handful of inspection-management consultants under the direct employment of the MTA . It was sent confidentially this week to the Federal Transit Administration , which on Oct . 5 cut_off $ 1.6 billion of future subway funding because of dissatisfaction with the MTA ' s management of construction . &quot; The FTA did the right thing in cutting_off the funding , &quot; said Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz . &quot; They ought to be demanding a whole_lot more ( than what White ' s plan proposes ) . The FTA came_out with a big 2-by-4 . It would be a shame for it to turn_into a toothpick. &quot; Katz noted that the proposal makes no mention of whether White still intends to dissolve the Rail Construction Corp. , an MTA subsidiary that has overseen subway safety , construction quality and costs since mid-1990 . At the request of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan , the MTA board has twice postponed votes on White ' s earlier request to disband the subsidiary , which has drawn criticism from some officials for being too lenient with contractors . The matter could surface at Wednesday ' s MTA meeting . The proposal also indicates that White will not seek to terminate the contract of either Shea-Kiewit-Kenny , the builder of the troubled subway tunnels in Hollywood , or MTA-hired consulting_firms that supervised the work . White , in addition to seeking a lifting of the freeze on future federal funding , asked Federal Transit Administrator Gordon J . Linton for approval to resume tunneling along Hollywood Boulevard . White did not specify a date , but has said that he would like to resume digging by month ' s end . Excavation in Hollywood has been halted since Aug . 18 , when surface sinkages of nine inches were confirmed . &quot; We remain optimistic that all outstanding issues can be resolved by the end of the month , &quot; White said in a memo received Thursday by MTA board_members regarding the proposal , which he called a working draft . &quot; Our goal is to resume tunneling as soon as possible , but only when we have concurrence from the ( Federal Transit Administration ) . &quot; A spokesman for the Federal Transit Administration would not speculate Thursday as_to when the agency would permit tunneling to resume in Los Angeles . The spokesman , Pete Halpin , said federal_officials have raised &quot; some questions that aren ' t addressed by the report. &quot; He said he could not comment more specifically . &quot; In the view of our technical folks , they ' re looking_for some more information , &quot; Halpin said from Washington . In Los Angeles , local transit officials met Thursday with staff of the Federal Transit Administration to review the plan for resuming tunneling . And , included in the package sent by White to Washington , were new construction procedures recommended by the inspection-management firm , Parsons-Dillingham . For instance , the engineers recommended that metal struts be used for tunnel bracing -- not wooden wedges . Substitution of the wedges was approved in 1992 by Parsons-Dillingham and by the project ' s chief design engineer , employed by the firm of Parsons Brinckerhoff . The wedges were crushed under Hollywood Boulevard and project engineers have concluded that the failure contributed to the surface sinkages . Three types of soil-stabilizing grouting procedures also were recommended . The grouting procedures were not performed in the worst-affected area of tunneling . Copies of the reorganization proposal and related analyses provided by consultants of the MTA and the Federal Transit Administration were obtained by The Times . Among the developments : * The federal_government ' s consultant for subway work in Los Angeles said in an Oct . 13 report that the MTA &quot; relented to the contractor ' s demands &quot; by reinstating Shea-Kiewit-Kenny ' s tunneling superintendent , who had been expelled for safety-related reasons . The reinstatement of the superintendent , by the MTA ' s then-president of rail construction , Edward McSpedon , was reported on Oct . 8 by The Times . White ousted McSpedon three days later , while praising his performance . The federal_government ' s consultant , Hill International Inc. , questioned the reinstatement of the superintendent , Norm Hutchins , and criticized the MTA ' s commitment to enforcing safety standards . &quot; The ( MTA ) needs to be more forceful with_regard_to making ( Shea-Kiewit-Kenny ) reinforce its commitment to safety , &quot; said Hill International . * Although Hutchins ' status is not addressed in White ' s reorganization proposal , the document does say that Shea-Kiewit-Kenny has agreed to appoint a new project manager for the work . Representatives of the company could not be reached for comment . * According to the reorganization proposal , Shea-Kiewit-Kenny &quot; has agreed to submit a plan for resolving all &quot; of its deficient installation of wooden wedges used for bracing 12 miles of twin tunnels along both Hollywood Boulevard and Vermont Avenue . Katz , asked to comment on the reorganization proposal , said he was disappointed by what he termed its small scope . &quot; It ignores a number of the significant issues out there , &quot; said Katz , whose legislation created the MTA in 1993 by merging the former Southern California Rapid_Transit District with the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission . &quot; There ' s not much change , really , in how this thing is structured. &quot; Katz , who is seeking to block further state funding of the subway project until the MTA makes more sweeping changes , said that White has agreed to appear next Monday at a Transportation Committee hearing that will explore the construction management problems . Another legislator who has expressed concern about the MTA ' s operations , Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) , termed White ' s reorganization proposal &quot; inadequate. &quot; &quot; The restructuring appears to be a reshuffling , &quot; said Hayden , who is organizing a Senate Transportation Committee hearing on Nov . 2 regarding the funding and construction of the subway and other MTA policy issues .</TEXT>
