   <HEADLINE> NO LONGER LIVING_ON AN ISLAND ; JAPANESE : THE 40 # 000 NATIONALS IN THE SOUTHLAND HAVE KEPT APART , EVEN FROM JAPANESE AMERICANS . NOW , ECONOMIC WOES HAVE THINNED THEIR NUMBERS AND RECENT SAN PEDRO MURDERS HAVE INCREASED THEIR FEAR OF CRIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When parents came_to the orientation in Little Tokyo for their children ' s Japanese-language school last week , they were welcomed by a familiar sight -- a vertical , seven-foot-tall banner with Japanese calligraphy announcing the event , just like the ones in Japan . But the speech by Principal Atsushi Yoshioka included topics they could not have imagined in Tokyo : Do not let your children wear gang-style clothing to school -- it could attract real gang members . And please volunteer to help patrol school grounds to keep the children safe from crime . The speech was the same one Yoshioka gives each year , but with the shooting deaths of two Japanese students on everyone ' s mind , the parents listened more gravely than ever . That tragedy made these parents , like the other 40 # 000 Japanese nationals living_in Southern California , realize how much a part of Los Angeles they have become . &quot; Always I have to watch ( my children ) and hold their hands tight . If I ' m shopping and they disappear , I ' m so scared , &quot; Akiko Kenmatsu said at the orientation . The community of expatriate Japanese citizens includes artists , scientists , musicians , journalists , entrepreneurs and dishwashers . Some are here for just a_few months , others for decades . For students like those slain , time here is a rite of passage , an interlude of beach-going and leisure before joining corporate life . Southern California is , for Japanese , the No . 1 choice for study abroad . * But for the large contingent of business people sent by their companies , living_in the Los Angeles area is not a choice , but a duty . The area is Japan ' s corporate capital in the United States , with more Japan-based businesses than any other metropolitan area . Although the faces of these businesspeople from Japan change every three to five years , their community has become a permanent part of Southern California , changing the landscape with gleaming corporate headquarters , supermarkets and mini-malls catering to their needs -- and , most important to Californians , offices and factories that provide jobs to 60 # 000 Americans . The numbers grew rapidly in the 1980s along with Japan ' s worldwide economic expansion , but have dwindled in the last several years with the Japanese economic downturn . They are a largely self-contained community , separate from the students and artists . They also rarely mingle with and are occasionally in conflict with the community of Americans of Japanese ancestry that has been here since the turn_of_the_century . As the Japanese expatriate community mushroomed in the 1980s along with Japan ' s wealth , it became more insular , creating a nearly self-sufficient world of its own . Ken Amano , president of Nippondenso of Los Angeles , notes that when a Japanese family arrives in Los Angeles , its members can step into a miniature Japan right in Torrance and Palos Verdes , the center of the expatriate community . Without speaking a word of English , they can get medical_care , travel services , auto repairs and just about any Japanese product they could find back home . Even when Japanese nationals intend to assimilate into American life , it is very easy to give_in to the temptation to shop only at Japanese stores , said Amano , whose firm manufactures auto parts . The Torrance outpost of the Japanese Yaohan supermarket chain is the local PX for the community , featuring pickled plums , sea_urchin , burdock root and other food staples . An attached mall features Japanese toys , appliances , medicines , books , videos , greeting cards and cosmetics . There are 650 member companies in the Japanese Business Assn . of Southern California , 240 in Torrance alone . In the South Bay plain surrounding the local headquarters of Toyota , Honda and Nissan , a rich infrastructure has grown to meet the needs of their Japanese executives and families . The men enjoy karaoke clubs and hostess bars staffed by Japanese . They spend their weekends playing golf with other Japanese , taking_advantage of daily greens fees that run about $ 50 here as compared to $ 500 in Japan . The women join Japanese-speaking tennis leagues and choral groups . There are Japanese-language schools for the kids . * If this self-contained community sounds typical of many immigrant groups in Los Angeles , it ' s not . These Japanese citizens are not immigrants , and because they plan to return home soon , have less incentive to integrate into American society . They are more like the tight-knit community of American businessmen stationed in Tokyo than the Asian immigrants in Chinatown and Koreatown . The community of businessmen and students from Japan is also distinct from the long-established Japanese American community , which numbers about 120 # 000 in Southern California . Most working-age Japanese Americans cannot speak Japanese and know little about Japanese culture . Their grandparents generally immigrated as farm and railroad laborers at the turn_of_the_century from the impoverished Japanese countryside . Today , by contrast , Japanese businessmen sent over by their corporations are well-educated urbanites , and some Japanese Americans feel they are looked down on by the expatriates . &quot; Some Japanese nationals see Japanese Americans as below themselves , as the offspring of those who couldn ' t make_it in Japan , &quot; said George Nakano , a Torrance city councilman . Another problem for Japanese Americans is that many people do not distinguish between them and Japanese nationals . So when Japanese corporations or politicians create frictions with Americans , Japanese Americans find themselves taking heat for something they have nothing to do with . Still , some Japanese Americans welcome the chance to learn about their grandparents ' culture from the Japanese visitors , taking lessons in flower arranging or calligraphy . And some Japanese nationals say they appreciate that the earlier immigrants helped pave the way for their own acceptance . Japanese nationals admit they tend to be insular . &quot; Almost all Japanese wives like to stay in the Japanese community , not speaking English , and eating Japanese food , &quot; said Ryuko Sakai , who has lived here two years and has help spearhead efforts to reach_out to Americans . But she says that most families are drawn into American society because their children are in public_schools , and some make a real effort to contribute to American society . Last year , the women ' s committee of the Japanese Business Assn . raised $ 64 # 000 for Los Angeles schools , hospitals , disabled groups and Japanese American causes . Japanese women perform choral music at nursing_homes , volunteer at public_schools and participate in Neighborhood Watch groups . Similarly , Japanese corporations are making an effort to be good corporate citizens . Members of the Japanese Business Assn . donated $ 3 million to the Red_Cross and other organizations after the Northridge quake and $ 175 # 000 to schools . After the Los Angeles riots , Toyota set_up an auto repair training_program in the Crenshaw district , and Pioneer Electronics began a job-training center for high_school students in Watts . In Torrance , Councilman Nakano said , Japanese companies provided major funding for a new city cultural center . But despite such efforts , the families of most business people from Japan remain largely ensconced in their own world . To some extent , they are insulated from the harsher side of life in Los Angeles by their relatively affluent lifestyle in places such_as San Marino , Irvine and Palos Verdes . While many Japanese business people live a middle-class existence in Torrance or Pasadena , senior executives enjoy the same posh neighborhoods as their American counterparts . Sakai lives in a spacious house in Palos Verdes Estates overlooking the Pacific , provided by Toyota Motor Sales of America -- her husband is its president . Guests are welcomed , Japanese-style , with an invitation to switch their shoes for slippers in the marble foyer . The home is decorated with elegant contemporary furniture and modern woodblock prints of Henry Thoreau and Walden Pond . Yet Sakai and her friends , chatting in the sunny living_room , know that living_in Palos Verdes does not protect them from the problems of Los Angeles . It was just a_few miles away in San Pedro that two Japanese students were slain in a carjacking . Masako Yoshida ' s son was offered drugs at Peninsula High_School . And Iyoko Kawamura says that her son ' s Honda was stolen from Hermosa Beach and stripped . &quot; In Japan , even if the opera is over at midnight , teen-agers can come_home on the subway , &quot; Sakai said . Here in Los Angeles , she and her husband never stay for curtain_calls at the Music Center in Downtown Los Angeles because they do not like being_on the freeway late at night . Many Japanese nationals even avoid Little Tokyo because they consider it dangerous . After the student slayings , Yoshida ' s husband bought her a cellular_phone . &quot; In Japan safety is free , &quot; Yoshida said . &quot; Here we spend a lot of money to keep safe. &quot; Many families turn inward , toward their own community , because they believe that succeeding in the Japanese educational system -- which requires remaining Japanese in behavior -- is the key to the future security of their children . So while most children attend American public_schools , they also attend one of five Southern California branches of the Japanese-government-funded Asahi Gakuen school on Saturdays . The textbooks are identical to those used in Japan , and in any week the pupils will be_on exactly the same chapter as students in Japan . Before children enter sixth grade , many mothers take them back to Japan so they can begin to prepare_for crucial exams to enter good high_schools , the first_step toward getting_into a good college . The fathers stay in Los Angeles . Such separations are common in Japanese corporate life , where employees do not generally have the right to choose or refuse assignments . But despite the hardships of adjusting to life in a strange and sometimes dangerous country , many families from Japan come_to love America . The women enjoy the greater chance to speak their minds , and the freedom from the burdensome web of social obligations in Japan . Many children prefer American schools to the &quot; examination hell &quot; of the Japanese educational system . And many fathers enjoy the chance to spend more time with their families here than in work-centered Japan . &quot; The feeling here is very comfortable for me , &quot; said Yoshida , whose daughter is studying to be a veterinarian in Missouri . &quot; I would like to stay. &quot; Some women and children stay behind in the United States when their husbands are called_back to Japan . Other families even immigrate to the United States when they get the chance . In the end , though , whether Japanese business people and their families feel safe and happy here has more_than just anthropological interest -- it could have a serious impact on the Southern California economy . Many Japanese companies have reduced their presence in Southern California because of the economic downturn in Japan . The Japan Business Assn. ' s roster dropped 10 % last year . Crime problems are just one more reason to leave . Amano , the head of Nippondenso , said security problems have made many Japanese companies move from Los Angeles County to the Irvine area . Amano points to a seven-foot iron fence he had to install around the parking_lot in his Long_Beach industrial_park because of car thefts . He said he was deeply shaken by the death of an American employee ' s 14-year-old daughter in a drive-by_shooting nearby . * Amano said he would like to purchase the lot next door and expand his business , which employs 350 people here , because the price of the land has dropped sharply with the slumping real_estate market . But he is not going_to , not yet . &quot; I ' d like to stay here , &quot; he said , but may move the whole operation if the crime situation continues to deteriorate . Amano said he was discouraged by the pessimism of many Americans when he served on a committee of Rebuild L.A. &quot; If this were Japan , we could not abandon somewhere that goes_bad ( because the country is small and must use every inch of space ) , &quot; he says . &quot; We have to rebuild . &quot; But it seems that rebuilding activities lose momentum quickly ( in America ) because you have the freedom to find a safer place to live_by moving farther away . It ' s a sad story. &quot;</TEXT>
