   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; HUGH HEFNER ; IN THE SHADOW OF AIDS , EXAMINING WHAT ' S LEFT OF THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The yellow warning sign_on the drive reads , &quot; CHILDREN AT PLAY. &quot; The sauna -- once a site for strictly adult games -- is now used to store toys . The only bunnies in_evidence at the Playboy mansion are the furry four-legged kind , part of Hugh Hefner ' s personal zoo . At 68 , Hugh Marston Hefner is five years into his marriage to former Playmate Kimberly Conrad . He has two children with her , and has turned the day-to-day operations of Playboy Enterprises over to Christie Hefner , his daughter from his first marriage . These days he ' s writing his autobiography , looking_back at a life that , by any measure , has been quite an adventure . Hefner was 27 when he published the first issue of Playboy , in 1953 . It was an instant hit . Hefner ' s genius was in removing the furtive , plain-brown-wrapper feel of the pin-up publications of the day . He designed his magazine to be kept_on the coffee_table , not hidden under the bed . In the pages of Playboy , he associated sex with money , sophistication and style . And Hefner made himself into the embodiment of that Playboy ideal -- a regular guy who digs cool jazz , has a really neat bachelor pad and lots of sex with lots of gorgeous women . During the 1960s and ' 70s , his magazine spawned an empire -- a broad-based merchandising operation , Playboy clubs and casinos and the Playboy cable TV channel . Hefner was at the helm , often with the help of Dexedrine , and always with a Pepsi . He took the company public and then moved from Chicago to Los Angeles in 1975 , purchasing an estate built_in the 1920s by Arthur Letts Jr. , whose father founded the Broadway department_stores . Hefner transformed the Letts home into his Playboy Mansion -- complete with redwood forest , aviary , hot-tub grotto and game house . Parties were frequent and wild . But with the dawn of the 1980s , the foundations of the Playboy empire were shaken . To many young people the magazine was either offensive or a curious anachronism . Circulation plummeted and , in short order , the company lost gambling licenses in London and Atlantic_City . AIDS put the brakes on the sexual revolution . Dorothy Stratten , 1980 Playmate of the Year was murdered by her husband amid allegations that Hefner was somehow linked to the tragedy . Then in 1985 , Hefner had a stroke . He made a quick and seemingly full recovery . But Hefner says he was forever changed by the experience . The announcement of his marriage made front-page news in 1989 , and the once highly visible Hefner now jealously guards his new family ' s privacy . Hefner wore his trademark silk pajamas for this interview . His Pepsi is now diet -- and caffeine-free . Across an oversized backgammon table he talked_of sex , gender and repression . * Question : You ' ve always been right in the middle of the battle of the sexes . How would you characterize the relationship of men and women right now ? Answer : I think it ' s a very mixed message today . I think our society is fragmented . Messages regarding human sexuality have always been mixed in America . We are a schizophrenic nation . We were founded initially by Puritans , who escaped repression only to establish their own . Then the founding_fathers gave us the Constitution to separate church and state . But the one thing that got left_out of all those laws was human sexuality . The relationship between the sexes is in many ways suffering from even more confused messages than ever before . You have the religious right and some left-wing feminists both taking very conservative postures on sexuality and the images of sex . There is within the women ' s movement an antagonism towards sexuality and towards the opposite sex that obviously makes no sense and certainly wasn ' t what ( Betty ) Friedan had_in_mind when she wrote &quot; The Feminine Mystique &quot; and started it all_in the early 1960s . We ' re fascinated by our sexuality and frightened by it . And during the Reagan and Bush era you got an entire decade of anti-sex government . Sex is not the enemy . It is the beginning of civilization , family and tribe . Sex can be twisted and exploited , but in its most essential form , it ' s the best part of who we are . And it frightens us . Q : How did your efforts to open_up the dialogue about sex , gender and sexuality either add_to the confusion or provide some clarity ? A : This may be self-serving , but I sometimes feel that Playboy is one of the very few moral compasses when it comes_to sex in America . Very early on , Playboy was saying the McMartin ( child molestation ) case was just another Salem witch hunt . We got sexual hysteria in many forms in the 1980s . It included a wave of McMartin-style allegations that had nothing to do with any real child_abuse , and it was fed by AIDS . I said early on that if AIDS did not exist there is a portion of this country that would have had to invent it . Q : How has the reality of AIDS transformed the philosophy behind Playboy ? A : I think there was a window of opportunity that lasted for two decades -- from the invention of the pill in the early 1960s until the arrival of AIDS at the start of the 1980s . It was almost like the Garden_of_Eden . It was guilt-free sex with relatively few negative possibilities . Now the game has changed . But remember , disease has always been a consideration , and informed sexuality is always what Playboy has been about . Playboy began editorializing about AIDS before any other national magazine , and brought some rational thought to the subject when the ( television ) networks and the rest of the mass media were really involved in a form of hysteria . There was a cover story in Life magazine in early 1985 -- the shock headline was , &quot; AIDS -- Now We Are All At Risk. &quot; Well that ' s a lie . We are not all at risk . The risks are very clearly defined and related to specific behavior . There were people who said , &quot; When you have_sex with somebody , you have_sex with anyone they ever had_sex with. &quot; Again , simply not true . Q : Have you always been somewhat preoccupied with matters of sex ? A : I can remember in my adolescence feeling that many of the things that were hurtful and hypocritical in society were things related to sex . They included the kind of censorship laws that existed in the movies and books when I was young . I remember reading a story in Life magazine in 1939 . I was an eighth-grader , 13 years old . It was a story of a young couple , in their teens . She had become pregnant . That just wasn ' t supposed to happen to nice , middle-class kids . They didn ' t know what to do , and she suggested they kill themselves . He killed her , but then couldn ' t bring himself to commit suicide , and was_on trial . Both families blamed themselves for the tragedy . That story , even though I was a kid , had a tremendous impact on me , and I obviously read into it something about my inability to communicate with my own parents about those kinds of things . So I had a concern about repressed sexuality long before I came_up with something called Playboy . I realized early on that , in a free society , if you are not free in your own bedroom , then you are not free at all . Q : You supported Bill_Clinton during the presidential race . How ' s he doing ? A : Mixed . The good news is that he ' s coming from the right place . We had a federal_government that was in favor of censorship , wanted to make abortions illegal , and was against sex education and birth_control -- both in the United States and abroad . We had an attorney_general , Edwin Meese , who had no concept of law or the Bill of Rights . Clearly in these areas , Clinton represents a great improvement . And he ' s really trying to do something about the deficit , and reforming welfare , about health reform . It ' s just his execution that seems to be a problem . Q : You ' ve made the comment that there are countries all_over the globe where the situation in terms of sexuality and gender is much like it was here in the U.S. during the 1950s . Is Playboy ' s growth going_to come from the global market ? A : Yes , because with the end of communism and the opening of Third_World markets , the potential for Playboy is huge . It has been said that the two most famous trademarks in the world are Coca-Cola and the Playboy bunny_rabbit . There is certainly no one else in our area that represents the American_dream in this particular kind of way . That rabbit means economic freedom , personal freedom and political freedom . That potential is unlimited . Q : Your stroke in 1985 -- what is it like to realize that you are no longer working like you used to ? A : It was pretty dramatic . It happened about two in the morning . I was reading from a newspaper to a girlfriend and , all_of a sudden , I couldn ' t read the headline . I lost the ability to find the words for simple objects . The doctors showed me a tie , a belt -- I knew what they were but I couldn ' t find their names . But I was lucky . I had a good doctor , and the recovery was quite rapid . My feeling at the time was that I had just been missed by a train or a bus . I ' d been knocked_off the road , but I was going_to recover . And so it generated a tremendous feeling of optimism , and a sense of relief . I was born again -- in the best sense of the word . After my stroke I put_down much of the luggage of my life . I didn ' t have to prove anything anymore -- in business , in my personal life or whatever . And now , as I work_on my autobiography , I enjoy looking_back , seeing the connections , the causes and effects of my life . Q : Plenty of people have predicted your demise -- both personally and that of the magazine . And yet you ' ve survived . How did you do_it ? A : I ' ve always had a tremendously optimistic attitude about life , and the setbacks are never really setbacks for me , because I see it as a part of the adventure . And if you don ' t hold onto your dreams , you ' re a very foolish fellow , because dreams are what life is about . But from the beginning there was a need for some in this society to believe that Playboy and the things I stood_for were fundamentally flawed , and that I would somehow have to pay_for my sins . But I understand that -- it comes from the Puritan part of who we are . I , myself , am a direct , 11th-generation descendant of William Bradford , one of the first , staunchest Puritans who came_over on the Mayflower . I understand that . My life has been devoted to trying to bring a little more understanding to human sexuality -- not just in society , but also inside myself . The struggle has been internal as well as external . One of the reasons that I have such tremendous satisfaction at this point in my life is because I know I ' ve made a difference . I ' ve made a difference in a way that really matters_to me . I see a lot of terrible things going_on in the world , but there are some good things going_on too , and I feel I ' ve been a part of that . I really do feel I have been_on the side of the angels. *</TEXT>
