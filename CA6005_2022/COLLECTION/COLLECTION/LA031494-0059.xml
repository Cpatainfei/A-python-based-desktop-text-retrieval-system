   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; DOUBTS CLOUD PRESIDENT ' S JOB CONFERENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was nearly a year ago that President Clinton and his senior advisers began kicking_around the idea of hosting an international conference to figure_out why high unemployment_rates seemed to have become a fact of life in the world ' s industrialized nations . The phrase &quot; jobless recovery &quot; was in_vogue among American economists , who were trying to explain why the U.S. economy was bouncing_back from recession but the number of working Americans was not . In ailing Europe and Japan , no one was even talking_about recovery . But as Clinton opens the international jobs conference today , the increasing strength of the U.S. recovery and a steady decline in domestic unemployment are causing economists to question the usefulness of seeking global solutions to national problems . Clinton , however , said in Detroit on Sunday that he will present a proposal today calling_for efforts by Japan and Europe to do more to stimulate their economies through tax and interest_rate cuts and other measures . Clinton_Administration officials , meanwhile , are struggling to lend an air of relevance to the gathering they dreamed_up a year ago . &quot; They are trying to make_it more of a low-key event than they originally intended . They don ' t feel as strong a political need , &quot; said Marvin Kosters , director of economic_policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute and an economist in Gerald Ford ' s White_House . Yet even if the political need has dissipated , the underlying problem remains perplexing . Many of the world ' s most affluent nations have found that the pursuit of prosperity has been accompanied by an unexpected and to some extent unexplained side_effect : A growing legion of able-bodied men and women in Europe and the United States have either dropped_out of , or been driven from , the work_force and appear to have poor prospects of rejoining it . In the 24 most-industrialized nations of the world , about 30 million people are now without work . If all_the developing nations are taken_into_account , a staggering 3 billion people are out_of_work or earning too_little to live a decent life -- proportionally the worst global unemployment figures since the Great Depression , according to the United Nations ' International_Labor_Organization . The combined unemployment_rate among the 12 members of the European Union is nearly 11 % and is expected to reach 12 % by the end of the year . In the United States , unemployment has dropped to 6.5 % , but government and labor officials say the overall rate understates the true extent of the nation ' s employment malaise . Hundreds of thousands of people have simply given_up the search for work , dropping_out of the labor_pool and getting_by on public assistance . Forty-six percent of unemployed Europeans have been out_of_work for at least a year , compared to 6 % in the United States . With nearly 9 % of American men between the ages of 25 and 55 not working , said Lawrence H . Summers , Treasury undersecretary for international affairs , &quot; I don ' t think you can say we are without problems in the employment sphere. &quot; Meanwhile , a related phenomenon is causing increasing concern in the developed countries . It is broadly known as underemployment : highly trained workers toiling at jobs that require few of the skills they possess , and employees making_do in part-time or temporary positions paying considerably less than they once commanded . Viewed in this context , Administration officials argue , the international conference is needed to avoid go-it-alone policies that could send living standards into a collective downward spiral as individual nations try to take market share away from each other . Still , the United States is not Europe is not Japan . Conditions in each place are different . Embattled political_leaders agree that they share a common problem , but they have been unable to identify acceptable joint solutions . A strategy that could cause economic hardship on one continent might not on another ; similarly , a remedy that could solve a problem on one side of the Atlantic might not work_on the other . For example , political and social traditions that shape worker benefits in industrial France -- free child_care and lengthy vacations , sickness pay and comprehensive health_care -- have no history or little political weight in rust-belt Detroit . The conference will be attended by economics , finance and labor ministers from the Group of Seven industrial nations : the United States , Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy and Japan . One key objective is to help political_leaders determine the extent to which their unemployment problems are &quot; cyclical &quot; or &quot; structural &quot; in nature . Cyclical problems are linked to the inevitable economic ebb and flow of recession and growth . While they cause real pain , history shows that relief will come_with the next recovery . Structural problems , which appear to be increasing in scope , are attributable to fundamental , long-term trends that may be irreversible . Examples include the changes wrought by technology , permanent work_force reductions designed to increase efficiency , ineffective education and training_programs , the consequences of generous social programs and job creation disincentives such_as high minimum_wages and restrictions on firing workers . Officials responsible_for setting policy and spending priorities hope to hear what is working in other nations -- and perhaps what is not -- as they seek to create jobs in industrialized societies facing stiff competition from low-wage , low-skill developing nations . Administration officials say the conference will seek to address several crucial questions : * What has allowed the United States to race so far ahead of Europe and Japan in the recovery from the global recession that began in 1991 ? * Can Europe cut_back its expensive social_welfare programs without courting the sort of political upheaval that few elected officeholders can withstand ? * Can the industrialized nations stitch together a comprehensive social safety net without overburdening businesses and individual taxpayers ? * Can Western nations and Japan increase international trade without triggering a protectionist backlash from vulnerable workers , companies and communities ? * Have technological advances and global competition permanently widened the wage differential between low-skilled and high-skilled jobs ? While Administration officials have high hopes for the conference , some economists doubt that it will produce tangible results . A high-profile meeting such_as the Detroit conference , said Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Rudi Dornbusch , &quot; makes everybody stand_up and look good because they are concerned about unemployment. &quot; &quot; They ' ll say you have to reform , and be socially concerned and responsible in doing that , and the only way_out is training , &quot; Dornbusch said . &quot; But that anything should come_out of it is a joke. &quot; Indeed , senior Administration officials agree that the deliberations are unlikely to produce a &quot; grand global initiative , &quot; observed Summers , adding : &quot; This is not a conference that will produce an immediate take-home ( benefit ) for the unemployed auto worker in Detroit. &quot; The skeptics say there is little likelihood that Europe will be willing to undergo the radical upheaval that conceivably could shake it out of its economic torpor . An effective solution , they say , would require drastic changes in a hidebound social_welfare system , a rigid workplace imposed by powerful labor_unions and an inefficient investment structure that tends to deny capital to the small businesses that could create the most new jobs . For the United States , finding answers to the conference ' s central questions is more_than just an altruistic exercise aimed at improving the plight of European workers . In the increasingly interconnected global economy , a thriving Europe is not just a competitor for U.S. businesses . It is a market . * RELATED STORY : D1 The Workplace According to Reich On the eve of the Clinton_Administration ' s international jobs conference in Detroit , U.S. Labor_Secretary and economics author Robert Reich offered his assessment of the underlying trends affecting employment in the United States , Europe and Japan : &quot; Not too many years ago , the conventional wisdom was that Europe and Japan did_it all_right and the United States did_it all wrong , and everything that could be learned , we could learn from them and , indeed , they had nothing to learn from us . Now , the new conventional wisdom is just the opposite : We ' re doing everything right , and Europe and Japan are doing everything wrong . &quot; Neither of those positions is correct . . . . There ' s a great_deal to learn from one another . Their job growth has not been very healthy , although those who have jobs have seen wage increases of very healthy proportions . The United States is almost the mirror_image . Over the past 15 years , we ' ve created a lot of new jobs , but . . . a majority of Americans have seen their wages stagnate or decline and many of their benefits disappear . &quot; The underlying question is : Are we condemned to choose between these two alternatives , neither of which is very appealing : either more jobs but declining real incomes and ( a ) widening gap between rich and poor , or fewer ( but ) better jobs with a bigger and bigger social safety net catching more and more people ? &quot; There may be another alternative . . . . Some would say that in Europe and Japan they ' ve done a much better job bringing the bottom two-thirds of their populations up_to a high minimal level of competence in education and training and skills . Some would say that in the United States , our great strength is our labor_market mobility , the dynamism and change that our markets allow. &quot;</TEXT>
