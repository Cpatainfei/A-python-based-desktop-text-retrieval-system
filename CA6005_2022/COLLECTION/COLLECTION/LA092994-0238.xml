   <TEXT> When the leaders of the world ' s two nuclear superpowers got_together and agreed on as much as Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin and President Clinton did Wednesday , the outlines of the New Order seemed to emerge from the post-Cold War fog . It is a world order in which , in sharpest contrast with the old days , Russia and the United States consult closely on everything from obscure conflicts to nuclear stockpiles . Their leaders come_to summits ready to discuss anything and everything . It is a world moving away from military blocs such_as the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization and toward open discussion clubs such_as the United Nations . And it could be a world where nuclear arsenals have been so drastically cut that the superpowers can switch to defensive nuclear arms and can finally lay to rest the nerve-racking doctrine of mutually assured destruction . In short , the world could be a safer place . On Wednesday , Yeltsin and Clinton emphasized that they respect the rights of other nations . But the summit buddies -- both tall , beefy and folksy -- almost sounded like co-presidents of the world . Yeltsin reeled_off a list of items the two leaders had harmoniously discussed that included such bones of cooperation as the environment , military doctrines and space exploration . But the style of the summit went beyond consultations ; it seemed to be a Russo-American brainstorming session on the world ' s problems . &quot; The idea is worked_out jointly , &quot; Yeltsin spokesman Anatoly Krasikov said of the presidents ' approach to resolving the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh . &quot; It ' s not that Russia says , ' I think this. ' They work together. &quot; The two leaders appear to have worked together , in part , on developing the vague ideas Yeltsin broached in his United Nations speech on Monday about moving toward some kind of new global security design , some organization that could replace NATO . Russia ' s interest in liquidating the alliance contradicts the American line that NATO should rather expand to include would-be members in Eastern Europe . But whether the alliance eventually grows to include Russia or evolves into something new , either way , the military bloc system is over . &quot; I ' m personally convinced that the time of NATO is passing , because NATO is the concrete product of an absolutely concrete , specific epoch , the epoch of confrontation , &quot; Krasikov said . &quot; Now some new structures should be created -- which ones , I don ' t know . I think no one knows. &quot; The era of mutually assured destruction may be passing too . The Cold_War doctrine held that this is the best way to prevent nuclear war : Each side should maintain such weak defenses against nuclear attack that it can never launch a first strike , because it would be devastated by even a weak retaliation . Now , in both the Clinton and the Yeltsin administrations , talk is mounting of new thinking that could allow the superpowers to put_up nuclear shields , at least enough to defend themselves from terrorists ' bombs . Yeltsin openly relished the announcement that he and Clinton had begun talk_of a &quot; START-III , &quot; a follow-on to the two arms agreements that cut the superpowers ' arsenals by about two-thirds . Their summit agreement to speed_up the dismantling of the missiles cut under START II -- after it is passed_by lawmakers in both countries -- showed what impatience they feel about the prospect of moving the world toward nuclear tranquillity . &quot; This way , we economize seven or eight years and give humanity the hope that our people will probably live_in peace , &quot; Yeltsin said . Judging by the atmosphere at the summit , Cold_War graduates are already living_in peace . American officials described an amazingly informal mood in which Yeltsin stripped to his shirt sleeves for some of his long chats with Clinton , leaning his elbows on the table and addressing questions directly to U.S. Cabinet members , as well as_to the President . In the old days , Krasikov recalled , everything would be worked_out &quot; to the last comma , &quot; and the leaders would sometimes sign documents without even knowing what they were signing . Russian and American views differ on lifting the arms embargo in Bosnia-Herzegovina , on whether Russia should have a &quot; sphere_of_influence &quot; in the former Soviet_Union , on arms sales to Iran and other issues . But by the end of the summit Wednesday , Yeltsin could say : &quot; We agreed on practically all questions . There were some compromises from the United States , some compromises from the Russian side , but for peace , humanity and our Earth , we agreed. &quot;</TEXT>
