   <HEADLINE> RISING LEVIES TAX RUSSIANS ' PATIENCE ; ECONOMY : ASSESSMENTS CLIMB DAILY AND WITHOUT WARNING . GOVERNMENT AIMS TO OFFSET DEFICIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Russian businessman goes_to Latvia for what he thinks is a good buy -- a 1991 BMW for $ 7 # 000 . But before he can drive it back to Russia , the government raises import taxes , adding $ 6 # 000 to the price . &quot; They robbed me , &quot; he says . The same surprise tax increase strands 200 Mercedes-Benz limousines in Germany because the city of Moscow , which ordered them for its beleaguered ambulance service , cannot fork over the extra duties . Settling in Moscow , an American oil executive is shocked to learn of a new 63 % tax on overseas household shipments . To retrieve his belongings , he must change $ 11 # 000 into rubles and empty his bulging pockets at the customs office . Taxes here seem to rise daily , without warning , as the Russian government slashes away at a $ 36-billion budget_deficit . Reluctant to cut deeper into subsidies for money-losing enterprises and face the anger of unemployed masses , authorities have instead provoked the ire of taxpayers . The struggle over who gets taxed and who gets subsidized is moving to center stage in Russia -- and intensifying . Under an agreement last week with the International Monetary Fund , President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s government has until April 15 -- a deadline familiar to American taxpayers -- to design new levies that will reduce the budget_deficit by half . U.S. Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown weighed in on the_matter Monday , calling recent increases of_import duties &quot; an impediment to economic_growth in Russia &quot; and trade with America . Arriving here with 28 American executives on a weeklong trade mission , Brown also urged the Russians to reconsider a $ 5-a-barrel tax on exported oil that has soured many_a deal with foreign prospectors . &quot; I think it is unrealistic to expect people to come and do business if tax regimes change frequently , &quot; he said . The conflicting pressures over taxes will determine not only how much free_trade and foreign investment Russia gets but also whether it collects a promised $ 1.5-billion IMF loan that would unlock new aid from the West . Since launching Western-style economic reforms in 1992 , Russia has laid a growing tax burden on its people . The value-added sales tax is 23 % . The tax on personal_income is 30 % of anything earned over $ 2 # 850 a year . Employers pay the Treasury an additional 39 % of their total payroll . If a company manages a profit , the government can take_up to 38 % of it . Duties on most imports have doubled in recent weeks . There is now a 15 % tax on all imported food , most of which had been exempt , and a 20 % tax on imported sugar . Then comes a host of local taxes , levied as Russia ' s cities and regions gain more autonomy . In Moscow , property_taxes have tripled this year and businesses are subject_to 50 other taxes , including one for every stock_exchange transaction . &quot; In such a system , &quot; Yeltsin admitted last month , &quot; any enterprise or entrepreneur can honestly only die. &quot; But he added , &quot; To gather everything that belongs_to the state is also impossible. &quot; Last year , the Russians collected only about two-thirds of the budget revenues they should have . Lashed by a storm of protest over import_duties as he vacationed by the Black_Sea , Yeltsin returned to Moscow on Sunday promising to review them . One looming fight is over imported food . The 15 % tax was imposed to protect Russia ' s unreformed agro-industrial complex and has been resisted by big-city mayors who fear it will cut food supplies and drive_up prices . As the government ' s draft 1994 budget undergoes parliamentary hearings , a parallel struggle is under way over spending . Officials responsible_for defense , farming , science , education , culture and the environment have predicted ruin for their respective domains if such a tight budget passes . In talks with the IMF last week , Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin agreed to hold spending to the equivalent of $ 107 billion -- as laid_out in his proposed budget -- and to limit deficit financing to the IMF target of 5 % of gross_domestic_product , or about $ 18 billion . He promised to make_up the rest of the expected deficit -- another $ 18 billion -- with more new taxes and better tax_collection . This is a daunting task . Even while accepting the Russian plan , IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus noted that the efficiency of Russia ' s State Taxation Service &quot; is declining rapidly. &quot; Indeed , tax_collection is not what it was here 600 years ago when the Mongol Golden Horde ruled by pillage , or two centuries ago when Peter the Great taxed everything from beards to kitchen chimneys . Tax_evasion is_on the rise , and so is organized crime . &quot; Our premises are bombed , our personnel sustain serious bodily injuries and their property is destroyed , &quot; Vladimir V . Gusev , head of the Taxation Service , told reporters recently . The government has created a Tax Police_force to give tax_collectors muscle . Last year , the Tax Police helped disclose 32 # 000 violations , charged 617 taxpayers with crimes and convicted 59 ; that , however , yielded less than 2 % of the total tax_revenues . While Economy Minister Alexander N . Shokhin defends new import_duties as &quot; a difficult compromise between consumers ' and producers ' interests , &quot; critics here and abroad say the duties will kill incentives for Russian businesses to modernize and compete in the world market . &quot; The taxation yoke has reached its limit , and I don ' t imagine it can be tightened any further without dangerous and unpredictable consequences , &quot; said Russian economist Gennady S . Lisichkin .</TEXT>
