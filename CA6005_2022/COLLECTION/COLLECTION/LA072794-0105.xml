   <HEADLINE> DOUBT CAST ON FAA ' S HANDLING OF 757 DATA ; AVIATION : REPORT SUGGESTS THAT AGENCY , LACKING PROPER PROCEDURES , ACTED TARDILY ON AIRLINER ' S WAKE TURBULENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Federal Aviation Administration may have mishandled reports on turbulence problems associated with Boeing 757 airliners because it doesn ' t have the proper procedures to ensure that safety concerns are acted_upon in a timely fashion , according to a federal report released Tuesday . The 46-page report , a joint effort by the FAA and the Department_of_Transportation , concluded that some officials within the FAA believe the agency could have acted sooner in taking steps designed to prevent accidents caused by wake turbulence from Boeing 757s . Others in the agency , however , do not share that view , the report said . Aside from the conflicting views on whether the agency mishandled the issue of 757 wake turbulence -- a phenomenon that has been linked two fatal airplane crashes -- the panel assembled by U.S. Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena and FAA Administrator David R . Hinson found a &quot; consensus &quot; within the FAA that the agency ' s ability to spot potential safety threats and take appropriate action is lacking . &quot; The B-757 wake vortex episode should serve as a wake-up call to the FAA to re-examine its processes for addressing emerging safety issues promptly and effectively , &quot; wrote the two officials who headed the review team , DOT general counsel Stephen H . Kaplan and FAA Deputy Administrator Linda Hall Daschle . Historically , the FAA has been criticized for being slow to act_on safety issues . While the report maintained that the FAA has an &quot; unparalleled &quot; safety record , it sent a clear message -- as well as a list of recommendations -- to Hinson and Pena that the agency could do_better . Daschle said during a discussion of the report that bureaucracy and a lack of leadership and &quot; clout &quot; have compromised the efficacy of the Office of Aviation Safety , whose job it is to identify , analyze and otherwise call attention to safety-related issues . Pena and Hinson ordered the review in mid-June after a series of reports in The Times indicated that the FAA knew about the potential danger of 757 wake turbulence long before two crashes that claimed 13 lives . Caused by the rapid movement of air across aircraft wings , wake turbulence amounts to a pair of &quot; horizontal tornadoes &quot; emanating from each wingtip . Although aviation experts disagree on the level of danger , some believe that the sleek wing and body design of the fuel-efficient 757 can cause wake turbulence that is more powerful and lasts longer than turbulence from other aircraft of comparable size . Relying_on FAA internal documents and aviation safety sources , The Times reported June 5 that the FAA ' s top scientist , Robert E . Machol , repeatedly expressed concern about 757 wake turbulence and warned in December , 1992 , that it could be lethal and might cause a &quot; major crash &quot; if the agency failed to act . Eleven days after Machol ' s prediction , a crash did occur on Dec . 18 , 1992 , in Billings , Mont. , killing eight people . Then in December , 1993 , five people died in Santa Ana after a corporate jet encountered the wake turbulence from a 757 on approach to John Wayne Airport and crashed . Among those killed were the top two executives of the In-N-Out Burger chain . Reacting to recommendations made in February by the National Transportation Safety Board , the FAA instituted a new set of policies governing smaller planes landing and taking_off behind 757s , including an extra mile of spacing on final approach . The agency has also embarked_on an aggressive program to educate pilots and air traffic controllers about the potential 757 wake turbulence hazard . A congressional subcommittee is scheduled to take_up the specific issue of whether the FAA tarried too long before acting_on 757 wake turbulence concerns , as well as the general topic of whether the people who detect potential safety problems within the FAA communicate effectively with the agency ' s policy and decision_makers . In its report , the FAA and DOT were unwavering in their opinion that nothing the FAA could have done would have prevented the Billings crash . Safety investigators have concluded that the pilot in the Billings accident was operating under visual flight rules , meaning it was up_to him to maintain a safe distance behind the 757 he was tailing . Other aviation safety officials have suggested , however , that had the FAA called attention to the potential 757 turbulence hazard earlier , the Billings pilot might have been more prudent . Because the NTSB has not finished its investigation of the Santa Ana crash , the report did not speculate on whether the FAA ' s actions could have affected the incident . Like the pilot in the ill-fated Billings accident , the pilot in the Santa Ana crash was flying under visual flight rules . He , too , had inadvertently strayed too close to the 757 and dropped below the flight_path of the 757 , which made his smaller plane more susceptible to the wake turbulence . Though it did not draw a conclusion , the review panel found that some people within the FAA believe it &quot; would have been appropriate &quot; for the agency to have communicated what it knew about 757 wake turbulence much earlier than it did . Others told the panel that although the FAA had a fair amount of information on 757 wake turbulence as far back as 1990 , it was not definitive enough to prompt policy_changes or its dissemination to pilots . The panel recommended that the agency : * Review the role of the Office of Aviation Safety and create a more effective mechanism to address safety issues . The agency lacks &quot; a single organization , mechanism or entity &quot; that can identify potential safety problems , alert others within the agency and follow_up_on safety recommendations , the report said . * Take a more proactive approach when it comes_to communicating potential safety hazards to pilots , air traffic controllers or others in the industry . For example , while some within the agency considered reports from NASA ' s Aviation Safety Reporting System and the United Kingdom ' s Civil Aviation Authority -- both of which had red-flagged 757 wake turbulence before the accidents -- to be incomplete , the panel noted that &quot; a more careful consideration of this type of data might have raised the possibility &quot; that further action was &quot; merited. &quot; * Better define who is responsible_for what within the agency . In one instance , the panel said , two departments within the FAA each thought the other bore the responsibility for certain aspects of wake turbulence research . * Improve research and development , including that for wake turbulence . The panel found that although wake turbulence is considered a potentially deadly threat , the agency ' s wake turbulence program has suffered from inadequate funding , high turnover and unclear goals . From 1989 to 1993 , for example , the FAA spent more_than $ 11 million on wake turbulence research and had nothing useful to show for it , the panel concluded . * Improve communication between those within the FAA involved in day-to-day operations of the nation ' s airways and those who conduct research on safety issues . The panel found that recommendations from Machol , the agency ' s chief scientist who began singling_out 757 wake turbulence as a potential hazard in the late 1980s , were sometimes ignored or brushed_off by some officials who perceived him as &quot; a thorn in the side of engineers and program managers &quot; -- a not uncommon perception for someone whose job essentially amounts to quality_control . In a remarkable finding that suggests a troubling degree of pettiness inside the nation ' s air regulatory_agency , the report said , &quot; That it was Dr. Machol making these recommendations might have influenced the decision . . . not to take action. &quot; For his part , Machol , who retired recently from the FAA , said this week that he knew he was perceived as one who &quot; rattles chains , &quot; but that that was part of his job . * PUBLIC INFORMATION : FAA urged to overhaul handling of requests for data .
