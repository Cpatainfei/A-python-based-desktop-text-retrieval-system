   <HEADLINE> DEFIANT HAITI PICKS A NEW PRESIDENT ; CARIBBEAN : FLOUTING U.N. RESOLUTION , MILITARY RULERS AND RENEGADE LEGISLATORS CLAIM ELECTED LEADER ARISTIDE ABANDONED OFFICE . THE WHITE_HOUSE CONDEMNS THE MOVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In direct defiance of the United States and United Nations , Haitian military rulers and renegade legislators on Wednesday named a new government to replace exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and all but dared the international community to stop them . With army commander Raoul Cedras and other military_officers looking_on in the Parliament ' s main hall , Sen . Bernard Sansaricq , one of two rival presidents of the Haitian Senate , declared that Aristide , overthrown by a violent coup in September , 1991 , had abandoned his office and betrayed the country . They picked Supreme Court President Emile Jonassaint as president . In Washington , the White_House denounced the Haitian action , which Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers called , &quot; cynical , unconstitutional and illegal. &quot; &quot; We don ' t recognize that there is a vacancy &quot; in the Haitian presidency , Myers said , noting that the Clinton_Administration still considers Aristide to be Haiti ' s legitimate president . But Jonassaint ' s elevation raised a key question as_to what steps the international community might take next , including military intervention . And on this topic , officials in Washington on Wednesday took special pains to criticize a Times report Tuesday . The report , citing diplomatic sources , said the United States plans to send at least 600 heavily armed and protected troops to purge Haiti ' s military , even if a broader , tougher program of sanctions forces the Caribbean nation ' s military rulers from power . &quot; The story is wrong , &quot; Myers said . But she added that the President is not willing to rule_out the use of force . And Madeleine Albright , American ambassador to the United Nations , said that no matter what happens in Haiti , officials think that some kind of a U.N. force , with an American component , will eventually be needed in the country . She said on NBC ' s &quot; Today &quot; show that the Administration is doing &quot; contingency &quot; planning as it awaits the results , if any , of tough new sanctions against the military regime . Meantime , in Port-au-Prince , in a speech marked by bellowing attacks on the United States and the United Nations , Sansaricq said the new government would take_office immediately and serve until new elections are held later this year . As he spoke , four cannons were rolled onto the grounds of the Presidential Palace to fire a 21-gun salute . By naming the little-known , frail , 81-year-old Jonassaint as president , Sansaricq , who acted with Cedras ' support , openly defied the U.N. Security_Council . The council approved a resolution last Friday aimed at forcing Aristide ' s return with tough economic sanctions . That resolution &quot; condemns any attempt illegally to remove legal authority from the legitimately elected president ( and ) declares that it would consider illegitimate any purposed government resulting from such an attempt. &quot; Sansaricq called the resolution an &quot; invasion of national sovereignty &quot; and said Haiti will &quot; resist &quot; any effort by the United States to restore Aristide , including the use of military advisers and other troops as contemplated by President Clinton as part of an earlier agreement to reorganize and retrain Haiti ' s military and police . One diplomat here said the move Wednesday was &quot; the military ' s way of saying ' Take your best shot. ' &quot; The move was condemned by American officials and representatives of other nations . But beyond its symbolism , the naming of a new government has practical , potentially threatening aspects , most alarming among them the possibility that Jonassaint will order the U.N. Civil Mission , which monitors human_rights and represents the United Nations , to leave the country . Haitian Defiance The naming of the new president on Wednesday escalated the conflict between the Haitian regime and the international community . In Haiti , Sansaricq indicated he was dismissing the likelihood of an American military reaction by &quot; blessing &quot; public opposition to such a move from individuals such_as former President George_Bush , Senate Republican leader Bob Dole and former Secretary_of_State Henry A . Kissinger . Sansaricq -- who claims the Haitian Senate presidency based on a 1993 election that even the military in Haiti has acknowledged was fraudulent -- denounced the U.N. mission here . It is made_up of about 100 observers and administrative personnel . He called the U.N. mission illegal , saying the agreement permitting its presence is no longer valid . &quot; The international community , &quot; he said , &quot; wants to wipe us off the face of the earth . . . . May God spare us this vile and murderous pursuit of pseudo-democracy. &quot; In elevating Jonassaint , Sansaricq operated unilaterally and in violation of the constitution he claimed as justification for his decree ; neither chamber of the Parliament approved the action , as required . There was never even a legal vote , and the swearing-in was boycotted by the majority of the legislators . In New York , the U.N. Security_Council condemned what it called &quot; the attempt to replace the legitimate president of Haiti. &quot; In a statement read to the press by Ambassador Ibrahim A . Gambari of Nigeria , the council president this month , the 15 ambassadors reminded anyone taking_part in the new government that they will automatically fall_under special sanctions . Under the sanctions resolution passed last Friday , the Security_Council banned anyone taking_part in an illegal Haitian government from traveling outside the country or using any funds deposited in foreign bank_accounts . In Port-au-Prince , U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Shrager said Wednesday ' s events &quot; will not prevent nor delay &quot; the implementation of new , stringent economic sanctions . Neither , he said , will the United States be &quot; diverted from pursuing the restoration of democracy or the return of President Aristide to Haiti. &quot; But the question now , said one international official , is &quot; whether the U.N. would refuse to go and what it would do if the military_forced them out. &quot; Story Questioned In reacting negatively to The Times ' report on Haiti , Administration officials confirmed that Clinton is actively planning to send troops if the regime quits . And if it does not , the Administration has said it is considering unspecified military options . The Times ' report Wednesday , citing diplomats and American officials in Haiti , said the Administration would prefer to send the troops in after Haiti ' s military_leaders step_down but would also do so if the military remained in place . The only question remaining , The Times said , was the timing and ultimate size of the force . While Myers disputed The Times ' story , the White_House said the United States still plans to take_part in a U.N. military and police advisory group that would go_to Haiti after democracy was restored to train a new police_force , restructure the army and build roads . &quot; The use of force , the President is not willing to rule_out , &quot; Myers said . &quot; But I haven ' t heard discussed , and I can ' t imagine discussing , sending_in some kind of people to try to achieve a mission like that , &quot; she said of The Times ' report that the United States would consider a reform of the Haitian military even if the ruling regime does not step_down . At a photo opportunity , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry observed of The Times ' story : &quot; I read that report . I didn ' t recognize it as any plan we ' re working on. &quot; Pressed , however , to describe American options in the_matter , Perry said he could not discuss &quot; any of our contingency plans. &quot; Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said the Administration wants to assemble a multinational force , including American troops , to help &quot; train and professionalize the Haitian army. &quot; &quot; In our discussions , we ' re once again reviving that concept , in feeling the need for some military_forces there to try to ensure that the transition there is a peaceful and positive one , &quot; he told reporters at the State_Department . &quot; that ' s the kind of force that ' s being discussed at the present time. &quot; The Times ' story Wednesday quoted sources as saying that such a force would be called a U.N. military advisory group but , in reality , would be almost entirely an American operation because of the reluctance of other nations to participate . Refugee Quandary The U.S. Coast Guard on Wednesday was ordered to return to Port-au-Prince 14 Haitians who were intercepted off the coast of Florida last Friday . A total of 16 refugees were traveling in a 25-foot motorboat stopped about 60 miles east of Daytona Beach . A 4-year-old boy who was found near-dead from dehydration was airlifted off the patrol_boat Pea Island and transferred to a hospital in Orlando , Fla . His father , also aboard the boat , was later allowed to join him . The Haitians , believed to be longtime residents of the Bahamas , presented special problems for the Administration since last month the Bahamian government announced it would no longer accept the return of illegal immigrants , either Haitian or Cuban . At least some of the 14 Haitians still on the boat have been residents of the Bahamas for years , according to one reliable source . The 14 Haitians now are being held aboard the Coast Guard cutter Confidence , which has remained offshore for the last six days while a decision was being made on where to take them , according to Coast Guard Lt . Cmdr . James Howe in Miami . They are scheduled to reach Haiti on Friday . Times staff writers Doyle McManus in Washington and Stanley Meisler at the United Nations , and Times special correspondent Mike Clary in Miami , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
