   <HEADLINE> IMPOTENCE EASILY TREATED , PHYSICIANS SAY ; HEALTH : THE PROBLEM CAN BE A SIDE_EFFECT OF OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS . LANGUAGE_BARRIERS AND CULTURAL MORES OFTEN KEEP MEN FROM SEEKING HELP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With age and increasing prostate problems , Sam Brown noticed his sex_drive starting to decline . At first he ignored it . At 62 , he expected his urge for sex to drop . But he didn ' t expect the lack of desire to last for 12 years . &quot; I had written it off to age and my prostate problem , but I knew there was something more serious , so I went_to get checked_out , &quot; said Brown , now 74 , of South Los Angeles , who asked that his real first_name not be used . What Brown discovered was that his prostate problems led to impotence . Eddie Rodriguez of East Los Angeles never had trouble having_sex until circulatory problems left the East Los Angeles native impotent . &quot; I couldn ' t have_sex , &quot; Rodriguez said while looking_around to see if anyone could hear during an interview at a local hospital . &quot; It was embarrassing . I ' m only 22 and have problems with having sex. &quot; Although impotence crosses age and racial lines , it is becoming increasingly evident among men of color as other medical problems are discovered that contribute to impotence cases . For many , cultural mores and language_barriers often prohibit them from discussing the issue and lead to years of carrying a burden of inadequacy for a problem that doctors say is easily treatable . &quot; This isn ' t a new problem , but ( more men are seeking treatment as they ) become aware that it ' s curable and that they don ' t have to live five to 10 years with impotence before getting_it treated , &quot; said Dr. Miguel Martinez , a urologist at White Memorial Medical_Center . Impotence can result from physical or psychological problems , or both . The most common physical conditions linked to impotence include diabetes , vascular disease , hypertension , neurological_disorders and side_effects from prescription medications , such_as those used to treat high_blood_pressure , and illegal drugs . Cigarette smoking also can be a risk factor by worsening the effects of those other conditions . Psychological factors can include depression , anxiety and loss of self-esteem . Psychological causes of impotence are most often found in men younger than 50 who are not diabetic . Impotence from physical complications result more often in men over 50 . Impotence affects about 30 million mostly older_men in the United States , according to the American Urology Assn. , but no accurate figures exist because of inhibitions about discussing it . &quot; Most men who I ' ve met who have the problem are hesitant to talk_about it , even though I ' ll tell them about my problems with it , &quot; said Joseph , 65 , of Hawthorne , who had been impotent for about three years before being treated . Joseph asked that his last_name be withheld . The numbers are especially difficult to determine among ethnic and racial groups because of cultural biases and the dearth of studies on impotency ' s impact on minority males , according to the urology association . For men of color , a greater risk for impotence exists because of higher rates of diabetes , hypertension , heart_disease and prostate cancer , especially among African American men , who have a 30 % higher rate of diabetes or hypertension , Martinez said . These problems are additionally compounded by stress . Martinez said men of all ethnic_groups living_in low-income areas suffer from stress and a variety of health_problems that can lead to impotence . &quot; In the inner_city , with the more people you treat , you find_out that stress is more prominent than people realize &quot; in exacerbating the root causes of impotence , said Martinez , who treats several dozen Latino and black_men for the problem . Another problem recently discovered by urologists was that former prostate cancer patients were finding they could no longer have_sex after undergoing surgery . &quot; The prostate is very close to a series of nerves that are vital for erections , &quot; Martinez said . Doctors &quot; were cutting_off vital nerves . Now , they are aware and have formulated a different surgical_procedure which does not harm those nerves. &quot; Brown ' s problem was solved once he had surgery to correct difficulties with his prostate . Once a man has realized there is a problem , the next issue is getting him to talk_about it , doctors say . The stigma of impotence as being a sexual failure is still very common . Cultural mores , religion and family values also prevent patients from speaking more openly , doctors say . It is not uncommon for men to wait six months to two years or more before seeking help , Martinez said . By then their medical condition is sometimes compounded by psychological problems caused by frustration , he said . In some cases , to avoid embarrassment in seeing a doctor , Latino and Asian men will first go_to herbal healers . &quot; There are a lot more people with problems than we Asian urologists see , but culturally they feel better trying_for non-traditional medicine first to fix their problems , &quot; said Dr. Eun-chil Park , a Koreatown urologist . Most of the Asian men Park treats are over 65 and have been impotent for many years . Culturally , they consider it a part of_aging and do not seek help . Said Dr. Dominic Chu of Monterey Park : &quot; Many will take medication to get their potency back , but if it doesn ' t work , they forget it because they figure that ' s the way it is. &quot; Chu said he treats men in their 40s , but many men are impotent for years and do not mention it to their doctors until they are past 50 , when they blame the problem on age . Machismo is a major problem for some Latino patients , said Dr. David Sulam of Family Care Specialists in Highland Park . Some patients will seek help but give inaccurate information and try to avoid questions about their sexual dysfunction . Rodriguez , who works in construction , twice attempted to have his impotence problem solved at a hospital in Los Angeles . But when the medical staff asked him questions in front of a female staff_member , he lied . &quot; I told them I wasn ' t having as much sex as usual , &quot; Rodriguez said . &quot; But really , I couldn ' t have any sex at all. &quot; After finally visiting a urologist , Rodriguez realized he was suffering from poor circulation largely in part to a poor diet and excessive smoking . &quot; When I quit smoking , I felt different in less than a month , &quot; said Rodriguez , who is cured . &quot; I was a new man. &quot; Language_barriers and finding experienced medical workers who are bilingual are often problems in successful treatment for impotence for Asian and Latino men . Many cures for impotency are not complicated and some are fairly new , Martinez said . Treatment includes increasing the flow of blood to the penis with injections of drugs that dilate blood_vessels in the organ or an external vacuum_pump used to create an erection . Vascular surgery , another method used to increase blood flow , involves a bypass operation to route blood to the penis past blocked arteries . Penile prostheses , or implants , which can be rigid , malleable or inflatable , are also available for patients who refuse other forms . &quot; Once more men realize that this is a treatable problem and can be easily reversed , I think we ' ll begin to see more people breaking those cultural barriers and getting some help , &quot; Martinez said .</TEXT>
