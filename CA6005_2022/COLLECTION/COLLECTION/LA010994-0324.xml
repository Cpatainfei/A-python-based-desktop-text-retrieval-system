   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CHINA ' S MOTIVES IN NORTH_KOREAN CRISIS DEBATED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is China helping the United States stop North_Korea from developing nuclear_weapons ? Or , as some U.S. critics charge , is China using the North_Korean crisis for its own benefit , to demonstrate to the world its importance in Asia ? Over the past few months , as the Clinton_Administration has strived to scuttle a suspected North_Korean nuclear_weapons program , it has found that all roads to a solution lead through China . Not only does Beijing have veto power on the U.N. Security_Council , it would be the key nation in determining whether an economic embargo against North_Korea would work . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher has characterized China ' s role as vital in reaching a North_Korean settlement . Other senior Administration officials have acknowledged that the secret diplomatic contacts with and through Beijing have been &quot; intensive &quot; throughout the dispute . Yet if Beijing ' s role is important , it is also controversial , because some critics claim that China has been nursing along the North_Korean issue to gain diplomatic leverage over the United States and to show the Clinton_Administration how much it needs good relations with Beijing . &quot; China has played such an irresponsible and dangerous game on this , &quot; said Nicholas Eberstadt , a North_Korea specialist at the American Enterprise Institute . On the surface , at least , China ' s role is_full of contradictions . Chinese officials insist that they have little influence over North_Korean President Kim Il Sung -- and in political terms , that may be true . Yet in economic terms , China would appear to have considerable leverage . According to South_Korean statistics , North_Korea obtained 75 % of its grain , 72 % of its crude_oil and 88 % of its coking coal from China in 1992 . In its public statements , China regularly says that it does not want North_Korea to obtain nuclear_weapons . Beijing does not relish the idea of an unpredictable new nuclear_power on its borders , and it fears such an emergence could prompt South_Korea and Japan to counter with their own nuclear_weapons programs . Clinton_Administration officials and independent analysts believe China ' s opposition is sincere . But Beijing also has repeatedly opposed any economic embargo that would apply pressure on Pyongyang . &quot; The operational question is , what would China do to prevent North_Korea from obtaining nuclear_weapons ? &quot; one U.S. official said . &quot; The answer is , not much. &quot; China ' s importance in arranging a North_Korean settlement poses awkward , indeed scary , dilemmas for U.S. policy-makers , problems that have been quietly debated in Washington for months . &quot; If you go_with an embargo ( against North_Korea ) , you would have to get the Chinese to go_along , &quot; said Rep . Gary L . Ackerman ( D-N.Y. ) , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia . &quot; But there would be a price to pay . The Chinese would not do this for free . Do we want to be bound to look the other way on human_rights and most-favored-nation ( trade status ) for China ? Or , alternatively , if the United States did this ( embargo ) without the Chinese , what if the Chinese decided to ship oil through a naval_blockade ? Would we sink a Chinese ship ? &quot; During the Korean_War and for decades after that , Chinese officials used the same graphic expression to characterize their relationship with North_Korea : The two countries , they said , were as close as &quot; lips and teeth. &quot; But even in its best days , the alliance between Beijing and Pyongyang was never really that solid . Kim , the North_Korean leader , was extremely adept at playing China against the Soviet_Union . And recently , since the Soviet_Union ' s collapse , ties between Beijing and Pyongyang have deteriorated . To North_Korea ' s irritation , China began asking_for cash payments at market_prices for oil and other products . The change in policy hurt the already impoverished North_Korean economy . Even worse , in North_Korea ' s view , China established diplomatic relations with South_Korea , Pyongyang ' s perennial enemy . In a 1990 trip to the Chinese city of Shenyang in Manchuria , Kim reportedly met in secret with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in a frosty , unsuccessful effort to head_off normalization between Beijing and Seoul . A Chinese official in Beijing contended last week that China was not and should not be &quot; directly involved &quot; in the North_Korean nuclear dispute . Still , he said , China has &quot; repeatedly made use of every opportunity and channel &quot; over the past year to tell North_Korea that it should not develop nuclear_weapons . &quot; We would not support the emergence of nuclear_weapons on the Korean_peninsula , &quot; the official said . &quot; But to be honest with you , China does not know whether they have the nuclear bomb or not. &quot; Still , the Chinese official argued against international efforts to impose an embargo on North_Korea . &quot; I ' ve had a lot of contact with the Koreans , &quot; he said . &quot; They want very much to sit together with the big powers on an equal footing . If dialogue is_on an unequal footing or sanctions are tried , it would obviously result in hurting their national pride , and this is something they would not accept. &quot; Beijing appears to be remarkably content to let the United States carry_out negotiations with North_Korea , thus having America play the lead role in what is supposed to be China ' s main sphere_of_influence . Richard Bush , a Democratic congressional staff_member who specializes in Asian affairs , suggested that China may be letting the United States take the lead with North_Korea for now , realizing that the tough job of persuasion or pressure may fall to China later on . &quot; The possibility or probability that China might abstain on a sanctions resolution has influence over North_Korea , &quot; Bush said . &quot; That would represent repudiation of them ( North_Korea ) on a global basis , even by those who were their friends , and would render them totally isolated in the eyes of the world. &quot; In Washington , senior Clinton_Administration officials emphasize that in private talks , China has not ruled_out the possibility of supporting an economic embargo against North_Korea in the future . &quot; This is , right now , a hypothetical issue , and we have not pressed them to make a decision on a hypothetical , &quot; a top Administration policy-maker said . Still , some Administration critics , including former officials of the George_Bush Administration , say that the United States should be pressing China harder to support an embargo or other tough measures against North_Korea . &quot; It ' s time for us to push them ( China ) , &quot; said James R . Lilley , who served as U.S. ambassador to Beijing and later as a top Pentagon official under Bush . &quot; You ' ve got_to get the Chinese in a position where they lose more_than they gain . If China doesn ' t play ball , you ' ve got_to look_at the possibility of limiting the transfer of high_technology to China or of having Japan cut_back on soft loans to China. &quot; That sort of pressure from the West is exactly what China is trying to avoid . &quot; We don ' t want to get caught in the middle of this , &quot; said a Chinese official working outside China . &quot; When we established relations with South_Korea , what could the North_Koreans do except scream at us ? This dispute isn ' t like that . These ( nuclear installations ) are facilities on_their_own territory . What are we supposed to do , go_in there ( and remove them ) ? &quot; Over the past six months , the need for China ' s help in the North_Korean nuclear dispute has become the top priority for the Administration as it seeks to improve troubled U.S. relations with Beijing . Human_rights advocates worry that the North_Korean issue could cause the Administration to hold_back on its criticisms of repression in China . But a senior Administration official said China has never tried directly to get concessions from the United States in exchange for its assistance in stopping the North_Korean nuclear program . &quot; There is not the faintest indication that they ( China ) are using this issue for leverage over us , &quot; the official said .
