   <HEADLINE> DISASTER POLITICS ; THE CHARADE OF PREPAREDNESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How many_more Californians will have to die before the Legislature seriously debates seismic safety ? Last Monday ' s earthquake has a political as well as a tectonic history . If nature defines the hazard , it is human_action -- or inaction -- that translates it into risk . People , after all , are seldom swallowed_up by the Earth , they are usually killed by falling architecture . Design mediates geology and is , in turn , supposedly regulated by policy . But who determines what are the socially &quot; acceptable &quot; levels of earthquake risk ? Certainly not the folks who live_in $ 600-a-month apartments in Northridge or trailer_parks in Newhall . Not even those whose million-dollar homes perch precariously on the slopes of the Santa Monicas or the Palisades . In California , seismic safety is an issue superbly insulated from the volatility of democratic politics . Few of us have ever heard a candidate take a position on disaster planning or the contents of a building_code . None of us has ever had the opportunity to vote on the trade-offs between public safety and the economic costs of hazard reduction . What should be an open arena of public controversy is , in fact , a closed circle of collusion between technocrats and the real-estate industry . Earthquake engineering and land-use planning pay homage , first and above all , to corporate bottom_lines . Developers have the majority vote -- if not a de_facto vote -- over the_calculus of risks and expenses . Lives are literally balanced against rates of return in equations that radically underestimate the restlessness of the Pacific plate . But what of official reassurances that California is the &quot; state_of_the_art &quot; in comprehensive planning for earthquake survival ? Our elected representatives , perhaps unwittingly , are living a lie . For every mitigation achieved , public policy has also allowed an unnecessary magnification of a danger . Consider the four crucial areas of hazard zoning , the building_code , disaster education and emergency mobilization . First of all , local and state_governments have utterly failed to manage land use for public safety . Sixty years ago , the nation ' s leading expert on urban form , Frederick Law Olmsted Jr . ( whose father designed Central_Park ) , urged Los Angeles to adopt &quot; hazard zoning &quot; to prevent the private development of foothills , river channels and wetlands . Recognizing that our landscape evolves through an inevitable cycle of fire , flood and earthquake , he proposed to minimize public risk while simultaneously preserving precious open space for future generations . Instead of following Olmsted ' s advice , we have foolishly subdivided hither and yon -- placing thousands of combustible wooden homes_in the hearth of mountain wildfires , and hundreds of flimsy concrete boxes_in the unstable beds of former swamps and lagoons . Like the San Francisco Bay Area ( remember the Marina District in 1989 ? ) , a large swathe of Los Angeles is built_on foundations of jello . The Times could render a public_service simply by publishing the official &quot; liquefaction potential &quot; map of the L.A. area . Second , the seismic provisions of the Uniform Building_Code have been minimalist , grudging concessions to catastrophe . The bureaucracy usually waits until a building type fails in a major earthquake before legislating new rules . Reform is driven by body_counts . Thus , scores of public_schools had to be reduced to rubble in the 1933 Long_Beach earthquake ( 120 dead ) before Sacramento imposed any restrictions on their construction . Similarly , Los Angeles procrastinated until slab-concrete warehouses , a shopping_center and two hospitals collapsed in the 1971 Sylmar disaster ( 64 dead ) before addressing elementary deficiencies in their design . Some have argued that such grim &quot; report_cards &quot; are unfortunate prerequisites to understanding the rules of safe construction . This is nonsense . It does not take a Cal Tech degree , for example , to understand that homes or apartments constructed over garages ( like many in the Valley ) have little shear resistance to shaking . This was a major category of structural failure during the Loma Prieta earthquake , and it should have been anticipated in Southern California as well . Speculative building types , by definition , play chicken with seismic forces , and Los Angeles has its structural counter-parts to the killer mud huts of Third_World cities . Was it really so difficult to foresee that shoddily built tenements of all ages -- from the brick rent-mines of Hollywood to that stucco deathtrap in Northridge -- would fall like dominoes in last week ' s quake ? Third , the public has been badly misinformed about the diversity of earthquake hazards in the Los Angeles Basin . The disaster bureaucracy has mesmerized us with its apocalyptic focus_on the Big One , rather than providing detailed hazard maps to the faults in our own back yards . If the current tragedy has finally produced a televised teach-in about the treacherous jigsaw of deeply buried thrust_faults , we still only know half the bad news . According to the California Division of Mines , the single greatest geological threat to the Los Angeles Basin is a repeat of the 1933 earthquake along the Newport-Inglewood fault zone that passes directly through the Harbor and most of South-Central Los Angeles . A companion study by the Federal Emergency Management Agency predicts as_many as 23 # 000 dead and $ 69 billion in property damage : &quot; The worst disaster in the United States since the Civil War. &quot; If we were_better informed about these close-at-hand hazards , we might be more impelled to take grass-roots action to safeguard our homes , schools and workplaces . But -- my fourth point -- our current disaster-management system is designed to reduce us to role of passive victims waiting to be dug_out of the rubble . Our sole responsibility is to hoard toilet_paper and bottled water . But if tens of thousands of citizens can be mobilized on a block level as Neighborhood Watches against crime , why can ' t they be organized as a pro-active network for disaster response ? would n ' t it be a good idea to have neighborhood volunteers who know where the senior_citizens live and how to turn_off the gas_mains ? To help translate live-saving instructions into Armenian or Korean ? Naive questions perhaps . It is inevitable that people taking an active role in their own safety will learn more about the details of the problem . And that might lead to a critical view of official policy . From there , it is only a short leap to political dissent and public_debate -- what the system seems to dread most . But it is a leap we may all have to make . At another hour , on a normal business day , last week ' s casualties might easily have been multiplied a hundredfold . Moreover , the Northridge earthquake has had an unexpected , leveling effect on our divided city . For the emergent paradigm of the Cal Tech professors makes us all more equal . Although it still does matter whether you dwell in a dingbat or a mansion , everywhere in Los Angeles -- Watts to Beverly Hills -- is now , potentially , epicentral .</TEXT>
