   <HEADLINE> DEADLY REALITY : RWANDA IS DYING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The body_count has climbed past 100 # 000 in Rwanda with no end of killing in_sight . The corpses pile_up on land ; mutilated bodies float down rivers . Half a_million refugees are fleeing the latest round of mass_murder by the Hutu and Tutsi tribes . There can be no doubt that this is a crisis demanding strong outside intervention . In the wake of the United Nations ' expensive effort in Somalia and numerous on-going peacekeeping operations , an all-African peacekeeping force with U.N. support may be the only politically palatable response to this tribal war . Mounting such a force won ' t be easy because the Organization of African Unity prohibits meddling in the affairs of its members . The challenge is also complicated because one of Rwanda ' s neighbors , Uganda , a logical source of troops , already has taken sides . But there is a precedent for the kind of peacekeeping force that ' s needed -- Liberia . When the world ignored massacres in Liberia , the Economic Community of West_African States ( ECOWAS ) organized a regional peacekeeping force to intervene . For three years the troops , led by Nigerians , have patrolled the area around Monrovia , sometimes engaging rebel fighters . The perseverance of these peacekeepers has paid_off with negotiations and plans for an election . Neutrality was an issue in Liberia ' s civil_war too . Charles Taylor , the rebel leader , questioned the neutrality of Nigerian troops because their president had supported a political rival . In response to Taylor ' s concerns , the United Nations , the OAU and the United States helped to bring_in troops from Uganda and Tanzania . Rwanda needs similar help . The United Nations ought to find a way to provide it . U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has called_on Africans to provide troops for a peacekeeping force financed by Western countries . The Clinton_Administration , though against sending U.S. ground troops , is sending $ 15 million for humanitarian aid and would consider an airlift . So far , no African_nation has pledged troops . No one is safe today in Rwanda . Children and Red_Cross workers have been killed in an orphanage . Patients have been murdered in a hospital . Parents have been massacred in their homes . Diplomacy has failed . Intervention is in_order -- but Africans must take the lead .</TEXT>
