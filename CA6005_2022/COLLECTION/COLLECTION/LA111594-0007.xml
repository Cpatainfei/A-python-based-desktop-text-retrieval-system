   <HEADLINE> FREE_TRADE OR PROTECTIONISM ? ; AT SUMMIT OF PACIFIC NATIONS , that ' s THE QUESTION OF THE HOUR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the end of the Cold_War , the Clinton_Administration has tried to make U.S. economic interests the centerpiece of foreign_policy , at least in the Asia-Pacific region . That is smart , considering that Asia is the world ' s fastest-growing economic region and U.S. trade across the Pacific dwarfs its commerce with Europe . The second summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum , in Indonesia this week , has underlined the changing relationship of the United States with its Pacific trading partners . On Monday President Clinton won promises from China , Japan and South_Korea to keep pressure on North_Korea to not develop nuclear_weapons . Any reminder to Pyongyang of the forces arrayed against it on this vital issue is worthwhile . The Administration also said properly that it will raise the question of human_rights with China and Indonesia , but in private meetings . Clinton expressed sympathy for the students who scaled the fence of the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta and occupied the grounds to protest Indonesian policy in East Timor , annexed by Indonesia in 1976 . That was the right approach ; Indonesia ' s annexation of the former Portuguese colony has never been recognized by the United Nations . Although Washington cannot tell its partners what to do , neither must it shrink_from the championing of human_rights . Summit conferences with as_many participants as the APEC session by nature produce only promises of cooperation , vague timetables and rivers of rhetoric . And that is when they are successful . When things do not go well , we are treated to the kind of awkwardness that resulted at last year ' s APEC summit when Clinton met with China ' s president after being stonewalled on human_rights . Yet while the gathering of leaders of 18 nations , plus a plethora of aides , invariably demonstrates frictions as much as common interests , such face-to-face meetings are valuable . That is especially true when two or three heads of government break_away to meet privately . Last year ' s APEC summit opened in Seattle as Clinton was winning a cliffhanger victory for the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . He was able to appear as a leader capable of persuading followers of the benefits of free_trade . This year he appeared as a President trounced in last week ' s elections , and White_House aides conceded that the other leaders had searching questions about what that meant for their relations with Washington . That is a natural question , but the leaders of other democracies present in Jakarta know that their fortunes , too , can change at the polls . And even for the authoritarian regimes in China and Indonesia , with aging top officials , there are questions about what course future leaders will take -- among them free_trade or protectionism .</TEXT>
