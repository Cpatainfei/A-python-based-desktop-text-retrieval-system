   <HEADLINE> FORFEITURE LAW LIMITS SEIZURES BY POLICE ; DRUGS : MEASURE SIGNED BY GOV . WILSON WEAKENS THE RIGHTS OF NARCOTICS OFFICERS TO TAKE SUSPECTS ' PROPERTY AND TURN IT INTO CRIME-FIGHTING CASH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1989 , Simi Valley narcotics detectives seized $ 2.5 million from a Colombian money launderer and spent it on new officers , computers and high-tech detective gear . They won praise for turning drug profits into crime-fighting cash . Oxnard narcotics officers seized a whole city_block and several bank_accounts because one tenant was selling cocaine . But four years later they were forced to give nearly all_of it back because the innocent property_owners ' attorney protested the unfair seizure . Then in 1992 , Malibu rancher Donald Scott was shot to death in a fruitless drug raid on his property . Ventura County Dist . Atty . Michael D . Bradbury denounced the fatal raid as little more_than a botched land-grab under the asset-forfeiture law . As attitudes toward California ' s tough asset-forfeiture law changed , so did the law itself . It expired at the end of last year after failing to muster enough support for renewal . And on Friday , a new , weaker law -- forged as a compromise between supporters and critics of the old law -- was signed by Gov . Pete Wilson . Now the fat times for law_enforcement appear to be over . For nearly five years , Ventura County ' s police agencies had used the drug asset-forfeiture law to hire more personnel and buy better gear with the millions in cash and property they seized from suspected dope dealers . But when the tough 1989 law authored by Assemblyman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) expired Dec . 31 amid statewide criticism , it all but cut_off the windfall that had been fattening California ' s narcotics squads with seizures from the guilty and innocent alike . In its place stood a weaker 1988 forfeiture law written by Assemblyman Gary Condit ( D-Modesto ) , one that sharply limited such seizures and has left some forfeiture-fed programs starving for funds . Furthermore , the 1988 law became the subject of legal squabbles over whether it remained in_effect . The debate prompted Ventura County prosecutors to temporarily suspend the filing of seizure cases earlier this year . The compromise bill signed Friday by Gov . Wilson ensures law_enforcement has a way to seize drug profits , but includes protections for innocent people . Like the Condit law , the new law requires a criminal drug conviction for forfeiture . It also requires training and auditing for agencies involved and a pre-seizure hearing for each case . And it requires police to sell or dispose_of seized property rather than use it themselves . Police and prosecutors had praised the now-defunct Katz law as an effective , far-reaching weapon because no criminal conviction was needed to seize dealers ' profits . By taking_away houses , cars and bank_accounts , officers said they could shut_down drug rings -- even when they could not muster enough evidence to prove the dealer ' s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt . And in the biggest Ventura County seizure to date , Simi Valley police used $ 2.5 million in cash they seized in 1989 from Colombian drug-money launderer Otoniel Urrego to buy a half-million-dollar computer_system , enhance their DARE program and back countless undercover narcotics stings . * Yet the Katz law was also criticized for letting police abuse their power by taking cash and property from innocent people . In 1989 , Oxnard police seized an entire block of businesses and $ 270 # 000 in business accounts because one business tenant was convicted of possessing cocaine for_sale . It took four years for the innocent owners to reach an agreement with prosecutors to pay a settlement and win_back their property and their legitimately earned money , said their lawyer , David Patrick Callahan . And in the notorious drug raid on Donald P . Scott ' s Ventura County ranch near Malibu , Los Angeles County sheriff ' s deputies thought marijuana was being grown there and wanted to seize the property , concluded Dist . Atty . Michael D . Bradbury . Bradbury determined the Los Angeles County deputy shot the gun-wielding Scott in self-defense , but criticized the Los Angeles sheriff ' s motives in the case , saying the department was hungry for the 200-acre ranch . George Eskin , a veteran Ventura County defense_lawyer and former prosecutor , said : &quot; My problem with the law and with what was occurring before the old law died is that it invited law_enforcement misbehavior . There was an incentive to do a variety of things that were improper . . . . It turned them into bounty hunters. &quot; * The federal asset forfeiture law is even tougher than the Katz law . It allows agents to seize any property where there is merely probable_cause of drug involvement , while the Katz law set minimum amounts of drugs to qualify property for seizure . But federal forfeiture is pursued mostly in high-profile cases where the alleged drug crime violates federal law , leaving the vast majority of cases in California to state law . Meanwhile , law_enforcement officials say , Ventura County ' s drug dealers have grown steadily more careful . More are selling drugs out of rented cars and apartments rather than their own expensive sports_cars and lavish homes . And more are piping their profits into offshore bank_accounts , making the drug money harder to track and seize . &quot; There ' s been a significant drop-off there , and it ' s my impression from what I ' m hearing and what I see that we ' re not getting the big cases anymore , &quot; Chief Deputy Dist . Atty . Kevin McGee said . &quot; The big cases are falling_under federal law. &quot; Yet federal seizure cases cracked by state and local narcotics officers have not increased noticeably , said Assistant U.S. Atty . Eric Honig , chief of the Los Angeles asset forfeiture section . * &quot; We let ( state and county prosecutors ) know right from the beginning we would not accept any cases that would circumvent the intent of the state law , &quot; Honig said . &quot; If there ' s a violation of state law , there has to be a concurrent violation of federal law for us to take the case . . . . Generally , the minimum case we have involving currency is $ 10 # 000. &quot; And at a local level , the numbers paint_a_picture of dramatically shrinking seizures since the Katz law expired . From January to June in 1992 , the Ventura County district_attorney ' s office processed 74 seizure cases with a total value of $ 265 # 000 . In the same period this year , there were only 20 such cases filed , with a value of $ 70 # 000 , McGee said . For a police_department such_as Simi Valley ' s , the falloff in drug money seizures could mean a dramatic cutback in certain services -- or an increasing need to dip_into the city ' s general fund . Drug money has enriched the Simi Valley department to the tune of more_than $ 6 million in the past 10 years , allowing it to buy a new radio system , surveillance gear and a computer-aided dispatch system worth more_than half a_million . This fiscal_year , Simi Valley is paying the salaries of 10 employees , including five detectives and a records clerk , plus officers for DARE , anti-gang and in-school programs , using a special budget of $ 855 # 100 made_up entirely of seized drug profits . The fund also is paying a hefty cellular_phone bill for its narcotics detectives , officials said . Yet the department ' s asset-forfeiture bank_account , bolstered heavily by the $ 2.5-million seizure of Colombian drug money in 1989 , is close to running_dry . * Simi Valley Police_Chief Willard R . Schlieter said he is weighing ways to rework the budget and save the extra officers . &quot; They ' re really in kind of a vital position , &quot; he said recently . &quot; The assignments they ' re working right now provide some depth to our program . It ' s going_to be a challenge to deal with it. &quot; Oxnard narcotics officers have also seen their asset-forfeiture money dwindle by as much as 30 % this year from last year ' s take of about $ 80 # 000 , said Assistant Chief Tom Cady . The department has been spending the money on bulletproof_vests , wireless body microphones and even a voice mail system for the department . &quot; The intent of the law is for it to be used to enhance law_enforcement ' s ability in particular to respond to narcotics problems , &quot; Cady said . &quot; And as the funding sources get less and less . . . there ' s a concern that you could end_up supplanting ( seizure money ) with general fund money. &quot; Ventura County Sheriff ' s Department narcotics deputies also report a dramatic drop_in seizure cases , said Detective Michael Leslie . In 1992 , sheriff ' s deputies ' income from seized property was $ 94 # 000 , including 28 cars , in 28 separate cases , he said . In 1993 , it had fallen to $ 68 # 000 , with 26 cars in 32 cases . So far this year , deputies have seized property worth only $ 8 # 000 , including four cars . Staff cutbacks have contributed to the reduction , he said . But seizures also have fallen because of the expiration of the Katz law on New Year ' s Eve and the increasing shrewdness of drug dealers , who sell_out of apartments and rented cars more often now rather than risk having their own homes and vehicles seized . &quot; People are starting -- and this is the trend -- to get educated about what they use in these cases , &quot; Leslie added . * To be sure , state and federal seizure laws still provide some windfall to departments , particularly from the big , interagency cases . The Sheriff ' s Department , for instance , hopes to reap $ 2 million under the federal seizure law from a three-year , interstate undercover investigation into the Colombian Cali cocaine cartel that seized nearly 1 # 000 pounds of cocaine and $ 5.8 million in cash -- $ 1 million of it taken_in Thousand Oaks , said Sgt . Gary Pentis . And Oxnard , Ventura and Ventura County departments are hoping to share a chunk of $ 438 # 000 that was seized April 15 in a cocaine ring investigation with Inglewood police , said Oxnard Police Sgt . Mike Matlock . Meanwhile , the expiration of the Katz law has pleased some in the Ventura County criminal defense bar . Defense_attorney Eskin argued that the old law unjustly took assets from some who were never convicted -- and that it dropped an especially large hammer on some innocent suspects who could not afford to fight the seizures . &quot; I think a majority of the public feels that law_enforcement should not have the power to seize property in the absence of being able to establish the person ' s guilt , &quot; Eskin said . He recalled one client who had all $ 458 of his just-cashed paycheck seized when police found marijuana residue in the ashtray of his car . * &quot; That doesn ' t mean that there weren ' t also some legitimate cases that we would applaud -- I have no sympathy with a major drug dealer who loses his yacht or airplane to law_enforcement , &quot; Eskin said . &quot; But I ' m concerned about the little guys . . . . The government should not be coming around and taking property without due process. &quot; And defense_attorney David Callahan said the law was so tough that most seizures were &quot; just like taking candy from a baby. &quot; &quot; The whole idea of the forfeiture statute was to get these kingpins who make hundreds of thousands of dollars and put the money into palatial estates , speedboats and other trappings of leisure , and teach them that crime doesn ' t pay , &quot; Callahan said . In fact , he said , most Katz law cases involved low-income people arrested for selling drugs to support a habit , who wound_up losing their only cars and houses , leaving their families homeless and destitute . But law_enforcement officials argue that unless the law is strengthened again , the extra support narcotics investigations and other forfeiture-funded programs may continue to shrink . &quot; When they run_out of money , there ' s one group that ' s going_to suffer , and that ' s the public , &quot; said Sheriff ' s Cmdr . William Wade , whose major crimes unit oversees drug seizures and has in the past paid narcotics detectives with asset-forfeiture money . &quot; that ' s an avenue where the crooks are contributing to the enforcement action , &quot; he said . &quot; And by losing the forfeiture money , the agencies are either going_to have to draw funds from the general fund . . . or they ' re going to have to reduce their activity . Either way , the public loses. &quot;</TEXT>
