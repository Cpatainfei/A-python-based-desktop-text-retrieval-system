   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO ; WHOEVER WINS MUST SHARE POWER ; ENOUGH DISSENTING VOTES WILL BE CAST SUNDAY TO DEPRIVE ANY WINNER OF A MANDATE . A DEMOCRATIC RECONCILIATION IS CRITICAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Grupo San Angel , the 70 or so reformers from across Mexico ' s political spectrum , felt from the outset that the country ' s real problems would start to emerge only after next Sunday ' s election , and only then could the country ' s democratic transition begin . So far , the group ' s main achievement since its inception in early June lies perhaps in its contribution to laying_out a post-electoral agenda that attempts to go beyond the mistrust that has become pervasive in the electorate . The winner of the presidential election will probably receive around 40 % of the vote_in a three-way race with no run-off . At least one of the two losers will almost certainly question the fairness of the process ; the armed groups in Chiapas and elsewhere in the country will do the same . Moreover , all_of this will occur in a country lacking a democratic electoral tradition and deeply divided over just about every imaginable issue . Hence the question of governability : Who will govern the nation under these circumstances , and how will it be governed ? The answer , according to the group , lies_in the the winner of the election making a commitment to assemble a government of national concord , whose composition and platform would truly reflect the exceptional conditions Mexico finds itself in today . That government ' s program should stress two basic goals : profound , substantive political reform , and the type of social reform that a country with Mexico ' s gaping inequalities is clamoring for . In a sense , what the group is saying is that whoever wins the election , the actual political outcome should be pretty much the same . As Carlos Fuentes , a founding member of the group , put it , Mexico might end_up with a lousy president but a good government doing the right thing . On all_of these points , Grupo San Angel agrees . On a more specific blueprint for the future , and what actually will happen on Sunday , it is appropriate to comment on some of the ideas that are shared by many members of the group but are not yet part of the consensus it has built . Many in the group believe that Mexico ' s next government should rest_on a power-sharing agreement that includes the three main political_parties , the business_sector , the intellectual community , the non-governmental organizations and the grass-roots social movement that has sprung_up in recent years . In addition to this move toward democratization , the government should implement a program that sets_forth those economic and social_policies that must remain more or less the same , albeit with significant adjustments , such_as the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , trade liberalization , privatization and foreign investment , and those that must change : Raise taxes on the wealthy , improve income distribution , increase social spending and expenditures on infrastructure , and make_it possible for workers to fight equitably for higher wages . This scheme should last only for a limited period , perhaps a_couple_of years , after which Mexican democracy would begin to take_root and truly significant , competitive , free and fair elections could be held . Therein lies the essential problem facing Mexico today , in the opinion of many , though not all_of Grupo San Angel ' s members . Matters were left unattended for too long in Mexico ; today , the country is too polarized , too mistrustful and too bereft_of any democratic tradition to solve all_of its problems with this one election . There is a rapidly growing risk that , whatever the purported cleanliness of the vote , a huge number of Mexicans , undoubtedly a majority , will not only vote against the ruling PRI ( Institutional Revolutionary Party ) ; they also will not accept its permanence in power , no matter how cleanly PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo may have won ( if he does ) . This is true , of course , of the armed groups and the supporters of opposition candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , but it also holds for the conservative National Action Party electorate . For these millions of disaffected yet highly politicized and even militant Mexicans , after the PRIstas ' 65 years in power , it is time for them to go . It has never been clear to Mexicans that the best way , let alone the only way , to change governments or political_systems is through the ballot_box . Mostly , things here have changed through other means . If Sunday ' s election delivers a victor , and a margin of victory , that only frustrates and deeply disappoints millions , some of them will follow another road : the one the Zapatistas chose last Jan . 1 . The sense of frustration and despair that could quickly engulf this Mexico if the PRI wins , cleanly or not , could be devastating for the country . That is what Grupo San Angel is deeply concerned about : helping our country to find a way_out from an extremely complicated situation .</TEXT>
