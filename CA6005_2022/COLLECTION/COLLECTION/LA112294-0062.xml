   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL OUTLOOK ; A NEW CONTINENTAL DIVIDE ? ; FORGET THE COMPASS . EUROPE IS NO LONGER EAST AND WEST . BUT WHAT IS IT ? IN A SEARCH FOR THE ANSWER , THE STATE_DEPARTMENT IS HEADING FOR MIDDLE GROUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a continent where countries have such odd names as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and some cities have undergone three name changes this century , it should come as no surprise that Europeans take geopolitical designations very seriously . So it was with considerable appreciation that officials of the formerly Communist nations of Europe received a decision by the U.S. State_Department to do_away_with the unpopular term &quot; Eastern Europe &quot; in describing the onetime satellite states of the former Soviet_Union . The policy shift has drawn little notice in Washington , where it was first mentioned publicly by Assistant Secretary_of_State Richard Holbrooke in testimony to Congress in late September . But to those attuned to the historical and cultural sensitivities in this region , the pronouncement is seen as long-overdue confirmation that Europe cannot be defined merely by the compass_points East and West . The middle is back , and it goes_by the name Central Europe . &quot; The change helps make each country here visible as an individual entity rather than a sub-part of one big , gray mass , &quot; said Pavel Bratinka , Czech deputy foreign_minister . &quot; It is a clear sign that even beyond the Atlantic_Ocean they are starting to differentiate among us. &quot; It did not , of course , require a State_Department decree to resurrect Central Europe in the minds of Czechs and other self-described Central Europeans , many of whom have been speaking rather directly about their distaste for the &quot; Eastern Europe &quot; label . The notion of returning to Central Europe first became popular a decade ago among intellectuals and dissidents disenchanted with Communist rule_in the former Czechoslovakia and elsewhere . Czechs have been particularly perturbed by the &quot; Eastern &quot; designation , noting that Prague lies west of such indisputably non-Eastern capitals as Vienna and Stockholm . &quot; ' Central Europe ' has been the PC thing to say around here for quite some time now , &quot; said Jason Kelleher , admissions officer at the Central European University in Prague , a graduate_school whose main campus is in Budapest , Hungary . In part , the move toward Central Europe is cultural snobbery , an effort by former Soviet client states to distance themselves from countries such_as Ukraine and Belarus that were actually part of the Soviet_Union . In the pecking order of subjugation , many self-described Central Europeans see a huge difference between countries that were under Soviet dominance and those actually consumed by the empire . &quot; I would n ' t admit it publicly , but part of this has to do with all_of us looking down on our eastern neighbors , &quot; a high-ranking Polish official said . But the rush to embrace Central Europe also has some very practical considerations . For countries with aspirations to join the European Union , NATO and other European institutions , the shift from Eastern to Central Europe is seen as a large step toward the West . This is particularly true for the so-called Visegrad countries -- Poland , Hungary , Slovakia and the Czech Republic -- whose representatives met in Visegrad , Hungary , two years ago to coordinate their bids for European integration . &quot; For some time it was Eastern Europe , and now it is Central Europe , &quot; said Longin Pastusiak , deputy chairman of the Polish Parliament ' s foreign relations committee . &quot; I am looking_forward to the period when it is only Europe. &quot; Countries such_as the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Hungary , Poland and Romania trace their Central European credentials to the Austro-Hungarian Empire , the great European power , seated in Vienna , that emerged in the 16th Century . Even after its dissolution at the end of World_War I , its former subjects never gave_up on the empire ' s notion of being at the core of the Continent . But history intervened near the end of World_War_II , and then there was a hole in the center of the European doughnut for almost four decades . The disappearance of Central Europe is most commonly blamed on the Yalta Conference in February , 1945 , the last wartime meeting of Soviet leader Joseph_Stalin , British Prime_Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D . Roosevelt , during which the postwar settlement dividing Europe into spheres_of_influence was worked_out . Afterward , convenient political delineations -- namely , East and West -- took precedence over strictly geographic and historic ones in charting a new map of Europe . The terms &quot; East &quot; and &quot; West &quot; were soon applied to the occupied zones of vanquished Germany as well , designations that were easier understood than the Federal_Republic_of_Germany ( West ) and the German Democratic Republic ( East ) . With Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Romania , Bulgaria and East_Germany relegated to satellite status of the Soviet_Union -- a country so eastward that it straddled the Ural Mountains and spilled into Asia -- it was simple for the world to refer collectively to the Soviet subjects as Eastern Europeans . &quot; An artificial map was imposed on Europe that divided everything into ' Eastern ' and ' Western , ' &quot; said Piotr Nowina-Konopka , a foreign affairs expert in the Polish Parliament . &quot; There was a clear division of influence , and such countries as Poland were simply sent to the corner . Our bad_luck was that we were sent to the eastern corner. &quot; This folding of Central Europe into Eastern Europe occurred gradually as the Cold_War grew more intense and the rhetoric of the U.S.-Soviet rivalry more pronounced . In a famous 1946 speech , Churchill pronounced : &quot; From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic , an Iron_Curtain has descended across the Continent . Behind that line lie all capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe : Warsaw , Berlin , Prague , Vienna , Budapest , Belgrade , Bucharest and Sofia. &quot; With Europe separated into two ideological camps , the Cold_War lexicon soon grew geographically simplistic . Americans and West Europeans began referring to the &quot; East-West &quot; divide , and terms such_as &quot; Eastern bloc &quot; became synonymous with Soviet-dominated Europe . For propagandists , it was easy to vilify things &quot; Eastern &quot; and make people fearful of them , since the &quot; East-West &quot; metaphor had a long tradition apart from superpower politics . &quot; East-West &quot; also referred to centuries-old cultural differences between European and Asian peoples , the latter regarded_as mysterious and backward . It was along such lines in the early 1980s that the idea of Central Europe first re-emerged in the Soviet bloc countries . Czech writer Milan Kundera and others , disenchanted with Soviet-style Communist rule_in Europe , began drawing distinctions between European and Russian culture , nudging Russia farther and farther_east and virtually off the European map . Former Czech Prime_Minister Petr Pithart , a Communist-era dissident who lectures on law and politics , said the concept of Central Europe also focused less on geography than on culture and history . The idea , he said , was that Europeans living roughly between Germany and Russia had a special role to play_on the Continent . This idealized vision of Central Europe emphasized pluralism , multiculturalism , and in the post-Communist context , a civil society in which citizens would fill the moral and social void created by communism . At its core , it included Czechs , Slovaks , Poles and Hungarians but could also extend_to Germans , Austrians and Ruthenians , part of present-day Ukraine . &quot; Central Europe is not for us merely a neutral geographic concept , &quot; Pithart said . &quot; It has certain values on which doubt is cast all_the time , which are threatened all_the time . It is the most dense area of European pluralism , something like a dark forest where you don ' t want to live , but you can ' t be without. &quot; But with the fall of communism , a debate that had been confined mostly to literary circles soon found itself on the political agenda , and with time , into the briefing books at the U.S. State_Department . The road from theory to political practice has not been without its bumps , however . Holbrooke has proposed reorganizing the Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs to reflect the new geopolitical realities of the European Continent . Unfortunately , reality can be subjective . Ukraine , for example , wants to be known as Central Europe but none of its Central European neighbors include it in the club . The State_Department is also stumped over what to call its office dealing with Germany , Austria and Switzerland . The Germans regard themselves as Central Europeans , but their notion of the region -- known as Mitteleuropa -- has been interpreted in the past as license to dominate neighbors . Many Europeans would prefer to leave Germany in Western Europe . So , where is Central Europe ? &quot; It is a touchy thing , &quot; said Bratinka , the Czech deputy foreign_minister . &quot; You will not wring_out of me anything other_than the assertion that the Czech Republic is in Central Europe. &quot; Reworking the Political Geography of Europe The Continent ' s new politics are challenging traditional terms like &quot; Eastern Europe &quot; and &quot; Western Europe. &quot; Here ' s a look_at the map of Cold_War Europe and how the U.S. State_Department is now tentatively proposing to group some of the nations : COLD_WAR EUROPE 1 . Western Europe 2 . Eastern Europe 3 . Soviet_Union CURRENT PROPOSAL 1 . Baltic-Nordic 2 . North-Central 3 . Eastern 4 . South Central Note : Western Europe is being defined as France , Italy , Malta , Portugal and Spain . Germany , Austria and Switzerland are grouped together ; whether they belong in Central Europe is being debated .</TEXT>
