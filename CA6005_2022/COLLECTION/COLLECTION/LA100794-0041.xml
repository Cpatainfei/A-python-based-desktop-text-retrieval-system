   <HEADLINE> AROUND TOWN : BLUE DOG SNIFFS_OUT A GOLDEN GOOSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The hyperbole is thicker than moss in the bayou . &quot; I ' m just a po ' boy from New Iberia , LOOSiana. &quot; * Next , George Rodrigue will claim to be accompanying a cobalt-blue dog on a mystic journey through a never-never_land between life and death . And , know what ? You ' ll start to believe , at least about the blue dog . ( As for that poor_boy stuff , a flashy Rolex gives the game away. ) Maybe you ' ve seen Blue Dog . that ' s her , peering through improbably yellow eyes from those Absolut Vodka ads . And now , here ' s &quot; Blue Dog , &quot; the book . Blue Dog as a Book-of-the-Month Club pick . Blue Dog as philosopher . Blue Dog as cash_cow . . . . &quot; It ' s just a high every day . You can ' t take it too seriously , &quot; says artist Rodrigue ( pronounced Rod-reeg ) , Blue Dog ' s creator . He ' s on a promotional tour , signing books at SuperCrown in Glendale , sketching Blue Dog beneath his signature . A boyish 50-year-old given to saying , &quot; Man . . . &quot; ( as in , &quot; Man , what a dog ! &quot; ) , Rodrigue is too happy to even bristle_at any suggestion that Blue Dog is no Blue Boy , that the cur is crassly commercial . &quot; I painted Cajuns for 20 years when nobody wanted them , so they can ' t accuse me of painting Blue Dog for the money , &quot; he says . After all , Blue Dog didn ' t come from some paint-by-numbers kit . Rodrigue was schooled at the Art Center College of Design . His oils of Cajun folk hang_in the Louisiana governor ' s mansion , the residence of the_French president and the Smithsonian . He thinks it ' s a great joke when prospective buyers of Blue Dog paintings say to him , &quot; ' This is great ( but ) do you really know what you ' re doing ? &quot; He ' s quick to point_out that he knows exactly what he ' s doing , which rules he ' s breaking . Rodrigue calls Blue Dog &quot; Tiffany , &quot; the name he gave the real-life Blue Dog when she came_to him as a black-and-white pup in 1968 . She was the reject from a friend ' s litter of terrier-spaniels , a mutt , and he thought a fancy moniker would &quot; make her sound expensive. &quot; For 12 years until she died , they were pals . Tiffany snoozed nearby as Rodrigue painted in his Lafayette , La. , studio . Tiffany never failed to retrieve his tattered slippers from the trash . In 1984 , illustrating a book of Louisiana ghost stories , he needed a model for a mythical werewolf . He pulled_out a photo of Tiffany . To make her otherworldly , he painted her blue . An icon was born . Rodrigue ' s Blue Dog originals began to sell around Louisiana for $ 300 . The big breakthrough came_in 1988 , when a Blue Dog at a Rodeo Drive gallery fetched $ 2 # 500 . Clearly , Tiffany was no mutt . Today , an original will set you back about $ 10 # 000 ; a print , $ 900 . The craze has launched Blue Dog galleries in Carmel , Yokohama and Munich that gross $ 10 # 000 daily . To supply them , Rodrigue turns_out about 200 Blue Dog paintings a year . Rodrigue mentions such collectors as Whoopi Goldberg , Meredith and Tom Brokaw , Harry Connick Jr. , &quot; and a whole bunch of famous people. &quot; Hillary Rodham Clinton has a print , given to her by the owner of a New Orleans restaurant where she admired it . Top money paid_for top_dog was $ 150 # 000 on commission from a Canadian stockbroker . He wanted Blue Dog painted with a bull and a bear . Not content to be the only blue dog in the known world , Tiffany is a contributing writer of &quot; Blue Dog , &quot; the book ( Viking Studio Books ) , wherein she confides it was her idea all along that Rodrigue paint her . This was her dream , even as he &quot; ran his fingers over my ears as if I were a stuffed doll. &quot; In the book , Rodrigue and writer Lawrence S . Freundlich weave a charming tale of the man and dog on a quest_for the meaning of it all . &quot; She wants to come_back to me , &quot; Rodrigue says . &quot; It ' s so sad . I have to tell her she can ' t. &quot; Blue Dog doesn ' t know she ' s dead . As Blue Dog wanders through the spirit_world , Rodrigue paints her with such improbably diverse subjects as Marla Maples and Huey Long ' s bodyguards . He paints her with Elvis -- &quot; Blue Dog thinks Elvis is me because I listened to so_much Elvis music . She doesn ' t know Elvis is dead , either. &quot; And he paints her with nudes ( something about her seeking love in all_the wrong places ) . He even paints her as Pagliacci , a blue dog with the blues . Of course , Tiffany &quot; never thought she was a dog. &quot; Even Rodrigue must wonder . &quot; Now that she ' s died , she ' s made me more famous and made herself famous . She loves it. &quot; So does he . There are the vodka ads . ( For the record , Rodrigue doesn ' t drink . Presumably , Blue Dog doesn ' t either ? &quot; that ' s right. &quot; ) And there ' s the celebrity . He turned_down a million-dollar T-shirt offer from the folks who made Spuds McKenzie famous . &quot; I don ' t want my dog on every T-shirt in the country . It insults me and Tiffany. &quot; For now , he ' s said thanks , but no thanks , to some very famous animators . &quot; This is not a cartoon. &quot; Ditto , a very hot filmmaker . Doesn ' t he want to be rich and famous ? &quot; I am rich and famous. &quot; Hearty laughter . He ' d still be &quot; pushing those Cajuns &quot; if it weren ' t for Tiffany . &quot; Damn dog . . . . &quot; A Naked Cry_for Healing The happening onstage at Hollywood Moguls might best be called a body_of_work . The house darkens ; spotlights play_on a black backdrop . Chanting in unison , six figures in white sheets enter , looking_like a sextet of Roman senators . &quot; In the beginning , &quot; they intone , &quot; was the word . . . . &quot; Then they drop the sheets . An ensemble of poets -- starkers , every one . The better to present &quot; The Naked Word , &quot; a 90-minute speak-out against racism , domestic violence and unsafe sex . &quot; This is an artist ' s cry_for healing in our times , &quot; producer-director Kennon B . Raines would explain later . OK , but does nudity make_good poetry better ? Bad poetry worse ? What ' s the point ? Well , Raines said , some might think it ' s &quot; just to get people here. &quot; True , it helps to have a gimmick ; poetry is not a big draw . But she suggests a loftier motive : &quot; The poet ' s role is always to reveal self -- and hope the world will listen. &quot; Oh . Some may dismiss her as &quot; a belligerent nut. &quot; She shrugged . But she ' s shed her clothes to get people to look beneath the facade and hear the message . Indeed , after a_few minutes of bare skin , one ' s eyes tend to glaze_over . And , this is no sex show . Some of the four men ( the eldest of whom is 83 ) and three women sag and jiggle a bit . Raines said she had to &quot; beg , bitch and bamboozle &quot; to keep some of the poets in the show . But one , Mark Pomeroy , said he ' s comfortable out there : &quot; Poets are self-exposing sorts of people. &quot; Some in the audience were at first a bit uneasy . Keli Morgan , a poet herself , said , &quot; These people are our friends . Three-fourths of them I ' ve heard with their clothes on. &quot; Still , she thought one or two solo performances &quot; took_on a poignancy , a vulnerability &quot; through nakedness . She added : &quot; I know how hard ( going_out there ) is , even with my clothes on. &quot; Summing_up the quality of the poetry , another patron said , &quot; From god-awful to incredibly moving. &quot; In the end , Morgan wondered : &quot; What are they going_to tell their grandchildren ? ' &quot; The Naked Word &quot; will be performed at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday at Hollywood Moguls , 1650 Schrader . * This weekly column chronicles the people and small moments that define life in Southern California .
