   <HEADLINE> PENA TO LEAD U.S. DELEGATION TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration announced Tuesday that it will send a Cabinet-level delegation to Taiwan early next month , a move welcomed by authorities here as &quot; an important breakthrough &quot; in relations . The December visit by Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena to attend a U.S.-Taiwan business conference will mark only the second time since 1979 that a Cabinet member has traveled officially to Taiwan , which is formally known as the Republic_of_China on Taiwan . It is also the most dramatic evidence yet of the Clinton_Administration effort , announced this fall , to upgrade U.S.-Taiwan relations 15 years after withdrawal of diplomatic recognition in favor of the mainland People ' s Republic_of_China . In 1992 , U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills , a member of the Bush Cabinet , visited Taiwan for the same event that Pena is slated to attend , a meeting of the USA-ROC ( Republic_of_China ) Economic Council . Sources in Taipei said that Pena will be accompanied by senior bureaucrats in the Treasury_Department . The Dec . 5-7 meeting of 800 representatives of large American and Taiwanese corporations will also be attended by former President George_Bush . &quot; It is easily the highest-ranking group to come here since 1979 , &quot; said a Western observer . &quot; The decision adequately reflects and enhances the interests of both countries , &quot; Taiwan government spokesman Jason Hu said Tuesday night . &quot; We hope that this is the beginning of a more mature relationship between Washington and Taipei. &quot; Hu described the decision as &quot; an important breakthrough. &quot; Chen Yu-jun , director of the American Research Institute of Chinese Cultural University , said the Pena visit represents the Clinton_Administration ' s de_facto recognition of Taiwan . The move is certain to anger authorities in Beijing , where any enhancement of U.S.-Taiwan relations is viewed_as a violation of the &quot; one China &quot; principle accepted by the United States in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act that governs U.S. policy . Explaining the Administration ' s decision , the State_Department said in a statement Tuesday night : &quot; The United States recognized the government of the People ' s Republic_of_China as the sole legal government of China in 1979 , and since that time we have had unofficial relations with Taiwan . . . . Secretary Pena is traveling_to Taiwan at the invitation of the U.S.-Republic of China Economic Council , a private group . The theme of the council ' s meeting concerns transportation , so it is appropriate that Secretary Pena participate. &quot; The announcement also comes only four days before Taiwan ' s voters go_to the polls in mayoral and gubernatorial elections that have been dominated by the issue of the independence of Taiwan . &quot; Many Taiwanese are hoping for more international status , &quot; Chen said . &quot; This will show important progress. &quot; According to the China Economic News Service in Taiwan , Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui will speak_to business_leaders at the conference on &quot; opportunities and challenges for using Taiwan as a business operations center by U.S. enterprises. &quot; Taiwan has emerged as one of the world ' s great trading states and the sixth biggest volume trading partner with the United States . Recent democratic reforms have also won support as Taiwan is held_up as an example of transformation from a one-party martial_law regime to a democracy . But most relations with major Western countries have been restricted to &quot; unofficial &quot; meetings in restaurants and hotels -- even though Taiwan is a first-class economic state with the world ' s largest supply of foreign reserves . Before the_Hills visit in 1992 , no Cabinet-level official had visited since 1975 , when Vice_President Nelson Rockefeller attended the funeral of the late president and dictator Chiang Kai-shek . Times staff writer Jim Mann in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
