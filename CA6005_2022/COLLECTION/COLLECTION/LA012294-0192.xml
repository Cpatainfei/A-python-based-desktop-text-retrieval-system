   <HEADLINE> QUAKE DEALS RIOT AREAS ANOTHER DISASTROUS BLOW ; AFTERMATH : MANY HOMES AND BUSINESSES ARE DECLARED UNSAFE IN NEIGHBORHOODS STILL REELING FROM 1992 UNREST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During the 1992 riots , the Messiah Baptist_Church served as a safe_harbor , dispensing food and clothing and offering a secure place to sleep as chaos raged outside in the Crenshaw district . But this week , the reverberations of an earthquake centered 20 miles to the north have forced city building inspectors to shut_down the West Adams Boulevard structure , which suffered nasty cracks in its hefty bell_tower and a collapsed ceiling and chimney in its fellowship hall . &quot; We took_care of hundreds here in 1992 , &quot; said the Rev . Kenneth J . Flowers . &quot; Now , if push comes_to shove , we ' ll have to end_up holding our Sunday services in a tent. &quot; While most government and media attention to the earthquake has focused_on the San Fernando Valley , hundreds of structures in Southwest and South-Central Los Angeles also were struck and left unsafe for occupancy . Among them are institutions at the core of the city ' s African American community . Messiah Baptist , Southern Missionary Baptist_Church , Bethany Baptist_Church , the Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theatre and offices of the Family Savings and Founders National_banks have been shut_down , at least temporarily . Also closed because of earthquake damage were numerous stores and offices in the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza , including the Governor ' s Business Revitalization Center , which was created after the riots to assist victimized businesses seeking state_government permits to rebuild . Unlike the period of the riots , when fires and looting were mainly limited to business blocks , this week ' s earthquake has also struck_home -- literally -- in many residential neighborhoods . At the north end of the Crenshaw district , dozens of small bungalows and Spanish-style homes suffered significant structural damage -- severed foundations , toppled chimneys and jagged cracks in the walls . At noon Friday , many residents remained without gas or water service and had not yet been paid a visit by city Department of Building and Safety inspectors . &quot; My whole house slipped_off the foundation , &quot; sighed Robert Petite , 81 , who has lived_on West 28th Street since the early 1950s . &quot; I ' m still living here but I don ' t know if my house is livable . &quot; I ' ve been trying to get a city inspector to look , but I just get a busy signal when I call , &quot; said the retired chef , who cowered in the bedroom closet of his wood-frame home for 30 minutes after the earthquake struck . Around the corner on Vineyard Avenue , Sagas Tome , who is eight months pregnant , and 11 relatives were spending the nights in a creaky , unheated plywood garage because they feared that the heavily damaged apartment_building next door to their house will collapse in the next strong aftershock . &quot; Are you the building inspector ? &quot; Tome asked a reporter . &quot; Everyone here is living_in fear. &quot; With residents and business owners across Los Angeles still making inspection requests late this week , city building officials had planned to add 100 inspectors to their crews Friday . But Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said it was inexcusable that homes_in South-Central Los Angeles had not yet been inspected . &quot; No one should be waiting for an inspector at this point , &quot; said the councilman , whose district includes the area . Preliminary estimates indicate at least $ 6.9 million in damage to 268 structures in neighborhoods of central Los Angeles , including those south of the Santa Monica Freeway . But the figures are certain to skyrocket as building inspectors continue their survey . Ridley-Thomas estimated that well_over 1 # 000 South-Central Los Angeles residents have been left without housing . At Jim Gilliam Park alone , more_than 300 people have been sleeping outdoors each night , many of them residents of damaged 1950s-era apartment_buildings in the Baldwin Village neighborhood . &quot; It ' s kind of the untold earthquake story , &quot; said the councilman , who is co-sponsoring an earthquake preparedness and recovery exposition this morning at the Crenshaw Christian Center . &quot; There was just no hiding_place from this earthquake. &quot; Other neighborhoods of central Los Angeles that were hit hard in the 1992 riots also suffered damage in the earthquake , among them Koreatown , Pico-Union and East Hollywood . &quot; Our wall split open like cooked popcorn , &quot; said Gloria Salinas , who lives_in a single-bedroom Koreatown apartment with her husband and three children . &quot; No one was hurt , but we were all so scared . We don ' t want to go_back in. &quot; Moreover , some Korean American businessmen whose stores were looted in the riots have now suffered a double blow , according to Korean American attorney and activist Angela Oh . &quot; These businesses have already been suffering because the economy is so bad , &quot; she said . &quot; And many of these Korean families live_out in the Northridge area. &quot; On South Figueroa Avenue near the Los Angeles Sports Arena , which itself has been closed temporarily as a safety precaution , four buildings have been judged unsafe by building inspectors . In a parking_lot , 30 residents camped under makeshift tents . &quot; I don ' t know what we ' re going to do , &quot; said building manager Luz Ruiz , who is pregnant and has seven children . &quot; They say it ' s going_to rain this weekend . . . . My children are already sick. &quot; Along major thoroughfares of Southwest Los Angeles , where inspections had been made to most stricken churches and businesses by late Thursday , many of the brick-facade buildings judged unsafe were those that had undergone costly earthquake reinforcement during the last five years . &quot; We reinforced for over $ 200 # 000 in 1992 , &quot; said Lula Washington , director of the Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theatre , whose West Adams Boulevard headquarters now features a 30-foot-long hole in the wall of its second-floor rehearsal hall . &quot; When I saw this building , I almost collapsed myself , &quot; she said . &quot; And then today , ironically , we had to pay our fire_insurance . We sent_out a check to protect a building that we can ' t use. &quot; Washington hopes to receive enough federal aid and contributions to make an estimated $ 100 # 000 in repairs_to the hall , a 69-year-old former Masonic Temple . She is also scrambling to find rehearsal space for her dance company , an after-school &quot; I Do Dance , Not Drugs , &quot; program and tumbling program for teen-agers . &quot; There ' s a lot of activities that will be displaced , &quot; Washington said . &quot; And we don ' t have any money. &quot; At the corporate office of the Founders National_Bank on Martin_Luther_King Boulevard , beams are cracked and the bank ' s sign lies_in the bushes . Repairs will cost an estimated $ 600 # 000 and take six months , with the office temporarily moved to branches in the Crenshaw Plaza Shopping_Center and Gardena . Family Savings Bank ' s main_office in the 3600 block of Crenshaw Boulevard was closed when it was flooded by a fire safety sprinkler_system triggered by the temblor . The bank plans to set_up temporary facilities in its parking_lot within three weeks while repairs are made . Perhaps the worst-hit building in South-Central L.A. was the Southern Missionary Baptist_Church , whose congregants spent $ 250 # 000 on earthquake reinforcement repairs three years ago . &quot; There ' s no question we ' ll have to tear it down , &quot; said the Rev . J . L . Gates , who was dressed in a gray suit and a white hard_hat , with a tape_measure dangling from his belt . &quot; We made_it through the ( Rodney King beating ) trials , but the tribulations got us. &quot; At Bethany Baptist , on Martin_Luther_King Boulevard , where a railing now hangs off the side of the sanctuary , Sunday services have been rescheduled at Dorsey High_School . And at Messiah Baptist , Flowers was still wavering between a tent in the parking_lot and a Jewish temple in Hollywood with which his church has a covenant relationship . While waiting for a structural engineer to arrive to determine the extent of the bell_tower damage , Flowers reflected that the earthquake -- in the wake of rioting , flooding and fires -- represented a wake-up call from above . &quot; I think God is speaking_to get our attention , to say that we need to recognize that he is still in control and in_charge , &quot; he said . Thus far , the message concerning quake damage in Southwest Los Angeles has not yet reached much of the world , he said . &quot; People from back East call and they don ' t know that we were even affected by the earthquake . Yes we were , we felt it big time. &quot; But the message from above certainly made an impact on the altar of Messiah Missionary , Flowers added , citing a stained glass representation of the Holy_Spirit that was shaken loose . &quot; A brick came_down , &quot; he said , &quot; and sent the Holy_Spirit right into the piano. &quot;</TEXT>
