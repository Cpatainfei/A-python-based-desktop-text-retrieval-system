   <TEXT> Bosnian Serbs raked three Sarajevo trams with machine-gun fire Saturday , killing one man and seriously wounding six other people , including children , in an apparent revenge attack . The shooting followed a warning by hard-line Bosnian Serb leader Momcilo Krajisnik that Serbs would avenge the killing of 20 Serbian soldiers and nurses in a commando raid by the Muslim-led Bosnian army . Witnesses Saturday saw some victims hit several times during a 12-minute fusillade aimed at Sarajevo ' s notorious &quot; sniper alley. &quot; It forced U.N. peacekeepers to deploy armored cars as a shield against the attackers . Hospital doctors treated six badly wounded , included boys aged 14 and 16 . Five other children were less seriously hurt . It was the worst Serbian attack on Sarajevo ' s civilian population since a bombardment last month that killed two people and wounded 18 . U.N. spokesmen said the firing came from Bosnian Serb army positions in Sarajevo ' s Jewish cemetery . Yasushi Akashi , the U.N. special envoy for the former Yugoslav federation , condemned &quot; this flagrant and deliberate attack on civilians. &quot; Krajisnik had told the Bosnian Serb news_agency SRNA on Friday night that &quot; Serbs cannot be passive &quot; after the killing of 20 soldiers and nurses the previous day . The victims were buried Saturday . The United Nations described the attack on the Serbs , at a Bosnian Serb army command_post outside Sarajevo , as a military operation by the Muslim-led Bosnian army , whereas the Serbian targets Saturday were civilians . Serbian revenge attacks on Muslim civilians for military reverses have been characteristic of their tactics during 30 months of fighting in which 10 # 000 people have died in Sarajevo alone . Also Saturday , the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees halted aid flights to Sarajevo after two U.N. military planes were hit on the runway Friday . The airport had reopened only Friday after being shut since Sept . 22 because of Serbian threats to shoot at aircraft in retaliation for a NATO air strike . A spokesman said the flights will resume today . The Serbian blockade severely disrupted efforts to keep Sarajevo ' s 380 # 000 people supplied with food . U.N. official Kris Janowski said bakeries and warehouses in Sarajevo had stocks for only a_few days .</TEXT>
