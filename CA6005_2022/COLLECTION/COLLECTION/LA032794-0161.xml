   <HEADLINE> THE NBA / MARK HEISLER ; WILL COACH MAGIC HAVE SWEET 16 ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I nterim ? You have to hand it to the Lakers , they still know how to throw a news_conference . Everyone else makes an announcement . With the purple and gold , you get surprises . This one didn ' t quite match the ' 81 classic , at which Jerry Buss fired Paul Westhead , who had won five games in a row , and tried to hire Jerry West , who lateraled the job to Pat Riley right in front of everybody , after which Riley won them four titles . But it wasn ' t exactly routine , either . Interim ? Magic Johnson ' s news_conference drew the biggest crowd the Lakers had seen since . . . uh . . . his last news_conference . The aerials on the minicam trucks looked_like a forest in the parking_lot . Tickets for Johnson ' s debut were flying out ; more_than 1 # 000 were sold by the end of the news_conference on walk-ups at the Forum . The franchise was like a light_bulb that had been off for two years and was suddenly switched back on . Now for the surprise . . . Interim ? Yes , Buss asked , and Johnson agreed that he would coach the Lakers only for the last 16 games of the season . Each side had its reasons for putting_off a real commitment , though neither was talking_about them . The Lakers want to see if Johnson is serious , as opposed to taking a walk on them as he did when he called_off his 1992 comeback . Johnson wants a piece of an NBA franchise . Buss has politely but steadfastly refused suggestions he sell him part of this one . The last time it came_up , Buss ' spokesman , Bob Steiner , noted wryly that the owner had always said he would leave the team to his children and , while he considered Johnson a surrogate son , that didn ' t count . Things simply changed . The rabbit pulled a magician out of a hat . Having brought Johnson back to relight the lights , Buss has little choice but to keep him or face a new night , darker than the franchise has ever seen . By all accounts , this was Buss ' sole initiative and he did_it for better reasons than a 33 % drop_in attendance in two years . Today ' s boomlet will end soon enough and the reasons will still be there . Johnson is a terrific coaching prospect . It ' s a_people job , he ' s a_people genius , someone who can air a player out -- yoo hoo , Vlade Divac -- without the player minding . Players will hustle for him as they never did for Randy Pfund , who had neither Johnson ' s presence nor Johnson ' s name . Pfund was_on a tightrope , besides , and his rascals knew it . The Lakers might attract better free_agents with Johnson . He won ' t fall on his face . How bad can anyone look taking_over a 28-38 team ? He will love it . He loves the game and lives for challenges . This is challenge enough for a decade . He is ideal for Buss , who has complete confidence in him . Although it hasn ' t sunk_in yet , rebuilding requires patience . Johnson will be allowed to struggle , a license Pfund wasn ' t granted . Buss has been a model owner who pays generously and trusts his professionals . However , the franchise ' s fall , predictable as the sunset when Johnson retired , has left him in a state of denial . Why would he want to fire his rookie coach last spring after trading the team ' s most dependable player -- Sam Perkins -- for a prospect plus Benoit Benjamin ? The Lakers faced hard_times then and still do , with Johnson , John Wooden , Rick Pitino or whomever . In the NBA , players make programs and superstars make dynasties . If Riley had inherited Divac and Nick Van Exel rather than Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , he might still be_on the radio next to Chick Hearn . There ' s a difference between players and prospects . The Lakers have more of the latter . Divac has become a top-10 center . Van Exel is a find . George Lynch is undersized , but talented . Anthony Peeler remains a prospect , but with a question_mark : What happened this season ? Doug Christie is their best prospect , but his flame was allowed to flicker after the All-Star break as Pfund , fighting for his job , played veterans . The Lakers are planning a shopping expedition , but face furious competition for Danny Manning and Horace Grant . The other free_agents are older players , such_as Buck Williams and Michael Cage , helpful for a contender , but no one for a young team to build around . The Lakers have high hopes for their first lottery pick -- the second-to-last lottery pick_at the pace they are_on . They are 125-1 for Glenn Robinson . This draft falls_off a cliff after the first four -- Robinson , Jason Kidd , Grant Hill , Donyell Marshall . At No . 10 , the Lakers are back in undersized-forward country . It would shake a normal man , but Johnson ' s optimism is the stuff of legends . It really is a job for a Magic man . Luckily , there was one available . RANDY PFUND : MAY 18 , 1992-MARCH 23 , 1994 Two words describe his tenure as Laker coach : Human sacrifice . Pfund wasn ' t a natural . He had things to learn , but he was tireless and devoted to a fault . He chose the Laker job and all_the pressure that went_with it over an offer from the Sacramento Kings , whose goals are more modest . It wasn ' t even a choice for him . He was a Laker , period . Buss never understood Pfund ' s problems , nor was he interested in understanding them . Buss simply wanted things the way they used to be . Pfund did get one of those Buss scholarships , an extra year tacked_on to his contract when they already knew he was gone , which means the Lakers still owe him another $ 900 # 000 or so . He earned it with his devotion and , when it was no longer required , his grace . When Pfund got the bad news , he thanked Buss and West for the opportunity . At $ 900 # 000 , he was a bargain . HUMAN HIGHLIGHT FILM : COMING ? While he lasts , Dominique Wilkins is the best thing that ever happened to the Clippers . Imagine , after years of having players throw their money in their face , here is a bona_fide superstar who acts_as if he wants to be here and says he will talk others -- such_as Ron Harper -- into staying , too . Of course , business is also business . Thus it can ' t be too surprising that Wilkins ' agent said last week that they will test the free-agent market . But when ESPN reported that he was interested in the Lakers , they couldn ' t have been whooping it up at the Sports Arena . Leverage is anywhere you can find it , but the facts suggest that Wilkins will finish his career as a Clipper . The Clippers can pay him that $ 6-7 million a year he ' s asking_for . Anyone else would have to clear that much room under the salary cap , a prodigious task . The Clippers can give him a multiyear contract . No one else can sign him for more_than a year ; he is about to turn 35 . If Wilkins wants to be a Laker badly enough to accept $ 1.75 million -- the most they could pay him -- on the assumption he will have enough left in a year to merit a $ 6-million contract , he ' s one high-rolling dude . FACES AND FIGURES Welcome home : Former Hornet Kendall Gill , playing his first game in Charlotte since forcing his trade to Seattle , was booed every time he touched the ball , elbowed by former teammate Larry Johnson and got_into an argument with his former coach , Alan Bristow . Gill then proceeded to score 22 points , 10 in the last five minutes , as the SuperSonics beat the Hornets . . . . The Johnson-Gill feud started when Gill threw a party without specifically inviting Johnson . Johnson then threw a party , making_sure not to invite Gill . After last week ' s game , Johnson waited by the court for Gill , who was doing a postgame radio show . Hornet assistant T.R. Dunn dragged Johnson back to the dressing room before he could start real trouble . &quot; LJ wanted a piece of him , &quot; teammate Hersey Hawkins said . &quot; Luckily , they didn ' t meet in the tunnel . It saved them both a lot of money. &quot; The Mighty Quinn Chronicles , continued : In their recent game at the Sports Arena , Dallas players had to break_up two fights between Coach Quinn Buckner and Jim Jackson , the one prominent Maverick Buckner hadn ' t previously angered . Last week Buckner fined forward Terry Davis $ 500 for second-guessing his substitutions in the newspaper . Buckner sent him a letter informing him of it , whereupon Davis told Buckner -- in the newspaper -- to &quot; be a man. &quot; How to rebuild -- not : You ' re supposed to trade your veterans for young prospects , lose games and fall_into the lottery , but the Detroit Piston stars , Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars , are staying where they are , Thomas to run the team , Dumars because he doesn ' t want to be traded . &quot; I ' m the one who has to adjust to a trade , &quot; Dumars said , &quot; and I don ' t want to. &quot; Former Piston Olden Polynice helped break_up the fight early in the season between guard Alvin Robertson and Billy McKinney , Piston director of personnel . Polynice recently was upset that McKinney had traded him to Sacramento , made him fly back when the deal was canceled , then traded him back to Sacramento . Said Polynice : &quot; Maybe we should have let Alvin strangle him. &quot;</TEXT>
