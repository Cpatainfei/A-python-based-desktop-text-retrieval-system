   <HEADLINE> BLUNT POLITICO , IDEALIST VIE TO DEFINE JAPAN ' S FUTURE ; POLITICS : THE CONSERVATIVE OZAWA AND THE LIBERAL TAKEMURA ARE CHIEF RIVALS IN THE CURRENT POWER STRUGGLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One is a brilliant policy strategist and ace at brute-power politics who criticizes Japan ' s consensus decision-making as &quot; collective irresponsibility. &quot; He says Japan must become a &quot; normal nation &quot; by ending its free ride_on American security policies and by more actively cooperating with such global ventures as U.N. peacekeeping operations . For such views , Ichiro Ozawa of the Renewal Party is praised as a visionary and condemned as a dangerous autocrat . The other is a liberal who rejects any role as a military or political giant . He says Japan should be a &quot; small but shining nation &quot; serving the world through ventures such_as environmental cooperation . Masayoshi Takemura , chief of the New Party Harbinger , is nicknamed Mumin Papa after a roly-poly creature in a Norwegian fairy tale ; his kindly manner and consensus style may fit the Japanese character , but he is criticized as lacking substance . They differ in policy , personality and political style . But Ozawa and Takemura have now become focal_points and chief rivals in the monumental power struggle shaking Japan . That struggle -- set_off by the collapse last July of the Liberal Democratic Party ' s 38-year rule -- came_into sharp relief after Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned last week . Ozawa , 51 , is de_facto commander of the ruling coalition ' s conservative forces from the Renewal Party , the Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party and Hosokawa ' s Japan New Party , an alliance that totals 150 members . Takemura , 59 , leads the 108 members of the liberal wing ' s New Party Harbinger , Socialists and Democratic Socialist_Party . As the political world lurches toward a historic realignment , the two rivals represent the sharp choices Japan faces in deciding what role to play internationally in the post-Cold War world . &quot; This is a war between a Japanese idealist , Takemura , and a Japanese realist , Ozawa , &quot; said political commentator Yoshimi Ishikawa . The two men also display different attitudes toward two of Japan ' s hottest_issues : North_Korea and tax_policy . Ozawa says North_Korea has a nuclear bomb and Japan might be a target , all_the more reason to prepare defenses . Takemura has remained conspicuously silent . He enjoys friendly relations with the Pyongyang regime , having forged fishing treaties as governor of Shiga prefecture south of Kyoto . He visited North_Korea in 1990 with former LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru . Ozawa has advocated a 10 % increase in the consumption tax to pay_for a 50 % cut_in income and residence levies -- a bold plan that would probably offer a powerful economic stimulus . But Takemura has balked at raising the consumption tax and has advocated using deficit-financing bonds instead . The two rivals have carried their war to bookstores , where Ozawa ' s best-selling policy tome has outsold Takemura ' s book more_than 4 to 1 , with 670 # 000 copies sold . In his &quot; Blueprint for a New Japan , &quot; Ozawa bluntly takes Japan to task for weak leadership , selfish economic development and slavery to the company ; he offers explicit proposals for change , saying , &quot; We continue to receive and not to give. &quot; Takemura , in his &quot; A Small but Shining Nation , &quot; says such a path is a dangerous invitation to rearm . Japan , he says , should look_for less provocative ways to contribute , such_as devoting 0.5 % of its annual gross_national_product -- about $ 20 billion -- to global environmental protection . But more_than their policies , their differing political styles have drawn the sharpest attention . Both are former LDP members but were groomed under radically different masters . Ozawa is a disciple of legendary political shogun Kakuei Tanaka , the former prime_minister who honed to an art the corrupt system of money politics . Takemura is allied_with Masaharu Gotoda , a godfather of the LDP liberal wing who accelerated the crackdown on corruption in the construction_industry in 1992 as justice minister under then-Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa . In Japan ' s long tradition of political puppet and puppeteer , Ozawa works in the shadows , skillfully wielding power . He was said to be the mastermind behind the Hosokawa government and , over the years , has brokered agreements on such fractious issues as Japan ' s $ 13-billion contribution to the Persian_Gulf_War and trade compromises with the United States in areas including telecommunications and construction . His brute effectiveness has won him ardent fans and virulent enemies . He is resented not only by Takemura but also by a majority of LDP members , who blame him for destroying the party ' s grasp on power by bolting with 35 members last year . As a result , he has become the lightning_rod in the political turmoil , which is dividing along pro- and anti-Ozawa forces . His shadowy style is coming under increasing attack . &quot; In the Japan of today , politicians must take responsibility upfront for the power they wield , &quot; said Teruaki Nakano , a Tokyo advertising executive and admitted Takemura fan . As criticism against him mounts , Ozawa -- a policy wonk and an intensely private leader -- made a startling appearance last week on an entertainment show catering to women . He smiled it up , lovingly talked_about his pet birds and gamely endured a &quot; fashion check &quot; of his dark_blue suits . He confessed that he calls his wife , Kazuko , &quot; Mama &quot; and sometimes lies to her . ( He was so obedient to his mentor Tanaka that he married her on his advice , sight unseen. ) He said his life ' s greatest influence was his mother , a strict disciplinarian . He does not want his three sons to become politicians . He thinks_about quitting at least half the time ; his hero is a comic_book character who enjoys total freedom as a masterless samurai . The ladies loved him . &quot; My image of you has really changed , &quot; one woman in the audience gushed . Takemura , meantime , enjoys a warm , fuzzy reputation as a conciliator . Even after leaving the LDP , he never burned his bridges . He employs a more traditional style of consensus building . And unlike Ozawa , Takemura operates in the open . He was the first governor in the nation to publicly disclose his assets when the Lockheed bribery scandal shook the country in 1976 , and later wrote several political reform bills as a congressman . But Takemura lacks the raw power to deliver the goods , analysts say . Nor does he possess the skill with politics and money that Ozawa learned from the master , Tanaka . Takemura and his pals &quot; are utterly decent , genuine internationalists who don ' t have much power and are used as potted plants to decorate the rougher , tougher side of Japanese politics , &quot; said Chalmers Johnson , a University of California professor emeritus . Johnson noted that despite Ozawa ' s questionable tactics , he &quot; does have the power to deliver. &quot; Takemura , raised by grandparents in Shiga after his farming mother died of overwork when he was 2 , graduated from Tokyo University in economics in 1962 . He married his wife , Chizuru , after meeting her at a dance party ; they have two children . At 36 , he became known as the &quot; Bicycle Mayor &quot; of his hometown of Yokaichi because he commuted to work by bike , and he distinguished himself for his anti-pollution policies as governor three years later . He was elected to the lower house of Parliament in July , 1986 , and broke_with the LDP in June , 1993 , when it failed to approve political reform , founding the New Party Harbinger . Ozawa was born in Iwate prefecture ( state ) in northern Japan . A graduate in economics of Keio University , he is the son of a politician and was elected to the lower house in 1969 . He has held such posts as minister of home affairs and LDP secretary_general . He left the LDP and established the Japan Renewal Party last year after the arrest on tax_evasion charges of his political mentor , Kanemaru , threw the party into chaos .</TEXT>
