   <HEADLINE> HARVEST_TIME : TOSSING WORK , LUCK INTO SALAD ; AGRICULTURE : GOURMET GREENS ARE SENT ACROSS COUNTRY AS A FIELD NEAR CAMARILLO PRODUCES ITS FIRST PROFITS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From the freeway , the field now looks_like a vast , just-vacuumed carpet , a uniform stretch of bright , bright green . Up close , however , the beds more resemble a scruffy patchwork_quilt . Nurturing three types of lettuce plus radishes and turnips , the field bristles with contrasting shapes , sizes and colors . A broad oval here , a spiky nub there . A deep green , a silver sheen . It ' s been nearly a year since three ranchers bought the 60-acre patch just outside Camarillo for $ 420 # 000 , taking_out hefty bank loans and risking their other landholdings as collateral . They spent countless hours -- and hundreds of thousands more dollars -- preparing the long-abandoned acreage for planting . Now , it ' s payoff time . After months of spending , the farmers are ready to earn . But first , they must harvest the blooming field and find markets for the gourmet greens . Because rancher Jim Roberts planted the field in eight-acre strips , his workers have been picking the crop steadily throughout the winter . So far , they ' ve harvested about half of the 60 acres dubbed Conejo Ranch . As always , the laborers have encountered a_few weeds and a_few bugs as they trudge through the endless bend-and-pick rhythm of the harvest . But overall , &quot; the field ' s done all_right , &quot; Roberts said . &quot; We ' ve sold most of the crop , &quot; he added . &quot; that ' s what counts. &quot; Abandoned for more_than a decade before Roberts and his partners reclaimed the swampy land for agriculture , Conejo Ranch has survived its first big test . But while the field has produced well , the partners at Underwood Ranches remain disappointed . The culprit : this winter ' s confoundedly perfect weather . To Craig Underwood ' s dismay , farmers across Southern and Central California have been enjoying remarkably mild temperatures this year . Unscathed by October ' s wildfires , January ' s earthquake and February ' s mudslides , many ranches have produced bumper crops . The crackling freezes that usually grip the Imperial Valley have skipped eastward . The cold , wet weather that usually dampens the Salinas harvest has given_way to mild , spring-like temperatures . And extended growing_seasons in both regions have yielded more competition for Underwood Ranches . &quot; We try to anticipate Mother Nature . We plant in anticipation of other guys being out , &quot; said sales director Minos Athanassiadis , a partner in the Conejo Ranch venture . &quot; Usually , winter means bad_weather . Winter means frost . Winter means rain , disrupted planting seasons , lettuce crops freezing on the stalks , &quot; Athanassiadis said . &quot; Usually , winter tightens_up the supply and lets us bring our prices above break-even. &quot; Usually . But not this year . The average price farmers receive for their gourmet salad -- a tumble of baby lettuce and exotic greens -- has dropped to less than $ 9 for a three-pound box this year . Normally , that box would sell for about $ 12 . Four years ago , when horrendous weather devastated the competition , even salad of mediocre quality fetched $ 14 a box . that ' s why the farmers at Underwood Ranches would n ' t mind a freak freeze in Salinas . Or some ravenous , lettuce-loving locusts in the Imperial Valley . It sounds mean-spirited , but the partners don ' t really wish their competition evil . A little run-of-the-mill bad_luck would do just fine . &quot; You need something to happen somewhere , whether it be weather-related or a catastrophe , &quot; said Alan Laird , deputy agricultural commissioner for Ventura County . &quot; If everything goes_along normally , and production is_on schedule ( everywhere ) , sometimes you have too_much supply. &quot; Ironically , the bad_weather elsewhere in the country is causing as much consternation as the unyielding warmth in California . Slick roads and sinking temperatures back East have nibbled steadily away at the demand for fresh produce . Bundled in front of toasty fireplaces , even the hardiest consumers have cut_back on trips to restaurants and supermarkets . Despite the bulging supply and constricted demand , Underwood Ranches ' partners still earn 15 % on their salad some months , when the capricious market breaks their way . But mostly , they ' ve been watching glumly as net revenues dip further and further . Still , harvest at Conejo Ranch continues . Field hands , mostly Mexican immigrants , pack red crates with the gourmet greens each morning , picking just enough between 6 a.m. and noon to fill that day ' s orders . For now , they ignore the most recently planted rows , which nourish the smallest shoots . The baby plants , stripped across the eastern end of the field , remain smaller than clover , leaves no bigger than fingernails . Marching in_order of size like Russian nesting dolls , the greens gradually grow larger , peaking mid-field amid bushy heads of tatsoi and arugula . Beyond the mature plants , in the westernmost block , lie the beds that have already been harvested . Churned-up dirt , sprinkled with a_few stray leaves , creates a rough-textured contrast with the gleaming rows of green . * On days following a storm , new colors and textures join the montage of dirt and plants on Conejo Ranch . Shiny rivulets of water_snake up the furrows and shimmering puddles pool in a trough toward the field ' s southern edge . On one such sodden morning in mid-February , Agustin Garcia drove a tractor through the muck to collect lettuce-laden crates and place empties in position for the next day ' s harvest . The tractor ' s massive wheels wobbled drunkenly in the thick , grasping mud . &quot; It ' s hard , huh ? &quot; Garcia said , grinning . &quot; But I have to work . You get_to be a big mess , but you don ' t have a choice. &quot; Picking the baby greens is considered skilled work among field hands , who earn $ 6.92 an hour plus benefits . Each day they must assess the quality of the mature plants , and decide which leaves to cut with their stainless-steel knives . Because the lettuce bruises easily , they must handle the plants tenderly . Carrots , in contrast , require only entry-level skills . Harvesters simply pluck the baby carrots from the ground , check that the shoots are finger-sized and the tops a healthy shade of green , and chuck the vegetables into a crate . After seven years as Underwood Ranches ' harvest supervisor , Jesus Valladolid -- known as Diablo -- can estimate fairly well how many boxes of greens his crews will need to fill each morning . If the company gets a surprise order , he receives the news through his ever-crackling walkie-talkie and passes it on to his field foremen . The walkie-talkie system makes communication easy -- Jim Roberts carries his in a back pocket and flips it out like Clint Eastwood drawing a gun . Just a_few years ago , however , Roberts and Diablo had no walkie-talkies . Their salad crops , still experimental , were spread_out among dozens of fields , squeezed between cauliflower and broccoli . To coordinate the harvest , they first had to find each other . And often , Roberts said , they would end_up circling endlessly between Camarillo and Oxnard , driving 150 miles each in a single day . As Underwood Ranches lurched toward large-scale production of baby lettuce and gourmet greens in the late 1980s , the partners lacked critical technology , from walkie-talkies on up . And they came_up with some pretty wacky substitutes . An old Speed Queen laundry machine hooked_up to a lawn-mower engine , for instance , served as an industrial-sized salad spinner . Later , the farmers got electricity , abandoned the lawn-mower engine , and plugged_in six new washers . But they never got_around_to disconnecting the coin_boxes . So they kept a supply of quarters on_hand , plunking them into the Laundromat machines each time they had to spin a batch of dripping salad . Despite their decidedly unconventional techniques , Underwood Ranches began getting an increasing number of orders for the salad mix . To fill them , Roberts and his employees would often spend all evening packing crates . They would pull the refrigerated trucks in a tight circle , turn_on the headlights and work in the resulting glare . &quot; It was an amazing period , &quot; Roberts said , chuckling at the memory . Now , of course , the salad preparation technology has become more sophisticated . Salad ingredients come straight from the field to the packinghouse in Camarillo , the hub of the Underwood Ranches ' operation . Because the leaves lose a day of shelf_life for each hour they sit in the sun , workers must cool the harvest immediately . &quot; It ' s a race to get_it cold as fast as you can , &quot; Roberts said . &quot; The worst thing you can do to a plant is cut it , because it ' s dying after you pick it. &quot; Cooling preserves the lettuce for weeks . Some greens get an icy 20-minute shower under a waterfall ( known officially as a hydrocooler ) . Others are draped with tarps and placed in front of a giant suction machine that whips cold air through the leaves . Once cooled , the greens are dumped into a trough of water set at a specific temperature , with exact levels of chlorine and a precise acidity . Workers swirl the lettuce in first one basin , then another . Finally , the salad is dried in a high-tech version of the laundry machines and packed into plastic-lined boxes . A few orders are shipped Federal Express to finicky chefs who demand fresh-from-the-field produce daily . Other boxes are loaded onto trucks ferrying cargo to local supermarket chains , including Lucky , Ralphs , Hughes and Vons . By avoiding both middlemen and shipping costs , area supermarkets can sell Underwood salad by the pound for several dollars less than retailers elsewhere in the country . But the bulk of the salad is rushed each evening to the Los Angeles Produce Market , which shakes awake just after midnight . From there , the Camarillo-bred greens embark_on a convoluted -- yet weirdly efficient -- journey to supermarkets , restaurants and specialty groceries across the United States and as far away as Canada and Hong Kong . * In an East Los Angeles warehouse , Jim Ptaszenski adds the third of six price markups to a passel of gourmet greens from Conejo Ranch . The salad has traveled just 55 miles from the emerald field at the base of the Conejo Grade . But already the price has jumped more_than 110 % above the cost of producing the ready-to-eat mix . And that ' s just the beginning . In all , the price of a salad may jump nearly 220 % above Underwood Ranches ' production_cost by the time it arrives_at a far-flung dinner_table . To get there , it has to go_through a bewildering number of middlemen . The industry jargon sounds like so_much gobbledygook . A box of Conejo Ranch greens hits a terminal marketer , a produce consolidator , a regional distributor , a wholesale jobber and a local retailer before reaching a consumer . Or , in plain English : To get their salad to a grocery_store in Des Moines , Iowa , the Underwood partners start by shipping it to the Los Angeles Produce Market , where they sell it to a terminal marketer , such_as Alan Pollack . Pollack ' s company , Coosemans , specializes in off-beat vegetables . He buys the specialty items from local and foreign growers , bundles them together in variety packs , and then trucks them down the street to another middleman , known as a consolidator . The consolidator packs the gourmet items from Coosemans along with produce department standards , such_as iceberg_lettuce and yellow cooking onions . He ' ll then ship the whole carton by air to a regional distributor in Chicago . In Chicago , the distributor will sort and repack the California produce , perhaps adding tomatoes from Florida or potatoes from Idaho . Yet another truck will take the newly configured load to a &quot; jobber &quot; in Des Moines -- basically , a wholesaler with a large warehouse . Retailers will then buy directly from the jobbers , adding the sixth and final markup before passing the veggies to consumers . All that for a bowl of salad . Ironically , cutting middlemen would cripple the distribution system ' s efficiency . If a consolidator firm in Los Angeles tried to supply the Des Moines store directly , it would have to send half-empty trucks -- a waste_of_time , fuel and labor . By shipping to a big-city wholesaler instead , the company ensures full cargo loads . The round-about system suits grocery managers as well . &quot; Each grocery_store carries 350 to 400 items of produce , and each grower will traditionally grow no more_than 10 , &quot; Athanassiadis explained . &quot; It ' s not economically feasible for a small Des Moines store to send trucks each week to 35 different growers in California and Florida. &quot; Hence the need for Jim Ptaszenski ' s brick-walled warehouse in East Los Angeles . Ptaszenski receives truckloads of fruits and vegetables each morning from the L.A. Produce Market and packs them to ship to wholesalers across the country . One recent early morning , as smears of pale blue spread across the star-flecked sky , Ptaszenski took_off his telephone headset and bounded down a rickety staircase to his loading room . Boxes of Underwood Ranches carrots mingled with other fresh produce on the clean-swept floor , the pile dwindling rapidly as a worker packed the vegetables into an airplane shipping crate . One full crate costs roughly $ 500 to send across the country -- except during the Christmas season , when airlines carry so many cards for the Postal Service that they have little room for produce cargo . Squeezing a 3 # 000-pound crate of carrots and salad onto a commercial carrier during the Christmas rush can cost up_to $ 1 # 000 , Ptaszenski said . * To keep orders flowing and shippers hustling , the partners at Underwood Ranches have to keep pushing for new customers . Mainly , that ' s Athanassiadis ' job . Once in a while , however , the others have to lend a hand . And when he gets the call , Craig Underwood invariably gets grumpy . A man who wears suits only to church , and even then reluctantly , Underwood must haul out his navy blazer and tie for national produce conventions twice a year . Even dressed in his Sunday_best , Underwood stays out of the spotlight , hovering at the fringe of his booth ' s Burgundy carpet ( a color chosen to reflect the rich reddish tones of the radicchio captured in a close-up photo of the salad mix ) . Uncomfortable with the schmoozing and socializing considered vital in the tight-knit produce industry , Underwood keeps a profile so low he seems to vanish in the hullabaloo of produce conventions . Take the recent hubbub at the San Diego Convention Center , for instance , during the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Assn ' s . 90th annual expo . Industry insiders strolled among 600 growers ' booths wearing suspenders brightened with chili_pepper motifs , ties strewn with feathery-topped carrots , sweaters decorated with knit eggplants and onions . At the Sunkist display , convention-goers putted golf_balls through a spinning orange-shaped gate , while an electronic clock ticked_off how many pieces of citrus have been sold this fiscal_year ( 20 # 300 , 000 and counting ) . At the Dole counter , people waiting for free salad grinned at a dancing banana in red running_shoes . Elsewhere , they tapped their feet to live mariachi music , grabbed handfuls of free refrigerator magnets , and stormed past the display of extra-strong rubber_bands . Meanwhile , Underwood stood_in the corner and smiled weakly . &quot; I ' m a terrible salesperson , &quot; he said , looking slightly dazed as crowds pressed around his booth . &quot; I just hide and let my wife do all_the work. &quot; that ' s fine with Sara Jane Underwood , a registered nurse who has worked for the family_business the past 36 years as a bookkeeper , saleswoman , farmer ' s market representative and more . Her specialty : lurking in supermarkets back home_in Ventura County and pouncing on shoppers in the produce sections who load their carts with the &quot; wrong &quot; brand of salad or carrots . The San Diego produce expo offered few opportunities for guerrilla tactics . But there was plenty of time for what marketing manager Dana Abercrombie called &quot; the Sherlock_Holmes bit &quot; -- sleuthing out the competition . As she strolled through the crowded convention center , Abercrombie scanned each booth for new marketing ideas . Usually , she found more to criticize than to emulate . &quot; Their boxes don ' t match their company colors , &quot; she carped . &quot; Their booth doesn ' t look pulled_together . They gotta think_about the carpet. &quot; While Abercrombie evaluated the aesthetics , Athanassiadis scrutinized the vegetables . As usual . &quot; Minos is obsessed with produce , &quot; said his wife , Tracey Athanassiadis , who works for a Santa Monica advertising_agency . &quot; If I send him into the supermarket for a carton of milk , he stays for half an hour . He always has to check_out the competition. &quot; Sometimes , ironically , that competition is actually another Underwood Ranches ' product . To satisfy some big-ticket wholesalers , who like to claim exclusive distribution rights to select products , the Underwood partners now market their carrots under several labels . The ready-to-eat baby carrots , for instance , are sold through one wholesaler as Sweet Petite and through another as Melissa ' s . Un-peeled carrots with fluffy green tops also come_in two varieties identical but for the name : Underwood Ranches and Las Posas Valley . Sometimes side-by-side on a single supermarket ' s shelf , sometimes cross-town rivals , the dueling labels compete with each other , and could confuse customers . But the complications are outweighed , Athanassiadis said , by the benefits : Packaging the produce differently satisfies large wholesalers , who account_for nearly half of Underwood Ranches ' sales . * At the San Diego produce convention , the Underwood Ranches ' sales pros were seeking to boost the retail side of the business , trolling for big-ticket customers . They found a potential boon in Lynn Stogsdill , the tall and burly chief buyer for Walt Disney World . Swinging by the Underwood Ranches ' booth , Stogsdill plucked a scrawny Sweet Petite carrot from a woven basket of freebies . He nibbled . &quot; Looks_like an interesting product , &quot; he said , still chewing as he walked_off . Not exactly a bells-and-whistles endorsement . But a prize nonetheless . Just having Stogsdill ' s card in_hand was enough to encourage Abercrombie . Mind racing , she pictured a health-food stand at Walt Disney World . A pushcart vendor hawking snack-packs of Sweet Petites . A restaurant salad_bar crammed with baby carrots . Already , Stogsdill buys some Underwood Ranches ' salad for Walt Disney World in Florida , tossing the gourmet mix onto a_few restaurant menus . If he could get excited about the carrots . . . &quot; He ( Stogsdill ) could really put us on the map , &quot; said Steve Schiedermayer , the advertising executive in_charge of marketing Sweet Petites . But sales manager Athanassiadis remains wary . &quot; We don ' t want to go crazy , to get drunk with the name of ( potential customers ) or the potential volume , &quot; Athanassiadis said . &quot; We don ' t want to lose credibility by not being able to fill an order. &quot; Already , though , some competitors suspect he ' ll be unable to resist the challenge . And indeed , back home_in Ventura County after three days at the produce convention , Athanassiadis sounded enthusiastic about his conversations with Disney and another potentially big customer , an upscale New Jersey supermarket . Within a_few weeks , he ' ll design prototype carrot snack packs for the Disney buyer and seek new , customer-friendly ways to package beets and turnips for the New Jersey grocers . All in all , Athanassiadis said , he ' s reasonably satisfied with the produce convention . But partner Underwood was less enthusiastic . &quot; We probably won ' t do that show next year , because we ended_up talking more to our competition and our booth neighbors than to potential customers , &quot; Underwood said . The three-day produce convention cost the business roughly $ 4 # 000 , between hotel_rooms , meals and other expenses . On top of that , the booth itself -- a stand-alone counter and a backdrop plastered with a close-up photo of Underwood produce -- cost a hefty $ 7 # 000 . &quot; If we just confirm a_couple_of customers , that ' ll make_up for the price , &quot; Underwood said . &quot; But it ' s kind of questionable if it ' s worth the money. &quot; Still a small business , with just three full-time sales and marketing staff_members , Underwood Ranches spends only $ 40 # 000 a year on promotion . That tab includes two produce conventions , scattered advertising in trade magazines , supermarket demonstrations and visits to potential customers . Abercrombie , the marketing manager , jumps at any chance to gain additional exposure . In San Diego , she happily doled_out free carrots and salad to anyone who wandered by the booth , from grandmothers to toddlers . &quot; I like to have our products circulating in the industry , with our bag , our name , and our address on them , &quot; she said . &quot; It shows we ' re a player. &quot; THE FIRST HARVEST Conejo Ranch farmers began harvesting their gourmet greens in January . The lettuce is tossed into a gourmet salad mix that is distributed to customers in the United States , Canada and Hong Kong . While some salad gets shipped overnight express to restaurants , most is sent_on a convoluted route that begins at the Los Angeles Produce Market . Produce Market Route Bagged salad stays_fresh only 10 days , so quick distribution is essential . Still , the produce goes_through six middlemen before reaching the consumer . 1 ) Lettuce is transported by refrigerated trucks to Los Angeles Produce Market , usually arriving by midnight in time for the market ' s opening at 1 a.m. Underwood sells box for : $ 9.35 2 ) Lettuce is sold to a warehouse distributor known as the terminal market wholesaler . Wholesaler sells box for : $ 11.25 3 ) Lettuce is bundled with produce from other growers and trucked to a nearby consolidator . Consolidator sells box for : $ 16.00 4 ) Consolidator packs gourmet items along with standard produce such_as iceberg_lettuce and ships carton by air to a regional distributor in Chicago . Distributor sells box for : $ 17.00 5 ) Distributor in Chicago repacks produce . The new package is trucked to a &quot; jobber &quot; -- a warehouse wholesaler . Wholesaler sells box for : $ 18.00 6 ) Retailer or restaurant buys produce directly from jobber and sells to consumer . Market sells 1 pound of greens for : $ 8.00 Restaurant sells 4-ounce salad for : $ 5.00 A Day ( and a Half ) in the Life of a Salad : How a Box of Greens Gets from Field to Table By shipping Federal Express , Underwood Ranches can supply fresh greens to restaurants across the country in less than 30 hours from picking . This timeline and map follow the trail of salad_greens from Conejo Ranch , on the outskirts of Camarillo , to a restaurant table in Pittsburgh : 6 a.m. Picking : Crews begin cutting lettuce . They use stainless_steel knives , assessing quality of plants and carefully handling the easily bruised leaves . Lettuce is put into basket after being cut . 7 a.m. Cooling : The baskets are emptied into large bins and taken_to the nearby packing facility . To extend the life of the greens , they are showered for 20 minutes in 38- to 40-degree water , or moved_into a refrigerated building where they are placed in front of a machine that sucks cold air from the room through the leaves . 9 a.m. Washing : Greens are dumped into large tanks of chlorinated water where they receive two thorough washings . To ensure cleanliness , workers wear long sanitary gloves , boots and bonnets . Masks with charcoal filters protect against chlorine fumes . 10 a.m. Drying : The lettuce is dried in an electric machine , similar to a kitchen salad spinner , that spins the greens , throwing excess water off the leaves . 11 a.m. Packing : Lettuce is then dumped into a large plastic crate and packed into plastic-lined boxes . 2 p.m. Shipping : The boxes are loaded into refrigerated Federal Express trucks for delivery to LAX , then flown to Pittsburgh via Memphis . The following day . . . Lettuce arrives_at the Pittsburgh restaurant by 10:30 a.m. and is served that evening . The Product Conejo Ranch grows these three types of gourmet greens , which are mixed with nine other ingredients to form Underwood Ranches ' Sweet Petite salads . Arugula : Its peppery taste gives a salad a kick . Mizuna : Its crunchy leaves add texture . Tatsol : Its nutty flavor gives a salad body .
