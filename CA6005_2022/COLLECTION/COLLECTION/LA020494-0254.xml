   <HEADLINE> RENO OKS FASTER ACCESS TO DEATH REPORT ON FOSTER ; INFORMATION : RULING COVERS ANY RECORDS TIED TO GOVERNMENT INTEGRITY OR HIGH NEWS INTEREST . BUT THE RECORDS ON THE LAWYER ' S SUICIDE REMAIN UNRELEASED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Criticized for withholding documents about a White_House lawyer ' s suicide , Atty . Gen . Janet Reno authorized expedited release Thursday of records that bear_on the government ' s integrity and have high news interest . But the Park Police and FBI reports on attorney Vincent Foster ' s death still were not released , and Justice_Department spokesman Carl Stern said he had no way to predict when they would be . Before any release , Stern said , special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr . must review the records to be certain that their release will not hinder his investigation . At President Clinton ' s request , Reno appointed Fiske last week to look_into all matters related to Clinton ' s investment in a failed Arkansas land_development , its links to a failed Arkansas savings and loan and any related matters , including Foster ' s death . Documents related to the Whitewater land_development were found in Foster ' s office after his death July 20 . The FBI investigated the belated discovery and handling of a torn-up note by Foster critical of the FBI and other Washington institutions . Foster was found shot to death in a suburban park , and the Park Police ruled it a suicide . The New York Times reported in today ' s editions that federal law_enforcement officials who have seen the U.S. Park Police report said it suggests that Bernard Nussbaum , counsel to the President , impeded the investigation . The officials , who were not identified , told the newspaper that the report shows Nussbaum interfered with interviews by directing that White_House lawyers sit in on them -- a charge that has been reported previously . Nussbaum has said the Park Police never objected to any of his actions . The Wall_Street Journal filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York last week to get the Foster documents , arguing that the Justice_Department had &quot; constructively and improperly denied &quot; their release . Reno ordered a new category of records eligible for expedited release under the Freedom of Information Act . FOIA requests for FBI documents routinely take_up to two years to be processed ; requests for Justice_Department documents have a six-month backlog . Requests would be moved to the top of the list for processing if the Justice_Department ' s public affairs director concluded that there was &quot; exceptional media interest &quot; and the records involve &quot; questions about the government ' s integrity which affect public confidence. &quot; The goal is &quot; to permit the public to make a prompt and informed assessment of the propriety of the government ' s actions in exceptional cases , &quot; Reno ' s implementing directive said . Stern said that Reno ' s policy applies immediately to all Justice agencies and that she would use her authority to recommend that all agencies of the executive_branch adopt similar policies . Previously , expedited release was available only for documents needed to prevent physical harm or to avoid a loss of rights , such_as missing a deadline to file a damage claim . At a news_conference , Reno also disputed fired FBI Director William S . Sessions ' assertion that a power struggle kept the bureau out of investigating Foster ' s death . Sessions was fired by Clinton the day before the death .</TEXT>
