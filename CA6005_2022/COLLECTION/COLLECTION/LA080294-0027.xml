   <HEADLINE> NEXT STEP ; TURKEY ' S SEASON OF DISCONTENT ; BORN-AGAIN DEMOCRATS ARE DISAPPOINTED WITH NEW PRIME_MINISTER TANSU CILLER , CORRUPTION AND THE ARMY ' S GRIP ON GOVERNMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If everyone had not been so well-dressed and polite , the meeting would certainly have been deemed subversive . Even an old Marxist saying boomed down from loudspeakers around the stage of the elegant concert_hall , the adage about the people having nothing to lose but their chains . But the speaker was loosening no more_than the smart executive tie around his unbuttoned collar . Cem Boyner is one of Turkey ' s richest textile manufacturers , doing business with Italy ' s Benetton and Levi-Strauss in the United States . Yet he is fast becoming the best known of Turkey ' s born-again democrats . &quot; Turkey needs a revolution in mentality . The mega-state is bankrupt . Turkey has to make a choice between enlightened democracy and an oppressive dictatorship , &quot; Boyner told his audience , launching a frontal assault on the taboos of a 70-year-old republic long-dominated by strait-laced military and civilian bureaucracies . He hit the spot . Applause swelled from the audience of a_thousand of the best and brightest in Turkey ' s thirty-something generation , who are fed up with corrupt politicians and an ideologically and financially bankrupt system of government . &quot; Everyone talks like this between themselves . At last somebody is saying it out loud , &quot; said ship Capt . Alev Tunc , 36 . The friend who had brought him to the meeting , educational counselor Ayse Buyukdora , agreed . &quot; It ' s like a dream , &quot; she said . &quot; We are gathering around an idea . Everything is very new , very different , against the system . The public is ready for these things . The movement will grow very quickly. &quot; Boyner , 39 , is one of a number of new Young_Turks trying to shake their country awake before it is drowned by the ethnic and religious conflicts that have overwhelmed the regions all around them : the Balkans , the Caucasus and the Middle_East . In many ways , Boyner , whose listeners had gathered to hear him promote the New Democracy Movement of which he is spokesman , fills a void left by last year ' s sudden_death of Turkish leader Turgut Ozal . The New Democracy Movement is one of dozens of such groups and networks that have sprung_up in Turkey over the past year : Forty have been counted in Istanbul alone . &quot; The Wave From the Deep &quot; and &quot; Civilians Rise Up &quot; are just a_few of the series on the phenomenon that have been run_by Turkish newspapers . They track groups interested in everything from human_rights to Istanbul ' s dwindling water_supply . Some are led by open-minded retired generals , others by angry young members of the Greens . &quot; I think_of my movement as a cross between free-masonry and an Islamic brotherhood , &quot; said Tinaz Titiz , Ozal ' s long-serving minister of tourism whose White Point Assn . aims to educate , enlighten and bring probity to all aspects of Turkish life . In an Istanbul suburb of half-finished concrete buildings , messy back alleys and hectic street life , the headquarters of Boyner ' s New Democracy Movement gives little clue to its fast-rising profile . But with more_than 6 # 000 members gathered_in just a_few months , mainly from the young elite of business , academia and professional_life , it is now probably the biggest of the new groups . The same groundswell for change was discerned last year when traditionally conservative politicians from Anatolia chose the dashing Tansu Ciller to be Turkey ' s first woman prime_minister . But Ciller has since disappointed many Turks with her headstrong style and reliance for support on the powerful Turkish army . Her True Path party could muster only 21 % support in nationwide local elections in March , and that was the biggest share of the vote , showing what a splintered mess the Turkish political_system is in . Left-wing parties that traditionally see themselves as progressive have collapsed . And fed by wide-reaching political debate on private television_stations , the sense of ferment is unprecedented . An idea of the sense of national disgust with the system came when the newspaper Milliyet last month reported that 69 % of Turks thought the government was unsuccessful , 58 % thought the opposition was useless , and 70 % did not trust Ciller . Ironically , the first to profit in elections has been the Welfare Party , which has been organizing the Islamic vote under various names since the 1970s . With a strong local organization and alleged backing from conservative Arab states , it is determined to bring Turkey ' s 60 million people closer to their Islamic roots . The Islamics ' share of the vote rose to a record 19 % in the March elections , not only because their candidates were seen as honest and hard-working , but also because their party offered an alternative with the slogan &quot; a new system. &quot; But the Islamics ' &quot; new system &quot; remains undefined . Author Rusen Cakir described the enigma in the title of his book , &quot; Neither Democracy nor Islamic Sharia Law. &quot; Turkey ' s secular majority became increasingly suspicious that it would have an intolerant Iranian-style Islamic regime forced upon it . Car_window stickers have told the story of a society divided : Those declaring &quot; Peace_of_mind is in Islam &quot; or &quot; Islam rules &quot; vied with others saying &quot; O Father , we follow in your steps , &quot; referring to the uncompromising secularism of the early 20th-Century nationalist Mustafa Kemal , called Ataturk , which means Father of the Turks . The upper_classes , increasingly closeted behind the walls of their luxury compounds , were worried by the conflict . The secularism drummed into young_Turks ' heads by the school_system were no longer enough to keep society on an even keel . And many modern-minded women were frightened by the Islamics ' rising fortunes ; at meetings of the New Democracy Movement , half the audience is female . &quot; The elections showed that our rose garden was surrounded by sewage , &quot; said a woman bank official . &quot; I wanted to do something . I don ' t want to have to wear a head scarf . The trouble is , I have a bank to run . I don ' t have time to get_out door-stepping the suburbs , while the Islamic women can get_out there. &quot; Most of the new groups do not want to form regular parties , and the idea is controversial even in the New Democracy Movement . But Boyner and his wife , Umit , have moved off the society pages of glossy magazines and are determined to unite the political center . The New Democracy Movement is trying to collect and synthesize different political tendencies under one party roof -- a feat not pulled_off since Ozal ' s heyday in the 1980s -- and to attract strong leaders . It is also trying to be a common home to all_the ethnic_groups of Anatolia , the vast Turkish heartland . Crisscrossing the poor towns of Anatolia , the Boyners and the movement ' s other leaders have already visited more_than half of Turkey ' s provinces on trips that are usually organized by groups of young businessmen and women . Sometimes the talk_of commerce goes a little too far : Boyner tends to talk_about gaps in the market , and complex , computer-generated overhead projections make them seem like a sales staff trying to peddle a new soap_powder . But the movement ' s agenda is clear -- and similar to that of other democratic groups : political reforms to end the bloody conflicts between the Turkish army and the Kurds in the eastern provinces ; privatization and sale of state lands ; a more democratic constitution ; compromise with moderate Islamic groups and freedom_of_religion for all faiths . &quot; We want to turn the whole_thing upside-down , &quot; Boyner told reporters . Paradoxically , he believes that some of his most important help may come from people inside the system like himself . &quot; There are many people in the army , police and the Establishment who also want to change. &quot;</TEXT>
