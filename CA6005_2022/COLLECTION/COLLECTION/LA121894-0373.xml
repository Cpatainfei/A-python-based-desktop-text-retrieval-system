   <TEXT> Artesia Bakery , 18627 S . Pioneer Blvd. , Artesia . ( 310 ) 865-1201 . Open 7 a.m. to 6:30 p.m every day until Dec . 25 . Regular hours : 7 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. * Sixth-generation Dutch baker Maurius Lakeman runs the Artesia Bakery pretty much as his immigrant father did . By 4 a.m. , he and his sons Benny and Cornelius are already in the shop checking on the proofed bread_dough and mixing_up mountainous batches of Dutch-style cookies . Their busy Christmas schedule is even more demanding than their ordinary routine . Lakeman gets_out the wooden molds his father brought from Holland to make the hand-molded anise-cake Santas and extra batches of fanciful speculaas cookie figurines . Out in front , where his wife Iona and daughters Rene and Brenda-Sue do much of the selling , abundant cookie-filled cellophane bags glimmer from the counter tops and a lingering perfume of ginger and cardamom suffuses the air . As they do each year , the Lakemans have set_out their Christmas display on a table by the window . The festive setting includes almond-filled pastry wreaths gaily studded with red and green candied cherries and almond spice_cake . Whimsical miniature animals and gleaming fruits molded in marzipan display a centuries-old art that captures the magic and pageantry of an old-fashioned European Christmas . * So what is a traditional Dutch bakery doing here on Artesia Boulevard , amid the Indian restaurants and shops that make_up the section of Southern California now known as Little India -- not to mention the Mexican carnicerias , Korean restaurants and Asian supermarkets within shouting distance ? And how does_it survive ? Herein lies a tale of the Southland ' s history . &quot; For most people in Los Angeles -- especially relative newcomers -- it ' s probably impossible to believe that dairy herds roamed right past Woodruff and South streets not more_than 20 years ago , &quot; says Lakeman , whose father bought the bakery in 1952 . Lakeman was 17 when his family came from Rotterdam to escape economically depressed times in post-World War II Europe . His family was among the second wave of Dutch immigrants to settle in Norwalk , Artesia , Bellflower and Lakewood ; the first wave had come_around the time of World_War I . With a Dutch community that exceeded 100 # 000 , the neighborhood had Dutch churches and schools , and until the ' 50s ( thanks to dairy_farmers with names like Vanderham and Van Leeuwen ) , it was the largest milk-producing region in the state . * Vestiges of this rural past are still in_evidence around here : Appel ' s Tractor Service is still located near Pioneer Boulevard in Norwalk , and the George Verhoven Feed company is in nearby Artesia . But most of the dairymen have either retired or moved to Chino and Riverside , where cows still graze . Artesia Bakery maintains a small wholesale business , supplying its wares to mostly Dutch specialty shops around Southern California and even_out of state . But inevitably , progress has changed its clientele . Does Lakeman think a Dutch bakery in Artesia is an endangered species ? &quot; Well , &quot; he says , after briefly pondering the question , &quot; in ' 73 we tripled the size of the bakery. &quot; An increasingly dense population translated into more customers , who apparently approve of the bakery ' s fresh breads and extremely popular ice_cream cakes . &quot; But sometimes , &quot; Lakeman says with a sigh , &quot; it ' s impossible to fill all_of our new customers ' requests . They have so many religious and cultural needs -- like wanting cake without eggs . All in all , though , we have more customers , even though some of them might not celebrate Christmas as we do. &quot; Shopping List CHRISTMAS ITEMS According to Dutch tradition , Santa Claus ( Sinterklaas ) makes his appearance on Saint Nicholas ' Eve , the fifth night of December . Unlike Christmas itself , the day is not a religious one ; everyone celebrates it . Usually there is a special dinner and Sinterklaas arrives on horseback with his helper , Svart Piet , throwing handfuls of pepernoten ( little cake-like spiced anise_cookies ) into the room for children to catch . This ritual is still played_out in Southern California , staged by the Holland Soccer Club of Paramount , which also doubles as a Dutch family social_organization . The club has three men ' s teams and women ' s and children ' s teams . Benny Lakeman says , &quot; The club turns Saint Nicholas ' Eve into a very big deal. &quot; Parents submit their kids ' gift requests to the club ' s shopping committee , which readies the presents . Club president Pete Hordyk assumes the role of Sinterklaas in all his traditional finery . He throws the pepernoten -- baked by the Artesia Bakery , of course -- for the children to catch . Then the good kids get presents and ( theoretically , at least ) the naughty ones get warnings . Children whose parents shop_at Artesia Bakery might find any of the following Christmas specialties at their next Saint Nicholas Eve celebration . Pepernoten and Taai Taai Santas : Pepernoten may have been the very first Dutch cookie . Culinary historians say it was originally just a tiny blob of dough that a baker used to test the oven . Pepernoten ' s unique cookie dough , called taai taai ( &quot; chewy-chewy &quot; ) , is made by boiling a mixture of honey , molasses , ground anise seeds and cinnamon , then stirring in rye flour . This process , combined with the dough ' s lack of eggs and minimum of butter or shortening , produces a cookie with a chewy texture . Pepernoten are closely related to German pfeffernusse ( both words mean &quot; pepper nuts &quot; ) , but you ' ll find that Artesia ' s pepernoten don ' t have the relentlessly strong flavor of their German cousins . The same cookie dough also gets pressed into carved wooden molds to make Santa-shaped figures that are traditionally placed at the table setting of each guest on St . Nicholas Eve . Dutch Chocolate Initials : Artesia Bakery has sold the Van Der Mere chocolate company that it once owned , but still carries the wonderful large chocolate block_letters that were the small company ' s specialty . The six-inch-high letters are extremely popular children ' s stocking stuffers . Kerst-Kransen : These pastries come_in two shapes and several sizes : rings ( one , two or three pounds ) and logs ( large or small ) . Inside a thin wrapping of flaky dough is a center of Artesia Bakery ' s creamy almond paste . This is one of the Christmas items the bakery offers all year -- something unheard-of in Europe , where the eating of certain foods at a certain time_of_year is firmly fixed by custom . There ' s one bow to tradition : At Christmas , kerst-kransen are sold under their Dutch name , decorated with red and green cherries . The rest of the year they ' re labeled &quot; almond delight &quot; and sold either plain or garnished with red cherries . Almond Paste : Freshly made in the bakery all year long , the almond paste that goes_into many of Artesia Bakery ' s pastries and cookies may be purchased for home use . Unlike most commercially prepared almond pastes , which are often very sweet and strong tasting , this one , a blend of cooked ground_almonds , sugar and eggs , is creamy and delicate . &quot; Some commercial almond pastes contain too_much sugar and will leak_out of a pastry or cookie as it bakes , &quot; observes Lakeman . Having subjected Artesia Bakery ' s almond paste-filled raisin_bread to mercilessly high heat , I can report that Artesia ' s almond paste will not leak or melt . Marzipan and Marzipan Candies : Marzipan fashioned into figurines has long been an essential part of Northern European Christmas . By the way , people often confuse almond paste with marzipan ; at Artesia Bakery I learned they ' re not the same . Marzipan is considerably sweeter and has the addition of the strong , alcohol-based flavoring called marisquin . Lakeman imports this very special flavoring from Holland . Artesia Bakery sells both the uncolored marzipan and the colored candy shapes . Gevulde Speculaas : This dense , ginger-spiced cake has a thick layer of almond paste sandwiched between its two layers . When it ' s sliced , the compact cake , topped lavishly with whole roasted almonds , is rather more like a bar cookie than a cake . Almond-Filled Raisin_Bread : Spijsbrood , the Dutch name for this confection , is not a very accurate description . This &quot; spice bread &quot; is simply a delicious ( and not spiced ) raisin- and currant-filled bread with a cylinder of almond paste at its center . The prescribed way to enjoy spijsbrood is to toast it and spread the almond paste over the surface of the toast . The bakery ' s Dutch-style Stollen is virtually the same dough and filling , but formed into the familiar flat , folded stollen loaf . Speculaas : Recipes for speculaas cookies , with their intricate embossed designs , have been closely guarded secrets handed_down through generations . Along the way , speculaas has evolved from a softer-shaped ginger bread into the crisp , spiced_cookie it is now . The original cookies were embellished by hand-stamping a design onto the dough . Eventually machines were invented with bronze wheels that could roll , cut and stamp the cookies all at once . The bakery ' s cookie-stamping machine , imported from Holland , looks quaint but cranks_out up_to 400 cookies a minute , depending_on the weight of the dough and the size of the cookie . At Christmas , people snap_up the bakery ' s large decorative speculaas figurines shaped like a Dutch boy and Dutch girl . Small speculaas Santas come_with peanuts mixed into their dough . Medium-sized Dutch boy figurines and assorted small shapes are other speculaas favorites . Butter Speculaas : For another version of speculaas , made with additional butter , the bakers omit the usual spices . The cookies are more fragile and , of course , have a pronounced butter flavor . BREADS Artesia ' s white and wheat breads are fine loaves with a sturdy crumb . On weekends the bakery turns_out a round French-style loaf and hard-crusted rolls . But it ' s the more unusual rogge rye and raisin_bread that make the bakery worth a special trip . Rogge Rye : This marvelous and unusual dense bread is reminiscent_of the thinly sliced whole pumpernickel breads of Germany . Lakeman says this version is a specialty of Friesland , the north Netherlands province from which his wife ' s family hails . The bread is made from a mixture of soaked chopped whole rye and rye_bread trimmings , baked in wood-lined pans for five hours . I imagine the long , slow cooking is responsible_for the bread ' s sweet , nutty flavor and deep color . It is a substantial bread that really stays with you , yet has absolutely no oil or other fat . Raisin_Bread : Like those cereals that advertise more raisins per spoonful , Artesia ' s raisin_bread has more raisins per slice . Some of the fruity brown flecks are actually tinier currants . &quot; They disperse more evenly throughout the dough , &quot; says Lakeman . CAKES AND PASTRIES Honey_Cake : This loaf-shaped cake , called honingkoek in Dutch , is clearly related to the_French pain d ' epices . It ' s made from rye flour , honey and a traditional spice mixture that the bakery imports in 57-pound bags . The simple formula contains no oil , an attribute that has won many fans . Honingkoek : It ' s often served for breakfast , as we might serve a doughnut with coffee . Well , not quite like a doughnut -- it ' s more like gingerbread . The slightly chewy texture softens when slices are wrapped in foil and gently warmed in the oven . Artesia Bakery makes honingkoek in four styles : plain , honey sucade ( flecked with candied citron ) , ginger-honey and double-ginger , studded with an extra portion of candied ginger . Look_for these in the cooler . Appelbollen : Crisp puff pastry surrounds a whole apple for these substantial little &quot; pies. &quot; The apple is stuffed with cinnamon sugar and the pastry washed with egg for a golden finish . Appelbollen are another Dutch seasonal treat ( traditional for New Year ' s Day ) that the bakery sells all year . Floppen : Squares of flaky pastry with a fruit or cheese filling , the Dutch answer to the Danish_pastry . The bakery usually has_on hand about half_a_dozen flavors including lemon , raspberry and a cream cheese-laced custard . Benny ' s Butter Fruit Cake : This cake is closer to a pound_cake than to English fruit cakes -- the ones that are mostly dried fruit held together with a smidgen of cake batter . Benny ' s simple all-butter cake is baked in a kugelhopf pan , strewn with a smattering of candied fruits and dusted with powdered sugar . Oliebollen : The ancestor of American doughnuts , oliebollen -- literally , &quot; oil buns &quot; -- look_like extra-large doughnut holes . &quot; It ' s hard to get the inside perfectly cooked , so that ' s probably why someone started cutting_out the centers , &quot; Lakeman speculates . They ' re yeast-leavened , with a_few bits of candied cherries and raisins in the dough . Watch_out , though -- sprinkled lightly with granulated sugar , they may look_like your average American doughnut , but they ' re considerably more substantial . Oliebollen are traditionally served on New Year ' s Eve and Day , but are also eaten all year round . Carees : Somewhat confusingly , these are labeled &quot; almond delights , &quot; just like the kerst-kransen . They ' re sophisticated little flaky pastry tarts filled with the bakery ' s own almond paste and topped with apricot preserves and sugar glaze . Cakes : The bakery does make American-type cakes decorated with aqua-blue roses and pink elephants ( sometimes ) . But even these are fashioned from pure butter frosting . Cakes here are layered with homemade custard filling , and whipped cream cakes get a topping of pure dairy whipped cream . COOKIES Artesia Bakery makes about 40 varieties of cookies . In this small sampling are a_few of my favorites . Hern Hutters : It ' s rare to find a commercially made cookie prepared exclusively with butter . The shelf_life would be short because pure butter_cookies turn rancid quickly , especially if no preservatives are used . So , butter-lover that I am , I was thrilled to find hern hutters . With their fluted shape , these Northern Dutch-style cookies are simply butter-laden , tart-shaped shortbreads . They are at their peak for a week or two and they freeze beautifully , if sealed_in their bag and tightly wrapped in foil . Disregard the ingredient information on the cellophane bag . These cookies contain no vegetable shortening . Butternut Cookies : This is another pure butter_cookie , slightly larger than an unshelled walnut . Butternuts are sturdy cookies that resemble sweet shortbread with finely chopped walnuts throughout . They also freeze well . Nougat Cookies : These thin , crisp cookies , with little nuggets of deeply caramelized sugar flecked throughout , melt in your mouth . Kletskoppen : The lacy almond_cookies , so thin they ' re almost sheer , are made from a simple blend of chopped almonds , shortening , flour and cinnamon . They can bring ordinary ice_cream to the level of a fancy restaurant dessert . Olympiades : Shaped like a plain biscuit , olympiades are very adult cookies , composed of two sweet short cookie layers baked around an almond paste center . Gevulde-Koek : Artesia Bakery calls this cookie &quot; almond delight , &quot; the same name it has already used for kerst-kransen and carees . It consists_of four-inch disks of soft cookie dough with a slight accent of lemon , filled with almond paste . They resemble the small pancakes that the Dutch are said to have brought_to America . Half and Half : Not-too-sweet crisp cookies are dipped halfway in dark Guittard chocolate . These delights are kept_in the cooler with the whipped cream cakes . Krakelingen : Cut from two puff pastry sheets rolled with sugar between them , krakelingen also go_by the name &quot; figure-eight cookies &quot; because they are twisted into a pretzel-like shape . Stengles : Puff pastry is also the base for these long pastry sticks sprinkled with sugar and peanuts . Vanilla Rosettes : For most of the year , the centers of these flower-shaped spritz cookies are garnished with a dab of fruit pastry filling . At Christmas they sport red or green fondant or a bright candied cherry half . John Hail : Several children of my acquaintance dubbed these cookies peanut barges because the thin rectangles of crisp cookie look_like boards with a cargo of chopped peanuts .</TEXT>
