   <HEADLINE> TAKING COMMAND ; GEN . PAUL A . RADER PLANS TO PREPARE THE SALVATION_ARMY FOR THE NEXT CENTURY WITH AN EYE ON TRADITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mention the Salvation_Army and many people think_of bell_ringers at Christmastime or uniformed musicians on street_corners playing brass instruments and waving tambourines . But for Gen . Paul A . Rader , the first native-born American to command the Salvation_Army worldwide , that image , although accurate , is too narrow . Best known for its social programs and disaster relief efforts , the Salvation_Army says that it is at heart an evangelical Christian_church . It is biblically conservative but socially active . Elected general July 23 , Rader said he is keenly aware that during his five-year term the 129-year-old Salvation_Army will be preparing to enter the next millennium . Until his election as general , Rader was the organization ' s territorial commander for the western United States with headquarters at Rancho Palos Verdes . He moved to his new headquarters in London this week . In a wide-ranging interview with Times religion writer Larry B . Stammer , Rader reflected on his faith , the challenges facing the 3 million officers , soldiers and members of the Salvation_Army , and his penchant for activism over reflections on doctrine . Following are excerpts : Question : For most people , an encounter with the Salvation_Army is with bell_ringers on street_corners . Are you bothered by the way the army is popularly perceived ? Rader : My No . 1 priority is to clarify our identity . . . to be seen as an evangelical part of the universal church of Christ . ( But ) the Salvation_Army is one of the most popular charities , thank God , in the United States . Q : Why the popularity ? Rader : I think because there have been a lot of people over the years who have worn this uniform well . They have acted with great compassion . They ' ve been there for people in a_thousand different situations : In Anaheim working with gangs . New York prostitutes . Hollywood runaways . Earthquake and flood relief in California and the Midwest . Hurricane relief in Florida . . . . You do that for 100 years and ( you ) build_up in the public a sense that the army can be trusted , that they ' re going to be there . Q : You spent 17 years in Korea with the army . Did that experience change you ? Rader : Profoundly . . . . The intensity of dedication of Korean Christians is a very impressive kind of thing ; their commitment to a life of prayer , their dissatisfaction with any kind of religious experience that doesn ' t produce results in their lives and in their communities . . . . Korean Christians always think in terms of what the Gospel means for the whole of their country . They ' re not thinking so . . . individually . Q : Are most churches looking inward ? Rader : I perhaps should only comment that we certainly see the necessity of working toward . . . the church being turned inside-out . . . . The tendency always is to move from the outside in , to be self-concerned and keep your fingers on your spiritual pulse and look_after your own personal well being and ignore the fact that the world is going_to hell in a handbasket . Our concern has been with what ' s happening on the street . . . . You ' re not commissioned to serve just a small congregation in the corner of some community . You ' re commissioned to that community . Everybody on the street , everybody in the hospital , everybody in the prison is part of your parish . You ' re responsible to reach people and to serve them in_love and compassion in the name and spirit of Christ . Q : What about the army ' s uniforms ? Rader : I don ' t think I ' m going_to make a decision to do_away_with uniforms , I can tell you that . But I think we have to give thought to how we wear it and where we wear it and why we wear it . . . . What the uniform says is , &quot; I ' m available. &quot; That puts you in the path of a lot of pain in the world . . . . We have thousands of people -- hundreds of thousands of people -- who are willing to wear this uniform . To say that to the world , I think , is quite a remarkable thing in these times . Q : Is your uniform a reminder that you ' re in &quot; spiritual warfare , &quot; that you ' re taking on &quot; principalities and powers ? &quot; Rader : It certainly intends to communicate that and to be a reminder to the whole church . I see us as a part of the whole evangelical church . We each bear our witness denominationally . I think those who are strongly Sacramentarian in tradition have an important witness to bear that enriches us all . Others who are more revivalistic or Pentecostal , I think , have a powerful testimony to bear . . . . But I think the army speaks_of the militancy of the church . . . . What I ' m concerned about is , are we really engaging evil in the world ? Are we really involved in the fight here ? Q : How do you define evil ? Rader : I believe_in a personal devil . I believe_in an evil , intelligent person in the universe that is operational and is a cause for a great_deal of the suffering , anguish and pain of the world . . . . We deal both with our capacity for greatness and the kind of glory that God intended for us and . . . our own sinfulness . . . that has created a great_deal of the suffering in the world . Q : Do you see the fall from innocence recorded in the Genesis account of Adam and Eve as literal historical truth , or myth that conveys a transcendent truth ? Rader : I see it as literal truth myself . I have no problem with that at all . . . . Something occurred there , whatever form it took . There was something there and there was a transaction taken there that has had a dire effect on human history ever since . The result has been this sadness and evil and death and suffering that we see all about us in the world . Q : Those outside the army rarely hear of internal controversies over doctrinal issues or Bible interpretation . Rader : We have a very clear doctrinal statement . . . . Our message is based on the Bible . . . . We ' re very activist in what we do . But to support that adequately with an understanding of why we do_it from a biblical and theological point_of_view is important . . . . There is more conservatism theologically now than at some points in the past . Q : Why ? Rader : I think some parts of the army ( were ) enamored with liberal perspectives and it sort of filtered down , particularly in certain groupings . But what keeps bringing us back toward center is we ' re very focused on task , mission and evangelism . You can ' t sustain that very long , in my view , with a liberal theological perspective . I think you ' re going to drift away from it . You ' re going to lose your evangelistic zeal . Q : What is your view of AIDS and homosexuality ? Rader : We ' re not into judging people on the basis of how they got_into that kind of a situation ( AIDS ) . There are a variety of reasons . . . . But we all know that a great majority of those . . . are infected because of homosexual activity . that ' s just a statistical reality . . . . We don ' t believe it ' s morally acceptable as a lifestyle . . . . But at_the_same_time , not only with_regard_to homosexual behavior , but a whole range of behaviors , we have reached_out in_love to people who have done all sorts of things -- whether they ' re murderers or prostitutes or whatever they are . . . . We ' re going to try to help them find a way to a satisfying , God-honoring kind of life . Q : Have you ever had a &quot; wilderness experience &quot; in your life , a crisis of faith or doubt ? Rader : You know , I ' m a true believer . I have to say that I have not struggled with doubt . I ' ve had questions over the years , of course . I ' ve spent a lifetime encounter with Scripture and tried to sort through those questions and find answers . I think maybe I live more comfortably with the uncertainties of faith than some people do . . . . We all have a lot that when we get_to heaven we want to ask God about . . . . My own faith in Christ has been reinforced over the years and strengthened by what I ' ve seen of the faithfulness of God in so many circumstances , reflected in peoples ' lives of great courage and devotion . That sustains you in times when you can ' t understand what it is God is up_to . Q : There were only two women on the 45-member High Council that elected you . Do you see patriarchy as a problem to be addressed or a tradition to be affirmed ? Rader : A problem to be addressed . It was only an accident of history that only two women were_on the High Council . . . . I hope that doesn ' t happen again and I ' ll do what I can to prevent it from happening . . . . Traditionally , we have kind of led the pack_on women in ministry all across the world . Half of our women are ordained . Half of our officers are ordained women and they ' re functional . They ' re preaching . They ' re ministering .</TEXT>
