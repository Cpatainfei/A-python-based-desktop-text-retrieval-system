   <TEXT> Tilton Jones is not an extremist . He ' s not even a vegetarian . But when he was offered a room in what will become one of America ' s only self-sustaining , environmentally correct communities , he accepted the offer without hesitation . What separates Jones from the rest of wasteful America is his attitude more_than anything else , he said . &quot; My lifestyle hasn ' t changed that much . What ' s changed is that I ' m living with a group of pioneers trying to live a different ( way ) . &quot; Jones ' new home is the Center for Regenerative Studies -- sometimes called &quot; Biosphere without a lid , &quot; in a reference_to the much-publicized $ 150-million Biosphere II in Arizona . On 16 acres surrounded by walnut_trees atop a hill on the Cal Poly Pomona campus , 18 students , a resident manager and one visiting scholar live_in several energy-efficient buildings , trying to build and sustain a community that will eventually recycle or reuse all its waste , grow its own food and stop using fossil_fuel . &quot; We ' re more realistic than Biosphere , &quot; said Jones , 31 , a mechanical_engineering major from Hawthorne . &quot; We don ' t live_in a bubble . We can come and go as we like . I ' m a realistic environmentalist . I realize you just can ' t take_away people ' s conveniences. &quot; Instead , Jones and the other center residents are creating energy-efficient alternatives they hope will be convenient enough for consumers to use . Eventually , 90 people will live_in the center and research ways to waste fewer of the Earth ' s expensive and exhaustible natural_resources . Jones expects to stay three years . By the time his stint is up , he hopes the community will waste nothing . The resident students -- from a variety of disciplines -- will have learned how to recycle human_waste , build rooftop gardens and completely convert to solar_power , among other things . &quot; We ' ve been given the foundation , and we ' re trying to make_it grow from there , &quot; Jones said . The center &quot; wasn ' t outfitted for recycling and solar_energy . We have to put it together . We have to make_it work . We ' ve been given the dream and a_few of the materials. ' The idea for the center was born in 1976 . Prof . John Lyle , who teaches landscape_architecture , said he thought , &quot; We need to design an environment according to ecological principles so that civilization can survive. &quot; Right now , he said , &quot; the world ' s not on the right track. &quot; Eventually , Lyle and others were able to secure $ 4 million in grants , with $ 2.7 million coming from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation , to launch the center ; an additional $ 6 million is needed to complete the development , he said . &quot; What the center is trying to do is design the human environment in a way that is sustainable , that works with the natural_processes rather than against them. &quot; Students , who must apply to live at the center , pay $ 225 per month , excluding food . They do research , keep journals that record their energy use , and are required to minor in regenerative studies . &quot; Tilton is particularly enthusiastic , and that impressed us , &quot; Lyle said . &quot; He has a good ability to adapt to conditions that can be difficult . And he is genuinely committed to the subject . He had been involved in ( environmental work ) before. &quot; The route Jones took_to the center was circuitous . He grew_up in Manhattan Beach , where he went_to high_school . After graduation , &quot; I was a beach bum , &quot; he said , working_at various jobs , including tending bar . &quot; It was just an everyday routine with no meaning . In order to find my niche , I had to go away. &quot; Jones went_to a junior_college in the Sierra_Nevada , where he discovered &quot; a more simple way of living . Up there , you could see the problems more . A Styrofoam cup in the river really stood_out . Before , I ' d go_to the beach and there was trash all_over , but I never noticed it because I was so used_to it . So when I came_back to the city , I started seeing things more . The sky wasn ' t blue , and the water was so dirty. &quot; Jones entered Cal Poly Pomona with a goal : to begin a career as a solar engineer , committed to helping communities and individuals devise and use such renewable energy sources as the sun , water and wind . The research Jones and others are doing at the center &quot; is just one way to solve environmental problems in a more realistic way , &quot; he said . &quot; We don ' t have all_the immediate answers . What we have is a dream that we ' re working toward . But we understand it ' s going_to take time . &quot; We ' re going to have to change the way that people look_at life . that ' s the only way to change people . And this is one way to let them see another way of living. &quot;</TEXT>
