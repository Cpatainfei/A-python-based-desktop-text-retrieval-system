   <HEADLINE> WITH A NEW COUNTRY , SHE SEES NEW HORIZONS ; L.A. MARATHON : MEXICAN-BORN OLGA APPELL HOPES TO GO PLACES AS AMERICA ' S FASTEST FEMALE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Funny how joining a country of 248 million can make a person feel so alone . Olga Appell raised her right_hand with 109 others at the Albuquerque Elks Club last Friday and shivered not in joy , but weariness . It was supposed to be a day of excitement , of liberation . With one oath , Mexico ' s fastest female marathoner became the United States ' fastest female marathoner . She had made the most important run of her life , a run_for the border . And she had finished . So why did she feel so strange ? Why could she not stop thinking_about her disapproving brothers in the mountain town of Durango , Mexico ? Why could she not stop thinking_about a Mexican government official whose alleged extortion attempts drove her from the country ? A man who has vowed to cause her more grief ? &quot; I feel so happy , &quot; Appell said . &quot; But also , I feel a little sad. &quot; That night , at_home with only her 6-year-old daughter , there was no party , no congratulatory phone_call , no celebration . That is what Sunday is for . Wearing bib No . F1 for her first race as a U.S. citizen , Appell hopes to turn the Los Angeles Marathon into a personal welcoming reception . She hopes to see the course lined with Latino spectators . She hopes to hear cheers from those who also refuse to accept oppression . She hopes not merely to finish among the leaders , but live_up_to her status as the favorite by winning . Then , perhaps , she will hear a chant that will feel_like a hug . It has become a cliche , but it will remind her that becoming a citizen was not just her best choice , but her only choice : &quot; U.S.A. , U.S.A. &quot; &quot; This is a very , very special race for me , &quot; said Appell , 30 . &quot; All the Latino people , the sense of community there . . . all for my first race as an American . Yes , I want very , very much to win. &quot; This new beginning also represents the end of a long , twisting road for this former secretary who began running to lose_weight after giving_birth to daughter Monique six years ago . While she cites Monique ' s stability as the main reason she decided to join her husband , Brian , as a U.S. citizen , she admits she was also pushed from a country that once considered her a heroine . &quot; Because the government controls the press , I don ' t know if anybody even knows I am gone yet , &quot; Appell said . &quot; But when they find_out , well , maybe I won ' t be such a hero anymore. &quot; Her last major race as a Mexican was last fall_in the New York Marathon , where she was second in 2 hours 28 minutes 56 seconds , faster than any American woman last year . But according to Brian Appell , her husband and coach , the president of the Mexican Athletics Federation , Mexico ' s governing body for track_and_field , asked_for one-third of her $ 30 # 000 winnings . Julian Nunez Arana allegedly phoned Brian Appell and requested $ 10 # 000 or he would suspend Olga from the federation because she was never given formal permission to run in New York . &quot; I told him he was crazy , &quot; said Brian , a former track_star at Fountain Valley High . &quot; It was the last straw. &quot; Nunez , contacted through an interpreter at his Mexico_City home Wednesday , called Appell ' s charges , &quot; an absolute lie. &quot; &quot; I don ' t know what this woman is looking for. &quot; Nunez warned that the Mexican government would hold Appell to the letter of the international track law , which forbids a defecting athlete from competing in a world-class event for three years after their last appearance for their old_country . Because Appell ran_for Mexico in the World Championships last August , the rule could prevent her from running in the 1996 Olympic Games at Atlanta were she to qualify for the U.S. team . However , U.S. track officials cite a clause in the rule that allows athletes who change countries because of marriage to begin competing for their new country immediately . &quot; We expect her to be in the hunt for a medal in Atlanta , &quot; said John Mansoor , assistant to the executive_director of USA Track &amp; Field . It might be the first time Appell has been given a break . She said that even from her first victory as a Mexican runner , she suffered from mistreatment . &quot; As an American , I can now run stress-free , &quot; she said . &quot; I can run where I want . I don ' t have to ask permission. &quot; Appell said she was backed into a corner from the time she was a surprise 3 # 000-meter winner in the Mexican national championships three years ago . She had trained in Germany , so officials didn ' t believe she was Mexican . She had to retrieve her birth_certificate from Durango before her victory was declared official . The next year , she said , she was forced to pay her way from Germany to an America ' s Cup race in Colombia because the Mexican federation failed to reimburse her plane_ticket as promised . Even in her moment of greatest triumph -- a marathon victory in the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991 -- there was a catch . She said she wanted to run the 10 # 000 meters instead of the marathon , but the Mexican federation forced her to run the longer distance . Four weeks later , she faltered in the 10 # 000 meters at a lucrative meet because she was exhausted . Several members of her family , particularly two brothers , still wondered why she would turn her back on her homeland . Until she signed the papers in December , she questioned it herself . Appell hopes Sunday will provide another persuasive argument . &quot; I will wear the same running clothes as always , I will be the same runner , &quot; she said . &quot; But I will be different. &quot; Times staff writer Kevin Baxter contributed to this story .</TEXT>
