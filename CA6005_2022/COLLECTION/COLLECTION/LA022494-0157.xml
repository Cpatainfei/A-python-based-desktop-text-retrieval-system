   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : COUNCIL URGES MORE RADAR STATION STUDIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Santa Paula City_Council has unanimously passed a resolution urging the federal_government to conduct further environmental studies before turning_on its weather-tracking station on top of Sulphur Mountain . The resolution formally endorses pending congressional legislation introduced by Rep . Elton Gallegly ( R-Simi Valley ) that would force the National Weather Service to conduct studies over the next year looking_at the health effects of low-level radiation emitted by the 98-foot-tall radar tower.The tower is scheduled to be partially operational next week . Residents who live near the radar station have tried but failed to halt the use of the tower in state and federal_court . They have succeeded in garnering support from state and local politicians , including U.S. Sens . Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein of California . Santa Paula ' s resolution , passed_by the council Tuesday night , is similar to those adopted by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors and the Ojai City_Council . Despite little evidence showing any potential risks for Santa Paula residents from the tower ' s emissions , the council decided to push for further studies . &quot; It seems pretty clear that ( the Weather Service ) did not conduct the proper environmental review , &quot; said Councilman John Melton . The council heard from more_than a dozen residents who live near the site , many sporting colorful new T-shirts emblazoned with &quot; Move the Tower &quot; along with a replica of the Evard Munch painting of &quot; The Scream &quot; and an image of the radar tower . Some residents became teary as they detailed their concerns to the council . &quot; I have a 10- and 11-year-old and planned on raising my children up there , &quot; said Linda Fuller , choking_back tears . &quot; We ' re terrified about what it might do . It ' s not fair. &quot; SCOTT HADLY</TEXT>
