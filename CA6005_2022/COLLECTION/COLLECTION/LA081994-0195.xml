   <HEADLINE> CITY LAUNCHES $ 24-MILLION QUAKE REPAIR LOAN PROGRAM ; RECOVERY : PRIVATE LENDERS WILL CHANNEL FUNDS FROM TAX-EXEMPT BONDS TO OWNERS OF ABOUT 500 PROPERTIES . AIM IS TO RESTORE DAMAGED HOUSING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For an apartment_building , it was very young -- only six years old -- when the Northridge quake rattled its foundation , shattering windows , cracking walls and chasing its tenants into the street . Like hundreds of other quake-damaged buildings citywide , the 18-unit complex on Saticoy Street in Canoga Park might have been demolished or simply left to gather cobwebs until its owner could scrape together enough money for repairs . But on Thursday , that building and many others got a new lease on life when Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and city housing officials held a news_conference there to launch a $ 24-million reconstruction loan program . The latest of several quake-assistance programs offered by the city , the so-called Loans-to-Lenders program will use tax-exempt bonds and the help of private banks and lending_institutions to finance repairs of about 500 properties citywide . Home Savings of America and First Federal Bank will use the $ 24 million generated by the bonds to offer low-interest loans to owners and potential owners of quake-damaged properties . The banks also will take responsibility for paying_off the bonds . &quot; The bottom_line is that building owners can refinance their properties at a lower interest_rate , which makes more money available for reconstruction and repair of earthquake-damaged buildings , &quot; Riordan said before signing the documents to issue the bonds . Riordan and others lauded the program , saying the money will make_it more attractive for current owners to rebuild and for new owners to buy quake-damaged properties . Unlike other city or federal disaster loan programs , they said , this approach provides flexible financing and can begin distributing money as early as Sept . 1 . The crack-laced building in the 21000 block of Saticoy Street where the program was launched will be the first to benefit , receiving a loan of about $ 600 # 000 for repairs . &quot; This 18-unit building demonstrates the challenge , &quot; said Councilwoman Laura Chick , whose district includes the Canoga Park complex . &quot; With no action , this building and others would remain an eyesore. &quot; Although two or three other quake-damaged buildings sit vacant in that same neighborhood , the building is not within one of the 12 city-designated quake &quot; ghost_towns &quot; -- clusters of damaged structures in the San Fernando Valley , Hollywood and Mid-City . But city officials said they expect that the building and those around it will soon be declared a ghost_town and thus will qualify for federally funded security measures , such_as 24-hour security_guards and fencing . Ghost_town properties also have a higher priority for receiving federal loans . The $ 1.5-million building is owned by Home Savings of America . Fredric Forster , president and chief operating officer of the bank , said the building would probably be worth only $ 500 # 000 if it were sold today , in its current condition . In an unusual step , Forster said Home Savings of America will team_up with a nonprofit organization to repair the building and then sell it to the nonprofit group , which will offer the units to low-income tenants at reduced rents .</TEXT>
