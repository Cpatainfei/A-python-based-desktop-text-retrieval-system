   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : COPING WITH THE WEAK DOLLAR ; FOREIGNERS FED UP WITH THE U.S. DOLLAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The real reason the dollar has been sinking like a stone is not emotional questions about Clinton_Administration foreign_policy or pending trade wars . It ' s simply that foreign governments and private investors have been dumping U.S. stocks , bonds and Treasury securities for most of this year -- $ 38 billion in the first_quarter , possibly as much again in April , May and June , for which statistics are not yet available . The foreigners have been selling stocks and bonds for the same reason American investors have : They saw rising interest_rates hurting the U.S. economy , says Edward M . Bernstein , one of America ' s true currency experts , a veteran of the 1944 conference at Bretton Woods , N.H. , that set_up the post-World War II international monetary_system . But that conflicts with conventional thinking , which says the Federal_Reserve must raise interest_rates to forestall inflation and defend the dollar . In fact , all sorts of experts are shouting at the Fed to raise rates again next Tuesday . But that could be disastrous , says Bernstein , who is now 89 but comes_in every morning at 7:45 to an office at Washington ' s Brookings Institution . &quot; If the Fed raises interest_rates again , it would lead to more selling of U.S. securities and further declines in the dollar , &quot; he says . The conventional thinking is flawed , he is saying , and could well end_up sending the economy into recession . The markets seem to agree . On Tuesday , fears of new Fed action weakened the dollar along with stocks and bonds . But the falling dollar evidently does not reflect doubts about the underlying value of U.S. businesses . On the contrary , the dollar is seen as creating bargains for overseas companies wanting to acquire U.S. assets . Gerber Products , the baby foods_company , and drug_company Syntex Ltd . are being acquired by two Swiss companies , Sandoz and Hoffman La Roche . The fact that the dollar has fallen 10 % against the_Swiss franc in the last year makes such deals attractive . Wall_Street pros expect acquisitions by European firms to boom . &quot; There will be some action from Japan , but most of it will come from Europe , &quot; says one investment manager . It ' s logical that the same cheap dollar that makes U.S exports attractive should make whole companies seem like bargains . But it ' s sometimes hard to gauge value in modern currency markets . This year ' s decline in the dollar , Bernstein explains , has been the result of portfolio transactions -- foreign central_banks reduced purchases of U.S. Treasury securities by $ 21.4 billion in the first_quarter and private investors sold another $ 17.7 billion worth of U.S. stocks and bonds . That started cascades of selling by the thousands of global participants who trade $ 880 billion worth of currencies every day . Often called &quot; speculators , &quot; such traders are ordinary corporate treasurers , managers of pension_funds and bankers -- white-collar workers of the world charged with earning a return on an ocean of investable cash . But just like the ocean , the currency markets must be approached with caution , says Bernstein , an economist with degrees from the University of Chicago and Harvard . As a Treasury official in 1944 , Bernstein assisted Undersecretary Harry Dexter White and the famed British economist John Maynard Keynes as they put_together the Bretton Woods agreement that fixed the world ' s exchange_rates against the U.S. dollar , which was then pegged to gold . That system , and U.S. power , stabilized the world ' s money and allowed_for an unprecedented surge of prosperity . But the system broke_down in the late ' 60s when expenditures for the Vietnam_War flooded the world with dollars . Foreign governments balked at holding those dollars at an artificially fixed rate . So the United States ended the connection to gold and allowed the dollar to float against other currencies . That system continues to this day , although it is running_into crises as violent fluctuations impose a burden on international business . As a solution , Bernstein counsels the world ' s leading nations -- the United States , Japan , Germany , France , Britain , Italy and Canada , which meet next week in Naples , Italy -- to bring their currencies back into a system of semi-fixed exchange_rates . &quot; They might fluctuate 10 % against each other , &quot; he says , indicating a range of 1.60 to 1.75 marks to the dollar and 100 to 110 yen . To keep to such a regimen , nations would have to coordinate their monetary policies and give_up some independence of action for the common_good . But independence of action is already an illusion ; markets dictate policy . In the past week , for example , the Fed has &quot; intervened &quot; in the currency markets , buying_up dollars in a vain attempt to support their value . By that very action , the Fed tightened the U.S. money_supply and , in_effect , raised interest_rates . So if the Fed goes_ahead and raises rates further next Tuesday , it ' s easy to see how that might provoke a downturn in the economy . But if it ' s so easy , why don ' t people in Washington see it ? Because most officials in Washington don ' t understand modern currency markets . For most of its history , the United States hasn ' t worried about its currency , or thought it could be used for easy advantage in trade . Last year , Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen called_for a weak dollar to aid U.S. exports . But Tuesday night in a major speech in New York , Bentsen changed his tune . It appears that all those foreign governments and private investors selling dollars have sent a message : The system needs changing again , they ' ve said , and the United States better take the lead . The dollar ' s fluctuations have become &quot; a major concern of mine , &quot; Bentsen said . And he added : &quot; We believe a stronger dollar is better for our economy and better for the world ' s economy. &quot; Watch the markets to see whether his words can bring that about .</TEXT>
