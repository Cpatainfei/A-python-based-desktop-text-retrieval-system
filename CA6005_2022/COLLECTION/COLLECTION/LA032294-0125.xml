   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : ORANGE ; SAMPLING A JAPANESE TRADITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For 18 elementary students from St . Catherine ' s Military School in Anaheim , Thanksgiving came eight months early this year . But the young cadets and their teachers passed_on the sweet yams and mashed potatoes , instead indulging in o-hagi and kusa dango , two traditional Japanese rice dishes coated with special spices . With the help of Dohyo Restaurant in Orange , the students celebrated the Japanese version of Thanksgiving called Higan . The holiday marks the first day of spring with a traditional feast . &quot; Similar to Thanksgiving here in the United States , Higan is a day where the Japanese give_thanks for the bountiful crops received during the previous year and pray that next year ' s harvest is as plentiful , &quot; said Russell Tyson , the general_manager of the restaurant that treated the students to a traditional Higan meal . &quot; We hope to share our heritage with the students and demonstrate how similar , indeed , our cultures really are. &quot; With the supervision of the restaurant staff , the students were allowed to prepare and shape their own rice dishes . &quot; You mush it together to give it a sticky consistency , &quot; explained Tyson . &quot; So you can smush it into a ball. &quot; If that wasn ' t clear enough , head waitress Miki Mizushima , offered this hint for making the specialty dish : &quot; You ' ve played with Play-Doh before ? It ' s like that exactly. &quot; Though a little hesitant at first to try the new food , the students enjoyed the Higan treat . &quot; It ' s sticky and it ' s different , &quot; said Matthew Geiger , 8 , of Yorba Linda . &quot; But it ' s good. &quot; The hands-on approach to feasting obviously appealed_to students , some of whom said they prefer Higan to its American counterpart . &quot; I think it ' s a little better , &quot; said Brian Rayner , a 9-year-old from Costa Mesa . &quot; They get_to make things . In America , things get cooked and it ' s just there for you. &quot; Instructors at St . Catherine ' s Military School appreciated the opportunity to expose their students to the customs of another culture . &quot; What we want to do is to educate them completely , &quot; said Sister Elvera , a teacher at St . Catherine ' s . &quot; We couldn ' t do this on our own. &quot; MARTIN MILLER</TEXT>
