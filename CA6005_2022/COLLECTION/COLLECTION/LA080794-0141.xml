   <HEADLINE> HARRY BELAFONTE ; HUMANITARIAN , SINGER , WRITER , PRODUCER . HARRY BELAFONTE IS STILL EXERCISING HIS VOICE TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS CLOSE TO HIS HEART . ' SO_MUCH OF MY LIFE IS SPENT DEALING WITH ISSUES OF RACE , ' HE SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Harry Belafonte nominally lives in New York , but his artistic and humanitarian projects take him all_over the globe -- helping to immunize African children , meeting with Crips and Bloods in South-Central Los Angeles to help them maintain their truce , galvanizing the U.N. General_Assembly with speeches about helping the planet ' s troubled and needy youths . Today , as it happens , he is in the Bay Area , wearing the hats of humanitarian and UNICEF special ambassador -- meeting with George Lucas at his Skywalker Ranch to discuss ways to use cutting-edge Hollywood technology to help UNICEF further the causes of needy children -- and of director , scouting locations for his upcoming Turner Broadcasting movie &quot; Port Chicago , &quot; about a little-known incident during World_War_II with dire consequences for African American sailors . Over lunch at Lucas ' vast spread at Skywalker Ranch , Belafonte and Lucas put their heads together about technological ways to change education and help needy kids . &quot; We talked_about a possible economic war on the information superhighway , &quot; Belafonte says , &quot; and I stressed the need not to ignore poor children who will be opted out of the new system . We agree that information ( especially interactive methods of education ) should be accessible to all children of America. &quot; The meeting went well , Belafonte and Lucas both say afterward , and the two are planning to meet again in the fall to plan strategies . On the drive south from Skywalker , Belafonte smoothly shifts his perspective to director preparing to shoot a film . &quot; Port Chicago , &quot; which will begin filming next year , is set at the naval base on Suisun Bay near Concord ( now part of the Concord Naval Weapons Station ) that was the site of a horrifying event in 1944 -- an event that Belafonte , 67 , nearly experienced . After dropping_out of a Harlem high_school , Belafonte joined the U.S. Navy to fight in World_War_II . The Navy was segregated at the time , and in 1944 , before his imminent transfer to Port Chicago , two military ships loaded with ammunition exploded there , killing 320 people , mostly black seamen , leveling Port Chicago and breaking windows in the St . Francis Hotel , 35 miles away in San Francisco . &quot; It was the worst home-front disaster of World_War_II , &quot; says Belafonte , &quot; but almost no one knows about it or what followed. &quot; When , after the blast , black seamen refused to load ammunition under the same unsafe , segregated conditions that sparked the explosion , 50 of them were convicted of mutiny and sentenced to prison ; after the war , under pressure from NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall , the Navy reduced their sentences . &quot; The Port Chicago mutiny was one of America ' s ugliest miscarriages of justice , the largest mass trial in naval history and a national disgrace , &quot; says Belafonte . He credits Ted Turner and his staff with having the courage to put the story on television . The Lucas educational project and the Turner TV movie are just two of several projects -- most sharing a deep concern for the human condition -- that Belafonte has_on his front burner right now . The others include : * Co-producing , with Jonathan Demme directing , a feature_film version of &quot; Parting the Waters &quot; for TriStar , based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning Taylor Branch book about America during the Martin_Luther_King Jr . years . * Producing a film for the BBC and HBO called &quot; Black Tuesday , &quot; about a black soldier in the segregated U.S. Army in World_War_II who was unjustly charged with rape and hung_in London . * Co-writing , with Robert Altman , a film examining racism in America during the &quot; Amos ' n ' Andy &quot; era called &quot; Cork. &quot; * Playing himself in &quot; Pret-a-Porter , &quot; Altman ' s upcoming satire on the fashion_industry . * Playing a ' 30s gangster in &quot; Kansas City , &quot; Altman ' s next directorial effort . * Planning a world concert tour , possibly as early as fall of ' 95 , incorporating music from Third_World cultures that he has worked in . An album of the music is also in the works , for next year . * Leading a fact-finding mission in Rwanda and Zaire , for which he leaves Tuesday , to investigate the needs of refugee children , in his role as UNICEF ' s goodwill ambassador . As fiery and certainly as productive as ever , Belafonte is nonetheless keenly aware of his age . &quot; I ' m not fearful of death , I ' m really not , &quot; he says wistfully . &quot; I ' m just frustrated by the nagging demands of so_much to do and so little time . When I was 40 looking_at 60 , it looked a_thousand years away . Now 80 looks_like a week away. &quot; With great intensity , he vows , &quot; I ' m not going_out with a whimper. &quot; And in that light , he admits , &quot; I haven ' t been so busy since the civil_rights movement. &quot; Belafonte -- never one to seek the spotlight , and in fact someone who dislikes publicity and doesn ' t generally even employ a publicist -- was extremely visible in the ' 60s with marches , voter registrations , boycotts and arrests , as well as advising and fund-raising for the Rev . Martin_Luther_King Jr . He has been putting his own money where his beliefs are since the runaway success of his 1956 album &quot; Calypso , &quot; the first LP to sell more_than 1 million copies . The profits he received from that album allowed him to tackle one of his first civil_rights projects , and an extremely personal one : He was able to buy an entire Manhattan apartment_building from a racist landlord who had refused to rent to him . Belafonte and his wife , Julie , have lived there for more_than 37 years . &quot; So_much of my life is spent dealing with issues of race , &quot; he says with a sigh . &quot; I wish I could just get_out of bed and just think_about film or music . Black people spend an inordinate amount_of_time dealing with the race issue . I lost a lot of my friends to racism , including one of my dearest -- Martin_Luther_King Jr. &quot; Belafonte ' s best_friend , Sidney Poitier , describes him as &quot; a caldron of intellectual and social energy . He pours a lot into life and he demands a lot from it. &quot; So does Belafonte relish being an activist ? &quot; No , &quot; he insists . &quot; It ' s sucked_up most of my life. &quot; Nelson Mandela put it this way in a letter of congratulations upon Belafonte ' s winning the 1990 Nelson Mandela Courage Award , given by the Washington-based Trans-Africa Forum , in honor of his tireless work_on behalf of civil_rights : &quot; Harry would not sing , if he could not speak. &quot; Beyond his art , Belafonte is continuing his commitment to activism , speaking out against atrocities in countries such_as Rwanda , Bosnia and Haiti and working quietly in South-Central Los Angeles to reach_out to children and to gang members . On June 16 , for example , Belafonte was awarded a U.N. prize for his tireless work with African children . He then proceeded to stun the packed U.N. General_Assembly by inviting a 12-year-old from Watts to join him onstage to deliver an acceptance speech for him . The boy , Jasen Trotter , told his gripping story of life in South-Central L.A. and pleaded with the international delegates not to forget America ' s own children . He and Belafonte received a standing , teary ovation . And since January , Belafonte has been visiting housing projects in South-Central Los Angeles , advising the Crips and Bloods how to maintain their fragile 2-year-old truce and forge ties with Latino gangs . &quot; I ' m bringing people together , &quot; he says modestly , &quot; helping them hammer_out differences , embrace commonality and find outside assistance. &quot; He is also advising Latino and black gang members about starting businesses , from manufacturing clothing and ice_cream to selling machine parts . In addition , he ' s about to start innovative literacy and math programs with his civil_rights activist colleague Bob Moses , director of the Cambridge , Mass.-based Algebra Project , which began in 1982 as an outlet to help urban students link math to everyday problems . &quot; Since we made_peace , &quot; says Fred Williams , the former Crips leader who is now involved in maintaining the truce and running Common_Ground , a program to help at-risk youths in South-Central , &quot; there ' ve been a lot of publicity stunts ( involving politicians and leaders dropping_by South-Central for photo ops and little else ) . We ' re sick_of being used as political steppingstones . &quot; No one but Harry understood the significance of this truce or offered real resources . I ' ve never met a brother like him . This man is a gem ; he understands raw guys like me from the projects , sees our needs . &quot; We never asked him for money . Without even telling us , he called Hollywood friends and came_up with $ 200 # 000 in two weeks , &quot; Williams adds . &quot; Because of him , we can keep gang mediation teams on the streets , making_sure the Crips-Bloods truce doesn ' t fail this summer. &quot; &quot; These kids need to see black_men who can commit to them and show them other ways to define maleness than carrying Tech 9 guns , &quot; concurs Constance Rice , who works closely with the gangs as counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund . &quot; They don ' t sit and listen to many people , but they listen to Harry . Harry was in the same spot they ' re in . He was raised by a single mother , courted by gangs . He was saved by Paul Robeson and Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois , the giants in the Harlem Renaissance community -- who do these kids have ? &quot; &quot; The few giants who affected my life made a major difference , &quot; Belafonte agrees . &quot; Young Americans today don ' t even know who Dr. King was -- it ' s very painful . Where did we go_wrong ? Just days before his assassination , Dr. King was in my apartment and we discussed his nagging concern that perhaps we were integrating into a burning house . That thought has proved to be most prophetic. &quot; Belafonte pauses and turns deadly serious . &quot; There ' s a race war knocking at the door . Our country is in chaos and the media is keeping a lid on it . We have to do something about the moral collapse of this country . But we can ' t form a social movement without a common vision about how to change the country ' s direction. &quot; The urge to form a new social movement propelled Belafonte to invite an eclectic group of 70 community leaders from across the nation last May to a closed-door meeting at the historic Highlander Center near Knoxville , Tenn . One of the few places in the South where blacks_and_whites mixed freely in the 1930s , the Highlander Center became a key training and organizing place for the civil_rights movement . The three-day meeting ignited passions reminiscent_of those years . Orin Lyons , chief of the Onondaga Tribe of the Iroquois Nation , described it as &quot; a council of good minds. &quot; Civil rights leaders such_as Roger Wilkins , Bob Moses and Pastor James Lawson met with black and Latino gang members . Such public figures as Lani Guinier , Cornell West and Danny Glover shared ideas with the unemployed , farm_workers , labor_leaders , economists , rabbis and ministers . &quot; It was one hell of a historic meeting , &quot; says Williams , who came_with a group of Crips and Bloods . &quot; Harry was the reason for us being there -- he was the group ' s spiritual force . I have never seen a group of people of that caliber . No one cared about titles -- we talked heart to heart. &quot; Belafonte says that he called the meeting because &quot; we have a desperate need for leaders -- men and women of vision , who are going_to make a difference and help guide the course of the human family into the 21st Century and beyond. &quot; The group plans to meet again in late August , although the exact details are secret because participants want no publicity . It ' s not the first time Belafonte has galvanized a group on a large scale . In 1985 , he brought_together 45 performers , from Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen , to record &quot; We Are the World , &quot; raising millions of dollars in emergency assistance for Africa . He then helped set_in_motion Hands Across America to address problems of hunger in America . Yet with all_of these accomplishments , Belafonte is still not satisfied . One dream that has eluded him so far is what may be the project dearest to his heart : a miniseries based on the life of Nelson Mandela , which he has been trying to get launched for seven years . &quot; It sits on death row waiting for a reprieve from ABC , which I doubt will happen , &quot; he says , looking very upset . Poitier had been set to play Mandela , alongside a cast that included Marlon Brando , Jane Fonda , Susan Sarandon and Glover . &quot; How could you go_wrong with this cast ? &quot; he asks . &quot; But as history in South_Africa kept erupting , ABC got nervous about where it might be leading and stonewalled . Five years ago , it was a sexy idea to my co-producers . . . . Now that Mandela ' s in office , they find nothing sexy about making a film about democracy. &quot; ( Judd Parkin , a senior_vice_president of ABC Entertainment , says that &quot; the project is not in active development at this point. &quot; ) &quot; We ' re still plagued by an ( entertainment ) industry unwilling to make films of historical substance . They ' re unwilling to focus primarily on anybody of color , because they don ' t consider these films bankable . The philosophy still is ' keep it light , be entertaining. ' As a consequence , we ' re entertaining ourselves into utter apathy. &quot; Altman echoes Belafonte ' s sentiments . &quot; With so little art in the film business , &quot; he says , &quot; it ' s a shame that Harry ' s valuable messages can ' t reach a wider audience. &quot; Belafonte has never had an appetite for Hollywood game-playing . He describes his tactics in Hollywood as &quot; guerrilla warfare : You move_in , take your moment and get_out before it kills you . I say no to a lot of unacceptable film projects , knowing that I can go_to London or Tokyo for a concert and find a welcoming public . And it pays the rent. &quot; Now , he says , it ' s important for him to find quality time to spend with Julie , his four children and two grandchildren , as well as keep the flame burning for world change . He recently told a multicultural group at UC Berkeley ' s International House , &quot; If I were to pick one word that ' s the most strategic to human interchange and human thought , it would be the word difference . But people are so afraid and intimated by difference . Many people are manipulated to be intimidated by it . Many people manipulate it for evil ends . Others embrace difference so we can understand more about each other . &quot; It is in difference that we find the opportunity to learn , to love , and to serve . It is in difference that we find the center to our own humanity. &quot;</TEXT>
