   <HEADLINE> PSYCHOLOGIST KEEPS GOLFERS ON THEIR GAME ; GUIDANCE : WITH A POSITIVE OUTLOOK , ATHLETES CAN OVERCOME MENTAL BLOCKS , WRIGHT SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> David Wright knows how to ease pain . For 10 years , he helped people deal with serious headaches at a pain management clinic he started in Orange . Now he ' s going_after another source of agony : Golfers ' angst . Wright of Coto de Caza is a golf psychologist and PGA teaching professional . &quot; I ' m the only one of my kind in the world , I think -- I ' m still waiting to be discovered , &quot; Wright said . Those who have discovered him , including PGA and LPGA tour professionals and successful local junior players , swear by his methods . &quot; You just listen to his voice and he makes you feel more relaxed , &quot; said Kellee Booth , a neighbor of Wright ' s who won the U.S. Junior Girls ' Championship last summer . Said PGA Tour pro Pat Burke of Azusa : &quot; I had really gotten close to_the_point where I didn ' t want to play any more . I was a mess . He helped me get a different focus_on things. &quot; Said LPGA Tour pro Jennifer Wyatt : &quot; I spent the first part of this year so miserable . I would come_back from the course and just cry . I would be so frustrated. &quot; After working with Wright , Wyatt says she is_better at keeping her composure . In golf , the most sane person might be one bad shot away from becoming a basket case . This is where Wright steps_in . &quot; Golf is a game in which you have to learn to control and let_go at_the_same_time , &quot; said Wright , who played a year of minor_league baseball in the Cincinnati Reds ' organization . More_than anything , Wright stresses patience . The deep breathing techniques he teaches help calm the nerves , allowing keener concentration . &quot; Golf requires such fine concentration and for such brief periods_of_time that you really have to focus_on the present , &quot; Wright said . &quot; Most of us live mentally in the future -- when we get_in the shower we ' re already thinking_about what we are going_to do later that day. &quot; Wright helps his students return to the here_and_now . Based at Pelican Hill Golf_Club since June , Wright charges $ 150 ( juniors $ 100 ) for about 80 minutes of psychological instruction . His professional clients pay him a percentage of their prize_money . The fee includes audio tapes on relaxation and building consistent routines and &quot; Mind Under Par , &quot; an instruction_book he wrote and plans to publish in January . He helps his students map_out their goals -- in golf and in life . He provides physical_fitness workouts . He counsels his junior players not to let golf consume them and , if necessary , helps them with a studying schedule . It ' s a comprehensive approach , but the main focus , of course , is golf . When practice starts , Wright usually takes his students to the putting green first . &quot; I have to do a lot of converting here , &quot; he said . &quot; They have to believe_in me . I ' m not saying they come_in skeptical , but once I show them success on the putting green , they ' re ready to listen to what I have to say in the other areas. &quot; Wright , who has two psychology doctorates , trains his clients to visualize hitting each shot perfectly before taking it . &quot; Fred Couples never hits a shot without recalling a similar shot he has hit well before , &quot; Wright said . Obviously , Couples has a bank of good shots from which to make withdrawals , but the rest of us can dream , and Wright says vivid images produce better shots . He builds confidence through drills -- repetition being crucial to learning . Wright , 48 , never dreamed he would be making a living in golf . He rarely played the game until the mid-1980s . He met Derek Hardy , then a teaching pro at Ridgeline Country_Club in Orange , and they developed a symbiotic relationship . Hardy would teach Wright and his family how to play golf and Wright would teach Hardy about psychology . &quot; When I first met David , I was a good teacher ; I had won awards and so forth , &quot; Hardy said . &quot; But after working with him I became a much , much better teacher because I understood how people learn. &quot; Hardy , named by Golf Magazine as one of the 50 best teachers in the country , said Wright is effective because his background is clinical instead of academic . Wright quickly took_to the game . He gave_up his pain management practice and became an assistant pro under Hardy , eventually completing the PGA apprentice program . At the same time he was developing his golf psychology practice . The practice naturally led him to the PGA and LPGA tours , where mental toughness is essential and one missed putt can cost thousands of dollars . Wright works with such LPGA players as Marta Figueras-Dotti , who won for the first time in 12 years on the tour in January , Anne-Marie Palli and Jan Stephenson . He has been working with PGA Tour rookie Dennis Paulson for about two years . A 1980 graduate of Costa Mesa High who played_at San Diego State , Paulson turned pro in 1985 and played in eight PGA Tour qualifying schools before earning his card this season . &quot; He really helped me , &quot; Paulson said . &quot; The funny thing is , David told me from the beginning , ' Dennis , you ' ve won before and you ' ve won a lot . You know how to win but you need to pay_attention to what is going_on when you are playing well. ' &quot; Paulson said his problem was that he got so angry at himself on the course -- &quot; You ' re such an idiot for hitting that shot. &quot; -- that the game wasn ' t fun anymore . Wright helped Paulson learn to give himself credit and channel anger positively . Now Paulson has won nearly $ 130 # 000 , putting him in the top half of the Tour ' s money-winner list . In April he shot a course-record 62 to take the second-round lead in the PGA event in New Orleans . He wound_up in a tie for fourth , his best PGA finish , but another accomplishment stands_out more in his mind . &quot; I was never more proud_of anything than how I played_at tour school , &quot; Paulson said . &quot; I never hit it in the water , never had a three-putt , never had a double_bogey and never shot over par in any one round for six rounds. &quot; Now , that ' s painless golf .</TEXT>
