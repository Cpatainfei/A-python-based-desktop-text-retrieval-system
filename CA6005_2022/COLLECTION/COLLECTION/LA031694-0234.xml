   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : CLINTON ' S GAME OF CHICKEN WITH CHINA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sudden , extraordinary tension between the United States and China threatens to back President Clinton into a corner over the issue of renewing most-favored-nation trade status for China in June . If Clinton doesn ' t renew MFN -- which allows Chinese goods into the U.S. market on terms accorded other trading partners -- U.S. business prospects in China , which is growing_into one of the world ' s largest markets , could suffer a long-term body blow . But if Clinton approves MFN without China ' s leadership making gestures to placate U.S. concerns on human_rights , he will look weak -- like the proverbial &quot; paper tiger &quot; as Mao Tse-tung put it -- and that also could have major economic and political repercussions . What is going_on and what ' s the likely outcome of a dispute that means a lot , in terms of business and global politics , for years and decades to come ? Clinton , in what looks_like a high-stakes game of chicken , is pressing to both open markets and move Asia toward political democracy . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher went_to Beijing last weekend to talk to China ' s leaders about political reform and improving their record on human_rights . But his overtures were rudely rejected . Chinese Premier Li Peng said his country would never accept the U.S. &quot; concept of human_rights &quot; and warned that U.S. business would lose out on the big China market to come . In that tactic , Li was playing_on the future prospects for China -- the country of 1.2 billion people that plans to add 100 million phone_lines , build scores of electric_power plants and buy hundreds of airplanes in the next decade . But in the present , the leverage runs the other way : U.S.-China trade last year totaled almost $ 40 billion , with China taking $ 9 billion in U.S. exports of planes , computers , power generators and chemicals , and the United States buying almost $ 30 billion in Chinese exports of apparel , shoes and toys . China thus ran a trade surplus of more_than $ 20 billion . And some members of the U.S. Congress see that as a lever to force China ' s leadership to stop mistreating political_dissidents and selling weapons to Iran , Pakistan and other countries . &quot; Access to our market is very valuable to them , &quot; says Rep . Nancy Pelosi , ( D-San Francisco ) . &quot; We ' re the only country that opens its market so freely to their products , and they depend_on exports for the growth of their economy. &quot; Pelosi and Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell , ( D-Me. ) , introduced legislation last year tying trade to human_rights and that pushed President Clinton to make renewal of China ' s MFN status conditional on &quot; substantial progress in human rights. &quot; Now China is calling his play , saying in_effect America needs us more_than we need America . Who ' s bluffing ? Both sides , in a way . Pelosi is right that the U.S. market is important to China , but she may be overestimating how important . Exports to the United States amount to 3 % to 6 % of China ' s total output , depending_on estimates of China ' s economy , which is comparable_to that of California . China is growing very fast , especially in coastal areas such_as Quangzhou and Shanghai . It bought 47 Boeing planes last year and will buy a comparable number this year ; it has a joint_venture building airplanes with McDonnell Douglas . China knows it ' s a hot market and it ' s capable of applying object_lessons . Recently , after disputes with Britain over Hong Kong , China handed valuable contracts for transit equipment to Germany . But Germany had to kowtow . Chancellor Helmut Kohl flew into Beijing accompanied by top_executives of 195 German companies , who stayed two weeks and tied_up business . &quot; Europeans don ' t care about human_rights , &quot; mutters one U.S. businessman in Beijing . Right now China ' s leaders are pushing American companies to lobby the U.S._government . And U.S. business people seem a bit too ready to cooperate ; some of them lectured Christopher at the U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce in Beijing , criticizing his emphasis on human_rights , which was distasteful , disloyal and dumb . Aside from morality , there is a good , economic reason for U.S. emphasis on democratic reforms and human_rights . China ' s present leadership is a corrupt remnant left over from communism -- these are the wonderful folks who brought you Tian An Men Square . Economically such governments get_in the way of the emergence of what is the great hope of all poor nations and will be the strength of China : the development of a prosperous , growing middle_class . The United States at its best strives to foster development of a middle_class and movement toward democracy . Sometimes it succeeds . South_Korea , under its new President Kim Young Sam , is a good_example in Asia . Indonesia could be another . But where U.S. policy worked patiently with those countries , it is imperative with China , which is bigger and much more ambitious to be a great_power on its own . The result is the current tension , which presents a danger of miscalculation . &quot; The United States has so many issues with China -- regional peace , North_Korea , Taiwan , the development of Southeast_Asia , that we shouldn ' t concentrate everything on trade , &quot; says Michael Oksenberg , head of Honolulu ' s East-West Center for Asia Pacific research . So what is likely to happen ? A deal will be struck . China , still a poor country , needs America ; it doesn ' t want to be totally dependent_on Japan . In fact , China has recently concluded strategic military agreements with the United States . China will probably send olive_branches between now and June -- &quot; I tell them relations with America are a Chinese question , they must make the moves , &quot; says a Chinese banker in Los Angeles . And the Clinton_Administration likely will find evidence of human_rights progress and renew MFN . If the tactic really does move China toward political reform , it will be a success . If it only makes_for another year of trade , there will be other , tougher battles to come . * RELATED STORY : A1 U.S.-China Trade The top five imports from China to the United States and exports from the United States to China in 1993 * , in billions of dollars : * U.S. IMPORTS FROM CHINA Apparel : $ 5.6 Footwear : 4.6 Toys , Games and Sporting Goods : 4.2 Electronics : 4.2 Leather Goods : 1.9 * U.S. EXPORTS TO CHINA Aircraft and Parts : 2.4 Electrical_Power System : 1.9 Agricultural Chemicals * * : 0.7 Computers and Peripherals : 0.7 Industrial Chemicals : 0.4 * * Estimate * * excludes pesticides Source : Commerce_Department ; U.S. Foreign Commercial Service 1994 Country Marketing Plan for China</TEXT>
