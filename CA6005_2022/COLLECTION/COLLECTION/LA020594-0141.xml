   <HEADLINE> DELAY ELECTRIC AUTO MANDATE , GM CHIEF SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California should delay its electric-vehicle mandate from 1998 until the year 2000 , when new batteries to lower the cost and extend the range of zero-emission cars may be available , the chief_executive of General Motors Corp . said Friday . The comments from John F . Smith mark the first time since the industry began seeking a rollback of California ' s rule last year that a Big Three executive has estimated the time it would take_to deliver attractive , affordable electric vehicles . &quot; Maybe there is some way to tie the development ( of electric vehicles ) to the timing of a second generation of batteries being ready , &quot; Smith said after giving a speech at the Chicago Auto Show . The state Air Resources Board has mandated that by 1998 , 2 % of vehicles sold in California be zero-emission models . The mandate increases to 5 % in 2001 and 10 % by 2003 . Only electric vehicles now qualify as emission-free . Board spokesman Jerry Martin said the agency sees no reason to back_away from the 1998 deadline . &quot; We intend to stay the course , &quot; he said . In his speech , Smith reiterated the auto industry ' s belief that practical electric vehicles cannot be produced by 1998 . The main problem is that today ' s batteries hold only a fraction of the energy contained in a tank of gas . The Big Three , the federal_government and the electric utility industry are jointly working_on a $ 260-million program to develop advanced batteries . The hope is that improved batteries -- those that are cheaper , last longer and can greatly extend range -- can be ready by the turn_of_the_century . &quot; Several years of focused development will be required for mid-term batteries to be commercially viable , &quot; Smith said . But there are no guarantees that the technology will be available even by 2000 . And there is a credibility gap between the industry and regulators and the public . &quot; Credibility is a problem , &quot; acknowledged Smith . &quot; Some of it we deserve. &quot; The industry has opposed emissions and safety advances on technological grounds in the past , only to be proven wrong .</TEXT>
