   <HEADLINE> IN HIS ELEMENT ; SEABORGIUM IS NAMED FOR ONE OF ITS DISCOVERERS , GLENN SEABORG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Twenty years after its creation in a Berkeley laboratory , the 106th known element has finally received a name -- seaborgium , after Glenn T . Seaborg , the Berkeley Nobel laureate who helped make_it and nine other heavy elements . It is the first time an element has been named after a living person . Seaborg , 81 , is a former chancellor of UC Berkeley and chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission ( the forerunner of today ' s Department_of_Energy ) under Presidents John F . Kennedy , Lyndon B . Johnson and Richard Nixon . He burst into prominence in 1941 when he was the prime_mover in the discovery of plutonium , the radioactive element that is_best known as a key component of atomic_bombs . His team subsequently discovered a series of so-called transuranium elements , which are heavier than uranium , the heaviest naturally occurring element . These elements are too short-lived to be found in nature and must be created in nuclear accelerators by firing beams of particles and nuclei at heavy elements such_as uranium . Seaborg ' s team at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was at the forefront in creating elements from the 1940s through the 1960s , including neptunium , americium , curium , berkelium , californium , einsteinium , fermium , mendelevium , nobelium and the element known for 20 years simply as element 106 . Although most of the newly discovered elements are too fleeting for practical_applications , plutonium is used as a fuel in some nuclear_power plants and americium is used in fire detectors . All their discoveries have revealed insights into the nature of matter . Seaborg received the 1951 Nobel Prize in physics for his role in the discoveries . Names for new elements are generally provided by the element ' s discoverers , but element 106 was claimed by both the California group and a Russian team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna . For 20 years , neither team was able to reproduce their discovery , in large part because element 106 is extremely mercurial , disappearing from physicists ' detectors in a_few seconds . Finally , last fall , a team headed by physicists Ken Gregorich and Darlene Hoffman at Berkeley succeeded in once more producing it , nailing_down Berkeley ' s claim for its discovery and at last freeing the group to name it . The eight-member team discussed naming the element after either Sir_Isaac_Newton or the late Berkeley physicist Luis Alvarez , who played a key role in formulating the theory that dinosaurs were killed_off by the impact of a comet . However , the other seven members recently met in Seaborg ' s absence and decided to name it after him , he said . &quot; This is an extraordinary honor for me . Future students of chemistry , in learning about the periodic_table , may have reason to ask why the element was named for me , and thereby learn more about my work , &quot; he said . The new name was announced at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Diego . Since Berkeley ' s last discovery in 1974 , the creation of new elements has been led by a team in Darmstadt , Germany , which has discovered elements 107 , 108 and 109 . They have been named nielsbohrium ( for the Finnish physicist ) , hassia ( for the German state of Hesse ) and meitnerium ( for the German fission pioneer Lise Meitner ) .</TEXT>
