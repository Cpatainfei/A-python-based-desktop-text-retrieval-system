   <HEADLINE> BUDGET OFFICE ' S HEALTH RULING CALLED DAMAGING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Congressional Budget Office plans to rule that the entire Clinton_Administration health reform package should be treated as a new government program , not a private insurance plan , dealing the White_House a potentially devastating political setback , Administration and congressional sources said Monday . The ruling by CBO Director Robert D . Reischauer , to be announced in congressional testimony today , has been the subject of feverish speculation and intense Administration lobbying for more_than two months . Since late last week , a host of senior White_House officials have contacted Reischauer and his top aides to try to talk him out of his position , White_House aides said , but to no avail . By characterizing the White_House health intiative as a government program that must be reflected in the federal budget , the CBO will make_it easier for congressional Republicans and other critics to characterize the Clinton plan as a form of socialized medicine controlled by government bureaucrats rather than private firms and their insurers . &quot; They would have done anything to avoid this -- anything , &quot; said one senior Senate aide who has been in close contact with the White_House . &quot; They tried like hell. &quot; &quot; It ' s a complication , &quot; acknowledged a senior White_House official . &quot; Whether it ' s a sustainable complication or not , I just don ' t know. &quot; White_House officials said late Monday they were still uncertain precisely what Reischauer would say in his testimony but were hopeful that they had won some points . In particular , they hope he will announce that CBO ' s analysts basically agree that the Administration ' s numbers add_up . Such an endorsement would lend credibility to the Administration ' s claim that its plan , which is based on a requirement that all companies buy insurance for their workers , would finance itself without new taxes beyond the tobacco tax increase Clinton already has requested . Equally important , White_House aides said they believe that Reischauer will not call the required premium payment that employers and their workers would make under Clinton ' s plan a &quot; tax , &quot; but instead would choose the less politically damaging moniker of &quot; receipt. &quot; Those points , however , are secondary to the major impact of the CBO testimony , which is to politically demolish Clinton ' s argument that his plan establishes a completely private program , not a new government spending plan . Administration officials had said from the beginning of their efforts to come_up with a health_care plan that they would not propose a Canadian-style , government-run plan because the public would not support something that appeared to be such a major expansion of government . Under the CBO ' s ruling , Clinton ' s plan now suffers from the same liability . &quot; This gigantic contortion of a bill was done simply to avoid what Reischauer is saying tomorrow , &quot; said the Senate aide . Under the CBO interpretation , the money paid by employers to insure their workers would be considered a government receipt . Spending for health_insurance would be considered a government expenditure . The effect would not widen the federal_deficit if the plan pays_for itself as the Administration argues it will , but it would dramatically increase the apparent size of federal_government -- boosting the budget by $ 330 billion , or roughly 20 % . &quot; This is like having the L.A. earthquake and the Midwestern floods at_the_same_time , &quot; the Senate aide said . &quot; This means the plan is dead. &quot; Administration officials and other congressional aides were more sanguine , insisting that the proposal could survive the blow . &quot; This is February , not August , &quot; said one senior House aide , noting that the process has many complicated turns_to take before congressional votes even begin . But even White_House officials conceded that , at a minimum , key parts of Clinton ' s proposal would have to be rewritten . &quot; My fundamental conviction is that this is going_to be worked_out , &quot; said Clinton senior adviser George Stephanopoulos . But he admitted that &quot; I can ' t say exactly how. &quot; Stephanopoulos and other Administration officials insisted that the CBO decision is essentially a technical matter involving the arcane rules governing the &quot; score-keeping &quot; of the federal budget . &quot; I can ' t believe the American people are going_to allow a scorekeeping issue to stand between them and getting guaranteed private insurance for everyone , &quot; Stephanopoulos said . Privately , officials conceded that the political damage will be serious . As word spread of the CBO decision , Republicans were quick to seize it and argue that it makes Clinton ' s plan unworkable . &quot; Basically , they are going_to have to throw_out two-thirds of their plan . ( The President ) is in terrible shape , &quot; said Rep . Bill Thomas ( R-Bakersfield ) , ranking minority member of the House Ways and Means health subcommittee . &quot; Politically , ( Reischauer ) has just said you have to play the game by the rules . I don ' t think ( Clinton ) can win if he has to play by the rules , &quot; Thomas said . Depending_on its precise wording , Reischauer ' s ruling could affect some Republican alternative reform plans as well . For example , the plan offered by Sen . John H . Chafee ( R-R.I. ) , and sponsored by Thomas in the House , avoids a mandate that employers pay_for insurance , but would require all individuals to buy insurance . That mandate , too , might be considered an &quot; on-budget &quot; receipt under the CBO rules . One immediate political impact of the ruling is to give far more leverage to congressional leaders , such_as Senate Finance_Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) and key House committee Chairmen Dan Rostenkowski ( D-Ill. ) , John D . Dingell ( D-Mich. ) and Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) , who avoided locking their legislative positions in place before the CBO acted . Over the next several weeks , those legislators will likely begin rewriting the reform legislation in ways that will meet CBO ' s rules . Administration officials made no secret of their disagreement with Reischauer . Putting the health plan on the budget &quot; makes no sense , &quot; insisted White_House aide Gene Sperling . &quot; It would be the same as saying that private auto insurance the state makes a person pay to a private auto insurer should also be_on the budget and considered a tax . Nobody would ever imagine auto insurance being considered that way. &quot; Nonetheless , an Administration official said , the White_House has little choice now except to swallow its pride and head back to the drafting table . &quot; This is not rocket science . There are rules , &quot; the official said .
