   <HEADLINE> STATE_PRISON , PLAGUED BY ESCAPES , WILL INSTALL ELECTRIFIED FENCE ; CORRECTIONS : LETHAL BARRIER IS EXPECTED TO SAVE MONEY BY REPLACING WATCHTOWER GUARDS AS WELL AS IMPROVE SECURITY AT THE FACILITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Workers on Wednesday will begin surrounding the state_prison in Lancaster with a lethal electrified fence that should make escapes less likely at an institution that had four during its first year of operation . Interim Warden John M . Ratelle said Monday that the electrified fence will allow the prison to save money by removing armed officers from 10 watchtowers . At the same time , he said , it will discourage inmates from trying to escape by climbing the perimeter fences , as convicted murderer Eric Rene Johnson did_in October . Tower officers apparently did not see Johnson scale the two 12-foot chain-link fences surrounding the prison . When an electrified barrier is activated between these fences , the tower officers will no longer be needed , the warden said . &quot; You have human_beings in the gun towers , &quot; Ratelle said . &quot; What the fence does is take_out the human-error part . The fence never goes_to_sleep . It doesn ' t go_to the bathroom . It doesn ' t do any of those things . It ' s always working. &quot; In an hourlong interview , his first since assuming control six weeks ago when Warden Otis Thurman was removed by the state , Ratelle added that within a month , punishment will be handed_down against officers whose actions are believed to have contributed to separate escapes by Johnson and another maximum-security inmate . &quot; The investigations ( are ) completed , and there will be some disciplinary actions taken , &quot; he said . Despite the widespread concerns over these escapes , Ratelle urged the community to see the prison in a more positive light . He pointed to the public clean-up work done_by minimum-security prison crews and the charity work done_by prison staff_members who have helped combat child_abuse and provided meals to the needy . The warden added that the prison , with its annual budget of $ 78 million and nearly 1 # 000 employees , is making a significant economic contribution to the Antelope Valley . &quot; That money goes_back into the local community , &quot; Ratelle said . &quot; I think sometimes that gets lost because of a_couple_of setbacks the institution had. &quot; California State Prison-Los Angeles County , which was built despite objections from the community , opened in February , 1993 . During its first year , two minimum-security inmates walked away from a barracks outside the prison fences , maximum-security inmate Johnson scaled the fences to escape , and another , Steven Charles Brigida , got_out by hiding in a garbage_truck . Although all four prisoners were recaptured , the incidents angered and alarmed residents . In late February of this year , state corrections officials told the first warden , Thurman , to retire or accept another post elsewhere . Ratelle said he had not been told whether Thurman has made a decision . Ratelle , 53 , warden at the Richard J . Donovan Correctional Facility near San Diego , was asked to take the helm at Lancaster for three or four months until the governor appoints a new permanent warden . Since his arrival at Lancaster , which houses almost 4 # 000 inmates , Ratelle said he has made_sure inmates are counted eight times a day . He also has ordered stricter supervision of &quot; close custody &quot; inmates , who are serving long sentences and are considered more likely to try to escape . Lax supervision was one reason for the two maximum-security escapes , Ratelle said . &quot; People sometimes tend to become complacent , &quot; he said . &quot; If it was anything , it was just a little complacency. &quot; But since his arrival , the warden added , &quot; the staff at the institution has responded marvelously . They really have rallied around all_of these procedural changes. &quot; The new electrified fence is expected to be a further deterrent to escapes over the chain-link fences that surround the buildings where medium- and maximum-security inmates are confined . The electrified fence , which should be finished by December , will carry a charge of 650 milliamperes . For the average person , 70 milliamperes is enough to cause immediate death , said Bill Gengler , a spokesman for the California Department of Corrections . The first such fence was activated late last year at Calipatria State_Prison in Imperial County . No inmate has ignored the warning signs and tried to escape over the fence since it was turned_on , prison officials said . Lancaster is one of 15 other California prisons slated to get an electrified fence over the next year . The fence , expected to cost up_to $ 1 million , will save money because staffing a gun tower around the clock costs $ 225 # 000 annually , prison officials say . By removing officers from 10 of Lancaster ' s 12 towers , the institution will save more_than $ 2 million annually , Ratelle said . These tower officers will be reassigned to vacant jobs at the prison . Inmate-rights groups have criticized the so-called &quot; death fences &quot; as a cruel form of punishment . But Ratelle responded : &quot; You ' re not going_to touch the fence accidentally . You have to have a clear ( intent ) to get_over the fence . If you die because of that , you made a choice. &quot; The warden hopes the electric fence and other security improvements will restore the community ' s confidence in the prison . &quot; I would n ' t sit here and promise that we ' d never have another escape , &quot; he said . &quot; I can say , though , that with the things that we ' re doing now , and with the staff ' s attentiveness in doing their jobs , the likelihood of an escape is minimal. &quot;</TEXT>
