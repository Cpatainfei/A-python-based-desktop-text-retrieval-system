   <HEADLINE> MASS TRANSIT / IN THE CITY OF CARS ; BUT IS IT A MATTER OF RICH ( RAIL ) VS . POOR ( BUS ) ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Once again , it has come_down to this : Should we subsidize the poor who cannot afford to drive , or the rich who drive too_much ? The recent ruckus over the Metropolitan Transportation Au thority ' s budget , and , indirectly , the mechanics ' strike revolve_around this question of rich ( rail ) vs . poor ( bus ) . Indeed , this is often the issue in transportation . But it ' s magnified by the politics of the MTA , which are structured to yield a petty debate about bus vs . rail . Using the MTA budget to argue transportation policy is like trying to solve the health-care crisis by tinkering with Medicare : Making Medicare efficient won ' t contribute all that much toward fixing the whole system . The problem with the MTA is not so_much that the transit system is too bloated . It is that the MTA isn ' t a useful forum for framing transportation policy issues . Though huge , the MTA actually controls a fairly small portion of transportation spending in Los Angeles . The rest is controlled by regional agencies , in Sacramento , in Washington and , of course , in millions of private decisions by individuals who buy cars , ride public_transit and decide when and where to drive . But the MTA is the most obvious pressure point . It ' s the agency that controls most of the transportation money generated through local tax_revenue . The MTA also serves as a place where interest_groups can hassle mayors , council_members and county supervisors directly , because they serve on its board . Watching the poverty advocates and transit unions fight against rail construction is an odd sight . After all , you don ' t see unionized schoolteachers lobbying against the construction of new schools . But that ' s because the political decision-making process concerning schools , though troubled in other ways , distinguishes between money used for operations and money used for new construction . New schools are constructed with developer fees and state and local bond funds , both requiring voter approval . When a new school gets built , nobody claims that third-graders and teachers elsewhere will suffer as a result . By contrast , the MTA operates in a way that creates the perception that bus riders and rail construction are in competition . The MTA is the product of a forced merger of two agencies : the Southern California Rapid_Transit District , which ran the bus system and was building the Red_Line subway , and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission , which doled_out transportation funds and was building the light-rail system_called for in Proposition A . The two agencies never liked each other and , since their union , have been struggling to fit together harmoniously . The turf wars can be almost comical . Try listening to an RTD loyalist defend the billion-dollar-a-mile Red_Line as a sound investment while ridiculing the much cheaper Blue Line as a waste_of_money . As a result of the marriage , the MTA carries_out two basically conflicting tasks . First , it operates the largest bus system in the country , making the agency a big target for political attack by poverty advocates -- because most riders are poor or working-class -- and union activists . Second , it is in_charge of constructing one of the largest public-works projects in the history of the country , which inevitably attracts big-dollar lobbyists seeking construction contracts . The MTA ' s board actually doesn ' t have as much leeway in deciding how to spend money as the poverty advocates claim . There is some discretion in doling out Proposition A and C funds , but the drafters of the ballot measures , especially Proposition A , were primarily concerned with paying_for construction of a light-rail system . Nonetheless , because all_the money is in the same budget , Mayor Richard Riordan , county Supervisor Michael D . Antonovich and the other MTA board_members get hammered from all sides by people wanting to spend the money a certain way . Furthermore , this structure encourages political activists to fire away at the MTA without needing to pay_attention to the overall transportation planning and funding process . Billions of dollars of state and federal transportation funds flow into Los Angeles every year , and it is spent according to priorities mostly determined by the Southern California Assn . of Governments and state and federal bureaucracies -- forums reporters don ' t usually cover and politicians usually ignore . These spending decisions reflect a bias toward rail -- and highway -- construction over bus-operating funds that has nothing to do with the MTA . Other decisions that drive public policy on transportation in Los Angeles are not even made by transportation agencies . Tighter tailpipe-smog regulations , which arguably hit the poor hardest because they increase the cost of old clunkers , are imposed by the California Air Resources Board . The regional car-pooling requirement , an expensive attempt to get the middle_class out of their cars , is controlled by the South Coast Air Quality Management District . All these agencies , however , are not as politically appetizing as a high-profile transit authority controlled by the mayor and county supervisors . So poverty and labor activists slam the Pasadena light-rail line , arguing the MTA should instead spend its money on better bus_service and better driver salaries . But you don ' t hear them criticizing the proposed extension of the 710 Freeway through South Pasadena -- even though that project is of dubious social value and is similar in cost and path to the Pasadena line . that ' s because there ' s no political advantage to it . The MTA doesn ' t decide whether money is allocated to the 710 -- or any other state_highway . Those decisions are made by the California Transportation Commission in Sacramento , 400 miles from Los Angeles TV cameras . Transit officials are right when they make the seemingly Pollyanna-ish assertion that transportation should not be a choice between bus and rail . Vast resources are devoted to transportation -- tax monies from local , state and federal sources ; private business funds required to comply with air-quality regulations ; and billions in household budgets , mostly to buy and maintain cars . Transportation priorities should be made in a political forum that recognizes and can accommodate all these resources , not just a_few . We will always have to subsidize rich and poor , because an effective transportation_system will always have such broad and often conflicting goals as clean air , a manageable traffic flow and socioeconomic equity . But now there is no place in Los Angeles where our politicians can hash all these issues out_in a broad context . Short of that , the MTA budget will remain a political hot button , and transportation politics in Los Angeles will remain the politics of rich vs . poor. *</TEXT>
