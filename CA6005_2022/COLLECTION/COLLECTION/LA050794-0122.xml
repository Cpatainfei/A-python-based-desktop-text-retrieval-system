   <HEADLINE> STRICKEN VETERANS BLAME THE MILITARY FOR HEALTH HAZARDS ; ILLNESSES : GROUP INCLUDES GULF WAR SOLDIERS WHO LINK THEIR AILMENTS TO VACCINES INTENDED TO PROTECT THEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In often-poignant testimony , veterans -- including some from the Persian_Gulf_War and some from as long ago as World_War_II -- told Congress on Friday that they are suffering from an array of medical ailments as a result of service in a military that has since abandoned them . Speaking before the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee , the veterans described a wide range of illnesses and other health_problems that they blamed on secret experiments , preventive drugs or vaccines they were given , or exposure to environmental chemicals or other possible hazards . Veterans of the Gulf War , in particular , charged that experimental drugs and vaccines intended to protect them against chemical and biological weapons were administered without adequate warnings about possible damaging side_effects . &quot; All we were told was that the pills would protect us against chemical and biological weapons , &quot; said the Rev . Barry Walker , a chaplain during the Gulf War , referring to the drug pyridostigmine bromide , which was distributed as a shield against lethal nerve_gas . &quot; We were told to take the pills and not given a choice , though some soldiers did not take them. &quot; The issue of soldiers ' exposure to health , environmental and other hazards has long been a persistent and difficult problem . Particularly in the case of the Gulf War -- when the armed forces were responding to what was seen as a military emergency and were facing an enemy that had used chemical and biological weapons in the past -- there may have been no good alternative to whatever protective drugs were available , regardless of possible side_effects . And no one substance or organism has been identified as the sole cause of the multiple health_problems experienced by the men and women who served in the Persian_Gulf or elsewhere . Nor is there agreement as_to how widespread the problems are . But veterans testified Friday that , since the problems developed , the health_care system of the Department of Veterans Affairs has either ignored them or been slow to address their complaints . Moreover , such stories have taken_on a special resonance because of the government ' s well-documented history of indifference or carelessness about exposing troops to risks , and of its laxity in acknowledging links between such exposures and the development of disorders . &quot; How many_more lessons do we have to learn ? &quot; asked Sen . Tom Daschle ( D-S.D. ) , one of Capitol_Hill ' s leading advocates for veterans . &quot; We ' ve gone_through it decade after decade , and here we are again in 1994. &quot; It was many years after the end of the Vietnam_War before the federal_government recognized that a range of physical disorders -- from mild to life-threatening -- was associated with exposure to the herbicide Agent_Orange during the Southeast Asian war . Similarly , the government was sluggish in responding to the growing numbers of combat-related cases of post-traumatic stress disorder . World_War_II Navy veteran Rudolph Mills of Fredericksburg , Va. , speaking barely above a whisper , told of being used as a human guinea_pig during mustard_gas experiments 50 years ago . He said he participated unhesitatingly because he had been &quot; willing to do anything to help my country. &quot; &quot; In spite of all_the agony the VA has put me through , I would step into a gas_chamber again today if it would help preserve this great country for my grandchildren , &quot; he said , his already weak voice cracking . Mills said he suffered burns on his face during the experiments and later was diagnosed with larynx cancer , a condition that he believes was caused by the exposure . So far , he said , he has received no compensation from the government , despite years of trying to secure service-related benefits . Air_Force Lt . Col . Neil Tetzlaff , a Gulf War veteran , told the committee that he endured uncontrollable vomiting -- and still suffers pain and other disabling conditions -- after taking pyridostigmine bromide while on the way to Saudi_Arabia , as he was instructed to do . Tetzlaff said he has encountered other soldiers who suffered similar drug reactions . He said they were treated badly by the VA when they sought help for their ailments because they were unable to prove that the medications were responsible . American soldiers fought for their country in the Persian_Gulf , he said , but received no economic or rehabilitative assistance because &quot; they can ' t prove in what ways or how badly they were injured. &quot; An estimated 20 # 000 or more of the nearly 700 # 000 troops who served in the Persian_Gulf theater during 1990 and 1991 have reported an array of debilitating symptoms , including fatigue , skin_rashes , muscle and joint pain , headaches , memory_loss , shortness of breath and gastrointestinal problems . Such symptoms could stem from problems unrelated to military_service , but many of the troops were exposed to a variety of potentially toxic chemicals , such_as fumes and smoke from oil_well fires , diesel fumes , toxic paints , pesticides and depleted uranium used in munitions and armor . They were also given at least three drugs under special circumstances in which the military and the Food and Drug Administration waived the usual informed-consent procedures because of expected battlefield conditions . The drugs included pyridostigmine bromide , which is licensed only for the treatment of myasthenia gravis , a chronic muscle weakness disorder ; an as yet unapproved vaccine to combat botulism and a licensed vaccine to protect against anthrax . R.J. Vogel , the Veterans Affairs undersecretary for benefits , told the committee that he believes the department is &quot; seriously attempting to understand and find answers to the causes of health_problems some Persian_Gulf_War veterans are experiencing . &quot; We continue to review our policies to expedite claims processing and are providing medical services to veterans suffering from various health_problems that may have been incurred in the Gulf , &quot; he said . Vogel ' s remarks provoked an angry rebuke from Daschle , who chastised the VA official for giving a &quot; bureaucratic answer &quot; after the &quot; emotional outpouring &quot; of the previous witnesses . These men &quot; deserve better than that , &quot; Daschle said , adding : &quot; I think the VA has failed miserably . It ' s very important for us to listen to what we heard this morning with more empathy than your answer of the last few minutes. &quot; &quot; Senator , I ' ve got good ears , and I ' ve got a good heart , &quot; Vogel replied . &quot; I think the VA is doing what it can. &quot; Vogel said that immediately following Mills ' moving testimony he directed a member of his staff to call the department ' s Roanoke , Va. , office to determine why Mills was having such difficulty . That angered Daschle even further . &quot; He shouldn ' t have to come_to a hearing of the U.S. Senate to get redress of a problem he ' s had for years , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
