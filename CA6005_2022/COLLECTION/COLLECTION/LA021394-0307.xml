   <HEADLINE> ASBESTOS CONTAMINATION ADDS TO RISKS AND COSTS OF CLEANUP ; DAMAGE : BUSINESS IS BOOMING FOR REMOVAL_FIRMS . SOME HOMEOWNERS DO IT THEMSELVES OR IGNORE PROBLEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As president of an environmental testing firm , Michael Uziel usually deals with the toxic worries of others . But he ' s had serious ones of_his_own since last month ' s earthquake battered his Northridge home -- cracking the cottage-cheese-like ceiling and scattering asbestos dust over furnishings and carpets . &quot; It ' s devastating . . . . I have to throw ( away ) almost all my belongings , &quot; said Uziel , 50 , who evacuated his house and may_not have enough insurance to cover both the structural repairs and asbestos cleanup . Jolted by an asbestos aftershock , hundreds of building owners and occupants are scrambling to deal with the risk of contamination from asbestos , a leading environmental cause of lung_cancer , along with extra cleanup costs and delays . Because of its widespread use in building_materials , asbestos &quot; is always an issue of concern whenever there ' s an event that damages structures , &quot; said Kathleen Shimman , regional director of the office of health and emergency planning for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . When earthquakes or hurricanes knock buildings around , asbestos &quot; can be shredded and broken and . . . the fibers of asbestos can be inhaled. &quot; * In one form or another , asbestos is present in more_than half of all buildings that are at least 15 years old , authorities say . Although many uses of asbestos have been banned , some continued into the 1980s . Health officials and asbestos consultants have been flooded with calls from those who are concerned about the problem . But officials said many building owners and occupants probably are unaware of quake-related damage to asbestos materials . Some homeowners who are unwilling or unable to hire licensed asbestos contractors are cleaning_up asbestos debris themselves -- with or without proper equipment and dust prevention methods . Even so , business is booming for the asbestos abatement industry in the wake of the Jan . 17 quake . &quot; Everybody in this industry -- consultant and contractor included -- have been taxed and maximized to the extent of capacity and beyond to cover all . . . work that ' s going_on , &quot; said Thomas A . Jordan , vice_president of Gale / Jordan Associates , an environmental consulting_firm . In a number of large office_buildings in the quake area , asbestos fireproofing on steel beams dropped through dislodged ceiling tiles to settle_on floors and desks , Jordan said . In several offices where his firm ran air tests , he said , the spills temporarily created significant airborne levels of asbestos . The quake and its aftershocks also triggered asbestos spills at about 100 schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District . Richard F . Henry , the district ' s asbestos technical supervisor , said that in preparing the schools for the return of students and staff , cleanup crews had to remove fallen asbestos soundproofing and pipe wrap and broken asbestos floor tiles . * In some areas , the problem has defied a quick_fix . In the theater area at El Camino Real High_School in Woodland Hills , asbestos debris from broken acoustical material is so extensive that the area has been temporarily sealed , Henry said . At Cal State Northridge , pulverized asbestos littered so_much of the engineering building that officials were forced to order a massive cleanup before they could get_in to assess quake damage , said Bill Chatham , CSUN associate vice_president for facilities and operations . Then , with the cleanup nearly complete after 10 days of wiping and vacuuming , a big aftershock Jan . 29 , created a second asbestos blizzard . Many problems in homes and apartments have involved &quot; cottage-cheese &quot; or &quot; popcorn &quot; ceilings -- some of which contain at least a small percentage of asbestos , experts said . In some cases , the earthquake cracked or shattered these ceilings , dusting carpets and furniture . Asbestos is safe when intact . But when asbestos materials are pulverized or broken , they can release microscopic fibers that float like water_vapor and are dangerous to inhale . Long considered a leading environmental cause of lung_cancer , asbestos also has been linked to mesothelioma , a rare and nearly always fatal cancer that may appear up_to 40 years after initial exposure . Low levels of asbestos are always present in the air , due_to construction and demolition work and erosion from automobile brake_linings and clutches . The vast bulk of asbestos disease has afflicted heavily exposed workers who labored for years in dusty conditions with minimal protection . But asbestos illness occasionally is reported in people thought to have been minimally exposed , prompting many experts to say no level is safe to breathe . Regulations designed to prevent creation of asbestos dust have also fallen victim to the need to clear quake rubble . In normal times , the federal Clean Air Act and South Coast Air Quality Management District rules require precautions to keep asbestos from becoming airborne during building repairs or demolition -- including removal and disposal of asbestos before building work occurs . * But many quake-damaged buildings are too unstable for asbestos crews to enter -- and thus are being cleared with the minimal safeguard of keeping the rubble wet to reduce dust . This also means that rubble containing at least small amounts of asbestos is going_to area landfills normally not allowed to accept it . Air district spokesman Bill Kelly said : &quot; You have to make a trade-off between the problem of asbestos and the imminent public safety concern from these unstable structures . . . . So we ' re looking_at providing these minimum standards for health protection of wetting and wrapping and then landfilling it. &quot; Unlike commercial and apartment_building owners , homeowners even in normal times are exempt from requirements that asbestos removal be done only by licensed abatement contractors . Some owners of quake-damaged homes are doing asbestos cleanup and removal themselves -- although most experts caution against it . Los Angeles County health officials are responding to questions from homeowners on simple asbestos cleanups . &quot; Usually people lack the funds to ( hire a contractor ) so we would tell them how to get literature to properly clean_up asbestos , &quot; said Don Thompson , an industrial hygienist with the county ' s health / hazardous materials control program . There is nothing simple about the work required at Uziel ' s Northridge home . Lab tests not only confirmed the presence of asbestos in the ceilings of the house , built_in 1977 , but in plaster from cracked walls . Uziel , who has two children , moved_out , and alerted neighbors with similar homes . A couple of the neighbors also moved_out , but some &quot; just shrugged it off , &quot; Uziel said . &quot; I knew my responsibility to other people , &quot; he said . &quot; Sometimes you happen to know things that the average man doesn ' t. &quot; What Uziel does not know , however , is how he will take_care of structural repair and cleanup costs well in excess of his $ 100 # 000 earthquake insurance_policy .</TEXT>
