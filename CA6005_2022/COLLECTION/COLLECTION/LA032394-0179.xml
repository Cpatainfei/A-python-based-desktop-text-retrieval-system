   <HEADLINE> NEW AREA_CODE COMING TO SOME IN NORTH O.C.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new area_code is coming_to Southern California , but this one has a twist . Local phone_companies announced Tuesday that they are going_to expand service in the 310 , 818 and 213 areas by adding an &quot; overlay &quot; area_code . The change may prove a bit confusing . Beginning in March , 1996 , the new area_code -- 562 -- will be stacked on top of the three existing codes in northernmost Orange County , including all_of Seal Beach and in Los Angeles County , company officials said . Once that happens , knowing where someone is won ' t guarantee being able to figure_out their area_code . Pacific Bell and GTE California will start with new and existing cellular_phones and pagers , which tend to move_around a lot anyhow . But after that , probably around the turn_of_the_century , 562 will also apply to some regular &quot; land-line &quot; phones , the kind that tend to stay_put . Mike Murray , a spokesman for GTE , said that to minimize confusion , the 562 land lines will be restricted mostly to pay phones and data-transmission equipment , at least initially . Officials say New Yorkers weren ' t confused when an overlay code was introduced there in 1992 , and we won ' t be either . The new area_code will allow phone_companies to keep_up with the increasing demand for phones without having to change the area_codes for most existing customers . &quot; Overlay codes could not have come at a better time for number-hungry Southern California , &quot; said Pac Bell Vice_President Gene Sherman . &quot; They make_it possible to keep_up with the demand for new telephone_numbers and new technologies. &quot; The change will make Southern California one of only four places in the country to have an area_code without a middle digit of or 1 . The others -- in Alabama , Washington state and Arizona -- will go_into service next year . As originally set_up , the or 1 in the middle of a three-digit area_code signaled telephone switching equipment that the number was an area_code and not the first three digits of a local phone_number . But such area_codes limited the total phone_numbers in the United States to about 1 billion . The introduction of an 11th digit for long-distance_calls -- a &quot; 1 &quot; preceding the three-digit area_codes and the seven-digit local numbers -- made_possible the use of a wider variety of area_code combinations . That change eventually will permit a total of about 5 billion phone_numbers in the United States , officials say . Steve Marcus , a spokesman for NYNEX , the telephone_company that serves New York state and all_of New England except Connecticut , said an overlay code of 917 was introduced in New York City a_couple_of years ago in areas previously reached only through 212 or 718 . Marcus said that , like here , the service was introduced initially for cellular_phones and pagers . He said the only land lines now using 917 are telephone_company phones . &quot; Our customers have reacted to it very well , &quot; he said . &quot; We kind of phased it in , and people have understood the need for it. &quot; Marcus conceded that &quot; it can be confusing if an area_code isn ' t tied to a specific geographic area. &quot; But he said that since the overlay code applies to only two area_codes in New York City , and all public use currently is restricted to cellular_phones and pagers , &quot; there has been no confusion. &quot; The introduction of the overlay in the Southland will be far less disruptive than the creation of a new , geographically exclusive code , Sherman said . The creation of the 310 and 909 area_codes in the past three years forced more_than 4.2 million business and residential customers in Southern California to change codes . By comparison , he said , about 480 # 000 cellular and paging customers will change codes with the introduction of the 562 overlay . GTE and Pac Bell say they will ask local cellular and paging companies to adopt one or more of the following methods to help reduce the demand for new phone_numbers in the fast-growing 310 area : * Assign cellular and paging customers to other_than the 310 area_code if they initiate service before the 562 code is introduced . * Move some existing cellular and paging customers to 562 in 1996 . * Move at least half the prefixes assigned to existing 310 cellular and paging customers to 562 starting in May , 1996 . A prefix is the first three digits of a seven-digit local phone_number . Each prefix typically accommodates about 10 # 000 phone_numbers . Murray said the changes are not expected to cause phone_book problems because cellular_phones and pagers are seldom listed . As for numerologists , satanists and others who worry about such things , Murray said that , yes , he ' s aware that 5 , 6 and 2 add_up to 13 . &quot; At least the new code ' s not 666 , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
