   <HEADLINE> AFRICA ' S FORMER PARIAH IS NOW A POTENT FUTURE FORCE ; ECONOMICS : A POWERHOUSE IS EXPECTED AFTER SOUTH_AFRICANS VOTE . THEIR NEIGHBORS ARE FILLED WITH HOPE , FEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Newspapers in Nigeria breathlessly reported a_few years ago that the South_African army planned to bomb Africa ' s most populous country because of Nigeria ' s tough stand against apartheid . Of course , South_Africa never planned such an attack . But Nigerians , like most people in Africa , figured the evil , white-controlled regime in Pretoria was capable of anything . Now , Nigerian newspapers are worried about South_Africa again . But this time the Nigerians are warning that their three decades as the most influential country in sub-Saharan Africa are about to end , with democracy arriving in South_Africa and Nigeria still struggling under military rule . &quot; Even South_Africa is going_to get democracy before us , &quot; lamented the Guardian newspaper in a recent editorial in Lagos . After the elections next week , South_Africa will finally shed its pariah status among the 40 other countries in sub-Saharan Africa , and , just as quickly , it will become the continent ' s economic powerhouse , political model and , perhaps , leader as well . But many African leaders are now asking whether South_Africa will become the locomotive that leads Africa out of its economic and political valley , or will it lure Africa ' s brightest people , creating a brain_drain on the continent ? Will a black-governed South_Africa remember that Africa stood behind it through years of liberation struggle ? Or will it , instead , use its clout to dominate and run_roughshod over the continent ? &quot; There are many people in Africa who are clearly very nervous , &quot; said Eugene Nyati , director of the Center for African Studies in Johannesburg , a business consultant group . &quot; We are bigger . We are stronger . And once you are powerful , it doesn ' t matter if you are a white or black government . You sometimes have a tendency to take_advantage of weaker people. &quot; Rakiya Omaar , a Somali and co-director of African Rights in London , said the continent is anticipating South_Africa ' s new government &quot; with a combination of hope , pride and trepidation. &quot; &quot; Every African and every black_person has felt that South_Africa ' s struggle was their own , &quot; she said . &quot; They feel they also have suffered for South_African liberation . And they hope that will not be forgotten. &quot; Africa may , in fact , be in_for a shock when , as is expected , the African National Congress and its leader , Nelson Mandela , come_to power . For one thing , the new government will be preoccupied with domestic problems . It will be under pressure to build houses for tens of thousands of shack-dwellers , bring electricity to the impoverished townships , increase opportunities for blacks in business and raise the level of black education to current white levels . As a result , African_countries hoping for development assistance from South_Africa , something once gladly provided by white governments seeking to win friends on the continent , will be disappointed . &quot; African_countries would love to do business with South_Africa , &quot; Nyati said . &quot; But , quite frankly , there isn ' t much they can sell us . Even with countries like Nigeria , there is nothing we can buy from them . Even petroleum , we can get from Angola. &quot; Only 4 % of South_Africa ' s foreign trade occurs in Africa now , compared to 34 % with Europe and 10 % with the United States . South_Africa will also be preoccupied with dismantling the apartheid system . &quot; To think that we can deal with all our own problems and have time and money left over for Burundi is crazy , &quot; said one official with close links to the ANC ' s foreign affairs department . But there will be some moral and political debts to pay in Africa as well . For years , African_countries could agree on little besides their opposition to apartheid . They banded_together , filling the halls of the United Nations with their demands for sanctions and for the release of Mandela . The ANC president , who has made personal visits to thank many African_countries since his release in 1990 , has promised &quot; sensitivity and self-restraint in our dealings with the rest of Africa. &quot; Yet the talk on the campaign trail in South_Africa has already rankled some African leaders . Even some ANC leaders are saying that other countries in Africa , with their self-inflicted wounds , are complete failures and bad examples . &quot; Things may sour quickly if people with short memories and no sense of loyalty or identification with Africa are allowed a very big role within the ANC , &quot; said Omaar of African Rights . &quot; I hope their foreign_policy will be dominated by people , like Mandela , who remember the assistance and brotherhood that we extended. &quot; But any economic cooperation between South_Africa and the rest of the continent will have to be , in the words of black_and_white business_leaders here , &quot; mutually beneficial. &quot; In other words , there will be no handouts and no trade pacts that do not provide clear economic benefits for South_Africa . &quot; People have always said we will be the locomotive that drives the African economy , &quot; said Greg Mills , director of studies at the South_African Institute of International Affairs . &quot; But there will have to be a harmony of interests . And , in many countries , that seems a fairly scant prospect. &quot; Of course , the new South_African government will want to forge diplomatic and economic ties with the rest of Africa , especially among its neighbors . South_Africa will be an important partner in the battle against a host of problems in the region , including the smuggling of drugs , cattle and arms . It will be able to share its considerable expertise in wildlife conservation to help Zimbabwe and Kenya salvage their wildlife-based tourist industries . But the new government will be more judicious in its foreign_policy . In the days of apartheid , the white government in Pretoria threw_up embassies in every country that would have them , from Ukraine to Taiwan to Malawi ; Pretoria was always ready to win new converts to its cause . That may soon change . &quot; African_countries are bending over backward to get us to set_up embassies , &quot; an ANC foreign affairs specialist said . &quot; Basically , every African_country would love to have an embassy . But we are not about to waste our foreign currency on having an embassy in Somalia . What for ? &quot; South_Africa ' s new foreign_policy may also affect not just nations but also some key political groups . Opposition to apartheid , for example , has for years been the raison d ' etre of the Organization of African Unity . But the OAU has been incapable of dealing with the myriad other problems of Africa , from military takeovers to ethnic strife . And ANC leaders say privately they are not sure they even want to join the OAU . &quot; They want us to become a member , but we are going_to have to pick and choose , &quot; one ANC official said . &quot; Some of these organizations , the members don ' t even pay their dues . They are hoping South_Africa will carry all those free-riders. &quot; Even African leaders agree that the OAU has been ineffectual . &quot; Many Africans , myself included , have been impatient for South_Africa to become independent because its plight has for so_long been an excuse for other African leaders to deflect attention from the continent ' s other problems , &quot; Omaar said . &quot; South_Africa was , morally , a black_and_white issue , &quot; she added . &quot; But criticizing ( former President Ibrahim ) Babangida in Nigeria or ( Hastings Kamuzu ) Banda in Malawi was considered interference . We don ' t want African leaders and institutions to have any more excuses. &quot; South_Africa ' s economic influence is already becoming apparent across Africa . South_African goods are_on the shelves of most African capitals , and South_African Airways is flying to more places in Africa than ever before . Meantime , authorities in Kenya and Zimbabwe , two of the continent ' s more industrialized countries , are battling one unwelcome import : Thousands of cars stolen in South_Africa are turning_up on the streets of Nairobi and Harare , as well as other African capitals . And as the free and economically prosperous United States once lured Europeans , so too South_Africa is luring Africans . Most of the engineers from Zambia , an impoverished country that suffered numerous bloody attacks from South_African security_forces while it housed the ANC ' s exile headquarters , are now working_on mines in South_Africa . Doctors in Zimbabwe , which borders South_Africa , are also heading south soon after graduation for the more lucrative medical_practices here . &quot; People are seeing South_Africa as a place where you can go and do business the way you once could do business in Kenya , &quot; a Western diplomat in Nairobi said . &quot; With the economy decimated by the Kenyan government , everyone is looking south. &quot; But immigrants may_not find the welcome_mat out . South_Africa has an unemployment problem of its own , with an estimated 46 % of blacks_out of work . The country appears to be heading out of its lengthy recession , but that does not mean it will open the doors to immigration . &quot; Black South_Africans may feel they have waited long enough , without having to share it with the rest of Africa , &quot; one African political analyst said . Many analysts believe that Africa needs a strong and stable South_Africa -- and a respected world leader such_as Mandela -- to improve the continent ' s image . ' If South_Africa tears itself apart , I think Africa will be put_on the shelf to grow cobwebs and dust , &quot; said Mills of the International Affairs Institute in Johannesburg . But , he added , &quot; if South_Africa can successfully manage its transition , it will generate a lot of hope for other African_nations and the world ' s goodwill will spread across the region. &quot;</TEXT>
