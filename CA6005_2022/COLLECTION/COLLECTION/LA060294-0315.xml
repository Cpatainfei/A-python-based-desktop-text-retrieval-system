   <HEADLINE> WASTED ' PEACE DIVIDEND ' SPURS U.N. AGENCY TO MAKE SWEEPING PROPOSALS ; DEVELOPMENT : IT RECOMMENDS INTERNATIONAL TAXES TO AID THE THIRD_WORLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The main U.N. agency for economic development , despairing over the waste of almost a_trillion dollars of &quot; peace dividend , &quot; set_down sweeping proposals Wednesday -- including an international tax -- for expanding assistance to a third of the world in such &quot; abject poverty . . . that words simply fail to describe it. &quot; The proposals , to be taken_up next year at the United Nations ' World Social Summit conference in Copenhagen , form the centerpiece of the U.N. Development Program ' s annual report on worldwide human development . The report , as always , includes the United Nations ' annual rankings of countries on a development index based on wealth , education and health . Canada , which was second in the world last year , now ranks first , followed by Switzerland , Japan ( last year ' s leader ) , Sweden and Norway . The United States , sixth-ranking last year , has fallen to eighth . But the agency report was less concerned with these rankings than with the possibilities of the social summit scheduled for March . This conference , a pet project of former Chilean President Patricio Aylwin that has won the endorsement of the United Nations , is expected to attract scores of heads_of_state and government , including President Clinton . Aylwin insists the summit is needed because the post-Cold War world -- while it has largely adopted democracy for its politics and the free market for its economics -- has failed , so far , to come_up with a philosophy to deal with its social problems . &quot; There is one golden and , I fear , fleeting opportunity to bring the rich and the poor together , to make the compacts and to forge the partnerships that are needed to achieve sustainable human development in all countries , north and south , and that is the social summit , &quot; James Gustave Speth , administrator of the U.N. agency , told a news_conference in Washington . In the report , largely written by Mahbub ul-Haq , former Pakistani minister_of_finance , the Development Program concludes that global military spending has declined $ 935 billion since 1987 . &quot; Unfortunately , &quot; the report says , &quot; this peace dividend has not been used to finance the world ' s social agenda. &quot; The agency , the United Nations ' main engine for Third_World development , acknowledges there has been considerable improvement in world development in recent years . &quot; While 70 % of humanity survived in abysmal human conditions in 1960 . . . only 32 % suffered such conditions in 1992 , &quot; it states . But the agency takes little solace in this . &quot; Despite all our technological breakthroughs , &quot; the report goes_on , &quot; we still live_in a world where a fifth of the developing world ' s population goes hungry every night , a quarter lacks access to even a basic necessity like drinking_water , and a third lives in a state of abject poverty. &quot; To deal with these problems , the U.N. agency proposes what it calls &quot; fundamental changes . . . in the present framework of development cooperation. &quot; Some of the most sweeping include : * &quot; A serious search . . . for new sources of international funding that do not rely entirely on the fluctuating political will of the rich nations. &quot; The report notes some possibilities , such_as a global tax on the use of gasoline and other non-renewable energy sources and a small tax on transactions of speculators dealing in foreign_exchange . A tax of $ 1 on every barrel of oil ( or its equivalent in coal ) would bring_in $ 66 billion a year . * Compensation by rich countries to poor countries for services such_as pollution control that benefit humankind and for damages caused by market barriers such_as restrictions on migration of labor . * Allocation of 20 % of the peace dividend in rich countries and 10 % in poor countries to a new &quot; global human security fund &quot; that would pay_for such projects as controlling drug trafficking , international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . If military spending drops_by only 3 % worldwide in the next five years , there would be a saving -- the peace dividend -- of $ 460 billion more , the report says . * Creation of an Economic Security_Council to deal with issues such_as unemployment , poverty and food shortages in the same way the U.N. Security_Council deals with threats to peace and security . The U.N. Development Program report stresses that wealth and human development do not always go hand in_hand . Ecuador and the Congo , for example , each have a per capita gross_national_product of a little more_than $ 1 # 000 a year . Yet because of its high life_expectancy and literacy rates and its low infant_mortality , Ecuador ranks 74th in the worldwide Human Development Index , while the Congo ranks 123rd . &quot; Much depends_on how the fruits of economic_growth are shared -- particularly on what the poor get -- and how much the additional resources are used to support public_services , particularly primary health_care and basic education , &quot; the report says . The U.N. Development Program , measuring the health of nations , also discusses the concept it calls human security . Under this concept , countries are in crisis if they measure poorly on indicators of food supply , jobs , human_rights , sharing of wealth , ethnic conflict and an overemphasis on military spending . Using these , the report names eight countries in crisis : Afghanistan , Angola , Haiti , Iraq , Mozambique , Myanmar , Sudan and Zaire . The report expresses disappointment with the continued spending for arms in the Third_World , despite the Cold_War ' s end . In South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa , it says , &quot; armies continued to flourish in the midst of human misery. &quot; Citing figures over a period from 1988 to 1992 , the agency says that the five largest exporters of arms to the Third_World were the five permanent members of the Security_Council : Russia , the United States , France , China and Britain . The five largest importers of arms in the Third_World during this period were : India , Saudi_Arabia , Afghanistan , Turkey and Iraq . The report calls_on the World Social Summit to endorse the principle &quot; that no nation should spend more on its military than on the education and health of its people. &quot; Although much gloom edged the pages of the report , the U.N. agency had positive news as well . A number of countries have managed to increase their standing in the Human Development Index markedly in the last three decades . The countries that increased their development the most were Malaysia , Botswana , South_Korea , Thailand , Syria , Turkey , China , Portugal and Iran . Rich and Poor The Human Development Index ranks 173 countries based on life_expectancy , education and income . TOP 10 03 # 11 , 15 # 10 ' 94 rank ' 93 rank 1 . Canada 2 . 2 . Switzerland 4 . 3 .
