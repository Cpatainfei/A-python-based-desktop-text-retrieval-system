   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; CAN TECHNOLOGY BRIGHTEN THE PICTURE ? ; ECONOMY : STATE TURNS TO JPL IMAGING FOR HELP HOLDING_ON TO PRODUCTION WORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With an alarming share of production moving_out of state and California in need of a boost , the California Film Commission hoped NASA ' s Jet_Propulsion Laboratory might use its technological talents to earn a star on Hollywood ' s Walk of Fame . Last year the CFC , envisioning a high-tech marketing tool to stimulate local production , asked the Pasadena-based JPL to design a computer imaging program for its location photo library -- one that would enable location scouts to view shooting sites and obtain filming permits on-line . After a labor-intensive collaboration , an initial prototype of the new &quot; Library Automation Project &quot; was completed last month . But while it should fulfill its promise to strengthen the CFC ' s competitive advantage , that advantage may be short-lived : Rival film commissions have been pressing the CFC to reveal the new technology . &quot; We ' ve been approached by other film commissions about the system we ' re developing , but ( we ) must walk a fine line between protecting California ' s economic interests and promoting the global interests of the California-based film_industry , &quot; says CFC director Patti Stolkin Archuletta . &quot; Of course , we want to cooperate , but our first responsibility is to strengthen California ' s competitive advantage. &quot; Nearly everyone in the image technology business -- from on-line services to photo CD firms -- has lobbied relentlessly in recent years for film commissions worldwide to automate their location photo libraries . But in an era when intellectual property_rights are redefined by each new_deal , how real is that advantage ? The JPL ' s basic technology is available to any U.S. film commission , since the CFC obtained it in a non-exclusive deal . But the CFC has the first option to license its exclusive commercial rights for a renewable , two-year term in a deal with the JPL . &quot; If the tool used to create a database is available to anyone , you can ' t create a competitive advantage simply from the rights to license it , &quot; says Roger McNamee , a partner in Menlo Park , Calif.-based Integral Capital Partners , a software investment_firm . &quot; Other factors then become important , like lead time in the marketplace , quality of the database and how user-friendly it is. &quot; At risk is California ' s $ 16.3-billion production industry , which employs 164 # 000 residents directly and 184 # 000 others in supporting businesses from catering to advertising . Other filming venues throughout the United States and Canada have captured millions of production dollars by cutting red_tape , handling film companies with kid_gloves and , most importantly , offering financial incentives such_as cheaper labor and tax_credits . * As a result , California has lost 60 % of all current one-hour TV dramas and made-for-TV movies to other locations -- a record loss . And though local feature_film production has remained stable , technological advances will soon enable facilities throughout North_America to challenge Hollywood ' s 95 % hold_on producing situation_comedies . While the new electronic library won ' t resolve the crucial issue of higher local production_costs , the CFC believes its sheer volume of resources and their accessibility will have a big impact on production company decision_makers . The menu-driven program -- based on computer_systems that enable scientists to study the massive volumes of planetary images collected during explorations of outer space -- will allow production personnel to view more_than 200 # 000 site photos from multiple perspectives . It will include logistical , historical and aesthetic information for landscapes and buildings ; list nearby vendors for equipment , food and lodging ; combine still photos with full-motion video , and provide mapping capabilities , elevation and even weather information . &quot; Some scientists want planetary information relevant to a specific scientific problem and others want peripheral information , so we ' ve had to learn to handle huge data sets quickly , &quot; says the JPL ' s J . David Nichols , who never expected to be in show_business . &quot; Similarly , if you want a site location for a cowboy movie , you could call_up images of Western street scenes all_over California , while the next user could take a video tour of the interior of an urban building or warehouse. &quot; On the commercial front , 10 film commissions and several major studios are already testing Kodak ' s Eastman Exchange Location Search Network -- a photo CD imaging system designed to create a global hookup for location scouting . While the CFC has not signed_on with Kodak , last June the two innovators did agree to collaborate . * So far , state_government has pledged an undisclosed annual sum to develop the system -- to be funded in stages -- and NASA has committed $ 150 # 000 in personnel hours every year for three years . But the CFC suffered a minor setback last week when the Clinton_Administration ' s Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program denied its request for a $ 250 # 000 grant . Eventually , the California Department of Trade and Commerce , the CFC ' s parent agency , hopes to expand the new database to promote tourism and real_estate development statewide .</TEXT>
