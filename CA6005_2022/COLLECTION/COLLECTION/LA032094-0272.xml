   <HEADLINE> RESIDENTS CAMPAIGN TO SCUTTLE SHELTER PLANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since San Pedro residents discovered that a homeless shelter is proposed for surplus Navy housing in the middle of a residential_area , they have turned their anger into a united front , vowing to halt the project . Homeowners and real_estate_agents formed a group , Concerned Citizens , just days after they found_out that Turner ' s Technical Institute , a homeless advocacy organization based in South Central , planned to run the shelter . Turner ' s Technical plans to run a housing program for up_to 600 homeless people in 144 units of Navy property at 2300 Taper Ave . The plan already has been approved by the federal Health and Human Services_Department . Concerned Citizens countered by distributing 4 # 000 flyers last week , rallying 1 # 000 people to protest the plan Tuesday night . Community opposition is not a case of just saying &quot; not in my back yard , &quot; residents say . &quot; Our motto is ' San Pedro Cares , ' but we ' ve done more_than our share , &quot; resident Bonnie Christensen said . The community was not told about the plan before approval was given , and it already has a number of homeless shelters , subsidized housing programs and churches that feed the hungry , residents said . The Navy is closing_down the Long_Beach Naval Station and will move_out enlisted personnel and their families from 44 buildings on the 27-acre site , which is surrounded by single-family homes_in San Pedro and Rancho Palos Verdes . Under federal law , homeless advocacy groups such_as Turner ' s Technical Institute are given priority on federal land that has been declared surplus . The Health and Human Services_Department decides which organization gets the property and has already approved the Turner ' s application to use the property . Turner ' s Technical is not required to get permission from the community , and the Navy &quot; can ' t arbitrarily overturn the decision by HHS , &quot; said Long_Beach Navy spokesman Lt . Carl Johnson . &quot; The Navy prefers that all parties come_to an agreement or compromise before we give our stamp of approval . Obviously , we recognize that that might not be possible in all cases , and we can ' t delay these matters indefinitely because that would n ' t be in keeping with the spirit of the legislation , &quot; Johnson said . Turner ' s Technical Institute made an impassioned plea for community support . Representatives say the housing will be used for an atypical group of homeless families and individuals , those displaced by natural disasters or the recession who are too proud to seek welfare help . They said the site would be gated , and no foot_traffic to or from the premises would be allowed . A committee with community representatives would rigorously screen applicants , and no substance_abusers would be accepted . Turner ' s Technical Institute will hold its own meeting to address public concerns at Dodson Junior_High_School in Rancho Palos Verdes on Tuesday . But the Concerned Citizens group said it will continue its opposition with petitions and more gatherings .</TEXT>
