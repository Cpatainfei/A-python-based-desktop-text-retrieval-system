   <HEADLINE> USDA ABOLISHES OLD CITRUS QUOTA SYSTEM ; AGRICULTURE : CHARGES OF CHEATING BY SUNKIST GROWERS AND OTHERS REPORTEDLY LED TO TURMOIL , COSTLY LAWSUITS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a repudiation of the giant citrus cooperative Sunkist Growers , the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture said Monday that it will abolish a scandal-ridden , Depression-era quota system that let growers keep oranges and lemons off the market to prop_up prices . The USDA said it took the action because accusations of widespread cheating on quotas by Sunkist and dozens of citrus growers and packers -- including two in Ventura County -- had led to &quot; division and turmoil &quot; within the California-Arizona citrus industry and dozens of costly lawsuits . The government ' s action is unlikely to bring immediate change in citrus prices or supplies . The quota system had been suspended since December , 1992 , and the season just ending operated free_of market constraints without radical changes in prices or per-acre revenues . Indeed , the fact that the orange market didn ' t collapse &quot; demonstrated that the industry could be profitable in a non-quota environment , &quot; said Rep . Calvin Dooley ( D-Fresno ) , who tried unsuccessfully to forge a consensus among the growers . The action was greeted euphorically by many independent growers and packers who had chafed under the cartel-like system , which they said rewarded inefficient growers and was controlled by Sunkist . Sunkist , based in Sherman Oaks , had no immediate comment . The co-op , which markets citrus for its 6 # 500 members who grow two-thirds of California ' s citrus , has long contended that quotas are needed to prevent sharp swings in supply and price volatility to consumers . But Richard Rominger , a California farmer who is also deputy secretary of USDA , said that he notified Sunkist personally of the decision Monday . While &quot; they may_not have been happy . . . they were resigned to the fact that this is probably the only thing left to do , &quot; he said . The government acted just a week before federal prosecutors were to go_to trial in Fresno in a decade-old case against Sequoia Orange Co. , a packinghouse that deliberately violated the quotas in the early 1980s to protest the system . That case , which put the Justice_Department in the position of prosecuting someone for growing too many oranges , was among more_than 60 pending lawsuits triggered by the system -- including 19 filed by the government last year accusing Sunkist and several of its biggest growers and packers of cheating on the system . Two large Ventura County packing houses were named in the suits -- Saticoy Lemon Assn . and Oxnard Lemon Co . As part of Monday ' s action , the government dropped all those suits . In Ventura County , where lemons and oranges account_for combined annual sales of more_than $ 200 million , an estimated 70 % of the county ' s citrus growers belong_to the Sunkist cooperative , according to J . Link Leavens of Leavens Ranches . Leavens and other local Sunkist growers said both growers and consumers benefited from the quotas and the government ' s action is a setback for both . &quot; It ' s certainly not a plus as far as we ' re concerned , &quot; said Leavens , whose family has an 800-acre citrus ranch in Moorpark . &quot; ( The quotas ) most definitely had a stabilizing effect in the marketplace. &quot; Leavens said consumers probably will not notice any change in lemon prices , because the quotas for lemons have not been enforced since 1990 . Rather , he said , the ending of quotas may cause dramatic price fluctuations for growers of navel_oranges . &quot; It ' s going_to cause some difficulty for the navel people , &quot; he said . Managers at the Santa Paula-based Limoneira Co. , a Sunkist grower whose 2 # 000-acre citrus ranch is one of the largest in the world , likewise expressed disappointment in the quota decision . &quot; If there is no marketing order , the consistency is just not there , &quot; Limoneira Executive_Vice_President Al Guilin said . &quot; Sometimes there ' s an oversupply , sometimes there ' s an undersupply. &quot; But James Moody , a Washington lawyer who has been instrumental in fighting such quotas , said , &quot; I don ' t think a progressive Democratic administration could tolerate being in the role of keeping food off the table. &quot; Rominger stressed that the federal agency still favors marketing orders , of which production quotas are considered the most onerous part . Such orders also let growers act together to promote and market their products . &quot; But because of all these violations , &quot; Rominger said in an interview , &quot; we don ' t believe ( the quotas ) have been operating as they ' re supposed to. &quot; The USDA said it would consider a new proposal for a citrus marketing order if the industry could ever agree on one , and Rominger said Sunkist officials indicated they might make such a proposal . Joel Nelsen , president of California Citrus Mutual , a trade group for 850 growers , said the association is scrambling to get a marketing order in place that could operate a statistical and crop forecasting service . Those functions were performed under the program being terminated . Critics and supporters generally agreed that Sunkist will survive the USDA ' s action , though its 65 % market share might fall . Sunkist ' s brand name and elaborate international marketing system still make_it attractive to many smaller growers . But without the quotas , some larger citrus growers and packers may decide to quit the cooperative , which would save them fees paid to Sunkist , and strike_out on_their_own . &quot; I ' m jumping up and down , &quot; said Dennis Johnston , a third-generation citrus farmer in Kern County . Johnston said that in the past , he ' s had to sell as_many as 75 # 000 40-pound boxes of navel_oranges to juice makers , getting_about 50 cents a box , because quotas prevented him from selling them as fresh fruit , for which he gets_about $ 8 a box . &quot; Now , it ' ll let me ship the fruit when I decide to ship , and not the boys who sit on the ( administrative ) committee , &quot; said Johnston , referring to the Sunkist-dominated committee of growers and packers who run the quota system by allocating orders to growers . The program will end after the expiration of a 60-day notice required by the 1937 legislation that authorized marketing orders . But many growers have said they would stick_with Sunkist because of the company ' s advertising and marketing prowess . In its latest fiscal_year ended Oct . 31 , Sunkist generated about $ 1.1 billion in revenue , $ 821 million of which it returned to its members .</TEXT>
