   <HEADLINE> CLINTON WILL GO SLOW ON PLEA TO EXPAND NATO ; DIPLOMACY : HE SAYS IT WOULD BE &quot; A CRITICAL MISTAKE &quot; TO EXTEND MEMBERSHIP TO EAST EUROPEAN_COUNTRIES NOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton said Wednesday that it would be &quot; a critical mistake &quot; to extend immediate NATO membership to East European_countries because doing so could fuel feelings of insecurity and nationalism in the former Soviet_Union . But he sought to reassure Poland and other former Soviet satellites that the United States remains committed to their freedom and economic development , and that full partnership with the West -- including NATO membership -- is still a likely prospect for the future . Clinton , interviewed at a White_House luncheon by a small group of journalists three days before he is to leave for critical summit_meetings with the heads of the NATO countries , Russia and Eastern Europe , presented a middle-ground approach designed to draw the former satellites closer to the Western Alliance without sowing alarm in Russia and Ukraine . Clinton ' s concern that Russia would react adversely to any early move to expand NATO ' s membership was underscored by Moscow ' s harsh reaction Wednesday to a decision by Lithuania to apply for membership in the organization , which was created at the outset of the Cold_War to halt Soviet expansionism . Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s spokesman warned that expanding NATO could evoke &quot; a negative reaction in Russian public_opinion &quot; and play into the hands of the country ' s extreme nationalists . Lithuania is the first former Soviet republic to seek admittance to the 16-nation alliance . Granting immediate NATO membership to East European_countries such_as Poland and the Czech Republic , as some have requested , does not have the support of all_the present NATO members , Clinton noted , and might ultimately have the effect of creating much the same kind of division that existed during the Cold_War . &quot; We don ' t want right now in 1994 to draw a new_line across Europe which will make the very people we ' re trying to support be , in_effect , more insecure , &quot; the President said . He noted that both Russia , with its historical fears of encirclement , and the politically and economically fragile Ukraine retain formidable nuclear arsenals . And ultranationalists have become increasingly vocal all across the former Soviet_Union . Instead of feeding such tendencies by a rapid expansion of NATO , Clinton suggested , the U.S. proposal for a &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; -- in which Russia as well as the East Europeans would be invited to take a series of tension-lowering steps leading to the prospect of eventual NATO membership -- offers the possibility of developing a broad-based alliance in which all members would be committed to peaceful coexistence . &quot; I think it ' s important to emphasize that we view it not as putting a limit on NATO membership , but as opening the door to fuller partnership , &quot; he said , adding , &quot; I think it clearly will lead , ultimately , to some more countries coming_into NATO at some point in the future. &quot; The U.S. goal , he said , is &quot; a Europe that is free_of the dividing lines of the past , instead of just moving them a little bit further east. &quot; While Clinton devoted considerable attention to the need to reassure Eastern Europe that it will not be abandoned to any future resurgence of Russian expansionism , he also emphasized the importance of reaffirming America ' s commitment to democracy and economic reform in Russia . The pace of economic reform should not be slowed , he said , but greater effort must be made to provide a safety net for individuals and families hurt by the transition from communism to free markets . One senior Administration official predicted Wednesday that Russia is likely to join the plan to bring the former Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe into Clinton ' s proposed Partnership for Peace . NATO members are expected to ratify the plan at their meeting Monday , and the official said he expects Russia to join &quot; very soon. &quot; The plan is designed gradually to draw into NATO all former Warsaw Pact countries that demonstrate their commitment to democratic principles and their willingness to work with NATO military powers . Russian officials themselves have given little public indication of which way they will go_on the proposal . Clinton said he had considered and rejected others ' views that if NATO does not take_in the European_countries while Russia is weak , once Russia is strong again it might refuse to let its former satellites join . It would take at least several years for Russia to become that strong , he said , if for no other reason than &quot; the enormous impact that the rampant inflation in Russia had_on the military capacity of the country. &quot; In pressing campaigns for earlier admission to NATO , some East European_countries , especially Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic , have cited fears of resurgent Russian nationalism fueled by the success of Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky and his party in the Dec . 12 Russian elections . Asked about Zhirinovsky ' s rise , Clinton said , &quot; I would n ' t say it scares me , but it concerns me. &quot; Declaring that many voted for Zhirinovsky and his party because they wanted to feel Russia was strong again , the President said : &quot; A lot of the bad_guys that have been elected in history got elected for reasons that didn ' t have anything to do with their most outrageous claims . And , yet , they did what they said they ' d do when they got_in . So it is a concern. &quot; Times staff writer Paul Richter contributed to this report .</TEXT>
