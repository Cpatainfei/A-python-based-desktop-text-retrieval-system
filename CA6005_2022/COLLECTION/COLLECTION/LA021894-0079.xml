   <HEADLINE> GUARDSMAN CREDITED WITH SAVING LIFE OF CHOKING BABY ; EMERGENCY : JASON BARTON AND A COLLEAGUE VISIT THE BOY AND HIS PARENTS A MONTH AFTER THE RESCUE AT A TENT CITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The last time Staff Sgt . Andrew Barajas and Specialist Jason Barton of the National_Guard saw 3-month-old Jeffrey Barcenas was at a tent city at Lanark Recreation Center after the earthquake . The infant was convulsing and choking . But on Thursday , nearly a month later , the two guardsmen saw a healthy -- and bawling -- baby boy in the arms of his beaming mother . A pediatrician had just declared the infant fit and credited quick action by Barton on Jan . 23 for saving the child ' s life . &quot; This makes everything I learned in the military well worth it , &quot; said Barton , 23 , an agent with an Upland mortgage lending firm who is in his first year with the Guard . &quot; To see the child now , and see the difference from when we first saw him . . . . I ' m just overjoyed. &quot; And Jeffrey ' s parents were grateful . &quot; I ' m glad they were there when we needed them , &quot; said the boy ' s mother , Erika Garcia , 20 , as she held her son , who was dressed in a Cookie Monster shirt and wore Mickey_Mouse booties . &quot; I just thank God and them , &quot; the boy ' s father , Efrain Barcenas , 25 , said , and then hugged Barajas . Barajas and Barton , assigned to the Army National_Guard ' s Company B 240 Signal Battalion out of Burbank , were putting_up tents at Lanark Park six days after the Jan . 17 quake forced thousands to flee to the safety of the outdoors . Shortly after noon that day , Barton , who is Red Cross-certified in cardiopulmonary_resuscitation and has taken emergency medical training classes , had just stabilized a child who had been suffering from a high fever and heat_exhaustion . He was walking back to his unit when Barajas brought Jeffrey to him . &quot; His face was reddish and he looked_like he was panicking , &quot; Barton recalled . &quot; He was choking on_his_own saliva. &quot; The mother told Barajas in Spanish that Jeffrey had a cold and a cough from sleeping outside in the park since the quake , and that she had given the baby a small dose of adult cough medicine . Seeing that the infant was having difficulty swallowing , Barton picked_up the child and held him in his arms face down . With paramedics en route , Barton put his little_finger in the baby ' s mouth to clear it and allow the saliva to flow downward . He held that position until paramedics arrived and took the child to nearby West Valley Hospital and Health Center , where he was stabilized . On Thursday , Garcia and Barcenas brought their child back to the hospital for a follow-up exam . Pediatrician Mojdeh Zafaranchi said Jeffrey was fine and should not suffer any aftereffects from his near-death experience . &quot; He could have died within a_few minutes if ( Barton ) had not cleared the baby ' s passageway , &quot; Zafaranchi said . &quot; He did the right thing at the right time. &quot; Meanwhile , Barton , who did not even know the child ' s name until Thursday , downplayed his heroism . &quot; I just reacted as if it was my own kid , &quot; said Barton , the father of two children ages 3 and 2 . &quot; I ' m just a citizen-soldier . It ' s part of the job to save and defend lives. &quot;</TEXT>
