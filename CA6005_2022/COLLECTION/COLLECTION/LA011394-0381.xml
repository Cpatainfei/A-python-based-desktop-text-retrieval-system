Villanueva , 25 , a mechanic from Santa Ana . He noted that similar demonstrations have been staged in San Francisco and other cities . Demonstrators carried placards reading &quot; Salinas -- Traitor &quot; while two dancers in feathered headdresses jumped to the beat of a bass_drum in front of the consulate on North Broadway . Inside , Consul General Felipe Soria Ayuso spoke_to several Mexican demonstrators . &quot; The Mexican government has been taking steps toward reforms , &quot; Soria told them .
