   <HEADLINE> CHIRAC TO SEEK FRENCH PRESIDENCY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mayor Jacques Chirac declared his candidacy for president Friday , intensifying the kind of struggle on the right that led to a Socialist victory in 1988 . The bid intensifies a bitter duel between Chirac and Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur , both members of the conservative Rally for the Republic party , to represent the right in the two-round elections in April and May . Balladur ' s enormous popularity since becoming prime_minister in April , 1993 , has eroded in recent weeks over scandals in his Cabinet and stubbornly high unemployment . Chirac , 61 , is considered slightly more conservative than Balladur , 65 . But both are likely to push ahead selling_off state companies and trimming social programs . The Socialists are banking on rising voter discontent with unemployment , which rose 0.1 % this week to 12.7 % , and with scandals now claiming members of Balladur ' s Cabinet .</TEXT>
