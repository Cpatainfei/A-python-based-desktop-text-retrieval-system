   <HEADLINE> ORANGE SCHOOL AWAITS SECESSION FROM DISTRICT ; EDUCATION : SANTIAGO WOULD BECOME COUNTY ' S FIRST CHARTER SCHOOL , JOINING 62 IN THE STATE FLYING SOLO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After 20 years of teaching history at Santiago Middle_School , Suzanne Bell-Dragoon dreams of early morning classes on Civil War-era dances to complement her lessons on that period . English_Department chairwoman Cathie Hunsberger imagines an hourly payroll of college_students to help grade papers . Robyn Tunstall , who coordinates Santiago ' s program for gifted and talented students , wants teachers from all subjects_to synchronize their curricula . All three are desperate to shrink classes , which ballooned as high as 42 students in one class last year . And they ' d love it if the air conditioner were fixed when it breaks -- not weeks later . The difference between this wish list and the one every educator keeps is that Santiago ' s staff plans to make these and other innovations reality by seceding from the troubled Orange Unified School District and functioning autonomously as Orange County ' s first &quot; charter school. &quot; Orange Unified trustees said they will approve Santiago ' s petition for independence at a meeting this week , making_it a self-governing school in control of its own budget and free from district and state mandates . Santiago would become the first charter school in the county , joining 62 others around the state that have decided to fly solo since the charter school concept was approved by the Legislature two years ago . &quot; It ' s very exciting because it ' s like you ' re controlling your own destiny , &quot; said Tunstall , who led the charge for a charter at Santiago . &quot; It ' s the sort of rhetoric that you ' ve read a_million times , but we honestly believe it. &quot; Added Hunsberger : &quot; The education system is in upheaval . Change is inevitable . We ' re better_off taking it by the horns than being told later on that this is what you have to do. &quot; Most of the previously approved charters are for elementary_schools scattered throughout 23 of California ' s counties . About 25 charter schools have been up and running_for a year . Thirty more are scheduled to open this fall . Santiago plans to begin operation as a charter school in September , 1995 . Some schools adopted charters in_order to specialize in the arts , technology , science or vocational_training , while others focused_on saving would-be dropouts . A handful are networks of parents receiving money from the state to teach their children at_home . In the Los Angeles Unified School District , for example , Westwood Elementary uses its charter to group students in multi-age , multi-grade &quot; families &quot; rather than traditional classes . A consortium of Palisades charter schools provides a cohesive humanities curriculum from kindergarten through 12th grade and requires students to perform community service . And a Pacoima charter school slashed class sizes from an average of 32 to 26 , added a computer lab and ended_up with a budget surplus during its first year of operation . &quot; Some pretty amazing schools have come_forward , &quot; said Sue Burr , the state Senate Education Committee staffer who authored the charter legislation . &quot; We got the question a lot : ' What ' s your idea of what a charter school should be ? ' We don ' t have an idea. &quot; Burr ' s boss , state Sen . Gary Hart ( D-Santa Barbara ) , says &quot; charter is a license to dream. &quot; At Santiago , the dream is to increase parent involvement , allow more flexibility for progressive teaching_methods and decrease class size . &quot; When I empower my staff to be in_charge of their domain -- even if it ' s just a little , itty-bitty domain -- they work harder , they work smarter , &quot; Santiago Principal Mary Ann Owsley explained . &quot; If you give people the ability to soar with the eagles , they do , because they don ' t work for somebody else anymore , they work for themselves , &quot; said Owsley , who began her career in Orange Unified a quarter-century ago as a Spanish teacher , and has since been a counselor , assistant principal and principal at various schools . &quot; If that ' s true on a smaller class-by-class basis , why can ' t it be true on a schoolwide basis ? &quot; According to Santiago ' s petition to the school_board , the charter school would emphasize cultural diversity and communication skills , with classes coordinated to address similar themes across subject_matter . Students and parents would have to sign contracts to attend , with parents required to donate time or money to the school . There would be a strict dress code and harsher discipline . Under Owsley ' s leadership , an appointed 13-member board of parents and staff , meeting monthly , would run the school . The arrangement is designed to give parents , teachers , the school ' s administrators and other staffers , who will be selected by their peers at the school , more clout in important decisions that affect students . The charter board ' s governing autonomy would be so complete that the seven-member Orange Unified school_board would have neither authority nor responsibility for the school . &quot; The main thrust is to make_it a partnership between the parents , the students , the teachers and the community -- to get more people involved in education , &quot; said Marvella McAllister , one of several parents who helped write the charter . One key element in the charter is the introduction of a two-tiered teaching staff . &quot; Master teachers &quot; would be credentialed educators , while lower-paid &quot; instructors &quot; -- who must have some college education but need not be trained as teachers -- would help ease the workload and save money . The charter plan ' s originators say &quot; instructors &quot; may include a retired engineer who assists with math , a museum curator helping with art history , or a concert guitarist teaching music . Other tentative plans for saving money include : * Aggressively fighting truancy , because state funding is tied to daily student attendance . * Changing cafeteria services to make a bigger profit on food sales without necessarily raising prices for students . * Seeking local companies to donate services such_as maintenance and gardening . Owsley also believes that teachers will try harder to save money -- perhaps by or taking fewer days_off -- if they believe they will reap the benefits directly in terms of smaller class sizes or increased resources . Santiago , a school of 877 students and 34 teachers that scores well on standardized tests and has been named a California &quot; distinguished school &quot; twice in the past five years , already has leaped to the forefront of reform efforts in the Orange Unified district . Becoming a charter school , staff_members believe , will free the school from the educational bureaucracy to experiment even more . They can try a new textbook , change the class schedule -- or the cafeteria schedule -- without filing stacks of state-required forms or having a string of meetings . &quot; We just want the reins , the official reins , &quot; Bell-Dragoon pointed_out . Charter schools must maintain a racial and ethnic balance similar to the populations in their attendance areas . They must be non-sectarian and cannot discriminate in enrollment . Beyond that , they are free from California ' s 6 # 000-page , 11-volume Education Code , and from district governance . Once approved , the charter is good for five years before it must be renewed . The only requirement is that the school set specific achievement standards and show results . It is hardly_a surprise that Orange County ' s first charter school comes_in Orange Unified , a district of 26 # 000 students whose central_office has long been in turmoil . Seven superintendents have headed the district since 1989 . Charter planners said getting_away from the district ' s woes was not a primary motivation , but admitted that administrative headaches &quot; downtown &quot; have made_it difficult to get top officials to focus_on education reform . Although unions and school_boards have typically opposed charters , Santiago has gained near-universal support , teachers and administrators said . That is in part because Santiago ' s charter would allow teachers to maintain their union memberships and seniority , and the school would continue contracting with Orange Unified for many services . To receive a charter , 50 % of a school ' s teachers -- or 10 % of those in an entire district -- must approve . At Santiago , 32 of the 34 teachers have supported the petition . Marilyn Moore , a veteran teacher who opposes the charter , declined to comment , and Sandy Reece Collier , the other teacher against the move , could not be reached last week . School_board members said they anticipate easy passage of the charter petition at their meeting Thursday . &quot; I ' m quite committed to any effort to decentralize the operations of our district in_order to provide a greater amount of authority closer to the students in the classroom , &quot; Trustee Robert Viviano said . &quot; There is a need in the school_system in_general to return more control and more responsiveness to the local schools. &quot; Bill Lewis , another school_board member , expressed concern that a small group of teachers or parents might take_over the school , or that the district would be held responsible_for problems at Santiago but have no recourse to address them . Still , he said he plans to support the charter petition . Many believe the charter will allow Santiago to serve as an experiment for Orange Unified and the county . Innovative teaching and funding mechanisms that work_at Santiago might be adopted by other schools . &quot; It ' s like having an R &amp; D unit , research and development , right in your own back yard , &quot; Trustee James Fearns said . Tunstall , Owsley and other key figures in the charter movement say the most crucial challenges still lie ahead . They must chart a specific course for the school over the coming year . Once it is transformed into a charter school , everyone expects the workload to increase . &quot; Even though we had close to 100 % of the staff say ' yes , we ' re interested in this , ' when you get_down to the nuts_and_bolts of asking people to change , it ' s scary , &quot; Hunsberger admitted . &quot; Unfortunately , teachers have been trained to follow the rules and have never been given the opportunity to be innovative , and now it ' s thrown into your lap . &quot; It ' s kind of like being a first-time parent and the baby is thrown into your lap , &quot; she added . &quot; It ' s exciting , but it ' s intimidating. &quot; Looking_for Autonomy Santiago Middle_School is hoping to become a self-governing school by seceding from the Orange Unified School District and adopting its own &quot; charter &quot; under a program approved by the Legislature two years ago .
