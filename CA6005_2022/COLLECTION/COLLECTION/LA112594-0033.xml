   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION ; REALITY BITES ' SENDING ' COUNTRIES ; PROP . 187 FALLOUT WILL LEAD TO REGULATION OF EMIGRATION FROM LATIN_AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just about everything that could be said and written_about Proposition 187 was published or stated before the Nov . 8 election , with one possible exception : what the actual consequences of approval might be for the home countries of the soon-to-be disentitled migrants , the 15 or so nations of Latin_America and the Caribbean that generate migratory flows representing , over time , more the 5 % of their total population . Leading this category are Mexico , most of Central_America , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru and the Caribbean states . ( Colombian and Caribbean emigrants are concentrated in the American East , but the ripples of Proposition 187 will be nationwide. ) For all these countries , the change in immigration altitudes in the United States will have a crucial impact . First , a shift in U.S. immigration policy may have a paradoxically beneficial impact on Latin_American immigration policy . Already Mexican President-elect Ernesto Zedillo , in a quick swing through El_Salvador and other Central_American_nations last week , was forced to acknowledge that Mexico ' s treatment of undocumented Salvadoran migrants is not much better , and often worse , than U.S. behavior toward Mexicans . This problem is far more widespread than is suspected , and extends beyond the case of Central and South_Americans passing_through Mexico on their way north . Bolivians and Paraguayans in Chile , Argentina and southern Brazil , Colombians in Venezuela , Peruvians just about everywhere -- all suffer many of the same manifestations of extortion , discrimination and human-rights abuses that Mexicans are subjected_to in the United States . In the coming confrontation on the fallout from Proposition 187 and in subsequent negotiations on migratory matters , Latin_American self-righteousness will appear particularly unseemly in the light of wanton abuses by immigration authorities south of the Rio Grande . Secondly and more important , most Latin_American governments , and above all Mexico , will now have to retreat from what had been a notably successful posture on emigration issues for nearly half a century : looking the other way . For Mexico , El_Salvador , Guatemala , the Dominican_Republic , Jamaica , Cuba ( in its own way ) , Ecuador and Peru , emigration has not only not been a problem ; it has functioned largely as a partial solution to many of these nations ' domestic dilemmas . True , the unemployment safety-valve theory is not totally accurate ; most emigrants have jobs and leave to seek better-paying ones . And there is a high cost involved for a society that sees its most dynamic and adventurous souls depart for another land . But by and large , the advantages of large-scale outflows , legal or not , far outweighed the drawbacks , which were , for the governments in_question , minor indeed : the indignity of abuses committed against Latin_American nationals by U.S. authorities , employers or rival minorities , and the political fallout from confronting or caving_in to Washington on these issues . The new attitude in the United States is adamantly for change in immigration policies , ranging from the Draconian remedies of Proposition 187 to the less emotional recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform . These , along with the Border_Patrol ' s stepped-up policing across from Tijuana and its blockade in El Paso , all indicate that Latin_American governments will no longer have the luxury of looking_away . The plight of &quot; undocumented &quot; Mexicans and other nationals in the United States -- their actual or perceived disentitlement to constitutional protection or even civil decency -- will be seen in the home countries as outright abuse , forcing governments to &quot; do something. &quot; Even so , migration will continue ; more rigorous enforcement of U.S. laws and borders will make crossing more difficult and expensive but not impossible . Herein lies the third consequence of Proposition 187 . It will in all likelihood put migratory matters where they have never really been in hemispheric relations : on the negotiating table . The Central_American presidents who met with Zedillo have already taken a first_step with their Mexican counterpart by deciding to include the migration issue on the agenda of the Western_Hemisphere summit in Miami next month . Many business and political_leaders in Mexico are now espousing the stance that very few ( including this writer ) staked out during the NAFTA debate : that Mexico should have pressed for a chapter on immigration , even if that meant complicating the treaty ' s ratification . But negotiations on migratory problems between generating and receiving countries are a complicated process . They generally end in a basic trade-off , as happened most recently between Washington and Havana : expanded legalization of out-migration in exchange for sharing the responsibility of regulating it . This does not necessarily mean that Mexico should patrol its own borders , as Fidel Castro basically agreed to do with the beaches of Cojimar . Nor does_it imply that the United States , after a decent interval , would begin , for example , to accept far more legal immigrants from El_Salvador than it publicly acknowledges , as it had done with the Cubans in Guantanamo . But it does signify that the governments of Latin_America must soon face a cruel conundrum . They will have to negotiate the numbers of their countrymen who wish to leave , by inference leaving the others to a cruel limbo . And in_order to reach agreements with the United States on these flows and their legality , they will be obliged to become involved in regulating them , by volume , destination , season and profession or type of skill . None of this will be easy or pleasant -- or palatable to large segments of Latin_American public_opinion . But if California ' s record of anticipating swings in U.S. public attitudes is any indication , it will be probably be unavoidable : The sentiment behind Proposition 187 seems to be here to stay , even if its details and mechanics are not .</TEXT>
