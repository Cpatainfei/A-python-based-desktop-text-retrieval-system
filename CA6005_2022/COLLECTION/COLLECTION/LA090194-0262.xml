   <TEXT> The control_room dials read zero . The uranium fuel rods are long gone . The cooling water , contaminated by radiation , has been drained into an underground holding tank . But the crew at this dismal nuclear_weapons plant , cut_into the South Carolina pine forest , has not yet locked the door or turned_off the industrial spotlights that burn around the clock at K reactor . The reactor remains on standby , ready to resume producing fuel for nuclear_weapons should urgent national security orders come from Washington . Upkeep for this and four other nuclear piles at Savannah_River -- all built before Elvis Presley made his first hit record -- requires a crew of 400 workers . The Cold_War may be over , but the nation ' s nuclear_weapons industry is hardly out of business . Although the United States quit producing bombs four years ago and has no plans to resume , the government is spending $ 4.4 billion this year on nuclear_weapons . About 73 # 000 people report to work every week at 11 active nuclear_weapons plants around the country , 41 # 000 of them maintaining America ' s huge nuclear_weapons stockpile and most of the rest doing environmental cleanup . Examination of the nuclear_weapons complex by many top experts , however , has left grave concerns about the adequacy of the Energy_Department ' s efforts to mind the bombs now that the end of the superpower arms race has lowered the profile of the nation ' s nuclear defenses . Even as U.S. concern grows_over an overseas black_market in plutonium and the proliferation of nuclear capability in the Third_World , senior Defense_Department officials , independent safety agency authorities , outside experts and even some Energy_Department executives warn of a whole other set of nuclear woes . They say : * The Energy_Department has no comprehensive plan for restructuring the nation ' s nuclear_weapons industry . Critics fault both Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary and James D . Watkins , her predecessor in the George_Bush Administration , for failing to deal quickly with such pressing issues as management and safety . * The nuclear_weapons bureaucracy is bloated , with too many workers and too_much capacity in areas where they are least needed . The Clinton_Administration has budgeted $ 4.4 billion for its nuclear_weapons program this year , down from a peak of $ 8 billion in 1990 , and some critics believe much deeper cuts are possible as the nuclear arsenal is slashed by about 80 % through the end of the century . * Paradoxically , the government is losing some of the employees it needs most in the new climate . At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory near San Francisco , for example , experienced bomb designers in the weapons directorate number only a dozen , many near retirement age . * The government has delayed investing in the new facilities it will need to ensure the safety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile . The United States quit producing nuclear bombs in 1990 , after the fall of the Berlin Wall . However , the government intends to keep a permanent stockpile of at least 6 # 000 warheads -- a sharp drop from the 30 # 000 bombs at the Cold_War ' s peak , but still an enormous stash and by far the world ' s most lethal . Minding those bombs is no cinch -- even without much concern in the United States , unlike overseas , about terrorists stealing plutonium . To ensure that the weapons are safe from accidental detonation and to guarantee that they will work reliably if they are needed , the government maintains a huge complex of laboratories , production_lines for non-nuclear parts , assembly sites and storage bunkers . The task is extraordinary , perhaps unique . Nobody has ever attempted to maintain any kind of electronic or mechanical_device in perfect working order for two or three decades -- the intended life of a nuclear_weapon -- without periodically testing or using it . And nuclear_weapons are not just any device . With an estimated 6 # 000 parts functioning next to a radioactive core and surrounded by up_to 100 pounds of conventional high_explosives , they are among the most complex industrial products in the world . &quot; Somebody has to deal with the long-term strategic issue here , &quot; Watkins said in an interview . &quot; What we want is to consolidate . . . cut costs , move some parts out_to private industry . I don ' t understand why this is not happening. &quot; Energy_Secretary O ' Leary rejects concerns -- even those of_her_own subordinates -- that nuclear bomb safety may be deteriorating . &quot; We are in a position where we can ensure the safety and reliability of the stockpile , &quot; she said in an interview . In fact , if there are problems with the way the nation ' s nuclear_weapons are managed , the blame is bipartisan . John Conway , chairman of the Nuclear Weapons Facilities Safety Board , an independent federal agency , has issued dozens of safety recommendations to the Energy_Department in recent years . Both Watkins and O ' Leary , he said , have failed to heed calls_for change from the safety board and others . * Whatever the merits of these charges , the problems run much deeper than politics . In a top-secret letter to O ' Leary in late May , Deputy Defense_Secretary John Deutch raised a red flag . &quot; We are concerned that the present ( Energy_Department ) nuclear_weapons research development and test budget does not provide sufficient resources to maintain the technological capability that is required for future nuclear_weapons missions , &quot; he wrote . Defense_Department officials , in a series of interviews , point to two particularly worrisome consequences of the Energy_Department ' s failure to devise a plan for the nuclear_weapons business . First , they say , O ' Leary has dragged her feet in deciding on a new source of tritium , an important explosive booster in hydrogen_bombs . Tritium decays radioactively and must be periodically replenished in weapons . The United States stopped making tritium at Savannah_River in 1988 , because of concerns about the safety of reactors there . After spending $ 2 billion to update K reactor -- a massive concrete ziggurat -- the decision to restart it was delayed and it continues in cold standby . But the lengthy shutdown has made_it highly unlikely that the reactor will be used again . The United States is_on course to run_short of tritium by 2008 ; construction on a new reactor must start as early as next year to fill the need . But O ' Leary said new tritium might not be available until 2010 . She called the two-year gap an &quot; acceptable &quot; shortfall -- an assertion that raises hackles at the Pentagon . Second , Defense_Department officials worry that the Energy_Department ' s 1996 budget , still under preparation , will be so small that weapons work_at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory -- one of two where bombs are designed -- will be dropped . Defense officials want two laboratories so that in the absence of underground testing -- which has been subject_to an informal global moratorium for five years -- each can review the other ' s work . &quot; The danger is that this is a complex where people have critical skills , &quot; said former Energy official Donald Kerr , an executive_vice_president at Science Applications International Corp. , a weapons contractor in San Diego . Tight budgets already have led the Energy_Department to stop work_on some nuclear safety enhancements , including a bomb trigger that would have used optical_fibers and lasers in place of electronic components . One weapons designer at the Energy_Department ' s Pinellas plant in Largo , Fla. , said the optical_devices would have been more resistant to electrical_disturbances , lightning and terrorism . The trick : To cut what is no longer needed and to keep what is , even as special_interests from coast to coast try to protect their own pieces of the nuclear_weapons business . * The saga of the Savannah_River plant shows how politically difficult achieving that goal will be . Savannah_River ' s patron in Washington is no less a figure than Sen . Strom Thurmond ( R-S.C. ) , whose 40 years of service make him the nation ' s most senior senator . And the plant , operated by Westinghouse Electric Corp. , is by far the largest employer in South Carolina . The plant ' s future &quot; is a very big deal , &quot; said Hunter Howard , executive_vice_president of the South Carolina Chamber_of_Commerce . A major cutback , he warned , &quot; would devastate the state ' s economy. &quot; After Savannah_River was built_in the 1950s , it operated five nuclear_reactors and two chemical_processing plants for making tritium and bomb-grade plutonium , the explosive pit in most U.S. weapons . Today , the plant ' s only job is to recycle tritium from old bombs , providing a source of the radioactive substance for the remaining stockpile . Despite 2 # 600 layoffs last year , Savannah_River has 18 # 000 workers , more_than it had at the peak of the Cold_War , according to Victor Rezendes , the General Accounting Office ' s top expert on nuclear_weapons . Although nearly half are working_on cleaning_up radioactive waste , 9 # 000 workers are collecting paychecks from the bomb production program -- even though no bombs are being produced . &quot; Do you think for a second that we could lay off 9 # 000 workers at Savannah_River even if we wanted to ? &quot; conceded one senior Energy_Department official . &quot; You have got_to be kidding . Even if we tried , Strom Thurmond would make_sure we had enough money so we couldn ' t do it. &quot; In his efforts to ensure Savannah_River ' s future , Thurmond has lashed_out at O ' Leary . &quot; It appears the men who built our successful nuclear deterrent have no impact and are ignored , &quot; Thurmond thundered in a Senate speech this summer . &quot; Mr. President , it is said that one of the first things Mrs . O ' Leary did at DOE was to take_down the pictures of nuclear warships like the Nautilus . Mr. President , that was a symbolic indication of what was to come. &quot; In a reflection of the success of the plant ' s patrons , the Energy_Department ' s own inspector_general has found Savannah_River ' s staff to be bloated . Its investigation asserted that 1 # 206 of Westinghouse ' s 3 # 088 managers were excess baggage , kept_on the payroll at a cost to taxpayers of $ 81.7 million annually . The January report found that Westinghouse workers took three times longer than standard industry practice to paint a wall and three times longer to seed a lawn . At the facility ' s 15 maintenance shops , workers required an average of 16 hours to change several standard water_filters -- not unlike residential filters -- compared with three hours for Navy workers . Westinghouse executives declined to be interviewed . Mario Fiori , the chief Energy_Department official managing the Savannah_River operation , said the work_force was no bigger than in 1988 , even though the administrative and environmental workload had increased . Fiori said he has tried to save money where he could , reducing lawn mowing along the roads , for example . And he manages to sell $ 3 million worth of timber from the site every year . But Christopher Payne , a noted nuclear critic at the Natural_Resources Defense Council , an environmental group in Washington , D.C. , called Savannah_River a &quot; boondoggle . . . . Sen . Thurmond and the rest of the South Carolina delegation is well-positioned to protect that plant , which is exactly what they are doing. &quot; Savannah_River is not the only nuclear_weapons installation drawing such flak . The House Energy and Commerce Committee found that workers at the Rocky Flats nuclear plant near Denver had so_much free_time that they set_up a volleyball_court . A committee investigator said supervisors eventually ordered that the games be played inside a top-security area , to avoid giving visitors a bad impression . * Even as the Energy_Department ' s rank_and_file resists change , one layer of the nation ' s nuclear_weapons managers is stampeding out of government service : those at the very top , who find little future in a dying industry and have the credentials to go elsewhere . Thus the Energy_Department is fast losing the top scientists who are_best positioned to maintain the reliability and safety of nuclear_weapons . As they depart , they are frequently leaving no substantial records about the bombs they designed . The Nuclear Weapons Facilities Safety Board reported last year that &quot; the level of scientific and technical expertise in the ( Energy_Department ) defense nuclear facilities and operations has been declining. &quot; Conway , the board ' s chairman , warned : &quot; A case can be made_for the need for greater vigilance now throughout the weapons complex because of increased risk of equipment mishaps in aged facilities , loss of technical expertise through attrition and downsizing and a reduced inclination for young engineers and scientists to get involved in the nuclear_weapons field. &quot; Some of the nation ' s leading nuclear_weapons contractors are also getting_out of the business . AT &amp; T , duPont and General Electric have recently walked away from Energy_Department contracts to run the bomb plants , a tacit vote of no confidence in the agency and a reflection that the contracts pose sizable liability risks . Former Energy_Secretary Watkins , in an acid letter to the GAO this summer , cited a &quot; decline of attentive , committed and skilled leadership among those who have the responsibility for maintaining a safe and credible nuclear_weapons posture. &quot; &quot; A lot of people have left . . . &quot; said Victor Reese , assistant Energy_secretary for the weapons program . &quot; As I ' m facing the new mission , which was described as a scientific stewardship program , I ' m not sure we might not have gone too far. &quot; In Reese ' s view , the problems posed by the nuclear_weapons are unprecedented . The average nuclear bomb , he says , is good for roughly 30 years before it must be torn_down and fully rebuilt . With a stockpile of 6 # 000 weapons , an average of 200 weapons will have to be replaced or remanufactured every year . &quot; These things age , &quot; Reese said . &quot; They were not designed to last for a long period_of_time . It ' s like an airplane that is designed for a 10-year life_cycle . Now , we expect it to last indefinitely into the future . How long , we don ' t know . You ' ll never get an opportunity to see if it works , but we ' ll expect it to work 10 years , 20 years , 30 years down. &quot; Failures have occurred in past tests when bombs fizzled , Reese said . Since 1950 , the Energy and Defense_departments have acknowledged 32 major accidents involving bombs , though none have been catastrophic . The Energy_Department has set an official standard that limits the probability of an accidental nuclear detonation to 1 in 1 billion . Despite the difficult tasks ahead , Reese acknowledged that the Energy_Department does not have a comprehensive , formal plan to restructure the industry , although it is making progress in developing such a plan . Critics are correct when they charge that the nuclear complex is as large today as it was during much of the Cold_War , Reese said . But the high costs are justified , he insisted , because many of the agency ' s big , old factories -- which still are needed -- have high fixed costs . In addition , the agency is dismantling 2 # 000 bombs per year , as well as storing many thousands of bombs in bunkers . &quot; You don ' t get that for nothing , &quot; he said . All this is happening just at a time when , in Reese ' s view , the nation needs to invest in major new facilities to conduct sophisticated computer simulations of weapons and advanced types of laser testing . These would cost billions of dollars . Critics such_as the NRDC ' s Payne and others in the arms control and environmental movements distrust these ideas , saying they betray an intent to perpetuate an unnecessarily large and costly nuclear_weapons complex . Payne argues there is no evidence that nuclear_weapons age in unpredictable ways . &quot; We have as much nuclear_weapons research as we ever will need , &quot; Payne said . &quot; We don ' t need a big , bulky nuclear research Establishment . We can afford to let these people go . We can let technical staffs atrophy. &quot; The root problem , critics contend , is the Pentagon ' s plan to maintain up_to 6 # 000 nuclear_warheads . Experts such_as Sidney Drell , the influential physicist who is director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator -- a nuclear physics research facility -- have argued that a stockpile of 1 # 000 to 1 # 500 weapons would provide sufficient deterrence for the future . With that many bombs , the entire nuclear complex could be consolidated to a single site , many experts contend . As the Cold_War was ending in 1989 , the Energy_Department was in the midst of an ambitious effort to rebuild the nuclear_weapons industry -- a project of which the $ 2 billion invested in Savannah_River ' s K reactor was only a small part . &quot; The Energy_Department was slow to recognize the political changes that were going_on in the world , &quot; said Rezendes , the GAO nuclear expert . &quot; As a result they still are coming_to grips with what the national nuclear strategy should be. &quot; Next : Physicists and politicians want to build a multibillion-dollar laser at California ' s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory . Critics call it nuclear pork . Where the Bombs Are Made Although the United States quit producing nuclear bombs four years ago and has no plans to resume , the government is spending $ 4.4 billion this year on nuclear_weapons . About 73 # 000 people work_at nuclear_weapons plants around the country--41 # 000 of them maintaining America ' s huge nuclear_weapons stockpile and most of the rest doing environmental cleanup .
