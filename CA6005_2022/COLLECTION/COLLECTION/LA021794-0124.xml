But McIntyre was not among the skiers wearing an armband . &quot; I didn ' t wear mine , frankly , because I forgot , &quot; she said . * Add McIntyre : Her parents came_to Lillehammer to watch her in the Olympics . McIntyre , who grew_up in New Hampshire but now lives_in Winter Park , Colo. , said her mother loves Norway . &quot; My mother raises sheep , &quot; she said . &quot; She weaves and knits .
