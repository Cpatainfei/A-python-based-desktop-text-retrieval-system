   <HEADLINE> COLLEAGUES IN TRIP LOSE FAITH IN O.C. MEDICAL MISSIONARY ; AID : HE SAYS TROUBLED CHINA OPERATION WAS ' SABOTAGED ' BY MUTINOUS GROUP OF DOCTORS WHO OUSTED HIM AS LEADER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mel Alexander sees himself as a globe-trotting medical missionary whose adventures in healing have taken him to Africa , Honduras , Mexico , Thailand and Nepal during the past three decades . As president of the Christian Medical Assn. , whose mailing_address is listed in Seal Beach , Alexander says there isn ' t anywhere his organization would n ' t go_to help the sick and poor . &quot; In 32 years , I can ' t tell you how many people we have helped , &quot; he said in an interview Thursday . &quot; By no means are we new_to this kind of thing. &quot; But a team of 89 physicians , nurses and support staff who accompanied Alexander on a 10-day mission to the Republic_of_China last month said Alexander ' s leadership -- or lack of it -- placed the group in a precarious position with government officials and sparked sensational headlines in the Hong Kong press . &quot; It was an international incident , but I didn ' t create it , &quot; Alexander said . Assembled from throughout the United States , Canada and New Zealand , the medical team was recruited by Alexander with the goal of treating an estimated 5 # 000 sick and poor residents of the south China city of Yibin . Alexander told the team that he had secured $ 3.5 million in medical supplies and equipment that would be donated to Yibin . Yet , when the health-care team arrived_at its destination Sept . 12 , physicians were confronted by angry Chinese authorities who had inspected the supplies that were shipped before the delegation ' s arrival . What the physicians found were crates of outdated medication , damaged or broken equipment and mildewed clothing , they said . Dr. James Ng of Irvine , one of several dentists on the mission , said one packing crate contained &quot; nothing at all. &quot; &quot; There were three boxes of old ( eyeglasses ) , like from the 1970s , &quot; Ng said . &quot; Another box was filled with stuff like old batteries , pencils -- stuff that you might dig_out of the cushions of your couch . I was appalled. &quot; Although the Chinese were expecting millions of dollars in supplies , the physicians said the shipment ' s value was more like $ 50 # 000 and only part of that could be salvaged . Alexander said various drug_companies and charitable organizations donated the supplies and provided the estimated value of $ 3.5 million . According to the physicians , however , Yibin officials were so irate over the condition of the supplies that they eventually called_in army troops who loaded the shipment onto two military trucks for transport to a grave dug on the banks of the Yangtze_River . &quot; They poured kerosene over it and lighted it , &quot; said Dr. Ralph Francis , a Nampa , Ida. , dentist who later was chosen by his colleagues to help lead the group . &quot; It was very embarrassing. &quot; With the delegation ' s relationship with Chinese officials growing more tense by the day , physicians said , they met privately to remove themselves from Alexander ' s leadership so they could try to salvage a mission that ultimately resulted in success in spite of initial problems . So estranged had Alexander become to the group that Francis said $ 500 was paid to remove Alexander ' s name from a granite monument that Chinese officials had erected on a hillside outside of town to commemorate the mission . &quot; We were in a very dire situation , &quot; said Calvin Howe of Heber Springs , Ark. , a member of the mission ' s support staff . &quot; But we managed to turn_around what could have been a tragedy . From a spiritual standpoint , it could only have been God that brought us out of there. &quot; Alexander , however , charged that the mission was &quot; sabotaged &quot; from the start by a mutinous group of physicians &quot; hungry for power. &quot; Two days after the group ' s arrival in Yibin , Alexander said , the doctors grew increasingly unhappy and engaged in an unwarranted &quot; coup d ' etat. &quot; Alexander acknowledged that Chinese officials were &quot; not satisfied &quot; with the number of physicians who had arrived nor were they happy with the quality of drugs and supplies_shipped from the United States . Alexander said he had initially hoped to bring as_many as 250 physicians and support staff , but that recruitment goal could not be accomplished . He said some who had expressed an interest in going_on the trip had to cancel for various reasons . The troubles , while unfortunate , were not unlike those encountered on the first days of other missions , said Alexander , adding that he is a retired physician with credentials from the University of Guadalajara in Mexico . &quot; The first day is always traumatic , &quot; said Marie Warner , Alexander ' s assistant , referring to past mission experiences . &quot; You have to work_through it. &quot; But Francis , Howe and others said the disorganization , embarrassing supply situation and growing tension with the Chinese authorities warranted the group ' s formal separation from Alexander . &quot; The local_government officials there felt drastically betrayed from the moment we arrived , &quot; Francis said . &quot; Things got fairly tense . As a group , we realized we were in trouble. &quot; Yibin officials could not be reached for comment , but the mission has been the focus of much attention in Hong Kong newspapers . Following a meeting of the physicians and others in the delegation , the group voted to reorganize leadership under Francis , Howe and Thomas Wu , a Seattle-based travel_agent who helped Alexander plan the trip . Wu said he met Alexander in August , 1993 . At that meeting , Wu talked_of his interest in trying to involve himself in medical missionary_work in China . Alexander , according to Wu , spoke_of his experience leading such medical missions and his interest in making a venture into China . &quot; I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to get involved , &quot; Wu said . &quot; He told me he had wanted to put_together a mission to China for 30 years but had no contacts. &quot; In January , the two arranged a trip to China , where they met with government officials and agreed that Yibin would be the site of their mission . &quot; We met with the proper authorities and we were very well received , &quot; Wu said . Wu said Alexander agreed to arrange recruitment of physicians , donations of medical supplies and equipment , while he would handle the travel arrangements and some communications with Chinese officials . According to Wu , shortly after their arrival in Yibin , the mission &quot; began to unravel. &quot; &quot; I guess I was too naive , &quot; Wu said . &quot; We should have looked in those boxes. &quot; Alexander blames most of the trouble on Wu . From the start , Alexander said , Wu wanted to take_control of the mission and helped engineer the leadership takeover once the group arrived in Yibin . While there is no argument that Alexander was voted_out as the group ' s leader , there is a dispute between the two sides over the immediate reaction of Chinese authorities . According to Alexander , Chinese officials attempted to persuade him to stay_on with the mission . Wu , Howe and others , however , claim that Chinese authorities suggested that Alexander leave the city . Alexander said he left Yibin on_his_own terms and was treated with respect by Chinese authorities . The U.S. Consulate ' s office in nearby Chengdu was notified by the physician group of the mission ' s troubles and later sent a summary of the delegation ' s activities in a report to the State_Department in Washington . A State_Department official Thursday confirmed receipt of that report in which American officials in Chengdu acknowledged that the mission was fraught with troubles . The State_Department official said the Chinese authorities were particularly &quot; disappointed &quot; that the &quot; quality of the medicines did not meet Chinese specifications. &quot; &quot; We were told a lot had to be burned , &quot; said the official , who spoke on condition that she not be named . According to the report filed with the State_Department , when the change in leadership took_place , the mission eventually became a success . Howe said that following Alexander ' s departure , the group worked &quot; overtime &quot; to turn the mission around . He said physicians shuttled among 10 local hospitals and eventually met the goal of treating 5 # 000 patients , performing nearly 100 operations . &quot; We had a problem , but we wanted to prove that this could be turned_into a success , &quot; Howe said . Francis said the group felt a need to uphold a reputation &quot; that as Americans we could not leave without doing the job right. &quot; Francis said that he was one of more_than 100 medical missionaries who accompanied Alexander on a trip to Nepal last October . The mission was sponsored by the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel in Los Angeles , which had arranged for Alexander to organize the effort . Trouble came almost immediately , Francis said , when half of the medical team was routed through Calcutta . Without proper visas , Francis said the group was placed in an airport compound until the group could arrange transportation to Nepal . Alexander said Francis ' story is a &quot; complete fabrication. &quot; But a Foursquare Church official familiar_with the mission confirmed Francis ' account . Although the Nepal mission &quot; eventually was a success , &quot; the church official , who did not want to be identified , said the trip was plagued by management problems . &quot; It was not organized as_good_as we thought it would be , &quot; the official said . &quot; We will not be using ( Christian Medical Assn. ) again. &quot; Francis said he agreed to go_along on the China trip when Alexander contacted him and assured him that the trip would be tightly organized . &quot; I also really wanted to see China , &quot; he said . Despite the troubles , Howe , Francis and Wu said the group eventually bonded with Yibin residents . When the mission was over , the city marked the occasion with a party and the unveiling of a monument in honor of the group ' s work . &quot; There was hugging and tears , &quot; Howe said . &quot; It was very emotional. &quot; But when the group learned that Alexander ' s name was also inscribed on the monument , Francis said , the physicians declined to participate in the ceremony until Alexander ' s name was removed . The medical team came_up the $ 500 it cost to take Alexander ' s name off the monument , Francis said . Times staff writer Mark I .
