   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; SCHNEIDER CAUGHT UP IN MIDDLE OF A MAELSTROM ; PROFILE : COUNTY ' S CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR WAS INVOLVED IN OVERSIGHT OF FUND . HE ' S BEEN CONSUMED BY CRISIS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ernie Schneider was_on county government ' s fast track . At 37 , he became the chief_executive assistant for then-County Supervisor Bruce Nestande . At 39 , Schneider leapfrogged over four older rivals to become head of the Environmental Management Agency , the county ' s planning department and largest , most powerful bureaucracy . At 42 , the Board of Supervisors tapped the tireless West German immigrant to become the county ' s administrative officer , one of the highest-paid government positions in the state . But at 47 , Schneider now finds himself surrounded by an enormous fiscal calamity that threatens the economic well-being of 187 governmental entities , including the one he has worked for almost 25 years . On Tuesday , more fallout from the nation ' s largest municipal bankruptcy reached Schneider ' s office , when the federal Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed him seeking a broad range of documents related to his possible dealings with bond brokerages , including Merrill Lynch , the county ' s top underwriter . What the SEC and other watchdog agencies find in their broadening investigation of the county ' s financial collapse could determine the future of one of the area ' s more respected and knowledgeable government officials . &quot; Schneider has incredible attention to duty and an enormous energy level . But I think he is dying a little bit every day because he is so conscientious , &quot; said County Supervisor William G . Steiner . &quot; I would hate to see Ernie Schneider become a scapegoat for this. &quot; Yet Schneider has been in the middle of the situation from the start . He sat on the county ' s investment oversight committee when County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron was pursuing what turned_out to be a disastrous investment strategy . Schneider ' s office received a copy of an internal audit by Auditor-Controller Steven E . Lewis released in August , 1993 , that assessed Citron ' s performance as treasurer in 1991 . Lewis concluded that Citron was bending the law to maximize returns from his investments , making risky financial deals and refusing to consult the committee that Schneider sat on . The audit also was distributed to the Board of Supervisors and the district_attorney . Nothing happened . The county administrative office as well as several department_heads share responsibility for placing items that the Board of Supervisors considers on its consent calendar , which is usually reserved for routine items that are all approved by a single vote . Some of Citron ' s now-controversial bond issues that involved hundreds of millions of dollars appeared on the consent calendar and were passed_by the board without debate or even a question . According to the county ' s agenda rules , contracts exceeding $ 500 # 000 in value should be placed on the board ' s discussion calendar , where there is potential for more consideration and debate . Though the CAO ' s office is required to enforce the agenda rules , Citron has the power to place items on the consent calendar without the office ' s review . &quot; I have the utmost admiration for Ernie Schneider , &quot; said Shirley Grindle , a longtime government activist who authored a series of county campaign finance reforms . &quot; But I don ' t think he is going_to come_out of this clean if he knew about that audit . He could come_in_for some severe criticism. &quot; Schneider declined to comment Tuesday except to say that the SEC action was a routine request for documents . He has said during the crisis that the oversight committee had no power to force Citron to do anything . Sharing duties with Schneider on the panel were Citron and Assistant Treasurer Matthew Raabe . Neither the CAO nor the Board of Supervisors can be held responsible_for what another public official elected countywide has done , Schneider has said . &quot; Responsibility for managing the pool lies_with a separately elected official , and that was Bob Citron. &quot; Schneider , however , was one of the first people in county government to seriously heed warnings about the investment pool after Raabe confronted him in early November and threatened to quit . County sources said Schneider then formed a management team to review the status of the $ 20-billion portfolio . By then it was too late . Since the fund collapsed more_than two weeks ago , Schneider has been consumed by the crisis . Long known as a workhorse , he has been putting_in even longer days figuring_out how to keep the county government in_operation , and helping to make hard decisions about potential cuts_in personnel , and county services and capital improvement projects . Schneider also has briefed the cities , utility districts , and schools that rely_on funds from the investment portfolio to meet their financial_obligations . And it was the county administrative officer who personally met with Citron at his Santa Ana home on Dec . 4 , hand-delivering the resignation letter that Citron signed . &quot; I don ' t see how he is still walking , &quot; Supervisor Steiner said . &quot; Everyone else on his staff has had some time to rest. &quot; Schneider has a reputation for self-confidence , assertiveness and a willingness to accept responsibility , once saying upon his appointment to the Environmental Management Agency that &quot; the buck stopped at my desk in this deal. &quot; Known as a consensus builder with an extensive knowledge of Orange County government , he has been praised repeatedly for his management style and the treatment of his staff . In his leisure_time , Schneider surfs , lifts weights and runs in marathons . A favorite lunchtime haunt -- before it closed -- was the Santa Ana YMCA , not far from the county administration building . &quot; I have had nothing but positive dealings with him , &quot; said Costa Mesa City_Manager Allan L . Roeder . &quot; He has been upfront and direct with me . that ' s not to say that he tells me what I always want to hear . But I found him to be credible in what he tells me. &quot; Roeder said he does not know whether Schneider committed any wrongdoing or ethical breaches related to the investment pool . But he said he and other city leaders have been disappointed lately by the total lack of information coming_out of the county about the fiscal crisis . He added , however , that the situation might not be Schneider ' s fault . Supervisor Thomas F . Riley , a former Marine Corps brigadier_general who is retiring after 20 years on the board , described Schneider as &quot; loyal , trustworthy and courageous &quot; -- words right out of the Boy_Scout creed . &quot; I would be disappointed if this challenges his ability to remain as CAO , &quot; Riley said . Supervisor Roger R . Stanton , who has been critical of Schneider in the past , declined to comment Tuesday . Stanton recently moved to take some of the responsibility for handling the crisis away from the county administrative officer . At Stanton ' s request , the Board of Supervisors went_along with his idea to set_up a management committee to review proposed budget_cuts . On the panel are new Supervisors Chairman Gaddi H . Vasquez , Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates , Dist . Atty . Michael R . Capizzi and Thomas E . Uram , head of the county Health_Care Agency . Whether or not Schneider ends_up shouldering any of the blame , the job he holds could be redefined and his office subject_to restructuring . Steiner said the board might give the position the same responsibilities as a corporate chief_executive_officer , giving him greater authority over county departments , and possibly eliminating some elected positions . The Board of Supervisors has complained in the past that it is difficult to oversee and take concrete steps against an elected department_head , such_as the county treasurer , auditor-controller , the tax_assessor and the county clerk-recorder . &quot; Right now , the CAO can ' t tell the county auditor and county treasurer what to do or any elected department_head what to do , &quot; Steiner said . &quot; If the CAO is going_to be held to a high level of responsibility , his role has to be strengthened. &quot; Profile : Ernie Schneider Occupation : County administrative officer Age : 47 Born : Christmas_Day , 1946 , in Bad-Kissingen , West Germany Home : San Clemente Family : Married , one son Education : Bachelor ' s degree in political_science and master ' s degree in public administration from Cal State Fullerton Salary : $ 140 # 940</TEXT>
