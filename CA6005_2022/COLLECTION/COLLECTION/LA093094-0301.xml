   <HEADLINE> HOME ENTERTAINMENT ; TAKING A CLOSER LOOK_AT GENIE ' S EVERY MOVE ; QUALITY ANIMATION AND LASER TECHNOLOGY OPEN UP A WHOLE NEW_WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES ON DISNEY ' S ' ALADDIN. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Robin Williams ' performance as the Genie in Walt Disney ' s &quot; Aladdin &quot; was too fast and furious for you to keep_up with in the theater , try the new standard-play laser just released by Walt Disney Home Video ( $ 50 ) . It gives you a chance to slow_down and replay his transformations so you can catch every shape , every move and every joke no matter how quickly they come and go . In this two-disc THX set , &quot; Aladdin &quot; flies , flails and flings about the room in lush , full-bodied color . You can even play the film one frame at a time to get_at the secrets of marrying traditional animation with computer and paintbrush technology . Not to mention the rapid dialogue and vocal tricks of the talented cast . High-quality animation and top-drawer laser technology were made_for each other , and this 1992 Oscar-winner offers a sumptuous audio and visual feast . The Academy Award-winning score by Alan Menken , Howard Ashman and Tim Rice never sounded better . Clearly delineated chapter stops identify every song , including the Oscar-winner &quot; A Whole New World , &quot; in a handsomely designed sleeved jacket , with charming drawings of the main characters . If all this whets your appetite for more , if less elaborately presented , Disneyana , you need only turn_to the company ' s &quot; Walt Disney Mini Classics &quot; and &quot; Cartoon Classics &quot; laser series . A delightful double bill ( $ 37 ) serves_up &quot; Mickey and the Beanstalk &quot; and &quot; The Reluctant Dragon. &quot; Other pairings in the &quot; Cartoon Classics &quot; series ( $ 25 apiece ) offer a double bill &quot; Starring Mickey and Minnie and Chip ' n ' Dale , &quot; which includes 1938 ' s &quot; The Brave Little Tailor &quot; among six offerings ; another pairing of &quot; Here ' s Mickey ! &quot; with &quot; Here ' s Pluto ! &quot; takes_in adventures from 1935 ( &quot; Mickey ' s Garden &quot; ) through the early and mid- ' 40s . A dog of an entirely different mien , the TV series &quot; Family Dog &quot; from Amblin Entertainment , follows the ill-fated bug-eyed canine through 10 episodes on a five-disc set from MCA Universal Home Video ( $ 90 ) . If you blinked and missed executive producers Tim Burton / Steven Spielberg / Dennis Klein ' s quirky take_on a bizarre little_dog ' s view of family life , you can catch_it all at your leisure here .
