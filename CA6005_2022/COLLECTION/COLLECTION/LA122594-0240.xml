   <TEXT> He holds the hands of Japan ' s top leaders , manages conflict among warring bureaucrats and , in a pinch , delivers decisions on major policies : Nobuo Ishihara is little known abroad . But here he is called the shadow prime_minister . A quintessential government blueblood , Ishihara is a Tokyo University graduate who excelled in finance , made powerful friends and scaled the ministry ranks . Now , having served as top aide to seven prime_ministers , the deputy chief Cabinet secretary has quietly played critical roles in everything from the Gulf War crisis to U.S.-Japan trade talks . In the fall of 1993 , officials here were deadlocked over American demands that Japan open its construction market . With time running_out , Ishihara called the top construction bureaucrat into his office and told him flatly of the proposed solution : &quot; You have to accept this. &quot; In such ways , Ishihara -- and the unelected , ultimately unaccountable bureaucrats he represents -- make vital decisions for Japan behind closed doors . These civil_servants make_up what may be the world ' s mightiest bureaucracy : 838 # 000 people in 19 national agencies , some of Japan ' s most brilliant minds and powerful ambitions cloaked in the gray suits and bland speech of government service . The bureaucrats have steadied Japan through 18 months of uproar -- four prime_ministers , the shattering of the Liberal Democratic Party ' s 38-year rule and a perplexing number of new party alliances . For more_than a century , they have largely decided Japan ' s direction , scripting policies as feudal_lords once did for puppet emperors . Indeed , in a nod to their elite training and lofty tradition , they once were called okami , &quot; the honorable above. &quot; But now the fabled okami are falling from grace . The mandarins of Japan ' s economic miracle are under_fire for sabotaging the nation ' s future . In a debate that cuts_to the core of just who will steer Japan , more and more critics insist that the bureaucrats must loosen their grip and let elected officials usher_in badly needed change . In a startling outbreak of bureaucrat-bashing , bookstores are filled with works such_as &quot; The Finance Ministry Dictatorship &quot; and &quot; The Island of Bureaucratic Control : Japan in Danger. &quot; The respected financial journal Nihon Keizai Shimbun , the NHK television network and other media have devoted extensive series to the evils of bureaucratic rule , while the issue has become a leading target for political reform . The chorus of voices carry a singular message : The bureaucratic blueprint that has driven Japan for 50 years -- the relentless expansion of its industrial , productive strength -- risks impoverishing the Japanese people and inviting the enmity of the world . The bureaucrats ' work is credited with helping to make Japan rich . But , critics say , the focus_on economic expansion has also led to a stubborn trade surplus that is alienating other nations and boosting the yen to stratospheric levels . Pressed to compete under a pricey currency , more firms are fleeing to lower-cost countries , taking jobs and critical manufacturing capacity with them . That , in turn , is fueling fears that Japan is &quot; hollowing_out , &quot; retaining weak industries at_home and losing its competitive edge . The bureaucrats ' power base -- a bewildering maze of 11 # 000 official regulations -- also has helped make prices here the highest in the world . Their turf battles are thwarting development of leading technologies . Japan ' s information highway is still a dirt road , for instance , because ministry wars are impeding the nation ' s progress in wiring itself with the fiber-optic cables of the future . At the same time , a world that until now tolerated Japan ' s system is making noisy demands for change . The United States put_up with Japan ' s export juggernaut and its sheltered markets in consideration of its Cold_War alliance . But Americans are more vigorously defending their economic interests . Japan is also being pressed to leave the comfort of its political cocoon and to tackle world problems more actively . To meet rapidly changing circumstances , nothing short of a radical reordering in how Japan governs itself is needed , officials say . &quot; In the past , we tried to achieve economic success putting ideology aside , and under those circumstances , I think bureaucrats were much more important than politicians , &quot; said Koichi Kato , head of the Liberal Democrats ' policy research council , who has coordinated issues with the Socialists and the New Party Harbinger since they jointly took power in June . &quot; But now , we need a new vision of what to cultivate for society , and that , by definition , cannot come from bureaucrats , &quot; Kato said . &quot; So it is time for politicians , not bureaucrats. &quot; Many bureaucrats -- most of whom would only speak anonymously -- agree that Japan desperately needs a new direction . But they say most politicians are incapable of providing it because they are too ill-informed on the issues , consumed with reelection and busy taking_care of constituents . That is why bureaucrats end_up writing most legislation and why some of Japan ' s intelligentsia shudder at the thought of entrusting the nation ' s direction to elected officials . &quot; The politicians don ' t have the know-how -- the information and experience -- to govern Japan as_a_whole , &quot; said Kojiro Shiraishi , a Yomiuri Shimbun editorial writer . &quot; I know bureaucrat-bashing is rampant in Japan . But the question is , Who should take the initiative in changing the system dominated by bureaucrats ? The politicians should , but they are not_able to. &quot; And despite widespread public complaints -- one newspaper poll this year showed more people view bureaucrats as snooty , irresponsible and cunning than as excellent -- requests for protectionist red_tape come from the public itself : Officials tell endless tales of local pleas for help with everything from cheap Chinese lacquerware to discount beer to new propane gas dealers . Indeed , the interlocking interests of bureaucrats , politicians and business are so entrenched that the relationship is known as the &quot; Iron Triangle. &quot; Business implores bureaucrats to use their regulatory power to protect markets and rewards them with cushy post-retirement jobs . Politicians serve as mediators between bureaucrats and their business constituents , usually receiving political contributions for their trouble . As a result of the entangled interests , merely disarming bureaucrats won ' t in itself open Japan ' s markets or nudge it down a new national path . The entire system must begin to change -- a process that will take at least 10 years and heavy foreign pressure , says Tomoaki Iwai , a Tokiwa University political_science professor . And , he says , &quot; No one wants to give_up their vested_interests -- not the politicians , bureaucrats or people. &quot; * The reality of Japan ' s political culture -- and how difficult it will be to reorder the institutional roles played -- was aptly illustrated by the phenomenon of Morihiro Hosokawa . Tall and handsome , Hosokawa boasted an aristocratic bloodline and talked_of bringing politics back to the people . He electrified the apathetic public and was anointed prime_minister last year to lead the first government not headed by the Liberal Democratic Party in four decades . He vowed then to end corruption , break_open Japan ' s markets , slash red_tape , face the nation ' s war history and bring greater benefits to a_people still saddled with cramped homes , high prices and hellish commutes . But today , Hosokawa is history -- beaten_down by the status_quo he pledged to smash , dominated by the bureaucrats he declared he would tame . Japanese media reports portray a man out of his league who lacked the policy knowledge and personal connections within government to push a coherent agenda . He could barely keep_up with the blizzard of briefings on everything from North_Korea to U.S. trade talks . His most common response to bureaucrats was a plaintive &quot; So what shall I do ? &quot; according to stories leaked by them . Yet even politicians with policy knowledge say they too buckled under the bureaucracy ' s weight . Yoshio Terasawa , a financial expert , left the World_Bank to join Hosokawa ' s now-defunct Japan New Party and was elected to the upper house of Parliament last year . In April , he was tapped to head the Economic Planning Agency under the second coalition government of then-Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata . Terasawa came_in hoping to invigorate Japan ' s moribund economy . But meetings from 8 a.m. until past midnight left him with no time to think on_his_own . Instead , he says , he had to swallow information fed him in daily briefings by a team of bureaucrats . His own assertions were dismissed . Agency apparatchiks had projected a 2.4 % economic_growth rate ; Terasawa found that ridiculous . But when he protested that every private estimate projected less than 1 % growth , he was told never to say that in public because it would force the government to recalculate the entire national budget , which was based on the higher rate . He complied . &quot; I felt very much like a puppet , &quot; he confessed . Such experiences illustrate some of the bureaucracy ' s greatest advantages -- its access to information and sheer intellectual talent . It has long been so . Japan ' s modern bureaucracy traces its roots to the samurai who went_to serve the emperor after the Meiji Revolution ended the shogunate in 1868 . When Japan ended three centuries of isolation in the late 19th Century , the bureaucrats rapidly introduced Western modernization . And after World_War_II , when they dreamed_up the policies that led the shattered nation to economic supremacy , the legend of their invincibility grew . The corps still draws Japan ' s elite : graduates from the most prestigious universities who have out-competed thousands of others in civil_service exams . The top-ranked recruits are overwhelmingly male and dominated by Tokyo University ; 11 of the nation ' s top 12 ministry chiefs are Tokyo graduates , forming an academic clique akin to Harvard alumni running every top department of the U.S._government . Of 287 people who passed the highest of three civil_service exam levels in 1994 , 90 % were male . Tokyo University graduates made_up 90.5 % of new recruits for the powerful Finance Ministry , 78 % for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry , and 51 % overall . The bureaucrats often work until early morning in voluntary overtime , squeezed cheek by jowl with colleagues in cluttered offices . Their desks overflow with paper ; cigarette smoke often hangs_in the air . The setting is surprisingly low-tech ; there are few computers . Bureaucrats pledge lifelong loyalty to one ministry . Although sometimes lent to other agencies , they never make a permanent jump . Only when they are bypassed for promotion do they find jobs in private industry -- often one they regulate . This practice is known as amakudari , or &quot; descent from heaven. &quot; It is routinely criticized as a conflict_of_interest , but little has been done to stop it , since it serves as a practical way to cycle out aging bureaucrats . Amakudari , though , also provides a way to spread bureaucrats ' influence throughout Japanese society . Top officials of many private firms and nearly half the executives of special public corporations are retired bureaucrats ; so are an estimated one-third of Liberal Democratic Party politicians . Wherever they land , they continue to nurture ties to their former ministries . Such loyalty provides the foundation for Japan ' s vaunted institutional stability . After 35 years of service , Yuji Tanahashi reached the position of vice minister of international trade before retiring in 1993 . He can rattle_off a history of negotiations with the United States from firsthand experience : tensions over cameras and watches in the 1960s , color_TVs in the 1970s and semiconductors and cars in the 1980s . He also boasts extensive knowledge of the Japanese economy , having helped execute the plan that rebuilt the nation , first with steel and other heavy industries , then with consumer electronics and now with information processing . That kind of experience is often cited to explain why Japanese trade officials arguably out-negotiate their American counterparts , who often change with each new Administration . To complete their elite course , Japan ' s career-track bureaucrats rotate posts every few years to gain exposure to different fields -- and to prevent such overly cozy ties with industry as those that produced scandals involving construction and telecommunications officials . Midori Tani , for instance , is a fast-track career officer in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry . One of only two female directors in MITI , she has worked in divisions covering energy , technology and small and medium-sized business ; she labored 30 hours straight analyzing the oil market during the Gulf War crisis and last year was tapped to author MITI ' s annual policy paper . Her paper was widely picked_up in the media for its emphasis on Japan ' s need to deregulate and improve its investment climate -- a conclusion she reached after months of research , interviews with business_executives and trips to factories both in Japan and elsewhere in Asia . Armed with fluent English and an aggressive intellect , Tani , 39 , says she enjoys sharp policy debate &quot; to stir_up my brain. &quot; &quot; Some people say that bureaucrats fight each other thinking only of_their_own interests , but I disagree , &quot; she said . &quot; In order to foster critical thinking , you need someone to disagree_with you. &quot; Not all bureaucrats , of course , exhibit such high energy . Masao Miyamoto , a Health Ministry official , says many bureaucrats while_away the day reading newspapers , writing vague answers to parliamentary committee questions and &quot; free-talking &quot; in meetings that lead nowhere . He describes petty office politics in which colleagues pick on those who question the status_quo or who refuse to sacrifice their personal lives for their jobs . The bureaucracy ' s overall talent , however , enables it to function as the nation ' s brain -- and the role is unchallenged because Japan lacks competing institutions such_as strong academic think_tanks or policy-making staff in the Parliament or the prime_minister ' s office . * Not only politicians but also journalists and the public advisory councils all depend_on ministries for information . The Finance Ministry is Japan ' s most dominant , in part , because of its budget authority , which makes_it the nation ' s sole repository of information from every_other agency . And bureaucrats hoard their information like jewels and surrender it sparingly and strategically . One trade official said they accommodate requests from ruling party leaders with reams of information personally delivered by top bureaucrats ; Communist_Party requests , in contrast , are handled with a page or two of notes sent by messenger . Still , bureaucrats are hardly all-powerful . Analysts say that Liberal Democratic leaders , boasting more experience and connections than the Hosokawa government , are gaining greater political control . And politicians still hold the trump_card -- the right to pass laws that bureaucrats propose -- which they use to haggle for such benefits as new public works projects or increased farm subsidies . But the bureaucratic genius , analysts say , lies_in the bureaucrats ' consummate skill in knowing whom to approach and how to win support . Jiro Saito is said to be the most powerful person in the most powerful ministry in Japan : vice minister_of_finance . Unlike most of the nation ' s polished top bureaucrats , Saito , 58 , is neither articulate nor particularly social -- he is said to decline most party invitations and buries himself in work and the game of go . But he is regarded_as the Finance Ministry ' s budget brain extraordinaire , and defending the integrity of the national spending plan is said to be his single , overriding goal . According to media reports , Saito and his ministry allies hatched February ' s notorious proposal to increase the 3 % consumption tax to 7 % . To push the plan through , he targeted Ichiro Ozawa , the Hosokawa government ' s strategic mastermind , as a key ally . The two secretly persuaded Hosokawa to announce the plan at a 1 a.m. news_conference -- a disastrous move that sparked a public outcry . But Saito did not give_up . Even after the Socialists and New Party Harbinger , which opposed the tax_hike , formed the present government with the Liberal Democrats in June , Saito simply plotted around his critics . He bypassed Finance_Minister Masayoshi Takemura , who advocated cutting government fat first . Instead , he appealed directly to Noboru Takeshita , the influential Liberal Democratic lawmaker who , as prime_minister , pushed_through the original consumption tax in 1989 . The scheme worked . A 5 % tax increase was approved last month . &quot; You Finance Ministry guys are skillful , aren ' t you ? &quot; a defeated Takemura was quoted as saying to Saito . ( Saito declined an interview request. ) Critics point to the consumption-tax coup as evidence of how bureaucrats dominate Japan , arguably at public expense . They have , for instance , basically thumbed their nose at orders to streamline the government under Prime_Minister Tomoiichi Murayama ' s administrative reform . Asked to cut the 92 special public corporations -- basically employment havens for retired bureaucrats whose tasks range from stabilizing silk prices to promoting bicycles -- the ministries gave their response last month : Not one was dispensable . The campaign to cut red_tape is also lagging . Among more_than 1 # 100 regulations proposed for elimination by business_leaders and others , ministries have already rescued 91 as necessary or needing &quot; further study &quot; ; bureaucrats are likely to defend more . While deregulation may benefit the bold , it shakes_up the interests that keep prices uniformly high . One of the most damaging examples of how bureaucrats protect their own interests at public expense , critics say , is multimedia development . Japan has barely begun to lay the network of fiber-optic cables needed to carry the huge volume of data used in information processing . The reasons : turf wars among ministries and a 30-year-old law that does not explicitly allow such cables in the underground tunnels that carry water , telephone , electricity and gas_lines . Rather than simply changing the law to accommodate cable , the ministries are thinking_about burrowing a vast new network of tunnels . That plan is enormously more expensive and will take years to complete . But engineering a budget increase -- which amounts to expanded power -- is the name of the bureaucratic game , analysts say . Meanwhile , MITI is warring with the Telecommunications Ministry over the overall strategy , arguing that software development -- its turf -- should take priority . Critics fear that such bureaucratic battles are sabotaging Japan ' s future . Sensing the gathering crisis , some MITI officials have begun trying to take the lead in opening markets and cutting_through the regulatory jungle . But each attempt to deregulate runs_afoul of other ministry fiefdoms . &quot; In order to get beyond this wall , we need political leadership , &quot; one MITI official said in despair . But there are questions as_to whether Japan ' s politicians can provide it . Megumi Shimizu and Chiaki Kitada of The Times ' Tokyo Bureau contributed to this report .
