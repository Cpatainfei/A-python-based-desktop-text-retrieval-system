   <HEADLINE> AGAIN FLORIDA-BOUND , STORM IS FADING ; WEATHER : AFTER A DESTRUCTIVE ZIGZAG TRAIL IN THE CARIBBEAN AND ATLANTIC , FORECASTERS SAY IT COULD SOON BE DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tropical Storm Gordon rolled back toward Florida on Saturday , a shadow of its former hurricane self , and will probably die_out before it hits the peninsula . &quot; It ' s continuing to weaken , &quot; said Max Mayfield , a meteorologist for the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables . &quot; It could be downgraded soon to a tropical depression. &quot; Gordon , born Nov . 8 off the tip of Nicaragua , zigzagged as a tropical storm through the Caribbean , killing more_than 500 people in Haiti , before snaking across Florida , where it battered homes and crops . Gordon next slid into the Atlantic , where it strengthened into a hurricane and brushed the coastal Outer Banks of North Carolina . Four beach_houses were toppled by high surf on the Outer Banks , but three had already been condemned because of damage from previous storms . Part of the highway that links the chain of islands was undercut by erosion . Beach-goers were out with sail boards Saturday as the storm trailed away to the south . &quot; The wind ' s howling . It ' s great out there , &quot; said Edward Yerkovich of Buffalo , N.Y. , as he hauled his board out of Roanoke Sound . At 10 p.m. EST , Gordon was about 335 miles east of Daytona Beach . It was moving south at 8 m.p.h. and a gradual turn toward Florida was expected in the next 24 hours . Forecasters said it should be a depression by today . Its sustained wind speed had dropped from 70 m.p.h. early Friday to near 40 m.p.h. Once its wind drops below 39 m.p.h. , it will be reclassified as a tropical depression . Strong northwesterly wind weakened its drenching thunderstorms , and its barometric_pressure had increased , easing the threat of more rain , meteorologists said . Gordon may have cost Florida ' s agriculture industry $ 336 million , the state_Department of Agriculture said Saturday . The state grows about half of the nation ' s winter vegetables , including squash , sweet_corn , tomatoes and potatoes . As a result of Gordon , some producer and retail vegetable prices could rise as much as 20 % on the East Coast . Gordon also damaged homes_in Florida . Gov . Lawton Chiles on Saturday asked President Clinton to designate the counties hardest hit by Gordon as disaster_areas . If granted , federal grants or low-interest loans would be available to help people recoup their losses . Damage estimates are still coming_in , so Chiles did not specify which counties he wanted declared disaster_areas .</TEXT>
