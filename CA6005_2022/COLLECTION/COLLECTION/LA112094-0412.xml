   <HEADLINE> REPUBLICANS UNLIKELY TO GIVE CLINTON FREE_REIN TO MAKE FOREIGN_POLICY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Bill_Clinton had any thought of spending the next two years as a foreign_policy President , some of Congress ' new Republican leaders are warning that he ' d better think again . Like Sen . Bob Dole of Kansas , the incoming majority_leader , who says he wants U.S. troops in Haiti home by Thanksgiving -- not next March , as Clinton plans . Or Sen . Jesse Helms ( R-N.C. ) , the next chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , who calls foreign_aid a &quot; rat hole &quot; and says the U.S. effort to broker peace between Israel and Syria is a bad idea . Or Sen . Frank H . Murkowski of Alaska , probable chairman of the Energy and Natural_Resources Committee , who wants to block funds to carry_out Clinton ' s nuclear deal with North_Korea . The Republicans who are set to take_over Capitol_Hill in January have a foreign_policy agenda that clashes with Clinton ' s in almost every particular : less money for foreign_aid , more reluctance to use U.S. troops in peacekeeping operations and deep skepticism about the United Nations . And those policy differences are fueled by the imperatives of partisan politics . The Republicans , looking ahead to the 1996 presidential election , are determined to deny Clinton the high ground of foreign_policy leadership . &quot; He won ' t get any kind of free ride , &quot; warned Margaret Tutwiler , a political aide to then-Secretary of State James A . Baker III during the George_Bush Administration . &quot; Republicans are going_to be asking all kinds of hard questions about foreign_policy , just as Democrats used to when there was a Republican in the White House. &quot; In the aftermath of the Nov . 8 GOP landslide , some White_House aides said Clinton might spend more time on international affairs , where he would have more leeway to act independently of Congress than on domestic issues . But Dole , Helms and other Republicans have warned that they won ' t let Clinton get_away so easily . &quot; I think we ought to take_a_look at foreign_policy , &quot; Dole said in a television interview five days after the election . &quot; We ought to get the troops out of Haiti by Thanksgiving . . . . We ought to lift the arms embargo in Bosnia . We ought to investigate whether or not we got a good_deal in North Korea. &quot; Clinton acknowledges that conflict is inevitable between a President from one party and a Congress controlled by the other . But he told a news_conference during his post-election trip to Asia , &quot; I do think on the really pivotal matters we ' ll be able to achieve the kind of bipartisan . . . consensus to do what ' s right for the country. &quot; But since Nov . 8 , Republican foreign_policy aides say they have spent most of their time charting ways to press their bosses ' disagreements with Clinton : HAITI : Most Republicans opposed Clinton ' s decision to send U.S. troops to reinstall Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president of Haiti . Now that the GOP controls Congress , they plan to make the continued deployment as painful as possible . &quot; Our mission ' s complete , &quot; Dole said . &quot; We are going_to bring_back 6 # 000 troops . My view is we ought to hurry up and bring_back the other 9 # 000 troops . It doesn ' t serve any purpose if there ' s no problem there. &quot; Administration officials say that withdrawing all U.S. troops too early could lead to a collapse of civil_order in Haiti . Sen . Judd Gregg ( R-N.H. ) has asserted that the Haiti operation will cost as much as $ 3 billion over the first six months , far more_than the Administration ' s initial estimate of about $ 500 million . GOP aides have suggested holding a major debate over a supplemental appropriation for the larger amount to bring_home to voters how much the operation is costing . BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA : Dole and others have demanded that the United States break openly with its European allies and abandon the U.N. arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina . &quot; We ' re finally putting a little pressure on our allies in Bosnia , but my view is we ought to lift the arms embargo , give the Bosnians a chance to defend themselves , &quot; Dole said . Clinton , who initially favored lifting the arms embargo , has shied_away_from taking the step unilaterally because it would violate a U.N. Security_Council resolution and touch_off a crisis with the allies . The Administration has finessed the point through a series of awkward compromises , drawing_up plans for arms sales to Bosnia , formally conferring_with Congress and submitting doomed resolutions to the Security_Council . But Dole appears bent_on using the Republican majority to try to force Administration action . NORTH_KOREA : Last month , Republican leaders denounced Clinton ' s deal with North_Korea to halt the Communist regime ' s nuclear_weapons program in exchange for energy aid from the United States , Japan and South_Korea . Now they plan to make_sure no substantial U.S. money goes_to carry_out the pact . &quot; We are looking_at every angle we can to stop any funds and call them to account , &quot; an aide to Murkowski said . GOP aides concede that they probably cannot stop the Administration from paying about $ 5 million for short-term fuel shipments to North_Korea . But they say Murkowski and others will act to block any significant spending . As a result , the Administration is seeking agreement from Japan , South_Korea and other countries to pick_up those costs . THE MIDDLE_EAST : Helms alarmed both sides of the Arab-Israeli negotiations last week by saying he wasn ' t sure the talks , which have enjoyed wide bipartisan support , are such a good idea . &quot; Syria doesn ' t want peace with Israel , &quot; he said . &quot; What Syria wants is the Golan Heights -- plus , of course , access to the American taxpayers ' money . Congress needs to get_off the dime and demand a reassessment of the entire Middle_East peace process. &quot; Helms ' aides say the senator ' s main concern is that a peace agreement may include a large new commitment of U.S. aid for Syria -- and a large new commitment of American peacekeeping troops to patrol the Syrian-Israeli frontier . Administration officials acknowledge that both of those may be part of a settlement -- and that both could be difficult to get_through Congress . One official said of the proposed U.S. peacekeeping force on the Golan : &quot; It will be substantial and it will be controversial . We will be making a mistake if we think this one will be easy. &quot; THE UNITED NATIONS : Helms has called the United Nations the &quot; nemesis of millions of Americans . . . costing the taxpayer billions of dollars. &quot; Most other GOP leaders are not this hostile , but they resist spending more on U.N. peacekeeping operations . The United States has already paid $ 1.2 billion to the United Nations for peacekeeping this year but owes $ 400 million more to cover its pledge to pay_for 30 % of total costs . FOREIGN_AID : U.S. military and economic aid budgeted_for this year totals $ 12.3 billion ; that ' s down 20 % from the previous year and is about 0.1 % of the U.S. economy , a smaller share than any other rich country spends . Still , many Republicans like the idea of cutting foreign_aid because most taxpayers don ' t see much benefit from it . Sen . Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) , the probable chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees foreign_aid , says he wants to subject the entire foreign_aid system to a searching new review . Among the areas McConnell wants to cut is one close to Clinton ' s heart : the roughly $ 60 million being spent in Northern_Ireland in hopes that economic development will bring_about peace . &quot; A slush_fund for a country that ' s part of the European Union , &quot; an aide said dismissively . The Administration ' s response has been diplomatic . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher made a conciliatory telephone_call to Helms , saying he would try to be cooperative . Deputy Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott made_a_point of praising McConnell for his work_on aid to the former Soviet_Union -- even though McConnell has been strongly critical of Talbott . J . Brian Atwood , administrator of the Agency for International Development , says he has already cut the foreign_aid budget 20 % from its level during the Bush_Administration , and 70 % of what is left pays U.S. companies to provide goods and services overseas . AID officials are combing their contracts to determine how many workers in Helms ' North Carolina owe their jobs to U.S. foreign_aid . &quot; There will be a small percentage of Congress who will believe we should have no foreign_aid program at all , &quot; Atwood said . He said he hoped to convince the rest that the program is necessary for &quot; our own well-being. &quot; And he noted that foreign_aid ' s Republican supporters include the probable new chairmen of both the Senate and House appropriations committees , Sen . Mark O . Hatfield of Oregon and Rep . Bob Livingston of Louisiana . Even Helms had to pull_in his horns last week . After newspapers in Israel reported that the senator was thinking_about cutting U.S. aid , he telephoned the Israeli ambassador to the United States , Itamar Rabinovich , to assure him that he would not touch the $ 3 billion Israel receives annually in military and economic assistance .</TEXT>
