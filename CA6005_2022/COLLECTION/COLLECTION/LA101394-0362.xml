   <HEADLINE> NOBEL PRIZE AWARDED TO USC CHEMIST ; SCIENCE : GEORGE OLAH IS RECOGNIZED FOR WORK WITH HYDROCARBONS . AN AMERICAN AND A CANADIAN SHARE PHYSICS AWARD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A University of Southern California chemist whose mastery of the most powerful acids known helped pave the way for less polluting gasoline , more effective oil refining and many modern drugs won the Nobel Prize for chemistry , the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced Wednesday . George A . Olah , who fled first to Canada , then to the United States after a 1956 Soviet military crackdown in his homeland of Hungary , has almost single-handedly established USC as a notable center of advanced industrial chemistry , scientists and university officials said . The Swedish Academy on Wednesday also awarded the Nobel Prize in physics to Clifford Shull , 79 , a physicist who has retired from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and Canadian Bertram Brockhouse , 76 , of McMaster University in Ontario . Working independently , they made pioneering contributions to the studies of condensed matter . Olah , 67 , a genial grandfather whose receding crown of steel_gray hair frames a craggy profile and an avuncular smile , said Wednesday that he is giving the $ 945 # 000 prize_money to his wife , Judith Olah , a chemist who worked with him in the laboratory until her retirement four years ago . She handles the family finances , he said . Asked about their professional collaboration , she said , &quot; He was a marvelous boss . I mean we are still married after working ( together ) since 1955 . That should tell you everything. &quot; As he raised a crystal flute of champagne to toast the award , Olah clearly was savoring more_than the heady bubbles of the wine . He grinned at USC President Stephen Sample and said , &quot; We will put USC on the map for something different than football. &quot; The award cited his discovery of how to make concentrated solutions of unusual hydrocarbons in what he calls magic acids , creating an entire new field of chemistry of considerable theoretical , and practical , importance . The potent acids -- billions of times stronger than conventional acids -- are able to activate organic chemical_compounds , called carbocations , in reactions that were previously thought to be impossible . &quot; Hydrocarbons are the raw_materials of many things we use in daily life , of oil and natural_gas , and we take them for granted , &quot; Olah said . &quot; Look_around , practically everything is touched by hydrocarbons . They are used for making gasoline , pharmaceuticals and plastic , so it is very important to understand the process by which hydrocarbons are transformed. &quot; Olah holds more_than 100 patents , including some for work that led to lead-free gasoline and several drugs . He has authored more_than 900 research papers and has helped shape the development of organic_chemistry in the second_half of the 20th Century , colleagues said . &quot; The direction of this field did change completely through the original and imaginative work by this year ' s Nobel Prize laureate , &quot; the academy said . In his office Wednesday , Olah sat surrounded by chemical texts stacked 12 deep and basked in congratulatory telephone_calls from around the world , including Hungary , while his colleagues beamed and tossed confetti . &quot; It is just wonderful , &quot; Olah said . He singled_out for praise his longtime collaborator , Surya Prakash , at USC ' s Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute , which Olah directs . Olah grew_up in Budapest between World_Wars I and II . He never gave a thought to becoming a scientist , he said , until after graduating from high_school . &quot; I was interested in history and many other things . Thank God I never pursued them . Who is interested in medieval Hungarian history ? &quot; he said . He joined the USC faculty in 1977 after a decade at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , where his work earned him membership in the National Academy of Sciences . Of the research that led to his Nobel Prize , he said there was never a flash of dazzling insight , no eureka moment . Instead , his discoveries were the result of unusually long hours of laboratory routine that typically began just after dawn and continued until 10 at night . &quot; Scientist are like kids who try to search for the new and unexpected . But you don ' t come_into your lab at 9 in the morning and say today I am going_to make a great fundamental discovery. &quot; Olah ' s work is distinguished by its immense practical_applications . He spoke forcefully in support of the kind of goal-oriented research that , among many funding agencies , is rapidly overtaking the more traditional pursuit of basic knowledge for its own sake . &quot; There is nothing wrong , all things being equal , in doing something that may be of some use . Some people think you are tainted if you do something that is even remotely practical . I think it is a challenge to do something that also has some practical use , &quot; he said . While Olah is still actively pursuing his research , the two men who share the physics prize retired years ago . Brockhouse and Shull made their discoveries at the dawn of the nuclear age almost 40 years ago . Working with relatively primitive nuclear_reactors , they helped develop powerful methods of analyzing matter when X-rays and microscopes cannot see enough detail , called neutron scattering techniques . &quot; In simple terms , Clifford G . Shull has helped answer the question of where atoms ' are ' and Bertram N . Brockhouse the question of what atoms ' do , ' &quot; academy officials said in announcing the award . Brockhouse , 76 , now lives_in Hamilton , Ontario , an industrial center and university town of 315 # 000 people about 45 miles west of Toronto . At a news_conference at McMaster University in Hamilton , where he taught from 1962 until his retirement in 1984 , he appeared less excited than his former colleagues in the physics department , who beamed and applauded their mentor . Dressed in a tweedy gray jacket over a taupe pullover , Brockhouse described himself as &quot; an intellectual explorer &quot; and likened his pioneering work with the atom to that of a geological map_maker who lays_down the basic chart that other scientists use to mine practical , everyday applications . &quot; What we work_on with basic science is just a bigger atlas with places and objects and so on that are not as familiar in ordinary life as is the earth and the air and sea and the rocks , &quot; he said . &quot; . . . What my work did . . . is just add some more information , some more insight into what this world , this physical world , is. &quot; Brockhouse , a native of Lethbridge , Alberta , began dissecting the inner workings of the atom at Canada ' s Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories near Ottawa . The work cited for the Nobel continued through the 1950s and into the early 1960s after he joined the McMaster faculty , he said . Brockhouse explored the movement or dynamics of atoms in solid and electric matter through a process called thermal neutron scattering . He developed the triple axis crystal spectrometer and other neutron scattering instruments and techniques that are the basis for methods still used today . He said he was driven by the challenge of the unknown . &quot; For a very long_time before I actually became a scientist , it was science that I wanted to do , &quot; he said . &quot; Of course , it ' s characteristic of research , real research , that you don ' t know what you ' re going to do . All you know is where you stand at the moment and some vague intuitions of where you might go from there. &quot; His reaction to the prize , he said , was &quot; enormous astonishment , of course. &quot; He said he has &quot; no idea &quot; what he will do with the money that accompanies the prize , but suggested that he might use the stature that adheres to a Nobelist to promote the cause of energy conservation and other environmental issues about which he feels strongly . By studying simple compounds such_as table_salt , Shull and his colleagues discovered that neutrons are deflected in a distinctive pattern when they strike a sample of material . That allows researchers to determine the sample ' s atomic structure . Shull performed his original experiments almost 50 years ago at the federal laboratory at Oak Ridge , Tenn. , then continued his work_at MIT .
