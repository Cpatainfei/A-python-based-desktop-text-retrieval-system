   <HEADLINE> MASSACRE PROBE PUTS ISRAEL ARMY ON DEFENSIVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nearly a_million Israelis were glued to their radios and television_sets last week for an extraordinary broadcast : For the first time in history , an Arab judge aggressively interrogated the highest-ranking military_officer in the land -- live and in_color . The subject of inquiry : just how much blame Israel ' s security_forces must bear for a Jewish settler ' s massacre of about 30 Palestinian worshipers in a mosque in Hebron ' s sacred Cave of the Patriarchs on Feb . 25 . And Israel ' s military chief_of_staff was_on the defensive . The sometimes harsh questioning of Gen . Ehud Barak by the Israeli Arab justice , Judge Abdel Rahman Zouabi -- a scene unthinkable to many Israelis -- was the latest act in a running drama that has riveted the Israeli public and forced many to re-examine their view of the powerful armed forces . In the two weeks since the five-member Israeli Commission of Inquiry began hearing sworn testimony about a massacre that shook the nation , the official judicial body has produced an almost daily diet of startling disclosures . These revelations have reinforced the commission ' s credibility , even for some Palestinians -- who nevertheless have initiated two separate inquiries of_their_own . And the facts have put Israel ' s once-sacred armed forces on the defensive for the first time in more_than a decade . Among the disclosures from 70 witnesses who have testified before the official Israeli commission , which will continue its work for at least two more months : * Israeli security at the cave was inadequate at the time of the massacre . Three of the six guards who should have been inside when Brooklyn-born physician Dr. Baruch Goldstein opened_fire at about 5:30 a.m. were sleeping . Two others were away from their post . The only guard who was present said it was routine for guards to show_up late . In addition , security cameras that should have warned other guards that the massacre was under way were either broken or focused elsewhere . If the full guard contingent had been present and the equipment working , Barak and other senior commanders concluded , the massacre could have been prevented or stopped before so many died . * The Israeli soldiers who were_on sentry_duty outside the cave that day said in testimony confirmed by their commander that they would not have opened_fire on Goldstein in any event . They were under orders , they said , never to shoot at Jewish settlers , even if the settlers were killing people . Barak and other senior commanders called it a &quot; misunderstanding , &quot; but commission members have concluded that , at the very least , it indicated a breakdown in the chain of command . * Israeli intelligence and military commanders in the occupied territories never imagined or planned for a Jew firing in anything but self-defense . The settlers were allowed to enter places_of_worship fully armed because Palestinian attacks on them in the occupied territories had escalated in recent years . And despite increasing acts of violence by the settlers against Palestinians -- a trend so clear that even Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned his commanders last October that it was a potentially explosive security hazard -- those commanders never drew_up contingency plans to defend against such a massacre . * There may well have been a second gunman who joined Goldstein in the slaughter . Two of the Israeli sentries said they saw a second Jewish settler enter the cave before the shooting began . He was armed with a Glilon assault_rifle , the weapon used in the massacre . Goldstein , they said , was carrying an M-16 when he walked past them at the cave ' s entrance . And three Palestinian survivors testified they heard shooting from more_than one direction . Taken as_a_whole , the testimony directly contradicted the Israeli government ' s conclusion that the massacre was the act of a single settler gone mad . For the Palestinians , and even some Israelis , a host of questions remain : Did Goldstein , in fact , act alone ? Was there a conspiracy that included elements of the security_forces ? Will the commission ever find_out ? For some regular observers , the questions were echoes from another crime in another country in another time . They have likened the Israeli inquiry to that of the Warren Commission , which never quite satisfied the public demand for historical truth after President John F . Kennedy ' s assassination . The Israeli commission has even come_to be known by the surname of the chief Supreme Court justice who heads it , Meir Shamgar , and skeptics point to several apparently critical lapses that have hampered the Shamgar Commission in its work . The cave where the worshipers were gunned_down was hosed clean of clues before the commission members paid their official daylong visit to the site , which remains off limits to the public , to the Palestinian inquiry commissions and to the press . And the commission must rely entirely on the military ' s forensic and ballistic data as well as its description of the crime scene . At least five key Palestinian witnesses -- members of the religious board that oversees the shrine -- have refused the Israeli commission ' s invitations to testify . Instead , the religious_leaders have testified only before a commission of_their_own creation -- a rival Palestinian inquiry board based in Hebron . The alternative commission underscores the skepticism most Palestinians share about the Shamgar Commission . And the existence of a rival Palestinian investigation underscores the splits in their community . For most in the occupied territories , the slaughter of the unarmed worshipers confirmed their worst suspicions about Israeli justice . &quot; The accused cannot be the judge , &quot; said Abdul Aziz Dweik , chief administrator of the 11-member Palestinian commission appointed by the shrine ' s religious leadership . Dweik , who recently returned to his home_in the occupied territories after Israeli authorities deported him for a year to a southern Lebanon no-man ' s-land as a suspected fundamentalist extremist , said his group ' s inquest has persuaded him that there were at least two gunmen in the cave that day . And he said he suspects that the massacre was the result of a conspiracy involving the Israeli army . He conceded , however , that his panel ' s work has been severely hampered by its lack of access to the crime scene and to the key Israeli military_officers who have testified before the Shamgar Commission . Hashem Salman Qawasme heartily agreed . He is chairman of the other Palestinian inquiry commission , a body handpicked by Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat within days of the massacre , apparently as an alternative to Dweik ' s commission , whose members are opposed to Arafat ' s peace efforts with Israel . And Qawasme also admitted that key details will be missing from both Palestinian inquiries because of lack of access . Sitting in his commission office -- two rooms on the second floor of an otherwise empty building in Hebron , with one computer , two desks , one secretary and 10 chairs -- Qawasme also conceded that he has far fewer resources than the Shamgar Commission . That panel has a_battery of investigators and administrators and a modern hearing room inside Israel ' s Supreme Court . But from the more_than 50 witnesses his commission has interviewed , Qawasme , a veteran judge in the occupied territories , said it has concluded that there was more_than one gunman in the cave . He stressed , however , that his most dramatic finding was what he called &quot; a second massacre , &quot; in which the Israeli army allegedly killed five Palestinians -- most of them waiting to donate blood -- during rioting outside a Hebron hospital where many of the wounded had been taken from the cave . Assessing the work of the Shamgar Commission , Qawasme said , &quot; The ( Palestinian ) people don ' t trust anything being done_by the Israeli authorities anymore. &quot; Asked why he thought the Israeli government appointed the commission , he said , &quot; I think that what this committee is for is to take_away the madness of the general public after this horrible act. &quot; Qawasme had rare words of praise for the work of his Israeli rivals . He applauded the objectivity of the five commission members ; besides Zouabi and Shamgar , they include a university president widely known for his liberal views , another Supreme Court justice and a retired general . And , citing the series of disclosures the Shamgar Commission has produced on live national television , he said : &quot; They have some positive points . Some facts that have been unknown have been aired by them. &quot; The most provocative of those facts for most Israelis has been the &quot; open-fire &quot; order that middle- and low-ranking officers said barred them from shooting a Jew who was shooting Arabs . Here ' s how it sounded to an audience that the Israeli Broadcasting Authority estimates at nearly 1 million at any given time during Zouabi ' s interrogation of Deputy Cmdr . Meir Tayar , head of Hebron ' s border police : &quot; Even if I had been there , &quot; Tayar said , &quot; I could not have done anything , because there were special instructions . The open-fire instructions in the event a settler or a Jewish resident of Hebron shoots with intent : Under no circumstances shoot at him . . . . We are to overcome him by other means . For example , to take cover and wait for the ( ammunition ) magazine to be used up. &quot; Zouabi was incredulous : &quot; You mean , to wait until he killed other people ? &quot; And Tayar confirmed that , indeed , that was the order . It was in response to a flurry of public reaction to such a policy that Barak last week flatly denied , before the commission and the nation , that he or any other senior officer ever gave such an order . Rather , he said , it appeared that somewhere down the chain of command his orders were &quot; misunderstood. &quot; The testimony , however , gave_rise to additional , widespread criticism of the security_forces . &quot; Three security organizations are supposed to cooperate in fulfilling a clear mission : guarding the Cave ( of the Patriarchs ) , &quot; concluded a recent commentary in the Hebrew daily Davar , which often reflects the views of Rabin ' s ruling Labor_Party . &quot; From the testimony heard so far by the Shamgar Commission , a chilling picture is being painted of a lack of coordination and , occasionally , conflicting interests . It is a pity that we needed such a tragic and brutal event to reveal this. &quot; The commission ' s disclosures have spawned growing concern in Israel ' s political right_wing about the image of a military Establishment unaccustomed to scrutiny in its task of protecting a small nation surrounded by enemies and enforcing 27 years of occupation in hostile lands . More liberal Israeli analysts , such_as Uri Avnery , brushed_aside such observations . Avnery , a peace activist and frequent commentator , has attended every commission session since it opened March 8 . For him , the Shamgar Commission already has done irreversible good for the army and the nation . &quot; I see it as a very healthy process for Israel , &quot; he said . &quot; The army has been a ( sacred ) cow for a generation . What is happening with this commission is it ' s forcing us to rethink our attitude toward the army . For the first time , we ' re getting a normal attitude toward the army , seeing that it is filled with normal people , both good and bad. &quot;</TEXT>
