   <HEADLINE> THE NATION ; AFTER A FURIOUS BATTLE FOR CONTROL , CENTRISTS WIN OUT ON HIGH_COURT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Rehnquist court has been taking fewer and fewer cases each year . Is the U.S. Supreme Court retreating from the political landscape ? Not likely . Is this the court ' s way of halting what it perceives as past &quot; judicial_activism &quot; ? Probably , not . A far more likely explanation is that the court ' s centrists are in control and have no truck with the arch-conservatives ' agenda of overturning liberal precedents . At the same time , Chief_Justice William H . Rehnquist and his far-right colleagues , Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , appear content to avoid possible future rulings that go_against what they stand_for . They are engaged in damage_control against the growing core of more moderate centrists who oppose overruling liberal precedents and settled law . Last term , the court handed_down written opinions in just 93 cases out of more_than 7 # 700 cases on its docket . That is the lowest number since the 1955 term , when the Warren court decided 94 cases by written opinion out of a far smaller docket of 1 # 856 . By contrast , in the 1970s and ' 80s , the Burger court ( 1969-86 ) regularly disposed_of more_than 150 cases by written opinions each year . Most justices complained they were deciding too many cases . The court has certainly solved its workload problem -- if it had one . With Rehnquist at the helm , conferences are more tightly run and the justices have become more selective in granting review . In addition , Congress , in 1988 , gave the Supreme Court virtually complete discretion to decide what to decide . The court no longer has to review certain appeals . The court , as Justice Sandra Day O ' Connor often stresses , decides only &quot; hard cases &quot; -- those raising the most divisive conflicts of the day . The justices also generally grant review of cases in which a majority wants to reverse a ruling of a lower federal_court or state court . Some court watchers speculate that , after 12 years of appointees to the federal judiciary by Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George_Bush , the Rehnquist court is content to leave many conservative appellate-court decisions alone . But there is more to the court ' s taking fewer cases than that . A kind of epic struggle took_place within the court and its far-right wing lost out . The most notable battle was over abortion . In Webster vs . Reproductive Health Services ( 1989 ) , the court split five-to-four . A bare majority refused to overrule the 1973 ruling in Roe vs . Wade on a woman ' s right to have an abortion . Three years later , in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania vs . Casey , the court ' s centrists , Justices Anthony M . Kennedy , David H . Souter and O ' Connor , again prevailed . They , with Justices Harry A . Blackmun and John Paul Stevens , reaffirmed &quot; the essence &quot; of Roe . Rehnquist and Scalia , joined by Thomas and Byron R . White , again bitterly lamented the failure to overturn Roe . The right_wing of the Rehnquist court has been fighting a rear-guard action ever since . In the first years of the Rehnquist court , to be sure , it lunged in more conservative directions . The justices also rushed to overrule liberal precedents . In its first four terms , no fewer than 11 precedents were abandoned . In the 1990 term alone , five more were discarded . Another seven were jettisoned next term , for a total of 23 . But that was the high-water_mark . None has been reversed in the last two terms . In other words , the conservative slide and hasty press to overrule liberal precedents has been abated , due_to the growing influence of centrists and to changes in the composition of the bench . Reagan ' s elevation of Rehnquist to chief_justice and the appointments of Scalia , in 1986 , and Kennedy , in 1987 , moved the court right . But Bush ' s two appointees were a mixed bag for conservatives . Thomas has proved to be a consistent ally of Rehnquist and Scalia . Souter , however , has come_into his own since his appointment in 1990 . He has demonstrated leadership and taken Rehnquist and Scalia to task for some of their views and insistence on overruling liberal precedents . Democratic President Bill_Clinton ' s appointment of two more centrists , Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg last year and Stephen G . Breyer this year , has further solidified the centrists ' control . Rehnquist and his two principal allies have lost the war over more_than just abortion . Their defense of states rights and attempts to limit congressional power have also been rejected by the court ' s majority . Their efforts to allow greater regulation of commercial speech and to permit greater governmental accommodation of religion in public_schools have also been rebuffed by the court ' s centrists . As chief_justice , Rehnquist has proved an efficient administrator , but his judicial philosophy and devotion to undoing past liberal decisions has been unpersuasive . Admittedly , he does not go_out of his way to try to make converts or to put heavy-handed pressure on the others . By contrast , Scalia overplays his hand . His temperament is too_much that of an academic . His acerbic wit and penchant for haranguing those who disagree have backfired . On more_than one occasion , it has cost him , and the far right , the votes of O ' Connor , Kennedy and Souter . With his keen sense_of_humor and considerable charm , Scalia had the potential of becoming the Justice William J . Brennan Jr . of the right . Brennan was a master at forging opinions that commanded majorities . Instead , Scalia has proved more like Justice Felix Frankfurter , a former Harvard Law_School professor . Frankfurter also browbeat his colleagues and ended_up alienating them . Still smarting after his bitter Senate confirmation fight , Thomas has not emerged as a player . He never asks questions in oral arguments , writes few opinions and sides so often with Scalia that the latter is said to have two votes . The right_wing of the Rehnquist court thus appears reconciled to denying review to cases it knows it cannot win a majority on . The court ' s moderate centrists , on the other hand , appear in no mood for more acrimonious battles over such controversial issues as abortion . That is why the court has refused to grant several abortion cases in the last several terms . With the high turnover in membership , the centrists are also undoubtedly biding their time , waiting for their numbers to grow . Another case_in_point was the court ' s denial , on Oct . 12 , of an important appellate-court ruling on the First_Amendment ' s separation of government from religion . The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that a 43-foot cross , and a San Diego landmark for more_than 40 years , could no longer stand on public_property because it violated the First_Amendment disestablishment clause . This is the kind of case that , a_few years ago , Rehnquist and Scalia would have jumped at . They would have done so with a view to reversing the lower court ' s decision and , perhaps , getting_rid_of liberal precedents upholding a &quot; high wall of separation &quot; between government and religion . But after taking several such cases in recent years and losing to the court ' s centrists , they preferred to minimize their losses . As with abortion , the court ' s centrists have reaffirmed liberal precedents on the First_Amendment ' s disestablishment clause . For them , the Ninth Circuit ' s ruling was correct and should be left alone . Assuredly , the Rehnquist court is not going_to vanish from public view . Many of the cases that were once granted , but now simply denied , involve statutory matters and conflicts in the lower courts . Congress may -- and does -- resolve such conflicts by passing new legislation . But this term , for example , the court has already agreed to decide some major controversial social issues . The justices will consider the constitutionality of state-imposed term limits on members of the U.S. House of Representatives , and the constitutionality of a federal gun-control law . The court has also granted a major challenge to affirmative-action programs , an important school-desegregation case and several others involving freedom_of_speech under the First_Amendment . The justices will decide as well whether states may provide lower welfare benefits to new residents . However the court rules_in these and other cases , charges of &quot; judicial_activism &quot; will undoubtedly be heard from some quarter . The Supreme Court , moreover , can run but it cannot hide from the major social conflicts in the land . A whole batch of voting-rights cases are in the wings . The issue of homosexual rights is certain to be before the court before long -- whether as an appeal of decisions on gays and lesbians in the military or of the Colorado state_supreme_court ' s recent ruling striking down a state constitutional amendment that forbid localities from passing ordinances protecting homosexuals . Sooner or later , the court will also have to clarify the status of abortion rights and what restrictions on women ' s access to abortion constitute an &quot; undue burden &quot; under its Casey ruling . Still , for the foreseeable future , the moderate centrists on the Rehnquist court are in control and likely to prevail . They have no liberal agenda for judicial_activism . But neither do they share the right_wing ' s conservative agenda for reaching_out to grant cases to overturn liberal precedents . The court ' s centrists will prevent Rehnquist and company from engaging in that brand of &quot; judicial_activism &quot; as well. *</TEXT>
