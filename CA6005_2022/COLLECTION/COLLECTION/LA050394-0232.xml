   <HEADLINE> THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS ; YOUR MEDICINE_CABINET SHOULD CONTAIN LOTS OF IMPORTANT THINGS -- BUT MEDICINE ISN ' T ONE OF THEM . BATHROOM HEAT AND HUMIDITY CAN TAKE THE PUNCH_OUT OF YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Face to face with the medicine_cabinet of a new date , Jerry snoops and is sorry . On the shelf sits a tube of fungicide , which Jerry pockets , obsessed with finding_out which body_part is plagued . After many plot twists and turns , it turns_out the medicine is meant for the woman ' s . . . cat ! -- &quot; Seinfeld &quot; * There are three lessons to be learned here . One : Snooping in medicine_cabinets is not nice . Two : Snooping in medicine_cabinets can lead to wrong conclusions . Three : Fungicide is one of the few things that belong in a medicine_cabinet . Today ' s pharmaceutical lesson will focus_on No . 3 and the fact that , despite the name , the medicine_cabinet is not the proper place for many medicines . Mostly , that ' s because of the barometric conditions in a bathroom -- a source of humidity and heat . The moisture from the shower and bath can break_down some medicines , experts say . Carol Taketomo , pharmacy manager at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles , cites as an example carbamazepine ( Tegretol ) , an anti-seizure medicine . Studies show humidity can sap much of its effectiveness . A bathroom ' s high_temperatures can also weaken potency and alter chemical stability , says pharmacist Chris Green of Zweber Pharmacy in Downey : &quot; Capsules might start to melt. &quot; Other heat-related no-no ' s : Don ' t leave pills in a hot car and keep medicines away from direct light . ( Some medicines could also become harmful if exposed to heat and moisture. ) Prescription and over-the-counter medicines , including aspirin and acetaminophen , are_best kept_in a cool , dry area , Green says . But don ' t overdo it and store medicine in the refrigerator unless the label so instructs . Once you ' ve opened medicine , throw_away the cotton plug ( which keeps the pills from rattling to powder during shipment ) ; it attracts moisture . Medicine_cabinet alternatives include a bedroom cabinet or drawer , or a kitchen cabinet -- if it ' s not next to the sink . ( Be careful to use childproof caps and locks to prevent poisonings if young children are around. ) Once your medicines are in their proper places , &quot; go_through everything twice a year and throw_out expired products , both prescription and over-the-counter , &quot; suggests pharmacist John Tilley , who finds that most people keep medicine long past its expiration date . So what should go_in your medicine_cabinet -- in case you ' re now despairing that it has no redeeming qualities ? You can keep your toothbrush , toothpaste and make-up there , along with shaving essentials and other grooming aids . Over-the-counter creams ( tightly capped ) and thermometers hold_up in medicine_cabinets , as do bandages -- and , of course , fungicides .</TEXT>
