   <HEADLINE> WILSON ACCUSED OF ' JOBS EXTORTION ' WITH DETROIT ; ELECTRIC_CARS : A TOP AIDE TO GOVERNOR CALLS THE ALLEGATIONS FROM MICHIGAN ' S REP . JOHN DINGELL AND SEN . CARL LEVIN ' FLATLY WRONG AND SPURIOUS. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two powerful Michigan lawmakers accused Gov . Pete Wilson on Tuesday of secretly offering to relax California ' s electric-car mandate in return for a pledge from the U.S. auto industry to move jobs to the state . Wilson ' s top environmental aide denied the charge as &quot; flatly wrong and spurious , &quot; but Rep . John Dingell and Sen . Carl Levin , both Democrats , asked the Clinton_Administration to intervene , upping the political ante in a bruising battle over California ' s 1998 deadline for the sale of electric_cars . Dingell and Levin -- closely aligned with the Big Three auto firms and the United Auto Workers union -- made their plea in a letter to Vice_President Al Gore . They argued that such &quot; jobs extortion &quot; is an abuse of California ' s authority under the federal Clean Air Act , which gives the state freedom to set its own clean-air standards apart from federal requirements . This authority was granted to Sacramento &quot; only for the purpose of addressing its unique smog problems , &quot; they said . &quot; It was never intended to give California a bargaining_chip to offer_up in exchange for automotive manufacturing jobs. &quot; The auto industry is fighting the 1998 California mandate , contending that a breakthrough in battery technology is needed if auto_makers are to build electric_cars that people will want and can afford . But regulators and electric-car advocates call that a familiar Detroit smoke_screen and declare confidently that the state ' s requirements are forcing the technology needed to meet the 1998 deadline . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency endorsed the rules Tuesday in a new clean-air plan for the Los Angeles basin . Wilson has continued to say publicly that he supports the standards and the deadline , set by the California Air Resources Board in 1990 . The mandate says 2 % of all new vehicles sold in the state in 1998 must emit zero emissions -- in_effect , a requirement to make available about 36 # 000 electric_cars . The minimum climbs to 10 % of new vehicles in 2003 . A required CARB review of its clean-air schedule will take_place this year , and that , along with the lead time required to bring new vehicles to market , has brought the_matter to a head . As recently as Monday , Wilson ' s top environmental aide , Cal-EPA Secretary James M . Strock , told a legislative hearing that the governor &quot; remains fully committed &quot; to the electric-car mandate &quot; as scheduled. &quot; Strock reiterated that position Tuesday in response to the allegations from Levin and Dingell . &quot; California in no way intends to compromise &quot; the standards , he said . A spokesman said that applied to the timetable , also . In their letter to Gore , Levin and Dingell attribute their information on Wilson ' s purported secret offer to two recent articles in the trade publication &quot; Inside EPA ' s California Report. &quot; One story in the publication quoted an unnamed Wilson aide as saying : &quot; We ' ve been putting forth the message if they ( Detroit ) want consideration of their agenda , there ' s got_to be a concomitant agreement ( to invest heavily in California ) . &quot; Wilson ' s compromise would relax the zero-emission rule_in return for jobs , the publication said . To those skeptical of Wilson ' s commitment , other facts lend the reports an air of credibility . The state ' s mania for new jobs is no secret , and Wilson last fall had lunch with Ford Vice_Chairman Alan Gilmour , who made the auto industry ' s case for delaying the standards . Ambitious plans to build an electric-car industry in the state have become a prominent item on California ' s economic-development agenda . * RELATED STORY : A1</TEXT>
