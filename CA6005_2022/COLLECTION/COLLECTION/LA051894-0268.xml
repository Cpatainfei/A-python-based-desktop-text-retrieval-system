   <HEADLINE> MEDICINE ; NO RESTRICTIONS ON DRUG DATA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the areas where personal information is accumulating most rapidly is medical_records . While the health_care industry insists patients ' identities and records are protected , prescription data is one way in which private medical information is sold and transferred to employers , insurers and drug_companies . On the leading edge is Physician Computer_Network Inc. , a New Jersey company that is trying to create a nationwide computer_network of doctors . PCN software links physicians to insurance_companies , clinical laboratories and hospitals . The system allows the doctors to save time and money processing medical claims , receiving test results and changing medications and orders for hospitalized patients . Doctors get the service by leasing PCN computers at a discount . In exchange , PCN gets the doctors ' patient records , which it compiles and then sells to pharmaceutical companies , insurers and others . After some adverse publicity about the risks , PCN moved to create an intermediate entity to verify that PCN was not obtaining and releasing patients ' names or identifying data . Federal law prohibits anyone from passing_on information from medical_records that is &quot; personally identifiable , &quot; such_as names and Social_Security_numbers , without getting a patient ' s permission . But enforcement can be difficult , privacy experts say . There is no such restriction on prescription_drug information -- at least for now . Details about roughly half the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled_in the United States each year are sold to outsiders , usually to pharmaceutical companies interested in which products are moving . PCS , a popular prescription discount card company , sells its database with patients ' names deleted . However , it passes along the patients ' sex , age and Social_Security_numbers and physicians ' federal identification_numbers . The buyer of the data , a company_named Walsh , then voluntarily replaces the Social_Security_numbers with patient identification_numbers . That , Walsh assures , protects patients ' identities .</TEXT>
