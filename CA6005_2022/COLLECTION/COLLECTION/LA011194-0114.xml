   <TEXT> US West identified four more sites Monday for its proposed multimedia network that would bring movies , home shopping , games and pay-per-view video into phone customers ' homes . The regional phone_company said it will add Denver ; Minneapolis-St . Paul ; Boise , Idaho , and Portland , Ore. , to the information superhighway already under construction in Omaha . US West said it plans to ask the Federal Communications Commission to approve its expanded plans and said about 15 more cities will be added_to the construction list by year ' s end . The company is committed to spend at least $ 750 million over the next two years toward construction of the system . By the end of next week , US West will file applications with the FCC covering 292 # 000 homes and businesses in Minneapolis-St . Paul and 132 # 000 homes and businesses in Portland , said Gary Ames , president and chief_executive of US West Communications . Depending_on how quickly the FCC acts_on its applications , the company hopes to begin construction in Denver , Minneapolis-St . Paul and Portland this year and complete construction in the neighborhoods included in the upcoming filings by the end of next year , Ames said . The company is still reviewing the timetable for construction in Boise , he said . Customers eventually will be able to link their phones and televisions to participate in meetings , shop_at their favorite stores and choose from hundreds of movies and TV_programs whenever they want . Video classrooms and phone_calls also will be possible . Work already is under way on the company ' s multimedia network in Omaha , where US West launched the project . In late December , the FCC approved US West ' s application to try_out video dial-tone service there . The first multimedia services , including home shopping , movies on demand , interactive games and enhanced pay-per-view video programs , will be available to as_many as 2 # 500 Omaha homes and businesses in a technical trial beginning during the second quarter of this year . The trial will be expanded to a market trial involving 60 # 000 homes and businesses by late summer or early fall . &quot; It took six months to obtain the FCC ' s approval for Omaha , &quot; Ames said . &quot; We can ' t afford to wait for completion of the Omaha trials to submit the next set of applications .</TEXT>
