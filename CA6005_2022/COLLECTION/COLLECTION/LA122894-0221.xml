   <HEADLINE> $ 1 BILLION IN GROSSES ? IT TAKES GUMPTION ; MOVIES : BEING FIRED FROM ' COCOON ' SENT HIS CAREER INTO A SPIN , BUT ROBERT ZEMECKIS DIDN ' T QUIT . HE REBOUNDED WITH ' ROMANCING THE STONE ' AND A STRING OF OTHER HITS , INCLUDING A TALE OF A MAN NAMED ' FORREST. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In modern times and in modern dollars , the most successful director of them all is , of course , Steven Spielberg . From &quot; Jaws &quot; to &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; his films have grossed well in excess of $ 4.5 billion at the box_office here and abroad , and in many cases are still doing business . Even &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; never expected to be a big moneymaker , did about $ 96 million in this country and $ 220 million abroad to date . In the rarefied category of billion-dollar directors , it is a matter of some curiosity as_to who places second . At the moment , it would appear to be 42-year-old Robert Zemeckis , whose &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; is about to pass $ 300 million at the domestic box_office alone . His films , including &quot; Romancing the Stone , &quot; all three installments of &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; &quot; Who Framed Roger Rabbit &quot; and &quot; Death Becomes Her , &quot; have done upward of $ 1.5 billion thus far , and &quot; Gump &quot; has miles to go before it sleeps . Running a close race with Zemeckis is Ivan Reitman of &quot; Ghostbusters &quot; fame . Daily Variety has estimated the business that his films have done at $ 1.3 billion ( it has not yet compiled an estimate on Zemeckis ) . But Reitman ' s &quot; Junior &quot; looks_to be off to a soft start while &quot; Gump , &quot; likely to have a new thrust from Academy Award nominations and other honors , is already a major hit . Ironically , Zemeckis , from his new home_in Montecito , recently said his career looked_to be over before it had really begun . &quot; I ' d made two films before I shot ' Romancing the Stone. ' I made ' I Wanna Hold Your Hand ' and ' Used Cars , ' and they were both box-office flops . I ' d spent a year developing ' Cocoon. ' Then I got fired because of ' Romancing the Stone. ' When I showed Fox the finished ' Stone , ' they thought it was a disaster . Not the Zanucks , but the studio . They were all very nervous in those days , and ' Cocoon ' was budgeted at $ 15 million . They said , ' We can ' t give this guy another movie to make ! ' So they fired me. &quot; &quot; Romancing the Stone &quot; turned_out to be a very large success . Had it not been , Zemeckis says , its failure , plus the fact that he had already been fired from &quot; Cocoon , &quot; would have meant his career was indeed over . &quot; It ' s this tradition in the industry that some filmmakers are lucky , and some are unlucky . It ' s what they told Michael Douglas when he wanted me to direct ' Stone ' : ' But his films don ' t make money. ' To his everlasting credit , Michael said , ' Yeah , but look_at the style of &quot; Used Cars. &quot; that ' s what I want. ' It ' s the idea that the director can control the box_office , which nobody can. &quot; As it was , Zemeckis went from &quot; Romancing the Stone &quot; to his string of successes . By another irony , Zemeckis may have been sought for &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; because of his skill at merging live action and animation in &quot; Who Framed Roger Rabbit. &quot; At one stage of the script , &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; was to include a lot of animation . It was later thrown_out , though several scenes of special_effects , which blend historical footage with newly shot film , remain . &quot; I enjoy using special_effects , &quot; he says . &quot; Part of the spectacle of film is illusion , and illusion is more and more part of the spectacle . But you can ' t let it get_in the way of the story . When you think_about it , the close-up is about as strong an image as you can have. &quot; The extraordinary sequences in which Tom Hanks as Gump is seen in newsreels with JFK and other historic figures have aroused wide comment , suggesting that seeing is no longer being able to believe . The implications fascinate Zemeckis , too . &quot; If a political candidate had enough money and wanted to put himself in newsreels with heads_of_state he ' s never met , he could do_it , &quot; Zemeckis said . &quot; It would be dangerous because he could be exposed , but it can be done. &quot; The larger question , being explored by the Artists Rights Foundation , which Zemeckis supports , is that of who owns and controls a movie ' s images . &quot; Say in 20 years a guy who wants to sell canned ham asks to use a piece of Tom ' s performance in ' Gump ' in a commercial . Does Tom have a say in that ? The director , the writer , the staff , the people who had a hand in the look , the haircut , the wardrobe , the performance ? Do I have a say ? &quot; Zemeckis thinks it conceivable that stage acting that led to film acting may evolve again into what he calls digital acting . In the same way a soprano can dub a better high C onto her recording of an aria , an actor could stockpile some of his better line deliveries into a kind of computer-banking system . &quot; An actor will be able to say , ' Gee , I wish I hadn ' t done that little thing with my mouth ; I ' d like to be able to do what I did_in my last movie , ' and I think you ' ll be able to go_back to his computer bank and change it. &quot; * &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; was delayed in the making , not only because of script problems but also because of its presumed similarity to &quot; Rain Man. &quot; It never stopped seeming risky . &quot; You have to give Sherry Lansing credit , because for what we were going_to have to spend on ' Gump , ' it made no sense , &quot; Zemeckis said . &quot; How would you promote it ? There were no exploitative elements you could put_in a flashy trailer . There was no tie-in to McDonald ' s . We had Tom Hanks -- but that was everything. &quot; The movie has been variously interpreted as a metaphor for America at mid-century , or an America in need of lobotomizing . But Zemeckis says , &quot; My reaction when I first read the script was very emotional and had nothing to do with all_the intellectual stuff , although it was obviously there . It was risky , because Gump could become grotesque , or you could slip over into the saccharine and the maudlin . &quot; I was never really certain until we began to screen the film whether the portrayal of Gump , and his strange accent , was going_to work for audiences . To Tom ' s enormous credit , he pulled it off. &quot; Zemeckis met Bob Gale , his frequent script collaborator , at USC film school ; they wrote the ill-fated &quot; 1941 &quot; for Spielberg . Now , off his successes , Zemeckis has clout , and he finds it a boon but also a challenge . &quot; It allows you to take_time_off , and that ' s important , because you live_in such a rarefied atmosphere when you ' re directing a movie . You ' re not in the real_world . All you have to do is direct , and everybody around you all day is telling you how great you are . My wife kids me about that all_the time , &quot; Zemeckis says . The burden of clout is to choose the right projects . &quot; I ' ve read some good scripts since ' Gump ' came_out , but I ' m still frazzled . If you find a script with a flaw in it , you think , ' The last thing I ' m ready to do is roll_up my sleeves and get_in a room with a writer and start shaking this screenplay out. ' You need a break. &quot;</TEXT>
