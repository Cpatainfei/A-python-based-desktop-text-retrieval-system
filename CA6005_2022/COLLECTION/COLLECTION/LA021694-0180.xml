   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN JOINS MAJOR IN PROMISE TO PRESS FOR PEACE IN BOSNIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Boris N . Yeltsin warned the West on Tuesday not to bypass Russia in authorizing air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs . But he joined British Prime_Minister John Major in promising to intensify peacemaking efforts in the former Yugoslav republic . In return , the visiting British leader voiced support for broader cooperation between Russia and the Group of Seven industrialized nations , &quot; turning the G-7 into a G-8. &quot; Major is the first Western leader to come_to Moscow since NATO threatened last week to bomb Bosnian Serb artillery positions unless they are withdrawn from around Sarajevo , the Bosnian capital . Russian leaders strongly oppose military_action against the Serbs , their ethnic and religious kin . Arriving here Monday on a three-day visit , Major sounded intent_on smoothing over the sharp differences between Russia and the West on this issue . After his meeting with Yeltsin in the Kremlin , he appeared to have partly succeeded . &quot; In general we agree on what ' s most important , &quot; an ailing Yeltsin told reporters afterward . &quot; The main thing is to transfer the heavy_weapons around Sarajevo to the U.N. forces , and this will put an end to the shelling . And secondly , through negotiations , to make both sides , the Serbs and Muslims , come_to the negotiating table. &quot; But he added a jarring note . &quot; Some quarters are trying to resolve the Bosnia issue without Russia ' s participation , &quot; he said . &quot; I would like to stress that they will not succeed . We won ' t allow this. &quot; The warning underlined Moscow ' s insistence that a final_decision on air strikes be left to the United Nations , where Russia has veto power in the Security_Council . Yeltsin made_it clear that Russia would support air_raids only if U.N. peacekeepers were attacked . Without mentioning the controversy over U.N. authority , Major insisted that Russia and the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization have the same objective . &quot; We wish to bring an end to the bombardment of Sarajevo , &quot; he said . Major said his country , which has become Russia ' s third-largest trading partner , would favor Russian membership in the Council of Europe as well as the G-7 and press for opening all Western markets to more Russian exports . The two leaders agreed that , starting May 30 , they will no longer target each other ' s territory with nuclear missiles -- an accord identical to one signed last month in Moscow by Yeltsin and President Clinton . Tuesday was Yeltsin ' s first public appearance in more_than a week . His office announced last week that he was bedridden by a cold .</TEXT>
