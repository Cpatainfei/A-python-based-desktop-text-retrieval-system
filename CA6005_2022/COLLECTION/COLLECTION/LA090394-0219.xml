   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : IRVINE ; RESEARCHERS ' WORK PEGGED TO TELETHON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This Labor_Day weekend , UC Irvine researcher Luis Villarreal will be keeping a close eye on the tote board at the annual muscular_dystrophy telethon . His three-year , $ 342 # 000 research grant is contingent_on the telethon ' s success . &quot; I get the feeling that people are kind of tired_of hearing about this telethon , &quot; said Villarreal , one of a handful of researchers worldwide working on a genetic cure for the disease that affects more_than 1 million young Americans . &quot; The reality is that we are going_to make some real progress in the attempts to deal with this disease soon . They shouldn ' t give_up on us. &quot; Villarreal , 45 , a professor of molecular_biology and biochemistry , is one of three UCI researchers whose work is funded by the Muscular Dystrophy Assn . Biological chemistry professor John Wasmuth and assistant researcher John McPherson are trying to locate the genes for two different types of the disease . Villarreal is developing a procedure to replace the defective gene that causes the most common form of the disease , Duchenne muscular_dystrophy . The disease is typically diagnosed in children by age 5 and often proves fatal by the early 20s , due_to respiratory failure . &quot; This is the most severe and cruelest form of the disease , &quot; said Dr. Leon Charash , a New York child neurologist and chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. ' s Medical Advisory Committee . Eight years ago , Muscular Dystrophy Assn . researchers discovered that a defective dystrophin gene was responsible_for Duchenne muscular_dystrophy . Villarreal ' s quest is to send a genetically engineered , fully functioning dystrophin gene into a patient ' s body where it would correct the deficiencies of the defective gene . Villarreal is trying to devise a way to package a healthy dystrophin gene inside a common_cold virus , called an adenovirus . The virus is considered the delivery system necessary for transmission of the dystrophin gene to the body ' s muscle_cells . The challenge for researchers over the years has been to fit the large dystrophin gene into the cold virus , which has so far proved too small for task . &quot; If the scientists at UCI can make this virus bigger , it will not only clearly benefit people with muscular_dystrophy , but it also may benefit people with a whole host of other genetic illnesses , &quot; Charash said . Villarreal has designed a theoretical model for stripping away some of the contents of the cold virus in_order to make room for the dystrophin gene . If his research proves successful , clinical tests on patients could begin within several years . &quot; The implications of all this are quite profound , &quot; Villarreal said . &quot; If we can design a delivery vehicle , that vehicle would be applicable to most major diseases that we know of. &quot; French researchers are trying the &quot; shoe-horn &quot; approach , according to Villarreal , attempting to fit a reduced version of the dystrophin gene into the cold virus . Muscular Dystrophy Assn . officials say such an attempt may at least arrest the development of the disease . But Villarreal is confident that the entire dystrophin gene can be sent into the body , which would theoretically amount to a cure for the disease . &quot; It ' s not something that we ' ve been able to solve yet , &quot; Villarreal said . &quot; We are having to invent a whole new technology to cure this disease. &quot; RUSS LOAR</TEXT>
