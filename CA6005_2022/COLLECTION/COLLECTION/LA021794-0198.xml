   <HEADLINE> LAVA AND THE HOT ROCKS READY TO ERUPT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Gonzalezes were tired_of waiting for fame and fortune to arrive for their family band . So tired that they decided to create their own fame using their own fortune . After refinancing their Maywood home and taking the money that Hector Gonzalez received from a company buyout , the family independently produced Lava and the Hot Rocks ' first commercial album last fall . Their gamble may have paid_off . Frustrated with being denied by several record labels , Hector , 40 , his wife , Miroslava ( Lava ) , 38 , and their son , Alex , 18 , changed the band ' s eclectic style to alternative adult contemporary . And with their first , soon-to-be-released album , &quot; You Damn Mexicans Are Too Loud , &quot; the band has found its niche . &quot; It ' s been hard to get_into the Mexican market because they don ' t consider us Latin . Even being of Mexican American heritage , we weren ' t recognized because we aren ' t immigrants , &quot; Hector Gonzalez said . The band began its tumultuous journey through the Los Angeles music scene 13 years ago after Hector Gonzalez ' s barber introduced him to an attorney who recommended their demo album to former concert promoter Jerry Rissmiller . &quot; Musically they knocked me out , &quot; said Rissmiller , who agreed to become their manager . He said their blend of Latin elements and big-band sound leads to a bluesy jazz beat that is commercial and unique in a world where it is &quot; very difficult to get air play_on any radio_station , regardless of ethnicity. &quot; With Hector on bass , Alex on drums and Lava on vocals , the group also features Mel Steinberg , 44 , on saxophone , Alfred Ortiz , 23 , on percussion and Karl Carrasco , 41 , on keyboards . The family writes songs by improvisation . Hector Gonzalez said he comes_up with a rhythm and runs it by his son , who adds his ideas . Then they tape the piece and give it to Lava Gonzalez to write the melody and the lyrics . Hector Gonzales describes themes for the band ' s songs as &quot; home-grown. &quot; Lava Gonzalez said the bluesy songs she sings offer a unique way to discuss life : tales of love , war , pain and relationships . Many of their songs are inspired by her heritage -- she was born in Chinipas , Mexico , and moved to the United States when she was 1 -- and by the family ' s attempts to make_it to the big_time . Hector Gonzalez , who won an Emmy Award as a sound engineer for his work_on the 1984 Olympic Games coverage , said his connections at ABC and CBS allowed the band to make money while it looked_for its niche . Those contacts and some late-night club gigs gave the band exposure during an Academy Awards wrap party and other industry get-togethers . The band has a busy summer schedule , starting in June with the Troubadours of Folk festival at UCLA . As part of the festival , the band will travel with 35 other acts to Scandinavia and the_Virgin Islands . And in August , Lava and the Hot Rocks will join five other groups on a three-month , 30-city tour . One of the band ' s upcoming local outings will be Friday at a Red_Cross earthquake relief benefit at the Reseda Country_Club .</TEXT>
