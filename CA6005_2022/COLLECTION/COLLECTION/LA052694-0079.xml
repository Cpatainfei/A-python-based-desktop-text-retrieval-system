   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : POMONA ; GIRL WITH GENE DISORDER NEEDS MARROW DONOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since infancy , 4-year-old Shafon Seeden has fought an extremely rare malady whose very name -- mucopolysaccharidosis , type 6 , maroteaux / lamy syndrome -- is probably unpronounceable for the dark-eyed , Pomona preschooler . Doctors at County USC Medical_Center say they ' ve seen only two cases of the disorder in the past 20 years . The genetic_disorder causes a carbohydrate to accumulate in the body , resulting in bone disfigurement , organ swelling and congested lungs , doctors say . Lacking the enzyme to break_down the carbohydrate , Shafon ' s body could give_out in 16 years . But doctors are hoping a bone_marrow transplant could prolong Shafon ' s life . Two Los Angeles churches last weekend held donor drives for Shafon . They registered 35 potential donors , said Barbara Wilks of the American Red_Cross . Many more are needed . None of Shafon ' s family members have blood_plasma that matches the child ' s . African Americans have a higher probability of matching , but they make_up only 5 % of the 1.2-million people registered nationwide with the Red_Cross ' bone_marrow program , Wilks said . Donor information : ( 800 ) MARROW2 .</TEXT>
