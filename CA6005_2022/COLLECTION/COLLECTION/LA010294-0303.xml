   <HEADLINE> A LOOK AHEAD : OLD TROUBLES PERSIST , NEW OPPORTUNITIES AWAIT ; BOLD FORECAST FOR ' 94 ? IT ' LL BE 365 DAYS LONG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By this time next year in Orange County , this much will be clear : traffic will be worse ; two new faces will be found on the county ' s Board of Supervisors ; government still won ' t have the wherewithal to adequately handle the homeless and confront crime ; and the debate will continue to rage over welfare and health_care reform . Not exactly bold predictions , but pretty safe to say . To many , 1994 will look a lot like 1993 , with some minor adjustments for better or worse . The economy still has a long way to go , but few are willing to predict how much better or worse it may get . The focus_on school choice is likely to intensify , following the defeat of Proposition 174 last year , but is unlikely to be resolved . And somewhere , among all that freeway construction , lies a blueprint for improvement . In politics , county Supervisors Thomas F . Riley and Harriett M . Wieder will say goodby after a collective 36 years in office . Rep . Robert K . Dornan ( R-Garden Grove ) wonders whether reelection or a radio talk_show better fits into his future plans . And in November , there could be a three-way race for mayor in Anaheim . In the weary world of transportation , dollar-juggling will keep the Interstate 5 widening on schedule , probably at the expense of other projects . Environmentalists and builders will continue to clash over how much wetland and coastal sage scrub areas should be saved when development occurs . And development will definitely be occurring at three colleges -- UC Irvine , Cal State Fullerton and Orange Coast College -- as all will unveil some impressive new buildings this year . Here ' s a rundown on what is happening this year in the areas of medicine , county and city governments , the environment , transportation , higher and lower education , social_services and politics . The Environment In many respects , 1994 may shape_up as the year of habitat preservation . The proposed development of Bolsa Chica -- a 1 # 700-acre area fronting Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach -- is expected to take some major steps this year , but not without a concession to preserve the wetlands . In a move opposed by many environmentalists , the Koll Real_Estate Group is planning a 4 # 884-home development at the site which , the company says , would include large portions of restored wetland . Environmentalists want the Bolsa Chica wetlands restored or at least left alone . A recommended compromise by the county includes more open space and less development . Whatever happens , any development is still at least a year away . During the year , the county will be identifying specific &quot; habitat areas &quot; all_over Orange County along with plans to manage them . While the plans were fueled by the federal requirement to save the endangered California gnatcatcher , they also will benefit such other rare species as the cactus_wren , orange throated whiptail_lizard and various plants . Aiding in the effort is a sophisticated new computer_system that , after three years of development , is expected to be fully implemented in 1994 . Called the Wildlife Geographic Information_System , the program will be able to map vegetation , slope , topography , water features and the actual location of major animal species in threatened open areas . Health_Care Tougher economic times and mergers are in the offing for Orange County hospitals in 1994 , and all health_care_providers will be struggling to fit into whatever health_care plan is adopted by Congress , local health_care leaders say . Orange County , like the rest of Southern California , already has taken a leadership position in the move toward medical cost containment with a major shift over the last decade to prepaid managed care insurance programs , they say . This year , the county ' s huge Medi-Cal system will get ready to shift from a traditional fee-for-service program to prepaid managed care , which will begin in early 1995 . The board of directors and administrator of the new Medi-Cal program , called OPTIMA , will have a year to develop a medical_care delivery system . It will be their job to contract with physician groups , hospitals , community clinics and other providers who will treat Medi-Cal patients for a pre-agreed monthly fee . To make themselves attractive to OPTIMA and other contracting organizations , health_care_providers such_as hospitals , doctors and home health_care agencies , are expected to consolidate or form marketing alliances . St . Joseph Health System , the parent organization for St . Joseph Hospital in Orange , recently said it is negotiating a possible acquisition of Mission Regional Hospital Medical_Center in Mission Viejo , and still more hospital mergers are predicted . &quot; I think we will see a continued consolidation of health_care_providers and a lot of bridges built between organizations that were competitors in the past , &quot; said Gordon Martin , president and chief_executive_officer of the Visiting Nurses Assn . of Orange County . Social_Services With the fastest-growing caseload in the state and proposed federal reforms on the horizon , welfare-related issues will be the key concern for social_services agencies in Orange County . &quot; In the area of welfare reform we anticipate next year to be a year of major proposals from the President to the governor , &quot; said Larry Leaman , director of the Orange County Social_Services Agency . &quot; A lot of times , neat-sounding ideas turn_out to be nightmares when you try to implement them . &quot; Orange County welfare_cases have increased 106 % in the past five years . The increase has been attributed to a combination of aerospace layoffs , the long recession and an influx of immigrants . About 45 % of the caseload is a result of immigration and the most dramatic increase is in the area of child welfare , usually in the form of payments made to undocumented immigrants with_children born in the United States . There are 9 # 000 such children in the county , social_services workers say . Meanwhile , officials will be seeking to expand the Greater Avenues for Independence ( GAIN ) program -- a work program for people who receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) . With the help of a state grant , officials expect to serve twice as_many clients as last year . According to Leaman , the program placed 2 # 000 employees last year . The GAIN program assesses the skills of welfare parents and helps them receive the training that they need to find jobs . Lower Education Though Proposition 174 , the school voucher initiative , was overwhelmingly defeated statewide and in Orange County in November , educators expect the fallout of that election to dominate the debate in local school districts in the coming year . Even as they voted against the initiative , Orange County residents voiced a desire for increased choice and more accountability in public_schools . Now the challenge is to improve the schools and give parents more power over their children ' s education before another voucher plan is introduced , teachers and administrators said . Also high on the agenda is the question of school safety , but educators believe the programs they have in place -- strict anti-gang dress codes , prevention programs and curricula and zero-tolerance policies for weapons possession -- are the best tools to fight the rising violence among youth . Proposition 174 &quot; showed faith in public_schools , in public education , but we have to respond by continuing to improve , &quot; said John Dean , superintendent of the Orange County Department_of_Education . &quot; We know that most people like their schools . Now we have to examine every aspect of our educational_program to make_sure we ' re meeting the needs of all kinds of kids. &quot; Several districts plan to focus_on vocational_training and individualized programs for students who are not the most advanced academically . Capistrano Unified , the sprawling South County district , will unveil a school-choice plan to allow parents to choose from a smorgasbord of educational options . At the elementary level , there will be a co-op school , a performing arts program , and magnet schools for math and science ; each high_school will have within it an &quot; academy &quot; in which students can learn about professions such_as medicine or cooking . Higher Education Despite the recession , some major new buildings are scheduled to be completed during the new year at colleges and universities in Orange County . UC Irvine expects its Science Library to open in May . The six-story , 131 # 000-square-foot library building cost $ 32 million and dominates a hill on the west_side of UCI ' s campus . Also , in May , UCI plans to open its Engineering II structure . The 132 # 000-square-foot building , which cost $ 34 million , will have space for classes , research labs and offices . Later this month , Cal State Fullerton will open two new major structures : the $ 26-million Science Laboratory Center and the $ 14.4-million University Hall . In addition , Cal State Fullerton plans to break ground in February on a four-story addition to its existing library . Another major project scheduled to start sometime in 1994 is a $ 10-million upgrading of the university ' s telecommunications_systems . Orange Coast College , a community_college in Costa Mesa , is scheduled to open its $ 8.5-million Vocational Technology Building in May . The two-story , 78 # 000-square-foot building will be the largest on campus . Rancho Santiago College ' s campus in Santa Ana is scheduled to start construction on April 1 on a $ 13-million , 46 # 000-square-foot Computer High-Tech Center . City Government Bedeviled by dwindling finances and plagued with increasing gang problems , cities throughout the county are focusing_on economic development and crime prevention as they enter 1994 . Most cities will be trying to broaden their revenue bases and climb out of a recession that has gripped local_governments and forced significant cuts_in personnel and services . Anaheim officials , for example , hope to work with the Walt Disney Co . to bring a massive $ 3-billion Disneyland expansion project to the city that promises to inject not only Anaheim , but the entire county with thousands of jobs and other economic benefits . Anaheim also is using redevelopment projects to revitalize blighted areas . Among other challenges facing the county ' s second most populous city are : increasing the number of police_officers , and working with the Los Angeles Rams to keep the team in the city . In Santa Ana , officials say they will pay renewed attention to issues of overcrowding , crime and homelessness . A new city jail and police_headquarters are slated for the city next year , said Santa Ana Police_Chief Paul M . Walters . Proposals for the jail -- which would likely require a utility tax_hike of 1 % or more to fund -- are scheduled to go before the City_Council in February , he said . Janet M . Huston with the League of California Cities said the nonprofit group has identified goals for cities for the next year , including the restructuring of government and attracting new businesses . County Government Orange County government faces a year of transition as two veteran supervisors prepare_for retirement and a third fights to keep his gubernatorial appointment . Supervisors Harriett M . Wieder and Thomas F . Riley will leave_office and Supervisor William G . Steiner , appointed to fill the term of former Supervisor Don R . Roth , is girding for a possible challenge . Wieder , the first woman to join the board , has been promoting the candidacy of Huntington Beach businesswoman Haydee Tillotson . Wieder appointed Tillotson to the Orange County Planning_Commission , a position she resigned after only three months to devote more time to campaigning in the North and Central county . While she has Wieder ' s blessing , Tillotson will have plenty of competition . Huntington Beach City Councilman Jim Silva and Councilwoman Linda Moulton-Patterson also are in the race . Riley , meanwhile , is strongly supporting state Sen . Marian Bergeson as successor to the sprawling South County district that he has represented since 1974 . As yet , no other candidates have stepped_forward in South County , but San Juan Capistrano City Councilman Gary L . Hausdorfer has been considering a run , as well . Already ensnarled in controversy over future conversion of El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station , the board is expected to spend much of this election year grappling with yet another budget crisis . In the past two years , Orange County officials have eliminated 1 # 800 positions . The personnel and service cuts have been required to offset the transfer of local property_tax revenue to fund the California public_school system . Transportation Somewhere , at some time , virtually every freeway in Orange County will experience traffic delays in 1994 due_to construction . And that ' s the good news . The bad news is that some projects -- not yet identified -- may be postponed slightly in_order to preserve the construction schedule for the financially strapped widening of the Santa Ana Freeway , a massive $ 1.9-billion face_lift to Orange County ' s true &quot; Main Street. &quot; With some portions already finished , the northernmost segments won ' t be completed at least until 2002 . And construction continues with the ongoing reconstruction of the junction of the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways , the infamous El Toro &quot; Y. &quot; When finished in mid-1996 , the junction will become the world ' s largest interchange -- 26 lanes wide at one point . Construction also will start mid-year on car-pool lanes on I-5 between San Juan Capistrano and the &quot; Y &quot; and on the Riverside Freeway , including car-pool lanes and the state ' s first privately operated toll lanes in the median . Tollway officials hope to resolve all remaining legal disputes that have barred construction on sections of the San Joaquin Hills toll road , while environmentalists are counting_on a federal judge to reject the $ 1.1-billion project ' s environmental impact review as inadequate . A hearing is scheduled for this month . If ordered , redoing the environmental documentation could take a year . Although the vast majority of commuters still will rely_on the automobile , 1994 may mark a subtle shift toward mass transit . In late March , two to three new MetroLink commuter_trains per day will be added_to the schedule between San Juan Capistrano and Los Angeles , where one train now makes a single round_trip daily . that ' s in addition to the nine Amtrak trains that already make round_trips between San Diego and Los Angeles , with some stops in Orange County . Politics Orange County politics has developed the same reputation as Southern California ' s weather : it ' s predictable . Each election year , the chances that Republican incumbents will hold onto their offices are at least as certain as those of blue_skies over the Rose Parade . And this year is no different . Some of the 17 state and federal_districts that represent Orange County probably will see spirited contests for the June primary and November general_election . But the incumbents seeking reelection go_into the year once again as favorites to win . The exception to the rule_in Orange County is likely to be the central core surrounding Santa Ana and Garden Grove . It is a predominantly Democratic area that usually votes Republican . In this election , the area is even more volatile because Assemblyman Tom Umberg ( D-Garden Grove ) and Republican Rep . Dornan have both indicated they may_not seek reelection ( Umberg is exploring a statewide campaign to unseat Republican Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren and Dornan is considering a challenge to Democratic U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein or a 1996 bid for the White_House ) . A host of ambitious political climbers already have expressed interest in both seats , including some influential leaders who could portend a heated campaign if the seats are vacant . Santa Ana Mayor Dan Young said he is considering both seats . County Supervisor Roger R . Stanton has expressed interest in the congressional office , as has Dornan ' s former chief_of_staff , Brian Bennett . Democrat Mike Farber , a San Diego County businessman , already has opened a campaign headquarters to challenge Dornan . If the incumbents seek reelection , however , most observers believe they would be tough to beat . Both promised to announce their decisions early in the new year .

Perlman and Jodi Wilgoren contributed to this report .</TEXT>
