   <HEADLINE> NATO CHIEF UPBEAT ON MEMBERSHIP PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> NATO Secretary_General Manfred Woerner declared Friday that he believes Russia and other Eastern European_nations will accept a plan that would eventually admit the former Communist states as members . Such acceptance would guarantee a success for next week ' s summit_meeting of the 16-member North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization -- and for President Clinton ' s first European appearance as leader of the Western alliance . The NATO summit_meeting in Brussels next Monday and Tuesday will result in approval of the controversial &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; program , Woerner said , which offers to East European_nations , including Russia , closer military ties with the West and the prospect of eventual NATO membership . Though Clinton will travel_to Eastern Europe after the summit to reassure various leaders , including those in Moscow and Ukraine , Woerner predicted that the summit results will satisfy most of them . Other European officials have suggested that Clinton must demonstrate leadership qualities at Brussels and sell the new plan to East European leaders if NATO is to have a serious future as an alliance . In Warsaw on Friday , American envoys and Polish leaders met to try to win support for the partnership . As an incentive for Poland to accept limited NATO membership , one of the U.S. delegates , Joint Chiefs_of_Staff Chairman Gen . John Shalikashvili , said the alliance is willing to hold joint exercises with Polish forces in Poland , the New York Times and The Washington Post reported in today ' s editions . Partnership for Peace is the centerpiece of the NATO summit -- considered by many the most important in its 45-year history because of the complexity of creating a new role for the organization by offering East Europeans a security_blanket without offending Moscow . The East Europeans insist that they need NATO ' s security guarantees to pursue democratic , free-market policies unhindered by Russian threats . But Russia objects to an extension of NATO ' s protective borders alongside the former Soviet_Union , creating what Moscow says is a new_line dividing East and West . Woerner , a former German defense minister , said he believes that opening the door to future NATO membership for East European_nations -- including Russia and former Soviet countries such_as Ukraine -- could resolve the current alliance argument as_to NATO ' s new role in the wake of its success during 40 years of the Cold_War . But he admitted that some East European leaders &quot; might not be fully satisfied &quot; -- or might even be disappointed by -- the NATO offer . The Partnership for Peace plan does not set a definite timetable or specific set of guidelines for full NATO membership . Woerner , in a telephone_interview with American correspondents in London , Bonn and Washington simultaneously , was asked whether Bosnia-Herzegovina would belatedly be included on the summit agenda . He said the_French had asked to discuss the problems of the U.N. peacekeeping and humanitarian force there . Further , he said U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali held a private conference with the U.N. commander in the former Yugoslavia , French General Jean Cot , who complained that the military_force is ill equipped to act effectively . Woerner said he favored a stronger Western reaction to the bloody events in former Yugoslavia but that NATO had not been called_upon by the United Nations to provide one . Nevertheless , the secretary_general said NATO is still prepared to launch air strikes against warring factions in Bosnia -- if requested to do so by the U.N. Security_Council .</TEXT>
