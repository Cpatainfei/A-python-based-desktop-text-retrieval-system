   <TEXT> Xu Kuangdi , Shanghai ' s urbane deputy mayor , likes to regale foreign guests with the story of a provincial official who recently visited this booming city on China ' s east coast . The traffic was , as usual , impossible . Thousands of Volkswagen sedans , produced here in China ' s largest auto factory , clogged narrow lanes designed a century ago for rickshaws . Dust from 4 # 000 construction sites clouded the air . Sulfurous emissions from factories added the scent of heavy industry . Although the distance from Hong Qiao International Airport to Shanghai City_Hall is a little more_than 10 miles , it took the visiting official nearly two hours to cover the route . But instead of being irritated by the halting journey , the official , from impoverished Guizhou province , was ecstatic . &quot; I hope someday in my province we can have such a traffic problem , &quot; he told his apologetic host . In his provincial_capital , the official informed Xu sadly , it takes only seven minutes to go from the airport to City_Hall . There are too few automobiles and too few construction projects to block the way . Shanghai , with an official population of 13 million people and an additional 2 million construction workers imported from the provinces , may be polluted , dusty and choking in traffic . But today it is the envy of all China , emerging as the leading symbol of the country ' s incipient economic might and , increasingly , as a star player on the political stage . Once mistrusted by the Communist leadership because of its colonial-era history as a treaty_port where foreign powers engaged in the opium trade , Shanghai is back in_vogue , even with the Communists . President Jiang Zemin , the heir-apparent to ailing 90-year-old senior leader Deng Xiaoping , was once mayor of Shanghai . So was the country ' s powerful economic czar , Vice Premier Zhu Rongji . In October , two more Shanghai party officials , current Mayor Huang Ju and local party chief Wu Bangguo , were appointed to the 20-member Politburo of the Chinese Communist_Party Central Committee -- raising to four the Shanghai representation on the country ' s most powerful ruling body . In political commentaries , the catty Hong Kong newspapers began to talk_of a &quot; Shanghai gang &quot; in the center of Chinese politics . &quot; Officials from Shanghai now occupy one-fifth of the important Politburo posts , &quot; announced the newspaper Ming Pao . South China Morning Post columnist Willy Wo-lap Lam , Hong Kong ' s leading pundit on Chinese politics , proclaimed it the &quot; ascendancy of the Shanghai faction. &quot; The appointments provoked jealousy in other cities , including the haughty capital , Beijing , where outside competition for preeminence is not appreciated . &quot; If a young politician wants to be a high-ranking official today , &quot; one Foreign Ministry employee in Beijing commented caustically , &quot; he should move to Shanghai. &quot; In fact , the key political appointments were at least partly a reward for the city ' s enormous contribution to the central treasury , which gets_about one-fourth of its tax_revenue from the Shanghai industrial base . The appointments also reflected a concerted effort , initiated by Deng himself , to shift some of the economic spotlight away from southern Guangdong province , near Hong Kong , which is viewed by the Communist leadership as politically unstable . In June , 1989 , after the army crackdown on the Tian An Men Square pro-democracy demonstrators , more_than 500 # 000 protesters took_to the streets in Hong Kong . Anti-government sentiments were just as strong across the border , especially in the Pearl River metropolis Guangzhou ( Canton ) . Until then , most of the central government ' s financial commitment to the &quot; special economic zones &quot; was in the south , in Hainan Island and Guangdong provinces . &quot; When they saw all those Hong Kong people in the streets , &quot; said a diplomat based in Shanghai , &quot; I think the government suddenly realized that it had too many eggs in the south China basket , where things looked_out of control . Meanwhile , there was Shanghai. &quot; During the 1989 turmoil , Shanghai remained mostly peaceful . Then-Mayor Zhu Rongji went_on radio after the army had cleared central Beijing of pro-democracy demonstrators , killing hundreds , perhaps thousands of them . He appealed for calm , offering students an enigmatic hope for redemption . &quot; Don ' t be impetuous , &quot; he cautioned . &quot; History will show who was right or wrong. &quot; Shanghai ' s relative tranquillity earned the gratitude of the rulers in Beijing . In a speech published for the first time last year , Deng said &quot; one of my biggest mistakes &quot; was excluding Shanghai from the special economic zones set_up in 1978 as part of his economic reform program . Shanghai was belatedly added_to the list in 1990 . Since then , the central government has committed $ 40 billion , more_than in any other city , to a public works program here . In Shanghai , Deng ' s 1978 slight seems to have been long forgotten , if not forgiven . Xu , expected to be named the mayor when the National People ' s Congress meets next year , speaks with pride of his city ' s dizzying growth , comparing it to the rise of the great American cities in the late 19th Century . &quot; Shanghai is much like the United States , I think , &quot; said Xu , slipping into the facile English he perfected as an engineer working in Sweden . &quot; It is an emerging city . One hundred years ago , Shanghai had only a 30 # 000 population . Now it has more_than 13 million. &quot; With an engaging smile and salesman ' s enthusiasm , the balding Xu launched into a list of Shanghai ' s modern industrial milestones . &quot; All the modern industries started in Shanghai . . . the Long March Rocket ( China ' s powerful satellite launching rocket ) was designed and manufactured in Shanghai . . . the first Chinese wristwatch was a Shanghai watch . . . the first passenger_car . . . the first big ship of 10 # 000 tons was made in Shanghai . . . the first submarine. &quot; The key to Shanghai ' s success , Xu said , is its unique combination of &quot; Chinese traditional culture and Western culture. &quot; Only 20 years ago , during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution , such talk would have been considered blasphemy . The ruling Maoists had rejected Western ways and launched campaigns to destroy outsiders ' icons . Today , however , Shanghai proudly celebrates itself as the most Western of Chinese cities . Xu , 57 , was interviewed in the reception_room at City_Hall . The stately building in the riverfront Bund district features marble Ionic columns and mosaic tile floors . It was once the main_office of the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank , bastion of British imperialist finance . In a historic reversion that says much about the Chinese economic transformation , it was recently repurchased by the original owners , now based in Hong Kong , and will be reopened as the bank ' s Shanghai office . Much of the historic Shanghai Bund , in fact , is for_sale . And the Communist municipal offices are moving to new buildings elsewhere in the city . Located on the west_bank of the Huangpu River , the Bund remains one of Shanghai ' s most vibrant and expensive areas . Nanjing Road , the glitzy shopping street that leads to the Bund , becomes a blaze of neon at nightfall . On a narrow street around the corner from City_Hall is a karaoke bar catering to foreign tourists and a newly opened beer hall that brews its own boutique beer in copper kettles . One store features the latest in multimedia computers . Another offers handmade violins . Given a choice , despite the inconvenience of getting there though the horrendous traffic , most Shanghai natives would choose to live_in this exciting district if they could afford the skyrocketing rents . The standard joke in Shanghai is &quot; Better a bed in Puxi &quot; -- the western bank of the Huangpu , including the Bund -- &quot; than a house in Pudong , &quot; on the other side of the river . But Pudong , formerly the vegetable_garden for Shanghai , is where the municipal_government has pinned its hopes for the future . To entice foreign investment and development , the government created a master development plan with wide roads and industrial_parks . In a flurry of infrastructure building , the Shanghai government has erected two of the world ' s largest steel cable bridges , two tunnels and a new subway line , all since 1985 , to connect Pudong with the old city_center . Twenty ferry boats also travel between Puxi and Pudong . For the massive construction needed in Pudong , the city government imported 2 million workers from interior provinces . The way in which Shanghai imported the labor is one of the city ' s main success stories and another reason it won the heart of the central government . City officials traveled inland where they created companies to recruit construction workers on a limited contract basis . The workers were guaranteed housing and medical_care and were issued &quot; blue work cards &quot; giving them permission to come_to Shanghai for a limited time until their construction projects ended . The &quot; blue card &quot; system helped Shanghai avoid the massive influx of migrant laborers that has plagued Beijing and Guangzhou . Beijing is estimated to have 1.6 million such workers ; Guangzhou , more_than 2 million . But unlike Shanghai , neither city has a method of regulating the migrant population , which many fear will become the nucleus of social unrest . So far , more_than $ 8 billion has been invested in Pudong , including in major projects by the American chemical giant DuPont and the Japanese electronics firm Sharp . In one of the buildings in the Shanghai Lingqiao ( Golden Bridge ) Export Processing Zone in Pudong , a large-scale model is_on display for senior officials and foreign guests . The model , on a hydraulic pedestal surrounded by a stainless_steel railing , shows Pudong as Shanghai officials dream it will become -- an ultramodern community with parks and villas next to pollution-free industrial_parks . Tiny ducks swim in limpid blue ponds . On the walls of the frigidly air-conditioned model room , decorated in subtle grays and blues , are pictures of China ' s senior leaders . The calligraphy of Deng himself ( &quot; Pudong Development Area Offers Great Hope &quot; ) is_on one wall . Outside , Pudong is still a dusty , polluted development zone bearing little similarity to the idealized model . But ever the optimist and consummate salesman for Shanghai , Xu advises visitors not to be put_off by the dust and the grit . &quot; Pudong is still under construction , &quot; the deputy mayor said . &quot; Around construction it is always very dirty , with a lot of dust . &quot; After all , &quot; he said with a contagious smile , &quot; if everything is very quiet and clean , it means it is not developed. &quot;</TEXT>
