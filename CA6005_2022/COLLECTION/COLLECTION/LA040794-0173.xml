   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; A BATTERED BODY POLITIC ; CONTROVERSY , INFIGHTING CHARACTERIZE ELECTIONS IN HUB CITIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Picture a red-white-and-blue sort of ribbon-cutting ceremony , the type held_in towns everywhere . City_council candidates nod approvingly during the dedication of a new sports program at the youth center . Parents and their children mill_about , sharing hot dogs , sodas and the latest gossip . Suddenly , good manners dissolve and one candidate allegedly shoulder-slams another ' s 16-year-old cheerleader daughter . Assault charges are filed with the police_department and the two candidates , former political allies , go_to court . One candidate seeks a temporary restraining order . The other tells the judge the incident is imaginary . Welcome to election season in Southeast Los Angeles County , where politics as usual is anything but . From Vernon to South Gate , from Huntington Park to Bell Gardens , local politics in the area known as the Hub Cities is often a hubbub of conflict and scandal . Even to a jaded electorate that has come_to expect political infighting and allegations , the consistent record of controversy in the densely populated 12-square-mile area stands_out . Consider recent history in Bell Gardens . In addition to the alleged assault on a candidate ' s daughter , there have been two recall campaigns launched in the past three years , closed session chair-throwing , allegations of voter fraud after the last two elections , and a council_member fined $ 1 # 500 by the Fair Political Practices Commission for illegally casting a vote . More recently , incumbent Josefina ( Josie ) Macias alleged that she received threatening letters and that her husband was run_off the road by her opponents ' supporters . Allegations of jobs and scholarships offered in return for votes and accusations of other political dirty tricks abound . Police_Chief Andy Romero has told council_members that he has turned so many city investigations over to the district_attorney , the office is overwhelmed . Things have gotten so bad that &quot; people feel embarrassed &quot; to admit they live_in Bell Gardens , said Councilwoman Rosa Hernandez , who is seeking her second term . &quot; When people ask where they live , they say : ' A little place near Downey. ' &quot; Some say Bell Gardens politics is still recovering from the animosity created by the historic 1991 recall campaign that ousted four white council_members and gave the city its first Latino council majority . But while the recall may have focused a media microscope on that city ' s political blemishes , it is not the only place in the area where politics is said to be , if not dirty , in need of a good dusting . * In tiny Cudahy , where a half-dozen recall campaigns have been launched in as_many years , one finally reached the ballot last year . Councilman John O . Robertson survived a recall effort organized by his four council colleagues only to become an issue in this year ' s election -- and he isn ' t even a candidate . Robertson and two other men agreed to pay a $ 39 # 000 settlement in October after being named in a civil suit alleging that they misused funds from the Hub Cities Consortium , a regional job training_program . But the defendants missed the December payment deadline and fees now amount to about $ 55 # 000 . Robertson backs two council candidates who , some fear , if elected would vote to have the city pay his debt . Robertson asserts no fraud was found and it is the city ' s legal responsibility to support him . * In Huntington Park , Councilman Luis M . Hernandez , running_for his second term , still owes the Fair Political Practices Commission $ 10 # 000 from more_than $ 20 # 000 in fines for violations he racked_up during two other campaigns . The FPPC charged Hernandez with 11 violations of campaign disclosure practices in two campaigns , which it said &quot; denied the public important information &quot; before the two elections . The fines , Hernandez said , are &quot; merely a smudge on my record rather than something that should take me out office . We feel we were fined substantially for first-time offenders. &quot; Meanwhile , Hernandez ally and political newcomer MariCarmen Medrano has asked the district_attorney to investigate alleged fraudulent use of absentee_ballots in the city . * In South Gate , candidate Ted Moore , a vocal council critic who was summarily dismissed from the planning_commission this year , temporarily vanished . Moore , who many depended_on as council watchdog , filed candidate ' s papers and then disappeared without notifying the city . After some investigative work , officials determined that he had sold his house . Moore was missing for several weeks before he called City Clerk Nina Banuelos to inform her he was in Las Vegas and insisted he was still a candidate . He still has yet to surface in South Gate . The eight-city region that lies southeast of Downtown Los Angeles -- Bell , Bell Gardens , Cudahy , Commerce , Huntington Park , Maywood , South Gate and Vernon -- is a residential landscape characterized by single-family homes , card casinos and factories . Settled by Midwesterners and Dust_Bowl refugees who sought a better life in California , the area was until the 1970s a middle-class white community where bustling industry backed_up to thriving neighborhoods . Within the past 20 years , the Southeast area has become a first stop for Latino immigrants and one of the poorer , more overcrowded regions in the state . Between 1980 and 1990 , the population in Southeast cities grew by up_to 33 % and most of the newcomers were Latino . During the same period , heavy industry and some of the area ' s largest employers , such_as General Motors , moved away , leaving toxic_waste_sites to clean_up and thousands of people unemployed . If political instability and malfeasance in the area appear epidemic , the turbulence is no mystery , experts say . Local politics are a reflection of the demographic and economic upheaval in the area . &quot; It ' s a really tough time to be councilman in one of these Southeast cities , &quot; said political_scientist Fernando J . Guerra , who heads the Chicano studies department at Loyola Marymount University . &quot; The demographic shift is understated and understudied in the Southeast , &quot; Guerra said . &quot; The area has gone from 95 % white to 80 % and . . . up_to 95 % Hispanic . The area has deindustrialized and the tremendous transition that is occurring creates instability and political insecurity . . . . Until the late 1980s , the councils weren ' t representative , but they were stable. &quot; Despite the overwhelmingly Latino population , five of the eight city_councils still have white majorities . But whether political representation of Latinos has come_with a jolt , as in Bell Gardens , or more gradually , as in Huntington Park , all_the local city_councils have begun to reflect their changed constituencies . Anyone who assumed that Latino representation would mean harmony was sorely disappointed to see the Bell Gardens council break_into bickering so fierce that two members now rarely speak . In Huntington Park , the Latino majority does not vote as a bloc . In fact , Councilman Hernandez ' s campaign rhetoric targets incumbent Raul Perez , also seeking his second term . Such disagreements shouldn ' t surprise anyone because &quot; Latinos cannot be identified as a political entity &quot; any more_than whites or African Americans , said David Hayes-Bautista , director of the Alta California Research_Center , a Los Angeles think_tank that studies Latino issues . The difference , Hayes-Bautista said , is that in many cases the new crop of Latino council_members has been ill-prepared to lead . Historically , California ' s Latino community has had few institutions to nurture leadership , Hayes-Bautista said . Unlike the African American community , where churches and black colleges and universities have provided stages to test aspiring leaders , few Latino leaders enter the political_arena with experience ; thus , they are making their mistakes in the harsh public limelight . Economic hard_times have made the transition from white to Latino control even more difficult . Latinos elected to represent the concerns of working-class and poor constituents have had to impose utility taxes , assessments and budget_cuts to steady sinking city budgets . &quot; You have representation in those communities now , but ( new Latino leaders ) need to deal with very real problems there , &quot; said Larry Berg , director of the Jesse M . Unruh Institute of Politics at USC . &quot; They ' re at a distinct disadvantage because they don ' t have the resources to do it. &quot; Candidates and incumbents acknowledge that council battles in the Southeast area have contributed to the region ' s turmoil . Huntington Park Councilman Raul R . Perez said city_councils should use political appointments and other means to nurture potential leaders . &quot; For a long_time I criticized the council because they didn ' t prepare anyone to take_over when they left , &quot; said Perez , who is seeking his second term . &quot; I appointed a_couple_of people ( to commissions ) who are running against me now , but I can ' t criticize them because they have to cut their teeth somehow. &quot; In Bell Gardens , council challenger Maria Victoria Martinez has included parenting , leadership and citizenship classes in her platform . Residents need to take responsibility for the community and help keep their leaders accountable , she said . &quot; So many people here are new immigrants and they aren ' t used to speaking out and taking leadership roles , &quot; Martinez said . Voter apathy and a large non-citizen population play a role in lack of accountability in the area , observers said . About 40 % to 50 % of residents in the Southeast cities are not U.S. citizens , according to the 1990 Census . Of those registered to vote_in the 1990 Bell election , 16 % turned_out . The 1992 election was canceled because the incumbents drew no challengers . Lack of media coverage is also a problem in the area , said Gregory Rodriguez , a researcher with the Alta California Research_Center , who has studied the Southeast region . The South Gate Press and other local newspapers stopped publishing by 1992 , creating a communication gap between city officials and residents . &quot; Politics becomes irrelevant because no one knows what ' s happening , &quot; Rodriguez said . City_council candidates rallied some voters in 1992 by making race and representation into campaign issues . This year , 35 of 53 candidates are Latino , bread-and-butter issues such_as accountability and crime are back in_vogue , and some question whether having Latino leaders has made a difference . In South Gate , where the council still has a white majority , &quot; some people say it should be a Latino council because the majority of us are Latino , &quot; said Victorio Gutierrez , a South Gate High_School teacher . &quot; But it doesn ' t matter if you ' re white , pink or blue , you still need to be accountable . . . . It doesn ' t matter who gets_in as long as they listen to the people. &quot; In Bell Gardens , home of what some called a Latino revolution , voters &quot; are ashamed &quot; of their Latino leaders , said a longtime resident who would identify himself only as Ramon . &quot; They say we have Latinos in there , but it was better the other way. &quot; But even dogged Bell Gardens critics , such_as former council candidate Victor Vaillette , said the leadership has matured and members have overcome initial gridlock to enact innovative policy . Recent approval of a city-sponsored student loan program and support for a badly needed family health clinic demonstrate the council is capable of proactive policy that addresses some of the community ' s more pressing concerns , Vaillette said . Having Latinos on the council has encouraged Huntington Park residents to participate in city meetings and programs , said Rudy Griego , a Huntington Park businessman and former Chamber_of_Commerce president . &quot; Latino leaders make ( residents ) want to vote and feel ( the city ) is theirs , &quot; said Rodriguez of the Alta California Research_Center . &quot; That will translate eventually into better government. &quot; The fact that the Southeast cities worked together to bring a branch of East Los Angeles College to Huntington Park is also an example of Latino leaders having an impact in the region , said Assemblywoman Martha M . Escutia ( D-Huntington Park ) . &quot; I frankly don ' t think that would have happened without Latino leaders on the councils , &quot; she said . Election officials in many cities said the campaigns this year have been relatively calm despite some requisite sign-stealing and name-calling . Still , fierce battles are being waged in Huntington Park and Bell Gardens , among other places . Huntington Park Councilman Luis Hernandez and maverick MariCarmen Medrano have faced_off against incumbent Raul Perez , former state legislative aide Rosario Marin and real_estate_agent Jessica Maes . There , camps are trading allegations of voter fraud and misinformation . In Bell Gardens , opponents of challenger Maria Chacon allege that her camp is using bribery , intimidation and fraud to win the election , charges that Chacon vehemently denies . Chacon , a catalyst in the 1991 recall movement , has split with incumbent Josie Macias and teamed on the ticket with Planning Commissioner Ramiro Morales . Candidates in Maywood , Bell Gardens and Huntington Park are among those pushing residents to vote by absentee_ballot and hoping to lock_up their victories before Election_Day . Maywood City Clerk Samuel A . Pena said he has had more_than 800 requests for absentee_ballots in a city where only about 1 # 200 voted_in the previous municipal election . Large_numbers of candidates -- 11 in South Gate and nine in Huntington Park -- also have complicated the races and are certain to make them closer , officials said . While the beleaguered councils stumble into maturity , real stability in the Southeast area could be a long_time coming , Rodriguez said . In Bell Gardens , officials have estimated a 30 % transience rate in the city and less than 25 % of the 42 # 000 homes are owner-occupied , numbers that illustrate the instability of the population . As long as the Southeast region remains an entry point for new immigrants -- a highly mobile population -- community leaders need to find ways to incorporate non-citizens into the political life of the city , Rodriguez said . He pointed to a Bell Gardens student loan program -- which requires parents to remain in the city while students are accepting city money and includes a community service component -- as an innovative example of programs that can encourage residents to stay_put and become citizens . &quot; ( The Southeast area ) is at a nascent stage , but it will coalesce and get past the chair-throwing , &quot; Rodriguez said . &quot; I don ' t think you can categorize these cities by allegation and indictments . This is only a snapshot in time and it will pass. &quot; Tuesday ' s election is not expected to be a major turning point for the Southeast area , but another small step_in the area ' s maturation process . If the region can overcome its growing pains , Rodriguez said , it has the potential to become a regional political power to be reckoned with . &quot; We will bring pride back to the city of Bell Gardens , &quot; Councilwoman Hernandez stated at a recent council meeting . &quot; We just need to survive this period. &quot;</TEXT>
