   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : VENTURA ; SMALL QUAKE SHAKES COASTAL REGION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A small earthquake deep under Emma Wood State Beach shook the coastal area overnight , authorities said Friday . The 2.8 magnitude quake , which struck at 11:58 p.m. Thursday , was centered about two miles northwest of Ventura and about four miles beneath the sand and surf , seismologist Egill Hauksson of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said . There were no reports of damage or injuries . The quake was unrelated to the thousands of aftershocks of the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake and was a routine release of the local tension that builds whenever the oceanic and continental crustal plates bind along the San Andreas Fault , Hauksson said . While the Pacific Plate creeps about two inches a year in a northwesterly direction , the Continental Plate correspondingly moves to the southeast , creating friction , he said . He said the San Andreas Fault , where the two meet , borders much of northern Ventura County , making the area seismically active . Since 1984 , nine earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or less have shaken the same area off Ventura , Hauksson said . He said it was unknown whether it was related to the two large faults near Ventura -- the Red Mountain Fault north of the city or the Oak Ridge Fault beneath Oxnard . GREG RIPPEE</TEXT>
