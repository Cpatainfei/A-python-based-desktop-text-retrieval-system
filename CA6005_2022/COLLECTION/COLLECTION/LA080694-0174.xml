   <HEADLINE> LANDFILL GAS CONVERTED TO ELECTRICITY ; ENERGY : GLENDALE ' S $ 10-MILLION PROJECT IS ONE OF EIGHT SUCH SYSTEMS IN COUNTY . IT IS THE MOST POWERFUL ONE IN THE VALLEY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the turn of a valve , gas created by garbage rotting at a local landfill was used to generate enough electricity for 30 # 000 homes Friday . It sounds like an environmentalist ' s dream , but the process is becoming a reality for municipalities across the country . Eight such systems are now being used at landfills and power_plants throughout Los Angeles County , according to sanitation officials . Three of them , including Glendale ' s , are in the San Fernando Valley . The county ' s landfill system is_on the verge of a crisis as the capacity to hold solid waste diminishes . Diverting landfill gas toward power_plants will do little to improve the condition of dumping grounds , say officials with the Sanitary Districts of Los Angeles County . But many agree that gas-to-energy systems are good for the environment and can sometimes generate a profit for participating agencies . &quot; It ' s a win-win-win all_the way around , &quot; John Cosulich , a supervising engineer with the sanitation agency , said of a similar operation in Whittier . Cindy Jacobs , who works for the federal Environmental Protection Agency , has been assigned specifically to encourage greater use of the process nationwide . &quot; We view them as being extremely environmentally beneficial , &quot; she said . Glendale ' s $ 10-million project is the most powerful gas-to-energy system in the Valley , capable of reaching two to three times the number of households served by the other sites . Methane and carbon_dioxide naturally emitted by decomposing trash at the Scholl Canyon Landfill is collected , treated , compressed and dehydrated with equipment at the site . It is then transported to the city ' s power_plant 5 1 / 2 miles away via a pipeline beneath city streets . When it reaches the Grayson Power_Plant , the gas is blended with more methane gas and used to fuel the boilers that produce electrical_power . On Friday , Glendale Mayor Eileen Givens smashed a champagne bottle against an above-ground portion of the pipeline and turned a large valve that ushered the landfill gas into the power_plant . &quot; We come_together to publicly dedicate this pipeline , &quot; she told a gathered audience . &quot; My city colleagues would want me to say , ' It ' s been a real gas. ' &quot; Virtually everyone involved with the project -- city officials , the developer , homeowners and officials with the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County -- expects to benefit . Over 20 years , Glendale city officials anticipate revenues and savings of $ 40 million stemming partly from fewer dollars spent on gas needed to operate the power_plant . The project ' s developer , Palmer Capital Corp . of Massachusetts , will sell the treated gas to the city for at least $ 330 # 000 a month , a discount of 12.5 % from what the city spent for natural_gas . Dave Weaver , president of the Glenoaks Canyon Homeowners Assn . and a civil_engineer , considers the pipeline safe from unexpected accidents . &quot; This is not going_to blow_up , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s not under that kind of pressure . We explained that to our members. &quot; The Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County , which operates the Scholl Canyon Landfill , does not share_in any money generated by the Glendale project , but it earns more_than $ 40 million a year from the Puente Hills Landfill in Whittier by selling electricity to Southern California Edison . Other gas-to-energy operations are located at the Bradley and Penrose landfills in Sun Valley , and landfills in Pomona , Palos Verdes , West Covina and the Griffith Park area . After more_than three years of negotiations , Glendale city officials allowed installation to begin on the pipeline -- mostly along Lexington Drive and Glenoaks Boulevard -- in January . It was completed six months later . The Scholl Canyon Landfill collects about 2 # 000 tons of garbage a day from Glendale , Pasadena , Sierra Madre , San Marino and unincorporated parts of Los Angeles County . Garbage takes years to decompose . But all landfills emit methane gas around the clock , a substance that environmentalists say contributes to smog and global warming . Methane gas collected at the Glendale landfill had been set_afire and released into the atmosphere regularly , city officials said . &quot; The alternative ( to gas-to-energy systems ) is much worse environmentally , &quot; said Maribel Marin , a senior research associate for the Natural_Resources Defense Council . &quot; This method is by far superior. &quot; Pipeline Project A &quot; gas to energy &quot; pipeline opened Friday in Glendale . Gas from decomposing refuse at Scholl Canyon Landfill will be piped to Grayson Power_Plant , then treated and converted to electricity . Source : City of Glendale</TEXT>
