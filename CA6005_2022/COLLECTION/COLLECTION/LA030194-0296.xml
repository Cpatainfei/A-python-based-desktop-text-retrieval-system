   <TEXT> It ' s the year 2003 . With public transportation as slow and unreliable as ever , you ' re still driving to work . But you ' ve decided to make the daily commute a little more pleasant by junking the old 1994 Ford Taurus and buying a fully loaded Chrysler sports coupe . You liked the Toyota , but it was twice as expensive . When you unlock the door , the seats and mirrors automatically adjust to your favorite position . You turn the ignition and the engine purrs . The coupe is the same size as your old car but somehow roomier . The dashboard looks about the same except for the liquid_crystal_display of the on-board computer that flashes maps , maintenance information and electronic_mail . As you put the car into reverse to back_out of the driveway , the little screen displays a picture of the sidewalk and road behind you . A small video camera above the rear license_plate is scanning the area for cars and pedestrians . The way is clear , so you pull_out and drive_away . You have an appointment across town , but you don ' t know the way . Push the navigator button on your display and , enunciating clearly , give the address of your destination . A voice recognition system picks_up the address , searches its database and flips through a CD-ROM filled with maps of the area . Almost instantaneously , a map appears on the display and , with data from a satellite signal , the computer indicates the exact location of your car with a red dot that moves as you move . A blue line shows the best road to take_to avoid traffic . Pulling onto the freeway and putting the car on cruise_control , you let your eyes drift to the horizon , where white clouds are floating lazily by . Beep ! Your forward laser-based radar system is warning that the truck ahead of you is suddenly slowing and you ' re dangerously close . You step_on the brakes , your heart pumping at the close_call . It is a close_call , and you ' re glad you went_with the eight-tire option along with the standard anti-skid brakes . Engineers have known for years that while highly pressurized tires drive the most efficiently , soft tires are better for braking . Only recently did they begin offering cars with four double tires that use a set of highly pressurized inner tires for efficient high-speed driving . When you brake , the computerized suspension_system puts the additional four soft tires on_the_road for extra gripping power . The extra wheels also help grab the road for sharp cornering . Nevertheless , still flustered , you decide to move_over to the slow_lane . As you try to turn your wheel , it stiffens and there is another beep , this time from the side sensor . A picture comes_up on your display showing a little sports_car driving alongside you in a blind_spot your mirrors hadn ' t picked_up . You wait for the car to pass , pull_off the freeway and take_a_breather . If this sounds futuristic , it is . But the technology for this experience is already available . And safety will become an increasingly critical factor_in the design of tomorrow ' s cars . * Less certain is the extent to which heightened environmental consciousness and energy concerns will force a radical change in the engines and materials of 21-Century automobiles . The expert consensus is that they won ' t . &quot; Most changes will be evolutionary , &quot; says David Cole , director of the University of Michigan ' s Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation . The institute recently completed a three-volume study of how cars will change_over the next 10 years . Based on the views of a wide range of industry experts , it concludes that cars will get_about 8 % lighter as a result of the introduction of more plastics , aluminum and steel alloys . Average mileage will climb to about 32 miles a gallon . The biggest changes will be in electronics , Cole says . He predicts 20 % of the car ' s value will be represented by the electronic system , up from about 11 % today . Microprocessors will be connected by wire or radio to sensors throughout the car to operate the warning systems , measure tire pressure , check gasoline levels and control the standard air_bags ( front and back seat ) and anti-lock brakes . There is an alternative view on where the car is headed , and how fast . Critics of Detroit ' s conventional wisdom predict another external shock that will force changes on the industry , just as the oil shock forced Detroit to build smaller , more efficient cars in the early 1970s . It could be new federal regulations concerning pollution , or it could be another energy crisis . that ' s the kind of future that designer Michael Seal has_in_mind . As director of Western Washington University ' s Vehicle Research_Center , he works with his students building state-of-the-art technology into experimental cars . He hopes clean , efficient cars will be a status symbol of the 21st Century . For Seal , who has done consulting work for Ford and Chrysler , today ' s car is packed with features of questionable value -- such_as electronically controlled windows , locks and sun roofs and gasoline-hungry engines . But he concedes that most American consumers will never accept the sacrifices in performance and distance driving required in an all-electric car . So his latest car , the Viking 21 , has a hybrid engine . In the city , it runs_on electric_batteries that can be charged with a home outlet or by solar_cells pasted to the car ' s roof . On a long drive , the car would be powered by an engine fueled by cheap , clean natural_gas . The grinding noise it makes each time the car is braked is the sound of a generator using the braking power to recharge the batteries . Seal ' s next car , the Viking 23 , will be made of carbon fiber and weigh less than half today ' s average automobile . The motor will generate its own electricity by burning natural_gas and directing infrared rays at highly efficient photovoltaic_cells . Its efficiency : the equivalent of a car getting 150 miles to the gallon . Japanese companies are working_on some interesting variations on the internal_combustion engine . Mazda and Mitsubishi are investigating engines that operate more efficiently by adjusting the capacity of the engine according to the power required for the job . Driving in the city , for example , a Mitsubishi six-cylinder engine would shut_down one bank and operate_on only three . For long distances , all six cylinders would kick_in . * David L . Greene , a researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in Oak Ridge , Tenn. , offers another solution . He suggests that cars use highly efficient , 40 horsepower internal_combustion engines . In instances when more power is needed for climbing a hill or passing , an electric_motor would kick_in . Detroit , which has a huge investment in factory equipment , training and technology that would be lost if automobile technology veered in a new direction , isn ' t receptive to even minor changes in the design of the engine . But that could change too . Seal recalls how a General Motors engineer laughed_at him in 1971 when he talked_about the importance of aerodynamic design . &quot; The guy told me aerodynamics was irrelevant unless you were driving at above 200 miles an hour . They kept building cars like shoe boxes , &quot; Seal recalled . Two years later , he said , Detroit engineers were calling him for advice on building more aerodynamic cars .</TEXT>
