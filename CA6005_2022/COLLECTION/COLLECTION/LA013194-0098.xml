   <HEADLINE> LEADER OF IRA POLITICAL WING ISSUED U.S. VISA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration issued a visa Sunday to Gerry Adams , leader of the political wing of the outlawed Irish_Republican_Army , overriding a two-decade-old policy that had barred him from the United States because of his links to terrorism . A White_House statement announcing the decision said President Clinton believes that permitting Adams to attend a conference in New York this week &quot; will advance the cause of peace in Northern Ireland. &quot; Under the terms of the visa , Adams , leader of Sinn Fein , the IRA ' s legal political front , may remain in the United States for only 48 hours and must stay within a 25-mile radius of the Waldorf Astoria , the posh mid-Manhattan hotel where the conference on Northern_Ireland will be held Tuesday . The conditions also prohibit Adams from engaging in &quot; direct or indirect fund raising &quot; while he is in the United States . The White_House said Atty . Gen . Janet Reno , acting_on the recommendation of Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , issued a waiver of the U.S. law denying visas to anyone connected with the IRA or other terrorist groups . Adams remains subject_to the statute , the White_House said , and will not be eligible to visit this country again without another waiver . The State_Department signaled a softening of its policy toward the Sinn Fein leader last week when it offered to give Adams a visa if he would renounce terrorism and endorse the Northern_Ireland peace plan issued Dec . 15 by British Prime_Minister John Major and Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds . After a meeting Friday with U.S. Consul General Val Martinez in Belfast , Adams went partway toward meeting the American conditions , although he stopped short of endorsing the Major-Reynolds plan . Sinn Fein has said it will agree to participate in the peace process only if Britain agrees to some changes in the formula . &quot; I don ' t advocate violence , &quot; Adams said Friday . &quot; It is my personal and political priority to see an end to the IRA and an end to all other organizations engaged in armed actions. &quot; He explained that he would agree to disband the IRA , but only after British troops are withdrawn from Northern_Ireland . On Sunday , the White_House described the statement as &quot; constructive. &quot; It added that Adams &quot; unreservedly condemned three bomb threats on Jan . 27 in San Diego reportedly claimed by the Southern California IRA. &quot; Although the_British government objects to giving Adams such a visible public forum in the United States , the Administration came under strong pressure from backers of the conference , sponsored by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy , to permit Adams to attend . Former Secretary_of_State Henry A . Kissinger is honorary chairman of the event . Several Irish American members of Congress , including Sens . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) , Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) , Christopher J . Dodd ( D-Conn. ) and John Kerry ( D-Mass. ) , urged the Administration to give Adams a visa in light of the progress toward peace in Northern_Ireland represented by the Major-Reynolds agreement . Supporters of Sinn Fein in Ireland and the United States were jubilant that Adams would be given a visa after having been turned_down eight times over the last 20 years . In New York , Martin Galvin , a spokesman for the_Irish Northern Aid Committee , which raises funds for IRA causes , said the policy of keeping Adams out of the United States &quot; was a damning admission that the_British feared an open debate in the United States about their rule_in ( Northern ) Ireland. &quot; Adams said Sunday that the purpose of his visit is to brief Irish supporters on the current peace moves and to learn the views of Irish Americans on the subject , Reuters news_agency reported from Dublin .</TEXT>
