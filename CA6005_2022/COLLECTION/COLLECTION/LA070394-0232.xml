   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 ; THIS CUP BRIMMING WITH TEARS ; SOCCER : TRAGEDY PLAYS A ROLE IN A TOURNAMENT THAT HAS OTHERWISE BEEN ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A player shot dead . A superstar caught for drugs . Violent death in the midst of victory dances . Fans flying to a game killed in a plane crash . The World Cup is brimming with tears . In its first U.S. appearance , soccer ' s world championship has been a spectacular success , with exciting matches , filled stadiums and a pulsating energy that has stayed under_control at the nine sites . But the world ' s most popular sport has a dark side , too , dramatically exposed by 12 gunshots in a parking_lot in the cocaine capital of Medellin , Colombia , early Saturday . The killing of Andres Escobar , who scored an own-goal in the 2-1 loss to the United States that eliminated Colombia from the tournament , was a reminder of the passion and attention soccer generates . &quot; The popularity of our game has two faces , &quot; said Sepp Blatter , general secretary of soccer ' s governing body , FIFA . &quot; The first face produces joy and enthusiasm and brings people together , as we have witnessed at the World Cup here . And on the other face , the game mirrors our life . It has violence , tears , corruption . Like life , it has all its problems. &quot; Blatter , who has been involved with the sport for decades , called Saturday &quot; the saddest day I have ever witnessed in football , in the World Cup or any other competition. &quot; It was the second time in three days that soccer and its fanatically followed championship suffered a shock off the field . On Thursday , Diego Maradona , the captivating but troubled star of Argentina , tested positive for using five banned stimulants and was kicked_out of the World Cup . Maradona was suspended for 15 months in 1991-92 for cocaine use . &quot; It ' s like somebody does not like the success of the World Cup , &quot; Blatter said . &quot; I don ' t know who to blame . But the two cases we have had in 48 hours -- it ' s hard to digest for us. &quot; The tournament itself has been blissful . Capacity crowds have enthusiastically but peacefully cheered games that have seen more scoring , the emergence of new stars and a surprisingly strong showing for the home team , with a second-round berth for the United States for the first time since 1930 . FIFA has cracked_down on on-field thuggery , handing_out stiff suspensions for players who go at each other too violently . That has sidelined some key players , such_as America ' s John Harkes , at important times , but it also has opened_up the game . There has been none of the hooliganism that sometimes springs_up around European club matches and had American organizers on_the_alert . But death has haunted this World Cup . Two weeks ago , 12 fans flying to Washington for Mexico ' s opener against Norway were killed when their private plane crashed . Highway crashes have killed at least two other soccer travelers . The Colombian team received a death threat against midfielder Gabriel Gomez before its game with the United States . Last week , riots broke_out in Mexico_City as fans celebrated their team ' s advancement to the second round . Three people were killed , including one who , witnesses said , was beaten unconscious and then blown apart by a firecracker placed next to his head . Those deaths , as tragic as they were , were different than the killing of Escobar , a quiet man and smooth player who , for the second time in a week , found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time . &quot; If something happens by accident , you can say it was the will of God , &quot; Blatter said . &quot; But when people deliberately shoot and kill somebody because he made a mistake in the game , something is wrong . &quot; We can promote the sprit of fair play . We promote comfort in the stadiums . We control the game and approve sanctions against corruption and cheating , like the Maradona case . But we are helpless , sad -- what can you say in such a situation ? &quot; Perhaps more_than any other sport , soccer has had to deal with tragedy . Blatter said it would handle this one , too . &quot; Football is strong enough to go_on , &quot; he said . &quot; The globe is the ball , and it keeps turning. &quot;</TEXT>
