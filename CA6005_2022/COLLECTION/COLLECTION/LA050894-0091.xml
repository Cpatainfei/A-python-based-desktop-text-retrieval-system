   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; INSIDE DOPE ON THE U.S. PLOT TO INFILTRATE FRENCH !</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The MacDonald ' s on the Champs Elysee was almost deserted at 3 a.m. as I sat browsing through a paper while waiting for my contact so we could start littering the place with People magazines and National Stars . It was then that the front-page Le Figaro article hit me like a Charlotte de Pommes Sauce Abricot in the face . &quot; The Government of France , &quot; it declared , &quot; is officially supporting efforts to prevent further infiltration and pollution of the_French language by imported English words and phrases. &quot; So it had happened . We ' d finally pushed them too far . Now there was sure to be -- Uh , oh ! Here came three of the_French Academy ' s roving black-robed word goons , heading straight for the restaurant ! Reflexively , I buried my telltale Anglo-Saxon face in the paper and scrunched down . Fool ! ! Why had I chosen a &quot; Mighty Ducks &quot; jersey to wear today ? Idiot ! No hope of covering it up with a Paris Review ! Whew ! ! Just another sweep to rip the Smashing Pumpkins concert and &quot; Cops and Robbersons &quot; movie posters off kiosks . Still , a close_call . Could I stand the torture if they found me out ? The round-the-clock pummeling of Piaf and Johnny Halliday over the P.A. ; the only reading matter de Beauvoir ' s letters to Sartre about Camus and Camus ' letters to de Beauvoir about Sartre and footnotes , footnotes , footnotes ; forced to see &quot; The 400 Blows , &quot; 500 times . How long before I ' d crack and our whole massive plot fall_apart like a used Renault ? Yes , we ' d drugged Depardieu with California_wines so he ' d do English-speaking movie roles . The EuroDisney caper cost a fortune , sure , but &quot; Have a nice day &quot; was now part of their language . They might even uncover our prized double_agent , Jerry Lewis , taking their praise and awards while swamping their lingo with half-wit English double_talk that the poor fools lapped_up like creme brule . Mon Dieu ! This campaign of ours to take_over French , word by word , ran all_the way back to the ' 20s and Gertie Stein ' s network of English-language moles disguised as expatriate writers and artists , boring away at their language from within . How long before they figured_out that all those Sorbonne &quot; exchange students &quot; were , in fact , our agents , planting Danielle Steele and Judith Krantz novels between the volumes of Voltaire and Zola in the library , getting their orders and their supplies from a certain back_room at Harry ' s Bar ? What were they going_to do now ? Make French travelers abroad wear earmuffs ? Change the name of Paris Match to Paris Mzprfz ? Seal_off the Channel_tunnel ? But regard the nondescript little man who ' d just entered the MacDonald ' s and sat_down at the next table , pretending not to notice me . A French_teacher ? Maybe they ' d already intercepted my contact and her armload of English-language publications . Too_bad . Nice kid . But she knew the risks . No time for sentiment . I had to go underground . I paid my bill and , steering clear of Avenues Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson , headed for the Metro. *</TEXT>
