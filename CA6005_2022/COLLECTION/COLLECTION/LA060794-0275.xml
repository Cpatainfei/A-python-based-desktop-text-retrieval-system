   <TEXT> Among the wonders of the Chinese capital is the warren of clothing stalls surrounding Beijing ' s Ritan Park that locals_call the Russian Clothing Market . The reason for the name is fairly straightforward : Most of the customers of the 1 # 300 market stalls selling bulk quantities of Chinese-made clothing are Russians . At one point last year , said Vasily Yefimov , a Moscow University graduate in economics who arranges tours and air-freight forwarding services for Russian clothing buyers , his company was running 50 charter flights and 20 cargo flights a month between Beijing and Russian cities . The Russians shop in Beijing because the quality of clothing made in China is vastly superior to that of Russian-made clothing . To meet the demand , many of the Chinese shopkeepers have learned to speak Russian . Many signs are in both Chinese characters and Russian Cyrillic script . Yang Lingquo , 44 , sold fruit in the market before the Russian trade began to grow explosively a_few years ago . When he saw how much money others were making selling brightly colored nylon jackets to Russians , Yang decided to jump into the rag trade , specializing in acrylic sweaters manufactured in Fujian province . Yang lives only a_few minutes ' walk from the market . He pays only $ 2 a month rent for a two-room apartment , which he shares with his wife and 14-year-old son . The apartment is subsidized by his work_unit , a wholesale drug_company that sells to hospitals and drugstores . Yang is supposed to work 44 hours a week at that job . The license for the stall is actually in his mother ' s name , and his three brothers and a sister take turns working in the stall . Yang likes doing business with the Russians but warns against trying to cheat them : &quot; The Russians ' intellectual / cultural level is much higher than that of the Chinese . One of every five Russians has a university education , whereas only one out of several hundred Chinese has one. &quot; Elisabeth Grinspoon , Special to The Times</TEXT>
