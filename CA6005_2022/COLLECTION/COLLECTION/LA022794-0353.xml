   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY COMPANIES KEEP BUSY TRACKING THE INFOMERCIAL EXPLOSION ; ADVERTISING : PUBLICATIONS BASED IN TUSTIN AND SANTA ANA ARE AMONG THOSE THAT RANK THE COMMERCIALS , OFFER THEIR OBSERVATIONS -- AND MAKE THEMSELVES INVALUABLE TO THOSE WHO CALL THE SHOTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From his easy_chair or the treadmill nearby , John Kogler watches half_a_dozen televisions at once , all showing infomercials from VCRs in fast-play mode -- and can spot changes from previous versions in any of those 30-minute commercials . He and his wife , Clare , also view new infomercials in so-called real time , the same half hour it takes anyone to watch them , and they put their observations in a weekly report dubbed the Green Sheet , because of the color of its hard-to-photocopy pages . The Koglers have a library of infomercials dating_back to 1984 , an invaluable resource that also helps their Tustin-based company , Jordan Whitney Inc. , in its consulting business . They know , for example , what helped Victoria Jackson sell nearly $ 200 million worth of makeup since 1989 . They know why Ron Popeil sells so many food dehydrators and pasta machines . They can surmise why Dolly Parton ' s first Revlon makeup infomercial , for which the singer-actress reportedly was paid $ 2 million , bombed . &quot; The Dolly Parton infomercial is beautiful looking , &quot; Clare Kogler said . &quot; But this is a sales tool , and that ' s what a lot of people don ' t understand . This is not general advertising . This is selling . It ' s getting people to walk over there and pick_up their phone and dial the number . If it doesn ' t do that , it doesn ' t matter how pretty it is. &quot; * The Koglers are part of a small coterie of publishers who spend their time dissecting infomercials , which are part of the boom in direct response television that also includes home shopping channels . Industry insiders pay_attention to what the Koglers and others , like Steven Dworman of Infomercial Marketing Report in Los Angeles , have to say . &quot; Each one of these people wields a lot of clout , &quot; said Greg Renker , chairman of Guthy-Renker Corp . His infomercial production company , based in Palm Desert , counts among its infomercial successes Principal Secret skin_care with Victoria Principal , Personal Power ! with self-improvement guru Anthony Robbins and Perfect Smile tooth whitener with TV celebrity Vanna White . &quot; What they print is very important , &quot; Renker said , &quot; because they are the disseminators of information in the industry. &quot; Jordan Whitney ' s Green Sheet , Dworman ' s newsletter , ResponseTV magazine in Santa Ana and Infomercial Monitoring Service outside Philadelphia have become indispensable reading for a Hollywood-type industry afraid to miss any tidbit of fact or scuttlebutt . The reason is simple : profits . The industry sold about $ 900 million in goods and services on television last year and drove six times that amount in_store sales . The cost of air time was about $ 400 million , according to industry estimates . TV sales are expected to top $ 1 billion this year and are projected to go_to $ 5 billion in a_few years , even though the cost of air time is soaring and cheaper radio time is beckoning advertisers . Infomercial hits also do_well on the shopping channels . Actress Victoria Principal sold $ 9 # 375 worth of her skin-care products for every minute of her four hours of appearances on QVC last summer . Ron Popeil sold 31 # 000 Ronco Food Dehydrators in less than 90 minutes on QVC last fall . The Home Shopping Network and QVC each sold a total of more_than $ 1 billion worth of goods and services last year . * What makes the profits in the infomercial industry even more amazing is that most of the program-length commercials fail miserably . The Koglers estimate that seven out of eight flop ; Renker puts it at 10 of 11 . The failures are a big reason why the trade publications have become gospel . &quot; These reports provide me with ammunition . And with production_costs averaging about $ 300 # 000 , I need all_the artillery I can get_in determining what to produce , &quot; Renker said . &quot; They don ' t help me make a good decision , but they help me avoid making bad ones. &quot; The publications are aimed at those who work or want to work in an industry many still liken to the snake-oil business . Indeed , they have helped to legitimize the industry by spotlighting shady practices and deceptive pitches . Lousy products , those in the trade say , not only give the industry a bad image but hurt retail sales . And the hottest segment of the infomercial world is the emergence of name brands seeking a new way to sell in_stores . &quot; Retail is such a big component because most people still won ' t buy from television , but they ' ll buy a product they saw on television from Costco , &quot; John Kogler said . For every Popeil Pasta Maker sold on television , six are sold in_stores . So retail_chains are looking_for products they can promote with the slogan , &quot; As seen on TV. &quot; &quot; Major marketers such_as Sears , Philips Electronics , Braun , Mattel , Revlon , Bank of America and others are utilizing the infomercial to demonstrate and explain features and benefits , &quot; Jack Schember wrote in his editor ' s column in ResponseTV , an easy-reading four-color magazine . His and the other publications essentially do research for the industry , and the industry pays dearly . The Green Sheet -- its real name is Direct Response Television Monitoring Report -- publishes both weekly and monthly and has 200 customers worldwide . The price : $ 13 # 000 a year for the weekly , $ 3 # 000 a year for the monthly . Overseas subscribers pay more . The monthly Infomercial Monitoring Service report , which charts infomercials shown only on cable stations and describes new programs with little editorializing , has about 100 customers paying $ 3 # 000 a year each . Dworman ' s monthly newsletter , a potpourri of news , rumors and insider moves , goes_to about 1 # 000 readers who pay $ 395 each annually . ResponseTV , which uses advertising to help cover production_costs , is the least expensive at $ 40 a year and goes_to 16 # 000 subscribers . * Many producers , media buyers and other industry executives subscribe_to all four . &quot; Do I enjoy reading these publications ? No . Do I need to read them ? Yes , &quot; said Lenny Lieberman , a producer based in San Francisco . &quot; There ' s a perception that things are moving so fast that you can ' t afford to miss anything that ' s written_about the industry. &quot; Whether all_the publications can survive is a &quot; hot_issue , &quot; said Helene Blake , executive_director of the National Infomercial Marketing Assn . in Washington . Her trade group puts_out a newsletter that just skirts competing directly with the publications , which are NIMA members . But she sees no waning of reader interest . &quot; There is such a thirst_for_knowledge about the industry , &quot; Blake said . &quot; All of these publications are widely read . If you don ' t read one , you might miss something. &quot; * All four publications operate_on small budgets -- the Koglers and Dworman from their homes . Their effort is a testament as much to the modern tools available to small business as_to the phenomenal growth of the infomercial industry . The Green Sheet , in fact , is the quintessential modern-day mom-and-pop business . The Koglers have been watching and taping infomercials ever since the program-length commercials first invaded households 10 years ago with their toll-free phone_numbers urging viewers to call and buy kitchen knives , diet aids and assorted other products not sold in_stores . John Kogler was a real_estate lawyer with a prominent firm , and Clare Kogler was a speech_therapist . When the couple ' s twins were born 12 years ago , Clare decided to stay home and start a direct marketing company , placing advertisements in small newspapers across the nation for a line of cosmetics . The Koglers called the company Jordan Whitney -- their middle names . In 1985 , a year after federal regulations on TV commercials were eased , John resigned from his law_firm and joined Clare in the venture full time . They wrote scripts and produced several infomercials ; when larger producers moved_in , the Koglers moved_on to consulting . By the end of the decade , they had a large stash of infomercial videotapes , and John was advising a friend in New York about the newest INs , as the Koglers call infomercials . The friend offered to pay_for a weekly handwritten report , and John began mailing copies to four customers in December , 1990 . Within a year , he was compiling the data by computer . The Koglers now have a network of aides who record shows nationwide , then ship the tapes to the Koglers ' home for review . The Green Sheet contains details of INs , the couple ' s opinions of them , plus newsy items gleaned from other publications and from conversations with people in the industry . It also ranks infomercials by the number of times they air , and the industry scans those numbers religiously . Without advertising , the Jordan Whitney report has grown to become perhaps the most respected of the four publications . &quot; It is really a Bible source for making a green-light decision on producing infomercials , &quot; Renker said . John Ripper , president of Tyee Productions in Portland , Ore. , subscribes_to all four publications but said that the Green Sheet is essential because it provides the most complete list of infomercials , evaluations of their strengths and weaknesses , and the rankings . &quot; I need to be current on the new shows and their success or failure , &quot; Ripper said . Publisher Dworman doesn ' t worry about rankings . He deals instead in the news he can generate from talks with producers , manufacturers , infomercial celebrities and others in the industry . A UCLA film school graduate , Dworman wrote scripts for some episodes of such TV_shows as &quot; Happy Days , &quot; but in the mid-1980s became fascinated with infomercials and direct response TV . &quot; In 1990 , I said there was such a lack of information about the industry that I was going_to start a newsletter , &quot; he said . His Infomercial Marketing Report is chatty and opinionated . &quot; Dworman usually has the inside scoop , &quot; Renker said . In the January issue , for instance , Dworman pointed_out that manufacturers and infomercial producers were making more deals with Home Shopping Network than with QVC because QVC had a backlog of products submitted for airing . &quot; In many cases , HSN is ordering more product than QVC and giving better guarantees or commitments , &quot; wrote Dworman , who works_out of his home on the westside of Los Angeles . &quot; It ' s obvious that HSN does not intend to live_in QVC ' s or anyone else ' s shadow. &quot; In contrast to Jordan Whitney and Dworman , ResponseTV is part of a large publishing_company called Advanstar Communications . The Irvine firm prints five dozen trade journals and started ResponseTV , which is based in Santa Ana , in mid-1992 . * Schember , the magazine ' s editor , has three staff writers and a number of contributors . Jordan Whitney supplies him with monthly rankings of the top 10 infomercials and top 10 spots -- short commercials that sell through a toll-free phone_number . The fourth widely circulated publication takes a different approach . Infomercial Monitoring Service avoids evaluations , gossip and other editorializing . From an office in Broomall , Pa. , west of Philadelphia , owner Sam Catanese and seven employees publish the report , which is billed as a scientific summary on infomercials running_on cable stations nationwide . &quot; We do real-time monitoring and taped verification , &quot; Catanese said . &quot; We ' re not editorializing , just providing the facts. &quot; Infomercial Monitoring Service tracks about 1 # 000 infomercials a week on 20 national cable stations and prints a TV Guide-like grid showing what infomercials aired during which time_slots on which channels . It also ranks the infomercials by the frequency of airings on cable channels . But by concentrating only on cable stations , producers and others say , Catanese is missing most of the shows -- about 70 % of all infomercials now air on broadcast stations . Catanese may soon get more exposure for his company . Electronic Retailing , a four-color monthly magazine set to debut in mid-April , is negotiating with him to use Infomercial Monitoring Service rankings , editor Kathy St . Louis said . * Electronic Retailing , based in Van Nuys , expects to cover advertising , marketing and retailing associated with TV_programs and the much-ballyhooed information superhighway . Its publisher and the others recognize that retail shopping is changing dramatically . Interactive television , for instance , could allow customers to order products they see as a camera pans through a shopping_mall . &quot; This whole shopping revolution coincides with some lifestyle and economic changes , &quot; John Kogler said . &quot; People are working harder , often both adults in a family . They don ' t have time to shop . Two , it ' s obviously not a pleasant experience anymore -- the clerks are less well-trained , the merchandise is not as available in the sizes and quantities . And three , it ' s not safe in many places anymore. &quot; The Infomercial Blitz Channel surfers find it increasingly hard to avoid exposure to advertising ' s popular infomercials . Here are some facts on the infomercial explosion : Broadcast , and They Will Buy Infomercial product sales have nearly tripled since 1988 . Gross sales in millions : 1993 : 900 ( Estimate ) Air Time Is Money Infomercials are a revenue boon to broadcast and cable channels alike .
