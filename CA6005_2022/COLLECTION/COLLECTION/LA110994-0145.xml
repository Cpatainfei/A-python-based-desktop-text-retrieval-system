   <TEXT> Personal_computers cannot sew T-shirts or manufacture coffee_mugs , at least not directly . But enterprising software developers have figured_out ways to enable you and your PC to create these and other items , thus adding a new dimension to holiday gift giving . Even if you want to stick_with more traditional gifts , you can still use your PC and printer to make greeting cards , holiday posters and banners . Gift Maker ( $ 45.95 ) from Maxis ( ( 800 ) 336-2947 ) is the most comprehensive program for creating personalized items . The software , which requires Windows , is essentially a simple graphics program that lets you combine clip art , text and borders against an outline of whatever gift you ' ve selected . Once you ' ve created the design , you send it in via modem or mail in a diskette , and the personalized gift arrives_at your home a_few days later . There are about 40 items to choose from , including an apron ( $ 15.95 ) , baseball_cap ( $ 11.95 ) , clock ( $ 19.95 ) , mug ( $ 19.95 ) and Christmas_tree ornament ( $ 9.95 ) . T-shirts start at $ 13.95. Though the program doesn ' t have any drawing tools , it does come_with lots of &quot; clip art &quot; images . And you can import graphics created by other programs , as well as scanned photos . My daughter Katherine used it to create a T-shirt with pictures of our pets . * Another company , T-Shirts Online ( ( 207 ) 865-3077 ) , allows you to use any PC or Macintosh graphics program to design your own shirts . You don ' t need any special software -- even Paintbrush , which comes_with Windows , will do -- and you can include photos , graphics or text from virtually any type of graphics program . Once you ' ve created a file , you can send it by modem ( ( 207 ) 865-1806 ) or mail a diskette . The shirts start at $ 14.90 , plus $ 3 shipping for every two shirts . William , my 8-year-old , loves the T-shirt he created : The photo he used had to be blown_up and looks a little grainy , but it ' s still quite nice . Greeting cards , banners and other decorations can be created with any graphics program , but Print_Shop Deluxe makes the task truly painless . When you start the program , you ' re given a choice of a greeting card , banner , sign or calendar . For a greeting card , the program prints out a single sheet you can fold into a card . The calendar can be personalized with birthdays , anniversaries and other events . The program comes_with hundreds of graphics images and lets you import others . A CD-ROM version for Windows ( $ 79.95 ) works with Photo CD images , prints labels and includes an address list manager . Print_Shop is very easy to use , but it ' s not as versatile as a general-purpose graphics or desktop_publishing program . Microsoft Publisher 2.0 , a desktop_publishing program for home and small businesses , includes a greeting card feature and can also be used to create brochures , flyers , newsletters , banners and just about any other type of publication . Visio Home from ShapeWare is a fine Windows drawing program and can be used to create greeting cards , calendars , family_trees , maps , garden plans and other illustrations . It comes_with pre-drawn shapes that you drag to any location in your document , and , like Print_Shop , it ' s able to create one-page greeting_cards you fold into shape . * If you don ' t have a color printer , you can print out your creations in black_and_white and supply some local kids with a box of crayons . Photos add a lot to these cards and gifts : If you don ' t have a scanner , find a local copy shop or service_bureau that will scan your photos . Even without graphics software , you can create surprisingly attractive signs and posters with your word-processing program . Nearly all Windows and Mac word-processing software lets you insert graphics files , and most -- including Word , WordPerfect , Ami Pro and Microsoft Works -- come_with a collection of graphics . ClarisWorks 3.0 ( $ 99 ) , the integrated program for Mac and Windows from Claris Corp . ( ( 800 ) 544-8554 ) , has built_in &quot; assistants &quot; that will automatically create certificates , calendars , flyers and other documents . Last year , I imported some graphics into Microsoft Word , created a one-page Christmas greeting , then used my fax modem to send it to colleagues the day before Christmas . It ' s nerdy , I know , but some people appreciated the thought . If you want a wider choice of pictures and drawings , you can purchase clip art from various companies . T / Maker offers a package called the Holiday Seasonings with images for Hanukkah , Christmas , Thanksgiving and New Year ' s ; Occasions and Celebrations also includes Fourth_of_July , birthdays , weddings , graduation and other holidays and events . * Paper Direct ( ( 800 ) 272-7377 ) offers high-quality greeting_cards you can imprint using a laser_printer or certain ink-jet printers . A box with 15 greeting cards and envelopes costs $ 18.95. The company also makes fancy paper and stock for bumper stickers , signs and all sorts of other creations . Many on-line services , computer bulletin_boards and the Internet also have stocks of graphics files for downloading via modem . Prodigy , for a fee , enables customers to send electronic greeting_cards to other Prodigy members . ( Jump &quot; Greeting. &quot; ) And Mac users with a hankering for Christmas lights and Hanukkah candles can try Christmas Lights ( $ 19.95 ) from Atticus Software ( ( 203 ) 348-6100 ) , which displays decorative lights on your screen while you work . Holiday music plays in the background , and , after a_few minutes of inactivity , a &quot; snow_blower &quot; screen_saver takes_over your screen . The music , thankfully , can be turned_off .
