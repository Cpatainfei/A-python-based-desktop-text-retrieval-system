   <HEADLINE> UNREST SPARKS MEXICAN STOCK UPHEAVAL ; BOLSA INDEX SUFFERS A SHARP DROP BEFORE REBOUNDING AT CLOSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Trading slips littered the floor of the Mexican stock_market at the close Wednesday as investors -- reacting to the peso ' s sharp drop and lingering uncertainty in the southern state of Chiapas -- drove the market index down as much as 10 % in heavy trading before recovering most of its losses . In a day of roller-coaster selling that clearly reflected the tense mood of Mexico as the army and police restored government control in Chiapas , the Bolsa ' s main IPC index lost 232 points by noon -- the steepest drop since the stock_market crash of 1987 -- before recovering to post an overall loss of 3.1 % at the end of trading . The falloff in the Bolsa occurred despite a hike in interest_rates by the central_bank designed to cushion a new assault on the peso . Analysts said the market drop was fueled by investor fears that the currency would be devalued again by the new administration of President Ernesto Zedillo . To counter those fears , a spokesman at Banco de Mexico ruled_out any new modifications of the exchange_rate policy . That helped pick the market off the floor in mid-day , analysts said . Meanwhile , the peso slumped to the new limits of the intervention band against the dollar . That band fell by 53 centavos , or more_than half a new peso , in Tuesday ' s devaluation . The dollar was trading late Wednesday in New York at 3.9820 pesos compared to less than 3.5 before Tuesday ' s surprise devaluation . Traders described the foreign_exchange market as crazy and horrible , and estimated some $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion in hard currency had fled the country . Bolsa analysts worried about the level of Mexico ' s foreign_exchange reserves . Some estimated the reserves have fallen to about $ 11 billion from more_than $ 17 billion when they were last announced by the government on Nov . 1 . Market sources said top central_bank officials who held conference_calls with worried investors outside Mexico told them the reserve levels continued to be in double_digits , but they gave no more precise numbers . &quot; The market has to analyze the new exchange_rate , &quot; declared Manuel Robleda , president of the Bolsa de Valores . &quot; I only hope it ' s in an orderly fashion , not like today ' s violent and exaggerated reaction. &quot; Especially hard-hit were Mexico ' s blue-chip corporations , which are likely to show large fourth-quarter losses on foreign_exchange transactions . Also undercut were many U.S. mutual_funds with holdings in Mexican equities , whose value dropped_by nearly 15 % . The impact of Mexico ' s financial turmoil spread to other markets in Latin_America , where analysts said there was panic selling by American fund managers . In heavy trading , Brazil ' s market , for example , lost more_than 6 % ; the_Argentine stock index was off by 5.7 % . But many investors and market_analysts expect the Bolsa to rally in coming days , as buyers search for bargains in a market that has been falling_for several months amid rising tension in Chiapas . Citing a &quot; climate of uncertainty &quot; nationwide , spawned by a renewed uprising on Monday by the Zapatista National Liberation Army and peasant supporters , Zedillo ' s government billed its decision on the peso as a move to steady the Mexican investment market . Bolsa analysts , however , said that Chiapas was not their only worry . One of the main concerns is how far they can trust the new Zedillo government after it stunned experts by abandoning a policy of exchange_rate stability and launched Mexico ' s first major devaluation in seven years . &quot; The initial response when you have such a major change in policy has to be very negative . People are caught off_guard and are in a state of shock , &quot; said Felix Boni , head of market research at Interacciones brokerage in Mexico . * CHIAPAS CONFLICT Civil disobedience marks new stage in conflict . A1 * U.S. MARKET REBOUNDS Stocks rallied , with the Dow gaining 34 points . D3 ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) A Year of Turmoil Mexico and its stock_market have been through a lot this year . The nation has undergone violent uprisings , political assassinations and a presidential election , all_of which have been reflected in the Bolsa .
