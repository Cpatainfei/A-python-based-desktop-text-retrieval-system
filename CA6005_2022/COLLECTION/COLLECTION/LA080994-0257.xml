   <HEADLINE> ' THE LEAN ' : IT ' S AN ANGRY WORLD OUT THERE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I can ' t remember exactly when I began to notice &quot; The Lean , &quot; but I remember the circumstances . A few years back , I was riding my bicycle along a two-lane road near my home_in Northern Virginia when a car whizzed by me , doing maybe 15 or 20 m.p.h. over the speed_limit . Not that this was an unusual situation . I ' ve been pedaling regularly for seven years , and I ' ve encountered speeders more or less constantly . But this guy was a little different . He was so blatant about it -- arrogant , even . He never eased his speed to pass me on that narrow road we momentarily shared . And he didn ' t yield an inch . He zoomed by me with only a foot or so to spare . Rattled , I watched him as he sped away . He was a young_man , late teens or early 20s , with a beefy frame , like a weightlifter or football_player . And I noticed that he was leaning toward the center of his car . His left_hand gripped the top of the steering_wheel , his right shoulder was slumped , and his hand rested either on a floor-mounted gearshift or the seat . But his head remained upright , as though he was being pulled to one side by a mysterious force , and he was straining to keep his equilibrium . It was a striking pose . It suggested assertiveness , overconfidence -- and arrogance . &quot; I ' m King of the Road , &quot; he projected . &quot; Don ' t mess with me. &quot; It made me feel very vulnerable on my flimsy , foot-powered machine , to have been nearly grazed by two tons of steel steered by the left arm of that young hulk . I have since noticed that The Lean seems to be very common among young_men . It doesn ' t matter whether they are alone , in pairs or accompanied by young_women . If they drive aggressively , they almost always display that posture . Where could such a pose have come from ? And what might it say about the nature of today ' s young_men ? During my own young manhood , in the early ' 60s , the standard pose behind the wheel was the opposite : right arm draped over the top of the steering_wheel , left elbow crooked out the window , and head and shoulders resting comfortably back against the seat . Some bold souls even drove with their left arms hanging down outside their cars . An unfortunate friend of mine , tooling around in an MG convertible , lost his left arm in just that position when he suddenly lost_control and slammed into a retaining wall . Perhaps it ' s just as well that the dangling-arm position has become passe . It ' s a minor but curious thing : Sometime in the recent past , the common posture of young_men behind the wheel changed . Yet I can ' t think_of a single triggering act . It ' s not , for instance , like 60 years ago , when Clark Gable , in the movie &quot; It Happened One Night , &quot; stripped off his shirt in front of Claudette Colbert and revealed his bare chest . All over America , women swooned and men began leaving their undershirts in their dresser drawers . Popular trends have occasionally emerged from memorable poses or actions by culture heroes : the early Marlon Brando ' s smoldering hulk ; James Dean ' s laconic lost soul ; Elvis Presley ' s dreamy-eyed , canted-lipped bumpkin ; Eddie Murphy ' s wide-grinned smart_aleck . In my youth , I was into sophistication , so I fixated for a time on the drop-dead stare leveled by Sean Connery ' s James Bond at prospective consorts . Results aren ' t paramount here ( good thing , too ) . Mannerisms are emulated because they mask our insecurities . They are perceived , instinctively , to be effective tools , either to attract women or to improve one ' s status in the social hierarchy . The Lean is different . It doesn ' t seem to have an overt cause . Rather , it appears to be a collective and spontaneous development -- an evolutionary one , perhaps , something that has bubbled_up from a deep place in our anthropological roots . Primitive behavioral reflexes tend to surface during emotional situations . Driving , for many young_men , is surely emotional . It represents a time of asserting masculinity , of gaining position in the pack . Driving is also pack behavior , although it is no longer confined to males . Women now occupy the roads roughly in_proportion_to their numbers . Yet I haven ' t seen women displaying The Lean . Neither does_it seem to exist among men older than 40 . It is also human nature to resent confinement , and we Americans have an especially low tolerance for situations in which our freedom of movement is restricted . The car_companies ' ad_agencies are very conscious of these drives , so to speak . Their commercials frequently promote the illusion of uncontrolled velocity . An Acura Integra is perched at the top of a roller_coaster . An announcer boasts of a Cadillac ' s ability to reach 150 miles an hour . A Chevrolet Camaro is shown in a slow-motion skid . A Lexus ad touts its ability to out-corner a BMW . But you almost never see a commercial where the car is in a real driving situation -- in other words , in traffic . They ' re always gliding alone on an empty , scenic highway , churning_up leaves and dust . But in the fine print , nasty reality must be acknowledged . The ads carry the common disclaimer : &quot; Professional driver on closed course . Do not attempt these maneuvers. &quot; The images don ' t represent the road . They are purchase-eliciting fantasies aimed at the gullible . Nevertheless , whenever young_men take these powerful machines into highway situations , where traffic flow is frequently restricted and mobility greatly depends_on the self-control and rationality of all motorists , the images from the ads linger in the subconscious . There is a constant temptation to test the limits of a situation -- to try to make a little headway at the expense and risk of others . Inevitably , someone makes a foolish mistake and pays the price , with dented metal , injured flesh or oblivion , while everyone else ' s mobility is interrupted . It ' s practically a daily occurrence on every major urban highway . But many of those who escape the worst of the consequences were playing the same game . Such situations elicit defensive postures , especially the display of aggressiveness . We all carry the genetic wiring of millions of years . It still works . Among young_men -- whether in today ' s generation raised on the artificial violence of culture and sports , or in ancient tribal life where mortal combat was practically a daily occurrence -- an aggressive posture is frequent requirement . Young drivers of my generation gave only a hint of the primal , contained in the vague message , &quot; I ' m cool. &quot; That laid-back driving posture was as much an expression of pleasure -- we were mostly just glad to be_on the road -- than anything else . Not The Lean . It ' s fear and anger , sculpting young_men who contribute bedlam to our highways . &quot; I don ' t care about you , &quot; it declares , &quot; or anything else in my path. &quot; It ' s a small but unnerving sign , a little societal backslide toward the disassociated , the inarticulate , the primitive . I ' ve gotten so I can spot The Lean a mile away . It ' s commonplace to me now . Several times , just in the past few days , fast-moving vehicles have brushed past my bicycle . The drivers were all_the same : right shoulder dropped , upper body tilted , head erect . I feel strangely smug as I watch these young_men tool on down the road , like I ' m an anthropologist whose theory has been validated . Others may rely_on scholarly studies , polls , or the latest blurbs from USA Today or People magazine to assess the mood and direction of modern life . I ' ll continue to use my observations collected from my two-wheeled perch . That silly , sour posture speaks volumes .</TEXT>
