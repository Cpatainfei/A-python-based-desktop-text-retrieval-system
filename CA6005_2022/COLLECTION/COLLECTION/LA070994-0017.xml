   <HEADLINE> TENSION RISES IN CAMBODIA OVER COUP PLOT ; ASIA : THE GOVERNMENT CLOSES A NEWSPAPER THAT SUGGESTED A CABINET MEMBER WAS INVOLVED . THE CAPITAL APPEARS QUIET BUT ON EDGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Cambodian government closed one of the nation ' s most popular newspapers Friday as tensions continued to swirl throughout the country in the aftermath of an unsuccessful coup . Phnom Penh appeared quiet but extremely edgy , with the streets deserted at night and a heavy army presence designed to prevent any military movements from the countryside into the city , capital residents said . The government said it foiled the coup attempt by about 200 soldiers who were intercepted on their way to Phnom Penh early Sunday . The coup leaders were identified as former Interior Minister Sin Song , who was placed under house_arrest , and Prince Norodom Chakrapong , who went_into exile in Malaysia after the intervention of his father , King Norodom Sihanouk . Since Sunday , the government has also arrested Gen . Sin Sen , a senior official of the Interior Ministry , and Tes Thoy , chief of the Police Protective Unit , for taking_part in the coup attempt . The plotters , who allegedly planned to appoint a new government and replace Sihanouk as head_of_state , reportedly also included a deputy defense minister and several army generals who were said to have taken refuge in Vietnam . Diplomats in Phnom Penh said it is now clear that the coup attempt had been mounted by hard-line elements of Cambodia ' s former Communist_Party , which ruled the country with backing from Vietnam from 1979 until U.N.-supervised elections in May , 1993 . Those elections were won by the royalist party headed by Prince Norodom Ranariddh , Sihanouk ' s older son , but the threat of civil_war forced him into a fragile coalition government with the defeated Communists led by Hun Sen . Diplomats said that , while the full extent of official involvement in the attempted coup was still murky , the putsch appeared to have had the unintended effect of improving the strained relationship between Ranariddh and Hun Sen , who govern Cambodia as first and second prime_ministers . Both men were relieved to see the hard-liners purged , they said . The costs of the latest instability also became apparent when Singapore Airlines announced it was abandoning plans to form a partnership with the Phnom Penh government to run a new state airline in Cambodia . Singapore Airlines had planned to take a 40 % stake in the new carrier , to be called Royal Air Cambodge . Other investors were reported to be putting plans for projects on hold , while aid donors also waited to see how the government crisis wound_up before honoring past pledges of assistance . The jitters in Phnom Penh worsened Friday when the government announced that the Cambodian-language Morning News , one of the nation ' s most popular newspapers , had been closed . Its editor , Nguon Nun , was being questioned by police over an article suggesting that Interior Minister Sar Kheng had been involved in the coup plot . Sar Kheng , who has been described as a rising political star , denied he was involved . The government also banned officials from speaking_to reporters about the investigation of the coup plot , in an effort to halt the rumors sweeping the city . Under the constitution adopted after last year ' s elections , Cambodia is supposed to have a free press . The tumult has also been intensified by a vitriolic debate in Parliament , which culminated Wednesday in the passage of a law outlawing the Maoist guerrillas known as the Khmer Rouge , whose rule_in the 1970s left more_than 1 million Cambodians dead . The ban on the Khmer Rouge was proposed by Hun Sen after the collapse last month of peace talks , brokered by Sihanouk , between the government and the Khmer Rouge . The Khmer Rouge , which refused to take_part in last year ' s elections , remains a potent force in Cambodia because of its military strength , and the ban will have no practical effect . Sihanouk , who is being treated for cancer in Beijing , vehemently opposed the Khmer Rouge ban , so the final bill adopted left the door open_to future negotiations with the group . The law includes a six-month amnesty during which group members can turn themselves in . Some members of the royalist party initially opposed the ban because they feared the law would be used to muzzle government opponents by accusing them of supporting the Khmer Rouge . But they later voted for the bill , averting a major division in the government only days after the coup attempt . Despite the ban , a number of Cambodia specialists said they expect the Khmer Rouge to play a waiting game to see if the instability in Phnom Penh will lead to so_much internal strife that the government can be pushed_aside with only minor effort . The government , meanwhile , has attempted to implicate neighboring Thailand in the coup plot , saying that nine Thai nationals , some in Thai military_uniforms , were arrested Sunday during the failed putsch . Relations with Thailand have deteriorated sharply in recent months after accusations that Thai officials continue to provide shelter and support for the Khmer Rouge ; Bangkok has become a bogyman of Cambodian propaganda . In turn , the Thais have tried to block proposals by the United States and Australia to provide military aid to the Cambodians to help fight the Khmer Rouge .</TEXT>
