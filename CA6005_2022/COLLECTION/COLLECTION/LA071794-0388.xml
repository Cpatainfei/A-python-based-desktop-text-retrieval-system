   <TEXT> As in all epochal battles , mythical or otherwise , there has to be a hero and there has to be a villain . But which is which ? that ' s the difficulty facing neutral observers of today ' s World Cup_final between Italy and Brazil at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena . For the first time in history , two three-time winners of the planet ' s most coveted sports trophy are squaring_off in the championship match . But which team should you support ? Do you take Italy , which won the World Cup in 1934 , 1938 and 1982 , because of its courage in the face of adversity ? Because Coach Arrigo Sacchi has managed to avert disaster time and again ? Because striker Roberto Baggio sports a ponytail and spouts Buddhism ? Or do you take Brazil , which won the World Cup in 1958 , 1962 and 1970 , because of its tradition of entertaining soccer ? Because Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has managed to get here unbeaten ? Because striker Bebeto has the most unusual post-goal celebration ? The contrasts between the opponents could not be more striking . This is not simply Baggio and friends against Romario and friends . This is the Old_World against the New . This is Europe against South_America . This is the Imperial world against the Colonial world . Rome or Rio ? Tiber or Amazon ? Vesuvius or Sugar_Loaf ? You make the choice . But here are some pointers to guide you . Brazil comes_into this afternoon ' s game having beaten Russia , Cameroon , the United States , the_Netherlands and Sweden . The only blot on its copy book is a first-round tie with Sweden . Italy comes_into the game having beaten Norway , Nigeria , Spain and Bulgaria . The question_marks on its record involve a loss to Ireland and a tie with Mexico . Brazil has scored 11 goals and allowed three . Italy has scored eight goals and allowed five . Italy has used 20 of its 22 players . Brazil has used 16 of its 22 . The Brazilians have never trailed in a game . The Italians have trailed twice , losing to the_Irish but coming_back to defeat the Nigerians in the final two minutes . If it wins , Brazil would go_through the tournament undefeated with one tie . If it wins , Italy would be the first_team to take_home the World Cup after losing a tournament game since Argentina in 1978 . The statistics can be read any way you please . Brazil has the better offense and the better defense . Italy has been through the fires , has been tested and has survived . Brazil has not been tested . Make of that what you will . Then there are the coaches . Tactically among the most astute and inflexible in the world , they both have mapped_out World Cup campaigns and stuck_to their plans , ignoring the sniping by the media and the clamor for change back home_in their respective countries . By tonight , one will wear a halo , the other a set of horns . Sacchi has chopped and changed the Italian lineup with an almost cavalier attitude , but he has not made change for change ' s sake . There have been thought and intention behind his moves . So far , they have all paid_off , although even he acknowledges having a little buona fortuna , but what coach does not need a bit of luck now and then ? It would have been good to see Giuseppe Signori given a chance as a forward , rather than having been tied_down in midfield , where he has clearly been less than effective . The player is a goal-scorer , let him score . But Sacchi has his own ideas . Parreira has had to do far less patching and repairing . He mended his defense early on and has pretty much stuck_with the same lineup , tinkering here and there with his midfield but still not getting_it quite right . Once left back Leonardo had been tossed_out of the tournament for that especially nasty foul on American midfielder Tab Ramos , Parreira was widely criticized for playing Branco in Leonardo ' s place and not the more exciting and adventurous Cafu . But Branco silenced the critics and vindicated Parreira ' s faith by scoring with an unstoppable , perfectly placed free_kick against the_Netherlands in the quarterfinals . Score one for the coach . It would have been good to have seen the 17-year-old Ronaldo given some playing time , if only that in World Cups to come the youngster can say , &quot; Yes , I played_on the 1994 team in the United States , &quot; but Parreira has resisted that temptation . There is a feeling that rather than being the exciting , wide-open final that everyone would like to see , today ' s match could bog_down into a dour struggle , with the victor the beneficiary of one defensive mistake or a single piece of offensive brilliance . A 1-0 result is not beyond the realm of possibility . Italy ' s defense has been weakened by injury and suspension , and it will have to have the midfield help_out . That will take_away from the Italian offense , especially if Baggio , who has a strained hamstring , misses the game . Brazil , despite the presence of Romario and Bebeto , struggled to score against the United States and Sweden , the latter twice proving a handful . The reason is the lack of imagination in the Brazlian midfield . Imagination is not something Parreira can have flown in overnight from Rio . What he can do , however , is look_to his bench . Alongside him sits Mario Zagalo , who played_on Brazil ' s World Cup-winning teams of 1958 and 1962 and coached the winning team of 1970 . Zagalo knows very well the meaning of jogo bonito , the &quot; beautiful game. &quot; Parreira can also consult his memory . He was the physiotherapist for the 1970 team . In his heart , he knows the way Brazilians like to play . But in his mind , will he let them do so , even if it means risking defeat ? It ' s very unlikely . As long as the result is more important than the performance , entertainment always will take second place . Up in the press area , one man will be watching with particular interest . He ' s a television commentator , but he would much rather be down on the field . His name is Pele . In his epochal battles of yesteryear , none of them mythical , it was always easy to tell the heroes from the villains . The heroes always wore green and gold . Today , it ' s not that simple . They might be wearing blue .</TEXT>
