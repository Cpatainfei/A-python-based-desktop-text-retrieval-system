   <HEADLINE> U.S. , N . KOREA REPORTEDLY REACH DRAFT ACCORD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States and North_Korea reached a draft agreement to ease months of tension over the North ' s nuclear program , the chief U.S. negotiator said late Monday . Robert L . Gallucci said that the draft will be sent to Washington and to Pyongyang for approval and that negotiators hope to sign the document in Geneva on Friday . He declined to give details of the accord , but said it was &quot; broadly acceptable and positive &quot; for the United States and North_Korea ' s neighbors , including South_Korea and Japan . It also addressed concerns about North_Korea ' s past nuclear program , he said . The Times had reported Saturday that the Clinton_Administration was preparing to conclude a far-reaching new agreement with Pyongyang . The United States and others fear North_Korea has already made at least one atomic_bomb , although North_Korea insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only . The agreement builds_on one reached in August in which North_Korea offered to open_up its nuclear facilities to international inspection and scrap its outdated atomic_energy program . That program uses old-fashioned technology that produces more bomb-making plutonium than modern reactors . In return , Washington offered low-level diplomatic ties and help in building safer nuclear_power plants . Since then , little progress has been made . Some speculated that a power vacuum in North_Korea following the death of Kim Il Sung made_it impossible for negotiators in Geneva to act with authority . Kim Jong Il , the late leader ' s son , appeared in public Sunday for the first time since his father ' s funeral in July , signaling that he has taken power . However , he has not formally assumed the positions of president and Communist_Party leader . The breakthrough in the talks apparently came as a result of telephone negotiations and the exchange of faxed texts of the final document between the two sides Monday evening . Gallucci said the accord tackled the issue of international inspection of two sites near Pyongyang where the United Nations ' watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency says there could be evidence of a North_Korean nuclear_weapons program . In Beijing , Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian told U.S. Defense_Secretary William J . Perry on Monday that China , North_Korea ' s main ally , would try to help end the impasse . A senior U.S. official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said China did not want North_Korea to have nuclear_weapons .</TEXT>
