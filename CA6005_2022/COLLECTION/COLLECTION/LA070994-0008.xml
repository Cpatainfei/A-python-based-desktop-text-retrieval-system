   <HEADLINE> KIM IL SUNG , N . KOREA ' S LONGTIME LEADER , DIES ; ASIA : DEATH OF COMMUNIST DICTATOR AT 82 COMES WEEKS BEFORE NORTH-SOUTH MEETING . EXPERTS EXPECT INSTABILITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kim Il Sung , the Communist dictator who ruled North_Korea for more_than four decades and pushed the isolated regime to the brink of nuclear confrontation with the world , died of a heart_attack Friday at age 82 , Radio Pyongyang reported today . Kim , the world ' s longest-ruling Communist leader and the object of a slavish personality cult , collapsed Thursday just a_few weeks before a historic meeting with South_Korean President Kim Young Sam aimed at_easing the mounting nuclear tensions . Pyongyang ' s suspected development of nuclear_weapons had raised an international outcry , leading to threats of economic sanctions and even some predictions of war . Kim Il Sung , however , recently met with former President Jimmy_Carter and expressed a desire to suspend the nation ' s nuclear program and open ties with the United States . As a result , the United States and North_Korea had begun a third round of high-level talks in Geneva on Friday . Kim ' s sudden_death , however , throws the outlook into confusion and sets_off the Korean_peninsula ' s gravest crisis since the 1950 Korean_War . Kim Young Sam received the news a little after noon today . He immediately summoned his defense minister and ordered him to &quot; prepare_for all contingencies. &quot; The armed forces have been put_on alert , South_Korean television reported . Kim was to shortly convene an emergency Cabinet meeting , it said . In Washington , a spokesman said the White_House was aware of the report and was attempting to get more details . Residents of North_Korea ' s capital wept hysterically after hearing the news , a Beijing-based reporter accredited to Pyongyang said today . &quot; There is mass shock and hysteria , &quot; said Krzysztof Darewicz , a correspondent for the Polish news_agency PAP . &quot; In our embassy the gardeners and translators just sit and cry . People who tried to go shopping said they could not because shop_assistants do nothing but cry. &quot; Darewicz said he had been in contact with his sources in Pyongyang by telephone . Kim Il Sung will be succeeded by his son , Kim Jong Il , whom analysts regard_as more dangerous and unpredictable than his father . Kim Jong Il , a reclusive figure who lacks his father ' s stature and genuine adoration by the people , is suspected of employing kidnaping , terrorism and guerrilla warfare to achieve his ends . He is said to have masterminded a 1983 bombing in Burma , now Myanmar , that killed 17 South_Korean officials and the 1987 midair bombing of a South_Korean airliner that killed all 115 people aboard . Analysts believe a Kim Jong Il regime , failing to command loyalty , may be vulnerable to a coup . As a result , some say the senior Kim wanted to hand_over a nuclear arsenal to his son to ensure the younger Kim ' s continued rule_in the Communist world ' s only dynastic succession . Kim Il Sung was lionized as a demigod and great guerrilla leader who liberated North_Korea from the clutches of Japanese colonialism . The Institute of North_Korean Studies in Seoul said , however , that he actually had a &quot; paltry record of guerrilla combat &quot; and was plucked out of the then-Soviet army to run the newly won territory after World_War_II . But under an extravagant personality cult , Kim was deified as having almost single-handedly driven_out the Japanese ; his image is memorialized in statues , posters , books , comics and lapel pins throughout the country . North_Korean propagandists under Kim referred to their country as a paradise , and visitors reported that Kim ' s people showed signs of respect toward the man they called the Great Leader . Yet Kim ' s more_than four decades as leader of the Communist northern half of Korea were marked by repression at_home and constant military_action against Western-aligned South_Korea . Although Kim was seen in the West as a destabilizing influence in world affairs , and in Beijing and Moscow as a problem ally , he was admired in parts of the Third_World for providing his people with a high standard_of_living . He championed the ideology of juche , or self-reliance . In recent years , however , crop_failures and demands by Russia and China that Pyongyang begin paying_for goods in hard currency have pushed North_Korea to the brink of economic collapse . There have been widespread reports of severe food shortages , growing public unrest and an increasing number of defectors to China and elsewhere . Korea , a Japanese colony from 1910 until 1945 , was divided into Soviet and American zones after World_War_II . Kim attracted the world ' s attention on June 25 , 1950 , when he sent his troops across the military demarcation_line in an attempt to unify the Korean_peninsula by force . His forces scored important early victories , but within days of the attack a United Nations force under American command entered the war on the side of the U.S.-backed Republic_of_Korea . By October , Kim was a refugee in China . After almost a_million Chinese troops joined the fighting and pushed_back the U.N. forces , Kim was reinstated in Pyongyang . After the war , which failed to move the boundary_line either north or south , Kim survived a challenge to his rule by purging his government of Communists who had come from South_Korea , saying they had spied for the United States during the war and that they were plotting to overthrow the government . Five years later , Kim showed his independence by ridding his Korean Workers Party of pro-China Communists . Kim ' s invasion of the South was just one example of the aggressive foreign_policy he followed with only minor interruptions until his death . In 1968 , the North_Korean navy captured the U.S. electronic_surveillance ship Pueblo and made prisoners of its crew . The following year , a North_Korean assassination team made_it to within yards of the residence of South_Korean President Park Chung Hee . In 1976 , North_Korean border guards hacked to death two U.S. officers in the demilitarized zone between North and South . Support of Third_World governments , especially those opposed to the United States , was a cornerstone of Kim ' s foreign_policy . Kim ' s men trained Palestinian guerrillas ; his pilots are reported to have flown missions for the Libyan air_force . At one time , Kim exchanged weapons for oil with Iran and enjoyed good relations with the Sandinista government of Nicaragua . Kim ' s early life is a mystery , and because of the heavy rewriting of history under his rule , it may never be fully known . According to North_Korean propagandists , Kim led a large rebel force in the 1930s and fought 10 # 000 battles against the Japanese -- 4 # 774 of them in the year 1936 -- never lost a skirmish and entered Pyongyang as a marshal at the head of his army of liberation . The only information historians outside North_Korea are sure of is that Kim was born near Pyongyang as Kim Song Ju on April 15 , 1912 , into a family of farmers and teachers . Kim emigrated with his father to North China , where he attended a Chinese school . There is evidence suggesting that Kim led a small unit of about 200 Korean guerrillas but this apparently was attached_to the Chinese Communist_Party . It is not known whether there were any separate Korean groups fighting against Japanese rule either in Korea or in the Japanese-occupied regions of China . Kim is known to have been involved in just one battle , an attack on a Japanese police_station in which seven Japanese were killed . It is not clear when Kim adopted the nom_de_guerre Kim Il Sung , but records indicate that there were no fewer than four guerrilla leaders with that name active in northern China . By 1941 , the Japanese army was in firm control of the region , and Kim fled to the Soviet_Union with a group of about 120 others . Kim is known to have attended a Soviet military_academy during World_War_II . When he returned to Korea at the end of the war , he was a Soviet citizen and a captain in the Soviet army . He was installed by Soviet troops to head what Moscow hoped would be a satellite state , but he learned to exploit the strategic position of his country , as well as the later Sino-Soviet split . Thus he obtained aid from both China and the Soviet_Union without falling completely into the orbit of either .</TEXT>
