   <HEADLINE> WHAT DOES THE FUHRMAN CONTROVERSY TELL US ABOUT THE LAPD ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How is it possible for a police_officer who is , by his own statements , prejudiced toward minorities , and who may have lied_in a failed attempt to win a disability pension , rise_up through the ranks of the Los Angeles Police_Department to become a respected homicide detective ? That is the question raised by the controversy surrounding Det . Mark Fuhrman , one of the LAPD ' s elite homicide investigators who responded to the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman . O.J. Simpson ' s defense_team has accused Fuhrman of racism , even suggesting that the detective may have planted a bloody glove he found at the former football hero ' s Brentwood mansion . Fuhrman ' s alleged racism stems , in part , from his attempt to win a stress-based disability pension a dozen years ago . Some of his statements to examining physicians reflected deep-seated racial bias . The detective further indicated that he believed himself incapable of controlling his emotions and feared that he might commit some irrational act_as an officer . A physician retained by the city ' s pension board concluded that Fuhrman was faking his disabilities , and his stress claim was denied . Fuhrman sued . As a consequence , his statements and the resulting doctor ' s reports , normally confidential , became public record . Whether or not the charges against Fuhrman are true , the broader question is institutional : Does the LAPD tolerate , even condone , prejudicial attitudes as just part of the job of being an officer ? When deciding promotions , does management consider such information as might be contained in a stress-disability application ? If an officer files for a disability pension and is denied , should he or she be returned to full duty as if nothing had ever happened ? The simplest , and possibly the most accurate , answer to a case like Fuhrman ' s is that the department ' s command staff is unaware of the file contents of officer disability claims and , accordingly , of any troublesome problems they may hint at . A quick look_at the pension-application process helps to explain why . Any officer who claims a duty-connected injury or illness files an application for a disability pension with the City Department of Pensions . The department , not having an investigative capability , asks the LAPD to supply the facts of the incident that led to the claim . The officer is examined by physicians to establish and report on the degree and character of the reputed disability . All the gathered information is confidential until a public hearing is held before the Board of Pension Commissioners . The officer ' s file becomes public when the board accepts it as evidence . When the hearing is concluded , the file is closed and its contents protected by law . None of these procedures automatically bars police managers from learning about any officer ' s disability claim . Yet , they routinely don ' t look_into such cases . As a result , valuable information is lost , particularly in the case of officers whose pensions are denied and who return to work still believing they are disabled . There is another , far more disturbing answer to how an officer can be racially prejudicial and still promotable . LAPD management is aware of attitudes like Fuhrman expressed but looks the other way . It is just locker-room talk . As long as such attitudes do not affect conduct , they may be offensive to some but are essentially harmless . Two examples drawn from recent LAPD history provide some clues . * One-on-one conversations with a broad sample of current LAPD officers . They reveal a widely held perception that prejudice , racial and otherwise , affects the actions of many officers and that such prejudice is tolerated by the organization . A departmental survey conducted in the aftermath of the Christopher Commission recommendations confirmed this conclusion . And , as might be expected , cops who are Latino , African American , female , gay or lesbian express much stronger views on what they see as institutional acceptance of prejudice . Many have filed discrimination suits against the LAPD . * The survival , for nearly a decade , of the loosely organized &quot; Men Against Women , &quot; known as MAW , in West Los Angeles precincts . A former command officer in West L.A. has described the group as a semi-serious protest against reputed preferential treatment given women and minority officers in hiring , assignment and promotion decisions . Only recently have efforts to curtail the group ' s activities been successful . A final possibility that cannot be discounted is that officers who lose a disability bid make a U-turn in thinking and accept the proposition that if you cannot get_out , you ' d better get_along . To the extent that these kinds of reversals occur , they do so in spite of management . What can be done to ensure that the LAPD ' s culture is not accepting of prejudicial attitudes ? First , the LAPD must engage in candid introspection . More_than anecdotes should be collected ; the results of reports routinely ignored , including pension files and summaries of litigation against the department and individual officers , should be thrown into the mix . Department management must_not arbitrarily dismiss responses that clash with their image of the organization . Second , departmental management must , by act and word , convey its serious intention to eradicate internal prejudice . Promulgating orders and providing mechanisms to address the problem are only steps toward creating the necessary leadership . Allowing underground movements such_as Men Against Women to survive communicates far more about official attitudes than all_the regulations aimed at stopping them . Third , management must ensure through intensive education that officers understand their obligations , to their colleagues and to the public , to cleanse the work place of prejudice . This effort must include progress_reports . Finally , employees who cannot overcome their prejudice must be encouraged to seek other employment or retirement . They owe that to their fellow employees and to the community they serve .</TEXT>
