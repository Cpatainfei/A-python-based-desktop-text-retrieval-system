   <HEADLINE> WHERE FIELDS OF DREAMS ARE NIGHTMARES ; MIDWEST : FLOODS LEFT FARMLAND BURIED IN SAND . REMOVING IT IS GIANT TASK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last summer ' s epic floods may have seemed like a Midwestern replay of the tale of Noah ' s Ark . But this spring , farmers along the Missouri_River ' s banks feel as though they ' re wandering the desert . In what was once a cornfield , then a lake , Maurice Glosemeyer now trudges , sinking with each step , across dunes piled as high as eight feet tall . His tracks fade quickly as a cold west_wind scatters the sand . Grit crunches between his teeth and stings his eyes . Ninety of the 123 acres in this field are covered with former Missouri riverbed , courtesy of the Pinckney Bottom levee break_in July and a second flood_in October . Both times , when the waters receded , the sand stayed behind , sealing_off the fertile loam beneath . The scene is repeated again and again throughout the Flood Belt , from Orrick , Mo. , near Kansas City , to Columbia , Ill. , southeast of St . Louis . &quot; It ' s another disaster , for_sure , &quot; said Steve Young , a biologist working for the U.S. Soil_Conservation Service in Missouri , the most damaged state . The river that snakes across its namesake state flowed faster and more furiously than the Mississippi during the prodigious rains ; its steep bottom was more thoroughly scoured . Now 60 % of its flood plain -- some 373 # 500 acres -- lies swathed in sand . * Pockets of Illinois and Iowa also resemble the Mojave , with sycamores and cottonwoods rather than cacti dotting the distant oases . But far less territory has been destroyed there . Four Illinois counties so far have reported 12 # 000 sandy acres . Iowa has yet to tally its deposits , scattered mostly along the Des Moines , Skunk and Raccoon rivers . &quot; I don ' t know what they will do_in Missouri , because we ' re having a devil of a time just with ours , &quot; said Lisa Manning , a federal program specialist based in Springfield , Ill. , with the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service . Near Peers , about 60 miles west of St . Louis , Glosemeyer has spent the last two weeks trying to level out his land . He drives the bulldozer . His wife , Jayne , operates a tractor , for the first time in 24 years of marriage to a farmer , pulling an earth scoop behind . She ' s gotten_it stuck more_than once . They hope that eventually they can spread the sand out enough to mix it into the soil . They aren ' t sure , though , whether the field will ever come_back . &quot; I ' m going_to try and plant in beans here , &quot; said Glosemeyer , a third-generation grower . &quot; They ' ll sprout . But I ' m afraid that when they ' re just a_few inches tall , the wind ' ll blow and they ' ll just shear right off. &quot; * To the east , Merlin Kopmann waves from a tractor , where he is duplicating the Glosemeyers ' efforts on_his_own sandy stretch . To the west , another neighbor farms 156 acres . Every square_inch of it is covered with sand . &quot; It ' s the same all up and down the river , &quot; Glosemeyer said . Having latched onto a part-time federal job measuring the destruction in his county , he should know . The largest dune he ' s found so far rises 12 feet high . Hauling the sand away is not an option . Even with federal soil rehabilitation subsidies , it ' s less expensive to go_out and buy a new farm . Besides , &quot; there ' s no place to take it , &quot; Manning said . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers used some sand for levee repair , but not nearly enough to make a dent in the supply . &quot; Landfills don ' t want it . Concrete plants can only use so_much , and there ' s so_much wood and debris in the sand , they don ' t want to pick it out. &quot; Time is a factor , too . Back in 1986 , a flood dumped sand all_over Leroy Preussner ' s farm nearby , though the quantities were nothing like this year . Preussner found an asphalt company willing to haul it away , and even pay 25 cents a ton for the stuff . Eight years later , the trucks are still coming_to Preussner ' s . The job is still not done . Sand will hold neither water nor nutrients long enough to fuel crops ' growth . So even mixing it into the underlying soil could be problematic . That tactic is expensive as well . Brent Cook , a Columbia , Mo. , livestock farmer decided in the floods ' wake to start a deep-plowing business with his brother and father . He is charging his first client $ 150 an acre . But he expects his price to go_up to $ 200 as he gains experience . ( Farmland costs about $ 1 # 200 an acre in these parts. ) Most plowing penetrates just a_few inches of dirt . Cook has been able to turn_over as much as 40 inches of soil with a cylindrical 52-inch disc . &quot; It ' s a monumental task , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s something that you learn as you go. &quot; From 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. , he braves the spring windstorms that send the sand swirling , biting into his skin and sometimes reducing visibility to fewer than 50 yards . Because flood moisture is still trapped under the sand , he occasionally dips_into a patch of what the locals_call &quot; blue muck. &quot; Then he has to stop to extricate his equipment . * The sand ' s abrasiveness , he estimates , will cut the life of his $ 30 # 000 disc in half . After 400 acres , he figures , he ' ll have to replace it . He got a special tractor with extra-tough tires . Regular ones , he said , would just get eaten_up . Given the obstacles , federal soil scientist Kenneth Vogt said , it might be a better idea to plant cottonwood and plan to harvest pulp in a decade or so , or perhaps think_about installing a constant irrigation system . But Vogt ' s No . 1 recommendation , especially if the sand is more_than six inches deep : &quot; Abandon it. &quot; Even the government ' s program to buy_out some flood plains farmers won ' t accept these fields . The purchased tracts must be set_aside as wetlands , and as Glosemeyer says , &quot; Sand don ' t qualify because it ain ' t wet. &quot; Owning wasteland is not an easy notion to accept . Glosemeyer , a bearded 45-year-old with a prominent nose and two missing bottom teeth , has already built a life once . He is proud_of his progress over the years . As a newlywed , he lived_in a faded green trailer near the family hog pen . A quarter of a mile down the road is his current quarters , the neat brick house he built for himself , his wife and his children , ages 8 to 21 . The family ' s home place , as he calls it , has grown from a 60-acre farm to a 350-acre spread , along with another 300 acres that he rents . * &quot; We were debt-free once , for a month , about three years ago , &quot; he said , laughing , behind the wheel of a truck . &quot; Then we bought more land. &quot; With the sandy fields likely out of production , with the new tractor , scoop and dozer leased , the whole farm operation will technically break_even this year . That means no income for the family , with two kids in college and another getting ready to start . &quot; I ' m personally worried about making_it , &quot; said Jayne Glosemeyer quietly , huddling by the tractor . The wind whipped_through her blonde-gray curls and she crossed her arms across her chest . &quot; When you first started_out , you didn ' t have to worry about your children , whether you ' ll leave them with debt or with something they can start_out with. &quot; Soon after the Missouri pushed a hole through the levee about two miles away from their farm , the Glosemeyers knew they had a lot more_than a flood on their hands . Surveying their property by boat , they kept dipping oars into the water only to bring_up a paddle full of sand . The autumn flood left another deposit , raising the dunes . When the river returned to its banks , that first walk they took together over the sand was a quiet one . There was not much to say . At one point , Jayne figured they ought to at least get some fun out of their strange land . She brought a bunch of the kids over . Her 19-year-old and a friend played_around with a_couple_of all-terrain vehicles . Jayne and the others had buckets and shovels and proceeded to attempt to build a castle . &quot; We ' d never been to the beach before , &quot; she said , &quot; so we weren ' t sure what to do. &quot; Even now , she takes an odd sort of pleasure in the exotic landscape . Bits of glass glisten , the tops of rotted corn stalks peek out_in straight_lines -- they would have been plowed under months ago in other circumstances . Air_currents dust the surface , arranging the fine grains into long undulating ripples . &quot; It ' s beautiful , &quot; she said . &quot; It just doesn ' t belong here. &quot;</TEXT>
