   <TEXT> Lasting memories of the XVII Winter_Olympics , Lillehammer ' 94 : -- Wall-to-wall people on Storgata , making Lillehammer ' s little snow-covered Main_Street look_like Bourbon Street in New Orleans on Fat_Tuesday . -- The absurdity of 250 reporters sitting in an auditorium at 1 in the morning , listening to Mike Moran and Harvey Schiller of the U.S. Olympic Committee reading the news releases reporters had just been handed on Tonya Harding ' s being allowed to skate in the Games . -- The anguished look_on world record-holder Dan Jansen ' s face after a slip_in the 500-meter race , his speedskating specialty , had cost him , once again , an Olympic medal . -- That lung-searing first breath when you step outdoors on a deceptively sunny winter morning . -- The absurdity of hundreds of reporters , photographers and TV crews waiting to catch_a_glimpse of Tonya Harding after her arrival in Hamar . -- Bonnie Blair , joyfully singing along to the national_anthem on the winner ' s podium . -- The room-filling aroma of strong , hearty Norwegian coffee brewing . -- All those moose-crossing signs , and not one moose sighted . -- The realization that there are 7 # 353 ways of preparing salmon -- and that Norwegians know every one of them . -- The humbling view of the ruggedly handsome Norwegian countryside . -- The touching sight of aerial skier Nikki Stone , who had just missed qualifying for the finals herself , hugging and comforting a weeping Kristean Porter , who had messed_up her chance by landing on her face . -- Thousands of happy Norwegians -- waving flags , singing , cheering , trying to run with the skiers -- at race after race at the cross-country stadium . -- The absurdity of Tonya Harding ' s coach telling 500 or more reporters at a news_conference that only questions deemed appropriate by her would be answered . -- Jere Longman of the New York Times promptly asking Harding , why , since she had lied to reporters about smoking cigarettes and to the FBI about her knowledge of the attack on Nancy Kerrigan , anyone should believe anything she said . -- The look of relief on Dan Jansen ' s face as he skated a victory lap , carrying his baby daughter , after finally winning his Olympic gold in the 1 # 000 meters . -- The unique hockey rink in the mountain at Gjovik . There is more , of course , much more , but . . . So , adjo Olympics . Adjo Lillehammer . Adjo Norway . Thanks for inviting us . MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
