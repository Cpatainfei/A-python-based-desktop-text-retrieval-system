   <HEADLINE> NEW ' BEETLE ' MAY BE BUILT FOR AMERICAS ; AUTOS : VOLKSWAGEN MAY LAUNCH AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE POPULAR BUG TO BE SOLD IN THE WESTERN_HEMISPHERE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new generation Volkswagen Beetle is moving closer to a return to the U.S. market , where it could re-establish the auto_maker ' s reputation for building cheap , spunky transportation , analysts said Friday . Volkswagen ' s supervisory board met Friday and may have approved the program , which calls_for the all-new front wheel-drive vehicle to be built_in Mexico for_sale in the United States , Canada , Mexico and possibly elsewhere in Latin_America . Volkswagen did not issue a statement about the car following the conclusion of the meeting . VW officials in the United States were not available for comment . The Wall_Street Journal reported Friday that board approval of the car was expected at the meeting . In the United Sates , the new Beetle is expected to sell for $ 12 # 000 to $ 13 # 000 and compete in the heart of the subcompact market with cars such_as Chrysler Corp. ' s Neon , Ford Motor Co. ' s Escort and Honda Motor Co . Ltd. ' s Civic . Based on VW ' s Concept 1 car displayed at major auto shows last year , the new Beetle will cram new technology such_as dual air_bags into the classic bug shape remembered fondly by millions of drivers . Unlike yesterday ' s air-cooled engine mounted over the rear-drive wheels , the new Bug will have a water-cooled engine mounted in front . The target market will be children of Baby_Boomers who drove the original Beetle in the 1960s and ' 70s . &quot; We were expecting approval of the program , &quot; said Chris Cedergren , an analyst with AutoPacific Group , a California-based automotive consulting_firm . &quot; Total annual production for this car could go_to 300 # 000 units a year , and it ' s earmarked more for the Americas as opposed to the European market. &quot; VW still builds the current generation Beetle , first introduced in the late 1930s , in Mexico and Brazil . But safety and emissions regulations forced VW to withdraw it from the U.S. market in 1974 . Cedergren said VW wants to sell about 75 # 000 to 100 # 000 new generation Beetles in the United States . The total could eclipse VW ' s total U.S. sales , which came_to 84 # 468 vehicles for the first 10 months of 1994 . While VW ' s sales this year have improved dramatically because of the long-awaited introduction of the new Golf and Jetta models , they are still way below the company ' s late 1960s ' U.S. heyday , when sales exceeded 200 # 000 vehicles a year .</TEXT>
