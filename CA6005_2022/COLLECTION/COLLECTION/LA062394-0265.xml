   <TEXT> Junk_Bond Sale : Orange County home builder Presley Cos . is expected to go_to Wall_Street this week to sell $ 200 million in junk_bonds through underwriter Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in New York . The bonds were rated single-B-minus by Standard &amp; Poor ' s Corp. , the New York rating firm . Proceeds from the offering will be used to retire high-interest-rate debt as part of the company ' s capital restructuring plan . Presley , based in Newport Beach , builds homes_in California , New Mexico and Arizona , though most of its business is in Southern California . &quot; The recently completed quasi-reorganization in combination with this new financing should well position Presley to benefit from a gradually improving Southern California economy , &quot; S &amp; P said in its report , but it also noted that the builder remains highly leveraged , with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of nearly 70 % .</TEXT>
