   <HEADLINE> BLOOD IS APPARENTLY FOUND IN STORAGE SITE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Investigators in the Denise Huber murder case have found what appears to be blood in an Orange County storage facility rented by suspected killer John J . Famalaro , and authorities believe the former Northridge woman may have been slain there , law_enforcement sources said Thursday . Authorities were testing the substance to see if it indeed is blood , and to determine if it matches Huber ' s , the sources said . In Arizona , the Yavapai County Grand_Jury indicted Famalaro on first-degree murder and theft charges Thursday , making him eligible for the death_penalty . He was arrested July 13 after Huber ' s body was found in a freezer at Famalaro ' s Arizona country_club home . The probe picked_up pace in Orange County , where law_enforcement sources and the manager of the Laguna Hills storage facility confirmed they have found what appeared to be evidence of bloodstains in the storage facility . Huber , 23 -- whose family moved to Orange County after living for many years in the San Fernando Valley -- vanished three years ago in Costa Mesa , after her car blew a tire as she headed_home to Newport Beach from a concert . Her nude and handcuffed body was found last week in a freezer outside Famalaro ' s home , about 75 miles north of Phoenix . She had suffered multiple blows to the head , and her eyes and mouth were covered with cloth and sealed with duct tape , authorities said . * In other significant developments Thursday : * Court documents filed_in Arizona revealed numerous additional items seized from Famalaro ' s home and vehicles in recent days , including a black whip , a micro-cassette marked &quot; Save , important , &quot; multiple audiotapes whose contents were unknown and a brown paper sack with two keys and a pubic_hair . Earlier searches have unearthed a crowbar and claw_hammer that appear to be bloodied , strips of white cloth and a tarpaulin , also stained with a red substance , and items belonging_to Huber , including clothing , jewelry and a purse . * Contacted by telephone , some of six additional women whose names were found in subsequent searches of Famalaro ' s belongings said they had no clue as_to how Famalaro came_into possession of their effects . &quot; Good God ! Even my middle initial , &quot; said Donna R . Evinger , 57 , of Tustin . &quot; I ' m pretty shook_up . . . . I ' m alive , I can say that. &quot; * Joining newly appointed defense counsel Thomas K . Kelly was Warren R . Darrow , an attorney who Kelly said is a distant relative of famed defense_lawyer Clarence Darrow . * A team of investigators from Orange County , including chief forensic pathologist Richard Fukumoto and other crime scene specialists , were preparing to travel_to Arizona today to meet with their counterparts there . Christy Clow , property manager for the Laguna Hills storage facility , said police have been conducting forensic tests inside a unit that had been leased to Famalaro from February , 1991 , to September , 1992 . Huber disappeared June 3 , 1991 . &quot; They ' ve pulled_up the carpet , searching for blood and hair , &quot; said Clow , who has discussed the case with police . Authorities were said to be using high-tech devices and a chemical called luminol that enhances blood and other evidence . John Conley , an Orange County assistant district_attorney , confirmed Thursday that investigators have focused_on a possible Orange County murder scene linked to Famalaro . He declined to discuss where that site was , but said investigators have been examining the location for the past several days , trying to determine if Huber was slain there . Conley said that &quot; should the murder scene be proven to have been in Orange County , we could have jurisdiction &quot; and try Famalaro there , instead of in Arizona . * Deliberating secretly in Prescott , Ariz. , the grand_jury heard testimony from Yavapai County Sheriff ' s Lt . Scott Mascher before returning an indictment on murder and a felony grand theft count alleging Famalaro stole the Ryder rental truck that contained Huber ' s body . Wednesday , Mascher testified in a lengthy bail hearing that several former girlfriends of Famalaro had told investigators they had been threatened or felt threatened by him . One woman said she had been knocked_down and handcuffed by him . Famalaro is being held without bond and is scheduled to be arraigned August 1 in Yavapai County Superior_Court .
