   <TEXT> I was dismayed , though not shocked , to learn that the Simon Wiesenthal Center called_on Prodigy and other on-line services to censor the content of their users ' bulletin_board posts because of alleged incidents of hate speech ( &quot; Bigots ' Growing use of Computer_Networks Assailed , &quot; Dec . 14 ) . Though the views of organizations like the National Alliance and the American Renaissance are abhorrent , the Simon Wiesenthal Center should counter their efforts with bulletin_board posts of its own , not blatant attempts to quash free speech . Cyberspace should be open_to all views . The Simon Wiesenthal Center ' s attempt to destroy freedom in cyberspace should not be applauded , it should be resisted . KENNETH D . DeGIORGIO Long_Beach The Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) shares the concerns of many computer users over the exploitation of this technology by groups and individuals promoting racism , anti-Semitism , Holocaust denial and other extremist views . The proper approach to this complex problem , however , is not as simple as asking the federal_government to place a traffic_cop on the information superhighway . Considerations of how to combat computerized hate must take_into_account competing concerns over the protection of free speech and over the spread of hateful messages , particularly to young people . Some on-line services have sought to promote wide-ranging discussion while fostering , through implementation of guidelines for members ' behavior , an environment in which parents can feel comfortable allowing their children to learn and explore in cyberspace . Where such guidelines exist , it is appropriate to urge administrators of those systems to ensure that they are followed . In addition to using commercial services , bigots have surfaced on the Internet , an unregulated global web of computer_networks . They have created their own separate computer bulletin_boards , which ADL first exposed in our report , &quot; Computerized Networks of Hate , &quot; in 1985 . Experience has taught us that , over the long term , exposing the extremists ' agenda and educating as_to the harm it can cause are , jointly , the most effective response . When confronted with the views of a bigot or an extremist , computer users should seek_out assistance that will help them to blunt the messages of hate , from agencies such_as the ADL . ABRAHAM H . FOXMAN National Director , ADL New York Citing the Institute for Historical Review in an article about &quot; hate groups &quot; is outrageous . The suggestion that historical revisionism and the IHR are motivated by hate is a cheap smear . We are proud_of the backing we have earned from people of the most diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds , including Jewish . In fact , Jewish supporters of the IHR have recently come under particularly intense criticism , and even physical violence , for their dissident views about the Holocaust . Since its founding in 1978 , the IHR has steadfastly opposed bigotry of all kinds in its efforts to promote greater public understanding of key chapters of history . Contributors to our journal have included respected scholars . MARK WEBER , Editor The Journal of Historical Review IHR , Newport Beach</TEXT>
