   <HEADLINE> PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M . KRISTOF : ASK FOR TAX REFUND AFTER SHOPPING IN EUROPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you ' re the typical American traveling_to Europe this summer , chances are you ' re going to spend at least some of your time shopping . But you might not realize that you may be entitled to a partial refund on what you pay_for goods purchased there . Shopping consistently ranks among the top vacation activities for U.S. travelers overseas , according to the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration in Washington . The average American spends more_than $ 2 # 500 on a European vacation -- and some estimate that at least 10 % of that goes_to clothing , china , crystal , watches , souvenirs and other goods that tourists plan to bring_home . However , few Americans realize that &quot; value-added_taxes &quot; account_for up_to 24 % of the price of goods they buy_in Europe . A value-added_tax is essentially a sales tax that ' s tacked_on to the cost of goods at every stage of production . While the tax is substantial , it ' s hidden because it ' s simply factored into the cost of everything you buy , rather than added in at the time of purchase . Fortunately , in some cases , the tax is refundable . If you buy a $ 100 sweater in Sweden , for example , you can apply for a $ 20 VAT credit . The $ 500 designer gown bought_in Paris , where VATs account_for 15.7 % of your purchase_price , would make you eligible for a $ 78 refund . And the $ 350 crystal set you pick_up in London could net you a 14.9 % refund , or $ 52 . You also pay VATs on car rentals , hotel accommodations and meals . The refunds apply only to items that tourists take_home . ( Separate , and somewhat more generous , rules apply to business travelers. ) Still , roughly $ 30 million in VAT refunds go unclaimed each year , says Steve Jarmel , a spokesman for Europe Tax-Free Shopping , a Chicago-based service that helps U.S. tourists get VAT refunds . Why ? The taxes are complicated and easily misunderstood , and the rules about how to qualify for a refund vary . For example , though VATs are charged all through Europe , in some cases you can get a refund only if your purchase exceeds a certain amount . The amount varies from country to country , sometimes even from store to store . In Sweden , a tourist can get a 20 % VAT refund if he or she buys something worth more_than about $ 15 . ( The minimums are set_in each country ' s currency , so fluctuations in the value of the dollar affect the VAT minimum purchase hurdle. ) In France , tourists can receive VAT refunds only if they purchase merchandise worth more_than 2 # 000 francs -- that ' s about $ 385 at today ' s sorry exchange_rates -- in a single store . In Britain , stores set their own minimums . Typically , British merchants won ' t fill_out the VAT refund paperwork unless you buy more_than $ 50 to $ 75 worth of goods , says Robin Prestage , a spokesman for the_British Tourist Authority in New York . To further complicate matters , refunding the VAT is voluntary . Generally speaking , merchants do_it because it ' s good business . But some don ' t -- and they don ' t have to . Even merchants who provide the refunds won ' t necessarily offer them unless you ask . &quot; Salespeople don ' t talk as much in Europe as they do here , &quot; says one European official . &quot; They tend not to volunteer a lot of information about the VAT or anything else. &quot; The bottom_line : If you want a VAT refund , ask_in the store if it ' s available . And you must ask the clerk to fill_out the paperwork before you leave . How exactly does_it work ? Again , the answer varies in different countries , but consider how the system works in England , one of the top destinations among U.S. tourists . Merchants decide whether to provide VAT refunds , then set their own minimums . Once you exceed the threshold , however , the refund amount is calculated_on the entire purchase_price , not merely on the amount that exceeds the threshold . In other words , a $ 100 item would net a $ 14.90 refund in a London store regardless of whether the store ' s minimum is $ 50 or $ 75 or $ 100 . To get the refund , ask the sales clerk to fill_out a VAT refund form for you . Then hold_on to your sales receipt and the paperwork until you leave the country . At the airport , a customs agent must sign the VAT form , verifying that you are , indeed , exporting the purchased items out of Europe . ( If you ' re having the item shipped home , the store should subtract the VAT from the cost at the time of sale , because the store is exporting the item . But again , ask to be sure. ) Once customs has stamped your VAT form , you have two choices : You can apply for a refund directly through the government -- there are often government VAT refund desks in the airport -- or you can take the paperwork to a refund service , such_as Europe Tax-Free Shopping , also frequently found in airports . Refund services should give you the refund immediately , either in cash or by crediting your charge_card . But they ' ll charge a hefty fee to do_it . Europe Tax-Free Shopping , for example , charges 20 % of the refund amount . The government will give you the full amount , but it may take months . Checks are denominated in the foreign country ' s currency , so you could have to pay a bank fee to convert the money to U.S. dollars . But if you ask , you can often have foreign government refunds credited to your charge_card . The credit_card company automatically converts the refund to U.S. dollars .</TEXT>
