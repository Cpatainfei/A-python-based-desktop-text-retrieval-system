   <HEADLINE> CENTRAL_AMERICA ; LEADERS WORRY : AFTER PROP . 187 , THE DELUGE ; LATIN PRESIDENTS FEAR A MASSIVE RETURN OF CITIZENS . THEY HOPE TO LOBBY CLINTON AT UPCOMING MIAMI SUMMIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Central_American presidents will carry the divisive issue of immigration to next month ' s Summit of the Americas in Miami , where they plan to tell President Clinton that only improved economies can stanch the northward flow of illegal immigrants . Expressing outrage at California ' s Proposition 187 and other symptoms of what they see as an anti-immigrant backlash , the region ' s leaders have begun a full-scale lobbying effort to prevent a feared massive return of citizens to cash-strapped and politically troubled home countries . &quot; There is a kind of new racism ( in the United States ) that is very dangerous , &quot; Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol said . &quot; We are extremely worried about our compatriots . . . ( and ) we must study why the U.S. people are turning_to rejection of minorities. &quot; &quot; Denying health and education to children is really deplorable , &quot; Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina said , echoing others who have said the California measure , approved overwhelmingly by voters , violates basic human_rights . Many of Central_America ' s economies rely heavily on the money that its citizens living_in the United States send home . An end to those remittances , because Central_Americans are either being deported or forced further underground , would spell disaster for the region , officials here argue . The case of El_Salvador -- the source country of tens of thousands of illegal immigrants in Southern California -- is especially acute . Salvadorans in the United States were granted temporary protected status in 1990 because of the civil_war that raged between leftist guerrillas and a U.S.-backed government in their country . That special status allowed many Salvadorans to live and work in the United States legally . It expires at the end of the year , and with the war officially over since 1992 , an extension seems unlikely . The prospect has sent Salvadoran officials into panic . Calderon Sol made a personal_appeal to Vice_President Al Gore during an ecological meeting in Managua , Nicaragua , last month , and Salvadorans on both the left and right are lobbying to have the status extended , saying that the stability of the country is at stake . The remittances from Salvadorans in the United States exceed $ 800 million a year , more_than all export income combined , according to the Central_Bank here . Tens of thousands of Guatemalans and Nicaraguans also send home money that is crucial to those nations ' economies . Neither group has the same protected status as the Salvadorans , but through asylum and other programs , many have been able to establish legal , if temporary , stays . They too would be hurt under measures aimed at clamping_down on immigrants , officials in Central_America maintain . &quot; Our fear is the 187 phenomenon is going_to spread , &quot; said Managua Mayor Arnoldo Aleman . &quot; It is not going_to stop in California. &quot; The Central_American presidents hope to use the upcoming summit to make a case for stopping illegal immigration by bolstering economic and commercial ties between their countries and the United States . They want increased access to U.S. markets and a shot at attracting more foreign investment as a way to make their economies stable enough to support an eventual return of exiles . &quot; We see this as being of mutual benefit , a two-way road , &quot; Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal said . Calderon Sol agreed : &quot; The United States is going_to have immigrants -- with laws like 187 and without them , with extended stays and without them -- because that is the reality . The people of Central_America will go_to the United States , or they will go elsewhere , in search of better living conditions if they don ' t find them in their countries. &quot; Clinton and 33 of the hemisphere ' s heads_of_state begin the three-day summit in Miami on Dec . 9 , the first such meeting in 27 years . Given Clinton ' s newly weakened position , however , it remains unclear whether the plea of the Central_Americans will have much impact . U.S. officials in Central_America seem to be preparing_for the inevitable , seeking to emphasize the potential benefits of returning , highly skilled , U.S.-trained exiles . An Unwelcome Proposition Although they concede that conditions in their countries have contributed to the flight of their peoples , leaders of Central_American_nations still say they are furious about U.S. immigration initiatives such Proposition 187 . They plan to make ther strong feelings known during President Clinton ' s summit in Miami . &quot; The United States is going_to have immigrants -- with laws like 187 and without them , with extended stays and without them -- because that is the reality. &quot; Armando Calderon Sol , President of El_Salvador &quot; Denying health and education to children is really deplorable. &quot; Carlos Roberto Reina , President of Honduras Central_Americans in Southern California Salvadorans : 272 # 301 Guatemalans : 139 # 372 Nicaraguans : 38 # 439 Hondurans : 25 # 593 Estimates by social_service agencies working with immigrants put the figures for Salvadorans and Guatemalans -- communities with large illegal components , at up_to 50 % higher .
