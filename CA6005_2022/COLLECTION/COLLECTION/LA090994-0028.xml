   <HEADLINE> POPULATION : IT ' S A CULTURAL ISSUE ; CHANGE FROM THE BOTTOM UP -- NOT POLITICS -- IS WHAT MATTERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Any major international gathering like the U.N. population conference taking_place this week in Cairo tends to attract a penumbra of unofficial or semiofficial delegations . The Cairo conference may be something of an exception , however , in that the forum of thousands of NGOs ( non-governmental organizations ) that adjoins the official conference may actually be the main event . The success of governments in either promoting or inhibiting population growth has been mixed to extremely poor . Individual countries may be pointed to as examples of either population explosion or population stabilization , but the determining factor_in nearly every case turns_out to be cultural rather than political . Capitalist West Germany absorbed communist East_Germany and the German birthrate is the world ' s lowest . But if communist East_Germany had absorbed capitalist West Germany , would it be any higher ? Probably not . A cultural value may be reinforced by determined political leadership . On the whole , however , politics does not build culture but rather builds_upon it . CULTURAL CLUES : Can we name a cultural rather than a political change that might stabilize the world ' s population at a sustainable level ? The question is reasonable because if population growth is inevitable , the size of the growth is not . The U.N. Population Fund estimates that the world ' s population in the year 2050 will be between 7.8 billion and 12.5 billion . The difference between the two extremes exceeds the current population of the world ! If the outcome were more predetermined , culture might play a minor_role . But we are entering a period of radical demographic unpredictability . There are all sorts of ways of limiting population . But only human behavior can expand it . The cultural change on which many of the most thoughtful observers of the looming population crisis stake their hopes is a change in the status of women . This change , which has been taking_place as a bottom-up social transformation rather than a top-down political one , has brought_about a striking reduction in the birthrate in countries as different as Kenya and South_Korea . For this we should be grateful . Changes of this sort , so difficult to begin , can be all but impossible to stop , and the world needs a change in the culture of human reproduction that can match the speed of reproduction itself . RELIGIOUS CONCERNS : But where does this reading of the world population crisis leave the Roman_Catholic_Church , whose role in Cairo has been so problematic ? It leaves the church not as Vatican diplomacy at the official Cairo conference but rather as a Christian NGO , albeit the largest in the world , taking its somewhat less lordly seat at the unofficial conference . Stress culture rather than politics and it matters less what the Pope ' s delegates say about the controversial paragraph 8.25 in the official conference declaration than what the average parish priest is saying to the women of his parish -- and what they are answering back . If , at the Cairo conference , abortion turns_out to be an insoluble question , the American delegation should be the last to be surprised , given the intractability of the abortion issue in this country . But if the main conference was itself a sideshow , then the abortion dispute that bedeviled it was doubly a sideshow . Because there is no single world culture , any change in the culture of human reproduction will have to take_place multiculturally . But just as the challenge of child_care , managed differently in different cultures , is still , in the end , the same challenge , so a change in the way the human_race thinks_about controlling its own reproduction can be undertaken , in all its multiplicity , as a common change . That is the lesson of Cairo .</TEXT>
