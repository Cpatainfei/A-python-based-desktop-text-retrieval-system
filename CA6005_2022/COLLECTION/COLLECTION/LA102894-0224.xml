   <HEADLINE> DEMOCRATS GAINING IN KEY RACES , NEW SURVEYS SHOW ; CAMPAIGN : GOP ROLLS_OUT ATTACK ADS DEPICTING RIVALS AS HYPOCRITES , LIARS AND FAILURES . ELECTORATE ' S FOCUS ON LOCAL ISSUES SEEN GIVING EDGE TO INCUMBENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With a smattering of new polls showing Democrats closing the gap in several key races , the Republican_Party announced three new attack ads Thursday that portray Bill_Clinton and Democrats as hypocrites , failures and liars . And the White_House responded by accusing the Republicans of intellectual dishonesty . The activity , from the tightening of the races to the charges and countercharges , seems typical of the final days before an election . Yet amid the latest round of rhetoric and statistics , there are signs of subtle shifts in public sentiment and political strategy that suggest Democratic Party losses on Nov . 8 might not be as severe as_many experts have predicted . One factor , according to a new poll , is that voters are focusing more on local issues as elections draw closer , a trend likely to benefit incumbents because they have more political heft than newcomers . Most incumbents are Democrats . Another element is President Clinton ' s rising popularity in response to recent foreign_policy successes , sentiment that may be trickling down to his fellow party members . Clinton ' s improving fortunes , which have been apparent in polls for a week , showed_up again Thursday in a poll by CNN / USA Today . It found that the number of Americans who approve of his job performance stood at 48 % , compared with 46 % who disapprove . In turn , several prominent Democrats also seemed to be closing_in races that only two weeks ago looked_like shocking losses : * In Massachusetts , a strong performance in a debate this week apparently helped Sen . Edward M . Kennedy continue to pull_away from Republican challenger Mitt Romney . According to a poll released Thursday by the Boston Globe and WBZ-TV , Kennedy is now leading by 20 points . Only two weeks ago it was a dead_heat . * In Florida , two new polls showed that Democratic Gov . Lawton Chiles had either pulled even or passed Republican Jeb Bush , son of former President George_Bush , only three weeks after Chiles was down by 10 points . * In New York , two other polls show a statistical dead_heat between Gov . Mario M . Cuomo and Republican challenger George Pataki , a state legislator . The number of undecided voters in both surveys has grown . Some of Pataki ' s support appears to be bleeding away to an independent candidate , while Cuomo ' s is stable . The polls were conducted after Cuomo received the surprise endorsement of New York City ' s Republican mayor , Rudolph W . Giuliani . A new poll by the Times Mirror Center for People and the Press in Washington also found considerably more support this week for Democratic congressional candidates than a_few weeks ago , though it found that other factors , besides Clinton , were driving the change . Overall , 47 % of registered voters said that they are likely to vote Republican versus 44 % Democratic , a significant narrowing from the 52 % -40 % margin that Republicans enjoyed Oct . 9 in the poll . Nonetheless , the survey , which polled 1 # 577 registered voters between Oct . 20 and 24 , suggested that Republicans hold a wider lead among those people considered most likely to vote , based on their past voting patterns . Among that group , Republicans still held a 51 % -43 % advantage . One reason Democrats are doing better , the Times Mirror poll suggests , is that voters are thinking more about local issues as Election_Day nears . The percentage of voters who say that local issues are important has risen 11 points to 38 % in the last three weeks . That in turn tends to make them look more favorably on incumbents because they have the advantages of seniority and political clout . Indeed , the percentage of people who said that they were inclined to vote for an incumbent has risen by 6 points to 55 % in the last three weeks . It is also possible , the Times Mirror poll authors suggest , that voters think more positively about incumbents because Congress is now in recess and legislators are home campaigning . Even Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour acknowledged at a press_conference here that Democrats are gaining in many races . However , he argued that a shift is to be expected in the late days of a campaign , a time when undecided voters often turn_to their traditional party . Barbour announced that the Republican National Committee is about to spend $ 2 million to air three new ads on local stations in 25 states attacking the Democratic Party and Clinton in particular . One ad asks voters : &quot; Are you really fed up with Congress ? Well , on Nov . 8 you ' ve got a chance to do something. &quot; Another says : &quot; Their power is crumbling , the Clinton Democrats . Now they ' re lying_about Republicans. &quot; The third , playing off a recently leaked White_House memo about ways to cut the deficit , charges that &quot; behind closed doors the Clinton White_House is discussing cuts_in Social_Security and Medicare and billions more in tax increases. &quot; State officials around the country are expected to announce today the states in which those ads will run . It was unclear whether they will appear in California , except on Cable News Network . The Administration reacted quickly . White_House Chief_of_Staff Leon E . Panetta charged that the Republican ads are a sign the other side is &quot; obviously worried &quot; about a Democratic surge . Then Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen , echoing Panetta , called a briefing at the White_House to criticize a national platform that has become the centerpiece in the agenda of 355 Republicans running_for Congress . Every Republican who signed the so-called &quot; contract for America &quot; has pledged to vote for cutting taxes and passing a balanced-budget amendment .</TEXT>
