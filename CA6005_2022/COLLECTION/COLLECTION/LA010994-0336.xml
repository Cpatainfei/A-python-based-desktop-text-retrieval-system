   <HEADLINE> BOSNIA ISSUE A THORN AT NATO SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When President Clinton and other leaders of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization gather here today , one issue most of them won ' t want to talk_about is Bosnia-Herzegovina and the brutal war that NATO has so conspicuously failed to end . But they won ' t have that luxury . Bosnia is forcing its way onto the agenda of the NATO summit , whether the alliance ' s leaders like it or not . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , who arrived in Brussels on Saturday to prepare the way for Clinton , asked European foreign_ministers to head_off another angry debate over who is to blame for NATO ' s inability to end the siege of Sarajevo , diplomats said . But French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said his government will press for an explicit NATO commitment to use military_force in Sarajevo -- and an explicit U.S. commitment to provide ground troops to implement a European peace plan . Events on the ground have made the_French demands more urgent . Serbian shelling of Sarajevo closed the city ' s airport -- and thus its major pipeline of humanitarian relief -- for most of last week . The French commander of U.N. troops in the former Yugoslav republics , Gen . Jean Cot , asked_for authority to order air strikes in retaliation , but U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali turned him down . Christopher , who steadfastly opposes sending U.S. ground troops into Bosnia , has been battling against reopening the issue at the summit . Nevertheless , recognizing that NATO can ' t duck the presence of a brutal war on its own border , Christopher has been working toward agreement on a NATO statement that would reaffirm past commitments to act to prevent the fall of Sarajevo . Those past commitments appear to have had little practical effect . The Serbian forces besieging Sarajevo have subjected the Bosnian capital to daily bombardment and cut_off its electricity and water , and NATO has not retaliated . U.S. officials argue , though , that NATO ' s threats may have restrained the Serbs from pressing their offensive even further . Diplomats said there was little support in the alliance for France ' s demand for immediate military_action . Britain , Spain and Canada all worry that air strikes against Serbian positions would lead to retaliation against their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia -- and eventually force their withdrawal entirely , leaving the Bosnians even worse off .</TEXT>
