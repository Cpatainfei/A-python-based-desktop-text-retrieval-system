   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A ; WHAT NEW ESCROW ACCOUNT RULES MEAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Department of Housing and Urban Development unveiled rules last week that will enable millions of homeowners who paid too_much into home-loan escrow accounts to recoup at least $ 1.5 billion in total refunds and credits . Here are some questions and answers on how the standards will affect homeowners . Question : What is an escrow account ? Answer : Escrow accounts are set_up by banks , thrifts and other mortgage lenders to ensure home_buyers pay property_taxes , insurance_premiums and other loan-related charges on_time . The funds that go_into the account are contained in a homeowner ' s monthly mortgage payment . * Q : What do the new rules do ? A : They place a clear-cut ceiling on the amount consumers may be required to place in escrow when buying a home . The company that runs the account -- either the lender or a specialized &quot; servicer &quot; firm -- will be allowed each month to collect 1 / 12th of annual property_taxes , insurance_premiums or other recurring items . The company also will be able to maintain a &quot; cushion &quot; equal_to two months ' worth of those payments . This cushion is used to cover a possible increase in a homeowner ' s property_taxes or a potential default_on a mortgage payment . If a homeowner ' s mortgage requires a stricter standard -- say a one-month cushion -- that language will take priority over the federal rules . Many firms had required a three-month cushion , with some even requiring an eight-month surplus . Further , lenders in the future must use &quot; aggregate &quot; accounting when analyzing escrow accounts instead of &quot; single-item &quot; accounting , in which escrow items were computed separately . * Q : How did the rules come_about ? A : HUD says use of single-item accounting was &quot; prevalent &quot; among lenders and resulted in more funds being held_in escrow accounts than were necessary . Further , various state_attorneys general -- spurred by angry consumers -- filed suit against big mortgage lenders in recent years alleging escrow abuses . The cases brought the issue of over-escrowing into the limelight . * Q : How can a homeowner know whether he or she is owed a refund or a credit ? A : After next April , annual escrow statements mailed to homeowners will contain more detailed information about their accounts . The information will be provided in a more readable format and designed to enable homeowners to know whether they are owed money . Bankers and HUD officials said it is premature now to call the firm servicing your mortgage because the new rules will not take_effect until late April , 1995 . * Q : How does a homeowner collect a refund or a credit ? A : The company servicing the mortgage will be required to send a check if an escrow account contains a surplus of more_than $ 50 . For accounts with surpluses of less , the company can either mail a check or lower a homeowner ' s mortgage payment by applying a credit equal_to the surplus . HUD officials said any payments will probably be made by April , 1996 , at the latest . * Q : How many people are affected ? A : HUD estimates almost 6 million mortgage holders . * Q : What is the average likely refund or credit ? A : HUD figures about $ 150 , although the amounts are expected to vary widely . * Q : How do the new rules affect future home_buyers ? A : HUD estimates some future home_buyers will pay_up to $ 250 less in upfront closing costs when purchasing a house because of the change in standards .</TEXT>
