   <HEADLINE> TAD AND DIXIE : ROUND 2</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> All fans of Tad Martin ( Michael E . Knight ) and Dixie Cooney ( Cady McClain ) were happy to see the &quot; All My Children &quot; characters tie the marital knot -- for the second time . Longtime viewers remember that the last time the romantic duo tried to walk down the aisle their wedding never took_place , because Tad got_into a fight with the dastardly Billy Clyde Tuggle ( Matthew Cowles ) and fell_off a bridge and was presumed dead . For the next couple of years , Tad was in California suffering from amnesia , while Dixie went_through two marriages , to Craig Lawson ( Scott Thompson Baker ) and Brian Bodine ( Brian Green ) . * Earlier this month , &quot; Another World &quot; threw a party at the elegant Hudson_River Club in New York City . The atmosphere was joyous , and the food was scrumptious and plentiful . Almost all_of the show ' s current cast members were in_attendance , but a lovely part of the evening was how many former cast members showed_up . &quot; Another World &quot; started with the Matthews family , and not only was Irene Daily in_attendance ( she still plays Aunt Liz Matthews on a recurring basis ) , but so was Sam Groom and David Bailey , who both played Russ Matthews ; Beverly Penberthy , who played Pat Matthews ; and her one time on-screen husband , Michael M . Ryan , who played John Randolph . Also present was gone-but-not-forgotten George Reinholt , who played the first Steve Frame , and Judith Barcroft , the original Lenore Curtin . Penberthy had been out of town and came_home the day of the party to find her invitation in the mail . After spending the day shopping and grooming herself , she emerged looking very elegant . Reinholt was so happy to be in New York City that he is seriously considering moving_back from his current residence in Pennsylvania . He would happily consider a return engagement on &quot; Another World. &quot; Two notable recent returnees were Ricky Paull Goldin ( formerly Dean Frame ) , who was accompanied by Yasmine Bleeth ( formerly Lee Ann Buchanan on &quot; One Life to Live &quot; ) and Alicia Coppola ( the original Lorna Devon ) . Goldin was gearing_up for his Broadway opening in &quot; Grease. &quot; Bleeth put to rest all rumors that she would be returning to &quot; One Life to Live , &quot; since she has signed a two-year contract with the syndicated series &quot; Baywatch. &quot; Coppola was &quot; chilling_out , &quot; just as she had planned to do after leaving the show , and looked well-rested and lovely . No party would be complete without a cake , and the highlight of the evening came_with the entire cast gathering around to cut it ( and cut_up for the cameras ) , while singing a rousing rendition of the show ' s theme_song .</TEXT>
