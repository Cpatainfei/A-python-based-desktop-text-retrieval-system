   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : CULVER CITY ; MAYOR PROPOSES PUTTING NEW TAXES TO A VOTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Taxation without representation is the latest battle_cry of Culver City Mayor Albert Vera , who is proposing that all new city levies be put_on the ballot for voter approval . The proposal is expected to come_up for discussion during Monday night ' s City_Council meeting . Under Vera ' s plan , all new taxes and assessments levied in Culver City and any increases to levies that currently exist would need initial approval from the City_Council . If approved , the measures would be placed on the ballot in the next regular election . &quot; I haven ' t heard of any proposal where cities have said they want blanket restrictions on themselves that give voters the right to provide permission for taxing , &quot; said Steve Kroes , senior research analyst for the California Taxpayers Assn . There is some question about the legality of a local_government putting tax measures on its ballots . In a precedent-setting case in 1991 , the 5th District of the California Court of Appeal ruled that a utility tax that had been approved by the Woodlake City_Council and then collected by Tulare County could not subsequently be put_on the city ' s ballot for a vote . Because the tax already had been enacted by the council , having taxpayers to vote on it after the fact constituted a referendum , the court decided . &quot; Our state Constitution prevents the power of referendum from being applied to ( local ) taxes or in_order to reverse tax decisions , &quot; Kroes said . The outcome of other similar cases does not bode well for Vera ' s effort , said Jonathan Coupal , legislative director for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn . &quot; I would say there has been a trend against what Culver City is doing , &quot; Coupal said . Vera says he remains unconvinced that his plan would be vulnerable to legal challenge . Said the mayor : &quot; They ' d have to show me. &quot; Vera says his proposal is aimed at preventing the city from creating new taxes or assessment districts every time it needs more revenue . By requiring a public vote on all new and increased levies , Vera says , the city will be forced to first consider cutting costs . Some , however , fear that the city will wind_up having to cut vital city services . &quot; If the public says they don ' t want to pay , we may have to dip_into public safety funds , &quot; said Mark Ambrozich , the city ' s accountant .
