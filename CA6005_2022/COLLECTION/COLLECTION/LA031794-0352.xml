   <HEADLINE> FUND-RAISING LETTER AIDS IMPRISONED KOON ; CRIME : PLEA PORTRAYS HIM AS A SCAPEGOAT . IT STRETCHES THE TRUTH , DESCRIBING RODNEY KING AS A PCP-CRAZED MURDER_SUSPECT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The book publisher for Stacey C . Koon , the former Los Angeles Police_Department sergeant serving prison time for the beating of Rodney King , has circulated a mass appeal for donations to help Koon ' s struggling family and help him appeal his federal civil-rights conviction as far as the Supreme Court . The letter , which bears Koon ' s letterhead and signature , has been sent_out nationwide in recent months under the auspices of the Stacey Koon Defense Fund , run_out of a mail drop_in Glendale . It has generated enormous financial_support from police_officers and citizens for Koon , his wife and their five children , according to Koon ' s Washington , D.C.-based publisher , Regnery Publishing Inc. , which organized the fund-raising_effort . But the letter , which the publisher said was &quot; basically &quot; written by Koon himself , is filled with politically volatile assertions , half-truths and unsubstantiated allegations . In it , Koon lambastes King as a PCP-crazed homicide suspect at the time of his arrest in 1991 and says King was not struck in the head with police batons and &quot; only suffered minor injuries when finally forced to the ground. &quot; Some of those are assertions that court evidence and even Koon ' s former lawyer indicate are unproven or untrue . Koon , currently serving a 30-month sentence in federal prison in Dublin , Calif. , could not be reached for comment . The four-page typeset letter also claims that Koon and convicted Officer Laurence M . Powell &quot; are the political scapegoats of black radicals and self-serving liberal politicians who know that we are innocent. &quot; In the letter , Koon is quoted as telling readers that when they hear &quot; the whole story , ( they ) will be shocked , stunned and convinced that my officers and I were sold_out by weak politicians and a deceitful news media. &quot; Until then , he asks readers for as much as $ 1 # 000 from each of them so he and Powell can appeal their cases and get_out of prison before being killed by cop-hating inmates . &quot; That will take dollars , &quot; Koon writes , &quot; lots of them. &quot; But it isn ' t clear how much money has been raised so far or where all_of it is going . The publisher of Koon ' s 1993 book , &quot; Presumed Guilty : The Tragedy of the Rodney King Affair , &quot; said this week the letter was his idea and that Koon had help writing it . Alfred S . Regnery , president of Regnery Publishing , said most of the money would go_to Koon ' s family and to pay his legal bills . But he acknowledged that wrapped in with the fund-raising letter was a sales pitch : Give the former sergeant ' s defense fund a $ 30 donation or more and get a copy of his book . Regnery said those copies would be given to the defense fund at &quot; slightly over cost &quot; but declined to say how much money the publishing_company and defense fund would keep before passing the rest along to Koon and his family . He said he was not trying to make a profit from increased book sales . The fund-raising appeal has been aimed not only at police_officers but regular citizens as well , Regnery said , and it has generated thousands of responses and donations . &quot; It ' s been very good , &quot; he said . &quot; Actually , it ' s been astoundingly good . Much higher than we anticipated , in terms of the number of responses and the size of the contributions. &quot; Because the defense fund is not a political entity or charitable group , it does not have to report to state or federal watchdog agencies how much money it has raised and how much of that it has passed along to its intended benefactor , according to the state_attorney general ' s office . Some have questioned the motivation of the fund-raising letter , saying it is a revisionist history that distorts the facts established in the two King-related trials and divides the city as police officials and city leaders continue to promote healing in the wake of the 1992 riots . LAPD officers beat King , an African American , on March 3 , 1991 , after he refused to pull over his car and led them on an eight-mile chase . Koon and three other officers were found not_guilty in state court and those verdicts ignited three days of rioting . Police officials declined to comment on the letter , and Koon ' s current and former lawyers took pains to distance themselves from it . &quot; It is remarkable , &quot; said Laurie Levenson , a Loyola Law_School professor who monitored the federal trial last year in which Koon and Powell were found guilty of violating King ' s civil_rights and were each sentenced to 30 months in prison . &quot; You see defendants do this type of fund-raising , &quot; Levenson said , &quot; but it is problematic when it becomes deceptive and misleading . Although there are laws that prohibit the use of the mails to obtain money through misleading communication , Levenson said it is unlikely that anyone will try to apply them to Koon . In recent weeks , Koon ' s letter attracted the attention of Los Angeles bunco squad detectives who investigate fraudulent fund-raising_efforts . After a short investigation , the effort was found to be legitimate and the_matter was dropped , police sources said . Identifying inaccuracies in the letter requires only a cursory review of evidence presented in the King beating and civil-rights trials . Even Laurence Powell ' s first_name is spelled wrong . Blood_tests taken_after King was arrested did not offer evidence that he was under the influence of PCP when he was subdued by police , although the letter states as fact that he was . The accused officers have long maintained that King displayed signs of PCP intoxication . The letter also states that King needed to be subdued so aggressively because he was &quot; the prime suspect in a homicide at the time of his arrest &quot; -- another contention that prosecutors and defense_lawyers agreed was untrue . Asked how such a charge made its way into the letter , Regnery said : &quot; I can ' t remember where that came from. &quot; And despite the letter ' s assertions that King was injured only by falling to the ground , doctors who testified for the prosecution at Koon ' s federal trial testified that King ' s face was fractured in 15 places , most probably from blows landed by a police baton or similar weapon . Doctors who testified for the defense disputed that account , saying that King ' s injuries were in fact the result of one or more face-first falls to the pavement . Levenson also criticized the tone of the letter , which asserts that if Koon and Powell are not exonerated during their appeals , police won ' t subdue criminals in the future . &quot; Neither you or your family will be safe from the_likes_of hardened criminals like Rodney King , &quot; the letter states . &quot; It is a blatant call_for sympathy and financial_support , &quot; Levenson said . &quot; The disturbing thing about it is it . . . continues to throw_up a divide at a time when we are trying to heal relations between police and the community. &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . Alan Yochelson , who prosecuted the state case in which Koon and three of his subordinate officers were acquitted of improperly beating King , also said some of the assertions in the letter are at_odds with testimony given during the trial . Even Koon ' s lawyer in that case , Darryl Mounger , questioned whether the former sergeant would include such inaccuracies and contested facts in a public appeal for money . &quot; It certainly doesn ' t sound like something Stacey would do , &quot; Mounger said . &quot; I would not think Stacey Koon would acquiesce to someone else writing that letter , certainly because some things in there are not true. &quot; Regnery , however , maintains that the fund drive is a sincere effort to help a cop who he says was hung_out to dry by his city and Police_Department . The two became friends , he said , when Koon spent a week at his house during a promotional tour for his book last year . &quot; When he went_to prison , he seemed to me he was getting screwed and needed whatever help he could get , &quot; Regnery said . Regnery said Koon ' s wife , Mary , prefers not to comment about her family ' s plight . But in the letter , Koon says his wife has &quot; suffered horribly &quot; through the ordeal as have his children : Matthew , 15 , Gregory , 13 , Alicia and Kimberly , 8 , and Jennifer , 4 . &quot; While I am sent to prison , &quot; he writes , &quot; who will take_care of them ? &quot; Some of Koon ' s legal bills already have been paid . The police union already has paid at least $ 150 # 000 for his lawyers and court costs in the two trials . But Regnery and others said his bills are likely to climb as his appeal proceeds and that his family ' s expenses are mounting while he is in prison . The U.S._government also has appealed Koon ' s sentencing , saying that U.S. District Judge John G . Davies erred in calculating the appropriate sentences for the two convicted officers . After being suspended without pay in 1991 , Koon was finally dismissed from the department several weeks ago after a short administrative_hearing . His lawyers have contended that the city treated Koon unfairly for suspending him for so_long without pay and because it did not pay his legal bills as it has in some_other cases .</TEXT>
