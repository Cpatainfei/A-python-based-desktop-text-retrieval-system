   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN ALLY IS ELECTED SPEAKER OF UPPER HOUSE ; RUSSIA : SHUMEIKO ' S VICTORY INDICATES THAT THE NEW PARLIAMENT WILL BE MORE CONCILIATORY THAN THE ONE THE PRESIDENT DISSOLVED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lawmakers elected a close ally of President Boris N . Yeltsin as Speaker of Russia ' s equivalent of the U.S. Senate on Thursday in a sign that the legislative body will be more conciliatory than the old Parliament , which Yeltsin dissolved in September . First Deputy Prime_Minister Vladimir F . Shumeiko , a former factory director whom Yeltsin has called_on for such dirty tasks as closing_down newspapers and seeking to ban opposition parties , won the Speaker ' s post with 98 votes_in the 178-seat Federation Council . Shumeiko did not hide that he is the Russian president ' s man , commenting , &quot; It is unlikely that our relations will be complex -- Boris Yeltsin and I share the same point of view. &quot; But in the Duma , the lower chamber of Russia ' s new Parliament , it was a different story , with ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky turning the Speaker ' s race there into a parliamentary circus . At one point , when Zhirinovsky was speaking and he was interrupted by noise from the hall , he exploded , &quot; Shut up ! &quot; When Deputy Prime_Minister Anatoly B . Chubais pointed at his watch , indicating that time was up , Zhirinovsky shouted , &quot; You ' ll be showing your watch in your cell in Lefortovo ( prison ) , Mr. Chubais ! &quot; Zhirinovsky withdrew his candidacy for Speaker , although he had argued that because his party had won more votes than any other in Dec . 12 elections , the post should automatically be his . Instead , he said menacingly , he would wait for the 1996 presidential elections . By day ' s end , neither of the candidates left in the race -- which continues today -- was likely to please Yeltsin : One had led the Communist faction in the old Soviet legislature , the other was a champion weightlifter and writer who has undergone a vivid transformation from liberal to hard-line patriot . But there was good news for the Russian president . In the official count of each faction ' s membership , the pro-reform Russia ' s Choice came_out first with 76 deputies , the Itar-Tass news_agency reported . The combined opposition of Communists and Zhirinovsky ' s nationalists totaled only 163 seats , far from a majority in the 444-member body . In the more decorous Federation Council , the battle over Shumeiko ' s election laid bare the chamber ' s main division : One camp tends toward supporting Moscow and the central government , while the other leans toward regional interests . Shumeiko ' s rival , a factory chief from the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk , trailed by only two votes_in an earlier round of voting . But Shumeiko observed : &quot; We shall try not to let the elections result in a split of the chamber. &quot; Yeltsin accused the last Parliament of constantly acting to block his attempts at reforms and dissolved it on Sept . 21 . When lawmakers armed themselves and opposed him , he brought_in tanks and troops to clear their headquarters , the White_House , in fighting that killed scores of people . Nationwide balloting on Dec . 12 produced a new Russian constitution that gave the president more power and Parliament less . It also provided_for a new Parliament , known as the Federal Assembly , with the Federation Council as its upper chamber and the Duma as the lower . Shumeiko served as deputy Speaker in the old Parliament and was known as a relative moderate . After shifting from Parliament to the government , he was accused of corruption and suspended during an investigation , but beat_back the charges . The parliamentary races came amid jostling for government posts that , although going_on behind the scenes , appeared at least as critical for Russia ' s political future . * Yeltsin issued a decree on slashing the government Monday ; since then , the fate of virtually all Russian ministers has been up_in_the_air . Even economic mastermind Yegor T . Gaidar , who has plotted the course of Russia ' s reforms , had no guarantee that he would remain a deputy prime_minister , although Yeltsin has pledged that Gaidar would remain in the Cabinet . Singled_out by Russian media for probable axing was Finance_Minister Boris G . Fyodorov , an adherent of Gaidar ' s school of tight monetary policy . Although Yeltsin has vowed that reforms will continue , he has also indicated that the December election results convinced him that social spending must be increased , even if that means an increase in inflation . From a group dominated by Gaidar ' s team of young reformers , the Russian Cabinet appears likely to turn_into more of a coalition government . Despite complaints from reformers , Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin has said that he plans to retain Deputy Prime_Minister Alexander Zaveryukha , who is aligned with the pro-Communist Agrarian Party and opposes Yeltsin ' s land_reform , in his post . Chernomyrdin said that he would announce the members of the new Cabinet on Monday .</TEXT>
