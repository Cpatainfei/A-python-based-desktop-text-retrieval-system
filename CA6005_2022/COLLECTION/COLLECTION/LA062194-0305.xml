   <HEADLINE> TENDING THEIR OWN FIELD OF DREAMS ; WORLD CUP : SOCCER FANS ARE CLAMORING TO MEET THEIR HEROES IN THE MIDST OF THE MANIA . VOLUNTEERING MIGHT JUST GIVE THEM A CHANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Back when Frank Molina was a little boy with big dreams , he didn ' t ache to dribble toward the hoop like Michael Jordan or drive the long ball like any of those so-called Boys of Summer . He wanted to kick the ball just like his hero , the former soccer great , Pele . That was The Dream . Nothing less would suffice . The scene was a back-street barrio in his home country of El_Salvador , a dusty field ringed by barbed wire -- where young boys would charge the grounds after scoring a goal , shouting , &quot; I ' m Pele ! I ' m Pele ! &quot; Now , Molina , a player-coach for the student soccer team at Evans Community Adult School , might get_to shake hands with some of soccer ' s newest idols . No , his team wasn ' t unexpectedly invited to compete in the World Cup . He ' ll be a volunteer at SoccerFest , a spinoff event to be held July 8-17 at the Los Angeles Convention Center . Molina sat spellbound last week in the Downtown school ' s library as Marie Wegerle , a SoccerFest volunteer coordinator , held_up a shirt and cap commemorating what Molina considers to be simply the biggest sporting event on the planet . Wegerle was explaining to a rapt group of foreign-born students the fringe_benefits of volunteering . Several international players will attend SoccerFest , a sports fair that will allow kids to perform in such events as demonstrations and impromptu matches . The players will sign autographs for volunteers and the general public alike . Even the World Cup trophy will be_on hand . While World Cup organizers have filled countless volunteer spots for the much-anticipated games -- being held at nine cities nationwide , including the Rose Bowl in Pasadena -- there ' s still a chance to get involved with soccer-mania in Los Angeles . SoccerFest organizers need more_than 1 # 500 volunteers to work as translators , run errands , explain the sport of soccer , staff booths , run overhead_projectors and give directions . No major sports event -- not a Superbowl , Master ' s golf tournament or NBA final -- can be staged without the work of volunteers . With an international sports spectacle such_as the 1994 World Cup , there ' s a new wrinkle in the search for volunteers : organizers need people who speak English and at least one other language . In recent weeks , SoccerFest organizers have waged a billboard campaign and run ads in Spanish-language newspapers such_as La Opinion . Across the street from the Evans school , a brightly colored billboard in Spanish advertised the event to passing motorists and students . &quot; We went_to every organization we could think_of with people who might want to help , &quot; said Cynthia Burr-Larson , a volunteer coordinator for SoccerFest . &quot; That meant high_schools , local universities , churches -- any place where groups of people might have some time on their hands. &quot; At the Evans school , application_forms went as fast as Pele could score a goal off a penalty kick . &quot; Sure , I ' m going_to volunteer , &quot; said Molina , 23 . &quot; My hero is ( Diego Armando ) Maradona . He plays for Argentina . I don ' t know if he ' ll be there at SoccerFest . But I ' ll be looking_for him. &quot; * Wegerle dangled dreams in front of these soccer fans-turned-students . &quot; All of these students have just the qualities we want , &quot; said Wegerle , who has spoken_to numerous classes at Evans as well as at high_schools with large populations of Spanish-speakers . &quot; They come from all_over the world and can speak so many languages . And since they ' re just so crazy about soccer , they can bring that excitement to those who attend the event. &quot; While watching a soccer videotape showing players from different countries , two South_Korean students squealed when they spotted their country ' s flag . &quot; I don ' t know how many Americans would be so excited to see their flag , &quot; Wegerle said . &quot; For a lot of these people , soccer represents a pride of country and homeland , &quot; she added . &quot; It ' s that passion that drives the World Cup. &quot; Burr-Larson , who has made several appeals on local television , said operators have taken hundreds of calls from interested soccer fans from all walks_of_life who speak almost every language . Applicants include a man who advertised his &quot; chameleon-like abilities to greet people in many languages and customs &quot; and his &quot; specialty in rap music. &quot; Or consider the 10- and 11-year-old Russian soccer players who speak fluent Russian and Hungarian . Or the doctors and lawyers , or the professional masseuse who offered her services free_of charge . * At the Evans school library , Vietnamese immigrant Thanh Tieu sat on a table , wearing a soccer hat autographed by the entire U.S. team . Nearby , a poster advertising the slogan &quot; Read &quot; showed a young student sitting with his books in the grass , cradling a soccer_ball with his legs . &quot; In my country , we play soccer more_than basketball , &quot; the 25-year-old student said . &quot; It ' s an event when people play soccer . that ' s why I am here. &quot; For weeks , those in English as a Second Language classes at the 10 # 000-student school have wondered why Americans aren ' t as excited about the World Cup as the rest of the world . &quot; Students from every_other country say that in their homeland , soccer is No . 1 , &quot; teacher Jane Pahr said . &quot; that ' s Korea , China , Nicaragua , Guatemala , El_Salvador , Mexico , Vietnam and Thailand . &quot; They just cannot understand why the sport is so ignored in America . I mean , in Latin_America , two countries went_to_war over the sport . that ' s the weight it carries there. &quot; ( In 1969 , 2 # 000 people in Honduras and El_Salvador were killed in a brief skirmish known as the Soccer War , which was provoked by riots during a soccer tournament but grew out of border disputes and other conflicts between the two countries. ) Jenny Lew , an ESL teacher for Chinese-language students at Evans , said it ' s not just young people who are excited about the event . &quot; We have 80-year-old students from Taiwan and mainland_China who fell_in_love with soccer in their countries and who want to be part of the World Cup scene , &quot; she said . &quot; But many of them can barely speak English . It ' s heart-breaking to tell them they just don ' t have the language skills to volunteer. &quot; Molina hopes he ' ll be able to ask a professional player about the art of goal-tending -- which he calls the most demanding job in sports . &quot; The goal , it ' s so big , it ' s like an ocean to protect , &quot; he says . &quot; The thing to do is forget about its size . that ' s what makes you nervous. &quot;</TEXT>
