   <HEADLINE> TEXAS CASE LOOMS OVER PROP . 187 ' S LEGAL FUTURE ; JUSTICE : U.S. HIGH_COURT VOIDED THAT STATE ' S ' 75 LAW ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS . BUT PANEL HAS SINCE SHIFTED TO RIGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Seventeen years ago , third-grader Laura Alvarez was kicked_out of elementary_school . The Mexico City-born daughter of illegal immigrants , Laura was one of tens of thousands of youngsters to feel the consequences of a 1975 Texas law that -- like California ' s controversial Proposition 187 -- said undocumented children no longer qualified for a free public education . A few days after being expelled , Laura recalls , she was awakened by her parents and seated in their aging station_wagon for a pre-dawn ride_on the clippity-clop , red-brick streets of downtown Tyler . Their destination : the imposing Federal Courthouse , where her parents , risking immediate deportation , testified in the courtroom of Judge William Wayne Justice . The judge , acting_on a lawsuit filed by civil_rights lawyers , ordered Tyler schools Supt . James Plyler to allow undocumented students back into school . He also ordered that the identities of the 16 children named in the suit be withheld from the public to avoid possible harassment . The case , which came_to be known as Plyler vs . Doe , eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court , where , in a landmark 5-4 decision , the Texas law was declared unconstitutional . As a result of that decision , Alvarez , now 26 , was able to graduate from John_Tyler High_School in 1987 . She now works as a teacher ' s aide for the very school_system that ejected her . When California voters decide how to cast their ballots next month , the legal implications of Plyler vs . Doe will loom heavy over the ultimate fate of Proposition 187 . The California measure is far more sweeping than the Texas law . It would bar illegal immigrants from receiving non-emergency health and social_services , as well as public education , and would require school and health officials to report suspected undocumented people to federal authorities . Many of its provisions are likely to inspire court challenges , but none more clearly than the educational component . Sponsors of Proposition 187 readily acknowledge that the Supreme Court would have to revisit its 1982 decision in_order for the education ban to take_effect . A &quot; yes &quot; vote on Election_Day , they say , will pave the way for the high_court to take a second look_at the_matter . Opponents of Proposition 187 counter that its passage will serve only to ensure taxpayers a time-consuming , divisive and ultimately unsuccessful legal battle . A vote for 187 , they say , is an expensive exercise in futility . In its ruling , the Supreme Court for the first time extended the constitutional guarantee of &quot; equal protection of the law &quot; to people living_in the United States illegally . It is unjust to penalize children for the illegal actions of their parents , the court ' s majority said . And while public education is not a constitutionally granted right , it is nonetheless distinguishable from other forms of social_welfare , the justices concluded , because of &quot; the lasting impact of its deprivation on the life of the child. &quot; &quot; By denying these children a basic education , we deny them the ability to live within the structure of our civic institutions , and foreclose any realistic possibility that they will contribute in even the smallest way to the progress of our nation. &quot; Sponsors of Proposition 187 say conditions in California are different from those in Texas in the mid-1970s . Such factors , they say , will give the Supreme Court reason to ignore or reverse its previous ruling . For one thing , the magnitude of the illegal immigrant population appears greater in California . Here , the estimated number of youngsters who would be expelled exceeds 300 # 000 -- three to 30 times the number of undocumented young people that , according to various estimates , were attending school in Texas at the time . By requiring school officials to report suspected illegal immigrant students and their parents to federal authorities , the initiative also takes a step , sponsors say , toward returning students to their native_lands , where they could ostensibly complete their education . Moreover , they emphasize , the makeup of the court has shifted dramatically to the right since the 1982 decision . &quot; Only one member who voted with the majority is still there , &quot; noted Proposition 187 co-author Alan C . Nelson , a former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service . Foes of Proposition 187 retort that the court has been extremely reluctant to overturn previous rulings , especially ones decided little more_than a decade ago . Besides , they say , the measure provides no clear provisions for deportation and is far more Draconian than the unconstitutional Texas law , which allowed children to remain in public_school if they paid tuition fees . Most important , opponents add , is that the net effect of the Texas law and the ballot measure are precisely the same : to create a policy that would scapegoat children for the sins of their parents and lead to the expulsion of thousands of undocumented students . Leading constitutional law professors say the chances of the measure ' s key educational sections being upheld are slim . &quot; This court is very serious about adhering to precedent in the absence of an overwhelming reason for change , &quot; said Prof . Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law_School . However , some cautioned that the high_court ' s action is not a foregone_conclusion . &quot; There ' s always a possibility the court can simply draw_on distinctions , and say it ' s a different case in California , when anyone who looks_at it says these distinctions don ' t call_for a different result , &quot; said UCLA law professor Julian Eule . Whatever the outcome , one thing is clear -- the parameters of debate about illegal immigration have shifted markedly . When the Supreme Court issued its ruling , even the judges who dissented wrote that expelling students is &quot; senseless for an enlightened society. &quot; &quot; It would be folly -- and wrong -- to tolerate creation of a segment of society made_up of illiterate_persons , many having a limited or no command of our language , &quot; declared then-Chief Justice Warren E . Burger , in a minority opinion joined by William H . Rehnquist and Sandra Day O ' Connor , both of whom remain on the court . The California State Board_of_Education , made_up of people appointed or reappointed by Pro-187 Gov . Pete Wilson , has declined to take a stand on the ballot measure . But back when the Supreme Court was considering the Plyler case , the California board filed a legal_brief in favor of the Texas schoolchildren . &quot; It has never been demonstrated that education is more expensive than ignorance , &quot; the board wrote in 1981 . In recent times , Plyler has done some shifting himself . &quot; If we don ' t provide education , children will be a greater burden and cost more in the long_run , &quot; the retired Tyler school chief told The Times . &quot; For taxpayers , it ' s either pay me now , or pay me later. &quot; * Tyler , a sleepy , sylvan East Texas city of 75 # 000 , was home to roughly 40 undocumented youngsters back in the late 1970s . When the state law first took_effect , the city ' s school district ignored it , picking_up the cost of educating the children itself . But that policy proved short-lived . In July , 1977 , school_board members , fearing that the city would turn_into a haven for illegal immigrants , ordered them to pay $ 1 # 000 a year in tuition . The fee was tantamount_to expulsion . Most of the immigrants had jobs in Tyler foundries or restaurants , but their pay was no more_than $ 4 # 000 a year . The 1977 school_year began Aug . 31 , and Rosario Robles still recalls the rebuff she received that morning when she walked her children to school . Robles and her husband , Jose , a pipe factory employee , had lived together in Tyler for five years . Despite being undocumented , they owned their own home and paid school taxes . Yet at Bonner Elementary , they were told : No birth_certificates , no school . The principal proceeded to place Rosario Robles and five of her children in his car and drive them back home , she said . The family made immediate arrangements for some of their children to temporarily attend a parochial_school , with Jose Robles doing yardwork at the school in exchange for tuition . They also turned_to a Catholic_Church outreach worker , Michael McAndrew , who contacted local civil_rights lawyer Larry Daves . Daves , in turn , phoned the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund . Within two days , MALDEF attorney Peter D . Roos flew from San Francisco to Tyler . Working through the Labor_Day weekend , Roos filed a lawsuit on behalf of four willing families . Judge Justice scheduled a hearing for three days later and , to limit publicity , set it for 6 a.m. That morning , Lidia Lopez and her husband , Jose , packed their Dodge Monaco with all their worldly possessions for the pre-dawn drive to the courthouse , Lidia Lopez recalls . If Justice denied their suit out of hand , she says , they were prepared to be arrested and deported immediately . The four families entered the courthouse through a side_door and participated in the hearing with the translation assistance of McAndrew . Judge Justice informed the parents that he had no right to withhold their names from the U.S. Justice_Department . But department officials decided not to take action against the families so the lawsuit could proceed . Two days later , Justice granted an injunction and eventually declared that Tyler ' s application of the law violated the equal protection provisions of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution . However , the judge ' s decision applied only to the Tyler school district . So a rash of similar lawsuits were filed across the state . When a decision was made to combine these suits , Los Angeles immigration rights attorney Peter A . Schey was called_in as lead lawyer . That case was decided in the children ' s favor by a federal_district judge in Houston . At the Supreme Court level , the two cases were combined into Plyler vs . Doe . In its opinion , the high_court ruled that illegal immigrants had the right to the same education as all other Texas children . In addition , the court noted , &quot; there is no assurance that a child subject_to deportation will ever be deported. &quot; &quot; An illegal entrant might be granted federal permission to continue to reside in this country or even to become a citizen , &quot; Justice William J . Brennan Jr . wrote in the court ' s majority_opinion . Because of its focus_on the importance of education , Plyler vs . Doe has never been extended_to affect other types of benefits for illegal immigrants . It has nonetheless drawn its share of criticism . In his dissent , Burger charged that the five majority justices were engaging in policy-making rather than accepting the will of the Texas Legislature , which said its law was meant to conserve budget funds for legal residents . As long as the Legislature ' s reasoning was rational , Burger wrote , high_court justices had no jurisdiction to strike_down the law , even if , as in this case , their motives were &quot; noble and compassionate. &quot; Back in Tyler , Laura Alvarez was completing seventh grade . Immersed in school -- and having been expelled for only a handful of days years earlier -- she never even heard about the historic 1982 decision . &quot; As soon as I was back in school , &quot; she explained last week , &quot; I never thought anything more about it. &quot; * As the years went_by , the identities of the 16 Mexico-born children remained secret . Among the curious was John C . Hardy , the Tyler attorney who represented the school district before the Supreme Court . &quot; I just wonder if they made_it through school -- who graduated and what they did with the opportunity that was given to them. &quot; With names provided by Daves , The Times this month was able to track_down three of the four families and compile information on 13 of the 16 youngsters in the case . As it turns_out , 10 finished high_school in Tyler . Many have gone_on to take college courses , although none has graduated from a four-year institution . Several are single and others are married with as_many as four children . Most have full-time jobs -- two work as teacher ' s aides , two on a box factory assembly_line , and others as auto mechanic , burger stand manager , painter and stock clerk . Three are full-time housewives . Family members say all are now legal residents , mainly through the federal amnesty program of the mid-1980s . In short , the &quot; Does &quot; of Plyler vs . Doe turned_out a little like many other blue-collar schoolchildren across small-town America . &quot; Without an education , I don ' t know where I ' d be right now , &quot; reflects Alvarez , who , before being contacted by The Times , had never publicly revealed her participation in the lawsuit . &quot; I ' m a taxpayer now and you have to view everything from both sides , but if a child is denied an education , they ' re going to be a burden. &quot; Alfredo Lopez , a 1987 graduate of Tyler High , said , &quot; The only reason I got_in the automotive business is because I took automobile_mechanic courses in high_school which led to my employment. &quot; Lopez actually has two jobs -- as a Sears auto mechanic and a warehouse worker . He also has a Tyler-born wife of Mexican descent , two young children and a house with a 15-year mortgage . &quot; Alfredo is a fine young_man , &quot; said Jim Blake , his boss at Sears . &quot; He ' s very honest , an upstanding young_man in the community. &quot; Blake shudders to think what would have happened to Lopez and the others if they had been tossed_out of public_school before they were 10 years old . &quot; We have to do something to control our border , &quot; he said , &quot; but I can ' t see throwing kids on the street. &quot; Only one of the four &quot; Doe &quot; families has moved_out of Tyler , and , according to McAndrew , the children probably fared more poorly . &quot; Their mother was separated from the father and had humongous problems with welfare , &quot; McAndrew , now an immigration counselor , said . &quot; If she worked , the kids would be taken_away from her . If she didn ' t , there was not enough money . The children were very small at the time , and they had a stacked deck against them. &quot; * With the election 16 days away , Proposition 187 has become the hottest_issue in California , and the education ban is at the heart of the_matter . &quot; We ' re quite aware of Plyler and that needs to be dealt with , &quot; said former INS chief Nelson . &quot; I welcome the chance to bring these matters before the courts. &quot; To be precise , the lawsuit would be handled at taxpayers ' expense through the state_attorney general ' s office . Staffers have already spent time_studying the_matter to prepare_for an immediate blitz of lawsuits if Proposition 187 , which currently holds a solid lead in statewide polls , wins approval . Among those planning suits are Roos and Schey , the two key attorneys for the schoolchildren in Plyler vs . Doe . If the initiative passes , Schey said , &quot; the only result is that taxpayers will foot the bill for years of litigation and the chances of it ever being implemented are close to zero. &quot; * In recent years , Tyler has witnessed some of the same signs of progress and growing pains as_many other American towns . Strip malls now gather like tumbleweed on the Southeast Loop Road . Street gangs and drive-by_shootings have also come_to Tyler . Last Monday , a 17-year-old alleged gang member was found shot to death in the city ' s oldest park . It was the third gang-related killing reported in Tyler this year . Next year , Alfredo Lopez ' s young son , Michael , is_due to start kindergarten . Lopez says he is working two jobs to help scrape together the money to allow Michael to attend private_school . &quot; The public_schools have changed drastically -- there are too many students per teacher and now we have metal detectors in our schools , &quot; Alfredo said . &quot; We didn ' t have anything like that when I graduated. &quot; Still , there is no talk here of revisiting the Plyler decision . &quot; It was a landmark case , &quot; said school_board attorney Hardy , &quot; and one of the obstacles California would face is the fact that by historical standards , it happened yesterday. &quot; Over at the courthouse , Judge Justice , now nearly 75 years old , is still going strong . But Plyler vs . Doe is the last thing on his mind . &quot; It may seem like a hot new issue in California , &quot; explained Justice ' s secretary , Evelyn Armstrong . &quot; But here in Tyler , it ' s in the past. &quot; 1 ' Aye , ' 2 ' Nays ' Still on Court In its June 15 , 1982 , Plyler vs . Doe ruling , the U.S. Supreme Court struck_down as unconstitutional a 1975 Texas law that cut_off state funds for the schooling of illegal immigrants . The five justices in the majority were William J . Brennan Jr. , Thurgood Marshall , Harry A . Blackmun , John Paul Stevens and Lewis F . Powell Jr . Only Stevens remains on the court . The four dissenting judges were Chief_Justice Warren E . Burger , William H . Rehnquist , Sandra Day O ' Connor and Byron R . White . Rehnquist , now the chief_justice , and O ' Connor remain on the court .</TEXT>
