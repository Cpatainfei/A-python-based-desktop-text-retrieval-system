   <HEADLINE> TRAVEL INSIDER : NEW D-DAY INVASION BEING AIDED BY LOW-PRICE TICKETS ; FARES : MANY AIRLINES ARE OFFERING DISCOUNTS FOR VETERANS AND FAMILIES GOING TO FRANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you ' re old enough to remember 1944 and you ' re thinking about traveling_to France during this D-day anniversary year -- as thousands of veterans and others are -- you should probably also be thinking_about discounted air fares . Even though the principal dates of the Normandy invasion ' s 50th anniversary fall early in June , normally a costly travel month , Air France and British Airways are running 30 % -off D-day discount programs through that month and all_of 1994 . In both cases , travelers have a chance at LAX-Paris round-trip fares of about $ 800 in summer , about $ 700 if they can leave in April , May or October . ( After that , prices fall substantially on all carriers , along with temperatures and traffic levels. ) Some U.S. carriers are running similar programs , too , but often with lesser discounts or more limited travel dates . If you could benefit from one of these programs , it pays to ask your travel_agent or reservationist specifically about them ; they haven ' t gotten much attention . When I called American Airlines to ask about details of its offer last week , a reservationist confessed that &quot; this is the first I ' ve heard of it. &quot; There are restrictions on all these fares , of course , beginning with the usual &quot; subject_to availability &quot; clause . But most of the restrictions aren ' t too demanding , so_long as travelers qualify in the first place . It is possible that contemporary fare wars among the airlines could undercut these discount programs , yielding better prices for all travelers . Until last Friday , for instance , several airlines were offering highly restricted springtime round-trip fares for as little as $ 498 from LAX to Paris . But that was for dates of very low demand . The best regularly scheduled round-trip LAX-Paris prices will jump to the neighborhood of $ 900 beginning with June departures , and likely will remain there until demand wanes in late September . ( Those prices , and the fares quoted below , exclude $ 25- $ 30 in airport taxes on each ticket. ) Deep summer discounts are highly unlikely , which means that for those who qualify , the D-day specials may be the best deals around . Some details : The Air France offer ( tel . 800- 237-2747 ) , available throughout the year , requires that travelers show proof of World_War_II service ( generally discharge papers , separation documents or a DD-214 Form from the federal_government ) . Restrictions include 30-day advance purchase , a stay of seven to 21 days , and travel Monday-Thursday . For travel April 1-May 31 and Oct . 1-31 , the price of a round-trip LAX-Paris ticket is $ 683 ( 30 % off the starting price of $ 976 ) . From June 1 through Sept . 30 , the price is $ 771 ( 30 % off the starting price of $ 1 # 102 ) . At British Airways ( tel . 800-247-9297 ) , the D-day special is available to any traveler over 60 and one companion age 55 or older . As with Air France , the discount is 30 % from regularly scheduled prices , and could in theory be undercut by fare wars . The best fare for travel from L.A. to Paris , April 1-May 31 and Oct . 1-31 : $ 706 ( discounted from $ 1 # 006 ) ; for travel June 1-Sept . 30 , $ 792 ( discounted from $ 1 # 132 ) . Restrictions include 30-day advance purchase , a stay of seven to 21 days and travel Monday-Thursday . At American Airlines ( tel . 800- 433-7300 ) , the D-day special applies only to departures from the carrier ' s gateway cities ( Chicago , Dallas , Miami , New York and Raleigh-Durham , N.C. ) . The American offer is open_to World_War_II veterans with proof of service who can bring along up_to three immediate family members or grandchildren at the same reduced fare . As with the other programs , the American D-day special offers 30 % off on selected fares throughout 1994 , but the numbers don ' t pencil out as affordably as the European carriers ' do . For a round-trip_ticket to Paris from Dallas ( the nearest American gateway to Southern California ) between April 1 and May 31 , America ' s best D-day-discounted fare is $ 796 . From June 1 to Sept . 30 , the figure rises to $ 916 . Restrictions include seven-day advance purchase , a stay of seven to 180 days and travel Monday-Thursday . Delta Airlines ( tel . 800-241-4141 ) opens its D-day offer to Word War II veterans ( or their widows ) and three immediate family members -- but isn ' t offering its best discount during the most-sought months of June to September . Delta ' s best D-day rate is $ 683 , for travel May 1-31 and Oct . 1-31 . Restrictions include 14-day advance purchase , stay of seven to 60 days , travel Monday-Thursday . Delta ' s other D-day offer , good for restricted round-trip travel from LAX to Paris or Nice from April 1 to Dec . 17 , is $ 1 # 016 . At TWA ( tel . 800-892-4141 ) , the D-day discount fares , available to WWII veterans and up_to three family members , begin at $ 866 for travel April 1-May 31 and Oct . 1-31 ( restrictions include seven-day advance purchase , stay of seven to 90 days , and travel Monday-Thursday ) , and $ 969 for travel June 1-Sept . 30 . Reservationists at Continental , Northwest , United , USAir , Virgin Atlantic and Lufthansa said their airlines had no D-day discounts to France now available .</TEXT>
