   <HEADLINE> INTERVIEW ; MEET OUR NEWEST INTERVIEWER ; HOW DO YOU INTERVIEW A GUY WHO ' S MADE A CAREER OF TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF ? EASY -- LET SPALDING GRAY INTERVIEW SPALDING GRAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In his tale of an eye operation and the events leading_up to it , actor Spalding Gray ' s latest monologue &quot; Gray ' s Anatomy &quot; -- his 14th -- continues his tradition of turning the particulars of_his_own life into epic storytelling . Beginning this week , the 52-year-old actor best known for his monologues-turned-films &quot; Swimming to Cambodia &quot; ( 1987 ) and &quot; Monster in a Box &quot; ( 1992 ) brings &quot; Gray ' s Anatomy &quot; to Los Angeles , Santa Barbara and Irvine . He can also be seen in the recently released film &quot; The Paper &quot; and is currently filming in &quot; Beyond , &quot; starring Rosanna Arquette and directed by John Boorman . Because talking_about himself is something he does so well -- and so often -- and because he says he has become exhausted by the repetitiveness of being interviewed by journalists , we asked Gray to try something different : We invited him to interview himself , to ask himself the questions he ' s never been asked . He agreed to the task , but responded that he couldn ' t think_of any question that he had never been asked_in an interview . &quot; I just started with the most often asked question , and the rest just followed , &quot; he told us when he turned_in a 60-minute tape . What follows is a transcript of that tape , which Gray says has triggered him to begin thinking in terms of a new book called &quot; Talking to Myself. &quot; Question : we ' ll begin with the first question . What do you call what you do ? I mean for work . Are you a monologuist ? A performer ? A performance artist ? A storyteller ? What ? Answer : The definition that I like the most for what I do came from a 10-year-old girl who I saw hanging_around after one of my shows . And being surprised by how young she was I questioned , &quot; What are you doing here ? &quot; And she said , &quot; My dad said I had to come and see the talking man. &quot; I liked that definition . I ' m the man who sits behind a table and tells true stories from his life . I ' m also an actor . I was trained as an actor at Emerson College and I use that training to play myself . With the help of my director , Renee Shafransky , I split myself in two and take the memory of myself in the past and develop that self as a character . For instance , most of the events in my new monologue titled &quot; Gray ' s Anatomy &quot; took_place two or three years ago . I ' m not in that same emotional or physical situation , so like any actor I have to recall and re-create a role . I ' m like an introverted Method actor in that way . * Q : Let me stop you again and just ask you how you came_into this form . As a child , were you exposed to storytellers in your family ? A : No , no , just the opposite . There were no stories -- nope , just the opposite . There were no stories , no personal historic narrative . I ' m from New England and everything there gets kind of swept under the rug , so I think I began to talk in reaction to that . I was talking in reaction to repression . I can remember once some years back I was doing a taped interview with my father , trying to find_out some facts about my personal history -- you know , trying to find_out who I was and how I came_to be whatever it is I am -- it was a kind of identity search and one question I asked him was &quot; Why , out of his three sons , was I the only one that was not circumcised ? &quot; And his response was , &quot; Oh , you ' re not ? &quot; * Q : Just tell me , briefly , how you came_into the theatrical form . A : Well , when I first came_to New York City in 1967 , I joined up with Richard Schechner ' s Performance Group -- where we worked in the Performing Garage in SoHo . We worked_on making our own group pieces through improv so we all had a chance to be both actors and the creators of what it was we were making ( although Schechner might have referred to it as performance , I still think_of it as acting ) . It was a very whole full kind of acting that bordered_on music and dance because it employed our whole bodies and voices . But I ' m sorry , let me get_to the point or at least the point of your question . The most important part of that experience for me came during a production of our first piece called &quot; Commune. &quot; That was an environmental theater piece with no fixed seating . The audience just sat on risers and platforms all around us . There was a lot of audience participation in this piece -- we called it a piece , not a play , because it really wasn ' t a well-made play -- so there was a lot of audience participation built into the work -- when the action stopped -- we ' d go directly into the audience and involve them in some way , we had to interact with them . So there was this one section in the piece about death and dying and Richard asked all_of us , I think there were eight in the cast , to go_into the audience and chose one person to deliver a personal story to about death . I know this sounds strange now but in those days most of the audience was wide open_to this , wide open_to this kind of encounter . I mean , they were consistently receptive . So each night I would go_out and find someone -- I think it was almost always a woman -- and I would tell the story of how when I was in Mexico in 1967 my mother killed herself by starting_up my father ' s car and asphyxiating herself in the garage . And the story I told was of my return home and all_the details I remembered that grew out of that traumatic return . And those details were etched in my memory and I could see it all like a film in my head as I spoke it . This really was my first monologue . It was hardly performed at all , just spoken directly into the eyes of a stranger -- well , not quite a stranger , a member of our audience . This event was extremely powerful for me -- for at least two reasons . One was that it helped me to break_through my fear of looking directly at the audience -- you see every actor , in film or stage is never , or rarely , allowed to do that , so that produces , of course , a great desire to break that taboo and have direct contact with the eyes of the viewer -- at least that was true for me . And the experience was very powerful . It changed the whole way I thought_about theater . I was no longer just interested in looking_at my fellow actors on stage , I was now yearning to relate to the audience . The other powerful thing that happened in that event was the fact that I was publicly breaking the taboo around my mom ' s suicide . It was never openly known that she had killed herself . It was all sort of covered_up -- the shame . Her obituary just read Margaret Elizabeth Horton Gray , deceased . And then , of course , there were rumors as there are always rumors when you don ' t tell the whole truth . There were rumors that she died of cancer . So for me it was so important to set the story straight . You know , tell it right . Also , it was very important for me to tell the story in_order to heal myself through the telling -- you know , to try to make_sense of it . It was a way both of mourning her and accepting the gigantic horror of the event . I can see that you want to ask another question so just let me finish by telling you that this one event liberated me in such a way that by 1967 I had co-founded the Wooster Group with Elizabeth LeCompte and we created a piece together called &quot; Rumstick Road &quot; -- this piece of theater was a most powerful alchemistic event for me -- and opened the door to my monologues . I haven ' t got time to tell you about that piece in any detail , nor could I capture it in words -- it was for me a true theatrical masterpiece . But one thing I want to point_out is that it led me on to taking myself as a character . At the very beginning of it I would step_forward and speak directly to the audience , and I would say , &quot; My name is Spalding Gray , Spud , Spud Gray , &quot; so that it was clear that I was playing myself and also Elizabeth LeCompte was directing me to play myself , or at least a theatrical aspect of me . It was she and the Wooster Group that taught me that ability to split myself and play certain aspects of myself exactly like an actor would play a character or role . And of course the monologues grew out of that . * Q : Speaking of directors , don ' t you work with Renee Shafransky as a director now ? A : Yes , Renee directed my last two monologues , &quot; Monster in a Box &quot; and &quot; Gray ' s Anatomy. &quot; And she has been invaluable to me . She ' s worked not only as a director but as a co-creator . Much of the consciously written parts of &quot; Gray ' s Anatomy &quot; are hers . I don ' t do actual writing , I just talk -- and Renee supplied some actual writing to the piece . Let me make you aware , in case you ' re not , that none of my monologues are previously written . I ' m an oral writer and I ' ve evolved all my monologues from the beginning in front of an audience . Because Renee and I have lived together for so_long , she has always been around that evolution and I ' d always be listening to her feedback -- she was a kind of psychic mirror for me , I mean she perceived me often like a character and would reflect that back to me . And this worked very well because she not only has a fine eye for directing , but because she is also a good writer with a concentration on screenplays . Really , from early on , Renee had a lot of input to the monologues . So , of course , it was only natural for her to become the director . * Q : Please tell me just a little of how you work together , say in the development of &quot; Gray ' s Anatomy. &quot; A : Working from my outline I start first with a linear recollection . All that I remember about the events as well as all_the other associative personal stories that grow_up around that event . And I tell that to my first audience . I make tape_recordings of these early performances . Then Renee and I sit_down and work with those tapes . Like you ' d work with any text . We begin to make a dramatic structure together . I ' d give you examples of that but I don ' t want to give_away the stories in &quot; Gray ' s Anatomy. &quot; You can see and enjoy that for yourself . Just suffice it to say that we make dramatic changes based on original truths . We use hyperbole and rearrangement of the way events occur in time . So together we evolve the monologue into a well-structured lyrical dramatic piece . that ' s where it is now . And , of course , it ' s never finished until I stop performing it . It ' s always open and flexible . Renee is also directing me all_the time to play myself as I was three years ago when most of the events took_place . This works very well because Renee lived through those events with me and has her own memory of them . So it is in fact two personal_memories interacting . And that really makes &quot; Gray ' s Anatomy &quot; so_much more complex . It makes_it much more_than a solo work . I may be performing but Renee ' s presence -- it is completely interwoven in that performance . I really don ' t know how I would make a monologue without her . The other wonderful thing that has grown out_of_working with Renee as a director is that it has reconnected me with the ability to take direction as a film actor . It ' s also freed Renee up_to direct other actors in more traditional plays , which she is doing right now . * Q : Please tell us something about your film work , I mean other_than the films you have made of your monologues . But first , one question before you answer that . Why do you think &quot; Swimming to Cambodia &quot; works so well as a film ? Why would an audience want to see a film of one man talking ? A : Well , first of all I was lucky to work with a very talented director , Jonathan Demme . That made a world of difference . But in all humility I have to say &quot; Swimming to Cambodia &quot; was a radical breakthrough in film because it was so relentlessly minimal . And I think it worked because your regular film audience comes_into the theater with expectations of imagery . And you have to understand there is a certain audience that will not go see a live show . They feel more comfortable in movie_theaters because that ' s where they ' ve been going all their lives ; they just haven ' t been accustomed to going_to the theater . So there ' s a whole new audience there that would n ' t have come_to see me live . Now they ' re coming_to see a movie , and what makes a good movie is imagery . Of course text is important but when we think_of film we usually think_of images . And in the case of &quot; Swimming , &quot; I was creating the image with words through my performance and gesture . This throws the audience back on_their_own imaginations . They have to interact with their own personal images which I am provoking and are constantly growing out of my narrative . In other words , most films literalize reality into a selected image . What I was doing , and am still doing , is close to what I grew_up with as a kid , radio , good old radio . Oh , how I loved it because I could create my own image of what was not seen but only heard . We did not have a TV in our home until I was 11 years old . So I had all those years of &quot; Ozzie and Harriet &quot; on radio first , and I created Ozzie and Harriet ' s house in my mind , as well as David and Rick and Ozzie and Harriet . I mean , just think_of the name Ozzie , what does that do to you ? Doesn ' t it tickle your imagination ? What image do you have of an Ozzie ? Radio allowed me to be a creator and TV stole that creation from me by literalizing and to some extent limiting my vision . Suddenly we had their house as chosen and given by a TV production company . The audience seeing &quot; Swimming &quot; has to make their own images and I think on the whole they like that . I mean , for many people it ' s a new experience , particularly for the younger audience . The other wonderful aspect of &quot; Swimming &quot; being made into a film had to do with the fact that much of the narrative in the monologue was about the making of a film -- &quot; The Killing Fields. &quot; So then when the monologue became a film it was wonderfully self-reflective in its medium -- celluloid commenting on celluloid -- it became a film talking_about a film ; it became a lovely satellite to the original planet , &quot; The Killing Fields. &quot; And so I see them as two films spinning around each other . At best they should be seen together as a unit work_of_art . * Q : Now would you mind saying a_few words about your more commercial film work ? A : When people used to ask me why I got involved with Hollywood films , I would say jokingly that it was for the health_insurance . Then I thought that the powers that be in Hollywood got_wind of that and decided to play a sick_joke on me . In my paranoid mind I thought they said , &quot; All right . He ' s doing_it for the health_insurance ? Well , then , let ' s cast him as a doctor for the rest of his life. &quot; And they started casting me as doctors . But that seems to be over now and things are looking brighter . First of all , I want to say I have no complaints about my experiences with commercial films . I ' ve had nothing but good experiences and I ' m very happy that my film work has become even more interesting and creative for me lately . I seem to be moving away from the doctors and into a more varied world of characters . And I really do see myself as having the potential of becoming a very good character_actor . Most recently I ' ve had the good_fortune of acting in a number of good projects . Those were &quot; King of the_Hill , &quot; &quot; The Tool Shed &quot; ( not yet released ) , &quot; The Paper , &quot; and now I ' m blessed to be working with John Boorman on his latest project , which has the potential of being as powerful and as historically revelatory as &quot; The Killing Fields. &quot; Working with Steven Soderbergh on his film &quot; King of the_Hill &quot; was particularly important for me , first of all because he chose me -- I was his first choice -- that had never happened to me before . I always felt , you know , easily replaced or expendable or that they were just casting me for my WASP patrician look . Steven didn ' t even screen_test me , we just ate lunch together in New York City at Jerry ' s and he told me he chose me to play the role of Mr. Mungo from reading my novel &quot; Impossible Vacation &quot; and immediately I thought , &quot; What an interesting way to cast someone in a film -- to be cast through my writing. &quot; Steven said he saw my &quot; character &quot; of Brewster North in my autobiographic novel as a man being ruled by regret , which for him was the key to Mr. Mungo ' s character . The other important thing that happened in that film was that Steven and the role allowed me to express my sense of deep sadness . In my own monologue work I see myself as a humorist and at the bottom of all humorists you will almost always find a deep well of sadness . In my monologues I feel often under some pressure to make the audience laugh -- although , don ' t get me wrong , I enjoy that , but Steven allowed my sadness to surface publicly for the first time . Previous to that most Hollywood casting agents only reacted to my kind of WASP exterior . But Steven and his casting director Deborah Aquila saw something else under that image , and he went_for it , and so did I . Also that film was strongly connected to my autobiography , and I think that always helps an actor find his or her personal line to a role . If you haven ' t seen &quot; King of the_Hill , &quot; and you should , you can see it on video now . The character I play , Mr. Mungo , ends_up committing suicide . This was a very powerful scene for me because it was shot in the summer which was the time my mother had killed herself in 1967 , at age 52 . And I was just approaching 52 , and all these fears were surfacing that I would somehow repeat that act in_order to join her wherever she was -- that she was pulling me to her through suicide . You see , my mother actually told me a year before she killed herself how she planned to do_it . And I didn ' t take her seriously . And I did not take any action to warn my father to please hide the keys to the car , just keep them out_of_sight . Then a year later , while I was spending the summer in Mexico , she did exactly what she said she wanted to do . She got_up in the night while my father and younger brother were asleep and went_out into the garage and started_up the car and that was it . I returned from Mexico to find that she was only ashes in an urn in a cardboard box beside my father ' s bed . So there I was , years later , at almost 52 years old , getting_to create my own suicide . The scene took all day to shoot , starting with the very realistic makeup job of slit wrists complete with dried blood running_out of the wounds and down my hand . The odd thing about this choice of suicide in the film was that it had fit right into some recent pre-film fantasies I had had of how I would do_it -- how I would commit suicide in real_life . They were only fantasies , mind you , and still it was very present in my consciousness and it was most present when I was performing my monologues in Taos , N.M. , and staying_at a hotel in town -- there was a very large outdoor Jacuzzi and I was thinking the way I ' d do_it would be to take a good dose of Quaaludes , then take a very sharp straight-edged razor and get_into that tub until I reached a state of complete relaxation -- a state I ' ve hardly ever known in my sober life before , and then just draw that razor down both wrists and lie back in my own hot blood and expire . Of course at the time I was aware that this was only a fantasy -- I didn ' t own a straight-edged razor nor did I have any Quaaludes -- still it was a very intense one that kept coming_back on me . And in the end I thought the combination of the hot tub and the Quaaludes would make me feel so good , so relaxed , that I ' d just give_up on the razor and relax and live . Then it all was just a_few months later that I was in Steven ' s film and it was not a hot tub but just a hotel_room in which I was doing the slashing . But there was the straight-edged razor right on the sink , and me with my wrists looking exactly like they ' d been slashed . And there I had to sit for hours , slumped over that sink while special_effects had to create a condition where the blood and water from the sink overflowed and ran_along the floor and out under the door where Aaron , the young boy that Mungo had befriended , discovered and followed it to the ultimate horrible image of my body slumped over the sink -- or Mungo ' s body -- which for me at the time were interchangeable . This is a very powerful scene for me because of all_the associations of mixed identification . I was me , Mungo and my mom , as well as Aaron finding me / Mom in Mungo . It was also very illuminating for me because I was forced to sit there for so_long and stare at all that mess the blood made , and it made me realize what a selfish , horrible mess a suicide is for those who have to deal with it and clean it up . Then one of those strange behind-the-scenes events occurred which I always love . It ' s as though doing a film often provokes a film reality in me that I carry_off the location , and in this case this was an extreme and perfect example of it . I was in a real rush to catch a flight out that night because Renee and I had rented a nice and expensive house in the Hamptons for the month of August and because of the film I had spent very little time there and it looked_like we might not finish the suicide scene in time for me to catch my flight due_to the fact that the crew had to set_up and re-light for my last scene in which they carry my body out covered by a sheet on a stretcher . So I asked Steven if there was any way they could use a stand-in or , in this case maybe they call it a &quot; lie-in &quot; for me . And Steven half-jokingly and half-seriously said , &quot; What , Spalding , don ' t you want to be in my movie ? &quot; I laughed ( a little ) and said , &quot; All right , Steven . I ' ll do_it if you ' ll let me run back to the hotel , pack my bag and check_out so I ' ll be all ready to go straight to the airport. &quot; And to my amazement he agreed . So out I headed dressed in this 1929 outfit with an ashen white face , slit wrists and dried blood streaming down my hands . The hotel was only a_few blocks from the location and to my amazement I got there without turning a single head . The only person that reacted to me was a homeless_person asking_for change in front of the post_office . As soon as he saw me coming , he ran . Then checking_out of the hotel the woman at the front desk , knowing I was an actor in a film , asked me how the film was going and I just lifted my slit wrists and she , fully in control because she was aware that I was , after all really just an actor and this reality was all part of the film , and she said , &quot; Oh , gross-out ! &quot; No , that was not enough for me . I just had the strong urge not to leave that hotel until I affected someone in some real way . So feeling_like a little kid at Halloween I proceeded diabolically toward the hotel pharmacy and upon entering discovered it empty except for a woman who was behind the counter filling prescriptions . She was just about my mother ' s age when my mother had killed herself and I just walked right up_to the counter and with my sleeves rolled_up held_up my slit wrists and said , &quot; Do you have anything for my wounds ? &quot; She turned as pale as I was and staggered back and , grasping one of the medicine_cabinets to steady herself , she sputtered , &quot; We have Mercurochrome. &quot; And that ' s when I knew she was in shock . Mercurochrome , I thought , that fits right in with the period of the movie . Iodine , maybe , but Mercurochrome ? Then as she rushed to get_it , she said , &quot; Whatever happened to you ? &quot; And I said , &quot; Oh , I just slit my wrists. &quot; It was only then that I pulled_out of this bizarre diabolical reality I ' d created and realized I was re-enacting yet another aspect of the whole suicide scene . I was casting this poor pharmacy prescription filler as my mother and in my own strange dramatic way was saying , &quot; Look , Mom , I can do_it too ! &quot; As soon as I had that realization I was all apologies and told her I was only an actor working_on a film nearby . Then I fled out of shame , leaving her in a state I will never know . Later I thought it was a wonder the whole event didn ' t provoke her to have a heart_attack . It was all a very odd event , and one I ' m not proud_of . It was a very clear and weird case of what would be called , I suppose , &quot; acting out. &quot; Well , I ' ve always had a problem with boundaries and that day I just overflowed . that ' s the end of the answer . * Q : Did you make your flight back to New York that night ? A : No , I didn ' t . * Q : I just have two more questions . A : Oh , too_bad . I was hoping we could go_on a little longer . * Q : Well , I ' d love to but I ' m afraid we have to wrap it up . You have to realize this is for the L.A. Times , which is only a newspaper , and you talk like a book . A : OK , shoot . What are the last two questions ? * Q : I ' ll be brief . The question is : Can you think_of a director you ' d like to work with on a particular film project ? And what would that project be ? A : that ' s a tough one . I ' d love to work with Jodie Foster , Jane Campion , Jonathan Demme , Stephen Frears . I ' d very much like to work with Peter Weir , I ' d love to work with Ron Howard and Steven Soderbergh again , as well as Renee Shafransky . I mean , there are so many fine and talented directors out there to work with . But as for projects , that ' s a whole other story . that ' s a tough one . I just don ' t think I ' m ethnic enough . I mean , who wants to do a story about an existential uptight doubting New Englander ? I suppose I might fit into an Updike story , I might be perfect for that . But look who they cast in the last one , &quot; The Witches of Eastwick. &quot; Hah , not a chance for me there . Oh , that reminds me of a story about another talented director , Paul Mazursky . I was working with him on &quot; The Pickle , &quot; playing yet another doctor , and I was hanging_out in my dressing room receiving lessons from a real doctor on how to give Danny Aiello a realistic blood_pressure workup , and Paul burst into my dressing room with that enthusiastic way he has . He was_on his break and he came_in with all this energy and enthusiasm and said , &quot; You know , Spalding , I had forgotten that you are a really good actor . I keep thinking_of you as a storyteller . But you ' re also a great actor . In fact , I think you ' d be perfect to play the role of John Cheever when someone at last makes the John Cheever story. &quot; I said , &quot; Right on ! Sure ! You direct it and see if you can raise the money on my name playing a very talented complex depressed drunken bisexual writer living_on the Hudson_River . That one is sure to capture the hearts and imaginations of America. &quot; Anyway , let me finish by telling you , I do have one fantasy project and that is to play opposite Madonna in the remake of &quot; The Blue Angel. &quot; * Q : OK . Wonderful . Now for the last question . Back to your own work for this one . I noticed that you work a lot out of fear . What is your big one ? What is your big fear ? A : My big fear is that I lack the courage it takes_to live a real_life . And by that I mean to really sit in it , feel and be in it . To dive into life , if you know what I mean . I ' m afraid I treat life too_much like theater . I frame it in a story and run from frame to frame . I ' m always controlling it , I ' m always creating it . The shadow side of my art_form is that I ' m so good at storytelling that I can now tell the story before I have the feeling . Storytelling can become a defense against just feeling and being , a defense against living . I ' ll give you an example and we ' ll end with that . Last summer Renee and I were at a Lincoln Center after-show party at Tavern on the Green . I had been Upstate and traveled in to meet her there . I thought I ' d be late for the show because I ' d encountered a_couple_of accidents along the way -- one was_on the highway and had held_up traffic for quite a while ; the other was_on Metro North , some minor derailment problem . Anyway , I made_it on_time after all . And as we were leaving the party Renee and I caught a cab just outside Tavern on the Green . We were pulling_out of the parking_lot and there was a three-car collision on Central_Park West right in front of us . It was a real mess . And one of the vehicles was an open jeep , and this poor_man had cracked the windshield with his head and he was rocking back and forth in shock and pain . And as soon as Renee saw that she burst into tears . And I immediately said , &quot; Wow , that ' s the third accident I ' ve encountered today. &quot; I just neatly fit it into my ongoing narrative . I ' m working a little bit on all that in therapy now -- how to make a crack in the narrative to let the feelings in . It takes a good therapist to do that because there ' s nothing people love more_than a good_story and we all just want it to go_on and on and on . * Gray will perform &quot; Gray ' s Anatomy &quot; at UCLA ' s Wadsworth Theatre Wednesday through Saturday at 8 p.m. , UCSB ' s Campbell Hall , April 27-28 8 p.m. and Irvine Barclay Theatre May 1 , 3 p.m. &quot; Gray ' s Anatomy &quot; is available in paperback by Vintage .</TEXT>
