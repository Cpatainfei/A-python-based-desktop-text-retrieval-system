   <TEXT> SIMPLE PASSION by Annie Ernaux , translated from the_French by Tanya Leslie ( Ballantine : $ 8.50 ; 64 pp. ) . A bestseller in France , Annie Ernaux ' s novella explores the emotions of a sophisticated woman involved with a married_man . The unnamed narrator savors her passion , but never loses sight of its transitory nature : &quot; From the very beginning , and throughout the whole of our affair , I had the privilege of knowing what we all find_out in the end : the man we love is a complete stranger. &quot; This elegantly Gallic reflection on the nature of love suggests an upper-class restatement of Edith Piaf ' s &quot; No , Je ne regrette rien. &quot;</TEXT>
