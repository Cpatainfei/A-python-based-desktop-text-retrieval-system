   <TEXT> People like to huddle after an earthquake . And last Friday , the Fashion Circle of the Costume Council of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art didn ' t miss a hug in its scheduled dinner and dancing party at Chasen ' s . The evening honored Gloria Vanderbilt , who came from New York and one of the East ' s worst winters ever . Circle chairwoman Donna Wolff tried to explain the ambience : &quot; It ' s just that people were so ecstatic to be alive . There was so_much electricity in the air . People came_out in spite of the broken china and crystal . We actually had very few no-shows. &quot; By Monday , the atmosphere was calmer as more_than 700 filled the museum ' s Bing Auditorium for &quot; Yesterday , Today and Tomorrow , &quot; a video documentary about Vanderbilt by her 26-year-old-son , Anderson Cooper , a Yale graduate and film_producer . Then , over tea and sandwiches in the museum atrium , everyone compared quake experiences . The video charts Vanderbilt ' s life from her lonely childhood and the media blitz surrounding the transfer from her mother ' s custody to that of her aunt . It depicts her passion for art and her love for writing . ( Her new novel is &quot; The Memory Book of Starr Faithful , &quot; about a young_woman sexually abused by a politician. ) The documentary ends with her son ' s question : &quot; What do you consider your greatest accomplishment ? &quot; An adoring mother smiles . &quot; You. &quot; Vanderbilt first gained fame when her father died before her birth , later in the child-custody case and , then , on_her_own , as a socialite who designed the Gloria Vanderbilt jeans , fabrics , china and perfumes . She ' s always in social photos , and a large crowd wanted to see her Friday and Monday . What they found was a fresh , open , kind woman who says she &quot; would have been happy living in a white_house with a picket_fence and just being loved by my family. &quot; At the museum , Vanderbilt ' s entourage included New Yorker Phyllis Adams Jenkins , arm in arm with Carol Matthau , wife of actor Walter , and one of Gloria ' s best_friends . The three women made their debuts in almost the same year in New York . As they say , they &quot; came out. &quot; But Matthau ' s debut party was canceled because it fell on the day the Japanese bombed Pearl_Harbor , on Dec . 7 , 1941 . She lamented : &quot; And Errol Flynn was going_to jump_out of the bandbox ! &quot; On Monday , a cloudy day , Bonnie Black was regal in a fox-trimmed raincoat . Sally Cobb , former owner of the old Brown Derby , greeted Vanderbilt . Wolff and Mary Martin , Costume Council program chairwoman , were by her side . More clustering around were fashion doyen Eleanore Phillips Colt , photographer Jean Howard and Heather Shuemaker . David Gill Evans recalled sitting with Vanderbilt at the Hollywood Bowl when she was married to conductor Leopold Stokowski . At the black-tie party at Chasen ' s , the crowd included Jane and Steve Ackerman , Hugh and Lynn Evans , Richard and Sally Mogan , Hal and Eunice David , and George and Betsy Link . Monday evening , Bea Arthur hosted a dinner_party for Vanderbilt and guests , including Bob and Bea Scott , Norman and Lyn Lear , the Matthaus and psychiatrist Andrew Slaby , Vanderbilt ' s escort . Cooper commented on his mother : &quot; I am very proud_of her . She is actually the most amazing person I have ever met. &quot; Pretty nice , from a son . * Canceled : The Blue_Ribbon event with former President Richard Nixon at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace was canceled last Wednesday because of the earthquake .
