   <HEADLINE> SHUTTLE ANIMALS DISEMBARK AFTER SMOOTH SUNRISE LANDING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> NASA officials hustled thousands of small animals off Columbia on Saturday after the shuttle ' s smooth sunrise landing concluded America ' s longest space flight in more_than 20 years . It was the end of the line for the two surviving adult newts -- dissections were planned by researchers eager to see the anatomical effects of 15 days of weightlessness . A longer , brighter future awaited the four guppylike Japanese Medaka fish . They are headed back to Japan in a_few weeks to live_out their lives and continue to mate , under scientific scrutiny , as biologists look_for any lingering effects of spaceflight . Commander Robert Cabana guided Columbia to a touchdown at 3:38 a.m. PDT after a voyage of 236 orbits , or 6.1 million miles . A one-day landing delay caused by offshore storms Friday gave Columbia and its crew of seven the shuttle endurance record -- 14 days and nearly 18 hours . The previous record was 14 days , 13 minutes , set by another Columbia crew last fall . It also made Japanese astronaut Chiaki Mukai the world ' s female space-endurance champ . The all-time records of 84 days on NASA ' s Skylab in 1973-74 and 366 days on Russia ' s Mir space_station in 1987-88 -- as well as the runners-up -- are held by men . In addition to Cabana and Mukai , Columbia ' s crew included co-pilot James Halsell , flight_engineer Carl Walz and mission specialists Don Thomas , Richard Hieb and Leroy Chiao . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ' s next shuttle mission , an Earth-monitoring flight by Endeavour , is scheduled for next month .</TEXT>
