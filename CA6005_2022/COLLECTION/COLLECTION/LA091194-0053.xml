   <TEXT> In terms of simle , flat-out fright , Steven Spielberg ' s 1982 Poltergeist ( KTLA Sunday at 6 p.m. ) gives full value . However , it ' s a case of a credibility-defying story weighed_down by lavish special_effects . Craig T . Nelson and JoBeth Williams are a likable couple who move_into a nice tract house with their kids , only to be confronted with supernatural terrors . On stage Robert Harling ' s Steel Magnolias ( CBS Sunday at 8:30 p.m. ) was a highly effective play about the lives of several women who are all customers of a small-town Louisiana beauty_parlor . But when it reached the screen in 1989 it was crushed by too many stars , several of whom were miscast ; however , it did manage to launch Julia Roberts ' career as the fragile daughter of Sally Field . So many movies portray business sharks as unregenerate killjoys that the freshest aspect of the 1991 Other People ' s Money ( NBC Sunday at 9 p.m. ) is the zest with which Danny DeVito plays a Wall_Street liquidator . DeVito ' s character zeros_in on a feisty Gregory Peck ' s Rhode Island-based New England Wire &amp; Cable Co . Unfortunately , this shark is too_much of the ' 80s to work in the recession-ravaged ' 90s . Director Penelope Spheeris ' satirical edge helped turn the 1992 Wayne ' s World ( NBC Tuesday at 8 p.m. ) , an extended &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; skit , into a 1992 hit . As a_couple_of high_school dudes who broadcast a public-access cable show from an Aurora , Ill. , basement recreation_room , Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are hilarious . Internal Affairs ( CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m. ) has an intriguing but unfortunately misfired premise : a young cop ( Andy Garcia ) becomes obsessed with the crooked officer ( Richard Gere ) he ' s intent_on nailing . The Heist ( KCOP Friday at 8 p.m. ) , a standard-issue 1989 cable movie in which ex-con Pierce Brosnan exacts revenge from a double-crossing ex-partner . The mystery is just mediocre in Ray Alexander : A Taste for Justice ( NBC Friday at 9 p.m. ) , which first aired last May . Louis Gossett Jr . proves a commanding reason to keep watching , cast as a hole-in-the-wall restaurateur who does some private investigating on the side . James Coburn plays a high-powered attorney who wants Gossett ' s Alexander to meet an unjustly accused client . Roland Joffes 1986 The Mission ( KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m. ) is a ponderous , pretentious allegory about an 18th-Century Jesuit mission in the Brazilian jungle , menaced by greed and politics . Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons star . Teen Wolf ( ABC Saturday at 8 p.m. ) , a monstrously unfunny 1985 comedy of modern-day lycanthropy , stars Michael J . Fox .</TEXT>
