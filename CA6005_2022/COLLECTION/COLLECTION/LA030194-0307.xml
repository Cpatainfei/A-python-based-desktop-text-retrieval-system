   <TEXT> The words of the founder remain true . &quot; We have remade this country with automobiles , &quot; Henry_Ford wrote in 1926 . &quot; But we do not have these automobiles because we are prosperous . We are prosperous because we have them. &quot; The automobile has been an industrial and a social revolution rolled into one ; its importance transcends categorization . It has employed people and improved them . From the start , when Ford hired unskilled immigrant workers to produce his Model T , right through to the present when one job in six in the United States , Japan and Western Europe is linked to the automobile , the car has been an economic and social engine . Auto workers bought cars and houses and educations for their children . The auto industry drove science and technology , spurring knowledge of power and propulsion , metallurgy and manufacturing . And it created highways and suburbs and new kinds of cities . It raised living standards in the United States and other countries . And more recently it has brought all those wonders to new countries . South_Korean farm_boys fresh from the fields now are capable of fashioning Hyundai cars -- and the engines and computer chips that power them . Chinese , Indian , Russian and Indonesian farmers are learning to do likewise . The revolution continues . Yet a successor to Henry_Ford , like many Americans now frustrated by clogged freeways , had forgotten that when he met a boss of the Soviet_Union in the 1970s . Robert S . McNamara , former secretary_of_defense and former head of Ford Motor Co. , was president of the World_Bank when he visited Moscow for the first time and met with the late Leonid I . Brezhnev . The Soviet_Union , then as always , was struggling to create a civilian economy . But McNamara opened the conversation by telling Brezhnev how pleasant it was that Moscow streets were relatively free_of traffic . The Soviets could &quot; avoid the problems of the automobile , &quot; McNamara said sunnily . * In reply , Brezhnev slapped his desk for emphasis and growled : &quot; We must have an automobile industry. &quot; The Russian had it right , perhaps because he recalled a visit by Soviet emissaries to Henry_Ford in the 1920s . They wanted Ford to build tractors in the Soviet_Union -- tractors , not cars , because they did not need &quot; luxury &quot; goods just yet . &quot; The car is not a luxury , &quot; Ford told them . &quot; You ought to buy automobiles and get your people used to machinery and moving about with some freedom . The motor car will bring roads and then it will be possible to get the products of your farms to the cities. &quot; The Soviets never got the crops to town , probably because they did not share Ford ' s belief in the importance of &quot; freedom. &quot; Perhaps the Russians will . It should be understood that Ford did not invent the car . He invented a process for making cars called the assembly_line that profoundly affected labor relations the world over . In a similar way in 1949 , Taiichi Ohno , a Toyota production engineer , concentrated_on what workers did to invent a system_called lean production that improved upon Ford ' s assembly_line . Ford ' s insight was that through interchangeable parts he could reduce the time and cost of the craft system in which a skilled artisan assembled most of an automobile . It took more_than 12 hours of work to make a car that way . Ford ' s assembly_line , in which each worker performed only a single task , reduced that to 1 1 / 2 hours , an 88 % reduction in cost . The system greatly broadened the industrial working_class , and it paid them more . Ford paid his workers $ 5 a day in 1914 , arousing protests from other employers but creating new customers for the motor car , the new mass transportation . Ford himself was neither a model employer nor a model businessman . He hired goons and gun-toting executives to rough_up unionizing workers in the 1930s and almost sank his company by insisting on selling cars in only one color , black . His rival , Alfred P . Sloan Jr. , chairman of General Motors , moved past Ford by offering customers cars in five styles and price ranges . But both their systems relied_on the economies of mass production -- making as_many cars as possible so as_to spread the costs of plant and machinery over more units and thereby reduce the price of each car . It was a big-company strategy , seemingly impregnable to competition from smaller car_makers . But in postwar Japan , Ohno of Toyota couldn ' t count_on long production runs -- his company made 2 # 685 cars in all_of 1950 , less than half the daily output of a single Ford plant . * But Ohno , who with his boss , Toyota Chairman Eiji Toyoda , toured Ford ' s Rouge_plant in Detroit , noticed that in their eagerness to run as_many cars as possible through the assembly_line , U.S. makers allowed defects to go_through and corrected them at the end of the line . Ohno changed the emphasis to getting_it right the first time . Workers could stop the line to make_sure parts were properly attached , so there was no need for a repair department at the end . The system gave line_workers responsibility , so there was less need for checkers and supervisors . It was a recognition that the mindless labor of a former day -- the assembly_line work satirized by Charlie Chaplin in &quot; Modern Times &quot; -- did not suit the new , intelligent factory_workers . Ohno ' s lean production system also sharply reduced inventories and devised ways to change models in minutes as opposed to days , and thereby made short production runs economic . He reduced total car assembly time and cost by 56 % , built Toyota into the third-largest car producer in the world and opened the way for new countries and smaller producers to participate in the automobile business . Chrysler Corp. , for example , has adapted lean production enthusiastically because it allows profitable manufacture of many kinds of vehicles , from Jeeps to minivans . Still , nothing lasts forever . Just as Ford ' s mass production ran its course , so Ohno ' s production system has now become an excuse for bureaucracy and labor discontent at Toyota , reports analyst Maryann Keller in &quot; Collision , &quot; her new book on the global auto industry as it faces the 21st Century . * That century , which in a sense has already begun , is making new demands on automobiles and their producers , covering everything from the environment to traffic congestion to road safety -- air_bags are only a beginning . It ' s probably the internal_combustion engine ' s last roundup . The new century will see a new kind of vehicle , powered electrically by a fuel_cell or similar device , which may well be developed and produced in California . But it is also likely that the automobile_industry of the 21st Century , at least in the United States , Japan and Europe , will become an adjunct to communications . &quot; I envision a great variety of patterns , substituting communication for transportation , &quot; says futurist Alvin Toffler . Communications today refers to the new industry combining computers , telephones and televisions that is already creating new values , reducing costs dramatically and changing the nature of work -- producing , in short , its own industrial and social revolution . Henry_Ford would have understood . In &quot; Today and Tomorrow , &quot; his 1926 book , he wrote : &quot; The progress of the world has been in direct ratio to the convenience of communications. &quot;</TEXT>
