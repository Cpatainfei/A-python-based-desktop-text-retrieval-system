   <HEADLINE> U.S. TARGETS ILLEGAL SHARING OF SOFTWARE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal prosecutors say the indictment of an MIT computer_science major is the first move_in an assault on the illegal sharing of expensive copyrighted software . But members of a budding computer rights movement say the case could short-circuit computer users ' First_Amendment rights to information . A federal grand_jury indicted David LaMacchia on Thursday on one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud . The 20-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology junior is charged with running a computer bulletin_board that allowed users to illegally copy more_than $ 1 million worth of copyrighted software for free . The software included everything from games to word_processing programs . U.S. Atty . Donald K . Stern called the case the largest involving computer piracy in the nation ' s history . He indicated similar cases could follow as technology makes the exchange of information easier . &quot; In this new electronic environment it has become increasingly difficult to protect intellectual property_rights , &quot; Stern said . But to Richard Stallman , a software writer who founded and directs the Free Software Foundation , the government ' s case against LaMacchia &quot; is an additional increment in how our freedom is restricted to squeeze_out every possible penny for those software owners. &quot; According to the federal indictment , LaMacchia operated the computer bulletin_board at MIT in late 1993 and early this year under the computer aliases &quot; John Gaunt &quot; and &quot; Grimjack. &quot; Prosecutors say the bulletin_board , named Cynosure , allowed people on MIT ' s computer_network and the global Internet information highway to illegally copy the software . LaMacchia , who faces fines of up_to $ 250 # 000 and possible jail time , declined to comment on his case . His attorney , David Duncan , said LaMacchia should not be held responsible_for the activities of other people who may or may_not have used his bulletin_board . &quot; This raises serious First_Amendment issues , &quot; Duncan said . &quot; Are you going_to impose on the system operator the role of censorship ? &quot;</TEXT>
