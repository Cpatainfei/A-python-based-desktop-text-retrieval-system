   <TEXT> Re &quot; Gene Found That May Lead to Obesity , &quot; Dec . 1 : As dramatic as the discovery of a &quot; fat gene &quot; in mice may be , few among us should be lulled into laying the blame for an ever-present spare tire to some bad genes inherited from our parents . The fact remains that the overwhelming majority of those among us who are overweight are that way because we have become less physically active and because we eat too_much of the wrong food . A few may have a genetic malady , and for them this discovery gives some hope . The rest of us can easily do something about it now . From taking personal responsibility to get physically active on a regular basis with family or friends , to focusing_on life ' s small luxuries -- like elevators and escalators when stairs will do , and nearby parking spots that shortchange us of what little physical activity many already get -- there are countless opportunities in everyday life that anyone can take_advantage of . Our only reward will be better health , lower weight , more energy and a realization that , for most of us , the power to control our lives -- and our waistlines -- is within our reach and at our feet . FLORENCE GRIFFITH JOYNER TOM McMILLEN Co-chairs President ' s Council on Physical_Fitness and Sports , Washington * Am I alone in wondering if discovering and altering the gene that causes obesity is such a good thing ? Is it not possible that this gene may be present in some people for a reason ? It was only a_few thousand years ago that the Earth released itself from a prolonged Ice_Age . Many geologists theorize that the Earth may again slowly head toward a significant glacial_period in the next thousand years . By considering alteration of the genes that cause obesity , is it possible we might inadvertently eliminate an evolutionary trait of humans that allows us to adapt to changing climates ? Moreover , is it wise_to alter human genealogy , evolved over millions of years , in the name of this short-term desire for thinness ? Researchers should think long and hard before messing with human genes . Some of these genes , unbeknownst to us , may be essential to the long-term evolutionary survival of our species .
