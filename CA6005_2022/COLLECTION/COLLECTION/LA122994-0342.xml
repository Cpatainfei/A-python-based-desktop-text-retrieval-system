   <HEADLINE> O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY ; REPORTER ' S NOTEBOOK ; DON ' T BET ON CITRON BEING IN LAS VEGAS WITH ACTIVIST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Unlikely couple : Huntington Beach political activist Bill Mello has emerged as a vocal critic of county officials in the wake of the financial crisis . But that doesn ' t mean he ' s lost his sense_of_humor . Mello , a leader of a taxpayers ' group called the Committees of Correspondence , is out of town this week . The greeting on his answering machine says he ' s not traveling alone . &quot; Hi . Bob Citron and I will be playing blackjack in Vegas until the 30th , &quot; Mello jokes in the message , which goes_on to wish callers happy holidays . Citron resigned as county treasurer-tax collector earlier this month . * No comment : As city officials scurry to complete a questionnaire sent to them by Securities and Exchange Commission investigators on the troubled investment pool , Villa Park City_Manager Fred Maley is putting his foot down . &quot; It ' s a fishing expedition , &quot; he said Wednesday , adding that he doesn ' t plan to complete the 10-page questionnaire . Maley said he ' s focusing his energies on the city ' s financial situation and doesn ' t believe anything would be accomplished by answering a series of questions about the city ' s dealings with the county treasurer ' s office . &quot; I considered it to be inflammatory , &quot; he said . &quot; To me , it doesn ' t aid the situation. &quot; Maley said the city attorney informed him that Villa Park is under no legal obligation to complete the questionnaire . * Can they afford a dictionary ? : Irvine city officials have spent the last month trying to convince worried residents that the city is not teetering on the brink of financial collapse . Calming fears has proved difficult because of the city ' s hefty $ 209-million investment in the county pool . Officials insist that the city doesn ' t have any short-term cash flow problems because it placed funds in several investments , not just the county ' s pool . &quot; We didn ' t put all_of our eggs in that one basket , &quot; City_Manager Paul O . Brady Jr . said . At a council meeting Tuesday , Brady tried his best to eliminate one worst-case scenario for residents . &quot; ' Bankruptcy ' is not even in our vocabulary , &quot; he declared . * No sunny day at the park : Because of the financial crisis , county parks were closed Monday . But that didn ' t stop hundreds of people from attempting to enjoy a day-after-Christmas picnic at Irvine Regional Park . Sheriff ' s deputies discovered the picnickers after noticing more_than 100 cars_parked illegally along Santiago Canyon Road near the park . &quot; The gates were padlocked with signs posted all_over the place , &quot; Sheriff ' s Lt . Tom Garner said . &quot; So to get_around that , people parked illegally and walked in. &quot; They were all told that their vehicles would be towed if they didn ' t move them , Garner said . By about 2 p.m. , everyone had packed up and left the area , he added . County parks will also be closed Monday . * Helping hand : With $ 12.8 million of its money tied_up in the troubled investment pool , the Tustin Unified School District is turning_to an old-fashioned fund-raising technique : a garage sale . On Jan . 11-12 , school district officials said they plan to sell old furniture , chairs , desks , fans , file_cabinets , tables , televisions , typewriters , vacuum_cleaners and other surplus district property . Although the garage sale is held every year , officials said the event has taken_on more urgency this time because of the financial crisis . Two weeks ago , the school_board approved more_than $ 1 million in cuts , including a halt to the purchase of new equipment and supplies . &quot; Anything that can bring money into the district is a special event this year , &quot; said Trustee Jonathan W . Abelove . The sale will take_place at the district ' s Support Services Facility , 1302 Service Road , Tustin . Money from the garage sale would be used to buy needed classroom supplies .</TEXT>
