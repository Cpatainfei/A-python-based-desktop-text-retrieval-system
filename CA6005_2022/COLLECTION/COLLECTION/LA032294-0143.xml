   <HEADLINE> NORTH_KOREA ATOMIC ISSUE SENT TO U.N. ; DIPLOMACY : INSPECTION AGENCY SEEKS SECURITY_COUNCIL ACTION ON DISPUTE . U.S. SAYS IT WILL SEND PATRIOTS TO S . KOREA AND RESUME MILITARY EXERCISES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With its inspections of North_Korean nuclear facilities thwarted , the International Atomic Energy Agency moved Monday to ask the U.N. Security_Council to help resolve its dispute with the Pyongyang regime . It was the first time in almost a year of tangled diplomacy that the international agency felt compelled to seek Security_Council action against North_Korea . Although the council could eventually impose economic sanctions against Pyongyang , most analysts believe that it will not do so immediately -- partly because China , a permanent member with veto power over council resolutions , has said it is not yet ready to support sanctions . &quot; The main thing is that ( the IAEA ) has now passed the ball to the Security_Council , &quot; one Clinton_Administration official said Monday night . &quot; We ' re on completely new territory now . This will be a precedential case as_to how the Security_Council responds. &quot; At the same time , the Clinton_Administration took steps Monday to shift its confrontation with North_Korea from a diplomatic approach to a military one . The Pentagon announced it is sending a battalion of Patriot missiles to South_Korea and laying the groundwork to resume the massive &quot; Team_Spirit &quot; military exercises with South_Korean forces later this year . A Patriot missile battalion has from three to six batteries of missiles . Each battery has eight launchers ; each launcher carries four missiles . The Pentagon said the Patriot battalion will arrive in South_Korea in 30 to 35 days , along with 850 soldiers from Ft . Bliss , Tex. , who will operate and maintain the batteries . Both the IAEA and the Administration were responding to recent intransigence by North_Korea . In the last few days , the regime of President Kim Il Sung has prevented the IAEA from finishing a round of inspections of North_Korea ' s nuclear facilities . Over the weekend , Pyongyang ' s delegate walked_out_of talks with South_Korea , threatening to turn Seoul into a &quot; sea of fire. &quot; The IAEA is the organization responsible_for checking nuclear facilities , including reactors and reprocessing plants , to ensure they are used for peaceful purposes of energy production rather than to produce the fuel for nuclear_weapons . At a meeting Monday in Vienna , the agency adopted a resolution somewhat milder than had been anticipated . Instead of washing its hands of the issue completely , the IAEA gave North_Korea one more chance to go_along with inspections of its facilities . But it formally referred the issue to the Security_Council , the first_step toward involving the council in the dispute . Experts say chances are that the council will start with a resolution simply condemning North_Korea . &quot; Frankly , it is more important that a ( Security_Council ) resolution show North_Korea that it is completely isolated than that it call_for immediate sanctions , &quot; said Arnold Kanter of the RAND Corp . &quot; Building a coalition is more important than ( trying_for ) a resolution which calls_for sanctions , which , right now , everyone else is opposed to . That would be shooting ourselves in the foot. &quot; An Administration official said Security_Council members will probably have informal discussions on North_Korea this week and may then try to adopt some form of resolution or statement next week . At first , U.S. officials say , the council might approve some weakly worded statement that simply urges North_Korea to drop its resistance and let IAEA inspectors finish their work_at the nuclear installations . Administration officials hope that China will go_along with such a statement . They were encouraged Monday that the Chinese delegation in Vienna did not veto Monday ' s IAEA resolution , choosing instead to abstain . The next step envisioned by the Administration would be a Security_Council resolution that , in_effect , calls_on the Pyongyang regime to comply with inspections &quot; or else. &quot; The last step would be some move toward U.N. economic sanctions . Such a process could take months . During that time , the Pentagon will apparently step_up pressure on North_Korea . Besides the Patriots and Team_Spirit exercises , some experts have said the United States could increase its troop presence in South_Korea and hold a naval exercise in waters near North_Korea . U.S. military commanders have said they want the Patriots brought_to South_Korea now , primarily for reasons of convenience and logistics : At the moment , they can be brought_in routinely by sea . By contrast , if the Patriots were needed on an emergency basis after or just before the outbreak of war , the missiles would have to be sent to South_Korea by air , taking_up airlift space that could otherwise be used for other equipment and personnel . Still , some specialists say the Patriots ' dispatch is primarily symbolic . Through this small action , they say , Clinton could satisfy those in the United States who seek tougher policies , while the Administration quietly continues to work toward a diplomatic solution . &quot; These are just things that give political cover to President Clinton &quot; and South_Korean President Kim Young Sam , said Selig Harrison , a North_Korea specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . &quot; If ( Clinton ) is prepared to go_to negotiations with North_Korea , then he needs some political cover. &quot; Pentagon officials said Monday that the joint U.S.-South Korean Team_Spirit military exercises will now probably take_place around September . The exercises had once been tentatively scheduled for this month but were put_off when North_Korea agreed to let_in IAEA inspectors . It is difficult , if not impossible , to carry_out Team_Spirit exercises in the spring or summer , while rice is being planted and cultivated in many areas of South_Korea . So whether intentionally or not , North_Korea ' s decision to first admit the IAEA inspectors , then to bar them from completing their work , succeeded in stopping Team_Spirit for about six months . U.S. officials said Monday that they are unsure what prompted North_Korea to dig_in its heels over the last week and to stop cooperating with the international inspections . &quot; One explanation is that they are hiding something &quot; in their nuclear sites , a State_Department official said . &quot; Another is that this is part of North_Korea ' s political tactics , seeking to put pressure upon the United States and South_Korea &quot; in negotiations over political and economic help for Pyongyang . Harrison , who has visited Pyongyang several times and is one of the strongest supporters in Washington of a conciliatory approach toward North_Korea , suggested that the latest tactic is merely a negotiating ploy . North_Korean officials &quot; don ' t want to give everything to us before they have a negotiation , &quot; he asserted . &quot; They are just behaving in their usual and exasperating way. &quot; The United States has said it is prepared to talk_about an improvement in ties with North_Korea and economic help for Pyongyang at a new round of talks , which would begin after the IAEA completes its inspections . North_Korea apparently believes that it has already cooperated sufficiently with the IAEA and that it is entitled to the new round of negotiations now .
