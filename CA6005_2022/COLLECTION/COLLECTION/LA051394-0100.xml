   <HEADLINE> DEATH IN THE WINGS ; * ' MIJO ' DRAMATIZES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EX-LOVER OF A MAN DYING OF AIDS AND THE MAN ' S MOTHER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ask Michael Kearns where his newest play , &quot; Mijo , &quot; comes from , and he answers with a single word : truth . &quot; I was taking_care of an ex-lover , a Cuban , and his mother had come_to live with him in the final weeks , &quot; says the writer . &quot; One of the most chilling things I ever heard -- a line he repeated over and over -- was , ' You brought me into this world ; you have to take me out. ' &quot; Originally , the relationship between the boyfriend and the mother was dramatized in Kearns ' 1993 collection of AIDS-related tableaux , &quot; Off. &quot; Now , he has reshaped the story into a two-act play : The first part takes_place as the son is in the next room dying ; the second , after he ' s gone . It ' s a challenge to come_up with a fresh take_on the subject , admits Kearns , an activist and writer whose theater work includes the AIDS-themed &quot; intimacies , &quot; &quot; more intimacies , &quot; &quot; Myron &quot; and &quot; Rock. &quot; &quot; My job is to approach this AIDS thing in a different way , make you want to go_to the theater , &quot; says the actor , who vamped it up in Charles Ludlum ' s drag tragicomedy &quot; Camille &quot; last year at Highways . &quot; Here , the dying person is off stage , and the focus is_on the people around him , their responses to each other. &quot; * On Sunday , Kearns ' drama will have its world_premiere at NoHo Studios , as part of its ongoing &quot; Theatre at Three &quot; series . &quot; You never see the son ; it ' s just two characters -- a black_man and a Hispanic woman , &quot; explains the play ' s director , Alec Doyle , who has worked locally at Beyond Baroque , Pacific Resident Theatre Ensemble and Theatre / Theater . &quot; The mother , Carmen , is doing this deathwatch on her son , and in walks Juan ' s longtime lover , Michael , who basically tells her , ' You ' ve got_to let him go. ' &quot; At 6 feet 5 inches , flamboyant and leather-clad , Michael , Doyle says , is a bit of a metaphor -- &quot; real but not real. &quot; &quot; On a deeper level , he ' s been conjured by Carmen to get her through this. &quot; * In the face of Carmen ' s stoic Catholicism , notes Doyle , Michael argues passionately for euthanasia : &quot; He tells her , ' It ' s not about bad boys or good boys -- it ' s about finding forgiveness. ' Michael works as a combination guide , shaman , trickster ; he takes her down the path to shed all_of this old-world guilt. &quot; Between acts , we learn that the two , working in concert , have killed Juan . &quot; Carmen realizes it was a release she did for her son , &quot; says the director , &quot; that she can hold onto him in her heart , and what a good feeling that is. &quot; In spite of the seemingly heavy subject_matter , Doyle -- who has a degree in cultural_anthropology from the University of New Hampshire -- promises &quot; lots of humor. &quot; When he originally read the script and talked_about it with Kearns , he recalls thinking , &quot; ' This is interesting and disturbing. ' It stayed with me , leaving a question_mark . Also , as a straight_man , the fact that I ' m attracted to this piece , and that Michael would choose to work with me , points_out its universal qualities . It ' s about AIDS and euthanasia , but it ' s really universal . Everyone can get a handle on that. &quot; WHERE AND WHEN What : &quot; Mijo. &quot; Location : NoHo Studios , 5215 Lankershim Blvd. , North Hollywood . Hours : 3 p.m. Sundays . Closes June 19 . Price : $ 10 . Call : ( 213 ) 969-2445 .</TEXT>
