   <HEADLINE> ROLLER DERBY ; THE POPULARITY OF ROLLER HOCKEY SURGES AS PLAYERS USE EVERYTHING FROM PARKING LOTS TO TENNIS_COURTS FOR RINKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Seven-year-old Tommy Simpson flails his arms like a speed skater on bad ice as he whizzes around a portable roller hockey rink on in-line skates . The Manhattan Beach resident and a dozen other pint-size players engulfed from head to toe in protective pads are skating around the rink in Hermosa Beach to learn the ropes of roller hockey , one of the South Bay ' s fastest-growing sports . &quot; Can you picture yourself at the Forum after scoring a goal ? &quot; coach John O ' Rourke , 28 , bellows as his cassette_player blasts Van Halen ' s rollicking &quot; Jump. &quot; &quot; Can you hear the roar of the crowd ? &quot; Simpson can . He leaps into the air and screams victoriously as he rushes over the asphalt , then trips violently over his skates . &quot; Sometimes it hurts , &quot; Simpson says as he sprays cool water over his face during a break_in the class . &quot; But football is stupid , and baseball is stupid , and I like this a lot. &quot; Even the nastiest spills don ' t check the enthusiasm of Simpson and other fans . From blacktop parking_lots in Gardena to the beachside bicycle path in Manhattan Beach , scores of in-line skaters clutching aluminum and wooden hockey_sticks are knocking the sport ' s colorful plastic pucks everywhere . In Torrance , nearly 1 # 800 players converge every week on a $ 120 # 000 roller hockey rink to compete in games that sometime run until midnight . A league in Redondo Beach , which uses portable foam boards to construct a makeshift rink on school playgrounds , doubled in size in only four months . &quot; It ' s just exploding , &quot; said Heath Mazenauer , 27 , manager of the Golden Bear Skate Shop in Lomita , where sales of roller hockey equipment have risen almost 40 % in the last two years . The shop recently sold_out of one style of in-line skates and is struggling to keep others in_stock . Manufacturers say they can ' t keep_up with orders . Enthusiasts say they are drawn to the fast pace of the sport , a combination of ice_hockey and roller_skating that dates_back to the 1930s , when skaters on_the_roads of New York fashioned street-worthy pucks from electrical tape . Nationwide , the number of roller hockey_players has doubled each year for the last five years , according to Shawn Jones , executive_director of the Miami-based National In-Line Hockey Assn . Of the country ' s 12 million in-line skaters , Jones estimates that 1 million play roller hockey . Many credit ice_hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky with the sport ' s explosive growth in the South Bay . Ever since Gretzky signed with the Los Angeles Kings in 1988 , increasing numbers of fans donning replicas of his black-and-silver jersey have taken_to area playgrounds on skates . And not all are young males . At the rink in Torrance , girls practice slap shots next to boys during youth-league games and helmet-clad men , some of them pushing 50 , bounce off the rink ' s boards chasing the puck in adult games . Even Torrance police and Carson sheriff ' s deputies have roller hockey teams. * * But while the number of roller hockey_players has surged in the South Bay in recent years , the number of rinks has not . Except for the rink in Torrance and another in Redondo Beach , the South Bay has little to offer competitors . Compounding the problems for area roller hockey devotees are laws in many South Bay cities banning skating in city parks . City officials say skaters pose safety problems in parks and raise liability concerns . * But in the last year , officials in many communities have begun to recognize the need for rinks , and some South Bay cities are scrambling to provide residents with places to play . El Segundo approved plans recently for a $ 10 # 000 portable rink that is_due in the city by the end of August . Avalon plans to construct a rink over several old tennis_courts later this year , and Carson and Gardena are studying whether to purchase rinks . Meanwhile , inventive enthusiasts find ways to make_do . In El Segundo , Jean-Louis Boudreau , 34 , and a_few friends transformed a_couple_of high_school tennis_courts into a roller hockey rink by constructing foot-high borders around one end of the courts to keep pucks in_play . The boards make tennis play nearly impossible , but school officials say they have agreed to keep the jerry-built rink because they recognize the sport ' s popularity in the city . Tennis_players head for other courts on the school campus . &quot; We made some tennis people real upset , but there are better courts at ( Recreation Park ) , &quot; says Boudreau , who played ice_hockey on frozen baseball fields while growing_up in Montreal . In Manhattan Beach , where skaters are banned from city parks , die-hards sometimes set_up goals in the middle of city streets . When cars approach , players grab the goals and scramble to the sidewalks . Officials say they are considering putting a portable rink in the city . Until such plans come_to fruition , the $ 120 # 000 roller hockey rink built last year at Wilson Park in Torrance has shouldered much of the burden . The city-owned rink is operated by the Torrance Skate Assn. , a nonprofit group founded in 1992 that pays all insurance costs under a three-year contract with the city signed last year . The full-size rink , complete with an electronic scoreboard , four-foot boards and smooth concrete , attracts enthusiasts from throughout the South Bay . Since the 2-year-old skate association opened the rink in October , the number of league players has risen from 850 to 1 # 800 . For the first time recently , the organizers were forced to turn players away . &quot; It ' s really tough , &quot; says Craig Hama , 34 , who helped organize the league with several others . &quot; We need to do something very quickly so people have places to play. &quot; Hama , who is so devoted to the sport that his wife , Lori , often refers to him as &quot; Puckhead , &quot; says the organization is considering ways to build another rink in the city . * Meanwhile , players between ages 6 and 48 pay $ 60 to $ 90 each to join teams organized into age_groups and playing abilities . They flock to the rink on weeknights and weekends to play games under the watchful eye of a referee . The games are much like ice_hockey , in which six-player teams compete to knock a rubber puck into the opposing team ' s goal . But roller hockey has a_few key differences . Players are not allowed to block opponents using their bodies -- known in ice_hockey as checking -- which cuts_down on fighting and violence , particularly in youth leagues . In addition , many roller hockey_leagues eliminate off-sides rules , which in ice_hockey limit how far a puck can be passed . As a result , the game is faster because passes can travel the length of the rink and more goals can be scored . The sounds are different too . Unlike ice_hockey , where cool rinks echo with the slicing of sharpened blades against ice , Torrance ' s outdoor rink reverberates with the clattering and squeaking of tiny wheels . Quieter moments are punctuated by shouts of &quot; Ice it ! &quot; and &quot; Go_after the puck ! &quot; from encouraging friends and family members who follow the action from the bleachers . Elizabeth Allen , 35 , of Carson , sat quietly on a recent Sunday afternoon as she watched her son , Eric , 11 , skate up and down the rink with his team , the Lightnings . &quot; I really like the sport , &quot; she says . &quot; It builds self-confidence and keeps the kids off the street , and I ' ve never seen a fight break out. &quot; Many parents who were concerned that violence in professional ice_hockey would be replicated in roller hockey say they have been pleased with the way organizers in Torrance and Redondo have kept the rough-and-tumble to a minimum . &quot; I was really hesitant at first , &quot; says Lisi Masoni , whose 10-year-old son , Matthew , told her he wanted to play roller hockey last April . &quot; But I find the kids don ' t get too aggressive , and he loves it. &quot; Masoni , of Manhattan Beach , doesn ' t plan to take_to the rink herself . &quot; I tried Rollerblading and it hurt my back , &quot; she says . But some parents have followed in the skating steps of their children . Darren Allison , 32 , of Torrance , signed_up for the city ' s adult league after watching his son , Johnnie , wheel up and down the Wilson Park rink in action-packed games . * As a spectator , Allison quickly moved from the bleachers to the fence abutting the rink . Then , when he could move no closer , he headed for a local shop and bought a pair of skates . He now plays_on the Blues . &quot; It ' s just great , &quot; says Allison , who works_at a wholesale fish brokerage in Los Angeles . &quot; If you ' ve got any aggressions to get_out , this is the place to do it. &quot; Allison waited for his son ' s team to play_on a recent weekend after his team was shut_out 4-0 by the Chuds . &quot; Whether you win or lose you always come_off with a real good attitude , &quot; he says . Hockey_coach O ' Rourke started the South Bay Tides Roller Hockey Club in Redondo Beach in January , emphasiZing fun over competition . &quot; Some coaches put the emphasis in the wrong area , &quot; he says . &quot; But this is about boosting self-confidence and having a good time . We make_sure they shake hands at the end of every game. &quot; Like Torrance organizers , O ' Rourke has seen his league of 7- to 16-year-olds explode in the last six months -- from 80 players in January to 160 in April . He expects 300 sign-ups this fall . &quot; It ' s just an electrifying game , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s quick and every body ' s always in the action. &quot; Dick Oglesby has been a fan of hockey ' s thrill-a-minute games for more_than 25 years . The El Segundo resident pushed city officials to purchase a roller hockey rink recently after he saw young residents playing the game on high_school tennis_courts and later learned such activity was banned in city parks . &quot; I got a little upset , &quot; he says . &quot; I thought we ought to do_better for the kids. &quot; * Oglesby , 54 , persuaded city officials to purchase a temporary rink to be set_up behind El Segundo Middle_School which arrived last week . He and a newly created roller hockey board plan to organize a league to begin play in October . It ' s not the first time Oglesby has organized competitive teams . After he saw children playing ice_hockey on a frozen lagoon in Illinois 25 years ago , Oglesby organized a 20-player league that quickly grew To 70 players . He says he hopes the El Segundo league will follow_suit so he can one day persuade city officials to install a permanent rink . To generate enthusiasm , he plans to invite professional players from the Los Angeles Kings to conduct an educational clinic for El Segundo youths . Kings ' Coach Barry Melrose , an El Segundo resident , sits on the city ' s newly established seven-member roller hockey board which represents the El Segundo Roller Blade Assn . But while some South Bay residents gear_up to play roller hockey , others prefer to watch the sport at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood , where the Los Angeles Blades professional roller hockey_team competes against 22 other teams from throughout the U.S. and Canada . &quot; It ' s better than baseball , &quot; says Gary Van Zandt , 37 , of Redondo Beach , one of 5 # 000 fans who watched the Blades battle the Anaheim Bullfrogs recently . &quot; I gave_up a date to be here tonight. &quot; Van Zandt and Ron Carcich , also of Redondo Beach , have attended many of the Blades ' games since the team began playing_at the Forum last year . Struggling to make his voice heard over the Forum ' s blaring sound_system , Carcich says he appreciates the players ' enthusiasm for the sport . * Enthusiasm is one characteristic that few South Bay roller hockey_players lack , whether they play in front of thousands of fans at the Forum or on dilapidated tennis_courts in El Segundo . And with their skates tightened , many players are readying for the sport ' s growth . Juan Del Valle , one of 15 Torrance Police_officers who play_on the department ' s team , says he hopes the sport will soon be added_to the California Police Olympics , an annual competition in which officers compete in sports from golf to surfing . And Allison , the 32-year-old father who joined the Torrance league after watching his son play , says his family will be equipped for the action . He recently cut_down a hockey_stick for his 2-year-old daughter , Kelsey . &quot; She ' s already hitting the puck around the yard , &quot; he says .
